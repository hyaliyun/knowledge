Background BBC Radio Durham was part of the BBC's original plan to have nine sites where local radio experiments would be carried out. It is the only one of the original stations to have fully closed down. It opened on 3 July 1968, but after the government restricted the BBC to twenty local radio stations, the corporation responded by ceasing transmissions on 25 August 1972. Its resources were transferred to Carlisle where BBC Radio Carlisle, now BBC Radio Cumbria, was formed. It was the only one of the original stations to cover a county rather than a city. When the BBC opened Radio Newcastle which covered the north of the county and Radio Teesside (later Radio Cleveland and now BBC Tees) covered the south, it was sandwiched between the two. Although, in effect the radio station itself was moved to Carlisle to create the new service there. County Durham is now covered by BBC Radio Newcastle and BBC Radio Tees. Former BBC News correspondent Kate Adie worked at Radio Durham, before joining BBC Radio Bristol in 1970. Other presenters included Mike Hollingsworth, Eileen McCabe and Barbara Bailey.

Background  Zhang Guifang is the commander of Green Dragon Pass and serves under Grand Old Master Wen Zhong like an iron sword. In appearance, Zhang wears bulky white royal armor and wields a large ice spear. Due to Zhang's original status, he wields the magical ability \\"name call\\"; with this ability, Zhang could paralyze any individual if he happens to say their true name (such an ability is impossible to use on Superiormen however). Following the trickery of Chao Lei, Wen Zhong would send Zhang and his vanguard Feng Lin to the Western Foothills on a punitive campaign. Following Zhang's arrival, he would try to convince Jiang Ziya to \\"see the light\\" and return to King Zhou. Shortly following this, a major battle would ensue between Zhang and his army. While personally dueling against Huang Feihu, he would shout the words, \\"Huang Feihu, get down from your beast!\\" Thus, Zhang captured Huang and returned to camp. Later on, Nezha would confront Zhang around two days following the previous conflict with Jiang Ziya. Nezha would use his divine renown to easily smash through Zhang's unit of a thousand troops and even destroy Zhang's right arm with a crucial attack. However, Wang Magus would later heal Zhang's wounds, effectively allowing him to return again in battle. Following the desperate actions of Li Resounding, Zhang would immediately appear and rescue him from trouble. However, Zhang himself would be forced to flee. At the time of night, Jiang Ziya would send the Chao Twins and Heavenly Happiness before Zhang's camp. After declaring his eternal allegiance to King Zhou, Zhang would commit suicide by impaling himself with his sword.

Then given matrices A, B, and C, the problem is to find the possible matrices X that obey this equation. All matrices are assumed to have coefficients in the complex numbers. For the equation to make sense, the matrices must have appropriate sizes, for example they could all be square matrices of the same size. But more generally, A and B must be square matrices of sizes n and m respectively, and then X and C both have n rows and m columns. A Sylvester equation has a unique solution for X exactly when there are no common eigenvalues of A and −B. More generally, the equation AX + XB = C has been considered as an equation of bounded operators on a (possibly infinite-dimensional) Banach space. In this case, the condition for the uniqueness of a solution X is almost the same: There exists a unique solution X exactly when the spectra of A and −B are disjoint.Bhatia and Rosenthal, 1997 Existence and uniqueness of the solutions Using the Kronecker product notation and the vectorization operator \\\\operatorname{vec}, we can rewrite Sylvester's equation in the form : (I_m \\\\otimes A + B^T \\\\otimes I_n) \\\\operatorname{vec}X = \\\\operatorname{vec}C, where A is of dimension n! \\\\times! n, B is of dimension m!\\\\times!m, X of dimension n!\\\\times!m and I_k is the k \\\\times k identity matrix. In this form, the equation can be seen as a linear system of dimension mn \\\\times mn.However, rewriting the equation in this form is not advised for the numerical solution since this version is costly to solve and can be ill-conditioned. Theorem. Given matrices A\\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}^{n\\\\times n} and B\\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}^{m\\\\times m}, the Sylvester equation AX+XB=C has a unique solution X\\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}^{n\\\\times m} for any C\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C}^{n\\\\times m} if and only if A and -B do not share any eigenvalue. Proof. The equation AX+XB=C is a linear system with mn unknowns and the same amount of equations. Hence it is uniquely solvable for any given C if and only if the homogeneous equation AX+XB=0 admits only the trivial solution 0. (i) Assume that A and -B do not share any eigenvalue. Let X be a solution to the abovementioned homogeneuous equation. Then AX=X(-B), which can be lifted to A^kX = X(-B)^k for each k \\\\ge 0 by mathematical induction. Consequently, p(A) X = X p(-B) for any polynomial p. In particular, let p be the characteristic polynomial of A. Then p(A)=0 due to the Cayley-Hamilton theorem; meanwhile, the spectral mapping theorem tells us \\\\sigma(p(-B)) = p(\\\\sigma(-B)), where \\\\sigma(\\\\cdot) denotes the spectrum of a matrix. Since A and -B do not share any eigenvalue, p(\\\\sigma(-B)) does not contain zero, and hence p(-B) is nonsingular. Thus X= 0 as desired. This proves the \\"if\\" part of the theorem. (ii) Now assume that A and -B share an eigenvalue \\\\lambda. Let u be a corresponding right eigenvector for A, v be a corresponding left eigenvector for -B, and X=u{v}^*. Then X eq 0, and AX+XB = A(uv^*)-(uv^*)(-B) = \\\\lambda uv^*-\\\\lambda uv^* = 0. Hence X is a nontrivial solution to the aforesaid homogeneous equation, justifying the \\"only if\\" part of the theorem. Q.E.D. As an alternative to the spectral mapping theorem, the nonsigularity of p(-B) in part (i) of the proof can also be demonstrated by the Bézout's identity for coprime polynomials. Let q be the characteristic polynomial of -B. Since A and -B do not share any eigenvalue, p and q are coprime. Hence there exist polynomials f and g such that p(z)f(z)+q(z)g(z)\\\\equiv 1. By the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, q(-B)=0. Thus p(-B)f(-B)=I, implying that p(-B) is nonsigular. The theorem remains true if \\\\mathbb{C} is replaced by \\\\mathbb{R} everywhere. The proof for the \\"if\\" part is still applicable; for the \\"only if\\" part, note that both \\\\mathrm{Re}(uv^*) and \\\\mathrm{Im}(uv^*) satisfy the homogenous equation AX+XB=0, and they cannot be zero simultaneously. Roth's removal rule Given two square complex matrices A and B, of size n and m, and a matrix C of size n by m, then one can ask when the following two square matrices of size n + m are similar to each other: \\\\begin{bmatrix} A & C \\\\ 0 & B \\\\end{bmatrix} and \\\\begin{bmatrix} A & 0 \\\\0&B; \\\\end{bmatrix}. The answer is that these two matrices are similar exactly when there exists a matrix X such that AX − XB = C. In other words, X is a solution to a Sylvester equation. This is known as Roth's removal rule. One easily checks one direction: If AX − XB = C then :\\\\begin{bmatrix}I_n & X \\\\ 0 & I_m \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} A&C;\\\\0&B; \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} I_n & -X \\\\ 0& I_m \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} A&0\\\\0&B; \\\\end{bmatrix}. Roth's removal rule does not generalize to infinite-dimensional bounded operators on a Banach space.Bhatia and Rosenthal, p.3 Numerical solutions A classical algorithm for the numerical solution of the Sylvester equation is the Bartels–Stewart algorithm, which consists of transforming A and B into Schur form by a QR algorithm, and then solving the resulting triangular system via back-substitution. This algorithm, whose computational cost is \\\\mathcal{O}(n^3) arithmetical operations, is used, among others, by LAPACK and the \`lyap\` function in GNU Octave.

History The IIT Institute of Design is a school of design founded in 1937 in Chicago by László Moholy-Nagy, a Bauhaus teacher (1923–1928). After a spell in London, Bauhaus master Moholy-Nagy, at the invitation of Chicago's Association of Art and Industry, moved to Chicago in 1937 to start a new design school, which he named the New Bauhaus. The philosophy of the school was basically unchanged from that of the original, and its first headquarters was the Prairie Avenue mansion that architect Richard Morris Hunt, designed for department store magnate Marshall Field. Due to financial problems the school briefly closed in 1938. However, Walter Paepcke, Chairman of the Container Corporation of America and an early champion of industrial design in America, soon offered his personal support, and in 1939, Moholy-Nagy re-opened the school as the Chicago School of Design. In 1944, this became the Institute of Design, and in 1949 it became part of the new Illinois Institute of Technology university system and also the first institution in the United States to offer a PhD in design. Moholy authored an account of his efforts to develop the curriculum of the School of Design in his book Vision in Motion. Archival materials are held by the Ryerson & Burnham Libraries at the Art Institute of Chicago. The Institute of Design Collection includes articles, letters, photographs, and other materials documenting the institute's history and works by faculty and students. Select archival film materials are held at Chicago Film Archives, who store and provide access to a handful of Institute of Design films. Educational programs The Institute of Design offers two professional degrees, the Master of Design (MDes) and the Master of Design Methods (MDM), as well as a research degree, the PhD, which was the first doctoral program in design in the United States, and a dual MDes/MBA degree program, also the first of its kind, with the IIT Stuart School of Business. At one time, the Institute of Design offered a Bachelor of Science in Design degree, with specialties in Photography, Product Design and Communication Design. The Bachelor's program was halted in 1998. Conferences The Institute of Design annually organizes two large design conferences in the Chicago area: The Strategy Conference for international executives and designers who come together to address how businesses can use design to explore emerging opportunities, and the Design Research Conference, organized by students, exploring emerging trends in design research.

Initially, it was to be the seventh track of the double album configuration, featured on side two of the LP. When the album was shortened to a single LP by CBS Records, eight of the eighteen total tracks were removed, including \\"Beatles Forever.\\" The other seven tracks have since had official releases on various albums and remasters in some form prior to the 2018 double album release. Though this reissue of the parent album was meant to follow the original 1983 intended configuration, \\"Beatles Forever\\" was again excluded, making it the only \\"lost\\" track from the original album not to appear later as an official bonus track or part of a compilation.  Recording and composition  Recorded in February, 1982, \\"Beatles Forever\\" was one of the first songs recorded for Secret Messages. The band was in the middle of the Dutch portion of the Time Tour when they visited Wisseloord Studios to record a few new songs— something that Lynne would later refer to as a \\"flying visit.\\"Secret Messages 2001 remaster liner notes. Along with the songs \\"Train of Gold\\", \\"No Way Out\\" and \\"Motor Factory\\" (early version of \\"Rock 'n' Roll is King\\") that were all started during that same session, \\"Beatles Forever\\" is known as one of the four tracks bassist Kelly Groucutt performed on the album. The track is a Beatles tribute song, with lyrics that give high admiration to the band and their songs. Throughout the chorus, various Beatles' song titles are sung and quoted, with some including their corresponding motifs played on either Lynne's guitar or Richard Tandy's synthesizers. The song is in C major and has a main tempo of roughly 77 beats-per-minute while the second half of the chorus has a faster 152 bpm. Along with drummer Bev Bevan's playing and common on the parent album, the drum machine Oberheim DMX is featured, providing additional percussion elements, though it is unclear if Lynne or Tandy specifically contributed to this aspect. Lynne, Groucutt and touring musician Dave Morgan provided backing vocals on the pre-chorus and chorus; Morgan later recalled in an interview that he was mimicking the vocals of John Lennon. No orchestral strings are featured on the song in its entirety. At the end, the sounds of a cheering audience are heard as the chorus fades out, closing the track.  Legacy  As of 2020, \\"Beatles Forever\\" remains unreleased officially. Acetates of the original 1983 double LP configuration that include the song do exist and have appeared on eBay on several occasions. Bootlegs of the song have circulated online, with one of them being a low-quality recording of the song being played at an ELO fan convention in 2001. Despite its unreleased status, the song has been covered by others on YouTube. In mid- to-late 2020, the song was leaked in significantly higher quality twice, once in July and once in September. Both leaks claim to be a recording of the acetates. Jeff Lynne has since remarked the song as one he is not fond of. In a 2001 interview with Rockline, Lynne described: > \\"It's 'cause it's so fawning, y'know. It's so over the top, y'know. Um... > maybe one day it'll come out. I'd like to sort of redo it or something.\\" Although not released on any official medium, a small snippet of the song's intro can be heard on the final fade out of the 2018 double LP version of \\"No Way Out\\" via print-through, if one was to turn their volume up.

The House Quincy House is a home to Catholic graduate students from across North America, located in the historic Brookland neighborhood of the District of Columbia. Within easy walking distance of the Catholic University of America, the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception and the Franciscan Monastery, Quincy is something of an epicenter of Catholic young adult culture, best known for its celebrations of the Christian Sabbath, the Lord's Day, and for its monthly coffee house events, of which recordings are regularly produced and posted online. A \\"Best of Quincy, vol. 1\\" is anticipated within the next year. Residents of Quincy House have been known to study philosophy, theology and national security at CUA, the Pontifical John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and Family at The Catholic University of America, and The Institute of World Politics, respectively. Famous Quincy-ites include John- Mark Miravalle, Instructor at the School of Faith at St. Lawrence Catholic Campus Center, University of Kansas,, Aaron R. Linderman, two-time Arizona State Geography Bee Champion,. History=The First Quincy House The original Quincy House was built in the summer of 1781 by Jeremiah Cunningham (born 1756), a graduate of the College of William & Mary, who left Williamsburg earlier in the year when the British invasion of Virginia forced the closing of the college and ended the lively intellectual life he had come to love. One of the founding members of Phi Beta Kappa, Cunningham came from a family of some means and intended to take up the life of a learned gentleman, living off his estate's income while undertaking a life of moral, civic and intellectual virtue. (Cunningham was a second cousin the parliamentarian Edmund Burke, sharing great grandparents on his mother's side. Like Burke, he was a practicing Anglican, though accused at various times in his life of being a crypto Catholic.) Cunningham chose the site for his new home because he appreciated the natural scenery, a feature which later caused George Washington to select the area for the national capital. Nine years after the construction of Quincy House, on July 16, 1790, Congress created the District of Columbia, with the house becoming part of the new entity of the County of Washington. (In 1871 Congress passed legislation uniting the District under an eleven-member legislature, which included two representatives of the County of Washington. In 1878 the County of Washington ceased to exist as a result of the District of Columbia Organic Act.) Among the friends of Cunningham who visited him at the original Quincy House were William Short (1759–1849), a classmate from William & Mary and a fellow Phi Beta Kappa, who stopped by in 1786 before leaving with Thomas Jefferson for Paris, acting as Jefferson's personal secretary while the future president served as ambassador. Short would return to visit Cunningham again in 1793 when he was back in the States between his ambassadorships to France (1790–1792) and Spain (1794–1795), though it was his third visit was probably the most important. In 1796 Short enthusiastically told Cunningham about the man he had spent time with in Europe, John Quincy Adams, then serving as US minister to the Netherlands. (At the time, John Quincy's father, John Adams, was serving as Vice President to George Washington.) For years Cunningham had been toying with different names for the House, without settling upon one he liked, but on December 5, 1796, the 20th anniversary of the founding of his old college society, Jeremiah Cunningham christened his home the Quincy House. Jeremiah Cunningham was not only a man of letters but also an amateur whiskey distiller. To satisfy his interest in both, the builder of Quincy House constructed an extensive basement which housed the better part of his (growing) collection of scholarly works, his distillation equipment and several rooms for aging casks of Scotch whisky. This honeycomb of various tunnels and chambers played a crucial role in the life of the second Quincy House. As the new American capital grew, Cunningham established relationship with men of similar tastes: learned gentlemen with interests in moral and civic matters. Among them were two men who went on to importance in the War of 1812, Dr. William Thornton and Lt. Col. Franklin Wharton. Thornton, whose design was chosen for the Capitol building in 1793, was named first Superintend of Patents in 1802. When British forces attacked Washington in August, 1814, in retaliation for the burning of York (today Toronto), Dr. Thornton convinced them to spare the Patent Office, pleading that the loss of the knowledge it contained would be a loss for all mankind. Franklin Wharton became the third Commandant of the US Marine Corps in 1804 and when the British were busy burning the White House, Capitol and Treasury building, his home at the Marine Barracks was spared, according to Marine Corps lore as an act of respect for the brave rearguard action fought by the Marines at the Battle of Bladensburg earlier in the day. In 1835 a neighbor of note moved into the area, Jehiel Brooks, who had just returned from negotiating a treaty with the Caddo Indians of Louisiana. On a plot of land belonging to his wife, Ann Margaret Queen, Brooks built a Greek revival mansion and the Bellair Estate came to life. Jeremiah Cunningham of Quincy House befriended the Brooks family and the two men would often stay up late at night drinking Cunningham's scotch and discussing the numerous essays Brooks was known to write. The first Quincy House was burned to the ground by an anti-Catholic Know Nothing mob in 1844. The mob, apparently inspired by the Nativist Riots in nearby Philadelphia, attacked Cunningham's house, believing he was a closet Catholic. To this day, the record on that point remains obscure. Cunningham was known to be friends with several of the Catholic bishops of Baltimore, including and the Jesuits John Carroll and Leonard Neale and bishop Samuel Eccleston. However, Cunningham was never known to have officially entered the Catholic Church and remained a practicing Anglican his entire life. (It is worth noting that, in addition to his friendships with a number of Catholic bishops, Cunningham was a known friend of several of the Anglican bishops of Maryland, including James Kemp and William Murray Stone.) In any event, Jeremiah Cunningham, at the advanced age of 88 when his beloved Quincy House was burned, never really recovered from the event. He sold the property to James Baer (a Pennsylvania Catholic, which did nothing to dispel the rumors about Cunningham's faith) and died a year later. All that Baer inherited of the original building was the basement; luckily, much of the distilling equipment, many of the scholarly texts and several casks of Scotch survived the fire. The Second Quincy House In 1845 James Baer built a new house on the site of Cunningham’s Quincy House, incorporating the remains of the basement into the new building. Though Baer himself was neither brewer nor distiller, he paid to have Cunningham’s distillation equipment refurbished and had his brother Thomas, a Pennsylvania brewer, install a small brewery on the back of the house. James, himself a book merchant, never personally operated either set of equipment, but made sure the complement of house servants always included a few men who could both brew and distill, providing an added source of income. Likewise, those portions of Cunningham’s library which had survived the fire were sold with the property to Baer. It is unknown, however, whether he retained the books for himself or sold them off at his business. Perhaps because of these legacies, Baer retained the name Quincy House for his new structure.Life in the County: Being an Account of the Baer, Middletown, McCeeney and Queen Dynasties of North East Washington County, from the Election of John Tyler, through the County's Abolition to the Election of W. H. Taft (Maginnis Press, 1914), 21. The American Civil War broke out in 1861. To provide for the defense of Washington City, a series of forts was erected, encircling the city. Roughly 100 yards from the Quincy House was Fort Bunker Hill, a rectangular emplacement with thirteen guns.National Park Service, Civil War Defenses of Washington, Fort Bunker Hill. Ft. Bunker Hill saw no action during the war, but its proximity to the Quincy House was significant when the young Miss Emily Sawyer, daughter of an officer from the 11th Vermont Volunteer Infantry, came to visit her father, stationed at Ft. Bunker Hill. Lt. Colman O'Higgins may have been staying at the Quincy House at the time. In any event, his daughter and James Baer rapidly struck up a courtship which soon resulted in their marriage.Thomas Painter, Cold Winter Nights: Farming in Addison County (Middlebury: Vergennes Press, 1907), 38. There are reports that Baer had been involved in the operations of the Underground Railroad prior to the Civil War, though these stories may result from a confusion about the arrival of run-away slaves at the forts around WashingtonNational Park Service, Civil War Defense of Washington, Living Contraband - Former Slaves in the Nation's Capital During the Civil War and Baer’s employment with the Freedman’s Bureau from 1865 until 1867.Life in the County, 64-5. Colman O'Higgins - whose grandfather had been a cousin of the legendary Bernardo O'Higgins - was a dairy farmer and cheese maker in civilian life. When he died in 1877, the family farm, located near Middlebury, passed to his only child, Emily Baer née O'Higgins. Though remaining in the District of Columbia, the Baers chose not to sell the dairy farm, but continued to operate it through a manager, and began selling the occasional cheese - along with beer and whiskey - at the bookstore outside Washington.Painter, 42. This happy arrangement lasted until the death of James Baer in 1880, at the age of 61. Emily, a quarter century his junior and with young children still at home, chose to remarry, wedding Hans von Eisenwaller (born 1844), the son of Austrian revolutionary Johann von Eisenwaller, who had participated in the failed revolution of 1848 and fought with the Illinois 1st Hecker Jaeger Regiment during the Civil War.Scheffield, Brookland Gentry, 189. (The elder O'Higgins and von Eisenwaller may have met at some time during the war, though their units fought in different theaters, making this unlikely.) Eisenwaller took up the operation of Baer's bookstore cum liquor store, though the dairy farm was finally sold off a few years later.Painter, 69. In spite of his father's radical politics, Hans von Eisenwaller was of more moderate bent and a devout Catholic. As Catholic bishop John Lancaster Spalding was working to establish the Catholic University of America, von Eisenwaller provided what financial assistance he could (though it was considerably less than such Catholic greats as Mary Gwendoline Caldwell were giving). In 1898 he provided funds to the Franciscans then establishing the Memorial Church of the Holy Sepulchre a few hundred yards east of his house. However, it seems that von Eisenwaller's fortunes were declining at this time, since when the Dominican House of Studies was established in 1905, von Eisenwaller this time simply donated a significant portion of his stock of books, providing an early boost to the Dominican library.Scheffield Brookland Gentry, 195-8. In 1907 Emily O'Higgins Baer von Eisenwaller was killed in a carriage accident, at the age of 63. Her husband was devastated, dying more or less of grief the following year. By this time even the youngest children had all left home and the Washington area. The house was abandoned for several years, falling into a state of disrepair, and for a time being frequented by vagrants and troublesome youths. In 1913 it was finally sold by the children to a real estate agent and demolished.Life in the County, 203. Third Quincy House According to the publicly available records of the District of Columbia tax assessor's office,District of Columbia, Taxpayer Services, https://www.taxpayerservicecenter.com/RP_Search.jsp?search_type=Sales the current Quincy House was built in 1915, as a single family residence.

Retrieved on February 9, 2015. \\"Av. del Libertador 2170, San Fernando (1646), Buenos Aires, Argentina.\\" BAICA is a member of the Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI), and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). There are more than 20 nationalities represented within the student body whose families represent the diplomatic, missionary, international business and local communities. BAICA provides a Christian education and offers small class sizes. It is open to children of any faith. The curriculum is based on an international system of education. In addition to the core subjects of Math, English, Social Studies and Science, courses in Spanish, Bible, Fine Arts, Computer Studies and Physical Education are part of the curriculum. BAICA also offers Advanced Placement (AP) classes, and Honors classes. Most of the classes are taught in English by certified American teachers. Students also take part in extracurricular activities such as violin, guitar, singing, drama, musicals, journalism, outreach teams and service clubs. Students of BAICA graduate with dual degrees: U.S. and Argentine. The academic goal of BAICA is that graduates will be prepared to enter U.S. or other western Universities and Colleges. The daily schedule is from 8:30 am to 4:00 pm and the school year is divided in two semesters: August to December and February to June. It is unusual in comparison with Argentine schools because BAICA's school year starts in August, in keeping with a more US or international based calendar, whereas the Argentine school year begins in February.http://www.ediplomat.com/np/post_reports/pr_ar.htm History In the spring of 1997, the concept of developing an international Christian school in Buenos Aires grew out of the desires of local expatriate parents who were concerned about the content of their children's education. A group of parents began to pursue starting an international Christian school through NICS, which also shared the vision of opening a school in Buenos Aires. In February 1998 Buenos Aires International Christian Academy opened its doors with 17 students. The student body of BAICA is predominantly composed of children who have spent a period of their lives in cultures other than their passport country. These children are missionaries' kids, children of embassy staff, children of military personnel or children of international business people. The Office of Overseas Schools at the U.S. State Department approved the school for U.S. Embassy families.http://www.ediplomat.com/np/post_reports/pr_ar.htm As the number of students grew, BAICA opened its doors to the local community. The Argentine government mandated that BAICA become officially accredited. The Board of Directors decided to continue BAICA as an official Argentine school while continuing with its primary mission. BAICA continues to serve the international English speaking community and those Argentines who may wish to study in the States or abroad. Besides allowing BAICA to continue, the Argentine accreditation permits BAICA to open its doors to more embassies and international businesses. BAICA became a member of the Association of Christian Schools International (ACSI) and the Southern Baptist Association of Christian Schools (SBACS), and grew to its current enrollment, which at the end of the 2009-10 school year was over 150 students.

It is also known as Orthosiphon aristatus. The plant can be identified by its white or purple flowers bearing long, protruding stamens that resemble cats' whiskers. It is also commonly referred as \\"Misai Kucing\\" (Malaysian) or \\"Kumis Kucing\\"(Indonesian) which means cat whiskers. The herb is popularly known as Java tea and is used widely in the form of herbal tea in Asia. Java tea was possibly introduced to the West in the early 20th century. The brewing of Java tea is similar to that for other teas. It is soaked in hot boiling water for about three minutes, and honey or milk is then added. It can be easily prepared as garden tea from the dried leaves. There are quite a number of commercial products derived from Orthosiphon stamineus. Cultivation areas and post-harvesting method can significantly affect the quality of the herb. Phytochemicals isolated from the herb include terpenes, flavonoids, caffeic acid derivatives and essential oils. Sinensetin is a polyphenol found in O. stamineus. Extensive pharmacological investigations on various aqueous and non-aqueous extractives of O. stamineus were carried out to characterize its therapeutic potentials and benefits. Such evidence-based studies revealed that O. stamineus possesses several activities, which are attributed to its phytochemical content. It was found that O. stamineus exhibits diuretic, hypouricemic, renal protective, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, gastroprotective, anti-hypertensive, anti-diabetic, anti- hyperlipidemic, anti-microbial, and anorexic activities.It has been investigated in relation to osteoarthritis.

Education Beesley was educated at Derby School, where he was a scholar, and afterwards at Caius College, Cambridge, again as a scholar. He took a First Class degree in the Natural Science tripos in 1903. Career Beginning as a schoolmaster at Wirksworth Grammar School, he moved to Dulwich College, where he was a science master. In 1957 he was still teaching as Principal of the Northwood School of Coaching, Northwood, Middlesex. RMS Titanic One of the survivors of the sinking of in April 1912, Beesley wrote a successful book about his experience, The Loss of the SS Titanic (June 1912), published just nine weeks after the disaster. He saw two second class women who tried to get on a lifeboat being instructed to go back to their own deck, and that their lifeboats were waiting there. As Lifeboat No. 13 was being launched on the Boat Deck, no women or children were in immediate sight, but it seemed there was room for more. As a result, Beesley was instructed to jump into the lifeboat just before it launched. He managed to survive a subsequent incident where Lifeboat No. 15 nearly landed on top of No. 13. The leading stoker of boiler room No.6, Fred Barrett, managed to cut the ropes connecting the boat to the falls at the last minute, and those in both boats emerged unharmed. Beesley and the rest of the survivors were picked up by in the early morning of 15 April. During the filming of A Night to Remember in 1958, Beesley famously gatecrashed the set during the sinking scene, hoping to 'go down with the ship'. But he was spotted by the director, Roy Ward Baker, who vetoed this unscheduled appearance due to actors' union rules. These events are parodied in Julian Barnes' novel A History of the World in 10.5 Chapters, where Beesley makes a brief appearance as a fictional character. Beesley was portrayed by actor David Warner (who later played fictional character Spicer Lovejoy in James Cameron's 1997 Titanic film) in the 1979 dramatisation of the voyage and sinking, S.O.S. Titanic. He is the grandfather of New York Times science editor Nicholas Wade. Beesley was also portrayed by Lawrence Bennett in 1999 musical stage adaptation Titanic.

Appointed his naval governor in 1879 was Fregattenkapitän (later admiral) Hermann von Spaun, who accompanied him on a voyage to Brazil and North America in the goelette Saida. In 1896 he retired from active duty. He continued, however, to be advanced in rank, attaining the rank of admiral in 1901 and Grossadmiral (grand admiral) in 1911.Lawrence Sondhaus, The Naval Policy of Austria-Hungary, 1867–1918: Navalism, Industrial Development, and the Politics of Dualism (West Lafayette, Ind.: Purdue University Press, 1994), 135–136. He was named Marineinspekteur (navy inspector), making him the titular ranking officer of the navy. Others, however, had effective control of operations in 1914–1918; Anton Haus, Maximilian Njegovan and Miklós Horthy each served in turn as Flottenkommandant (Fleet Commander). In 1918 the Emperor Charles I put him in charge of the enquiry into the mutiny of the navy at Cattaro (now Kotor in Montenegro). Charles Stephen recommended a sweeping re-organisation of the navy and the appointment of Miklós Horthy as commander-in-chief.Sondhaus, 325–326. Charles Stephen was an officer à la suite of the Imperial German Navy and proprietary head of the 8th Austrian Infantry Regiment. His brother, Feldmarschall Archduke Friedrich, was commander-in-chief of the Austro-Hungarian Army from July 1914 to February 1917, and his eldest son, Archduke Karl Albrecht, held the rank of Oberst (colonel) at the end of World War I. Candidate for Polish crown On 5 November 1916 the German Emperor William II and the Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria issued the 'Act of 5 November' creating the Kingdom of Poland as an independent State with a hereditary monarchy. Charles Stephen was considered as a candidate to be regent and eventually king.\\"Will Crown Archduke as King of Poland\\", The New York Times ( 16 August 1915): 1; Catherine Radziwill, The Austrian Court from Within (London: Cassell, 1916), 161; \\"Archduke Charles to Govern Poland\\", The New York Times ( 14 December 1916): 6; \\"Imperial And Foreign News Items\\", The Times ( 17 May 1917): 5; \\"The Meeting Of The Reichsrath\\", The Times ( 31 May 1917): 5. At the time Charles Stephen was living at the Castle of Saysbusch (Żywiec), in Galicia. His chances were enhanced by the fact that he spoke fluent Polish. Two of his daughters were married to Polish princes belonging to the noble houses of Radziwill and Czartoryski. However, as Charles Stephen was a member of the Imperial House of Austria he needed permission to become king from the head of the family, Emperor Charles I, who hesitated, having himself planned to assume the Polish crown. Moreover, the Radziwill and Czartoryski families urged the cause of Russia (as their ancestors had in the 18th century). Adding to the political muddle was the support of Ukrainian nationalism by Charles Stephen's son, Archduke Wilhelm. In the end, the proclamation was so vague and tentative that it failed to inspire enthusiasm among its supposed beneficiaries or even among the Germans and Austro-Hungarians themselves. Yachting In addition to his professional career as a naval officer, Charles Stephen took an active interest in yachting. He was a flag officer of the Imperial and Royal Yacht Squadron.\\"The Pola Regatta\\", The Times ( 12 April 1895): 8.

He purchased several British yachts including the Valkyrie from the Earl of Dunraven in 1892 \\"Court Circular\\", The Times ( 29 April 1892): 9. and the Ul from Ramage and Ferguson Limited in 1911.\\"Launch of a Royal Yacht\\", The Times ( 31 May 1911): 12; \\"\\"Imperial Steam Yacht\\", The Times ( 26 July 1911): 24. His yacht Waturus was sold to Randal Morgan, an American, in June 1902,As reported in the New York Times on June 8, 1902 and eventually it had a long marine career in both military and civilian service as HMCS Hochelaga. Estates When Charles Stephen's uncle Archduke Albert, Duke of Teschen died in 1895, he and his brothers each inherited large estates. His largest properties were in Galicia especially at Saybusch (now Żywiec in Poland). Among the businesses operated here was the Żywiec Brewery which was nationalized by the Communists after World War II. Charles Stephen had a palace at Pola (now Pula in Croatia) and a winter palace in Lussin (now Lošinj). He also had a palace in Vienna in the Wiedner Hauptstrasse.Nellie Ryan, My Years at the Austrian Court (London: J. Lane, 1915), 76–77. Honours Charles Stephen received the following decorations and awards:Hof- und Staatshandbuch der Österreichisch-Ungarischen Monarchie (1918), Genealogy pp. 12-13Marquis of Ruvigny, The Titled Nobility of Europe (Harrison and Sons, London, 1914) pp. 14-15 In 1916 he was named Protector of the Polish Academy of Learning in Krakow.\\"Three Archdukes Removed\\", The New York Times ( 22 September 1916): 3 He was a Großadmiral (Grand Admiral) in the Austro- Hungarian Navy, equivalent to the rank of Feldmarschall (Field Marshal) in the army.Justus Perthes, Almanach de Gotha (1921) page 8 Later life After 1918 Charles Stephen acquired Polish citizenship and continued to live in Żywiec, which had passed to the sovereignty of the Republic of Poland.

It was destroyed by troops from Strasbourg and Haguenau in 1423, and again during the German Peasants' War in 1525. The semi-troglodytic castle is built on a sandstone table, separated from the crest of the hill by a ditch dug into the bare rock. The castle was built with six floors and allowed surveillance of the access roads towards Lorraine. It was certainly altered in the 15th century.  Visible remains  * Remains of the old wall closing the lower courtyard. * The surrounding wall of large dressed stones. * The cistern cut into the sandstone and its water collection system. * Of the lower courtyard, only fragments of walls and a cistern remain. * The western platform has kept some remains as well as a room cut out of the rock. * The manor house, at the eastern end of the summit, has kept its north wall of dressed stones up to three levels.

Part of the middle Lehigh Valley, Nesquehoning Creek terminates below Nesquehoning between two important railroad transfer yards, and falls from its source springs to the west between Broad Mountain and Nesquehoning Mountain. Nesquehoning Creek is an east flowing tributary of the Lehigh River in northeastern Pennsylvania in the United States.Gertler, Edward. Keystone Canoeing, Seneca Press, 2004. Nesquehoning Creek joins the Lehigh River 2 miles (3.2 km) upstream of the borough of Jim Thorpe in Carbon County. Name Nesquehoning is a name derived from a Native American language purported to mean \\"at the black lick\\". Course and history Nesquehoning Creek rises along the slopes of Nesquehoning Ridge and Broad Mountain and flows through two man-made lakes in its descent through a generally steep sided gully bottomed V-shaped valley. Along most of its run the stream hugs Broad Mountain which contributes tributary waters and digs it deeper below the navigable floor of the valley. Nesquehoning Creek encompasses a sq-mi drainage area between Broad Mountain to the northwest and the north along the left bank of its generally eastern course and Nesquehoning Mountain to the south. It rises in the peaks flanking join of the two ridgelines in a saddle at Hometown, PA and terminates in the Lehigh River about two miles below the town of Nesquehoning, Pennsylvania in the shadow of Mount Pisgah from which several minor unnamed tributary streams descend adding their waters. All the mountains in the area are among a series of near parallel ridgelines in the region. Approximately of the drainage basin or watershed is located in Schuylkill County while is located in Carbon County. Nesquehoning Creek originates in two forested gullies diametrically opposed N-to-S along the east edge of Hometown, the major fork on the slopes of Broad Mountain to the north and the minor to the south on the last minor peak of Nesquehoning Ridge. From their confluence the creek flows south for about then turns to the northeast and flows into and through Greenwood Lake, which is nearly a mile long.by inspection using scale on maps.google.com Approximately downstream from the spillway, it discharges into Lake Hauto, both lakes being man-made. It then continues to the northeast in a relatively narrow valley over its steepest stretch then flattens out and slows making its way through Nesquehoning, which is a right bank town. The stream then travels down a narrow undeveloped ladder or rapids section where its elevation drops significantly to its confluence with the Lehigh River opposite and downstream from the Lehigh River Gorge around the bend from Jim Thorpe, PA formed by the roots of Mount Pisgah. Six left bank tributaries enter the stream below Hauto Dam from State Game Lands No. 141 before and west of the summit on Broad Mountain, the uppermost named 'Broad Run', the lower 'Deep Run' being the largest and named, the other four being short and relatively insignificant rills. The heavily forested, relatively steep slopes of Broad and Nesquehoning Mountains and the occasional culm piles characterize the land within the watershed. All travel is channeled in the area by the terrain, so north-south oriented highways are rare and need a saddle pass such as at the streams headwater area for such to cross the valleys. Consequently, Hometown, a small high-elevation outlier of Tamaqua sits in such a pass astride the junction of PA-54 and U.S. Route 309 and contains railroad switch junctions as well that connect trackage to the Wyoming Valley, points south and the Panther Creek Valley via Tamaqua of the Blue Mountain and points west through the Mahanoy Creek valley. The Nesquehoning Creek valley consists of some residential and industrial development, including a power plant, but was primarily a transit corridor. The Hauto Dam constructed opposite the north entrance of the mile-long Hauto Railway Tunnel protected a railroad switching yard for the coal trains servicing the mines in Lansford and Coaldale inside the Panther Creek valley on the opposite side of Nesquehoning Mountain. Nesquehoning Junction is a namedUSGS topo map, misc. web photos. small railyard downstream and within the town of that name along the lower creek. Right bank urban development is concentrated in the Borough of Nesquehoning, left bank development in New Columbus opposite Nesquehoning and at the source region in Hometown. Large areas in the valley have been dramatically disturbed by coal mining related activities. Much of the runoff from strip mines is retained in abandoned pits and therefore lesser amounts of surface runoff is discharged into Nesquehoning Creek. The middle two lesser tributary rills noted previously join in one such containment pond in an old Broad Mountain strip mine just above Nesquehoning. The use of the former Lehigh Valley Railroad, Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ) and route PA-54 marks the importance of the creeks' valley as an important transportation corridor in an area where road beds are highly constricted. The trackage today is used by both the Reading, Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad and Norfolk Southern. The watershed encompasses four municipalities. U.S. Route 209 climbs up inside the V-shaped gully of the westernmost of these from the beginning terminus junction with PA-54 within downtown Nesquehoning up over the ridge to the headwaters region of the Panther Creek Valley across the Nesquehoning Ridge drainage divide into the valley formed with Pisgah Ridge. Part of the waters are pooled in Lake Hauto above the Hauto Dam in the Hamlet of Hauto, near where the historically important Hauto Tunnel serviced the many coal breakers of Lansford, Coaldale, and historic Summit Hill. The Lehigh Valley Railroad and the Central Railroad of Pennsylvania (CNJ), both Class I railroads ran trackage up slope to cross north and west over the mountain ridges.

This modern construct stems from Canada's system of constitutional monarchy, and through its 500 years of monarchical history. The role of the Canadian sovereign within the Canadian Armed Forces is established within the Canadian constitution, the National Defence Act, and the Queen's Regulations and Orders (QR&Os;) for the Canadian Forces. This relationship is symbolically represented today through royal symbols such as crowns on military badges and insignia, coats of arms, royal portraits, and the grant of the royal prefix to various military units and institutions. Role in command The emblem of the Canadian Forces topped by a St. Edward's Crown to indicate from where the military's authority stems. The role of the Canadian Crown in the Canadian Armed Forces is established through both constitutional and statutory law. The Constitution Act, 1867 declares that Command-in-Chief of those forces is \\"to continue and be vested in the Queen\\", and the National Defence Act states that \\"the Canadian Forces are the armed forces of Her Majesty raised by Canada\\". As the sovereign's representative, the Governor General of Canada carries out the duties and bears the title of Commander-in- Chief on the monarch's behalf. Since Canadian Confederation, three members of the Royal Family (apart from the sovereign) have been titled as Commander-in- Chief: the Duke of Argyll (1871–1883), Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn (1911–1916), and the Earl of Athlone (1940–1946). Formally, there is a direct chain of command from the Queen of Canada to the governor general, through the Chief of the Defence Staff to all of the officers who hold the Queen's Commission, and through them, to all members of the Canadian Forces. No other person, including the prime minister, cabinet ministers, nor public servants is part of the chain of command; nor does any other person have any command authority in the Canadian Forces, an arrangement maintained to ensure that \\"the military is an agent for and not a master of the state.\\" As such, all new recruits into the Canadian Forces are required to recite the Oath of Allegiance to the monarch and his or her heirs and successors. According to the National Defence Act, the use of traitorous or disloyal words towards the reigning king or queen is a service offence and may be punishable by up to seven years imprisonment. Declarations of war, the mobilisation of troops, and the organisation of the forces all fall within the Royal Prerogative; direct parliamentary approval is not necessary for such, though the Cabinet may seek it nonetheless and the Crown-in-Parliament is responsible for allocating moneys necessary to fund the military. The monarch issues letters patent, known as the Queen's Commission, to commissioned officers in the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Navy, and the Royal Canadian Air Force. Further, all regulations for the Canadian Forces are set out by the sovereign in the Queen's Regulations and Orders. Neither the monarch nor the viceroy, however, involve themselves in direct military command; per constitutional convention, both must almost always exercise the Royal Prerogative on the advice of the Cabinet, although the right to unilaterally use those powers in crisis situations is maintained. Symbolism and traditions The Canadian Forces have derived many of their traditions and symbols from the British army, navy, and air force, including those with royal elements. Contemporary icons and rituals, however, have evolved to include elements reflective of Canada and the Canadian monarchy. Members of the country's Royal Family also continue their two century old practice of maintaining personal relationships with the Canadian Forces as well as individual units, around which the military has developed complex protocols. Ceremonies and protocols Members of the Canadian Grenadier Guards performing public duties at Rideau Hall. The Guards are one of three units that comprise the Household Division for Canada. Many ceremonies and rituals of the Canadian Forces have a royal connection. For example, the military traditionally mounts what is known as the Queen's Guard (or King's Guard during the reign of a male monarch), which is made up of contingents of infantry and cavalry soldiers who are charged with guarding the royal residences in Canada and the United Kingdom. Canada has mounted the King's/Queen's Guard eight times since 1916, including Canadian Coronation Contingents for King George VI in May 1937 and for Queen Elizabeth II in May 1953. Also, whenever the sovereign or a member of her family is in Ottawa, they will lay a wreath at the National War Memorial (which itself was dedicated in 1939 by King George VI) and will do the same if at a Canadian war monument overseas. Three military units comprise the Household Division, symbolically charged specifically with protecting the monarch and governor general: the Governor General's Horse Guards, the Governor General's Foot Guards, and the Canadian Grenadier Guards. Members of the Royal Family will also be present for other military ceremonies besides those related to any honorary ranks they hold, including inspections of the troops and anniversaries of key battles and victories, such as commemorations of D-Day. For such events, an order of precedence is followed for organising participants and according respect and honours. The official Canadian order of precedence is the only one used in relation to the military, in which the monarch takes first place, followed by the governor general, and then other members of the Royal Family. The provincial viceroys fall in at sixteenth on the list, behind the leader of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition. The Royal Anthem of Canada, \\"God Save the Queen,\\" is normally played, as may be the Viceregal Salute for the governor general or lieutenant governor, if either is representing the sovereign. A Loyal Toast may also be given; it is required at all formal mess dinners and toasts the health of the monarch. Canadian Forces members and officers are required to stand during the toast and to salute any time the Royal Anthem is played. This stipulation was challenged in 2008 by an officer of Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry and upheld by the Canadian Forces Grievance Board, the Chief of the Defence Staff, and the Federal Court of Canada. Visual markers King George VI presents the King's Colours to the Royal Canadian Navy at a ceremony in Beacon Hill Park, Victoria, Canada, 1939. Regimental, and King's/Queen's Colours are typically given to regiments and other units of the Canadian Forces. A number of flags and banners are used by the Canadian Forces to signify loyalty, nationality, units, and/or specific events. One used throughout the military is the Royal Union Flag, which was approved by the federal parliament in 1964 for \\"continued use as a symbol of Canada's membership in the Commonwealth of Nations and of her allegiance to the Crown.\\" This flag however, is generally flown only on specified days and whenever instructed by National Defence headquarters. Others symbolise royal and viceroyal figures or royal honours bestowed on a unit or regiment. The finial capping the tip of a flag pole carrying the Queen's Canadian standard, governor general's standard, Queen's Colours, or other royal banners must be in the form of the crest of the Royal Arms of Canada. Unique Regimental Colours and Queen's Colours are presented to various regiments, units, and commands, consisting mostly of national and royal symbols combined; they today act as \\"visible symbols of pride, honour and devotion to Sovereign and country.\\" Colours are thus consecrated objects; it is expected that everyone will rise to attention (if civilian) and salute (if military) upon passing a stand of uncased Colours. Authorization to possess a Queen's Colour may be granted and the Colour presented only by the Queen or the governor general and the Colours must be dipped in the presence of the monarch or other members of the Royal Family. Those in the Royal Family may also present a Royal Banner to a unit to commemorate specific services rendered and as a mark of royal favour. For example, Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians) received a Royal Banner from King Edward VII for their combat in South Africa, and the Queen Mother presented the Canadian Forces Medical Service with a Royal Banner in 1985. These typically include a mark unique to the royal individual, such as a cypher. Other flags that are held by an individual also bear royal symbols. The Queen's Harbourmaster, who is in charge of Her Majesty's Canadian Dockyards, is accorded a flag that consists of a white-bordered national flag defaced in the centre with a white disc bearing a crown and the acronym QHM/CPSM, for Queen's Harbour Master/Capitaine de port de Sa Majesté. Royal 22e Régiment at the Citadelle of Quebec, with a St. Edward's Crown atop. Badges and emblems throughout the Canadian Forces depicts an image of the crown. To signify the sovereign's place at the head of the Canadian Forces, many badges include a crown in their design. Originally designed by the British Kings of Arms, since 1968 they have been created by the Department of National Defence and then the Canadian Heraldic Authority. Each primary badge of a branch, formation, or unit must be approved by the governor general as titular Commander-in-Chief, since the monarch designated approval of new badges to the governor general in the mid-1980s, though permission for use of royal titles and personal symbols such as the Crown must be personally approved by the sovereign. The Queen's Canadian Arms and her Royal Cypher are also displayed throughout the forces, including on banners, badges, and military band instruments. Royal designations Many regiments of the Canadian Army have also been granted the use of the prefix royal in the regiment's name, while others bear the name of a member of the Royal Family. The royal prefix—termed a royal designation—is an honour that demonstrates royal favour for the organisation to whose name the prefix is applied. Its award is an exercise of the Royal Prerogative and it does not expire unless revoked by the Crown-in-Council or the organisation that received the designation ceases to exist. If the name of the regiment should change after the prefix is granted, the word royal may be retained preceding the new name, such as when the Royal Northwest Mounted Police was renamed in 1920 as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Honorary appointments Members of the Royal Family, including the sovereign, take on honorary appointments—known as royal appointments—related to army regiments or air force or navy units; a practice that is thought to have originated with the appointment of Princess Louise, Duchess of Connaught, as Colonel-in-Chief of the 199th Battalion in 1917. The appointment, intended as an honour for regiments and units and to reinforce loyalty to the Crown, is made by the Crown-in-Council (the monarch or the governor general acting on the advice of Cabinet) and the appointee—known as an honorary—acts akin to a patron and holds the role either for life or until voluntarily stepping down or the unit or regiment is disbanded. Positions include colonel-in-chief, captain general, commodore-in-chief, admiral, and others. Requests for a royal honorary are made by the regiment or unit through the chain of command and a holder is indended to be a \\"guardian of Regimental traditions and history, promot[e] the regiment's identity and ethos and [be] an advisor to the Commanding Officer on virtually all issues excluding operations.\\" They will carry out a number of associated duties, such as attending regimental dinners, presenting new colours, trooping the colour, and viewing field training exercises. Attendance and participation in these events may be at the direction of the ministers of the Crown or the regiment itself. As members of the Canadian Forces, royal honoraries may wear forces' uniforms, both dress and operational. Prince Philip with the Royal Canadian Regiment as their colonel-in-chief. Prince Philip holds several ceremonial appointments within the Canadian Armed Forces. In 2011, to mark his 90th birthday, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was appointed to the top ranks in all three branches of the Canadian Forces—General of the Land Force Command (later Canadian Army), General of the Air Command (later Royal Canadian Air Force), and Admiral of the Maritime Command (later Royal Canadian Navy)—making him the first to receive such appointment at the highest level. Though non-royals have been appointed as colonels-in-chief, the practice is rare, and the placement of former Governor General Adrienne Clarkson as Colonel-in-Chief of Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry caused some controversy as a break with tradition. Military-related organisations—institutes, benevolent funds, leagues, associations, messes, etcetera—may also receive the patronage of a person belonging to the Royal Family. As with regiment and unit related appointments, those who act as patron will correspond with organisation leaders, participate in ceremonial events, assist with fundraising, and the like. Applications for royal patronage are made via the Office of the Governor General; to receive the honour, an organization must prove to be long lasting and have aims and objectives that will earn the approval of the person from whom patronage is requested. Infrastructure Buildings, installations, and geographical features related to the Canadian Forces or Department of National Defence can only be named for living or deceased members of the Canadian Royal Family, living or deceased former governors general, and deceased distinguished persons. All Canadian naval ships are designated with the prefix Her Majesty's Canadian Ship (His Majesty's Canadian Ship in the reign of a king), or HMCS (NCSM (Navire canadien de Sa Majesté) in French). These vessels must dress—be decorated with signal flags—for specific royal occasions, including Accession Day (6 February), the actual birthday of the monarch (presently 21 April), the official birthday of the monarch (Monday before 25 May), and the birthday of the royal consort (10 June). Orders, decorations, and medals A medal awarded for participation in repelling the Fenian raids, with the image of Queen Victoria, denoting the monarch's place as fount of honour Military honours available to members of the forces also have a link to the Crown, due foremostly to the fact that the Queen is the fount of honour from which these orders, medals, and decorations come. The Queen's effigy or a St. Edward's Crown thus appear on the insignia of orders or on medals. Some honours and decorations are also granted to civilians, but a few are specifically awarded by the sovereign to her Canadian Forces personnel; these are: the Order of Military Merit; the Victoria Cross (named for its founder, Queen Victoria), Star of Military Valour, and Medal of Military Valour; the military divisions of the Meritorious Service Cross and Meritorious Service Medal; and the war and operational service medals. Further, injury or death in action is recognised by the Sacrifice Medal and Memorial Cross, while acts of bravery or diligence on the battlefield are recognised by field commander reports to the sovereign, known as Mentioned in Despatches. History=Colonies and Confederation As European colonization of the Americas took place, the European explorers regarded some newly contacted indigenous chieftainships as a form of monarchy, wherein warriors were under the command of a hereditary chief. However, though they may have been the holders of power, all chiefs were not necessarily free to mobilise troops without the consent of a council of elders, similar to the situation in a modern constitutional monarchy; for example, in the Cherokee nation, the approval of the council of women was required before war could be declared. During this period, at the end of the 18th into the beginning of the 19th centuries, the local militia were called upon to augment the British sovereign's forces in defending the colonies against attacks—such as those in 1775 and 1812—from the United States, which viewed the nearby monarchical presence as a threat to American republican ideologies. As the colonial population increased, those loyal to the Crown served as regular members of local militia groups under the command of the relevant governor, who exercised the authority of either the French or British monarch. These groups would fight alongside First Nations who had offered their allegiance to the king back in Europe, often in order to wage war on their own enemy tribes who had allied themselves with the other sovereign. Once King Louis XV surrendered his Canadian territories, members of the British Royal Family began to serve in military postings in the colonies; from 1786 to 1887, Prince William Henry (later King William IV) ventured to Canada's east coast as captain of HMS Pegasus in a Royal Navy contingent and his younger brother, Prince Edward with the Star of the Garter, voted to him by the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in 1798. He served as the Commander-in-Chief of the Maritimes during the 1790s. Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, was posted with the British Army to the Canadas, and later Halifax, where he acted as Commander-in-Chief of the Maritimes between 1791 and 1798 and again from 1799 to 1800. During his time in Nova Scotia, he presided over the expansion of Halifax, and improved the city's defences Following the formation of the Canadian federation in 1867, a proper military was established for the new country. This group was joined three years later by Prince Arthur, who became the first royal to fight for Canada, against the Fenians who attempted to invade the country. For his service, the Prince was awarded the Canadian General Service Medal with the Fenian Raid 1870 bar. By 1874, the Royal Military College of Canada was established, with Queen Victoria's consent for the use of the royal prefix granted in 1878. Her grandson, King George V, gave the same permission for the Royal Canadian Navy when it was created in 1911, as did his son, King Edward VII, for the Royal Canadian Air Force six years after it was established in 1918. It was in the new Canadian navy that a young Prince Albert (later King George VI) served as a midshipman for the duration of 1913. The World Wars and between Canada came to be at war when in 1914 King George V declared that the British Empire was at war with its German counterpart. At the time, Canada had in Ottawa a royal viceroy in the form of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn; though well intended, the Prince donned his Field Marshal's uniform and, without ministerial advice, went to military training grounds and barracks to address the troops and see them off on their voyage to Europe. This was much to the chagrin of the prime minister at the time, Robert Borden, who saw the Governor General as overstepping constitutional conventions. Though Borden blamed the military secretary of the day, Edward Stanton, he also opined that Prince Arthur \\"laboured under the handicap of his position as a member of the Royal Family and never realised his limitations as Governor General.\\" Arthur's wife, Princess Louise Margaret, Duchess of Connaught, also helped in the war effort, forming volunteer groups to make supplies for Canadian soldiers overseas; for Christmas in 1915, she sent a card and a box of maple sugar to every Canadian serving in Europe and she had a knitting machine installed at Rideau Hall, on which she made thousands of pairs of socks for soldiers. Princess Patricia, the Connaughts' daughter, became so active with the military that Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry was in 1914 named in her honour; the Princess personally chose the infantry's colours, designed its badge, and was appointed as its colonel-in-chief at the cessation of hostilities in 1918. King George VI dedicates the National War Memorial in Ottawa, 1939, by Margaret Fulton Frame Across the Atlantic, Prince Edward (later King Edward VIII) was serving on the Western Front with the Canadian Expeditionary Corps, his participation in the fighting establishing a popularity among veterans during the Prince's latter tours of Canada as Prince of Wales. By 1936, Edward, as king, had taken up ceremonial military tasks and became the first Canadian sovereign to do so solely on behalf of Canada when he dedicated the Canadian National Vimy Memorial in France. Following Edward's abdication that same year, his brother acceded to the throne as George VI; for his coronation in the summer of 1937, the Canadian Coronation Contingent was formed and sent to London. Two years later, the King presided over a number of military ceremonies in Canada, including dedicating the National War Memorial in Ottawa and presenting colours to regiments. By the end of that summer, however, the King had declared war on Nazi Germany; unlike his father, George did this uniquely as king of Canada—on the advice of the Canadian Cabinet with the approval of the Parliament of Canada—a week after he had done so as King of the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, the Royal Family was active in relation to Canada's troops; Queen Elizabeth, for instance, inspected the 1st Battalion of the Saskatoon Light Infantry in April 1940 and, the following year, presented the unit with gifts of socks, mittens, caps, pullovers, scarves, and helmets, as well as the unit's Colours in October. Her daughter, Princess Elizabeth (now Queen Elizabeth II), also undertook solo duties, such as reviewing a parade of Canadian airwomen in 1945 and interacting with the Canadian regiments to which she had been appointed colonel-in-chief. Other members of the Royal Family performed military duties in Canada during the war: Prince George, Duke of Kent, did so in Manitoba in 1941 and the King's first cousin once removed, Princess Alice, who was then serving as the Canadian viceregal consort to the Governor General, was installed as honorary commandant of a number of women's military services. A new queen and Canadian Forces unification In a time of austerity following the Second World War, the Coronation Contingent was again mounted to participate in the 1953 coronation of Canada's new sovereign, Queen Elizabeth II. Not only did the forces now have a new Commander-in-Chief, but the post-war period saw major shifts in the structure of the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, and Royal Canadian Air Force. By 1968, the unification of all three elements into the unified Canadian Forces took effect at the recommendation of then Defence Minister Paul Hellyer, over the protests of many senior generals, admirals, and air marshals. While the National Defence Act continued to state that \\"[t]he Canadian Forces are the armed forces of Her Majesty raised by Canada,\\" the royal prefix was not bestowed upon the unified Canadian Armed Forces. The uses of Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, and Royal Canadian Air Force were also replaced with Maritime Command, Mobile Command, and Air Force Command, respectively, and a number of royally designated corps were lost into newly reorganized and designated services and branches. Not all the forces' links with the Crown, however, were lost; many of the regiments did retain their royal prefix, members of the Royal Family as their colonel-in-chief, and crowns on their badges and other insignia. As the Canadian Forces came to be deployed mostly on United Nations peacekeeping operations following the Korean War, the role of the royals and viceroys to turned more towards observation and interaction, rather than morale boosting. The Queen, her mother, sister, children, and cousins, as well as governors general, visited with forces personnel either in Canada or abroad, undertook various duties on behalf of the organization, and dedicated armed conflict and military memorials. During this period, Prince Charles, like other Princes of Wales before him, trained with the Canadian Forces at CFB Gagetown in the 1970s and his father's cousin, the Countess Mountbatten of Burma, as Colonel-in-Chief of Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, visited with her troops on more than 45 occasions, at Canadian Forces bases and detachments across the country as well as overseas in Cyprus, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo. Later, in 1996, Queen Elizabeth II inaugurated the Canadian War Memorial in Green Park, London, just outside Buckingham Palace. Beyond the era of peacekeeping With Canada's participation in the invasion of Afghanistan and the casualties of that conflict, the Canadian Forces came more into the public eye than it had been through the previous two decades. Governor General Adrienne Clarkson won wide praise for boosting Canadians' pride in the armed forces, spending Christmasses and New Years with forces personnel in Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf and earning herself a special tribute from the Canadian Forces upon her retirement from the Queen's service in 2005. Members of the Royal Family continued their duties as honoraries, visiting troops in Canada and Afghanistan, as well as attending memorials. Also in 2004 was the 60th anniversary of D-Day, which was commemorated at Juno Beach in the presence of the Queen, Clarkson, and Prince Charles. The Queen then in 2007 attended the 90th anniversary of the Battle of Passchendaele in Belgium and, in April of that year, re-dedicated the Canadian Vimy Memorial on the 90th anniversary of the battle it commemorates, following in the footsteps of her uncle, King Edward VIII. She was there accompanied by her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, who was dressed in the uniform of the Royal Canadian Regiment, which both fought at Vimy Ridge and had just the day previous lost six members during combat operations in Afghanistan. It was reported in June of the same year that Prince Harry, then third in line to the Canadian throne, had arrived in Alberta to train along with other soldiers of the Canadian and British armies at CFB Suffield, before a tour of duty in Afghanistan. Members of the Canadian Grenadier Guards pose at Camp Nathan Smith, Afghanistan, with the regiment's flag, which bears the double mirrored Royal Cypher of King Edward VII, ER, beneath a St. Edward's Crown all within a wreath of maple leaves; 3 February 2008 On 4 November 2008, the Queen launched at Canada House in London Vigil 1914–1918, a coordinated light and media display on the facades of Canada House and buildings in six Canadian cities of the name of each of the approximately 68,000 Canadians who died in World War I; there the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh met with First World War veterans as well as Canadians returned from Afghanistan. Almost one year later, Prince Charles officiated at the Remembrance Day ceremonies at the National War Memorial in Ottawa, there wearing his uniform as a Lieutenant-General of the Canadian Army. The death of the last Canadian veteran of World War I came in 2010 and, on the anniversary of the Battle of Vimy Ridge in April that year, Queen Elizabeth II issued a statement marking the two events, stating: \\"As proud and grateful Canadians, we pause today to mark not only the ninety-third anniversary of this Nation's victory at Vimy Ridge but also to pay tribute to the passing of a truly remarkable generation who helped to end the most terrible conflict the world had ever known.\\" A few months later, on 29 June, the Queen marked the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Royal Canadian Navy by conducting a fleet review at the Bedford Basin; the event was attended by ships of the Canadian Maritime Command, Brazilian Navy, Royal Danish Navy, French Navy, German Navy, Royal Netherlands Navy, Royal Navy and United States Navy. The three environmental commands were in 2011 officially renamed to their traditional designations of the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, and Royal Canadian Air Force. This stemmed from an ongoing drive for the restoration, including an online petition, sponsored by Member of Parliament Laurie Hawn, issued in 2007 seeking grassroots support for the Maritime Command and Air Command to have their former names restored for the navy's 100th anniversary in 2010.

It is a fairly common respiratory event in dogs, but is rarely seen in cats. Its exact cause is unknown but may be due to nasal, pharyngeal, or sinus irritation (such as an allergy), the dog's attempt to remove mucus, or from overexcitement. It is characterized by rapid and repeated forced inhalation through the nose, accompanied by snorting or gagging sounds. Though it may be distressing to the animal, it is not known to be harmful. Most dogs are completely normal before and after episodes, and most will have repeat episodes of reverse sneezing throughout their lives. During a reverse sneeze, the dog will make rapid and long inhalations, stand still, and extend its head and neck. A loud snorting sound is produced. Reverse sneezing also commonly occurs while the dog is asleep or immediately following a long nap. Other dogs may experience it following play, exercise, or meals. It can also happen by breathing in dust, although episodes are typically random. Though smaller dogs seem slightly more susceptible to reverse sneezing, any dog can develop it, regardless of size. Differential diagnoses include tracheal collapse. A common remedy is to pinch the dog's nose and scratch its neck. Lightly blowing in its face may also help. The dog will swallow a couple of times and then stop the reverse sneezing. Additionally, calming the dog down by rubbing its sides or back also helps to end the episode more quickly. While most dogs do not require medication, antihistamines and steroids may help if the problem is serious, chronic, and allergy-related.

There was no indoctrination against the Arabs as a nation, nor a negative presentation of Islam. Islam, Arab culture and the Arabs' contribution to human civilization were presented in a positive light. No book called for violence or war. Many books express the yearning for peace between Israel and the Arab countries.CMIP 2000 report, p. 6 Center for Monitoring the Impact of Peace report In textbooks for state-run schools, there was an effort to remove stereotypes and educate towards tolerance. In some textbooks for the Orthodox Jewish community, the researchers found derogatory adjectives, prejudices, patronizing expressions and disrespect toward Arabs. The Arab leadership was portrayed as motivated by an eternal hatred independent of historical circumstances. In textbooks for every age, Israel's wars are described as justified wars of defense, and the Arabs held responsible for them.CMIP 2000 report, p. 76 The Palestinian exodus is attributed to the fact that the Arabs fled from their homes.

The students are even taught about the Muslims affinity to Jerusalem, although, the focus is on the religious, rather than the political dimension.CMIP 2000 report, p. 7 The CIMP report found that it was only in the ultra-orthodox stream that textbooks contained prejudice, patronizing expressions and disrespect to Arabs.Arabs and Palestinians in Israeli Textbooks, September 2000 Report by Center for Monitoring the Impact of Peace (also available at ), p.10 The report further stated that in textbooks of both the general state-run network and the religious state-run network, there was a genuine effort to remove stereotypes and to build a foundation for coexistence and mutual respect between the two peoples. There are many stories that describe friendships between Jews and Arabs in Islamic countries and in Israel even in times of war. There are stories of Jews helping Arabs in daily life and in war as well as stories of Arabs rescuing Jews from physical harm and helping Jews to maintain their religion and identity. In many literary anthologies there are stories about the daily life of Arabs written by Arab authors. Some stories deal with the tensions created by the transition from a traditional society with its values and customs, to a modern western society. In some books in the ultra-orthodox network relations between Arabs and Jews were portrayed in negative terms. The official list of textbooks referred to is not compulsory, but was an indication of the Ministry of Education's recommendations, as published in a memo signed by the Ministry's Director. ;2001 update CMIP states that no negative changes were noted in the new textbooks with regard to the image of the Arabs, the description of the conflict, the presentation of Islam, questions of war and peace and education to tolerance and conciliation. On the contrary, the positive trends noted in the earlier report were strengthened. The textbooks of the ultra-Orthodox schools continued to use language conveying an air of superiority. Maps of Israel included all the territory between the Mediterranean Sea and the River Jordan. Many textbooks showed maps of the Middle East on which only Israel's name appeared, with the territories of the surrounding Arab countries left blank.2002 Update by CMIP Other studies In his 2004 article \\"The Arab Image in Hebrew School Textbooks\\", Dan Bar-Tal of Tel Aviv University studied 124 textbooks used in Israeli schools. He concluded that generations of Israeli Jews have been taught a negative and often delegitimizing view of Arabs. He claims Arabs are portrayed in these textbooks as primitive, inferior in comparison to Jews, violent, untrustworthy, fanatic, treacherous and aggressive. While history books in the elementary schools hardly mentioned Arabs, the high school textbooks that covered the Arab–Jewish conflict stereotyped Arabs negatively, as intransigent and uncompromising. Nurit Peled-Elhanan, a professor of language and education at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, published Palestine in Israeli School Books: Ideology and Propaganda in Education, an account of her study of the contents of Israeli school books. She asserts that the books promote racism against and negative images of Arabs, and that they prepare young Israelis for their compulsory military service. After examining \\"hundreds and hundreds\\" of books, Peled-Elhanan claims she did not find one photograph that depicted an Arab as a \\"normal person\\". She has stated that the most important finding in the books she studied concerns the historical narrative of events in 1948, the year in which Israel fought a war to establish itself as an independent state. She claims that the killing of Palestinians is depicted as something that was necessary for the survival of the nascent Jewish state. \\"It's not that the massacres are denied, they are represented in Israeli school books as something that in the long run was good for the Jewish state.\\" \\"[T]he Israeli version of events are stated as objective facts, while the Palestinian-Arab versions are stated as possibility, realized in openings such as 'According to the Arab version' ... [or] 'Deir Yassin [sic.] became a myth in the Palestinian narrative ... a horrifying negative image of the Jewish conqueror in the eyes of Israel's Arabs'.Palestine in Israeli School Books, pp. 50–51 With reference to previous studies of Israeli school textbooks, Peled-Elhanan states that, despite some signs of improvement in the 1990s, the more recent books do not ignore, but justify, issues such as the Nakba. For example, in all the books mentioning Deir Yassin, the massacre is justified because: \\"the slaughter of friendly Palestinians brought about the flight of other Palestinians which enabled the establishment of a coherent Jewish state.\\"Palestine in Israeli School Books, p. 178 She also states that contrary to the hope of previous studies \\"for 'the appearance of a new narrative in [Israeli] history textbooks' ... some of the most recent school books (2003–09) regress to the 'first generation' [1950s] accounts — when archival information was less accessible — and are, like them 'replete with bias, prejudice, errors, [and] misrepresentations'\\" (Palestine in Israeli School Books, p. 228). In 2013, it was reported that Israeli science textbook publishers had been instructed to remove details of \\"human reproduction, pregnancy prevention and sexually transmitted diseases from science textbooks used in state religious junior high schools as well as from their teacher manuals\\". Arabic textbooks According to a 2011 report by the Arab Cultural Association, Arabic textbooks provided to third grade to ninth grade students in Israeli schools contained at least 16,255 mistakes. The report was based on a study and examination of textbooks in all subjects by a committee, headed by Dr. Elias Atallah. Association director Dr. Rawda Atallah said the findings were not surprising, since they were similar to the findings of a previous study published in November 2009, which reported that more than 4,000 mistakes in language and syntax were found in textbooks for second grade students in Arab schools. Researchers also spoke about the way in which Arab students' cultural and national identities are covered. For example, while textbooks state that Jews and non-Jews live in the Galilee, the word \\"Arab\\" is never mentioned. Dr. George Mansour, who examined the history textbooks, reported that they ignored the presence of the Arab-Palestinian people in Israel and stressed the Promised Land of the Jewish people: \\"There is a process of de- Palestinization, instilling of the Zionist narrative and minimizing of Arab culture,\\" reported Dr. Mansour. Teaching the Arab-Israeli conflict In general, the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories is hardly mentioned by Israeli textbooks or by high school matriculation examinations, according to a study by Professor Avner Ben-Amos of Tel Aviv University. The lives and perspectives of Palestinians are rarely mentioned, an approach he terms “interpretive denial.” In most Israeli textbooks, “the Jewish control and the Palestinians’ inferior status appear as a natural, self-evident situation that one doesn’t have to think about.\\"Haaretz, 21 June 2020 In Israeli Textbooks, the Palestinians Are All but Invisible: A Study by Avner Ben-Amos of Tel Aviv University Shows that the Occupation is Rarely Mentioned in History, Civics or Geography Textbooks According to the Ben-Amos study, one of the main civics textbooks used in Israeli high schools fails to address at all the limited rights of the millions of Palestinians living in the West Bank under Israeli military occupation. The more general issue of the occupation was addressed in a previous edition of this textbook but the Israeli debate regarding the occupation was shrunk to a few sentences in the most recent edition under right-wing education ministers. Another Israeli civics textbook completely omits discussion of the dispute over the occupied territories. In civics high school matriculation tests over the past 20 years, no question appeared on the limiting of the Palestinians’ rights. The geography matriculation exams ignore the Green Line and the Palestinians.Haaretz, 21 June 2020 In Israeli Textbooks, the Palestinians Are All but Invisible: A Study by Avner Ben-Amos of Tel Aviv University Shows that the Occupation is Rarely Mentioned in History, Civics or Geography Textbooks Nakba terminology Israel has ordered the word Nakba to be removed from Israeli Arab textbooks. The term was introduced in books for use in Arab schools in 2007 when the Education Ministry was run by Yuli Tamir of the Labour party. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu justified the ban by saying that the term was \\"propaganda against Israel\\". The book \\"Nationalism: Building a State in the Middle East,\\" published by the Zalman Shazar Center, was approved for 11th and 12th classrooms by Israel's Ministry of Education and distributed to shops throughout the country for use in high schools. However, the Minister of Education instructed that the contents of the book be reexamined. The Ministry of Education took the unusual step of removing the book from the shelves and then redacted it. Among other changes, term \\"ethnic cleansing\\" in relation to the Nakba was removed and now refers instead to an organized policy of expulsion by the pre-state Jewish militia.Haaretz, 19 Oct. 2009 Israel Pulls Textbook With Chapter on Nakba  See also  * Institute for Monitoring Peace and Cultural Tolerance in School Education * Textbooks in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict * Saudi textbooks * Anti-Arabism in Israel * Education in Israel ReferencesExternal links *How Israel teaches its children to hate, July 26, 2019, Middle East Monitor Category:Textbook controversies Category:Education in Israel Category:Textbooks in the Middle East Category:Education issues ","title":"Textbooks in Israel"},{"id":"10105696","text":"Gossypium australe is an endemic woody shrub, related to cotton, found in north western Australia.

Sedona, Healing Society. Although actual practices resemble yoga, martial arts, meditation, and other recognizable Eastern disciplines, they have been modified with the said intent of uncovering the practitioner's natural brain potential.Ilchi Lee. (2004) Dahnhak Kigong. Sedona, Healing Society. Lee's Power Brain Kids book describes that these practices may also be combined with other games and activities intended to develop mind-body connection and mental acuity. Collectively, the techniques have been termed Brain Education (formerly known as Brain Respiration or Brain Education System Training (BEST)).Ilchi Lee. (2007) Principles of Brain Management. Sedona, BEST Life Media. Lee categorizes all of his training techniques under one or more of the five sequential steps that comprise Brain Education. The focus of each step is as follows: # Brain Sensitizing: Stress management, awakening of the five senses, physical health, and brain awareness. # Brain Versatilizing: Enhanced learning ability through the creation of new synaptic connections. # Brain Refreshing: Emotional release, emotional control, and positive mental outlook. # Brain Integrating: Developing latent brain abilities and increasing communication between diverse parts of the brain. # Brain Mastering: Improved decision making and developing a clear sense of life purpose. Lee teaches that while the brain is the primary focus of his training methods, the health of the physical body as a whole is of primary concern in the initial phase of training (Brain Sensitizing). Exercises and practices followed during this phase are heavily influenced by the notion of ki energy as it is understood in Traditional Korean medicine.Ilchi Lee.

Taxonomy  The parasite was first described by Lainson et al. in 2001.Lainson R, Landau I, Paperna I. (2001) Plasmodium kentropyxi n.sp. (Apicomplexa: Haemosporina: Plasmodiidae) and a Plasmodium tropiduri-like parasite in the lizard Kentropyx calcarata (Lacertilia: Teiidae) in north Brazil. Parasite 8(2):107-113  Description  Young asexual stages are initially polar in the erythrocyte but with maturation, move to a lateral position. The larger meronts may slightly enlarge the erythrocyte but most asexual stages do not. Conspicuous greenish-black pigment granules are located in a distinct vacuole. The largest schizonts contain 30-40 nuclei. The gametocytes are at first polar in the erythrocyte but gradually move to a lateral position. They eventually assume a smooth, curved cylindrical shape with evenly rounded ends. Pigment is scattered or concentrated around a conspicuous vacuole which is slowly developed as the gametocytes mature. The mature gametocytes occasionally enlarge the erythrocyte. Mature male parasites measured 11.8 x 4.0 micrometres (range: 9.6 x 4.2 - 13.2 x 3.6 micrometres) and females 13.5 x 4.5 micrometres (range: 12.0 x 4.5 - 15.0 x 4.8 micrometres).  Hosts  Like all Plasmodium species P. kentropyxi has both vertebrate and insect hosts. The vertebrate hosts for this parasite are reptiles. The only known vertebrate host is the teiid lizard Kentropyx calcarata.  Distribution  This species is found in Brazil and Surinam.

His name was sometimes misspelled as \\"Marasmi Kobayashi\\" or \\"Marashi Kobayashi\\" by contemporary United States Navy sources. He was an outspoken proponent of the Treaty Faction within the Imperial Japanese Navy. Biography Kobayashi was a native of Yonezawa, Yamagata, where his father was a farmer. With the assistance of a clique of admirals within the Imperial Japanese Navy from former Yonezawa Domain (including Yamashita Gentarō and Chūichi Nagumo), he entered military preparatory schools and graduated 4th out of 149 cadets from the 38th class of the Imperial Japanese Navy Academy. His classmates included Michitaro Totsuka, Takeo Kurita, Rokuzō Sugiyama, Gunichi Mikawa and Aritomo Gotō. After serving on the cruiser and battleship , Kobayashi was sent to the United Kingdom as part of the crew bringing the new battlecruiser to Japan. After attending the naval artillery and torpedo warfare schools, he served on the destroyer before attending the Naval Staff College in 1916, where he specialized in navigation. On graduation and promotion to lieutenant, Kobayashi served as chief navigator on the survey vessel and the aging cruiser . He then returned to shore duty from 1919-1921 with the IJN 3rd Fleet and served as an instructor at the Navy Academy. He returned to the Naval War College in 1921 and was promoted to lieutenant commander on graduation in 1922. His first command was from 1923-1925 of the river gunboat , which operated on the Yangtze River in Shanghai. From December 1925 to April 1928, Kobayashi served as a naval attaché to the United States. He was promoted to commander on 1 December 1927. After his return to Japan, Kobayashi served as executive officer on the submarine tender . He was promoted to captain on December 1, 1931. A week later, he was sent to Geneva as an attendant to the Geneva Conference. In November 1932, he returned to the United States as a naval attaché, remaining until June 1934. In December 1936, Kobayashi was appointed captain of the battleship . With the start of the Second Sino- Japanese War, Kobayashi became Chief of Staff of the IJN 4th Fleet and was based at Tsingtao as an assistant to Rear Admiral Soemu Toyoda. On 1 December 1937, Kobayashi was promoted to rear admiral. From September 1938 to November 1939, he served as Chief of Staff of the Sasebo Naval District. He returned to the China front in November 1939 as Commander of the Naval Base Forces in Wuhan, and from November 1940 in Shanghai. He returned to Japan in May 1941. On 15 October 1941, Kobayashi was promoted to vice admiral. World War II Shortly before the attack on Pearl Harbor, Kobayashi was the commander of the Osaka Guard District. He remained in that position until March 1943 and despite having more combat experience than many of his colleagues, was assigned to personnel recruitment, munitions production, and general bureaucratic duties. It was not until after the tide of the war started to change that Kobayashi was permitted to return to combat status with his appointment to command the IJN 4th Fleet on 1 April 1943. The IJN 4th Fleet was responsible for the defense of the South Pacific, although its responsibilities overlapped, and often conflicted with the IJN 2nd Fleet, IJN 6th Fleet, and the Combined Fleet. In November 1943, the Allies were victorious at the Battle of Tarawa and Battle of Makin in the Gilbert Islands, and in early February 1944 seized critically strategic positions in the Marshall Islands with the Battle of Kwajalein and the capture of Roi-Namur. Realizing that the major Japanese naval base in the South Pacific at Truk was endangered, Kobayashi ordered the naval assets there transferred to Palau. However, before the transfer could be complete, the United States launched Operation Hailstone, sinking a large number of Japanese warships and transports. The Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff blamed Kobayashi for the defeat and relieved him of his command two days later. On 30 May 1944, Kobayashi was forced from active service and on 31 May 1944, he went into the reserves. After the surrender of Japan, Kobayashi was detained at Sugamo Prison in Tokyo by the SCAP authorities, and charged with command responsibility for the war crimes perpetrated by Admiral Shigematsu Sakaibara in the \\"Wake Island Massacre\\". His case never came to trial, and he was released from Sugamo Prison in 1952. In the post-war period, Kobayashi served as an advisor and instructor for the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force.

Designed in Japan, it was based on the technology of the IBM PCjr and was designated the IBM 5511. It was targeted in the Australasian market towards the public education sector rather than at consumers, and was sold in three levels: JX (64 KiB), JX2 (128 KiB) and JX3 (256 KiB). Upgrades were available to both 384 KiB and 512 KiB. The JX was the first IBM PC to use 3.5\\" floppy drives. IBM Japan expected to sell 200,000 units of JX, but only 40,000 units were produced. The JX was discontinued in 1987, and IBM Japan gave 15,000 units of JX to its employees in honor of company's 50th anniversary. General The IBM JX's main difference from the PCjr was a professional keyboard (rather than the PCjr's disparaged chiclet keyboard), dual 3.5\\" floppy drives, as well as options for a 5.25\\" floppy drive and a hard drive, both of which sat atop the main unit. The JX did not support PCjr-like \\"sidecar\\" add-ons for hardware expansion. In common with the PCjr, however, it had no DMA controller. It also supported the otherwise unique-in-the-IBM-PC-world ECGA (Enhanced Color Graphics Adapter—16 simultaneous colors, but only at 320×200 resolution) and the PCjr's 4-channel sound. Support for these two features was utilised by only a handful of software developers—Sierra On-line being the most well-known. Configuration It had several innovative features: * Single or twin 3.5\\" 720 KB (initially only 360 KB) diskette drives * Wireless infra-red keyboard * 16-color video output * Stackable expansion * Joystick ports * Cartridge slots In Japan, both white and dark gray units were available, but elsewhere all IBM JXs were dark gray--very unusual in the days of the standard color of IBM \\"beige boxes\\". However, one disadvantage it shared with the PCjr was that it could not use the standard ISA bus cards of the IBM PC. The system operated PC DOS 2.11 as well as Microsoft Disk BASIC and Microsoft Advanced BASIC. Like the PC, if the system was left to boot without inserting a diskette into one of the drives the Microsoft Cassette BASIC interpreter would be loaded, which was compatible with IBM PCjr BASIC, including Cartridge BASIC. PC DOS 2.11 could only use half of the tracks of a 3.5\\" drive, however, since it didn't really understand what a 3.5\\" drive even was. The PCjx's BIOS could only address the first 40 tracks, like a 5.25\\" drive. The PCjx later had a BIOS upgrade chip, sold together with PC DOS 3.21, which could use the full 720 KB capacity of the diskette drives. Some popular options for the PCjx were a 5.25\\" 360 KB capacity diskette drive, a 10 MB external hard disk (both of these as stackable units the same size as the JX itself) and a joystick. IBM never released a 3270 emulation adapter for the PCjx, in order to steer enterprise customers to more-expensive IBM PCs and XTs. Reception BYTE in 1985 called the JX \\"a Japanese product for the Japanese; its price and capabilities reflect its target market\\". The magazine stated that its compatibility with PCjr peripherals rather than the PC's, and joystick ports and audio, \\"suggests that IBM Japan is hedging its bets by pursuing a share of the easily saturated video-game sector\\". BYTE concluded that \\"the JX will enjoy, at best, a modest and short-lived success—it's too little, too late\\" against more-sophisticated rival computers.

The cannon was capable of firing proto-shells, cast- iron bombs filled with gunpowder. Artillery in the Middle Ages primarily consisted of the introduction of the cannon, large tubular firearms designed to fire a heavy projectile over a long distance. Guns, bombs, rockets and cannons were first invented in China during the Han Chinese Song Dynasty and then later spread to Europe and the Middle East during the period. Although gunpowder was known in Europe during the High Middle Ages due to the usage of guns and explosives by the Mongols and the Chinese firearms experts employed by the Mongols as mercenaries during the Mongol conquests of Europe, it was not until the Late Middle Ages that European versions of cannons were widely developed. The first cannons introduced into Europe were probably used in Iberia, during the Christian wars against Muslims in the 13th century; their use was also first documented in the Middle East around this time. English cannons first appeared in 1327, and later saw more general use during the Hundred Years' War, when primitive cannons were engaged at the Battle of Crécy in 1346. By the end of the 14th century, the use of cannons was also recorded in Sweden, Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385), Grand Duchy of Moscow, Byzantium and the Ottoman Empire. The earliest medieval cannon, the pot-de-fer, had bulbous, vase-like shape, and was used more for psychological effect than for causing physical damage. The later culverin was transitional between the handgun and the full cannon, and was used as an anti-personnel weapon. During the 15th century, cannon advanced significantly, so that bombards were effective siege engines. Towards the end of the period, the cannon gradually replaced siege engines--among other forms of aging weaponry--on the battlefield. The Middle English word Canon was derived from the Tuscan word cannone, meaning large tube, which came from Latin canna, meaning cane or reed. The Latinised word canon has been used for a gun since 1326 in Italy, and since 1418 in English. The word Bombardum, or \\"bombard\\", was the earliest term used for \\"cannon\\", but from 1430 it came to refer only to the largest weapons. Early use in China and East Asia Bronze cannon with an inscription dated the 3rd year of the Zhiyuan era (1332) of the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368); it was discovered at the Yunju Temple of Fangshan District, Beijing, China in 1935. The first documented battlefield use of gunpowder artillery took place on 28 January 1132, when Song General Han Shizhong used huochong to capture a city in Fujian. The world's earliest known hand cannon is the Heilongjiang hand cannon dated 1288, which was found in Mongol-held Manchuria.C.P.Atwood-Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, p.354 In his 1341 poem, The Iron Cannon Affair, one of the first accounts of the use of gunpowder artillery in China, Xian Zhang wrote that a cannonball fired from an eruptor could \\"pierce the heart or belly when it strikes a man or horse, and can even transfix several persons at once.\\" Use in the Islamic world The Arabs acquired knowledge of gunpowder some time after 1240, but before 1280, by which time had written, in Arabic, recipes for gunpowder, instructions for the purification of saltpeter, and descriptions of gunpowder incendiaries.. Ahmad Y. al-Hassan claims that the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260 saw the Mamluks use against the Mongols in \\"the first cannon in history\\" gunpowder formulae which were almost identical with the ideal composition for explosive gunpowder, which he claims were not known in China or Europe until much later. However, Iqtidar Alam Khan states that it was invading Mongols who introduced gunpowder to the Islamic world. and cites Mamluk antagonism towards early riflemen in their infantry as an example of how gunpowder weapons were not always met with open acceptance in the Middle East.. Al-Hassan interprets Ibn Khaldun as reporting the use of cannon as siege machines by the Marinid sultan Abu Yaqub Yusuf at the siege of Sijilmasa in 1274. Super-sized bombards were used by the troops of Mehmed II to capture Constantinople, in 1453. Urban, a Hungarian cannon engineer, is credited with the introduction of this cannon from Central Europe to the Ottoman realm. It could fire heavy stone balls a mile, and the sound of their blast could reportedly be heard from a distance of . A piece of slightly later date (see pic) was cast in bronze and made in two parts: the chase and the breech, which, together, weighed 18.4 tonnes. The two parts were screwed together using levers to facilitate the work. Africa Adal pioneered the use of cannon in Africa during the Conquest of Abyssinia.Jeremy Black, Cambridge illustrated atlas, warfare: Renaissance to revolution, 1492–1792, (Cambridge University Press: 1996), p.9. In Africa, the Adal Empire and the Abyssinian Empire both deployed cannons during the Adal-Abyssinian War. Imported from Arabia, and the wider Islamic world, the Adalites led by Ahmed ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi were the first African power to introduce cannon warfare to the African continent.Tools of War: History of Weapons in Early Modern Times by Syed Ramsey - Somalia chapter, Early Modern Warfare. Later on as the Portuguese Empire entered the war it would supply and train the Abyssinians with cannons, while the Ottoman Empire sent soldiers and cannons to back Adal. The conflict proved, through their use on both sides, the value of firearms such as the matchlock musket, cannons, and the arquebus over traditional weapons.Cambridge illustrated atlas, Warfare: Renaissance to Revolution, 1492–1792, by Jeremy Black pg 9 Use in Europe Roger Bacon described the first gunpowder in Europe. \\"Vaso\\", the earliest illustration of a European cannon, from around 1327, by Walter de Milemete In Europe, one of the earliest mentions of gunpowder appeared in Roger Bacon's Opus Majus in 1267. It describes a recipe for gunpowder and recognized its military use: In 1250, the Norwegian Konungs skuggsjá mentioned, in its military chapter, the use of \\"coal and sulphur\\" as the best weapon for ship-to-ship combat., from the Konungs skuggsjá. Muslim and Christian Iberia In reference to the siege to Alicante in 1331, the Spanish historian Zurita recorded a \\"new machine that caused great terror. It threw iron balls with fire.\\"Partington, p 191 The Spanish historian Juan de Mariana recalled further use of cannons during the Siege of Algeciras (1342-1344): Juan de Mariana also relates that the English Earl of Derby and Earl of Salisbury had both participated in the siege of Algeciras, and they could have conceivably transferred the knowledge about the effectiveness of cannon to England.Watson, p 331 The Iberian kings at the initial stages enlisted the help of Moorish experts: Britain and France A reconstruction of the pot-de-fer vase cannon that fired arrows. Cannon seem to have been introduced to the Kingdom of England in the 14th century, and is mentioned as being in use against the Scots in 1327.Bottomley, p24 The first metal cannon was the pot-de-fer, first depicted in an illuminated manuscript by Walter de Milamete,Carman, W.Y. of 1327 that was presented to Edward III upon his accession to the English throne.Brodie, Fawn McKay; Brodie, Bernard The manuscript shows a four-legged stand supporting a \\"bulbous bottle\\", while the gunner stands well back, firing the charge with a red-hot iron bar. A bolt protrudes from the muzzle, but no wad is shown. Although illustrated in the treatise, no explanation or description was given.Nossov (2006), pp 205-208 This weapon, and others similar, were used by both the French and English during the Hundred Years' War (1337–1453), when cannon saw their first real use on the European battlefield.Manucy, p 3 The cannon of the 14th century were still limited in many respects, as a modern historian summarises: During the 1340s, cannon were still relatively rare, and were only used in small numbers by a few states.Nicolle, p 21 \\"Ribaldis\\" were first mentioned in the English Privy Wardrobe accounts during preparations for the Battle of Crécy between 1345 and 1346. These were believed to have shot large arrows and simple grapeshot, but they were so important they were directly controlled by the Royal Wardrobe. According to the contemporary chronicler Jean Froissart, the English cannon made \\"two or three discharges on the Genoese\\", which is taken to mean individual shots by two or three guns because of the time taken to reload such primitive artillery.Nicolle The Florentine Giovanni Villani agreed that they were destructive on the field, though he also indicated that the guns continued to fire upon French cavalry later in the battle: Advances in the Late Middle Ages Depiction of artillery in an illustration of the Siege of Orleans of 1429 (Martial d'Auvergne, 1493) Similar cannon to those used at Crécy appeared also at the Siege of Calais in the same year, and by the 1380s the \\"ribaudekin\\" clearly became mounted on wheels. Wheeled gun carriages became more commonplace by the end of the 15th century, and were more often cast in bronze, rather than banding iron sections together.Sadler, p 22-23 There were still the logistical problems both of transporting and of operating the cannon, and as many three dozen horses and oxen may have been required to move some of the great guns of the period. Another small-bore cannon of the 14th century was the culverin, whose name derives from the snake-like handles attached to it. It was transitional between the handgun and the full cannon, and was used as an anti-personnel weapon.Bottomley, p 43 The culverin was forged of iron and fixed to a wooden stock, and usually placed on a rest for firing.Bennet, p 91 15th century culveriners. The culverin was also common in 15th century battles, particularly among Burgundian armies. As the smallest of medieval gunpowder weapons, it was relatively light and portable. It fired lead shot, which was inexpensive relative to other available materials. Considerable developments in the 15th century produced very effective \\"bombards\\"Bottomley, p 25 — an early form of battering cannon used against walls and towers.Bottomley, p 17 These were used both defensively and offensively. Bamburgh Castle, previously thought impregnable, was taken by bombards in 1464. The keep in Wark, Northumberland was described in 1517 as having five storeys \\"in each of which there were five great murder-holes, shot with great vaults of stone, except one stage which is of timber, so that great bombards can be shot from each of them.\\"Bottomley, p 16-17 An example of a bombard was found in the moat of Bodiam Castle, and a replica is now kept inside. Hand culverin (middle) with two small cannon, Europe, 15th century. Artillery crews were generally recruited from the city craftsmen.Miller, p 18 The master gunner was usually the same person as the caster. In larger contingents, the master gunners had responsibility for the heavier artillery pieces, and were accompanied by their journeymen as well as smiths, carpenters, rope makers and carters. Smaller field pieces would be manned by trained volunteers. At the Battle of Flodden, each cannon had its crew of gunner, matrosses and drivers, and a group of \\"pioneers\\" were assigned to level to path ahead. Even with a level path, the gunpowder mixture used was unstable and could easily separate out into sulphur, saltpetre and charcoal during transport. Once on site, they would be fired at ground level behind a hinged timber shutter, to provide some protection to the artillery crew. Timber wedges were used to control the barrel's elevation. The majority of medieval cannon were breechloaders, although there was still no effort to standardise calibres. The usual loading equipment consisted of a copper loading scoop, a ramrod, and a felt brush or \\"sponge\\". A bucket of water was always kept beside the cannon. Skins or cloths soaked in cold water could be used to cool down the barrel, while acids could also be added to the water to clean out the inside of the barrel. Hot coals were used to heat the shot or keep the wire primer going. Some Scottish kings were very interested in the development of cannon, including James II, who was killed by the accidental explosion of one of his own cannon besieging Roxburgh Castle in 1460.Sadler, p 15 Mons Meg, which dates from about the same time, is perhaps the most famous example of a massive bombard. James IV was Scotland's first Renaissance figure, who also had a fascination with cannon, both at land and at sea. By 1502, he was able to invest in a Scottish navy, which was to have a large number of cannon — his flagship, the Great Michael, was launched in 1511, with 36 great guns, 300 lesser pieces and 120 gunners. Use in Eastern Europe Tokhtamysh's Invasion of Grand Duchy of Moscow, 1382. At this time, cannon and throwing-machines co-existed. Russia The first cannon appeared in Russia in the 1370-1380s, although initially their use was confined to sieges and the defence of fortresses.Nossov (2007), p 52 The first mention of cannon in Grand Duchy of Moscow chronicles is of tyufyaks, small howitzer-type cannon that fired case-shot, used to defend Moscow against Tokhtamysh Khan in 1382. Cannon co-existed with throwing-machines until the mid-15th century, when they overtook the latter in terms of destructive power. In 1446, a Russian city fell to cannon fire for the first time, although its wall was not destroyed. However it was not until 1475, when Ivan III established the first Russian cannon foundry in Moscow, which was the beginning of the native cannon production industry. The first stone wall to be destroyed in Russia by cannon fire came in 1481. Byzantine and Ottoman Empires During the 14th century, the Byzantine Empire began to accumulate its own cannon to face the Ottoman threat, starting with medium-sized cannon long and of 10\\" calibre.Turnbull, p 39-41 Only a few large bombards were under the Empire's control. The first definite use of artillery in the region was against the Ottoman siege of Constantinople in 1396. These loud Byzantine weapons, possibly operated by the Genoese or \\"Franks\\" of Galata, forced the Turks to withdraw. The Ottomans had acquired their own cannon by the siege of 1422, using \\"falcons\\", which were short but wide cannon. The two sides were evenly matched technologically, and the Turks had to build barricades \\"in order to receive… the stones of the bombards.\\" Because the Empire at this time was facing economic problems, Pope Pius II promoted the affordable donation of cannon by European monarchs as a means of aid. Any new cannon after the 1422 siege were gifts from European states, and aside from these, no other advances were made to the Byzantine arsenal. the Dardanelles Gun, a heavy bronze cannon, similar to those at the Siege of Constantinople in 1453 In contrast, when Sultan Mehmet II laid siege to Constantinople in April 1453, he used 68 Hungarian-made cannon, the largest of which was long and weighed 20 tons. This fired a 1,200 pound stone cannonball, and required an operating crew of 200 men. Two such bombards had initially been offered to the Byzantines by the Hungarian artillery expert Urban, which were the pinnacle of gunpowder technology at the time; he boasted that they could reduce \\"even the walls of Babylon\\". However, the fact that the Byzantines could not afford it illustrates the financial costs of artillery at the time. These cannon also needed 70 oxen and 10,000 men just to transport them. They were extremely loud, adding to their psychological impact, and Mehmet believed that those who unexpectedly heard it would be struck dumb. The 55-day bombardment of Constantinople left massive destruction, as recounted by the Greek chronicler Kritovoulos: Byzantine counter artillery allowed them to repel any visible Turkish weapons, and the defenders repulsed any attempts to storm any broken points in the walls and hastily repaired any damage. However, the walls could not be adapted for artillery, and towers were not good gun emplacements. There was even worry that the largest Byzantine cannon could cause more damage to their own walls than the Turkish cannon. Gunpowder had also made the formerly devastating Greek fire obsolete, and with the final fall of what had once been the strongest walls in Europe on May 29, \\"it was the end of an era in more ways than one\\". Cannon at the end of the Middle Ages The rounded walls of the 14th century Sarzana Castle showed adaption to gunpowder. Toward the end of the Middle Ages, the development of cannon made revolutionary changes to siege warfare throughout Europe, with many castles becoming susceptible to artillery fire. The primary aims in castle wall construction were height and thickness, but these became obsolete because they could be damaged by cannonballs.Chartrand, p 8 Inevitably, many fortifications previously deemed impregnable proved inadequate in the face of gunpowder. The walls and towers of fortifications had to become lower and wider, and by the 1480s, \\"Italian tracing\\" had been developed, which used the corner bastion as the basis of fortifications for centuries to come. The introduction of artillery to siege warfare in the Middle Ages made geometry the main element of European military architecture. In 16th century England, Henry VIII began building Device Forts between 1539 and 1540 as artillery fortresses to counter the threat of invasion from France and Spain. They were built by the state at strategic points for the first powerful cannon batteries, such as Deal Castle, which was perfectly symmetrical, with a low, circular keep at its centre. Over 200 cannon and gun ports were set within the walls, and the fort was essentially a firing platform, with a shape that allowed many lines of fire; its low curved bastions were designed to deflect cannonballs.Wilkinson, Castles (Pocket Guides) To guard against artillery and gunfire, increasing use was made of earthen, brick and stone breastworks and redoubts, such as the geometric fortresses of the 17th century French Marquis de Vauban. Although the obsolescence of castles as fortifications was hastened by the developments of cannon from the 14th century on, many medieval castles still managed to \\"put up a prolonged resistance\\" against artillery during the English Civil War of 17th century.Bottomley, p 45 See also *Early thermal weapons FootnotesReferences  Mariana, Juan de.

In 1870, he moved with his family to Frankfort, Kentucky. After high school Sawyier attended the McMicken School of Design (now the Art Academy of Cincinnati), studying under Frank Duveneck and Thomas Satterwhite Noble. In 1889, he furthered his art studies under William Merritt Chase at the Art Students League of New York.

In 1893, Sawyier went to the Chicago's World's Columbian Exposition, where some of his works were in the State of Kentucky display. Sawyier originals are on display in Frankfort, Kentucky at Liberty Hall & Orlando Brown House, Paul Sawyier Art Gallery, Kentucky History Center, Kings Daughter's Apartments, and at the University of Kentucky Art Museum in Lexington and Speed Art Museum in Louisville, Kentucky.

It was the first compilation game for the system. All games are presented in their original arcade formats as individually launchable games from the main menu.  Gameplay  The player is presented with a main menu where they can select from the 6 arcade titles. For each game they can select various settings such as skill level, number of lives and if they want high scores automatically saved to the memory card. In addition to the games themselves, there are also behind the scenes interviews on the making of the games presented as an FMV. The compilation features the following games:  720°  A skateboarding game where the player must complete tricks to increase their score.  Klax  A puzzle video game where blocks roll towards the player who can catch them on a panel and drop them into the playing area below to get color matches to score points.  Rampage  The player takes control of gigantic creatures with the main goal being to destroy the city and the military forces trying to stop you.  Smash TV  The setting is a futuristic ultra violent game show where the player must defeat hordes of oncoming enemies in each room to progress.  Super Sprint  A quick paced overhead 3 player car racing game.  Toobin'  A river race in an inflatable tube while avoiding obstacles and crashing into competitors.  Faithfulness to the original games  Skill levels and number of lives can be set before starting the game, making it less harsh in terms of difficulty. On the negative side there are frame rate drops in Rampage, and a darker colour palette in 720° and Toobin'.  Peripherals  Most games are either compatible with a certain peripheral or they're not, but due to Arcade Party Pak's multiple game set-up, compatibility is on a game by game basis. Rampage is compatible with the multitap, allowing up to 3 players, 720° can take advantage of the PlayStation Mouse but for player 2 only and Super Sprint is compatible with the mouse for any player. Although not mentioned in the game's manual, Super Sprint can be played with the PlayStation steering wheel. Smash TV benefits from analog stick compatibility, effectively turning it into a true Twin-stick shooter.  Compatibility  Whereas most PS1 games are compatible with the PlayStation 2, Arcade Party Pak is a PlayStation game partially incompatible with PlayStation 2.  Reception  Digital Press magazine gave the game a 33/40, PlayStation Official Magazine – UK gave the game a 5/10 and Gamers Republic gave the game a B rating.

However, the town and the temple were burned down by General Fukushima Masanori (福島正則) in 1595, by order of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, because it was the hometown of one of the wives of Toyotomi Hidetsugu, called either Kohama-hime (小浜姫) or Kame-hime (亀姫). Hideyoshi had already killed both Hidetsugu and his Kame-hime. Even though Hidetsugu was a nephew of Hideyoshi, his loyalty came into doubt and Hideyoshi suspected he might try to usurp power from either him or Toyotomi Hideyori, the only son of Hideyoshi.

Introduction The film followed the extended family of \\"The General\\", played by Barker, as they went on an eventful picnic in the Devon countryside. The film is notable for being completely free of speech, with the score by Ronnie Hazlehurst and various sound effects in their place. The humour is instead entirely visual, and relies on comic stereotypes (the old randy general, the busty girl, etc.) It had a sequel, By the Sea, featuring some of the same characters made in 1982. The 28-minute film was shown on BBC 2 on 1 January 1976, but has rarely been repeated, although in recent times it has been shown several times by ITV3, who currently hold the rights to the Two Ronnies library. A limited VHS release of By The Sea and The Picnic was available in 1990 and deleted in 1994. The Picnic and By The Sea, were both released on DVD on 24 September 2012 as part of The Two Ronnies: Complete Collection. . A standalone Australian individual release of both silent shorts was released on Region 4 DVD on 10 June 2015, titled: The Two Ronnies: The Picnic and By the Sea.

Martyrdom In early February 1586, James left Rheims for the mission, accompanied by Stephen Rowsham who had been banished from England the year before. They met up with Ralph Crockett in Dieppe. He was captured on board a ship at Littlehampton, Sussex, on 19 April 1586, with three other priests, Thomas Bramston, George Potter, and his fellow martyr, Ralph Crockett, and they were charged with being Catholic priests and coming into the realm of England contrary to an Act of Parliament of 1584. All four were sent to London and put in prison there on 27 April 1586, where they remained for more than two years without trial. After the failure of the Spanish Armada, an attempt to invade England which was defeated in July and August 1588, the government of Queen Elizabeth I wanted revenge, and the priests in its custody became a target. Four of these, Ralph Crockett, Edward James, John Oven and Francis Edwardes, were sent for trial at Chichester on 30 September 1588. All four were condemned to death for being priests and entering England, but Oven then took the Oath of Supremacy, in accordance with the Act of Supremacy 1559, and was reprieved. On 1 October 1588, the other three were drawn on a hurdle to Broyle Heath, near Chichester, where Edwardes recanted and was also reprieved. Crockett and James continued to refuse to recant and to take the oath and were executed at Chichester, after absolving each other.

It was a cantilever, mid-wing monoplane trimotor with a retractable, tailwheel undercarriage. There were 875Pini 1994, p.1. (plus one prototype) built, the first entering service in 1940. Although able to operate as a bomber with a maximum bombload of up to 8,818 lb (4000 kg), the SM.82 saw very limited use in this role.Mondey 2006, p. 242. The SM.82 was the foreign aircraft used in largest number by the Luftwaffe, which operated several hundreds of this aircraft, as a transport.Pini 1994, p.1. Post-war about 30 SM.82s continued in service with the Aeronautica Militare Italiana, many remaining in service until the early 1960s.Mondey 2006, pp. 242–243. Development The SM.82 was developed from the earlier SM.75 Marsupiale civil transport as a heavy bomber and military transport. Although having the same configuration of the SM.75, the SM.82 was larger. The aircraft was quickly developed and the prototype first flew in 1939. Although underpowered and slow, it was capable of carrying heavy loads, including the L3 light tank and a complete disassembled CR.42 fighter (these loads demanded special modifications). It had both cargo and troop transport capability, with room up to 40 men and their equipment. Deliveries to the Regia Aeronautica began in 1940. However, production rates were slow, with only 100 aircraft delivered in 1940, and another 100 in 1941, so that there were never enough of these aircraft in service. By 1942 production doubled to 200 a year, while in 1944 almost 300 were produced, by which time the factory was under the control of the Germans. In 1939 it set a world's closed circuit distance record when it covered 10,000 km at an average speed of 239.67 km/h, remaining in the air for 56.5 hours. The aircraft has seen extensive service throughout all the various African campaigns. Design The SM.82's fuselage was of mixed-construction, with welded-steel tube framework, with 22 frames and four longerons, skinned with metal forward, and plywood and fabric elsewhere. The wings were constructed almost entirely of wood, having three T-section spars, and 42 ribs in each. The flaps were made from a single piece of wood, while the ribs were of light and flexible poplar. The skin was of fabric-covered plywood, doped to be water-resistant. The ailerons (+13/-28°) occupied about half of the wing's trailing edge while Handley Page slats occupied the leading-edge. The tail had a conventional spruce structure and a plywood skin, while the rudder and elevators were a fabric-covered metal framework. Inside, there were two levels. The upper level held seats for 32. The lower level was used for freight or to carry bombs when used in the bombing role, with two large duralumin bomb bay doors. The floor was made of wood, with nine detachable panels, that helped with the accommodation (through the bomb bay doors) of heavy loads. The cockpit held four: two pilots, with the first (on the left) with an armoured seat, a mechanic and an engineer/gunner. Internal equipment comprised a radio-transmitter (AR8 and AR350), a fire extinguisher system, and an electrical generator. The instruments included altimeters, thermometers, compass, clock, and a Telefunken P63N radio goniometer. The SM.82 was fitted with three 641 kW (860 hp) Alfa Romeo 128 RC.18 radial engines with aluminium and steel three-blade constant speed propellers 3.6 m (11 ft 9 in) in diameter. These engines were the ultimate evolution of the license-built Bristol Pegasus. The aircraft had six self-sealing fuel tanks in each wing, three between the second and third spar, with a total of 1,276 L (337 US gal). Between the first and second spar there were another three fuel tanks with 653 L (173 US gal). Another tank in the nose, with 167 L (44 US gal) of 100 octane fuel (rather than 87) for the electric generator. The total weight of fuel amounted to 4,403 kg (9,707 lb), plus 136 L (36 US gal) of oil.Lembo 2002, p.5. The SM.82 had both defensive and offensive armament. For offensive purposes it could carry a very wide range of ordnance, up to 4,000 kg (8,820 lb). * 4 × 800 kg (1,760 lb) * 8 × 500 kg (1,100 lb) * 8 × 250 kg (550 lb) * 27 × 50 kg (110 lb) or 100 kg (220 lb) bombs * 25 × 100 kg (220 lb) cluster bombs, each containing 56 bomblets, though these were rarely used. Control over bomb release was in the retractable ventral bombardier's gondola, equipped with a Jozza bombsight and also fitted with a rear-facing 7.7 mm (.303 in) Breda machine gun. Accommodation for the bombardier was far from ideal, being cramped, unheated, unpressurized, and not connected to the oxygen system. The 1 mm steel structure was also highly vulnerable to enemy fire. For protection, only the first pilot's seat was armoured, while the self-sealing fuel tanks were proofed, theoretically, against 12.7 mm (.50 in) rounds, but did not have Carbon dioxide pressurization to prevent explosions if they were hit by tracer, incendiary or explosive rounds. No other armour was fitted. All this made it extremely vulnerable to enemy fire. The main defensive weapon was a Caproni-Lanciani rotating dorsal turret, armed with a Scotti 12.7 mm (.50 in) machine gun with 350 rounds. This weapon was theoretically more powerful and lighter than the Breda-SAFAT, but reliability was a concern, and projectile dispersion was so wide as to reduce the theoretical range of 400 m (1,310 ft) to around 200 m (660 ft) in practice. Additional 7.7 mm (.303 in) Breda-SAFAT machine guns were mounted in each side and in the bombardier's gondola, with four 215-round magazines each. The gondola's machine gun was of little use given the cramped accommodation, and was often not fitted, even in the SM.82 equipped for the bombing role. German machine-guns were used in the Luftwaffe versions, with the 13 mm (.51 in) MG 131 in the turret. 7.92 mm (.312 in) MG 17s were used in some aircraft. The SM.82's performance was modest, with a cruising speed only 250 km/h (160 mph) at 3,000 m (9,840 ft), even without the bombardier's gondola under the nose (which added more drag) it was slow, while its silhouette was large and easy to spot. The ceiling was seldom over 5,000 m (16,400 ft). This left the SM.82 well inside the operational altitude of most fighters of the time, as well as the effective range of heavy and medium anti-aircraft guns. In comparison, the B-17 had a typical ceiling of 6,000–8,000 m (19,690–26,260 ft),(note that the B-17 and B-24 Liberator both had unusually high operating ceilings for the time, as compared to other bomber and transport aircraft). In operation, when faced with a fighter opposition, the SM.82 suffered a devastating loss rate. On 24 November 1942, three Beaufighters downed seven SM.82s, a 100% loss. Later on 10 April 1943, 10 out of 20 in formation were downed by a single pass of a P-38 Lightning squadron. At altitude, the SM.82 was almost a fixed target for both flak and fighter opposition. Operational history=Early missions The first missions were to transport Italian troops to Libya, together with their heavy equipment, but the first two squadrons had only three SM.82s each. The first flights were made the beginning of June 1940, transporting 360 men of 61° Infantry Regiment. Initially, the aircraft were organized in 149° Gruppo, with a SM.73 and SM.75. On the 17 June 1940 the first mission for all five aircraft of the Gruppo, transported ten anti-tank guns and 17 radio- communication units. By 24 June, there were 11 aircraft employed in transporting men and equipment to Africa. Within a few weeks a further 25 were delivered. On 24 June, the first SM.82 was lost during a resupply mission in the desert. In July 1940, a series of bombing missions to Gibraltar was organized, with 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) of bombs in each aircraft. The first bombing mission was on 17 July 1940 with three SM.82s taking off from Guidonia at 1940, and flying 1,600 km (995 mi) to arrive over Gibraltar eight hours later at 0340. Another mission was launched from Sardinia to shorten the journey, then another on 20 August, this time by 32° Wing. However one of the two aircraft, carrying a 1,000 kg (2,210 lb) bombload, was shot down. The other two aircraft in 32° Wing were reassigned to transport squadrons. In mid-1940, 41° Group was sent to Rhodes with three SM.82s, and other four in October, for the special mission to the British-controlled oil refineries at Manama in the Persian Gulf. This meant a flight of 4,200 km (2,610 mi), lasting 15 hours at 270 km/h (170 mph), that was for the time arguably a record for a bombing mission. Four SM.82s took off from Rhodes, under the command of Ettore Muti. Each aircraft carried a load of 1,500 kg (3,310 lb). This long-range action was successful, taking the target totally by surprise, and the SM.82s landed without problems at Zula. This raid caused the Allies some concerns, forcing them to upgrade their defences. This, more than the limited amount of damage caused, further stretched Allied military resources. However the scarcity of SM.82s hampered further long-range missions, though some actions were carried out. Six single aircraft night bombing missions were mounted, mainly against Alexandria, in October and November 1940. All these missions were performed by SM.82s of 114° Gruppo, but all of their aircraft were destroyed or damaged by the time of Operation Compass in December 1940. East African Campaign The need for transport aircraft meant that, apart from occasional special operations, like dropping paratroops, the SM.82s were used solely in this role; especially to maintain contact with Eastern Africa which was more and more isolated from the rest of the Italian forces. Italy at that time had control of part of East Africa (AOI, Africa Orientale Italiana), and needed a long-range supply aircraft to support its troops fighting the East African Campaign. 149° Gruppo flew many missions over the Adriatic, and to Ethiopia, despite the fact that the pilots were convinced that given the strong, contrary winds, the slow SM.82s would be unable to return to Libya. The missions to eastern Africa were carried out with a 1,300 L (340 US gal) auxiliary tank fitted, and the first mission was successfully performed on 27 July 1940, between Benghazi (Libya) and Asmara (Eritrea). However, on the fourth mission aircraft MM.60277 overran the airstrip and was largely destroyed by fire. 149° Gruppo flew 330 missions with its S.82s, S.75s and S.83s. By the end of 1940, the SM.82s had logged 5,187 hours flight time, with 16,267 passengers and 2,247 tonnes of materials. On 24 August 1940, the first delivery of a Fiat CR.42 fighter was made to Eastern Africa. By April 1941, 51 CR.42s and 51 reserve engines had been delivered, but despite this effort the AOI fell to the Allies in May 1941. In March 1941, 32° Wing received some new SM.82s, and organized five bombing missions over Gibraltar in June and July, always with only one aircraft. On 1 April 1942, another attack was made by three aircraft that dropped 18 160 kg (353 lb) bombs. All this accounted for just eight attacks in almost two years on this key British position, with around twenty aircraft (between one and three each time), and a little more than a tonne of bombs delivered by each aircraft. North Africa The Special Bombing Section was constituted, with only two SM.82s, on 10 April 1941, and another five aircraft were delivered later. They performed only a few missions as bombers, including two over Alexandria in May and June, before being used as transports. On 1 March 1941, 146° Gruppo was formed with 17 SM.82s, one SM.79 and one Ca.164. 146° Gruppo, along with 145° and 149° Gruppo, were mainly involved in transport missions to North Africa. In May 1941 during the Anglo-Iraqi War the Iraqis requested help from Axis air forces, and SM.82s flew several missions via Syria carrying a total of 18 tonnes of equipment and 25 persons. In July 1941 37° Gruppo was equipped with SM.82s. In 1942, 18° Wing, and then 44°, 45°, and 48° Wing were equipped with the aircraft. From the end of 1942, these aircraft flew many supply missions across the Mediterranean, until Operation Flax in April 1943 ended the air bridge to Axis forces in Tunisia. The SM.82 suffered many losses. In December 1941, six were destroyed by Bristol Blenheims at Castelvetrano airfield in a single night. In the last months of the North African campaign, SM.82s were used to send troops and materials, even though it was clear that this campaign was lost after El Alamein. Around 100 SM.82 were shot down or destroyed on the ground between November 1942 and April 1943. Among other episodes, on 2 November 1942, seven (or six depending on source) SM.82s were forced to land (or crashed) by only three Beaufighters. On 12 November 1942, six Beaufighters downed an entire formation of five SM.82s. On 22 November, ten SM.82s were attacked by three Beaufighters, causing much damage and killing or wounding many of the troops inside the unarmoured aircraft. On 10 April 1943, another seven were downed, four more on 16 April, and finally on 19 April 1943 twelve SM.82, one SM.75, and three Fiat G.12s were downed or forced to land. Attacks on airfields destroyed five SM.82s at Benina airfield (19 km/12 mi east of Benghazi), three at Tunis on 22 January 1943, and three on 24 March. At Castelvetrano, 11 SM.82s were destroyed on 13 April. During the attacks on Rome on 19 July 1943, eight S.82s were destroyed and seven damaged at Urbe airfield, and four SM.82s were destroyed, and 14 damaged over Ciampino. Both in the air or on the ground, SM.82s were easy targets. 145° Group, usually a transport unit, was also equipped with some bomber versions and attacked enemy targets in Marmarica and Egypt in four night raids in June 1942. On 3 July a single aircraft bombed the El Haman airfield in Libya. Another four aircraft flew from Rodi airfield to bomb Alexandria, but after only four missions, all four aircraft were taken out of service. In July 1943 there were bombing missions over Sicily, to interdict enemy landings, like the one that dropped 20 cluster bombs (100 kg/220 lb and 28 bomblets each) over Comiso. These missions were only a nuisance to the Allies, even if they forced them to assign first line air defences and interceptors to counter the threat. This was the main reason for the Italians to mount these missions, although only a total of 100 sorties were flown in three years of war, with an average of 1,000–1,500 kg (2,200–3,310 lb) bombload, and the use of some of the best aviators of the Regia Aereonautica. The most successful missions for the SM-82 were in the paratrooper transport role. Several special paratrooper models were made, but all were used by simply putting wooden planks in the bomb bay to stand on. Over 15 combat air drops were made successfully with few losses in Italy, Africa, Greece and Russia. Luftwaffe Between 1942 and Spring 1943, FliegerTransportGruppe \\"Savoia\\" operated 100 Savoia-Marchettis. After September 1943, SIAI kept on producing SM.82 for Luftwaffe, delivering 299 planes. Other Marsupiali were captured after the 8 September armistice. These aircraft had better capabilities as transports than the Junkers Ju 52, the standard transport aircraft of the Luftwaffe, that was, however, much more robust, compared to the SM.82, being all metal. Under German insignia, the Savoia-Marchettis were operated mostly by 6th Luftflotte and ReichLuftflotte on Eastern front and in Northern Germany, up to the end of war,Pini 1994, p.1. but little is recorded of the activities of these aircraft in the last 18 months of the war as most were ad-hoc units. Records were either not kept or were destroyed. After the armistice After the Armistice of 8 September 1943, only 29 planes were operated by the ICAF in Southern Italy. The air force of the Italian Social Republic, the fascist puppet state installed by Germany in northern Italy, operated about 60 aircraft, 40 of which assigned to 2° Gruppo A.T. \\"M.O. Trabucchi\\" that flew on Eastern front.Pini 1994, p.1. After the war, about 30 SM.82s continued in service with the Aeronautica Militare until the early 1960s. Civil transport Even with the outbreak of the war long-range civilian routes did not end. The civil aircraft had 14 seats, 1,306 l (345 US gal) of additional fuel, and 350 kg (770 lb) of military equipment removed. They flew to Brazil via Spain and West Africa. Between 11 September 1940 and the entry of Brazil into the war in 1941, 68 flights were made. Two aircraft, I-BAIA and I-BRAZ, were lost in December 1940. Some S.82s were used in militarized service, with Special Air Services and the task of personnel transport, including the civilian evacuations in 1941.

It follows the lives of German immigrants Fidelis Waldvogel and his family, as well as Delphine Watzka and her partner Cyprian, as they adjust in their separate lives in the small town of Argus, North Dakota. Bookended by World War I, which Fidelis and Cyprian fought in, and World War II, which Fidelis' children fight in, the title contains several overarching themes including family, tradition, loss, betrayal, and memory, to name a few. Much of The Master Butchers Singing Club revolves around the German American cultural tradition, which is part of Erdrich's personal heritage, though she is best known as a Native American novelist. The novel has been developed into a stage play by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Marsha Norman, and premiered as part of the Guthrie Theater's 2010/11 season in September 2010 under the direction of Francesca Zambello.Kerr, Euan.\\"Guthrie will premier Erdrich's \\"Master Butcher's Singing Club\\" mpr.org, April 7, 2010 In 2019, the novel was adapted in Germany for TV by ARD, one of Germany's main public TV stations.IMDb, Plot summary The novel begins at the end of World War I with Fidelis Waldvogel, a German sniper, returning to his hometown in defeated Germany from the battle lines. Fidelis seeks out Eva Kalb, the pregnant fiancée of his dear friend, Johannes, and informs her that her fiancé has died in the war. He tells Eva of his promise to Johannes, which is that he would marry and take care of her. She agrees, and soon the two are wed. Fidelis, a butcher by trade, leaves Germany by himself to emigrate to the United States in order to escape the immense poverty brought on by the war. He plans to travel to Seattle to set up a new life for his family, paying his way by selling German sausages. However his funds and sausages run out in Argus, North Dakota. Fidelis first works for the local butcher and then sets up his own butcher shop in Argus. He works hard until he can finally send for his wife, Eva, and her child, Franz. Delphine Watzka is the daughter of Roy Watzka, the town drunk, who grew up in Argus, North Dakota. Delphine never met her mother and leaves the town to become a vaudeville performer. Delphine meets and becomes attached to Cyprian, a World War I veteran. The two make money from an act where Delphine performs as a table upon which Cyprian balances. One day, after a performance, Delphine discovers Cyprian engaging in a sexual act with a man. This discovery changes their relationship, but the two remain together, posing as a married couple. The two return to Argus, where they stop to see Delphine's severely alcoholic father. There is an overpowering stench in Roy's house, and in the process of cleaning the dwelling, Delphine and Cyprian discover the corpses of three people – two adults and one child – rotting in her father's cellar. The three corpses are later revealed as the remains of the Chavers family. While attempting to unravel the mystery of the bodies in the cellar, as well as to eradicate the odor from the house, Delphine meets Eva. The two quickly become friends; Eva takes Delphine under her wing, allowing Delphine to work in the butcher shop, and mentoring her in many of the domestic skills Delphine had never learned. Eva learns that she has cancer, and despite medical treatments and Delphine's nursing, her health deteriorates. Eva's sister-in-law Tante (\\"aunt\\" in German) Maria Theresa arrives to assist the family with the various means of daily life. Tante and Delphine take an instant dislike to each other. During Eva's painful final days, Tante destroys prescribed narcotic medication to assist her out of shame towards Eva's dependency on the drug. In one of the most gripping sections of the novel, Delphine tries to find a doctor and pharmacist while Eva's pain becomes uncontrollable. Finally, Roy breaks into the pharmacy and obtains the morphine that Eva desperately needs. Soon after, Eva dies. Her death leads to the sobering of Roy, as she was one of the few people that was actually nice to him. Additionally, Delphine vows to raise Eva's four boys and to assist Fidelis. Meanwhile, Albert Hock, town sheriff, has been investigating the Chavers case. Beads from Clarisse's dress that were embedded in the floor over the cellar becomes the means by which Hock attempts to blackmail Clarisse into becoming involved with him. She stabs the sheriff to death and flees to the Twin Cities. Tante and Cyprian both leave Argus. Tante returns to Germany with Erich and Emil. Cyprian returns to the life of the traveling performer. Both departures pave the way for a romance between Delphine and Fidelis, which eventually results in marriage. Roy Watzka dies, but not before revealing the truth behind the deaths of the Chavers family. They were left in the cellar as retribution towards Porky Chavers, the father, singing over Roy in Fidelis' singing club. Roy did not intend for them to die, but due to the after-effect of an alcohol-induced binge, he forgot they were in the basement. At the outbreak of World War II, Fidelis finds his family once again ravaged by war. His sons Franz and Markus both enlist in the United States Army, whereas his twin sons, Erich and Emil, enlist in the German military. Emil is quickly killed in the war, and his twin Erich is eventually captured by U.S. soldiers. He is transferred to a POW camp in the U.S. After Markus finds this out, he takes Fidelis there but Erich refuses to speak to either of them. Franz as well, on the American side, is gravely injured in an airplane accident, which eventually results in his death. On a post-war trip to Germany, at which Delphine and Fidelis attend an unveiling of a memorial to the bombing of Fidelis' home town, Fidelis falls ill. He dies on their return trip to Argus. The novel concludes with the revelation of Delphine's true heritage, as told by the town scrap collector, Step-and-a-Half. Delphine was the biological daughter of Mrs. Shimek (Mazarine's mother). She had been abandoned when she was born and found in an outhouse by Step-and-a-Half. Step- and-a-Half gave her to Roy to raise. Significant characters *Fidelis Waldvogel: A German American immigrant and former sniper in World War I who works as a butcher in North Dakota. As his name suggests, Fidelis is a stable man who remains faithful to his personal convictions and also to anyone with whom he builds a relationship. He possesses a beautiful singing voice which stands in stark contrast to his rather brutal profession. *Delphine Watzka: Partner to Cyprian Lazarre and daughter to Roy Watzka, she returns to Argus, North Dakota. Although she's never known her real mother, Delphine is forced to play the role as caregiver for not only her father but also to various other people of the town. *Eva Waldvogel: Former fiancé to Johannes, wife of Fidelis who helps run many of the operations of his butcher shop; mother of Franz, Markus, Emil and Erich. Eva becomes a role model, much needed mother figure and dearest friend to Delphine. *Johannes: Close friend of Fidelis who dies in World War I fighting for the Germans, leaving Eva alone and pregnant. He is Franz's biological father. *Franz Waldvogel: Biological son of Johannes and Eva, Franz is raised to see Fidelis as his father. He is a strong intelligent athlete and develops a relationship with Mazarine. He also becomes increasingly interested in aviation, leading to his position as a World War II pilot. *Markus Waldvogel: Son of Eva and Fidelis. Named after Eva's father, he is the more sensitive of the brothers. He is also rather introverted and philosophical, and becomes deeply attached to the women in his family. Delphine becomes especially fond of him. *Emil and Erich Waldvogel: Twins born to Eva and Fidelis, they are the youngest in the family. Strong and simple- minded, the boys share a special interest in war games as children, which leads to their future position as World War II soldiers in the German Army (1935-1945). *Tante Maria Theresa Waldvogel: Fidelis' jealous sister, controlling aunt to Fidelis' sons who prides herself on her strong German heritage and is one of Delphine's greatest rivals. Tante comes to Argus, North Dakota for an American life that her brother has found and finds nothing similar. *Cyprian Lazarre: Former U.S. Marine in World War I, traveling performer and balancing expert, who struggles with his own sexual identity, and even though he loves Delphine dearly, his relationship with her only makes his struggle more intense. *Roy Watzka: Delphine's father, town alcoholic, who never stops grieving over the loss of the love of his life. Although Roy is not a pillar of the community, he exhibits moments of integrity. However, Roy carries deep and dark secrets that will shake the whole town. *Step-and-a- Half: She hoards not only the town's junk but a great secret as well. Her past, which she doesn't reveal until the novel's end, causes her to wander in and out of peoples lives much as she wanders about town. *Mazarine Shimek: Franz's girlfriend; becomes a close friend of Delphine's. *Clarisse Strub: Intimidating town mortician, and childhood friend to Delphine, who is constantly forced to fight off Sheriff Hock's sexual advances. *Albert Hock: Sheriff of Argus who uses his power of intimidation in an attempt to entice the Clarisse Strub and also in solving the death of the Chavers family. *The Chavers Family: Doris, Portland \\"Porky\\" and their young daughter Ruthie. In search of a bottle in the cellar, the family becomes the fatal victims of what started out as a practical joke. Themes Identity: Erdrich plays with modern notions of identity by not ascribing an inherent essential self to the characters of Master Butchers Singing Club, and not reducing them to one single experience or factor. Instead, identity comes from a mix of things, and many characters experience a kind of blurred identity, in which they exhibit or hold dear two traits that would seemingly appear to not go together. Fidelis' butchering profession suggests a potential for brutality, but he also has a beautiful voice that he uses to unite the men of the town in the singing club. Eridrich reminds us that this is a world \\"where butchers sing like angels\\" (p. 388). Delphine likewise exhibits a blurred identity—she feels the loss of her mother deeply and wants to know her mother's story, but is not distraught when she is unable to receive concrete answers from Roy. Instead, she is able to cultivate meaningful relationships with women that mirror a mother-daughter relationship. Cyprian feels sexually drawn to men but attempts to live a heterosexual life with Delphine; he must constantly balance these two opposing aspects of his personality. Roy also exhibits traits that would seem to not go together in the same person—he is both the bad guy (neglectful father and alcoholic) and the good guy (Eva's savior from pain in her darkest hour). The characters are not defined by one single event or one single heritage; instead, they draw their identities based on a complex set of experiences, relationships, heritage, and emotions. Loyalty: In the novel some of the characters experience divisions in loyalty causing personal dissonance. Fidelis, the German native, experiences this most clearly when WWII begins. This is best illustrated when the singing club decides to quit singing Germans songs—instead they sing American songs. However, when alone Fidelis sings old German songs that \\"fill him with shame.\\" Fidelis also has the awful knowledge that he has sons fighting for both sides. Delphine feels divided loyalty in regards to her father. She feels very protective of him and cares for him throughout her life. However, he was a raging alcoholic that forced her to be self-sustaining from a young age, and she suspects throughout the novel that he may be guilty of murdering the Chavers family. Family: Erdrich examines the true meaning of family in The Master Butchers Singing Club. Biological relationships are often hidden or deceiving complications of traditional notions of family. Through Fidelis' honor of marrying Eva and raising Franz after Johannes' death, the relationship between Cyprian and Delphine, Delphine's relationship with Roy and Step-and-a-Half, as well as the relationships between Delphine and the Waldvogels, Erdrich illustrates that family is not limited by blood. The characters are free to move in and out of their immediate biological family circles to create and sustain meaningful relationships that come to resemble familial relations, such as Delphine's motherly love and affection for Markus. Characters choose how to feel about one another and are not limited by their genetics. Tradition: The defining theme of tradition stems from the traditions brought to the United States by Fidelis. Examples of this include the precision Fidelis takes in caring for his butcher knives, the perfection he achieves in his profession as a butcher, as well as the singing club itself. However, the singing club that is created in Argus is radically different from those in Germany. In Germany the singing club includes only master butchers as tradition dictates. However, in Argus there are only two butchers so it is necessary for Fidelis to extend the tradition to the rest of the town males. German-American heritage Erdrich uses some of her personal family history and background as source for The Master Butcher's Singing Club. In this case, it is important to note some of the information surrounding German-American lifestyle. Overwhelmingly, Germans immigrated to the United States in search of an improved standard of living. There were incentives from land and railroad companies as well to insure jobs for German immigrants. After a failed German Revolution in 1848, there was the greatest wave of political asylum seekers who left Germany. The majority of the German immigrants wanted to achieve, \\"The American Dream.\\" They wanted to be where soil was fertile and space was abundant. By the end of the 19th century, most immigrants were unmarried industrial workers, who came to the United States seeking seasonal work but never returned to Germany. Many immigrants would settle with or around others who spoke their native language or were from the same area of Germany. Many settled in the Midwest, where they became bakers, butchers, shoemakers, and cabinet makers. Germans also became high-profile businessmen and shopkeepers. The largest group of German immigrants were the skilled craftspeople. They immigrated to major cities such as Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and Chicago. In 1900, Kaiser Wilhelm II instituted the idea of national German pride. His influence was felt across the sea in the United States by way of a divided feeling of German-Americans on the stand of an imperialist Germany. This idea of loyalty was felt not only in the U.S., but in Germany as well. The Socialists felt that the Kaiser's power centered on a too militaristic reign. Millions of German-Americans held on to an attachment to the German language and culture. The 1830s through the 1870s saw a massive immigration of Germans to the U.S. resulting in an important ethnic German-born block of American society. The immigration explosion of youthful Germans resulted in a pro-imperialist view of Germany to the American public by way of the German-American press. 1901 saw the formation of the German- American alliance, a pressure group used to enforce propaganda geared to an imperial Germany upon politicians. The United States entry into World War I in 1917 caused an increase in abuse on German-Americans. The public opinion of the time rejected all forms of foreign language and culture. Thus, upon the eve of World War II, there was no form of Nazi propaganda, leaving the German- Americans to have no biased view on the war without public retaliation. To this day, there remain untold accounts of German-American internment camps during World War II.

He moved to the United States after the war. Biography In 1915, Moravec was drafted into Austro- Hungarian Army and sent to the Eastern Front, into Galicia. In September 1914, he fought at the Battle of Rawa. On 13 January 1915, Moravec was taken as prisoner by Russian troops and sent to the POW camp in Tsaritsyn. In 1916, he joined the Serbian Legion and fought in the Romanian Front, was moved from Archangel (Archangelsk) to Britain, and in 1917 joined the Czechoslovak Legions at the Salonica Front. In January 1918, the legions were sent to the Western Front in France and, in summer 1918, to the Italian Front. After the Great War, he was sent to Slovakia to fight against the Hungarian and the Slovak Soviet Republic. After 1919, Moravec served as an army officer in Pilsen (Plzeň) and in 1928 he joined the military intelligence service and moved to Prague. From 1937 to 1938, Moravec was deputy head of the service and head of its operations department, from January 1939 acting head of the service. In the evening of 14 March 1939, he and 10 of his fellow intelligence officers secretly managed to fly away with the most valuable intelligence files and archives from Prague Ruzyně Airport to London Croydon Airport with a stopover in Rotterdam on ad hoc chartered KLM Douglas DC-3, as they knew in advance from their secret agents operating in Nazi Germany that the invasion leading to German occupation of Czechoslovakia was to be on March 15, 1939 at 6 a.m. Rescued files and archives were handed over to the British MI6 to be used against Germany. In Great Britain from 1940 to 1945, Moravec served as the chief of the intelligence service of Czechoslovak Government in Exile. The headquarters of the military intelligence were in Porchester Gate in London, but from 1940 his private residence was in Addington, Buckinghamshire, near Aston Abbotts, where the exiled President of Czechoslovakia Edvard Beneš had his residence. Moravec maintained secret radio contact with the Czech anti- Nazi Resistance group known as Three Kings Group from 1939 to 1942. He co- ordinated the Czechoslovak co-operation with SOE. He participated in planning and preparation of Operation Anthropoid resulting in the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich. He also planned the assassination of his namesake Emanuel Moravec, a traitor and Nazi collaborator who was also known as the \\"Czech Quisling\\". František Moravec returned to Czechoslovakia in 1945 after the Nazi Germany defeat but left secretly again in 1948, shortly after the communist coup d'etat. He settled in the United States, where he worked until his death as an intelligence advisor in the US Department of Defense. Works * František Moravec (autobiography): Master of Spies, 1975, .

The solution to the Navier–Stokes equations for a parallel, laminar flow can become unstable if certain conditions on the flow are satisfied, and the Orr–Sommerfeld equation determines precisely what the conditions for hydrodynamic stability are. The equation is named after William McFadden Orr and Arnold Sommerfeld, who derived it at the beginning of the 20th century. Formulation A schematic diagram of the base state of the system. The flow under investigation represents a small perturbation away from this state. While the base state is parallel, the perturbation velocity has components in both directions. The equation is derived by solving a linearized version of the Navier–Stokes equation for the perturbation velocity field :\\\\mathbf{u} = \\\\left(U(z)+u'(x,z,t), 0 ,w'(x,z,t)\\\\right), where (U(z), 0, 0) is the unperturbed or basic flow. The perturbation velocity has the wave-like solution \\\\mathbf{u}' \\\\propto \\\\exp(i \\\\alpha (x - c t)) (real part understood). Using this knowledge, and the streamfunction representation for the flow, the following dimensional form of the Orr–Sommerfeld equation is obtained: :\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{i\\\\alpha\\\\rho} \\\\left({d^2 \\\\over d z^2} - \\\\alpha^2\\\\right)^2 \\\\varphi = (U - c)\\\\left({d^2 \\\\over d z^2} - \\\\alpha^2\\\\right) \\\\varphi - U \\\\varphi, where \\\\mu is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, \\\\rho is its density, and \\\\varphi is the potential or stream function. In the case of zero viscosity (\\\\mu=0), the equation reduces to Rayleigh's equation. The equation can be written in non- dimensional form by measuring velocities according to a scale set by some characteristic velocity U_0, and by measuring lengths according to channel depth h. Then the equation takes the form :{1 \\\\over i \\\\alpha \\\\, Re} \\\\left({d^2 \\\\over d z^2} - \\\\alpha^2\\\\right)^2 \\\\varphi = (U - c)\\\\left({d^2 \\\\over d z^2} - \\\\alpha^2\\\\right) \\\\varphi - U \\\\varphi, where :Re=\\\\frac{\\\\rho U_0 h}{\\\\mu} is the Reynolds number of the base flow. The relevant boundary conditions are the no- slip boundary conditions at the channel top and bottom z = z_1 and z = z_2, :\\\\alpha \\\\varphi = {d \\\\varphi \\\\over d z} = 0 at z = z_1 and z = z_2, in the case where \\\\varphi is the potential function. Or: :\\\\alpha \\\\varphi = {d \\\\varphi \\\\over d x} = 0 at z = z_1 and z = z_2, in the case where \\\\varphi is the stream function. The eigenvalue parameter of the problem is c and the eigenvector is \\\\varphi. If the imaginary part of the wave speed c is positive, then the base flow is unstable, and the small perturbation introduced to the system is amplified in time. Solutions For all but the simplest of velocity profiles U, numerical or asymptotic methods are required to calculate solutions. Some typical flow profiles are discussed below. In general, the spectrum of the equation is discrete and infinite for a bounded flow, while for unbounded flows (such as boundary-layer flow), the spectrum contains both continuous and discrete parts. The spectrum of the Orr–Sommerfeld operator for Poiseuille flow at criticality. Dispersion curves of the Poiseuille flow for various Reynolds numbers. For plane Poiseuille flow, it has been shown that the flow is unstable (i.e. one or more eigenvalues c has a positive imaginary part) for some \\\\alpha when Re > Re_c = 5772.22 and the neutrally stable mode at Re = Re_c having \\\\alpha_c = 1.02056, c_r = 0.264002. To see the stability properties of the system, it is customary to plot a dispersion curve, that is, a plot of the growth rate \\\\text{Im}(\\\\alpha{c}) as a function of the wavenumber \\\\alpha. The first figure shows the spectrum of the Orr–Sommerfeld equation at the critical values listed above. This is a plot of the eigenvalues (in the form \\\\lambda=-i\\\\alpha{c}) in the complex plane. The rightmost eigenvalue is the most unstable one. At the critical values of Reynolds number and wavenumber, the rightmost eigenvalue is exactly zero. For higher (lower) values of Reynolds number, the rightmost eigenvalue shifts into the positive (negative) half of the complex plane. Then, a fuller picture of the stability properties is given by a plot exhibiting the functional dependence of this eigenvalue; this is shown in the second figure. On the other hand, the spectrum of eigenvalues for Couette flow indicates stability, at all Reynolds numbers. However, in experiments, Couette flow is found to be unstable to small, but finite, perturbations for which the linear theory, and the Orr–Sommerfeld equation do not apply. It has been argued that the non- normality of the eigenvalue problem associated with Couette (and indeed, Poiseuille) flow might explain that observed instability. That is, the eigenfunctions of the Orr–Sommerfeld operator are complete but non-orthogonal. Then, the energy of the disturbance contains contributions from all eigenfunctions of the Orr–Sommerfeld equation. Even if the energy associated with each eigenvalue considered separately is decaying exponentially in time (as predicted by the Orr–Sommerfeld analysis for the Couette flow), the cross terms arising from the non-orthogonality of the eigenvalues can increase transiently. Thus, the total energy increases transiently (before tending asymptotically to zero). The argument is that if the magnitude of this transient growth is sufficiently large, it destabilizes the laminar flow, however this argument has not been universally accepted. A nonlinear theory explaining transition, has also been proposed. Although that theory does include linear transient growth, the focus is on 3D nonlinear processes that are strongly suspected to underlie transition to turbulence in shear flows. The theory has led to the construction of so-called complete 3D steady states, traveling waves and time-periodic solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations that capture many of the key features of transition and coherent structures observed in the near wall region of turbulent shear flows. Even though \\"solution\\" usually implies the existence of an analytical result, it is common practice in fluid mechanics to refer to numerical results as \\"solutions\\" - regardless of whether the approximated solutions satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations in a mathematically satisfactory way or not. It is postulated that transition to turbulence involves the dynamic state of the fluid evolving from one solution to the next. The theory is thus predicated upon the actual existence of such solutions (many of which have yet to be observed in a physical experimental setup). This relaxation on the requirement of exact solutions allows a great deal of flexibility, since exact solutions are extremely difficult to obtain (contrary to numerical solutions), at the expense of rigor and (possibly) correctness. Thus, even though not as rigorous as previous approaches to transition, it has gained immense popularity. An extension of the Orr–Sommerfeld equation to the flow in porous media has been recently suggested. Mathematical methods for free-surface flows For Couette flow, it is possible to make mathematical progress in the solution of the Orr–Sommerfeld equation. In this section, a demonstration of this method is given for the case of free-surface flow, that is, when the upper lid of the channel is replaced by a free surface. Note first of all that it is necessary to modify upper boundary conditions to take account of the free surface. In non-dimensional form, these conditions now read \\\\varphi={d \\\\varphi \\\\over d z}=0, at z = 0, \\\\frac{d^2\\\\varphi}{dz^2}+\\\\alpha^2\\\\varphi=0, \\\\Omega\\\\equiv\\\\frac{d^3\\\\varphi}{dz^3}+i\\\\alpha Re\\\\left[\\\\left(c-U\\\\left(z_2=1\\\\right)\\\\right)\\\\frac{d\\\\varphi}{dz}+\\\\varphi\\\\right]-i\\\\alpha Re\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{Fr}+\\\\frac{\\\\alpha^2}{We}\\\\right)\\\\frac{\\\\varphi}{c-U\\\\left(z_2=1\\\\right)}=0, at \\\\,z=1. The first free-surface condition is the statement of continuity of tangential stress, while the second condition relates the normal stress to the surface tension. Here :Fr=\\\\frac{U_0^2}{gh},\\\\,\\\\,\\\\ We=\\\\frac{\\\\rho u_0^2 h}{\\\\sigma} are the Froude and Weber numbers respectively. For Couette flow U\\\\left(z\\\\right)=z, the four linearly independent solutions to the non- dimensional Orr–Sommerfeld equation are, :\\\\chi_1\\\\left(z\\\\right)=\\\\sinh\\\\left(\\\\alpha z\\\\right),\\\\qquad \\\\chi_2\\\\left(z\\\\right)=\\\\cosh\\\\left(\\\\alpha z\\\\right), :\\\\chi_3\\\\left(z\\\\right)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha}\\\\int_\\\\infty^z\\\\sinh\\\\left[\\\\alpha\\\\left(z-\\\\xi\\\\right)\\\\right]Ai\\\\left[e^{i\\\\pi/6}\\\\left(\\\\alpha Re\\\\right)^{1/3}\\\\left(\\\\xi-c-\\\\frac{i\\\\alpha}{Re}\\\\right)\\\\right]d\\\\xi, :\\\\chi_4\\\\left(z\\\\right)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\alpha}\\\\int_\\\\infty^z\\\\sinh\\\\left[\\\\alpha\\\\left(z-\\\\xi\\\\right)\\\\right]Ai\\\\left[e^{5i\\\\pi/6}\\\\left(\\\\alpha Re\\\\right)^{1/3}\\\\left(\\\\xi-c-\\\\frac{i\\\\alpha}{Re}\\\\right)\\\\right]d\\\\xi, where Ai\\\\left(\\\\cdot\\\\right) is the Airy function of the first kind. Substitution of the superposition solution \\\\varphi=\\\\sum_{i=1}^4 c_i\\\\chi_i\\\\left(z\\\\right) into the four boundary conditions gives four equations in the four unknown constants c_i. For the equations to have a non-trivial solution, the determinant condition \\\\left\\\\begin{array}{cccc}\\\\chi_1\\\\left(0\\\\right)&\\\\chi_2\\\\left(0\\\\right)&\\\\chi_3\\\\left(0\\\\right)&\\\\chi_4\\\\left(0\\\\right)\\\\ \\\\chi_1'\\\\left(0\\\\right)&\\\\chi_2'\\\\left(0\\\\right)&\\\\chi_3'\\\\left(0\\\\right)&\\\\chi_4'\\\\left(0\\\\right)\\\\ \\\\Omega_1\\\\left(1\\\\right)&\\\\Omega_2\\\\left(1\\\\right)&\\\\Omega_3\\\\left(1\\\\right)&\\\\Omega_4\\\\left(1\\\\right)\\\\ \\\\chi_1\\\\left(1\\\\right)+\\\\alpha^2\\\\chi_1\\\\left(1\\\\right)&\\\\chi_2\\\\left(1\\\\right)+\\\\alpha^2\\\\chi_2\\\\left(1\\\\right)&\\\\chi_3\\\\left(1\\\\right)+\\\\alpha^2\\\\chi_3\\\\left(1\\\\right)&\\\\chi_4\\\\left(1\\\\right)+\\\\alpha^2\\\\chi_4\\\\left(1\\\\right)\\\\end{array}\\\\right=0 must be satisfied. This is a single equation in the unknown c, which can be solved numerically or by asymptotic methods. It can be shown that for a range of wavenumbers \\\\alpha and for sufficiently large Reynolds numbers, the growth rate \\\\alpha c_{\\\\text{i}} is positive.

It began in 1970 as the first charitable walking event in the United States.About March for Babies The name was changed after the 2007 event. March for Babies is held yearly in 1,100 communities across the nation. By 2013, over 7 million people, including more than 20,000 company and family teams as well as national sponsors, were expected to participate. The event has raised more than $2 billion since 1970. According to the March of Dimes, proceeds help fund research to prevent premature births, birth defects and infant mortality. Every year, more than half a million babies are born prematurely and more than 120,000 are born with serious birth defects in the United States.according to the March of Dimes Seventy-six cents of every dollar raised in March for Babies is spent on research and programs to help prevent these issues.March of Dimes — Where Your Money Goes Actually the very first March of Dimes walk a thon in the USA was held February 1969 in York, Pa with one person ( a radio personality with WSBA radio, Bob Woody) and raised over $26,000. History The very first March of Dimes walkathon occurred in San Antonio, Texas, on October 7, 1970, followed by similar walks in Ohio at Columbus on November 14 and Mentor (Lake County) on November 15. The weather conditions at the Columbus walkathon were depicted as \\"absolutely miserable [with] rain, cold and bone chilling winds, which did not abate at all during the walking period.\\" Yet the 500 walkers at Columbus pledged $64,687 to the March of Dimes, engendering a fund-raising methodology that quickly became national in scope and that perpetuated the enthusiasm of volunteers on which the foundation built its reputation. By 1974, 95% of March of Dimes chapters participated in the event, accounting for more than $14 million in revenue. Successful walkers received the Order of the Battered Boot certificate for their participation, and the foundation created a film, The Big Walk (1973), to document and promote the event. In 1979, the March of Dimes incorporated TeamWalk, inviting participation by teams of employees from other corporations, into the March for Babies strategy. On April 26, 1981, the foundation held the first walk occurring nationally on the same day billed as WalkAmerica and has since kept the tradition of holding the event on the last weekend in April. In 1991, Lee Iacocca, Chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, was the Honorary National March for Babies chairman. With increasing sophistication in promotion and marketing, each campaign was given a theme (and slogan) that merged fund-raising and mission objectives. Experience WalkAmerica was the campaign in 1991, followed by Walk for Healthier Babies (1993), Walk for Someone You Love (1995), and Be A Hero for the Tiniest Babies (2002) among others. March for Babies advertising and promotional literature thus became standardized around mission-related themes of perinatal health. In 1989, Tony Choppa became National Director of March for Babies and has further consolidated the foundation's fund-raising objectives on a national basis through central planning and chapter support. National corporate sponsors have included Lipton, Kellogg, K-Mart, Cigna, and Canon. The event has spawned wrap-around events to enhance fund-raising opportunities and spin-off events such as WonderWalk and WalkMania. Origin The first person to walk for the March of Dimes was John Harrison Finger, a textile worker in High Point, North Carolina. In 1948, his daughter came home from school and asked for a donation for the polio fund. Finger replied that he did not have the money but that he would raise some. In what is thought to be the first walkathon in March of Dimes history, Finger walked 32 miles — round trip from High Point to Greensboro — and collected a total of $1,700 in a red wagon he pulled behind him. During his lifetime he walked more than 1,000 miles and raised $15,832 to benefit the charity. The March of Dimes named Finger \\"Mr. WalkAmerica\\" in 1983.

The hospital is part of the Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and is a teaching hospital for the University of Newcastle upon Tyne.  History  Print of the old Newcastle upon Tyne Infirmary at Forth Banks in 1786 The original hospital was the Newcastle upon Tyne Infirmary at Forth Banks which was funded by way of public subscription. The foundation stone was laid by Joseph Butler, the Bishop of Durham, on 5 September 1751 and it opened on 8 October 1752. By the end of the 19th century, despite major extensions including the Dobson Wing which opened in 1855 and the Ravensworth Wards which opened in 1885, the infirmary became overcrowded and needed to be replaced. A new hospital to be known as the Royal Victoria Infirmary was designed by William Lister Newcomb and Percy Adams and built on of Town Moor given by the Corporation and Freemen of the City of Newcastle upon Tyne. It was opened by King Edward VII on 11 July 1906. The fully furnished and equipped hospital, containing seventeen wards, a nurses' home, chapel and five operating theatres, cost over £300,000. A statue of Queen Victoria in front of the new infirmary, sculpted by Sir George James Frampton in white stone, was the gift of Sir Riley Lord, who was knighted for his efforts in getting the infirmary built. The infirmary became a unit of the First Northern General Hospital and treated wounded service personnel during the First World War. The Royal Victoria Infirmary had close links with King's College, Durham and, after it was formed, with Newcastle University as a major teaching hospital from when the university medical school was opened by King George VI in 1939. Overcrowding was a problem, with waiting lists of over 5,000 in the 1930s and, until it joined the National Health Service in 1948, money had to be raised for extensions and new equipment - always difficult especially in the depression years. Later additions to the hospital included the Dental Hospital and School in 1978 and the Medical School in 1985. These additions were followed by Leazes Wing (facing Leazes Park) in 1992, the Sir James Spence Institute (named after Sir James Spence, a leading pediatrician) in 1994 and the Claremont Wing (on Claremont Road) in 1996. Although the Peacock Hall (the main administrative building) survived, many of the Edwardian buildings, including the old Eastern Block, were demolished at this time to make way for the new structures. The late 20th century also brought consolidation of medical services in the city including the transfer to the infirmary of children's services from the Fleming Memorial Hospital in 1988 and of maternity services from the Princess Mary Maternity Hospital in 1993. A major expansion of the site, including the New Victoria Wing, which includes a state-of-the-art accident and emergency department replacing that of the Newcastle General Hospital, and a new children's facility known as the Great North Children's Hospital was procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract in 2005. It was built by Laing O'Rourke at a cost of £150 million and opened in 2010. Facilities The hospital has three main wings: the Leazes Wing, the Claremont Wing and the New Victoria Wing. The Great North Children's Hospital, one of only fourteen major children's medical centres in the UK, adjoins the New Victoria Wing. The infirmary is also the only provider of Mohs micrographic surgery for skin cancer in the North East of England.

The cemetery is built on a bluff overlooking the Kentucky River with views of the Kentucky State Capitol, the Kentucky Governor's Mansion, downtown Frankfort, south Frankfort, and the Capitol District. History The cemetery was created by Judge Mason Brown, son of statesman John Brown, inspired by a visit to Mount Auburn Cemetery in Boston. Brown enlisted other Frankfort civic leaders and on February 27, 1844 the Kentucky General Assembly approved the cemetery's incorporation. The property, then called Hunter's Garden, was purchased in 1845 for $3,801. Additional land was purchased in 1858 and in 1911 for a total of . Brown hired Scottish-born landscape architect Robert Carmichael to design the cemetery. The cemetery is laid out in a style similar to Mount Auburn, with curving lanes, terraces and a circle of vaults.

A relatively successful jump jockey, Nicholls has become the leading National Hunt trainer of his generation, finishing the 2007–08 season with 155 winners and a record £4 million in prize money. To date, he has trained over 3000 winners, won the 2012 Grand National, four Cheltenham Gold Cups and has been crowned British jump racing Champion Trainer eleven times. Early life The son of a policeman, Nicholls was educated at Marlwood School, Alveston before leaving at 16 to take up work in a local point-to-point yard. Jockey career Nicholls turned conditional in 1982 under the tutelage of Josh Gifford before joining David Barons in 1985, and became stable jockey in 1986. It was with Barons that Nicholls was most closely associated during his riding career. The pair enjoyed numerous big race successes, including back-to-back wins in the Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury with Broadheath in 1986 and Playschool the following year. Playschool also won the 1987 Welsh Grand National, and the 1988 Irish Hennessey with Nicholls. Playschool was subsequently made favourite for the 1988 Cheltenham Gold CupDeep Bramble pricks Nicholls' memories The Independent, 9 March 1995 but was pulled up before the 20th fence. Barons attributed Playschool's lacklustre performance to doping but his claims were never substantiated. Following a broken leg when kicked by a horse during pre- season training sustained in 1989, Nicholls retired from the saddle having ridden a respectable 133 winners during a seven-year career.Harry Derham, nephew of champion trainer Paul Nicholls, aims to become professional jockey Gazette Series, 4 November 2010 Training career Nicholls took out his trainer's licence in 1991, having served a two-year apprenticeship as assistant trainer to Barons which saw him assist in Seagram's winning Grand National attempt.The Kauto Star story BBC Sport, 1 March 2012 In response to an advert placed in the Sporting Life, Nicholls began his training operation at Manor Farm, Ditcheat, in stables rented from local dairy farmer Paul Barber. Starting with just eight horses,Nicholls' mark etched in Stone The Independent, 6 November 2011 his first winner soon followed, the appropriately named Olveston, owned by Nicholls' father and named after the South Gloucestershire village in which he was raised. A steady climb up the training ladder followed, with Nicholls' first grade one success coming with See More Indians in the Feltham Novices' Chase at Kempton in 1993. However, it was the 1999 Cheltenham Festival that saw Nicholls' breakthrough into jump racing's elite, winning three of the most prestigious steeplechases in National Hunt racing. Nicholls enjoyed a memorable meeting, collecting the Queen Mother Champion Chase with Call Equiname,Paul Nicholls BBC Sport, 10 November 2003 the Arkle Challenge Trophy with Flagship Uberalles, and the Gold Cup with See More Business. However, it was not until the end of the 2005–06 season, after seven years of filling the runners up spot that Nicholls was finally crowned Champion Trainer for the first time, his eventual coronation coming after a long struggle for supremacy with multiple champion Martin Pipe. The appointment of the Irish rider Ruby Walsh as stable jockey strengthened Nicholls' hand in the big races.

Obtaining this color requires substantial modification to the method of manufacture, and because of this, it is somewhat more expensive than the gray product. Uses White Portland cement is used in combination with white aggregates to produce white concrete for prestige construction projects and decorative work. White concrete usually takes the form of pre-cast cladding panels, since it is not economical to use white cement for structural purposes. White Portland cement is also used in combination with inorganic pigments to produce brightly colored concretes and mortars. Ordinary cement, when used with pigments, produces colors that may be attractive, but are somewhat dull. With white cement, bright reds, yellows and greens can be readily produced. Blue concrete can also be made, at some expense. The pigments may be added at the concrete mixer. Alternatively, to guarantee repeatable color, some manufacturers supply ready-blended colored cements, using white cement as a base. The whiteness of WOPC is measured as the powdered material having a reflectance value (\\"L value\\") in excess of 85%. A particular success in the use of WOPC and added pigments is monocouche renders. In some countries an off-white clinker, which gives a reflectance value over 70 when ground, is produced at a cost only a little over normal gray clinker. When this is blended with ground blast furnace slag (up to 60% depending on use and early strength) a cement with reflectance over 80 can be produced. The blended cement can have a production cost less than General Purpose Portland cement (gray), but normally attracts a margin as it is sold to compete with white Portland cement.  Manufacture =Raw mix formulation The characteristic greenish-gray to brown color of ordinary Portland cement derives from a number of transition elements in its chemical composition. These are, in decreasing order of coloring effect, chromium, manganese, iron, copper, vanadium, nickel and titanium. The amount of these in white cement is minimized as far as possible. Cr2O3 is kept below 0.003%, Mn2O3 is kept below 0.03%, and Fe2O3 is kept below 0.35% in the clinker. The other elements are usually not a significant problem. Portland cement is usually made from cheap, quarried raw materials, and these usually contain substantial amounts of Cr, Mn and Fe. For example, limestones used in cement manufacture usually contain 0.3-1% Fe2O3, whereas levels below 0.1% are sought in limestones for white manufacture. Typical clays used in gray cement rawmix may contain 5-15% Fe2O3. Levels below 0.5% are desirable, and conventional clays are usually replaced with kaolin. Kaolin is fairly low in SiO2, and so a large amount of sand is usually also included in the mix. Iron and manganese usually occur together in nature, so that selection of low-iron materials usually ensures that manganese content is also low, but chromium can arise from other sources, notably from the wear of chrome steel grinding equipment during the production of rawmix. See rawmill. This wear is exacerbated by the high sand-content of the mix, which makes it extremely abrasive. Furthermore, to make a combinable rawmix, the sand must be ground to below 45 μm particle diameter. Often this is achieved by grinding the sand separately, using ceramic grinding media to limit the chromium contamination. With off-white clinker the calculated Fe2O3 level in clinker is higher (0.6-0.8%) Coal can be used (if the ash has little Fe2O3 or other trace elements). The ash in the coal is helpful in the reaction because it is finer than the ground raw materials and it reaches higher temperatures and is molten in the flame. Kaolin is sometimes found in association with coal deposits. It may be possible to use coal washery waste, oil shale and spent oil shale ash. Off- white clinker has a calculated C3A (tricalcium aluminate) of 7-9%. When blended with ground granulated blast furnace slag it can meet requirements for sulfate resistance and low heat. Kiln operation In general, the rotary kilns used to chemically combine the raw materials are operated at a higher peak temperature (1600°C) than that required for gray clinker manufacture (1450°C). This requires a higher fuel consumption (typically 20-50% more), and results in lower kiln output (typically 20-50% less) for a given sized kiln. The reason for this is the relatively small amount of molten liquid produced during sintering, because of the low iron-content of the mix. The final reaction in the kiln, conversion of belite to alite, requires the melt liquid as a solvent, and is slower if the amount of melt is low. This can be partially compensated by adding to the rawmix a combination of calcium and fluoride in the form of calcium fluoride or waste cryolite. This combination lowers the melting temperature. In cases where the clinker Fe2O3 content is above 0.2% (which is almost always the case), the unique processes of \\"bleaching\\" and \\"quenching\\" are also employed. \\"Bleaching\\" involves directing a second flame (apart from that used to heat the kiln) onto the bed of clinker close to the kiln exit to reduce Fe(III) to Fe(II). This reduction is rigorously avoided in gray cement production, because of the deleterious effect it can have on clinker quality. But in white clinker production, where the iron content is low, this is not an issue. Subsequently, to prevent the re-oxidation of the iron, \\"quenching\\" is performed. This consists of rapidly lowering the clinker temperature from 1200°C to below 600°C in a few seconds, as it leaves the kiln. This usually involves dropping it into water and removing it quickly with a screw or passing it through a curtain of water sprays. This contributes to the relatively poor energy efficiency of the process, since the sensible heat of the clinker is not recycled as in normal clinker manufacturer. The temperature in the kiln is not necessarily higher than gray clinker production but it appears higher due to the reflectance especially in gas fired kilns (which do have a higher flame temperature). With off-white clinker coal firing can be used which has many advantages for costs and output. It is important to finely grind the coal and have a burner which gives a very short bright flame (high velocity low primary air) so that the excess oxygen can be kept low close to zero with maybe 0.1% CO. There is no need for a second flame if combustion in the coal flame is rapid and controlled. The Off-white clinker has a light greenish colour due to Fe(II). Rotary kilns have limitations on output based on the surface area required for the heat transfer. Few old kiln process can reach the surface area limits due to limits in auxiliary equipment such as fuel input (e.g. lack of precalcination), grinding of coal and raw materials, exhaust fan capacity, chemical control of raw mix, burner quality, kiln control etc. With well operated off-white clinker production kiln output can be only a few percent lower than gray clinker production. Clinker grinding and handling The clinker is next ground to cement (perhaps after a drying stage). Here calcium sulfate is added to control set, in the form of a high-purity grade of gypsum or anhydrite. In some specifications (not ASTM), a small amount of titanium dioxide may be added to improve reflectance. At all stages, great care is needed to avoid contamination with colored materials. Specifications White Portland cement differs physically from gray cement only in terms of its color. Its setting behavior and strength development are essentially the same as that expected in gray cement, and it meets standard specifications such as ASTM C 150 and EN 197. In practice, because much white cement is used in pre- cast concrete products, it is commonly made to a high-early strength specification such as ASTM C 150 Type III. This aids concrete manufacturers' production rate. Higher potential strength also helps to counteract the strength-diminishing effects of pigment addition. In addition to the usual specifications, manufacturers guarantee the whiteness of the product, typically in terms of a reflectance measurement, such as L*a*b L-value, or tristimulus. In the latter case, because off-color white cement tends to be greenish, the Tri-Y (green) value is used. Because the color so much depends upon the \\"bleaching\\" and \\"quenching\\" operations, merely specifying a low iron content does not guarantee good whiteness.

Munnich The first dedicated transfusion service in Scotland was formed at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh in the 1930s. The Edinburgh Blood Transfusion Service (EBTS) was established in 1936 with Jack Copland as Organiser and Helen White as Secretary. Helen White took over as Organiser in 1940 when Copland moved into a national role. The first meeting of the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Associsation (SNBTA) took place in Edinburgh in February 1940.  Key Personnel  In the 1940s Helen White played a key role in the development of the blood donor service in Edinburgh and throughout Scotland, on her initiative a network of voluntary organisers was established. The network was characterised by its friendliness and the care she took in making voluntary donation an enjoyable activity. Centres There are five blood centres, in Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Inverness. The SNBTS also has several mobile units that travel to the remote centres and communities. These are usually set up in village halls and community centres. They tend to return approximately every 13 weeks, which can allow for up to four donations each year. In November 2011 it was announced that a new national centre would be built within the Heriot-Watt research park in Edinburgh, and would include labs, offices and other facilities. By October 2014, construction work had begun on the new £43 million facility. The new centre is due to be completed in 2017 and has been funded using the Scottish Government’s Non Profit Distributing (NPD) model.

Such guided modes are also called \\"leaky modes\\", as they do not remain guided, and have been observed in one and two- dimensional photonic crystal slabs. Grating coupler An example of guided- mode resonance is a grating coupler, which is a region on top of or below a waveguide where there is a grating. Off-resonance light incident on the grating behaves almost the same as it would if it was incident in an area where there is no grating. Waveguides are usually made of dielectric and are transparent. For specific combinations of incident angles and light frequency, there is resonance, allowing the grating to couple light into a guided mode of the waveguide. Typically, the grating coupler has only a few periods, so light can be coupled into the waveguide, but not back out. In such a case, light will be guided in the waveguide until it reaches the waveguide edge, or an additional coupling element, which will couple the light out. The larger the diffraction efficiency of the grating, the larger percent of light that would be coupled in. If the grating is used as a coupling-out element, the larger the diffraction efficiency, the fewer periods would be needed to couple the light out. Grating waveguide structures A grating coupler that is extended over the whole surface of the grating results in a combined structure sometimes called a grating waveguide structure. In such a structure, light cannot be guided, as any light coupled in is also coupled out. At resonance, a normally transparent structure becomes reflective. If the grating period is sub-wavelength, then the normally-transparent structure becomes a mirror under resonance conditions. These conditions include the angle, frequency (wavelength), and polarization of the incident light. At resonance, there is also a much higher intensity in the waveguide region. Such intensities are called evanescent as they decay exponentially outside of the waveguide region. The guided mode resonance can be used to design filters and sensors.

Originally from Omaha, Nebraska, the band was founded in 2003 by Chris Petersen, the band's primary songwriter, as a direct contrast to the overcrowded metalcore and death metal scenes of the American Midwest. The band has had multiple lineup changes since its inception, but is now rounded out by founder Chris Petersen, drummer Nick McCallister, keyboardist Diego Valadez, and guitarist Eric Meyers. In 2005 the band signed to Metal Blade Records after playing a show with The Black Dahlia Murder. Biography Cellador's debut album Enter Deception was released in 2006. The band recorded the album at Erik Rutan's Mana Studios. In an article from the December 2006 issue of Metal Maniacs magazine, Chris Petersen says he created the band name in reference to a J.R.R. Tolkien essay which stated that the two words cellar and door have an appealing sound when combined. Petersen also said that the band was originally called \\"Apostate\\", but the name was later changed to Cellador because he felt it was more fitting for the band. Cellador has toured across the United States, Canada and Mexico with bands such as Trivium, Bullet for My Valentine, All that Remains, Protest the Hero, The Human Abstract, The Sword, Behemoth, and Sonata Arctica. They have also performed at the ProgPower USA festival in Atlanta, Georgia, as well as the LoudPark festival in Japan, among many others. The band went into hiatus in the year 2009 after several members of the \\"Enter Deception\\" era lineup left the band. In 2011 after 2 years without any updates, the band quietly released 4 demo songs online from their upcoming EP entitled \\"Honor Forth.\\" Led by guitarist/songwriter Chris Petersen, the band held continuous auditions for the entirety of 2009-2012 and ultimately reformed with bass player James Pickett, drummer Nick Mccallister, keyboardist Diego Valadez, and guitarist Caleb Delaet. Petersen officially took up the lead vocalist position in 2012. In December 2012, the band announced new live shows beginning in 2013. They spent the entirety of the year establishing in the Colorado area, and playing one-off shows as guest openers for Havok, Into Eternity, Helloween, Shining, Vale of Pnath, Amaranthe, and others. In early 2014 long time guitarist, Caleb Delaet, left the band, and afterwards the band began recording the second LP, Off the Grid, which Chris Petersen had to take full control over the guitars for the recording process. Recording for the album was wrapped up in the summer of 2015. In late 2015, guitarist Eric Meyers was brought in to fill the second guitar position. Afterwards they went on to play Denver shows for the remainder of the year. In 2016, Cellador was opening up for bands such as Huntress, Anvil, Queensryche, and more. During the summer of 2016 long time bassist, James Pickett, left the band. Shortly thereafter, Cellador went on to sign with Italian record label Scarlet Records. In 2017, bassist Chris Davila was temporarily brought in to help with the promotion for their upcoming album, such as performing in live shows and a music video. Off the Grid was officially released on March 10. After their second LP release, Cellador shot a music video for one of the Off the Grid singles, Break Heresy. They went on to open up for acts such as Yngwie Malmsteen, and played in the 2017 Evoken Music Festival in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan. The band is currently in the process of writing and recording a third album.

It is billed as a 'pick-up' game that can be played quickly, with little preparation. Gameplay Spirit of the Century is a pulp action game. The gorilla in a biplane on the cover is one of the sample player characters. Setting The game is set in the pulp era of the 1920s. Player characters are 'Centurions': 'potent individuals of action', born on the first day of the century, and endowed with extraordinary skills and abilities, much like Warren Ellis's conception of Century Babies in the Wildstorm comics universe. It has been released under the OGL with a freely accessible System Reference Document.Spirit of the Century SRD Part of the setting is created in character generation; all characters have ten free- form aspects that have an effect on the game and on the world. Each character gains two aspects from their background, two from what they did in the Great War, and a further two from the stories that would make up an imaginary novel about their life before the game started. They then get a further four aspects by guest starring in two of the other PCs' novels for two aspects apiece. Rules Spirit of the Century uses the Fate 3 engine, meaning that all rolls are made by rolling four Fudge dice and adding the character's skill to find the outcome. In addition to the skills, all characters have aspects that can be invoked at the cost of a Fate Point for a bonus or compelled by the GM to gain a Fate Point in exchange for doing something bad for the character (such Fate Points may be refused at the cost of a further Fate Point). Also all characters have a number of stunts that represent things they can do that go above and beyond normal capabilities. Development The game marks the first appearance of Evil Hat's FATE 3rd Edition, which was also designed for Evil Hat's The Dresden Files Roleplaying Game.Where'd We Go - Evil Hat Productions Reception It was released to positive reviews, quickly reaching #1 on RPGnet's rankings. Spirit of the Century won the 2006 Indie RPG Award for Independent Game of the Year and also won the 2007 Silver ENnie Award for Best Rules.

The station broadcasts at the assigned frequency of 105.5 MHz with an erp of 6,000 watts. History The call letters WBMI first were used by a station in Meriden, Connecticut. That station has been WKSS since 1977 and has had a Top-40 format since 1984. Early history as WBMB WBMI of West Branch, Michigan was the FM sister station of WBMB-AM, which first signed on the air June 7, 1972 at 1060 kHz with 1,000 watts output power, from transmitter facilities at 1245 Gray Road in West Branch. The construction permit for WBMB was first granted January 12, 1968, but encountered a delay due to a competing application from another applicant in August of that same year. Construction resumed in July 1971, after Ogemaw Broadcasting Company ultimately prevailed in legal proceedings. The station was owned by Ogemaw Broadcasting Company, with studios located at 206 W. Houghton Avenue in West Branch. Gene Kauffman, an Escanaba resident, was the president and general manager. The station was owned by Jack E. (Gene) Kauffman, Dean W. Manley and Robert Marshall. Manley was the chief engineer who designed and built the station, Marshall was owner and publisher of the Ogemaw County Herald. Kauffman and Manley were each 25% owners and Marshall 50%. WBMI signs on WBMB was a daytime-only AM station for its entire existence. In 1977, Ogemaw Broadcasting Company was granted a construction permit to put WBMI on the air, under Ogemaw Broadcasting's ownership. Studios and offices were then moved down the street to 714 W. Houghton Avenue. WBMI signed on the air in 1980. WBMB and WBMI were a typical small-market radio station of their time, with few employees working shared duties, world and national news provided by Westwood One, and a mass appeal format of adult contemporary and oldies music on WBMB, with WBMI leaning more of a Top 40 sound. The two stations for a time, simulcast programming as WBMB was not able to provide listeners with local radio service at night. Sale and Decline The stations were sold to David Swittek, a TV engineer from Bay City, Michigan on a terms contract. He defaulted on the contract A few years later, On November 20, 1985, both stations were sold to Ashuelot Broadcasting, a company headed by Gene Flowers, who once served as general manager under Ogemaw Broadcasting's ownership. By this time, both stations simulcast each other 100 percent and switched to an adult contemporary format. The stations were then again owned by Jack E. Kauffman and Robert S. Marshall, who assumed control when the previous owner declared bankruptcy on November 1, 1989, with Michael Baker assuming the role of president and general manager. The stations then went dark in 1991. Rebirth In the summer of 1993, WBMI returned to the air as \\"Kool FM 105.5\\" with the format provided via satellite by Jones Radio Network after being sold to Ives Broadcasting of Alpena, which also owned adult contemporary-CHR formatted WHSB (Bay 108). Ives' intent was to cross- market several stations calling them the \\"Northern Radio Network\\". On-air functions originated from WHSB's studio location in Alpena, with no local presence in West Branch other than the transmitting antenna. WBMB did not return to the air with WBMI, and under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, still having not returned to the air, its license was permanently canceled. In March 1999, the license for WBMI was transferred from Ives Broadcasting to Northern Radio Network, with no changes in ownership. The Northern Radio Network effort ended in October 2000, with WBMI going silent once again. The following year, WBMI was sold to Independent TV Productions. Independent TV Productions resumed WBMI's operations with Jones Radio Network's Hot AC format. During this time, the station imaged itself with various monikers, such as \\"Kool Mix 105.5\\" and \\"Channel 105.5.\\" A few years later WBMI returned to oldies and then changed to classic country, all also satellite-fed from Jones. In July 2005, industry sources reported that husband and wife Kevin and Alana Beamish, of Owosso, Michigan agreed to purchase the station for $300,000.Deals - 2006-04-01 00:00:00  Broadcasting & Cable In August 2005, a filing was submitted to transfer the license to a minority shareholder (Peggy Warner) on the basis that she had loaned money to the company. The transfer application included an agreement written by Mrs Warner purporting to transfer the license and related assets to herself.ASSIGNMENT The FCC dismissed the application.Application Search Details Three days later, the application to transfer control of the license to the Beamishes was submitted and approved by the FCC, but the transfer was never consummated and the license stayed in the name of Independent TV Productions.Application Search Details In April 2008, the license was successfully transferred to Peggy Warner. Management duties were assumed by longtime northern Michigan radio personality Charlie Cobb, a longtime fixture at WKKM.Application Search Details In August 2011, Cobb and Michael Fleming, entered into an agreement to purchase WBMI from Warner under the name CF Broadcasting, for $360,000. The FCC approved the sale on October 6, 2011. Legal issues In August 2019 CF Broadcasting attempted to transfer ownership of WBMI to a separate company also owned by Cobb and Fleming. That resulted in a lawsuit from Peggy Warner accusing CF Broadcasting of non-payment. A court-appointed receiver then took the station silent on January 25, 2020. On August 6, 2020 an Ogemaw County judge returned ownership of the station to Ms. Warner in return for her dropping a claim against property owned by Mr. Fleming. The station still has yet to resume operations.

I think that’s been done enough! I like the songs I can really put my heart and soul into. That’s what makes it soul.

Building history Colombia began a skyscraper building era in the 1960s in Medellín. The Coltejer Building was designed by architects Raúl Fajardo, Aníbal Saldarriaga, Germán Samper, and Jorge Manjarres. Its construction required the demolition of the \\"Junin\\" theatre and the \\"Europa Hotel\\" building. With a height of , the Coltejer Building is the fourth-tallest building in Colombia. It is said to resemble a sewing machine needle, representing the textile company after which it is named.

Coltejer A view of Botero Plaza and the Coltejer building in the background from the Museum of Antioquia History The Echavarría family were the founders of two textile companies, Coltejer and Fabricato, and were also involved in coffee exportation and importation of other goods. In 1907, Alejandro Echavarría decided to import four power looms, which he put to work along with twelve workers in the patio of his coffee-processing plant. This was the beginning of Coltejer. During the Depression era, Coltejer bought discarded looms cheaply from the United States that were brought in on muleback. During World War II, Coltejer was operating some 70,000 spindles and 1,900 looms, employing 4,000 workers in its Medellin plant in addition to those at Envigado. Production Coltejer's profits increased by a factor of twenty between 1940 and 1949, from 830,000 pesos to 16,520,000. Coltejer has a total fabric production capacity of about 60 million metres, of which 90% is used to produce clothing and 10% is to make home textiles. It is also one of the leading denim producers in Colombia. Coltejer works with 67 exclusive distributors and 77 wholesalers in Colombia.

It was unusual in that it housed both Allied prisoners of war (POWs) and civilian internees. The camp, which operated from March 1942 until the liberation of the camp in September 1945, was housed in buildings that were originally British Indian Army barracks. The original area was extended by the Japanese, until it covered about 50 acres (20 hectares).Firkins 115 The camp population fluctuated, due to movement of prisoners between camps in Borneo, and as a result of the deaths of the prisoners. It had a maximum population of some 3,000 prisoners.Keith 76 Life in the camp was harsh, with POWs and internees alike forced to endure food shortages, disease and sickness for which scant medicine was made available, forced labour, brutal treatment, and lack of adequate clothing and living quarters. Of the approximately 2,000 British POWs held there, over two-thirds died during or as a result of their captivity.Ooi 1998, 636 The construction and operation of a secret radio receiver for over 2½ years, from February 1943 until the liberation of the camp, was a morale booster and allowed the prisoners to follow the progress of the war. Discovery would have resulted in certain death for those involved. Following the unconditional surrender of Japan on 15 August 1945, the camp was liberated on 11 September 1945 by the Australian 9th Division. On liberation, the camp population was 2,024, of whom 1,392 were POWs, 395 were male civilian internees and 237 were civilian women and children. Amongst official Japanese papers found at the camp following its liberation were two \\"death orders\\". Both described the proposed method of execution of every POW and internee in the camp. The first order, scheduled for enactment on 17 or 18 August, was not carried out; the second was scheduled to take place on 15 September. The timely liberation of the camp may have prevented the murder of over 2,000 men, women and children. In July 1948, a teachers' training college moved to the site, where it continues to this day, the oldest such establishment in Malaysia. Location and organisation Kuching lies some up the Sarawak River from the sea;Keith 75 the camp was situated some to the southeast of Kuching.Ooi 1998, 8 The barracks were built by the Sarawak Government in early 1941, when Britain, in agreement with the Rajah of Sarawak, sent the 2nd Battalion, 15th Punjab Regiment of the British Indian Army (2/15th Punjab Regiment) to defend Sarawak in case of attack by the Japanese. The camp, known from its inception as Batu Lintang, was near completion for occupation by May 1941.Kirby 1969, Appendix 30; Lim 1995, 19; Lim 2005, 34 The Japanese first invaded the island of Borneo in mid December 1941, landing on the west coast near Miri;Ooi 1998, 6–7 invasion was completed by 23 January 1942 when they landed at Balikpapan on the east coast.Wigmore 179 The first Allied prisoners held in the camp were about 340 British and Indian soldiers who were interned there in mid-March 1942. In time, it held both Allied POWs and Allied civilian internees. Local Sarawakians including ethnic Chinese were not interned in the camp, although some were imprisoned in Kuching gaol.Three Chinese men from North Borneo, all staff at the Chinese Consulate at Sandakan, and their families were held in the camp: Mr Huan Lai Cho (the Chinese Consul), his wife and two children; Mr Ting Yuan Li and his wife and child, and Mr Philip Yang; a total of eight Chinese people interned in the camp. Allied civilian prisoners came almost exclusively from different territories on Borneo: from North Borneo (now Sabah), from Brunei, from the Straits Settlements island of Labuan, and from Sarawak, all of which were under British control, and from Dutch Borneo (now Kalimantan). In contrast, the POWs were brought to Batu Lintang from places such as mainland Malaya and Java as well as from Borneo. Many spent time at transit or temporary camps, such as the one at Berhala Island, North Borneo, prior to their transfer to Batu Lintang.Ooi 1998, 286 The camp officially opened on 15 August 1942, at which time a commemoration stone was erected at the camp.Keith 180; Australian War Memorial (AWM) photograph 120332 The camp commander, Lt.-Col. Tatsuji Suga (right) with Brigadier Thomas Eastick (left) and Lt.-Col. A. W. Walsh (centre) shortly after the liberation of Batu Lintang on 11 September 1945. Suga killed himself five days later. The camp commandant was Lieutenant-Colonel (Lt.-Col.) Tatsuji Suga. Suga was the commandant of all POW and internees’ camps in Borneo; there were others at Jesselton (later Kota Kinabalu), Sandakan and briefly on Labuan islandWigmore 595 note 9 and also at Tarakan, Banjarmasin and Kandangan; Suga was often absent from Batu Lintang as a result. His second-in-command was Lieutenant (later Captain) Nagata; some sources say Negata or Nekata. Most of the camp guards were Koreans, with a few Formosans (Taiwanese). There was a range of administrative buildings, quartermaster’s stores, guard houses, guards’ quarters and a camp hospital. Throughout its operation, all the camps at Batu Lintang, including the internee ones, were conducted under prisoner-of-war rules.Keith 83 The entire camp was surrounded by a perimeter barbed wire fence. The internees were segregated into categories and assigned separate compounds, each of which was also surrounded by barbed wire fencing. There were 8–10 compounds,Kirby 1969, Appendix 30 although their make-up varied through the period of operation of the camp.At the beginning the British officers shared with the British Other Ranks, but were later separated into two compounds; at one point the Indonesian soldiers and the Dutch officers were sharing a compound, whilst at another they were in separate compounds; the Indian POWs were kept in different locations over the period of the operation of the camp. (Ooi 1998, 139, 317) The make-up was determined by the arrival and departure of different groups of prisoners as Batu Lintang camp was also used as a transit camp: at one point some of the Australian and British soldiers who were later to die on the Sandakan Death Marches were held at the camp.Ooi 1998, 320–1, 384–5; Wigmore 596 Contact between the inhabitants of the different compounds was forbidden and transgressors were severely punished. The main groups of POWs were British officers, Australian officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs), Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) officers, British Other Ranks, British Indian Army (2nd/15th Punjab Regiment) personnel, Netherlands East Indies (Indonesian) KNIL soldiers. The British and Australian personnel had mostly been sent from Malaya and Singapore, after the Allied surrender there, whereas the KNIL soldiers and the Punjab Regiment had defended Borneo. The civilian internees were mostly Dutch Roman Catholic priests, British civilians (including children), and British and Dutch Catholic nuns. There were a handful of Chinese and Eurasian civilian internees. Each compound had its own \\"camp master\\" (or \\"camp mistress\\", in the case of the women's compound). The camp master was responsible for liaising between the internees and the Japanese authorities. Each compound contained a number of long barrack buildings, usually , each of which housed 30–100 people. A barrack master was appointed for each building. The camp and barrack masters were appointed by Colonel Suga. In addition, the Dutch other ranks and about 50 British soldiers were stationed in a separate compound at the Kampong Batu Tujoh airfield (also known as Bukit Stabah), near Kuching.Ooi 1998, 317, 399–400 The camp included areas that had once been a rubber tree plantation, and some of the trees remained inside the compounds, providing a limited amount of shade. Compounds One of the barracks in the Australian officers' camp. This building housed about 60 officers. Living conditions within the compounds were cramped. Each person was allotted a very small space within a barrack building within which to sleep, keep the few personal possessions they had with them, and also to eat, as there was no communal area within the barracks. ;British officers and NCOs: This was described as \\"perhaps the most commodious\\" compound, with a fair amount of workable land.Ooi 1998, 317 At first the officers were with the British other ranks, but they were separated out into this compound on 5 February 1943. Including the three huts, the compound was 2½ acres (1 ha) in area with 1½ acres (0.6 ha) of cultivable land. The Officer in Charge and overall British Military Authority was Lt.-Col. M. C. Russell, until his death on 5 June 1943; Lt.-Col T. C. Whimster took over the role thereafter. The compound held 134 men in September 1944.Ooi 1998, 351 ;Australian officers and NCOs: On liberation, 178 Australian officers and NCOs were held at Batu Lintang,Kirby 1969 Appendix 30; pace Wigmore (1957) 599 who gives the figure as 169 (149 officers and 20 other ranks) in a compound which was without sufficient land for cultivation. The Officer in Charge was Lt.-Col. A. W. Walsh. The Australian other ranks were held in a camp at Sandakan. ;Dutch officers and NCOs: This was without sufficient land for cultivation. The Officer in Charge was Lt.-Col. Mars. ;British other ranks: British soldiers were \\"kept in grossly over-crowded barracks, with inadequate kitchen, lighting, water and sanitary services.\\" They had no land for cultivation.Lim 2005, 266–7 Initially the compound held 1,500 POWs, with additional soldiers arriving thereafter taking the total to around 2,000, but by the end of the war the figure had been reduced to about 750. The Officer in Charge was RSM (later 2nd Lt) S. T. Sunderland. ;British Indian Army other ranks: Soldiers from 2nd/15th Punjab Regiment were interned at Batu Lintang. The Indian POWs were housed in two huts, with no land for cultivation. ;KNIL soldiers: Indonesian soldiers were housed in a small compound close to the British other ranks' compound. Priests waiting to welcome the liberating forces, 11 September 1945 ;Roman Catholic priests and religious men: The Catholic priests, brothers and religious men, mostly Dutch and Irish, lived in a separate compound, with a large plot of land to grow vegetables. They numbered 110, including 44 Capuchin friars, 5 Mountfort missionaries, 22 Broeders van Huijbergen (Brothers of Huijbergen) and 38 Mill Hill Missionaries.Lim 2005, 251–2 At liberation, there were 395 civilian men, which included the priests. ;Male civilian internees and some boys: In 1943, approximately 250 male civilian internees (excluding Roman Catholic Mission personnel) were held in this compound. From July 1942 until 14 November 1944 the camp master was C. D. Le Gros Clark (brother of Wilfrid Le Gros Clark), the former Chief Secretary, Sarawak Government; Lt.-Col. W. C. C. Adams (of the North Borneo Constabulary), who had been assistant camp master, then served in the role until liberation.Ooi 1998, 554 Accounts mention a British civilian internee named Don Tuxford whose eight-year-old son was in the compound with him, while Tuxford's wife and daughter Julia were in the women's compound;Ooi 1998, 354 In this account the author L. E. Morris mistakenly states that Tuxford's wife was in the camp. She was a native woman and so was not interned. Julie was interned with Tuxford's mother and his sister (ie with her grandmother and aunt). other sources state that Dutch boys over the age of ten were sent to the men's compound rather than being placed with the women, as the Japanese considered them men at that age. The total number of male children held in the men's camp is uncertain. ;Female civilian internees (including nuns) and children: This compound was located at the western part of the camp, slightly removed from the other compounds. The internees were mostly Dutch and British, with a few Eurasian and Chinese women, and four American women, including Agnes Newton Keith. Their quarters were described by an internee as \\"new and fair\\" and \\"they had a reason[able] area for cultivation.\\" The camp mistress was initially Mother Bernardine, an English Roman Catholic nun, but when she became ill Mrs. Dorie Adams, wife of the master of the men’s camp, took over the role.Keith 79–80 The women were housed in five very small barracks and each person was allotted a space of 6 feet by 4 feet (1.8m by 1.2m) in which to live and store their possessions.Ooi 1998, 321 A chapel was constructed at one end of one of the huts.Ooi 1998, 327 :In March 1944, the women’s compound comprised 280 people: 160 nuns, 85 secular women and 34 children.Keith 76, 146 By September 1944 the population had declined to 271;Ooi 1998, 327, 331 at liberation there were 237 women and children in the compound.Long 563 Of the nuns, the large majority were Dutch Roman Catholic sisters, with a few English sisters. Initially there were 29 children in the compound, but by April 1943 there were 34. The oldest of these was seven when she entered the camp.Keith 131 None of the children died in the camp; the women often went without provisions to ensure the children's survival.Keith 76, 96, 130 A Roman Catholic priest from the nearby priests' compound came to the women's compound daily at 7am to say mass, and the children were taught by the nuns.Keith 78-9 Daily life in the camp Life in the camp is summed up by Keat Gin Ooi: \\"The trying conditions of life under internment at Batu Lintang camp tested to the limits of the human struggle for survival. Food shortages, diseases and sickness, death, forced labor, harsh treatment, and deplorable living quarters were daily occurrences in camp.\\"Ooi 1998, 287 The civilian internees were treated less harshly than the POWs; of those POWs, the other ranks were subjected to far worse treatment than the officers.Ooi 1998, 288 Work \\"Banana money\\", the currency introduced by the Japanese administration in the areas of Borneo that had previously been under British control. Denominations shown: 5 cents, 10 cents, 50 cents, 1 dollar, 10 dollars The male civilian internees' regulations (prepared by the internees themselves) stated that \\"Any persons who are not performing some useful work in war-time are failing in their moral obligation. Internees should therefore do their best to do such work as ... agriculture, farming, and stock-breeding, in order to increase the supply of foodstuffs to the camp.\\"Ooi 1998, 309 Some male civilian internees chose to cultivate land around their compound in order to become self-supporting; however, the other work imposed on them meant that they never cultivated the land to its full effect. Some refused to carry out this work, even though it was for the common good.Ooi 1998, 313 Work included wood-gathering parties, latrine duties, working as cookhouse staff and medical orderlies.Ooi 1998, 349, 386 Sundays were a rest day, but these were later cut to one in every three weeks.Ooi 1998, 373 POWs and male civilian internees were forced to work as stevedores and in timber yards at Kuching harbour on the Sarawak River and from October 1942, on the extension of the two runways at the Batu Tujoh landing ground to the south of Kuching, where a small sub-camp was constructed.Ooi 1998, 363, 403–5 Another sub-camp was made at Dahan, where the Japanese re-opened an old mercury mine, and used POWs to construct access roads. Such work was prohibited by the 1907 Hague Convention, to which Japan was a signatory. Although it was against international law to force the prisoners to work on projects with a military objective, they were informed that refusal to work on these projects would result in their execution.Ooi 1998, 288, 298, 312 Other forced labour included refuelling the Zero fighters that used the runways; however, this happened only once as the men sabotaged the operation by adding urine and water to the fuel.Ooi 1998, 412–3 The work party men were paid in what the prisoners called \\"camp dollars\\", the printed paper currency introduced by the Japanese administration. This currency was known colloquially as \\"banana money\\" because of the banana trees pictured on the 10 dollar notes.Keith 171 At one point the rate was 25 cents a day for officers and NCOs and 10 cents a day for other ranks.Ooi 1998, 365 As time went on, the working parties became smaller, as there was a lack of available men due to sickness and death. The women were at first allowed to undertake domestic tasks around their compound; later they were forced to undertake work for the Japanese such as mending uniforms, for which they were also paid in camp dollars.Ooi 1998, 324 In the later part of the war, when the food shortages had become critical, all internees, male and female, were also used as agricultural labourers on the land around the camp, to produce food for their Japanese captors.Evans 1999, 90; Ooi 1998, 288 The prisoners referred to themselves as \\"white coolies\\".Ooi 1998, 368 Only 30 men were fit enough to attend the final work parties in 1945; the rest were either too ill, or already dead. Food After liberation, ex-POWs throw away the pig trough in which the daily ration of boiled rice for 1200 men was served. The ration only half filled the trough, and was mixed with sweet potato tops. Rations were always meagre but decreased in both quantity and quality as the war progressed. The women and children drew the same rations as the men. The Japanese controlled all food supplies, releasing only what was needed for the day.Ooi 1998, 329, 359 At the beginning, the rations comprised rice and local vegetables (such as kangkung), with every 10 days or so some pork (such as offal, or a head, or some poor-meat bearing part of the animal). The daily rice ration in late 1943 was 11 ounces (312 grams) a day;Ooi 1998, 350 by the end of the war the rice ration was about 4 ounces (113 grams) per man daily.Walker 648 In September 1944, children were recorded as receiving of milk a day.Ooi 1998, 327–8 A black market emerged in which the main merchants were a Dutch-Indonesian couple, who obtained goods from a Japanese guard and sold them for a profit to those with cash or tradable goods.Firkins 118 At the times of greatest hardship the internees were so hungry that they were reduced to eating snakes, rubber nuts (which were believed to be poisonous), snails and frogs, and rats, cats and dogs if they could be caught.Ooi 1998, 352, 353, 408 On special occasions an extra ration would be introduced. In the British POW compounds 58 chickens were provided for 1,000 men for Christmas 1942;Ooi 1998, 369 the next Christmas the women received a single turkey to share between 271 women and children.Ooi 1998, 331 At Christmas 1944, their last in captivity, the internees received a single egg each.Ooi 1998, 352 Only one Red Cross supply of parcels was received by the prisoners between March 1942 and September 1945. This arrived in March 1944 and worked out at one sixth of a parcel per person: a single tin of food.Keith 146-7 Prisoners occasionally were able to buy or barter chicks which they raised on worms and beetles and rice sweepings from the quartermaster's store floor (other edible food scraps being too precious to use).Ooi 1998, 388 Those which were female provided much-needed eggs. Health A camp hospital was set up and run by a Japanese medical officer, Dr. Yamamoto. The prisoners believed that his policy was \\"live and let die\\",Ooi 1998, 366 and the hospital became \\"a filthy germ- ridden death hole\\". Lionel E. Morris, a sapper with the British Army Royal Engineers, wrote that Yamamoto \\"never attended to ... sick or diseased men\\".Ooi 1998, 380 Yamamoto issued an order that no rations were to be issued to men in the hospital. The prisoners pooled their food and the sick were provided for even though it meant all others went short.Ooi 1998, 441 Care of all prisoners was left to the camp doctors, such as Colonel King and Captain Bailey in the POWs' compounds and Dr. Gibson in the women’s compound. The camp hospital and mortuary. In the right foreground is a stack of coffins. These had hinged bottoms for re-use. The hospital comprised three huts in January 1943 and housed both POWs and civilians. The standard of accommodation was very low and crowded, and facilities were virtually non-existent. A hut was later built for tuberculosis patients.Walker 646-7 In early September 1945 the camp hospital comprised about 30 beds under the care of Lt.-Col. E. M. Sheppard. Little medicine was available to the internees from the Japanese: they provided small amounts of quinine and aspirins. Morris recounts how Yamamoto would quite often beat sick men until they fell down, especially if they approached him for drugs. Few Red Cross supplies were available and most medication was bought or bartered from the outside world or from the guards themselves. No anaesthesia was available for operations.Ooi 1998, 390 The main source of medical supplies in early 1943 was a pro-Allied ethnic Chinese family who lived nearby and were assisting in the provision of materials for the construction of a radio.Ooi 1998, 462–465 =Disease= The mortality rate amongst the British soldiers was extremely high: ⅔ of the population of POWs died in the camp. It was suggested that this high rate was partly because most had come direct from Europe and were not acclimatised and had no idea about the importance of tropical hygiene. Tropical ulcers—which are often diphtheria appearing as a secondary infection of a skin disease—were a common medical complaint, along with dysentery, malaria, beri-beri, dengue, scabies, and septic bites and sores. 600 men out of 1000 were unfit for work in January 1943 owing to beri beri and skin conditions.Walker 646 Deaths from dysentery increased towards the end of the period of captivity. A British NCO, E. R. Pepler, commented that \\"[m]en wasted away from their normal weight of over ten stone [140 lb/64 kg] to three or four stones [42–56 lb/19-25 kg] ... As the time passed on to 1945, the deaths in our camp [from dysentery] were taking place at two or three every day\\".Ooi 1998, 389 =Malnutrition= Captain Anderson, a severely emaciated British officer, in Kuching Civil Hospital five days after his liberation from Batu Lintang camp. With him is Major A. M. Hutson, an Australian medical officer. Malnutrition caused most of the invalidity and was a major factor in the high mortality rate in the camp, ascribed as the chief cause of death in 600 deaths in the camp. It was considered by the relieving forces that the Japanese were pursuing a policy of deliberate starvation.In a letter dated 14 September 1945, an Australian officer with the liberating force described the conditions in the camp, and stated that \\"Judging by the quantity of food available in Kuching when the Relief Force arrived and by the adequate supplies which were then in stock in the Japanese storehouses, it is considered that the PW food ration could easily have been maintained at a level which would have kept the PW alive and reasonably healthy. However, a policy of slow starvation was carried out instead.\\" National Archives WO 325/52 The basic diet only contained 1.5 ounces (44 grams) of protein and had a calorific value of 1600.Walker 646, 648 J. L. Noakes, a male civilian internee wrote: > \\"In common with many others I experienced the pain of food deficiency > disease and by May 1944 it was difficult to work and nights were a torture. > My eyes failed rapidly and it became impossible to read or to distinguish > objects clearly. The death rate for the whole camp jumped at an alarming > rate and we began to realise that we must now begin a real fight for > existence.\\"Ooi 1998, 318 By November 1944 the suffering caused by malnutrition was profound, as recorded by Hilda E. Bates, a female civilian internee who was a nurse based in Jesselton prior to the war: > \\"We are having a particularly hungry period and [I] can quite truthfully say > that our mouths water, and that we 'slaver' as dogs do before meals. Some of > us find it advisable to rise slowly after lying down, as due to > malnutrition, any rapid movement is apt to cause dizziness or even a black- > out ... one morning recently I awoke and discovered to my horror that my > sight had become very dim. Later I realised this was due to vitamin > deficiency in our poor diet.\\"Ooi 1998, 332 By the end of their third year of internment, most women suffered from amenorrhoea due to malnutrition. In May 1945 Hilda Bates met some of the male civilian internees at the funeral of a friend: > \\"I was horrified to see their condition. Some had formerly been strong men > of twelve to fourteen stone [168–196 lb/76-89 kg] in weight, but were now > reduced to mere shadows of themselves, and weighed less than eight stone > [112 lb/51 kg]. ..

Morris, who was one of the \\"healthy\\" prisoners, weighed five stone, three pounds (). =Brutality= Brutality by the guards was another factor that damaged the health of many of the prisoners. Hilda Bates described the guards' treatment of the male prisoners: \\"Their favourite methods of punishment are either kicking below the waist with their heavy army boots, face slapping or striking the head with a rifle butt\\". Failure to bow properly to a guard was a common cause of a beating. Hilda Bates wrote of \\"One male internee [who] was paralysed for a week following Japanese brutality, simply because he had not made his bow in what the Japs considered a proper manner\\".Ooi 1998, 338 E. R. Pepler recorded that \\"a favourite punishment was to make the offender stand in the blazing sun with his arms above his head holding a log of wood. If the prisoner or his arms sagged, he was punched or kicked. This treatment usually lasted until the prisoner completely collapsed\\".Ooi 1998, 391 Prisoners suspected of more serious misdemeanours were taken by the Japanese military police, the Kempeitai, for interrogation at the former Sarawak Police headquarters in Kuching. Torture was a common method of extracting information.Ooi 1998, 422–437, 452 After the Japanese defeat, an Australian war crimes investigation team worked in Kuching from the liberation until January 1946. Of around 120 guards, more than 70 had a crime or crimes ascribed to them.Ooi 1998, 667 Clothing Private J. M. Curry, who was cook at the Australian Officers' camp, wearing the loincloth issued to him by the Japanese, his sole clothing issue in two years. Clothing wore out quickly: the tropical climate meant that clothes had to be washed every day, and the rigours of labouring in them meant that they soon became torn, worn and threadbare. An enterprising male internee, J. R. Baxter, entered the camp with two pairs of shorts; as they wore out he constructed a new pair from them by glueing together the constituent parts with latex from the rubber trees growing in the camp.Evans 1999, 90 The Japanese did not provide replacement clothing for the prisoners when their clothes wore out.Ooi 1998, 393–4 After a period male internees and POWs were issued with a loincloth and perishable rubber shoes, which soon degraded and meant in effect that most prisoners went barefoot.Ooi 1998, 376 The women fared a little better, often bartering possessions for material: clothes were fashioned out of whatever material was to hand, such as sheets and breakfast cloths.Ooi 1998, 328 Many of the women kept their best clothes unworn in readiness for their expected eventual liberation, while their other clothes became more and more shabby. Prior to their liberation, supplies were dropped by the Australians. Hilda Bates recorded: \\"The soldiers received shorts, shoes, and blankets with instructions not to appear naked in future!\\".Ooi 1998, 624 Purchasing, bartering and smuggling Prisoners were able to buy a small range of provisions from their captors at Japanese prices, which escalated as the war went on.Ooi 1998, 315 Black marketeering was sometimes tolerated by the guards, as they themselves were involved in the buying or exchanging of goods, and at other times punished severely. Although contact with the outside world was forbidden, there were plenty of opportunities to communicate with the locals. Firewood- gathering gangs in the jungle were able to make contact and arrange purchases when the guards were not paying attention;Ooi 1998, 314 at other times these transactions were permitted with the permission of and in the presence of a lenient Japanese guard.Ooi 1998, 360, 392 Gold, in the form of rings and jewellery, and British pounds were in demand by the Japanese guards. Such was the desperation of the prisoners towards the end of their internment that two soldiers disinterred a recently buried body in order to retrieve the dead man's wedding ring.Ooi 1998, 522–524 Smuggling became an integral part of camp life, and despite frequent searches, foodstuffs in particular were smuggled into the camp (for example, dried fish was nailed to the underside of wooden bins, and the inside of a hat was a favourite hiding place).Ooi 1998, 395 Occasional dangerous night-time forays to outside the camp netted foodstuffs such as a chicken or eggs or fruit.Ooi 1998, 357 The Japanese currency (the \\"camp dollars\\") was used by the prisoners illicitly to purchase supplies from the locals.Ooi 1998, 392 Social life Postcards sent home to England by a civilian internee couple, 5 May 1943 Le Gros Clark, as men's camp master, issued regular official bulletins to his compound regarding meetings with Suga and other Japanese officers.Firkins 119 Communication between the various compounds and with the outside world was forbidden. Married male internees were refused permission to see their wives and children on Christmas Day, 1943. Occasional, irregular meetings were allowed between married couples. Pre-printed postcards to be sent home with stock phrases such as \\"I am well\\" and \\"We have plenty of food\\" were issued occasionally;Ooi 1998, 418 Agnes Keith records that these were issued three times a year but in May 1945 it was decided that a certain percentage of the camp had to include a propaganda sentence in addition to the 25 permitted words of free text. She wrote: > \\"I decided that [the sentences] were all so obvious that my people would > know they were propaganda. I sent the following card: > \\"Seven communications sent. Seven received. Health moderate. George [Keith's > son] well, energetic, roughneck, reminds me my brother. Fed-up with war. > Hopes deferred. Borneo is a beautiful place for living, a dreamland where > the scenery is beautiful, little birds sing, very delicious fruits grow, we > are very happy here. Agnes, Harry, [Keith's husband] George\\" > \\"My aunt told me later that she had never felt as downhearted about my fate > as when she received that card. She said that obviously I had lost my mind.\\" Sacks of undelivered mail both to and from the prisoners were discovered in the camp on liberation.Keith 175-6 Working bees were held at Christmas time to make gifts for the children: worn-out clothing was cut up and sleeves, collars, and hems were cut from clothing still in use to provide materials for soft toys.Firkins 118–119 More robust toys, such as scooters, carts, swords, and guns were made from materials such as barbed wire and the wood of rubber trees in and around the compounds. The nuns provided food and gifts for each child. The Japanese officers also gave sweets and biscuits to the children at Christmas. A concert was organised for Christmas 1942, as well as inter- compound games; another less lavish Christmas concert took place in 1943, and a concert party was briefly established before disbanding due to the illness and death of its members.Ooi 1998, 373, 393 Lt. Frank \\"Tinker\\" Bell was largely responsible for conceiving and organising what became known by the prisoners as the \\"Kuching University\\". This operated in the British officers' compound. Under Japanese regulations prisoners were forbidden to teach, to learn, to compile or possess notes on any subject whatever, or to meet in groups for discussion. The penalty for disobedience was imprisonment or death. Despite this the university, led by Bell, established classes in seven modern languages, as well as subjects as diverse as history, public speaking, navigation, pig-farming, civics and poultry keeping. Bell and his fellow educators organised courses, compiled text books, led classes, and awarded diplomas.Bell 1991; Ooi 1998, 349, 369 Classes were often held in the evenings when dusk or darkness gave some protection against surprise by their captors. Paper for writing exercises and for compiling textbooks was always at a premium: books were fashioned out of paper from soap wrappers, newspaper, the backs of letters and envelopes, and cigarette paper. These were bound into books and often covered with sarong material. Other informal clubs, mainly comprising discussion groups, were established in the other compounds. They covered topics such as chess and draughts (checkers), book-keeping, sailing, and French conversation lessons. A central library for all the camp was run from the British Officers' compound, with books donated by the internees and some from the civilian library in Kuching town.Bell, 62;Ooi 1998, 349 Cemetery A section of the cemetery at Batu Lintang camp. Initially the dead were buried in the cemetery at Kuching. The high death rate meant that this was soon filled, however, and in November 1942 a new cemetery area was created next to the camp at an area to the south-east known as \\"Boot Hill\\". The cemetery was within sight of the camp. At first the dead were buried in coffins, but soon the number of fatalities and the shortage of timber meant that shrouds made from rice sacks or blankets were used instead. The bodies were carried to the grave in a wooden coffin with a hinged bottom, which allowed re-use.Ooi 1998, 335, 367, 389, AWM photographs 118566 and 118567 Hilda Bates wrote in June 1945: \\"I am horrified at the increased number of graves in the burial ground. Deaths are now so frequent, that a party of grave diggers is now permanently employed, and given extra rations in order that they will have the strength to dig\\".Ooi 1998, 339 After liberation the bodies were exhumed from the cemetery and sent to Labuan for reburial in a central military cemetery there. A large number of the graves of prisoners from Batu Lintang now at Labuan are unidentified: after the Japanese surrender Suga destroyed many camp records. The cemetery in Labuan is cared for by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The radio (the \\"Old Lady\\") and generator (\\"Ginnie\\") Information on the outside world was gathered from a variety of sources, such as from co-workers of the Batu Lintang work parties at Kuching docks.Ooi 1998, 363 An invaluable boost to the prisoners' morale was provided by a secret radio receiver, from which they were able to learn about the progress of the war. This had been constructed from scavenged and bartered parts. A generator was later constructed to power the radio. The construction of the radio was ordered by Russell. He and some 1150 other POWs had arrived at Batu Lintang on 13 October 1942 from Tanjung Priok camp in Java, where a small group of men had worked on constructing a radio.Ooi 1998, 314, 439 His proposal was initially met with a distinct lack of enthusiasm, as discovery would result in certain death. One of these men was G. W. Pringle, a member of the British military police. He wrote \\"Do these madmen ever seriously consider these idiotic plans before putting men's lives in danger?\\"Ooi 1998, 439–440 Leonard Beckett with the radio (the \\"Old Lady\\") and the generator (\\"Ginnie\\") It was known that ethnic Chinese people in Sarawak were pro-Allied, and so contact was made with the Ongs, the leading Chinese family in Kuching, who lived about a mile from the camp, to see if they could assist in providing parts.Ooi 1998, 440; The first night-time attempt, by G. W. Pringle, was a failure as he could not find his way through the dense jungle to the house. A reconnoitre mission was required. To achieve this, Russell suggested to Dr Yamamoto that as the area was a breeding ground for mosquitoes (with the resultant risk of malaria, which would affect Japanese and prisoner alike), the jungle should be cleared and sprayed. Pringle took part on this working party and was able to plot his route. He subsequently made contact and Ong Tiang Swee, Kapitan China of Sarawak and the patriarch of the Ong family, agreed to help. Ong instructed his grandson, Kee Hui to help Pringle obtain the needed parts. This was at massive risk to the family's own safety as they too would have been executed if discovered. Their only condition was that they should be provided with the news gathered from the radio, in order to boost the morale of the Chinese community under occupation in Kuching. They provided some radio parts, the acquisition of which must have been a considerable task as all radio equipment had been confiscated by the Japanese.Ooi 1998, 442–454 The radio was built and operated in the British other ranks' compound. The maker of the radio was Warrant Officer Leonard A. T. Beckett, an experienced radio engineer, who was assisted in its construction, operation, and concealment by a core group of three other soldiers. Before Beckett could begin on the radio he first had to make some of the tools needed, such as a lathe and a soldering iron. In addition to the genuine radio parts provided by the Chinese family and a few parts brought along with the men from Tanjung Priok, the radio was constructed from items as diverse as a deaf aid, the steering damper of a Norton motorcycle, a bakelite shaving soap container, an army mess tin, the backing of an old map case, pieces of glass, wire, mica and barbed wire, and parts stolen from Japanese-owned motor cars and motorcycles. The receiver was completed within four weeks of starting.Ooi 1998, 358, 441, 457, 516–7 and 549 The radio was concealed during its construction in a large stewing-pot; once completed its hiding place was in a biscuit tin buried under the bakehouse fire in the British other ranks' compound.Ooi 1998, 395, 457, 517, 522 It was operated in the stores where it had a temporary hiding place in a false-bottomed table.Ooi 1998, 396 Elaborate security proceedings to protect the radio were put in place, including a network of look-outs.Ooi 1998, 397, 457 The radio at first ran off torch batteries: these soon ran out and so Beckett constructed a power unit to run off the camp electricity supply.Ooi 1998, 517, 549 Access to the camp powerhouse was gained by one of the POWs who had been a professional cat burglar before the war. The radio was first used on the night of 24 February 1943, as radio reception was better in the evening. Some of the news was bewildering to the prisoners: \\"Who is this General Montgomery? He seems to be the man we ought to have had in charge from the very beginning. A real live wire\\", wrote Pringle.Ooi 1998, 460–1, 517 The existence of the radio, referred to by many code-names but chiefly as the \\"Old Lady\\" and \\"Mrs Harris\\",Ooi 1998, 627; Keith 182 was to be a closely guarded secret, for fear of alerting the Japanese to its existence through loose talk. The commanding officers of the camp and those who had constructed and operated it were known as the \\"Board of Directors\\", and were the only ones who knew the precise contents of the radio news received.Ooi 1998, 570 A way of disseminating information was organised: it was arranged for rumours to be spread which contained a considerable amount of truth.Ooi 1998, 458 Le Gros Clark, the head of the male internees, directed the dissemination of news amongst the male internees;Ooi 1998, 549 it was decided not to provide information to the women's compound. News was also passed to the Chinese once a week, carried through the jungle by Pringle. On the first exchange, without being asked, the Chinese thoughtfully provided medical supplies; thereafter they regularly provided much-needed medicines, money, and vegetable seeds.Ooi 1998, 461–464 The leaked news rumours had the desired effect and a more cheerful atmosphere was noted in the camp.Ooi 1998, 463 The women's compound somehow learned of the existence of the radio and the camp mistress, Dorie Adams, asked that they should be provided with news; to counter worries about security she suggested that the Roman Catholic priest who celebrated mass with the R.C. nuns should deliver the news as part of his service, which was always given in Latin.Ooi 1998, 471–2 In early March 1943 the provision of electric power for the lighting in the internees' compounds was halted. This was a serious blow as the radio was run off the power supply. Batteries were unavailable and so the only solution, again the idea of Russell, was to construct a generator. His idea again met with some initial scepticism: \\"Now I know he has gone mad\\", wrote Pringle.Ooi 1998, 494 Pringle’s colleagues were more enthusiastic. Beckett was sure he could build the generator and British RAOC personnel were certain they could supply the necessary components, though they thought it would take three months to make the tools needed.Ooi 1998, 1998, 495 To disguise the noise of the work the enterprise was described as a \\"watch repairing factory\\" to the Japanese, who offered the use of various tools and other equipment.Ooi 1998, 498 In March 1943, after the execution of some prisoners at the Sandakan POW camp for operating a radio, the Japanese stepped up their searches at Batu Lintang.Ooi 1998, 398 Many items essential for the construction of the generator such as magnets, wire, and scrap iron were not easily available, but the involvement of \\"Freddie\\", one of the prisoners who was a self-confessed thief (and most likely the same man who had previously obtained a power supply: records are unclear) meant that material and equipment was soon obtained. Leonard Beckett showing the radio to Brigadier T. C. Eastick and A. W. Walsh on 11 September 1945 The generator needed to turn at 3,000 revolutions a minute, and so the fittest of the men involved in its construction was chosen to turn the wheel. He was given extra food rations to prepare him for the task.Ooi 1998, 504 The first trial of the generator was a success, and again, Pringle recorded how news reports told of unknown figures: \\"Events appeared to have been moving with unseemly haste during our enforced breaks from the news broadcasts. [We] listened to names we had never heard of. General Eisenhower? General Stilwell?\\" The assembling and disassembling drill took less than thirty seconds, with both the \\"Old Lady\\" and \\"Ginnie\\" stowed in their hiding places in the hut which was occupied by cookhouse staff during the day. In June 1944, Le Gros Clark was taken from the camp by the kempeitai for questioning. On his return the same day, he was considerably shaken and recommended that the radio should be destroyed. This message was relayed to the camp master of the British other ranks' compound by Whimster, who was the senior British officer. Beckett and his colleagues were informed of this order, but were left to decide themselves what course of action to take. Realising its importance in keeping up camp morale, they decided to keep the radio, saying that \\"we might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb\\", according to Pepler.Ooi 1998, 398, 549, 553 Steps to safeguard the civilian internees were undertaken by cutting off news to their compounds.As a result some of the male internees instigated the smuggling-in of a newspaper, previously available in the camp but banned since August 1943. They were caught, and although opposed to the activity, Le Gros Clark was implicated. Nine men were tried and sentenced to between six months' and six years' imprisonment. Le Gros Clark was amongst the five men of the nine at the trial who were murdered by the Japanese at Keningau aerodrome some time in June or July 1945 (Ooi 1998, 549–560) That same month the prisoners received news of the invasion of Normandy. Pringle recorded how, once again, the news brought unfamiliar names to the prisoners' attention: \\"'Blood and Guts Patton'. Now there is a name for a General! ... Somehow though, we feel that with a General bearing the name of 'Blood and Guts' there is little danger of the Germans dislodging his army\\".Ooi 1998, 507–8 It was clear that such important news would have a great effect in the camp; at the same time, the rejoicing it would bring would undoubtedly alert the Japanese. It was therefore decided to provide a hint to the other prisoners, rather than the full information. This was again delivered by a priest, this time by the padre officiating at one of the numerous funeral services. He quoted Exodus chapter 15, verses 9 and 10, which refer to pursuing, overtaking and destroying the enemy, and the sea. News of the bombing of London by V-2 rockets was withheld.Ooi 1998, 509–512 The news of the German capitulation on 7 May 1945 was similarly cryptically relayed at a funeral by the padre. This time the verse was Exodus chapter 3, verse 8, concerning the deliverance of the Israelites from the Egyptians to the land of milk and honey; extra piquancy was added by the fact that Suga was present at this service.Ooi 1998, 513–4 End of the war for Batu Lintang In the Allied plans for the South West Pacific theatre, the responsibility for re-taking the island of Borneo was entrusted to Australian forces. Prior to the Australian landings, strategic bombing and reconnaissance missions were undertaken by the RAAF and USAAF. The first Allied planes, 15 USAAF Lockheed Lightnings were seen over the camp on the morning of 25 March 1945, as they flew on a mission to bomb the Batu Tujoh landing ground.Ooi 1998, 335, 353, 604; Keith 170 Raids continued sporadically over the next few weeks. A lone Flying Fortress regularly attacked targets in Kuching.Ooi 1998, 604 The Borneo campaign was launched on 1 May 1945, with a brigade of the Australian 9th Division landing at Tarakan, on the eastern coast of Dutch Borneo. The American armed forces provided naval and air support to assist the landings, and in some cases the Australians were assisted by the advance landings of the Services Reconnaissance Department (SRD) and their local allies.Ooi 1998, 9, 569–570 This was followed by landings in Brunei and Labuan on 10 June.Long 459 In early July, a raid was made by Mosquito aircraft on oil and petrol dumps near to the camp.Ooi 1998, 606 Liberation still seemed a remote prospect, however: \\"As the weeks dragged by, the lone planes of the Allies were a daily occurrence and as we had realised very early that they could do nothing to help us, we hardly took any notice of them\\". The atomic bombings in Japan at Hiroshima on 6 August 1945 followed by that of Nagasaki on 9 August precipitated the abrupt end of the war. On 15 August 1945, Japan announced its official unconditional surrender to the Allied Powers. The POWs learned of the surrender early in the morning of 15 August, in a broadcast by Radio Chungking received by the secret radio.Ooi 1998, 607–8, 614–6. The official surrender broadcast, a pre-recorded speech by Emperor Hirohito, the Imperial Rescript on Surrender, was made at noon on 15 August. However, the Japanese Suzuki government had indicated the surrender on August 14, by notifying the Allied forces that it accepted the Potsdam Agreement. Chungking in China was Chiang Kai-shek's provisional capital during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945) and so broadcast pro-Allied news and propaganda Pringle made one last journey through the jungle to inform his Chinese friends.Ooi 1998, 616 The news was immediately broken to the British other ranks' compound, and quickly spread to the other compounds. Celebratory meals were prepared, with precious supplies and livestock used up. The Japanese guards were unaware of their country's surrender, and as the day coincided with an official camp holiday, marking the opening of the camp on 15 August three years previously, they were satisfied that the celebrations were related to the break from the working parties.Ooi 1998, 607 The women learned shortly afterwards, when the married women had their scheduled meeting with their husbands.Ooi 1998, 622 Prisoners waving to the RAAF Beaufighter aircraft which flew over to drop leaflets announcing Japan’s surrender Under General Order No. 1, issued on 16 August by General Douglas MacArthur, as Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, the Japanese were required to provide information on the location of all camps and were responsible for the safety of prisoners and internees, for providing them with adequate food, shelter, clothes and medical care until their care could pass to the Allied powers, and for handing over each store together with its equipment, stores, arms and ammunition and records to the senior Allied officer in each camp. Since it was known that in many areas prisoners and internees were suffering from starvation and neglect, it was of the first importance that they were contacted and recovered as soon as possible.Kirby 1969, 246 Despite the surrender, the Japanese would remain in control of the camp until 11 September. During this period, there were no work parties and the prisoners did not suffer any beatings.Ooi 1998, 610, 616 \\"It became apparent during the next few days that the Japanese soldiers knew something had happened but were not sure what it was\\", wrote Pepler.Ooi 1998, 608. A second rescript was issued to Japan's armed forces on 17 August; it is unclear at what stage this would have been received and disseminated at Batu Lintang camp Extra food was provided by the Japanese shortly afterwards; the camp hospital was furnished with bed chairs and mosquito nets for the first time, and substantial amounts of medicine were issued.Ooi 1998, 622–3 A pamphlet in English titled JAPAN HAS SURRENDERED was dropped over the camp by three Beaufighters on 16 August.Bell 111 From 19–23 August, leaflets were dropped by aircraft all over known areas in which the Japanese were concentrated, giving general war news and news of the progress of the surrender.Long 562 On August 19 or 20,Bell 112; Ooi 1998, 623; Keith 182 more leaflets were dropped on the camp. Signed by Major-General George Wootten, General Officer Commanding, 9th Division, they informed the prisoners of the surrender of Japan, and stated \\"I know that you will realise that on account of your location, it will be difficult to get aid to you immediately, but you can rest assured that we will do everything within our power to release and care for you as soon as possible\\".Keith 182 On 24 August, Suga officially announced to the camp that Japan had surrendered.Bell 113; Ooi 1998, 618; Keith 182. Although sources vary, the most likely date appears to be 24 August On 29 August letters were dropped on the camp, instructing the Japanese commander to make contact with the Australian commanders. The letter contained a code of panel signals which enabled Suga to indicate that he agreed to the dropping of supplies for the prisoners and that he would meet Australian representatives later.Bell 115-6; pace Long 562 These panels were placed on the roof of one of the buildings and can be seen in the photograph at the start of the article (above). Preparing to drop a storpedo into the camp, 30 August 1945. \\"On the six foot torpedo was printed the word BREAD ... [it] spelled BREAD, but it meant, YOU ARE NOT FORGOTTEN\\" Agnes Newton Keith, Three Came Home. Stores in long canisters (known by the aircraftmen as \\"storpedos\\") were first parachuted into the camp from a RAAF Douglas Dakota on 30 August. A female internee, Hilda Bates, wrote: \\"At 11.30 a.m. today a sea-plane dropped twenty parachutes with packages attached. One fell outside our hut and was labelled 'bread'. Others contained flour, tinned rabbit, and other meat. The goods were collected by the Japs under the supervision of Australian Officers who distributed them to the groups of internees. All sorts of what we had thought of as luxuries arrived; such as sugar, sweets, milk, bundles of clothing, and even fashion books!\\". Further supplies were dropped daily;Ooi 1998, 609 tragedy struck on 7 September when a male civilian internee was hit and killed by a storpedo that had broken free from its parachute.Ooi 1998, 609, 625, 633 The official Instrument of Surrender was signed on 2 September ending World War II. After communicating with the Japanese staff at Kuching, Colonel A. G. Wilson landed on the Sarawak River on 5 September and conferred with the commander of the Japanese forces there, who confirmed there were 2,024 Allied prisoners and internees in the area. The next day, Brigadier Thomas Eastick, commander of Kuching Force—a detachment from the 9th Division—flew to the mouth of the Sarawak River in a Catalina where three Japanese officers, including Suga, came aboard for talks. The task of Kuching Force was to accept the surrender of and impound the Japanese forces in the Kuching area, release and evacuate Allied prisoners and internees, and establish military control.Long 562-3; AWM photographs OG3454 and OG3455 At the meeting, Suga presented Eastick with complete nominal rolls of all compounds in the camp.Firkins 133 On 7 September, Walsh was permitted by the Japanese to fly to the headquarters of the 9th Division on Labuan island, to collect surgical and medical supplies for the camp. He returned with two Australian medical officers, Major A. W. M. Hutson and Lt.-Col. N. H. Morgan.Long 563; AWM photograph 115799 Pepler recorded how \\"Dr Yamamoto came in for one hell of a time from these two Medical Officers when they saw the state of the majority of our camp. Up-to- date medical care and drugs soon began to show effect upon our sick and many lives were saved by these two officers. Out of the two thousand of us who entered that camp, only seven hundred and fifty survived and of these well over six hundred were chronic sick\\".Ooi 1998, 609–610 Death orders Immediately prior to the surrender of Japan, rumours abounded in the camp that the Japanese intended to execute all the prisoners rather than allow them to be freed by the approaching Allied forces;Ooi 1998, 611–614 when Dr Yamamoto informed some prisoners that they were to be moved to a new camp they naturally feared the worst, especially when he promised the unlikely idyll of a camp \\"equipped with the best medical equipment obtainable ... there would be no working parties and food would be plentiful ... the sick men would be especially well cared for\\".Ooi 1998, 612–614. Quotation from the papers of G. W. Pringle Official orders to execute all the prisoners, both POWs and civilian, on 17 or 18 August 1945Ooi 1998, 610, 628 were found in Suga's quarters after the liberation of the camp. The orders were not carried out, presumably as a result of the unconditional surrender of Japan on 15 August. A \\"death march\\", similar to those at Sandakan and elsewhere, was to have been undertaken by those male prisoners physically able to undertake it; other prisoners were to be executed by various methods in the camp: *1 All POWs and male internees to be marched to a camp at milestone 21 and bayoneted there *2 All sick unable to walk to be treated similarly in the Square at Kuching [in the square at the camp rather than in Kuching town] *3 All women and children to be burnt in their barracksOoi 1998, 628 Revised orders for the execution on 15 September 1945 of all the internees were also found, this time in the Administration Office at Batu Lintang: *Group 1 Women internees, children and nuns – to be given poisoned rice *Group 2 Internee men and Catholic Fathers to be shot and burnt *Group 3 POWs to be marched into the jungle, shot and burnt *Group 4 Sick and weak left at Batu Lintang main camp to be bayoneted and the entire camp to be destroyed by fireOoi 1998, 648; Keith 183, 206 The camp was liberated on 11 September 1945, four days before the revised proposed execution date of over 2,000 men, women and children. Liberation of the camp Eastick addressing part of the parade at the surrender ceremony at the camp, 11 September 1945 On 8–9 September, the Royal Australian Navy corvette , with Eastick and staff officers on board, sailed for Kuching, along with . At 14:35 on 11 September, Eastick accepted the surrender of the Japanese forces in the Kuching area from their commander, Major-General Hiyoe Yamamura, on board HMAS Kapunda.Long 563; AWM photographs 041062-041071, 116168-116175 Later that day the Australian occupying force landed. The 9th Division troops arrived at Batu Lintang camp that afternoon, accompanied by a few American naval officers.Ooi 1998, 626 There was no resistance from the Japanese troops. The prisoners and internees had been forewarned that there would be no delay in taking the surrender, and quickly gathered at 17:00 in the main square of the camp to witness Eastick accept the sword of Suga.Ooi 1998, 619, 626 The Japanese finally learned of the existence of the radio in a dramatic fashion: > \\"The Australian Commander, Major General [sic] Eastick ... mounted the > rostrum and after accepting the sword of surrender from Suga was about to > dismiss him when a shout, rising simultaneously from the throats of the > Board of Directors of the 'Old Lady' and 'Ginnie' stopped the proceedings. > 'Hold on, we have something to show you.' Carrying the radio and generator > Len [Beckett] proudly showed them to the General and turning to Suga, asked, > 'Well, what do you think about it Suga?' Now I know the full meaning of the > saying 'If looks could kill.' Len would have died a horrible death\\".Ooi > 1998, 620; quotation from the papers of G. W. Pringle The following day, Suga, together with Captain Nagata and Dr Yamamoto, were flown to the Australian base on Labuan, to await their trials as war criminals. Suga committed suicide there on 16 September. Nagata and Yamamoto were later tried, found guilty and executed. Photographers and cameramen accompanied the liberating force, and the events, and those of the following days, were well-documented.Ooi 1998, 610, 627 On liberation, the camp contained 2,024 inmates: 1,392 prisoners (including 882 British, 178 Australian and 45 Indian); and 632 internees.Long 562; Kirby 1969, Appendix 30 The most ill prisoners were taken to Kuching Civil Hospital, which had been entirely refitted by the Australians since serving as the Japanese military hospital.Ooi 1998, 620, 628 On 12 September, a thanksgiving service was held in the camp, led by two Australian chaplains from the liberating force and Bishop Francis S. Hollis of Sarawak, an ex-internee.Ooi 1998, 627; Keith 201 This was followed by a parade held in honour of Wootten, as commander of the 9th Division.AWM photographs 118591-118598 In appreciation of Beckett's work on the radio, fellow ex-prisoners in the camp subscribed over £1,000 for him, a massive sum of money for the time, which Beckett intended to use to set up a wireless business in London, his hometown.AWM photograph OG3527 Beckett was later awarded the British Empire Medal for his work on the radio.http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/37744/supplements/4903/page.pdf Ex-internee children inspecting the RAAF Douglas Dakota C-47 on which they were to be transferred to Labuan. Repatriation commenced on 12 September, and by 14 September, 858 former prisoners had been removed, though pressure of numbers meant that some were still at Batu Lintang a week after liberation. Ex-prisoners were transported by ship (including Wanganella, an Australian hospital ship) and in eight Douglas Dakotas and two Catalinas, to the 9th Division's \\"Released Prisoners of War and Internees Reception Camp\\", and the 2/1st Australian Casualty Clearing Station (CCS) on Labuan, before continuing their journeys homeward.Long 563; Wigmore 634 The captured Japanese soldiers were then held at Batu Lintang camp. There they were visited by J. B. Archer, an ex-internee, who noted \\"There were about eight thousand of them ... it was difficult not to feel aggrieved at the good treatment they were receiving compared to what we had received at their hands. A lunch of fried rice, fish, vegetable and dried fruit was shown to me. This, I was told, was just an ordinary sample.\\"Archer 1997,56 Post-war By June–July 1946, the bodies in the cemetery at Batu Lintang had been exhumed and reburied in the military cemetery on Labuan island.Ooi 1998, 672 In 1947, a grant was approved for the establishment of a teachers' training college on the site. It exists as such to the present day, the oldest in Malaysia. Of the numerous huts that had housed the prisoners, only 21 were considered fit for use in 1947; after refurbishment the college moved in July 1948 from its temporary home in Kuching to the site at Batu Lintang.Lim 1995, 81,98 The huts have gradually been replaced over the years, although a few remnants of the site's former life remain. These include a single hut (albeit with a galvanised roof rather than the attap (palm leaf) one of the war), the old gate posts, the gate bunker and stump of the Japanese flag pole. There is also a small museum on the site. Three Came Home, an account of female internee Agnes Newton Keith's time in the camp, was published in 1947. It was later made into a feature film of the same name, with Claudette Colbert playing the part of Agnes, Patric Knowles playing her husband Harry and Sessue Hayakawa in the role of Suga. The Union Jack which had been draped over the coffins of prisoners of war at the camp, and which had been raised in the camp on the Japanese capitulation, was placed in All Saints Church, Oxford in April 1946, together with two wooden memorial plaques. After the deconsecration of the church and their temporary loss, in 1993 the flag and plaques were housed in Dorchester Abbey.Rev Brian Taylor, 2006, \\"Lintang Camp memorials\\" The Sarawak Museum Journal Vol 62, No 83, 59–62 The Australian War Memorial in Canberra, Australia holds a large archive of material related to the camp, much of which is accessible on the AWM website in the collections databases. In England, the Imperial War Museum in London also houses material about the camp, as does the Bodleian Library of Commonwealth and African Studies at Rhodes House in Oxford. Many of the personal recollections held at the latter two repositories are reproduced in the 1998 publication by Keat Gin Ooi (see below for full reference). Originally the site was commemorated by a small stone. A more formal memorial was opened at the site of the camp in April 2013.https://www.theborneopost.com/2013/04/24/batu-lintang-wartime-memorial- square-officially-unveiled/ Various memorial ceremonies have been held at the site of the camp, including one on 11 September 2020 to mark the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the camp.https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2020/09/11/memorial-held-at- former-wwii-prisoner-camp-in-batu-lintang-sarawak Batu Lintang in March 2007: gallery File:Batu_Lintang_ammunition_bunker.jpgAmmunition bunker.

Named after the schlieren method of visualization, it consists of a digital camera or video camera pointing at the flow in question, with an illuminated target pattern behind. The method was first proposed in 1999. Variations in refractive index cause the light from the target to refract as it passes through the fluid, which causes a distortion of the pattern in the image seen by the camera. Pattern matching algorithms can measure this distortion and calculate a qualitative density field of the flow. The method of synthetic schlieren can be used to observe any flow which has variations in refractive index. Commonly these are caused by variations in concentration of a solute in an aqueous solution, or variations in the density of a compressible flow, caused by temperature or pressure variations. As with the optical schlieren method, the clearest results are obtained from flows which are largely two-dimensional.

He changed his name to Shawn Russ after the juvenile court judge Thomas S. Kirk \\"ended the parental rights of his natural mother and allowed [his] foster parents to adopt him\\". Family life and foster care The eldest of three children, Kingsley was born in Denver, Colorado, to Rachel Kingsley and Ralph Kingsley, Sr., who became estranged from his family, giving Rachel Kingsley custodial rights. Gregory's two younger brothers, Jeremiah and Zachary, remained with their mother, but Gregory went to live with his alcoholic father, who forbade him from having any contact with them. Eventually, Gregory was reunited with his mother and two siblings; however, his mother's drug use prevented her from parenting, and so she voluntarily put her two oldest sons into foster care in 1990. Gregory was placed in a boys shelter, where he met and befriended George H. Russ, who had first come to the shelter as a member of a government commission exploring the \\"needs of children\\". He was a father and an attorney, and he empathized with Gregory, having had an unhappy childhood himself. In October 1991, he and his wife Lizabeth agreed to adopt Gregory, bringing him to live with their eight biological children. Legal action On June 25, 1992, 11-year-old Kingsley filed a petition for termination of the parental rights of his natural parents, as well as a complaint for declaration of rights and adoption by his foster parents. On July 21, 1992, the trial court determined Kingsley had legal standing to initiate the action for termination of parental rights. Between August 11, 1992, and September 11, 1992, four additional petitions for termination of parental rights were filed on behalf of Kingsley: one from his foster father, George Russ; one from his guardian ad litem, Catherine A. Tucker; one from the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services (HRS); and the last from Kingsley's foster mother, Elizabeth Russ. The lawsuit became widely publicized, and the media referred to him as \\"Gregory K\\". George Russ said that he had convinced Gregory to take the \\"unusual step of seeking the right to sue because he feared that the state might take Gregory out of the Russ home\\" if he himself had sued. Initial Trial The matter proceeded to trial on September 24, 1992. Rachel Kingsley, his mother, a \\"30-year-old unemployed waitress\\", was characterized by a neighbor as someone who \\"liked to go out partying\\", and often had different men spend the night with her. When she took the witness stand, she \\"denied accusations of drug abuse, homosexuality, promiscuity, and child abuse\\" made by Gregory Kingsley's lawyers, which included foster parent George H. Russ. At the time of the trial, Gregory Kingsley had lived with his biological mother only seven months out of the past eight years. Gregory's biological father did not contest the adoption. On September 25, 1992, after a televised two‑day trial, Judge Kirk ruled that \\"by clear and convincing evidence, almost beyond a reasonable doubt, the child has been abandoned and neglected by his mother and that it [would be] in his manifest best interest\\" to terminate the mother's parental rights. Full custody was awarded to the Russes. After winning the case, he was presented with a t‑shirt that had the name \\"Shawn Russ\\" printed on it as well as the number 9 to show he was the Russes' ninth child. Appeal The lawyers of Rachel Kingsley, however, appealed to the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeal in Daytona Beach, Florida. It ruled that the trial court erred in granting standing to a child to divorce his parents. They held that: # Although the child lacked legal capacity to institute a proceeding to terminate his parental rights to free himself for adoption by his foster parents, the lower court ruled it was a harmless error, because his foster parents, his guardian ad litem and the State had also filed termination petitions on his behalf; # The trial court erred in trying the termination and adoption proceedings simultaneously but that such error was harmless error; and # The mother's immediate appeal of the order terminating her parental rights deprived the lower court of the authority to enter an order granting the adoption and, thus, remanded the lower court's adoption order. Legacy After the trial, Gregory Kingsley himself said that he \\"hoped his case would encourage other young people to take action to gain their happiness\\". Indeed, the case inspired Kimberly Mays, a 14-year-old girl who was switched at birth in 1978 in the hospital she was born in. She decided to take similar legal measures to divorce herself from her biological parents, Ernest and Regina Twigg, who were trying to sue for full custody of her when she wanted to remain with Robert Mays, the man who raised her as his daughter. In popular culture The Gregory K case has been portrayed in two made- for-television films: Switching Parents (1993) with Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Gregory and A Place to Be Loved (1993) with Tom Guiry as Gregory.

Edu, was a prominent Nigerian businessman and conservationist from Epe, Lagos State. He was the founder of the Nigerian Conservation Fund, a Nigerian NGO involved in conservation projects and was a former member of the council of the World Wildlife Fund. Life Edu was born in Epe to the polygamous family of Lawani Edu; his mother was Raliatu who was the daughter of a Muslim cleric. His education started with attendance at Quranic schools before enrolling in the Government Muslim Primary School, Epe. He finished his education in 1927 and thereafter, taught at his alma mater. Career Edu left teaching in 1930 and started a career as a clerk with the Africa Oil and Nuts Company, a firm which had a business alliance with Holland West Africa and was involved in buying palm produce at Epe. In 1933, he was posted to Apapa as a shipping clerk with Holland West Africa. By 1945, he had risen to a managerial level. As a manager, he organized the Dutch shipping line's offices in the country and helped in expanding the business to other coastal cities. Figuring out there were affordable untapped prospects in the Nigerian shipping industry, he left Holland West Africa Lines and founded his own firm. Using his prior experience in the shipping industry, he found himself a niche in ship handling and stevedoring. He later expanded the venture into timber and other commodities. In the post war period, he was a food contractor to private, government and European agencies. He also delved into the oil haulage business working as a contractor for British Petroleum, Edu was chairman of British Petroleum, Nigeria when the firm was nationalized and had its name changed to African Petroleum by the Obasanjo regime. In partnership with T.A. Braithwaite and Munich Re-Insurance, he set up an insurance firm, African Alliance. In the 1950s, Edu was a member of the expatriate-dominated Lagos Chamber of Commerce, as a member, he became acquainted with the law firm of Irving and Borner which acted as an advisory firm to foreign businesses scouting for opportunities in the country. Through Irving and Borner, he secured board seats with Blackwood Hodge Nigeria, plumbing and electrical firm, Haden Nigeria and Glaxo Nigeria. He was also a board member of the Federal Industrial Loans Board from 1954 to 1959. In 1963, he was elected president of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce. Political career During the pre-independence period, Edu was sympathetic to the Nigerian Youth Movement as a supporter of Jubril Martin, one of the party's candidate in the 1943 election. He was elected into the Western House of Assembly in 1951 and was later nominated to represent Epe at the Federal House of Representatives. As a prominent Lagosian, he spent a few years as a commissioner for health in Lagos. After his resignation, he focused his energy on various enterprises. He founded Nigerian Conservation Foundation in 1980. One of his sons, Yomi Edu, was appointed Minister of Special Duties, by Olusegun Obasanjo. Further reading *Siyan Oyeweso. (1996).

It has been declared a historic mechanical engineering landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. The pumping station was decommissioned in the 1970s, and turned into the Metropolitan Waterworks Museum in 2011. The engine drew steam from a coal- fired boiler, and had a pump valve mechanism which allowed its high-speed operation at a hydraulic head of . The engine was designed by engineer Erasmus Darwin Leavitt, Jr., of Cambridge, Massachusetts, with a pump valve invented by Prof. Alois Riedler of the Royal Technical College of Charlottenburg (now the Technical University of Berlin) in Berlin, Germany. It was built by N. F. Palmer Jr. & Co. and the Quintard Iron Works, in New York. In 1894, it was installed as Engine No. 3 of the Chestnut Hill High Station, later named the Boston Water Works. At its normal speed of 50 revolutions per minute, it pumped 25 million gallons of water in 24 hours. According to Carol Poh Miller, when first brought into operation, the engine attracted national attention as \\"the most efficient pumping engine in the world\\". The engine was taken out of service in 1928 but remains in its original location and it is open for public viewing as an exhibit in the Metropolitan Waterworks Museum. Components and operation The engine itself is of an unusual triple-expansion, three-crank rocker design, with pistons in diameter and stroke. Each rocker is connected both to a crankshaft with a flywheel and to a double acting pump's plunger. The triple-expansion steam engine cylinders, located on the second story of the engine, are supported by six vertical and six diagonal columns, creating space for three vertical pistons to move up and down. The vertical rods with stroke from the engine drive a horizontal crankshaft which is also connected to a flywheel. Each of the vertical rods is also connected to the back end of a rocking crank, similar to a bellcrank. With the pivot point of the crank in the front side, the up and down motion of the vertical rod on the back end of the crank creates a motion that pulls and pushes the crank backward and forward. There are also three horizontal rods that connect between the horizontal shaft and the cranks. As the shaft turns, the rods move backward and forward nearly horizontally, adding force to the backward and forward motion of the cranks. On the front end of the cranks, there are 30-degree inclined rods that are connected to the inclined plungers of the pump proper. The unusual diagonal plungers were created in part by the limitation of the existing engine room. The crank configuration is set in a way that the stroke is reduced to stroke for the inclined rods. Each plunger pumps water in two pump chambers with total of six chambers for the pumping engine. With the reduction of the strokes and the relation of diameters, a higher capacity for pressure can be achieved. The efficiency of the engine also comes from the design of the pump valves by Prof. Riedler. The pump valves which are connected rings that can move up and down to open can close the valves. The pump valve mechanism is controlled by a diagonal rod, powered from a stroke horizontal rod which is connected the crank. The valve rods only close the valves on the reverse stroke and leave the valves free to open automatically to increase the speed of the operation.

Rámila was born in Vilarcayo, Burgos. He was professor of humanities at the Colegio Trilingüe (Trilingual College), and in the Greater College of San Ildefonso, in Alcalá de Henares. He was also canon of the Complutensian church of SS. Justo and Pastor. He died in Alcalá de Henares. In 1616 he submitted four poems to a contest of the chapel of the Sagrario in Toledo. The poems are lost, and are thought to have been of little literary merit. He signed them with the pseudonyms Trepus Ruitanus Lamira and Juan Pablo Ricci. He owes his fame to the diatribes from an Aristotelian perspective against, principally, Lope de Vega, but also against Luis Tribaldos de Tolello, Padre Juan Luis de la Cerda and José Antonio González de Salas. He is especially remembered for the Latin satire Spongia (Paris, 1617), written probably in collaboration with Juan Pablo Mártir Rizo. The original work has been lost, due to its destruction by the enemies of Torres, but it was reconstructed by Joaquín de Entrambasaguas in his Una guerra literaria del Siglo de Oro: Lope de Vega y los preceptistas aristotélicos, Madrid, 1932. It contained personal attacks on Lope, as well as attacks on his dramatic theory and practice as defying Aristotelian norms. Writer Francisco López de Aguilar Coutiño, a friend of Lope de Vega, wrote Expostulatio Spongiae (1618) in rebuttal. Torres Rámila served Cristóbal Suárez de Figueroa as the model of the character of the teacher in his El pasajero.

She was the mother of Queen Catherine of Sweden. She was later Abbess of Vreta Abbey. Biography Helen was born in Denmark, the daughter of King Sverker II and Queen Benecicta. Her father was an exile there at that time. In 1195 or 1196, he was crowned King of Sweden. In 1208, he was deposed, and in 1210, he died in battle. Helen Sverkersdotter, the only daughter of the deposed king, was educated at Vreta Abbey at the time of her father's death. Around 1210, Helen was one of the victims of the Vreta abductions. Sune Folkesson was of one of the two dynasties that been rivals for the Swedish throne since 1130 while Helen was from the other, the Sverker dynasty. Her relatives would not approve of the proposal of Sune Folkason who was the son of an earl who had been among Sverker's opponents in the battle in which he himself fell. According to folklore, Sune Folkason abducted Helena and took her to the Ymseborg Castle. They married and two daughters survived from their marriage; Benedicta of Bjelbo and Catherine Sunesdotter. In 1216, Helen's brother became King John I of Sweden. When he died childless in 1222, Helen and her daughters became heirs of the Sverker dynasty. In 1243, her daughter, Catherine Sunesdotter (c. 1215 – 1252) was married to King Eric XI, thus finally uniting the two Swedish dynasties. Around 1244, Benedikte Sunadotter, the younger daughter of Sune Folkason and Helena Sverkersdotter, was abducted by Laurens Pedersson, Justiciar of Östergötland while she was being educated at the Vreta convent. Benedikte was soon released and married high noble Svantepolk Knutsson, Lord of Viby.

A version for the Commodore PET by Don Dennis was released July 1979. Android Nim features real- time animation of the androids on a TRS-80. Gameplay The object of the game is to remove the last android from three rows of androids. The game's premise is simple, but its animation is impressive given the limitations of the TRS-80's display. Throughout the game androids are animated to face different directions, as if bored or engaging in conversation with one another. The game starts with three rows of androids which contain 7, 5, and 3 androids respectively. An animated android asks the player if they would like to go first. The player chooses a row and types in how many droids to remove. An animated droid at the head of the row then nods its head and raises a gun and the other androids turn to look at the selected row. The specified number of androids are then zapped with a laser beam. It is then the computer's turn—with similar effect—and play continues until the last android is removed. If the human wins, the computer is an amusingly poor sport and displays astonishment; if it wins, the computer displays a huge \\"I WIN!\\". If the computer is about to lose, it pretends to seek futile ways to avoid losing (i.e., by selecting more androids than are available in a given row) before giving up. Reception The game was reviewed in The Dragon #44 by Mark Herro.

It is also known as E238. Under this E number it is used as an animal feed preservative within EU, but not in foods intended for people. Calcium formate is stable at room temperature, is inflammable and forms orthorhombic crystals. The mineral form is very rare and called formicaite, and is known from a few boron deposits. Uses Calcium formate is used within EU as an animal feed preservative. It acidifies the feed thus preventing microbe growth and increasing shelf life. About 15 g of calcium formate addition per kg of feed lowers its pH by one. 15 g/kg is the maximum recommended feed concentration within EU – this level is thought to be safe for pigs, chickens, fish and ruminants. The compound is not environmentally harmful in feed use at these levels. Calcium formate prevents the growth bacteria such as E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus hirae in growth mediums. It also prevents the growth of fungi like Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans. However, the relevance of these experimental observations to feed preservation is not known. Calcium formate is used as a masking agent in the chrome tanning of leather. Calcium formate in tannage formulation promotes faster, more efficient leather penetration of the chrome. Calcium formate can also be used as a replacement for formic acid in the pickling operation. As a grout and cement additive, calcium formate imparts a number of desirable properties in the final product, e.g. increased hardness and decreased setting time. Its addition is desirable for work at low temperature and for inhibition of corrosion of metal substrates within cement/grout. It is also effective in the prevention of efflorescence. In drywall (gypsum board), calcium formate can function as a fire retardant. Calcium formate and urea mixtures are effective deicers, and tend to cause less corrosion of steel and cement surfaces relative to some other deicers. Research Calcium formate seems to be safe as a calcium supplement for people with one time doses of 3.9 g (1200 of calcium) per day. Increases in blood formate concentration have been observed with such doses, but in healthy subjects the formate does not accumulate, and is quickly metabolized. Calcium formate is shown to be more readily absorbed form of calcium than calcium carbonate and calcium citrate. No optic nerve damage has been observed with calcium formate supplementation – alongside with formaldehyde, formate is a major metabolic product of methanol, which can cause blindness upon ingestion. Calcium formate could be used to remove environmentally harmful (see acid rain) sulfur oxides (SOX) from fossil fuel exhausts of e.g. power plants. Calcium formate is added to wet calcium carbonate to promote the formation of gypsum when exhaust is run through it. This process is called wet flue gas desulfurization (WFGS). Gypsum binds sulfur oxides thus reducing their release to the environment via exhaust. Calcium formate seems to be more effective than or almost equally as effective as some other industrially used WFGS agents. Production Calcium formate is formed as a co-product during trimethylolpropane production. Hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide) is used as the source of calcium. Butyraldehyde and formaldehyde react in a water solution in the presence of a basic catalyst, forming an unstable intermediate product, dimethylol butyraldehyde (DIMBA). DIMBA reacts further with formaldehyde to give trimethylolpropane and calcium formate. Calcium formate is separated from the solution, heat treated to remove formaldehyde and then dried. Calcium formate can also be made from calcium hydroxide and carbon monoxide at high pressure and temperature – e.g., at 180 °C and 35 atm. It may also be made from calcium chloride and formic acid. Safety Pure calcium formate powder irritates eyes severely, but causes no skin irritation. Powder inhalation can be dangerous. The compound has a stinging taste. Ingesting liquids with high calcium formate concentrations cause severe gastrointestinal lesions.

Antonio di Padova, St. Antoine, or locally as Sent Antuan, is a basilica and the largest church of the Roman Catholic Church in Istanbul, Turkey. It is located at İstiklal Avenue No. 171 in the Beyoğlu district. Along with the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit (1846) in the Harbiye district, St. Louis of the French (1581) and Santa Maria Draperis in Beyoğlu, Sts. Peter and Paul (1841) in Galata, Assumption Church in the Moda quarter of Kadıköy, St. Stephen in Yeşilköy and Bakırköy Church in Bakırköy, St. Anthony of Padua is one of the most important Catholic churches in Istanbul, and among them has the largest community following its Masses. The original St. Anthony of Padua Church was built in 1725 by the local Italian community of Istanbul, but was later demolished and replaced with the current building which was constructed on the same location. The current St. Anthony of Padua, along with its adjacent buildings (known as the St. Antoine Apartmanları) on İstiklal Avenue, was built between 1906 and 1912 in the Venetian Neo-Gothic style, and was likewise edificed by the local Italian community of the city, mostly of Genoese and Venetian descent, who amounted to 40,000 people at the turn of the 20th century. The building was designed by the Istanbulite Levantine architect Giulio Mongeri, who also designed many other important buildings in Istanbul and Ankara; such as the Maçka Palas (which houses Armani Café and Gucci) in Nişantaşı and the Neo-Byzantine style Karaköy Palas bank building in Karaköy (Galata), Istanbul; as well as the first headquarters of Türkiye İş Bankası in Ankara. The church is considered a minor basilica,Basilique Saint Antoine de Padoue, Istanbul, Turkey, GCatholic.org. Retrieved 2011-03-16 and is run by Italian priests. Saturday Mass is in Italian and begins at 19:00, Sunday Mass is 9:30 in Polish, 10:00 in English and 17:00 in Turkish, and Tuesday Mass is in Turkish and begins at 11:00. Weekday Masses are in English at 8:00. Together with the churches of St. Mary Draperis, also on Istiklal Caddesi, and of SS. Peter and Paul in Galata, it was one of the three Levantine parishes in Beyoglu. Pope John XXIII preached in this church for 10 years, when he was the Vatican's ambassador to Turkey before being elected as pope. He is known in Turkey with the nickname \\"The Turkish Pope\\" because of his fluent Turkish and his often expressed love for Turkey and the city of Istanbul. A legal battle over the church has been going on since 2016. The Church of St Anthony of Padua has been put up for sale by a man claiming to act for the legal owner of the site. According to news reports, Sebahattin Gök obtained power of attorney from the owners of the land, and then attempted to sell the site, before lawyers acting on behalf of the Vatican put measures in place to prevent the sale.

Classes under the new college commenced July 1, 2013. History MGTC was originally established in 1973 as Houston Vocational Center, though the first classes were not held until January, 1974. At that time, its mission was to provide vocational educational programs to both secondary and post-secondary students. The school transitioned to an all- post-secondary curriculum in 1985, at which time its name was changed to Houston Area Vocational Center and its service area was expanded to the four- county area that it currently serves.

Cases of political libel and eventually damages actions were handled by the infamous Star Chamber until its abolition in 1641. By the end of that century, many elements of the common law of libel had been established. Modern slander and libel law evolved since then to mostly eradicate the use of libel laws to intimidate active political participants during a public debate. Accordingly, this is now a matter of historical interest only in all jurisdictions other than Canada, where use of the law by government, political and religious groups is common, and often used against defendants outside Canada.  No longer exists in most English speaking jurisdictions  Veronica Guerin used nicknames for underworld figures to avoid Irish libel laws. In most developed countries, a combination of discouragement to vexatious litigation, general recognition of chilling effects, and sometimes formal definition of a strategic lawsuit against public participation, serve to limit politically motivated libel suits. Many lawyers advise strongly against filing any suit against critics with political motivations. The McLibel case is usually cited as libel law backfiring. Many jurisdictions established such difficult tests for application of libel law to political statements, even exempting specific types or processes of criticism, that any specifically or overtly political comment has been effectively exempted from tort law: *Recognizing the chilling effect of such laws, American courts reformed libel law to protect free speech on matters of public interest, where plaintiffs bear onus of proving falsehood, fault and damage. All statements of opinion are immune from liability. This includes almost all political statements. *In Australia the traditional common law was deemed to be “tilted too far against free communication.”Theophanous p. 20 and courts recognized privileges for political discussion and eventually a new 2006 uniform Defamation Act in Australia. *In 2001, the British House of Lords recognized in Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd a new test for a case-by-case privilege for publications which, though otherwise actionable, dealt with a matter of public concern in a manner which was reasonable and balanced in all the circumstances. They recognized an obligation to protect journalism. *New Zealand's Defamation Act includes a qualified privilege for non-reckless and non-sentimental statements about political figures.  Canada  However, the direction of Canadian libel law has markedly differed from that in other English speaking countries. While Canadian lawyers, like those in other countries, advise strongly and publicly against legal intimidation of political critics, the Law of Defamation in Canada notes that the common law of defamation has been described by scholars and judges as “artificial and archaic” and characterized by “absurdities”, “irrationality”, and “minute and barren distinctions” (p. 1-3). Dan Burnett argued that \\"other 'free and democratic societies' have concluded that the traditional common law requires reform\\" to avoid infringing free expression and political freedom, but Canada has not. It also inhibits online journalism. Burnett says \\"Internet publication by media outlets opens the door wide to forum shopping, raising concerns that Canada will become a haven for libel plaintiffs who likely would not succeed in their more natural forum.\\" Several online journalism forums in Canada have closed or restricted access drastically due to the exposure to nuisance or vexatious litigation.  Forum shopping  The definition of libel deviates so significantly in Canada, particularly English Canada, that plaintiffs outside Canada bring libel suits against non-Canadian defendants such as the New York Post and the Washington Post – a practice known as 'forum shopping'. Burnett says \\"they likely have good legal advisers who correctly tell them that Canadian libel laws favour plaintiffs… our libel laws are the least protective of free speech in the English-speaking world.\\" = p2pnet.net = A suit by the founder of Kazaa, based in Australia, was launched against p2pnet.net, to silence critics of the company and its founder. The case was not launched, however, in Australia but in British Columbia, that being seemingly an example of this forum shopping.  Religious plaintiffs  While religious figures and movements have recourse to other laws including hate crime legislation, they have made use of the libel law's provisions intended to stop political critics of powerful church figures. = Hill v. Scientology = Despite Canadian adoption of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in the 1980s, its courts have rejected US-style limits on libel law. While it was neither a political case or one about the freedom of religion, in Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto [1995] S.C.J. No. 64, Justice Peter Cory, for the Supreme Court of Canada, stated, “I simply cannot see that the law of defamation is unduly restrictive or inhibiting”. However, other English speaking countries have ruled differently. From about 1994 to 2006, according to Burnett, \\"the highest courts in England, Australia and New Zealand have all recognized that the traditional law of libel fails to adequately protect free speech, and they have all issued decisions which begin to right the balance. Every one, that is, except Canada.\\"  Political plaintiffs  An aspect of this favouring of plaintiffs is unconcern with their political position, and the viability of political libel suits from Canada that might fail from elsewhere. In Canada, statements about politics, even from political party leaders in or on the eve of an election, are subject to the same rules of libel as other statements made under other circumstances. = Martin and Harper = Just prior to the 2006 Canadian federal election, then Prime Minister of Canada Paul Martin vowed to sue Leader of the Opposition (Canada) Stephen Harper for stating that the Liberal Party of Canada's behaviour resembled \\"organized crime\\". Harper continued to mock Martin during the election with political advertising and public appearances showing money being abused and hinting that Liberals were inclined to steal taxpayers' money by nature. No lawsuit was filed and Harper won the election. However, the attempt to curb the language of the Prime Minister's chief rival on the eve of an election was widely noted. = Green Party of Canada = The \\"open politics\\" service openpolitics.ca was sued by Wayne Crookes and West Coast Title Search in 2006 for permitting republication of comments and facts made on mailing lists and printed in mainstream news articles, and additional comment on these. As Crookes was deeply involved in the Green Party of Canada and the comments focused solely on this involvement, without mentioning his business activities at all, the case was seemingly another political libel instance. The party itself had threatened to file at least one lawsuit during the same election as the Martin-Harper incident, against former staff member Matthew Pollesel. While the Party claimed that suits were in response to reports in the press and Elections Canada regarding the party's internal finances, nothing was ever filed when Pollesel's lawyer notified the Green Party that, under Canadian libel law, an organization cannot be libeled. The threatened suit, however, had the effect of demonstrating that its purpose had been to suppress political comment during the election, and not an attempt to recover any actual damages from any actual harms suffered. = Stephen Harper vs Liberal Party = PM Stephen Harper launched a lawsuit March 13, 2008 against the Liberals over statements published on the party's website concerning the Chuck Cadman affair. This was the first time a sitting prime minister had sued the opposition for libel. The $2.5-million suit names the Liberal party, the Federal Liberal Agency of Canada and the unnamed author, or authors, of the statements published on the Liberal website two weeks ago. The articles at the centre of the lawsuit are headlined \\"Harper knew of Conservative bribery\\"Liberal.ca and \\"Harper must come clean about allegations of Conservative Bribery\\".Liberal.ca Those statements question Stephen Harper's alleged involvement in financial \\"offers\\" made to Cadman to sway his vote in a crucial 2005 Commons showdown. The suit filed Thursday in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice does not name Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion or MPs Ralph Goodale and Michael Ignatieff - whom Harper also threatened to sue. Dona Cadman says that prior to the May 2005 Budget vote, Tom Flanagan and Doug Finley, two Conservative Party officials, offered her husband, Chuck Cadman, a million-dollar life insurance policy in exchange for his vote to bring down the Liberal government. An audio tape suggests then-opposition leader Stephen Harper was not only aware of a financial offer to Chuck Cadman but gave it his personal approval.  Government plaintiffs Common law provinces= Government agencies in Canada have also sometimes used the private defamation lawsuits against their critics. More recently, the constitutional soundness of such actions have been examined closely by courts in the provinces of British Columbia (2009) and Ontario (2006) and these actions have been rejected outright on a preliminary basis as contrary to section 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Both the BC Civil Liberties Association and the Canadian Civil Liberties Association were successful in bringing motions to dismiss Government claims for alleged defamation on a preliminary basis. In the Dixon v. Powell River case (2009 - BCSC), the mere threat of civil litigation by a local government was deemed to have an illicit \\"chilling effect\\" on the freedom of speech, contrary to constitutional protections. The Quebec Contextual approach – the Rawdon test-case In the Province of Quebec, a civil law jurisdiction, the common law approach to defamation in other provinces which would lead to the outright rejection of ill-founded Government defamation claims on a preliminary basis does not apply automatically. In Quebec, these matters must, in theory, proceed to trial to determine the factual basis and context of such allegations. In 2008, a test-case seeking to affirm that local Quebec municipalities can indeed sue for \\"alleged civil defamation on a Government\\" was initiated by small town of Rawdon, Quebec with funding and other material support from the Union des municipalités du Québec against certain internet bloggers and others. If successful, the mere threat of such litigation would thus remain a tool for local municipal councils to silence and intimidate critics, where such actions would be strictly prohibited in every other Canadian province. Even before getting to trial, a Superior Court judge in Quebec issued an unprecedented interim injunction \\"not to defame the Municipality of Rawdon pending suit.\\" This unfathomable injunction became the object of much criticism by academics, the press, Canadian and other civil liberties groups who note that \\"freedom of expression, freedom of information, and freedom of the press cannot be said to co-exist with any such judicial interim order\\". The Quebec Court of Appeal is set to address the lawfulness of any such an interim order in February 2010. Quebec-based newspapers and the Canadian Civil Liberties AssociationCCLA.org have intervened in the matter. The Quebec Court of Appeal may then determine the scope of Quebec's new anti- SLAPP legislation. =Governments can't sue= The Superior Court of Justice of Ontario struck the a claim of alleged defamation brought by the Town of Halton Hills. Justice Corbett ruled: > “It is in the very nature of a democratic government itself that precludes > government from responding to criticism by means of defamation actions. . . > Governments are accountable to the people through the ballot box, and to > judges or juries in courts of law. When a government is criticized, its > recourse is in the public domain, not the court. . . . Litigation is a form > of force, and the government must not silence its critics by force.” =Failed litigation= Aurora, Meaford, Georgina and Halton Hills have all seen municipal governments attempt to use their resources to sue outspoken residents who commented on political matters. Despite the fact that governments can’t sue as corporations some councils have funded private lawsuits. = Toronto Port Authority = In 2006 the Toronto Port Authority (a quasi-Federal Government agency) started litigation against a neighbourhood residents group - Community Air. The group opposed the Port Authority's support for expanded service at the downtown Toronto City Centre Airport. The suit claims that the agency and its executive board has been defamed by comments posted on the advocacy group's website. This has also been called a Strategic lawsuit against public participation, or SLAPP suit.

They became legendary and inspired many poems.  Background  The abduction of maidens for wives seems to have been an ancient Germanic tradition. Women's marriages were clan matters to be decided by the woman's nearest male relative, often together with tribal elders. A marriage was an alliance contract and also had many economical repercussions. A man was not allowed to marry a woman from an enemy clan unless it was to seal a treaty between the clans. On the other hand, a man might want to marry an heiress from a rival clan in order to impose his own power upon that clan.  Abduction of 1210  Around 1210, Helena Sverkersdotter, the only daughter of the deposed King Sverker II, was studying at the Vreta convent when her father fell in battle. The young Sune Folkason, son of an earl who had been among Sverker's opponents in that battle and had also fallen, wished to marry her, but her relatives would not hear his proposal. Folkason abducted Helena and, according to folklore, took her to the castle of Ymseborg. They married and had two daughters. The older was Catherine of Ymseborg, who married King Eric XI in 1244.  Abduction of 1244  Around 1244, Benedikte Sunadotter, the younger daughter of Sune Folkason and Helena Sverkersdotter, was being educated at the Vreta convent. Laurens Pedersson, Justiciar of Östergötland, abducted her. One theory is that Pedersson may have been a grandson of a king of the St. Eric dynasty and wished to unite that dynasty with Benedikte's Sverker dynasty. He may also have had designs on the throne. In any case, Benedikte was released and soon married high noble Svantepolk Knutsson, Lord of Viby, with whom she had several daughters and a son, Knut, who died childless.  Abduction of 1288  In 1288, Ingrid Svantepolksdotter, one of the daughters of Benedikte and Svantepolk, was being educated at the Vreta convent. Her father had intended her to marry a Danish nobleman, the future High Justiciar David Thorsteinsen. Folke Algotsson, a knight from Gothenland (and, according to myth, a descendant of Algaut), abducted her with the help of some of his brothers and fled with her to Norway. King Magnus III, reportedly livid about the wilful breach of women's safety in convents, had one of the brothers executed. Ingrid eventually returned from Norway and became abbess of Vreta. Her son, Knut Folkason, became Overlord of Blekinge and Lister.

Early life Van de Weyer was born in Louvain on 19 January 1802. He was the son of Josse-Alexandre Van de Weyer (1769–1838) and Françoise Martine (née Goubau) Van de Weyer (1780–1853). He was the grandson of Jean-Baptiste (or Jean-Sylvain) Van de Weyer, who was from a bourgeois family of Bautersem, and Josse Goubeau, commissaire de police de la quatrième section de Bruxelles. In 1811, his family relocated to Amsterdam. The family returned to Louvain when his father was named police commissioner for the city. Jean-Sylvain studied law at the State University of Louvain and set up as a lawyer in Brussels in 1823. Career As a lawyer, he frequently defended newspapers and journalists that had fallen foul of the government of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, of which modern Belgium then formed the southern half. On the outbreak of the Belgian Revolution in 1830, Van de Weyer was in Louvain, but hurried to Brussels where he became a member of the central committee of the Provisional Government of Belgium. His command of the English language resulted in him serving as a diplomatic representative of the revolutionaries. In 1831, King Leopold I appointed Van de Weyer his \\"special representative\\" in London. The King at the time was William IV, who reigned from 1830 to 1837, when his niece became Queen Victoria who reigned until January 1901. During his tenure as Minister in London, Van de Weyer became a \\"beloved and honoured friend of the royal family,\\" as was his wife, who became close to the Queen and comforted her after the death of Albert, Prince Consort. Van de Weyer later served as the 8th Prime Minister of Belgium, succeeding Jean-Baptiste Nothomb. He was Vice- President of the London Library from 1848 till his death in 1874.

The broader area comprising Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol is known collectively as the Tre Venezie, after the Republic of Venice. Veneto is the most populous and biggest denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) producer of the three regions. Although the Tre Venezie collectively produce more red wine than white, the Veneto region produces more whites under DOC and is notably home to the Prosecco and Soave wines. The region is protected from the harsh northern European climate by the Alps, the foothills of which form Veneto's northern extremes. These cooler climes are well-suited to white varieties like Garganega (the main grape for Soave wines), soave consorzio • vino soave recioto di soave • history while the warmer Adriatic coastal plains, river valleys, and Garda Lake zone are the places where the renowned Valpolicella, Amarone and Bardolino DOC reds are produced. In Veneto, two different wine areas are clearly distinguishable: an eastern part, close to the Venice Lagoon between the hills of Treviso, the plain of Piave river and Adriatic coast, where it is typical to produce the famous Prosecco (Glera), and other varieties are grown like Merlot, Carmenere, Verduzzo, Raboso Piave, Refosco, Tocai, Verdiso, Marzemino; and the western part, close to Garda Lake and the city of Verona, famous for the wines based on the varieties Corvina, Rondinella, Garganega, Trebbiano of Soave, and Oseleta. In the central part of Veneto the winemaking transitions between the varieties and styles of the Eastern and Western parts. In that area you can find the Colli Euganei, the hills close to Padua, that is a special Mediterranean microclimatic zone; it is even famous for the Moscato fior d'arancio production, a sparkling dessert wine. Another area in the North- center of Veneto, close to Asiago, is Breganze, where the dessert wine Torcolato is produced with the Vespaiolo grape. The traditional vine training system of the eastern part is the Sylvoz system, today replaced by the Guyot system, while in the western part there is more traditionally the Pergola system. Veneto's growers use modern growing methods and systems in the vineyard and for wine making. While most of the 'classic' wines from this area are based on native grape varieties, like Glera (formerly known as Prosecco) and Verduzzo, high demand for Veneto wines in the European and US markets has galvanized the region's producers into experimentation with Cabernets, Chardonnay and Pinot varieties, among others. One of Italy's leading wine schools, Conegliano, is based here and the nation's most important wine fair, Vinitaly, takes place each spring in Verona.Wine and Food - Wine - Italian Wine Today - Made In Italy On Line Veneto is the 8th largest region of Italy in land mass, and a population of 4,371,000 ranks it 6th in that regard. It has over of vineyards, of which 35,400 are acclaimed DOC. Annual production totals 8,500,000 hectolitres, 1,700,000 or 21% of which is DOC, making it the biggest DOC producer in Italy.

Toomevara retained their title in 2004 following a comfortable 4-12 to 2-12 win over Éire Óg/Golden. It was also a remarkable fifth championship medal in six seasons for O'Brien. After a number of early exits from the provincial championship in recent years, Toomevara subsequently defeated Mount Sion by just a single point to give O'Brien his first Munster medal. After surrendering their county and provincial titles in 2005, Toomevara returned to the county championship decider once again the following year. A thrilling 1-21 to 2-14 defeat of Nenagh Éire Óg, in which O'Brien top scored with 1-4 from play, saw Toomevara take the title once again. O'Brien later won a second Munster medal following a controversial 2-9 to 2-8 defeat of Erin's Own of Cork. In 2008 O'Brien won a seventh county championship medal following a 2-14 to 0-17 defeat of old rivals Thurles Sarsfield's. Minor & under-21 O'Brien was seventeen-years-old when he made his minor championship debut for Tipperary in 1999. He collected his first Munster medal that year following a 1–13 to 2-7 defeat of Clare. Tipp progressed to the All-Ireland final where Galway provided the opposition. A 0–13 to 0–10 score line resulted in defeat for O'Brien's side. In 2003 O'Brien was in his last year as a member of the under-21 team. That year Tipperary broke through Limerick's stranglehold on the championship and O'Brien secured a Munster medal following a 2-14 to 0-17 defeat of Cork after extra-time. SeniorBeginnings= O'Brien made his senior debut on 21 April 2001 in a 1-16 to 0-13 group stage defeat of Laois in the National League. Tipperary later claimed the league title, however, O'Brien remained as a substitute for that victory. Later that year he made his championship debut when he came on as substitute for Lar Corbett in the provincial decider against Limerick. Tipperary triumphed by 2-16 to 1-17, with O'Brien collecting his first Munster medal. He later collected an All- Ireland medal as a non-playing substitute as Tipperary defeated Galway by 2-18 to 2-15. Over the next few years O'Brien remained on the periphery of the team as Tipperary went into decline. =Return to success= The appointment of Liam Sheedy as Tipperary's new manager saw O'Brien take to a more prominent role. Tipperary remained undefeated during their 2008 league campaign and qualified for the decider against Galway. A Lar Corbett goal proved decisive in the 3-18 to 3-16 victory. It was O'Brien's first National League medal on the field of play. He later collected a second Munster medal as Tipperary continued their winning streak with a 2-21 to 0-19 defeat of a resurgent Clare. After scoring 1-4 in that game he was named man of the match. Tipperary retained their provincial crown in 2009, with O'Brien collecting a third Munster medal following a 4-14 to 2-16 defeat of Waterford. On 6 September 2009 Tipperary faced four-in-a-row hopefuls Kilkenny in the All-Ireland decider. For long periods Tipp looked the likely winners, however, late goals from Henry Shefflin and substitute Martin Comerford finally killed off their efforts to secure a 2-22 to 0-23 victory. Three successive Munster titles proved beyond Tipperary, however, in spite of a shock defeat by Cork in the provincial quarter-final, Tipperary used the qualifiers to good effect and qualified for the All-Ireland decider on 5 September 2010. Kilkenny were the opponents once again as they sought a fifth successive All-Ireland crown title. \\"The Cats\\" lost talisman Henry Shefflin early in the game due to injury, while Tipp's Lar Corbett ran riot and scored a hat-trick of goals before Noel McGrath added a fourth. The 4-17 to 1-18 victory gave O'Brien his first All-Ireland medal on the field of play. Tipperary reclaimed the provincial crown in 2011 following a huge 7-19 to 0-19 drubbing of Waterford in the decider. It was O'Brien's fourth Munster medal. Tipperary subsequently faced Kilkenny in a third successive All-Ireland decider on 4 September 2011. Goals by Michael Fennelly and Richie Hogan in either half gave Kilkenny, who many viewed as the underdogs going into the game, a 2-17 to 1-16 victory. =Final years= Tipperary won their fourth Munster crown in five years in 2012 as they easily retained the title. The 2-17 to 0-16 defeat of Waterford gave O'Brien a fifth provincial winners' medal. After a poor start to their 2014 championship campaign, Tipperary reached the All-Ireland final on 7 September 2014. O'Brien started the game on the bench but was introduced as a substitute in what some consider to be the greatest game of all-time. John O'Dwyer had the chance to win the game, however, his late free drifted wide resulting in a draw. O'Brien was also sprung from the bench in the replay which Kilkenny won by 2-17 to 2-14. O'Brien announced his retirement from inter-county hurling on 26 November 2014. In a released statement he said \\"I wish to announce my retirement from the Tipperary Hurling team. It has been an honour to have represented my county at senior level since my debut in 2001. I would like to thank everyone who has supported me and made it possible for me to play, most importantly my family and friends, my club Toomevara, the management and backroom teams throughout those years which are too many to mention and also the Tipperary public.

To the right is the Propylaea, to the left the Chalkotheke. The Brauroneion was the sanctuary of Artemis Brauronia on the Athenian Acropolis, located in the southwest corner of the Acropolis plateau, between the Chalkotheke and the Propylaia in Greece. It was originally dedicated during the reign of Peisistratos. Artemis Brauronia, protector of women in pregnancy and childbirth, had her main sanctuary at Brauron, a demos on the east coast of Attica. The sanctuary on the Acropolis was of an unusual trapezoidal shape and did not contain a formal temple. Instead, a portico or stoa served that function. The stoa measured circa 38 by 6.8 m; it stood in front of the southern Acropolis wall, facing north. At its corners, there were two risalit- like side wings, each about 9.3 m long, the western one facing east and vice versa. North of the east wing stood a further short west-facing stoa. All of the sanctuary's western part, now lost, stood on the remains of the Mycenaean fortification wall. All that remains of the eastern pare are foundations for walls, cut into the bedrock, as well as some very few architectural members of limestone. One of the wings contained the wooden cult statue (xoanon) of the goddess. Women who petitioned Artemis for help habitually dedicated items of clothing, which were draped around the statue. In 346 BC, a second cult statue was erected. According to Pausanias, it was a work by Praxiteles. Pausanias wrote: :\\"There is also a sanctuary [at Athens] of Artemis Brauronia (of Brauron); the image is the work of Praxiteles, but the goddess derives her name from the parish of Brauron. The old wooden image is in Brauron, Artemis Tauria (of Tauros) as she is called.\\"Pausanias, Description of Greece 1. 23. 7 The entrance to the small sacred precinct, near its northeast corner, is still marked by seven rock-cut steps. They, and its northern enclosure, were probably created by Mnesicles during the building of the Propylaia. The date of the complex in its final shape is unclear, but a date around 430 BC, similar to that of the adjacent Propylaia, is commonly assumed. If still in use by the 4th-century, the temple would have been closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire, when the Christian Emperors issued edicts prohibiting non-Christian worship.

Her subject matter ranged from natural history through poetry to illustrations for English literary classics. In 1972 she was elected the first lady Master of the Art Workers GuildA Hundred Years of the Art Workers Guild and in 1987 was awarded the OBE (Order of the British Empire). Biography Born at 88 Kensington Park Road, Notting Hill, London, Joan Hassall was the daughter of the artist John Hassall, famous for his poster \\"Skegness is so bracing\\",John Hassall's daughter visits Skegness and his second wife, Constance Brooke Webb. Her lettersBrian North Lee, Dearest Joana: a selection of Joan Hassall's lifetime letters and art (Denby Dale, Fleece Press, 2002), . show how close she was to her younger brother, Christopher Hassall, and his early death affected her greatly. She addressed him as 'Topher' in her letters to him, until his wife, Eve, objected, whereupon she switched to 'Bruth'. Her portrait of Christopher is now in the National Portrait Gallery.Joan Hassall's portrait of her brother Christopher She attended Parsons Mead School and then trained as a teacher at the Froebel Institute. Her experiences at a rough East London secondary school convinced her that she did not want to be a teacher. She worked as her father's secretary for two years and then attended the Royal Academy Schools from 1928 to 1933. In 1931, to help out a friend because numbers for the class were dropping,Joan Hassall, 'My engraved work' in Private Library (Winter 1974), published by the Private Libraries Association. she began evening classes in wood engraving at the London Central School of Photo-engraving and Lithography in Fleet Street, where her teacher was R. John Beedham. The discovery of wood engraving had a profound influence on the rest of her life. The early years She canvassed the London publishers for commissions for wood engravings, without success, until Heinemann commissioned her in 1936 to engrave the title page of her brother Christopher's book of poems, Devil’s Dyke. She later discovered that her £5 fee had been deducted from her brother's royalties. She went on to illustrate a number of her brother's books, but the most important outcome for her was the commission to illustrate Francis Brett Young's Portrait of a Village (1937). She spent a great deal of time travelling around the area of Evesham and Pershore to make preliminary drawings for her wood engravings and produced a book that is generally considered to be one of her best. In 1940 Hassall produced an equally successful set of wood engravings to illustrate Cranford by Mrs Gaskell. She carried out a great deal of research into the costumes of the period, and was able to make preparatory drawings of a suitably slim friend wearing period costumes from the extensive collection of Dr Willett Cunnington, who lived nearby. The years in Scotland During World War II Kingsley Cook, a tutor of Book Illustration and Drawing at Edinburgh College of Art, suggested that Joan Hassall act as his replacement, a post that she accepted.An account of Hassall's time in Scotland This was a time that was, in many ways, profitable for Hassall. She was commissioned to produce a series of chapbooksReproductions of the chapbooks that Hassall produced for the Saltire Society for the Saltire Society, and established links with the publishers Oliver & Boyd that led to a number of commissions. She designed all aspects of the chapbooks, including the typography, and went on to be responsible for the overall design of some of her other books. She was, at times, very critical of how her work was reproduced in books, and turned down commissions from publishers in whom she did not have confidence. When she returned to Kensington Park Road she had her own hand press and produced a range of ephemeral publications over the years – chapbooks, Christmas cards, fliers for the local Anglican church et al. – as well as using it to print her wood engravings. She took her press with her to Malham, and carried on pulling proofs of her wood engravings to present to visitors. The later years The period after the war was one of great activity for Hassall. In 1946 she illustrated 51 Poems by Mary Webb, and then, in 1947, Our Village by Mary Russell Mitford. The wood engravings were, once again, based on drawings of models wearing authentic period costumes. 1947 saw the publication too of A Child's Garden of Verses by Robert Louis Stevenson, a charmingly illustrated book that was reprinted several times, and of Eric Linklater's Sealskin Trousers. The publisher Rupert Hart-Davis produced a limited edition of 50 copies of the latter, printed by Hague and Gill and bound by the London bookbinding firm of Sangorski & Sutcliffe. Hassall recalls that Linklater, after a rather liquid lunch, sat back after signing 20 copies and announced that he was going to sign the rest J.B. Priestley. None of these copies, if they exist, has ever come onto the market. 1950 saw the publication of The Strange World of Nature by Bernard Gooch, another book based on meticulous observation, Hassall's trademark. In the same year she created 43 illustrations for The Collected Poems of Andrew Young; the wood engravings were used for several later editions. Her skill came out strongly in the 1955 edition of The Oxford Nursery Rhyme Book by Iona and Peter Opie, where she had to produce some 150 wood engravings to blend in with the period stock blocks used by the Oxford University Press. Between 1957 and 1962 Hassall produced wood engravings for a 7 volume edition of the novels of Jane Austen by the Folio Society.Joan Hassall, 'Illustrating Jane Austen' in Folio (Summer 1975), published by the Folio Society. The edition has been reprinted many times by the Folio Society.Some of the wood engravings for Jane Austen's novelsMore wood engravings for Jane Austen's novels Hassall had already worked for the society, illustrating two works by Trollope.Illustration for Trollope's The Turkish Bath Her last major work was an edition of the poems of Robert Burns for the Limited Editions Club. Malham and retirement Hassall retired to Malham, Yorkshire, in 1976. She had always suffered from bad health, which made it difficult to complete commissions and make a living. She had continued to live in her parents' house at 88 Kensington Park Road, and had had to take in lodgers to help maintain the house. In 1973 she inherited Priory Cottage, Malham, from an old friend, Greta Hopkins, and in 1976 she decided to retire there. Her eyesight was failing, and she was overwhelmed by money problems. She said in a letter to Tim Coombs \\"I often think how wonderful it would have been to live in 88 with an adequate income, as it was such a beautiful house, but it was a 24-year struggle to make ends meet.\\" She had known Malham since 1932 and had many friends there. Friends made at London continued to visit her, she had her cats and she had her music (she played the spinet, the organ, the flute and the viol). She had the Methodist Chapel at Malham and the Anglican church at Kirkby Malham (her faith had always been important to her). Malham was her life at the end and she invited two friends from there, Norman Cawood and Barbara Hudson, to be her guests when she went to Buckingham Palace to receive the OBE. Brian North Lee, her executor, said at her funeral:Brian North Lee, Joan Hassall: an address (Wakefield, Fleece Press, 1989). \\"Joan’s retirement at Malham was arguably the most happy period of her life.\\" The warmth of his address typifies the feelings that Hassall's friends had for her. Another close friend, and former lodger at 88 Kensington Park Road, Norman Painting, gave the eulogy at her memorial service at St Giles in the Fields. An overview of Hassall's work Hassall's output consists largely of wood engravings. Some are independent engravings, mostly produced at the beginning of her career; the vast majority, however, are illustrations for books. Producing these illustrations, along with commercial commissions, was how Hassall earned her living. Her work tends to the small and meticulously observed, rather than the large and dramatic, the vignette rather than the full-page plate. Her place in the history of wood engraving is that of the highly skilled and valued practitioner rather than the innovator. She produced a great deal of commercial and more ephemeral work – bookplates, letterheads, Christmas and other cards, menus and other printed material for British Transport Hotels, booklets for British Transport films, illustrations for magazines, etc.. Her style is easy to recognise, even when work is unsigned. Most of her work is wood-engraved, but she also used scraperboard, line drawings, water colourThe dust jacket for the Saturday Book 11 and oils. Some of her work was quite high-profile. In 1948 Hassall designed the £1 postage stampThe £1 stamp designed by Hassall for the 1948 Royal Silver Wedding issued in commemoration of the Royal Silver Wedding of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. She won the competition to design the invitationHassall's invitation for the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II to the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II; she had to use scraperboard to produce the final design as there was not enough time to produce a wood engraving for such a large and complex design. She also designed the personal invitation that Prince Charles received to the coronation.Hassall's personal invitation to the Coronation for Prince Charles David Chambers' bookDavid Chambers, Joan Hassall (Pinner, Middlesex, Private Libraries Association, 1985), . gives full listings of her work. Further reading Under the direction of Brian North Lee, the Fleece Press published two collections of her letters, the first Dearest Sydney (1991) in a limited edition of 220 copies,Brian North Lee, Dearest Sydney: Joan Hassall's letters to Sydney Cockerell from Italy and France, April–May 1950 (Netherton, Fleece Press, 1991), . the second the two-volume Dearest Joana: A Selection of Joan Hassall's Lifetime Letters and Art (2000) in a limited edition of 300 copies. The Private Library (Winter 1974) contains a long autobiographical account of her life and work. Rosemary Addison's account of her connections with Scotland is both scholarly and accurate. There is a useful account of her life at Malham by W.R. Mitchell in The Dalesman.W. R. Mitchell, 'Joan Hassall: wood engraver' in The Dalesman (May 1980). There are two collections of her wood engravings. The first, by Ruari McLean, was published in 1960;Ruari McLean, The wood engravings of Joan Hassall (Oxford University Press, 1960). the second, a more definitive account by David Chambers, was published in 1985. * Joan Hassall, 'Illustrating Jane Austen', in Folio (1975 Summer), pp. 3–9.

The paper presents several difficulties posed by consciousness, including the possible insolubility of the mind-body problem owing to \\"facts beyond the reach of human concepts\\", the limits of objectivity and reductionism, the \\"phenomenological features\\" of subjective experience, the limits of human imagination, and what it means to be a particular, conscious thing. Nagel famously asserts that \\"an organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism—something it is like for the organism.\\" This assertion has achieved special status in consciousness studies as \\"the standard 'what it's like' locution.\\"Levine, Joseph (2010). Review of Uriah Kriegel, Subjective Consciousness: A Self-Representational Theory. Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews 2010 (3). Daniel Dennett, while sharply disagreeing on some points, acknowledged Nagel's paper as \\"the most widely cited and influential thought experiment about consciousness.\\" Peter Hacker analyzes Nagel's statement as not only \\"malconstructed\\" but philosophically \\"misconceived\\" as a definition of consciousness, and he asserts that Nagel's paper \\"laid the groundwork for…forty years of fresh confusion about consciousness.\\" Thesis \\"What Is it Like to Be a Bat?\\" was written by Thomas Nagel. Nagel challenges the possibility of explaining \\"the most important and characteristic feature of conscious mental phenomena\\" by reductive materialism (the philosophical position that all statements about the mind and mental states can be translated, without any loss or change in meaning, into statements about the physical). For example, a reductive physicalist's solution to the mind–body problem holds that whatever \\"consciousness\\" is, it can be fully described via physical processes in the brain and body. Nagel begins by assuming that \\"conscious experience is a widespread phenomenon\\" present in many animals (particularly mammals), even though it is \\"difficult to say [...] what provides evidence of it.\\" Thus, Nagel sees consciousness not as something exclusively human, but as something shared by many, if not all, organisms. Nagel must be speaking of something other than sensory perception, since objective facts and widespread evidence show that organisms with sensory organs have biological processes of sensory perception. In fact, what all organisms share, according to Nagel, is what he calls the \\"subjective character of experience\\" defined as follows: \\"An organism has conscious mental states if and only if there is something that it is like to be that organism – something that it is like for the organism.\\" The paper argues that the subjective nature of consciousness undermines any attempt to explain consciousness via objective, reductionist means. The subjective character of experience cannot be explained by a system of functional or intentional states. Consciousness cannot be fully explained if the subjective character of experience is ignored, and the subjective character of experience cannot be explained by a reductionist; it is a mental phenomenon that cannot be reduced to materialism. Thus for consciousness to be explained from a reductionist stance, the idea of the subjective character of experience would have to be discarded, which is absurd. Neither can a physicalist view, because in such a world each phenomenal experience had by a conscious being would have to have a physical property attributed to it, which is impossible to prove due to the subjectivity of conscious experience. Nagel argues that each and every subjective experience is connected with a \\"single point of view\\", making it unfeasible to consider any conscious experience as \\"objective\\". Nagel uses the metaphor of bats to clarify the distinction between subjective and objective concepts. Bats are mammals, so they are assumed to have conscious experience. Nagel used bats for his argument because of their highly evolved and active use of a biological sensory apparatus that is significantly different from that of many other organisms. Bats use echolocation to navigate and perceive objects. This method of perception is similar to the human sense of vision. Both sonar and vision are regarded as perceptional experiences. While it is possible to imagine what it would be like to fly, navigate by sonar, hang upside down and eat insects like a bat, that is not the same as a bat's perspective. Nagel claims that even if humans were able to metamorphose gradually into bats, their brains would not have been wired as a bat's from birth; therefore, they would only be able to experience the life and behaviors of a bat, rather than the mindset. Such is the difference between subjective and objective points of view. According to Nagel, \\"our own mental activity is the only unquestionable fact of our experience\\", meaning that each individual only knows what it is like to be them (subjectivism). Objectivity requires an unbiased, non-subjective state of perception. For Nagel, the objective perspective is not feasible, because humans are limited to subjective experience. Nagel concludes with the contention that it would be wrong to assume that physicalism is incorrect, since that position is also imperfectly understood. Physicalism claims that states and events are physical, but those physical states and events are only imperfectly characterized. Nevertheless, he holds that physicalism cannot be understood without characterizing objective and subjective experience. That is a necessary precondition for understanding the mind-body problem. Criticisms Daniel C. Dennett has been a vocal critic of the paper's assertions. Dennett denies Nagel's claim that the bat's consciousness is inaccessible, contending that any \\"interesting or theoretically important\\" features of a bat's consciousness would be amenable to third-person observation. For instance, it is clear that bats cannot detect objects more than a few meters away because echolocation has a limited range. He holds that any similar aspects of its experiences could be gleaned by further scientific experiments. Kathleen Akins argued that much about bat subjectivity, such as the function of cortical activity profiles of the bat's brain, remains to be fleshed out in neuroscientific detail, and Nagel is too quick in ruling these out as answers to his central question.

It runs from Erb Street West in the north near Uptown Waterloo, to Ottawa Street South in Kitchener to the south. It covers a distance of . The trail was opened on 5 October 1997 on abandoned Canadian Pacific Railway right of way sections, including portions of the right-of-way of the now-defunct Grand River Railway. The two cities combined resources to purchase the property. It is a part of the Trans Canada Trail.http://www.ontariotrails.on.ca/trails/view/iron-horse- trail/http://www.ontariotrails.on.ca/assets/files/pdf/Waterloo%20Trail%20Maps/Iron_Horse_Trail.pdf History=Background Much of the Iron Horse Trail's right of way was originally used for the northern section of the Grand River Railway's main line. The Grand River Railway was an interurban electric railway, which was typical in design and operations for its heyday in the 1920s. Originally terminating at Erb Street in what is now Uptown Waterloo, the line ran south all the way to Galt (via Freeport and Preston), ending at Galt's Main Street, where it joined with the Lake Erie and Northern Railway, which connected Galt with Port Dover via Brantford. The Grand River Railway was popular with passengers during the period bookended by the two world wars, but suffered from several problems in the 1950s. Increased suburbanization in the area drew populations of commuters into new suburbs which weren't served by the railway, and corresponding increased automobile traffic caused problems due to the GRNR's numerous at-grade crossings, an issue shared by the Iron Horse Trail today. Passenger service was discontinued in 1955, and as portions of the line were closed by CP Rail (the GRNR's parent company), the former right of way was given over to redevelopment, especially in southern Kitchener. Beyond Ottawa Street, the right of way is now lost to redevelopment in the form of the Rockway Municipal Golf Course, suburban residential housing, the Conestoga Parkway, and Highway 8. Other parts of the GRNR right of way are still owned by CP Rail and used for freight operations, which in some areas represent parallel tracks which were used to enable the old two-way electric passenger service. The portion of the right of way which was converted into the Iron Horse Trail has seen a number of changes in its environment over the years: the northern stretch, which once ran through farm fields, now runs through the Belmont Village and Cherry Hill areas, and the southern portion ends at the Rockway area, which was also developed in the mid-20th century. In contrast, the central section, running just to the south of the Victoria Park neighbourhood, is largely unchanged due to the endurance of the area's 19th- century housing stock. Though once running along the western edge of Kitchener, the right of way now runs through some relatively dense urban areas, giving it its current utility as a pedestrian and cycling thoroughfare with frequent connections to the road system, in contrast to many of the recreational hiking trails in the region, which tend to run through mostly- undeveloped natural areas. Recent history Since its creation, traffic on the trail has increased, and the infrastructure and amenities have gradually been improved. In 2015, over 180,000 people used the trail during a four-month spring-summer period. At that time, the most-travelled section of the trail was the northern, and the least-travelled was the southern section near Ottawa Street. In 2017, as the Region of Waterloo advanced its plans to shift intercity transit from the Charles Street Terminal and Kitchener station locations to a new transit hub at King and Victoria Streets adjacent to the then-future Ion rapid transit Kitchener Central Station, regional and municipal governments began to explore the possibility of creating a branch of the Iron Horse Trail which would connect to the new transit hub location. Councillors disagreed, however, on the route to be taken, with some willing to accept a less direct route (called Hybrid 2–3) which would (from west to east) diverge from the Iron Horse Trail main route and follow the south side of Gage Avenue, cut through Raddatz Park, follow Waverly Road, pass through Cherry Park, follow along Park Street, and then parallel the CN Huron Spur to the south until reaching Central Station. A simpler and more direct route, Alternative 1, was also proposed, which would simply parallel the Guelph Subdivision until reaching King and Victoria. Safety issues at crossings have been discussed for a number of years, especially as the number of trail users increased. In January 2018, the City of Kitchener agreed to make some changes in the area that many Trail users take to cross that street. At the time, the City indicated that an additional section of the trail would be completed by the end of 2019. On 9 September 2019, a cyclist riding along the trail was struck by a motorist while traversing the uncontrolled crossing at Victoria Street, and was subsequently airlifted to hospital. The City of Kitchener renewed its promise for safety upgrades to the area, proposing a refuge island as an improvement to be rolled into its general trail upgrades. The City of Kitchener began a set of comprehensive trail upgrades in 2019, starting with the southern section from Queen Street to Ottawa Street from June to October, and the northern section from John Street to Queen Street from September through the fall. Major features of the upgrade include a focus on rolling out some previous trail improvements to particular areas, such as new benches, lighting, and widening, across the whole trail, as well as implementing new, standardized wayfinding signage, creating a distinctive image for the Iron Horse and making trail entry points easier to find from the street, as well as helping trail users find destinations. In 2020, it was announced that over $900,000 in joint federal and provincial funding was being allocated to further trail improvements as part of a larger $24 million funding package dedicated to public transit and active transportation in Waterloo Region. These improvements would comprise around of additional pedestrian paths and bikeways intended primarily to better connect the main Iron Horse Trail route to public transit.

The Chalkotheke (Greek for \\"bronze store\\") was a structure on the Athenian Acropolis, Greece. Its name and function are only known from 4th century BC inscriptions.Inscriptiones Graecae II² 120, 1430. One decree orders the listing of all objects stored in the Chalkotheke and the erection of a stele inscribed with that list in front of the building.Inscriptiones Graecae II² 120. Remains of a structure discovered to the east of the sanctuary of Artemis Brauronia and immediately to the southwest of the Parthenon have been suggested to be those of the Chalkotheke. Only scant limestone foundations and rock-cut foundation trenches survive. The building stood in front of the southern Acropolis wall and was circa 43 m long and 14 m wide, fronted on its northern long side by a portico of 4.5 m width. To make room for that portico, the southernmost portion of the rock-cut steps leading up to the west facade of the Parthenon had to be cut away. Thus, the portico is assumed to have been an early fourth century BC addition, while the main part of the structure is thought to be roughly contemporary with the Parthenon, i.e. to date to the mid-fifth century. A major renovation appears to have taken place during Roman times, as indicated by numerous fragments of architectural members that are definitely Roman in date and have dimensions matching those of the Chalkotheke.

Folklorist J. Frank Dobie devoted part of his book \\"Apache Gold and Yaqui Silver\\" to the story of this legendary lost gold mine. The mine was supposedly located at the bottom of a canyon, beside a river and an abandoned hacienda. Surrounding the site were groves of oranges, hence the name El Naranjal, which means the orange grove in Spanish. Alternately, some legends point to orange-colored gold ore from the mine as a source of the name. Unlike other lost or legendary mines in this area, there is little hard evidence it ever existed, and may be purely a legend, taken from garbled accounts of the far more popular legendary lost mines of Tayopa.

Draft  Müller was drafted by the Washington Capitals as their ninth-round pick in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft, 275th overall, but never played for the team.  Career  He won the German championship with the Krefeld Pinguine in 2002–03, repeating the feat with the Adler Mannheim in 2006–07.  Illness and death  In November 2006, Müller was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor, known as glioblastoma multiforme. Part of the tumor was surgically removed, followed by chemotherapy and radiation treatment later in the year. It seemed to be impossible for him to play professional ice hockey any longer but Müller recovered and had his comeback on February 3, 2007, at the DEL All-Star Game 2007. In 2008, he was reappointed to the national team at the Skoda Cup in Switzerland. In August of that same year, while playing for the Kölner Haie, the tumor continued to grow, requiring another operation. After that he absolved his physician, [Wolfgang Wick], from patient/physician confidentiality. Wick told the media that Müller was terminally ill and already exceeded anticipated average life, as only 3% of the people having the same cancer live over five years. On December 18, 2008, his doctor decided Müller was no longer cleared to play, as his condition grew worse. He died of brain cancer on May 21, 2009; he is survived by his two children. After his death it was announced that the Kölner Haie, Adler Mannheim and EHC Klostersee will all retire his number 80. EHC München also retired his number 80, even though Müller had never played for München. The DEL also announced that starting with the season 2009/10 the number 80 would never be used in the league again. In 2017 his silhouette was used for the logo of the 2017 IIHF World Championship.

He is currently an assistant professor in 2D studies at the University of Arizona. Gipe derives his paintings from an “irredeemable” image pool of ideological photographs. Since the 1980s, every work has come from an archive of propaganda tracts, social realist photography books and other art “approved” by politically driven authorities. Appropriating imagery from photo journals and magazines from the 1930s to the 1970s, his paintings translate small black and white images into large, visually seductive color works. Radically severed from their original contexts, the intention is for these reinterpretations to actively force the spectator to reconstruct the images' ideological significance. He has exhibited internationally, including solo museum exhibitions at the Laguna Art Museum, Laguna Beach, CA; Amerika-Haus, Berlin; Worcester Art Museum, Worcester, MA; Kunstverein Düsseldorf; and The Chrysler Museum, Norfolk, VA. His work is in numerous public collections, including the Brooklyn Museum of Art, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, San Jose Museum of Art, Santa Barbara Museum of Art, Yale University Library, Zimmerli Archive-Rutgers University, Boise Art Museum, Cincinnati Art Museum, and the Norton Museum of Art, Palm Beach.

He explained Adoption of the test by Rotary In 1940s, when Taylor was an international director of Rotary, he offered the Four Way Test to the organization, and it was adopted by Rotary for its internal and promotional use. Never changed, the twenty four word Four Way Test remains today a central part of the permanent Rotary structure throughout the world, and is held as the standard by which all behaviour should be measured. The Four Way Test has been promoted around the world and is used in myriad forms to encourage personal and business ethical practices.

He previously played in the National Hockey League with the Chicago Blackhawks, Tampa Bay Lightning, St. Louis Blues and the Colorado Avalanche. Playing career Kočí was drafted 146th overall in the 2000 NHL Entry Draft by the Pittsburgh Penguins. Kočí played in the WHL with the Prince George Cougars in the 2000-01 season before turning professional for the 2001-02 season. Kočí spent the next five years with the Penguins minor-league affiliates, between the Wheeling Nailers of the ECHL and Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins of the AHL. Prior to the 2006-07 season, Kočí signed with the Chicago Blackhawks on July 17, 2006. Kočí was assigned to the Blackhawks affiliate, the Norfolk Admirals, but made his NHL debut on March 10, 2007, against the Phoenix Coyotes, and amassed 32 penalty minutes in three fights. He lost his first fight to Josh Gratton, but managed to get a rematch in which he fared much better. He fought defenceman Nick Boynton as well. By the end of the 2006–07 season, David played in nine games and collected 88 penalty minutes. During the Blackhawks' loss to the Boston Bruins on October 25, 2007, Kočí got into one of the nastiest hockey brawls in recent hockey memory with Bruins defenceman Zdeno Chára. Kočí, who had broken his nose several days before, and Chára started punching each other; blood started to spatter from Kočí's nose. The Blackhawks placed Kočí on injured reserve and he missed about two weeks. On July 1, 2008, Kočí signed with the Tampa Bay Lightning to a one-year deal. During the 2008–09 season, on October 21, 2008, David was claimed off waivers by St. Louis Blues after only playing one game for Tampa Bay. Kočí then returned to the Lightning after he was placed on waivers after 4 games with the Blues. Kočí scored his first NHL goal in a 3-2 defeat against the Montreal Canadiens on March 26, 2009. The puck was actually tapped in by a Canadiens player but credit was given to him. On July 1, 2009, Kočí signed a one-year contract with the Colorado Avalanche. He scored his first goal with the Avalanche, and second career goal, when he unintentionally deflected in a Brett Clark shot in a 3-2 victory over the Calgary Flames on October 28, 2009. On December 15, 2009, during a 6-1 defeat to the Washington Capitals, Kočí raised ire after he was ejected from the game after a major boarding penalty on Capitals defenseman Mike Green. He was subsequently fined by the NHL. Kočí recorded 11 Fighting Majors before suffering a broken hand in a fight against D.J. King of the St. Louis Blues on February 8, 2010. He finished the 2009–10 season with a career-high 43 games and was re-signed to a one-year contract by the Avalanche on June 2, 2010. A free agent, on September 1, 2011, Koci was invited to the Winnipeg Jets training Camp before he was released prior to the 2011–12 season on September 30, 2011. In returning to his native Czech Republic, he linked up with his former youth club, HC Sparta Praha, and made his long-awaited Czech Extraliga debut. In leading Sparta with 132 penalty minutes, Koci also contributed with 5 assists, to earn a one-year extension with the club on May 21, 2012.

Biography  Johnson was born in Gateshead. the son of Samuel Johnson and Thomasina (Tina) Scott. He was brother to Kenneth (who died in September 1964), Raymond (Jimmy) and two sisters Valerie and Catherine. Johnson was raised in Gateshead and lived on the Springwell Estate. From an early age he was interested in music and played guitar, which he wore around his neck. Later he became a member of the band Pigmeat along with Jim Murray and Ray Stubbs. After playing bass guitar at Live Theatre in a panto he was asked to act in the show. He applied for Equity membership but they already had a 'Ron Johnson' so he used his father's name of 'Sammy'. He appeared in several TV productions and often worked with local writers like C. P. Taylor, Tom Hadaway, Leonard Barras and Arthur McKenzie but continued to be a musician with the 'Ray Stubbs R&B; Allstars' as well as forming 'Matt Vinyl and the Decorators'. Johnson was cast as Martin Cooper in the second series of Auf Wiedersehen, Pet. He was then chosen by Jimmy Nail to play 'Stick' in Spender, which was written by Jimmy Nail and Ian La Frenais. Other famous roles he played were in VIZ's Sid the Sexist and in ITV's adaptation of Catherine Cookson's The Gambling Man as Victor Pittie. He then turned to scriptwriting and moved to Spain in the hills above Málaga, which is where he died while out jogging in 1998 at the age of 49. After his death, the Sammy Johnson Memorial Fund was set up. There is a biennial variety concert named Sunday for Sammy hosted by Tim Healy and (until 2008) Jimmy Nail, featuring sketches with North East personalities. Kevin Whately, Denise Welch and Peter Beardsley are amongst the regular contributors.

She received an MFA degree in sculpture and experimental filmmaking from the same school in 1985. Creative career Puett is a trans-disciplinary creative producer in the areas of installation art practices, clothing design, architecture, photography, and fine art. Art practice Her work uses conceptual tools including research-based methods in history, biology, new economies, design, craft and collaboration. Morgan's early work forged new territory by intervening into the fashion system with a series of storefront installations and clothing/dwelling/event projects in Manhattan, New York in the 1980s and 90s, then produced a long series of research installations on the histories of the needle trade systems in museums and festivals around the world. her practice has been innovative in that it has encouraged new forms of social engagement in art. Fashion Work Between 1985 and 1997, Puett was known for her \\"upscale depression era\\" fashion designs, sold through her New York boutique. When her final store closed in 1997, she held an exhibition of the leftover business items, such as cheques, business cards and unsold clothes, dipped in beeswax.

It was named for some of the earliest settlers of that part of the Oregon Country, French Canadian/Métis people who were mostly former employees of the Hudson's Bay Company. French Prairie is also known as an early Métis settlement in the Pacific Northwest history.Barman, Jean French Canadians, furs, and indigenous women in the making of the Pacific Northwest. UBC Press. Vancouver 2014. Chapter 7: \\"Initiating Permanent Settlement\\" History=European American settlement St. Paul Roman Catholic Church in St. Paul The European presence in the French Prairie area began with Wallace House in 1812, near the present city of Keizer, Oregon. The station was a fur trading post built by William Wallace Matthews and John C. Halsley of the Pacific Fur Company.Henry, Alexander, and David Thompson. New Light on the Early History of the Greater Northwest: The Manuscript Journals of Alexander Henry, Fur Trader of the Northwest Company, and of David Thompson, Official Geographer and Explorer of the Same Company, 1799-1814 ; Exploration and Adventure among the Indians on the Red, Saskatchewan, Missouri, and Columbia Rivers. Edited by Elliott Coues. Vol. 2. New York City: Francis P. Harper, 1897. pp. 817-818. The Willamette Trading Post was established in 1814 by the North West Company near the site of Champoeg. In the 1830s the French Canadian settlers, who were Roman Catholic, petitioned to Norbert Provencher, the Bishop of Juliopolis at the Red River Colony (present-day Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada) to have a priest sent to them. Two of these petitions were sent in 1836 and 1837. Bishop François Norbert Blanchet finally arrived in the French Prairie area in 1838. These first French Canadian settlers built hewn log homes in the French style and started wheat farms.Chapman, J. S. (1993). French prairie ceramics: the Harriet D. Munnick archaeological collection, circa 1820-1860: a catalog and Northwest comparative guide. Anthropology northwest, no. 8. Corvallis, Or: Dept. of Anthropology, Oregon State University. The homes were built with clay and stick chimneys, ash bark roofs, and animal skin windows that were similar to the homes built on the eastern Canadian frontier. By 1843, approximately 100 French Canadian/Métis families lived on the prairie. The St. Paul Roman Catholic Church, in St. Paul, was built in 1846 by the settlers of French Prairie and is the oldest brick building still standing in the Pacific Northwest. Later settlement For a short time in the 1880s the Oregonian Railway Company had a station named French Prairie about two miles southeast of the city of St. Paul. French Prairie today The French Prairie area is still an important agricultural area of the Willamette Valley, and there is concern about urban development encroaching on arable land. Geography Generally, the French Prairie is bounded by the Pudding River on the east, the Salem-Keizer metropolitan area on the south, and the Willamette River on both the north and west as the Willamette makes a 90 degree turn to the south near Newberg. Settlements on French Prairie founded by French Canadians include Butteville, Champoeg, Gervais, Saint Louis, and St. Paul.

Although there are slight variations between the states, most students in Year 11 are aged between sixteen and seventeen. Queensland year eleven students are the youngest in the country, as they usually enter at age fifteen. In New South Wales, Year 11 is the shortest year as it only lasts three whole terms. Year Twelve begins its first term where Year 11 would have its fourth. New Zealand In New Zealand, Year Eleven is the eleventh full year of compulsory education (5-year-olds usually start their first year in Year 0 until the new calendar year). Students entering Year Eleven are usually aged fifteen between 14.5 and 16, but there is no minimum age. Year Eleven pupils are educated in Secondary schools or in Area schools. Year 11 was previously known as the 5th Form and for most students they are studying for NCEA Level 1 which equates to what was previously known as School Certificate.

Early life Charles François Gommaire Buls was born in Brussels as the son of a goldsmith from the region of Mechelen. Buls received an artistic education, and spent a year in Paris, and nine months in Italy, studying fine arts. He also learned several languages including English, German, Italian and Latin, besides his mother tongue Dutch. He followed in his father's footsteps and worked as a goldsmith. In 1862 he became a Freemason in \\"Les vrais amis\\", and in 1871 joined \\"La libre pensée\\". At the same time, he was a member of \\"de Veldbloem\\" and \\"Vlamingen vooruit\\", two Flemish organisations of the Flemish movement. Together with his brother in law, Leo Van der Kindere, the later mayor of Uccle, he became a \\"flamingant\\". Politics Charles Buls fountain, Grasmarkt/Rue du Marché aux Herbes-Agora Square, Brussels. Buls entered politics in 1870 as a Flemish candidate on a radical list but he was not elected until 1877, when he was elected to the Brussels city council on a liberal list. He became schepen or échevin of education in 1879. Buls was a supporter of progressive causes, especially in language issues and education, and the education of women, on which he wrote frequently. He was a supporter of Isabelle Gatti de Gamond's educational reforms. From 1879 on he played an important role in the development of Flemish education in Brussels. On the national stage, Buls served in the Belgian Chamber of Representatives in 1882, and again from 1886 to 1894. Buls became Mayor of Brussels in 1881 and remained in office until 1899. At his initiative policemen had to be able to speak both French and Dutch and bilingual signposting was established throughout the city. However, along with these reforms, his most lasting achievement was the result of his opposition to the grandiose architectural schemes of King Leopold II, and the resulting preservation of old parts of Brussels.CHARLES BULS, URBAN DESIGN at webcache.googleusercontent.com In particular, Buls was a steadfast defender and admirer of the Mont des Arts and the Grand Place, now a UNESCO World Heritage site, successfully proposing the 1883 city ordinance protecting the façades of the Grand Place buildings and providing funds for their restoration which took place between 1883 and 1923. In 1899, the architects of Brussels who had been involved in this restoration work paid for a memorial commemorating Buls, designed by Victor Horta and executed by Victor Rousseau, to be placed in the rebuilt \\"L'Etoile\\" or \\"De Ster\\" house on the Grand-Place. At the reopening of the restored Town Hall, Buls greeted Leopold II in Dutch, and the King replied in the same language, which was unusual at the time. In 1999, a new fountain with a larger-than- life-sized seated statue of Buls and his dog was erected at the Place Agoraplein, close to the Grand Place. Buls was an accomplished and prolific author, not merely on educational and artistic issues but also publishing accounts of his travels abroad.

Riedler was born in Graz, Austria, and studied mechanical engineering at the Technische Hochschule (TH) Graz from 1866-1871. After graduation he took on a succession of academic appointments. He first became an assistant at the TH Brünn (1871-1873); then in 1873 moved to the TH Vienna, first as an assistant, then from 1875 onwards as a designer of machines. From 1880 to 1883, Riedler worked as associate professor at the TH Munich. In 1883 he became full professor at the TH Aachen. In 1888 he joined the TH Berlin as Professor for Mechanical Engineering, where he remained until retirement in 1920. From 1899 to 1900, he was appointed the school's principal (rector) and led discussions on how to celebrate its 100th anniversary. As a result, Riedler and Adolf Slaby (1849–1913) convinced Kaiser Wilhelm II (1859–1941) to allow Prussian technical universities to award doctorates. Although the government did not immediately consent, this effort led eventually to the school's reconstitution as today's Technical University of Berlin. Riedler first received international recognition for his reports on the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition (1876) and Paris Exposition Universelle (1878). He was later widely known for his efficient, high-speed pumps widely adopted in waterworks and in draining mines. Riedler was also known for his 1896 book \\"Das Maschinen-Zeichnen\\", (Machine Drawing) which introduced modern technical drawing. Riedler was actively involved in the early development of internal combustion engines, both for gasoline and diesel fuel. In 1903 he established the Laboratory for Internal Combustion Engines at the TH Berlin, expanded in 1907 to include investigations of motor vehicles. As laboratory director, Riedler designed a pioneering roller test stand. He also received what was probably the first research contract to investigate fuels specifically for aircraft engines (particularly benzene). In 1897 Riedler received the Grashof medal, the German Engineers' Association's highest honor. The Austrian Engineers' and Architects' Association appointed him honorary member in 1900 and awarded him their Gold Medal in 1931. In 1911 his alma mater TH Graz awarded him an honorary doctorate.

The ZIP code is 17582. It is served by the Penn Manor School District and is the terminus of Pennsylvania Route 441 and Pennsylvania Route 999. As of the 2010 census the population was 729. History The French-Canadian fur trader Martin Chartier and his son Peter Chartier established a trading post near this area in 1718. A monument was erected on the spot in 1925 by the Pennsylvania Historical Commission and the Lancaster County Historical Society.Martin Chartier Also called the \\"Borough of Washington\\" or \\"Washingtonboro\\" in the past, the small community was settled in 1810 and incorporated in 1827. It was a center of river trade and river jobs, as it is located near the site of the first colonial era animal-powered ferry across the lower Susquehanna River—Wright's Ferry between present-day Columbia and Wrightsville. Due to the decline of river trade and jobs, the Borough of Washington was dissolved politically, effective December 31, 1973, becoming part of Manor Township.Lancaster County, Pennsylvania Deed Book R64, Page 313. Geography Washington Boro is located in western Lancaster County, in the northwest corner of Manor Township. It is situated on the east bank of the Susquehanna River opposite Leibharts Corner in York County. The Susquehanna in this area is impounded by the Safe Harbor Dam to the southeast, forming Lake Clarke. Washington Boro is at the center of what was known in colonial times as the Conejohela Flats on the Susquehanna.[http://travelingluck.com/North+America/United+States/Pennsylvania/_4557312_Conejohela+Valley.html#local_map Conejohela map] Pennsylvania Route 441 has its southern terminus in Washington Boro and leads north (upriver) to Columbia.

Attractions The village contains a number of old hotels used to attract travelers, which are now private homes. A volunteer fire department, Goodwill Fire Company No. 1, was organized in March 1917 and chartered September 8, 1918. It merged with three other neighboring fire companies to create Blue Rock Fire Rescue circa 2011. The former Patriotic Sons of America Lodge now serves as a community hall.

Reception Scott Yanow's five-star AllMusic review calls the recording \\"[a]rguably John Coltrane's finest all-around album.\\" A review in All About Jazz states: \\"Coltrane Live at Birdland showcases 'The Great Quartet' in excellent form: Elvin banging and cursin', McCoy a steady force maintaining the form, Jimmy Garrison pacing the beat and Coltrane stretching out into space filling the void... A definite collectors' item.\\" Reviewer C. Michael Bailey wrote: \\"If the listener wishes to hear the master in transition, look no further than Coltrane Live at Birdland.\\" Leroi Jones wrote: \\"There is a daringly human quality to John Coltrane's music that makes itself felt, wherever he records. If you can hear, this music will make you think of a lot of weird and wonderful things. You might even become one of them.\\" Regarding the track \\"Alabama,\\" Ben Ratliff wrote: \\"It is a striking piece of music. If anyone wants to begin to understand how Coltrane could inspire so much awe so quickly, the reason is probably inside 'Alabama.' The incantational tumult he could raise in a long improvisation, the steel-trap knowledge of harmony, the writing — that's all very impressive. But 'Alabama' is also an accurate psychological portrait of a time, a complicated mood that nobody else could render so well.\\" Track listing All songs written by John Coltrane except as indicated #\\"Afro Blue\\" (Mongo Santamaria) – 10:50 #\\"I Want to Talk About You\\" (Billy Eckstine) – 8:11 #\\"The Promise\\" – 8:10 #\\"Alabama\\" – 5:09 #\\"Your Lady\\" – 6:39 ;Compact Disc bonus track # * \\"Vilia\\" – 4:36 \\"Vilia\\" is the main melodic statement to the Franz Lehár piece \\"Vivias\\", set to a swing feel and chord changes.

It is situated approximately north-west of Beverley town centre and west of the village of Leconfield. to the south-east is Cherry Burton. To the west lie the hamlets of Kiplingcotes ( away due west) and Gardham ( to the south-west). South Dalton lies 1.5 miles to the north-west. The village itself lies to the west of the B1248 road in its own shallow dale. The village's buildings are almost entirely situated either side of Main Street. Along this street lie both the village pub and the parish church of St Mary, which is a Grade II* listed building. The civil parish is formed by the village of Etton and part of the hamlet of Kiplingcotes. According to the 2011 UK Census, Etton parish had a population of 277, a decrease on the 2001 UK Census figure of 285. Etton is significant as the 1584 birthplace of Rev John Lothropp, founder of Barnstable, Massachusetts. Several Lothropp family members have death or burial dates recorded as 6 January 1588, but as there is no record of a catastrophic event on that date, it is believed to be merely a recording date to catch up on vital statistics which had gone unreported for some length of time. Thomas Carling, who emigrated from Etton to Canada in 1818, used 'a recipe from his native Yorkshire' to found the Carling Brewery in 1840. Etton is also home to the Holderness Hunt, whose kennels are located on the south- east of the village. Main Street, flooded in June 2007 In 1823 Etton was in the Wapentake of Harthill. The village had a population of 380, with occupations including nine farmers, two shopkeepers, a carpenter & wheelwright, a boot & shoe maker, a tailor, a corn miller, and the landlord of the Light Dragoon public house. There were two gentlemen, one gentlewoman, a Lady, a vicar, and a schoolmaster who was also the parish clerk. Once a week two carriers operated between the village and Beverley. The patron of the village Church of St Mary was the Archbishop of York. Etton has been known to suffer quite badly during floods, due to its position in a small valley. The most recent flood in the village, 25 June 2007, has been said to be the worst seen in 50 years.

Rasa means \\"flavour\\", and the theory of rasa is the primary concept behind classical Indian arts including theatre, music, dance, poetry, and sculpture. Much of the content of traditional Indian arts revolves around the relationship between a man and a woman. The primary emotion thus generated is Sringara. The romantic relationship between lover and beloved is a metaphor for the relationship between the individual and the divine. Classical theater/dancers (i.e. Bharatanatyam, Odissi, Mohiniyattam) refer to Sringara as 'the Mother of all rasas.' Sringara gives scope for a myriad of other emotions including jealousy, fear, anger, compassion, and of course for the expression of physical intimacy. No other Rasa has such a vast scope. The treatment and performance of Sringara varies on a large scale from the grotesque (as in Koodiyattam) to very refined and subtle (as in some styles of Bharatanatyam, or in Odissi). Expression of Sringāra in Bharatanatyam The attraction between lover and beloved is a metaphor for the relationship between the individual and the divine, the Nara-Narayana relationship.

Born Berthe Dutoit in the Valais area of French Switzerland, the daughter of a socialist engineer, Hamilton moved to Paris as a young woman. There, she worked as a fashion journalist and, in the left-wing ferment of the early 1930s, became associated with the early Trotskyist movement and with others such as the Greek archaeo- Marxists. She moved to London in the 1930s, working as a dance teacher and moving in radical art and music circles, then as an industrial worker during the war when she was also the secretary of Newark Labour Party. Maintaining her links with Trotskyists in Paris (including Pierre Frank) she had a key role in linking British and French Trotskyists during and just after the Second World War. During the war she sheltered emigres from Europe in London. Later she ran her own business importing industrial diamonds which enabled her to help finance the Healy wing of the British Trotskyists. From Hamilton's arrival in England, she was a member of various Trotskyist groupings, including the early Militant Group, the (Workers' International League and the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP). Hamilton joined Gerry Healy's split from the RCP, which became The Club and later the Socialist Labour League (SLL). The SLL was part of the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI). Hamilton was for many years closely linked with Gerry Healy but, in 1971, she sided with Pierre Lambert and the French OCI Internationalist Communist Organisation when the ICFI split into two, ostensibly over the place of philosophy in Marxist theory, but equally about control of the ICFI after the OCI grew to be larger than the SLL in the late 1960s. She remained a formal but dissident member of the SLL until the formation of the Bulletin Group in 1974-5. She took public stands as a Trotskyist, condemning Healy's allegations that Joseph Hansen, one of the American Socialist Workers Party leaders, was a CIA agent. Hamilton co-founded the British Committee for the Reconstruction of the Fourth International (BCRFI) after disagreements with Robin Blick and John Archer within the Bulletin Group, which then split. She later joined the Socialist Labour Group when the two sections of the original Bulletin Group joined together again in 1980. She maintained an active membership of the Labour Party for most of her life in Britain, in North London, in Newark during the war and, from the 1940s until old age, in Westminster. She was the aunt of Charles Dutoit, the conductor.

Written and directed by Leo Eaton, it was first broadcast on 8 March 1968 on ATV Midlands. In this episode, Spectrum pursues a Mysteron agent carrying a stolen vial of a lethal synthetic virus. Plot At a microbiological laboratory near Manchester, England, Dr Denton and his assistant, Judy Chapman, activate a culture of K14, a synthetic virus. Later, as Chapman is driving home in her car, Captain Black (voiced by Donald Gray) sets a trap for her by blocking the road with a fuel tanker. Chapman crashes into the tanker and is killed instantly, whereupon she is reconstructed by the Mysterons (voiced by Donald Gray) to carry out their threat to destroy the \\"Place of the Angels\\". Returning to the laboratory, the Mysteron agent strangles a security guard with a pair of mechanical hands and steals the vial containing the K14. She then boards an airliner bound for New York. Denton radios Cloudbase to request Spectrum's assistance and Colonel White (voiced by Donald Gray) dispatches Captains Scarlet and Blue (voiced by Francis Matthews and Ed Bishop) to the laboratory. On arrival, Scarlet and Blue learn that K14 is the most lethal virus ever developed and that if the vial were opened its contents could kill ten million people. When Chapman is sighted at New York International Airport, Scarlet and Blue fly to the United States and chase the reconstruction along the Interstate Highway in a Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle. Acting on the telepathically-relayed instructions of Black, Chapman abandons her car, leaving behind what appears to be the vial of K14 with its seal broken. A disinfection operation is launched and Scarlet and Blue are placed in quarantine. However, samples from the car test negative for K14 and it becomes clear that Chapman, having tricked Spectrum, still has the virus. Hours pass and Chapman is spotted in numerous locations across North America, including Los Angeles. From the latter's name, which is Spanish for \\"The Angels\\", Scarlet deduces that the Mysteron threat is against LA. Flying a Spectrum Passenger Jet, Scarlet and Blue pursue Chapman as she drives along the Colorado River. White informs the officers that the reconstruction is heading for the Boulder Dam, presumably to release the K14 into the Los Angeles reservoir and contaminate the city's water supply. Scarlet ejects and lands on the dam. Despite taking a bullet from the armed Chapman, he returns fire and the reconstruction loses her footing, falling over the side of the dam to her death. Scarlet manages to retrieve the dropped vial from a ledge before it ends up in the reservoir. A frantic White radios the officer, who replies that the \\"Place of Angels\\" is safe. Production Leo Eaton, who had worked as an assistant director on ITC's The Saint, joined Century 21 as a first assistant director during the pre-production of Captain Scarlet.Bentley 2001, p. 33. Then 22 years old, he quickly expressed an interest in writing and directing for the series, and after directing several commercials for the Thunderbirds-themed Zoom and Fab ice lollies, he was given the opportunity to both write and direct an episode. The result, \\"Place of Angels\\", was Eaton's first filmed script as well as his directorial debut. A number of script changes were made prior to filming: the episode's working title was \\"The City of Angels\\" and as originally scripted the Mysterons vowed to destroy \\"the population of the City of Angels\\".Bentley 2001, p. 85. In a scene that was written but not filmed, Scarlet and Blue, on arrival at the laboratory, learn that the security guard was strangled not by hand but with the help of machinery. The ending was also changed: originally Scarlet was to have retrieved the K14 from a binoculars case, where the reconstructed Chapman had placed it before falling to her death. The first scene of the episode, in which Dr Denton activates the K14 virus, recycles incidental music from Stingray. The airliner in which the reconstructed Chapman flies to New York was a re-use of a scale model originally built as the RTL2 Transporter for the Thunderbirds episode \\"The Cham-Cham\\". Its puppet-sized cabin was a re-use of the interior of Flight 104 from the Captain Scarlet episode of the same name. The New York and Los Angeles airport models were constructed partly from props first seen in \\"The Cham-Cham\\" and the earlier Thunderbirds episode \\"The Duchess Assignment\\". The models of the decontamination helicopter and dome were first seen as a rescue helicopter in the film Thunderbirds Are Go (1966) and a Frost Line Outer Space Defence System dome in the earlier Captain Scarlet episode \\"Avalanche\\". \\"Place of Angels\\" includes a rare appearance by the character of Dr Fawn. However, as actor Charles Tingwell, the voice of Fawn, had left the series before this episode was produced, the character does not have any lines. Broadcast and reception \\"Place of Angels\\" had its first UK network broadcast on 29 April 1994 on BBC2. The broadcast was delayed by ten minutes due to over-running live coverage of the World Snooker Championship semi-final between Steve Davis and Stephen Hendry. Critical response Anthony Clark of sci-fi-online.com describes the plot of \\"Place of Angels\\" as \\"not great\\" but regards it as better-paced than that of \\"Flight 104\\". He also writes that the episode has a \\"reasonable sense of tension and some sharp direction\\". The episode has drawn comment for its violence. Andrew Thomas of Dreamwatch magazine considers the death of the original Chapman, culminating in the sight of the character's \\"mangled body\\", to be one of the series' more violent moments. Andrew Pixley and Julie Rogers of Starburst note the horror of the reconstruction's death, which Shane M. Dallmann of Video Watchdog describes as \\"one of the series' more show-stopping demises\\". Pixley and Rogers also note the \\"cryptic\\" nature of the Mysteron threat against the eponymous \\"place of angels\\".

Some theories have equated this figure with the \\"Darius the Mede\\" named in the Book of Daniel. He is not mentioned in the histories of Herodotus or Ctesias, and many scholars doubt that he actually existed. The question of his existence impacts on whether the kingdom of the Medes merged peacefully with that of the Persians in about 537 BC, as narrated by Xenophon (8.6.22, 8.7.1), or was subjugated in the rebellion of the Persians against Cyrus' grandfather in 559 BC, a date derived from Herodotus (1.214) and almost universally accepted by current scholarship.  Xenophon’s Cyropaedia  According to Xenophon's Cyropaedia (1.5.2), Cyaxares II followed king Astyages to the throne of the Median Empire, and he was also the brother of Mandane, Cyrus the Great's mother (1.2.1, 1.4.7). He describes the Persian Cyrus as leading the campaign to conquer Babylon in 539 BC, while his uncle Cyaxares remained in Ecbatana.Cyropaedia 6.3.2, 7.4.16, 8.5.17. Cyaxares was by then an old man,Cyropaedia 4.5.32, 6.1.6. and because Cyrus was in command of the campaign, the army came to regard Cyrus as king. After Cyrus invited Cyaxares to a palace he had prepared for him in Babylon, Cyaxares granted him his daughter (Cyrus’s first cousin) in marriage, with the Median kingdom as her dowry.Cyropaedia 8.5.19. Cyaxares nominally reigned from Babylon as head of the Medo-Persian empire for two years until his death,(Cyropaedia 8.6.22, 8.7.1. the real power being Cyrus'.Cyropaedia 8.6.22, 8.7.1. Upon the death of Cyaxares, the empire passed peaceably to Cyrus.Cyropaedia 8.6.22, 8.7.1/  Controversy about name  Friedrich König claimed that Xenophon was confused about Cyaxares because this was the name of the father of Astyages. However, it was not unusual, especially among kings, for an individual to have the same name as his grandfather. This was the case with both Cyrus the GreatHerodotus 1.111; Cyrus Cylinder (Pritchard, p. 316). and Cambyses II.Herodotus 1.111; Cyropaedia 1.2.1, 8.7.11; Cyrus Cylinder (Pritchard, p. 316). Darius (I) Hystaspes had a grandson named Darius who was heir apparent but was killed before he could become king.  Debate about existence of Cyaxares II  Cyaxares II figures prominently in Xenophon’s Cyropaedia. In contrast, he is absent from the Histories of Herodotus, which leaves no place for Cyaxares II. Herodotus says the Median king Astyages had no son, and that his successor as king of both Media and Persia was Cyrus the Great. The modern consensus of historians agrees with Herodotus. John Whitcomb wrote that Xenophon's Cyaxares II \\"was a mere figment of the imagination.\\" From at least the time of JeromeGleason L. Archer, Jr., ed. and trans., Jerome’s Commentary on Daniel (Grand Rapids: Baker, 1958), p. 55. until the 19th century, many writers, both Jewish and Christian, accepted the existence of Cyaxares II. He was regarded as the king of Media at the end of the Neo-Babylonian Empire in the biblical commentaries of John Calvin, Adam Clarke, Keil and Delitzsch, and Lange. In Lange's commentary, Otto Zöckler named Gesenius, Hengestenberg, and other more recent writers who equated Cyaxares II with Daniel's Darius the Mede.Otto Zöckler, “The Book of the Prophet Daniel” in John Peter Lange, Commentary on the Holy Scriptures: Critical, Doctrinal, and Ethical, tr. Philip Schaff (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1960) Vol. 7, p. 36. These commentaries noted similarities between Cyaxares II as portrayed by Xenophon and what may be inferred about Darius the Mede from the sparse statements about him in the Book of Daniel. In their view, the difference in name could be explained by the fact that kings at that time--including Artaxerxes I, Darius II, Artaxerxes III, Darius III--had a throne name in addition to their personal name. In the case of Cyaxares II, Harpocration and Berossus were cited as evidence showing that the throne name of Cyaxares II was Darius.Johann F. K. Keil, in Keil and Delitzsch Old Testament Commentaries (Grand Rapids: Associated Publishers and Authors, n.d.), Vol. 6, p. 542.Zöckler in Lange’s Commentary, p. 36. Regarding correlations between Cyaxares and Darius the Mede, Zöckler wrote, \\"the account given by Xenophon regarding Cyaxares so fully agrees with the narrative of Daniel regarding Darius the Mede, that, as Hitzig confesses, 'the identity of the two is beyond a doubt.'\\"Keil in Keil and Delitzsch, p. 542.  Supporting evidence  The following sources generally support, in one way or another, the existence of Cyaxares II as a monarch who succeeded Astyages on the throne of Media, and who continued until sometime shortly after the capture of Babylon by the combined Median and Persian armies and their allies. The sources are listed in chronological order of their composition, with the oldest first. The Harran Stele The Harran Stele (Pritchard, pp. 362–63) was composed in the fourteenth or fifteenth year of Nabonidus, i.e. 542 to 540 BC, commemorating his restoration of the temple at Ehulhul. Nabonidus relates how, in the tenth year of his reign (546/5 BC), hostile kings invited him to return to Babylon. The kings are named as \\"the kings of the land of Egypt, of the land [v.l. for KUR: URU, of the city] of the Medes, of the land of the Arabs, and all the kings of hostile (lands)\\". The significance of this lies in its date, just one to three years before Nabonidus lost his kingdom to the Medes and Persians.Beaulieu, Reign of Nabonidus p. 143. The fall of Babylon to the Medes and Persians is universally accepted as occurring in 539 BC, three years or less after Beaulieu’s date for the Harran Stele. It was also some 13 or 14 years after Cyrus had supposedly subjugated the Medes and became ruler of the combined empire in 559 B.C. according to Herodotus and the consensus of modern historians who follow him. Nabonidus makes no mention of the Persians who soon would be the leaders of those who captured his capital. This is consistent with Xenophon’s picture of the Persians still being the subordinate partner in the Medo-Persian confederacy at the time, with Cyrus the junior sovereign under his uncle, Cyaxares II king of Media.Cyropaedia 3.3.24–25, 4.1.19–21, 8.5.17–19, esp. 19. Nowhere in any surviving inscription is Cyrus called the king of Media, unless it is maintained that the present inscription is interpreted that way;It would be circular reasoning to say that the Harran Stele shows that Cyrus is called the King of the Medes because the Medes are listed on the Harran Stele as the enemy of the Babylonians. this would be in contradiction to other sources where Cyrus is referred to \\"king of Anshan\\", \\"king of Persia\\", \\"the great king\\" and other similar titles. The Harran Stele therefore is evidence that just shortly before the fall of Babylon the king of the Medes, whose name is not given, not only existed, but was considered a more important enemy of the Babylonians than Cyrus and the Persians.In the Harran Stele (Pritchard, 562b), Nabonidus lists his principal enemies of the Babylonians as the Egyptians, Medes, and Arabs; the Persians are not mentioned. The Persepolis Reliefs Frieze statues depicting Persian and Median nobleman in friendly conversation. Construction of the Persian city of Persepolis began early in the reign of Darius I (522-486 BC), probably about 515 BC, and construction was completed in the reign of his son Xerxes (486-465 BC). The great staircase of the Apadana was part of the first building phase. Reliefs on part of the staircase depict Persian and Median nobles, with no apparent distinction of rank.Yamauchi, Persia and the Bible, \\"The northern part of the eastern staircase depicts alternating Persian and Median nobles conversing with each other.\\" p. 347. Depiction of Persians and Medians as equals is not consistent with Herodotus' account that the Persians \\"subjugated\\" and made \\"slaves\\" of the Medes about 20 years before the fall of Babylon (Histories 1.129,130). They are consistent with the picture presented in the Cyropaedia of a confederation between the two nations, with the Medes initially being the senior partners in the confederacy. Aeschylus in The Persians Aeschylus' tragedy The Persians was written in 472 BC. He was a contemporary of Darius Hystaspes (522-486 BC) and his son Xerxes (486-465). He fought the Persians at Marathon and Salamis. His play The Persians predates both Xenophon and Herodotus, and is therefore independent of either of those sources. The play is a dramatic reenactment of the Persian defeat at Salamis (486 BC). In it, the ghost of Darius I describes the two Median kings who preceded Cyrus as rulers of the Medo-Persian alliance: > For the Mede was the first leader of [our] host; > And another, his son, completed this work, > For [his] mind directed his passion. > And third from him was Cyrus, a fortunate man; > When he ruled, he established peace for all his own. In Herodotus' history, the two Median kings who preceded Cyrus were Cyaxares I and his son Astyages. But also according to Herodotus, Cyaxares I did not establish a Medo-Persian confederacy, and Astyages did not \\"complete this work\\"; instead he lost his throne after initiating a war against Cyrus. The conflict of Aeschylus with Herodotus regarding the basic history of the Medes and Persians is so obvious that Walther Kranz stated, \\"Certainly one could complain, that thus Aeschylus (like his hearers) knew nothing about the enormous revolution in the East regarding the changeover of the dominion to the Persians.\\" Steven Anderson writes, \\"The attempt to reconcile Aeschylus with Herodotus thus breaks down, not only because of the problem of correlating the Median kings, but also because of the problem of a Medo- Persian confederacy. Aeschylus presents the Medes and Persians as a united host right from the first Median king in the list, and does not indicate that there was a violent conquest of Media by Cyrus, as Herodotus claims there was.\\" In the past, the interpretation taken by many classicists was that the two Median kings preceding Cyrus in this reference were Astyages and Xenophon's Cyaxares II. This was the position of Thomas Stanley, who edited what became the standard edition of the works of Aeschylus from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries. That the Medes under Astyages began a confederacy with the Persians, as indicated by Aeschylus, is evidenced by Astyages giving his daughter Mandane in marriage to Cambyses, the father of Cyrus by Mandane. This marriage alliance is attested in the histories of both Herodotus and Xenophon. \\"In the ancient Near Eastern context, such marriages signified the formation of political alliances, and it seems that Astyages made just such an alliance with Persia with a view toward checking Babylonian hegemony. The work which he began of opposing Babylonian hegemony through the confederation with Persia was completed by his son Darius/Cyaxares II, who occupied the Median throne when Babylon fell to the Medo-Persian army.\\"Anderson Darius the Mede: A Reappraisal, p. 117. Aeschylus in these few lines presents a picture of the early days of the Medo-Persian confederacy that is in harmony with Xenophon's succession of Median kings, including Cyaxares II. Xenophon in the Cyropaedia Xenophon was a mercenary soldier who fought in the Persian civil war between Cyrus the Younger and his brother Artaxerxes II of Persia. The story of the 10,000 Greek mercenaries is related in Xenophon’s most famous work, the Anabasis. Xenophon fought on the side of Cyrus and greatly admired him. After Cyrus was slain, Xenophon became leader of the Greeks in their long trek out of the territory controlled by the Persians. Since he apparently was quite familiar with the younger Cyrus and his attendants, he had ample opportunity to learn the court remembrances of Cyrus the Great. When Xenophon wrote his Cyropaedia (the Education of Cyrus) several years later, the Histories of Herodotus had already been published. Regarding the upbringing of Cyrus the Great, Herodotus said that he was choosing one of the stories he had heard, but that there were three other stories he did not choose to relate (1.95). The story he chose is adapted from myths that were current at the time. An integral part of Herodotus' story was his explanation of how Cyrus came to the throne of Persia. This was after he led a successful rebellion against his maternal grandfather Astyages, king of the Medes. Xenophon would have known this story from Herodotus, but he did not believe it, because his history of Cyrus' early years is quite different. Herodotus and Xenophon agree that Cyrus' mother was Mandane of Media, daughter of Astyages, but Herodotus says that Cyrus' father, Cambyses I, was not of \\"suitable rank\\" to be a king or the father of a king (1.07); however, Xenophon says that Cambyses was king of Persia. In contrast to Herodotus' having Cyrus lead a rebellion against his grandfather and seizing the throne of Media, Xenophon says Astyages died and was succeeded on the throne of Media by his son Cyaxares (II) some time before Cyrus--as prince regent of Persia and leader of their armies--began his campaign of conquest. The discovery of the Cyrus Cylinder gave evidence that Herodotus was wrong regarding the ancestors of Cyrus and especially the rank of his father, Cambyses. Therein, Cyrus states that he is \\"son of Cambyses, great king, king of Anshan, grandson of Cyrus, great king, king of Anshan, descendant of Teispes, great king, king of Anshan, of a family (which) always (exercised) kingship\\" (Pritchard, p. 316). Berossus Berossus was a Babylonian writer who produced a history of Babylon, the Babyloniaca, about 270 BC. The work was widely known in antiquity, but now survives only in fragments quoted by later writers. A fragment describing the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus is preserved in Josephus' Against Apion (1.150-53/1.20). In it, Berossus dates the conquest to the seventeenth year of Nabonidus, in agreement with the cuneiform inscription of the Nabonidus Chronicle. This section of the Babyloniaca is also cited in the Chronicle of Eusebius, a work that survives only in an Armenian translation. Eusebius cites Abydenus, an epitomizer of Berossus, as his source. The fragment of Berossus preserved in Against Apion states that Cyrus gave Nabonidus the province of Carmania to live in. The Chronicle of Eusebius agrees with this, but its citation of Abydenus/Berossus adds: \\"To this one [Nabonidus] Cyrus gave, when he had taken Babylon, the governorship of the land of the Carmanians; [but] Darius the king took away some of the province for himself.\\"Josef Karst, ed., Die Chronik aus dem Armenischen übersetzt mit textkritischem Commentar. Vol 5 of Eusebius Werke. Die griechischen christlichen Schriftseller der ersten drei Jahrhunderte, vol. 20 (Leipzig: J. C. Hinrichs, 1911) p. 246. Berossus' statement mentions a king named Darius contemporary with Nabonidus. This might support a King Darius ruling at the time Cyrus conquered Babylon but it might also refer to Darius the Great (reigned 522-486), who might have reduced Nabonidus's province later on. This reference to the name Darius was used in the 19th century commentaries of Keil and Delitzsch and Lange to assert that \\"Darius the Mede\\" in the Book of Daniel was attested in an ancient source. Harpocration Harpocration was a lexicographer who wrote in the latter half of the 2nd century AD. He was associated with the great library at Alexandria, and had access to many ancient resources that were lost when the library was destroyed. His only surviving work is The Lexicon of the Ten Orators. In an entry for the daric coin, he writes, \\"But darics are not named, as most suppose, after Darius the father of Xerxes, but for a certain other more ancient king.\\" In the 19th century, C. F. Keil, in the Keil and Delitzsch commentary on the Hebrew Bible, cited the reference in Harpocration as evidence outside of the biblical Book of Daniel for the existence of Daniel's \\"Darius the Mede\\" as a historical figure.Keil in Keil and Delitzsch, p. 548, note 1. Keil devotes about seven pages to a discussion of Xenophon’s importance for verifying the account of Daniel. His references to Harpocration and Berossus as naming a Darius earlier than Darius Hystpases were taken over by Zöckler in Lange’s Commentary. Both of these commentaries are in print today.  Conflicting evidence =Babylonian contract texts There are thousands of examples of Babylonian contract documents written in cuneiform on clay, many of which are unpublished. Strassmaier published 384 contract texts dated to the reign of Cyrus,J. N. Strassmeier, ed., Inschriften von Cyrus, König von Babylon (538-529 v. Chr.), Babylonische Texte, vol. 7 (Leipzig: Eduard Pfeiffer, 1890). and others have been published since then. These documents provide the strongest argument against the existence of Cyaxares II, since none of those yet published contains that name. Rowley writes, \\"No imperial monarch interposed his rule between Nabonidus and Cyrus, for ere the month in which Cyrus entered Babylon had run its course, contracts were being dated by his reign.\\" According to the Cyropaedia (8.5.1,17), it was only after affairs were settled in Babylon that Cyrus went to Media and invited Cyaxares to come to Babylon, where he had prepared a palace for him. If that is the case, then the people of Babylon would have recognized Cyrus as their conqueror, not the distant Cyaxares. Steven Anderson, who advocates the basic outline of Xenophon, writes that Cyrus \\"was evidently hailed as the new king when he entered the city in a carefully choreographed procession, and his entrance was preceded and followed by a heavy propaganda campaign.\\"Anderson, Darius the Mede: A Reappraisal, p. 100. Anderson also states, \\"It is not impossible that there may be cuneiform texts which mention Darius the Mede that have been mistakenly identified by modern scholars with one of the three Persian kings called 'Darius.' Any reference to Darius the Mede would have to be very explicit and otherwise unexplainable to be recognized as such by a conventional scholar.\\"Anderson, Darius the Mede: A Reappraisal, p. 98, n. 118. The Cyrus Cylinder The Cyrus Cylinder (Pritchard, pp. 315–16) is a barrel-shaped clay cylinder inscribed in Akkadian cuneiform. It appears to have been written sometime after the conquest of Babylon (539 BC) and before Cyrus' death in 530 BC. The Cyrus Cylinder was an important part of the evidence in conflict with Xenophon's account. Its text was interpreted as implying that the Persians conquered the Medes in warfare before the capture of Babylon, as narrated by Herodotus. It makes no mention of any Median king reigning when Babylon fell, which was taken as evidence against the existence of Cyaxares II as described by Xenophon. The Cyrus Cylinder (British Museum) Modern scholarship recognizes the cylinder as a propaganda piece designed to manipulate public opinion against the Babylonian king Nabonidus and to legitimatize Cyrus' conquest of Babylon.Beaulieu, Reign of Nabonidus p. 143.Pierre Briant, From Cyrus to Alexander: A History of the Persian Empire, trans. Peter T. Daniels (Winona Lake IN: Eisenbrauns, 2002), pp. 41-43).A. Kuhrt, \\"The Cyrus Cylinder and Achaeminid Imperial Policy\\" in Journal for the Study of the Old Testament 25 (1983) pp. 83-94. It describes Cyrus as a liberator of the Babylonian people who restored the worship of Marduk after the neglect of such worship by Nabonidus, who is vilified throughout. The Cyrus Cylinder states that Cyrus \\"made the land of Gutium and all the Umman- Manda bow in submission at his feet.\\" Umman-Manda is taken by some authorities as a reference to Cyrus' subjugation of the Medes. However, according to Steven Anderson, this may be the means by which Cyrus gained the allegiance of the Median army after the successful campaign against the Lydians and their allies, upstaging Cyaxares II while still pledging allegiance to him. Regarding the \\"submission\\" of the Gutians and Umman-Manda, Anderson writes, \\"In order to justify these false propaganda claims, as well as to provide another opportunity for Cyrus to glorify himself, it became necessary to portray Cyrus as having actually conquered the Medes, rather than gradually appropriating control over the confederated Medo-Persian army, and finally succeeding the last Median king. ... If Cyrus was given lordship over the Median army before the fall of Babylon, this would fit with either Herodotus or Xenophon.\\"Anderson, Darius the Mede: A Reappraisal, pp. 69-70. According to Xenophon's Cyropaedia (4.6.1-11), Gobryas, governor of Gutium under the suzerainty of the Babylonians, had a long-standing grudge against the Babylonian king. After Cyrus defeated Croesus, Gobryas came to Cyrus and indicated his allegiance. Gobryas figures prominently in events that follow, giving his advice about how to proceed in the capture of Babylon, and then leading the forces that took the city (5.4.41-50; 7.5.8-33). Although the basic outline of this account might be called into question because of Xenophon's desire to portray Cyrus as a master of tact and diplomacy, there is simply no other account that has survived explaining how the Gutians became followers of Cyrus and were in submission to him, as stated in the Cyrus Cylinder. Xenophon has support from the Nabonidus Chronicle, where Gobryas (Ugbaru), in agreement with the Cyropaedia, is called the governor of Gutium and the leader of the army of Cyrus in the capture of Babylon. Steven Hirsch concludes, \\"So Xenophon is right to claim that Cyrus enlisted the support of one Gobryas, a Babylonian vassal who was instrumental in the capture of Bablon. This detail is absent from Herodotus' account and from the extant portions of Ctesias' Persica.\\" The Nabonidus Chronicle The Nabonidus Chronicle is an ancient Babylonian text, part of a larger series of Babylonian Chronicles inscribed in cuneiform script on clay tablets. Amélie Kuhrt describes the Nabonidus Chronicle as \\"the most reliable and sober [ancient] account of the fall of Babylon.\\"Kuhrt, Amélie. \\"Babylonia from Cyrus to Xerxes\\", in The Cambridge Ancient History: Persia, Greece, and the Western Mediterranean, C. 525-479 B.C, pp. 112-138. Cambridge University Press, 1988. However, the Chronicle has also been described as \\"a piece of propaganda at Cyrus's service\\".Wiesehöfer, Josef (trans. Azodi, Azizeh). Ancient Persia: From 550 BC to 650 AD, p. 49. I.B.Tauris, 2001. Its annalistic nature suggests that original documents from the reign of Nabonidus were the starting point of its texts, but these have been heavily edited to shed unfavorable light on Nabonidus as one who repeatedly neglected the new year festival in Babylon. The Nabonidus Chronicle In regard to the historicity Cyaxares II, the Chronicle agrees with Herodotus that the army of Ishtumegu of Agamantu (considered to be Astyages of Ectabana) revolted against him, whereupon \\"Cyrus, king of Anshan\\" conquered and pillaged Agamantu/Ectabana. This has been taken as supporting Herodotus with regard to the succession of kings in which Cyrus the Great immediately followed Astyages as king of both Media and Persia, with no intervening Cyaxares II. Although the agreement between the Nabonidus Chronicle and Herodotus, that Cyrus conquered Astyages and put an end to the Median kingdom, has seemed conclusive to most modern scholars, there remain some difficulties. One of these is the consideration that Herodotus and the Nabonidus Chronicle may not be independent witnesses. Herodotus said he had four versions of the upbringing of Cyrus and how he came to be king available to him, and he chose to present only one of them (Histories 1.95). The account he chose is apparently the official view of the Persians; in other words, the agreement of Herodotus with the Nabonidus Chronicle in this matter should not be regarded as two independent testimonies. The Nabonidus Chronicle supports Xenophon in relating that it was Ugbaru/Gobryas, governor of Gutium, who was general of the armies that conquered Babylon. In a section that is partially defective, the Nabonidus Chronicle reports the death of the \\"wife of the king\\". This happened at some time before the end of the month in which the forces of Cyrus captured Babylon. If the king was Cyrus, as seems most probable, then the one who died was his first wife, Cassandane, mother of Cambyses II. Cambyses II was old enough to be prince regent when his father entered Babylon. If Cassandane had died at this time, it would shed light on the passage in the Cyropaedia (8.5.19) where Cyaxares II, maternal uncle of Cyrus, gave his daughter as bride to the recently bereaved Cyrus, with the kingdom of Media as her dowry. The death of the king's wife in the Nabonidus Chronicle would then explain why Cyrus would take a new queen in his middle years, as stated in the Cyropaedia. Most historians do not make any connection between the death of the king's wife in the Nabonidus Chronicle and Cyrus's taking a new wife shortly thereafter (Cyropaedia) because to do so would lend credence to the existence of Cyaxares II. One writer who makes the connection is William Shea. Herodotus The Histories of Herodotus was written sometime between 450 and 420 BC. Herodotus has no room for Cyaxares II in the Histories, because his narrative has Cyrus leading a successful rebellion against his maternal grandfather, Astyages king of the Medes. As a consequence, the Medes became \\"slaves\\" of the Persians (1.129,130). Herodotus states that Astyages had no male heir (1.109); this may be compared to Xenophon's statement (Cyropaedia 8.5.19) that it was Cyaxares (II), son of Astyages, who had no male heir. The lack of a male heir is an essential part of the story of Herodotus regarding the birth and upbringing of Cyrus, an account that is universally recognized as an adaptation of widespread myths about rejected sons becoming king. The animosity between Cyrus and Astyages that led to Cyrus' rebellion is an integral part of that myth. The rebellion is generally accepted as true by modern historians, as it is supported by other texts such as the Nabonidus Chronicle.

It was replaced in the DJIA by Liggett & Myers on July 18, 1930. In 1965, General Signal Corporation (GSX) was created with the intent to diversify into areas other than railway signaling. GRS was a wholly owned subsidiary of GSX. In 1960, GRS opened the \\"General Railway Signal Company de Argentina\\" (GRSA) division in Buenos Aires, which provided manufacture, installation and technical support of GRS railroad signalling systems in Argentina. Some local railroad lines that were provided with GRSA products were Belgrano Norte, Belgrano Sur, Urquiza and Sarmiento. Most of the signals remain active. Among their products are railroad crossing signalling parts, branded with the GRSA logo, instead of the usual GRS. This facility was closed in the early 1980s. In 1986, GRS joined with China National Railway Signal & Communication Group Corporation (CRSC) to form the Chinese-American Signal Company (CASCO) in Shanghai, China, which produces products and systems for railways in the People's Republic of China.CASCO Signal Ltd In 1989, GRS was acquired by the Italian company Sasib and joined the Sasib Railways group. From its founding until 1993, GRS main office and manufacturing facilities were located at 801 West Avenue in Rochester. In 1993, it moved to two new suburban facilities: administration and engineering to Sawgrass Drive in Brighton, and manufacturing to John Street in West Henrietta.

Additionally, he is assistant director of the Center for Texas Music History and assistant director and co-editor of the Journal of Texas Music History. Andrews is also an accomplished folk musician, performing and recording under the pseudonym \\"Doctor G\\" alongside his band, The Mudcats. Early life Andrews was born in Ilasco, Missouri, to Maurice and Virginia Andrews (now Virginia Sudholt) in 1950. He grew up in Monkey Run, an unincorporated neighborhood of Ilasco literally \\"on the wrong side of the tracks\\" (the two towns were separated by railroad tracks). A largely immigrant community, Ilasco was a suburb of Hannibal, Missouri, and was also the location of the cave made famous in Mark Twain's classic novel, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Ilasco (which ceased to exist in the 1960s) had a population of about 3,000 in 1900, but economic changes had greatly decreased the town's size by mid-century. Andrews' father and grandfather both worked at the Atlas Portland Cement Co. (now Continental Cement) plant. The economic hardships of the town, along with the rhythm of life near a cement factory, deeply influenced Andrews. At the age of 14, Andrews' father taught him to play the guitar and sing. For eight months, Andrews also took guitar lessons from Maceo Wilson, a local musician famous in Hannibal. Andrews' father died in 1965. Academic career Andrews obtained a Ph.D. in 1988 from Northern Illinois University. From 1985 to 1987, Andrews received an Andrew Mellon Predoctoral Teaching Fellowship in the Humanities from the Illinois Institute of Technology. In 1988, Andrews won appointment as an assistant professor at Texas State. He rose to the rank of full professor, and now is also assistant director of the Center for Texas Music History and assistant director and co- editor of the Journal of Texas Music History. Andrews is married to Victoria Bynum, who is also a professor of history at Texas State. Research focus Andrews' research work has been varied, but more recently has focused on the social history of work and labor. Andrews' first book, Shoulder to Shoulder? The American Federation of Labor, the United States, and the Mexican Revolution, 1910–1924, published in 1991, was an important re-assessment of the role Samuel Gompers and the American Federation of Labor played in shaping American policy toward revolutionary movements in Latin America. From 1910 to 1924, Andrews found, Gompers and other labor leaders supported Mexican workers in their struggle for social justice, but advocated Mexican economic dependence on the United States. The book was called \\"an important key to understanding the ongoing relationship between the labor movement and actions of the United States in Central America\\"Levenstein, \\"Review: Shoulder to Shoulder?..., by Gregg Andrews,\\" American Historical Review, December 1992. and \\"a skillful blend of labor and diplomatic history.\\"McFarland, \\"Book Reviews: Shoulder to Shoulder?...,\\" Labor Studies Journal, September 1993. The book won the Phi Alpha Theta Best Book Award for the first book by a new author. Andrews used his personal history as a jumping-off point for his next book, Insane Sisters: Or, the Price Paid for Challenging a Company Town, published in 1999. The book illustrated the battle Mary Heinbach and her sister, Euphemia Koller, waged against the Atlas Portland Cement Company in Ilasco. The dispute over property rights spanned 17 years and landed in the Supreme Court of Missouri four times. The dispute ended when Mary was declared incompetent in 1921 and Euphemia pronounced insane in 1929. The company subsequently was able to acquire clear title to their property. The main thrust of the book is an analysis of the changing role of women at the beginning of the 20th century, the development of mental health law, and the collusion of business and governmental interest during the Progressive Era.Dwyer, \\"Book Review: Gregg Andrews, Insane Sisters, or, The Price Paid for Challenging a Company Town,\\" American Historical Review, December 2001. Andrews' most recent work, City of Dust: A Cement Company Town in the Land of Tom Sawyer (2002), is his most noted. City of Dust made a significant contribution to the social and industrial history of the trans-Mississippi West. :Andrews' pioneering social history focuses needed attention on a group of workers and an industry that labor historians and others have previously neglected. The author's description of the work process involved in cement manufacture, and the terrible toll on the workers of the industry’s accidents and diseases, alone provide little-known, valuable information.Beik, \\"Review of Gregg Andrews, City of Dust...,\\" H-Labor, H-Net Reviews, May, 1997. City of Dust is primarily a social history of cement workers, but it also sheds light on issues of class, industrialism, immigration, labor, and the working-class. Andrews has continued to mine his personal past to investigate history. His current research projects include a study of the Texas labor movement during the Great Depression, research into the role played by African Americans in the Galveston longshoremen's strike of 1920, and the struggle of black trade unionists to overcome the racially discriminatory practices of the Texas State Federation of Labor. Music career Under the name \\"Doctor G,\\" Andrews is also an accomplished and published singer, songwriter and musician. He is a regular performer at the Cheatham Street Warehouse, a San Marcos music venue where country-western singer George Strait first found fame. Andrews' music is a mixture of folk, Southern rock and blues, and his lyrics speak of forbidden love, the need for respect, the search for happiness, and the toll poverty and hard work have on people. In many respects, Andrews' music reflects his scholarly concerns with the poor, social justice, the working class and the struggle for dignity and respect in the face of economic hardship. Andrews' band, \\"Doctor G and the Mudcats,\\" released their debut CD, Mudcat, in September 2005. The record was released on Cheatham Street Records, the independent record label founded by Cheatham Street Warehouse owner Kent Finlay. Memberships and honors=Honors Andrews was assistant director of the NEH Summer Environmental History Institute at Texas State in 1991, and in 2001 received a National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship. In 1998, Andrews received the Excellence in Teaching Award from the College of Liberal Arts at Texas State. Four years later, he received a Texas State University Faculty Award for Scholarly and Creative Activity. In 2002, Andrews was named a Mary M. Hughes Fellow for the Texas State Historical Association. Memberships Andrews has served as a manuscript reviewer at Texas A&M; University Press, the University of Missouri Press, and the University of Illinois Press. He has also served as an editor for the journals Diplomatic History, the Journal of Iberian and Latin American Studies, and the International Review of Social History. Andrews is currently a member of the board of directors of the Texas Heritage Songwriters Association. He is also a member of the Texas State Historical Association, Southwest Labor Studies Association, Organization of American Historians, and Southern Historical Association. From 2000 to 2002, Andrews was Southwest Chapter president of the Texas Faculty Association. Writing awards Andrews has also won a number of writing awards. In 1993, his book Shoulder to Shoulder? won the Phi Alpha Theta Best Book Award for the first book by a new author. The same year, he was co-recipient of the Harvey L. Johnson Award for the best article in Latin American history. The award, given by Southwest Council of Latin American Studies, honored him for the article \\"Robert Haberman, Socialist Ideology, and the Politics of National Reconstruction in Mexico, 1920-25,\\" which appeared in the journal Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos. He has twice won the James Neal Primm Award, a prize give by the Missouri Historical Society for the best article in its journal, Gateway Heritage. Andrews was first honored in 1995 for his article \\"From Robber Caves to Robber Barons: New South Missouri and the Social Construction of Mark Twain, 1910-1935.\\" He won again the next year, for his article \\"Ilasco Cement Workers and the War on Booze in Ralls County, Missouri, 1903-1914.\\" Publications=Solely authored books * City of Dust: A Cement Company Town in the Land of Tom Sawyer.

It originally aired in April 1996 and has since been recognised as one of the most popular episodes of the show.Father Ted - Articles - All 4TV News  15 of our favourite 'Father Ted' episodes - entertainment.ie The episode is based on Ireland's winning streak at the Eurovision Song Contest during the 1990s. The plot centres around Ted and Dougal trying to write a song for it (though the episode does not refer to that name directly) in order to settle a rivalry with Dick Byrne. The pair unsuccessfully write their own tune, before deciding to steal a former entry they believe nobody remembers. This backfires and they have to play the original tuneless song, but controversially win the contest anyway. The music was composed by Neil Hannon and was performed by Hannon and Darren Allison from The Divine Comedy. Synopsis The episode begins when Dougal has \\"Eurosong fever\\", weeks ahead of the competition. After initially rejecting Dougal's suggestion that they write a song to represent Ireland in the competition on the grounds that they are not skilled in songwriting, Ted discovers his nemesis Dick Byrne does have plans to enter a song. Ted decides that if Dick Byrne can write a song, he and Dougal can write a better one. After working all night, they come up with \\"My Lovely Horse\\", a tuneless dirge with ridiculous lyrics lasting less than a minute. After trying the song out on Mrs Doyle and Father Jack, Jack is so infuriated he shoots Ted's guitar. Disillusioned, they are about to give up when Ted discovers the lyrics fit a tune by \\"Nin Huguen and the Huguenotes\\", an obscure B-side for an entry from the fifth-placed act in Norway's Eurosong preselection from 1976. Ted thinks that because the whole band died in a plane crash, including all the record company staff and everyone involved in the copyright, they will get away with stealing it. At the Dublin theatre where \\"A Song for Ireland\\" is being hosted, Ted has some trouble talking to the show's producer Charles Hedges (who is deciding the winning entry) as he finds he is gay. Ted and Dougal listen to Dick Byrne's entry, \\"The Miracle Is Mine\\". It is extremely impressive, with a full choir, huge band and a passionate performance from Byrne. Ted is worried and goes backstage for a smoke, where he hears the Norwegian tune first being whistled by a maintenance worker, then playing in a lift. He is horrified, realising that the song is more well-known than he thought, and he and Dougal are forced to adopt \\"Plan B\\": singing the dreadful original version. In the original version, Ted even says near the end when changing chord for the only time during the song, \\"Hang on, I can do this bit\\", while Dougal uses what looks like an old Casio keyboard. However, despite their poor performance, and against the obvious wishes of the audience, Hedges selects \\"My Lovely Horse\\" as Ireland's entry, nervously laughing off Byrne's suggestion that he wants to guarantee Ireland lose the main competition, with it being too expensive to host the competition every year, Ireland having won the last five Eurosongs. (Ireland won the real Eurovision Song Contest in 1992, 1993 and 1994, and so had the costly obligation of hosting it in 1993, 1994 and 1995.) The episode closes at the Eurosong contest, with Ted, Dougal, Jack and Mrs. Doyle listening to every country awarding them \\"nul points\\". Production Jack does not have a single line in this episode, though he does have a memorable moment when he reacts to the initial performance of \\"My Lovely Horse\\" by blasting Ted's guitar to pieces with a sawn-off shotgun. Steve Coogan was intended to play compère Fred Rickwood, but could not make it, so Irish comic Jon Kenny stepped in. Kenny had appeared in Father Ted previously, as Michael the cinema owner in \\"The Passion of St Tibulus\\". The music in the episode is written and, in the case of \\"Nin Huguen and the Huguen Notes\\", performed by Neil Hannon who also wrote and recorded the title music. The band name is a clumsy pun on \\"Huguenots\\". Declan Lowney, who directed most Father Ted episodes, was also director of the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest. The actual name of the Eurovision Song Contest is not mentioned at any point in the episode. The reference is always to the \\"Eurosong Competition\\". Cultural references The scene in which Ted loses his temper at Dougal's failure to play the correct note is a reference to \\"The Troggs Tapes\\", a notorious out- take from a recording session by The Troggs. In the Father Ted script book, Graham Linehan notes that he initially wanted the scene to run longer, but that it was ultimately cut down to just long enough for people familiar with the out-take to get the reference. Ted mentions Icy-Tea and Scoopy Scoopy Dog Dog meaning Ice-T and Snoop Doggy Dogg. The tragic story of Nin Huguen and the Huguenotes' deaths in a plane crash could be a reference to similar events with past musician artists such as the \\"Day the Music Died\\" (deaths of The Big Bopper, Buddy Holly, and Ritchie Valens) and the loss of multiple members of Lynyrd Skynyrd in the 1977 Convair CV-240 crash. Ted mentions that there was a priest named Father Benny Cake who scored a Number 1 hit single in England – after changing his name so nobody would know he was a priest – with a song titled \\"Vienna\\". This joke references Midge Ure of Ultravox, although in reality \\"Vienna\\" was famously kept off the British Number 1 spot by Joe Dolce's Shaddap You Face, and Midge Ure has no connection to the priesthood. The song did reach No.1 in Ireland, where the series is set. A Song for Ireland 1996 The entries for \\"Song for Ireland 1996\\" were: (only songs 1 & 2 are shown being performed; the names of 3 to 6 are seen on a sign) # \\"The Miracle is Mine\\" by Fr. Dick Byrne and Fr. Cyril McDuff # \\"My Lovely Horse\\" by Fr. Ted Crilly and Fr. Dougal McGuire (winner) # \\"If I Could Wear My Hat Like My Heart\\" by The Grand Girls # \\"You Dirty English Bastards\\" by The Hairy Bowsies # \\"The Drums of Africa Are Calling Me Home\\" by Sean O'Brien # \\"Sha la la la la la la la la la la la la\\" by Death Pigs The Hairy Bowsies are a real band featuring Paul Woodfull (aka Paul Wonderful), a comedian friend of Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews. Their songs are traditional Irish ballads, with republican lyrics. Inspiration It has been widely claimed that this episode was inspired by real events surrounding Ireland's selection of its entry for the 1994 Eurovision Song Contest. Faced with the daunting (and financially crippling) task of hosting its third consecutive Eurovision, RTÉ were said to have chosen an inferior quality song (Paul Harrington & Charlie McGettigan's \\"Rock 'n' Roll Kids\\") over vastly superior ones in order to prevent the possibility of an unwanted third victory.Worst Eurovision Winners Ever  The Eurovision Times In the event, \\"Rock 'n' Roll Kids\\" not only won the contest but also became the highest scoring song in Eurovision history up to that point. A month after this episode was first broadcast, Ireland won the 1996 Eurovision Song Contest to secure the country's fourth victory in five years. Coincidentally enough, the Norwegian broadcaster NRK branded the 1996 contest as \\"Eurosong 96\\" in its logo. \\"My Lovely Horse\\" The song was written by Graham Linehan, Arthur Mathews and Neil Hannon (of The Divine Comedy). According to the writer's commentary, the video for \\"My Lovely Horse\\" was based on a 1975 lifestyle video for \\"That's What Friends are For\\" by The Swarbriggs, which was Ireland's entry for the 1975 Eurovision Song Contest, which they consider the funniest music video of all time. Some of the shots are even copied down to every last detail. The song goes: > My lovely lovely lovely horse. My lovely horse (my lovely horse), Running > through the field (running through the field). Where are you going, With > your fetlocks blowing In the wind? I want to shower you with sugarlumps. And > ride you over fences. Polish your hooves every single day. And bring you to > the horse dentist. My lovely lovely lovely horse. My lovely horse (my lovely > horse), You’re a pony no more (you’re a pony no more). Running around, with > a man on your back, like a train in the night... Like a train in the night. > (saxophone solo) The song, which lasts 1:23, was produced by Darren Allison and Neil Hannon during sessions for The Divine Comedy's Casanova album. It was released on CD as a B-side to the band's 1999 single \\"Gin Soaked Boy\\". The climax of the clip features the sudden appearance of the horse's head to the cacophonous wail of a saxophone, surrounded by a typically 1970s-disco-style burst of multi- coloured lights. Dougal and Ted wake up in horror simultaneously, with Ted panting \\"We have to lose that sax solo!\\" The outdoor sequences were shot in the grounds of the Falls Hotel in Ennistymon, County Clare, Ireland. In the background the cascade waterfall in Ennistymon can clearly be seen. Legacy The episode is often regarded as one of the most popular, appearing on the Best Of video, with one of the most memorable moments being the video for \\"My Lovely Horse\\". In May 2014 a petition to make \\"My Lovely Horse\\" Ireland’s entry for Eurovision 2015 was formally submitted to the government, but was rejected by the Oireachtas petitions committee.Petition to make Father Ted's 'My Lovely Horse' Ireland's Eurovision song turned down  The Independent ReferencesExternal links  My Lovely Horse video clip by Channel 4 on YouTube Category:1996 British television episodes Category:Eurovision Song Contest 1996 Category:Father Ted episodes Category:Musical television episodes ","title":"A Song for Europe (Father Ted)"},{"id":"10108928","text":"The Avro 652 was a 1930s British light airliner, built by A.V. Roe and Company. It was a twin-engine, low-wing monoplane with a retractable undercarriage, and a tailwheel. Although only two were produced, it formed the basis for the successful Avro Anson. Design and development In 1933, Imperial Airways issued a specification to Avro, for a light airliner to transport four passengers for up to 420 mi (676 km) at a cruising speed of 130 mph (210 km/h). By August 1933, Roy Chadwick's team had produced a design study. This had to be revised when Imperial Airways changed the specification, to enable the machine to fly the Karachi-Bombay-Colombo night mail service. The amended design was accepted, and in April 1934 an order for two aircraft was issued. The first aircraft flew on 7 January 1935, and the type was certificated in March 1935.Mondey 1994 Operational history On 11 March 1935, the two Avro 652s were delivered to Imperial Airways at Croydon Airport. They served with Imperial Airways, mostly operating the route from Croydon to Brindisi. In 1938, they were sold to Air Service Training Ltd, a civilian company operating under Air Ministry contracts. They served with No.3 E&RFTS; (Elementary and Reserve Flying Training School) as navigational trainers, at Hamble airfield. In November 1939, both aircraft were transferred to No. 11 AONS (Air Observers' Navigation School), remaining at Hamble. In March 1941, they were impressed by the Air Ministry into RAF service with No. 1 School of Photography.

He graduated from Greenville High School in 1937. He then went to Charleston to receive his bachelor's degree at The Citadel in 1941. With the outbreak of World War II, Mann enlisted in the U.S. Army and served on active duty until 1946, when he became a reservist with the rank of colonel. After the war, Mann enrolled at the University of South Carolina School of Law where he was editor of the South Carolina Law Review and graduated magna cum laude in 1947 as a member of the Euphradian Society. He was admitted to the state bar the same year and established a private practice in Greenville. Political career In 1948, Mann was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives and he served for two terms until Governor James F.

Located on the border between County Westmeath and County Roscommon, the development of the Athlone owes much to the location of a strategic ford (river crossing point) on the Shannon. Foundation The ford at this point on the River Shannon has been in use since at least the Bronze Age, and the settlement (including an early Christian site) expanded around this river-crossing. The ford of Athlone was strategically important, as south of Athlone the River Shannon is impassable until Clonmacnoise (where the Esker Riada meets the Shannon), and north is Lough Ree. Bridge and defences mortars in front of the medieval donjon of Athlone Castle are believed to date to the Williamite wars, and were previously located outside the main entrance of Custume Barracks. By the 11th century, Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (King of Connacht) had built a wooden bridge at Athlone, approximately 100 metres south of the current bridge. This was defended by the earliest recorded fort on the site - built on the west bank of the river in 1129. On a number of occasions both the fort and bridge were subject to attacks, and towards the end of the 12th century the Anglo-Normans constructed a motte-and-bailey fortification here. This was superseded by a stone structure built in 1210 by Justiciar John de Gray. Becoming known as Athlone Castle, this 12-sided donjon dates from the 13th century. Other parts of the castle were largely destroyed during the Siege of Athlone and the external defences were subsequently rebuilt and enlarged. The currently visible battlements and cannon emplacements were installed to prevent a French fleet from sailing up the River Shannon and establishing a bridgehead in Lough Ree (likewise south of Athlone at Shannonbridge, near Clonmacnoise). The castle was later damaged by a lightning strike on the powder store. The castle was also home to a small garrison, and provided housing for several families until the 1980s. These quarters now house part of the castle museum. During the wars that took place in Ireland during the seventeenth century, Athlone held a strategic position, holding the main bridge over the Shannon into Connacht. In the Irish Confederate Wars 1641–1653, the town was held by Irish Confederate troops until it was taken late in 1650 by Charles Coote, who attacked the town from the west, having crossed into Connacht at Sligo. Forty years later, during the Williamite war in Ireland, the town was again of strategic importance, being one of the remaining Jacobite strongholds after they had retreated west following the Battle of the Boyne. At the first battle of Athlone in 1690, the Jacobite forces of Colonel Richard Grace repelled an attack by 10,000 men led by Commander Douglas. The following year the Siege of Athlone saw a further assault in which the troops of King William III eventually prevailed against the outnumbered defenders. The current bridge was built in the 19th century to replace the old bridge which was becoming dangerous to the increasing volume of traffic. Originally the bridge had a moveable section which was decommissioned in the mid 20th century. Also during the mid-19th century, the Board of Works built a weir wall south of Athlone to improve the navigation of the river. Other structures Irish soldiers marching across the bridge in Athlone for the handover of Custume Barracks, 1922. Custume Barracks The town's barracks occupies a large area of the west bank of the River Shannon. Athlone Barracks, named Victoria Barracks in 1837, was re-named Custume Barracks in 1922 by General Sean MacEoin, independence fighter and first GOC Western Command. It is named after a Sergeant Custume who, during the 1691 Siege of Athlone, led a dozen volunteers (of whom 2 survived) out under the Dutch guns to tear down a wooden bridge. The barracks was the headquarters of the Western Command of the Irish Defence Forces until a reorganisation in 2013. It remains the headquarters of several infantry, artillery and engineering regiments of the defence forces. The original entrance to the barracks was where the current Garda station is today. Remains of the abbey at Athlone Other fortifications Other fortifications in the area include the ruins of a battery just to the north of Athlone (in an area now a nature reserve) and a large artificial hill called \\"The Batteries\\" upon which council housing has been built. The Connaught side was defended by a fosse which no longer exists. The noted tenor John McCormack was born in here in 1884 at the Bawn. Oldest pub Known as Sean's Bar today, \\"Luain’s Inn\\", is considered by some to be Ireland's oldest pub. It was established on the West Bank of the River Shannon on Main Street sometime around the year 900. In 1970, during renovations, the walls of the bar were found to be made of wattle and wicker, dating back to the 10th century. Workhouse On the east side of town, off North Gate Street, is an intact example of a Famine-era workhouse. The building, renamed St Mary's Hall, now hosts several youth groups and includes a large meeting room. Within sight of the workhouse building is a historic abbey.

Albert and directed by John Sturges. The title character, Jake Wade (Robert Taylor) is a now reformed town marshal with a past that will soon catch up with him. Before he is able to marry and live peacefully with his bride-to-be, Peggy Carter (Patricia Owens), an old shadowy friend, Clint Hollister (Richard Widmark), escapes from jail. Jake is methodically stalked by his psychotic ex-partner, who makes it clear that he wants the cash from the gang's previous heist, which the now reformed Jake later buried. Taking Peggy along as leverage, Hollister forces Wade to lead them on a tedious voyage to recover the loot. Soon enough all goes to hell when the trio finds Indians who have taken refuge in the ghost town where the money is buried. The film was shot on location in California's High Sierra mountain range, Lone Pine and Death Valley. This movie was Robert Taylor's last A-picture as the top-billed lead. Plot Former Confederate soldier and highwayman-turned-marshal Jake Wade (Robert Taylor) breaks his former partner, Clint Hollister (Richard Widmark), out of jail in the small western town of Morganville. The men have not seen each other for over a year, since the bank robbery and murder that resulted in Jake's arrest. At that time, Clint rescued Jake and the men separated with an agreement to reunite later. Instead, Jake buried the $20,000 from the robbery in the desert and decided to go straight. Believing that he has now repaid Clint by freeing him from jail, Jake refuses to tell Clint where the money is buried and advises him to leave the territory. Disgruntled and disturbed by what he considers Jake's betrayal, Clint vows vengeance. Carefully covering his trail, Jake returns to Cold Stream, where he serves as marshal. That evening, Jake dines at the home of his fiancée Peggy (Patricia Owens), and asks if she would consider relocating after their upcoming marriage. Startled, Peggy asks for an explanation, but when Jake hesitates, then flatly refuses to explain, Peggy angrily sends him home. Returning to his office, Jake is confronted and knocked out by a stranger, Rennie (Henry Silva). Upon reviving, Jake discovers Clint and the rest of his old gang and army comrades, Ortero (Robert Middleton), Wexler (DeForest Kelley), Burke (Eddie Firestone) and newcomer, the hot-headed Rennie. When Jake expresses amazement that Clint was able to track him, Clint reveals that he set loose the horse Jake had brought for him and followed it to Cold Stream. Clint then demands that Jake take him to the buried money and when he refuses, Clint has Burke and Rennie bring in Peggy, whom they have abducted. Clint then announces that to assure Jake's compliance, Peggy will accompany them to the money. The next morning, on their way into the desert, Clint forces Jake to ride with his hands tied behind him, as Clint did when he was arrested. When the men set up camp that night, Clint tells Peggy about Jake's disloyalty. In a private moment later, Jake apologizes to Peggy for causing the dilemma and warns her that they may have only one opportunity to escape. The next day, after the bound Jake falls off his horse repeatedly, the gang protests and Clint reluctantly agrees to untie Jake's hands. Jake immediately snatches Wexler's pistol and grabbing Peggy, tumbles down a sand dune into a canyon with her. Although the couple take the long way out of the canyon, Clint guesses Jake's plan and recaptures them. That night, Clint goads Jake into telling Peggy about their past. Jake explains that they were part of a Southern guerrilla outfit during the war, conducting looting raids that Clint insisted they continue after the war. Jake admits that during a bank robbery, a teenage boy was caught in the crossfire, prompting him to go straight. Clint scoffs, then demands to know when they will reach the buried money, and Jake promises they will be there the next day. The following afternoon the group meet a cavalry patrol and the commanding officer advises them to turn back because of the danger of Comanche attacks. Using Jake's identity as a marshal, Clint invents a story for them being in the area and the lieutenant reluctantly allows them to proceed. The men are uneasy about riding into Indian territory and when Rennie shoots at coyotes, Wexler is outraged, certain that the shots will surely attract the Comanche. The group then arrives at a ghost town, where Jake reveals he has hidden the money here. Jake spots three Indian scouts, telling Clint of one. After killing the 1st, Jake informs Clint of 2 other scouts. Enraged, Clint declares that he must go after the others in order to stop them from revealing their location, telling Rennie that he can have Peggy if he doesn't return. The remaining gang along with Jake and Peggy take shelter in the deserted saloon, tying Jake to a chair. While the men take turns keeping guard, Jake pleads with Ortero to save Peggy and return her to Cold Stream. As night falls, several calls are heard outside and Jake tells the men they are surrounded by Indians who will attack soon. When the others dart outside, Ortero tells Jake that he was not responsible for the teenager's death at the bank, but Clint allowed him to believe it in hopes of binding Jake to him. As the Indian calls intensify, Rennie anxiously tells the men they should flee as it is apparent Clint has abandoned them. The men return to the saloon and are bickering about escaping, when Clint abruptly returns. As Burke hysterically announces that they must go, he is killed by an Indian lance. The building is quickly surrounded by Indians and a vicious fight breaks out. Clint runs outside to fight and soon after, Wexler and Rennie are killed by Indian arrows. When an Indian breaks in, Jake distracts him and Peggy kills him with a lance. Peggy then cuts Jake's ropes, and as Clint and Ortero fight off the last of the Indians, they attempt to escape, but are caught by Clint. After Ortero buries the others, Clint asks Jake to take him to the money, and Jake reveals it is in a saddlebag, buried three feet deep in the cemetery. Jake digs up the saddlebag, then surprises Clint by pulling out a pistol from it. Although Clint suspects the gun will not function after spending a year underground, he eventually surrenders his gun as does Ortero. Jake then asks Ortero to take Peggy away and he agrees, they two ride out of town despite her protests. After Ortero and Peggy depart, Jake gives Clint an opportunity to settle the score by tossing his gun several yards away. Frustrated, Clint dashes for the gun, while Jake hides among the dilapidated buildings, forcing Clint to search for him. After a tense game of \\"cat-and-mouse,\\" Jake and Clint confront each other in the street and Jake kills Clint. Hearing the gunshots, Peggy and Ortero return for Jake.

Brief history The station originally signed on as WOXR-LP in September 2004, switching to its current calls in January 2005. The WSWO calls were previously used in Wilmington, Ohio at 102.3 FM (formerly WKFI, now WKLN, the K-LOVE affiliate for Wilmington, south Dayton, Middletown and Hamilton). From 1968 to 1972, the WSWO calls were used by independent Channel 26 out of Springfield, Ohio (now WBDT, the Dayton affiliate of The CW). Oldies 97.3 WSWO-LP is a non-commercial radio station relying solely on donations from listeners and local businesses to cover expenses for daily operations and music royalties. Accordingly, all persons involved in the station's programming and maintenance are unpaid volunteers. The station's format consists of oldies music (1950s through 1970s), but also airs syndicated and locally produced programs devoted to different genres of oldies, including pre-rock and roll era music. The station also prominently features coverage of Wayne High School sports, and occasionally broadcasts locally produced radio dramas, including a dramatized version of A Christmas Carol, which features several members of the air staff in the cast and has been an annual holiday presentation since it first aired in 2011. Though non-commercial, the station broadcasts acknowledgments of local businesses who support the station, added to which community announcements are aired along with PAMS-style jingles for identification purposes. Facilities WSWO-LP operates with a power of 100 watts. Its original transmitter (then at 97.7) was located on Lisa Drive. The station later moved its studios and transmitter to the Huber Centre, a shopping center at the intersection of Brandt Pike (aka SR 201) and Chambersburg Road, with the station's transmitter located behind the building. Changes in frequency The station originally used translator W268AX at 101.5 MHz from Old Troy Pike (SR 202) in north Dayton with a power of 106 watts which provided a wider coverage area reaching downtown Dayton, Moraine, Troy, and the fringe areas in Piqua to the north and Miamisburg to the south. The transition from 101.5 to 101.1 took place on Monday August 11, 2008. Both FMs served the area of north Dayton, Vandalia, Englewood and surrounding communities. According to its website, the station's translator moved from 101.5 to 101.1 in August 2008 when the former WKSW \\"Kiss Country\\" (now WCLI) moved from 101.7 to the 101.5 frequency and switched its city of license from Urbana to Enon. The WSWO-LP translator was granted by the FCC earlier in the summer to move to 101.1 under the new callsign W266BG. As of September 2013, the 101.1 translator is no longer in use by the station; it is now being used by WZLR. Also WCWT in Centerville has been granted a construction permit to move to 107.3 MHz to accommodate the WKSW/WCLI move to 101.5 MHz. This move allowed better reception in the southern portion of Dayton as well as the Beavercreek area. WSWO-LP's original frequency was located adjacent to 97.5 (currently used by WTGR licensed in Union City and originating in Greenville.) The 97.5 frequency was previously licensed in the Dayton area and was used in the 1950s for the fledgling but short-lived WLWB-FM, owned by Cincinnati-based Crosley Radio. =Move to 97.5= A construction permit was granted by the FCC on November 23, 2011 to move WSWO-LP from 97.7 to 97.5. On-air testing began on November 30 from the new transmitter site located at the WSWO office and studio location. The move was meant to help resolve coverage problems, notably interference from WOXY which was formerly located in Oxford and is now in Mason. The official switchover from 97.7 to 97.5 took place on Saturday December 3, 2011. 97.7 is now unused in Dayton. On January 25, 2013, WSWO-LP began streaming online at their new domain: www.daytonoldies.org =Move to 97.3= Until October 4, 2013, WSWO-LP operated on the 97.5 frequency. On October 4, 2013, WSWO-LP moved to 97.3 FM, giving the station the ability to upgrade its signal and transmit from a higher tower. With the move, the station no longer needed the W266BG translator at 101.1 FM, which is owned by a separate entity; the translator is now being used by WZLR.

It occupied the space adjacent to the Erechtheum and the old Temple of Athena Polias. The sanctuary was a walled trapezoidal courtyard containing the altar of Zeus Herkeios (protector of the hearth, of the courtyard) under the sacred Olive Tree planted by Athena. At the west was an entrance stoa from the propylea. In the northeast corner was an elaborate entrance into the north porch and the entire Etrechtheion complex. At the east, there was also a small opening through which the Thalassa of Poseidon could be viewed. The south-east corner gave access to what some thought was the tomb of Cecrops. The sanctuary also contained the sacred olive tree which was presented by Athena to the city of Athens, after her victory over Poseidon in the contest for the land of Attica.

Playing career St Juste started his career under the guidance of Simon Clifford at Garforth Town. He became a graduate of the Leeds Brazilian Soccer School's program and was spotted by Football League Two side Darlington, joining them early in the 2004–05 season. He made his Darlington debut in November 2004, playing as a substitute for Adrian Webster in the 2–0 win away to Cheltenham Town. He made his second appearance for Darlington on 3 January 2005 as he played the full 90 minutes and helped the team to a 3–1 win over Macclesfield Town. On 19 March 2005 St Juste made his seventh appearance for Darlington in an away match against Grimsby Town, scoring his first goal for the club. St Juste hit headlines by scooping a hat- trick of awards. He walked away with the young player of the season and both goal of the season awards for his goals against Grimsby Town and Bristol Rovers. He was out of contract at the end of the 2004–05 season and was linked with Southampton who initially insisted that they did not want to sign him. However, he eventually signed for Southampton on a short-term contract in September 2005 following Simon Clifford's appointment as a coach at the club. He failed to appear for Southampton and rejoined Garforth Town in November 2006. He left Garforth to join Sandnes Ulf in 2009. In February 2011 St Juste signed on loan for non-league 'phoenix club' Chester F.C. until the end of the season but his loan was cancelled at the end of March after he failed to make an impact whilst on loan. He later joined F.C. Halifax Town in September 2011. Despite coming on from the bench in most games, Jason was able to score in two games for the Shaymen, at home to Blyth Spartans and away at Corby Town. In the 2012–13 season, St Juste started more games due to a groin injury to Scott McManus, but this meant playing in an unfamiliar left back position. St Juste had a very strong start to the season, including a goal against Chelmsford City in the FA Trophy Third Round, but a hernia meant that he would spend a month on the sidelines. He joined Bradford Park Avenue A.F.C. on 5 September 2015. In summer 2016 he joined Boston United. In summer 2017, he joined FC United of Manchester. In September 2017 he moved to Trafford on dual registration terms.

The nisba (patronymic) of Tayy is aṭ-Ṭāʾī (). The Tayy's origins trace back to the Qahtanites and their original homeland was Yemen although Sebeos later named Iraq as Tachkastan after them. In the 2nd century CE, they migrated to the northern Arabian mountain ranges of Jabal Aja and Jabal Salma, which then collectively became known as \\"Jabal Tayy\\" (later \\"Jabal Shammar\\"). The latter continues to be the traditional homeland of the tribe until the present day. They later established relations with the Sassanid Persian and Byzantine empires. Though traditionally allied with the Sassanids' Lakhmid clients, the Tayy supplanted the Lakhmids as the rulers of Al-Hirah in the 610s. In the late 6th century, the Fasad War split the Tayy, with members of its Jadila branch converting to Christianity and migrating to Syria where they became allied with the Ghassanids, and the Ghawth branch remaining in Jabal Tayy. A chieftain and poet of the Al Ghawth, Hatim al-Ta'i, is widely known among Arabs until today. Hatim's son Adi, and another Tayy chieftain, Zayd al-Khayr, converted to Islam together with much of their tribe in 629–630, and became companions of the Islamic Nabi (Prophet) Muhammad. The Tayy participated in numerous Muslim military campaigns after Muhammad's death, including in the Ridda Wars and the Muslim conquest of Persia. Al-Jadila in northern Syria remained Christian until the Muslim conquest of their region in 638. The Tayy were split during the First Fitna, with those based in Arabia and Iraq supporting Ali as caliph, and those in Syria supporting Mu'awiyah. The latter and his Umayyad kinsmen ultimately triumphed and members of the Tayy participated in the Umayyad conquest of Sindh in the early 8th century. Nonetheless, a branch of the Tayy under Qahtaba ibn Shabib were among the leaders of the Abbasid Revolution which toppled the Umayyads in the mid-8th century. The Tayy fared well under the Abbasids, producing military officials and renowned poets, such as Buhturi and Abu Tammam. By the mid-9th century, Abbasid authority had eroded and the Tayy were left dominant in the southern Syrian Desert and Jabal Tayy. Under their Jarrahid chieftains, they established themselves in Palestine under Fatimid rule. As the virtually independent rulers of the area between al-Ramla and Jabal Tayy, they controlled the key routes between Egypt, Syria, Arabia and Iraq. They vacillated between the Fatimids and the Byzantines and then between the Seljuks and Crusaders until the late 12th and early 13th centuries, when the Tayy's various subbranches, chief among them the Al Fadl, were left as the last politically influential Arab tribe in the region extending from Najd northward to Upper Mesopotamia. Genealogy The Tayy's progenitor, according to early Arab genealogists, was Julhumah ibn Udad, who was known as \\"Tayy\\" or \\"Tayyi\\".Bräu 1936, p. 624.Landau-Tasseron 1998, pp. 85–86. The theory in some Arab tradition, as cited by 9th-century Muslim historian al-Tabari, holds that Julhumah's laqab (surname) of Ṭayyiʾ derived from the word ṭawā, which in Arabic means \\"to plaster\\". He received the name because he was said to have been \\"the first to have plastered the walls of a well\\", according to al- Tabari. Julhumah's ancestry was traced to Kahlan ibn Saba ibn Ya'rub, great- grandson of Qahtan, the semi-legendary, common ancestor of the Arab tribes of southern Arabia. Julhumah was a direct descendant of Kahlan via Julhumah's father Zayd ibn Yashjub,Ibn Abd Rabbih, ed. Boullata, 2011, p. 294. who in turn was a direct descendant of 'Arib ibn Zayd ibn Kahlan. Branches The two main branches of Tayy were Al al-Ghawth and Al Jadilah. The former was named after al-Ghawth, a son of Julhumah. The immediate offspring of al- Ghawth's son, 'Amr, were Thu'al, Aswadan (commonly known as Nabhan), Hani, Bawlan and Salaman.Ibn Abd Rabbih, ed. Boullata 2011, p. 295. The offspring of Thu'al (Banu Thu'al) and Aswadan (Banu Nabhan) became leading sub-branches of the Tayy in northern Arabia, while the offspring of Hani (Banu Hani) became a major sub-branch in southern Mesopotamia. According to traditional Arab genealogists, the Banu Thu'al were the ancestors of the Banu Rabi'ah of Syria, and in turn of the Al Fadl emirs. The Al Jadilah's namesake was a woman of the Tayy named Jadilah, whose sons Hur and Jundub became the progenitors of Banu Hur and Banu Jundub, respectively. The latter produced the numerous Al al- Tha'alib (Tha'laba) subbranch, which itself produced the Banu La'm, which became a leading sub-branch of Al Jadilah in northern Arabia. The Jarm (or Jurum) may have also been a branch of the Al al-Tha'alib. According to the 14th-century Arab historian and sociologist, Ibn Khaldun, the Tayy were among those Qahtanite tribes who lived in the hills and plains of Syria and Mesopotamia and intermarried with non-Arabs. Ibn Khaldun further stated that Tayyid tribesmen did \\"not pay any attention to preserving the (purity of) lineage of their families and groups\\". Thus the lineage of the Tayy's many subbranches was difficult for genealogists to accurately ascertain. Pre- Islamic era=Migration to Jabal Tayy The Banu Tayy were originally based in Yemen, but migrated to northern Arabia in the late 2nd century CE, in the years following the dispersion of the Banu Azd from Yemen. Shortly after the migration they first appear in ancient sources: both Hippolytus of Rome and Uranius mention three distinct peoples in Arabia during the first half of the third century: the \\"Taeni\\", the \\"Saraceni\\" and the \\"Arabes\\". One of the participants of the First Council of Nicaea in 325 is identified as a taēnos. They largely lived among the north Arabian mountain ranges of Aja and Salma with Khaybar north of Medina as their most important oasis, and from there they would make incursions into Syria and Iraq during times of drought. Their concentration in Jabal Aja and Jabal Salma lent the mountain ranges their ancient, collective name \\"Jabal Tayy\\".Shahid 2000, p. 402. Prior to the Tayy migration, the mountains had been the home of the Banu Assad, who lost some territory with the arrival of Tayyid tribesmen. However, the two tribes ultimately became allies in later centuries and intermarried. In ancient times, the two main branches of the Tayy were the Al al-Ghawth and Al Jadila. The tribesmen lived in different parts of the region, with those living among the mountains known as the \\"al-Jabaliyyun\\" (the Mountaineers), those on the plain (mostly from Al Jadila) known as \\"as-Sahiliyyun\\" (the Plainsmen) and those on the desert sands known as \\"al-Ramliyyun\\". Relations with Sassanids and ByzantinesFifth century= The Tayy were so widespread and influential throughout the Syrian Desert that Syriac authors from Mesopotamia used their name, Taienos, Tayenoi, Taiyaya or Tayyaye (), to describe Arab tribesmen in general in much the same way \\"Saracenos\\" was often used by authors from Byzantine Syria and Egypt as a generic term for Arabs.Shahid 1986, p. 126.Abu Izzedin 1993, p. 9.Shahid 1989, p. 117. The Syriac word was also entered into the language of the Sasanid Persians as Tāzīg () and later Tāzī (), also meaning \\"Arab\\".B.G. Franger (2000), \\"Tādjīk\\", Encyclopedia of Islam, vol. X, Leiden: E. J. Brill, , pages 62–64 For the Tayy specifically, the Syriac authors would use the word \\"Tu'aye\\". The Tayy were subjects of the Sassanid Persians. However, they were also counted as allies by the Byzantines' chief Arab foederati in the early to mid-5th century, the Salihids.Shahid 1989, p. 266. The Tayy are mentioned in the late 5th century as having raided numerous villages in the plains and mountains of the Syrian Desert, including parts of Byzantine territory. This prompted the Byzantine army to mobilize its Arab clients at the desert frontiers with Sassanid-held Mesopotamia to confront the Tayy. The Byzantines demanded restitution from the Tayy, but the Sassanid general Qardag Nakoragan instead opened negotiations that called for the Byzantines' Arab clients to restore livestock and captives taken from Sassanid territory in previous years in return for compensation from the Tayy. The negotiations succeeded, and moreover, the Sassanids and Byzantines delineated their borders to prevent future raiding between their respective Arab clients. However, to the embarrassment of the Sassanids and the outrage of the Byzantines, four hundred Tayyid tribesmen raided several minor villages in Byzantine territory while representatives of the two sides were meeting in Nisibis. Despite this violation of the bilateral agreement, the Sassanid-Byzantine peace held.Shahid 1989, pp. 115–116. =Sixth century= Throughout the 6th century, the Tayy continued their relations with the Sassanids and their chief Arab clients, the Lakhmids of Mesopotamia. Towards the end of the 6th century, a Tayyid chief named Hassan assisted the Sassanid king Khosrow II when the latter fled from his usurper, Bahram Chobin, by giving Khosrow a horse. A few years later, the Lakhmid governor of al- Hirah, al-Nu'man III fell out with Khosrow II, who had been restored to the Sassanid throne, and sought safety with the Tayy. The tribe refused to grant refuge to al-Nu'man, who was married to two Tayyid women, and he was ultimately killed by the Sassanids in 602. A Tayyid chief, Iyas ibn Qabisah al-Ta'i, subsequently migrated to al-Hirah with some of his tribesmen and became its governor, ruling from 602 to 611 CE. The Banu Bakr ibn Wa'il tribe opposed the rule of Iyas and began raiding Sassanid territory in southern Mesopotamia. In response, Iyas commanded pro-Sassanid Arab and Persian troops against the Banu Bakr at the Battle of Dhi Qar in 609, in which the Sassanids were defeated. According to historian Irfan Shahid, evidence suggests clans of the Tayy moved into Byzantine-held Syria beginning in the 6th century. By then, the Ghassanids had largely supplanted the Salihids as the Byzantines' main foederati, and the Salihids began living alongside the Tayy in the region of Kufa.Shahid 1989, p. 304. In the late 6th century, the Al al-Ghawth and Al Jadila fought against each other in the 25-year-long Fasad War (harb al-Fasad) in northern Arabia. Numerous atrocities were committed by both factions and the war resulted in the migration of several Jadila clans from the north Arabian plains to Syria,Hitti 1916, p. 224. while the Al Al-Ghawth remained in Jabal Aja and Jabal Salma. The Jadila tribesmen founded a hadir (military encampment) near Qinnasrin (Chalcis) called \\"Hadir Tayyi\\" after the tribe. The Ghassanid king al-Harith ibn Jabalah brokered a peace between the Tayy factions, ending the Fasad War.Shahid 1995, p. 338. Afterward, the Tayy's relations with the Ghassanids, which had previously been checkered, were much improved. The Al Jadila converted to Christianity, the religion adopted decades earlier by the Ghassanids. Some other clans of the Banu Tayy remained pagan, worshiping the deities of Ruda and al-Fils. Those who converted to Christianity apparently embraced their new faith zealously and produced two well-known priests, named in Syriac sources as Abraham and Daniel. Sometime during the 6th century, the Tayy and the Asad formed a confederation, which was later joined by the Banu Ghatafan as well. The alliance collapsed when Asad and Ghatafan assaulted both the Al al-Ghawth and Al Jadilah and drove them out of their territories in Jabal Tayy. However, one of the leaders of the Asad, Dhu al-Khimarayn Awf al-Jadhami defected from the Ghatafan soon after and reestablished the alliance with the Tayy. Together, they campaigned against Ghatafan and restored their territories in Jabal Tayy. Islamic era=Muhammad's days The Tayy's initial reaction to the emergence of Islam in Arabia was varied, with some embracing the new faith and others resistant. The Tayyid clans of Jabal Tayy, all of whom lived within close proximity of each other, had maintained close relationships with the inhabitants and tribes of Mecca and Medina, the setting of Islam's birth.Siddiqui 1987, p. 89. Among their contacts in Mecca were tribesmen from the Quraysh, the tribe of the Islamic prophet and leader, Muhammad. There was a degree of intermarriage between the Tayy and Quraysh. The Tayy also had a level of interaction with the Jewish tribe of Banu Nadir, with the father of one of its leading members and enemy of the early Muslims, Ka'b ibn al-Ashraf (died 624), being from Tayy. In the first years of Muhammad's mission, individual members of certain Tayyid clans converted to Islam.Siddiqui 1987, p. 90. Among these early converts were Suwayd ibn Makhshi who fought against the pagan Arabs of Mecca, including two of his kinsmen, in the Battle of Badr in 624 CE; Walid ibn Zuhayr who served as a guide for the Muslims in their expedition against the Banu Asad in Qatan in 625; and Rafi' ibn Abi Rafi' who fought under Muslim commander Amr ibn al-As in the Battle of Chains in October 629.Siddiqui 1987, pp. 89–90. In 630, Muhammad dispatched his cousin Ali ibn Abi Talib on an expedition to destroy the Tayy's principal idol, al-Fils, in Jabal Aja.Bräu 1936, p. 624. As a result of the expedition, the Tayy's Kufa-based Christian chieftain, Adi ibn Hatim, who belonged to the Banu Thu'ayl branch of Al al- Ghawth, fled to Syria with some of his tribesmen to join other Tayyid clans, but his sister was captured. The Tayyid clans that remained in Jabal Tayy, including Banu Ma'n, Banu Aja, Banu Juwayn and Banu Mu'awiya, converted to Islam. Meanwhile, Adi's sister beckoned Muhammad to release her, which he did after learning that her father was Hatim ibn Abdullah. Out of respect for the latter's honorable reputation, Muhammad gave her good clothes and money and had her escorted to her family in Syria. Impressed by Muhammad's treatment of his sister, Adi met Muhammad and converted to Islam, along with most of his kinsmen. In 630–31, a delegation of fifteen Tayyid chiefs led by Zayd al- Khayl, who belonged to the Banu Nabhan clan of the Al al-Ghawth,Landau 1984, p. 62. converted to Islam and pledged allegiance to Muhammad. The latter was uniquely impressed by Zayd, who died a year later.Landau 1984, p. 57. Thus by the time of Muhammad's death, the Arabia-based clans of the Al Jadilah and Al al-Ghawth had become Muslims. In doing so, they firmly broke away from their long-time alliance with the Banu Assad and Banu Ghatafan. Ridda Wars Following Muhammad's death in 632, several Arab tribes rebelled against his Rashidun successor, Caliph Abu Bakr, switching their allegiance to Tulayha of the Banu Asad. The Tayy's allegiance during the ensuing Ridda Wars is a \\"widely disputed matter\\", according to historian Ella Landau-Tasseron.Landau- Tasseron 1984, p. 53. Some Muslim traditions claim all of the Tayy remained committed to Islam, while Sayf ibn Umar's tradition holds they all defected. Landau-Tasseron asserts that neither extreme is correct, with some Tayy leaders, foremost among them Adi ibn Hatim, fighting on the Muslim side and others joining the rebels. However, Tayyid rebels did not engage in direct conflict with the Muslims. Muhammad had appointed Adi to collect sadaqa (tribute) from the Tayy and Banu Asad.Landau-Tasseron 1984, p. 54. After Muhammad's death and the resulting chaos among the Muslims and the belief that Islam would imminently collapse, those among the Tayy who had paid their sadaqa (in this case, 300 camels) to Adi demanded the return of their camels or they would rebel. Adi either advised them to abandon this demand because Islam would survive Muhammad's death and they would be viewed as traitors or threatened to fight against them if they revolted. After this encounter, the accounts of contemporary and early Muslim historians vary. It is clear, that Adi played an integral role in preventing much of the rebellious clans of Tayy from actually fighting the Muslims and preventing the Muslims from attacking the Tayy. When he heard news of Abu Bakr's dispatch of a Muslim army against the Tayy in Syria, he sought to stop their march by smuggling the contested 300 camels to Abu Bakr, making the Tayy the first tribe to pay the sadaqa, an action that was widely lauded by Muhammad's companions. It is apparent that Adi's traditional rivals within the Tayy from the Banu Nabhan (led by Zayd's son Muhalhil) and Banu La'm (led by Thumama ibn Aws), or at least some of their members, joined Tulayha in Buzakha (in northern Najd), while their other members also defected but remained in Jabal Tayy.Landau-Tasseron 1984, p. 59. Adi persuaded the latter to return to Islam, which they agreed to.Landau- Tasseron 1984, pp. 60–61. However, they refused to abandon their tribesmen in Buzakha, fearing Tulayha would hold them hostage if he discovered they joined the Muslims. Thus, Adi and the Muslim Tayyids devised a strategy to lure the Tayy in Tulayha's camp to return to Jabal Tayy by issuing a false claim that the Muslims were attacking them. When the apostate Tayyids reached their tribesmen in Jabal Tayy, far from Tulayha's reach, they discovered the false alarm and were persuaded to rejoin Islam. With this, the entirety of the Al al-Ghawth had returned to the Muslim side. However, the Al Jadila remained in revolt and the Muslim commander Khalid ibn al-Walid was set to move against them. He was stopped by the intercession of Adi, who was able secure the Al Jadila's allegiance through diplomacy. The consensus in all Muslim traditions is that the Tayy of Arabia was firmly on the Muslims' side by the time of the Battle of Buzakha in September 632.Landau-Tasseron 1984, p. 66. The Tayy supposedly were given their own banner in the Muslim army, per their request, which was a testament to their influence since only the Ansar (core of the Muslim force) had their own banner.Landau-Tasseron 1984, p. 64. At the Battle of Buzakha against Tulayha, Adi and Muknif ibn Zayd, who unlike Zayd's other son Muhalhil had fought alongside the Muslims from the start, commanded the right and left wings of the Muslim army. In 634 the \\"Tayyaye d-Mhmt\\" were reported by Thomas the Presbyter as fighting with Romans 12 miles east of Gaza. Rashidun conquests During the Battle of the Bridge against the Sassanids in 634, another of Zayd's sons, Urwah, participated and was said by al-Baladhuri to have \\"fought so fiercely that his action was estimated to be equivalent to be that of a whole group of men\\".Hitti 1916, p. 404. During the battle, Christian Tayy tribesmen on the Sassanid side defected to the Muslim army, preventing an imminent Muslim rout. Among those who defected were the poet Abu Zubayd at-Ta'i. Urwah later fought at the Battle of al-Qadisiyah and died fighting the Daylamites. The Al Jadila tribesmen based in Qinnasrin did not join their Arabian counterparts and fought alongside the Byzantines during the Muslim conquest of Syria. The Muslim general Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah encountered them in their hadir in 638, after which many agreed to convert to Islam, though a large section remained Christian and agreed to pay jizya (poll tax). Most of the Christian tribesmen became Muslims in the few years after, with few exceptions. Umayyad period In the first Muslim civil war, the Tayy under Adi were strong supporters of Ali against the Umayyads. They fought alongside him at the Battle of the Camel and the Battle of Siffin in 656 and 657, respectively. During the latter battle, a chief of the tribe, Sa'id ibn Ubayd at-Ta'i, was slain.Madelung 1997, p. 166. Unlike the Tayy of Arabia, the Tayy in Syria led by Habis ibn Sa'd at-Ta'i aligned with the Umayyads, who assigned Habis as the commander of Jund Hims.Madelung 1997, p. 246. In a confrontation between the two sides in Iraq, Habis was killed. Habis was the maternal uncle of Adi's son, Zayd, and the latter was angered by his slaying, prompting him to seek out and kill the Ali loyalist, a member of the Banu Bakr, responsible for Habis's death. Zayd's act was sharply condemned by Adi who threatened to hand him over to Ali, prompting Zayd to defect to the Umayyads. Afterward, Adi smoothed over the consequent tension with Ali's camp by reaffirming his loyalty. The Umayyads ultimately triumphed and established a caliphate that had reached the Indian Subcontinent by the early 8th century. A Tayyid commander named al-Qasim ibn Tha'laba ibn Abdullah ibn Hasn played an instrumental role in the Umayyad conquest of Sindh in 712 by killing the country's Hindu king Raja Dahir in battle. Abbasid period The Abbasids contested leadership of the caliphate and overtook the Umayyads in what became known as the Abbasid Revolution in the mid-8th century. The leader of the Abbasid movement in Khurasan in northeastern Persia was a member of the Tayy, Qahtaba ibn Shabib. The tribe fared well during Abbasid rule. A prominent akhbari (transmitter of hadith) in the early 9th century was a Tayyid named al-Haytham ibn Adi (died 822). Two major poets from the Tayy also emerged in the 9th century: Abu Tammam and al-Buhturi. The former, who authored the Hamasah anthology, may not have been an actual member of the tribe, but had adopted the tribe as his own. Abbasid authority in Syria and Iraq eroded considerably after the beginning of the \\"Anarchy at Samarra\\" in 861, which left the vast expanse of the Syrian and Arabian deserts without governmental oversight.Salibi 1977, p. 43. During this period, the Tayy dominated the southern part of the Syrian Desert, the Banu Kilab dominated the northern part and the Banu Kalb dominated central Syria. The latter tribe, whose presence in the region had preceded the Muslim conquest and the migration of the Tayy and Kilab, was largely sedentarized, while the Tayy and Kilab, being relative newcomers to the region, were still highly mobile nomadic groups.Salibi 1977, p. 85. According to Kamal Salibi, the Tayy's \\"chief military asset, in fact, was their Bedouin swiftness of movement\\". Moreover, the durable connections the Tayy of Syria maintained with their north Arabian counterparts in Jabal Tayy made them virtually independent and prone to revolt against the various Muslim states in Syria and Iraq. The Tayy made their abode in Transjordan and the Bilad al-Sharat mountains between Transjordan and the Hejaz.Salibi 1977, p. 47. Here they first received attention in 883 when they launched a revolt that spanned southern Syria and the northern Hejaz.Salibi, pp. 47–48. The Tayy's revolt prevented the passage of the annual Hajj caravan from Damascus to Mecca until it was quashed by the Tulunid ruler Khumarawayh (884–896) in 885. For the remainder of Khumarawayh's reign, the Tayy remained suppressed, possibly due to the help of older-established Arab tribes like the Judham and Lakhm. However, law and order once again broke down during the reigns of Khumarawayh's successors Jaysh and Harun between 896 and 904. This coincided with the rising strength of the anarchist Qarmatian movement in eastern Arabia and southern Iraq. The Tayy associated themselves with the Qarmatians to establish their dominance of southern Syria; with likely Qarmatian encouragement, the Tayy launched a revolt between Syria and the Hejaz in 898, during which they plundered caravans and disrupted lines of communication. Fatimid period When the Qarmatians attacked Ikhshidid-controlled Palestine in 968, the leading Tayyid clan of Jarrah came with them and firmly established themselves in the country.Salibi 1977, p. 91. However, under the Jarrahid chieftains, the Tayy assisted the Fatimids, who conquered the Ikhshidids, against the Qarmatians in 971 and 977. During the latter occasion, the Jarrahid chieftain Mufarrij ibn Daghfal captured the pro-Qarmatian rebel, Alptakin, and handed him over to the Fatimids in exchange for a large reward. In return for his support, Mufarrij was appointed by the Fatimids as the governor of Ramla, the traditional Muslim capital of Palestine. Mufarrij was also the preeminent chieftain of the Banu Tayy tribe as a whole, giving him authority over his Bedouin and peasant kinsmen in an area extending from the coast of Palestine eastward through Balqa and to the Tayy's traditional homeland in northern Arabia. While his Fatimid assignment gave him prestige, Mufarrij's tribal authority was the source of his independent power. The Tayyid-dominated region was the location of the overland routes connecting Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Arabia. This gave Mufarrij significant leverage with the Fatimids, who thus could not afford alienating him and risk him switching allegiance to the Fatimids' rivals in Iraq, the Buwayhids. In 981–82, relations between the Jarrahids and the Fatimids collapsed and the former were driven out of Palestine.Canard, p. 483. They sacked a Hajj pilgrim caravan later in 982, then annihilated a Fatimid army at Ayla, before being defeated and forced to flee north toward Homs.Canard, pp. 619–620. Between then and Mufarrij's death in 1013, the Tayy switched allegiance between the various regional powers, including the Fatimids, Byzantines, and the Hamdanids' Turkish governor of Homs, Bakjur. By the time of Mufarrij's death, the Jarrahids had restored their dominant position in Palestine. Mufarrij's son, Hassan, maintained relations with the Fatimids under Caliph al-Hakim, but when the latter disappeared, Hassan's relations with his successor deteriorated.Canard, p. 621. In 1021, the Banu Nabhan led by Hamad ibn Uday besieged the Khurasani pilgrim caravan in Fayd near Jabal Tayy despite being paid off by the Khurasani sultan, Mahmud of Ghazni. During this period, in 1025, the Tayy made an agreement with the Kilab and the Kalb, whereby Hassan ibn Mufarrij of Tayy ruled Palestine, Sinan ibn Sulayman of the Kalb ruled Damascus and Salih ibn Mirdas of the Kilab ruled Aleppo. Together, they defeated a Fatimid punitive expedition sent by Caliph az-Zahir at Ascalon, and Hassan conquered al-Ramla. The alliance fell apart when the Kalb defected to the Fatimids, who decisively defeated the Tayy and Kilab near Lake Tiberias in 1029, prompting Hassan and his tribesmen to flee northward. The Tayy established an alliance with the Byzantines and upon the latter's invitation, the 20,000-strong Tayy of Syria relocated their encampments from the vicinity of Palmyra to the al-Ruj plain, near Byzantine-held Antioch, in 1031. The Tayy continued to fight alongside the Byzantines under Hassan and his son Allaf, protecting Edessa from Numayrid and Marwanid advances in 1036.Canard, p. 622. In 1041, the Jarrahids regained control of Palestine, but the Fatimids continued to go to war against them. The Jarrahids continued to disrupt Fatimid rule until the Fatimids were driven out of Syria and Palestine in 1071.Salibi 1977, p. 93. Later Islamic era With the end of the Fatimid era in Syria and Palestine, descendants of Mufarrij entered the service of the Muslim states of the region, first with the cadet branches of the Seljuk Empire, beginning with the Burids of Damascus, then their Zengid successors, who came to rule all of Syria and Upper Mesopotamia.Hiyari 1975, p. 513. At times, the Tayy fought alongside the Crusaders, who had conquered the Syrian coastal regions, including Palestine, in 1098–1100. By the end of the 11th century, the Banu Rabi'ah branch of the Tayy (direct descendants of Mufarrij) and the Mazyadid branch of the Banu Assad were the last influential Arab tribes in Syria and Iraq, with the rest having \\"disappeared from the political map\\", according to historian Mustafa A. Hiyari.Hiyari 1975, pp. 511–512. The tribal distribution in the Syrian and north Arabian deserts had significantly changed by the late 12th century as a result of the decline of several major tribes, the expansion of others, namely the Tayy, and the gradual assimilation of substantial Bedouin population with the settled inhabitants.Hiyari 1975, p. 512. The Tayy were left as the predominant tribe of the entire Syrian steppe, Upper Mesopotamia, Najd and the northern Hejaz. The Tayy divisions and their respective territories at the time were as follows: The Al Fadl of Banu Rabi'ah controlled the regions of Homs and Hama eastward to Qal'at Ja'bar at the Euphrates Valley and southward along the valley through Basra and ultimately to the al-Washm region of central Najd; the Al Mira of Banu Rabi'ah controlled the Golan Heights and the area southward to the al-Harrah field north of Mecca; the Al Ali branch of the Al Fadl controlled the Ghouta region around Damascus and southeastward to Tayma and al-Jawf in northern Najd; the Shammar and Banu Lam controlled Jabal Aja and Jabal Salma; the Ghuzayya held territories within parts of Syria, the Hejaz and Iraq that were controlled by the Banu Rabi'ah.Hiyari 1975, pp. 512–513. In Lower Egypt, the Sunbis branch of the Tayy lived in the Buhayrah district, while the Tha'laba branch inhabited the area stretching from Egypt's Mediterranean coast northeastward to al-Kharruba in the western Galilee.Sato, p. 98. The Tha'laba were particularly influential in the al-Sharqiyah district in the Nile Delta. The Banu Jarm, who inhabited the area stretching from Gaza to the northern coastline of Palestine, were also a Tayyid tribe according to some sources, while others consider them to be from the Qud'ah branch of the Banu Himyar tribe. During Mamluk rule, the Bedouin of Syria were used as auxiliaries in the Mamluks' wars with the Mongols based in Iraq and Anatolia. In central and northern Syria, the Bedouin came under the authority of the Al Fadl emirs in their capacity as the hereditary officeholders of the amir al-ʿarab (commander of the Bedouin) post, beginning with Emir Isa ibn Muhanna (r. 1260–1284). The Al Mira emirs held a similar, but lower-ranking office, in southern Syria, and its preeminent emir was known as malik al-ʿarab (king of the Bedouin).Hiyari, p. 517. In al-Sharqiyah, the Tha'laba, whose encampments were close to the Mamluk seat of government, were tasked with maintaining and protecting the barid (postal route) in their district and were occasionally appointed to government posts. The Tayy in Syria and Egypt were both required to supply Arabian horses to the Mamluks for use in the army and barid. Sultan an-Nasir Muhammad had a special affinity for the Bedouin and maintained strong relations with the tribes of Syria and Egypt. However, following his death, the state's relations with the Bedouin deteriorated. The Tha'laba left their semi-permanent camp in al-Sharqiya to maraud across the country and joined the revolt of the al-A'id tribe in the mid-14th century.Levanoni, p. 182.

Secondary craters are impact craters formed by the ejecta that was thrown out of a larger crater. They sometimes form radial crater chains. In addition, secondary craters are often seen as clusters or rays surrounding primary craters. The study of secondary craters exploded around the mid-twentieth century when researchers studying surface craters to predict the age of planetary bodies realized that secondary craters contaminated the crater statistics of a body's crater count. Formation When a velocity-driven extraterrestrial object impacts a relatively stationary body, an impact crater forms. Initial crater(s) to form from the collision are known as primary craters or impact craters. Material expelled from primary craters may form secondary craters (secondaries) under a few conditions: # Primary craters must already be present. # The gravitational acceleration of the extraterrestrial body must be great enough to drive the ejected material back toward the surface. # The velocity by which the ejected material returns toward the body's surface must be large enough to form a crater. If ejected material is within an atmosphere, such as on Earth, Venus, or Titan, then it is more difficult to retain high enough velocity to create secondary impacts. Likewise, bodies with higher resurfacing rates, such as Io, also do not record surface cratering. Cartoon strip of the formation of impact craters and, subsequently, secondary craters. From left to right, shows the timeline of a mass impacting a body, ejecta propagating from the initial impact, shock wave motion and the resulting cratered surface. The right most rectangle features arrows, which express the location at which secondary craters will form outside of or away from the impact center. Self-secondary crater Self- secondary craters are a those that form from ejected material of a primary crater but that are ejected at such an angle that the ejected material makes an impact within the primary crater itself. Self-secondary craters have caused much controversy with scientists who excavate cratered surfaces with the intent to identify its age based on the composition and melt material. An observed feature on Tycho has been interpreted to be a self-secondary crater morphology known as palimpsests. Appearance Secondary craters are formed around primary craters. When a primary crater forms following a surface impact, the shock waves from the impact will cause the surface area around the impact circle to stress, forming a circular outer ridge around the impact circle. Ejecta from this initial impact is thrust upward out of the impact circle at an angle toward the surrounding area of the impact ridge. This ejecta blanket, or broad area of impacts from the ejected material, surrounds the crater. Copernicus (upper center, yellow), ejecta blanketed the surrounding area. Blue denotes the outline of the ejecta deposit; secondary craters and crater chains are orange. Chains and clusters Secondary crater chain of Copernicus in Mare Imbrium Secondary craters may appear as small-scaled singular craters similar to a primary crater with a smaller radius, or as chains and clusters. A secondary crater chain is simply a row or chain of secondary craters lined adjacent to one another. Likewise, a cluster is a population of secondaries near to one another. ESP 017244 2050secondarycraters.jpgGroup of secondary craters on Mars, as seen by HiRISE Distinguishing factors of primary and secondary craters=Impact energy Primary craters form from high-velocity impacts whose foundational shock waves must exceed the speed of sound in the target material. Secondary craters occur at lower impact velocities. However, they must still occur at high enough speeds to deliver stress to the target body and produce strain results that exceed the limits of elasticity, that is, secondary projectiles must break the surface. It can be increasing difficult to distinguish primary craters from secondaries craters when the projectile fractures and breaks apart prior to impact. This depends on conditions in the atmosphere, coupled with projectile velocity and composition. For instance, a projectile that strikes the moon will probably hit intact; whereas if it strikes the earth, it will be slowed and heated by atmospheric entry, possibly breaking up. In that case, the smaller chunks, now separated from the large impacting body, may impact the surface of the planet in the region outside the primary crater, which is where many secondary craters appear following primary surface impact. Illustration of projectile fracturing prior to primary impact to show the chronological procedure of the creation of primary and secondary impacts from projectile fractures. Impact angle For primary impacts, based on geometry, the most probable impact angle is 45° between two objects, and the distribution falls off rapidly outside of the range 30° - 60°. It is observed that impact angle has little effect on the shape of primary craters, except in the case of low angle impacts, where the resulting crater shape becomes less circular and more elliptical. The primary impact angle is much more influential on the morphology (shape) of secondary impacts. Experiments conducted from lunar craters suggests that the ejection angle is at its highest for the early-stage ejecta, that which is ejected from the primary impact at its earliest moments, and that the ejection angle decreases with time for the late-stage ejecta. For example, a primary impact that is vertical to the body surface may produce early-stage ejection angles of 60°-70°, and late-stage ejection angles that have decreases to nearly 30°. Target type Mechanical properties of a target's regolith (existing loose rocks) will influence the angle and velocity of ejecta from primary impacts. Research using simulations has been conducted that suggest that a target body's regolith decreases the velocity of ejecta. Secondary crater sizes and morphology also are affected by the distribution of rock sizes in the regolith of the target body. Projectile type The calculation of depth of secondary crater can be formulated based on the target body's density. Studies of the Nördlinger Ries in Germany and of ejecta blocks circling lunar and martian crater rims suggest that ejecta fragments having a similar density would likely express the same depth of penetration, as opposed to ejecta of differing densities creating impacts of varying depths, such as primary impactors, i.e. comets and asteroids. Size and Morphology Secondary crater size is dictated by the size of its parent primary crater. Primary craters can vary from microscopic to thousands of kilometers wide. The morphology of primary craters ranges from bowl-shaped to large, wide basins, where multi-ringed structures are observed. Two factors dominate the morphologies of these craters: material strength and gravity. The bowl-shaped morphology suggests that the topography is supported by the strength of the material, while the topography of the basin-shaped craters is overcome by gravitational forces and collapses toward flatness. The morphology, and size, of secondary craters is limited. Secondary craters exhibit a maximum diameter of < 5% of its parent primary crater. The size of a secondary crater is also dependent on its distance from its primary. The morphology of secondaries is simple but distinctive. Secondaries that form closer to their primaries appear more elliptical with shallower depths. These may form rays or crater chains. The more distant secondaries appear similar in circularity to their parent primaries, but these are often seen in an array of clusters. Age constraints due to secondary craters Scientists have long been collecting data surrounding impact craters from the observation that craters are present all throughout the span of the solar system. Most notably, impact craters are studied for the purposes of estimating ages, both relative and absolute, of planetary surfaces. Dating terrains on planets from the according to density of craters has developed into a thorough technique, however 3 key assumptions control it: # craters exist as independently, contingent occurrences. # size frequency distribution (SFD) of primary craters is known. # cratering rate relative to time is known. Photographs taken from notable lunar and martian missions have provided scientists the ability to count and log the number of observed craters on each body. These crater count databases are further sorted according to each craters size, depth, morphology, and location. The observations and characteristics of both primaries and secondaries are used in distinguishing impact craters within small crater cluster, which are characterized as clusters of craters with a diameter ≤1 km. Unfortunately, age research stemming from these crater databases is restrained due to the pollution of secondary craters. Scientists are finding it difficult to sort out all the secondary craters from the count, as they present false assurance of statistical vigor. Contamination by secondaries is often misused to calculate age constraints due to the erroneous attempts of using small craters to date small surface areas.

At its greatest extent, the domain of Bani Khalid extended from Iraq in the north to the borders of Oman in the South, and Bani Khalid wielded political influence by ruling the region of Nejd in central Arabia.

The Bani Khalid dominated the deserts surrounding the Al-Hasa and Al- Qatif during the 15th and 18th century.Mandaville, p. 503 Under Barrak ibn Ghurayr of the Al Humaid, the Bani Khalid were able to expel Ottoman forces from the cities and towns in 1670 and proclaim their rule over the region.Fattah, p. 83Ibn Agil, p. 78 Ibn Ghurayr made his capital in Al- Mubarraz, where remnants of his castle stand today. According to Arabian folklore, one chief of the Bani Khalid attempted to protect the prized desert bustard (Habari) from extinction by prohibiting the bedouin in his realm from poaching the bird's eggs, earning the tribe the appellation of \\"protectors of the eggs of the Habari\\", an allusion to the chief's absolute supremacy over his realm.شبكة قبيلة بني خالد The first chieftain of the \\"Khawalid\\" was Haddori. Fall to the Saudis The Bani Khalid of eastern Arabia maintained ties with members of their tribe who had settled in Nejd during their earlier migration eastwards, and also cultivated clients among the rulers of the Nejdi towns, such as the Al Mu'ammar of al-Uyayna. When the emir of Uyayna adopted the ideas of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the Khalidi chief ordered him to cease support for Ibn Abd al-Wahhab and expel him from his town. The emir agreed, and Ibn Abd al-Wahhab moved to neighboring Dir'iyyah, where he joined forces with the Al Saud. The Bani Khalid remained staunch enemies of the Saudis and their allies and attempted to invade Nejd and Diriyyah in an effort to stop Saudi expansion. Their efforts failed, however, and after conquering Nejd, the Saudis invaded the Bani Khalid's domain in al-Hasa and deposed the Al 'Ura'yir in 1793. In the early 1950s many Al Arabi people originating from Iraq migrated to Saudi Arabia Al Qassim Return and Fall from Power When the Ottomans invaded Arabia and overthrew the Al Saud in 1818, they conquered al-Hasa, al-Qatif and reinstated members of the Al 'Uray'ir as rulers of the region. The Bani Khalid were no longer the potent military force they once were at this time, and tribes such as the Ajman, the Dawasir, Subay' and Mutayr began encroaching on the Bani Khalid's desert territories. They were also beset by internal quarrels over leadership. Though the Bani Khalid were able to forge an alliance with the 'Anizzah tribe in this period, they were eventually defeated by an alliance of several tribes along with the Al Saud, who had reestablished their rule in Riyadh in 1823. A battle with an alliance led by the Mutayr and 'Ajman tribes in 1823,Meglio and another battle with the Subay' and the Al Saud in 1830, brought the rule of the Bani Khalid to a close. The Ottomans appointed a governor from Bani Khalid over al-Hasa once more in 1874, but his rule also was short-lived.Al-Rasheed, p. 36 Present Many clans and sections of the Bani Khalid had already settled in al-Hasa and Nejd by this time, but many of those who remained leaving east Arabia after their military defeats against Ibn saud, eventually settled in Iraq, Jordan. The clan today consists of important rulers, and members of government.

Abdul Aziz, of his great humanity and remarkable qualities of leadership, and to highlight his central contribution to, and continuous support for Islamic Solidarity; *To support research in areas related to Islamic civilization, to develop it along scientific lines, and to encourage researchers and students at all academic levels; *To help train a new generation of scholars specialized in the fields of Islamic studies, Arabic language, and the social sciences; *To help promote and preserve the Islamic heritage by organizing annual exhibits at the Center; *To organize lectures, conferences, and symposia, of both a general and specialized nature, on issues vital to Islam and to Muslims and to their roles in the present and in the future, linking today’s Muslims to the roots of Islamic culture; *To continue to build libraries through the acquisition of resources relating to any aspect of Islamic civilization, and to make the Center one of the principal resources on Islamic civilization worldwide; *To develop specialized databases in fields relating to the mission of the Center and its areas of specialization, thus enhancing the library services available to researchers and students at the Center; *To translate scientific treatises and research into foreign languages, and to translate a variety of works into Arabic, when such translation would be of service in achieving the aims and objectives of the Center; *To support and encourage research that falls within the Center’s interest. The Library The Library's collection covers the fields of Islamic Studies and Islamic Civilization. At present, there are more than 250,000 volumes in Arabic and Latin languages. There is also a collection of rare and out-of-print periodicals and more than half million articles. A separate audio-visual research library has more than 11,000 audio and videocassettes, slides, and films, which contain lectures and documentary material related to the Center’s various activities and interests. Manuscripts Library As part of the Foundation’s contribution to preserving Islamic culture and highlighting the contributions made by Muslim and Arab scholars, The King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies has undertaken the challenging mission of locating, authenticating, acquiring, or copying, and indexing all known Islamic manuscripts worldwide. In addition to nearly 23,000 hand-written texts, some of which are more than 1,200 years old, the manuscript archives have more than 18,000 microfilms and hundreds of photocopies. The majority of the microfilms are acquired through mutual agreements with the Bibliothèque Nationale of Paris, the Library of Congress, and the British Library. Databases save researchers up to 70% of the time they would normally spend searching catalogs for information pertaining to manuscripts located elsewhere in the world.

It serves as an entertainment, cultural, educational, and assembly center for the citizens of El Paso County, the Pikes Peak region, and the surrounding area.  History  Built by the citizens of El Paso County in 1982 to serve as a regional entertainment and cultural center, the Pikes Peak Center's downtown Colorado Springs location was a piece of the economic rejuvenation action plan for the innercity business quarter. It opened October 15, 1982 with the Colorado Springs Symphony Orchestra, now known as the Colorado Springs Philharmonic Orchestra. The Pikes Peak Center has since achieved international approval for its design and acoustical attributes, and artists and critics have spoken highly in their compliments of the Center. More than 200 concerts are hosted by The Center each year. The proprietor of the Center is El Paso County, and it is operated alongside the Broadmoor World Arena.  Seating  The concert hall features seating from throughout the orchestra, loge, mezzanine and balcony sections. There are side box seats at the mezzanine and balcony levels, seat towers can be positioned on stage, and additional seats can be placed on the lift. At maximum, there are 1,171 seats on the main floor (Orchestra & Loge), 290 seats on the mezzanine level, and 528 seats on the balcony level.  Acoustics  Cosmos Serenade artwork, added in 2009 The Pikes Peak Center's El Pomar Great Hall was designed by Russell Johnson's firm, Artec Consultants Inc, a theatre consulting and acoustics firm (also responsible for the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center's Eugene McDermott Concert Hall), and has several different acoustic control features. In addition to on-stage curtains, there are retractable banners along the side walls of the hall that can be lowered to absorb sound and curtains on the rear wall of each seating level. The banners are lowered for events utilizing the sound system, and retracted for symphonic and choral events. The loudspeaker bridge above the proscenium can be set at one level for events using the sound system and be retracted when its use is not required. The acoustic canopy above the Orchestra platform can be lifted from a position where it can be maintained from the floor to a position immediately below the room's ceiling. The canopy is positioned to reflect sound to the Orchestra and Loge seats when a smaller audience is anticipated, or raised for full sound dispersion when a large audience is anticipated. The on stage sound reflecting towers containing audience seating are positioned around the stage for symphony and choral performances. The seating towers and the stair towers for audience access/egress are moved on airbearings. The upper part of the stage house is separated from the performance space during symphony and choral performances by four ceiling panels over the stage that can be raised, lowered, or tilted vertically to change the acoustics of the hall.  Equipment loading and transport  Next to stage left are the loading docks which can accept two tractor-trailers simultaneously. Loading is done through two detached 12-foot- wide 10-foot-high (3.7 m × 3.0 m) overhead doors. Cargo then turns 90 degrees to the right to go to the stage. An 8-foot-wide 8-foot-high 12-foot-deep (2.4 m × 2.4 m × 3.7 m) freight elevator is positioned in the delivery area. The elevator provides access to the basement levels for transportation of equipment into the orchestra pit area and the choir dressing rooms.  Stage  The proscenium has a maximum opening of 81 by 40 feet (25 m × 12 m), but can be reduced to 34 by 16 feet (10 m × 5 m) with black velour masking. There is a 6-foot-deep (1.8 m) apron. And the working depth of the stage is from the plaster line. The stage is wide. The floor of the stage is maple over plywood, over two layers of sleepers, over neoprene blocks. The floor has wonderful resiliency for ballet and other dance mediums. Any kind of nailing or screwing into the floor is forbidden. The frontmost part of the stage consists of two screw jack lifts that can be raised to the level of the stage, arranged as a part of a two-tier stage setup, positioned at audience floor level, or lowered to create an orchestra pit. These orchestra pit/fore-stage lifts can also be lowered to the basement where audience seating can be positioned on the lifts. The audience seating is located on seating wagons, two of which travel on fixed rubber tire wheels from their storage level onto one of the lifts. The other four seating wagons travel on air bearings which float the wagons like a hovercraft onto downstage most orchestra pit/fore-stage lift. Orchestra player chairs and stands can also be transported to stage level via these lifts. The stage's maximum load is 160 pounds per square foot (780 kg/m2).  Dressing rooms  Directly behind the stage are six individual dressing rooms, each with its own make up station, toilet, sink and shower. The basement level contains two choir dressing rooms. Dressing room \\"A\\", with , is equipped with 24 makeup stations, and dressing room \\"B\\", with , is equipped with 31 makeup stations. Both rooms contain showers, sinks, and toilets.

In 1903 he moved to Saratoga, Texas, where he gained employment with the newly formed Texas Company, which eventually became Texaco, and when he left that organization ten years later, he had attained the rank of general superintendent of production. While there, however, he became friends with J.S. Cullinan, and the two, along with Emerson Francis Woodward, Will C. Hogg, and James L. Autry, joined in 1914 to form the Farmers Petroleum Company, of which Lee became president. Life In 1916 Lee, along with Cullinan, Woodward, and other associates, organized the American Republics Corporation that later controlled twenty-one subsidiaries involved in all facets of the oil industry: prospecting, production, refining, and transportation, as well as manufacturing ships, tank cars, and oil tools. While serving on the board of directors, Lee also held the position of vice president in charge of production. But things would eventually sour between Lee and Cullinan, and several years later, they headed opposing forces bitterly engaged in a stock war for control of the corporation. Cullinan not only defeated Lee in the struggle, but he put his own son Craig into Lee's position as vice president. More than he could bear, Lee resigned and began a lucrative career in the investment field. At the suggestion of his older brother, William Ellsworth \\"Bill\\" Lee, T. P. agreed to meet with a young wildcatter named Miles Franklin Yount, at the time a resident of Sour Lake, Texas, and afterward, T. P. invested $25,000 in the new enterprise that became the Yount-Lee Oil Company, one of the most successful independent oil producers of its day. Yount-Lee went on to drill numerous deep-flank oil wells in both East Texas and Louisiana, and was responsible for the Second Spindletop boom begun at Beaumont, Texas on November 14, 1925. Lee also became active in agriculture and cattle breeding on his ranch in Uvalde County. An avid Republican, he attended several national conventions as a delegate, and in 1924 he refused the party's nomination for governor of Texas. He twice married, the first to Elizabeth Mann on July 14, 1892. Before she died on June 21, 1895, however, the union produced one child, Mabel Martha, who later became the wife of Talbot Frederick Rothwell. Lee's second marriage occurred on April 24, 1900, to Essie Mable Horton of Savannah, Georgia, and together, the couple had five daughters: Maude, Ethel, Maxine, Thelma, and Marjorie. Contrary to many previously published accounts, T. P. Lee had no sons. At age sixty-seven, Thomas Peter Lee died of a coronary occlusion on February 4, 1939, and he was buried at Glenwood Cemetery in Houston, two days later. Lee's former home, now referred to as the Link–Lee House, and its surrounding area, became the basis of the founding of the University of St. Thomas (Houston) which still occupies the site today. In particular, the house serves as the university's administration building. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and as a landmark of both the State of Texas and the City of Houston. Sources McKinley, Fred B., and Greg Riley.

There is a single stone rampart with a broad shallow outer ditch. There is also a prehistoric or Roman field system. Background Hill forts developed in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age, roughly the start of the first millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze, and as a result trading patterns shifted and the old elites lost their economic and social status. Power passed into the hands of a new group of people. Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated \\"[the forts] provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress [of an increasing population] burst out into open warfare. But I wouldn't see them as having been built because there was a state of war. They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed, but this was not the only, or even the most significant, factor in their construction\\".

Transport processes and separation process principles (2003), Fourth Edition, p. 475. That is because in a turbulent flow (in a pipe or in a boundary layer) the transport of momentum and the transport of heat largely depends on the same turbulent eddies: the velocity and the temperature profiles have the same shape. The _main assumption_ is that heat flux q/A in a turbulent system is analogous to momentum flux τ, which suggests that the ratio τ/(q/A) must be constant for all radial positions. The complete Reynolds analogy* is: \\\\frac{f}{2} = \\\\frac{h}{C_p\\\\times G} = \\\\frac{k'_c}{V_{av}} Experimental data for gas streams agree approximately with above equation if the Schmidt and Prandtl numbers are near 1.0 and only skin friction is present in flow past a flat plate or inside a pipe. When liquids are present and/or form drag is present, the analogy is conventionally known to be invalid. In 2008, the qualitative form of validity of Reynolds' analogy was re-visited for laminar flow of incompressible fluid with variable dynamic viscosity (μ).Mahulikar, S.P., & Herwig, H., 'Fluid friction in incompressible laminar convection: Reynolds' analogy revisited for variable fluid properties,' European Physical Journal B: Condensed Matter & Complex Systems, 62(1), (2008), pp. 77-86. It was shown that the inverse dependence of Reynolds number (Re) and skin friction coefficient(cf) is the basis for validity of the Reynolds’ analogy, in laminar convective flows with constant & variable μ. For μ = const. it reduces to the popular form of Stanton number (St) increasing with increasing Re, whereas for variable μ it reduces to St increasing with decreasing Re. Consequently, the Chilton-Colburn analogy of St•Pr2/3 increasing with increasing cf is qualitatively valid whenever the Reynolds’ analogy is valid. Further, the validity of the Reynolds’ analogy is linked to the applicability of Prigogine's Theorem of Minimum Entropy Production.Prigogine, I. Introduction to Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes (1961), Interscience Publishers, New York. Thus, Reynolds' analogy is valid for flows that are close to developed, for whom, changes in the gradients of field variables (velocity & temperature) along the flow are small.

With the retirement of Phil Simms and Lawrence Taylor—two of the most important figures in franchise history—after the 1993 season, the Giants entered a new era. After a successful 1993 season, the Giants struggled under head coach Dan Reeves, and failed to reach the playoffs for three consecutive seasons. With the hiring of Jim Fassel as the team's new head coach in 1997, the Giants fortunes improved and they made the playoffs several times. Led by free agent acquisition quarterback Kerry Collins, the Fassel era included an appearance in Super Bowl XXXV, where they lost to the Baltimore Ravens. Although there was success, the Fassel era was also marked by inconsistency, and he was fired after the 2003 season. Fassel was replaced by Tom Coughlin who served as head coach from 2004 to 2015. The Giants acquired quarterback Eli Manning via a draft day trade from the San Diego Chargers. Manning had been the quarterback at University of Mississippi, and was the first pick in the 2004 NFL Draft. During this period standout Giants players include defensive end Michael Strahan, who set the NFL single season record in sacks in 2001, and running back Tiki Barber, who set a team record in rushing yards in 2005. The Giants made the playoffs four consecutive seasons, from 2005–2008 (including a Super Bowl victory during the 2007 season), but missed the playoffs in 2009 and 2010. New era: 1994–1996 After finishing 11–5 and reaching the second round of the playoffs in 1993, the Giants took a step backwards in 1994. Phil Simms and Lawrence Taylor, the two biggest figures of the 1980s and early 1990s, both retired. Several other key starting players were dropped from the roster due to free agency. In the wake of Simms' retirement, head coach Dan Reeves named Dave Brown, who had been a No. 1 supplemental draft choice in 1992, as the Giants' new starting quarterback. Though Brown led the Giants to wins in their first three games of the season,1994 New York Giants , databasefootball.com, Retrieved March 20, 2007. the Giants lost their next 7 in a row to drop to 3–7.

Quarterback Dave Brown was particularly disappointing, as he finished with just 2,814 yards and 11 touchdowns on the season.

The Giants strength was their defense, which featured two Pro Bowlers in Armstead and Strahan.1998 New York Giants, pro-football-reference.com, Retrieved March 21, 2007. However, the offense continued to be a disappointment. Brown had been jettisoned and replaced by Kanell and Kent Graham. Neither quarterback provided Pro Bowl caliber play, although Graham led the Giants to a 5–1 finish (including an upset of the then-undefeated Denver Broncos in Week 15). Before the 1999 season the Giants signed quarterback Kerry Collins. Collins had been the first-ever draft choice of the expansion Carolina Panthers and in his second season led the Panthers to the NFC Championship game. However, problems with alcohol, conflicts with his teammates and questions about his character led to his release from the Panthers.King, Peter.

Receiver Amani Toomer had a breakout season, accumulating over 1,100 yards receiving and six touchdowns.1999 New York Giants , Retrieved March 18, 2007. Fellow receiver Ike Hilliard also had a solid season, finishing just shy of 1,000 yards receiving on the year. Tight end Pete Mitchell contributed 58 receptions, and Tiki Barber emerged as a premiere pass-catching running back, catching 66 passes on the year. The defense was also solid, ranking 11th in the league and sending Armstead and Strahan to the Pro Bowl again. Though the Giants stood at 7–6 after 13 games, they lost their final three games of the season to miss the playoffs for the second consecutive season. 2000: Super Bowl season The 2000 season was considered a make-or-break season for Fassel. Like his predecessor, Dan Reeves, Fassel had enjoyed great success in his first year, but disappointment in the following two seasons.

In the NFC Championship game faced the Minnesota Vikings, who were appearing in their second NFC Championship game in 3 seasons. Many people predicted that the Vikings and their high powered offense, led by Daunte Culpepper and receivers Randy Moss and Cris Carter would defeat the Giants and go on to the Super Bowl.

Kerry Collins continued to have success as the Giants' starting quarterback, throwing for over 3,700 yards and 19 TD's. Tiki Barber finished as the Giants leading rusher again, while tying Amani Toomer for the team lead with 72 receptions. But the standout player of the Giants 2001 season was Michael Strahan.

The team responded to win their final four games to finish the year 10–6, and secure a first-round playoff game against the NFC West champion San Francisco 49ers. The Giants controlled the 49ers throughout the game, and with four minutes left in the third quarter held a 38–14 lead, which would have been even larger had not Shockey dropped a touchdown pass in the third quarter.Associated Press. Garcia, 49ers erase 24-point deficit, espn.com, January 5, 2003, Retrieved March 22, 2007. The 49ers rallied however, scoring a field goal and three touchdowns—two on Jeff Garcia touchdown passes, one on a Garcia 14-yard touchdown run, and two two-point conversions made by Terrell Owens—which gave the 49ers a 39–38 lead with a minute to go. Collins then drove the Giants down to the 49ers 23-yard line with six seconds to play, setting up a 41-yard potential game-winning field goal attempt by Matt Bryant. However, Bryant never got an opportunity to make the kick. 40-year-old long snapper Trey Junkin—who had been signed out of retirement for this playoff game—snapped the ball low and punter Matt Allen could not spot the ball for the attempt. With no other options, Allen threw it downfield to offensive lineman Rich Seubert. The Giants were penalized for an illegal man downfield (Seubert, despite checking in as an eligible receiver before the play), and the game was over. However, after the game, the NFL recognized that San Francisco should have been penalized on that play as well for pass interference. This would have created offsetting penalties and given New York a chance to kick again. After the game a devastated Junkin said \\"I cost 58 guys a chance to go to the Super Bowl. I'd give anything in the world, except my family at this point, right now to still be retired.\\" The loss was Fassel's second devastating playoff loss in three postseason appearances; following the season, Payton was not retained as offensive coordinator.

Tom Coughlin era: 2004–2015=2004 NFL Draft and arrival of Eli Manning Coming out of Ole Miss in 2004 Eli Manning was the prized draft pick in that year's draft. After a brief search, Ernie Accorsi hired Tom Coughlin, a one-time assistant of former Giants' coach Bill Parcells, to be the Giants new head coach. Coughlin had been the inaugural head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars, and led them to the AFC Championship Game twice. He became the 16th head coach in franchise history.History of the New York Giants , giants.com/history, Retrieved May 24, 2007.

The Giants decided that their primary need was a franchise quarterback. Accorsi—who had coveted John Elway when he was Colts general manager in 1983—saw University of Mississippi quarterback Eli Manning as a similar talent. Manning's brother Peyton, and his father Archie, had already established successful careers as NFL quarterbacks. Though Accorsi wanted Manning, and Manning wanted to play in New York, Accorsi was unable to reach a deal to trade up to acquire him with the San Diego Chargers, who then used the first pick on Manning. Manning had indicated before the draft that he did not want to play for the Chargers, and appeared unhappy when selected by them.Magee, Jerry. Nothing personal, San Diego; Eli Manning just didn't want to be a Charger , The San Diego Union-Tribune, September 21, 2005, Retrieved March 21, 2007. After the pick was made, Chargers general manager AJ Smith called Accorsi to make a deal. Part of the deal was that the Giants would select quarterback Philip Rivers out of North Carolina State University with the fourth pick overall and trade that pick, plus other selections (including the Giants first round pick the following year), to the Chargers for Manning's rights and additional considerations. When the trade was announced, the crowd in attendance at the draft (which was held in New York) cheered.Zinser, Lynn.

However, they played better in narrow losses to the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Cincinnati Bengals. The Giants won their final game of the year against rival Dallas, to finish the season 6–10. Top performers on the season included Tiki Barber, who established a personal career high in rushing yardage with 1,518 yards, and also contributed 52 catches and 15 touchdowns.

This was the sixth consecutive season the Giants finished with at least a .500 regular season record (2005–2010), the team's longest stretch since the NFL-AFL merger. 2011: Super Bowl champions again As the Giants began 2011, many NFL analysts predicted that the Eagles were a favorite to win the NFC East title, while the Giants were not expected to make the playoffs. The Giants opened their regular season against the Redskins on September 11, 2011, and lost in Washington 28–14. The Giants then won three straight games, including breaking their six-game losing streak to the Eagles. By Week 9, the Giants were 6–2 after beating the Patriots in New England for their first encounter since Super Bowl XLII. At this point however, they entered a difficult stretch of games and lost four straight to a resurgent 49ers, followed by the Eagles, Saints, and Packers. By now, the Giants found their chances of beating the Cowboys to the division title fading and Tom Coughlin's coaching abilities were increasingly called into question despite reassurances from team president John Mara that there were no plans to fire him. However, the Giants kept their playoff hopes alive in Week 14 by beating the Cowboys in Dallas on a last-second scoring drive led by Eli Manning and extending their win streak in Cowboys Stadium to three straight games. Despite another loss to the Redskins afterwards, the Giants defeated the New York Jets in Week 16 by a final score of 29–14, also eliminating the Eagles from playoff contention, to set up a rematch with the Cowboys in which the winner would win the NFC East and the loser would be eliminated from playoff contention. The game was later flexed into Sunday Night Football. The Giants beat the Cowboys 31–14 to win the NFC East with a record of 9–7. Throughout the regular season, Eli Manning (always viewed as a weak quarterback compared to his brother) put up some of the best stats of his career. During the wild card round of the playoffs, the Giants hosted the Atlanta Falcons and won 24–2, with the Falcons' only score from a safety due to Eli Manning being flagged for grounding in the end zone. In the divisional round, the Giants were forced to play the defending champion Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field. The Packers had finished the regular season with a league-best 15–1 record, including a 38–35 win against the Giants in Week 13. In addition, the Packers received a first-round bye, and thus this was their first playoff match. Despite these obstacles, the Giants handily defeated the Packers 37–20 to qualify for the NFC Championship Game against the San Francisco 49ers. With the score tied, 17–17, in regulation, the Giants moved into field goal range in overtime and Lawrence Tynes, the hero of the 2007 postseason, kicked a 20-yard field goal to send them to Super Bowl XLVI, a rematch against the New England Patriots. =Super Bowl XLVI= Once again facing the New England Patriots, the New York Giants headed to Lucas Oil Stadium, home of Eli's brother Peyton's team, the Indianapolis Colts. The Giants got off to an early lead by an intentional grounding call on Tom Brady in the end zone for a safety and retaining the ball for most of the 1st quarter. However, the Patriots came back and battled to a 10–9 lead. Nearing the end of the 4th quarter with the Giants behind 17–15, Patriots coach Bill Belichick allowed them to score a touchdown with the idea that they would have nearly a minute to drive downfield and score. However, the Giants defense held and broke up several Brady pass attempts. A last-second throw into the end zone by Brady was thwarted and the Giants won their fourth Super Bowl 21–17. 2012–2015: Struggles Like 2011, the Giants began the 2012 season 6–2 and finished 9–7, matching their 2011 record. After splitting their first four games, they won four straight, including a 26–3 road win against the eventual NFC Champion San Francisco 49ers. However, a 3–5 stretch in the second half of the season, punctuated by a 17–16 loss to the Washington Redskins and a 33–14 loss to the eventual Super Bowl XLVII champion Baltimore Ravens, was not enough for the Giants to overcome, causing them to miss the playoffs, thus failing to repeat as Super Bowl champions.2012 New York Giants, footballreference.com, July 29, 2019. The Giants entered the 2013 season with hope they would play in Super Bowl XLVIII in their home stadium. However, the season began disastrously as the Giants lost their first six games of the season. Despite this, the Giants won their next four games, before losing to the Dallas Cowboys, 24–21. The Giants finished 7–9, their first losing season since 2004.2013 New York Giants, footballreference.com, July 29, 2019. The Giants started the 2014 season losing their first two games before winning three straight. However, a seven-game losing streak sealed their fate, as they regressed to a 6–10 record. Despite the disappointing season, rookie wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. won the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year Award.2014 New York Giants, footballreference.com, July 29, 2019. The Giants began the 2015 season in similar fashion. Their first two losses made them the first team in NFL history to lose their first two games despite leading by at least ten points. Despite their defensive struggles, they remained in the playoff race due to a weak division. But a poor November and December (in which the defense blew several late leads) caused the Giants to finish at 6–10.2015 New York Giants, footballreference.com, July 29, 2019. Ben McAdoo era: 2016–2017 After several disappointing seasons, Coughlin retired after the end of the 2015 season as head coach. Ben McAdoo was named his successor. McAdoo brought the Giants to an 11–5 record and their first playoff berth since 2011 with a much improved defense (despite a mediocre offense). He was the first Giants head coach since Jim Fassel in 1997 to bring them to the playoffs in his first year as head coach. On December 11, 2016, during a Sunday Night Football game against the Dallas Cowboys, McAdoo was fined $200,000 for illegally using a walkie talkie on the field. Despite the regular season success, the Giants were defeated in the wild card round by the Green Bay Packers. Despite an offseason filled with optimism, the 2017 season would prove much more challenging. An inept offense and under-performing defense, paired with season ending injuries to star wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. and offseason acquisition Brandon Marshall, resulted in a 1–5 start. On November 5, 2017, the Giants suffered their largest home loss since 1998 in a 51–17 loss to the Los Angeles Rams. Disciplinary issues followed as mid-season suspensions were handed out to defensive stars Janoris Jenkins and Dominique Rogers-Cromartie. There was also speculation cornerback Eli Apple, the 10th overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft, contemplated leaving the teamhttps://nypost.com/2017/11/25/eli-apples-attitude-towards-criticism-led-to-near-walk-out/ after an especially critical film session led by McAdoo. The turbulent 2017 season came to a head for McAdoo when on November 28 he announced the team would be benching Eli Manning in favor of the much maligned Geno Smith. Manning's benching snapped his streak of 210 consecutive starts, the longest active streak in the NFL at the time, and the second longest in NFL history to only Brett Favre's 297. Fan and media reaction to the announcement was decidedly negative, with several fans and media personnel coming to Eli's defense despite the team's struggles on offense. Geno Smith would go on to start for the team in their week 13 loss to the Oakland Raiders, bringing their record to 2–10. The following day, the Giants fired Ben McAdoo and general manager Jerry Reese. McAdoo was the first Giants head coach to be fired during a season since Bill Arnsparger in 1976, and also became the first head coach to not last two full seasons with the team since Earl Potteiger in 1928. Defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo was named interim head coach, and Eli Manning was reinstated as starting quarterback for the remainder of the season. The Giants would proceed to finish the season 1–3 for a final record of 3–13. The record was the worst that the Giants posted since the league expanded to a 16-game regular season in 1978. Before the final game of the season against the Washington Redskins, the Giants formally announced the hiring of Dave Gettleman as their next general manager. Pat Shurmur era: 2018–2019 On January 22, 2018, the Giants announced the hiring of Pat Shurmur as their next head coach. Shurmur had previously been the offensive coordinator for the Minnesota Vikings, offensive coordinator and interim head coach for the Philadelphia Eagles, and head coach of the Cleveland Browns. The Giants selected running back Saquon Barkley out of Penn State with their first round draft pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, the highest that the Giants had selected in the draft since 1981. The Giants aggressively turned over their roster from the 2017 season, with only 13 out of the 53 players from the previous season's final game making the initial roster for the 2018 season. Despite these changes, the Giants only marginally improved in their first season under Shurmur, finishing last in the NFC East for a second year in a row with a 5–11 record. In the 2019 NFL Draft The Giants selected Eli Manning successor Daniel Jones. On December 30, 2019, the Giants fired head coach Pat Shurmur.

It was destroyed by the Persians in 480 BC, during the Destruction of Athens. It was located at the center of the Acropolis plateau, probably on the remains of a Mycenaean palace. The complex is sometimes described by the name \\"Dörpfeld foundations\\", after the archaeologist who found the location of the temple. It was referred to as \\"Archaios Neos\\" (Old Temple) by the Greeks.  Description = Temple Plan  Foundations of the Old Temple of Athena, in front of the Erechtheion. It was destroyed by the armies of Xerxes I during the Achaemenid destruction of Athens, in 480-479 BC. Foundations of the Old Temple of Athena. Old Temple of Athena (restored). Floor plan of Old Temple Of Athena. Location of Old Temple Athena is #2. The foundations suggest the following basic description: the temple measured 21.3 by 43.15 m. It was surrounded by a peristasis of 6 by 12 columns. The difference between column axes was 4.04 m, narrowed by 0.31 m at the corners. The Stylobate was slightly curved, whether this also applied to the superstructure remains unclear. In both the pronaos and opisthodomos, two columns stood between short antae. The main building had two inner sanctums, the east cella and the west cella, which was very short, in fact nearly square, and subdivided into three aisles by two rows of three columns each. It was followed by a pair of side-by-side rooms. The foundations were composed of various materials and constructed in varying techniques. While the load-bearing parts and internal supports were made of blue Acropolis limestone, the foundations of the surrounding peristasis were of Poros limestone. The superstructure and decorative pieces also appear to have been made from a variety of materials, including Poros and Parian marble.  Sculpture  Pediments = The old temple of Athena had two Poros pediments, around 15 m. in length. The surviving pediment depicts Gigantomachy, the struggle between Gods and Giants, eventually won by the Gods. The central figure depicts the goddess Athena wearing an aegis covered with scales and edged by snakes obtained from a monster she previously defeated. She is thought to hit a falling Giant, whose foot is the only remain. Scholars believe that this pediment originally contained a frontal chariot in the center with four horses and Zeus inside one of the chariot, pointing an arrow in the direction of Athena. This images also shows Athena holding a snake and reaching out to a giant. Another figure features a lying giant, whereas two side figures, one was positioned at the corners of the pediment, depict two more falling giants. Other remains ascribed to the temple include an entablature and sima of Parian marble and Poros limestone, capitals with a steep echinus, a marble sculpture depicting a procession, and marble waterspouts in each of the four corners, shaped like lions' and rams' heads. =Xoanon= The main building of the temple had two parts, one of the spaces in the east Cella contained the ancient Xoanon or wooden statue of Athena, believed to have fallen from the sky, or from Zeus. The statue was probably taken to the Athenian fleet ('the wooden wall') and was therefore not destroyed when the Persians destroyed the old Temple of Athena Polias in 480 BC. It was eventually housed in the new temple of Athena Polias - the Erechtheion. The Xoanon statue was made out of olive-wood.

Excavation and Reconstruction = Wilhelm Dörpfeld  Architectural remains of the Old Athena Temple built into the north wall of the Acropolis by Themistocles, circa 478 BC. Remains of the Old Temple of Athena built into the northern wall of the Acropolis by Themistocles, circa 478 BC. Wilhelm Dörpfeld went to Athens in 1885 to look at the ruins of the Temple of Athena where he noticed some ruins were still standing and looked as though the architecture was the temple of Athena Polias. Wilhelm saw a piece of a building that looked like a piece of the Erechtheiom temple, which was in the same location another archaeologist named Ross excavated in 1834. Once Wilhelm saw the same ruins he cleared in 1834, Wilhelm went towards the ruins to examine and he immediately confirmed it was the old temple of Athena. Wilhelm Dörpfeld assumed that the original structure was a double temple in antis, dating to about 570 BC, lengthened and broadened by the addition of the peristasis under Peisistratus, between 529 and 520 BC.Wilhelm Dörpfeld: Der alte Athenatempel auf der Akropolis.

Vol. 51, 1947, p. 109–51. This idea led to a subdivision of the foundations into an inner smaller structure known as H-Architektur and assumed to be the oldest part of the building, followed by a structure still described as the \\"Old Temple of Athena\\", including the inner H-Architektur as well as the external peristasis.  Other scholars  The foundations of the Old Temple, visible in front of the Erechtheion The reconstruction of the temple's architectural history has remained controversial until recently. More recently, scholars have attributed the older remains, initially attributed to the inner H-Architektur, to the close Hekatompedon temple, dating the temple of Athena Polias to the last third of the 6th century BC and identifying its dimensions with the entirety of the foundations excavated by Dörpfeld.Manolis Korres: Die Athena-Tempel auf der Akropolis.

Internationales Symposion vom 7. bis 9. Juli 1995 in Berlin. Berlin 1997, p. 218–43 There are many speculations that the old temple of Athena was rebuilt by the Athenians once they took over Athens again. Frazer and Michaelis believe that the temple was not the old temple of Athena but, a new temple in the same location where the Erechtheion stood. There were other scholars that did not agree with Dörpfeld's suggestion that the old temple of Athena was rebuilt and that the building was destroyed. Bates believes that Dörpfeld is correct with his discovery of the architecture and that it was indeed rebuilt. Ferrari mentions that Bates took Dörpfeld's side on his excavation for lost treasure in the old temple of Athena, but the temple was not built right away as Dörpfeld thought it was. Pericles (495-429 B.C.) who was a general and a politician to Athens citizens was the one who convinced the Athenian people to rebuild the Temples of Athena. He suggested to the Athenians not to have the location be a pile of rubble where the temple once stood because that could offend the gods. It remains controversial whether a partial restoration of the temple followed the Persian sack of 480 BC. HerodotusHerodotus 5, 77. mentions a west-facing Megaron on the Acropolis. This reference, as well as a structure listed in an inscription,Inscriptiones Graecae I² 91/92. has been interpreted as evidence that the Opisthodomus of the Old Temple remained in place through the fifth century. XenophonXenophon, Hellenika 1, 6, 1. states that the Old Temple of Athena burned down in 406/405 BC, but this might also refer to the Erechtheion, which had taken over the functions of the Old Temple and housed the Xoanon. From the 4th century BC onwards, there are no possible references to the Old Temple; Pausanias was not aware of its existence.

(retrieved 16 Aug 2010) Art career Ocampo frequently revisits and makes reference to the art historical canon of political allegorists including Leon Golub, Géricault, Goya, Daumier with allusions to contemporary figures including political satirist R. Crumb Modernist painter Philip Guston. Ocampo's dark, often disturbing Gothic paintings are attributed with transforming horror into exquisite beauty, history into art history, purgatory into salvation. One of his pieces featuring several swastikas was censored at the Dokumenta art show in Kassel, Germany. Manuel Ocampo has exhibited extensively throughout the 1990s, with solo exhibitions at galleries and institutions through Europe, Asia, and the Americas. In 2005, his work was the subject of a large-scale survey at Casa Asia in Barcelona, and Lieu d’Art Contemporain, Sigean, France. Ocampo's work has been included in a number of international surveys, including the 2004 Seville Biennale, 2001 Venice Biennale, the 2001 Berlin Biennale, the 2000 Biennale d’art Contemporain de Lyon, the 1997 Kwangju Biennial, the 1993 Corcoran Biennial, and 1992's controversial Documenta IX.

(1991). It is important to note that Manuel Ocampo used to make art that criticized western colonialism through allegory and metaphor. Today, his work displays simple imagery; the artist has said of his 1990s work, \\"I was bored with that shit\\".

The home is one of the first in the township of Khayelitsha, one of the largest in South Africa. The founder of Baphumelele, Rosie Mashale, is a trained primary school teacher. She has been selected as a Mama AfrikaMama Afrika by Clover. She has also been selected as a finalist in the Cape Times V&A; Waterfront Woman of Worth Awards.Woman of Worth Awards History Set in the crime ridden township of Khayelitsha, inhabited by around one million people and located 30 km southeast of downtown Cape Town, Baphumelele grew out of one of the most destitute shack settlements in South Africa. In 1989 Rosalie Mashale moved from the Eastern Cape to Khayelitsha. She was extremely disturbed to see young children going through garbage dumps and looking for food without any supervision while their parents were away at work. One day, when an abandoned baby was left on her doorstep, Rosie took him in and tried to find him a new home. Soon, her reputation in the community grew as someone who had too much heart to turn a needy child away. As more and more children were dropped at her doorstep, she took this as a sign from God that forming a Children's Home was to be her work on Earth. Through hard work, determination and the help of the community, Baphumelele has rapidly grown into a Children's Home, a daycare centre for over 230 children, a Respite Centre of adults with HIV/AIDS and TB, a children's Respite Centre, outreach projects helping child headed homes and people needing home-based care, as well as a new residential project called the Fountain of Hope for youth transitioning from children's homes. The Baphumelele community provides food, healthcare, education and a refuge from the surrounding violence to orphaned and vulnerable children from all over Cape Town. Employing more than 150 permanent staff, it has part-time medical team including doctor and two nurses, and provides services to over 250 preschool-aged children. Fountain of Hope The Fountain of Hope program is intended for young people aged 18–21 who have been raised in residential care, or who have recently been orphaned or are in a vulnerable situation. The program provides a platform for the youth to learn the necessary skills to contribute to society economically and socially and to allow those still in high school to finish their education. Located on around a hectare of farmland on Schaapkraal Road in the Philippi Horticultural area, on the Cape Flats, the farm can accommodate up to 18 youth, both males and females. The small-scale operational farm acts as a training ground for the youth, as well as providing employment to the local community and providing a small return through the sale of the produce. The program lasts for 12 months.

It is a part of the White Mountain National Forest. It is New Hampshire's largest wilderness area. The Wilderness Area consists of the upper watershed of the East Branch of the Pemigewasset River, and includes the Franconia, Twin, Zealand, and Hancock mountain ranges, but excludes the summits of the ranges and the trail along them. As a result of the region's rugged character, the Pemigewasset Wilderness is a popular recreation area; its large trail network receives heavy use, in the form of hiking, cross-country skiing, and others, throughout the year. The area is also noted for its ecological recovery from the logging era of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. After years of unchecked clear- cutting, during which the zone had the largest logging railroad system in the White Mountains, the area's inclusion in the White Mountain National Forest and later designation as a Wilderness Area has led to a substantial rebound in the forest ecosystem. Geography The Pemigewasset Wilderness consists of two horseshoe-shaped \\"lobes\\" characterized by relatively low, wet river valleys surrounded by high mountain ridges.Daniell, Gene, and Smith, Steven D. White Mountain Guide. 27th ed. AMC Books, 2003. . 150 Western lobe Mount Lincoln, a peak on Franconia Ridge, the western edge of the Pemigewasset Wilderness, as seen from Little Haystack Mountain The western lobe is enclosed by the Franconia, Twin, and Bond ranges, though the top of the ridge defining the ranges is outside the Wilderness boundary. Moving clockwise from the south near the Lincoln Woods trailhead, the ridge ascends Potash Knob (2684 ft/818 m), an unnamed peak (3060 ft/933 m), and Whaleback Mountain (2586 ft/1093 m) before reaching Franconia Ridge itself at the ledgy summit of Mount Flume (4328 ft/1319 m).USGS 7.5 Minute Topographic Map Series: Franconia, Lincoln, Crawford Notch, Mount Osceola, Mount Carrigain, South Twin Mountain Quadrangles From Mount Flume, the ridge dips and rises between peaks in a parabolic manner, flirting with treeline in the cols and running open and exposed at the summits. Peaks crossed at this point of the ridge after Flume include Mount Liberty (4459 ft/1359 m), and Little Haystack Mountain (4780 ft/1457 m), where the ridge rises out of the scrub for good. As it heads north, the ridge assumes a \\"knife-edge\\" character, dropping off dramatically on both sides as it crosses Mount Lincoln (5089 ft/1551 m) before reaching its high point at the summit of Mount Lafayette (5249 ft/1600 m). The East Branch of the Pemigewasset River drains the Pemigewasset Wilderness and provides its name. From the summit of Lafayette, the ridge, thence known as Garfield Ridge, makes its way toward the Twin Range. It passes over a small subsidiary peak of Lafayette before descending abruptly into the scrub below timberline; after several small knobs, the summits of Garfield (4500 ft/1372 m) and Galehead (4024 ft/1227 m) mountains are crossed, and the ridge breaks into the open and begins a steep climb to the summit of South Twin Mountain (4902 ft/1494 m).Daniell and Smith 167 As a spur ridge extends north to North Twin Mountain (4761 ft/1451 m), the main ridge makes a southward turn and runs in the open to the summit of Mount Guyot (4580 ft/1396 m).Daniell and Smith 173 Enclosing the western lobe, the Bond Range extends south from Guyot, passing over Mount Bond (4698 ft/1432 m) and Bondcliff (4265 ft/1300 m) before descending sharply into the woods to the East Branch of the Pemigewasset.Daniell and Smith 196-197 In the center of the western lobe is the long, broad ridge of Owl's Head (4025 ft/1227 m), which rises abruptly from the valley of Lincoln Brook and extends north for roughly 3 miles (4.8 km) to a low saddle connecting it to Garfield Ridge. Almost completely encircling Owl's Head are two tributaries of the East Branch, Lincoln Brook and Franconia Branch; Lincoln Brook drains the east face of Franconia Ridge, while Franconia Branch drains the southern and western faces of the Twin and Bond Ranges through Twin, Redrock, and Hellgate Brooks. Eastern lobe The eastern lobe of the Pemigewasset Wilderness follows fewer well-defined topographic features than the western lobe. The \\"boundary wall\\" formed in the west by the Franconia, Twin, and Bond Range is present in the eastern lobe to a degree, but is less obvious. From Mount Guyot, the eastern lobe's main ridge continues east rather than following the Bond Range to the south. Passing over Zealand Mountain (4260 ft/1298 m) and a small knob known as Zeacliff Pond Peak (4060 ft/1237 m), the ridge reaches an abrupt end at Zeacliff, a dramatic overlook into Zealand Notch.Smith, Steven D., and Mike Dickerman. The 4000 Footers of the White Mountains. Littleton, NH: Bondcliff Books, 2001. 134-135 From Zeacliff, the Wilderness Boundary plunges into the notch following the Twinway trail, and follows the Ethan Pond Trail into the flatter sections of the lobe. After a few miles, the boundary picks up the ridge of Mount Lowell, and runs over Mount Nancy (3926 ft/1197 m), Mount Anderson (3740 ft/1140 m), and near the summit of Lowell itself (3740 ft/1140 m) before crossing Carrigain Notch and rising to Vose Spur (3862 ft/1177 m) and the summit of Mount Carrigain (4700 ft/1433 m).Daniell and Smith 206-207 Confined to a more obvious ridge at this point, the boundary passes over The Captain (3540 ft/1079 m) and the main summit of Mount Hancock (4420 ft/1347 m) before descending to the East Branch across from Bondcliff via Mount Hitchcock (3620 ft/1103 m) and its several small knobs. Note that the boundary as implemented excludes the Appalachian Trail and the summits it passes over as well as Mount Carrigain. The East Branch of the Pemigewasset drains the eastern lobe through a number of small streams. Mounts Hancock and Carrigain are drained by Crystal, Carrigain, and Notch Brooks, while the center drains to the North Fork of the Pemigewasset and Shoal Pond Brook. Geology While most of the White Mountains consist of highly metamorphicized schists and gneisses formed during the Acadian Orogeny, the Pemigewasset Wilderness is part of the White Mountain Batholith and is therefore composed primarily of the igneous White Mountain plutonic- volcanic rock series.Billings, Marland P. The Geology of New Hampshire: Part II-Bedrock Geology. Concord, New Hampshire: The New Hampshire State Planning and Development Commission, 1980. 69-88. The Franconia and Twin Ranges form a massive ring dike in the western half of the White Mountain Batholith made up of a granite porphyry backbone that emerged roughly 170 million years ago.\\"Geographic Marvels of the Northeast.\\" AMC Outdoors. Sept. 2006. AMC. 25 Mar. 2007 . This rock appears pink, red, green or grey, with medium-sized phenocrysts. Such phenocrysts, usually quartz or feldspar, make up 20%-40% of the rock, and are embedded in a groundmass of similar composition.

The CAC is a non-collecting museum that focuses on new developments in painting, sculpture, photography, architecture, performance art and new media. Focusing on programming that reflects \\"the art of the last five minutes,\\"Ohio Traveler Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Museum Center the CAC has displayed the works of many now-famous artists early in their careers, including Andy Warhol. In 2003, the CAC moved to a new building designed by the late Zaha Hadid.  History  The Contemporary Arts Center was founded as the Modern Art Society in 1939 by Betty Pollak Rauh, Peggy Frank Crawford and Rita Rentschler Cushman. These three women were able to raise enough money through donations to display modern art at the Cincinnati Art Museum. Early advice and encouragement was offered by both Edward M.M. Warburg, a friend of the Pollak family, as well as Alfred H. Barr. The society's very first exhibit, Modern Painting from Cincinnati Collections, opened in December of the same year. In 1954 the Modern Art Society adopted its current name, the Contemporary Arts Center. The name change coincided with the creation of two permanent galleries that were remodeled from part of the museum's lower level. These two spaces, designed by Carl Strauss and Ray Roush, consisted of about each and featured movable wooden wall covers. Many local Cincinnati collections were shown in this space, including works now kept at the Cincinnati Art Museum from the Mary E. Johnston collection. Construction on the Emery Wing at the Cincinnati Art Museum replaced the original space of the CAC. As a result of the museum’s need to expand, the center moved out in 1962 and temporarily inhabited various locations at the Taft Museum of Art, space at 608 Main Street, and the Carew Tower. In 1964 the center occupied the fourth floor of the Women’s Exchange building at 113 West Fourth street where it remained for six years. After two years on Fourth street the center announced that it had plans to move to the Mercantile Center on Fifth street, which opened in 1970. The new building cost $400,000 and was designed by Harry Weese. The CAC’s space covered about and overlooked the new bus terminal in downtown Cincinnati. Despite early financial troubles in 1971, the CAC was able to put on over 400 exhibitions during its 30-year stay on Government Square. A permanent lease for the location was acquired in 1982 through a city bond. Early proposals for a new home began at the end of the 1980s and included possible locations at the Ohio Mechanics Institute (currently the Emery Center) and the Aronoff Center. Later, as the idea of constructing an entirely new building became possible, the CAC focused on the site at Sixth and Walnut. By 1997 the center’s Architectural Selection Committee was publicly seeking architects to design the CAC's first-free standing building . The search narrowed 97 statements of qualification to twelve semi finalists: Coop Himmelblau, Diller & Scofidio, Herzog & de Meuron, Steven Holl, Rem Koolhaas, Eric Owen Moss, Jean Nouvel, Toyo Ito, Antoine Predock, Zaha Hadid, Daniel Liebeskind and Bernard Tschumi. One year later the board granted the commission to Zaha Hadid. Construction began in 2001 and the new building opened on May 31, 2003. Projects and exhibitions In March 2008, the Contemporary Arts Center announced the exhibition and auction \\"FORM: Contemporary Architects at Play\\". Participating architects included: * Peter Eisenman, Eisenman Architects * Michael Graves, Graves Design * Zaha Hadid, Zaha Hadid Architects * Thom Mayne, Morphosis * Bill Pedersen, Kohn Pedersen Fox * Laurinda Spear, Arquitectonica * Bernard Tschumi, Bernard Tschumi Architects * Jaime Velez, Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, LLP * Massimo Vignelli, Vignelli Designs, Inc. * Buzz Yudell, Moore Ruble Yudell Architects and Planners Christie's Fine Arts Division sold eight pieces and one concept at auction raising $425,000. In March 2011 the Laminex Group brought the collection to New Zealand for the Auckland Arts Festival and invited New Zealand architects and design professionals to submit entries for a New Zealand collection. The domestic competition was entitled \\"Formica Formations\\". Queenstown designer Graham Roebeck of Structural Integrity Ltd won the Professional category and Auckland Unitec student Norman Lin, the emerging designer category.  Controversies  In 1990, a Cincinnati jury acquitted the Contemporary Arts Center and its director, Dennis Barrie, of obscenity charges stemming from an exhibition of photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe. In the first criminal trial of an art museum over the contents of an exhibition, the case centered on seven out of 175 photographs in an exhibition (The Perfect Moment) that traveled from Berkeley to Boston; five of the seven photographs depicted men in sadomasochistic poses and were the basis of charges that the museum and its director had pandered obscenity. Much of the dispute over the Mapplethorpe photographs centered on whether federal money should be used to finance them, through the National Endowment for the Arts.Isabel Wilkerson (October 6, 1990), Cincinnati Jury Acquits Museum In Mapplethorpe Obscenity Case The New York Times. If convicted, the center would have faced fines of up to $10,000; Barrie could have faced a year in jail and fines up to $2,000. The trial was chronicled in the 2000 television movie Dirty Pictures. Location 44 East 6th Street (Corner of 6th & Walnut), Cincinnati, OH 45202 Across Walnut Street from the Aronoff Center for the Arts in downtown Cincinnati's cultural and entertainment area known as the Backstage District. Architecture In 2003, the CAC moved to its first free- standing home which was designed by Zaha Hadid. The CAC chose to honor two of its major donors by naming the building the Lois and Richard Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art. The Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art was Zaha Hadid's first American project. Hailed by The New York Times architecture critic Herbert Muschamp as \\"the most important American building to be completed since the cold war,\\" the project was the brainchild of Director Charles Desmarais. (Desmarais left the CAC for the Brooklyn Museum in early 2005.) The building's footprint is , with a total area of on seven floors. The project cost $34 million, with design features including \\"Urban Carpet\\", \\"Jigsaw Puzzle\\", and \\"Skin/Sculpture\\".

Chechen militant losses In May 2000, Chechen rebels reported on their website that they have lost 1,380 men since fighting started with Russia in the breakaway republic. On the Russian side, military officials said they had lost 2,004 soldiers.Chechnya: Rebels Give Count Of Losses, RFE/RL, 25 May 2000 In September 2000, the Prague Watchdog compiled the widely conflicting list of casualties and enemy losses officially announced by both sides in the first year of the conflict. Civilian casualties The Chechen separatist sources in 2003 cited figures of some 250,000 civilians, and up to 50,000 Russian servicemen, killed during the 1994-2003 period. The rebel side also acknowledged about 5,000 separatist combatants killed as of 1999-2004, mostly in the initial phases of the war. In November 2004, the chairman of Chechnya's pro-Moscow State Council, Taus Djabrailov, said over 200,000 people have been killed in the Chechen Republic since 1994, including over 20,000 children. In August 2005, Djabrailov gave a conflicting figure of 160,000 killed, mostly Russians.Death Toll Put at 160,000 in Chechnya, The Moscow Times, August 16, 2005 In June 2005, Dukvakha Abdurakhmanov, a deputy prime minister in the Kremlin-controlled Chechen administration, said about 300,000 people have been killed during two wars in Chechnya over the past decade; he also said that more than 200,000 people have gone missing. Every resident of Chechnya has scores of relatives who have been killed or gone missing, he said. In September 2006, Anatoly Kulikov, deputy chairman of the Russian State Duma committee on security said that In the 12 years of our Russian antiterrorist war in the Chechen Republic, aggregate losses among the federal forces, illegal armed groups and civilians are estimated at about 45,000 people. In November 2006, self-exiled separatist leader Akhmed Zakayev said that \\"Putin has already killed more than 250,000 innocent Chechens\\".Chechen leader says spy 'died a hero' , lifestyleextra.com, November 27, 2006 Independent estimates In 2000, the Russian weekly Nezavisimoye Voyennoye Obozreniye (Independent Military Review) compiled an incomplete list of 1,176 military servicemen fallen in Chechnya during the first year of conflict. If available the list included name, year and place of birth, rank and military unit, place, date and cause of death.Список военнослужащих, погибших в Дагестане и Чечне начиная с августа 1999 года, Nezavisimoye Voyennoye Obozreniye, 2000-08-11 For the period from 1994 to 2003, estimates ranged from 50,000 to 250,000 civilians and 10,000 to 50,000 Russian servicemen killed. Given that almost certainly both sides have tended to exaggerate enemy military casualties while minimizing their own and grossly underestimating its responsibility for civilian losses, the Russian-Chechen Friendship Society set the conservative estimate of death toll in this time period at about 150,000 - 200,000 civilians, 20,000 to 40,000 Russian soldiers, and possibly the same number of Chechen rebels.Civil and military casualties of the wars in Chechnya Russian-Chechen Friendship Society, 2003 In February 2003, the Union of the Committees of Soldiers' Mothers of Russia, estimated that some 11,000 servicemen have been killed, with another 25,000 wounded, since 1999. It also estimated the civilian death toll at about 20,000 people.Russia Weekly Center for Defense Information, February 20, 2003 Their estimate for the earlier Chechen war was 14,000 dead troops as compared with the official figure of 5,500. According to 2003 Military Balance, the annual report International Institute for Strategic Studies, the British-based think tank, Russian forces suffered 4,749 dead, wounded or missing in hostile and non-hostile incidents in Chechnya between August 2002 and August 2003.CHECHNYA: Independence, Islam and Bloodshed, Deutsche Welle In 2004, Denis Trifonov of the British strategic-research centre Jane's Information Group estimated that the federal forces in Chechnya suffered some 9,000 to 11,000 combat deaths during the second war's most intense phase, from its beginning in late summer 1999 to early 2002. In 2003, they lost roughly 3,000 dead.RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES SAID TO BE UNDERREPORTING COMBAT DEATHS, The Jamestown Foundation, February 25, 2004 In 2004, the human rights group Memorial estimated the number of civilian casualties of both wars at \\"more than 200,000\\" and the number of Russian soldiers killed at 20,000 to 40,000 In 2006, Alexander Cherkasov of the human rights group Memorial pointed out that the Russian government did not make any attempt to count civilian casualties in the war of 1994-96, nor after 1999. Many figures have been quoted, some greatly exaggerated; a figure of 250,000 [civilian] dead in the two wars is sometimes repeated, but without there being adequate substantiation of such a number, Cherkasov said, and concluded: The total number of peaceful residents of the Chechen Republic who perished during the two wars may have reached 70,000. (...) [In the second war] the total number of civilians killed, including those who disappeared, adds up to between 14,800 to 24,100. However, he admitted that the accuracy of his estimates was not high. In 2007, Memorial estimated about 15,000 Russian soldiers have died in total, while others estimated up to 40,000.FIGHT FOR INDEPENDENCE FROM RUSSIA, Reuters, 11-04-2007 According to Amnesty International in 2007 the second war has killed up to 25,000 civilians since 1999 (many in the first months of the conflict), while up to another 5,000 people are missing. \\"Many thousands\\" of people are believed to be buried in unmarked graves.Amnesty International Issues Reports on Disappearances , The Jamestown Foundation, May 24, 2007What justice for Chechnya's disappeared? .

Liu, A. Weinstein, and P. Xu: Manin triples for Lie Bialgebroids, Journ. of Diff.geom. 45 pp.647–574 (1997). Liu, Weinstein and Xu named it after Courant, who had implicitly devised earlier in 1990T.J. Courant: Dirac Manifolds, Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, vol. 319, pp.631–661 (1990). the standard prototype of Courant algebroid through his discovery of a skew symmetric bracket on TM\\\\oplus T^*M, called Courant bracket today, which fails to satisfy the Jacobi identity. Both this standard example and the double of a Lie bialgebra are special instances of Courant algebroids. Definition A Courant algebroid consists of the data a vector bundle E\\\\to M with a bracket [.,.]:\\\\Gamma E \\\\times \\\\Gamma E \\\\to \\\\Gamma E, a non degenerate fiber-wise inner product \\\\langle.,.\\\\rangle: E\\\\times E\\\\to M\\\\times\\\\R, and a bundle map \\\\rho:E\\\\to TM subject to the following axioms, :[\\\\phi, [\\\\chi, \\\\psi = \\\\phi, \\\\chi], \\\\psi] + [\\\\chi, [\\\\phi, \\\\psi :[\\\\phi, f\\\\psi] = \\\\rho(\\\\phi)f\\\\psi +f[\\\\phi, \\\\psi] :[\\\\phi,\\\\phi]= \\\\tfrac12 D\\\\langle \\\\phi,\\\\phi\\\\rangle :\\\\rho(\\\\phi)\\\\langle \\\\psi,\\\\psi\\\\rangle= 2\\\\langle [\\\\phi,\\\\psi],\\\\psi\\\\rangle where φ,ψ,χ are sections of E and f is a smooth function on the base manifold M. D is the combination \\\\kappa^{-1}\\\\rho^T d with d the de Rham differential, \\\\rho^T the dual map of \\\\rho, and κ the map from E to E^* induced by the inner product. Skew- Symmetric Definition An alternative definition can be given to make the bracket skew-symmetric as : \\\\phi,\\\\psi= \\\\tfrac12\\\\big([\\\\phi,\\\\psi]-[\\\\psi,\\\\phi]\\\\big.) This no longer satisfies the Jacobi-identity axiom above. It instead fulfills a homotopic Jacobi-identity. : \\\\phi,\\\\psi,\\\\chi\\\\, +\\\\text{cycl.} = DT(\\\\phi,\\\\psi,\\\\chi) where T is : T(\\\\phi,\\\\psi,\\\\chi)=\\\\frac13\\\\langle [\\\\phi,\\\\psi],\\\\chi\\\\rangle +\\\\text{cycl.} The Leibniz rule and the invariance of the scalar product become modified by the relation \\\\phi,\\\\psi = [\\\\phi,\\\\psi] -\\\\tfrac12 D\\\\langle \\\\phi,\\\\psi\\\\rangle and the violation of skew-symmetry gets replaced by the axiom :: \\\\rho\\\\circ D = 0 The skew-symmetric bracket together with the derivation D and the Jacobiator T form a strongly homotopic Lie algebra. Properties The bracket is not skew- symmetric as one can see from the third axiom. Instead it fulfills a certain Jacobi-identity (first axiom) and a Leibniz rule (second axiom). From these two axioms one can derive that the anchor map ρ is a morphism of brackets: :: \\\\rho[\\\\phi,\\\\psi] = [\\\\rho(\\\\phi),\\\\rho(\\\\psi)] . The fourth rule is an invariance of the inner product under the bracket. Polarization leads to :: \\\\rho(\\\\phi)\\\\langle \\\\chi,\\\\psi\\\\rangle= \\\\langle [\\\\phi,\\\\chi],\\\\psi\\\\rangle +\\\\langle \\\\chi,[\\\\phi,\\\\psi]\\\\rangle . Examples An example of the Courant algebroid is the Dorfman bracketI.Y. Dorfman: Dirac structures of integrable evolution equations, Physics Letters A, vol.125, pp.240–246 (1987). on the direct sum TM\\\\oplus T^*M with a twist introduced by Ševera,P. Ševera: Letters to A. Weinstein, unpublished. (1998) defined as: :: [X+\\\\xi, Y+\\\\eta] = [X,Y]+(\\\\mathcal{L}_X\\\\,\\\\eta -i(Y) d\\\\xi +i(X)i(Y)H) where X,Y are vector fields, ξ,η are 1-forms and H is a closed 3-form twisting the bracket. This bracket is used to describe the integrability of generalized complex structures. A more general example arises from a Lie algebroid A whose induced differential on A^* will be written as d again. Then use the same formula as for the Dorfman bracket with H an A-3-form closed under d. Another example of a Courant algebroid is a quadratic Lie algebra, i.e. a Lie algebra with an invariant scalar product. Here the base manifold is just a point and thus the anchor map (and D) are trivial. The example described in the paper by Weinstein et al. comes from a Lie bialgebroid, i.e. A a Lie algebroid (with anchor \\\\rho_A and bracket [.,.]_A), also its dual A^* a Lie algebroid (inducing the differential d_{A^*} on \\\\wedge^* A) and d_{A^*}[X,Y]_A=[d_{A^*}X,Y]_A+[X,d_{A^*}Y]_A (where on the RHS you extend the A-bracket to \\\\wedge^*A using graded Leibniz rule). This notion is symmetric in A and A^* (see Roytenberg). Here E=A\\\\oplus A^* with anchor \\\\rho(X+\\\\alpha)=\\\\rho_A(X)+\\\\rho_{A^*}(\\\\alpha) and the bracket is the skew-symmetrization of the above in X and α (equivalently in Y and β): :[X+\\\\alpha,Y+\\\\beta]= ([X,Y]_A +\\\\mathcal{L}^{A^*}_{\\\\alpha}Y-i_\\\\beta d_{A^*}X) +([\\\\alpha,\\\\beta]_{A^*} +\\\\mathcal{L}^A_X\\\\beta-i_Yd_{A}\\\\alpha)  Dirac structures  Given a Courant algebroid with the inner product \\\\langle.,.\\\\rangle of split signature (e.g. the standard one TM\\\\oplus T^*M), then a Dirac structure is a maximally isotropic integrable vector subbundle L → M, i.e. : \\\\langle L,L\\\\rangle \\\\equiv 0, : \\\\mathrm{rk}\\\\,L=\\\\tfrac12\\\\mathrm{rk}\\\\,E, : [\\\\Gamma L,\\\\Gamma L]\\\\subset \\\\Gamma L.  Examples  As discovered by Courant and parallel by Dorfman, the graph of a 2-form ω ∈ Ω2(M) is maximally isotropic and moreover integrable iff dω = 0, i.e. the 2-form is closed under the de Rham differential, i.e. a presymplectic structure. A second class of examples arises from bivectors \\\\Pi\\\\in\\\\Gamma(\\\\wedge^2 TM) whose graph is maximally isotropic and integrable iff [Π,Π] = 0, i.e. Π is a Poisson bivector on M.  Generalized complex structures  (see also the main article generalized complex geometry) Given a Courant algebroid with inner product of split signature. A generalized complex structure L → M is a Dirac structure in the complexified Courant algebroid with the additional property : L \\\\cap \\\\bar{L} = 0 where \\\\bar{\\\\ } means complex conjugation with respect to the standard complex structure on the complexification. As studied in detail by GualtieriM. Gualtieri: Generalized complex geometry, Ph.D. thesis, Oxford university, (2004) the generalized complex structures permit the study of geometry analogous to complex geometry.  Examples  Examples are beside presymplectic and Poisson structures also the graph of a complex structure J: TM → TM.

The Seven Dwarfs return home and immediately notice someone has sneaked in, because the house has been cleaned. During their loud discussion, they discover the sleeping Snow White. She wakes up and explains to them what happened. The Dwarfs take pity on her, saying: \\"If you will keep house for us, and cook, make beds, wash, sew, and knit, and keep everything clean and orderly, then you can stay with us, and you shall have everything that you want.\\" They warn her to be careful when alone at home, and to not let anyone in while they are delving in the mountains. When the Queen, disguised as an old peddler, ties a colorful, silk bodice onto Snow White, it causes her to faint. The Seven Dwarfs return just in time and Snow White is saved when the Dwarfs cut the lace. When the Queen dresses as a comb seller, she gives Snow White a poisoned comb, but the Seven Dwarfs save her again. The Queen then appears disguised as a farmer's wife and gives Snow White a poisoned apple, of which she consumes and seemingly dies. This time, the Seven Dwarfs are unable to revive the girl, because they can't find the source of Snow White's poor health and, assuming that she is dead, they place her in a glass coffin. After some time has passed, a Prince traveling through the land sees Snow White where he strides to her coffin, and instantly falls in love with her upon being enchanted by her beauty. As the Prince transports her body back to his castle, her coffin is hit hard and a large piece of apple in her throat is released which revives her. The prince marries Snow White. Appearances in Modern Media=Disney Dwarfs Dopey on the emblem for the 341st Bombardment Squadron during World War II. A Disney version of the Seven Dwarfs, also called Disney Dwarfs as a potential Disney Consumer Products/DisneyToon Studios franchise, appeared in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the Seven Dwarfs in this are: * Doc (voiced by Roy Atwell in the film, Jim Cummings and André Sogliuzzo in later projects, Bill Farmer in The 7D) – The leader of the seven dwarfs, Doc wears glasses and often mixes up his words. * Happy (voiced by Otis Harlan in the film, Kevin Schoen and Stephen Stanton in later projects, Kevin Michael Richardson in The 7D) – Happy is the jovial dwarf and is usually portrayed laughing. * Sneezy (voiced by Billy Gilbert in the film, Bob Joles in later projects, Scott Menville in The 7D) – Sneezy's name is earned by his extraordinarily powerful sneezes (caused by hay fever), which are seen blowing even the heaviest of objects across a room. * Sleepy (voiced by Pinto Colvig in the film, Bill Farmer in later projects, Stephen Stanton in The 7D) – Sleepy is always tired and appears lethargic in most situations. * Bashful (voiced by Scotty Mattraw in the film, Jeff Bennett in later projects, Billy West in The 7D) – Bashful is very shy and kind- hearted. He is also described as cute. He also has a rosy blushy face and a small shy smile. * Grumpy (voiced by Pinto Colvig in the film, Corey Burton in later projects, Maurice LaMarche in The 7D) – Grumpy initially opposes Snow White's presence in the dwarfs' home, but later warns her of the threat posed by the Queen and eagerly rushes to her aid upon realizing that she is in danger, leading the charge himself. He has the biggest nose of the dwarfs, and is frequently seen with one eye shut. * Dopey (vocal effects provided by Eddie Collins in the film, Dee Bradley Baker in The 7D) – Dopey is the only dwarf who does not have a beard. He is accident-prone and mute, with Happy explaining that he has simply \\"never tried\\" to speak. He is unvoiced like Gideon the Cat in Pinocchio, the title character as the circus elephant Dumbo, and Tootles in Peter Pan. The Seven Dwarfs also appeared in Seven Wise Dwarfs, All Together, The Winged Scourge, and House of Mouse. Doc, a Boeing B-29 Superfortress, was named after one of the Seven Disney Dwarfs. In the early 2000s, DisneyToon Studios (DTS) joined Disney Consumer Products (DCP) as their internal Disney conglomerate video partner in developing the new Disney franchises. While DCP eyed other potential franchises, DisneyToon looked to the Seven Dwarfs for a male-centric franchise to counterbalance the female- centric Fairies. By 2005, The Seven Dwarfs computer-animated sequel to Snow White was officially underway. Paul and Gaëtan Brizzi was one team that was given an attempt at a movie pitch, which was to follow the Dwarfs in which they trap the villain in the magic mirror and setting it up for Snow White movie. Given the possible demand, Buena Vista Games brought in Obsidian Entertainment, a game developer, who pitched a video game focusing on the Dwarfs' similar ancestors. DTS executives were not feeling that the two franchise launching projects were coming together well enough that they turned to Mike Disa, who worked on the Tinker Bell movie story. Disa and Evan Spiliotopoulos pitched a Lord of the Rings-style epic for the dwarfs while \\"connecting seamlessly\\" with the original movie, which was given permission to move forward. With interfering managers wanting a tragic back story for Dopey, Disa decided that he could not go forward. Walt Disney Animation Studios chief creative officer John Lasseter about two month later ended production on the film. The 7D is an American animated television series produced by Disney Television Animation franchise based on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. This series is the first Walt Disney Animation Studios classic series. The TV series details the 7D working for Queen Delightful where they protect Jollywood from the Glooms and other threats. The Seven Dwarfs were given a new theme park attraction called the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train coaster. In Descendants and Descendants 2, Dopey is shown to have a son named Doug (portrayed by Zachary Gibson) who can talk and becomes smitten by Evil Queen's daughter Evie. In the Descendants novel The Isle of the Lost, Doc is shown to be sympathetic towards the Goblins that operate on the Isle of the Lost's Goblin Wharf where they want amnesty for their involvement with Maleficent. Sesame Street In Sesame Street, there were different versions of the Seven Dwarfs where each of them was made from Anything Muppets. * The Six Dwarfs seen in Episode 279 consisted of Sparky (performed by Jerry Nelson), Snooky (performed by Jerry Nelson), Pokey (performed by Jim Henson), Flakey (performed by Jim Henson), Drippy (performed by Jerry Nelson), and Sneaky (performed by Jim Henson). Snow White visited their house instead of the Seven Dwarfs by mistake and was able to see the difference. * In a Sesame Street News Flash that was seen in Episode 2787, the Seven Emotional Dwarfs appear where they were interviewed by Kermit the Frog. Their names are Cheerful (performed by Richard Hunt), Sad (performed by Kevin Clash), Angry (performed by Jerry Nelson), Proud (performed by Martin P. Robinson), Fearful (performed by David Rudman), Lovey (performed by James Kroupa), and Surprised (performed by Jim Martin). * In Episode 4114, the Seven Dwarfs appear opposite Snow White (portrayed by Amy Sedaris). The Seven Dwarfs consist of Clumsy (performed by Joey Mazzarino), Vertigo (performed by Fran Brill), Gassy (performed by Matt Vogel), Itchy (performed by Carmen Osbahr), Smelly (performed by Martin P. Robinson), Sensitive-Nose (performed by Ryan Dillon), and Hammy (performed by Eric Jacobson). Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics In the \\"Snow White\\" episode of Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics, the Seven Dwarfs are named Sunday (voiced by Clifton Wells in the English dub), Monday (voiced by Kerrigan Mahan in the English dub), Tuesday, Wednesday (voiced by Tom Wyner in the English dub), Thursday, Friday (voiced by Michael Sorich in the English dub), and Saturday (voiced by Edward Mannix in the English dub) and are shown to be allied with a pack of wolves. Happily Ever After In Happily Ever After, it was mentioned that the Seven Dwarfs have opened up a mine in the next kingdom. In their place is the Seven Dwarfelles who have received a power based on nature to help out their boss Mother Nature. The Dwarfelles consisted of: * Muddy (voiced by Carol Channing) – A Dwarfelle who has power over the earth, and as such performs such tricks as causing minor tremors and such. She feels most comfortable playing in the mud. * Sunburn (voiced by Sally Kellerman) – A Dwarfelle who has power over sunlight, and is able to focus sun rays in any area and to whatever extremity she so wishes. She uses her power in the film to clear away clouds and summon down a beam of light to illuminate a dark cave. She has a New Yorker accent and attitude and her catchphrase is \\"This really BURNS me up!\\". * Blossom (voiced by Zsa Zsa Gabor) – A Dwarfelle who has power over plants and flowers, and is seen throughout the animation zapping the ground and having flowers spring up. It becomes apparent that her flora powers are less effective if the area is less natural or adaptable, as in the Realm of Doom. Blossom is very reminiscent of her voice actress with Gabor's mannerisms, penchant for the beautiful and fashionable, and even her signature accent. * Marina (voiced by Linda Gary) – A Dwarfelle who has power over all lakes and rivers, but the only example of her powers in the film is being able to breathe underwater. Marina carries herself as a gentlewoman and has a British accent. * Critterina (voiced by Linda Gary) – A Dwarfelle who has power of all animals who are created by Mother Nature. She is able to communicate with all animals, regardless of their creators, but does not have control over animals who are not Mother Nature's work like Lord Maliss' one- horned wolves. Although the other Dwarfelles are human in appearance, Critterina looks anthropomorphic. She aptly has a cowgirl mentality and a Texan accent. * Moonbeam (voiced by Tracey Ullman) – A Dwarfelle is never seen using her powers, but has the distinct characteristic of being in a deep slumber and sleepwalking in the day, and only awaking at night. * Thunderella (voiced by Tracey Ullman) – The seventh and youngest Dwarfelle, and is considered the 'black sheep' of the seven because of her inability to control her powers. She has power over weather, and always seems to mess her attempts at creating storms. She ends up saving the day by hitting Lord Maliss with a bolt of lightning she creates from her fingertip. The Dwarfelles helped Snow White on her quest to rescue the Prince from the Queen's sorcerer brother Lord Maliss. Snow White (1990) The Seven Dwarves appear in the 1990 Snow White film voiced by Jim Cummings and Rob Paulsen. Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child In Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child, the show's adaption of \\"Snow White\\" that takes place in the American southwest depicts the Seven Dwarves as seven mystical little men who came from the north to mine turquoise. They consist of: * Bright Silver (voiced by Pato Hoffmann) – The leader of the seven little men. * Fool's Gold (voiced by Burr DeBenning) – The clumsiest little man. * Smelly Sulfur (voiced by Burr DeBenning) – The smelliest little man. * Hard Jade (voiced by Tim Sampson) – The strongest little man. * Rough Copper (voiced by Jim Great Elk Waters) – Named for his temper, but is also quick-witted. * Sharp Flint (voiced by Michael Horse) – Named for his sharp tongue. * Heavy Metal (voiced by Sonny Skyhawk/Sonny Roubideaux) – The hungriest little man. Shrek The Seven Dwarfs appear in the Shrek series. In Shrek, the Seven Dwarfs appear in the first film carrying Snow White's coffin. When they place the coffin on the table, Shrek says \\"Oh no no no no! Dead broad off the table!\\" One of the Dwarfs says \\"Where else are we supposed to put it? The bed's already been taken.\\" Shrek promptly finds the Big Bad Wolf in his bed. They are seen again at the start of Shrek 2, giving Shrek a ring engraved with \\"I love you\\" in flaming letters for Fiona (in an allusion to the One Ring from The Lord of the Rings). In Shrek the Third, one of them is given to Fiona as a wedding present (as a babysitter) from Snow White who says she has six more at home. The Seven Dwarfs are seen at the end of Scared Shrekless when Shrek and Fiona celebrate by egging them. In Shrek The Musical, one of the dwarfs Grumpy knew that he abandoned his son Farquaad in the woods as a child after his wife The Princess and the Pea falls out of 25 mattresses. However, when the fairytale characters brought Grumpy to Farquaad's wedding, he reveals that he kicked Farquaad out because he was twenty-eight years old and living in his basement. Mirror Mirror In Mirror Mirror, the Seven Dwarfs work as Highwaymen and rob from anyone that comes down their way by wearing boots with retractable stilts that make them look taller. The Seven Dwarfs consist of: * Will Grimm (portrayed by Danny Woodburn) – The leader of the Seven Dwarfs. He is named after the Brothers Grimm. * Butcher (portrayed by Martin Klebba) – A Dwarf that used to work as a butcher. * Wolf (portrayed by Sebastian Saraceno) – A Dwarf in a wolf cape who can also howl. * Napoleon (portrayed by Jordan Prentice) – A Dwarf that wears a hat similar to Napoleon Bonaparte. * Half Pint (portrayed by Mark Povinelli) – A Dwarf who has a crush on Snow White. * Grub (portrayed by Joe Gnoffo) – A Dwarf who is always eating. * Chuck (portrayed by Ronald Lee Clark) – A Dwarf who chuckles a lot. The Seven Dwarfs help Snow White to form a resistance against Queen Clementianna. Princesses In the Princesses series by Jim C. Hines, the dwarfs are actually anthropomorphic elemental personifications, summoned by Snow to aid her based on a spell from one of her mother's books. The seven dwarfs represent Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Light, Shadow, and Magic, although the 'Magic' dwarf is essentially a spirit that just inhabits Snow and enhances her power rather than appearing on its own, with the others appearing in some form to represent their element. Although powerful fighters that will serve Snow loyally, the consequences of summoning them is that Snow must 'pay' the spirits with seven years of her life, with the result that she appears to be in her mid-thirties when she is really only in her early twenties. As a result, she has only summoned the dwarves twice, initially calling on their aid to help her defeat her mother before the series began, and summoning them again to help her and her allies defeat her mother's spirit in the first book in the series (she contemplated summoning them against to deal with the ruthless Wild Hunt in Red Riding's Revenge, but was advised against it as the spiritual nature of the hunt meant that nobody could be sure if the dwarves could do anything against them). Snow White and the Huntsman In Snow White and the Huntsman, the Seven Dwarfs started out as eight dwarfs when they are encountered by Snow White and Eric the Huntsman while fleeing Queen Ravenna. The Seven Dwarfs are: * Beith (portrayed by Ian McShane) – The leader of the Seven Dwarfs. His name is the name of the first letter (\\"B\\") in the Ogham alphabet. * Muir (portrayed by Bob Hoskins) – The blind elder dwarf who possesses the powers of premonition and is the father of Quert. His name echoes muin, the name of \\"M\\" in the Ogham alphabet. * Quert (portrayed by Johnny Harris) – The son of Muir. His name echoes ceirt, the name of \\"Q\\" in the Ogham alphabet. * Coll (portrayed by Toby Jones) – The brother of Duir. His name is the name of \\"C\\" in the Ogham alphabet. * Duir (portrayed by Eddie Marsan) – The brother of Coll. His name is the name of \\"D\\" in the Ogham alphabet. * Gort (portrayed by Ray Winstone) – An ill-tempered dwarf. His name is the name of \\"G\\" in the Ogham alphabet. * Nion (portrayed by Nick Frost) – Beith's right-hand dwarf. His name is the name of \\"N\\" in the Ogham alphabet (sometimes given as nuin). * Gus (portrayed by Brian Gleeson) – A dwarf who develops a bond with Snow White. He is killed during an attack by Queen Ravenna's men where he sacrifices his life to protect Snow White. His name does not correspond to an Ogham letter. The Dwarfs were played by actors without dwarfism who had their faces digitally transmuted onto small bodies, prompting a protest from the Little People of America.Dwarfs threaten '100-midget march' over Snow White and the Huntsman film, Guy Adams, The Independent (UK), Thursday 07 June 2012 In The Huntsman: Winter's War, Nion returns where he aids Eric the Huntsman in retrieving the Magic Mirror which was stolen before it can be sealed away. They are aided by Nion's half-brother Gryff (portrayed by Rob Brydon) who is a debt collector. Once Upon a Time In Once Upon a Time, the Seven Dwarfs (who started out as eight) are on the side of Snow White and go by their Disney names. * Grumpy (played by Lee Arenberg) is one of eight Dwarf brothers who hatched from their eggs at the same time. Like all dwarfs, he is immediately sent to work in the mines and is given an ax, which names him Dreamy. Because his egg was accidentally sprinkled with fairy dust by the fairy Nova, he dreams about her and falls in love with her. Later, he meets her and the pair make plans to buy a boat and see the world. However, the Blue Fairy tells him that if he and Nova run away together, she will lose her wings and she will never be truly happy. To prevent this, Dreamy ends their relationship and breaks her heart. He returns to the mines the next day and breaks his ax mining; when he is given another, it renames him Grumpy. He is later caught possessing a stolen diamond, which he did not know was stolen, and is seen in King George's dungeon in a cell next to Snow White's. He is freed by Stealthy, one of his brothers, and he in turn frees Snow. As he and Stealthy escape, they are discovered by George and his guards and Stealthy is killed. Before the guards can kill Grumpy, Snow goes with George in exchange for Grumpy's life. Grumpy and the remaining six dwarfs run into Snow outside the castle. Grumpy tells her that she must live with the pain of a lost love to grow as a person and does not allow her to drink a potion that makes her forget about her love for Prince James. The seven dwarfs then allow her to live with them. Later, Grumpy goes to tell her that James called off his wedding, but he discovers that she drank the potion. He and his brothers try to confront Snow about her new, mean-spirited behavior, but they drive her to try and kill the Evil Queen instead. He takes her to see Rumplestiltskin, who gave her the potion, but he advises her on the best way to kill the Queen instead. Eventually, Snow regains her memory and apologizes to the dwarfs for her behavior. She decides to rescue James, who was captured by George, and Grumpy and his brothers go with her. Grumpy is later seen discussing the best course of action against the Evil Queen and her curse, calling for war. He is also seen as a guard looking out for the curse in a watchtower of Snow's and James's castle. In Storybrooke, he is Leroy, a janitor at the hospital and the \\"town drunk.\\" He, like the rest of Storybrooke, is hostile toward Mary Margaret, who is Snow White, after learning about her affair with David Nolan, who is Prince James. He meets Sister Astrid, who is Nova, and decides to help Mary Margaret sell candles for the nunnery and raise money for the nunnery's rent so that he can be near Astrid. When he and Mary Margaret fail to sell enough candles, he lies about the number they sold because he is unable to disappoint Astrid. He tries to sell his boat to Mr. Gold in the hopes that he will forgive the rent. Mr. Gold refuses. Astrid later learns about the candles and is upset that he lied. That night, Leroy causes a blackout, forcing the residents to buy candles. The candles sell out and the nunnery is able to pay its rent. Leroy then offers the grateful Astrid the opportunity to be the first passenger on his boat. Leroy's memories as Grumpy are restored when the curse is broken, and he hugs Snow when he next sees her. He wishes for Regina to be killed by the mob led by Dr. Whale, though he decides against it at Snow's insistence. He unites the Dwarfs together and they begin to mine for fairy dust again. * Sleepy (played by Faustino Di Bauda) – Sleepy is a sleepy dwarf who is one of the Seven Dwarfs. In Storybrooke, he is Walter, a security guard that works at Storybrooke Hospital who occasionally dozes off on the job. * Sneezy (played by Gabe Khouth) – Sneezy is a dwarf who often sneezes and is one of the Seven Dwarfs. In Storybrooke, he is Tom Clark, the owner of the Dark Star pharmacy where several characters are seen purchasing different products throughout the show. In Season 2, Sneezy joined the other dwarfs in an experiment that involved why the fairy tale characters can't leave Storybrooke. Upon drawing the shortest straw, Sneezy crossed the border out of Storybrooke and lost his memories of his past life in Fairy Tale Land once again. * Doc (played by David Paul Grove) – Doc is a dwarf who is one of the Seven Dwarfs. In Storybrooke, he still has his name but his occupation is unknown. * Bashful (played by Mig Micario) – Bashful is a dwarf who is one of the Seven Dwarfs. In Storybrooke, his human form is not named. * Dopey (played by Jeffrey Kaiser) – Dopey is a dwarf who is one of the Seven Dwarfs and has never spoken. In Storybrooke, his human form is not named. * Happy (played by Michael Coleman) – Happy is a dwarf who is one of the Seven Dwarfs. In Storybrooke, his human form is not named. There were some other dwarfs that were associated with the Seven Dwarfs: * Stealthy (played by Geoff Gustafson) was a dwarf who used to be part of the Seven Dwarfs' group. He received his name from his axe like the other dwarfs because of his skillful infiltration abilities. He once tried to break Grumpy and Snow White out of his prison cell in King George's castle, but was killed during their escape. Grumpy would later comment, \\"I miss Stealthy\\", when trying to sneak into an enemy lair. He later ended up in the Underworld and after Henry gives him his unfinished business being his resentment towards Bashful he is able to move and ask Henry to tell his brother he misses them. In the Wish Realm, Stealthy is seen to be alive after Queen Snow and King David defeated the Evil Queen. * Bossy (played by Ken Kramer) is a dwarf who is also the leader of the other dwarfs. * Watchy (played by Richard Ian Cox) is a dwarf who watches over the dwarf eggs until they hatch. The Goodies In the first episode of the final series of The Goodies (which was filmed at ITV), The Goodies did a story set in a fairy tale world where they replaced three of the seven dwarfs (two of them died of exposure and another one was eaten by a gold fish). But they are later found out because of their height. The dwarfs take their names from the Disney film (Sleepy, Happy, and Grumpy) while Graeme and Bill renamed themselves to fit in (Soppy and Gwotty). Only Tim kept his name.

Miss Jerry was not a film, but a series of posed magic lantern slides projected onto a screen with a dissolving stereopticon, accompanied by narration and music, making it the first example of a feature-length dramatic fiction on screen. Miss Jerry debuted on October 9, 1894 at the Carbon Studio in New York City. It has been described as \\"the first picture play\\" and while other early film and peep-show animations produced at this time were short documentaries, Miss Jerry sought to develop what is arguably the first feature of moving pictures. This photoplay attempts to create an impression of movement with the slides changing once every 15 seconds. The Picture Play \\"In Miss Jerry my purpose has been to test experimentally, in a quiet story, certain possibilities of illusion, with this aim always before me, that the illusion should not, because it need not and could not safely, be that of photographs from an acted play, nor of artistic illustration, but the illusion of reality'.\\" Aware of the progress made by Eadweard Muybridge and other photographers towards the illusion of motion, Black instead set out to present a convincing narrative story in front of an audience, using still photography to present fiction in a convincing way, rather than a perfect illusion of motion. In his 1926 history of the movies, A Million and One Nights the author Terry Ramsaye says: :While the motion picture was progressing with mincing steps in the peep show Edison Kinetoscope the sheer force of the evolution of expression presented the world with an interesting paradox – the birth of the photoplay upon the screen. . . Black arrived at a rate of four slides a minute for his presentation. The plan was to make the pictures successively blend into one another in the dissolving stereopticon, avoiding an optical ‘jar’ as much as possible. Each picture represented a step forward in the action. The pictures were carefully registered always to present every still object in the view in precisely the same position, while only the moving actors were shown in altered attitudes. There could, of course, be no hope of depicting rapid motion. Black chose, in such instances, to picture the moments before and after the swift action involved. For example, the villain might stand menacing the hero with an upraised dagger, while the next slide would show the victim of the stab in a heap on the floor. The spoken obligation from the stage had to carry across the imagined stroke of the stabbing. No intact set of slides for Miss Jerry is known to exist. Plot After finding out that her father is suffering financial problems, Jerry Holbrook decides to start a career in journalism in the heart of New York City. While working she falls in love with the editor of her paper, Mr. Hamilton. After being offered a job in London the couple initially have problems but Jerry accepts a proposal of marriage and they leave for London together.

The second name is in honor of the German ornithologist Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger. It was previously placed in the genera Ara or Propyrrhura. Blue-winged macaws have been known to reach an age of 50–60 years.  Description It has a total length of approximately 36–43 cm (14–17 in). It has a moderately sized black bill, a long tail and a mainly green plumage. The upperside of the remiges and primary coverts are blue, as indicated by its common name. The underside of the wings is yellowish, the tail-tip, crown and cheeks are bluish, and the tail-base and small belly-patch are red. The iris is amber. It and the red-bellied macaw are the only macaws where the bare facial-skin is yellowish, but this often fades to white in captivity. Unlike the red-bellied macaw, the blue-winged has a red lower abdomen and a red lower back. In the wild, its flight pattern is said to be a distinctive 'jerky, rearing motion.'  Habitat and food  The blue- winged macaw occurs in eastern and southern Brazil (with a remnant population north-east), eastern Paraguay and, at least formerly, in far north-eastern Argentina and east of Bolivia. It occurs in evergreen and deciduous forests, with a preference for gallery forest. They mainly feed on seeds of Cnidoscolus phyllacanthus, Jatropha, Guazuma ulmifolia, and the non-native Melia azedarach. However, the birds also feed on fruits and nuts. Breeding The blue-winged macaw attain sexual maturity between 2 and 4 years after they are born. Adult females usually produce two eggs which take approximately 29 days to hatch. Young blue-winged macaws learn to fly about 11 weeks after they have hatched. They stay with their parents for about a year after learning to fly. Relatively little information exists on its reproduction in the wild, but the breeding season in north-eastern Brazil is apparently from December to February. However, in 1990, a female blue-winged macaw was discovered with a male Spix's macaw in a site.  Threats  These birds are affected mostly by deforestation. They were also captured for the cagebird trade - from 1977 to 1979, 183 birds arrived at the United States from Paraguay. It has declined in the southern part of its range, and there are no recent records from Misiones Province in Argentina where many were killed by farmers who considered them pests.Bodrati, A., K.

Information from Brazil suggests it remains widespread and has even re-colonised areas in its historical range in southern Rio de Janeiro. This has led to it being downlisted to near threatened.

As a rookie, he appeared in 3 games (one start), before being placed on the injured reserve list on September 7 with a knee injury. The next season after Charley Hannah suffered a season ending knee injury, he started 6 games between left guard and center, but was placed on the injured reserve list with a knee injury on November 30, missing the last 3 contests. In 1989, he was the full-time starter at right guard where he started all 16 games. After the Raiders signed Max Montoya in Plan B free agency, Gesek became expendable and was traded to the Dallas Cowboys in exchange for a fifth round draft choice (#124-Ben Coates) on September 3, 1990. Dallas Cowboys In 1990, he passed Kevin Gogan on the depth chart and became the starter at right guard in the fifth game of the season. Gesek was the starter at right guard during his first three seasons with the Dallas Cowboys, including Super Bowl XXVII. In 1991, he started the first 14 games at right guard until suffering a left ankle sprain against the New Orleans Saints. The next game against the Philadelphia Eagles, he was limited to only short yardage situations, but was able to recover for the rest of the season and the playoffs. The offensive line helped Emmit Smith lead the league with 365 carries for 1,563 rushing yards. In 1992, he started all 16 games at right guard. The offensive line helped the offense rank fourth in the league in total offense, fifth in rushing and passing. It also contributed to Smith winning to his second consecutive NFL rushing title with 1,713 yards. He was a part of the XXVII winning team. In 1993, he was injured in a pre-season game against the Raiders and was replaced by Kevin Gogan and remained in a reserve role, until Mark Stepnoski suffered a knee injury against the Minnesota Vikings in the 13th game of the season. After trying Frank Cornish as the replacement at center, the team settled on Gesek for the playoffs run and Super Bowl XXVIII. His role in one of the greatest offensive lines in NFL history was detailed in NFL Network's 2013 A Football Life: \\"The Great Wall of Dallas\\". Before the start of the 1994 season, with four Cowboys offensive linemen declared as free agents, the Cowboys focused on re-signing guard Nate Newton, and Gesek became a sought after free agent and opted to change teams. Washington Redskins After fielding offers from several teams, including the Los Angeles Raiders and San Francisco 49’ers, he signed a contract on March 16, 1994 as a free agent with the Washington Redskins, reuniting him with head coach Norv Turner, who was his offensive coordinator with the Cowboys. Although he had played most of his career at guard, the Washington Redskins signed him as a free agent to play center and allow the move of Raleigh McKenzie to right guard. Gesek was the starting center during his 2 seasons with the team. In 1995, he started 12 games at center and four at right guard, despite being limited with pain in his neck and arm, caused by a bulging disk in his neck, which eventually forced him to retire. On August 20, 1996, he was waived injured and was replaced with a platoon of Jeff Uhlenhake and Cory Raymer. Gesek was ultimately granted his tenth year through arbitration when it was found the Redskins released him while injured. Personal life After retiring from the NFL, Gesek became an entrepreneur, real estate developer, and founder of Optimus Capital Advisors, where he continues in his role as a financial advisor and firm principal. He is married to Gina and has four grown children, daughters Presley, Audra, Payton and son Tanner, as well as granddaughter Evaliah.

Beslan hostage crisis In several incidents reporters critical of the Russian government could not get to Beslan during the crisis. They included Andrey Babitsky, who was indicted on hooliganism after a brawl with two men who picked a fight with him in the Moscow Vnukovo Airport and sentenced to a 15-day arrest.2 Reporters Unable to Travel to Beslan The Moscow Times, September 6, 2004On the Moscow Vnukovo airport conflict, Radio Free Europe, September 3, 2004. Machine-translated by online-translator.com The late Novaya Gazeta journalist Anna Politkovskaya, who had negotiated during the 2002 Moscow siege, was twice prevented by the authorities from boarding a flight. When she eventually succeeded, she fell into a coma after being poisoned aboard an airplane bound to Rostov-on-Don.On Anna Politkovskaya falling into a coma, Novaya Gazeta, September 4, 2004. Anonymous translation According to the report by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), several correspondents were detained in Beslan (including Russians Anna Gorbatova and Oksana Semyonova from Novye Izvestia, Madina Shavlokhova from Moskovskij Komsomolets, Elena Milashina from Novaya Gazeta, and Simon Ostrovskiy from The Moscow Times). Several foreign journalists were also briefly detained, including a group of foreign journalists from Polish Gazeta Wyborcza, French Libération and British The Guardian. The chief of the Moscow bureau of the Arab TV channel Al Jazeera was framed into the possession of a round of ammunition at the airfield in Mineralnye Vody. Many foreign journalists were exposed to pressure from the security forces and the materials were confiscated from TV crews from ZDF and ARD (Germany), APTN (USA), and Rustavi 2 (Georgia). The crew of Rustavi 2 was arrested; the Georgian Minister of Health said that the correspondent Nana Lezhava, who had been kept for fives days in the Russian pre-trial detention centers, had been poisoned with dangerous psychotropic drugs (like Politkovskaya, Lezhava passed out after being given a cup of tea). The crew from another Georgian TV channel Mze was expelled from Beslan. Raf Shakirov, chief editor of the Izvestia newspaper, was forced to resign after criticism by the major shareholders of both style and content of the September 4, 2004 issue. In contrast to the less emotional coverage by other Russian newspapers, Izvestia had featured large pictures of dead or injured hostages. It also expressed doubts about the government's version of events. According to a poll by Levada Center conducted a week after Beslan crisis, 83% of polled Russians believed that the government was hiding at least a part of the truth about the Beslan events from them. According to the poll by Echo of Moscow radio station, 92% of the people polled said that Russian TV channels concealed parts of information.

From 2003 to 2011 he served in the Croatian Government as Croatia's Minister of the Sea, Transport and Infrastructure under HDZ prime ministers Ivo Sanader and Jadranka Kosor. Kalmeta is of partial Albanian origin. Early life Kalmeta graduated in 1982 from the University of Zagreb Faculty of Agronomy. From 1982 to 1993 he worked in his hometown of Zadar as a technologist and manager at the Maraska distilling company (which produces the world-famous Maraschino liqueur). Political career In 1989 he joined the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) and in 1993 his full-time political career started after he was elected to the Zadar City Council. In 1994 he became Zadar's deputy mayor, and from 1994 to 2003 he served as mayor of the city. From 1995 to 2003 he was also a member of the Croatian Parliament, serving as one of representatives from Zadar County. At the 7th HDZ Convention he was elected party's Vice-President, beating Ivić Pašalić, and is currently a member of the party's presidency. After HDZ won the Croatian parliamentary elections of 2003, Kalmeta was appointed to the newly created post of Minister of the Sea, Tourism, Transport and Development (which was created by merging three separate ministries) under Prime Minister Ivo Sanader. One of the chief accomplishments credited to his ministry was the completion of the A1 Highway linking the country's two largest cities, Zagreb and Split. In the next elections of 2007 HDZ won again and Kalmeta kept his post under Ivo Sanader's second term in office.

Various kinds of contemporary Latin can be distinguished, including the use of single words in taxonomy, and the fuller ecclesiastical use in the Catholic Church – but Living or Spoken Latin (the use of Latin as a language in its own right as a full-fledged means of expression) is the primary subject of this article. Token Latin As a relic of the great importance of New Latin as the formerly dominant international lingua franca down to the 19th century in a great number of fields, Latin is still present in words or phrases used in many languages around the world, and some minor communities use Latin in their speech. Mottos The official use of Latin in previous eras has survived at a symbolic level in many mottos that are still being used and even coined in Latin to this day. Old mottos like , found in 1776 on the Seal of the United States, along with and , and adopted by an Act of Congress in 1782, are still in use. Similarly, current pound sterling coins are minted with the Latin inscription ELIZABETH·II·D·G·REG·F·D (, i.e. Queen by the Grace of God, Defender of the Faith). The official motto of the multilingual European Union, adopted as recently as 2000, is the Latin . Similarly, the motto on the Canadian Victoria Cross is in Latin, perhaps due to Canada's bilingual status. Fixed phrases Some common phrases that are still in use in many languages have remained fixed in Latin, like the well- known or . In science In fields as varied as mathematics, physics, astronomy, medicine, pharmacy, biology, and philosophy Latin still provides internationally accepted names of concepts, forces, objects, and organisms in the natural world. The most prominent retention of Latin occurs in the classification of living organisms and the binomial nomenclature devised by Carl Linnaeus, although the rules of nomenclature used today allow the construction of names which may deviate considerably from historical norms. Another continuation is the use of Latin names for the constellations and celestial objects (used in the Bayer designations of stars), as well as planets and satellites, whose surface features have been given Latin selenographic toponyms since the 17th century. Symbols for many of those chemical elements of the periodic table known in ancient times reflect and echo their Latin names, like Au for (gold) and Fe for (iron). Vernacular vocabulary Latin has also contributed a vocabulary for specialised fields such as anatomy and law which has become part of the normal, non-technical vocabulary of various European languages. Latin continues to be used to form international scientific vocabulary and classical compounds. Separately, more than 56% of the vocabulary used in English today derives ultimately from Latin, either directly (28.24%) or through French (28.30%).According to the computerised survey of about 80,000 words in the old Shorter Oxford Dictionary (3rd ed.) published in Ordered Profusion by Thomas Finkenstaedt and Dieter Wolff, Latin influence in English. Ecclesiastical Latin The Catholic Church has continued to use Latin. Two main areas can be distinguished. One is its use for the official version of all documents issued by Vatican City, which has remained intact to the present. Although documents are first drafted in various vernaculars (mostly Italian), the official version is written in Latin by the Latin Letters Office. The other is its use for the liturgy, which has diminished after the Second Vatican Council of 1962–65, but to some degree resurged half a century later when Pope Benedict XVI encouraged the Latin Mass. After the Church of England published the Book of Common Prayer in English in 1559, a 1560 Latin edition was published for use at universities such as Oxford and the leading public schools, where the liturgy was still permitted to be conducted in Latin, and there have been several Latin translations since. Most recently a Latin edition of the 1979 USA Anglican Book of Common Prayer has appeared. Academic Latin Latin has also survived to some extent in the context of classical scholarship. Some classical periodicals, like Mnemosyne and the German Hermes, to this day accept articles in Latin for publication.Konrad M. Kokoszkiewicz, \\"A. Gellius, Noctes Atticæ, 16.2.6: tamquam si te dicas adulterum negent\\", Mnemosyne 58 (2005) 132–135; \\"Et futura panda siue de Catulli carmine sexto corrigendo\\", Hermes 132 (2004) 125–128. Latin is used in most of the introductions to the critical editions of ancient authors in the Oxford Classical Texts series, and it is also nearly always used for the apparatus criticus of Ancient Greek and Latin texts. The University Orator at the University of Cambridge makes a speech in Latin marking the achievements of each of the honorands at the annual Honorary Degree Congregations, as does the Public Orator at the Encaenia ceremony at the University of Oxford. Harvard and Princeton also have Latin Salutatory commencement addresses every year. The Charles University in Prague and many other universities around the world conduct the awarding of their doctoral degrees in Latin. Other universities and other schools issue diplomas written in Latin. Brown, Sewanee, and Bard College also hold a portion of their graduation ceremonies in Latin. The song is sung at university opening or graduation ceremonies throughout Europe. Living Latin Living Latin ( in Latin itself), also known as Spoken Latin, is an effort to revive Latin as a spoken language and as the vehicle for contemporary communication and publication. Involvement in this Latin revival can be a mere hobby or extend to more serious projects for restoring its former role as an international auxiliary language. Origins After the decline of Latin at the end of the New Latin era started to be perceived, there were attempts to counteract the decline and to revitalize the use of Latin for international communication. In 1815, Miguel Olmo wrote a booklet proposing Latin as the common language for Europe, with the title (\\" of Villaudric to the eight great princes who ordained world peace at Vienna in 1815, an extraordinary book about the Latin language and a Latin state to be founded\\").IJsewijn, Jozef, Companion to Neo- Latin Studies. Part I. History and Diffusion of Neo-Latin Literature, Leuven University Press, 1990, p. 112s. In the late 19th century, Latin periodicals advocating the revived use of Latin as an international language started to appear. Between 1889 and 1895, Karl Heinrich Ulrichs published in Italy his .Cf. Wilfried Stroh (ed.), Alaudæ. , Hamburg, MännerschwarmSkript Verlag, 2004. This publication was followed by the ,Cf. , Melissa, 139 (2007) 8–11. published by the architect and engineer Aristide Leonori from 1898, twice a month, until 1913, one year before the outbreak of World War I. The early 20th century, marked by warfare and by drastic social and technological changes, saw few advances in the use of Latin outside academia. Following the beginnings of the re-integration of postwar Europe, however, Latin revivalism gained some strength. One of its main promoters was the former dean of the University of Nancy (France), Prof. Jean Capelle, who in 1952 published a cornerstone article called \\"Latin or Babel\\"Published on 23 October 1952 in the French , an English version of the same was published in The Classical Journal and signed by himself and Thomas H. Quigley (The Classical Journal, Vol. 49, No. 1, October 1953, pp. 37–40) in which he proposed Latin as an international spoken language. Capelle was called \\"the soul of the movement\\" when in 1956 the first International Conference for Living Latin () took place in Avignon,Goodwin B. Beach, \\"The Congress for Living Latin: Another View\\", The Classical Journal, Vol. 53, No. 3, December 1957, pp. 119–122: marking the beginning of a new era of the active use of Latin. About 200 participants from 22 different countries took part in that foundational conference. Pronunciation The essentials of the classical pronunciation had been defined since the early 19th century (e.g. in K.L. Schneider's , 1819), but in many countries there was strong resistance to adopting it in instruction. In English-speaking countries, where the traditional academic pronunciation diverged most markedly from the restored classical model, the struggle between the two pronunciations lasted for the entire 19th century. The transition between Latin pronunciations was long drawn out; in 1907 the \\"new pronunciation\\" was officially recommended by the Board of Education for adoption in schools in England. Although the older pronunciation, as found in the nomenclature and terminology of various professions, continued to be used for several decades, and in some spheres prevails to the present day, contemporary Latin as used by the living Latin community has generally adopted the classical pronunciation of Latin as restored by specialists in Latin historical phonology.E.g. Prof. Edgar H. Sturtevant (The Pronunciation of Greek and Latin, Chicago Ares Publishers Inc. 1940) and Prof. W. Sidney Allen (, A Guide to the Pronunciation of Classical Latin, Cambridge University Press 1965), who followed in the tradition of previous pronunciation reformers; cf. Erasmus's and even Alcuin's . A similar shift occurred in German-speaking areas: the traditional pronunciation is discussed in , while the reconstructed classical pronunciation, which took hold around 1900, is discussed at . Aims Many users of contemporary Latin promote its use as a spoken language, a movement that dubs itself \\"Living Latin\\". Two main aims can be distinguished in this movement: =For Latin instruction= Among the proponents of spoken Latin, some promote the active use of the language to make learning Latin both more enjoyable and more efficient, drawing upon the methodologies of instructors of modern languages. In the United Kingdom, the Association for the Reform of Latin Teaching (ARLT, still existing as the Association for Latin Teaching), was founded in 1913 by the classical scholar W. H. D. Rouse. It arose from summer schools which Rouse organised to train Latin teachers in the direct method of language teaching, which entailed using the language in everyday situations rather than merely learning grammar and syntax by rote. The Classical Association also encourages this approach. The Cambridge University Press has now published a series of school textbooks based on the adventures of a mouse called Minimus, designed to help children of primary school age to learn the language, as well as its well-known Cambridge Latin Course (CLC) to teach the language to secondary school students, all of which include extensive use of dialogue and an approach to language teaching mirroring that now used for most modern languages, which have brought many of the principles espoused by Rouse and the ARLT into the mainstream of Latin teaching. Outside Great Britain, one of the most accomplished handbooks that fully adopts the direct method for Latin is the well-known by the Dane Hans Henning Ørberg, first published in 1955 and improved in 1990. It is composed fully in Latin, and requires no other language of instruction, and it can be used to teach pupils whatever their mother tongue. =For contemporary communication= Others support the revival of Latin as a language of international communication, in the academic, and perhaps even the scientific and diplomatic, spheres (as it was in Europe and European colonies through Middle Ages until the mid-18th century), or as an international auxiliary language to be used by anyone. However, as a language native to no people, this movement has not received support from any government, national or supranational. Supporting institutions and publications A substantial group of institutions (particularly in Europe, but also in North and South America) has emerged to support the use of Latin as a spoken language. The foundational first International Conference for living Latin () that took place in Avignon was followed by at least five others.The fifth conference took place in Pau, France, from the 1st to 5 April 1975. As a result of those first conferences, the was then created in Rome. Among its most prominent members are well-known classicists from all over the world, like Prof. Michael von Albrecht or Prof. . The ALF held its first international conference in Rome in 1966 bringing together about 500 participants. From then on conferences have taken place every four or five years, in Bucharest, Malta, Dakar, Erfurt, Berlin, Madrid, and many other places. The official language of the ALF is Latin and all acts and proceedings take place in Latin. Also in the year 1966 Clément Desessard published a method with tapes within the series of the French company Assimil. Desessard's work aimed at teaching contemporary Latin for use in an everyday context, although the audio was often criticized for being recorded with a thick French accent. Assimil took this out of print at the end of 2007 and published another Latin method which focused on the classical idiom only. However, in 2015 Assimil re-published Desessard's edition with new audio CDs in restored classical Latin pronunciation. Desessard's method is still used for living Latin instruction at the . In 1986 the Belgian radiologist Gaius Licoppe, who had discovered the contemporary use of Latin and learnt how to speak it thanks to Desessard's method, founded in Brussels the for the promotion of Latin teaching and use for communication. In Germany, Marius Alexa and Inga Pessarra-Grimm founded in September 1987 the (LVPA, or Association for the Promotion of Living Latin). The first (Amöneburg Latin Week) was organized in 1989 at Amöneburg, near Marburg in Germany, by Mechtild Hofmann and Robert Maier. Since then the Latin Weeks were offered every year. In addition, members of the supporting association (European Latin Weeks) published a text book named that contains dialogues in modern everyday Latin. At the located in Rome, Italy, all classes are taught by faculty fluent in Latin or Ancient Greek, and resident students speak in Latin or Greek at all times outside class. Most students are supported by scholarships from the Mnemosyne foundation and spend one or two years in residence to acquire fluency in Latin. The living Latin movement eventually crossed the Atlantic, where it continues to grow. In the summer of 1996, at the University of Kentucky, Prof. Terence Tunberg established the first Conventiculum, an immersion conference in which participants from all over the world meet annually to exercise the active use of Latin to discuss books and literature, and topics related to everyday life. The success of the Conventiculum Lexintoniense has inspired similar conferences throughout the United States. In October 1996 the (SALVI, or North American Institute for Living Latin Studies) was founded in Los Angeles, by a group of professors and students of Latin literature concerned about the long-term future of classical studies in the US. In the University of Kentucky, Prof. Terence Tunberg founded the (known in English as the Institute of Latin Studies), which awards Graduate Certificates in Latin Studies addressed at those with a special interest gaining \\"a thorough command of the Latin language in reading, writing and speaking, along with a wide exposure to the cultural riches of the Latin tradition in its totality\\". This is the only degree-conferring program in the world with courses taught entirely in Latin. There is also a proliferation of Latin-speaking institutions, groups and conferences in the Iberian Peninsula and in Latin America. Some prominent examples of this tendency towards the active use of Latin within Spanish and Portuguese-speaking countries are the annual conferences called Jornadas de Culturaclasica.com, held in different cities of southern Spain, as well as the CAELVM (), a Latin summer program in Madrid. In 2012, the was founded in Puebla, Mexico, by Prof. Alexis Hellmer, in order to promote the study of Latin in that country, where only one university grants a degree in Classics. Most of these groups and institutions organise seminars and conferences where Latin is used as a spoken language, both throughout the year and over the summer, in Europe and in America. Less academic summer encounters wholly carried out in Latin are the ones known as (European Latin Weeks), celebrated in Germany and attracting people of various ages from all over Europe. At the present time, several periodicals and social networking web sites are published in Latin. In France, immediately after the conference at Avignon, the publisher launched the magazine , which still exists, associated to the CERCAM () of the Paul Valéry University, Montpellier III. Until very recently, it was published in Latin in its entirety. In Germany, the magazine was founded in 1965 by Caelestis Eichenseer (1924–2008) and is to this day published wholly in Latin four times a year in the University of Saarbrücken. In Belgium, the magazine Melissa created in 1984 by Gaius Licoppe is still published six times a year completely in Latin. is a free online magazine of crosswords, quizzes, and other games in Latin language. It is published by the Italian cultural Association Leonardo in collaboration with the online Latin news magazine and with ELI publishing house. From 1989 until 2019, Finnish radio station YLE Radio 1 broadcast a weekly review of world news called completely in Latin. The German Radio Bremen also had regular broadcasts in Latin until December 2017. Other attempts have been less successful. Beginning from July 2015 Radio F.R.E.I. from Erfurt (Germany) broadcasts in Latin once a week on Wednesdays for 15 minutes; the broadcast is called . In 2015 the Italian startup pptArt launched its catalogue () and its registration form for artists () in Latin and English. In 2016 ACEM (Enel executives' cultural association) organized with Luca Desiata and Daniel Gallagher the first Business Latin course for managers (). The government of Finland, during its presidencies of the European Union, issued official newsletters in Latin on top of the official languages of the Union. On the Internet The emergence of the Internet on a global scale in the 1990s provided a great tool for the flourishing of communication in Latin, and in February 1996 a Polish Latinist from Warsaw (Poland), Konrad M. Kokoszkiewicz, founded what is still today the most populated and successful Latin-only email list on the Internet, the . Subsequently, the Nuntii Latini of YLE Radio 1 would also create a discussion list called YLE Colloquia Latina. The Circulus Latinus Panormitanus of Palermo (Italy) went a step further creating the first online chat in Latin called the . In February 2003 Konrad M. Kokoszkiewicz published an on-line glossary with his proposals for some computer terms in Latin under the title of . The Internet also allows for the preservation of other contemporary Latin dictionaries that have fallen out of print or have never been printed, like the or the . In June 2004 an on- line newspaper was founded once again from Warsaw by , and is to this day published wholly in Latin about current affairs. In January 2008 a Schola, (membership 1800) a Latin-only social network service, including a real-time video and/or text chatroom, was founded from London (UK). A number of Latin web portals, websites, and blogs in Latin have developed, like from Russia or from somewhere in the US. The Internet also provides tools like Latin spell checkers for contemporary Latin writers, or scansion tools for contemporary Latin poets. Some websites, such as Google and Facebook, provide Latin as a language option. The HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) camera onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (NASA) has Latin language version of their main site, \`https://uahirise.org/la\`, as well as a Latin Twitter account, \`https://twitter.com/HiRISELatin\`. \`https://ai.neocities.org/Abracadabra.html\` is Mens Latina, an artificial intelligence in Latin. There was a MUD text game in Latin called Labyrinthus Latinus aimed at uniting people interested in the language. In addition, the video games Minecraft, OpenTTD, and The Battle for Wesnoth provide Latin as a language option. There is even a Latin Wikipedia, although discussions are held not only in Latin but in German, English, and other languages as well. Nearly 200 active editors work on the project. There are nearly 100,000 articles on topics ranging from to , , and . Those in particularly good Latin, currently about 10% of the whole, are marked.As of August 2013, there are 94,777 pages, of which about a third are marked as stubs. Among the pages whose Latin has been assessed, 9,658 are marked as having good Latin and just over 500 are marked as poor Latin. In public spaces The ATM with Latin instructions The signs at Wallsend Metro station are in English and Latin as a tribute to Wallsend's role as one of the outposts of the Roman empire. Although less so than in previous eras, contemporary Latin has also been used for public notices in public spaces: The Wallsend Metro station of the Tyne and Wear Metro has signs in Latin. The Vatican City has an automated teller machine with instructions in Latin.

A framed daguerrotype surrounded by a passe-partout Passepartout In the picture framing industry, a mat (or matte, or mount in British English) is a thin, flat piece of paper-based material included within a picture frame, which serves as additional decoration and to perform several other, more practical functions, such as separating the art from the glass. Putting mats in a frame is called matting, a term which can also usually be used interchangeably with mat. The French term, occasionally used in English, is passe-partout (or passepartout). A picture (a photo or print, drawing, etc.) is placed beneath it, with the cutout framing it. The passe-partout serves two purposes: first, to prevent the image from touching the glass, and second, to frame the image and enhance its visual appeal. The cutout in the passe-partout is usually beveled to avoid casting shadows on the picture. The French word may also be used for the tape used to stick the back of the picture to its frame. Functions=Decoration The picture-framing mat is most commonly known by laymen for its use as additional decoration to enhance the look of a framed piece, sometimes in conjunction with a fillet or more rarely, liners made of wooden moulding with a cloth surface. Although matting usually contains only one opening per layer, it may contain none if a picture is \\"float-mounted\\" or \\"top-mounted\\" (placed on top of the mat), and mats with two or more exist, more commonly with photography of the family or pictures of individual family members type than other types of artwork. Typically the mat or mats, if matched carefully and properly proportioned, serve to help draw the eye in towards the framed piece, or towards a particular key element of the piece. However, while the mat is usually regarded as something to complement or set off the artwork to best effect, or not to interfere or compete with it (neutral-colored mats are often preferred by high-end art galleries,) there are some examples of the mat being regarded by the artist as a part of the artwork. Mats can be decorated as described below, used as a surface for the continuation of the artwork within, or can incorporate three-dimensional aspects, though the last two are highly unusual. Mats are fairly adaptable in the visual sense. Since they are typically quite thin (American-made mats are usually 1/16 of an inch thick, for example), they are able to be cut to \\"stack\\" inside of a display, allowing for double, triple or quadruple matting, or even allowing for a fillet in between mats. Mats are available in numerous colors and shades and, less commonly, in preprinted patterns or designs. Mats can easily be found or altered to include further decorative features, such as a cloth covering (most commonly linen or silk, though mats with leather coverings or various other types of cloth covering are also available from some companies) or other decorative coverings or coatings (such as metallic coatings, or textured and patterned coatings that can include rice paper). Because the mat is thin, but not razor-thin, it can also be carved (traditionally by hand, though computerized mat-cutting systems have also been developed), to feature a design, such as lettering or a simple image; since the carving consists mainly of cutting away a small portion of the top decorative layer of the mat, this means that the carved design will show up as the color of the mat's core. (There have been examples of sandpaper being used to sand into the mat and reveal the core, or incisions made into it with the same result.) Most mats are available with a white core, black core, or standard (cream colored) core, but a handful of mats are also available with bright green, red, yellow or blue cores. A mat with several French lines and a watercolor panel. While most mats are generally rectangular in shape, with a rectangular opening, in addition to fairly common oval, oval-apertured mats designed to go with oval frames, there are also very unusual examples of mats in other shapes. Mats are, with very few exceptions,One includes a hand- crocheted mat; the means of assembly is not entirely clear. made of paper- based material. They tend to take well to minor surface additions, including ink and paint (a very wide variety of other media, including fumage, have been used); cloth-covered mats can also have objects such as pins, flags or cloth patches pinned or sewn to them, a technique frequently used in shadowboxing to avoid having to glue items to the backing.\\"Signature mats\\" or \\"autograph mats\\" allow such decoration to take the form of the autographs of guests to a wedding or other special occasion. It is also possible to affix a small metal plate to the surface of a mat. Such plates are typically made of brass, and can also be affixed to the picture frame itself if the frame is made of wood. A common form of decoration on non-cloth coated mats is the French line or line, and the French panel or panel. A French line or line is a line drawn on the mat, usually in ink or paint and usually drawn to form a complete rectangle or square around the opening in the mat. It is used as additional decoration to help draw the eye in towards the center of the display, and can be done in pencil or any color of ink or paint, including metallic inks. A French panel or panel is similar to a French line, with the exception that it is thicker, formed from decorative material ranging from gold leaf to a design in ink or paint. Typically a painted French panel will be done in watercolor, which is also sometimes referred to as a watercolor panel. Similar to a French Line, is a V-Groove. A V-Groove is a thin cut into the mat around the edge of the opening, revealing the core. It is used for much the same purpose as the French Line. The most common used matting has an equal margin all the way around. On artwork with the visual center lower than actual center,.Bottom weighting, or off-sets are also used frequently in matting Bottom weighting, or off-sets are used frequently in matting. The bottom margin are made larger than the side and top margins. When looking at an image, the eyes tend to center higher up than the physical center of the image. By creating a larger bottom margin and off-setting the mat you draw the eye to physical center of the image. Top Center is a subset of bottom weighting where the top and side margins are equal, which creates a visually pleasing effect. This is particularly true in mats where the borders are not equal, such as an 11x14 with an 8x10 opening. Protection In archival or conservation picture framing, mats have several important functions. One of the most important functions is that it separates the glass from the art or document being framed; this is primarily important because any condensation that develops on the inside of the glass can be transferred to the piece if they are not separated, resulting in water damage, mold or mildew. Photos should also be separated from the glass because the surface of photographs is particularly easy to damage, and may even separate from its original paper and stick to the glass if wet; for this reason, any framed photograph of value should be framed in such a way that the glass does not directly contact the photo. Additionally, some types of art, such as pastels or chalk pictures, can smudge easily and should be separated from the glass for that reason. Another major function of the mat in archival framing (where the mats used are made of acid- free and lignin-free paper) comes into play during the mounting process. In archival framing, paper items are not typically glued down to the backing, as it prevents anyone in the future from being able to safely and easily remove it to replace damaged frames, backing or mats, and can make restoration of a damaged document or art piece more difficult. Typically, such items are instead held in place against the backing with mylar \\"photo corners\\" (tiny triangular pockets into which the corners of the paper are put). The added (though slight) weight of mats can help hold a piece in place while also helping to hide the backing and photo corners. In archival framing, the mats are not glued to the piece or backing, but are \\"hinged\\" to the backing with tape, though if more than one mat is used, the mats are typically glued to each other. Acidic vs. \\"acid-free\\" There are two main types of mat material: acidic, and \\"acid-free\\" (neutral pH). Older mats (wood based paper) are typically acidic, because acid-free paper was not widely available or marketed until recent years. While most newer mats are acid-free, there are some papers that contain acid and one should ask the picture framer about the acid content of the mats if the desired life of the piece being framed is more than 75–100 years. The difference is important for the long term protection of the piece because acidic mats can cause what is called mat burn, brown marks that creep in from the outside onto the displayed piece itself. While mat burn is sometimes reversible through cleaning the piece, cleaning may not be feasible if the piece was executed in water-soluble inks or paints, such as watercolor. Thus, it is important to know if the mats used are acid-free if the piece is to be preserved for a long time. To determine the pH of an older mat with a white core, look to see if the core (visible where the mat has already been cut) has turned brownish or yellowed; if so, it is acidic. If the core has not changed color, one can determine the pH by using a pH tester. There are several categories of mat board and they are all separated by the level of protection offered the art work or artifact being framed. While some say that acidic framing materials should be avoided for all but the most temporary frames, it is not safe to say that all \\"acid-free\\" mats are recommended for long term preservation use. The hierarchy of mat board quality is as follows: 1. Museum Board - The highest quality material available. It is constructed of 100% cotton fiber, is Archival and will protect and preserve the contents of a frame. While it is the most expensive material available, the difference in actual material costs relative to the cost of framing is minimal. 2. Museum Mat or Rag Mat - Still a good quality choice for conservation, it is constructed of cotton linters (short cotton fibers) and cellulose (wood pulp) middles. The cellulose is a less expensive raw material but offers sufficient conservation properties for most works. 3. Conservation or Archival Mat Board - Constructed of 100% pure high alpha cellulose (wood pulp) and treated to be inert for up to 300 years. This is the highest quality paper matboard available. 4. Acid-Free or Acid Free Lined - This material is usually lined with a wood based liner on one or both sides that has been treated to prevent \\"short term\\" acid burn - atop a recycled fiber core. Eventually the acid in the core will leach out to the surface which can harm the artwork. Caution must be exercised in selecting the type of framing desired. Art work that is desired to last long term (more than 75 years) can be damaged by improper mat boards that are used intentionally to lower cost. However, non- archival quality mat boards may be suitable for a photographic print, laser print, etc. that is not meant to last long term. Additionally, prints made with traditional chemical processing of photographic film (i.e. dark room development), as opposed to computer printing, are already slightly acidic by nature and therefore are much less likely to be damaged by non-archival mats. In addition, correct \\"conservation\\" framing includes all components, not just the mat board used directly behind the glass. Until recently, there were no truly \\"archival\\"-quality foamcore boards available, though a number of foamcore brands exist with buffered surfaces and the Nielsen Bainbridge company now produces one that is claimed to both block the intrusion of airborne pollutants and to avoid the problem of outgassing that non-archival foamboards may fall prey to; for this reason, and due to many smaller frames' shallow depths, it is not uncommon to see mat boards used as backing for a picture frame as well, though foamcore and mounting boards tend to be stiffer. It is also important, if long-term preservation is of concern, to make sure the framer is using good conservation framing technique. Technology Mats can be cut using computerized mat cutters. These come in a range of sizes and allow mats to be cut with accuracy and precision. This makes it ideal for complex mats, multi-window mats, oval or shaped mats or even bulk mat cutting. Mats (also known as mounts) can also be cut by hand, but this introduces the possibility of human error. Unless specified, the aperture will usually be cut 3 mm over the aperture size, allowing the artwork to sit inside the mat. It is common practice for a backing board to be applied to the back in order to secure the artwork, prior to framing.

The act is composed of Turkish identical twin sisters Didem Balık and Sinem Balık (born May 21, 1974). Didem is a mezzo-soprano while Sinem is a soprano. The sisters, who claim to be the only identical twin opera singers performing professionally, are also known by the nickname \\"the Opera twins.\\" Since 2000, Didem and Sinem have been living and performing in Vienna, Austria.  Early life  Born in İzmir, Turkey, Didem is five minutes older than Sinem. They have three younger brothers. The twin's study of music began when they were only four years old, before they could read and write. Their music teacher taught them musical notation with the help of colors; they remembered that red denoted C, blue D, yellow E, lilac F, and so on. At age of nine, the Balıks left piano playing and dedicated themselves to singing.Newspaper Milliyet September 25, 2006 The twins were educated in the State Conservatory of Dokuz Eylül University in İzmir, and then attended the master classes of Lia Lantieri (1998), Katia Ricciarelli (2000), Dolora Zajick (2000–2003) and Plácido Domingo (2003–2004). Their teachers were Tanju Nebol, Toma Popescu and Francisco Gutierrez. They continued their education in Prayner Conservatory of Vienna in Austria between 2001 and 2003.  Career  Following the graduation from the conservatory in İzmir, they won the audition at the Cemal Reşit Rey Concert Hall in Istanbul and started singing there. In 1999, the twins entered an audition at the Aspendos International Opera and Ballet Festival in Antalya, where they were discovered by Toma Popescu, an expert lecturer in singing at the Vienna Music Academy. After their further education in Vienna, Didem and Sinem gave several concerts in Europe and also in the United States. The Balık sisters wore traditional Turkish clothing kaftan at their appearances with Turkish music. In addition to operas, the sisters sing operettas, Broadway musicals, French melodies, Italian Neapolitans and lieder. In 2001, the sisters were finalists at the \\"4th International de Vivo Voix Competition\\". The sisters performed concerts throughout the world, including; New York, Washington DC, Antalya, Ankara, İstanbul, İzmir, Düsseldorf, Essen, Frankfurt, Galaz and performed at very special venues like Vienna City Hall, United Nations, Hoffburg Palace, Turkish Embassy in Vienna, Düsseldorf Parliament Building, European Parliament and Startmore Music Center. They performed in front of many VIP guests such as Turkish and Austrian Presidents, King of Benin, European MPs, princes and princesses. They have been invited to make guest appearances to many important international festivals. Plácido Domingo said of them “they are perfect for the sister role in Cosi Fan Tutte of Mozart, I see no reason for them not to have a universal career”. After listening to them at a concert in New York, Ahmet Ertegün, the founder of Atlantic Records, suggested that everybody should hear the OperTwins sing and that he was smitten by them. They studied repertoire, technique and interpretation with the famous American Mezzo Soprano Dolora Zajick who said that \\"Opera is one of the highest forms of art and deserves the best best quality artists, and the OperaTwins definitely have this potential\\".

His work is in the permanent collections of the Albright-Knox Gallery of Art, Buffalo, NY; The Getty Study Center, Los Angeles; the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; the Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami; the Frederick R. Weisman Foundation in Los Angeles and Minneapolis; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; and other public, corporate and private collections. Painting Gilbert-Rolfe has shown in New York fairly regularly since 1970, and sporadically elsewhere.Jeremy Gilbert- Rolfe curriculum vitae Regarding the general consensus that describes his work as \\"Geometric Abstraction,\\" Gilbert-Rolfe says he wishes people would think about what he does with the category rather than how his work fits into it. He says he went to an exhibition at the Tate Gallery in London in 1963 to see the Pop art that was in it but what caught his attention instead, causing him to decide he needed to go to America, were the paintings of the New York School and especially and specifically Barnett Newman's Vir Heroicus Sublimis (1951). The space in it felt as active as the space in Howard Hawks’ Red River, which had entered his imagination when he was a child and stayed there. Rachel Kushner discusses his indebtedness to Newman and Hawks, and much else in the work and practice, going on to say that she made an “automatic and instinctive” association of his painting Hottest Part of the Day (2001) with a poem of Sappho's, and that it is her “sense that Gilbert-Rolfe has some uncanny mesh with feminine sensibilities… (His) electric verdure pulses—seductive, then bewildering, then seductive. Boucher, then radiator coolant, then Boucher.” Flattered by Kushner's suggestion, he is however inclined to resist her further suggestion that “A line is a kind of violence, cutting the canvas as though it’s cutting a body. But color is violence as well, if of a soft, smothering sort. A smothering of reason.” Aside from wondering whether a drawn line doesn't only divide but also connect, he is unwilling to accept the smothering of reason part. He says “his paintings are about complexity and as such have come to be about logic as much as anything else. Not logic as in philosophy, logic as in music, where one talks of it making sense but does not mean it provides a riddle and its answer. I want the work to interact with the viewer, to take place in the space around itself and between itself and the person looking at it, and to hold the attention for some time.”Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe, “Statement” http://www.jeremygilbert- rolfe.com/about/ He has also said that seriousness is generally identified with terror, “but I want to identify it with questions of the formless… Art has to put you in touch with something that’s not manageable…. (but) it’s time to get rid of … tough-guy rhetoric about the sublime. Among other things, it would permit us to get closer to the sublime or sublimes that tough guys are too scared to touch.”Bonnie Clearwater, “Interview with Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe” Butler (ed) p.104 As Kushner puts it, “Gilbert-Rolfe … lays out his ante, but never knows where a painting will go.” In 2010 he and Rebecca Norton began to work together as the collaboration Awkward x 2, making paintings together and also writing occasional blogs. Awkward has shown in Brooklyn, Chicago and Louisville to date. Art Criticism and Theory Gilbert-Rolfe writes about art and related topics, including poetry, fiction, fashion, with particular regard to its interaction with photography, technology, and the general state of things in art and how the present situation seems to have emerged. His publications include two anthologies of his essays,Immanence and Contradiction: Recent Essays on the Artistic Device (New York: Out of London Press, 1986). Beyond Piety: Critical Essays on the Visual Arts, 1986-1993 (Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press, 1995). a book about Frank Gehry's architecture co-authored with the architect,With Frank Gehry, Frank Gehry, The City and Music (London and New York: Routledge, 2001). Beauty and the Contemporary Sublime,Beauty and the Contemporary Sublime (New York: Allworth Press, 2000). and other essays and reviews. Beauty and the Contemporary Sublime reformulates the traditional definition of the differential relationship between beauty and the sublime, in which beauty is a sign of the passive and feminine and the sublime of the active and male—heroic or terrifying depending on one’s perspective, or of course both. In Gilbert- Rolfe’s version Winckelmann’s masculine active becomes instead androgynous transitivity, while intransitivity replaces passivity as a still entirely feminine characteristic, the feminine as intransitivity being a sign or force that stands for, or embodies, power as a kind of powerlessness. As well as redefining the differential, Beauty and the Contemporary Sublime’s argument also relocates the sublime from nature to technology, and with it subjectivity, from wherever it imagined itself to be to within techno- capitalism. Here and elsewhere Gilbert-Rolfe suggests that techno-capitalism and the subjectivity that accompanies it are largely made out of all that Heidegger warns against and denounces in his post-war essays on technology, for example the telephone's capacity to sever the mutual dependence of space and time. He has returned to some aspects of this argument in two essays in particular.“Attractiveness and the Uncontrollable, an Update” in Rex Butler, editor, contributions by Rex Butler, Bonnie Clearwater, Penny Florence, and Rachel Kushner Art After Deconstruction: Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe, (Brisbane: Editions 3, 2012) “Uncertainty Prone to Vulgarity” in Temenuga Trifonova, editor, Contemporary Visual Culture and the Sublime (Routledge Advances in Art and Visual Studies) (London and New York: Routledge, 2018) Starting out in Artforum, in 1973, he has written something at least once for most of the art magazines over the years, and more often for Critical Inquiry and Bomb. A founding editor of October, with Rosalind Krauss, Annette Michelson and Lucio Pozzi (who withdrew before the first issue was published,) Gilbert-Rolfe resigned from the journal after the third issue. Honors For painting, Gilbert-Rolfe has been honored by two National Endowment for the Arts fellowships (1979, 1989,) a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship (1997,) the Francis Greenberger Award (2001,) and a Pollock-Krasner Fellowship (2017.) He was awarded an NEA fellowship in criticism in 1974 and was the 1998 recipient of the College Art Association's Frank Jewett Mather Award for Art and Architectural Criticism. Teaching Gilbert-Rolfe retired from teaching at Art Center College of Design in 2015 receiving the title Professor/Chair Emeritus. He had worked there since 1986, when he was hired to develop an MFA program for the school; before that he taught at Princeton and Cal Arts.

Expansion cards could be added to standard 8-bit and 16-bit ISA sockets, which were both on the motherboard, and on an attached expansion board which was supplied as standard. M Series: PC-286 and PC-386 RM released PCs based on Intel 286 and 386 processors under the RM Nimbus name. The PC-286 and early PC-386 versions were termed the M Series due to the MCA bus used, and had a similar case design to that used by later models of the PC-186. S Series: PC-386 and later Later RM PCs using the 386 processor used an ISA bus and were shipped in a particularly (\\"S\\" for) slimline desktop case with only two 3.5\\" drive bays. The processor typically ran at 16 or 25MHz. Later models dropped the Nimbus name, although it was still used late enough to appear on some early (and still ISA-based) 486 models shipped in slightly taller (2 x 5.25\\" bay) cases. By this point, RM's computers were essentially ordinary IBM clones being sold specifically to the education market, with standard processors and buses, operating systems and software, as well as the normal ports (5-pin AT keyboard, 9-pin serial - including the mouse, 15-pin HD-sub VGA - although some 386 models used the less common 9-pin variant, etc), and the previous non-standard holdovers from the Z380 days long since abandoned. Backward compatibility with the PC-186 Despite moving to a standard IBM-compatible architecture from the X series onwards, RM somewhat unusually maintained backwards compatibility with software written for their original Nimbus model by way of a \\"PC186\\" program that could be launched from MS-DOS or via a Windows icon, and would reboot the machine in an operating mode compatible with it. Various configuration options could be set before launch, and returning to normal IBM compatible mode was a simple matter of running the same program again with a particular option switch. It is not clear whether this was purely a software trick using emulation or DOS drivers that provided a compatibility layer between DOS and the old PC186 programs, or something included in the machines' hardware at the BIOS level, but it did take over the computer completely enough that many MS-DOS programs, including Windows, cannot be run whilst in PC186 mode. RM Networks RM Nimbus PCs were usually connected to local area network supplied by RM. The company's initial network solution was RM Net, comprising RM Nimbus PC-186 workstations and servers. Later an RM Nimbus AX or VX became the usual choice of fileserver. PC-186 workstations could be designated as print servers, allowing shared access to printers from all workstations. The network used Microsoft MS-Net server and client software, Zilog Z-Net network interface cards, coaxial cable and BNC connectors. It allowed up to 127 workstations to be connected and booted directly from the network server. Network users could be members of user groups, with each group receiving a customisable menu of programs to execute or a Windows 3.0 desktop, optionally without the 'File' menu in Program Manager. By current standards network security was primitive. RM Net was superseded in the early 1990s by RM Net LM, a network operating system based on Microsoft LAN Manager. RM Net LM retained support for PC-186 workstations, allowing them to boot to MS-DOS and to start Windows 3.0.

German forces, commanded by Otto Skorzeny, were ordered to prepare to conduct a counter- offensive. However they were forced to hold a bridgehead against expected numerically superior forces of the Soviet 2nd Belorussian Front (Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky) for 31 days. Their position was largely ignored during the Red Army's Cottbus-Potsdam Offensive Operation which breached German defenses at Gartz to the north of Schwedt.see map p.162, Le Tissier This was unexpected because it required the Red Army to cross the Randowbruch Swamp that lay between the Oder and Randow rivers. Background The Germans feared that the advancing Red Army would cross the frozen Oder at Schwedt, about 60 miles north-east of Berlin. The Commander-in-chief of Army Group Vistula, Heinrich Himmler, was planning a counter-offensive from Schwedt. On January 30, 1945, he ordered SS-Standartenführer Otto Skorzeny to prepare for the offensive. Preparations The rapid advance of the Red Army meant that when Skorzeny set up his command post on the right bank of the Oder in Niederkränig (some three kilometers south-east of Schwedt), rather than preparing for a counter-offensive, he was forced to order that the first week be spent by troops of the newly created 11th Armyp.593, Glantz preparing fortified positions while others were concentrated for the offensive. The position was prepared according to typical Wehrmacht doctrine some 20 km forward of the river, and strengthened with machine gun nests and reinforced trenches. Despite ostensibly preparing for an offensive, the 3rd Panzer Army troops, including the X SS Corps, were short of supplies and weapons, lacking heavy machine guns and artillery. Makeshift artillery was produced by mounting anti- aircraft guns on trucks. It proved useful in harassing the Red Army's 61st Army by giving them the impression that the Germans had large artillery units. After the ice on the Oder was blown up by pioneers to make crossing more difficult for the advancing Red Army tanks, a similar strategy was employed using guns mounted on river barges. Skorzeny later credited this use of mobile artillery with gaining enough time to sufficiently fortify the bridgehead. The initial troops began to arrive early in February from the Courland Pocket, they included the 4th Panzer Division, the 32nd and 227th Infantry divisions, elements of the XVI SS Corps, and other SS units.p.584, Glantz Battle at the bridgehead The first encounter battles were between the screening German infantry, and the 2nd Guards Tank Army on 28 January, which \\"was pouring now like a torrent north of [the] Netze River towards Küstrin\\", when elements of the 9th Guards Tank Corps probed the positions of Kampfgruppe Voigt (Generalmajor Adolf Voigt) east of Pyritz and 18 km east of Schwedt. As the 2nd Guards Tank Army turned towards Küstrin, the encounters between patrols from the German 56th Jäger Regiment (CI Army Corps) and the Red Army's 89th Rifle Corps on February 1 intensified.p.161, Le Tissier As of February 5 the number of Red and Polish Armies' forces had grown so much that German probes behind enemy lines were no longer possible. Once the 2nd Belorussian Front troops had captured the railway in Bad Schönfliess, they received a steady flow of reinforcements by train. However, unbeknown to Skorzeny, the Red Army reinforcements were those belonging to the 61st Army and the 1st Polish Army of the 1st Belorussian Front's northern flank. They had orders to bypass Schwedt and attack in the direction of Eberswalde. They also masked the movement of the 2nd Belorussian Front's 49th Army which would attack north of Schwedt. Extensive deception operations, and the rapid tempo of advancepp.527-528, Glantz (1) meant that the German command was largely unaware of the switch in forces, or the true direction of the impending assaults. For much of the time they were under the impression they were facing a major armored thrust while the 2nd Guards Tank Army was replaced in line by the 5th Shock Army, including the preparation of 136 T-34 mock-ups.see map on p.530, p.531, Glantz (1) These deceptive measures were hampered by the previous deception conducted by Zhukov in the final stage of the Vistula-Oder Strategic Offensive Operation. After fighting to the north of their position, the 9th Army, which had replaced the 3rd Panzer Army, had to fall back from its forward defenses and on February 7 the evacuation of all villages outside the bridgehead began. Two Red Army battalions supported by T-34 tanks conducted a daily reconnaissance in force as this evacuation took place. On March 3 9th German Army forces abandoned the Schwedt bridgehead, having fruitlessly awaited the orders for a counter-offensive and not having witnessed the expected Soviet attack on their positions for over a month, had assumed new positions on the western banks of the Oder. Aftermath The Soviets captured Schwedt on 26 April after German troops had withdrawn to avoid encirclement following the commencement of the Cottbus-Potsdam Offensive Operation on the 19 April; by then the city was severely damaged.Märkische Oderzeitung, \\"Schwedt war menschenleer\\", 27. April 2005 address by the mayor of Schwedt in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the end of the Second World War The commander of the XI SS Panzer Corps later stated that there was no strategic purpose in the defense of the bridgehead, but that it served a tactical defensive role and misled the advancing Soviet armies into believing that the Germans were preparing a counter-offensive.Otto Skorzeny: Meine Kommandounternehmen: Krieg ohne Fronten , Limes Verlag, Wiesbaden und München 1977, 3.

She was actively engaged in the workshop of her husband, Pieter Coecke van Aelst, posthumously publishing his works. While she is recognized as an exceptionally skilled artist, little is known about her works or life as there are few surviving attributable sources of information. Life Mayken Verhulst was born in Mechelen in 1518. She was the second wife of the painter Pieter Coecke van Aelst, and the mother-in-law of Pieter Brueghel the Elder, and, according to Karel van Mander, the first teacher of her grandsons Pieter Brueghel the Younger and Jan Brueghel the Elder. Her sister Lysbeth was married to the engraver and painter Hubert Goltzius, and her sister Barbara was married to the painter Jacob de Punder. According to Slater (2019), she died in Brussels in 1596, approximately eighty years old., but most authority notices state that she died in Malines in 1599. Works Following Pieter Coecke's death in 1550, she likely oversaw the publication of a large woodcut series Ces Moeurs et Fachons de Faire des Turcz (Manners and Customs of the Turks) (1553).Op de Beeck, passim; also see, \\"Woodcut\\". This print was originally designed by van Aelst as a tapestry design, strategically published by Verhulst as a print after his death to showcase his work. Additionally, she waited until about twenty years following her husband's death to publicize his legacy, argued by Di Furia as an intentional decision meant to honor Charles V, a great admirer of Turkish culture, as he withdrew from public service in 1555. Thus, Verhulst displayed great agency through her strategy, independence, and creativity. No works survive that can be securely attributed to Verhulst, although she is frequently identified as the person behind several works assigned to the Master of the Brunswick Monogram.Bergmans, passim. This is mentioned by most subsequent studies about Verhulst although always with conditions. Verhulst may also have been the author of a painting in the Kunsthaus Zürich with a self-portrait with her husband (panel, 50.5 x 59 cm).King, p. 394 Legacy= Status  While little is definitively known about her life and works, Guicciardini's Descrittione places her alongside Susanna Horenbout, Levina Teerlinc, and Caterina van Hemessen, suggesting her remarkable talents.  Impact  Verhulst was the first teacher of her grandsons, Pieter Brueghal the Younger and Jan Brueghal the Elder, both of which are prolific Northern Renaissance Master painters. Ironically, her close relation to such prominent artists has muted her long- lasting effect on art history, as she is most often mentioned within discussions of their heritage as opposed to her accomplishments. Published by Mayken Verhulst, her husband's composition Ces Moeurs et fachons de faire de Turcz now resides at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, evidencing her significant impact on Northern Renaissance printmaking.  Surviving artifacts  Her house and former painter's workshop, is a historic monument in Mechelen. It is a museum named . Zurich's Kunstaus houses the only possible surviving portrait of Verhulst.

The programme follows the adventures of KENT, the Key Environmental Non-judgmental Taskforce, a desperately underfunded Government organisation dedicated to protecting the environment and doing laundry in a post-apocalyptic world following a terrible eco-disaster known as the Withering. KENT=Professor Nebulous Played by Mark Gatiss, Professor (Boffo) Nebulous is the protagonist of Nebulous, a brilliant scientist and the unappreciated leader of KENT whose downfall is a direct result of his destruction of the Isle of Wight while he was moving it slightly to the left by 10 kilometres to give it more sun on Janril 57, 2069, destroying everyone on the island. He is often prone to going off on long metaphorical tangents while discussing the current crisis, only to stop himself and say \\"I'm drifting\\" when he goes too far. His nickname at school was \\"NOBulous\\". Nebulous's past is shown by brief flashbacks triggered by the word \\"clown\\" (or even words that sound like \\"Clown\\"; on one occasion a flashback was just triggered by the word \\"Cloud\\"). Nebulous's scientific bent and serious demeanour are explained by Nebulous's parents who both forced him to become a circus clown at the expense of his scientific studies. Although his reputation has suffered greatly due to the destruction of the Isle of Wight, Nebulous has made several prominent discoveries in his career, such as a cure for blindness and a sandwich that cures cancer (Marmalade and cucumber, apparently), as well as continuing to defend Earth despite the poor funding available to him. He also has an evil twin brother called Professor Spiffo Nebulous, who is his physical double apart from having a moustache, being somewhat overweight, and lacking both thumbs (due to a freak Game Boy accident). The twins had a dimmer brother named Mofo, whom Spiffo killed in a knife-throwing incident. Originally Nebulous was happy being a clown and put all his time and effort into it, until he met his future self, who convinced him to become a scientist.  Paula Breeze  Played by Rosie Cavaliero, Paula Breeze is the ditsy assistant to Professor Nebulous, although how she qualified for a position in such an organisation given her apparent lack of any degree at all is a mystery. Paula is constantly pursuing her infatuation with Nebulous, despite him not noticing; any attempts that may actually get anywhere are always ended by her own idiocy. Although she commonly comes across as an infatuated idiot, she is clearly devoted to Professor Nebulous, and has managed to come up with some relatively good ideas when under pressure. It was eventually revealed that she is actually a human/Atlantean hybrid and the heir to the throne of Atlantis--having grown up in an orphanage, she apparently assumed that the nuns were her real parents and she had forty-five brothers and sisters, but she turned down her mother's offer to take the throne at the time to remain with Nebulous.  Rory Lawson  Played by Graham Duff, Rory Lawson is Professor Nebulous' other assistant, the self-professed ladies' man of the team (although his only successful romantic liaison was with Paula when both of them were drunk and 1/4 of an alien senturian from the 9th galactic sector whilst at Woodstock during Hendrix's set) who handles the more physical side of operations. Having taken an evening class in Media Studies and Applied Thinking, Rory yearns for the covert ops action and explosive confrontations of a top profile Government Agent but has to make do with aiding the team in cleaning clothes and repairing tumble driers. He appears to be somewhat more intelligent than Paula, having apparently blown up Buckingham Palace during his chemistry class at school (Although in his defence he claims that the building was already scheduled for demolition and the Royal Family were away at the time). His catchphrase is \\"Bollocks!... Sir\\". Harry Hayes Played by Paul Putner, Harry Hayes is the fourth member of KENT, responsible for technological development. Though previously a handsome physically spectacular specimen of a man, he was badly injured when Professor Nebulous disintegrated the Isle of Wight, having entered the unshielded control room to try and reverse the process and being badly injured in the resulting blast. He was rebuilt by the Professor and lives his life in constant agony while trundling around in a wheelchair constructed from old kitchen units, though in recent episodes the Professor has given him a new hover chair with slat grates that allow him access to everywhere he could want to go (Which just annoys Harry more as he has less to moan about now). Harry often ends up reminding everyone that while most members of KENT have minor problems, he suffers more than anyone, such as commenting that Paula was just suffering from \\"some minor agony\\". He is also afflicted by a faulty electronic voice box that plays his voice at an unbearably high volume, but Nebulous's guilt over the accident prevents him from asking Harry to turn it down. Each episode features him saying, at least once, \\"UNLIKE YOU, PROFESSOR, I NO LONGER HAVE THE LUXURY OF [Insert bodypart of choice here]\\"; so far, he has claimed to have lost his chin, mouth, nose, eyes (with his optical scanners apparently processing the information and presenting it as a pie chart for some reason), hands (he initially claimed to retain one but more recently has stated that he only has a mechanical grabber), feelings, toes (all ten, which he now keeps in a jar), both legs, upper lip (although he retains the lower one), heart, fingers, nerves, head (Although Nebulous notes that Harry retains most of his head), brain (replaced with a chip that apparently causes him headaches), back (although he does have a hunch), arse (he mentioned that he has rented one from an unidentified source), spleen, heart, eye-teeth and normal teeth. However, he does still have his inner ear, albeit with his inner ear now an outer ear located on his neck. Commonly, Harry remains at KENT HQ during the team's missions, although he has departed it on some occasions, such as when he reinvented the vacuum cleaner. Despite his betrayal of the team at the end of series one to aid Doctor Klench, Harry has been forgiven by Nebulous in series two, apparently recognising that Nebulous at least respects him as a scientist unlike Klench's contempt for him as a physical presence. Gemini Gemini, played by Julia Dalkin, is the AI of KENT and the narrator of the title sequence and the ending credits. Although supposed to have the combined intelligence of three Oxford dons and a supply teacher, Gemini has failed a number of times, at one point switching off KENT's oxygen supply. The name suggests that there is a counterpart somewhere, but the only reference to this counterpart so far has been a brief comment about Gemini's evil twin, who was once sent to KENT on a weekend exchange program that the team prefer not to think about. (The character was originally called Gemini as it was intended to have two personalities and two voices; one male and one female. Whilst the idea was dropped, the name remained) Sir Ronald Rowlands Played by Graham Crowden, Ronald Rowlands is a Minister with Unusual Portfolio, KENT's attaché to the Government. Rowlands always pronounces Nebulous's name \\"Nebelarse\\" and cares little for KENT, commonly stating \\"I'd like to do what I can, but afraid I can't\\" and would be perfectly happy to close the organisation down if given the opportunity (This would appear to be a result of the destruction of the Isle of Wight, as he was perfectly happy to help Nebulous's younger self when Nebulous briefly time travelled into his own past), keeping them open only so long as they can prove their worth (Albeit mainly by doing his laundry). He was recently forced to invest in the organization when Nebulous realized that Rowlands had been using time travel to buy shares in companies that would succeed in the future, Nebulous blackmailing Rowlands into providing KENT with more funding or Nebulous would reveal his actions to the government. Other characters=Erica Flazenby Played by Julia Deakin, Doctor Erica Flazenby is the rival and former love of Nebulous who is currently the director of LOUGHBOROUGH. The two met while at the Oxford University Islands and shared an apartment for a year, before breaking up under unrevealed circumstances, although their conversations when they reunited would suggest that deeper feelings remain on both sides. At the last moment, Erica Flazenby's name was changed from Erica Moody to its present form; the error remained in the press release from the BBC announcing the series debut., The Tertiary Control Room, 2004-12-02. Doctor Klench Played by David Warner, Dr Joseph Klench is the arch-enemy of Professor Nebulous and KENT whom the Professor describes as \\"a chap who came to a crossroads in life and took a turning marked evil. He put his foot to the accelerator and he's not stopping\\". His plans to date have included luring a sentient cactus to Earth, destroying the world with a stolen star fragment, destroying the Intergalactic peace conference while in Nebulous' body, trapping Nebulous in the past at the moment he destroyed the Isle of Wight, and provoking a war between the surface world and Atlantis, although all five attempts have been thwarted by the Professor and the KENT team. Nebulous has claimed that he and Klench are in many ways rather alike, reflecting that they might have been friends or even Siamese twins in another life, although Klench has only ever expressed contempt for Nebulous, refusing even to tell Nebulous his plan on the grounds that he wasn't interested in hearing Nebulous's snide comments. Klench also parodies the Master from Doctor Who: like the Master he miniaturises his enemies, although—unlike the Master—rather than killing them, he carries them around in his suitcase to remind him of his power. Nebulous's parents Played by Matt Wolf and Julia Dalkin, Nebulous's parents appear only in flashbacks (although a shape-shifting alien recently posed as Nebulous's father while trying to escape a prison ship); in each episode Nebulous has a flashback to his childhood, in which his parents wanted him to become a clown and ignored such major scientific discoveries as his cure for blindness. Nebulous commonly awakes from these flashbacks saying \\"I shall not clown\\". To date, only Nebulous's former fiancée Erica Flazenby has demonstrated an awareness that Nebulous has these flashbacks, as he commonly attempts to pass them off with such comments as \\"Haven't you ever seen a man collapse before?\\" without admitting that he has a problem. The evidence would also suggest that only Erica is actually aware of Nebulous's difficult relationship with his parents; although Paula is aware of Nebulous's childhood in the circus after a time-travelling experience took them back to the Professor's childhood, and Harry mentioned that Nebulous's old reputation was based on the inspirational idea of him going from a clown to become a scientific genius, neither of them appear to be aware of the full details of what his life was like as he grew up. It was revealed that they had two other children, Spiffo and Mofo Nebulous, with the Nebulous we know being \\"Boffo\\", but Mofo was killed by Spiffo during a knife-throwing \\"trick\\" while they were children and Spiffo was later sentenced to an infinite life sentence in Biros Optimum Security Prison (How the parents reacted to this is unknown). Subsequent episodes revealed that they eventually disowned Nebulous due to his continued interest in the sciences, and he apparently has never seen them since The Infernons The Infernons are a race of aliens made out of fire (the name Infernon comes from Inferno) from the planet Burnos. Because they are made out of fire, they have to cover themselves with black metallic cloaks. If they are stoked regularly, an Infernon can live almost indefinitely, but the race is nearly extinct due to the Great Crazy Foam Monsoon of 2095. They are minor villains in the series who have appeared twice so far. They first appeared in series two when they helped Dr. Klench on the agreement that Klench would help let their race survive, and then in series three the Infernons helped a history lecturer destroy the past so there was less to teach. The Infernons appear to know little about how the human body works, as is evidenced by Nebulous tricking them into thinking they live via photosynthesis.

In the 1970s, he was the lead singer with the British rock band London.Spicer, Al, (2006) The Rough Guide to Punk, Rough Guides Ltd, , p. 155 Afterwards he went on to write comedy plays for the stage. He has also written scripts for Frankie Howerd, including the television special Superfrank! and the stage comedy Up Pompeii! Rock musician In 1976, with drummer Jon Moss, guitarist Dave Wight (real name Colin Wight) and bassist Steve Voice, Tredinnick formed the punk band London.Rimmer, Dave (1985) Like Punk Never Happened, Faber and Faber, , p. 40-42 He was the lead singer Riff Regan. The band came to the notice of Danny Morgan who was a talent scout for ex-Yardbirds and ex-Marc Bolan manager Simon Napier-Bell.Napier-Bell, Simon (2001) Black Vinyl White Powder, Ebury Press, , p. 163 He secured them a record deal with MCA Records and a nationwide tour supporting The Stranglers. Their singles \\"Everyone’s A Winner\\", \\"Summer of Love\\"/\\"Friday on My Mind\\" and \\"Animal Games\\" and their one and only album Animal Games were all produced by Napier-Bell at the IBC Studios in London. Their recording of \\"Friday on My Mind\\" was made in the same studio that The Easybeats had made the original. Although London had a popular live stage act, ticket sales never transformed into record sales. This was despite flamboyant film director Mike Mansfield directing the video for \\"Everyone's A Winner\\". The highest UK chart position they reached was 52 for their EP Summer of Love. Jon Moss was particularly impatient to have chart success and following a nationwide tour the band decided to call it a day. They broke up after a farewell gig at the Marquee Club in Wardour Street. Jon Moss joined The Damned and later formed Culture Club with Boy George; Colin Wight became a Professor in International Politics; Steve Voice formed The Original Vampires; Simon Napier-Bell went on to manage George Michael and Wham!. Tredinnick, as Riff Regan, released four more singles on MCA Records; \\"All The Nice Boys And Girls in the World\\" (produced by Napier-Bell), \\"Japanese Girls\\" (produced by Andy Miller), \\"You Call Me Lucky\\" and \\"The Only One\\" (both produced by Liam Sternberg) before recording \\"Hard Hearts Don’t Cry\\" (produced by Andy Miller) on Epic Records in 1981. In August 2015 his first solo album Milestones was released on Beach Café Records. In 1997, Captain Oi! Records released a best of London CD called London The Punk Rock Collection. It contains all the band's MCA recordings. Tredinnick also co-wrote the song \\"Hottest Woman in Town\\" with Andy Miller in 1982. Recorded at London's Trident Studios by ex- Ozzy Osbourne and Ian Gillan lead guitarist Bernie Torme, it was released as a single and featured on the \\"Metal Killers\\" album. In 2007 he reformed London with original bass player Steve Voice and new guitarist Hugh O'Donnell and new drummer Colin Watterston. The band played their first London gig in over 30 years at the 12 Bar Club in Soho, London on Saturday 23 February 2008. Reboot, their first studio album in 34 years, was released in February 2012 and The Hell for Leather Mob album was released in July 2020. Theatre and television Tredinnick's first stage play, Because of Mr Darrow, was produced at the Finborough Theatre in London and his second comedy Laugh? I Nearly Went To Miami! had a successful fringe run at the Pentameters Theatre in Hampstead. The latter was later produced for the first Liverpool Festival of Comedy. In translation, Laugh? I Nearly Went To Miami! has been produced in many cities, including Vienna, where its title was ...Und Morgen Fliegen Wir Nach Miami. British Director Cyril Frankel directed with German translation by Adolf Opel. In 1990, Tredinnick wrote the stage thriller Twist. This was translated into German by Ursula Grutzmacher-Tabori under the title Der Letzte Dreh and was later produced in London under the title Getting Away with Murder at the Pentameters Theatre in Hampstead. The play had its US debut in Taunton, Massachusetts in 2010 and an acting edition was published by Josef Weinberger Plays in 2019. His next stage comedy was It's Now Or Never! in 1994. Directed by Marina Calderone at the Queen's Theatre, Hornchurch, England, it starred Tony Roper, Peter Polycarpou and Leyton Sommers as Elvis Presley. A German version, Jetzt Oder Nie, translated by Christian Wolffer has been successful as has a Dutch version translated by Martine Deboosere. Topless, a one-woman play set on an open-top London sightseeing bus, followed in 1999. Produced by The Big Bus Company, this unique theatrical piece was actually performed, with audience, on top of a sightseeing bus driving through the streets of the West End of London. This was followed by Topless in Philadelphia (2009) featuring a male tour guide giving an open-top bus tour in America's most historical city and then Topless in Sydney (2014) and Topless in Las Vegas (2018). Frankie Howerd From 1985 to 1992 Tredinnick wrote regular stage and television scripts for Frankie Howerd including co-writing the hour long special, Superfrank! for Channel 4. He also wrote an updated stage version of Up Pompeii! although a proposed tour was put on the shelf when Howerd was offered a chance by Larry Gelbart to reprise his role as Pseudolus in A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum at the Piccadilly Theatre in London's West End. The new play, now revised and updated, received its premiere in Chesterfield in January 2011 before embarking on a UK tour. Produced and directed by Bruce James, it starred Damian Williams, host of Sky One's Are You Smarter Than A Ten Year Old?, as Lurcio the slave. An acting edition of the play was published by Josef Weinberger Ltd in 2012. Television In 1987/8 Tredinnick created and wrote the BBC1 comedy series Wyatt's Watchdogs.Lewisohn, Mark (1998) Radio Times Guide to TV Comedy, BBC Books, , p. 730Taylor, Rod (1994) The Guinness Book of Sitcoms, Guinness Publishing, , p. 276 Produced and directed by Alan J W Bell, it starred Brian Wilde and Trevor Bannister.

He was one of the most successful Cocoa merchants from western Nigeria. He was also a community leader, who had invested time and energy in creating various community development programs in Ilesha. During the 1960s, he founded the Ijesa Planning Council, an association that was interested in promoting industrial development in Ijesa land. In 1978, the effort of another collective, resulted in the establishment of the International Breweries, Ilesha. The brewery is seen as one of the successful benchmarks of a collective methodical plan and execution of an industrial project in the country. Life Omole's father, Abdul-Raheem Omole worked in the railways and retired as a foreman and subsequently, became a farmer. From 1928 to 1935, Omole worked on his father's farm in Ilesha. Thereafter, he left farming and was employed as a produce clerk for some produce buyers. In 1945, he became a produce depot buyer with the United African Company. He made gains in 1947 when he stockpiled Cocoa against rising prices and then bought his first lorry, however, his interest in expanding was discouraged by UAC which did not want him to expand beyond certain limits. He subsequently left UAC and joined a regional produce syndicate. In 1951, he started a transport company which covered Ilesha-Ibadan-Lagos routes. Three years later he started an independent produce buying firm and merged both his transport firm and his produce firm to form Omole & sons Limited in 1957.http://www.ngrguardiannews.com/2015/03/lawrence-omole-the-industrialist- who-loved-both-christians-and-muslims/ Lawrence Omole also ran multiple businesses including a car sales company, and a housing service. Though born into poverty, Omole was able to convert his fortunes during his lifetime. He died after observing his regular morning devotion. ReferencesFurther reading *Omole, L. (1991).

An early admirer of comics she begun creating them at a young age. L'Oie de Cravan published her first book Lait Frappé in 2000. By 2004 she had released three more books—Die Fabrik, Roulatheque Roulatheque Nicolore and Pamplemoussi. The latter is considered her artistic breakthrough. Her 2012 book, Susceptible gave her international success and was followed by a book of poems in French entitled Maman Sauvage in 2015. Her next two works A Bubble and Maman Apprivoisée were both released posthumously. She also recorded a total of eight albums under the name Woelv and Ô PAON. In 2003, Castrée met musicain Phil Elverum. The two married the year after. In 2015 she gave birth to her first child. Also that year she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and would die to it a year later. Elverum would go onto release a series of albums centered around her life and death. Early Life Pictured:Loretteville where Castrée was born. Geneviève Gosselin was born in Loretteville, Quebec.Adam Baumgold Gallery. March 20, 2008. Retrieved 2010-04-18. She grew up reading Tintin comics from an early age, so much so that she eventually entered, studied for, and won a Tintin competition. She was drawing comics influenced by artists she loved from an early age; these include: Hergé, Renée French, Chester Brown, Julie Doucet, and Argentinian artist Quino. Doucet, in particular had a significant influence on Castrée, influencing her character design and lettering style. When Gosselin was five her father left her and her mother. At age fifteen Gosselin travelled around Canada and reunited with her absentee father. Although their relationship was strained Gosselin's father did build her a log cabin to live in. In her teens, Gosselin, without formal training, began her cartooning career, publishing minicomics and adopting the name Geneviève Castrée. Gosselin had a troubled relationship with her mother experiencing both a deep connection and feelings of alienation and belittlement. Her relationship with her father was less contentious but also less intimate.  Career = Artistry  In 2000, Montreal publisher L'Oie de Cravan published her first book Lait Frappé, followed by Die Fabrik that same year and Roulatheque Roulatheque Nicolore in 2001, but it was Pamplemoussi in 2004 that served as her artistic breakthrough. The release marked her first major movement to integrate her music and visual art into one cohesive practice. In 2012, Castrée released Susceptible, a graphic novel that chronicled Castrée's childhood growing up in Quebec through the character of Goglu, Castrée's childhood nickname. It was released to critical acclaim and saw her achieve international success; as well as helping her feel \\"unburdened\\" by her memories of her mother. In 2015, Maman Sauvage a book of poems in French detailing Castrée's feelings as a mother was published by L'oie De Cravan under the name Geneviève Elverum. Following her death, Castrée was included in The Best American Comics 2016, edited by Roz Chast. In 2017 her final book A Bubble was posthumously published by Drawn & Quarterly, having been completed by Portland artist Anders Nilsen and Elverum. They were initially weary about finishing it but concluded that it would be better for the book to be in a state of \\"easy readability rather than burden it with the awkward unfinished look, too cloaked in its context to be functional as a standalone thing.\\" Castrée left instructions for its creation after her death. According to Elverum, she worked on it until her \\"literal final days\\". The book was created for her daughter as a gift, although she did intend for it to be published, and centers around their relationship and Castrée's struggle with cancer which she compares to living in a bubble. It features little text and is told via an image per page. It concludes with an afterword by Elverum. Elverum noted that its creation was Castrée's way of coping. A book of poems entitled Maman Apprivoisée was released in 2018. It consits of 44 poems both written in French and English. It deals with her feelings surrounding her giving birth in 2015, and being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Elverum has said that he is putting together a book of poems by her as well as a monograph of her illustrations.  Musical career  Pictured: Hotel2Tango where she recorded her album Courses. A self taught musician, Castrée's first release was an accompanying LP to her 2004 book Pamplemoussi. Recorded and mixed by Thomas Shields and Matt Skillings of the Band Run Chico Run. The two artits provided many of the instruments and backing tracks to the Album, as well as musical training and financing for the recording. The Album was recorded and Mixed in Victoria BC. it is lo-fi in nature with Castrée singing in French over \\"childlike\\" instruments, such as a keyboard and recorder. Under the name Woelv she released the 2006 EP, Gris, via Elverum’s label P.W. Elverum & Sun, Ltd. Gris saw her expand on her already established lo-fi sound. Her final release under the Woelv name came in 2007 as Tout Seul Dans La Forêt En Plein Jour, Avez-vous Peur? (translated as Alone in the Forest in the Middle of the Day, Are You Scared?). The album was recorded in Olympia, Washington on K Records with Elverum once again involved. In 2009 she established her own label and began releasing music under the name Ô Paon. In 2010 she released an LP Courses, recorded at Hotel2Tango, Montreal with Thierry Amar, and in 2015 released Fleuve, recoded with Phil Elverum and featuring Nicholas Krgovich and Lori Goldston. Castrée's also made appearances on recordings by Mount Eerie, Thanksgiving, Karl Blau, D+ and Aidan Baker. Her and Elverum helped create the What The Heck Fest. She released a total of eight albums, under both names.  Themes and style  Castrée's literary work often dealt with topics such as, loyalty, her relationship with her parents and childhood abuse. They were typically of a discreet nature, and often eschewed typical comics paneling, alongside using negative space and open page layouts, among other techniques. It featured a meticulous, folk art style that made heavy use of vibrant color. Her characters were often expressive, being described as \\"fragile\\" and \\"broken\\", and were drawn with \\"wiggly\\" arms and \\"bending\\" legs. Themes such as sorrow and elation were present throughout her work in a symbiotic manner.  Personal life  Castrée was married to musician Phil Elverum, who has released music as the Microphones and Mount Eerie. They met in 2003 and married in 2004. They originally intended to move to Canada but after searching for residency decided to remain in the United States, in the town Anacortes, Washington. Castrée was also close friends with musician Lori Goldston and poet Joanne Kyger. French was Castrée's dominant language. She was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2015, shortly after the birth of her and Elverum's only child. In June 2016, a GoFundMe account was set up by Elverum to assist with their finances. She died on July 9, 2016. Her husband soon posted an update: \\"She died at home with me and her parents holding her, hopefully having reached some last minute peace\\".  Legacy  Following her death, Elverum released three albums, A Crow Looked at Me, Now Only and Lost Wisdom pt. 2 chronicling her life and mourning her death. Katherine Paul's debut album Mother of My Children was inspired by Castrée's death, who she described as her \\"mentor\\". Clyde Petersen was inspired by Castrée's death to release an album he had recorded while briefly housing-sitting for Castrée and Elverum. Other artists paid tribute to her, Anders Nilsen called her \\"one of my favorite people in the world and one of my favorite artists\\". Former publisher Chris Oliveros, expressed graditude and pride to have worked with her and published her works.

The station has its head office based in Bridgend, Wales, and provides a broad mix of programming available worldwide in live, on-demand and downloadable formats. Celtica Radio started broadcasting on 21 June 2000, and is still in the same ownership. In the year 2012 Celtica Radio logged over one and three-quarter million listeners, and achieved over 54,000 podcast downloads. Since November 2012, around 300,000 listeners a month tune into Celtica Radio. On April 23, 2011, the station started broadcasting through the transmitters of Radio Hafren on 756 kHz Medium Wave, until February 10, 2015 when Radio Hafren closed. The broadcasts were for two hours per night, every night from Midnight to 2 AM local time. Distance or DX listeners who provided a reception report were sent by return of post a QSL card. Radio Hafren began FM broadcasts on 102.1 MHz FM at 10:21 am on Monday, August 11, 2014. Celtica Radio programs on that frequency started at Midnight on Tuesday August 12. History The Celtica Radio story goes back to 1979 when a small group of people in the Bridgend area of South Wales wanted to set up their own wholly independent radio station. Over the following eighteen years the evolution of the group continued, with the establishment of two hospital radio stations in Bridgend and Neath, the re-launch of broadcasting at Swansea University, and two trial broadcasts in 1997 and 1998, culminating in a successful campaign to persuade the licensing authorities that the Bridgend region and community deserved its own local radio station. Leading this group of committed local radio enthusiasts and professionals was Bill Everatt. The UK Radio Authority (which has now been replaced by OfCom) did not give that group the chance of broadcasting to their home area. This decision had the effect of stiffening the resolve of those who had been denied this local radio station licence, and led to David A Cook who had also worked on the campaign, providing the initial financial investment to set up Celtica Radio and its parent company AlBilCo MediaComm. Initially, the business structure was as an unincorporated association, but in 2003, both Celtica Radio and AlBilCo MediaComm became registered limited companies. The station has now expanded and the original group of broadcasters has been joined by others from other parts of the UK and Europe. From 2005 to 2008, John Grierson, the founder and first general manager of Manx Radio, the Isle of Mans national commercial radio station, also broadcast with and advised the group. Location The Celtica Radio Group is mainly based in South Wales, and makes programmes from a matrix of nine purpose-built, private studios. Many Celtica Radio contributors are established broadcasters, and have acknowledged track records in the radio industry. All key personnel are experts in their particular field of audio production, broadcasting or radio-related engineering. The station's servers are located at the Red Bus Data Centre at the prestigious Canary Wharf development in London. The station is an official Partner organisation of Bridgend County Borough Council Arts and Culture Directorate. Airplay Celtica Radio are not members of PRS, MCPS, PPL or any of their foreign affiliates. All the music the station transmits is out of the jurisdiction of any of the above organisations. Artists who contact the station for promotional airplay will need to visit the Playlists page and agree to the terms and conditions. All shows are downloadable as Free Podcasts and also available on iTunes, and the programmes are usually over an hour in duration. In July 2007, Celtica Radio started being listed on the Reciva Internet Radio Network which allows their broadcasts to be heard without a PC for the first time. From September 2008 to December 2008, certain programmes were broadcast on the English Language service of Radio Waddenzee. The broadcasts were transmitted late at night and took advantage of groundwave propagation and skywave refraction off the ionosphere. These characteristics ensured that the broadcasts could be received throughout Central Europe and the East Coast of the UK on 1602 kHz Medium Wave. The station identified itself as Celtica Radio, broadcasting from the Lightship Jenni Baynton through the transmitters of Radio Seagull. Due to significant developments with the company’s financial backers in November 2009, the station launched a live internet streaming service of original programming twenty-fours hour a day from their own studios, this channel also has a low bitrate multi-media feed which can be received on all smart phones. The exact nature of the financial development has not been made public.

At its fourth meeting in 1885, the fledgling organization adopted the name Coast Sailor's Union and elected George Thompson its first president. Andrew Furuseth, who had joined the union on June 3, 1885 was elected to its highest office in January 1887. In 1889 he returned to sea but was reelected to the position of union secretary in 1891. It was during this term on July 29, 1891 that Furuseth merged the Coast Seamen's Union with the Steamship Sailor's Union with the new organization named the Sailors' Union of the Pacific. With the exception of a two-year period when he shipped out as a fisherman, he was secretary of the SUP until 1935. In 1908, Furuseth also became president of the International Seamen's Union and served in that office until 1938. During this period, he successfully pushed for legislative reforms that eventually became the Seamen's Act of 1915. SUP is an affiliate union of Seafarers International Union of North America. Headquarters are in San Francisco and the union has branch offices in Wilmington, California, Seattle, Washington, and Honolulu, Hawaii. SUP also has an office in Norfolk, Virginia.

He has won 10 titles on the regular PBA Tour (including one major), and 12 more on the PBA50 Tour (formerly PBA Senior Tour). He currently resides in King, North Carolina. PBA career Baker had his best pro season in 1981, winning three titles and over $103,000 that season. By 1986, he had won 7 PBA titles before going on a 10-year winless streak, partially due to recurring wrist injuries. In 1996, he returned to the winner's circle at the AC-Delco Classic, and won again in 1997 in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. After another 7-year drought, he shocked the bowling world by winning the 2004 PBA World Championship at age 49. At the time, Baker was the oldest player to win a PBA major, though that mark has now been surpassed by Walter Ray Williams Jr. and Pete Weber, both of whom won majors at age 50. The event was held in an arena setting in Ypsilanti, Michigan, and paid a first prize of $120,000 more than Baker had ever won in an entire season previously. Baker has been a standout on the PBA50 Tour since joining in 2005, winning four PBA50 major titles and eight PBA50 standard tournaments, while continuing to compete on the regular tour through 2009. His 12 total PBA50 titles are tied for third all-time, behind John Handegard and Walter Ray Williams Jr., who each have 14. He is one of only three bowlers in history (with Walter Ray Williams Jr. and Pete Weber) to have won at least 10 titles on both the standard PBA Tour and the PBA50 Tour. Baker was named Senior Rookie of the Year and Senior Player of the Year in 2005, becoming the only senior player to earn both honors in a single season. He won Senior Player of the Year honors again in 2006 and 2007, an unprecedented streak in the history of the PBA Senior Tour. Baker also owns 14 PBA Regional titles and 20 PBA50 Regional titles. In the 2008-09 season, Baker was the oldest player in the \\"exempt\\" field on the Lumber Liquidators PBA Tour. He earned an exemption through that season with his 2004 World Championship victory, but generally split his time between regular and senior tour events.

He graduated in law at the Université Libre de Bruxelles, and entered the legal profession, besides doing journalistic work. When he was 25 years old, he was elected a province councillor for Brabant, and was elected a city councillor in 1903. After he had worked as a magistrate, he was appointed city mayor of Brussels on 6 December 1909. Under the German occupation of Brussels during the First World War, Max refused to cooperate with the occupying forces. As a result, he was arrested and held in captivity, first at Namur, and then at Glatz and Goslar, until he escaped on 13 November 1918. Charles Lemonnier was acting mayor during his captivity. On his return to Brussels, he was greeted as a hero. In 1919, he was elected to the Belgian Chamber of Representatives, where he campaigned for universal adult suffrage, a goal not achieved until after his death. Among the monuments from Max's time in office as mayor of Brussels are parts of the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium and the Heysel exhibition park built for the Expo of 1935, begun to mark the centenary of the Belgian Revolution of 1830. Adolphe Max was an irregular freemason, an honorary Minister of State and a member of the Institut de France. Boulevard Adolphe Max, a main boulevard of the City of Brussels, is named after him. Primary and secondary schools near Square Ambiorix are named after him. There is also a Place Adolphe Max in the 9th arrondissement of Paris which was named after him in January 1940, shortly after his death.

Bordering Harold Washington Park, its two parallel towers are just west of Lake Shore Drive, Burnham Park and Lake Michigan with clear park and lake views to the east and south. The 37 floor Regents Park South Tower was completed in 1972 and the 36 floor Regents Park North Tower was completed in 1974. The South Tower is the tallest building in Kenwood, and overlooks Lake Michigan and Burnham Park to the east and Harold Washington Park to the south.  Description  Promontory Point in Burnham Park across Lake Michigan. The complex is located on the site of the former Chicago Beach Hotel, a 12-story resort built in 1921 which had been used since World War II as the 5th Army Headquarters. The South Tower is located on the site of the former hotel and the North Tower is built on the site of the north lawn of the Hotel. The buildings fell into disrepair soon after their construction in the early to mid-1970s, and by the mid-1970s, they were known for their slum-like conditions, rising violence (including murder), and high vacancy rates.Regents Park HUD had taken control of the buildings. In 1981, developer Bruce Clinton and The Clinton Company bought the property from HUD,Urban Renewal -Hyde Park Timeline Part II as an agreement had been made earlier with HUD to acquire the property after managing, renovating, and improving the property over five years. The renovations and improvements continued to progress after the acquisition, and Clinton eventually won the support of Senator Carol Moseley- Braun, U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush, Mayor Richard M. Daley, University of Chicago law school dean Douglas Baird, and University of Chicago Vice President of Community Affairs Jonathan Kleinbard. The University had previously advocated the demolition of the slums, but its position had changed as it witnessed Clinton's redevelopment successes. In 2002, the U of C-funded South East Chicago Commission honored Clinton for his contributions to the Hyde Park- Kenwood community. Regents Park was sold in 2005 to Crescent Heights and again in 2011 to Antheus Capital. The original main entrance was on the east side of the building. The towers thus retain Lake Shore Drive addresses (5020 & 5050 South Lake Shore Dr.) although the main entrance is now on the west side of the building. The towers were renovated in approximately 1990. A significant proportion of the residents attend the University of Chicago. United States President Barack Obama used to work out in the building's fitness center, although he was never a resident, which called into question some of the building's policies. Awards The buildings have been the recipient of numerous apartment industry awards including the Mayor’s Landscape Award, and the 2006 National Association of Homebuilders Multi-family Development Firm of the Year Award.

NSPCC She led the NSPCC as Chairman of the Central Executive Committee for nearly two decades (1969 - 1988). During her 40 years with the charity she played a crucial role in the establishment of the NSPCC's position as Britain's leading child protection organisation, and helped to engineer its development into a modern professional body. She personally played a significant part in fund-raising in 1984, the organisation's centenary. She was the prime mover in persuading the Duke of Westminster to chair its Centenary Appeal in 1984. This was the largest charitable appeal ever planned and executed in the UK and, because of its success, it became a blueprint for other charities, such as Great Ormond Street Hospital. The Centenary Charter set the agenda for the future direction of the society. After 19 years in the chair she retired in 1988, but she never lost interest and she continued to attend meetings and speak whenever invited. By the time she left, the NSPCC had increased the funds it raised from under £500,000 in 1947 to more than £20 million a year. Family life She was the fifth child of St John Hornby, a founding partner of W. H. Smith and a deputy vice-chairman of the NSPCC, and his wife, Cecily. St John Hornby was a public speaker, a bookman and collector of medieval and Renaissance manuscripts and printed books. His private Ashendene Press printed 40 works between 1895 and 1935. In 1942, Rosamund Hornby joined the Women's Voluntary Services, giving up her job as assistant matron of the girls' school which had been evacuated in 1939 to Chantmarle, the family home in Dorset. The WVS was led by Stella, Dowager Marchioness of Reading. Personal life In 1951 Rosamund Hornby married Captain Douglas Eric \\"Deric\\" Holland-Martin (later Admiral Sir Deric Holland-Martin), a naval officer (10 April 1906-1977), fourth son of Robert Martin Holland-Martin.Genealogy of the family. Retrieved 10 August 2007 They had two children, Emma and Benjamin, who both work for the NSPCC. Lady Holland-Martin went twice to Valletta, Malta while her husband was Commander- in-Chief of Allied Forces in the Mediterranean. They lived in Bell's Castle, Kemerton, Worcestershire. Later life After her husband's death in 1977, Lady Holland-Martin took on his former role as a Deputy Lieutenant (DL) for Hereford and Worcester. She also became a governor of Malvern School and chair of the Tewkesbury Abbey Appeal. Rosamund Holland-Martin continued to be a member of the NSPCC central executive committee until 1992 and later became a vice-president. For her work for the Women's Voluntary Service she was appointed OBE, and for her numerous subsequent posts in public service was advanced, in 1983, to DBE. Death Dame Rosamund died in 2001, eight days before her 87th birthday, and was interred near her home in Worcestershire.

A composite transposon, however, is flanked by two separate IS elements which may or may not be exact replicas. Instead of each IS element moving separately, the entire length of DNA spanning from one IS element to the other is transposed as one complete unit. Composite transposons will also often carry one or more genes conferring antibiotic resistance.

He was selected by the Los Angeles Kings in the 5th round (153rd overall) of the 2001 NHL Entry Draft. Playing career Mäntylä came through the youth ranks of Tampere Tappara and made his debut in Finland's top-tier Liiga in the course of the 1999–2000 season. He won the Finnish national championship with Tappara in 2003 and subsequently parted ways with the team to take his game to Sweden, where he joined Luleå HF of the Swedish Elite League (SHL). He enjoyed a two-year stint there, before returning to Tappara. After another two years at his hometown team, Mäntylä embarked on a second SHL tenure, playing for Frölunda HC from 2007 to 2009. On 7 April 2009 he left Frölunda and signed a contract to return to Tappara. In late October 2009, playing with Tampere Tappara, Mäntylä checked Helsinki IFK defenceman Mikko Kurvinen from behind into the boards, resulting in an injury that kept Kurvinen sidelined for six games. Mäntylä received a match penalty for the hit. In advance of Tappara's next visit to Helsinki on 26 November 2009, the IFK club ran a full-page ad in a Tampere newspaper that read: “Welcome to Helsinki, Tuukka”, and on the evening of the match between the two clubs the SM-liiga head office, which had previously approved the ad, announced it had given IFK a warning for “crossing the line of good taste”. Early in the first period of the 26 November game, with IFK head coach Kari Jalonen watching, IFK defenceman Ilari Melart mugged Mäntylä in the corner and a wrestling match ensued resulting in both players being ejected from the game. Between the 2011–12 and the 2015–16 season, he split time between Tappara and KHL outfits HC Neftekhimik Nizhnekamsk, Metallurg Novokuznetsk, Amur Khabarovsk and KHL Medvescak Zagreb.

It is locally known for its smoke stack that still rises over the town, which has earned the nickname \\"Grayslake's Hollywood Sign\\". History The factory was built in 1912 as a canning operation for the Wisconsin Condensed Milk Company, who briefly owned the farmland directly north. Nestle later acquired the company and closed this plant. After founder of the Grayslake Gelatin Company, Harry Epstein, discovered a modern creation process by using slaughtered animal skin opposed to bone, the building was repurposed for gelatin production 1922. The original plant was expanded over the years, with two additional buildings built on the property. Epstien's son: John, became president of the company before gelatin production ceased in 1982. The company re-acquired the adjacent dairy farm directly north in 1967; with 14.67 acres of the farm being sold to the village in 1979 to form Central Park, and an additional 40 acres being purchased in 1991. In the following two decades: the village's library, aquatic center, skate park, community garden, and senior citizen housing were built on the remaining property. Following its closure, the Epstien family continued to operate the Grayslake Gelatin Company as a real estate lessor, with various tenants renting parts of the former plant. In July 2013, the Epstien family announced the property would be auctioned in August, however the outcome was a no-sale. Over two years later, citing the property's poor structural and environmental condition: the village of Grayslake purchased the 10-acre property for $30,000 with intentions of redeveloping the site, and is looking into preserving its iconic smokestack. The buildings were demolished in the winter of 2016/17.

The OLCC was organized in 2006 after their charter congregations left the Lutheran Churches of the Reformation.  Organizational structure  The OLCC consists of independent Lutheran congregations who are united in doctrine and practice. It has no political structure, treasury, or form of government. The pastoral conference has a chairman who serves as a point of contact for outside groups and congregations.  Doctrine and Practice  The OLCC professes that the Book of Concord is in complete agreement with the teachings of the Bible. In Lutheranism, this is known as a quia subscription. The following beliefs distinguish this group from others which likewise profess a quia subscription.  The Church  * Only the local congregation is a body of Christians that has the right to establish the ministry in its midst. * Other organizations which congregations may join have no divine authority whatsoever. * The spiritual rule of a congregation is given to the Office of the Ministry, whose incumbents serve at the behest of God and the congregation. The spiritual rule is the rule of the Word of God. * The external governing of a congregation may be carried out in any number of ways, as the circumstances require. Thus church boards, voter's assemblies, general consensus, or pastoral rule are all valid forms of external church government. * The external government of the church is limited to matters which in themselves are not spiritual, such as the holding and maintenance of property, scheduling of meetings, etc. It must yield to the spiritual rule in all matters where the spiritual and external rule intersect. * Nevertheless, the external government cannot violate God's own commands as to how the church should be governed. Thus those who rule the church even in its external aspects must still be male, and rule according to love, etc. * Though a congregation may be organized in any number of forms (corporation, trust, house church, etc.) these forms do not in any way alter the spiritual nature or existence of that congregation. The elimination or conversion of the external form does not eliminate or alter the congregation itself, provided the congregation is still a group of Christians who continue to gather regularly around the Word and sacraments, with the office of the ministry established in their midst.  The Ministry  * The Office of the Ministry, the Office of the Keys, and the Preaching Office are all synonymous. * This office belongs to the whole church. Emergencies excepted, the church exercises the office by filling it, and also when practicing excommunication. * The office is filled when the local church issues a call to a qualified man, who then accepts this call. This call is considered to be a mediate divine call, where God works through the local congregation as His instrument. * Only the local congregation is a church that can issue a divine call. Other organizations cannot, because only the local congregation meets regularly, in a particular place, around the means of Grace (which are defined as the word and the sacraments), all other groups being of a transitory nature. * Though a local congregation may ask for assistance in choosing a candidate for the ministry, the right to issue a divine call cannot be transferred from the local congregation to another body. It is always the local congregation that calls. * The essential duties of this office are preaching, teaching, and administering the sacraments. * Individuals in this office may, by human arrangement, be divided into different branches, such as pastor, assistant pastor, seminary professor, evangelist (missionary), vicar, etc., but each has the full office and can therefore rightly preach, teach, and administer the sacraments. * No minister can by divine right claim a rank higher than any other minister, all incumbents in the ministry being equals. * An incumbent in this office may have helpers who assist him in his duties, but those helpers cannot \\"borrow\\" his call. Therefore, in the church, emergencies excepted, they may not preach, teach, or administer the sacraments without themselves having a divine call and being installed into the Office of the Ministry.

The Islamic Republic of Iran Rugby Union was formed by Alireza Fazlollah A’rabi in 2000 as a part of Baseball Federation of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Iran became a fully fledged member of the International Rugby Board in November 2010. History Rugby union was first introduced into Persia by the British military, and it was not uncommon for rich Persians to send their children to British boarding schools. In more recent times, it has grown through university contacts and has now grown to over 1,000 players, both men and women. http://wesclark.com/rrr/islamic_rugby.html \\"Islam and Rugby\\" on the Rugby Readers review retrieved 2 July 2009 The first step for formalization of rugby football in Iran was performed in 1996 when a professor of Physical Education University decided to teach rugby football for students who attended to physical training lessen. He tried to explain it to students briefly using a reference book on sport sciences. Accordingly, he introduced rugby football to students using above-mentioned book and soccer ball instead of oval-form ball of rugby football. A talent and interested student called Alireza Fazlollah A’rabi was between students. After lessen he began his study on rugby football. During his research he met a retired from Iranian army and found out that rugby football was first played in Iran by oil contractors in Masjed- Soleyman city during the 1940s and some personal sport clubs attempted to create rugby football team. Unfortunately, rugby football was practically cancelled due to lack of enough support by authorities and sport poor condition during the 1950s in Iran. Alireza continued his research to learn technical information and rules about rugby football. He introduced rugby football as new plan for Physical Education Organization when he established a university team including postgraduate students in the field of physical education and technology. He proposed the project of rugby football in Iran as national plan to Physical Education Organization after one year continuous work and study in 2000 and finally at 2001 he received license to formalize this sport as field covered by Baseball Federation which already covered cricket, softball and baseball too. It is important to remind that all costs related to this sport in Iran such as team handling, research, training courses and competitions were paid by those interested and sportsmen in this field before formalization of this sport in Iran. After some years continuous efforts made by society of Iran rugby football together with authorities, today we can see successful results such as foundation of Iran Rugby Football Union, qualification for Asian competitions and membership in Asian Rugby Football Union (ARFU) with optimal rank in this Union. We hope that Iranian rugby football could be member of International Rugby Board and receive optimal international rank based on all efforts made by authorities as well as all supports made by IRB. http://iranrugby.com/ Notable players of Iranian descent * Aadel Kardooni, an Iranian who emigrated to the England in the 1980s played for Leicester Tigers and represented England A.

Originally a Hendy design, few were built. It combined the strength and comfort of a cabin aircraft with the speed of a racer.Lukins 1944 Design The Heck was designed by Basil B. Henderson on commission from Whitney Straight, who specified a high cruising speed along with a very low landing speed.Ord-Hume 2000 p. 439 It was a single-engined, conventional low-wing cabin monoplane, built of spruce with a plywood covering, initially a two-seater in tandem layout. It had a manually operated retractable undercarriage, leading edge slats and slotted flaps, giving it good short-field performance in spite of its high wing loading compared to contemporary aircraft in this class. History The type was originally designated the Hendy 3308 Heck, with the prototype built by the Westland Aircraft Works at Yeovil. Registered G-ACTC, it first flew in July 1934. Parnall Aircraft Limited was formed in May 1935 when George Parnall and Company merged with the Hendy Aircraft Company and the armament engineering firm Nash and Thompson Limited. The Heck was redesignated the Parnall Heck. A number of problems with the undercarriage led to it being locked down and covered with 'trouser' fairings. The aircraft set a new record for the flight from Cape Town to England of 6 days, 8 hours and 27 minutes in November 1936. A small production line was started at Yate, Gloucestershire and the production version was designated the Heck 2C. The production aircraft were three-seaters with fixed spatted undercarriages. None of the aircraft was sold, and four (G-AEGH, G-AEGI, G-AEGJ and G-AEMR) were operated by Parnall Aircraft for communications and liaison with RAF squadrons in connection with Parnall's armament contracts. When the Second World War started, the aircraft were repainted from dark grey to a brown and green camouflage scheme but retained civilian registration markings.Jackson 1988, pp. 90–91 The fifth production Heck 2C, registered G-AEGL, was flown as serial K8853 under contract 486334/36, and was used for trial installations of engines and armaments, including the development of the gun sight installation for the Spitfire and Hurricane. It was later allocated the Maintenace serial 3125M. In March 1943, G-AEGH was impressed into service with the Royal Air Force as serial NF749 on communications and liaison duties.Moss 1962 The Parnall 382 was a newly designed two-seat open cockpit trainer, with some Heck components to meet Air Ministry Specification T.1/37. It was flown in February 1939 and later assessed at Martlesham Heath as the Heck III, but was not ordered. The last surviving Heck was G-AEGI which was damaged beyond repair in a taxying accident on 17 June 1950. The aircraft had just come seventh in the King's Cup Race at Wolverhampton's Pendeford airfield (with a speed of 159 mph) when a landing civil Supermarine Spitfire hit the rear of the Heck and demolished it. Attempts at reconstruction failed and the aircraft was broken up in 1953.Jackson 1988, p. 91 right Operators=Civil operators ; * Parnall Aircraft Military operators ; * Royal Air Force Specifications (Heck 2C)See alsoReferencesBibliography  Category:1930s British civil utility aircraft Heck Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:Low-wing aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 1934 ","title":"Parnall Heck"},{"id":"10110753","title":"TD postcode area"},{"id":"10110762","text":"The DG postcode area, also known as the Dumfries and Galloway postcode area,Royal Mail, Address Management Guide, (2004) is a group of fifteen postcode districts in south-west Scotland, within fourteen post towns.

Early life Preston is the daughter of Madge Preston and Arthur Ernest Preston and has one brother and one sister. Acting career Preston started her career on stage at the age of five in her native Northeast of England. Some of her early acting experience was with Stockton Youth Theatre where she performed in acclaimed productions of Hair, Jesus Christ Superstar and Sweet Charity alongside Mark Benton and Marcus Bentley. She continued to be involved in many theatre and independent productions until she left for London where she trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) for three years and gained a diploma in acting. Classmates included Andrew Lincoln and Stephen Mangan. During her time at RADA she developed skills in stage fighting. She excelled in this, earning high qualifications and the coveted John Barton Prize. One of her first jobs after leaving RADA was in the feature film The House of Angelo, where she was stunt double for the leading lady (played by Sarah Woodward) and the only woman on the film's fight team. The first major TV role was playing Karen Newburn in the BBC's flagship drama series, Holby City. She played the straight-talking, no-nonsense Ward Sister who clashes with ex-husband and cardiothoracic registrar Nick Jordan, played by Michael French. They battled throughout the first two series and their tempestuous relationship became one of the leading story-lines. Other regular appearances include EastEnders, In Deep with Stephen Tompkinson, Steel River Blues and Extras with Ricky Gervais. Preston has guested in a number of other shows including Vera with Brenda Blethyn, The Last Detective alongside Peter Davison, Where The Heart Is and Doctors.

It contains the original Super Street Fighter II, its follow-up Super Street Fighter II Turbo, and an enhanced version of Street Fighter Alpha 2 titled Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold (titled Street Fighter Zero 2 Dash in Japan and Street Fighter Alpha 2 Dash in Europe), which is exclusive to this compilation. A follow-up to Street Fighter Collection, which contains the first 3 editions of Street Fighter II, was released as part of the Capcom Generations line. Gameplay The Super Street Fighter II games are ported from their original CPS II arcade versions. After selecting either game from the Street Fighter Collection title screen on the first disc, the player is taken to the attract mode from the game they have selected. Both games feature the standard \\"Arcade\\", \\"Versus\\" and \\"Option\\" modes. In Super Turbo, the Super Street Fighter II versions of the returning characters, as well as the hidden character Akuma, are playable through easier means compared to the ones provided in the original arcade version. This version of Super Turbo is also easier than the arcade version; it may be based on the original Japanese version (Super Street Fighter II X) which contained a similarly easier level of difficulty. Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold is based on Street Fighter Zero 2 Alpha, an enhanced version of the original Street Fighter Alpha 2 released for the arcade in Japan, Asia and South America. All the game modes and features in the previous PlayStation and Sega Saturn versions of the original Alpha 2 are featured, with the exception of the exclusive \\"Gallery\\" mode in the Sega Saturn version. Evil Ryu, who was selectable in the Sega Saturn version of the original Alpha 2 but not in the PlayStation version, is featured in both versions of the game, along with Champion Edition-style renditions of all the Street Fighter II characters featured in the game. This version includes the debut of Super Street Fighter II character Cammy in the Alpha series. She is selectable as a hidden character in the game's \\"Versus\\" and \\"Training\\" modes. The version of this Cammy is the same one previously featured in X-Men vs. Street Fighter, which depicts Cammy as a Shadaloo agent working for M. Bison before joining Delta Red. Reception Reviews were complimentary toward Street Fighter Collections arcade-perfect conversions, but judged the selection of games too weak to be worth buying. In particular, critics were puzzled that Capcom chose to include Super Street Fighter II, widely regarded as one of the weakest in the series, over more beloved Street Fighter games, and found Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold too similar to the original Alpha 2, which most of the compilation's prospective audience would already own, since critically acclaimed conversions of Alpha 2 had already been released for both the Saturn and the PlayStation. The inclusion of Super Street Fighter II Turbo was met with widespread approval, but considered insufficient reason to buy the collection on its own. Sega Saturn Magazines editor-in-chief Rich Leadbetter concluded that, \\"Is the game worth buying if you already own Street Fighter Alpha 2 (and you should be ashamed of yourself if you don't)? Well, to be brutally honest, I would have to say 'no'. Super Street Fighter 2 Turbo is a cool game, but it is old and it isn't really worth the full whack.\\" Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot additionally felt that Street Fighter Collection should have included the entire series, remarking \\"Capcom truly missed out on a great opportunity by releasing a 'collection' that is obscenely incomplete.\\" GamePro offered a somewhat different viewpoint, opining that Alpha 2 Gold is a worthwhile game but the other two are outdated and have no value beyond nostalgia. While most critics did not compare versions, Kelly Richards of Electronic Gaming Monthly scored the Saturn version half a point higher because he felt the Saturn controller much better suited to fighting games, and his co-reviewer Sushi-X, while giving the two versions equal scores, said the PlayStation version is slightly better due to the Saturn version having some visual glitches.

The extended trunk is a water storage device for survival in a warm dry climate. The bell-shaped flowers are variable in colour (pale to pink) while the leaves vary considerably in shape. The leaves are either simple and pointed, or may be 3–9 lobed. Saplings grow from a drought and fire resistant tap-rooted tuber. The kurrajong has multiple uses and was used by many Australian Aboriginal clans and tribes around Australia. The seeds located in a seed pod were often removed and cleaned of the fine hairs within the seed pod and were often roasted. Water could be obtained from the tree roots by boring a hole in the trunk and squeezing the wood.Ngarigo Plant Use in the snow River Catchment There are also records of the seedpods being turned into a children's rattle or toy. The soft spongy wood was used for making shields, and the bark as a fibre. The leaves are also used as emergency fodder for drought-affected animal stock. There has also been records of European settlers using the seeds as a coffee supplement by roasting and crushing the seeds. It has been introduced as an ornamental tree to south- western Australia, South Africa, Louisiana, California, Arizona and Mediterranean countries. In Western Australia it was observed to be invasive in disturbed areas. Horticulturists have hybridised the kurrajong with related Brachychiton species, including the Queensland bottle tree (B. rupestris) and Illawarra flame tree (B. acerifolius) to produce new garden ornamentals. The specific name Brachychiton populneus pertains to a perceived similarity to genus Populus, the poplars. Sometimes B. populneus is also known by the names \\"lacebark kurrajong\\" and \\"bottle tree\\" (USA). However, B. discolor is also referred to as the lacebark kurrajong, and Bottle Tree is a term commonly applied not only to other species of Brachychiton but to members of other genera around the world. The kurrajong has been recorded as a host plant for the mistletoe species Dendrophthoe glabrescens.

Early land purchases and rezoning included Howard County Board of Trade member J Frank Gwynn's farm along Font Hill in 1955 by the Development and Investment Corporation of Maryland. The 715-acre parcel of land was purchased by the Howard Research and Development subsidiary of the Rouse Company in 1968 from the Gudelsky family that sought to rezone the area for high-rise apartments in the 1960s. The \\"Mandel\\" site was proposed to be a \\"Central Park\\" for Columbia featuring a high school, county office buildings, and a replacement for the Carr's Mill Landfill in 1974. In 1969, the County attempted to purchase by condemnation, the land occupying Centennial Park from a company run by the land speculator Joel Kline for $3,180 an acre. Kline was later indicted for real estate fraud that was linked to local politicians up to Spiro Agnew who was forced to resign. The County eventually bought the Centennial lake parkland from Kline's creditors at nearly twice the cost. Dorsey's Search was occupied starting in 1980.Mitchell, p. 130 In 1999 the village manager was indicted for embezzling $121,000 of village funds. The current population is approximately 7,500.

The City Paper is distributed on Thursdays; its average circulation in 2006 was 85,588. The paper's editorial mix is focused on local news and arts. Its 2018 circulation figure was 47,000.  History  The Washington City Paper was started in 1981 by Russ Smith and Alan Hirsch, the owners of the Baltimore City Paper. For its first year it was called 1981. The name was changed to City Paper in January 1982 and in December 1982 Smith and Hirsch sold 80% of it to Chicago Reader, Inc. In 1988, Chicago Reader, Inc. acquired the remaining 20% interest. In July 2007 both the Washington City Paper and the Chicago Reader were sold to the Tampa-based Creative Loafing chain. In 2012, Creative Loafing Atlanta and the Washington City Paper were sold to SouthComm Communications. Amy Austin, the longtime general manager, was promoted to publisher in 2003. Michael Schaffer was named editor in April, 2010, two months after Erik Wemple resigned to run the new local startup TBD. On December 21, 2017, it was announced that D.C.-area venture capitalist and philanthropist Mark Ein would buy the City Paper. He became the first D.C.-based owner in the paper's history. Ein announced the creation of two groups to ensure the paper's long-term success: \\"Alumni Group\\" and \\"Friends of Washington City Paper.\\"  Defamation Lawsuit  In 2011, Daniel Snyder, the owner of the Washington Redskins, filed a lawsuit against the City Paper for a cover story that portrayed him in a negative light. He and the Simon Wiesenthal Center claimed that the story used anti-Semitic tropes. Prominent sports journalists, Jewish groups, and Jewish writers published sharp criticism of Snyder and the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s claims of anti-Semitism, referring in various opinion pieces and public statements to their statements as, “breathtakingly dumb allegation”, “almost unbearably stupid”, and “so self-evidently lacking in merit”. The Washington City paper issued its own response in a published editorial, saying, \\"But we at City Paper take accusations of anti-Semitism seriously—in part because many of us are Jewish, including staffers who edited the story and designed the cover. So let us know, Mr. Snyder, when you want to fight the real anti-Semites.\\" In response, hundreds of loyal readers donated over $30,000 to a legal defense fund.

After musical training at the Royal Academy of Music, Norris joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1913 as chorus coach and principal violinist. In 1916, he left to serve in World War I, but In 1919 he returned to the company, becoming musical director in 1920. However, the company recalled Geoffrey Toye, Norris's predecessor, as musical director for the company's London seasons. During his tenure, Norris led the company's tours both in Britain and abroad. He is remembered for making modifications to Arthur Sullivan's scores, some of which were performed and recorded by the company for many years. His short edition of Cox and Box remains popular. After leaving the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1929, Norris emigrated to Canada with his wife to teach at McGill University in Montreal. He resigned from this post in 1933, and his wife and he became engaged full-time in, respectively, directing and music directing Gilbert and Sullivan productions for several groups. They helped to establish one of these Gilbert and Sullivan companies and directed it from 1939 to 1963. He also performed on the violin and gave violin and singing lessons, among other activities. They retired and returned to England in the 1960s. Life and career Norris was born in Invercargill, in the southernmost part of New Zealand, the first child of four born to William and Mary Norris. He displayed talent for the violin and piano, and at the age of about 3-1/2 began tuition on these instruments with his music teacher father.Downes, pp. 6–7 At age 11 he had outstripped his father's teaching capabilities for the violin and continued on to the advanced stages of training on his own, aided by the playing instructions in the British in the British magazine The Strad. He played the violin frequently at concerts in Invercargill.Downes, pp. 7–9 In 1907 he passed the Royal Schools of Music Licentiate examination with such high marks that he was awarded a scholarship to study in London at the Royal Academy of Music, where he won the Hill Prize for violin, among other prizes.The Times, 28 November 1910, p. 13; and 27 July 1911, p. 4Downes, pp. 10–16 At this time he was known as \\"Henry W Norris\\".The Times, 28 November 1910, p. 13 A fellow student was the future D'Oyly Carte star Darrell Fancourt.Norris, Harry. \\"Recollections of the D'Oyly Carte\\", Memories of D'Oyly Carte website D'Oyly Carte years In 1913 the conductor Landon Ronald, responding to a request from Rupert D'Oyly Carte, recommended Norris as chorus coach and principal violinist for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company.Downes, pp. 16–17 1n 1916, he left to serve in World War I as a musketry trainer and also forming and training orchestras and other musical groups for the forces. After his discharge, he returned in 1919 as chorus coach and principal violinist in a new D'Oyly Carte touring company.Downes, pp. 24–25 In January 1920, he moved to the main company during the London season at the Prince's Theatre, where he served as assistant musical director to Geoffrey Toye for the remainder of that season.Rollins and Witts, Appendix, p. IStone, David. Harry Norris biography at Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company (2006) On the expiry of Toye's contract he took over as musical director from 1 February 1920, making his debut as conductor in Birmingham the following day.Downes, p. 26 Norris was the company's musical director from February 1920 to May 1929, except for the London West End seasons in 1921–22 and 1924, when Toye again took charge, and 1926 when Malcolm Sargent was guest conductor. Norris was never musical director for a D'Oyly Carte London season, though he shared the conducting and was allotted the occasional first night of an opera's run.Rollins and Witts, Appendix pp. I and IIThe Times, 11 March 1924, p. 12 During his tenure with the company, Norris married and divorced one of the company's sopranos, Elsie Coram.Stone, David. Elsie Coram biography at Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company (2004) From January to May 1927, Norris toured Canada with the company, and from September 1928 to May 1929 they toured Canada and the US. Norris left the company at the end of that tour. As musical director, Norris was responsible for a number of changes to Sullivan's scores. Prominent horn parts were added to the accompaniment to \\"A Lady Fair\\" in Princess Ida that are customarily referred to as the \\"Norris\\" horn parts, though they may have been written by Toye. They were expunged by Sargent but subsequently restored by the D'Oyly Carte musical director Royston Nash in the 1970s. In addition, in 1921 Norris, in collaboration with J. M. Gordon, cut Cox and Box from its original one-hour running time to play in about half an hour, so that it became suitable as a curtain raiser for The Sorcerer or other shorter full-length pieces. This version remained in the company's repertoire until 1977 and continues to be used in many productions.Walters, Michael. \\"A Brief Overview of the Life of Rutland Barrington\\", The Gilbert & Sullivan News, vol. II, no. 13, p. 15 (Autumn/Winter 1998; The Gilbert and Sullivan Society) Of Norris's work with the D'Oyly Carte company, Samuel Langford in The Manchester Guardian wrote, \\"Mr Norris, the conductor, we think favours too much in The Mikado an easeful enthusiasm. The work on the stage would be all the finer with a keener precision in the orchestra.\\"The Manchester Guardian, 6 April 1926, p. 9 Earlier, Langford objected to \\"the occasions when the accompanying melodies took rather a canonic than a simultaneous form.\\"The Manchester Guardian, 2 April 1922, p. 9 The Times, on the other hand, praised Norris's \\"admirable swing and fluency\\" and commented that he justified D'Oyly Carte's confidence in him.\\" Later years After leaving the company in 1929, Norris settled in Canada with his second wife, Doris Hemingway (also a former D'Oyly Carte performer),Stone, David.

Almost immediately after their arrival the Norrises were in great demand as musical and stage directors, respectively, for several amateur Gilbert and Sullivan Operatic Societies, and this, along with teaching piano, singing and violin, became their life’s work for the next 34 years.Downes, pp. 62–86 As a soloist, Norris gave violin recitals, and in 1935 he became an original member of what is now known as the Montreal Symphony Orchestra.Downes, pp. 64–65 Their son, Peter, was born in 1937.Downes, p. 65 The Norrises were founding members of the Montreal West Operatic Society, in 1939, which performed the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, directing for them until 1963. The group was highly praised by newspaper critics.Downes, pp. 66–86 They also worked with St. Paul's Operatic Society in Lachine, Quebec, a western suburb of Montreal, among other groups.Whitehead, J. Rennie. Memoirs of a Boffin , Chapter 8: Multinational, 1995 While at McGill, Norris had been invited to form an experimental orchestra of secondary school students, and this work successfully expanded until by 1939 he was made Director of instrumental Studies in the Orchestral Scheme of the Protestant Board of School Commissioners of the City of Montreal.Downes, pp. 70–71 He also became musical director for the Montreal West United Church of Canada.Downes, pp. 79–80 Norris volunteered at St. Helen's School, Dunham, Quebec, in the 1940s and 1950s.Downes, p. 71 He rehearsed and directed the school's annual carol service at St. Matthias and directed an annual spring production of a Gilbert and Sullivan opera. He also gave lessons to the school's advanced piano and singing students.St Helen's school yearbook, 1955, p. 3 He retired in 1963, and he and Doris moved to Barton-on-Sea near Bournemouth, England.Downes, pp. 86–87 They returned to Montreal in 1967–68 for Doris to satisfy requirements for her to receive the Canadian Old Age Security pension.Downes, p. 87 During this period, St Paul's Operatic Society invited them back to direct two productions.Downes, pp. 88–89 They then returned to England and settled permanently in Barton-on-Sea.Downes, p. 89 Norris died in 1979 at the age of 91, and Doris died in 1983, aged 82.

Her husband was New Zealand's 29th Prime Minister, Norman Kirk. Biography Historic Places Trust as a Category I heritage structure Lucy Ruth Miller was born in Taumarunui in 1922, the daughter of postmaster George Miller and his wife Margaret. She met her future husband, Norman Kirk, at a blind date in Paeroa; she was his first partner. On 17 July 1943, they married at Holy Trinity Church in Devonport, Auckland. The couple were to have three boys and two girls, including John Kirk, who succeeded his father as MP for Sydenham, and coastal geomorphologist Professor Bob Kirk. In February 1944, they moved to Katikati in the Bay of Plenty. In 1948, they moved to Canterbury. Her husband worked at Firestone (now Bridgestone) in Papanui and in the evenings and weekend, built their house in Kaiapoi, where land was cheaper. During this time, she lived with her children at his parents' place in Christchurch. Once the house was finished, the family moved to Kaiapoi. On 28 May 1999, their house in Carew Street was registered by the Historic Places Trust as a Category I heritage structure. Norman Kirk was elected Mayor of Kaiapoi in 1953. He resigned from the mayoralty in January 1958 after having won the November in the electorate. The family moved to Christchurch in January 1958 to fulfil a promise to the Lyttelton electors. In 1974, she became patron of the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child. This caused a public furore, as her husband was Prime Minister at the time. Kirk joined protest marches in Wellington and Hamilton. Her husband died in August 1974, and in the 1975 New Year Honours, she was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, for public services. Three months after her husband's death, she put gifts given to him by foreign leaders up for auction, which sparked some public debate. She was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977. Kirk largely withdrew from public life in later years, but was famously remembered for ringing a Christchurch talkback radio show in 1993 to voice her fury at Helen Clark's ousting of Mike Moore as Labour party leader. She died from cancer in Christchurch on 20 March 2000, and was buried alongside her husband at Waimate in South Canterbury.

It may be unsightly, mildly painful, and may change the timing or completeness of insulin action. It is a common, minor, chronic complication of diabetes mellitus. Typical injection site hypertrophy is several inches or cm across, smoothly rounded, and somewhat firmer than ordinary subcutaneous fat. There may be some scar tissue as well, but the major component is adipose tissue, as insulin exerts a hypertrophic effect on adipose cells. To avoid lipohypertrophy, persons with diabetes mellitus who inject insulin daily for an extended period of time are advised to rotate their injections among several areas (usually upper, outer arms, outer thighs, abdomen below and around the umbilicus, and the upper parts of the buttocks). Rotation charts are often provided as part of diabetes education to help prevent lipohypertrophy. Lipohypertrophy usually will gradually disappear over months if injections in the area are avoided. It is a common misconception that the lump is largely scar tissue, as injection site hypertrophy is much rarer and milder with injections of other hormones and medications which lack the specific ability of insulin to stimulate adipose hypertrophy. In a sense, the \\"opposite\\" of injection site lipohypertrophy is injection site lipoatrophy, in which the subcutaneous fat around an injected area \\"melts away\\" over a few weeks or months, leaving unsightly, well- demarcated depressions in the skin. The mechanism of this local lipoatrophy is not understood and may involve autoimmunity or local inflammation.

Tice, 33 Cal.2d 80, 199 P.2d 1 (1948), is a seminal California Supreme Court tort law decision relating to the issue of liability where a plaintiff cannot identify with specificity which among multiple defendants caused his harm. The case established the doctrine of alternative liability and has had its greatest influence in the area of product liability in American jurisprudence. Background In Summers the plaintiff, Charles A. Summers, accompanied defendants Tice and Simonson as a guide on a quail hunt on November 20, 1945. Each of the defendants was armed with a 12 gauge shotgun loaded with shells containing 7 size shot. Prior to going hunting plaintiff discussed the hunting procedure with defendants, indicating that they were to exercise care when shooting and to \\"keep in line.\\" Plaintiff advanced ahead of the defendants up a hill, creating a triangle among the three men, with plaintiff front and center. The view of both defendants with respect to Summers was unobstructed, and both defendants knew his location, 75 yards from each of them. A quail flew to a 10-foot elevation above the plaintiff's head (approximately four feet higher than the plaintiff's head), both defendants shot at the quail, and bird shot struck plaintiff in his right eye and another in his upper lip. Plaintiff sued both defendants for personal injuries. At trial it was established that each of two pellets had caused the injuries to plaintiff's lip and eye, respectively, and both might have been discharged from a single weapon (defendant) or each defendant may have contributed one of the injuring pellets. The trial court found that the defendants were negligent (i.e., that when they discharged their weapons they did not do so with ordinary prudence), and that the plaintiff was not contributorily negligent. The defendants appealed. California Supreme Court ruling On appeal the defendants argued that they were not joint tortfeasors because they were not acting in concert. On the subject of negligence, defendant Simonson contended that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the finding on that score. The court ruled that Simonson did not however point out wherein the plaintiff's evidence was lacking. Defendant Tice on the other hand stated in his opening brief that \\"we have decided not to argue the insufficiency of negligence on the part of defendant Tice.\\" The court noted that Tice neither conceded the point nor argued it in his petition for a hearing before the court and the court therefore did not address that issue further. Accordingly, in their view, neither was liable, and they could not be held jointly and severally liable (i.e., each defendant was liable for the full amount of damages). The court affirmed the lower court ruling that each defendant's behavior fell below the standard of care (i.e., they were both negligent) and that the plaintiff's conduct did not contribute to his injury. Laying out the groundbreaking doctrine of alternative liability, because both defendants had been negligent, the court then decided that justice required that the burden of proving which of the defendants had caused either or both of plaintiff's injuries be shifted to the defendants, so that either could absolve himself of liability if possible. This is because it would have been impossible for the plaintiff to show which of the two negligent actors had caused his harm. Summers v. Tice has had enormous precedential impact within the state of California and persuasive authority in other jurisdictions in the area of product liability. See also * Missouri v.

Fields grew up in Queensland playing boy's and men's cricket before playing women's cricket while at University. She made her debut for the Queensland Fire in 2000 and captained the team from the 2008-09 season for six years. During her career, she played 165 domestic limited overs matches and 98 Women's National Cricket League matches. Fields made her international debut for Australia in a Test against India in Adelaide in February 2006. She was appointed Captain of the Australian Women's Cricket Team in 2009, replacing the renowned Karen Rolton. In doing so, she became the first Queensland woman to captain the Australian team. Fields first game as captain of the Australian national women's side was a T201 against England in Derby on 25 July 2009. In Fields first Test match as captain against England in July 2009, she made her maiden Test century with a captain's knock of 139, rescuing her team from the perilous position of -28. The match was eventually drawn after rain on the last day. Fields captained the Australian Women's Cricket Team to the ICC Women's World Twenty20 title in 2012 in Sri Lanka and defied the odds to defeat the favourites, England in the final. Fields led the side to another victory in the ICC Women's World Cup in India less than six months later in February 2013. Fields retired from International cricket on 12 June 2014. Fields retired as one of the most successful Australian cricket captains, having led her side to the 2012 ICC Women’s World Twenty20 and the 2013 ICC Women’s World Cup and bowed out with the team holding the number one world rankings in One Day International (ODI) and T20 cricket. During her international career, she played in four Tests, 67 ODIs and 37 Women’s T20 International matches. Fields made a name for herself with both the bat and gloves throughout her career. She amassed a total of 331 Test runs, 1162 ODI runs and 249 T20 runs. Her wicketkeeping statistics are equally impressive, having claimed 11 dismissals in Tests, 76 dismissals (57 catches, 19 stumpings) in ODIs and 40 dismissals (25 catches and 15 stumpings) in T20s. Fields was arguably one of Queensland’s greatest female players. To date she has notched up 98 WNCL matches and 47 WT20 matches with the Konica Minolta Queensland Fire and enjoyed great individual success at domestic level. She won the Player-of-the-Year award on three occasions for Queensland and amassed 2327 WNCL runs and 829 WT20 runs. Fields captained the Queensland side to their first ever WT20 title in the 2013-14 season, although she was unlucky to miss the final due to injury. Fields was the 150th woman to play Test cricket for Australia, and the 105th woman to play One Day International cricket for Australia. In 2014, Fields launched a personal scholarship scheme, \\"The Jodie Fields Young Cricketer Development Scholarship\\" in partnership with UQ Business School, Kookaburra Sport, and QLD Cricket Association. The scholarship assists promising young female cricketers around Queensland with their sport development and professional career prospects. The scholarship has been awarded to four aspiring young girls since 2014, by assisting them with new cricket gear, financial assistance and a significant head start in their careers. Each annual Scholarship recipient is selected from a group of promising players that attend the Queensland Cricket Emerging Girls talent identification camp or are part of the Queensland Cricket Youth Pathway programs, and/or are rural based residents with a determination to succeed in cricket. The scholarship was originally designed and sponsored by Jodie with significant contributions from, Talbot and Purves Pty Ltd, Hollis Family Trust, Howzat Sports and Queensland Cricket Association. In 2015-16, Jodie partnered with University of Queensland Business School for a five-year $2,500 annual scholarship agreement. In addition to this sponsorship, Kookaburra Sport and the Queensland Cricket Association have been tremendous supporters of the initiative with equipment and mentorship opportunities. The scholarship provides significant financial assistance to families, a cricket gear sponsorship and access to Brisbane Heat and Queensland Fire training, games and mentorship from elite female players. In 2017, Fields was an integral part behind the renewed memorandum of understanding (MOU) for Australian cricketers, secured under an in-principle agreement between Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers’ Association, to include men and women in the same agreement for the first time. The goal for this revenue share model was to bring the female players into the same model to allow their part of the game to grow. Fields has been a standout voice for this change, \\"the deal recognises the contribution women make to sport in this country, both on the field and off the field. The agreement will provide a secure workplace for female cricketers both at international and domestic level. It will support female cricketers as the game moves progressively towards complete professionalisation in a sustained manner. In recent years, women’s cricket has grown both locally, domestically in Australia and globally.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Profile from Queensland Fire *Profile from Cricket Australia * from Cricket.com.au * from Cricket.com.au * from The Guardian * from ACA Australian Cricketers' Association * from Cricket.com.au Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Australia women Test cricketers Category:Australia women One Day International cricketers Category:Australia women Twenty20 International cricketers Category:Queensland Fire cricketers Category:People from Toowoomba Category:Cricketers from Queensland Category:University of Queensland alumni Category:Brisbane Heat (WBBL) cricketers ","title":"Jodie Fields"},{"id":"10111265","text":"Tributyltin hydride is an organotin compound with the formula (C4H9)3SnH.

It has been expressed in the academic sphere, on the sports field and in the rivalry of the student populations. It can be traced to their foundation in the 1820s when King's College was established as the Anglican counterpart to the secular University College.  Origins  King's College was founded in 1829 in response to the founding of \\"London University\\", latterly known as University College London, in 1826. UCL was founded, with the backing of Jews, Utilitarians and non- Anglican Christians, as a secular institution, intended to educate \\"the youth of our middling rich people between the ages of 15 or 16 and 20 or later\\". The principal objective of King's College was \\"to imbue the minds of youth with a knowledge of the doctrines and duties of Christianity, as inculcated by the United Church of England and Ireland\\". At King's, attendance at college chapel and the study of Christianity formed an important part of college life. Embankment terrace, King's College London Portico building, University College London The rivalry can be glimpsed in the second verse of an 1820s satirical song set to the music of the British national anthem: :King's College lads arise! :New Universities :Shall quickly fall; :Confound their politics, :Frustrate their teaching tricks, :O, Church! on thee we fix, :Maintain us all One of the earliest potentially violent consequences of the contrasting styles and purposes of the two colleges arose when the Earl of Winchilsea, one of the principal financial donors to the fledgling King's College, accused its leading patron, the Duke of Wellington, of seeking to water down the orthodox, Protestant, character of the new College. Wellington had recently played a central role in securing Catholic Emancipation and Winchilsea, an opponent of emancipation, feared that he planned to turn King's College London into a 'Catholic Seminary' as the new college was to place no religious test for entry. Early in 1829 Winchilsea publicly challenged Wellington about the Duke's simultaneous support for the Anglican King's College and the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829. The result was a duel in Battersea Fields on 21 March. Shots were fired but no-one was hurt. Duel Day is still celebrated annually at King's in March.  Student Rags  Student Rags were manifestations of the rivalry between the two institutions and first became popular in the late nineteenth century. Student rags often featured cross- dressing and processions that mirrored official celebrations as a way of challenging authority whilst raising money for charity. Rags were \\"colourful, subversive, and occasionally dangerous\\" for both participants and bystanders and reached their height between the two World Wars. A long-running campaign of the rags were the attempts to capture each other's mascots. Running battles were supposedly brought to an end by the colleges' authorities in the first half of the twentieth century, but rivalry amongst the University of London's colleges continues to this day. Early student social activity in London tended to be quite serious and worthy in its expression, characterised by programmes of lectures, debates and sporting fixtures. However, this began to change by the 1890s, which witnessed boisterous 'Town and Gown' antics by students which continued into Edwardian times. The first real rag at King's occurred in 1912. Angry student anti-vivisectionists complained that a small dog had been vivisected repeatedly and unnecessarily and erected a statue of the animal in Battersea Park. Indignant students from London medical schools quickly moved to destroy the statue, in the course of which a struggle took place with police and some students arrested and fined. They later reconvened in the King's quad with an effigy of the offending magistrate that was set on fire and thrown into the river. The First World War for some constituted a cultural watershed in attitudes to established authority. Many members of staff and students of British universities saw active service and the experience of the veteran undoubtedly influenced the progress of the student rag after the war. The rags of the 1920s were well attended and often organised with military precision. They received considerable press coverage not least for their impact on local communities The body of Jeremy Bentham (with fake head) Edith Summerskill, medical student at King's in the 1920s and later Minister of National Insurance, reflecting on the contrast between the informal behaviour of her contemporaries with the more serious post-1945 student, observed that, \\"We were all too busy relaxing after the war, gayer, more high spirited and after a good time', going on to suggest that 'the 1914–18 war was far more terrible than this last war ... consequently the reaction after the war was more marked.\\"  College mascots  Reggie the Lion – King's Mascot Rivalry in the twentieth century between students of the two colleges was centred on their respective mascots. University College's was Phineas Maclino, a wooden tobacconist's sign of a kilted Jacobite Highlander purloined from outside a shop in Tottenham Court Road during the celebrations of the Relief of Ladysmith in 1900. King's later addition was a giant beer bottle representing \\"bottled youth\\". In December 1923 it was replaced by a new mascot to rival Phineas – Reggie the Lion, a copper lion from a junkyard (also off Tottenham Court Road) for whom King's students paid £7, that was christened Reggie at a special meeting. Reggie made his debut at a King's-UCL sporting rag in December 1923, protected by a lifeguard of engineering students armed with T-squares. Thereafter, Reggie formed the centrepiece of annual freshers' processions by King's students around Aldwych.  Kidnappings  Reggie was the victim of repeated kidnapping attempts by UCL and other London colleges following the Second World War. On one occasion he was transported to Inverness and on another was ignominiously dumped at the Surrey beauty spot of the Devil's Punchbowl. The most notable episode involved his painful emasculation by UCL students armed with a tin opener. Thankfully, he was restored to full working order by a team of engineers and medics and filled with concrete to prevent further kidnap attempts by the Bloomsbury students. Likewise, UCL mascots have been kidnapped over the years, with the tarring and feathering of Phineas and the infamous theft of preserved Jeremy Bentham's head. Mascot theft has since died down with both university's mascots more securely protected. 1919–1938: Heyday of the rag The Interwar period witnessed the flourishing of the student rag and of the friendly rivalry between King's and UCL. College union societies greatly expanded their sporting, social and charitable activities at this time and in 1921 the University of London Union Society was formed as an umbrella organisation. Rags comprised well-organised kidnappings, the collection for charity by students dressed as the opposite sex or in elaborate costumes, processions and mock battles. Great rag of 1922 The contest between King's and UCL reached new levels in December 1922 when King's captured Phineas from his usual residence in Tottenham Court Road. When King's ignored an ultimatum demanding his return, hundreds of UCL students, transported in furniture vans from Bloomsbury or arriving at Aldwych tube station, stormed the King's quad. King's was defended by the college gun, re-equipped with a powerful hose pipe, whilst Phineas stood on the college's main steps with a personal bodyguard of engineering students armed with rotten fruit and vegetables from the nearby Covent Garden Market. Having taken the precaution to switch off the college's water supply at the mains, UCL students engaged their rivals resulting in several injuries and the collapse of part of a King's College stone balustrade. Police were called and a truce was enforced. UCL and King's students then marched back to Gower Street in good spirits accompanied by the battered but dignified Phineas. The University College mascot soon disappeared again the following spring. King's was initially suspected but this time it was students of Caius College, Cambridge, who carried out the abduction. The 1922 quad battle was viewed with alarm by the college authorities. The union reminded students that the quadrangle was a \\"dangerous and unsuitable place for ... rags\\" and the editor of the King's student journal went as far as to suggest a premeditated and deliberate aspect to the violence. It was, he said, \\"a good rag ... but got out of hand. It is a pity that the blinding of Mr Johnson…has not taught us that there is a limit.\\" The collapse of the balustrade was widely reported in the press with the Daily News describing a \\"Rag Beyond the Limit\\" and speculating that a release of liquid oxygen stored below the accident area might have led to a violent explosion. King's principal and University College's provost both agreed that although it was a tradition that any damages caused by a rag should be borne by the students responsible, that in this instance the repair bill of £237 should be collectively shared by students of both colleges. 1927 – Students storm University College Two weeks of revelry characterised the 1927 rag. It began when UCL briefly captured Reggie and filled his body with rotten apples before returning him to King's. The response was swift: a contingent of female King's students drove to University College at dawn chanting, \\"For Reggie!\\" while their colleagues stole in via the rear entrance and captured a bust of Jeremy Bentham. The following day, King's students goaded their rivals by parading the bust outside University College. Hostilities recommenced a week later centred on the UCL quad: the ammunition a variety of rotten eggs, fruit and vegetables. At least six students were injured and taken to nearby University College Hospital for treatment following the commencement of hostilities at 2 pm. King's were quickly reinforced by lorries carrying Covent Garden market refuse but many of their contingent, including Reggie, were trapped after police ordered the shutting of the UCL gates. Only a last minute scramble and the hauling of Reggie over the gates saved the King's commander- in-chief from the ignominy of capture and ransom. As with the rag of 1922, the college authorities responded with a public tightening of discipline and a warning that \\"any further disturbances created by the students of the college with students of University College will be regarded as a breach of discipline and treated accordingly.\\" 1929 The sports' ground at Mitcham became the scene of a rag between UCL and King's in December when rival groups hurled rotten fruit and vegetables from lorries. The encounter followed a secret operation the previous night when King's students had infiltrated UCL's grounds and tarred and feathered one of the statues in front of the entrance. 1938–1945: World War II The rivalry was suspended during World War II because of the evacuation of faculties to provincial cities and the change in mood which was summed up by a representative at the British Students' congress at Leeds who spoke of the need for students to contribute to the war effort and not be viewed as 'dilettante idiots'. 1950–present The truce survived until 1950, when hostilities between the colleges broke out afresh during the Bonfire celebrations on 5 November. King's students stormed the UCL quad, setting fire to two large pyres and throwing fireworks from the college steps. While this was happening, two thousand UCL students circled Piccadilly Circus in painted lorries, to demand a lengthening of pub opening hours. Thirteen arrests followed when flour was thrown and a fight broke out over a stuffed kangaroo. The last traditional rags took place in the 1950s. In 1952, police broke up a series of races in the Strand between King's and UCL students dressed as camels and a cow. More daringly, in 1956, King's Engineers grabbed Phineas from a cabinet in the University College Union after melting off its locks, the very day before the visit of the Queen Mother to inspect the Scottish Highlander. A tarred and feathered Phineas was restored with moments to spare. Across the United Kingdom, student priorities began to change with the enlargement of the university sector in the 1960s. The growth of provincial higher education both enhanced the possibilities for the rag and the dangers of 'town and gown' tensions between permanent local, and transient student, populations. Universities across Britain tried to build bridges with local people, especially through fund raising initiatives for local charities. However, the 1960s, 70s and 80s all bore witness to a more politically aware student population with demonstrations and sit-ins against Vietnam, university cuts and the poll tax. In this more highly charged climate, the traditional rag might have looked anachronistic and somewhat juvenile. Nevertheless, there remained a place for conventional high spirits, in particular occasioned by King's renewed participation in the Lord Mayor's Show. Today, annual RAG events take place in universities throughout the United Kingdom to raise money for charities. The days of the sometimes dangerous outcomes of Student Rags, such as the fate of visiting American temperance evangelist, \\"Pussyfoot\\" Johnson who lost an eye in a battle with King's students in 1919, are over. Women The involvement of women in rags drew considerable comment during the 1920s. Under a headline \\"Women and those 'Rags'\\", a The Star reporter claimed in 1929 that most women students were disdainful of the activities. Miss Paul, a tutor to women students at King's, insisted portentously that \\"displays of boisterousness were really exclusively men's affairs\\". However, women clearly played a central role in 1920s rags, including the raid on University College in 1927. Other intercollegiate rivalries within the University of London Within the University of London student rivalry was not confined to King's and UCL, but spilled over into contests with Imperial, Queen Mary colleges and the London School of Economics. One well-planned and successful rag against the LSE during the 1920s involved the King's Liberal Party Society organising an impostor to play the part of David Lloyd George, complete with morning coat and limousine, who proceeded to address the LSE Students' Union in an appropriately overdramatic performance. A riot ensued when the angry audience realised they had been duped and the actor sent flying before rescue by a strategically placed King's rowing heavy. Following the Second World War, King's was involved in numerous kidnapping and ransoming of rival mascots, including Queen Mary's leopard and the LSE Penguin. In 1935 a failed attempt was made by student of Queen Mary to capture Reggie the Lion – \\"A further attempt to obtain a mascot [by QMUL] was made in 1935 and deserved a better result. One Wednesday afternoon, a well organized party assembled by devious routes in King's College and at zero hour took up their appointed posts. The porters were confined to their lodge and all entrances and exits were guarded. But Reggie the lion was chained in steel to the wall, and the porters had telephoned the police for aid! A hasty retreat was made with no casualties.\\" A triumph for Queen Mary students came in 1923 during a football cup final between Queen Mary and University College. \\"The match was to be played on the Arsenal Football Club ground at Highbury, and the rag-committee had obtained an option on a fleet of donkeys and carts on which it was proposed to drive down to the ground. Unknown to this committee a few research chemists thought of something better. They prepared a special paint, that would not easily wash off, and in the early hours of the morning, dodging the police on their beats they set to work on the imposing frontage of University College. Next morning, London was startled to find the place resplendent in the college colours, light blue and gold! An irate telephone call from Sir Gregory Foster to the Principal exposed the infamous deed. The cup-final match was promptly placed \\"out of bounds\\", but after many violent student demonstrations this ban was lifted just before lunch and the College supporters flocked down to Highbury under promise to abstain from ragging. University College won the match 5–4, and at the end called for three cheers for the \\"College of Decorators\\". The Union Society had to pay the bill of £50 for the removal of the paint. But we think it well worth it.\\"  See also  * College rivalry  References  External links  * King's College London's Archives & Special Collections * * Category:King's College London Category:University College London Category:Rivalry ","title":"King's College London–UCL rivalry"},{"id":"10111284","text":"Dan Schueftan () (also Dan Shiftan) ) is an Israeli academic and chairman of the National Security Studies Center at the University of Haifa.

Both eyes are usually affected. The corneas gradually become pigmented and infiltrated by blood vessels, and the dog may eventually become blind. Signs and symptoms CSK is usually a bilateral progressive condition, however the lesions are not symmetrical nor are they painful. Signs include pigmentation and vascularization of the cornea (extension of blood vessels onto the cornea). It is usually first seen at the lateral (temporal) limbus (the junction between the cornea and sclera), although it eventually can extend from any part of the limbus to cover the entire cornea. Severe cases can cause blindness. Although CSK is usually identifiable by the appearance of the eye and the breed of the affected dog, cytology will reveal the presence of lymphocytes and plasma cells. Cause CSK is immune-mediated in nature, characterized by an infiltration of white blood cells into the superficial stroma of the cornea. These cells are predominantly CD4-expressing T lymphocytes and to a lesser extent CD8-expressing T cells. The CD4-expressing T-cells secrete gamma interferon, which causes expression of the major histocompatibility complex class II molecules in the cells of the cornea. These class II molecules cause further inflammation by interacting with the T cells and triggering an immune response. Ultraviolet light is important in the genesis of the disease which is seen at higher prevalence at elevated altitude and has a seasonal variation with most cases occurring in the summer. There is likely also a genetic component to the cause of CSK due to its predominance in certain breeds. Treatment Treatment of CSK is usually with topical corticosteroids or topical cyclosporine, but any treatment only controls and reduces the inflammation rather than providing a cure. Other investigated treatments include pimecrolimus, a derivative of ascomycin that interferes with T cell activation and inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines. Strontium-90 radiation therapy is also used to treat CSK. Canine sunglasses have also been used to help protect the eyes of dogs with CSK to prevent further damage from ultraviolet radiation. Epidemiology Chronic superficial keratitis is most commonly seen in German Shepherds, but it is also found in Belgian Tervurens, Greyhounds, Siberian Huskies, Australian Shepherds, and Border Collies.

(subscription required) Early life She was born in 1873 to Simpson Rostron, a barrister from Beddington, Surrey, and his wife Christina Jane (née Riley), both of whom held strong Christian beliefs, and were deeply involved in the activities of the Church of England, as well as being active in the Conservative Party. Marriage and family On 15 June 1899, she married George Henry Hudson Pile, a childhood friend and son of a former Speaker of the House of Assembly of Barbados. In 1914, she became Beatrix Lyall when her husband changed his surname by deed poll, assuming his mother's maiden name. They settled in Chelsea, London and had a son, Archibald, and a daughter, Christina Marion. World War One By 1914, Beatrix Lyall was known in her role as leader of the Mothers Union, and was noted for her public speaking skills and her campaigning for child welfare. During the war she gave her services to a number of government departments and served on the War Savings Committee. She gave addresses to munitions workers and miners which were published by the British Women's Patriotic League. In 1919 she was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for her services during the conflict. Politics Lyall's high public profile led to her being approached by the Conservative- backed Municipal Reform Party to stand for election to the London County Council. In March 1919 she was duly elected as a councillor for Fulham East. In 1924 she was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire. She served as vice-chairman of the council from 1932–1933, and was the first woman to hold the post. In 1934 she lost her seat on the council when the Labour Party took control for the first time. She returned to the council in December 1935 when a by-election was held, but did not stand for the subsequent election in 1937. Later years and death Following her retirement from local politics, Lyall continued to be active in the Mothers Union, authoring pamphlets promoting \\"Christian marriage\\" and denouncing divorce. She was made a life vice-president of the organisation in 1937. She was to suffer the loss of her daughter in October 1937, and of her husband in May 1938. During the Second World War, she was appointed head of hospital supplies for South London, and was a member of the executive of the National Council of Women. She spent her final years at the Prince of Wales Hotel in Kensington. She died at the hotel in May 1948 from heart failure, aged 74. She was cremated at Golders Green.

In the midst of the 18th century one of the Topchubashis, Agha bey moved to Erevan, thus splitting the family into two major branches – Ganja branch and Erevan branch. At the second half of the 18th century, Alimardan bey Topchubashi was the prominent member of the Ganja branch of this family, first being in charge of Ganja Khanate’s relations and correspondence with Russia, then moving to Tiflis in 1795 and becoming Georgia’s official responsible for relations with Iran. But despite all efforts of diplomacy, even Russian protectorate over Georgia couldn’t save kingdom and its capital Tiflis from Iranian king Agha Mohammad Shah Gajar’s assault. On September 11, 1795 the Iranian army entered Tiflis. Plunder of the city went on eight days and regardless of their faith all city dwellers were taken captives. It was in that days that Alimardan bey’s daughter was lost and son Jafar (future Mirza Jafar Topchubashev, Russian Orientalist of Azerbaijani origin, employee of Russian Foreign Ministry and professor of Petersburg University) hardly escaped captivity and hid in Alabno monastery. Later Jafar Topchubashev continued his education in Tiflis, and joined the retinue of Georgian prince Teimuraz Bagrationi and accompanied him to St.Petersburg. There, Mirza Jafar and Teimuraz translated the Psalter into Russian and also compiled Italian-Persian-Turkic dictionary. In 1812 Mirza Jafar enrolled into Russian Foreign Ministry, in 1819 he started to teach Persian in General Pedagogical Institute and in 1823 became professor of Petersburg university.

It is one of the largest in the area, falling within the Southern Region of the Education Authority Northern Ireland. Unlike many grammar providers in Northern Ireland the school does not make use of extra transfer tests instead it offers children grammar provision on the basis of their academic ability as evidenced through their primary school attainment.  History and development  Founded as Cookstown Academy in 1806 by Rev Thomas Miller Senior the school has been through numerous transformations in the centuries since then. It merged with the Ladies Boarding School in the town around 1924 by which time it was known as Cookstown College. The school was renamed Cookstown High School in 1934 by which time it was a grammar school. In 1955 a new, state of the art building was erected for it in Coolnafranky Demesne and placed adjacent to a newly created School, Cookstown Secondary Intermediate School. These two schools shared the site and some facilities until the nineteen seventies. In 1977 the two schools merged into one taking the badge and motto of the grammar school with a slightly amended uniform. Today's school has retained its academic tradition and focus while also providing vocational pathways to ensure that all pupils are able to access the curriculum. Pupils are placed on differentiated pathways guided by their academic ability and educational needs.  Site  The school is situated on the Coolnafranky site in Cookstown. This site is one of the largest in Northern Ireland and is dominated by a large nineteenth-century gentleman's residence named Coolnafranky House. The house is a listed building and provides accommodation for Sixth Form study, the school nurse, a kitchen and numerous meeting rooms. The school site is wooded and has extensive green areas. In addition to numerous tennis courts it also contains the two artificial turf pitches used by the school and by Cookstown Hockey Club. It is the only school in Northern Ireland to have two full sized hockey pitches (one sand based, one water based). The school has five main buildings: * Block 1: The 'Upper' Building, housing the Technology, ICT, Art, English, History, Religious Education, Physical Education, Home Economics, Geography, Business Studies and Health and Social Care Departments. * Block 2: The Morrison (Middle) Building - General Office, Principal's and Vice-Principals' offices, 2 school restaurants, the Music Department and the Sixth Form Centre, comprising a common room and study areas. * Block 3: The 'Lower' Building - Modern Languages (French, German, Spanish), Maths, and Biology and Physics departments. * Block 4: The Learning Support Unit and changing rooms for the pitches. * Block 5: New Science Building (Chemistry Block).  Motto  The school's motto is \\"Virtus Cum Scientia\\" which means \\"character through knowledge\\". The school hymn is \\"Lead Me, Lord, Lead Me in Thy Righteousness\\" by Samuel Sebastian Wesley.

The Editorial Team is led by Mrs Leanne Johnston, who is assisted by a team of pupils. Reports and pictures are included of the Year 8 pupils, Year 13+14 pupils and of all pupils' academic, social, extra curricular and sporting achievements in the school, including the concert band and choirs. For the school year 2006–2007, the style of the magazine was reverted to its original A4 size, which had been abandoned in 2003.  CHS sport  Sport is a fundamental part of life at the high school. Sports offered at the school include football, netball, hockey, rugby union, cross-country running and athletics. The school is known for its preference for hockey. In previous seasons (notably 2008–09), the 1st XI have won the McCullough Cup and Burney Cup, both for the second year running, beating Sullivan Upper and Banbridge Academy in the finals respectively. However the boys lost their Irish Schools crown after losing 3-2 to St. Andrews College, Dublin. They were to avenge this defeat at the end of season inaugural John Waring All Ireland Schoolboys Championships, when they defeated St. Andrews College in the final by 2 goals to nil. In 2007–2008, the boy's first team won the All Ireland Schoolboys Hockey Championship when they defeated the holders Banbridge Academy by four goals to two in the final. This was followed six weeks later by a penalty shoot-out victory over the same opponents in the Final of the McCullough Cup. The boys capped a terrific season by completing the treble by winning the Burney Cup against Royal & Prior. This marked the first season the school had achieved this feat. In the 2006–2007 season, the boys first team reached the semi-final of both the McCullough Cup and the All Ireland Schoolboys Hockey Championship, and the final of the Burney Cup.  School traditions  There are a number of annual events at the high School. Prize Day is a tradition within the school where those pupils, who have excelled in their studies, are formally congratulated and rewarded on their successes. There is an academic procession with teaching staff wearing academic dress and a special guest is invited to speak. Typically held in the third or fourth week of the new school year, it celebrates those who have excelled in their Year 8, Year 9, Year 10, Year 11, GCSE, AS and A-Level studies, along with those who have excelled when it comes to sporting achievements and contributions to school life. The School Formal Dinner Dance is held in October. This event is organized by the Head Boy and Head Girl. It is attended by hundreds of pupils from Sixth Form and Year Twelve as well as many members of staff. In November a Service of Remembrance is held at the school war memorial. The memorial was dedicated in 2013 in memory of former pupils and staff who died in the service of their country. It was designed by local artist Mr George Gourley a past pupil and former Head of Art at the school. Wreaths are laid on behalf of pupils, the Former Pupils Association and the Parent Teachers and Friends Association. It is attended by members of the school community and representatives of civic society. Each year the CHS Society for Music and Drama presents a play or musical in the Upper Hall. Performances usually run over two or three nights in December and up to one hundred pupils and staff regularly participate. The Director is Mrs Linda Armstrong and the Musical Director Mrs Fiona Gormley, Head of Music. On the last day of the Christmas term pupils and staff walk to Molesworth Church for the Carol service. The school choirs sing and music is provided by the school band. Lessons are read by Senior Prefects and representatives of the wider school community. Governors and guests are afterwards entertained to festive food in Coolnafranky House. The Spring Concert is usually held close to Easter and offers an opportunity for pupils involved in music to showcase their talent across a range of genres. The event is co-hosted by the Head Boy and Head Girl. Each term ends with a ‘Final Assembly’. At this event senior staff present awards that have been won for pupil achievement and update the school community on the progress of the house competition. In the summer term this assembly includes farewells to departing staff and the presentation of the Year Eight House Cup and the House Cup for the overall winner.

It depicts the town of Wimborne as it was at the time the model was originally made in the 1950s, and captures the essence of a typical market town of rural England at that time. The concrete model, built at 1/10 scale, features 120 buildings including 108 shop fronts and a 15 ft (5m) high Minster. The shop windows accurately show the goods the shops were selling in the post war years.Dorset Echo Online - 17 April 2001 Originally built on a site just to the north-west of the actual Wimborne Minster church, it became run-down in the 1980s, and a group of volunteers set up a charity and were given an area of 0.4 hectare (1 acre) of Green Belt land off King Street to restore the attraction. Although such use of Green Belt land would normally have been deemed inappropriate development, the District planners considered that the model's retention in the town was a 'special circumstance'. The Council has since permitted over 245 square metres of temporary classroom buildings incorporating a visitors centre, cafe/gift shop, toilets etc. together with play cabins associated with the children's play area.East Dorset District Council Planning, Licensing and Enforcement Committee Agenda Item No 6, 19 November 2002 Additional attractions have been added in recent years, including a model railway based on Thomas the Tank Engine, which was opened by Christopher Awdry.

Set in the fantasy world of Tyria, the game follows the re-emergence of Destiny's Edge, a disbanded guild dedicated to fighting the Elder Dragons, a Lovecraftian species that has seized control of Tyria in the time since the original Guild Wars. The game takes place in a persistent world with a story that progresses in instanced environments. Guild Wars 2 claims to be unique in the genre by featuring a storyline that is responsive to player actions, something which is common in single player role-playing games but rarely seen in multiplayer ones. A dynamic event system replaces traditional questing, utilising the ripple effect to allow players to approach quests in different ways as part of a persistent world. Also of note is the combat system, which aims to be more dynamic than its predecessor by promoting synergy between professions and using the environment as a weapon, as well as reducing the complexity of the Magic-style skill system of the original game. As a sequel to Guild Wars, Guild Wars 2 features the same lack of subscription fees that distinguished its predecessor from other commercially developed online games of the time, though until August 2015 a purchase was still required to install the game. The game sold over two million copies in its first two weeks. By August 2013, the peak player concurrency had reached 460,000. By August 2015, over 5 million copies had been sold, at which point the base game became free-to- play. Gameplay Guild Wars 2 uses a heavily modified version of the proprietary game engine developed for Guild Wars by ArenaNet. The modifications to the engine include real-time 3D environments, enhanced graphics and animations and the use of the Havok physics system. The developers say the engine now does justice to the game's critically acclaimed concept art, and that concept art will be integrated into the way the story is told to the player. Guild Wars 2 allows a player to create a character from a combination of five races and eight professions, the five races being the humans and charr, introduced in Prophecies, the asura and norn, introduced in Eye of the North, and the sylvari, a race exclusive to Guild Wars 2. The professions, three of which do not appear in Guild Wars, are divided into armor classes: \\"scholars\\" with light armor, \\"adventurers\\" with medium armor, and \\"soldiers\\" with heavy armor. There is no dedicated healing class as the developers felt that making it necessary for every party to have a healer was restrictive. The race and profession of the player determines the skills they can access. Guild Wars 2, like Guild Wars, uses a skill-based combat system, whereby players must select only 10 skills from a much larger pool, introducing an element of strategy. However, unlike Guild Wars, skill slots have predefined roles: the first five are determined by player's weapon and profession, the sixth is for healing, the seventh through ninth will be skills with no defined roles that are unlocked as the game progresses, and the tenth slot will be for an \\"elite\\" skill, which is also initially locked. In a departure from the high number of skills present in Guild Wars, Guild Wars 2 will focus on quality of skills over quantity and will also reduce the overall number of game modes to reduce balancing complexity — one of the most common issues present in MMORPGs. The low level cap of Guild Wars (20) has been replaced with one at 80, which the developers state strikes the correct balance between allowing for character development and avoiding forcing players into the grind-based gameplay that too often accompanies a high level cap, the elimination of which was a core design principle of the original Guild Wars. Player versus environment features a scaling system that lowers the players level and stats to reflect the levels of monsters, thereby maintaining a global level of difficulty. In player versus player, a player will have access to almost all skills and items, and compete at the fixed level 80, so that all players will be on a level playing field. In addition to the small-scale, tactical combat described above, the game features \\"World versus World\\", large scale combat taking place in a persistent world independent of the main world. Players are able to drop in and out \\"on the fly\\" and possess the ability to construct siege weapons, with rewards commensurate with their success. Guild Wars 2 offers eight crafting disciplines, allowing the player to practice two at a time, with a fee for switching. While there are basic recipes to follow, the player can experiment with different combinations of ingredients to discover new recipes. As the game is set 250 years after its predecessor, players are unable to carry over their characters. However, the achievements and honors accumulated by all the characters on players' Guild Wars accounts. Each achievement earns points which confer certain bonuses in Guild Wars 2. The accounts of both games must be linked in order to acquire these bonuses. Plot=Setting Although humans begin Guild Wars 2 at a disadvantage, significant technological advances have taken place in the years since Guild Wars Guild Wars 2 takes place in the high fantasy world of Tyria, 250 years after the players' defeat of the Great Destroyer in the Eye of the North expansion. Five so-called Elder Dragons sleeping beneath the continent have awoken in the time since Guild Wars, causing widespread destruction to Tyria and corrupting its inhabitants. The once dominant humans of Tyria are in decline, supplanted from most of their land by natural disasters and war with the Charr, who have finally reclaimed the last vestiges of their ancestral homeland of Ascalon from the humans. To the north, the Norn, a proud race of Nordic hunters, have been forced south by the rise of Jormag, the elder dragon of ice. In the west, the technologically advanced Asura have been forced to establish permanent homes above-ground after the minions of the first dragon to awaken, Primordus, took control of the Depths of Tyria. Near the forests where the Asura make their home are the Sylvari, a new race who have appeared in Tyria in the last 25 years, unaffected by the difficulties that plague the other races but with some as yet unexplained connection to the Elder Dragons. To the south, the continent of Cantha has been cut off by an isolationist and xenophobic political climate, which is reinforced by Zhaitan's undead navy. The continent of Elona, too, has been cut off; the only hint of its continued prosperity being the ongoing battle between the lich Palawa Joko's Mordant Crescent and Kralkatorrik, the crystal dragon in the Crystal Desert, as well as occasional reports from Order of Whispers (a secretive organization) spies. The Battle Isles have been wiped off the map entirely by the tidal wave caused by the re- emergence of the fallen kingdom of Orr, which came with the awakening of Zhaitan. The advancement of time from Guild Wars is reflected in the changes in culture, including armor and clothing, as well as in the advancement of in- game technology and a unified common language. Story The player is tasked with reuniting the members of the disbanded Destiny's Edge, a multi- racial adventuring guild whose members' struggles and eventual reunion serve as a microcosmic metaphor for the larger-scale unification of the playable races, whose combined strength is needed to effectively combat Zhaitan, the undead Elder Dragon. After the defeat of the Elder Dragon Zhaitan in the game's \\"Personal Story\\", Season 1 of the \\"Living World\\" began. This story followed the player character joining a new group of characters to battle the enigmatic and insane Sylvari, Scarlet Briar, as she created strange enemy groups such as the Molten Alliance (a team-up between evil Charr and mole-like Dredge), the Toxic Alliance (a combination of lizard-like Krait and a spliter group from the Nightmare Court, a group of evil Sylvari), and the Aetherblades, steampunk sky pirates. As the player and their new group of heroes, made up of characters from each race, battle Scarlet, they also learn about her past and investigate what she could be searching for. The season culminated with Scarlet attacking the city of Lion's Arch, landing a giant drill known as The Breachmaker in the center of the City. The player and their fellow heroes fought back, and killed Scarlet, but not before Lion's Arch was left in ruins and the Breachmaker pierces a Ley Line, awakening a previously unknown jungle Elder Dragon, Mordremoth. Season 2 of the \\"Living World\\" picked up where Season 1 left off, sending the player towards the Maguuma Wastes to battle Mordremoth with the help of their fellow heroes and Destiny's Edge. The season began with the crashing of the Zephyrite Sanctum, a group of airships populated by followers of the now-dead dragon, Glint, who had escaped from the control of the Elder Dragons and had tried to help Destiny's Edge kill one of the Elder Dragons before the events of the game. The player and their allies followed Scarlet Briar's path into Dry Top, a region to the west, and learned about the Elder Dragons. The player also learned of an egg laid by Glint before her death and went in search of it. Later, all of the races united against Mordemoth, and the Pact prepare once again to battle an Elder Dragon. However, while the player hunted down Glint's Egg and learned many secrets from the past, the Pact fleet was destroyed over the jungle by a devastating attack by Mordremoth. Heart Of Thorns brings the player's attention to the shattered Pact fleet. The player has chased after Glint's egg, stolen by the Sylvari member of Destiny's Edge. Finding the remaining Pact Soldiers, the player commands the Pact to regroup and begin holding the point within the Verdant Brink, using the fallen fleet as an opportunity to begin an assault on the jungle. Mordremoth schemes to take the egg, and crush the Pact once and for all. Advancing further towards the jungle on the trail of the lost Sylvari, the player faces the loss of a member of Destiny's Edge, but in a twist of fate, is reunited with the egg. Making way through the jungle with the Pact, the player encounters the mysterious Exalted. Followers of the forgotten, and protectors of Glint's offspring, teach the player the importance of the egg, and have the player leave the egg in their golden city, so the player may advance towards the dragon. Within the jungle, an ancient Asuran city is discovered, revealing large quantities of information regarding the powers of the dragons, and vicious predators, with the Pact taking the point to break into the dragon's territory, and end the fight once and for all. After an all out assault and rescue, the player must face the dragon Mordremoth, and defeats him within the mind of the Pact Marshal, but at the cost of the Marshal's life. As Mordremoth fades, the continent of Tyria feels a massive shock as magic flows once more. Development The decision to start creating Guild Wars 2 began in a design meeting for Guild Wars Utopia, back when the company was releasing campaigns on a sixth-month development cycle. The team realised that they would not be able to do everything they wanted within the constraints of the scope that they had previously defined for campaigns and the limited amount of time available to them, and at the behest of Jeff Strain, found themselves discussing how the continued addition of features and content in stand-alone campaigns was leading to more bloated tutorials and difficulty in balancing the ever-increasing number of skills. Eventually, the discussion evolved into a blueprint for an entirely new game.PC Gamer no. 161, May 2007 Work on Guild Wars 2 began in 2007. It was announced March 27, 2007 to coincide with the announcement of the final Guild Wars expansion, which was designed to act as a bridge, in both gameplay and story terms, to Guild Wars 2. The development team abandoned the early open alpha and beta testing which they had used for the Guild Wars game. ArenaNet considered that player expectations for open beta tests of MMORPG had changed, and the beta was no longer used to test the game but to trial a nearly finished game prior to purchase. Beta tests scheduled for 2008 were cancelled to ensure Guild Wars 2 had maximum impact and appeal to these players. In August 2009, two years after the game was first announced, ArenaNet decided the game had reached a state where they were happy to show it to the public. A trailer which mixed animated concept art and in-game footage was released at Gamescom, followed by interviews expanding on the lore of the game world and information about the player races. In November 2009, NCsoft CEO Jaeho Lee stated the game would most likely not release until 2011, but a closed beta would be made available in 2010. The Q4 2009 shareholders notes further supported this when the CEO stated that \\"the current development target was the end of 2010 but, Guild Wars 2 likely won't be released until 2011.\\" A playable demo of the game was made available at Gamescom (19–22 August 2010), Penny Arcade Expo (3–5 September 2010) and Paris Games Week (27 October-1 November 2010). The game was developed for Microsoft Windows with a \\"very small team\\" investigating the possibility of a console version. ArenaNet conducted small closed alpha and beta tests in 2011. On 23 January 2012 it was announced that Guild Wars 2 will ship this year. In February, select press were invited to participate in beta testing. In March and April, the size of beta tests was increased significantly as the beta was made available to anyone who pre-purchased the game. On June 28, 2012, ArenaNet announced the game would be released on August 28, 2012 and those who prepurchased the game would be able to play on August 25. On September 18, 2012, a Mac OS X client for Guild Wars 2 was released; it is currently in beta testing. ArenaNet took over the publishing of the game in 2015. Post-launch development Promotion at San Diego Comic-Con International 2011 Guild Wars 2 received content updates every two weeks, but now plans large releases for every few months, with smaller patches and bug fixes between these. Content updates regularly contain new items available for purchase in the gem store, as well as offering unique events for players to engage in. Some content updates introduce new mechanics to the game, such as the addition of new dungeons or the introduction of new combat options. In the Lost Shores content updates released on November 16, 2012, a new dungeon was added to the game. Called Fractals of the Mists, the new dungeon differs from other dungeons in the game by consisting of many smaller \\"mini-dungeons\\" called Fractals. Each fractal contains its own story and environment, and must be completed in order to move on to the next randomly chosen fractal. Once three fractals are completed, a new set of fractals is unlocked that offer a greater challenge than the last. This update also introduced a new rarity level for equipment called Ascended which can be acquired through various sources, though most easily through the Fractals of the Mists dungeon. The Flame and Frost: Prelude update released on January 28, 2013 introduced several new features to Guild Wars 2, including achievement laurels, guesting and new \\"living story\\" content. Achievement laurels are rewarded for earning daily and monthly achievements, and may be used by players to purchase items from certain vendors such as Ascended equipment and infusions for that equipment. Guesting was introduced to allow players to temporarily play on the same server as their friends, without having to transfer their home to a new server. In conjunction with this new feature, a gem fee was added for players wishing to transfer their home to another server. The final new features added during this update was the introduction of Living Story content. The living story in Guild Wars 2 consists of a series of events and other content that players must progress through within a certain amount of time. Once this time has passed, the story progresses and new content is unlocked while the previous content becomes unavailable, though the story's effect on the world remains. Living World content is intended to provide a continuing story thread for players to follow. The two following content updates, Flame and Frost: The Gathering Storm and Flame and Frost: The Razing, released in February and March 2013 respectively added guild missions, introduced a new progression system for Guild Wars 2's WvW game mode, progressed the Flame and Frost living story narrative and introduced content that set up story elements for future living story narratives. Guild missions introduced the ability for guilds to earn guild merits by engaging in bounties and group puzzles Guild leaders can use merits to unlock rewards for their guild. The new WvW progressions system introduced World XP and new WvW ranks, which can be used to unlock new titles and abilities exclusive to WvW. New WvW achievements were also introduced. The Flame and Frost: Retribution update released in April 2013 introduced a new limited availability dungeon, new guild missions, added new WvW abilities and added new purchasable siege weapons and guild banners for WvW play. The new dungeon, Molten Weapons Facility, coincided with the final portion of the Flame and Frost living story narrative and was only available for thirteen days. The new WvW abilities allow players to become more proficient in using the arrow cart in WvW play and allows players to progress through five new levels of the Guild Killer ability line. Introduced in May 2013, the next content update for Guild Wars 2 began a new living story narrative called The Secret of Southsun, which would continue later in the month with a smaller update titled Last Stand at Southsun. In addition to the new living story content, the update introduced another large set of changes to WvW, including the ability for players to set traps in WvW battlegrounds, improvements to the World XP system, improved rewards and new abilities, improvements to the matchup system and the ability for players to use special Ascended and infused equipment in WvW play.  Introduction of the Living Story  In June 2013, two new content updates titled Dragon Bash and Sky Pirates of Tyria introduced a new living story narrative as well as several new features. These features included improvements to the PvP leaderboards, the introduction of the Authorized Shoutcaster Program, the ability for players to purchase items from the gem store as gifts for other players, a large balance update to the game's skills and traits, custom arenas for structure PvP, a new spectator mode and a new ability for players to master in WvW play. The next update was released on July 9, 2013, titled Bazaar of the Four Winds. The largest new feature added in the update was an account-wide achievement system that allows players to unlock rewards based on how many achievement points have been earned. In addition, the update overhauled the achievement interface, introduced a new structured PvP map, and introduced a new WvW mastery. Over the rest of 2013, the updates Cutthroat Politics, Queen's Jubilee, Clockwork Chaos, Super Adventure Box: Back to School. Tequatl Rising, Twilight Assault, Blood and Madness, Tower of Nightmares, The Nightmares Within, Fractured, and A Very Merry Wintersday were released, updating and changing many areas and game mechanics throughout the world. Many of these changes were permanent, leaving a mark on the world to show an event had occurred. Updates included redesigning a boss, adding new paths to Dungeons, and rebalancing playable classes over time. 2014 brought the end of \\"Season 1\\" of the Living Story content updates, The Origins of Madness, The Edge of the Mists, Escape from Lion's Arch, Battle for Lion's Arch, and the finale Battle for Lion's Arch: Aftermath . These updates released a new WvW map, and destroyed the core city of the game's world, Lion's Arch, while setting up the story for the eventual Season 2 of the Living Story. During the down time between Seasons 1 and 2, the April 2014 Feature Pack was released, overhauling the Trait system, the Dyes system, the Cosmetic Wardrobe system, PvP equipment, and the way server load was handled via a system called Megaservers. This created world instances for all players, regardless of their home \\"world\\", to allow the game to feel more populated. The feature pack also fixed numerous bugs and offered balance tweaks to many races and classes. On May 20, 2014, around the time of the Chinese servers release, the update Festival of the Four Winds was released, allowing players to access content from two prior patches, Queen's Jubilee and Bazaar of the Four Winds, alongside new activities.  Living World Season 2  On July 1, 2014, Season 2 of the Living World began with the Gates of Maguuma release, which added a portion of a new explorable area, Dry Top, and changed the way Living World releases worked, no longer making them time-gated to complete. This was followed by Entanglement on July 15, 2014, which added more explorable sections to Dry Top, and added more achievements, new weaponry for players, and a new story segment. On July 29, 2014, The Dragon's Reach: Part 1 was released. This was the first in a two-part set of releases. This updated added a few more rewards to the Dry Top zone, added a few new items and achievements, and added some new events to various zones across the game's world. On August 12, 2014, the second part, The Dragon's Reach: Part 2 was released, concluding part one of the second season of the Living Story and starting a several month hiatus on Living Story content. This update added the final new section to the Dry Top map, new rewards and events, new achievements, and game balances. On September 9, 2014, the second Feature Pack was released, significantly changing and improving the Combat Log, the Black Lion Trading Post, and the New Player Experience, while adding a new type of Achievement called collections, adding a number of changes to the World Versus World gametype, improving the Wardrobe and miniature pets displays, and making a number of rebalances and changes to the game's professions. On October 15, 2014, the previous year's Halloween event, Blood and Madness was re-released with a few new events and rewards. The Living World's second season continued on November 4 with the release Echoes of the Past, which included a lengthy new story segment focusing on the story of Glint and her Dragon Egg among other things, an entire brand new map called The Silverwastes which added WvW mechanics in a PvE environment and including a number of new rewards and collections included an earnable Luminescent Shoulderguard armor piece. This was followed by Tangled Paths released on November 18, 2014, which added a new story segment, a few new rewards including another Luminscent armor piece, and an underground section to the Silverwastes map. On December 2, 2014, the seventh release in Season Two was released, called Seeds of Truth, which contained a new story instance, a large underground addition to the Silverwastes map which nearly doubled the map's size, a number of improvements to PvP and associated matchmaking, and two new Luminescent armor pieces for players to earn. This was followed on January 13, 2015 by Point of No Return, the final eighth and final episode in Season 2. This update included several new story instances, a brand new large group boss, two new Luminescent armor pieces for players to earn, and a number of new achievements, among other things. This episode serves to lead directly into the first expansion, Heart of Thorns. Heart of Thorns expansion On January 24, 2015, at PAX South held in San Antonio, ArenaNet announced the first expansion for the game titled Heart of Thorns. The expansion introduced new group challenges, new profession specializations, a new profession, and an account-based \\"mastery\\" system for character progression through the new territories featured in it, as well as changes to current player versus player content. It was released on October 23, 2015 to positive reviews. With the second of the Living World seasons over, and an expansion on the way, releases were smaller as teasers for the expansion were released. On January 27, 2015, a number of bug fixes and balance improvements were released. Following that, a small scale Festival was released on February 10, 2015 called the Lunar New Year. This update included a relaunch of an older activity called Dragon Ball, featuring reworked gameplay, as well as new Daily Lunar New Year achievements, and new rewards. On August 29, 2015, the base game was made free to download. The free version of the game includes some restrictions over the core game, such as fewer character slots and some chat limitations. Living World Season 3 The first episode of the 3rd season of the Living World was announced on 12 July 2016. Entitled Out of the Shadows, it was released on July 26, 2016, containing a new story instance and map with related achievements, a new PvP map with related achievements, a new fractal, some tweaks to the PvP and WvW game modes, and a number of balance changes. Path of Fire expansion Guild Wars 2: Path of fire is the second expansion pack for Guild Wars 2. It was made available for pre-purchase on August 1, 2017 and released on September 22, 2017. The expansion introduces new features such as mounts, additional elite specializations for each profession, a bounty system for defeating certain enemies, and access to the areas of the Crystal Desert and Elona (first seen in the first game's Guild Wars Nightfall expansion). It will also introduce new raids and season four of the living world storyline. Living World Season 4 Living World Season 4 refers to a schedule of content updates, beginning on the 28th of November, 2017. It continues the story of Guild Wars 2: Path of Fire, picking up immediately where the story instance Small Victory (Epilogue) left off. This article assumes knowledge of the storyline up to and including Path of Fire. The energy released upon the death of Balthazar has been absorbed by both Kralkatorrik and Aurene. The Commander and his or her allies must contend with an empowered Elder Dragon threatening Elona, which remains under the thrall of Palawa Joko's Awakened army. Reception Guild Wars 2 was released to universal acclaim. It received a score of 90/100 on Metacritic. PC Gamers Chris Thursten gave the game a 94% rating, calling it \\"an accomplished and rewarding online RPG that does a great deal to reclaim the promise of its genre.\\" IGN's Charles Onyett rated the game a 9/10, commenting that the game is \\"one of the most exhaustively detailed and rewarding MMOs in existence, one that never unfairly penalizes and fosters an incredible urge to explore through a generous reward system and achingly pretty environment design\\". GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd opened his review with \\"Guild Wars 2 is a paradise for explorers and thrill-seekers alike, and the best online role-playing game in years\\" and gave the game a 9.0/10. Computer and Video Games Games Editor Andy Kelly gave a verdict of 8.9/10 closing with \\"An entertaining MMO that combats the dreaded grind with smart design. The lack of a monthly subscription fee only sweetens the deal.\\" GamesRadar's Hollander Cooper wrote in his review, \\"Everything a massively- multiplayer online RPG should be. It's original, massive in scope, and wonderfully social, removing many of the gates that held back the genre in the past. Being able to play with friends regardless of level or class is a gigantic leap forward, and one that, when mixed in with all of the other innovations in the genre, make Guild Wars 2 one of the best MMOs currently available.\\" and giving it 4.5/5 and GameSpy's Leif Johnson wrote, \\"To Guild Wars 2's credit, its issues do little to detract from the immensely rewarding experience of the whole. It doesn't overthrow the conventions of the MMORPG, but it presents them in fresher and livelier packaging than its competitors.\\" Time listed Guild Wars 2 as the top video game of 2012. Editor Matt Peckham noted that \\"Guild Wars 2 is one of those rare games that unexpectedly knocks your life off-kilter, like a meteoroid banging into a satellite\\"... [It has] the feel of a living world, and the sort of compulsive anywhere-you-go playability other MMOs only dream of.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Official website Category:2012 video games Category:Active massively multiplayer online games Category:Fantasy massively multiplayer online role- playing games Category:Free-to-play video games Category:Guild Wars Category:LGBT-related video games Category:MacOS games Category:MacOS massively multiplayer online role-playing games Category:Massively multiplayer online role-playing games Category:NCSoft Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games scored by Jeremy Soule Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Video games using Havok ","title":"Guild Wars 2"},{"id":"10111396","text":"A fillet corner sample. Note the flat \\"lip\\". In the picture framing industry, a fillet (also referred to as a slip) is a small piece of moulding which fits inside a larger frame or, typically, underneath or in between matting, used for decorative purposes. The picture framing term is probably related to, though not necessarily derived from, the engineering term, which it is frequently pronounced similarly to; however, unlike the use of fillets in mechanical engineering, the use of \\"fillets\\" in picture frames is wholly decorative. Pronunciation Fillet can be pronounced in two ways. One way is to pronounce it as if it were \\"fill-it\\", as the similar term from mechanical engineering is pronounced. The other is similar to the French-derived culinary term. Either is acceptable in English, though most frame shops prefer one or the other pronunciation. Construction Fillets are typically made of soft or hard wood, and feature a flat \\"lip\\" which can fit underneath a mat; the non-lip portion is what is displayed. Except for their shape and size (which is understandably small), fillets are constructed similarly to picture frames, usually from wood or polystyrene. Metal fillets are very rare. Fillets are available in a number of styles and finishes, including gold and silver leaf finishes. Uses The fillet is normally used as decoration in the lining of a picture frame or underneath a mat inside one; the intent is to help draw the eye inwards to the document being framed. However, one can also use inverted fillets as form of picture frame on small, flat objects, as seen below: An old greeting card, framed with an inverted fillet In this case, the card was glued to the lip of the inverted fillet (which is thus hidden behind the back of the card). Objects such as this that have been framed using inverted fillets can be backed and then affixed to wire for hanging, displayed on an easel, or used inside of a larger shadowbox display. It is important to note that only very small, extremely flat objects can be framed using only an inverted fillet, as a fillet lacks the depth of a traditional picture frame, and due to its size, weight and construction, could not support a great amount of weight on its own.

In October 2017, she made her 250th international appearance for the Australian women's cricket team. In November 2019, she announced her retirement from cricket, after a career that spanned eighteen years. Her identical twin sister Kate has also played for Australia. Blackwell made her senior debut for New South Wales in the 2001–02 Women's National Cricket League (WNCL). Playing in the middle-order she had little to do as the opposition bowlers struggled to penetrate the New South Wales batting line-up. Blackwell made 33 runs at 33.00 in her debut season as New South Wales won the WNCL. The following season, she batted higher up the order and made 212 runs at 30.28, and was selected for the national team at the end of the season with a WNCL career total of only 245 runs. Making her international debut in 2002–03 in a quadrangular One Day International (ODI) tournament, she had few opportunities with the bat, scoring 54 runs at 27.00 but was unexpectedly successful with the ball, taking a total of 4/34 despite only having one previous wicket at senior level. She made her Test debut in a two-match series against England immediately afterwards, hitting a half-century in the latter fixture. Alex Blackwell is the 142nd woman to play Test cricket for Australia. Over the next two years, Blackwell was inconsistent at international level and was in and out of the team due to poor performance. However, she was able to maintain her position for the 2005 World Cup in South Africa, playing in all but one match as Australia won the tournament without a loss. Playing in the middle-order, she was not required to bat often as the opposition rarely broke through the Australian batting, making 67 runs at 33.50. Her 53 against New Zealand was her first half-century in ODIs. However, Blackwell made only 48 from four Test innings during the subsequent tour of England and was unable to cement her place in the Australian team. Blackwell had a prolific 2005–06 WNCL season, scoring 411 runs including her maiden century, but was unable to translate her good domestic form into results for Australia, making only 83 runs in four innings against India at the end of the season. After missing the first half of the 2006–07 season due to injury, Blackwell had a stint for Otago in New Zealand's State League, scoring 315 runs at 52.50. However, her international form remained poor and she was dropped midway through an ODI tournament in India after making 54 runs in four innings. She earned a recall midway through the subsequent Rose Bowl series against New Zealand. Blackwell established herself at international level in 2007–08. After making 291 runs at 41.57 in the WNCL, she broke through for her maiden ODI century in the home series against England. She made another fifty later in the series, followed by consecutive half-centuries against New Zealand, ending the international season with 389 runs at 43.22. After playing in the Women's County Championship in England in 2008, Blackwell made 255 runs at 85.00 with a century and two fifties as Australia swept India 5–0 at home at the start of the 2008–09 season. She continued her strong form in the WNCL, scoring 372 runs at 62.00. Blackwell made consecutive fifties in the two warm-up matches and then scored 190 runs at 38.00 as Australia came fourth in the 2009 World Cup. She had a poor ODI tour of England, making single-figure scores in all five matches, before returning to Australia to score 489 runs at 61.12 in the WNCL, including two centuries, as New South Wales won for the fifth consecutive time, and making 191 runs at 47.75 in the T20 tournament. Blackwell led Australia in the Rose Bowl series in early-2010 after regular captain Jodie Fields was sidelined due to injury. They won all eight ODIs but lost all five T20 internationals. Blackwell made 235 runs at 33.57 including two fifties. In February 2018, she announced her retirement from international cricket, but would continue to play in the Women's Big Bash League. In November 2018, she was named in Sydney Thunder's squad for the 2018–19 Women's Big Bash League season.  Early years  Blackwell was born in Wagga Wagga, but raised in Yenda, a small rural town outside of Griffith, New South Wales. She and her identical twin sister Kate attended Barker College on the North Shore of Sydney as boarders. In March 2000, Blackwell was called into the New South Wales team for the Under-17 interstate competition. In the first match, she took 3/7 and was not required to bat in a ten-wicket victory over Victoria Blue. Her top-score for the tournament came in the sixth match against Western Australia, when she scored 57 not out. New South Wales won all of their eight matches to claim the competition and Blackwell ended with 149 runs at 37.25 and seven wickets at 17.00.  Domestic debut  Blackwell batting for the NSW Breakers, 2017 During the 2001–02 season, Blackwell made her senior debut for New South Wales. In her first match against Queensland, she bowled two expensive overs, conceding 18 runs, and was not required to bat as New South Wales won by six wickets. Batting in the middle-order, often lower than the top-six, Blackwell as only required to bat once in her first four matches, making nine not out in the second match against Queensland and being at the crease when the six-wicket win was registered. The season was interrupted by the national Under-19 competition, and Blackwell was prominent with both bat and ball as New South Wales won all of their six matches. Apart from one duck, Blackwell reached 30 in her remaining five innings to aggregate 207 runs at 41.40. She also took 11 wickets at 9.36. In five of the six matches, she scored at least 30 and took two or more wickets. Blackwell returned to senior duty and again had little to do in the lower order as her state's leading batsmen encountered little difficulty with opposition bowlers. New South Wales defeated Victoria in both round-robin matches and beat them again in the finals series 2–0 to win their sixth consecutive national title. Blackwell was at the crease, unbeaten on 12, as New South Wales reached their target in the second match with four wickets in hand, having not been required to bat in the seven-wicket win in the first final the day before. Blackwell played in eight matches but was only required to bat four times for a total of 33 runs at 33.00 and bowled seven overs without success. At the end of the season, Blackwell was selected for the Australia Youth team that played New Zealand A. She made 76 runs at 19.00 in four matches with a highest score of 32 and took a total of 1/43 from 11 overs. This was followed by a match against the senior New Zealand team. Blackwell took 1/18 and scored 2 in a 21-run defeat. In 2002–03, Blackwell played in her first full season in the WNCL, taking to the field in all 10 of New South Wales' matches. After not being trusted to bat at No. 7 or higher in the first match of the season, which New South Wales won, Blackwell was unbeaten on 17 when they lost to South Australia in the second match of the double-header the next day, having been attacked and conceded 23 runs from two overs in South Australia's innings. Blackwell made her maiden half-century at senior level in the next match, scoring 74 not out to guide her state of a five-wicket win over Victoria. She then made three single-digit scores before rediscovering form in the last two round-robin matches against Western Australia, making 36 and 38. New South Wales won six matches of their eight matches and faced Victoria in the final. Blackwell made only 14 and 17 as New South Wales lost both of the finals, ending their run of six WNCL titles in a row. In the second final, she took her maiden wicket at senior level, but her sporadic bowling was otherwise unsuccessful, conceding 45 runs in 8 overs for the season. Blackwell ended the season with 212 runs at 30.28. International career= International debut  At the end of the season, Blackwell was called into the national team for a quadrangular ODI tournament held in Lincoln in New Zealand. In addition to the hosts and Australia, England and India were also competing. Each team played two matches against the other three teams in the round-robin phase. Blackwell made her debut in Australia's second match, against England, but neither batted nor bowled in a seven-wicket win. In the next match, against India, she scored 27 before being run out and had unexpected success as a bowler, taking 2/8 from six overs in a 59-run win. She was left out of Australia's fourth match, against England, but returned for the last two qualifying matches. She took 2/18 against India before making six not out as the winning runs were scored against the hosts. In the final, she made 21 as Australia scored 214 and defeated the hosts by 109 runs. Blackwell ended her first international series with 54 runs at 27.00 and four wickets at 8.50 at an economy rate of 2.61. The success with the ball is something she has not repeated. In seven years since, she had only taken two more wickets at international level. Alex Blackwell is the 97th woman to play One Day International cricket for Australia. Australia then hosted England in two Tests. Blackwell made her debut at the Gabba in Brisbane. In a low-scoring match, she bowled 11 overs including six maidens, registering figures of 0/9 as the tourists made 124 batting first. Blackwell then came in at 4/40 and made four from 14 balls in her maiden Test innings before being dismissed by Laura Newton, precipitating a collapse of 6/28 as Australia fell to be all out for 78. After England was all out for 92, Blackwell came to the crease with the score at 4/104, with 35 runs still needed for victory. She and Michelle Goszko batted slowly, adding seven runs in nine overs before the latter was out. Blackwell was then joined by Julie Hayes, who scored 18 of the remaining 28 runs required for victory. Blackwell was nine not out and was at the crease when the winning runs were registered with five wickets in hand, having batted for 85 balls in 85 minutes. Despite her circumspect batting, Blackwell was retained for the Second Test at Bankstown Oval in Sydney. Australia batted first and Blackwell came in at 4/90. Soon after, her partners Mel Jones and Hayes fell in quick succession as Australia lost 3/13 to be 6/103. Blackwell then added 21 with Cathryn Fitzpatrick before the former was out for 13; this triggered a collapse of 4/10 as Australia were all out for 134. Blackwell came in at 4/49 with Australia still four runs behind in the second innings. She added 136 in 226 minutes for the fifth wicket with Lisa Sthalekar before being dismissed for 58, having hit six boundaries from 236 balls. In pursuit of a target of 206, England reached 6/133 when time ran out. Blackwell did not bowl in the match. Blackwell played in all of New South Wales' 11 matches in the 2003–04 WNCL, scoring 183 runs at 26.14. In the fourth match of the season against South Australia, she made an unbeaten 70 in a vain attempt to secure victory in the run-chase as her state were bowled out and fell to a ten-run defeat. She was then run out twice for 26 and 23 in the two matches against reigning champions Victoria, as New South Wales tied one match and lost the next by four wickets. It was two of three instances in which Blackwell was run out during the season. New South Wales had a chance for redemption in the finals against Victoria. Blackwell made a duck—her third single-digit score in as many matches—in the first final, which the titleholders won by six wickets. In the next two matches, she was unbeaten on 13 and 16 and at the crease when the winning runs were brought up. New South Wales won the second final by five wickets and scraped home in the deciding match by three wickets to regain the WNCL title. Blackwell's sporadic bowling—26 overs in total—yielded one wicket at 118.00 at an economy rate of 4.37.  Inconsistency at international level  Blackwell retained her position in the national team for the Rose Bowl series, which consisted of three matches each in New Zealand and then Australia. She played in only the third match in New Zealand and did not bat in the seven-wicket win, before being omitted for the first match at home. She was recalled for the second match and made 15 not out in a 40-run win, before her unbeaten 22 guided Australia to a four-wicket win in the final match at Bellerive Oval, as the hosts took out the series 5–1. In the first four matches of the 2004–05 WNCL, Blackwell made 54 and 27 in her only innings as the opposition bowlers failed to penetrate the New South Wales top-order in the other two matches. The defending champions won all four matches before the season was adjourned when the national team travelled to India in December for seven-match bilateral ODI series. Blackwell scored two in a 14-run win in the opening match in Mysore and was dropped for the next match. She was recalled for the third match in Mumbai, run out for a duck in a six-wicket defeat. The tourists won the next two matches to seal the series, but Blackwell was not prominent. She was not required to bat in the third match and was run out for 13 in the next. She made 19 in the sixth ODI and was dropped for the final match of the tour, ending the series with 34 runs at 8.50.  2005 World Cup  Blackwell bowling in the Adelaide Oval nets. Blackwell returned to Australia needing a strong end to the WNCL season to ensure selection for the 2005 World Cup in South Africa. In the four remaining round-robin matches, she made 96 runs in four innings, half of these coming in a five-wicket win over Queensland. New South Wales met Victoria in the finals. Blackwell was not required to bat in a seven-wicket win in the first match before making 13 and 24 as the reigning champions were dismissed for 71 and 109, losing the last two matches by five wickets and 50 runs respectively. Blackwell ended the season with 214 runs at 26.75 and this was enough to secure retention in the national team despite her poor results during the Indian tour. The Australians hosted New Zealand for three Rose Bowl ODIs in the western coastal city of Perth before the teams crossed the Indian Ocean to reach South Africa. Blackwell was not productive in the trans-Tasman matches. She made six and took 1/8 in the first match, and was then run out for 27 in the next game. She was omitted for third match. In the first match of the World Cup, Blackwell was persevered with by the selectors; she did not bat as England made 7/169 before rain ended the match. This was followed by an encounter with New Zealand. Blackwell scored 53 in Australia's 7/174, helping to set up a 32-run win. In the third match against the West Indies, she was run out for a duck in a 79-run win, and was dropped for the 97-run win over the hosts. The group stages ended with two easy victories. Blackwell took 1/8 from two overs, her last international wicket, as Australia dismissed Sri Lanka for 57. Since then she has bowled only 47 balls in senior matches. She was not required to bat as Australia reached their target with eight wickets in hand. The match against Ireland was similar as Australia achieved the target of 67 with all wickets intact. The final pool match against India was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to inclement weather, and Australia met England in the semi-finals. Blackwell scored 10 not out, helping to complete the closing stages of a five-wicket win. In the final against India, she came in towards the end of the innings and made four not out as Australia amassed 4/215. Australia bowled India out for 117 to win by 98 runs. Blackwell ended the tournament with 67 runs at 33.50. In the northern hemisphere summer of 2005, Australia toured England. They started with a stopover in Ireland, and only the second of the three ODIs went ahead; the other two matches were washed out by persistent rain. Blackwell made four not out as Australia made 3/295 and took a 240-run win. Australia played two Tests in England. In the First Test at County Ground in Hove, Sussex, Blackwell batted at No. 5 and played alongside identical twin sister Kate, who was making her Test debut. She struggled in both innings, making five and nine and scoring at a strike rate of 20 or less in both innings. After taking an 82-run lead, Australia set the hosts a target of 306. Blackwell took two catches, her first at Test level, removing Claire Taylor and Jenny Gunn as the hosts ended on 7/172 to salvage a draw. In the Second Test at New Road, Worcester, Blackwell made 20 and 14 as Australia ceded a 158-run first innings lead and eventually lost by six wickets after Blackwell's fall in the second innings left them at 5/46, still 112 runs in arrears. She ended the series with 48 runs at 12.00. Blackwell had mediocre results in the five ODIs, scoring 5, 27, 17 not out, 21 not out and 14 as Australia won 3–2. She ended the series with 84 runs at 28.00. Blackwell then played in Australia's inaugural Twenty20 international at the County Ground, Taunton, only the second international match in the history of the new format. She was not required to bat as Australia won with seven wickets in hand. Having failed to establish herself at international level in 2005, Blackwell started the 2005–06 WNCL season strongly, scoring 61 in the first match of the campaign, a seven-wicket win over Western Australia. The next day she made 130, her maiden WNCL century, setting up a 118-run win against the same team. She then top-scored with 86 in the next match against Queensland, scoring more than half of the runs in a successful run-chase of 3/161. After a run of three scores of 10 or less, Blackwell made 36 and 30 as New South Wales won both matches against Victoria in their last double-header of the season. New South Wales won seven of their eight matches to qualify for the finals against Queensland. In the first match, she scored 50 as New South Wales reached their target of 175 with eight wickets in hand, having earlier taken two catches. She made only three in the next match as New South Wales fell for 154 and lost by three wickets, before scoring 10 as her state made 146 and won by two runs to claim the WNCL. Blackwell ended the season with 411 runs at 38.36. After her strong WNCL season, Blackwell was retained for the series against India in Adelaide at the end of the Australian summer. Opening the batting, she made a 17-ball duck in the one-off Test at the Adelaide Oval, which Australia won by an innings. Blackwell took three catches but made only one in the first ODI. She only made 19 in the next match but was retained for the third and final ODI, top-scoring with an unbeaten 63 in a nine-wicket win. She ended the series with 83 runs at 41.50. Blackwell missed the five-ODI Rose Bowl series at home and the first four WNCL matches of the 2006–07 season due to injury. She returned for the final four round-robin matches and made 42, 17, 74 and 4 as New South Wales won all four matches. She was not effective in the three finals against Victoria, making a duck in a one-wicket win in the first match before scoring one as Victoria levelled the series with an eight-wicket triumph the following day. In the deciding match, she made 20 as New South Wales reached their target of 206 with three wickets in hand. Blackwell ended the season with 158 runs at 22.57. During gaps in New South Wales' schedule, Blackwell travelled across to New Zealand for three weekends of domestic one-dayers for Otago. In her debut for the team, she struck an even 100 in a 162-run win over Northern Districts. She added 79 in a 182-run victory the following day. After making 27 and 31 against Auckland, Blackwell ended her stay with 1 and 77 against Canterbury; Otago lost both matches. She ended with 315 runs at 52.50 in her six-match stint. After the end of the Australian season, Blackwell was selected for the ODI team for a four-nations tournament in Chennai, India. In addition to the hosts and Australia, New Zealand and England were also participating, and each team played each other twice in round-robin phase. In the first match, she made 25 in a six-wicket defeat against New Zealand, who took 41 runs without loss from her four overs en route to a six-wicket win. Blackwell then made 11 in a three-wicket loss to the hosts, leaving Australia in danger of missing the final. She was retained but made a duck and 18 as Australia won their next two matches against England and New Zealand. Blackwell was then omitted from the two remaining round-robin matches and the final, which Australia won by six wickets. She ended the tournament with 54 runs at 13.50. Blackwell was retained in the Rose Bowl series held in tropical Darwin in July 2007, the middle of the southern hemisphere winter. After watching the first two matches from the sidelines, she was called into the team for the third match where she made an unbeaten 44 to see Australia to a six-wicket win. She made 4 and 27 in the two remaining matches, ending the series with 75 runs at 37.50 as Australia prevailed 3–2. Blackwell started the 2007–08 WNCL season strongly, scoring half-centuries in each of the first four matches, all of which were won by New South Wales. She made 75 not out and 52 against South Australia, followed by 60 and 55 against Victoria. The results in each of the two double-headers were identical; New South Wales won the first match by seven wickets before prevailing the next day by 25 runs. Blackwell made 42 in the penultimate round-robin match but otherwise failed to reach double figures in the last four matches. New South Wales qualified in first place for the final against South Australia after winning seven of their eight matches and were awarded the title after the decider was washed out. Blackwell scored 291 runs at 41.57. In her only T20 innings, Blackwell made 37 not out in an eight-wicket win over Western Australia.  Established international cricketer  The domestic competition was followed by two international series against England and New Zealand. Blackwell made 10 as Australia won the T20 international against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground by 21 runs. In the ODIs that followed, drawn 2–2, Blackwell established herself at international level. After scoring 11 in an Australian defeat in the first ODI, she struck 101—her maiden ODI century—the next day at the MCG to set up an 84-run win. After making five as England took a 2–1 series lead, Blackwell made 61 in the final match to help set up a series-levelling 41-run win. She ended the series with 178 runs at 44.50. In the one-off Test at Bowral, Blackwell opened the innings. She made one as Australia batted first and reached 154 in their first innings before conceding a 90-run first innings lead. In the second innings, she made 24 before being bowled for the second time in the matches by pace bowler Isa Guha as the tourists won by six wickets in hand. The Australians then headed to Bert Sutcliffe Oval in Lincoln, New Zealand, for a T20 international and five ODIs. Blackwell made 15 and took two catches as the hosts won the T20 by four wickets. She then made 44 of 5/189 to help secure a 63-run win in the first ODI. In the next two matches, she made seven twice, as the hosts claimed both matches to take the series lead. Australia thus needed to win the remaining two matches. In the fourth match, Blackwell made 61 in an Australian win by six runs. In the final match, she made 91 to help steer Australia to their target of 250 and a series-clinching eight-wicket win. Blackwell ended the series with 211 runs at 42.20. For the whole international season, she scored 389 runs at 43.22 to establish herself at international level. During the 2008 Australian winter, Blackwell travelled to England for a domestic season in the northern hemisphere summer, playing for Berkshire in the county competition, and Rubies in the Super Fours. Blackwell failed to capitalise on her starts for the county, registering scores of 41, 22, 0, 39 and 30 in her five one-day innings for a total of 132 runs at 26.40. It was a similar story in four one-dayers for Rubies, making 58 runs at 14.50 with a best of 26. Blackwell had little impact in the T20s for Rubies, making four and a duck. The 2008–09 Australian season started with a tour by India. Blackwell started with 0/14 from her only over and scored 14 in a six-wicket win in the T20 match. She was prominent as the hosts completed a 5–0 clean sweep of the ODIs. In the first match at Hurstville Oval, she made 75 in an eight-wicket win. After making eight and one not out in the next two matches, Blackwell made 106 not out, setting up a 118-run win in the fourth match at Manuka Oval. She ended the series with 65 run out in the seven-wicket win in the final match. Blackwell aggregated 255 runs at 85.00 for the series. Blackwell had a slow start to the WNCL, failing to pass 22 in her first three innings; she made an unbeaten 50 in an eight-wicket win over Western Australia, and then struck an unbeaten 101 as New South Wales made 1/176 to defeat South Australia by nine wickets. The next day, she made 75 but it was not enough to prevent a 39-run loss against the same team. In the two final round-robin matches against Victoria, she made 70 not out in a nine-wicket win, her fourth consecutive score above 50. The streak ended with 22 in a three-wicket win the next day, and New South Wales hosted the final the following week against the same team. Blackwell made only three as New South Wales made 4/120 to win by six wickets. She ended the season with 372 runs at 62.00.  2009 World Cup and World Twenty20  After the WNCL ended, the Australians headed to New Zealand for the Rose Bowl series. Blackwell made 10 and 9 in the first two matches as Australia went 2–0 down. She then made 59 and 37 in the next two matches as Australia levelled the series; the fifth and final match was washed out. The teams returned to Australia for the World Cup. In two warm-up matches against England and Sri Lanka, Blackwell made 91 not out and 56 retired; Australia won the matches by 25 and 230 runs respectively. In the opening match of the World Cup campaign, Blackwell made four as Australia fell short of their target on the Duckworth-Lewis method. Australia then needed to win their two remaining group matches to reach the Super Six phase. Blackwell made 22 and took three catches as Australia defeated South Africa by 61 runs. She then scored 46 not out in a 47-run win over the West Indies. In the first Super Six match, against India, Blackwell scored 54 as Australia made 7/218, falling 17 runs of their target. She then made seven run out in the win over Pakistan by 107 runs. She made 38 not out in Australia's final Super Six match against England, and although the hosts won by eight wickets, it was not enough for them to place in the top two in the standings and qualify for the final. In the third-place playoff against India, Blackwell made 19 in a three-wicket defeat. Blackwell ended the tournament with 190 runs at 38.00. Blackwell was selected for Australia's team for the inaugural Women's World Twenty20 held in England in 2009. The Australians hosted New Zealand for a three-match series in tropical Darwin at the beginning of June before the World Cup, and Blackwell played in all the matches, making 11 not out and 10 in her two innings. Australia took the series 2–1. After arriving in England, Blackwell made 19 in Australia's 8/123, which New Zealand surpassed with nine wickets in hand. She was not required to bat in an eight- wicket win over the West Indies. Blackwell then 40 not out as Australia defeated South Africa by 24 runs. This put Australia into the semi-final against England. Blackwell made five before England overhauled Australia's score of 5/163 to reach the final, which they won. She ended the tournament with 64 runs at 32.00. Blackwell and the Australians stayed in England for a bilateral series against the hosts, who were the reigning world champions in both ODIs and T20s, after the end of the World Twenty20. In the one-off T20 match, she made 18 as Australia upset England by 34 runs. She played in all five ODIs, and had a torrid time against the English bowling, scoring 7, 3, 0, 0 and 5. She started with a 38-ball 7 in Chelmsford and had a series of slow- scoring single-digit innings, ending the series with a strike rate of 19.73. England won all the ODI matches except the last, which was washed out. Blackwell played in the one-off Test match at County Road in Worcestershire. Blackwell opened and made a fourth-ball duck as Australia fell to 5/28 in their first innings before recovering to make 309. After the tourists had taken a 41-run lead, Blackwell made 68 as Australia made 231 to set the hosts a target of 273. Blackwell and opening partner Nitschke put on 49 before the latter was out for 25. Blackwell then added 81 in 21 overs with Rolton before the latter was dismissed, leaving the score at 2/130. She was then out at 3/150 after hitting six fours and a six from 135 balls, sparking a collapse of 8/81. The match was drawn as the hosts ended at 3/106.  Heavy WNCL scoring and national captaincy  Blackwell hitting a ball for catching practice in the Adelaide Oval nets. After making single-figure scores in consecutive matches, Blackwell struck an unbeaten 121, scoring more than half the runs in an eight-wicket win over the Australian Capital Territory in the third match of the season. After making 37 and 39 in the pair of matches against Victoria, she was prominent in the double-header against Western Australia, scoring 138 to set up a 127-run win, before making an unbeaten 61 the next day in a ten- wicket win. In the final, Blackwell top-scored with 54 as New South Wales batted first and made 9/206. They then dismissed the Victorians for 147 to seal a 59-run win. Blackwell ended the WNCL with 489 runs at 61.12. A T20 domestic tournament was introduced, and Blackwell was prolific in the six qualifying matches, scoring 31 not out, 32, 30, 41, 33 not out and 24 not out. New South Wales won all of the round-robin matches except the fixture against Victoria. The two teams met again in the final, and Blackwell failed for the only time in the competition, making a duck as New South Wales fell for 75 in pursuit of 128 for victory. After the series, Blackwell led Australia in the Rose Bowl series against New Zealand due to an injury to incumbent captain Jodie Fields. The campaign started with five ODIs in Australia. In the first two matches, held at the Adelaide Oval, she made 51 and 34 as the hosts won by 115 runs and six wickets respectively. The last three matches of the series were held at the Junction Oval in Melbourne. In the third ODI, Blackwell top- scored with 92 as Australia took a 102-run win and sealed the series. She was not required to bat in the ten-wicket win in fourth match and made one as Australia took a 5–0 whitewash with a comfortable 103-run win in the final ODI. Blackwell ended her first series as captain with 178 runs at 44.50. The ODIs were followed by three T20s at Bellerive Oval in Hobart and two more in New Zealand at the start of the second phase of the bilateral contests. Blackwell played in every match and Australia was whitewashed. The three matches in Hobart were closely fought; Blackwell made 11, top-scored with 40, and added 26 as New Zealand won by two, one and seven runs respectively. The hosts won the last two matches in New Zealand convincingly by 59 and 17 runs; Blackwell made 9 and 8 as the Australians were bowled out for 73 and 98. She ended the series with 94 runs at 18.80. Australia then swept New Zealand 3–0 in the ODIs in New Zealand. In the first match, Blackwell made five as Australia came closest to defeat in the ODIs, scraping home by two wickets. She made 8 and 44 in last two matches in Invercargill to complete the clean sweep. In all the ODIs she made 235 runs at 33.57. Blackwell had thus led Australia to eight consecutive ODI wins over New Zealand.  2010 World Twenty20 triumph  Blackwell led the team at the 2010 World Twenty20 in the West Indies and captained in every match after Fields was again forced out by injury. She batted at No. 4 in all but one match. In the first warm-up match against New Zealand, she opened the bowling with her occasional medium pace, and took 1/29 from her four overs, dismissing the opposing captain and opener Aimee Watkins. She then came in at No. 4 and top-scored with 44 from as many balls as Australia lost by 18 runs. In the last warm-up match, she made 35 not out from 21 balls and featured in a 55-run partnership from 40 balls with Jess Cameron. She did not bowl herself as the Australians defeated Pakistan by 82 runs. Australia were grouped with defending champions England, South Africa and the West Indies. In the first match against England, Blackwell ran out Holly Colvin to end the innings with 15 balls unused. In pursuit of 105 for victory, Australia were 2/10 when Blackwell came to the crease. She made 7 from 14 balls in a partnership of 34 from 33 balls—Australia's largest of the match—with Leah Poulton. However, their dismissals in consecutive overs started a collapse of 5/19 from 34 balls. However, Australia recovered, and Rene Farrell was run out going for the winning run from the third last ball available, leaving the scores tied. A Super Over eventuated, and both teams ended with 2/6 after both suffered run outs in an attempt to secure a seventh run on the final ball. Australia was awarded the match because they had hit more sixes in the match—Jess Cameron scored the solitary six. In the next match against South Africa, Blackwell made 9 from 14 balls, the only Australian in the first seven batting positions to score at less than a strike rate of 133.33. A sudden collapse saw Australia lose 6/16 including the last four wickets for four runs to be all out for 155 with three balls unused. They eventually completed a 22-run win. In the final group match, Blackwell top- scored with 28 from 26 balls, and batted through most of the innings, although she only faced a small minority of the 74 balls delivered during her time at the crease, as Australia finished on 7/133. She had put on 22 runs in 16 balls with Sthalekar. She caught Shanel Daley from the bowling of Sthalekar as Australia won by nine runs to finish the group stage unbeaten at the top of their quartet. Australia went on to face India in the semi-final. Blackwell ran out opposing captain and all rounder Jhulan Goswami, one of three wickets to fall in the 17th over bowled by Ellyse Perry. Australia were set a target of 120, and Blackwell promoted herself to No. 3 after opener Elyse Villani fell for a duck in the first over. Blackwell and Nitschke counter-attacked, and scored the next 50 runs in 40 balls, before Nitschke was out to end a stand of 74 runs in 60 balls. Blackwell reached her fifty in 37 balls and was eventually out for 61 from 49 balls with 17 runs still required from 28 balls for victory. The Australians reached their target with seven wickets and seven balls to spare, and Blackwell was named the player of the match. In the final against New Zealand, Blackwell elected to bat, but New Zealand started more effectively. Nitschke and Villani were out in consecutive overs and Blackwell came in at 2/14 in the fourth over. After being unable to score from her first six balls, Blackwell was then dismissed for a duck from her seventh delivery, cutting Nicola Browne into the hands of Sophie Devine in the gully, leaving the score at 3/20 in the sixth over. The Australians eventually reached 8/106 from their 20 overs. New Zealand started their chase solidly, but in the fourth over, the tide began to turn when but their captain Aimee Watkins pulled Clea Smith and the catch was taken by a leaping Blackwell at midwicket. In the next over Blackwell ran out Sara McGlashan for 1, after the latter had been in a mix-up with Suzie Bates, leaving New Zealand at 2/19. Later, Blackwell caught Rachel Priest from Nitschke to leave New Zealand at 5/36 after 11 overs, leaving them with 71 runs to score from the last 54 balls. Australia went on to win by three runs. 2015 Ashes In June 2015, she was named as one of Australia's touring party for the 2015 Women's Ashes in England. 2017–18 season 2017–18 Women's Ashes Test at North Sydney Oval. The wicket-keeper is Sarah Taylor. Blackwell was in Australia's squad for the Women's Ashes. In the first WODI of the series she came to the crease when Australia were 4/87, still requiring 144 runs for victory. She batted for the rest of the innings, getting to a total of 67 and steering Australia to victory in the final over of the match. In the third WODI of the series, she played in her 250th international match for Australia Women.

It draws an international audience for readings, panel discussions, and workshops. History The Seminar was founded in 1983 by David Kaufelt and his wife Lynn Kaufelt, as a program operated by the Council for Florida Libraries. The inaugural event, known as the Key West Literary Tour and Seminar, consisted of readings, panel discussions, literary walking tours, and cocktail parties. This basic format remains unchanged. The current Executive Director is poet, writer and publisher Arlo Haskell. In its early years, the Seminar focused on the literary history of Key West, a small subtropical town which has been home to Ernest Hemingway, Elizabeth Bishop, Wallace Stevens, Robert Frost, and Tennessee Williams, among others. Subsequent Seminars have been devoted to broader genres or literary themes. In 1987, the Seminar incorporated as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt corporation, run by a board of directors, with Lynn Kaufelt named as the executive director. In 1988, Monica Haskell became executive director. She was succeeded by Miles Frieden in 1995. Many well-known authors have served on the Seminar's board of directors, including Judy Blume, Harry Mathews, James Gleick, William Wright, Richard Wilbur, and John Malcolm Brinnin. An honorary board of directors has included popular singer Jimmy Buffett, former First Lady Barbara Bush, and writers Annie Dillard, Robert Stone, Alison Lurie, and Joy Williams. The Seminar was formerly held at the Tennessee Williams Fine Arts Center at Florida Keys Community College on Stock Island. Since 1993, events have been held on Duval Street at the San Carlos Institute, a historic building whose construction was partly funded by the Republic of Cuba during the 1920s. The seminar begins each year with the John Hersey Memorial Address and features a series of receptions at notable Key West locations. Through their website, the Seminar offers audio recordings of past events, biographies of past and forthcoming speakers, and information about Key West's literary history.

He is most notable for his self-made fortune in the early 20th century. He moved to the United States in 1897 and within twenty years he had a herd of over 100,000 sheep in southern Idaho. His motivation and ambition was seen through his many different roles as a local Basque \\"king\\" or \\"father\\" in Mountain Home, Idaho, serving as the Vice-President of the Mountain Home Bank and the owner of the finest hotel in the western United States at that time, The Bengoechea Hotel. Life in Basque Country Jose was born in 1860 in the house of Zaracondegui in Bedarona, Spain. Life in Bedarona was hard; after the loss of two wars (Carlist wars) in Basque Country, Bedarona became very impoverished in the 1880s, but spirits were lifted by the news of the success of relatives and townsfolk in the territories of the western United States. The Bengoechea family had lived in Olabe since 1796, but the wars ruined them. The only option for Jose was to move to the New World and start a new life. Early years in the U.S. Wedding picture of Jose Jose first moved to California then to Palo Alto, Nevada to work for the Altube family. He then moved to Bruneau, Idaho to start his own business. He was what we would call a modern day entrepreneur. He called on his brother Gabriel Bengoechea to come work on his farm and later called on Meliton Bengoechea; this was the beginning of his successful life as an American immigrant. The Bengoechea sheep company broke down into the Bill Smith Sheep Company and the Wood Creek Sheep Company after Jose's death. Life in the U.S. Jose was a millionaire, but illiterate. In 1900 he was the proprietor of an automobile when, in the United States, there had only been 14,000 registered cars. He did not know how to drive so he had to contract a driver. When people asked him what car was the best one, he always responded the same: \\"a new one\\".Richard Urquidi, \\"History of the Mountain Home Basques\\", Masters' s thesis, Boise State University, 1980 He married in 1915 to Margarita Nachiondo Achabal, a Basque from Ispaster who had arrived at the country in 1912 and resided of Ogden, Utah. Margarita was 34 years younger and, in 1916, the first of his three children, Eva (1916–2007) was born. Soon thereafter Adam (1917–1984) and Joseph (1920–1964) were born. They lived in a beautiful mansion near the hotel. Death Jose died on November 2, 1921, after which his family moved to Ogden, Utah. The hotel was subsequently owned by a corporation, run by Victor Yturri married with Cristina Plaza. The Yturris ran the hotel until about 1932. After his death most of the Bengoechea fortune was lost. Due to the Depression, his land and sheep were all worth nothing. The rest of the family moved to Ogden, Utah to start a new life.

Its limits are the Cap de la Nau headland in the south, while the northern limit is diffuse: for some it is the Cape of Vinaròs; and for others it is the Ebre Delta. When the Cape of Vinaròs is used the Gulf of Valencia's coast is entirely within the Valencian Community. When the Ebre Delta is used its northern coast is within southern Catalonia. The tiny Columbretes islets are located in the gulf. The Gulf of Valencia is bisected by the Prime Meridian. Geography The coast along the Gulf of Valencia is typically a sandy plain with beaches.
