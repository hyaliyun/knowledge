Career Puntillita was a member of the Hermanos Licea in the 1940s in Camag√ºey. He began singing with the Orquesta Escorcia, and played percussion in the Orquesta Tentaci√≥n. In 1945 he went to Havana to sing in trumpeter Julio Cueva's band. He got his nickname from Son de la puntillita, which he sang with this band. He went on to achieve huge popularity in the 1950s as a soloist on Radio Cadena Habana. In Mexico City he performed at El Patio, singing with Celia Cruz and Beny Mor√©. With the conjunto Gloria Matancera he played at the Cabaret Antillano. In the 1990s, Juan de Marcos Gonz√°lez approached Puntillita to join the Afro-Cuban All Stars, which featured many musicians from Havana's pre-revolutionary era. He toured Colombia and Europe with the group. Puntillita was also later asked by Gonzalez to appear with Ry Cooder in the Buena Vista Social Club.

Many different kinds of vessels are used in commercial, artisanal and recreational fishing. The total number of fishing vessels in the world in 2016 was estimated to be about 4.6 million, unchanged from 2014. The fleet in Asia was the largest, consisting of 3.5 million vessels, accounting for 75 percent of the global fleet. In Africa and North America the estimated number of vessels declined from 2014 by just over 30,000 and by nearly 5,000, respectively. For Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean and Oceania the numbers all increased, largely as a result of improvements in estimation procedures.FAO 2007 It is difficult to estimate the number of recreational fishing boats. They range in size from small dinghies to large charter cruisers, and unlike commercial fishing vessels, are often not dedicated just to fishing. Prior to the 1950s there was little standardisation of fishing boats. Designs could vary between ports and boatyards. Traditionally boats were built of wood, but wood is not often used now because of higher maintenance costs and lower durability. Fibreglass is used increasingly in smaller fishing vessels up to 25 metres (100 tons), while steel is usually used on vessels above 25 metres. __TOC__  History =Traditional fishing boats Viking boat showing clinker planking. Early fishing vessels included rafts, dugout canoes, and boats constructed from a frame covered with hide or tree bark, along the lines of a coracle.McGrail 2001, page 431 The oldest boats found by archaeological excavation are dugout canoes dating back to the Neolithic Period around 7,000-9,000 years ago. These canoes were often cut from coniferous tree logs, using simple stone tools. A 7000-year-old seagoing boat made from reeds and tar has been found in Kuwait. These early vessels had limited capability; they could float and move on water, but were not suitable for use any great distance from the shoreline. They were used mainly for fishing and hunting. The development of fishing boats took place in parallel with the development of boats for trade and war. Early navigators began to use animal skins or woven fabrics for sails. Affixed to a pole set upright in the boat, these sails gave early boats more range, allowing voyages of exploration. Around 4000 B.C., Egyptians were building long narrow boats powered by many oarsmen. Over the next 1,000 years, they made a series of remarkable advances in boat design. They developed cotton-made sails to help their boats go faster with less work. Then they built boats large enough to cross the oceans. These boats had sails and oarsmen, and were used for travel and trade. By 3000 BC, the Egyptians knew how to assemble planks of wood into a ship hull. They used woven straps to lash planks together, and reeds or grass stuffed between the planks to seal the seams. An example of their skill is the Khufu ship, a vessel in length entombed at the foot of the Great Pyramid of Giza around 2,500 BC and found intact in 1954. At about the same time, the Scandinavians were also building innovative boats. People living near Kongens Lyngby in Denmark, came up with the idea of segregated hull compartments, which allowed the size of boats to gradually be increased. A crew of some two dozen paddled the wooden Hjortspring boat across the Baltic Sea long before the rise of the Roman Empire. Scandinavians continued to develop better ships, incorporating iron and other metal into the design and developing oars for propulsion. By 1000 A.D. the Norsemen were pre-eminent on the oceans. They were skilled seamen and boat builders, with clinker-built boat designs that varied according to the type of boat. Trading boats, such as the knarrs, were wide to allow large cargo storage. Raiding boats, such as the longship, were long and narrow and very fast. The vessels they used for fishing were scaled down versions of their cargo boats. The Scandinavian innovations influenced fishing boat design long after the Viking period came to an end. For example, yoles from the Orkney Island of Stroma were built in the same way as the Norse boats. Early modern designs Herring Buss taking aboard its drift net (G. Groenewegen). In the 15th century, the Dutch developed a type of seagoing herring drifter that became a blueprint for European fishing boats. This was the Herring Buss, used by Dutch herring fishermen until the early 19th centuries. The ship type buss has a long history. It was known around 1000 AD in Scandinavia as a b«òza, a robust variant of the Viking longship. The first herring buss was probably built in Hoorn around 1415. The ship was about 20 metres long and displaced between 60 and 100 tons. It was a massive round-bilged keel ship with a bluff bow and stern, the latter relatively high, and with a gallery. The busses used long drifting gill nets to catch the herring. The nets would be retrieved at night and the crews of eighteen to thirty menDe Vries & Woude (1977), pages 244‚Äì245 would set to gibbing, salting and barrelling the catch on the broad deck. dogger viewed from before the port beam. c. 1675 by Willem van de Velde the Younger. During the 17th century, the British developed the dogger, an early type of sailing trawler or longliner, which commonly operated in the North Sea.Oxford Companion to Ships and the Sea, p. 256 Doggers were slow but sturdy, capable of fishing in the rough conditions of the North Sea.Fagan 2008 Like the herring buss, they were wide-beamed and bluff-bowed, but considerably smaller, about 15 metres long, a maximum beam of 4.5 metres, a draught of 1.5 metres, and displacing about 13 tonnes. They could carry a tonne of bait, three tonnes of salt, half a tonne each of food and firewood for the crew, and return with six tonnes of fish. Decked areas forward and aft probably provided accommodation, storage and a cooking area. An anchor would have allowed extended periods fishing in the same spot, in waters up to 18 metres deep. The dogger would also have carried a small open boat for maintaining lines and rowing ashore. A precursor to the dory type was the early French bateau type, a flat bottom boat with straight sides used as early as 1671 on the Saint Lawrence River.Gardner 1987, page 18 The common coastal boat of the time was the wherry and the merging of the wherry design with the simplified flat bottom of the bateau resulted in the birth of the dory. England, France, Italy, and Belgium have small boats from medieval periods that could reasonably be construed as predecessors of the Dory.Gardner 1987, page 15 Dories appeared in New England fishing towns sometime after the early 18th century.Chapelle, page 85 They were small, shallow-draft boats, usually about five to seven metres (15 to 22 feet) long. Lightweight and versatile, with high sides, a flat bottom and sharp bows, they were easy and cheap to build. The Banks dories appeared in the 1830s. They were designed to be carried on mother ships and used for fishing cod at the Grand Banks. Adapted almost directly from the low freeboard, French river bateaus, with their straight sides and removable thwarts, bank dories could be nested inside each other and stored on the decks of fishing schooners, such as the Gazela Primeiro, for their trip to the Grand Banks fishing grounds. Modern fishing trawler A Brixham trawler by William Adolphus Knell. The painting is now in the National Maritime Museum. The British dogger was an early type of sailing trawler from the 17th century, but the modern fishing trawler was developed in the 19th century, at the English fishing port of Brixham. By the early 19th century, the fishermen at Brixham needed to expand their fishing area further than ever before due to the ongoing depletion of stocks that was occurring in the overfished waters of South Devon. The Brixham trawler that evolved there was of a sleek build and had a tall gaff rig, which gave the vessel sufficient speed to make long distance trips out to the fishing grounds in the ocean. They were also sufficiently robust to be able to tow large trawls in deep water. The great trawling fleet that built up at Brixham, earned the village the title of 'Mother of Deep-Sea Fisheries'. This revolutionary design made large scale trawling in the ocean possible for the first time, resulting in a massive migration of fishermen from the ports in the South of England, to villages further north, such as Scarborough, Hull, Grimsby, Harwich and Yarmouth, that were points of access to the large fishing grounds in the Atlantic Ocean. The small village of Grimsby grew to become the largest fishing port in the world by the mid 19th century.Grimsby heyday of the 'three-day millionaire' BBC, 15 November 2012 With the tremendous expansion in the fishing industry, the Grimsby Dock Company was formed in 1846. The dock covered and was formally opened by Queen Victoria in 1854 as the first modern fishing port. The facilities incorporated many innovations of the time - the dock gates and cranes were operated by hydraulic power, and the Grimsby Dock Tower was built to provide a head of water with sufficient pressure by William Armstrong. The elegant Brixham trawler spread across the world, influencing fishing fleets everywhere. Their distinctive sails inspired the song Red Sails in the Sunset, written aboard a Brixham sailing trawler called the Torbay Lass. By the end of the 19th century, there were over 3,000 fishing trawlers in commission in Britain, with almost 1,000 at Grimsby. These trawlers were sold to fishermen around Europe, including from the Netherlands and Scandinavia. Twelve trawlers went on to form the nucleus of the German fishing fleet. Although fishing vessel designed increasingly began to converge around the world, local conditions still often led the development of different types of fishing boats. The Lancashire nobby was used down the north west coast of England as a shrimp trawler from 1840 until World War II. The Manx nobby was used around the Isle of Man as a herring drifter. The fifie was also used as a herring drifter along the east coast of Scotland from the 1850s until well into the 20th century. =Advent of steam power= The earliest steam powered fishing boats first appeared in the 1870s and used the trawl system of fishing as well as lines and drift nets. These were large boats, usually in length with a beam of around . They weighed 40-50 tons and travelled at . The earliest purpose built fishing vessels were designed and made by David Allan in Leith in March 1875, when he converted a drifter to steam power. In 1877, he built the first screw propelled steam trawler in the world. This vessel was Pioneer LH854. She was of wooden construction with two masts and carried a gaff rigged main and mizen using booms, and a single foresail. Pioneer is mentioned in The Shetland Times of 4 May 1877. In 1878 he completed Forward and Onward, steam-powered trawlers for sale. Allan built a total of ten boats at Leith between 1877 and 1881. Twenty-one boats were completed at Granton, his last vessel being Degrave in 1886. Most of these were sold to foreign owners in France, Belgium, Spain and the West Indies. Seine Net Trawler, Hopeman 1958. The first steam boats were made of wood, but steel hulls were soon introduced and were divided into watertight compartments. They were well designed for the crew with a large building that contained the wheelhouse and the deckhouse. The boats built in the 20th century only had a mizzen sail, which was used to help steady the boat when its nets were out. The main function of the mast was now as a crane for lifting the catch ashore. It also had a steam capstan on the foredeck near the mast for hauling nets. The boats had narrow, high funnels so that the steam and thick coal smoke was released high above the deck and away from the fishermen. These funnels were nicknamed woodbines because they looked like the popular brand of cigarette. These boats had a crew of twelve made up of a skipper, driver, fireman (to look after the boiler) and nine deck hands. Steam fishing boats had many advantages. They were usually about than the sailing vessels so they could carry more nets and catch more fish. This was important, as the market was growing quickly at the beginning of the 20th century. They could travel faster and further and with greater freedom from weather, wind and tide. Because less time was spent travelling to and from the fishing grounds, more time could be spent fishing. The steam boats also gained the highest prices for their fish, as they could return quickly to harbour with their fresh catch. The main disadvantage of the steam boats, though, was their high operating costs. Their engines were mechanically inefficient and took up much space, while fuel and fitting out costs were very high. Before the First World War, building costs were between 3,000 and ¬£4,000, at least three times the cost of the sail boats. To cover these high costs, they needed to fish for longer seasons. The higher expenses meant that more steam drifters were company-owned or jointly owned. As the herring fishing industry declined, steam boats became too expensive. Steam trawlers were introduced at Grimsby and Hull in the 1880s. In 1890 it was estimated that there were 20,000 men on the North Sea. The steam drifter was not used in the herring fishery until 1897. The last sailing fishing trawler was built in 1925 in Grimsby. =Further development= Armed trawler off Iceland. Trawler designs adapted as the way they were powered changed from sail to coal-fired steam by World War I to diesel and turbines by the end of World War II. The first trawlers fished over the side, rather than over the stern. In 1947, the company Christian Salvesen, based in Leith, Scotland, refitted a surplus Algerine-class minesweeper (HMS Felicity) with refrigeration equipment and a factory ship stern ramp, to produce the first combined freezer/stern trawler in 1947. The first purpose built stern trawler was Fairtry built in 1953 at Aberdeen. The ship was much larger than any other trawlers then in operation and inaugurated the era of the 'super trawler'. As the ship pulled its nets over the stern, it could lift out a much greater haul of up to 60 tons. Lord Nelson followed in 1961, installed with vertical plate freezers that had been researched and built at the Torry Research Station. These ships served as a basis for the expansion of 'super trawlers' around the world in the following decades. In recent decades, commercial fishing vessels have been increasingly equipped with electronic aids, such as radio navigation aids and fish finders. During the Cold War, some countries fitted fishing trawlers with additional electronic gear so they could be used as spy ships to monitor the activities of other countries.  Global trends  Globally, the number of engine-powered vessels was estimated to be 2.8 million in 2016, this represents 61 percent of all fishing vessels, down from 64 percent in 2014, as the number of non-motorized vessels increased, probably because of improved estimations. In 2016, about 86 percent of the motorized fishing vessels in the world were in the length overall (LOA) class of less than 12 m, the vast majority of which were undecked, and those small vessels dominated in all regions. Conversely, the largest vessels, classified as those with LOA greater than 24 m made up about 2 percent of the total fleet. About 1.3 million of these are decked vessels with enclosed areas. Nearly all of these decked vessels are mechanised, and 40,000 of them are over 100 tons. At the other extreme, two-thirds (1.8 million) of the undecked boats are traditional craft of various types, powered only by sail and oars. These boats are used by artisan fishers.  Commercial vessels  The German factory ship Kiel NC 105 The 200-mile fishing limit has changed fishing patterns and, in recent times, fishing boats are becoming more specialised and standardised. In the United States and Canada more use is made of large factory trawlers, while the huge blue water fleets operated by Japan and the Soviet-bloc countries have contracted. In western Europe, fishing vessel design is focused on compact boats with high catching power. Commercial fishing is a high risk industry, and countries are introducing regulations governing the construction and operation of fishing vessels. The International Maritime Organization, convened in 1959 by the United Nations, is responsible for devising measures aimed at the prevention of accidents, including standards for ship design, construction, equipment, operation and manning. According to the FAO, in 2004 the world's fishing fleet consisted of 4 million vessels. Of these, 1.3 million were decked vessels with enclosed areas. The rest were open vessels, of which two-thirds were traditional craft propelled by sails and oars. By contrast, nearly all decked vessels were mechanized. Of the decked vessels, 86 percent are found in Asia, 7.8 percent in Europe, 3.8 percent in North and Central America, 1.3 percent in Africa, 0.6 percent in South America and 0.4 percent in Oceania. Most commercial fishing boats are small, usually less than but up to for a large purse seiner or factory ship. Commercial fishing vessels can be classified by architecture, the type of fish they catch, the fishing method used, or geographical origin. The following classification follows the FAO, who classify commercial fishing vessels by the gear they use. Fishing gear File:Irish fishing boat.jpgDrum winches mounted at the stern of an Irish trawler Image:Puretic Block.jpgPuretic power block Trawlers right A trawler is a fishing vessel designed to use trawl nets in order to catch large volumes of fish. * Outrigger trawlers ‚Äì use outriggers to tow the trawl. These are commonly used to catch shrimp. One or two otter trawls can be towed from each side. Beam trawlers, employed in the North sea for catching flatfish, are another form of outrigger trawler. Medium-sized and high powered vessels, these tow a beam trawl on each side at speeds up to 8 knots. ** Beam trawlers ‚Äì use sturdy outrigger booms for towing a beam trawl, one warp on each side. Double-rig beam trawlers can tow a separate trawl on each side of the trawler. Beam trawling is used in the flatfish and shrimp fisheries in the North Sea. They are medium-sized and high powered vessels, towing gear at speeds up to 8 knots. To avoid the boat capsizing if the trawl snags on the sea floor, winch brakes can be installed, along with safety release systems in the boom stays. The engine power of bottom trawlers is also restricted to 2000 HP (1472 KW) for further safety. * Otter trawlers ‚Äì deploy one or more parallel trawls kept apart horizontally using otter boards. These trawls can be towed in midwater or along the bottom. * Pair trawlers ‚Äì are trawlers which operate together towing a single trawl. They keep the trawl open horizontally by keeping their distance when towing. Otter boards are not used. Pair trawlers operate both midwater and bottom trawls. * Side trawlers ‚Äì have the trawl set over the side with the trawl warps passing through blocks which hang from two gallows, one forward and one aft. Until the late sixties, side trawlers were the most familiar vessel in the North Atlantic deep sea fisheries. They evolved over a longer period than other trawler types, but are now being replaced by stern trawlers. * Stern trawlers ‚Äì have trawls which are deployed and retrieved from the stern. Larger stern trawlers often have a ramp, though pelagic and small stern trawlers are often designed without a ramp. Stern trawlers are designed to operate in most weather conditions. They can work alone when midwater or bottom trawling, or two can work together as pair trawlers. * Freezer trawlers ‚Äì The majority of trawlers operating on high sea waters are freezer trawlers. They have facilities for preserving fish by freezing, allowing them to stay at sea for extended periods of time. They are medium to large size trawlers, with the same general arrangement as stern or side trawlers. * Wet fish trawlers ‚Äì are trawlers where the fish is kept in the hold in a fresh/wet condition. They must operate in areas not far distant from their landing place, and the fishing time of such vessels is limited. Seiners A seiner fishing for salmon off the coast of Raspberry Island, Alaska. Seiners use surrounding and seine nets. This is a large group ranging from open boats as small as in length to ocean-going vessels. There are also specialised gears that can target demersal species. * Purse seiners are very effective at targeting aggregating pelagic species near the surface. The seiner circles the shoal with a deep curtain of netting, possibly using bow thrusters for better manoeuvrability. Then the bottom of the net is pursed (closed) underneath the fish shoal by hauling a wire running from the vessel through rings along the bottom of the net and then back to the vessel. The most important part of the fishing operation is searching for the fish shoals and assessing their size and direction of movement. Sophisticated electronics, such as echosounders, sonar, and track plotters, may be used are used to search for and track schools; assessing their size and movement and keeping in touch with the school while it is surrounded with the seine net. Crows nests may be built on the masts for further visual support. Large vessels can have observation towers and helicopter landing decks. Helicopters and spotter planes are used for detecting fish schools. The main types of purse seiners are the American seiners, the European seiners and the Drum seiners. ** American seiners have their bridge and accommodation placed forward with the working deck aft. American seiners are most common on both coasts of North America and in other areas of Oceania. The net is stowed at the stern and is set over the stern. The power block is usually attached to a boom from a mast located behind the superstructure. American seiners use Triplerollers. A purse line winch is located amidships near the hauling station, near the side where the rings are taken on board. ** European seiners have their bridge and accommodation located more to the after part of the vessel with the working deck amidships. European seiners are most common in waters fished by European nations. The net is stowed in a net bin at the stern, and is set over the stern from this position. The pursing winch is normally positioned at the forward part of the working deck. ** Drum seiners have the same layout as American seiners except a drum is mounted on the stern and used instead of the power block. They are mainly used in Canada and USA. ** Tuna purse seiners are large purse seiners, normally over 45 metres, equipped to handle large and heavy purse seines for tuna. They have the same general arrangement as the American seiner, with the bridge and accommodation placed forward. A crows nest or tuna tower is positioned at the top of the mast, outfitted with the control and manoeuvre devices. A very heavy boom which carries the power block is fitted at the mast. They often carry a helicopter to search for tuna schools. On the deck are three drum purse seine winches and a power block, with other specific winches to handle the heavy boom and net. They are usually equipped with a skiff. * Seine netters - the basic types of seine netters are the anchor seiners and Scottish seiner in northern Europe and the Asian seiners in Asia. ** Anchor seiners have the wheelhouse and accommodation aft and the working deck amidships, thus resembling side trawlers. The seine net is stored and shot from the stern, and they may carry a power block. Anchor seiners have the coiler and winch mounted transversally amidships. ** Scottish seiners are basically configured the same as anchor seiners. The only difference is that, whereas the anchor seiner has the coiler and winch mounted transversally amidships, the Scottish seiner has them mounted transversally in the forward part of the vessel. ** Asian seiners ‚Äì In Asia, the seine netter usually has the wheelhouse forward and the working deck aft, in the manner of a stern trawler. However, in regions where the fishing effort is a labour- intensive, low-technology approach, they are often undecked and may be powered by outboards motors, or even by sail. File:Drawing of a purse seiner.gifPurse seiner File:Drawing of a large purse seiner.gifLarge purse seiner File:Albatun Dod.jpgSpanish tuna purse seiner, Albatun Dos, near Victoria, Seychelles Line vessels Line vessels ‚Äì * Longliners ‚Äì use one or more long heavy fishing lines with a series of hundreds or even thousands of baited hooks hanging from the main line by means of branch lines called \\"snoods\\". Hand operated longlining can be operated from boats of any size. The number of hooks and lines handled depends on the size of vessel, the number of crew, and the level of mechanisation. Large purpose built longliners can be designed for single species fisheries such as tuna. On such larger vessels the bridge is usually placed aft, and the gear is hauled from the bow or from the side with mechanical or hydraulic line haulers. The lines are set over the stern. Automatic or semi-automatic systems are used to bait hooks and shoot and haul lines. These systems include rail rollers, line haulers, hook separators, dehookers and hook cleaners, and storage racks or drums. To avoid incidental catches of seabirds, an outboard setting funnel is used to guide the line from the setting position on the stern down to a depth of one or two metres. Small scale longliners handle the gear by hand. The line is stored into baskets or tubs, perhaps using a hand cranked line drum. ** Bottom longliners ‚Äì ** Midwater longliners ‚Äì are usually medium-sized vessels which operate worldwide, purpose built to catch large pelagics. The line hauler is usually forward starboard, where the fish are hauled through a gate in the rail. The lines are set from the stern where a baiting table and chute are located. These boats need adequate speed to reach distant fishing grounds, enough endurance for continued fishing, adequate freezing storage, suitable mechanisms for shooting and hauling longlines quickly, and proper storage for fishing gears and accessories. ** Freezer longliners ‚Äì are outfitted with freezing equipment. The holds are insulated and refrigerated. Freezer longliners are medium to large with the same general characteristics of other longliners. Most longliners operating on the high seas are freezer longliners. ** Factory longliners ‚Äì are generally equipped with processing plant, including mechanical gutting and filleting equipment accompanied by freezing facilities, as well as fish oil, fish meal and sometimes canning plants. These vessels have a large buffer capacity. Thus, caught fish can be stored in refrigerated sea water tanks and piks in the catch can also be used. Freezer longliners are large ships, working the high seas with the same general characteristics of other large longliners. ** Wet-fish longliners ‚Äì keep the caught fish in the hold in the fresh/wet condition. The fish is stored in boxes and covered with ice, or stored with ice in the fish hold. The fishing time of such vessels is limited, so they operate close to the landing place. * Pole and line vessels ‚Äì are used mainly to catch tuna and skipjack. The fishers stand at the railing or on special platforms and fish with poles and lines. The lines have hooks which are baited, preferably with live bait. Caught tuna are swung on board, by two to three fishermen if the tuna is big, or with an automated swinging mechanism. The tuna usually release themselves from the barbless hook when they hit the deck. Tanks with live bait are placed round the decks, and water spray systems are used to attract the fish. The vessels are 15 to 45 metres o/a. On smaller vessels fishers fish from the main deck right around the boat. With larger vessels, there are two different deck styles: the American style and the Japanese style. ** American style ‚Äì fishers stand on platforms arranged over the side abaft amidships and around the stern. The vessel moves ahead during fishing operation. ** Japanese style ‚Äì fishers stand at the rail in the forepart of the vessel. The vessel drifts during fishing operations. right * Trollers ‚Äì catch fish by towing astern one of more trolling lines. A trolling line is a fishing line with natural or artificial baited hooks trailed by a vessel near the surface or at a certain depth. Several lines can be towed at the same time using outriggers to keep the lines apart. The lines can be hauled in manually or by small winches. A length of rubber is often included in each line as a shock absorber. The trolling line is towed at a speed depending on the target species, from 2.3 knots up to at least 7 knots. Trollers range from small open boats to large refrigerated vessels 30 metres long. In many tropical artisanal fisheries, trolling is done with sailing canoes with outriggers for stability. With properly designed vessels, trolling is an economical and efficient way of catching tuna, mackerel and other pelagic fish swimming close to the surface. Purpose built trollers are usually equipped with two or four trolling booms raised and lowered by topping lifts, held in position by adjustable stays. Electrically powered or hydraulic reels can be used to haul in the lines. * Jiggers ‚Äì there are two types of jiggers: specialised squid jiggers which work mostly in the southern hemisphere and smaller vessels using jigging techniques in the northern hemisphere mainly for catching cod. ** Squid jiggers ‚Äì have single or double drum jigger winches lined along the rails around the vessel. Strong lamps, up to 5000 W each, are used to attract the squid. These are arranged 50‚Äì60 centimetres apart, either as one row in the centre of the vessel, or two rows, one on each side. As the squid are caught they are transferred by chutes to the processing plant of the vessel. The jigging motion can be produced mechanically by the shape of the drum or electronically by adjustment to the winch motor. Squid jiggers are often used during the day as midwater trawlers and during the night as jiggers. ** Cod jiggers ‚Äì use single jigger machines and do not use lights to attract the fish. The fish are attracted by the jigging motion and artificial bait. Other vessels * Dredgers ‚Äì use a dredge for collecting molluscs from the seafloor. There are three types of dredges: (a) The dredge can be dragged along the seabed, scooping the shellfish from the ground. These dredges are towed in a manner similar to beam trawlers, and large dredgers can work three or more dredges on each side. (b) Heavy mechanical dredging units are operated by special gallows from the bow of the vessel. (c) The dredger employs a hydraulic dredge which uses a powerful water pump to operates water jets which flush the molluscs from the bottom. Dredgers don't have a typical deck arrangement, the bridge and accommodation can be aft or forward. Derricks and winches may be installed for lowering and lifting the dredge. Echosounders are used for determining depths. right Lobster fishing boats Fishing boat in a heavy sea The fisheries research vessel RV Celtic Explorer * Gillnetters ‚Äì On inland waters and inshore, gillnets can be operated from open boats and canoes. In coastal waters, they are operated by small decked vessels which can have their wheelhouse either aft or forward. In coastal waters, gillnetting is often used as a second fishing method by trawlers or beam trawlers, depending on fishing seasons and targeted species. For offshore fishing, or fishing on the high seas, medium-sized vessels using drifting gillnets are called drifters, and the bridge is usually located aft. The nets are set and hauled by hand on small open boats. Larger boats use hydraulic or occasionally mechanical net haulers, or net drums. These vessels can be equipped with an echosounder, although locating fish is more a matter of the fishermen's personal knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than depending on special detection equipment. ** Set netters ‚Äì also operate gillnets. However, during fishing operations the vessel is not attached to the nets. The size of the vessels varies from open boats to large specialised drifters operating on the high seas. The wheelhouse is usually located aft, and the front deck is used for handling gear. Normally the nets are set at the stern by steaming ahead. Hauling is done over the side at the forepart of the deck, usually using hydraulic driven net haulers. Wet fish is packed in containers chilled with ice. Larger vessels might freeze the catch. * Lift netters ‚Äì are equipped to operate lift nets, which are held from the vessel's side and raised and lowered by means of outriggers. Lift netters range from open boats about 10 metres long to larger vessels with open ocean capability. Decked vessels usually have the bridge amidships. Larger vessels are often equipped with winches and derricks for handling the lifting lines, as well as outriggers and light booms. They can be fitted with powerful lights to attract and aggregate the fish to the surface. Open boats are usually unmechanized or use hand-operated winches. Electronic equipment, such as fishfinders, sonar and echo sounders are used extensively on larger boats. * Trap setters ‚Äì are used to set pots or traps for catching fish, crabs, lobsters, crayfish and other similar species. Trap setters range in size from open boats operating inshore to larger decked vessels, 20 to 50 metres long, operating out to the edge of the continental shelf. Small decked trap setters have the wheelhouse either forward or aft with the fish hold amidships. They use hydraulic or mechanical pot haulers. Larger vessels have the wheelhouse forward, and are equipped with derricks, davits or cranes for hauling pots aboard. Locating fish is often more a matter of the fishermen's knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than the use of special detection equipment. Decked vessels are usually equipped with an echosounder, and large vessels may also have a Loran or GPS. * Handliners ‚Äì are normally undecked vessels used for handlining (fishing with a line and hook). Handliners include canoes and other small or medium-sized vessels. Traditional handliners are less than 12 metres o/a, and do not have special gear handling, there is no winch or gurdy. Locating fish is left to the fishermen's personal knowledge of fishing grounds rather than the use of special electronic equipment. Non traditional handliners can set and haul using electrical or hydraulic powered reels. These mechanised reels are normally fastened to the gunwale or set on stanchions close to or overhanging the gunwale. They operate all over the world, some in shallow waters, some fishing up to 300 metres deep. No typical deck arrangement exists for handliners. * Multipurpose vessels ‚Äì are vessels which are designed so they can deploy more than one type of fishing gear without major modifications to the vessels. The fish detection equipment present on board also changes according to which fishing gear is being used. ** Trawler/Purse seiners ‚Äì are designed so the deck arrangement and equipment, including a suitable combination winch, can be used for both methods. Rollers, blocks, trawl gallows and purse davits need to be arranged so they control the lead of warps and pursing lines in such a way as to reduce the time needed to convert from one type to the other. Typical fish detection equipment includes a sonar and an echosounder. These vessels are usually designed as trawlers, since the power requirement for trawling is higher. * Research vessels ‚Äì a fisheries research vessel (FRV) requires platforms which are capable of towing different types of fishing nets, collecting plankton or water samples from a range of depths, and carrying acoustic fish-finding equipment. Fisheries research vessels are often designed and built along the same lines as a large fishing vessel, but with space given over to laboratories and equipment storage, as opposed to storage of the catch. An example of a fisheries research vessel is FRV Scotia. Artisan vessels Artisan fishing is small- scale commercial or subsistence fishing, particularly practices involving coastal or island ethnic groups using traditional fishing techniques and traditional boats. This may also include heritage groups involved in customary fishing practices. According to the FAO, at the end of 2004, the world fishing fleet consisted of about 4 million vessels, of which 2.7 million were undecked (open) boats. While nearly all decked vessels were mechanized, only one-third of the undecked fishing boats were powered, usually with outboard engines. The remaining 1.8 million boats were traditional craft of various types, operated by sail and oars. These figures for small fishing vessels are probably under reported. The FAO compiles these figures largely from national registers. These records often omit smaller boats where registration is not required or where fishing licences are granted by provincial or municipal authorities.

File:Vietnamese fishing boat 05.jpgTraditional Vietnamese fishing boat File:First known photo of Koreans 1871.jpgFishing junk, 1871 Artisan fishing boats are usually small traditional fishing boats, appropriately designed for use on their local inland waters or coasts. Many localities around the world have developed their own traditional types of fishing boats, adapted to use local materials suitable for boat building and to the specific requirements of the fisheries and sea conditions in their area. Artisan boats are often open (undecked). Many have sails, but they do not usually use much, or any mechanised or electronic gear. Large numbers of artisan fishing boats are still in use, particularly in developing countries with long productive marine coastlines. For example, Indonesia has reported about 700,000 fishing boats, 25 percent of which are dugout canoes, and half of which are without motors. The Philippines have reported a similar number of small fishing boats. Many of the boats in this area are double-outrigger craft, consisting of a narrow main hull with two attached outriggers, commonly known as jukung in Indonesia and banca in the Philippines.

Just about anything that will stay afloat can be called a recreational fishing boat, so long as a fisher periodically climbs aboard with the intent to catch a fish. Usually some form of fishing tackle is brought on board, such as hooks, lines, sinkers or nets. Fish are caught for recreational purposes from boats which range from dugout canoes, kayaks, rafts, pontoon boats and small dinghies to runabouts, cabin cruisers and cruising yachts to large, hi-tech and luxurious big game rigs.NOAA: Sport fishing boat Larger boats, purpose-built with recreational fishing in mind, usually have large, open cockpits at the stern, designed for convenient fishing. Big game fishing started as a sport after the invention of the motorized boat. Charles Frederick Holder, a marine biologist and early conservationist, is credited with founding the sport in 1898. Purpose built game fishing boats appeared shortly after. An example is the Crete, in use at Catalina Island, California, in 1915, and shipped to Hawaii the following year. According to a newspaper report at that time, the Crete had \\"a deep cockpit, a chair fitted for landing big fish and leather pockets for placing the pole.\\" It is difficult to estimate how many recreational fishing boats there are, although the number is high. The term is fluid, since most recreational boats are also used for fishing from time to time. Unlike most commercial fishing vessels, recreational fishing boats are often not dedicated just to fishing. Standard aluminum bass boat, with trolling motor * Fishing kayaks have gained popularity in recent years. The kayak has long been a means of accessing fishing grounds. * Pontoon boats have also become popular in recent years. These boats allow one or two fishermen to get into small rivers or lakes that would have difficulty accommodating larger boats. Typically 8‚Äì12 ft in length, these inflatable craft can be assembled quickly and easily. Some feature rigid frames derived from the white water rafting industry. * Bass boats are small aluminium or fibreglass boats used in lakes and rivers in the U.S. for fishing bass and other panfish. They have swivel chairs for the anglers, storage bins for fishing tackle, and a tank with recirculating water for caught fish. They are usually fitted with an outboard motor and a trolling motor. * Charter boats are often privately operated, purpose-built fishing boats, and host fishing trips for paying clients. Their size can range widely depending on the type of trips run and the geographical location. * Freshwater fishing boats account for approximately one third of all registered boats in the USA. Most other types of boats end up being used for fishing on occasion. * Saltwater fishing boats vary widely in size and can be specialized for certain species of fish. Flounder boats, for example, have flat bottoms for a shallow draft and are used in protected, shallow waters. Sport fishing boats range from 25 to 80 feet or more, and can be powered by large outboard engines or inboard diesels. Boats used for fishing in cold climates may have space dedicated to a cuddy cabin or enclosed wheelhouse, while boats in warmer climates are more likely to be open.

Since its founding in 2003, more than 160 institutions have adopted portions of the NPA‚Äôs Recommendations for Postdoctoral Policies and Practices. Today the NPA has 180 institutional members, whose research efforts are supported by 40,000 postdocs, and 2,000 individual members Largely run by member volunteers, NPA activities are coordinated by three professional staff members located at NPA headquarters in Washington, DC. The NPA is supported by its members and charitable contributions from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. History The NPA was established with the goal of facilitating improvements for postdoctoral researchers in the United States. At the time of its founding, there was no national organization with the primary aim of improving the American postdoctoral experience. The NPA has worked collaboratively with research institutions, postdoctoral affairs offices (PDOs), postdoctoral associations (PDAs), professional organizations, and scientific funding agencies. The NPA has sought especially to encourage the creation of additional PDOs and PDAs.  Founding members  A steering committee composed of postdoctoral representatives from across the country initiated the formation of the NPA. The committee coalesced in April 2002 during Science's NextWave Postdoc Network meeting held in Washington D.C. At this meeting, attendees expressed broad support for a national organization that would provide focus and affect positive change for postdocs. In January 2003, the NPA was officially formed. The founding members of the NPA include: *Orfeu M. Buxton - University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois *Karen Christopherson - Stanford Medical School, Stanford, California *Raymond Clark - University of California, La Jolla, California *Carol L. Manahan - Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland *Arti Patel - National Cancer Institute/NIH, Bethesda, Maryland *Avi Spier - The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California *Claudina Aleman Stevenson - National Cancer Institute/NIH, Bethesda, Maryland Aims The aim of the NPA is to advance the U.S. research enterprise by maximizing the effectiveness of the research community and enhancing the quality of the postdoctoral experience for all participants. Organization Largely run by member volunteers, NPA activities are coordinated by two professional staff members located at NPA headquarters in Washington, D.C. The NPA is supported by its members and grants from government agencies and private foundations.  Leadership  The NPA is led by a 12-member Board of Directors that is elected by the dues-paying membership. Within this Board, the Executive Committee and Governance Committees provide direction for the operations of the association. The Board governs the Committees of the Membership and the Executive Director. The Advisory Council also reports to the Board and provides an additional resource for guidance and support to the Board and Executive Director. The staff report directly to the Executive Director. The members of the Board of Directors are elected for a two-year term, and Board elections are held annually. Governance Committee Chairs serve one-year terms. The Board appoints Chairs and Vice Chairs for the Committees of the Membership and the Diversity and International Officers, usually after a call for candidates.  Membership  There are three types of NPA membership: Affiliate Member, Sustaining Member, and Full Individual Member. Organizations can obtain a Sustaining Membership that serves as a conduit for complimentary affiliate membership to that organization‚Äôs individuals. Any individual may join the NPA under the full membership category. Committees of the membership These committees are run by volunteers and are open to anyone interested in improving the postdoctoral experience. Advocacy Committee: Addresses advocacy and policy issues affecting the postdoctoral community. Activities of this committee include the promotion and implementation of NPA recommended policies and practices as described in the Agenda for Change, increasing diversity among postdoctoral researchers, and monitoring the interests of international postdocs training in the United States. Additionally, the Advocacy Committee monitors policy issues and helps to maintain relationships with federal agencies and national organizations. Meetings Committee: Plans and coordinates NPA-sponsored meetings and seminars. The main tasks revolve around the Annual and Regional meetings, including development of agendas, logistical arrangements, marketing and fundraising activities, and conducting post-meeting evaluations Outreach Committee: Conducts outreach activities to promote the mission of the NPA. Its main activities include development and implementation of an annual campaign to recruit and retain NPA members, and expansion of member benefits through partnerships with organizations, businesses, and institutions. This committee is working on cultivating relationships with news media, societies. and other groups interested in postdoctoral issues. Resource Development Committee: Develops and maintains tools and resources for use by the postdoctoral community. Main activities of this committee include maintaining the NPA website, publication of The POSTDOCKet, the quarterly publication of the NPA, and creation and implementation of NPA-sponsored surveys Diversity and international officers The Diversity Officer provides leadership on diversity issues and brings together postdocs and their allies in order to develop new resources, track information, promote dialogue, and effect change for underrepresented groups. The International Officer serves as the public face of international postdoc issues for the NPA. The Officers work with the membership committees to ensure that the NPA addresses the needs of the communities they represent and are the primary resource and expert advisor to the NPA Board of Directors, the Staff, and committees.  Governance committees  Governance committees are generally populated by the members of the Board of Directors, although members of the NPA Advisory Council may be invited to serve if their skill set matches the agenda of the Committee. * Development * Finance * Oversight governance * Personnel * Strategic planning Program activities The NPA‚Äôs program activities are focused in three key areas:  Advocacy  The association advocates for policy change within research institutions that host postdoctoral scholars. Since the association‚Äôs founding, more than 160 institutions have adopted portions of the NPA‚Äôs Recommended Practices. The NPA continues to work with the leadership of federal funding agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF), to develop new programs and policies for postdoctoral training, compensation, and benefits. The NPA values its partners in advocacy, including prominent national associations and organizations that represent the scientific, research, and higher education communities.  Community-building  The NPA hosts annual and regional meetings to provide opportunities for the postdoctoral community to gather and share best practices. The association also maintains various listservs and a Web site to facilitate networking nationwide  Resource development  The NPA continues to provide the tools and resources that postdocs and administrators need for success. Most NPA publications are available online, with selected resources for members only. These include: an International Postdoc Survival Guide, Toolkits for Postdoc Associations & Offices, an Institutional Policy Database, and a Career Development Clearinghouse.  Events = Annual meeting  Ever since its birth, the NPA convenes once a year for a meeting that focuses on postdoc activities (e.g., career development, training standard, advocacy, etc.). The meeting locations alternate between the East coast and the West coast, and spans two-and-a-half days. The first day of the meeting includes on site registration, a poster session, sessions for new attendees and round table networking meetings about the structure and functioning of the PDA and PDOs, as well as opening reception. The second day includes many plenary sessions, and concurrent workshops that cover topics of interests for postdocs, as well as keynote speaker. The third day continues with some concurrent sessions, plenary, and the meeting concludes with a town-hall meeting for the NPA, where ideas for new topics are exchanged. Over the years sessions have included: career development and immigration planning for postdocs, underrepresented minority in academia, science and policy, issues related to communicating with non- scientific audience, a transition from academia to industry workshop Myers- Briggs sessions, posters describing activities in various postdoc associations nationwide. Among the keynote speakers, Dr Francis Collins, Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), gave a speech at the 8th NPA meeting in Philadelphia March 12‚Äì14, 2010, for 283 attendants. = 2012 = The 2012 NPA Meeting was held at the Sir Francis Drake Hotel in San Francisco, CA from March 16‚Äì18, 2012. This meeting marked the 10th anniversary of the NPA and had over 300 attendees. The 2012 meeting featured a session with the NPA founders, provided sessions about the growth and contributions of the NPA to postdocs, and the nationwide role the NPA plays to the postdoctoral community. During a Town Hall session, participants were invited to provide the NPA with what they thought are unsolved or unknown problems in the scientific research community in general, as well as postdoc-specific issues, in order to incorporate them in the future strategic planning for the organization. The meeting also hosted sessions for networking and innovative discussions. As always, the NPA meeting gives special care to international postdocs, with sessions on immigration and Green Card application. The meeting‚Äôs Keynote speaker was Dr. Alan Leshner, Chief Executive Officer of the American Association on for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and Executive Publisher of the journal Science since December 2001. Dr. Leshner spoke on the current state of the scientific enterprise and what the future may hold. The NPA LinkedIn page saw a surge of almost 1200 new members in the 3 months following the meeting.  National Postdoc Appreciation Week  Starting 2009, every year the NPA holds a celebration to highlight the contributions of postdocs. The event takes places on the third week of September. Institutions and universities around the US participate in that event through major networking activities, including happy hour, seminars, and more. Although postdoc training is considered a temporary position, postdocs are a vital part of the research body, and contribute a major portion of publications and grants. Therefore, the NPA decided to focus on the role postdocs play by celebrating an annual National Postdoc Appreciation Week. This event includes not only postdocs, but also graduate students and faculty members, friends and family. September 24, 2009 marked the National Postdoctoral Association's first ever 'National Postdoc Appreciation Day'. 70 institutions across 27 states hosted celebrations, and there were events held in Canada and Australia. The Appreciation Day was organized to recognize the contribution that postdocs make to research every day across the country. Events were organized at institutions ranging from universities and research institutes, to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Events ran the gamut from ice cream socials, to BBQs and Happy Hours. Many institutions also used the day as an opportunity to hold career seminars, mini research symposia and presentations about maximising the postdoctoral experience.  Interaction with the community  The NPA maintains a Facebook page, a LinkedIn page, and a Twitter account. These sites are used to encourage communication and information sharing by the NPA members and the community.  Recognition  *In an article published in Nature, Stacy L.

Lomasney served as State Senator, State Representative, and alderman but is best known as the political boss of Boston's West End. Lomasney wielded considerable influence in city and state politics for over 40 years and was nicknamed \\"the Mahatma\\" for his uncanny ability to deliver votes for his preferred candidates, In the course of his colorful career, Lomasney was shot once, feuded with James Michael Curley and John F. Fitzgerald, told the Archbishop of Boston to \\"mind his own business,\\" advised Al Smith, played a major role in the drafting of the current Massachusetts Constitution, and assisted thousands of constituents to obtain jobs, housing, and other necessities. Initially, Lomasney's ward was predominantly Irish. Over the years, as the Irish began migrating out of the West End to Roxbury and Dorchester, and the city zoning board expanded his ward to include the North and South Ends, Lomasney expanded his influence to bring together a large, ethnically diverse coalition of mostly poor and working-class voters. Early life Lomasney was born in the West End of Boston on December 3, 1859 to Maurice and Mary (n√©e Murray) Lomasney. His parents were immigrants from Fermoy, County Cork, Ireland, who fled the Great Famine. His father was a tailor. After his parents and two of his siblings died, Lomasney and his younger brother Joseph moved in with their aunt. \\"Joe\\" would later become Lomasney's political lieutenant. The boys were expected to earn their keep, and Martin dropped out of school at age 10 to shine shoes, deliver papers and, later, work in a machine shop. In his spare time, he read anything that he could get his hands on, except fiction. For a time, he was the leader of a local Irish street gang. Political career In 1884, Lomasney went to work as a ward heeler for Mike Wells, a local politician, and was rewarded with a city job as a lamplighter on Boston's Nashua Street. The job paid well and gave him ample time for political activities. He became the leader of a group of young Democrats, known as the \\"Independents,\\" who were determined to unseat the incumbent Democrats on the Ward Committee. The Hendricks Club In 1885, Lomasney founded a headquarters for the Independents at 11A Green Street. It was named The Hendricks Club after Vice President Thomas A. Hendricks, a supporter of Irish independence. The clubhouse featured a pot-bellied stove, a pool table, and a poker table. Liquor and dice-playing were strictly forbidden. Lomasney kept an office on the second floor, where he spent his days dispensing and calling in favors for supporters: jobs, housing, immigration assistance, coal in the winter, influence in court cases, funeral expenses, and seed money for business ventures. He kept a file of embarrassing information on his colleagues which often proved useful in negotiations. The Hendricks was one of the earliest political clubs of its kind. Lomasney called the club \\"a machine for getting votes.\\" Lomasney frequently sent aides to the docks in East Boston to meet new immigrants and to carry signs that read, \\"Welcome to America. The Democratic Party Welcomes You to America. Martin Lomasney Welcomes You to Boston.\\" Often, the newcomers were desperately poor and unskilled, and the Hendricks Club would help them find manual labor and decent housing. He earned the loyalty of countless residents, who showed their gratitude by voting as he suggested. His ability to deliver as many votes as needed for a candidate or piece of legislation earned him the nickname \\"the Mahatma.\\" Other bosses soon followed his example: Thomas W. Flood's Somerset Associates in the North End (1888), John F. Fitzgerald's Jefferson Club in South Boston (early 1890s), James Michael Curley's Tammany Club in Roxbury (1901). On the Sunday before every election, ward residents would pack the large hall to hear Lomasney speak on the issues and candidates of the day. Despite his lack of formal education, he was an eloquent speaker with a fondness for poetic quotations. He was also a powerful orator who, like a revivalist preacher, could stir the crowd into a near-frenzy. Former residents of the ward often traveled long distances to attend his \\"sermons,\\" and local newspapers sent their best reporters to cover the event.  Public office and campaign tactics  Political wards in Boston, 1896Lomasney earned his first public office with a seat on the Boston Board of Alderman in 1893. Boston politics were not for the faint of heart. Candidates were routinely smeared and threatened, and voters were bribed and blackmailed. A common practice was to send aides dressed as Protestant clergymen to \\"campaign\\" for rival candidates in Irish Catholic neighborhoods. Lomasney played political hardball and made many enemies as well as friends. He feuded with James Michael Curley for 20 years. In 1894, Lomasney was shot in the leg in an unsuccessful assassination attempt. His assailant, James A. Dunan, blamed Lomasney for a dispute that he had with the Boston Board of Health. In 1895, Lomasney was elected to the Massachusetts State Senate. As a Senator, he opposed the construction of Boston's elevated railway. One of Lomasney's dirty tricks has earned a special place in Boston history. In 1898, as chairman of his district Democratic Party, he was responsible for organizing the convention to nominate a State Senate candidate (who was practically guaranteed election in the heavily Democratic city). He scheduled the convention for 4:30 p.m. in East Boston, across the harbor from the State House, where nomination papers had to be filed by 5:00 p.m. that day. His faction met in one room and the rival faction met in another, with each nominating its own candidate. Both factions then raced their paperwork across the harbor by ferry and tugboat and then to cyclists, who pedaled furiously up Beacon Hill to the State House. Lomasney's courier arrived first by several minutes. In 1905, Lomasney endorsed Yankee Republican Louis Frothingham for Mayor against his Democratic rival John F. Fitzgerald and delivered Frothingham 95% of the vote from his ward. Like Lomasney, Frothingham was opposed to women's suffrage. In the end, the Republican vote was split by another contender, Henry M. Dewey, and Frothingham lost to Fitzgerald. After being elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1910, Lomasney worked with labor leaders to enact a 48-hour work week and workmen's compensation but opposed their attempts to exclude aliens from their unions. In 1912, when the Suffolk Evening Law School petitioned the state legislature for the right to grant degrees, elites on the Massachusetts Board of Education, the Boston Bar Association, and Harvard University objected. At the time, evening law schools were an important path to the middle class for ambitious sons of working-class immigrants. The first students at Suffolk came from Irish, Italian, Jewish, and other backgrounds. Members of Boston's Yankee-dominated legal establishment took a dim view of such school. One of them remarked that trying to make attorneys out of such people was \\"like trying to turn cart horses into trotters.\\" Lomasney campaigned strenuously for the school, and it gained the right to grant degrees in 1914. At the Democratic National Conventions in St. Louis in 1916 and in San Francisco in 1920, Lomasney tried to have a plank added to the party platform endorsing the independence of Ireland. Both times, his request was denied. Massachusetts Constitutional Convention Lomasney was one of 320 delegates to the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention of 1917‚Äì19, representing the 5th Suffolk District of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. The convention's historian, Raymond L. Bridgman, later wrote, \\"Martin M. Lomasney was conspicuously the most intense personal force in the convention. He was a leader, a hard hitter, a fair fighter, generous, sympathetic, respected by all who came close enough to feel the strength of his personal qualities.\\" At the convention, Lomasney argued in support of two amendments, both of which passed. The first allowed the state and local governments to provide the people with food, shelter, and other necessities in times of war or emergency. Conservatives denounced the measure as socialist. The second prohibited the state from funding private denominational institutions such as schools, hospitals, and charitable agencies. Lomasney researched the issue and found that while Protestant institutions had received $18 million from the state, Catholic institutions had received only $49,000. When Archbishop of Boston William Henry O'Connell pressured him to oppose the amendment, Lomasney reportedly said, \\"Tell His Eminence to mind his own business.\\" Later career When his career started, Lomasney's ward was predominantly Irish. Over the years, as the Irish began moving to Roxbury and Dorchester, Jewish immigrants became the dominant group. The city zoning board gradually expanded the ward to include the Italian-dominated North End and part of the racially diverse South End. By 1930, over 30 nationalities were represented in the ward. By backing diverse candidates for the House of Representatives and by treating his constituents equally, Lomasney managed to bring together a large, ethnically diverse coalition of mostly poor and working-class voters. Presidential candidate Al Smith sought Lomasney's advice on campaign issues in 1928. When John F. Fitzgerald asked him to support Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932, however, Lomasney declined, predicting Roosevelt's election would lead to war. His final political battle took place in 1932, when he led the successful campaign of William M. Prendible for Clerk of the Suffolk County Superior Criminal Court.  Personal life  Lomasney never married or had children. A practicing Catholic, he went to church regularly. Outside politics, he led a quiet, almost ascetic life. Although he never drank, he vehemently opposed Prohibition because he knew that it would force the local tavern keepers to take up bootlegging. Apart from his political activities, he made a fortune in the 1920s by investing in real estate, which he later sold to developers at a considerable profit. Death On August 12, 1933, after a months-long bout of bronchial pneumonia, he died at home surrounded by family and friends. He had been living in the Hotel Bellevue. He left an estate valued at approximately $250,000, but his will provided only a modest annuity for his brother Joe with whom he had been feuding. Legacy Soon after his death, the West End political machine began to crumble. Lomasney once advised a young follower, \\"Don't write when you can talk; don't talk when you can nod your head.\\" Perhaps for that reason, no well-documented full-length biography has been written about him. Historian Thomas H. O'Connor called Leslie G. Ainley's Boston Mahatma: Martin Lomasney (1949) \\"a fascinating but undocumented account\\" of his life. For a ward boss of his day, Lomasney appears to have been relatively ethical. Although his power over the voters in his ward often prompted allegations of voter fraud, nothing was ever proved. Even a rival, John F. Fitzgerald (also known as \\"Honey Fitz\\"), told a historian years later that Ward Eight had been too closely watched for Lomasney to have been able to get away with that.Criminal rackets never thrived in the West End until after Lomasney's tenure. A street, Lomasney Way, Boston is named after him, and the Ward 8 cocktail was inspired by him.

They live across the street from the main characters, the Freeman family ‚Äî Robert and his grandsons, Huey and Riley. Tom Thomas Lancaster DuBois, a wealthy and mild-mannered black man, is an assistant district attorney and close friend of Robert Freeman. Tom, being non-confrontational and skittish by nature, adheres strictly to the law, particularly due to his irrational fear of being sent to prison and anally raped.\\"A Date With The Health Inspector\\". The Boondocks. By McGruder, Aaron. Adult Swim. December 5, 2005 This fear originated when Tom was exposed at a very young age to a television series that depicted a violent prison rape. The fear developed to such a degree that Tom refused to participate in even the slightest of legal infractions (even those that are not punishable by a prison sentence) as a youth and throughout adulthood. His job as a prosecuting attorney is ironic: He essentially sends other people (mostly black men) to the fate he himself most fears, and he seems to feel guilty about it. Tom is ultimately forced to confront his phobia in the third-season episode A Date With the Booty Warrior, where he comes face to face with a rapist dubbed \\"Booty Warrior\\" after being trapped in a prison washroom during a riot. Tom seemingly conquers his fear after beating the would-be rapist unconscious with a bar of soap (after he slipped and fell on his back), and also mentions to Sarah that he plans on becoming a public defender in order to save young men from being violated in prison. Tom's political ideologies are more towards American liberalism and as a result he is a Democrat. Tom's passion for his political ideologies are marked by an incident where he kidnaps Ralph Nader during the 2004 United States Presidential election, who he believes is a threat that could stunt the Democratic vote.McGruder, Aaron. Public Enemy #2. New York: Three Rivers Press, 2005. 142-144. Print. Tom's hobbies include singing and playing the piano, and he once dreamt of becoming a successful recording artist, he also sang a full version of Usher's song \\"Burn\\" and did a spoof of the music video, but was later made more realistic when it was interrupted by a moving car, as well as Sarah asking him if he was doing that \\"Music Video thing\\" again. He also played basketball on his Ivy League college team at Princeton University\\"Ballin'\\" The Boondocks. By McGruder, Aaron. Adult Swim. December 3, 2007 but, as Sarah points out, he was mostly a bench warmer. He is depicted as somewhat of a goober and a wet blanket in social situations, since he seems unable to truly lighten up. He and his wife are active members of the NAACP and demonstrate a strong understanding of the struggles of African Americans, much as Huey does. Huey is more proactive and confrontational in his approach and generally questions to what degree the NAACP helps African Americans. Furthermore, Huey views Tom as part of the white power structure that he detests (i.e., part of the \\"system\\"), however, he does show Tom respect as an elder. Riley's interactions with Tom are few and far between, and (like most adults Riley encounters) he doesn't respect him. This leaves him prone to clash with Tom in many of the same ways he clashes with his own grandfather. Tom was also temporarily possessed by the spirit of Colonel H. Stinkmeaner.\\"Stinkmeaner Strikes Back\\". The Boondocks. By McGruder, Aaron. Adult Swim. October 29, 2007 Sarah Sarah DuBois is the least prevalent character from the DuBois family, though she becomes more prominent in the third season of the TV series. She, like her husband, is liberal and fiercely political. She focuses her efforts on political action against the conservative parties. She is incredibly casual about her interracial marriage, even going so far as to joke about it when Tom is mocked and attacked for it. Sarah is a member of the NAACP and a self-proclaimed \\"crusader for black rights.\\"McGruder, Aaron. A Right to be Hostile. New York: Three Rivers Press, 2003. 19. Print. She and Tom have also clashed over her support for Ralph Nader.McGruder, Aaron. A Right to be Hostile. New York: Three Rivers Press, 2003. 86-89, 91-93, 105-107. Print. There have been numerous references to Sarah regretting marrying Tom, mostly because of Tom's fear of going to jail and getting raped has caused both of them to miss out a lot in life. Sarah is shown to be much more playful and low-key than Tom, which leads to strains on their relationship (such as when he refused to lighten up and have a little extra wine on their anniversary due to his prison rape phobia). She is hinted to be somewhat sexually frustrated.\\"Tom, Sarah and Usher\\" The Boondocks. By McGruder, Aaron. Adult Swim.

Jazmine Jazmine DuBois is a na√Øve and innocent ten-year-old bi-racial girl, which, to her chagrin, occasionally makes her an object of ridicule for Huey and Riley. She is the most prominent child in the show other than the Freeman boys, and was a central character in Season 1. Though Huey takes pleasure in criticizing her both subtly and conspicuously, he has also shown a willingness to empathize with her and tends to avoid being mean just for the sake of it. Most of the time, when he berates her, it is his way of dealing with her ignorance and na√Øvet√© in what could be construed as an unnecessarily cruel way to try to enlighten her. Though such attempts usually fail, he remains patient and tolerant. For her part, Jazmine appears to be a kind friend to Huey, as when she applauds enthusiastically for Huey's unchanged \\"Black Jesus\\" play‚Äîunlike Granddad and Riley, who fall asleep. When Jazmine starts a lemonade stand in \\"The Block Is Hot\\" and later gets exploited by Ed Wuncler Sr., Huey rallies up protesters in hopes to liberate her. In the end when the stand burns down and it begins to snow, he shares his scarf with her. In the nationwide pandemic during \\"The Fried Chicken Flu,\\" Jazmine is the only person Huey allows into his home other than his immediate family in the episode. In the comic strip, Jazmine has trouble accepting the fact that she is Multiracial, wishing her hair to be straight instead of puffy and Afro-like.McGruder, Aaron. A Right to be Hostile. New York: Three Rivers Press, 2003. 15-20. Print. She was a regularly featured character in the comic strip until 2001, when the strip took a more political focus upon which she inexplicably disappeared until the later years of the strip. During that time, Jazmine was replaced by Michael Caesar as the prominent character other than Huey and Riley Freeman. She returned to the comic strip in 2004, explaining that she had been so afraid of terrorism that she hid in her room for two years.McGruder, Aaron. \\"The Boondocks.\\" Kansas City, MO: Universal Press Syndicate.

In a demonstration for some VIP civilian visitors, Greeneville performed an emergency ballast blow surfacing maneuver. As the submarine shot to the surface, she struck Ehime Maru. Within 10 minutes of the collision, Ehime Maru sank. Nine of the thirty-five people on board were killed: four high-school students, two teachers, and three crew members. Many Japanese, including government officials, were concerned over news that civilians were present in Greeneville's control room at the time of the accident. Some expressed anger because of a perception that the submarine did not try to assist Ehime Maru survivors and that the submarine's captain, Commander Scott Waddle, did not apologize immediately afterwards. The USN conducted a public court of inquiry, placed blame on Waddle and other members of Greenevilles crew, and dealt non- judicial punishment or administrative disciplinary action to the captain and some crew members. After Commander Waddle had faced the Naval Board of Inquiry, it was decided that a full court-martial would be unnecessary, and he was forced to retire and given an honorable discharge. In response to requests from the families of Ehime Maru victims and the government of Japan, the USN raised Ehime Maru from the ocean floor in October 2001 and moved her to shallow water closer to Oahu. Once there, USN and Japanese divers located and retrieved the remains of eight of the nine victims from the wreck. Ehime Maru was then moved back out to sea and scuttled in deep water. The USN compensated the government of Ehime Prefecture, Ehime Maru survivors, and victims' family members for the accident. Waddle traveled to Japan in December 2002 to apologize to the ship's survivors and victims' families. The accident renewed calls by many in Japan for the United States to make more effort in reducing crimes and accidents involving U.S. military personnel who injure or kill Japanese citizens. In response to the accident, the USN changed its policies regarding civilian visits to its ships. Incident=Prelude On 10 January 2001, Ehime Maru, a Japanese fishing trawler owned by the government of Ehime Prefecture, in length and measuring 741 gross tons, departed from Uwajima Fisheries High School, a high school in Uwajima, Ehime Prefecture. The ship, captained by Hisao ≈ånishi, headed for Hawaii on a planned 74-day voyage to train high school students who were interested in pursuing careers as fishermen. A total of 35 people were on board Ehime Maru: 20 crewmembers, 13 students, and two teachers. The ship's curriculum included long-line tuna fishing, maritime navigation, marine engineering, and oceanography. The ship docked at Honolulu Harbor on 8 February.USN, Record of Proceedings, p. 8‚Äì9, Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 104, and NTSB, Marine Accident Brief. Ehime Maru was launched in 1996 and was registered in Japan with number 135174 and had a capacity to carry up to 45 students at a time in addition to 20 crewmembers and 2 instructors. Tipper Gore at the helm of USS Greeneville during a similar Distinguished Visitor Embarkation mission, in 1999 On 9 February, USS Greeneville, a U.S. Navy nuclear-powered attack submarine, prepared to depart Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, to conduct a public relations mission under the USN's Distinguished Visitor Embarkation (DVE) program. The program took civilians, members of Congress, journalists, and other \\"opinion makers\\" for rides on nuclear submarines to demonstrate the submarines' capabilities; its goal was to demonstrate the need to maintain a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines. Greeneville had previously participated in several DVE missions, carrying notable civilians such as Tipper Gore and James Cameron. For this mission, Greeneville was to carry 16 civilian Distinguished Visitors (DVs): eight CEOs, six of them with their spouses; and a free-lance sports writer, with his spouse.USN, Report of Proceedings, p. 2, 14, 79‚Äì85, and Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 108‚Äì118. The CEOs were in Hawaii to support a fundraising effort to restore the retired battleship Missouri. This DVE visit had originally been arranged by retired Rear Admiral Richard C. Macke. Accompanying the DV civilians on the mission was Navy Captain Robert L. Brandhuber, Chief of Staff for Rear Admiral Albert H. Konetzni Jr., the commander of the submarine component of the United States Pacific Fleet, abbreviated as COMSUBPAC.Kyodo, \\"U.S. to extend hunt for missing crew of ship by one day,\\" USN, Report of Proceedings, p. 2, 14, 79‚Äì85, Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 108‚Äì118. According to the U.S. Navy, 16 civilians were on board the USS Greeneville on 9 February 2001, when the submarine collided with the Japanese vessel Ehime Maru. Civilians on board USS Greeneville: Jay Brehmer ‚Äì Overland Park, Kansas; Carol Brehmer ‚Äì Overland Park, Kansas; Jack Clary ‚Äì Stow, Massachusetts; Pat Clary ‚Äì Stow, Massachusetts; Helen Cullen ‚Äì Houston, Texas; John M.

Source: U.S. Navy Pacific Fleet Public Affairs Office The captain of the Greeneville, Commander Scott Waddle, was considered a rising star in the U.S. Navy at the time and had led the submarine through several DVE trips. Before departing on the mission, Commander Waddle was informed that the ship's Analog Video Signal Display Unit (AVSDU) was inoperative. The AVSDU was an analog video monitor, located forward of the submarine's periscope in the control room, that displayed information from the sub's three sonar stacks and screens. The monitor helped communicate sonar information to the officer of the deck. Waddle decided to continue with the mission without attempting to repair the monitor, believing that it was not a crucial piece of equipment.USN Report of Proceedings, p. 16, Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 117. Greeneville transits the channel between Pearl Harbor and the Pacific Ocean. Greeneville departed Pearl Harbor on time at 08:00 local time (HST) with a crew of 106 in addition to the 16 DV passengers and Chief of Staff Brandhuber. As the submarine transited the ship channel from Pearl Harbor, Waddle noticed that the weather was \\"hazier than normal\\", but he thought that the haze would burn off shortly.Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 118‚Äì120. Greeneville reached its dive point south of Oahu () slightly later than scheduled, at 10:17, and submerged. The DVs were scheduled to be served lunch in two sittings, the first from 10:30 to 11:30 and the second from 11:30 to 12:30. After lunch, the submarine was to display its operational abilities and then return the DVs to Pearl Harbor for a reception that was scheduled to begin at 14:30. The lunch service ran late, and other Greeneville officers repeatedly reminded Waddle that the submarine needed to begin its demonstration maneuvers or it would be late back to port. Finally, at 13:10, Waddle entered the submarine's control room and prepared to execute the demonstration. Fifteen of the 16 DVs and Brandhuber entered the control room to observe the maneuvers.USN, Report of Proceedings, p. 18, NTSB, Marine Accident Brief, Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 118‚Äì120. Waddle says the submarine dived at 09:30 after departing Pearl Harbor. Meanwhile, at 12:00, Ehime Maru had departed Honolulu harbor en route to fishing grounds about south () of Oahu. By 12:50, the ship was proceeding at about eight nautical miles (15 km) south of Oahu and was nearing the area where Greeneville was conducting the DVE cruise.NTSB, Marine Accident Brief. Three crewmen were on duty in Greeneville sonar room. At 12:30, the submarine's sonar operators detected a surface vessel in the vicinity and designated the contact as \\"Sierra 12\\" (S-12). A few minutes later, they detected a second vessel estimated to be about away (submarine passive sonar does not give range (distance) information), which was designated as \\"Sierra 13\\" (S-13). S-13 was Ehime Maru. Also tracking the sonar contacts in the control room was Patrick Seacrest, Greeneville's sole fire control technician on duty at the time. Seacrest was responsible for \\"determining the course, speed, and range of surface and submerged vessels (or targets) potentially posing a threat to the submarine.\\"USN, Report of Proceedings, p. 24, 26‚Äì27, NTSB, Marine Accident Brief. At 12:58, Seacrest designated the track of S-13 as heading away from Greeneville's location. Beginning at 13:00, Seacrest elected to discontinue updating the Contact Evaluation Plot (CEP) in the control room. The CEP is a \\"labor-intensive\\" paper display that plots ship data and contact information for reference by control room personnel. Seacrest stated that one of the reasons that he decided to stop updating the CEP was that the DV guests were standing between his watchstation and the CEP.USN, Report of Proceedings, p. 24, 26‚Äì27, NTSB, Marine Accident Brief, Kyodo, \\"Waddle is denied immunity as inquiry nears end.\\" Collision Before beginning the maneuvers, Waddle checked the submarine's sonar contacts and noted that there were several surface vessels in the vicinity, but none closer than seven nautical miles (13 km) away.Waddle, CNN interview on \\"Larry King Live\\", 26 April 2001. Ehime Maru was one of these vessels. The civilians were spread throughout the control room, with three on the periscope platform and others in front of the fire control station, restricting free access to some of the displays. According to several crewmembers, Waddle, when informed that equipment preparations would further delay the start of the demonstration maneuvers, \\"seemed frustrated that he couldn't start the maneuvers right away.\\"USN, Report of Proceedings, p. 29, NTSB, Marine Accident Brief. Greeneville AVSDU (center) and periscope (partly visible, right side)For 15 minutes, beginning at 13:15, 46 minutes after the scheduled time, Greeneville performed a series of drastic maneuvers, including high-speed, full-rudder, 35-degree turns side to side, as well as rapid up-and-down movements. Waddle personally directed the maneuvers. According to Waddle, the DVs \\"were loving it.\\" Waddle adds, \\"I could barely suppress a smile as I watched the expressions of joy and amazement on the faces of our distinguished visitors.\\"Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 120‚Äì121, 126. During the maneuvers, several civilians in the sonar room conversed with the sonar technicians, who were at the same time trying to keep track of any sonar contacts in the vicinity.USN, Report of Proceedings, p. 28‚Äì31, NTSB, Marine Accident Brief, Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 120‚Äì121, 126. As the high-speed maneuvers finished at 13:30, Waddle called for Greeneville to perform an emergency dive (called an \\"emergency deep\\") followed by an emergency main ballast blow, a maneuver that brings the submarine from a depth of about to the surface in a few seconds by using high-pressure air to force the water out of the ship's ballast tanks as quickly as possible. The rise is so rapid that the submarine's bow rises high out of the water upon surfacing. Before executing this maneuver, the submarine was required to go to periscope depth to check for ships or dangerous obstacles on the surface. After completing the high-speed maneuvers, standing orders called for the submarine to hold a steady course for three minutes to reestablish sonar contact, which had been disrupted by the high speed maneuvers, with any vessels in the area. In this case, however, Waddle ordered the submarine to change course and go to periscope depth after holding the steady course for only 90 seconds.USN, Report of Proceedings, p. 35‚Äì42, NTSB, Marine Accident Brief, Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 122‚Äì123, Kyodo, \\"Testimonial immunity given to key Greeneville witness.\\" Greeneville sonar roomAs Greeneville ascended to periscope depth, Waddle checked the sonar displays and the fire control station monitors, but reported later that he heard and saw nothing to suggest that the previously detected vessels in the area were now any closer to the submarine's position than had been reported before the submarine began the high speed maneuvers.NTSB, Marine Accident Brief, USN, Report of Proceedings, p. 2, 41‚Äì42. Because the AVSDU was not working, Greeneville's executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Gerald K. Pfeifer, entered the sonar room and observed the contacts on the sonar screens. Pfeifer then stood in the doorway between the sonar and control rooms, but did not communicate any updated sonar information to Waddle in the control room. At 13:34, sonar gained a new contact, designated S-14. Because Greeneville had not maintained a steady, slow course for a sufficient amount of time, the sonar data available to the Fire Control Technician of the Watch FTG1/SS Patrick Seacrest did not allow accurate determination on Ehime Maru's range or course.NTSB, Marine Accident Brief, USN, Report of Proceedings, p. 2, 41‚Äì42, Kyodo, \\"Testimonial immunity given to key Greeneville witness.\\" Also, due to time constraints placed by Waddle, the ship did not perform normal maneuvers which would be used to obtain accurate course and range information on the sonar contacts prior to proceeding to periscope depth.https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/MAB0501.pdf At 13:38, Greeneville reached periscope depth (about below the surface). At this time, Ehime Maru was about or away from the submarine and heading in her direction. Although sonar data began to more accurately depict Ehime Maru true range and bearing at this point, this was not evident to the sonar operators. Lieutenant, Junior Grade Michael J. Coen, the officer of the deck, conducted an initial low magnification periscope search of the area and sighted no nearby ships. Waddle then took the periscope before Coen could complete the normal high magnification search. Since waves were washing over the periscope, Waddle ordered the submarine to go up another few feet to increase the distance the periscope could view. Waddle then looked through the periscope at the area where he believed the reported surface contacts to be (possibly in error). Although Ehime Maru was at this point heading toward Greeneville's location, Waddle failed to see the ship. Regulations mandated that Waddle conduct a three-minute, 360-degree periscope scan before executing the emergency main ballast blow maneuver. Waddle, however, aware that they were still behind schedule, conducted a short scan, searching primarily in the sector where he believed the known contacts were located, noted that the haze was still present, and saw no ships in the vicinity. At the end of his scan, Waddle announced to the control room crew, \\"I hold no visual contacts.\\"Kyodo, \\"Sub captain's decisions surprised ranking officer,\\" Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 122‚Äì123, NTSB, Marine Accident Brief, USN, Report of Proceedings, p. 2, 45‚Äì54. Waddle later explained how he conducted his periscope search: Greeneville fire control console Meanwhile, Seacrest was monitoring the ship's fire control console, which graphically displayed the relative position, bearing, and speed of any sonar contacts in the area. Seacrest had been monitoring three contacts on his screens, S-12, S-13 (Ehime Maru), and S-14. Absorbed in trying to get a clearer picture on S-14's location, Seacrest failed to report the bearing and range of S-13 (Ehime Maru) to Waddle during Waddle's periscope search, which Seacrest's monitors now showed was about away and closing. During Waddle's periscope search, Seacrest was busy operating other control room instruments and did not actively monitor his fire control displays. After the periscope search was over, and hearing Waddle's report of no visual contacts, Seacrest decided that his information for S-13 was incorrect and manually respotted the S-13 contact on his screen to a distance of away.USN, Report of Proceedings, p. 47‚Äì56, NTSB, Marine Accident Brief, Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 123‚Äì124, Kyodo, \\"Waddle is denied immunity as inquiry nears end.\\" The USN inquiry report states that records show that Seacrest actually \\"respotted\\" Ehime Maru contact information 30 seconds after the collision. The discrepancy between Seacrest's testimony and the record is not explained in the report. After completing the emergency dive at about 13:40, Waddle invited two of the civilian guests, John Hall, CEO of a Texas oil company, and Jack Clary, a free-lance sports writer from Massachusetts, to operate the controls for the emergency main ballast blow. Clary sat in the helmsman's chair and Hall stood at the high-pressure air valve levers, under close supervision by Greeneville crewmen. After the two civilians had taken their positions, at 13:42:25 Waddle ordered the maneuver executed, and they threw the control levers as instructed. The submarine began its rapid ascent toward the surface.USN, Report of Proceedings, p. 57, NTSB, Marine Accident Brief, U.S. Navy Pacific Fleet Public Affairs Office Pittsburgh demonstrates an emergency main ballast blow. At 13:43:15, the rapidly ascending Greeneville surfaced directly under Ehime Maru (), and the submarine's rudder sliced Ehime Maru hull from starboard to port. The people aboard Ehime Maru heard two loud noises and felt the ship shudder from two severe impacts. Ehime Maru bridge crew looked aft and saw the submarine broach the water next to their ship. Within five seconds Ehime Maru lost power and began to sink. As Waddle watched through Greeneville's periscope, Ehime Maru stood almost vertically on its stern and sank in about five minutes as the people on the fishing ship scrambled to abandon ship.USN, Record of Proceedings, p. 8, 57‚Äì58, NTSB, Marine Accident Brief, Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 126‚Äì129, Kyodo, \\"Ehime Maru captain recounts collision, calls for a full probe.\\" Emergency response At 13:48, Greeneville radioed a distress call to COMSUBPAC at Pearl Harbor for assistance. COMSUBPAC notified the local United States Coast Guard (USCG) unit at 13:55 which began a search-and-rescue effort. The submarine maneuvered towards Ehime Maru's survivors to attempt a rescue. Weather conditions were unhelpful: 15- to 20-knot winds, which, in turn, were producing waves of 8 to 12 feet. Due to these rough seas, the submarine's main deck hatches could not be opened; the only outside access was through the top of the sail through its access trunk. Greeneville, moreover, was still low in the water because it normally took 30 minutes to pump out the remaining water in the ballast tanks after an emergency blow. As the heavy, partially submerged submarine bobbed in the ocean, it also displaced large waves that, in Waddle's opinion, threatened to capsize the life rafts in which Ehime Maru's survivors were gathering. Waddle decided that it would be safer to stand off the submarine from the group of survivors and wait for assistance to arrive. Ehime Maru's survivors, many of them struggling in the diesel fuel released from their sinking ship, were able to gather on the several life rafts that had deployed automatically as their ship sank.USN, Report of Proceedings, p. 58‚Äì6, NTSB, Marine Accident Brief, Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 130‚Äì132. A USCG helicopter arrived at 14:27, noted the survivors in the life rafts, and began searching for any survivors who might still be in the water. At 14:31 and 14:44 respectively, a USCG rigid-hulled inflatable boat and patrol boat arrived and administered first aid to the survivors in the rafts. Media helicopters also arrived during the rescue operation, and the incident was quickly reported on by major news organizations. Of the 35 people aboard Ehime Maru (20 crew members, 13 students, and 2 teachers), the USCG rescued 26 people and took them to Oahu for medical treatment. Only one of the survivors had a serious injury, a broken clavicle; he was hospitalized for five days. Nine other people were missing, including four 17-year-old high school students and the two teachers. None of the nine missing were seen by any of the survivors, Greeneville crewmembers, or USCG personnel after the ship sank. Captain ≈ånishi stated that the nine missing people were probably in the ship's galley and engine rooms when the ship sank. USCG and USN aircraft and ships searched the ocean around Ehime Maru's last location continuously for 22 days, until 2 March. Two Japanese civilian vessels also joined in the search. No remains of the nine missing people were discovered during the search.USN, Report of Proceedings, p. 68‚Äì69, NTSB, Marine Accident Brief, Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 130‚Äì132, Kyodo, \\"Surviving students arrive at Kansai airport.\\" Immediate aftermath Shortly after the incident occurred, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshir≈ç Mori was informed of the accident as he was playing golf in Japan. Acknowledging the message, Mori resumed his round of golf, ending it an hour and a half after the first message, an action for which he was later heavily criticized, owing in part to the use of stock photographs taken the previous summer showing Mori enjoying his round of golf.Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 133. Since the collision involved a commercial vessel, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) had jurisdiction to conduct the investigation into the accident. An NTSB official, along with several USN and USCG officers, questioned Waddle and Pfeifer about the incident as soon as Greeneville moored at Pearl Harbor. That same day, Admiral Konetzni removed Waddle as captain of Greeneville and reassigned him to his staff pending the outcome of the accident investigation.Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 142‚Äì145. U.S. Admiral Thomas Fargo, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet at the time of the incident Two days after the sinking, on 11 February, U.S. President George W. Bush apologized for the accident on national television, stating, \\"I want to reiterate what I said to the prime minister of Japan: I'm deeply sorry about the accident that took place; our nation is sorry.\\"Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 151‚Äì153. Secretary of State Colin Powell and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld also publicly apologized. The U.S. ambassador to Japan, Tom Foley, personally apologized to both Prime Minister Mori and to the Emperor of Japan. The public apologies to the Japanese from the highest American officials stirred resentment among some American veterans of the Pacific War and their families, as well as among Asian victims of Imperial Japanese aggression and occupation. Richard Cohen wrote a column in The Washington Post, saying \\"We've Apologized Enough to Japan\\", denounced the \\"hypocrisy\\" of Japan's recent gestures of compensation and remorse to some of Japan's World War II victims, which he said were offered \\"grudgingly\\", while noting that the U.S. had apologized profusely over the accidental collision. On 11 February, during an \\"extremely emotional exchange\\", the commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, Admiral Thomas B. Fargo, personally apologized to families of the Ehime Maru victims, who had arrived in Hawaii the day before. Several of the family members asked that Ehime Maru be raised from the ocean floor. Waddle had asked to accompany Fargo to apologize to the victims' families as well, but the COMSUBPAC public affairs office told him that he could not. The next day, the family members were taken by boat to view the accident site.Kyodo, \\"Surviving students arrive at Kansai airport,\\" Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 151‚Äì153. The perceived lack of remorse by Waddle, and reports in the Japanese media that Greeneville had made no effort to assist Ehime Maru survivors as they waited for almost one hour for rescue angered many Japanese citizens, especially the family members of the missing. One Japanese family member publicly referred to Waddle as, \\"the most terrible criminal of them all.\\"Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 163‚Äì164. Another family member, referring to Waddle said, \\"If you're a man, you should fall on your knees and ask for our pardon!\\"Kyodo, \\"Families of missing lash out at U.S. Navy,\\" In response, Waddle delivered letters of apology to the Japanese consulate in Hawaii for delivery to the victims' families during the last week of February.Kyodo, \\"Families of missing lash out at U.S. Navy,\\" Kyodo, \\"U.S. envoy apologizes to families of missing people,\\" Kyodo, \\"Sub captain's decisions surprised ranking officer,\\" Kyodo, \\"Ehime Maru captain recounts collision, calls for a full probe.\\" Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 163‚Äì164. Japanese government officials publicly expressed concern over the reports that civilians had been at Greeneville's controls during the collision. Japan's foreign minister, Y≈çhei K≈çno, complained that U.S. officials had not provided details on the civilians' involvement, stating, \\"I cannot help but say it is an extremely grave situation if it were the case that the participation of civilians in the submarine's surfacing maneuver led to the accident.\\"Kyodo, \\"U.S. to extend hunt for missing crew of ship by one day.\\" In February 2001, vice chief of naval operations Admiral William Fallon was given Presidential special envoy status and dispatched to Japan to apologize for the collision. Fallon, along with Ambassador Tom Foley, met with family members of the victims at the Ambassador's official residence in Tokyo and in the Ehime Maru's home port of Uwajima, Ehime Prefecture, bowing deeply and expressing regret on behalf of the United States and President George W. Bush. His deferential show of contrition to the families, carried out in front of news cameras, was widely credited with defusing a situation that had the potential to damage US-Japan relations. Damage to Greeneville Greeneville in drydock at Pearl Harbor on 21 February 2001Greeneville suffered some damage in the collision. Beginning at the mark on the submarine's rudder, surface tiles had been sheared off, exposing bare metal, and there were several dents on the rudder's leading edge, one of which had punctured the metal skin. A section of acoustic hull surface treatment tiles below the sail had also been sheared off. Greeneville was repaired in a drydock at Pearl Harbor at a cost of US$2 million. After the repairs were completed on 18 April 2002, the submarine returned to operational status.Gittler, \\"Navy treads carefully after Greeneville\\". Court of inquiry convenes In addition to the NTSB investigation, the USN also initiated their own investigation on 10 February. USN Admiral Charles Griffiths was assigned to direct the investigation. Griffiths' team completed a preliminary inquiry report and submitted it to Admiral Fargo on 16 February. The following day, Fargo announced that the USN would convene a court of inquiry, the USN's highest form of administrative hearing.Kyodo, \\"U.S. to launch formal inquiry into fatal submarine accident,\\" USN, Record of Proceedings, p.1, Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 155‚Äì157. A USN court of inquiry is similar to a grand jury investigation in civil court. The court has subpoena power and provides legal safeguards for the affected parties, such as the right to be represented by counsel. The court is a military investigative process and as such has no judge. Instead, a panel of three admirals make up the court and make a report based on the evidence presented in the inquiry. Testimony and other evidence presented in the court can later be used in court-martial proceedings.Kyodo, \\"U.S. to launch formal inquiry into fatal submarine accident,\\" Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 157. USN Admiral (then Vice Admiral) John B. Nathman, who chaired the court of inquiry into the Ehime Maru accident The inquiry panel into the accident consisted of Vice Admiral John B. Nathman and Rear Admirals Paul F. Sullivan and David M. Stone. At Fargo's invitation the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) sent Rear Admiral Isamu Ozawa to participate in the inquiry as a non-voting adviser. The three named \\"affected\\" parties of the inquiry were Waddle, Pfeifer, and Coen, who were present in the hearing room throughout the inquiry.Kyodo, \\"Investigation of sub accident stalled,\\" USN, Report of Proceedings, p. 2, Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 157‚Äì158, 176. Commander Mark Patton, a classmate of Waddle at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. 20 years ago, was quoted as saying \\"The general opinion on the waterfront was that it was important that he stand up and take responsibility. We wanted to see that happen. It was important for the public to see that happen. And he did that very well.\\" The court of inquiry began on 5 March 2001. Representing Waddle as counsel was Charles Gittins, who arrived in Hawaii on 4 March. Family members of the Ehime Maru victims were seated directly behind Waddle in the hearing room and throughout the inquiry frequently reacted very emotionally and vocally to evidence presented during the hearings.Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 174‚Äì180. The court called numerous witnesses, including Griffiths, Brandhuber, and ≈ånishi. ≈ånishi testified that large waves swept him overboard and far from his sinking ship, preventing him from assisting the rest of Ehime Maru crew as they clung to the sinking ship. Afterwards, Waddle approached ≈ånishi and apologized for the accident.Kyodo, \\"Guests, failure of display cited at start of Greeneville inquiry,\\" Kyodo, \\"Sub captain's decisions surprised ranking officer,\\" Kyodo, \\"Ehime Maru captain recounts collision, calls for a full probe.\\" Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 180‚Äì182. Waddle also apologized to several groups of Ehime Maru family members on 8 and 16 March. One of them, Naoko Nakata, wife of one of the missing crewmembers, asked Waddle to \\"please tell the truth in court.\\"Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 180‚Äì182. Shortly thereafter, Waddle also apologized again during an interview with a Japanese television network.Kyodo, \\"Ehime school groups petition U.S. Embassy to raise ship,\\" Kyodo, \\"Ehime Maru captain recounts collision, calls for a full probe.\\" Kyodo, \\"Testimonial immunity given to key Greeneville witness,\\" Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 180‚Äì182. Rear Admiral Albert H. Konetzni testified during the inquiry that Waddle and his crew had rushed into Greeneville's final maneuvers without taking enough time to ensure that no other vessels were in the vicinity. In a statement that was widely reported in the media, Konetzni looked at Waddle and said, \\"I'd like to go over there and punch him for not taking more time.\\"Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 184‚Äì185. Seacrest was given testimonial immunity in exchange for his testimony. Pfeifer and Coen submitted unsworn statements to the court and, therefore, did not have to face cross-examination.Kyodo, \\"Waddle is denied immunity as inquiry nears end.\\" Seacrest's immunity apparently meant only that his testimony in the inquiry could not be used as evidence in any subsequent disciplinary action. Waddle requested immunity in exchange for his offer to testify, but Fargo denied the request, stating that Waddle's testimony was not \\"essential\\" in determining the facts of the case. In spite of the denial of immunity, Waddle elected to testify for the court. Waddle stated later that he felt he needed to testify because he had promised some of the Ehime Maru family members that he would do so, he had heard that Greeneville crew expected him to, and he wanted to get his side of the story into the record.Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 190‚Äì204. Diagram of Greeneville control room shows the locations of the 32 people in the room at the time of the emergency ballast blow maneuver. The darker marks represent the locations of the DV civilians. After hearing testimony from 31 witnesses, the court completed its hearings on 20 March. None of the civilian DVs were asked to testify. The inquiry report was submitted to Fargo on 20 April.Kyodo, \\"U.S. naval inquiry reveals inadequate search,\\" Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 205 and 210. Findings of the court The court made several findings, including that Waddle failed to take positive action in response to the non-availability of the AVSDU, nine of the 13 watchstations in and around the control room were manned by substitute personnel, and that one of the sonar operators was unqualified to stand watch.USN, Report of Proceedings, p. 4, 17, 21‚Äì22, 69‚Äì80, 92‚Äì97, 102‚Äì112. The court also issued numerous opinions, including that the accident was caused by \\"a series and combination of individual negligence(s) onboard Greeneville,\\" \\"artificial urgency\\" by Waddle to rush the submarine through its demonstration schedule as it began to run late, failure to follow standard procedures, the abbreviated periscope search, distractions and obstruction caused by the presence of the civilian guests, crew training deficiencies, overconfidence and complacency, and Waddle's not paying enough attention to ship contact information. The court found that, although Brandhuber was the senior officer present on Greeneville, Waddle as captain was solely responsible for the safe navigation of the submarine. The inquiry report went into great detail on the purpose and rules surrounding the USN's DVE program.USN, Report of Proceedings, p. 4, 17, 21‚Äì22, 69‚Äì80, 92‚Äì97, 102‚Äì112, Kyodo, \\"U.S. naval inquiry reveals inadequate search,\\" Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 205 and 210. The court recommended against court-martial for the officers involved because of an absence of any \\"criminal intent or deliberate misconduct.\\" Instead, the court recommended non-judicial punishment for Waddle and Seacrest and administrative action for Brandhuber, Pfeifer, Coen, Greeneville's chief of the boat MMCM/SS Douglas Coffman, and sonar supervisor STS1/SS Edward McGiboney. The court recommended that the USN DVE program continue.USN, Report of Proceedings, p. 69‚Äì80, 92‚Äì97, 116‚Äì119. Relatives of Ehime Maru crewmembers were angry that none of the USN personnel involved would face court-martial and that Waddle could remain in the USN and would retain his retirement pension. Ryosuke Terata, father of one of the missing students, said with regard to Waddle, \\"If (he were) in Japan, he would be fired and indicted on charges such as professional negligence resulting in death.\\"Kyodo, \\"Relatives oppose inquiry recommendations,\\" Kyodo, \\"Relatives criticize navy ruling,\\" Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 217‚Äì218. On 23 April, Waddle received an admiral's mast (a form of USN non-judicial punishment) from Fargo at the USN Pacific Fleet headquarters in Pearl Harbor. Fargo pronounced Waddle guilty of dereliction of duty and improper hazarding of a vessel. He fined Waddle a half-month's pay for two months (fine delayed for six months, and waived after the six months with good behavior), gave him a verbal reprimand, and \\"made clear that [Waddle's] resignation was expected.\\"Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 213‚Äì216 and 234‚Äì235. Coen also received an admiral's mast in which he was \\"counseled for failing to execute his duties to ensure the safe navigation of the ship and to properly supervise watch personnel in the control room.\\" Seacrest was admonished at a captain's mast, and Brandhuber, Pfeifer, Coffman, and McGiboney received formal administrative admonishments. The masts and administrative admonishments were documented and placed in the servicemembers' military records, perhaps affecting their future chances for promotions and assignments. Waddle, who had been working at a Navy desk job since being relieved of command, formally retired from the USN on 1 October 2001.Waddle, The Right Thing, p. 213‚Äì216 and 234‚Äì235, NTSB, Marine Accident Brief. Waddle did receive interviews from several private corporations who \\"put more value in the way Waddle handled himself during the grueling, 12-day court of inquiry than they did in any sort of blame for the collision.\\". After 10 months of unemployment, Waddle worked as a project manager for an energy firm in North Carolina and, in July 2004, started his own business as a consultant, executive coach, and public speaker.Kyodo News, \\"Anniversary of Ehime Maru sinking prompts remorse\\", Japan Times, 10 February 2011, p. 2. After 10 months of unemployment, Waddle worked as a project manager for an energy firm in North Carolina and, in July 2004, started his own business as a consultant, executive coach, and public speaker. Salvage and recovery On 16 February 2001, the USN Supervisor of Salvage and Diving (SUPSALV) and Submarine Development Squadron 5 (SUBDEVRON 5), using the Scorpio remotely piloted underwater vehicle (ROV), located Ehime Maru in 2,000 feet (610 m) of water on the ocean bottom (). Over the next two weeks, the USN used the Scorpio and the Deep Drone ROVs to search the ocean bottom around Ehime Maru for the remains of any of her missing crewmembers, without success.Kyodo, \\"U.S. to launch formal inquiry into fatal submarine accident,\\" Kyodo, \\"Investigation of sub accident stalled,\\" NTSB, Marine Accident Brief, U.S. Pacific Fleet Public Affairs, \\"Scorpio II finds Ehime Maru\\". Divers inspect the wreckage of Ehime Maru off Oahu, 5 November 2001 After assessing the technical feasibility and environmental impact of raising Ehime Maru from the ocean bottom, the U.S. government, in June 2001, decided to proceed with recovering the ship from the ocean floor. The USN contracted the Dutch company Smit InternationalSmit website on salvage project Ehime Maru, visited 12 February 2012 and Crowley Maritime Corp., headquartered in Washington state, to salvage the wreck of Ehime Maru. After consultation between the contractors, representatives from the Japanese government, and U.S. government officials, the decision was made not to raise Ehime Maru all the way to the surface but to lift and carry it underwater to shallow water near Oahu. Once there, divers could enter the ship. The operation would be the first to lift something of that size from such a depth. USN Rear Admiral William Klemm directed the recovery operation.Kyodo, \\"Ehime school groups petition U.S. Embassy to raise ship,\\" NTSB, Marine Accident Brief, U.S. Pacific Fleet Public Affairs, \\"Environmental Assessment update\\" and Using the Phoenix III ROV, contractors, beginning on 20 July 2001, first removed Ehime Maru mast and other items on the ship's decks that could interfere with the lifting operation. Assisted by technical experts from Japan, including one from the company that built Ehime Maru, the Rockwater II contract diving support vessel prepared the ship for lifting beginning the first week of August. After some difficulty, Ehime Maru was lifted off the ocean floor by Rockwater II on 5 October and slowly moved to a location closer to shore. On 14 October the wreck was set down in 115 ft (35 m) of water one statute mile (1.6 km) south of Honolulu International Airport's reef runway.U.S. Pacific Fleet Public Affairs, \\"Recovery operation press conference\\", \\"Rockwater 2 Fact Sheet\\", \\"Japanese experts to assist in Ehime Maru recovery\\", \\"Stern lift update :: 8/31\\", \\"Navy divers enter water, begin initial survey of Ehime Maru‚Äôs exterior\\", Kyodo, \\"Ship salvage to continue despite problems\\", \\"Ehime Maru moved to shallows\\". On 15 October, the first team of USN divers from Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit ONE (MDSU-1) began assessing the sunken vessel. Working in low- to zero-visibility conditions, 66 MDSU-1 and 30 Japanese JMSDF divers from the submarine rescue ship JS Chihaya conducted 526 dives over 29 days, searching the wreck. ≈ånishi, relatives of some of the missing crewmembers, and several Japanese government officials observed the operation from the dive support ships. The divers recovered the bodies of eight of the nine missing people (three crewmembers, four students, and the two teachers), many personal effects, and several items unique to the ship, such as its nameplate, bell, anchors, and helm.Kyodo, \\"Ehime school groups petition U.S. Embassy to raise ship,\\" NTSB, Marine Accident Brief, U.S. Pacific Fleet Public Affairs, \\"Mast removal begins today\\", \\"Navy divers enter water, begin initial survey of Ehime Maru exterior\\", \\"Divers locate, recover eighth set of remains\\", \\"Ehime Maru successfully moved to final relocation site\\", Kyodo, \\"Ehime Maru moved to shallows\\", \\"First Ehime Maru corpse identified; two more found\\". The victim whose body was not recovered was 17-year-old Takeshi Mizuguchi (Kyodo News, \\"Prayers mark loss of nine in sub-ship crash \\", Japan Times, 11 February 2009, p. 2.) Relatives of Ehime Maru crewmembers participate in a final ceremony for the ship aboard the JS Chihaya on 25 November 2001.After the recovery was complete, on 25 November, Ehime Maru was lifted, towed back out to sea suspended about below the towing barge, and scuttled in of water south of Barbers Point. The event was witnessed by three of Ehime Maru victims' families on board Chihaya. The total cost of the salvage operations was about $60 million.NTSB, Marine Accident Brief, U.S. Pacific Fleet Public Affairs, \\"Navy begins final Ehime Maru relocation\\", \\"Ehime Maru successfully moved to final relocation site\\". Compensation On 10 April 2002, the USN signed an agreement to pay the Ehime Prefectural Government US$11.47 million in compensation for the sinking of Ehime Maru. Some $8.87 million was to help pay to replace the ship, and the remainder was to pay for counseling and financial aid for the survivors as well as to pay for a memorial ceremony for the victims.Kyodo, \\"Navy agrees to pay Ehime $11.5 million\\" On 14 November 2002, the USN agreed to pay $13.9 million in compensation to 33 of the 35 families of victims or injured survivors. The remaining two families accepted a $2.6 million settlement from the USN on 31 January 2003. Before accepting the settlement, the two families had asked for face-to-face apologies from the USN and Waddle, a full investigation into the collision, a reasonable compensation offer, and a promise from the USN to help prevent similar accidents in the future.Gittler, \\"Last two Ehime Maru families OK settlement\\". Masumi Terata, whose teenage son Yusuke died in the accident, said that she was happy that the settlement was behind them, but added that, \\"My true feeling is that if possible, I want to see my son one more time.\\"Kyodo, \\"Waddle visits Ehime memorial\\", Tyler, \\"Former USS Greeneville skipper places wreath at Ehime Maru memorial\\", Gittler, \\"Last two Ehime Maru families OK settlement\\". Waddle's trip to Japan On 14 December 2002, Waddle, accompanied by Charles Gittins, traveled to Japan to apologize personally to the victims' families. On 15 December, Waddle visited the Ehime Maru memorial at Uwajima Fisheries High School and placed a wreath of white lilies before a monument to the dead, bowed in silence and then read the victims' names aloud. No local officials were present during Waddle's visit, citing statements from some victims' families that they did not want Waddle to visit. Later that day, Waddle met with some of the families of the victims and with some of the survivors. The next day, in Tokyo, Waddle met with Masumi Terata. Speaking of her meeting with Waddle, Terata stated, \\"I am first and foremost the family member of a victim and Mr. Waddle is first and foremost a victimizer. But when I saw Mr. Waddle as a person who was crying and apologizing, I thought he was apologizing from the heart.\\"Kyodo, \\"Waddle visits Ehime memorial\\", Tyler, \\"Former USS Greeneville skipper places wreath at Ehime Maru memorial\\", Giordono, \\"Family of Ehime Maru victim to settle suit\\". In a press conference on 17 December, Gittins criticized the USN for their continued insistence that Waddle not come to Japan to visit the victims' families. Said Gittins, \\"For the life of me, I cannot understand why the Navy did not want Scott to come meet with the families and do what is morally right and what is understood in Japanese culture to be the right thing to do.\\" Gittins added that he had received emails from the USN as recently as the week before urging Waddle not to make the trip. Gittins stated that the reason that it took two years for Waddle to make the trip to Japan was because Waddle was forbidden to do so while he was still in the USN and because of financial constraints and fear of litigation after his retirement.Giordono, \\"Lawyer blames military for delay of Waddle's visit to Ehime Maru families\\" Effect on Japanese‚ÄìAmerican relations After the sinking of Ehime Maru, many Japanese, including government officials, questioned why civilians were allowed in Greeneville control room during maneuvers that could place other, uninvolved, vessels at risk. Also, the Japanese expressed concern that the United States Navy did not immediately take full responsibility for the accident, appeared at first to try to conceal information about the DVE program, and did not court martial Waddle or have him personally apologize immediately after the accident.Johnson, Chalmers, \\"Three Rapes: The Status of Forces Agreement and Okinawa\\", Maeda, Tetsuo, \\"The Unbelievable \\"Lightness\\" of the US-Japan Alliance\\", Allen, David, \\"Ehime Maru families want probe of civilian passenger program\\", Japan Times, The, A belated but welcome apology. The subsequent effort by the U.S. government to retrieve the victims' remains from the sunken wreck, numerous apologies from U.S. government representatives and Waddle, and the compensation paid to the Ehime government and to the victims' families appear to have assuaged much of the anger directed toward the U.S. government and military. Many Japanese, both government and private citizens, however, continue to call for the U.S. government to make more effort to reduce or eliminate serious accidents and crimes involving U.S. military personnel.Associated Press, \\"Ehime Maru victims honored\\" Although the United States and Japan have been strong allies since the end of World War II, the accident involving Ehime Maru showed that the relationship is not always completely harmonious, especially with regard to incidents in which U.S. military personnel or assets injure or kill Japanese citizens or damage their property. In response to crimes committed by U.S. servicemembers against Japanese citizens, such as the 1995 Okinawan rape incident, Japanese citizens and some Japanese government officials have questioned the equality of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan and the issue of responsibility and accountability by the U.S. government concerning the actions of its military members in Japan. In addition, the Japanese have questioned the U.S. commitment to safe operations of its military assets in light of several accidents, including aircraft crashes and other ship collisions that have injured or killed Japanese citizens.Johnson, Chalmers, \\"Three Rapes: The Status of Forces Agreement and Okinawa\\", Maeda, Tetsuo, \\"The Unbelievable \\"Lightness\\" of the US-Japan Alliance.\\" Later events The Ehime Maru memorial located in Kakaako Waterfront Park near Honolulu, Hawaii Acting on a request from the Japanese government, the state of Hawaii established a non-profit group, the Ehime Maru Memorial Association, on 11 November 2001, to coordinate the activities of placing an Ehime Maru memorial at a site in Hawaii. The monument to the ship was completed on 9 February 2002, at Kakaako Waterfront Park near Honolulu. Each year since the accident, memorial ceremonies have been held on 9 February at Uwajima Fisheries High School in Ehime and at the Ehime Maru monument in Hawaii.Japan- America Society of Hawaii, Ehime Maru Memorial Association, Kyodo, \\"School marks date of ship's sinking\\", \\"Dual memorials held for Ehime Maru\\", Tyler, Greg, \\"Uwajima school remembers Ehime Maru\\", Kyodo News, \\"Prayers mark loss of nine in sub-ship crash \\", Japan Times, 11 February 2009, p. 2; Kyodo News, \\"Ninth anniversary of training boat's fatal sub collision marked \\", Japan Times, 11 February 2010, p. 2.Song, Jaymes (Associated Press), \\"Families remember 9 killed in submarine collision\\", Seattle Times, 9 February 2011, retrieved 10 February 2011.Associated Press, \\"Ehime Maru victims honored \\", Japan Times, 11 February 2011, p. 2.Kyodo News, \\"Ehime Maru tragedy marked\\", Japan Times, 12 February 2012, p. 2. Shipbuilders in Imabari, Ehime Prefecture, began construction on a new Ehime Maru on 17 April 2002. Upon completion, the new ship sailed to Hawaii, arriving on 17 June 2003. In a ceremony at the Ehime Maru monument, the principal of Uwajima Fishery at the time of the disaster, Kazumitsu Joko (‰∏äÁî≤‰∏ÄÂÖâ J≈çk≈ç Kazumitsu), read a message from Moriyuki Kato, the governor of Ehime Prefecture, addressed to the Hawaiian people. The message stated, in part, \\"Since the Ehime Maru tragic accident two years ago, the people of Hawaii have shown compassion and warm support.\\"Kyodo, \\"Work starts on Ehime Marus replacement\\", Kakesako, Tender Thoughts. The NTSB released its report on the accident on 19 October 2005. The NTSB report largely confirmed the USN's inquiry findings, including that Waddle was primarily responsible for the collision. The NTSB report, however, was more critical of the distractions caused by the DV civilians on Greeneville that contributed to the accident. The report concluded that the USN had recognized the \\"detrimental operating conditions\\" aboard Greeneville and had taken \\"additional measures to address the safety of operations\\" on submarines, including additional restrictions on DVE visitors.Tyler, Greg, \\"Former USS Greeneville commander blamed for collision with fishing boat\\", NTSB, Marine Accident Brief.

New Zealand was one of the first (of a total of sixteen) nations to respond with support. Naval forces On 29 June 1950, just four days after 135,000 North Korean troops crossed the 38th parallel in Korea, the New Zealand government ordered two Loch class frigates of the Royal New Zealand Navy ‚Äì and ‚Äì to prepare to make for Korean waters, and for the whole of the war, at least two NZ vessels would be on station in the theater.Korean Scholarships ‚Äì Navy Today, Defence Public Relations Unit, Issue 133, 8 June, pp. 14‚Äì15 On 3 July, these two first ships left Devonport Naval Base, Auckland and joined other Commonwealth forces at Sasebo, Japan, on 2 August. These vessels served under the command of a British flag officer (seemingly Flag Officer, Second-in-Command, Far East Fleet)Coalition Air Warfare in the Korean War, 1950‚Äì1953: Proceedings, Air Force Historical Foundation Symposium, Andrews AFB, Maryland, May 7‚Äì8, 2002, 142 onwards and formed part of the US Navy screening force during the Battle of Inchon, performing shore raids and inland bombardment. Further RNZN Loch class frigates joined these later ‚Äì , , and , as well as a number of smaller craft. Only one RNZN sailor, Able Seaman R.E. Marchioni, was killed throughout the conflict; during a raid on Sogon-ni on 26 August 1951 with HMNZS Rotoiti. Ground forces After some debate, on 26 July 1950, the Government of New Zealand announced it would raise a volunteer military force to serve with UN forces in Korea. The idea was opposed initially by the Chief of the General Staff, Major General Keith Stewart, who did not believe the force would be large enough to be self- sufficient. His opposition was ignored and the government raised what was known as Kayforce, a total of 1,044 men selected from among volunteers. 16th Field Regiment, Royal New Zealand Artillery and support elements arrived later during the conflict from New Zealand. The force arrived at Pusan on New Year's Eve and on 21 January joined the British 27th Infantry Brigade. The New Zealanders immediately saw combat and spent the next two and a half years taking part in the operations (most notably the Battle of Kapyong and the First Battle of Maryang San) which led the United Nations forces back to and over the 38th Parallel (with the NZ naval vessels being especially active in the inner Han River estuary), later recapturing Seoul in the process. Although overshadowed by 16 Field Regiment RNZA's contribution to the 1950‚Äì54 Korean War, New Zealand also contributed 10 Company, RNZASC as part of Kayforce. They totalled 408 personnel of all ranks and would serve with distinction in Korea from 1951 until 1956 as part of the 1st Commonwealth Division. Following the armistice, RNZN deployments continued, together with Army support elements until 1957 as Kayforce was gradually reduced in size. The majority of Kayforce had returned to New Zealand by 1955, though it was not until 1957 that the last New Zealand soldiers had left Korea. A single New Zealand military liaison officer on the Commonwealth Liaison Mission, Korea, remained in the country until 1971. A total of 3,794 New Zealand soldiers served in Kayforce and 1,300 in the RNZN deployment. Thirty-three were killed in action and many were eventually buried at the United Nations Memorial Cemetery in Busan, South Korea.Interred at UNMCK Other casualties included 79 wounded and 1 taken prisoner. The prisoner, from Cambridge, Waikato, was held in North Korea for eighteen months and repatriated after the armistices. A New Zealander flying with the Royal Australian Air Force was also captured when he was shot down near P'yongyang, and was repatriated at around the same time. Air forces No Royal New Zealand Air Force units were sent to Korea, but a number of New Zealanders flew with other air forces in the conflict. Two men flew Gloster Meteor jets with No. 77 Squadron RAAF; one was shot down and captured. A New Zealand Army artillery lieutenant was attached to a USAF tactical control unit as an observer in light aircraft. New Zealand born Alan Boxer, later a British air marshal, flew B-29 Superfortress missions on USAF attachment.

Based on the UNDP 2007 Top 200 largest firms in Vietnam report, it was also the 15th largest company in Vietnam and formerly the most valuable public company listed in Vietnam.https://e.theleader.vn/top-10-giants-in-vietnam-stock- exchange-20170823164608368.htm In 2010, it is the first company in Vietnam to be included in the Forbes Asia's 200 Best Under A Billion list that highlights 200 top-performing small- and mid-sized companies with annual revenue under US$1 billion. The company was established in 1976 as the state-owned Southern Coffee-Dairy Company, to nationalize and take over the operations of three previously private dairy factories in South Vietnam: Th·ªëng Nh·∫•t (belonging to a Chinese company), Tr∆∞·ªùng Th·ªç (formerly owned by Friesland Foods, best known for its production of condensed milk that was widely distributed across the South) and Dielac (Nestl√©). It was renamed United Enterprises of Milk Coffee Cookies and Candies in 1978. It became the Vietnam Dairy Company, formally established in 1993. In 2003, following its IPO to the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange, the company legally changed its name to Vietnam Dairy Products Joint Stock Company (Vinamilk). The principal activities of the Vinamilk are to produce and distribute condensed milk, powdered milk, fresh milk, soya milk, yogurts, ice-cream, cheese, fruit juice, coffee and other products derived from milk. Vinamilk products such as powdered milk and condensed milk are also exported to the Middle East, Cambodia, the Philippines and Australia. Exports accounted for $180m in 2012. Vinamilk's main competitors are Dutch Lady Vietnam (a division of Friesland Foods), Nestl√© Vietnam, Abbott, Mead Johnson, Friso and Nutifood.

The village is situated on the River Suir. It is located between the towns of Cashel and Tipperary on the N74 road. In older times the village was known as Goldenbridge. It is also a parish in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly, and is in the historical barony of Clanwilliam. History The bridge at Golden, which straddles an island in the River Suir, was the scene of an event of some significance in 1690, when King William III renewed, by letter in his own hand, the Royal Charter of the city of Cashel as an act of gratitude to the people of Cashel for the hospitality received by his followers following their attack on Limerick. There is a medieval castle on the island, currently in a ruinous state. Located in the castle ruins is a memorial sculptured bust of Thomas MacDonagh (1878‚Äì1916), Tipperary-born poet and leader of the Easter Rising in 1916. Medieval castle on island in the River Suir The Augustinian Athassel Priory is located south of the village. The abbey was founded by William FitzAdelm de Burgo (William de Burgh) in the last decades of the 12th century. It was once the largest abbey in Ireland and was surrounded by a small town named Athassel which was burned twice, in 1319 by Lord Maurice Fitzthomas and in 1419 by Bryan O'Brien. No fragment of the settlement survives today, though an aerial survey exposes to view, a faint tracery of old foundations close to the Abbey ruin. Perhaps Golden's most famous son was Father Theobold Mathew, OFM (Cap), who was born at Thomastown Castle, close to Golden on 10 October 1790, though it is sometimes claimed that Rathclogheen House, close to the Castle was the place of his birth ‚Äì that residence being part of the extensive family estate of the Mathew family, Earls Landaff. Father Mathew was the best known Irish temperance reformer and founded the Abstinence Society in 1838 and became widely known as the \\"Apostle of Temperance\\". To mark the centenary of the foundation of the Society, a statue in his honour was raised at Thomastown Cross in 1938 and is a very visible landmark on the N74 road, west of Golden. One time Cashel Mayor Sir John Judkin-FitzGerald 2nd Bt of Lisheen, & High Sheriff of Tipperary [as was his father, Col Sir Thomas Judkin-FitzGerald (Uniacke) 1st Bt of Lisheen before him during the 1798 United Rebellion] lived at Golden where his 2nd wife Lady Geraldine FitzGerald d/o Preston FitzGerald of Dublin and niece of Major General William Pringle (of 1812 Napoleonic Wars Salamanca Battle) died of infection some days after giving birth to their only child and daughter Geraldine Caroline in 1839. Modern village Main Street, Golden The village is located in the ancient parish of Relickmurry and is in the modern parish of Golden & Kilfeacle. The village contains a church and a sportsfield, home to the local club of the Gaelic Athletic Association, Golden-Kilfeacle, once called the Golden Fontenoys. The club's facilities include an indoor hall and floodlighting. There are two hamlets close by at Kilfeacle and Thomastown, the latter being an estate village which co-existed with the demesne of Thomastown Castle, home of the Mathew family, Earls of Llandaff. The valley of the Suir is fertile agricultural terrain and is part of an area known as the \\"Golden Vale\\", known for the richness of the sub-soil which has a limestone base, making it suitable for the raising of livestock. In 2016, the village had a population of 267. The N74 connects Golden with Tipperary Town and Cashel, while the L3121 links it with nearby New Inn. The village is home to a number of local businesses including an agricultural museum, a dog cafe, butchers, a supermarket and several public houses.

The plot is a mixture of comic and dramatic elements and concerns the reactions of a number of World War II veterans to the contemporary US Army. The title is derived from an American antiwar slogan from the hippie subculture during the Vietnam War era, popularized by Charlotte E. Keyes in her 1966 article for McCall's magazine titled \\"Suppose They Gave a War and No One Came\\".Allan, Kenneth. (2006). Contemporary Social and Sociological Theory: Visualizing Social Worlds. Pine Forge Press: Thousand Oaks, California. pgs 348-349 Plot Col. Flanders commands a U.S. Army base in the South. To improve relations with the locals, he decides to throw a community dance. He gives the assignment to Warrant Officer Michael M. Nace, sergeants Shannon Gambroni and Jones, and a captain, Myerson. A bigot named Billy Joe Davis is a big man in town, backed by Harve, a redneck sheriff. Harve considers a pretty barfly, Ramona, to be his girl, so when he catches Gambroni and her together, he has the sergeant placed under arrest for lewd conduct in public. Nace is drunk and of no help. Jones, who is black, is refused a loan by Mr. Kruft, a banker in town, so in anger he decides to spring Gambroni from jail. Billy Joe retaliates by calling in his armed militia, so Nace steals a tank from the base and fights back. Harve takes three of the soldiers as his prisoners. Nace and Jones (in the tank) manage to arrive at the town, where they wreak havoc by running over the stone statue of a Confederate war hero and ram-crash into the local jail, enabling Gambroni to break out. By the time the dust settles, Col. Flanders and his men have arrived in town to save the day. The town mayor fires the sheriff for abuse of authority and the military men pledge to repair the damage caused by the tank.

Bisiach‚Äôs work contributed to the rebirth of violin making in the region after the difficult times of World War I and World War II. After working with his father Leandro in Milan and then Siena, Carlo established himself at Florence in 1922. The most talented of Leandro‚Äôs sons, Carlo went on to develop his own style quite separate from the Antoniazzi- derived work of his father and brothers. Biography Carlo Bisiach was born in Milan on 9 March 1892 and died on 23 April 1968. The son and student of Leandro Bisiach, descendant of the Cremonese school, he began studying the art of stringed-instrument making in the early years of his life. In 1922, after marrying Daria Guidi in Sienna, he moved to Florence. They first lived in via della Spada; later they moved to via San Zanobi, and in 1929 to via Puccinotti. Here Bisiach lived for the rest of his life. As a young man, Carlo studied cello with Giovanni Buti and for a time seriously considered a career as a performer. At the outbreak of World War I, lived most of that time abroad (away from Italy). It is during this time that he studied the art of bowmaking in the Paris workshop of Eugene Sartory, working side by side with Andre Vigneron (1881‚Äì1924) who was to become one of the outstanding bowmakers of his time. His instruments, though few in number, are constructed of top quality material and have perfect sound. After completing the construction of the instrument, he would leave it for up to two years before going on to the varnishing. This precision made him famous worldwide. He is particularly well known for the quality of his varnish and the technique used to apply it onto the instruments. \\"Unlike many modern makers, Carlo did not attempt to develop his own model. He was convinced that the classical masters of the 17th & 18th centuries had brought the violin to the peak of its formal and sonorous beauty and he was content to emulate them in so far as it was possible for him to do so. Among the makers whose works he copied were of course Stradivari, often the early Strad Amatise types, Guarneri Del Gesu, G.B. Guadagnini, Januarius Gagliano, Mantegazza, Tommaso Balestrieri, Andrea Guarneri, Pietro Guarneri of Mantua, Camillo Camilli as well as Gabrielli. But the model he admired most, both for its designing and tonal characteristics was that of Pietro Guarneri.\\"The Strad - June 1973: p.70-79. Mell, Albert Carlo Bisiach (1892 - 1968) According to top experts, he is considered the best of the Bisiach family. Among his awards is a Gold Medal at XIII Exhibition, Padua. Represented with four violins at the prestigious exhibition-competition of modern violin making held in Cremona in 1937 on the occasion of Stradivari's bicentenary, in 1949 he won the diploma of honour at the exhibitions mounted at The Hague and in Cremona. Subsequently he received numerous other prizes and recognitions. His instruments are distinguished by the care taken in the selection of wood and their elegance of form. \\"A number of his instruments were made of maple cut from near the root of the tree. Wood from this area is often unpredictable in its marking and occasionally has a unique figure of extraordinary beauty.\\"The Strad - July 1973: p.70-79. Mell, Albert Carlo Bisiach (1892 - 1968) Many distinguished artists owned Carlo Bisiach‚Äôs instruments including Louis Kaufman (legendary American violin virtuoso), Franz von Vecsey, Edward Karkar, Maestro Saito of the Quartet of Tokyo and Dominique Pereira, concert violinist living in Bombay, India owned an Amatise Strad model circa 1923 then ordered a Guadagnini model as well.

Kass \\"Carlo Bisiach did not (like most modern violin makers) try to, develop his own designs. He was convinced that the masters of the classic Cremonese school of the XVII and XVIII centuries had reached the height of perfection, in terms of elegance of form and fullness and softness of sound. He chose to be inspired by the masters, principally by Stradivarius during his ¬´Amatise¬ª period, but also by Guarnieri del Gesu, G.B. Guadagnini, and Gennaro Gagliano. However his preferred model was that of Pietro Guarnieri of Mantua. \\" - Pardo Fornaciari \\"Dario II Vettori - for the construction of his instruments he uses the moulds and models from his family‚Äôs workshop, most of them originally belonging to Carlo Bisiach‚Äôs collection, once owned by Igino Sderci.

He studied medicine in Marseille and Paris, where he studied with Charles Emile Troisier (1844-1919), √âdouard Brissaud (1852-1909), Henri-Alexandre Danlos (1844-1912), Fulgence Raymond (1844-1910) and Georges-Fernand-Isidore Widal (1862-1929). With Widal he performed serodiagnostic studies in immunology. In 1899 he obtained his medical doctorate, and in 1910 was appointed chef de service at the H√¥pital Necker. In 1923 he became a professor of internal pathology. With Jacques Forestier (1890-1978), he introduced lipiodol (radio-opaque iodized poppyseed oil) for use in radiological investigations. Lipiodol was injected into a patients' cerebrospinal fluid for myelographic diagnosis and localization of intraspinal cysts and tumors. Sicard is also credited for introducing injections of sodium salicylate for treatment of varicose veins,Sicard's method II @ Who Named It as well as alcohol injections for relief of trigeminal neuralgia. In addition, he was one of the first physicians to become interested in the possibilities of a procedure known as pneumoencephalography.Department of Neurology, The University of Illinois at Chicago (biography) Along with Fr√©d√©ric Justin Collet (1870-1966), Sicard is credited with identifying Collet-Sicard syndrome, a disorder in which neck trauma such as a Jefferson fracture causes damage to the cranial nerves.

League C) is the fifth and bottom division of Israeli Football League, a position it has held since 2009. From Liga Alef and downwards to this, each league is separated by region as well. History Liga Gimel was first established in 1951 as a third division, below Liga Alef and Liga Bet. In 1955, after designating the first tier as Liga Leumit, Liga Gimel was demoted to the fourth tier. Further demotions followed in 1976, after the second tier Liga Artzit to the fifth tier and in 1999, after the establishment of Liga Ha'Al to the sixth tier. At the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season, Liga Artzit was scrapped and Liga Gimel was brought up back to the fifth tier. Since its establishment Liga Gimel was divided into geographical divisions, to lower operating costs for the clubs, the number of which changed according to the number of club which registered, with as many as 16 divisions in the 1966‚Äì68 season. During this period promotion to Liga Bet alternated between direct promotion and through promotion play-offs, which were used to set eight teams for promotion. Following the establishment of Liga Dalet, in 1969, Liga Gimel were divided into 8 divisions, from which one team was promoted directly to Liga Bet and one relegated to Liga Dalet. After the dissolution of Liga Dalet, in 1985, and until the end of the 2001‚Äì02 season, the league was divided into 12 divisions, with promotion playoffs. Although currently Liga Gimel is the bottom tier in the Israeli league pyramid, from 1969‚Äì70Liga Dalet in Football Will Be Operated Starting Next Year Maariv, 17 October 1968, Historical Jewish Press and up until the 1984-85 season a further tier, Liga Dalet was below Liga Gimel, until it was scrapped due to declining number of teams. Structure Since the 2013‚Äì14 season, Liga Gimel consists of eight divisions, four in the north and four in the less-populated south. Each league may contain between 12 and 16 clubs.https://www.football.org.il/files/SiteCollectionDocuments/FTP/eitan/takanon/2019/alifot29.8.pdf ◊™◊ß◊†◊ï◊ü ◊î◊ê◊ú◊ô◊§◊ï◊™] IFA The top club from each division is promoted at the end of the season to Liga Bet (the fourth level). Teams are assigned to their new Liga Bet divisions based on their geographical locations, with each of two division feeding to its corresponding Liga Bet division (Upper Galilee and Lower Galilee to Liga Bet North A, Jezreel and Samaria to North B, Sharon and Tel Aviv to South A and Center and South to South B). The second and third placed teams in each division enter a promotion/relegation play-off, at the end of which four teams from Liga Gimel meet the loser of the Liga Bet relegation play-off match (between the 13th and 14th placed team in their corresponding division) for a place in Liga Bet. As it is the lowest division, no clubs are relegated.

Blumenthal established The Grayzone in December 2015; he is the website's editor and one of its contributors. Blumenthal is a regular contributor to Sputnik and RT. He was formerly a writer for The Nation, AlterNet, The Daily Beast, Al Akhbar, and Media Matters for America, and has contributed to Al Jazeera English, The New York Times and the Los Angeles Times, He was selected as a Fellow of the Nation Institute. As of 2019, Blumenthal has written four books. His first, Republican Gomorrah: Inside the Movement that Shattered the Party (2009), made the Los Angeles Times and New York Times bestsellers lists. He was awarded the 2014 Lannan Foundation Cultural Freedom Notable Book Award for Goliath: Life and Loathing in Greater Israel, which was published in 2013. Background and affiliations Blumenthal was born on December 18, 1977, in Boston, Massachusetts, to Jacqueline (n√©e Jordan) and Sidney Blumenthal. His father is a journalist and writer who later served as an aide to President Bill Clinton. Blumenthal graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1999 with a B.A. degree in history. In late 2011, Blumenthal joined Lebanon's Al Akhbar newspaper primarily to write about Israel-Palestine and foreign-policy debates in Washington, DC. When he left the publication in June 2012 in protest of its coverage of the Syrian Civil War, he considered the newspaper to have a pro- Assad editorial line followed by such individuals as Amal Saad-Ghorayeb. He wrote that it \\"gave me more latitude than any paper in the United States to write about ... Israel and Palestine\\", but in the end he had tired of \\"jousting with Assad apologists\\". He added: \\"In the end, Assad will be remembered as an authoritarian tyrant.\\"The Real News, June 22, 2012, \\"Max Blumenthal Resigns Al Akhbar Over Syria Coverage\\" Blumenthal formerly contributed weekly articles to the AlterNet website, serving as a senior writer from September 2014. Blumenthal has broadcast on RT (formerly known as Russia Today) on many occasions. In December 2015, during an all-expenses paid trip to Moscow, Blumenthal attended RT's 10 Years On Air anniversary party attended by President Vladimir Putin, then-Lieutenant General Michael Flynn of the United States and English politician Ken Livingstone. In an interview with Tucker Carlson on Fox News in November 2017, Blumenthal defended RT against \\"the charge that it‚Äôs Kremlin propaganda.\\" He has also contributed on multiple occasions to Sputnik radio, as well as to Iran's Press TV and China's CGTN. Blumenthal founded The Grayzone website a month after his visit to Moscow. In an October 2019 article for New Politics magazine, Gilbert Achcar wrote that Blumenthal's Grayzone, along with the World Socialist Web Site, has \\"the habit of demonizing all left-wing critics of Putin and the likes of Assad by describing them as 'agents of imperialism' or some equivalent\\". The Grayzone and Blumenthal have rejected mainstream reports concerning the detention of a million Chinese Uyghurs in Xinjiang re-education camps. \\"I don‚Äôt have reason to doubt that there‚Äôs something going in Xinjiang, that there could even be repression\\", he told Afshin Rattansi on RT UK's Going Underground in July 2020, adding \\"we haven‚Äôt seen the evidence for these massive claims [of a million people detained]\\". Blumenthal's articles and video reports have been published by The Daily Beast, The Nation, The Huffington Post (for which he contributed from 2009-11), Al Jazeera English, the Columbia Journalism Review, The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, Washington Monthly, and Columbia Journalism Review.

Republican Gomorrah (2009) Blumenthal's book, Republican Gomorrah: Inside the Movement That Shattered the Party (2009), a bestseller on both the Los Angeles Times and New York Times bestsellers lists. The work was inspired by the work of the psychologist Erich Fromm. Fromm analyzed the personality of those \\"eager to surrender their freedom\\" via an identification with authoritarian causes and powerful leaders.Blumenthal Republican Gomorrah, p.13 For Blumenthal, a \\"culture of personal crisis\\" has defined the American \\"radical right\\". In a CNN interview, he commented: \\"The GOP has become subsumed by dysfunctional personalities with no capacity for restraining themselves, either from acting out hysterically or from their most devious urges. For these internally conflicted figures, who will continue to produce new and increasingly bizarre scandals, right-wing political crusading is simply a form of self-medication.\\" Israel and PalestineFeeling the Hate (2009 video)= In early June 2009, Blumenthal posted a 3-minute video on YouTube, titled Feeling the Hate in Jerusalem on the Eve of Obama's Cairo Address. The video was a photo montage of possibly drunk Jewish-American young people in Jerusalem recorded the day before President Barack Obama's Cairo address on June 4. Some youths used obscenities and racist rhetoric about President Obama and Arabs, referring to Obama as a \\"nigger\\" and \\"like a terrorist\\". According to The Jerusalem Post, the video \\"garnered massive exposure and caused a firestorm in the media and the Jewish world\\". A Bradley Burston op-ed in Haaretz described the video as \\"an overnight Internet sensation\\". After YouTube removed the video from its website, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency quoted Blumenthal as stating: \\"I won't ascribe motives to YouTube I am unable to confirm, but it is clear there is an active campaign by right-wing Jewish elements to suppress the video by filing a flood of complaints with YouTube\\". Blumenthal said that he had received death threats for his publication of the video: \\"People who feel they have an emotional need to stop this video by eliminating me, that's just a feature of right-wing psychology around the world\\". He identifies the radicalism of the interviewees with the \\"indoctrination\\" of Taglit-Birthright tours intended for diaspora Jews, in which he had himself participated in 2002. =Dispute with Professor Karen J. Greenberg (2011)= In 2011, Blumenthal reported that Israeli occupation forces and Bahraini monarchy guards trained American police departments in anti-protester techniques, including torture, and quoted Fordham University Law Professor Karen J. Greenberg.Blumenthal, Max. \\"How Israeli Occupation Forces, Bahraini Monarchy Guards Trained U.S. Police For Coordinated Crackdown On 'Occupy' Protests\\", Exiledonline.com, December 2, 2011. Contacted by Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic and Adam Serwer of Mother Jones, Greenberg told Goldberg that while she \\"never made such a statement\\", Blumenthal \\"was looking for corroboration but I told him I didn't have any.\\" She told Serwer that \\"I did not intend to assert these allegations as fact ... the entire sense of the quote is inaccurate.\\"Jeffrey Goldberg, \\"Did Israel Train American Interrogators in Torture?\\" (UPDATED), The Atlantic, December 7, 2011.Adam Serwer, \\"Is Israel Responsible For The Occupy Crackdowns?\\", Mother Jones, December 7, 2011. Blumenthal said that he had quoted Greenberg accurately, accused her of denying she had made the statement, and believed that she had since been \\"intimidated by Goldberg and the pro-Israel forces he represents.\\" Greenberg had made the same comments to Adam Serwer of Mother Jones.Blumenthal, Max and Mark Ames, \\"Max Blumenthal Responds To Sleaze Campaign Waged By Atlantic Monthly's Ex-Detention Camp Guard Jeffrey Goldberg‚Ä¶And Why The Atlantic Monthly's Sleaze Reminds Us Of Putin's Russia‚Ä¶, exiledonline.com, December 7, 2011. =Goliath (2013)= Blumenthal has written two books based on the periods of time he spent in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied territories in the West Bank. He documented what he said were Israeli and Palestinian war crimes in two books: Goliath: Life and Loathing in Greater Israel (2013) and The 51 Day War: Ruin and Resistance in Gaza (2015). Blumenthal's Goliath, published by Nation Books, outlines what Blumenthal characterizes as Israel's aggressive shift to the far-right, and its crackdown on local activism. In the preface, Blumenthal says that \\"Americans' tax dollars and political support [that] are crucial in sustaining the present state of affairs\\" in Israel. The book consists of 73 chapters with titles such as \\"To the Slaughter\\", \\"The Concentration Camp\\", \\"The Night of Broken Glass\\", \\"This Belongs to the White Man\\" and \\"How to Kill Goyim and Influence People\\". Blumenthal advocates in Goliath that the majority of Jews living in Israel must be removed to allow for a Palestinian state. Eric Alterman, writing for The Nation wrote that its author \\"proves a profoundly unreliable narrator\\" and his book will \\"do nothing to advance the interests of the occupation‚Äôs victims.\\" His article and an extract from Blumenthal's book in the same issue led to many letters being sent to The Nation, several of which were published in the next issue rebuking The Nation for publishing Alterman's article. Abdeen Jabara, Past president of the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, wrote saying he was troubled by The Nation presenting \\"two sides\\" by allowing Alterman to do a \\"hatchet job\\" on Blumenthal's work, because \\"there is no equivalency between whatever Palestinians have done or are doing and what Israel and Zionism have done to the Palestinians.\\" Charles H. Manekin, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Maryland and former Director of the Meyerhoff Center for Jewish Studies and others wrote letters challenging the accuracy of Alterman's article. Alterman's assertion in his original piece about the book being \\"technically accurate\\" was queried and he explained it was an issue of context, as Blumenthal \\"tells us only the facts he wishes us to know and withholds crucial ones that undermine his relentlessly anti-Israel narrative.\\" Jonathan S. Tobin, writing in Commentary magazine, described the book as having a \\"complete lack of intellectual merit or integrity\\". An event was held at the University of Pennsylvania on October 17, 2013 featuring Ian Lustick conversing with Blumenthal to discuss Goliath. Blumenthal objected to what he saw as \\"Israel's attempt to engineer and maintain a Jewish, non-indigenous majority\\", the Jewish population he alleged having an \\"attraction to Europe\\" (The Mizrahi, who constitute about half of Israel's Jewish population, have lived in the Middle East and North Africa since before the arrival of Islam.) Blumenthal said: \\"there is absolutely no way for Jewish people in Israel/Palestine to become indigenized under the present order. And that's what really has to happen.\\" Consequently, they should be \\"willing to be a part of the Arab world.\\" A \\"choice needs to be placed to the Israeli Jewish population\\" (which he also referred to as the \\"settler-colonial population\\") \\"and it can only be placed to them through external pressure.\\" \\"The maintenance and engineering of a non-indigenous demographic majority is non-negotiable\\", he said. Philip Weiss of the Mondoweiss website responded to Blumenthal's comments saying that \\"similar attitudes about indigenous culture have been used in intolerant ways in our society. I see some intolerance in that answer.\\" In the Acknowledgements to Goliath, Blumenthal wrote that websites such as Electronic Intifada and Mondoweiss had \\"provided essential outlets for much of the reporting\\" contained in the book. Petra Marquardt-Bigman wrote that the \\"single-minded effort in Goliath to portray Israel in an extremely biased way in order to promote comparisons to Nazi Germany that would justify political campaigns aimed at eliminating the Jewish state qualifies even under the most stringent criteria\\" as being antisemitic. In 2013, Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said that the center ranked Blumenthal as ninth that year for one of the \\"Top Ten 2013 Anti-Semitic, Anti-Israel Slurs\\". Hier said that \\"we judge him by what he wrote. He crossed the line into outright anti- Semitism\\" and that \\"he quotes approvingly characterizations of Israeli soldiers as 'Judeo-Nazis'\\". Blumenthal responded by saying the Wiesenthal Center's list associated him with such people as American writer Alice Walker. He commented that he, Richard Falk, and Roger Waters (who also appear on the list) \\"had stiff competition: Ayatollah Khomeini [sic, Khamenei] was number one.\\" Gilad Atzmon praised the book on the Veterans Today website: \\"I really want Blumenthal‚Äôs book to succeed and be read widely\\". He thought Blumenthal had \\"brilliantly though unwittingly managed to produce a pretty impressive journalistic account in support of my criticism of Jewish identity politics and tribal supremacy\\". =Russell Tribunal= Blumenthal appeared before the Russell Tribunal on September 25, 2014, in Brussels, Belgium, to testify on allegations of war crimes and genocidal intent by the Israeli military against residents of the Gaza Strip during Operation Protective Edge. During the Russell Tribunal on Palestine, Blumenthal made a comparison between Israel and ISIL. In a follow-up, Rania Khalek and Blumenthal created the Twitter hashtag #JSIL; \\"The Jewish State of Israel in the Levant\\", consciously intended as a comparison of Israel to the Islamic State terrorist organisation. =2014 Berlin visit= Blumenthal and Canadian-Israeli journalist David Sheen were invited by Inge H√∂ger and Annette Groth, members of The Left (Die Linke) party, to speak with them in the German parliament, the Bundestag, with the meeting being scheduled for November 12, 2014. Blumenthal and Steen stated that H√∂ger and Groth's party colleague Gregor Gysi, tried to cancel the meetings, while Gysi wishing to dissociate the Left Party from anti-Israel campaigns. Before the cancellation, Volker Beck of the Green Party described Blumenthal as someone who sought to \\"invoke consistently anti-Semitic comparisons between Israel and Nazism\\", Weinthal had presented his evidence about Blumenthal's writings and activism to Gysi. An incident ensued later that day, later dubbed \\"toiletgate\\", in which Blumenthal and Sheen waited for Gysi to discuss his claim they are antisemites, an assertion Gysi denied making. Gysi, followed by the two other parliamentary members, left his office and crossed down a corridor to enter a restroom, where Sheen and Blumenthal followed him, but failed to force their entry. The two MPs did hold their meeting with Sheen and Blumenthal in a non-party room, but cut all links with them after hearing about the incident with Gysi. Blumenthal and Sheen were banned from setting foot in the Bundestag again. In an e-mail explaining the ban, Bundestag president Norbert Lammert stated: \\"Every attempt to exert pressure on members of parliament, to physically threaten them and thus endanger the parliamentary process is intolerable and must be prevented\\". A meeting with the participation of Blumenthal and Sheen at Berlin's Volksb√ºhne (\\"People's Theatre\\") on November 9, 2014 (the anniversary of Kristallnacht) was also cancelled after protests. Blumenthal said it would have been \\"the perfect time to explain how the legacy of the European genocide had inspired our work, to emphasize that 'never again' meant never again to anyone\\". He later wrote on his personal blog: \\"I was censored and branded anti-Semitic by left politicians acting as the puppets of American neocons\\". =The 51 Day War (2015)= In The 51 Day War (2015), Blumenthal writes that he was in Gaza during and following Operation Protective Edge, the Israeli military offensive in Gaza during the summer of 2014. Blumenthal believed that the catalyst was the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers by a Hamas cell. He asserted that the West Bank operation that Israel initiated was not aimed at rescuing the teens, who were known to be dead, or capturing their killers, but destroying a political agreement between Hamas and the Palestinian National Authority by targeting the Palestinian Unity Government.Max Blumenthal, The 51 Day War: Ruin and Resistance in Gaza, Nation Books, 2015, pp. 7ff, 11ff. According to Petra Marquardt-Bigman, however, Blumenthal testified at the Russell Tribunal that he arrived in Gaza \\"at the onset of a five-day humanitarian ceasefire on August 14.\\" his interviews at the end of July indicate he was in Washington DC which suggests he was probably elsewhere, rather than \\"on the ground\\", for the first few weeks of the war. A tweet on August 22, she said, indicated Blumenthal had by then left the area. His book The 51 Day War was marketed as an \\"explosive work of reportage\\", but the author only spent a fraction of the period there. Marquardt Bigman wrote that certain of his tweets show an \\"uncritical acceptance of the terror group‚Äôs propaganda\\", a reference to Hamas. He did return to Gaza just prior or shortly after Hamas accepted an indeterminate ceasefire to cover the \\"victory rallies.\\" Of the Battle of Shujaiya in July 2014 in 51 Days War, Blumenthal wrote of the Al-Qassam Brigades (the military wing of Hamas) who ambushed IDF soldiers, that although they \\"had not vanquished the vaunted Israeli Army\\", \\"they delivered a bloody nose to its most elite units.\\" Sonali Kolhatkar wrote in the Los Angeles Review of Books that \\"Blumenthal‚Äôs casting of the Al-Qassam Brigades as an army of resistance against a brutal aggressor is an essential transgression from the standard narrative of the Middle East conflict.\\" Kirkus Reviews described the book as being \\"Explosive, pull-no-punches reporting that is certain to stir controversy.\\" The 51 Day War: Ruin and Resistance in Gaza was awarded a Palestine Book Award that year by the Middle East Monitor. Avi Benlolo CEO of the Wiesenthal Centre told The Canadian Jewish News in 2016: \\"While shunned by conventional media outlets, the book is popular on major anti-Semitic, neo-Nazi and conspiracy theory websites such as Stormfront and David Duke's Rense, where his work is used to promote anti-Jewish hate.\\"Other sources which mention David Duke (DD) or Stormfront (S) on Max Blumenthal: * (DD) * (DD & S) David Mikics cited above: \\"Blumenthal is also a go-to source about Jewish evildoers and evildoing for the neo-Nazi Stormfront site, and David Duke has endorsed his work.\\" * (DD & S) * (DD & S) =Hillary Clinton and Elie Wiesel= At the beginning of February 2016, it became known via a release of emails from the State Department that, during her four years as Secretary of State, Sidney Blumenthal had sent Hillary Clinton at least 19 articles by Max Blumenthal concerning Israel which she had distributed among her staff. In August 2010, she emailed the elder Blumenthal to say: \\"Pls congratulate Max for another impressive piece. He‚Äôs so good.\\" Alan Dershowitz, also an associate of the Clintons, warned of the potential for problems over the connection with someone so critical of Israel. When the Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel died in July 2016, Max Blumenthal tweeted that \\"Wiesel went from a victim of war crimes to a supporter of those who commit them\\" and \\"did more harm than good and should not be honored\\" and made other claims. In a statement to The Jerusalem Post, Jake Sullivan, then senior policy adviser for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, said: \\"Secretary Clinton emphatically rejects these offensive, hateful, and patently absurd statements about Elie Wiesel.\\" Syria In September 2013, Blumenthal reported for The Nation from the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan on the conditions in which Syrian refugees were living. In the article, he commented \\"there was not one person I spoke to in Zaatari who did not demand US military intervention at the earliest possible moment.\\" According to Janine di Giovanni in The New York Review of Books, after Blumenthal's visit to Moscow in December 2015, he began to promote views supportive of Bashar al Assad and the Syrian government's position. Blumenthal, she wrote, was among a group of \\"Assad apologists.\\" After the December 2015 trip, he claimed the White Helmets were connected to Al-Qaeda and anti-Assad Syrians were members of the group. In his opinion, they were being used as a Trojan horse, an excuse for the United States to propose having \\"70,000 American servicemen\\" invade Syria. Blumenthal asserted in October 2016 that the White Helmets were involved in a \\"false flag conspiracy\\" to claim an area had been targeted by the Syrian and Russian military. Charles Davis in an article for New Politics stated: \\"In fact, a White Helmets member was among the first civilians to appear on camera at the scene of the attack, declaring in English that 'the regime helicopters targeted this place with four barrel [bombs]'.\\" In an article for Grayzone, Blumenthal defended the assault on Aleppo (\\"one of the greatest losses for the empire since the fall of Saigon\\") by Syrian and Russia forces in September 2016, which the United Nations (UN) concluded was a war crime. He called for a \\"war on terror\\" by the \\"deep state\\" against those forces opposing \\"Russia and Iran, and Syria as well, countries which have really no intention to attack the United States.\\" Oz Katerji wrote in Haaretz in July 2017, that \\"[v]irtually any group that speaks out on the Assad regime‚Äôs campaign of systematic slaughter have been targeted by this coterie\\", consisting of Blumenthal, Gareth Porter, Ben Norton and Rania Khalek \\"with the express intention of defending a regime guilty of human extermination.\\" See also on this claim Gershom Gorenberg wrote on October 14, 2016 for The American Prospect that \\"Blumenthal's concern for Arab lives and rights seems to vanish once he locates the Assad regime as an opponent of American hegemony.\\" In January 2017, following claims made by the Syrian government, he blamed the contamination of the water supply for Damascus in the Wadi Barada valley on militants opposed to the government. A subsequent report by the UN found that ‚ÄúSyria‚Äôs air force deliberately bombed water sources in December [2016], a war crime that cut off water [to] 5.5 million people in and around the capital Damascus.\\" He tweeted in April 2018 that every time government forces \\"liberate\\" a rebel held area those opponents of Assad \\"allege a chemical attack.\\" Around the same time, he appeared on Sky News Australia to assert that it was quite probable the rebels had responsibility for the Douma chemical attack. \\"I cannot think of one pundit on the national scene, in cable news or in any major newspaper who has questioned the drive for regime change in Syria\\", he told Al Jazeera in an interview in June 2018. It is \\"left to a small group of journalists and online activists to really sift through what we believe is disinformation from our own governments aimed at stimulating a war of regime change.\\" In September 2019, Blumenthal visited Damascus as part of an American delegation to take part in an Assad-backed trade union convention which announced it stood \\"against the economic blockade, imperialist interventions and terrorism.\\" Assad's government does not allow independent labor unions and strikes are illegal. Americans in general were otherwise not receiving travel visas to Syria at this time. Also part of the same delegation, were individuals Idrees Ahmad described for Al Jazeera as \\"other pro-Assad conspiracy theorists\\", including Rania Khalek, Paul Larudee of the Syrian Solidarity Movement, Ajamu Baraka and former RT producer Anya Parampil. The delegation visited government-held areas and, according to Idrees Ahmad, were accompanied by a minder from the Assad government. In 2019, Bellingcat reported that Blumenthal, along with other reporters, had received a financial award for \\"uncompromised integrity in journalism\\" from a non-profit group that supports Assad. Blumenthal denied the allegation.https://twitter.com/maxblumenthal/status/1183142522492801025 Blumenthal challenged some of the assertions from his critics when he was interviewed by Rolling Stone in November 2019.  Russia  Blumenthal on RT America, December 2011. In November 2017, Blumenthal discussed the decision of the United States Department of Justice to classify RT as a \\"foreign agent\\" in an interview with Tucker Carlson on Fox News. He said to Carlson: \\"I go on RT fairly regularly, and the reason I do so is because, while the three major cable networks are promoting bombing and sanctioning half the world, at least the non-compliant nations, RT is questioning that.\\" New Politics, stated in 2018 that Blumenthal is \\"found almost every week defending Russian foreign policy on platforms such as RT and Sputnik\\", and that Blumenthal has defended Russia's role in the Syrian Civil War. For Blumenthal's writing on Ukraine, S≈Çawomir Sierakowski, the head of the Polish liberal, pro-European group Krytyka Polityczna, included Blumenthal in an article entitled \\"Putin‚Äôs Useful Idiots\\" in 2014. He said in a New York Times article that Blumenthal \\"distorts\\" the events of Euromaidan in his reporting. The Ukrainian fact- checking organization StopFake describes Blumenthal as a \\"pro-Russia American journalist\\" who is used by Russia to \\"spread its propaganda message\\". In discussions surrounding Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, Blumenthal expressed skepticism of the extent of the operation and remarked that MSNBC host Rachel Maddow's \\"dots may never connect.\\" He expressed concern that use of such a narrative prevented the Democratic Party in the United States from being able to \\"do anything progressive\\". Blumenthal appeared on the Russian Sputnik website in December 2017 to state his opinion that \\"the Trump transition team colluded with a foreign power to subvert America‚Äôs political system\\", referring not to Russia, but their supposed \\"collusion\\" with Israel. Peter Beinart wrote in The Atlantic that while Blumenthal and Glenn Greenwald have a strong dislike of President Donald Trump, they are more fundamentally against US foreign policy resulting in them minimizing \\"Russia's election meddling to oppose what they see as a new Cold War.\\" Matt Taibbi in Rolling Stone cited Blumenthal among a group of journalists who had expressed \\"healthy\\" skepticism of Russiagate, and defended them from accusations that they embodied the horseshoe theory. The Management of Savagery (2019) Lydia Wilson, in a Times Literary Supplement review, was critical of Blumenthal's The Management of Savagery (2019). In her review, Wilson wrote that the author overstates his case \\"with misleading or one-sided examples\\" in an account of the United States involvement in wars during the previous two decades which \\"tips sufficiently and with enough regularity into full-scale conspiracy to allow any careful reader to dismiss it.\\" Wilson commented that Blumenthal \\"uses long-debunked myths\\", originating from Russian and Syrian sources, to explain the Ghouta chemical attack in 2013.  Venezuela (2019) On 24 February 2019, Blumenthal posted an article to The Grayzone website about clashes on 23 February on the Colombia‚ÄìVenezuela border during the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis and the shipping of humanitarian aid to Venezuela. In the article, Blumenthal dismissed the assertion that Venezuelan security forces loyal to Nicol√°s Maduro had used tear gas to set fire to humanitarian aid trucks that were attempting to enter Venezuela from Colombia. He said footage from Bloomberg News showed that opposition protesters on the Francisco de Paula Santander bridge in the border were preparing Molotov cocktails, \\"which could easily set a truck cabin or its cargo alight\\". He referred to having seen similar situations during his reporting on the West Bank. On 10 March, The New York Times reported that their reconstruction, using both public information and previously unpublished video evidence, did not support accounts that the use of tear gas by Maduro's forces had caused the trucks to burn. It \\"suggest[ed] that a Molotov cocktail thrown by an antigovernment protester was the most likely trigger for the blaze\\". Glenn Greenwald in The Intercept commented that the report affirmed Blumenthal's analysis. On October 25, 2019, Blumenthal was arrested and charged with assault in a case related to a May 7 incident at the embassy of Venezuela, Washington, D.C. Blumenthal said his arrest was \\"clearly part of a campaign of political persecution designed to silence me and The Grayzone for our factual journalism exposing the deceptions, corruption and violence of the far-right Venezuelan opposition\\". The US Department of Justice dropped the case against Blumenthal on 6 December 2019. He alleged on The Jimmy Dore Show in May 2020 that George Soros is funding anti-government protesters in Venezuela, as well as in Hong Kong.  Other videos  Blumenthal made a short video which he titled Generation Chickenhawk (2007). It featured interviews with convention attendees at the July 2007 College Republican National Convention in Washington, D.C. Blumenthal asked why they, as Iraq War supporters, had not enlisted in the United States Armed Forces.LaSalle, Mick. \\"Maximum Strength Mick.\\" San Francisco Chronicle, July 19, 2007. In August 2007, Blumenthal made a short video called Rapture Ready, about American Christian fundamentalists' support for the State of Israel.Treiman, Daniel. \\"Max Blumenthal, Scourge of Conservative Conferences\\", The Forward, August 10, 2007. He attended the June 2007 Take Back America Conference (sponsored by the Campaign for America's Future), where he interviewed both supporters of (then) US Senator Barack Obama (D-Illinois) and 9/11 conspiracy theorists. Blumenthal says that conference organizers were angered by the video, and refused to air it. Bibliography * (2009): Republican Gomorrah: Inside the Movement that Shattered the Party New York.

They are, like all Christadelphians, millennialist and non- Trinitarian. The term Unamended Christadelphians is not the formal name of this community but is used informally to identify the grouping since a statement of faith traditionally used by many in this community is the \\"Unamended Statement of Faith\\". Similarly, most of the much larger grouping of Amended Christadelphians traditionally use a statement of faith that has been amended and therefore, in North America is known by the prefix \\"Amended\\". Nevertheless, Christadelphians worldwide and both Amended and Unamended Christadelphians in North America share fundamentally the same doctrines, with a few exceptions. The name Christadelphian derives from the Koine Greek meaning ‚ÄúBrethren of Christ‚Äù. Like all Christadelphians, The Unamended Christadelphians‚Äô have neither formal, ordained, or paid clergy.  Doctrine  In general the following description of doctrine is also true of all Christadelphians worldwide. The particular clauses relating to Christ's \\"condemned nature\\" and to the effects of baptism may be more distinctive to traditional Unamended Christadelphian positions in North America, though these are not held by all Unamended Christadelphians.For example Chicago Christadelphians are \\"Unamended\\" but their statement contains an amendment: Addendum I ‚Äì Basis of Belief: \\"We agree that the Birmingham Unamended Statement of Faith and the Birmingham Amended Statement of Faith represent valid statements of belief subject to the following clarifications regarding the clause that differentiates the two: (1.) From the creation, all mankind has been subject to the Creator and to divine authority. Knowledge and understanding of God‚Äôs ways and purpose are directly related to our responsibility to God. (2.) At Christ‚Äôs return, all of the baptized, living and dead, will be called to the judgment seat of Christ. In addition, those whom God deems responsible among the unbaptized, living and dead, will be called to judgment. (3.) We reject the teaching that only the baptized in Christ will be raised from the dead for judgment. We also reject the practice of identifying any unbaptized individual as being certain of appearance at the judgment seat.\\" :See section below Reunions and Unity Efforts. The Unamended Christadelphians‚Äô understanding of the nature and person of Jesus Christ, the nature of man, and millennial expectations sets the group apart from the majority of Christian denominations. Unamended Christadelphians are staunchly non-Trinitarian. The belief that Jesus Christ is not co-equal or co-eternal with but rather subordinate to God the Father is a fundamental doctrine. Furthermore, the Unamended Christadelphians maintain the Holy Spirit is not a distinct member of the Godhead, but the manifestation of God‚Äôs power. As such, these doctrines are contrary to the Nicene Creed. The group, while non- Trinitarian, are not adoptionists. The Unamended Christadelphians affirm a belief in the Virgin Birth of Jesus as the literal son of God and Mary.The Christadelphian Statement of Faith: or Doctrines forming the basis of fellowship, also doctrines to be rejected, with the epitome of the commandments of Christ, Christadelphian Advocate Publications: Richmond, VA. An additional distinguishing feature of doctrine is the teaching on the nature of man, particularly the rejection of a belief in a Platonic immortal soul. Unamended Christadelphians contend the Bible does not teach the soul is an immortal component of mankind. Therefore, the group does not proclaim the afterlife is the soul‚Äôs ascension to heaven or descent to eternal punishment in hell. Hell is merely the grave. In addition to teaching the complete mortality of mankind, Unamended Christadelphians also teach that because of Adam and Eve's disobedience in the Garden of Eden, mankind is inherently sinful and separated from God from birth. Through breaking God's law they created a breach in their relationship with God, and were destined to die. The very nature of mankind was no longer ‚Äúvery good‚Äù (Genesis 1), but became unclean in God's sight. Humans inherit this fallen nature from their progenitors, Adam and Eve. By birth, mankind is separated from God. Unamended Christadelphians believe that because Adam and Eve ceased to be very good, their children could not be born very good, or of a nature that is acceptable to God. This understanding is used to explain infant deaths. No person is held personally responsible or guilty for Adam's transgression This understanding of the nature of man extends to Jesus Christ, since he was born of a woman. The Unamended teach Jesus, like all mankind, was born into a state separated from God. Despite having a sinful nature as the result of his humanity he did not commit any personal sins, making him the only acceptable sacrifice to atone for the condemned nature of mankind. His sacrificial death (shedding of blood) was necessary to atone for the condemned nature he had like all mankind. He was not a substitute for all men, but a representative, because he also benefited from the redemptive work of his death. Unamended Christadelphians believe that a correct understanding of God's plan, a life lived in accordance with God's values and Christ's commandments, and baptism into Christ's name are necessary for salvation. By baptism, mankind may also escape their inherited condemnation to death and enter an atoned state, justified before God. Following the New Testament examples, only adult immersions are considered valid baptisms. The Unamended do not baptize infants, or those who do not profess a knowledge of and agree with these outlined doctrinal positions. Furthermore, the Unamended do not preach a doctrine of ‚Äúonce saved always saved‚Äù. Faithful service is required after baptism for salvation; however, they widely believe that salvation cannot be earned, but that it is the free gift of God to those children of His that faithfully seek Him, through His son, Jesus Christ. Since, under Unamended Christadelphian doctrines, the hope of mankind does not depend on an immortal soul, the group proclaims a bodily resurrection of the dead at the literal return of Jesus Christ to the earth. The purpose of resurrection is for judgment of the servants of Jesus Christ. This eschatological interpretation of Biblical prophecy means the Unamended Christadelphians are millennialists. Unamended Christadelphians see the return of Jesus as setting up the literal kingdom of Israel on earth. The kingdom will be worldwide and last for 1,000 years, after which sin and death will be completely eradicated and ‚ÄúGod will be all in all.‚Äù(1 Corth 15) Further distinguishing the Unamended Christadelphians from other Christian denominations is the absence of any church hierarchy or compensated clergy. See Organization below. The group believes in an inerrancy of the Bible and no other word of modern or ancient times is considered divinely inspired.  Historical development =Foundation The Christadelphians were founded through the preaching efforts of a British physician, John Thomas (1805‚Äì1871). Son of a pastor, Thomas emigrated to America in 1832, settling in Cincinnati, Ohio. There he meet Alexander Campbell and began preaching for Campbellite movement. By 1836 Thomas had concluded that adults who had been previously baptized by a different denomination had to be re-immersed in order to join the Campbellites. This view was not held by Campbell, and within the year Campbell disfellowshipped Thomas. Also during the final years with the Campbellites, Dr Thomas began proclaiming a bodily resurrection at the second coming of Jesus Christ.Lippy, C.H., \\"The Christadelphians in North America\\". Studies in American Religion. Vol. 43. 1989, Lewiston, NY: The Edwin Mellen Press.Roberts, R., Dr. Thomas: His life and work. 1873. During his tenure with the Campbellites, Thomas had gained some influence, to the extent that some in Richmond, Virginia and New York City left the Campbellites and formed new meetings in line with Thomas' teachings. Through preaching efforts to Campbellite and Millerite congregations, and through his publications, Thomas‚Äô message about the ‚ÄúTruth‚Äù spread throughout America and Great Britain. In Rochester, New York and New York City, the meetings of Thomas' supporters used the name ‚ÄúThe Royal Association of Believers‚Äù for their congregations. Although the charge of being ‚ÄúThomasites‚Äù was sometimes used against those who were rebaptised and joined the new proto-Christadelphian congregations ‚Äì for example by those associated with Joseph Marsh. The name Christadelphian originated in the days of the American Civil War. Brethren in Freeport, Illinois were threatened with conscription in 1864.Peter Hemingray, John Thomas: His Friends and His Faith 2003 p. 235 Conscientious objectors from known denominations were excluded from military service by law in the United States. In common with other groupings those associated with Thomas were not known or recognized as a denomination, since no single name was used to identify the members in North America or Britain. In order to obtain exemption, the name Christadelphians was selected.Brock, P., ed. Liberty and Conscience : A Documentary History of the Experiences of Conscientious Objectors in America through the Civil War 2002, Oxford University Press. The conscription issue in America coincided with a defining point in Britain over separation from those believing in a literal devil in 1863~1864, and Robert Roberts and other British Christadelphians had adopted the new denominational name by 1869.Andrew Wilson, History of the Christadelphians 1864‚Äì1885: the emergence of a denomination 1997 p.399 With the death of Thomas in 1871, Christadelphian meetings continued. Since no formal hierarchical structure existed within Christadelphians (see Organization), the death of the founding member was a sad occurrence, but did not result in a collapse of the denomination. Lippy commented this phenomenon was one of the unique features of Christadelphians. Each individual meeting continued as an independent unit. Scriptural instruction and cohesion was aided by the work of Roberts in Birmingham, England in the 1860s and in the 1880s Thomas Williams in Chicago, Illinois. Both men traveled to local meetings edifying the brotherhood, and served as editors of The Christadelphian and The Christadelphian Advocate periodicals, respectively. Statement of Faith & Division of Christadelphian Fellowships Local statements of faith had been written by local congregations since the 1850s, but formal declarations of faith determining fellowship were not utilized until 1862‚Äì64, the years when Christadelphians began to change from an informal movement into a defined denomination. In America the registration of \\"groups of believers\\" and the coining of the name Christadelphian (Ogle County Illinois, 1863) coincided with the British arm of the movement taking a fixed stand against belief in a supernatural devil (Edinburgh, 1863).Hemingray Peter, John Thomas His Friends and His Faith 2003: The statement of faith (or creed, or confession of faith) used by most Unamended Christadelphians today has its origins in the 1877 statement of faith of the Birmingham Central Ecclesia, Britain (known as the Birmingham Statement of Faith, or BSF). This 1877 statement was partly a response to a doctrinal dispute 1873‚Äì1877 between congregations in Britain. The doctrine in dispute was known as ‚ÄúRenunciationism‚Äù, ‚ÄúFree life‚Äù, or ‚ÄúTurneyism‚Äù after the originator Edward Turney of Nottingham. Turney essentially preached Jesus Christ was \\"not born of a condemned nature\\" (that is a \\"free life\\") and therefore he did not benefit in any way from his own death.Pursell, R., Christadelphians: The Untold Story. 2006. The doctrine was argued against by Robert Roberts in Birmingham and John James Andrew in London among others. The 1877 BSF already had some informal status as a benchmark in Britain and overseas due to the Birmingham Central Ecclesia being where the editorship of The Christadelphian Magazine was based at the time, but equally local ecclesias usually had their own local statements with similar wording, and continued to do.Wilson, Andrew, History of the Christadelphians 1864‚Äì1885: the emergence of a denomination 1997 The 1877 BSF begins with, ‚ÄúA statement of the ‚ÄòOne Faith,‚Äô upon which the Christadelphian Ecclesia of Birmingham is founded; together with a specification of the fables current in the religious world, of which they require a rejection on the part of all applying for their fellowship.‚Äù It contained seventeen provisions outlining the ‚ÄúTruth to be Believed‚Äù and seventeen ‚ÄúFables to be Refused‚Äù. This statement of beliefs became basis of fellowship for the majority of Christadelphian meetings in England and North America. Those disagreeing with the Birmingham positions left fellowship. During the next ten years the organization and wording of the statement was revised, but no doctrinal changes were made.Farrar, J.E., Seven Reservations Concerning the Amended Statement of Faith. 1995, Grimsby, ON. A significant change was the addition of a \\"Foundation Clause\\" in 1885 about inspiration. This removed a large part of the British Christadelphian movement into the \\"Suffolk St.\\" (name of the location of the second major ecclesia in Birmingham) or \\"Fraternal visitor\\" (name of the group's magazine) \\"fellowship\\". In the same year, March 1885, Thomas Williams commenced publication of The Christadelphian Advocate Magazine in Waterloo, Iowa. Williams supported Birmingham Temperance Hall's addition to BSF 1877 of the new \\"Foundation Clause\\", and therefore the \\"disfellowship\\" of the Suffolk St. group. Williams also approved Robert's position related to Edward Turney 12 years earlier,Williams, T. Renunciationism. The Christadelphian Advocate.1885(July):p. 104-112. though Turney's Nazarene fellowship had already effectively petered out with his death in 1879 and the return to the main grouping of his supporter David Handley in 1881. In 1898 a third division of Christadelphians occurred, this time over ‚Äúresurrectional responsibility‚Äù. Since Christadelphians teach a bodily resurrection and judgment at the return of Jesus Christ to earth, the controversy was over who would be resurrected and called to judgment. At question was whether or not persons who knew the word of God but were not baptised would be judged and condemned for rejecting the ‚ÄúTruth‚Äù, subsequently called in Unamended literature ‚Äúenlightened rejectors‚Äù. Although the exact phrase was not used in Britain, the Sydney Australia ecclesia had already excommunicated \\"ten who are not able to see that unbaptised and knowing rejectors of the truth are responsible\\" in 1884.The Christadelphian Magazine 1884, p.190 And this action had been defended by the editor Robert Roberts.The Christadelphian Magazine 1884, p.382 Nevertheless, the Birmingham Central Ecclesia did not immediately add this to their statement of faith, though some ecclesias did so. The statement of the North London ecclesia in 1887 read \\"Resurrection affects those only who are responsible to God by a knowledge of His revealed will\\". In 1894 J.J. Andrew of North London published a booklet 'Blood of the Covenant' in which he argued that no unbaptised would be raised and judged. On April 3 and 5, 1894 a debate was held on \\"Resurrectional Responsibility\\" between Roberts and Andrew, and on April 15 Islington Temperance Hall ecclesia, London, passed as resolution to separate from Barnsbury Hall ecclesia, London. The controversy continued 1894‚Äì1898. Roberts was absent from the UK in 1897 and died in 1898 in San Francisco, so opposition to J.J. Andrew was left to A.T. Jannaway and Frank Jannaway at London Clapham, and Charles Curwen Walker, the deputy editor in Birmingham. In 1898 following the examples of London Islington and some other London ecclesias the Birmingham Central meeting amended Clause 24 of BSF to read ‚Äúthe responsible (namely, those who know the revealed will of God, and have been called upon to submit to it)‚Äù in BASF, where the original 1877 BSF had stated only the ‚Äúresponsible (faithful and unfaithful)‚Äù would be judged. The change in wording was to emphasize that some individuals who were not baptized would be called to the judgment seat of Christ along with all baptized individuals, and that the reason for resurrection was knowledge of God's will, not an association with Christ‚Äôs sacrifice. Some Christadelphians consider that there are larger doctrinal implications involving the change. (For example, Williams, Lippy, Farrar, and Pursell outline larger doctrinal problems.) There are also Christadelphians who consider this a stand-alone issue, and point to the fact that no other clause of the BSF was amended. In theory the change made recognition that some unbaptised would be raised and judged a requirement of fellowship. However this was not pushed outside London and other areas like Yorkshire where Andrew's influence had been strongest. The London Clapham brethren led by Frank Jannaway urged all ecclesias who did not already have \\"amendments\\" prior to 1898 to adopt the new Birmingham amendment, and made it a fellowship issue in London, although the new editor Charles Curwen Walker in Birmingham and his assistant Henry Sulley in Nottingham did not push the issue. In the U.K. the new 1898 Birmingham Amended Statement of Faith (BASF) replaced BSF 1884 as a 'touchstone' but did not cause a significant division in Britain outside London, and even today many British ecclesias continue to have either local statements predating 1884, 1877, or modern statements. However the result of the amendment was a division of the Christadelphians in North America where the community separated into \\"Amended\\" (those using the new BASF), and \\"Unamended\\" those using the old BSF, or in 1909, the BUSF.Wilson, Bryan R., Sects and Society. 1996 Subsequently, J.J. Andrew separated from most of his own supporters, including John Owler of Barnsbury Hall, Islington ecclesia in London, and Albert Hall of the Sowerby Bridge ecclesia in Yorkshire, and Andrew was reportedly rebaptised in 1901, dying in 1907. However the division lingered on with Hall and Owler as \\"unamended\\" in Britain and Thomas Williams as \\"unamended\\" editor of The Advocate in Chicago. Williams visited Britain in 1903‚Äì04 at Owler and Hall's invitation, supporting their position against the \\"amendment\\", also urging the British \\"Unamended\\" (known as the \\"Up and be doing\\" movement) not to join with the large \\"Suffolk St\\" group. In 1909, the BUSF was revised and clarified in both title and in six propositions.Williams, T., The Birmingham Statement of Faith. The Christadelphian Advocate, 1909 (November): p. 315-317. ‚ÄúBirmingham‚Äù was dropped from the title and only the ‚Äúpalable errors .. none of which, however, causes doctrinal trouble‚Äù were changed.Williams, T., \\"The Statement of Faith\\". The Christadelphian Advocate, 1909 (December): p. 343-344. Thomas Williams, editor of the Advocate, explained: :‚ÄúIt is a mistake to think that we intended to get up another Statement of Faith. The one we have published is the Old Birmingham Statement, with a few corrections made, which the original writers of it would have made if their attention had been called to the errors ‚Äì not serious errors of doctrine, but yet errors that were awkward. The reason for calling it ‚ÄúThe Christadelphian Statement,‚Äù and omitting ‚ÄúBirmingham‚Äù lies against calling it ‚ÄúThe Chicago,‚Äù etc. It is undesirable to have any place named as more prominent than others. Therefore it is ‚ÄúThe Christadelphian Statement of Faith,‚Äù and each ecclesia can have its own address printed on the cover, as many are now doing.‚ÄùWilliams, T., Editorial. The Christadelphian Advocate, 1910 (February): p. 49. The amendment in the UK had little lasting effect other than moving a number of meetings from \\"Central\\" to \\"Suffolk St\\" groupings. Both John Owler and Albert Hall emigrated to North America, where first Owler then Hall subsequently succeeded Thomas Williams (died 1913) as editors of The Advocate. From America Owler urged the few British \\"Unamended\\" (the \\"Up and be doing\\" movement) to join with the larger \\"Suffolk St.\\" grouping in 1920, creating a bond also between the US Unamended and editor of the Fraternal Visitor in Britain, Thomas Turner.Advocate and Fellow Labourer March 1921 \\"Suffolk St.\\" reunited with \\"Central\\" in 1957. Different versions of BSF, BASF and BUSF Christadelphian statements of faith based on the Birmingham models (BSF 1877, BSF 1885, BASF 1898, BUSF 1909, etc.), and also some other Christadelphian statements of faith, follow the format: * 1. \\"Truth to be received\\" ‚Äì a list of 31 positive clauses. Numbering in BASF and BUSF is slightly different, since the unnumbered \\"Foundation Clause\\" on inspiration added to BSF in 1885 becomes clause 31 in BUSF.\\"THE FOUNDATION ‚Äì That the book currently known as the Bible, consisting of the Scriptures of Moses, the prophets, and the apostles, is the only source of knowledge concerning God and His purposes at present extant or available in the earth, and that the same were wholly given by inspiration of God in the writers, and are consequently without error in all parts of them, except such as may be due to the errors of transcription or translation.\\" Additionally clauses 24,25,26,27 in BUSF are numbered 27,24,25,26 in BASF. * 2. \\"Doctrines to be rejected\\" ‚Äì originally an ad-hoc list of teachings which had been barred from the \\"platform\\" at Birmingham Temperance Hall compiled 1864‚Äì1897 as problems were encountered. For some Christadelphian ecclesias this list was \\"frozen in time\\" in 1898 (BASF) or 1909 (BUSF), however other ecclesias have added new \\"DTBRs\\".This version of BUSF adds new \\"Doctrines to be rejected\\" no.s 36‚Äì38: \\"36. That the book of Revelation refers practically entirely to events which are to occur after Christ returns (futurist theory). 37. That the book of Revelation refers primarily to events that occurred in 70 A.D. (preterist theory). 38. That any theory that radically departs from the \\"continuous historical interpretation\\" as generally elaborated by John Thomas in Eureka is to be received. (This does not require unqualified acceptance of the interpretation of all events and symbols ‚Äì simply that the events \\"which must shortly come to pass\\" began to transpire shortly after the Apocalypse was given to the Apostle John in Patmos and that they have continued to unfold in the nearly 1900 years since that divine revelation.)\\" Some \\"Central\\" Christadelphians may also add DTBRs in this fashion.For example the version of BASF published by Logos Magazine, Eureka Press, Adelaide, 1987 changes the name \\"Jehovah\\" to \\"Yahweh\\" and adds 2 DTBRs. 36 ‚Äì against teaching the present possession of the Holy Spirit gifts, and 37 ‚Äì against teaching theistic evolution. * 3. \\"Commandments of Christ\\" ‚Äì originally in BSF 1877 a collection of 53 verses (to allow for 52 or 53 Sundays in a year) which \\"presiding brethren\\" at Birmingham Temperance Hall once read to conclude the ecclesial announcements on Sunday morning. Reunions and Unity Efforts From 1923‚Äì1952 the \\"Amended\\" community in North America again divided, again following the lines of a local split in London, England, with the majority forming the \\"Berean Fellowship\\" in North America. The minority in North America who remained in fellowship with Britain became known as \\"Central Fellowship\\". In a reunion in 1952, The Jersey City Resolution, the two Amended groups were reconciled and today the terms \\"Central\\" and \\"Amended\\" are used interchangeably in North America. This split 1923‚Äì1952 did not affect the Unamended community. In 1957 two further reunions in Britain and Australia corrected an earlier division dating from 1886 between \\"Suffolk Street\\" and \\"Central\\". This had the effect of uniting almost all Christadelphians outside North America into one grouping. Those in Central who held that the reasons for separation from the Suffolk Street Fellowship remained, opposed the re- union and formed the Old Paths Fellowship. From the 1970s onwards various attempts have been made to bring about reunion in North America, but have made little progress outside of the Pacific Coast, where all Christadelphians are now \\"Central\\". Reunion efforts continue in the Midwest and Canada. The current situation is complicated by the presence of a part of the Unamended grouping who hold views compatible with the main worldwide body of Christadelphians and who have succeeded in doctrinal agreement with the \\"Amended\\" arm of that body in North America, but have not so far found ways to implement that doctrinal agreement as a basis for fellowship.Christadelphian NASU Steering Committee. North American Statement of Unity Final Report 2005. Some Unamended ecclesias have formally taken the Amended grouping's position on the issue of resurrectional responsibility.Public letter of April 21, 2006 ‚ÄúThe Ecclesias listed below formally declare that our belief, teaching and fellowship practice are based on the scriptural principles of the One Faith, as summarized in the October 2003 NASU. By way of assurance to our Amended brethren, we reject the assertion that God cannot or definitely will not raise to judgment those outside covenant relationship, and we will not tolerate such teaching in our Ecclesias‚Äù. The Arranging Brethren of the following Ecclesias: Bloomington Ill., Chicago Ill., Guelph Ont., Picton Ont., Marion Ill, Ossington Ave. Ont., Rockford Ill. Parallel to the above unity efforts in North America between Amended Christadelphians and some Unamended Christadelphians, are efforts by Amended Christadelphians and some Unamended Christadelphians to achieve unity with the CGAF. The fourth grouping (in terms of numbers) the Berean Christadelphians, stand aside from all unity discussions as an exclusive fellowship. As described by WilsonWilson B, op.cit. see index re. \\"Christadelphian fellowships\\". and Lippy,Lippy C, op.cit. Introduction in general aside from the progress, or otherwise, of local and national unity efforts, Christadelphians in North America continue to regard members of other fellowships as \\"brethren\\" and inside the larger denominational circle. Classification Locating the Unamended Christadelphians within larger Christendom is not an easy endeavor. According to the Encyclopedia of American Religions the Unamended Christadelphians are members of the Baptist tradition of Christian denominations, based on their historical split with the Campbelites (Church of Christ / Disciples of Christ).Melton, J.G., Encyclopedia of American Religions. 7th ed. 2003, Detroit: Thomson Gale. The Unamended Christadelphians share an eschewing of infant baptism with the Anabaptists of the Reformation. However, the American Religious Data Archives includes Christadelphians under the ‚ÄúOther Group‚Äù denominational profiles. As outlined above, the group's doctrinal positions are contrary to most mainstream Christianity, and are recognized to view both Catholic and Protestant denominations as having lost the 1st century beliefs of the apostles.Wilson, BR. Sects and society; a sociological study of the Elim Tabernacle, Christian Science, and Christadelphians. California University Press. 1961 The Unamended Christadelphians could also be identified as one of the 19th century restoration movements,David Edwin Harrell, Jr., \\"Restorationism and the Stone-Campbell Tradition\\", in Encyclopedia of the American Religions Experience: Studies of Traditions and Movements, C.H. Lippy and P.W. Williams, Editors. 1988, Charles Scribner's Sons: New York. which would better suit their open proclamation that mainstream Christianity is corrupted and adheres to false beliefs. Paul Conkin, in book on American religious reformers, wrote that Unamended Christadelphians remain ‚Äúthe only sect that blends an extreme restorationist or primitivist bent with separatism and Adventism.\\"Conkin, P.K., American Originals: homade varieties of Christianity. 1997: The University of North Carolina Press. The millennialism or adventism faith of the Unamended Christadelphians has also grouped the denomination into a broad category with Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses and the Seventh- day Adventist Church, despite obvious doctrinal differences.The Hutchinson Dictionary of World Religions 2005, Abingdon, UK: Helicon Publishing Limited. The previously mentioned references classify Christadelphians as a denomination, but few make the distinction between the differing fellowships. In The Christadelphians in North America, Charles Lippy concluded the Unamended Christadelphians were best considered a sect based on the definitions of sociologists like Max Weber, Ernst Troeltsch and Richard Niebuhr. However, he noted the Unamended Christadelphians do not completely fit any single sect typology.  Organization & worship  The fundamental organizational unit of the Unamended Christadelphians is the local ecclesia. Ecclesia is the transliteration of the Greek ·ºêŒ∫Œ∫ŒªŒ∑œÉŒØŒ±, the common Greek word for assembly,Liddell Scott-Jones Greek Lexicon www.perseus.tufts.edu/lexica.html and is usually translated ‚Äúchurch‚Äù in the King James Version (example 1 Corinthians 15:19).Thayer, J.H., Thayer's Greek- English Lexicon of the New Testament. 2003, Peabody, MA: Hendrickson Publishers, Inc. The word ‚Äúchurch‚Äù was rejected because of the association with larger Christendom, and it does not have the meaning of an assembly of separated ones. In 2006, the number of organized North American Unamended Christadelphian ecclesias in listed in their ‚ÄúEcclesial Directory‚Äù was 83. Ecclesias were located in twenty-six states and two Canadian provinces. These counts do not include those individuals and families living in areas without an organized ecclesia (so-called isolation). The Unamended have always been few in number, with approximately 1,850 baptized adult members in 2006.2006 Christadelphian Ecclesial Directory. 2006. The Unamended are a much smaller group than the Central fellowship, which is worldwide and has as many as 50,000 members. Ecclesia size ranges from less than ten baptized members to nearly one hundred. The existence of very small ecclesias has been a feature throughout Christadelphian history.M'Clintock, J. and J. Strong, Cyclopedia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical Literature. 1894, Harper & Brothers: New York. Small ecclesias usually meet in member‚Äôs homes for worship services, whereas larger ecclesias usually own or rent a building to serve as a meeting hall. The ecclesia is attended by baptized members, their children, and un- baptized individuals (sometimes referred to as ‚Äúfriends of the Truth‚Äù or ‚Äúguests‚Äù). Number of ecclesias and members, by year Members Year (source) Ecclesias Unamended No distinction made 1936[12] 109 2,755 1984[12] ~6,000 1997[10] 95 ~2,000 (2) 2006[19] 83 ~1,850 (2) (2) Baptized adults only The decrease in the number of both Unamended ecclesias and members over the past 30 years can be attributed to a number of previously Unamended ecclesias adopting the BASF, and officially becoming Central, or \\"Amended\\" ecclesias; most notably in California. Baptized males (‚Äúbrethren‚Äù or ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù) assume all administration, teaching, and leadership duties in the ecclesia. All duties are uncompensated and on a volunteer basis. Brothers fulfilling the administrative roles (secretary, treasurer, etc.) are selected either by vote of the baptized ecclesial members, by drawing lots, or by virtue of being the only males in the ecclesia. Baptized men in good standing with the ecclesia preside over the memorial service, offer prayers, lecture and teach adult classes. Baptized women (‚Äúsisters‚Äù) may vote in ecclesia decisions, but do not assume any of the duties taken on by the brethren. Most ecclesias meet at least twice weekly. Once on Sunday for exhortation, the memorial service, and Sunday school. The sisters frequently teach the children‚Äôs Sunday school classes. In addition, many ecclesias will meet during the week for Bible study. Some ecclesias also have sisters‚Äô classes, or young persons‚Äô classes during the week. Each ecclesia is an autonomous entity.Roberts, R., A guide to the formation and conduct of Christadelphian ecclesias in the characteristic circumstances of an age when the Truth as apostolically delivered has been revived in the ways of divine providence, without the co-operation and living guidance of the holy spirit as enjoyed in the apostolic age. 1883. No larger formal hierarchical structure exists among the Unamended Christadelphians. Each individual ecclesia is responsible for issues of fellowship and instruction. By historical agreement, individual ecclesias respect each other‚Äôs decisions on fellowship regarding an individual. Ecclesias are linked or networked together via three mechanisms. First, publications, particularly the Christadelphian Advocate, serve to spread ecclesial news and propagate Christadelphian doctrines. The Advocate has been so influential, that the Unamended are sometimes referred to as the ‚ÄúAdvocate ecclesias‚Äù. Second, national or regional fraternal meetings known as Bible schools and gatherings connect a dispersed body. Both Bible schools and gatherings are usually annual occurrences hosted by a local ecclesia, with the only distinction being length. Bible schools traditionally last one week, and gatherings a (long) weekend. At Bible schools and gatherings individuals are exposed to guest teachers and lectures and meet fellow believers from different ecclesias. Both of publications and fraternal meetings maintain doctrinal order through essentially a system of peer-review. Thirdly, family ties link ecclesias across the nation. Family ties are prominent, given the statement of faith lists marriage with an unbelieving person is a belief to be rejected. Social views Based on Biblical texts, such as James 4:4 (‚ÄúYe adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.‚Äù) and 1 John 2:15‚Äì16 (‚ÄúLove not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.‚Äù), the Unamended see the world as fundamentally evil and in contrast to God‚Äôs will. Therefore, baptized members see themselves as ‚Äústrangers and pilgrims on earth‚Äù(Heb 11:13) and preach a degree of separatism from the world at large. This is not a monastic view, but attempt to prefer biblical study and fellowship over the offerings of the world. Unamended Christadelphians recognize the world as belonging to God, and they are servants of God and Christ. They refrain from politics, voting,Christadelphian Advocate. Question Box and jury duty. From the founding of the Christadelphians, the group have been conscientious objectors.

Shunsui Matsuda's love for silent films was so great he dedicated his life to finding and preserving valuable classic films from the golden era.  Biography  Born in 1925 in Tokyo, Shunsui Matsuda performed as child Benshi but it was only after the Pacific War, when the post-war shortages created a demand in films that Matsuda really began his vocation as a Benshi. In 1947 he found himself part of a troupe of itinerant benshi travelling around Ky≈´sh≈´, whose burgeoning coal mining industry had attracted a lot of workers to the region. The desperate shortage of any means of entertainment in the area meant that reruns of old silent films were still immensely popular. It was during his travels that he realized the need to preserve the films from the silent film era. With the 1923 Kanto earthquake and the War, a vast number of films had already been destroyed, but even worse was the complete laissez-faire attitude of the major studios to their own product. The few surviving fragments of films such as Ozu's I Graduated, But... (Daigaku wa Detakeredo, 1929) are pretty much entirely down to the efforts of this man, who travelled the country scouring pawn shops and old theatres for films to add to his collection. In 1948, he officially took up his name as the second Matsuda Shunsui and in the same year he was awarded the top prize in the national Film Narrator's Competition. In 1952, he founded Matsuda Film Productions and appointed President of the Friends of Silent Films Association, both which are still being thriving under the guidance of his second son, Yutaka Matsuda. He continued to give performances all the way up until his death in 1987, also directing his own silent film, Jigoku no Mushi (Maggots of Hell) in 1979 and producing Bantsuma - Bando Tsumasaburo no Shogai (Bantsuma - The Life and Times of Bando Tsumasaburo) in 1980. He can also be seen in full flow providing the narration for the silent film fragment in Kaizo Hayashi's homage to this golden age, To Sleep So As To Dream (Yume Miruyoni Nemuritai, 1986). In 1984, Matsuda received an invitation from the Frankfurt Museum of Cinema and he gave his first Benshi performance in Europe. A year later, he received the first Tokyo Metropolitan Culture Prize. Shunsui Matsuda died of cancer on 8 August 1987 leaving behind a great legacy.

Forming out of a broad area of low pressure in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on October 28, 1999, the disorganized tropical storm made landfall near Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) on October 30 before weakening to a tropical depression. The remnants of the storm persisted until November 1, at which time it was absorbed by a cold front on the northern end of the Yucat√°n Peninsula. Throughout Central America, Katrina produced heavy rains, estimated up to in mountainous areas, triggering mudslides and flash flooding. Unlike Mitch, little damage resulted from Katrina and no fatalities were reported. Due to the lack of damage caused by the storm, the name was not retired and was re-used during 2005 at which time it was retired due to catastrophic damage in the United States. Meteorological history Tropical Storm Katrina originated out of the remnants of a cold front tracking southward through the Caribbean Sea on October 22\\\\. By October 26, a broad area of low pressure, associated with disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity, developed over the southwestern Caribbean Sea. The following day, a surface low pressure became apparent after the system showed signs of rotation near the northern Panama coastline. On October 28, a hurricane hunter flight into the circulation revealed a well-defined low pressure system and resulting in the system being declared Tropical Depression Fifteen while situated roughly 175 mi (280 km) east of Bluefields, Nicaragua. The center of the newly classified depression was situated on the western edge of deep convection. The depression tracked slowly towards the northeast in response to the mid-level flow it was embedded within. By the morning of October 29, a tropical wave, tracking towards the west, began to interact with the depression and leading to forecasters discussing a possible merger of the two systems. An upper-level anticyclone over the eastern Caribbean produced significant wind shear over the depression, preventing the center from moving under the deep convection. However, a large convective banding feature developed to the north of the system. Several hours later, hurricane hunters flew through the storm and recorded surface winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 999 mbar (hPa; 29.5 inHg), leading to the upgrade of the depression to a tropical storm. At this time, the storm received the name Katrina and peaked in intensity. By 0000 UTC on October 30, the center of Katrina made landfall near Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua at peak intensity. Within three hours, the storm weakened to a depression due to interaction with the mountains of Nicaragua and convection was limited to a small area on the western side of the center of circulation. Katrina continued to track over Central America for most of October 30 and began to accelerate. Roughly 24 hours after landfall, the depression moved back over water, in the Gulf of Honduras; however, by this time, there was no convection remaining around the system. The acceleration of the storm was due to a regeneration of the low-level circulation northward. Due to unfavorable conditions, the weakened system failed to regenerate convection before moving back over land near the northern Belize-Mexico border. Around this time, forecasters reported that the depression would re- intensify once in the Gulf of Mexico before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. Although situated over land, the depression began to regenerate convection, leading to increased rainfall over the Yucatan Peninsula. By the evening of November 1, the depression weakened again and moved into the Gulf of Mexico; however, unlike previous forecasts, the circulation was absorbed by a cold front hours later. Preparations and Impact Tropical Storm Katrina at peak intensity Despite being a very weak storm, forecasters were wary about Katrina, as Central America was devastated by Hurricane Mitch exactly one year earlier. There was considerable fear of additional flash flooding and mudslides across the mountainous region. Immediately after being declared a tropical depression, a tropical storm warning was issued for Nicaragua, and it was extended to the San Andr√©s islands of Colombia shortly afterward. Officials in Honduras evacuated 71 families from the district of Col√≥n and another 17 families from other at-risk areas. Along the coastline of Honduras, a red alert was declared as torrential rains were anticipated to produce deadly mudslides in areas still recovering from Mitch nearly one year ago. Overall, damage was minimal as a result of Katrina. Only a few small mudslides were reported, along with some minor flooding, as the storm tracked across Central America. It was estimated that between 10 and 15 inches (250 to 375 mm) of rain fell across parts of the region as a result of Katrina, with one report of 3.58 inches (91 mm) in six hours from the island of San Andr√©s east of Nicaragua. Roughly 1,200 people were evacuated to emergency shelters in Honduras due to flooding. At least five bridges sustained damage and the cities of Tocoa and Trujillo were isolated as the Agu√°n and Siline rivers overflowed their banks. The water pipes recently constructed after being destroyed by Hurricane Mitch, worth HNL 170,000 (US$9,000) were once again destroyed by Katrina. The most severely affected area in Honduras was the Valle del Agu√°n. Rainfall from Tropical Storm Katrina in Mexico Between October 30 and November 1, the remnants of Katrina produced widespread moderate rainfall across the Yucatan Peninsula, peaking at in Cunduac√°n. Moisture from the remnants of the storm enhanced rainfall across southern Florida in association with the cold front that absorbed the system. Already saturated by previous rains, the National Weather Service issued flood watches for the region as torrential rains were expected to fall in relation to the system. Following the storm, the United Nations deployed field assessment teams to survey the damage caused by Katrina. The International Organization for Migration helped relocate affected families and construct at least 300 new residences for victims of Katrina and Hurricane Mitch the year prior. The Pan American Health Organization also deployed assessment teams to survey the area for the possibility of post-storm diseases. Due to the lack of any significant damage, the name Katrina was not retired and was re-used in the 2005 season; however, due to the catastrophic damage caused by the storm, it was retired in 2006 and was replaced with the name Katia.

Promotional art for the game is by Kinu Nishimura. The game's opening theme \\"Sh≈´tan no Ou to Isekai no Kishi ~The Endia & The Knights~\\" was done by Sound Horizon. In North America, the game was released on June 3, 2008 as a GameStop exclusive. Chaos Wars is a crossover between several companies' role-playing video game series, including Aruze's Shadow Hearts, Atlus's Growlanser, Idea Factory's Blazing Souls, Spectral Souls: Resurrection of the Ethereal Empires, and RED Entertainment's Gungrave and Code of the Samurai. Chaos Wars has become a cult classic because of the poor voice acting in the English localization of the game. Due to the voice actors sharing last names with members of the publishing team, it's believed they were relatives of the team. Story Hyoma, the protagonist, has a dream of another world over a pillar of light coming from his family shrine that has been missing since his ancestor's time. The next day, he decides to take his two friends, Shizuku and Hayatemaru, to investigate the mountains where his dream took place. During their investigation, they find a cave with strange technology but as they are looking into it, the machines activate and a bright light appears, taking them to another world known as Endia. When Hyoma transports to the world, he encounters a girl named Rin, the Gatekeeper of Endia, who is surrounded by summoned monsters. After Hyoma helps defeat the creatures the two introduce themselves, Hyoma rudely interrupting her and instead asks how to return to Tokyo. Before Rin could explain, more monsters appear. Hyoma and Rin run together, where they meet up with a friend of Rin's named Hiro. Afterwards, once safe, Rin explains that the walls are thick in this world, which is the reason that they have been taken from their world to this world. They are known as \\"Knights\\" because when people are taken to Endia, they obtain powers like any other. When Hyoma asks how to get back to his world, Rin explains that there is no way to return. Hyoma doesn't accept this fact and decides to find a way, but there, they then encounter the \\"Luin\\", an Organization that is determined to find \\"Keys\\" (mechanisms used to open gates and to summon \\"knights\\") in order to make their \\"paradise\\". After they escape from them with the help of Rin, they are taken to an isle near another island named \\"Radiance Island\\". There, they find a vacant mansion with its own transporter and that is where their adventure begins. Characters *Hyoma: Hyoma is a high school freshman from Tokyo, Japan. He has a sour look, a sour attitude, a sour everything in fact. He is very rude to almost everyone he meets but does show compassion for his two friends and the exception of Knights he encounters. He was bored of his own world so being taken to another world is quite exciting for him. *Hayatemaru: Like Hyoma, Hayatemaru is a glasses wearing high school freshmen and a long childhood friend to Hyoma. Hayatemaru is a very carefree, funny guy but after being taken to Endia, he becomes more serious but still tries to keep every one in high spirits. Despite his seemingly harmless appearance, Hayatemaru is a black belt and skilled in s≈çjutsu. His name is sometimes shortened to Hayate. *Shizuku: Shizuku is a childhood friend to Hyoma and Hayate. Despite being a senior in high school, she is the same age as both Hyoma and Hayatemaru and is a very caring and high spirited person. She always supports Hyoma, despite the fact he insults her most of the time due to her sometimes childish nature. She is very skilled in battle games and always carries around a harisen, which she uses to hit people on the head. *Rin: Rin is the \\"Gatekeeper\\" of the world of Endia. As a \\"Gatekeeper\\", her job is to monitor and keep track of data of \\"Knights\\" and other dimensions. Rin is a gentle and very knowledgeable young girl, trying her best to inform the Knights of her world despite Hyoma belittling her lack of knowledge that is out of her range. After Hyoma saves Rin from the Luin, she decides to travel with him to find answers to the world of Endia. *Hiro: Hiro is a warrior of the world called Neverland and the daughter of the demon lord Janus, as well as the lead character of the Spectral Force series. Hiro came shortly before Hyoma where she met Rin when she was taken to Endia. Knowing nothing of this world, she tags along. *Laru: Laru is the captain of the order of warriors known as \\"Kishadan\\", an order of soldiers trained to protect the people of Endia. Laru is a strong believer in justice and doing what's right but he is too firm sometimes. He begins to think that Hyoma and the others are with the Luin due to at one point, they try finding and using \\"Keys\\" to find a way home. At first he distrust them but after being rescued by Hyoma when the Luin kidnapped and brain washed him, he agrees to help them to their cause. Reception Chaos Wars received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN commented that, \\"In truth it's probably one of Idea Factory's best efforts released here in the States, melding staples of the genre with more open, zippy little ideas.\\" On a negative note, PlayStation: The Official Magazine said: \\"Chaos Wars might draw in some--like fans of the obscure games it's based on, especially those who long for the days of hand-drawn characters and tiny battlefields--but its old-school aesthetic isn't enough to make up for the lackluster production values and uninspired game play.\\" In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of two sevens and two sixes for a total of 26 out of 40.

The friary is located south of the city of Huelva, where the Tinto and Odiel rivers meet. The Friary of La R√°bida has been Franciscan property since the thirteenth century. It was founded in 1261; the evidence is a papal bull issued by Pope Benedict XIII in that year, allowing Friar Juan Rodr√≠guez and his companions to establish a community on the coast of Andalucia. The first Christian building on the site was constructed over a small pre-existing Almohad building that lends its name (r√°bida or r√°pita, meaning \\"watchtower\\" in Arabic) to the present monastery. The Franciscans have held great influence in the region ever since. The buildings standing on the site today were erected in stages in the late fourteenth century and the early fifteenth century. The friary, and the church associated with it, display elements of Gothic and Moorish revival architecture; their walls are decorated with frescos by the twentieth-century Spanish artist, Daniel V√°zquez Diaz (1882-1969). There is also a cloister and a museum, where numerous relics of the discovery of the Americas are displayed. The buildings on the site have nearly of floor space and an irregular floor plan. Throughout its five hundred years of existence, the monastery has been refurbished and repaired countless times, but the most extensive modifications were undertaken as a result of damage from the Lisbon earthquake of 1755. Christopher Columbus stayed at the friary two years before his famous first voyage, after learning that King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella had rejected his request for outfitting an expedition in search of the Indies. With the intervention of the guardian of La R√°bida and the confessor to Isabella, Francisco Jim√©nez de Cisneros, he was able to have his proposal heard. The friary was declared a Spanish National Monument in 1856. History The main doorway of La R√°bida The friary sits on a rocky bluff that overlooks the confluence of the rivers Tinto and Odiel, known since ancient times as Saturn's Rock. On this spot, the Phoenicians built an altar dedicated to their god, Melqart, the patron of Tyre, also called the Baal (lord) of Tyre, a deity often identified with Hercules. Later, the Romans chose this same place to venerate the goddess, Proserpina. The Arabs raised a small monastery here to train mounted monk-warriors like those of the Christian Orders. The name r√°bida (or r√°pita) is derived from the Arabic word for \\"watchtower\\", and the ruins of several other Moorish towers of this kind along the Costa de la Luz still exist. In this environment, Muslim ascetics sought to become perfected spiritually so that they would be better able to defend this isolated coastal frontier of the Moorish empire in Iberia. Columbus and His Son at La R√°bida (1838, Eug√®ne Delacroix) In the twelfth century, the site passed to the Knights Templar under the protection of Our Lady of Miracles. In the thirteenth century, it became a Franciscan friary. Tradition holds that St. Francis of Assisi himself visited here, in the company of twelve disciples, to found a small and humble community. As with the Moors and the Templars before them, the Franciscan friars established this location, from the beginning, as a stronghold, a place for resisting the depredations of pirates who continually roamed the coast. Pope Eugene IV granted indulgences to all who rendered aid to travelers seeking refuge at this site. Many of the buildings to house and support the Conventual Franciscans, more properly known as the Order of Friars Minor Conventual, were constructed during the first part of the fifteenth century. The noble of the region, Don Juan Alfonso de Guzman El Bueno, the 1st Duke of Medina Sidonia (1410-1468), as well as local commoners, all collaborated in the construction projects. The friary is best known in history for the visit of Christopher Columbus in 1490 during which the mariner consulted with the Franciscans, such as Horacio Crassocius, about his plans for organizing a voyage of discovery. Columbus then decided to take Crassocius with him as a servant called Juan. After the War of Spanish Independence and the Confiscation of Mendiz√°bal, a land reform scheme that seized unproductive church properties, the friary fell into ruins until, in 1855, a restoration was begun at the initiative of Prince Antoine of Bourbon-Orleans, Duke of Montpensier and the provincial delegation in the Spanish Cortes. In 1882, King Alfonso XII visited the friary and lent his support to a second round of rehabilitation and improvement with the purpose of commemorating the quadricentennial of the discovery of the Americas in 1892. The king engaged the architect, Ricardo Vel√°zquez Bosco, whose subsequent contributions evinced a profound respect for the atmosphere and spirit of the original building. The buildings The church The chapter room or reception room The church The date of the construction of the church cannot be established with certainty. One of the early architectural elements that is well preserved is the arch-like main doorway. Other features include frescos on the walls and a meticulously painted ceiling of Moorish influence. Also on the walls, there is an eighteenth-century painting of St. John of God and representations of the life of St. Francis of Assisi. Presiding over the main altar is a sculpture of a Christ which replaces an older statue destroyed during the Spanish Civil War. In the south wall there is a small chapel alcove dedicated to the patron of the friary, Our Lady of Miracles. There is a 14th- century alabaster carving of her in the church. The cloister The Moorish revival-style cloister dates from the fifteenth century and remains in a good state of conservation. In the seventeenth century, it was expanded by the construction of a second storey complete with battlements for defense against pirate invasions. It is decorated with paintings of modern vintage, and some fragments of the original paintings survive. Today, on the second floor, there is a permanent exhibition of scale models of the three caravels of the first voyage of Columbus: the Ni√±a, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria. The reception room Frescos by Daniel V√°zquez Diaz The reception room is a well-lit rectangular room of ample proportions where, in the days of Columbus, the friars met with him and debated theories and speculations about navigation. The name ‚ÄúColumbus Conference Room\\" is often used to refer to this chamber. In 1992, in celebration of the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's voyage of discovery, there was a meeting of the Spanish council of ministers (cabinet), presided over by King Juan Carlos I, in this room. Other rooms The refectory is a rectangular room with parallel rows of tables and a whitewashed pulpit or lectern for reading or lecturing or preaching. The library holds documents and objects of historical interest, most notably the map of the world of Juan de la Cosa on which, for the first time, the coast of the Americas appears. There is also an exhibition room where the flags of each of the countries of the Americas and a small sealed vessel containing soil from the New World are on display. Around a small patio adorned with numerous plants and flowers are rooms decorated with colorful frescos executed by the Spanish painter, Daniel V√°zquez Diaz, in 1930. The subject of these paintings is Columbus and his expedition. The paintings are pre-cubist in style, an approach V√°zquez Diaz had recently adopted during a sojourn in Paris. The surroundings of the monastery In the garden stands The Column of the Discoverers, a monument to commemorate the four-hundredth anniversary of the first voyage of Columbus. It is made of brilliant white stone incised with numerous figures and scenes depicting the colonization of the Americas. In front of the main entrance is an iron cross and the busts of the Franciscan friars, Juan P√©rez and Antonio de Marchena, which both were made by the sculptor Le√≥n Ortega. Next to the entrance is a plaque made of azulejos with the following inscription: \\"The R√°bida is the first manifestation of the Hispano-American movement. This place, where the vision of a New World was conceived, is sacred to the hearts of people everywhere. Any Spaniard or American who reflects deeply and elevates his thoughts must ask, 'Won't you help us in our intention to spread love and peace, the forces that radiate from this humble monastery?' Christ, before whom Columbus, Friar Juan Perez, Friar Marchena, and the Pinz√≥ns all prayed, opens his loving arms to men of all beliefs who harbor good will.\\" Our Lady of Miracles St. Mary, the mother of Jesus, is the patronress of the friary, and a small statue of her can be found in the friary church. Carved in alabaster, the statue is, stylistically, of the school of fourteenth-century Andalucian art. According to a legend with scant historical basis, this image was brought back from one of his trips by a sailor from Palos de la Frontera and, because the Moors were still in Spain, it was hidden by submerging it off the Huelva coast. Later, fishermen hauled it up in their nets and restored it to the church of the monastery. One thing is certain: Columbus and some of his crew prayed before this image hours before setting sail for the New World.

Early sources call him Tri Darma \\"King Dharma\\". His domain extended beyond Tibet to include Dunhuang and neighbouring Chinese regions.Samten Karmay in , pg. 57 By tradition Langdarma is held to have been anti-Buddhist and a follower of Bon. He is attributed with the assassination of his brother, King Ralpacan, in 838 AD and he is generally held to have persecuted Buddhists. According to traditional accounts, during the first two years of his rule, Langdarma remained a Buddhist, but under the influence of W√©gyel Tor√© (), he became a follower of Bon. The anti-Buddhist portrayal of this king has been questioned by several historians, most prominently Zuiho Yamaguchi.Yamaguchi, Zuiho. ‚ÄúThe Fiction of King Dar ma's Persecution of Buddhism.‚Äù in Langdarma's reign was plagued by external troubles.

One of Langdarma's grandsons, Kyid√© Nyima G√∂n (), conquered Ngari in the late 10th century, although his army originally numbered only 300 men. Kyid√© Nyima G√∂n founded several towns and castles and he apparently ordered the construction of the main sculptures at Shey. \\"In an inscription he says he had them made for the religious benefit of the Tsanpo (the dynastic title of his father and ancestors), and of all the people of Ngaris (Western Tibet).

He was born in Bonn, studied at the University of Bonn, and spent most of his professional career in Bonn. He is remembered for his microscopic research of the brain and spinal cord. Around 1860, Deiters provided the most comprehensive description of a nerve cell that was known to exist at the time. He identified the cells' axon, which he called an \\"axis cylinder\\", and its dendrites, which he referred to as protoplasmic processes. He postulated that dendrites must fuse to form a continuous network.

It enables T cells to migrate to lymph node and the B cell zones. In humans, the CXC-R5 protein is encoded by the CXCR5 gene.  Tissue distribution and function  The BLR1 / CXCR5 gene is specifically expressed in Burkitt's lymphoma and lymphatic tissues, such as follicles in lymph nodes as well as in spleen. The gene plays an essential role in B cell migration. Through CXCL13 secretions B cells are able to locate the lymph node. Additionally, some recent studies have suggested that CXCL13, through CXCR5, is capable of recruiting hematopoietic precursor cells (CD3‚àí CD4+) which would cause the development of lymph nodes and Peyer's Patches. Other studies highlight the role of CXCR5 in T cells, as they are unable to access B cell follicles without CXCR5 expression. This is a key step in the production of high affinity antibodies as B cells and T cells need to interact in order to activate the Ig class switch. CXCR5 has been shown to be expressed on both CD4 and CD8 T cells, though it is often regarded as the defining marker for T Follicular Helper (Tfh) cells.  Role in cancer development  Recently, it was shown that CXCR5 overexpression in breast cancer patients highly correlates with lymph node metastases, and elevated CXCR5 expression may contribute to abnormal cell survival and migration in breast tumors that lack functional p53 protein. Minor allele of SNP rs630923, located in the area of CXCR5 gene promoter and associated with the risk of multiple sclerosis, is responsible for appearance of MEF2C-binding site resulted in reduced CXCR5 gene promoter activity in B-cells during activation, that could lead to decreased autoimmune response While chemokines and chemokine receptors have been thought to be involved in cancer development and maintenance, recently CXCR5 has come under investigation for its role in metastatic progression of prostate cancer. A recent study has indicated that prostate cancer tissue as well as cell lines express higher non-basal levels of CXCR5. Furthermore, the study found a correlation between the level of CXCR5 and Gleason score. CXCR5 location was additionally considered and higher Gleason scores correlated with nuclear CXCR5 while cytoplasmic and membrane CXCR5 correlated with benign and early prostate cancers.

It is a common condition in humans particularly in the tropics and the agrarian societies. In developing countries, children afflicted by Vitamin A deficiency are at high risk for corneal ulcer and may become blind in both eyes, which may persist lifelong. In ophthalmology, a corneal ulcer usually refers to having an infectious cause while the term corneal abrasion refers more to physical abrasions. Signs and symptoms Corneal ulcers are extremely painful due to nerve exposure, and can cause tearing, squinting, and vision loss of the eye. There may also be signs of anterior uveitis, such as miosis (small pupil), aqueous flare (protein in the aqueous humour), and redness of the eye. An axon reflex may be responsible for uveitis formation‚Äîstimulation of pain receptors in the cornea results in release inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, histamine, and acetylcholine. Sensitivity to light (photophobia) is also a common symptom of corneal ulcer. Redness of the affected eye is common. Brow ache and head ache may be present. Drooping of eye lid may be present. Slit lamp examination shows loss of epithelium. the site of the ulcer is studied and marked in case sheet.the edge of the ulcer is studied.whether satellite lesion is present or not is seen. Next, the cornea is stained with 1% fluorescein. The ulcer is stained green. Types=Superficial and deep corneal ulcers Corneal ulcers are a common human eye disease. They are caused by trauma, particularly with vegetable matter, as well as chemical injury, contact lenses and infections. Other eye conditions can cause corneal ulcers, such as entropion, distichiasis, corneal dystrophy, and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye). Many micro-organisms cause infective corneal ulcer. Among them are bacteria, fungi, viruses, protozoa, and chlamydia: *Corneal Ulcer after a bacterial keratitisBacterial keratitis is caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus viridans, Escherichia coli, Enterococci, Pseudomonas, Nocardia, N. Gonorrhoea and many other bacteria. * Fungal keratitis causes deep and severe corneal ulcer. It is caused by Aspergillus sp., Fusarium sp., Candida sp., as also Rhizopus, Mucor, and other fungi. The typical feature of fungal keratitis is slow onset and gradual progression, where signs are much more than the symptoms. Small satellite lesions around the ulcer are a common feature of fungal keratitis and hypopyon is usually seen. * Viral keratitis causes corneal ulceration. It is caused most commonly by Herpes simplex, Herpes zoster and Adenoviruses. Also it can be caused by coronaviruses & many other viruses. Herpes virus cause a dendritic ulcer, which can recur and relapse over the lifetime of an individual. * Protozoa infection like Acanthamoeba keratitis is characterized by severe pain and is associated with contact lens users swimming in pools. * Chlamydia trachomatis can also contribute to development of corneal ulcer. Superficial ulcers involve a loss of part of the epithelium. Deep ulcers extend into or through the stroma and can result in severe scarring and corneal perforation. Descemetoceles occur when the ulcer extends through the stroma. This type of ulcer is especially dangerous and can rapidly result in corneal perforation, if not treated in time. The location of the ulcer depends somewhat on the cause. Central ulcers are typically caused by trauma, dry eye, or exposure from facial nerve paralysis or exophthalmos. Entropion, severe dry eye and trichiasis (inturning of eyelashes) may cause ulceration of the peripheral cornea. Immune-mediated eye disease can cause ulcers at the border of the cornea and sclera. These include Rheumatoid arthritis, rosacea, systemic sclerosis which lead to a special type of corneal ulcer called Mooren's ulcer. It has a circumferential crater like depression of the cornea, just inside the limbus, usually with an overhanging edge. Refractory corneal ulcers Refractory corneal ulcers are superficial ulcers that heal poorly and tend to recur. They are also known as indolent ulcers or Boxer ulcers. They are believed to be caused by a defect in the basement membrane and a lack of hemidesmosomal attachments. They are recognized by undermined epithelium that surrounds the ulcer and easily peels back. Refractory corneal ulcers are most commonly seen in diabetics and often occur in the other eye later. They are similar to Cogan's cystic dystrophy. Melting ulcers Melting ulcers are a type of corneal ulcer involving progressive loss of stroma in a dissolving fashion. This is most commonly seen in Pseudomonas infection, but it can be caused by other types of bacteria or fungi. These infectious agents produce proteases and collagenases which break down the corneal stroma. Complete loss of the stroma can occur within 24 hours. Treatment includes antibiotics and collagenase inhibitors such as acetylcysteine. Surgery in the form of corneal transplantation (penetrating keratoplasty) is usually necessary to save the eye. Corneal healing An ulcer of the cornea heals by two methods: migration of surrounding epithelial cells followed by mitosis (dividing) of the cells, and introduction of blood vessels from the conjunctiva. Superficial small ulcers heal rapidly by the first method. However, larger or deeper ulcers often require the presence of blood vessels to supply inflammatory cells. White blood cells and fibroblasts produce granulation tissue and then scar tissue, effectively healing the cornea. Diagnosis Diagnosis is done by direct observation under magnified view of slit lamp revealing the ulcer on the cornea. The use of fluorescein stain, which is taken up by exposed corneal stroma and appears green, helps in defining the margins of the corneal ulcer, and can reveal additional details of the surrounding epithelium. Herpes simplex ulcers show a typical dendritic pattern of staining. Rose-Bengal dye is also used for supra-vital staining purposes, but it may be very irritating to the eyes. In descemetoceles, the Descemet's membrane will bulge forward and after staining will appear as a dark circle with a green boundary, because it does not absorb the stain. Doing a corneal scraping and examining under the microscope with stains like Gram's and KOH preparation may reveal the bacteria and fungi respectively. Microbiological culture tests may be necessary to isolate the causative organisms for some cases. Other tests that may be necessary include a Schirmer's test for keratoconjunctivitis sicca and an analysis of facial nerve function for facial nerve paralysis. Treatment Proper diagnosis is essential for optimal treatment. The cause of the ulcer is to be decided. Whether infective or non-infective. Bacterial corneal ulcer require intensive fortified antibiotic therapy to treat the infection. Fungal corneal ulcers require intensive application of topical anti-fungal agents. Viral corneal ulceration caused by herpes virus may respond to antivirals like topical acyclovir ointment instilled at least five times a day. Alongside, supportive therapy like pain medications are given, including topical cycloplegics like atropine or homatropine to dilate the pupil and thereby stop spasms of the ciliary muscle. Superficial ulcers may heal in less than a week. Deep ulcers and descemetoceles may require conjunctival grafts or conjunctival flaps, soft contact lenses, or corneal transplant. Proper nutrition, including protein intake and Vitamin C are usually advised. In cases of Keratomalacia, where the corneal ulceration is due to a deficiency of Vitamin A, supplementation of the Vitamin A by oral or intramuscular route is given. Drugs that are usually contraindicated in corneal ulcer are topical corticosteroids and anesthetics - these should not be used on any type of corneal ulcer because they prevent healing, may lead to superinfection with fungi and other bacteria and will often make the condition much worse. Refractory ulcers Topical antibiotics are used at hourly intervals to treat infectious corneal ulcers. Cycloplegic eye drops are applied to give rest to the eye. Pain medications are given as needed. Loose epithelium and ulcer base can be scraped off and sent for culture sensitivity studies to find out the pathogenic organism. This helps in choosing appropriate antibiotics. Complete healing takes anywhere from about a few weeks to several months. Refractory corneal ulcers can take a long time to heal, sometimes months. In case of progressive or non-healing ulcers, surgical intervention by an ophthalmologist with corneal transplantation may be required to save the eye. In all corneal ulcers it is important to rule out predisposing factors like diabetes mellitus and immunodeficiency. Conjunctival flap may be drawn over the ulcer as an alternative.

Geography At , its summit is the second highest point in San Diego County. Cuyamaca Peak is located roughly from the Pacific Ocean, within Cuyamaca Rancho State Park. It is east of the city of San Diego and southwest of Julian. A popular year round hike to the summit of Cuyamaca leads from the Paso Picacho Campground, starting at about . Ecology Snows in winter are common above and surrounding regions in Cuyamaca Rancho State Park. During summer, Bracken Ferns, a variety of wildflowers and native bunchgrasses dominate mountain meadows and the forest floor. Prior to the Cedar Fire, Black oaks once lit up the mountain. Cedar Fire In October 2003, the Cedar Fire, the largest fire in recorded California history, burned the once abundant White Fir (Abies concolor), Incense Cedar (Calocedrus decurrens), Jeffrey Pine, Coulter Pine, Sugar Pine, and Black oak (Quercus kelloggii) that once lined the mountain. Small seedlings of new White fir, Sugar Pine, Coulter Pine, Jeffrey Pine, and Incense Cedar were seen within a year of the Cedar Fire, and were thriving as saplings by 2007, an example of fire ecology. Precipitation The significant elevation of Cuyamaca relative to its surrounding landscape catches Pacific moisture easily, forming clouds which are forced to release their moisture in order to pass East, resulting in average annual precipitation between 20 and 32 inches. Fall and Winter storms account for 70%, summer thunderstorms largely accounting for the balance. During the winter snow may fall and hoar frost is common upon the highest elevations.

Dobr√©e declared himself a Channel Islander, and was rather proud that both his Bonamy and Dobr√©e ancestors, bankers, had been mentioned by Thackeray. His father, who had the same name, was born in 1862 and married Violet Gordon Chase. He had two daughters before his son was born, then died at St. Moritz of tuberculosis on 30 August 1891. His grandfather was the Bonamy Dobr√©e who was Governor of the Bank of England in 1859-1861. After Haileybury and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, Dobr√©e was commissioned in the Royal Field Artillery in 1910 but resigned in 1913. He rejoined in 1914, serving in France and the Middle East during World War I. In 1920 he took advantage of a tuition discount offered to veterans, taking his BA from Christ's College, Cambridge in 1921 and his MA in 1924. In 1925 he was appointed lecturer in London, and in 1926 Professor of English at the Egyptian University, Cairo, where he remained until 1929. In 1936 he was appointed Professor of English Literature at the University of Leeds, where he remained until his retirement. During World War II Dobr√©e served as a lieutenant-colonel in the ABCA organisation. He delivered the Clark Lectures at Cambridge in 1953, and was an Honorary Doctor of the University of Dijon. After retiring from Leeds he edited the Writers and their Work series of pamphlets for the British Council and the National Book League, and himself authored a pamphlet on Rudyard Kipling. He also lectured as Professor of Literature at Gresham College. He was the Lord Northcliffe Memorial Lecturer in 1963. He died in his Blackheath home. On 21 November 1913, Dobr√©e married Gladys May Mabel Brooke-Pechell (after her marriage called Valentine Dobr√©e; ca. 1893 - 14 May 1974), the daughter of Sir Alexander Brooke-Pechell, 7th Baronet,A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Peerage and Baronetage, the Privy Council, Knightage and Companionage, Sir Bernard Burke, Ashworth P.

The series follows the actions of William Laurence and his dragon, Temeraire. The book takes place in Africa and follows Laurence and Temeraire's search for a cure to the disease that has paralyzed the dragon community. Naomi Novik visited southern Africa in search of places in the fourth novel. Empire of Ivory was released in paperback in North America by Del Ray on September 25, 2007. The British hardcover edition was published by Voyager on November 5, 2007. Plot summary Laurence and Temeraire arrive back in the United Kingdom, following their evacuation of Danzig in Black Powder War. Their relief at arriving safely is short-lived as Napoleon continues his preparations for an invasion of the British Isles. When questioned about the lack of British air support for the Prussians, Laurence discovers that Britain had no dragons to spare: a flu-like epidemic has infected the greater part of them, and British science has yet to devise a cure. To combat it, Temeraire, Iskierka and the ferals are forced to fly frantic patrols, both as a show of force and to prevent Napoleon from getting reconnaissance in over the contaminated coverts; at one point Temeraire is forced to knock a French courier-dragon, Sauvignon, out of the sky and down into one of the coverts, risking infection himself. Temeraire and Laurence continue to develop their notions of draconic equality in British society and find common cause with William Wilberforce and the abolitionist movement in exchange for assistance from prominent political leaders. Before they can continue their plans, they are enlisted to return to Africa to seek a cure for the draconic flu, which Temeraire caught and was cured of in Throne of Jade; his immunity is proven when he fails to contract the illness from Sauvignon and the other dragons. The entire formation is shipped to the Cape Colony aboard the Allegiance, along with a black missionary, Rev. Josiah Erasmus, formerly of the Lunda people, his wife Hannah and their daughters. The missionaries are manumitted slaves, causing tension between Laurence and Allegiance captain Tom Riley, a staunch supporter of the slave trade and occasional friend of Laurence. Riley is also further thrown off balance by the discovery that some of the Aerial Corps' officers, including Lily's captain Catherine Harcourt, are women (the acid-spitting Longwing breed, along with a few others, refuse to accept male handlers). After several weeks of searching, the formation makes land at the Cape of Good Hope; Maximus, the Regal Copper, is so weary that his handler Berkley does not believe he will ever return home. However, enough fungi are found to cure the formation, and with the help of two African boys, Demane and Sipho, and their small dog, they set out to find more. In the end, they discover the fungus in a cave, being fertilized by dragon dung: it has been deliberately cultivated. Scarcely has this realization set in that the Aerial Corps are beset by Tswana humans and dragons; the British beasts, who have been sent back to the Cape with their precious cargo, are unable to prevent their aircrews from being captured, and Rev. Erasmus' attempts to intercede only lead to his death, as the Lunda are known slavers. The British contingent is taken captive and brought back to the Tswana capitol, a settlement at Mosi-oa-Tunya (what is today called Victoria Falls) for imprisonment and interrogation. This is particularly challenging to Harcourt, who had become intimate with Riley during the voyage and is now bearing his child. Hannah Erasmus, taken from the Tswana some twenty years ago, is of particular importance during their captivity: not only is she able to provide some intercession for the British, but her word is given extra weight by Kefentse, her dragon ancestor who is overjoyed to have her back. The Tswana, in addition to being fiercely offended by the depredations of the African slave trade on their people, practice a form of ancestor worship in which dragons are brought up to believe they are the reincarnations of former (human) leaders. This makes their resistance to the slave trade even fiercer since dragons are deeply possessive of those humans they consider their own. Though Laurence is able to establish some small rapport with Prince Moshueshue and apologize for the mushroom theft, the ancestors Mokhachane and Kefentse remained unconvinced by the mere words of Laurence. Temeraire, who has picked up some Xhosa from Demane and Sipho, is able to talk the location of Mosi-oa- Tunya out of some feral dragons, and he, Dulcia and Lily organize an escape for their crews. But before they have managed to return to the Cape, the Tswana are already on overrunning the Colony, and indeed all European ports on the African coast. Lily's formation retreats to Great Britain aboard the Allegiance; whilst at sea, Riley marries Catherine Harcourt, more at his insistence than hers. Upon returning to Britain, they discover that the latest abolitionist bill in Parliament was defeated by strong opposition from Admiral Horatio Nelson and that Sauvignon, now infected with the plague, has \\"escaped\\" back to France. Laurence and Temeraire are horrified to realize that Government and Admiralty alike have countenanced the wholesale slaughter of, not only every French dragon but quite probably every dragon in Eurasia. Acting on their consciences, they steal a tub of cultivated mushrooms and fly the English Channel to deliver the cure to the French. For this, they earn the personal respect of Napoleon Bonaparte, but Laurence turns down the Emperor's offer of asylum, preferring to return to his beloved Commonwealth and answer for his treason.

It also understands that Oromiffa and Tigrinya should be equally an official language and working language in the capitals. It is against secession because that policy harms the unity of the nation. TDJP believes in liberal democracy. In general, TDJP does not believe a peaceful struggle will bring change because the TPLF regime is inhumane, intolerant and unapproachable.

His parents, David and Isabella (Campbell) McLaughlin, had come from Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1851 and settled in Beardstown. The family moved to Muskegon, Michigan, in 1864, and David became a leading attorney in Muskegon. He served on the Muskegon School Board for 25 years and was the secretary for 19 years. McLaughlin attended the public schools of Muskegon and graduated from high school in 1876. After a preparatory course, he entered the literary department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in the fall of 1878, but did not graduate. He became an assistant to his father and later worked at a bank. In the summer of 1880, he worked as an office clerk and bookkeeper in a law office, and studied the law. He entered the law department of the University of Michigan in the fall of 1881 and graduated in 1883. In the same year, he was admitted to the bar, and joined his father's law firm in Muskegon. After his father's death in 1891, he had his own practice until 1899, when he formed the firm, J.C. & J.A. McLaughlin, with a cousin as the junior partner. McLaughlin also succeeded to the abstract business of his father, under the name of Muskegon County Abstract Company. He was also a director of the Enterprize Foundry Company and a director and attorney for the Home Builders & Loan Association, both of Muskegon. He served as prosecuting attorney of Muskegon County, 1887-1901. In 1901 was appointed by the Governor of Michigan Aaron T.

Wells was born and raised in Gloucester, and educated at local school Linden Road Secondary. He was a right-handed tail-end batsman and off- break bowler who played in 302 first-class matches between 1951 and 1965, for Gloucestershire and Nottinghamshire. Wells took 998 wickets in first-class matches at an average of 24.26. Playing career Wells was known as \\"Bomber\\" after the former British heavyweight boxer \\"Bombardier\\" Billy Wells who struck the gong at the start of films made by the Rank studios. Wells was unable to retain a place in his native County side through the emergence of David Allen who was a far superior batsman. Wells had taken 122 and 123 wickets in 1955 and 1956 respectively but had a moderate season in 1957 and was not able to displace Allen or John Mortimore thereafter. Joining Nottinghamshire, the weakest county team at that time, Wells claimed 120 wickets in his first season, bowling over 1200 overs. He retired after the 1965 season. A poor bat, Wells scored 25% of his runs in sixes. His career batting average was 7.47. Wells claimed to have bowled the fastest over in cricket, during the time it took for the bells of Worcester Cathedral to strike 12 o'clock. The bells have since been timed at approximately 34 seconds.Lynch, Stephen. Gone in 34 seconds, 3 February 2009, Cricinfo. Retrieved on 3 February 2009.

He describes how on his very first match for Gloucestershire he had to borrow kit in order to play and travelled to the game on the bus. He was known to dislike physical exercise and so developed a run-up of just one or two paces. It took some time for batsman to get used to this unusual style: \\"I took five wickets in my first match. And I know at least two of them weren't looking,\\" he told audiences. Although he took 998 wickets in first-class cricket he declined the opportunity to play in the last game of his final first-class season in 1965. He thought he had 999 wickets. \\"Lots of people have taken 1000 wickets, he told the Notts captain.

Before this event, he was known for his positive relations with several tribes. His memoir, published in 1910, was entitled, My Friend the Indian. McLaughlin emigrated to the United States at the age of 21, living briefly in St. Paul, Minnesota, where he married a Mdewakanton woman of mixed-blood descent. He soon became a citizen. While working as a blacksmith at Fort Totten, he studied to become a U.S. Indian agent, and was selected to supervise the Devils Lake Agency in 1876. He was promoted and transferred in 1881 to the larger Standing Rock Sioux Agency in the Dakotas, working there for many years, in an era of short- term political appointments. In 1895 he was promoted to a position as Inspector of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Department of Interior, working until his death in 1923 in Washington, D.C.

In 1871 he was hired by the commanding officer of Fort Totten, North Dakota, as a blacksmith and general overseer at the Devils Lake Indian Agency; the U.S. Army outpost was in what was then called the Dakota Territory. While there, he studied to become a United States Indian agent; at the time Indian affairs were supervised as part of the Department of the Army. Army officers noted that he established good relations with the Lakota. In 1876 he was appointed as agent of the Devils Lake Agency in present-day North Dakota, the reservation for a Sisseton Wahpeton tribe of the Dakota people. In 1881, following the movement of Lakota Sioux tribes to Standing Rock Sioux Agency, McLaughlin was assigned to that much larger facility, which held several tribes. These Sioux agencies were all part of what was known as the Great Sioux Reservation, before it was divided into smaller reservations. McLaughlin believed his mission was to make Native Americans self-sufficient by encouraging them to assimilate, to become educated according to Western standards and to adopt white/Anglo-American culture, including subsistence farming. Local climate and geographic conditions made such style of agriculture difficult in the Dakotas, as allotments proved to be too small. In 1888, he and other agents accompanied a large delegation of chiefs from the six Sioux reservations to Washington, D.C., to meet with Bureau of Indian Affairs officials to discuss the Dawes Act. A photograph of McLaughlin and the Standing Rock delegation,U.S. commissioners and delegations of Sioux chiefs visiting Washington, October 13, 1888, Library of Congress, Washington DC https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/93514650/resource/ including the noted chief Sitting Bull and interpreter Louis Primeau, along with U.S. Commissioners, U.S. Indian Agents, interpreters and many Sioux chiefs, was taken on the front steps of the capital in 1888. The leaders were meeting to discuss implementation of the Dawes Act at the Great Sioux Reservation, then consisting of 22 million acres. The act called for distributing the reservation's communal lands as allotments to heads of individual households. The government intended for the Lakota to adopt subsistence-style farming on the European-American model and give up their nomadic hunting lifestyle. Under the legislation, the government would declare remaining lands after allotment as \\"surplus,\\" to be made available for sale to non-Lakota people. To implement the Dawes Act among the Plains tribes, officials registered all tribal members on what have become known as the Dawes Rolls. Documented descent from individuals listed as tribal members on these rolls is required by some sovereign tribes today for a person to qualify as a member; each tribe establishes its own rules. McLaughlin is best known for having ordered the arrest of Sitting Bull on 15 December 1890. He had been warned by Lt. Bull Head that the chief was preparing to go to the Pine Ridge Reservation, where the Ghost Dance movement was strong. McLaughlin and other U.S. officials feared this would inspire resistance among the Lakota; they worried that the Ghost Dance was a kind of pre-war dance. McLaughlin partially blamed Caroline Weldon,Pollack, Eileen. Woman Walking Ahead: In Search of Catherine Weldon and Sitting Bull.

Rising tensions among the people led to the Army-Lakota confrontation on Pine Ridge at Wounded Knee two weeks later, resulting in the Army massacre of many Lakota.Richardson, Heather Cox.

Both his parents had roots in the Jamestown, Tennessee, area, and he is a first cousin of U.S. Congressman John Rosehttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/65262958/mildred-pyle and a distant cousin of World War I hero Alvin York. Through his maternal grandmother, he can trace his ancestry to Claus Koger (1572‚Äì1630), a bailiff of the German town of Weil am Rhein. Pyle had a younger sister, Marilyn (1953‚Äì2016), and has an older sister, Peggy (1941‚Äìpresent). Known as Tommy throughout his childhood, Pyle graduated from Eastmoor High School in Columbus, Ohio, in 1966, and studied for a year at Tennessee Technological University, where classmates dubbed him \\"Artimus\\" on account of his boyish face. He enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1968. He was named platoon and series honorman and promoted to private first class after boot camp in San Diego. Eyeing a career in civil aviation, Pyle worked as an avionics mechanic at various military bases, including Millington, Tennessee, and Beaufort, South Carolina, rising to the rank of sergeant. He was honorably discharged in 1971, after his father was killed in a mid-air collision with a U.S. Air Force B-57 weather reconnaissance bomber over New Mexico. Lynyrd Skynyrd After playing with Thickwood Lick in Spartanburg, South Carolina, Pyle joined Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1974 after being convinced by Brian Pruitt. He initially played alongside, and then replaced, original drummer Bob Burns. He made his recording debut in August of that year on \\"Saturday Night Special\\", which became the first single from the band's third album, Nuthin' Fancy. In addition to Nuthin' Fancy, Pyle also played on the albums Gimme Back My Bullets, One More from the Road, Street Survivors, Legend, Southern by the Grace of God and Lynyrd Skynyrd 1991.Lynyrd Skynyrd Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Accessed September 24, 2007. Pyle was known as \\"the wild man of Southern rock\\" for his antics. During a gig in New Jersey in 1977, he jumped into the crowd to quell a disturbance. The band's singer, Ronnie Van Zant, quipped, \\"We keep him in a cage and feed him raw meat, only let him out when it's time to play.\\" During a gig in London, England, he was lowered to the stage by a trapeze rope while hallucinating on mescaline. Despite such stunts, Pyle was relatively even-keeled compared to his raucous bandmates, and spent much of his time trying to defuse chaos caused by excessive drug and alcohol intake. He survived the 1977 plane crash that killed Van Zant, guitarist Steve Gaines, backing vocalist Cassie Gaines who was the sister of Steve Gaines, assistant Road Manager Dean Kilpatrick, and the two Pilots. Pyle suffered torn chest cartilage but managed to stumble several hundred yards through a creek and freshly plowed field to a farmhouse to get help. The appearance of Pyle alarmed the 21-year-old farmer Johnny Mote, who mistook him for an escaped convict and fired a warning shot over Pyle's head - Pyle would later joke he was hit in the shoulder, but his other accounts differ. https://www.tribpub.com/gdpr/orlandosentinel.com/ Mote also refutes the claim of Pyle being shot, when interviewed at the crash scene for VH1's 2002 documentary 'Lynyrd Skynyrd's Uncivil War'. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFIkQjDtwOw Mote realised the situation when Pyle shouted that there had been a plane crash, helped Pyle inside his house and was part of the initial rescue party. About the same time local rescuers, who had just completed a Civil Defense drill, converged on the scene and Pyle directed them to the crash site where the dead and the injured were located. After the crash On January 13, 1979, the surviving members of Lynyrd Skynyrd reunited for Charlie Daniels' fifth annual Volunteer Jam concert in Nashville. They played an instrumental version of \\"Free Bird\\". Bassist Leon Wilkeson watched from the wings because he was still unable to play. Following the crash, Pyle spent three years living in Jerusalem, studying at the Diaspora Yeshiva. The yeshiva was known for attracting spiritual seekers from the hippie and counterculture movements, whether they were Jewish or not. Many of the students were professional or semi-professional musicians. Pyle played with the house band, the Diaspora Yeshiva Band, during informal gatherings, and formed a band called Remez with fellow student Rabbi Karmi Ingber. When he departed, he donated his drum kit to the yeshiva. Pyle reflected on these years in the song \\"I Live in Jerusalem\\" on a 2007 solo album. In an interview with the Lucas H. Gordon Show posted online in 2013, Pyle is asked why he went to Israel for three years, to which he replied, \\"I was trying to become a human being.\\" Pyle and several other bandmates also worked with a short-lived trio called Alias on their album Contraband. The group consisted of Dorman Cogburn, a childhood friend of Lynyrd Skynyrd guitarist Gary Rossington; vocalist Jimmy Dougherty, who went on to sing on the Allen Collins Band's sole album, and former Skynyrd backing vocalist JoJo Billingsley. These collaborations set in motion the formation of the Rossington Collins Band, with all the survivors plus Dale Krantz on lead vocals and Barry Lee Harwood on guitar. Pyle was forced to drop out after breaking his leg in 21 places following a collision with a drunk driver. Pyle was replaced by Derek Hess. In 1982, Pyle began recording and touring with the Artimus Pyle Band (A.P.B.),\\"Lynyrd Skynyrd\\" The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll (Simon & Schuster, 2001).

(1981), Nightcaller (1983) and Live from Planet Earth (2000). Pyle took part in the Skynyrd Tribute tour and joined the reformed Lynyrd Skynyrd in recording Lynyrd Skynyrd 1991 before departing the band during a show in Toronto on August 2, 1991. In a radio interview with Rick Lewis and Michael Floorwax on The FOX in Denver, Colorado, on the 20th anniversary of the crash, Pyle said, \\"I left the band in 1991 basically because there was a problem with drugs and alcohol and I felt as though we should have put all that stuff behind us years and years ago.\\" Both Pyle and his predecessor, Bob Burns, performed with the current version of Lynyrd Skynyrd following the band's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. Pyle declined to join a 2018 Lynyrd Skynyrd Farewell Tour https://metalheadzone.com/lynyrd-skynyrd-is-not-playing-the-songs-in-a-right- way-former-member-claims/ but is still a working musician and continues to tour with The Artimus Pyle Band https://artimuspyleband.com/calendar He also wrote the film Street Survivors: The True Story of the Lynyrd Skynyrd Plane Crash which premiered in 2020, after a legal dispute which included a 2017 injunction attempting to stop production. https://www.courthousenews.com/widow-fights-film-fatal-lynyrd-skynyrd- crash/https://ultimateclassicrock.com/artimus-pyle-interview-2020/ Musicianship=Influences As a child, Pyle was introduced to country music stars such as Patsy Cline, Hank Williams, Floyd Cramer, and Eddy Arnold by listening to the radio when he stayed with his maternal grandparents in Tennessee. He also absorbed his father's passion for Patti Page, Perry Como and Frank Sinatra. His favorite musical artists include Frank Zappa, Weather Report, Herbie Hancock, and Japanese electronica pioneer Isao Tomita. Drums Pyle learned his craft by listening to the radio and copying drummers such as Ringo Starr, Buddy Rich, Gene Krupa, and Joe Morello of the Dave Brubeck Quartet. He received his first set of drums when he was approximately the age of 12, a red sparkle Slingerland kit consisting of one bass drum, one rack tom, one floor tom, and a snare drum. He has described his style as \\"technical.\\" During his tenure with Lynyrd Skynyrd, he initially played a chrome-plated Jazz Rock Slingerland kit that he had purchased with his Marines discharge check. It featured two rack toms (14 and 15 inches); two floor toms (16 and 18 inches); two bass drums (24 inches); and a Rogers Dynasonic snare drum (14 x 6.5 inches). Later, the Slingerland Drum Company built him a set of blonde-maple drums with red mahogany rims. This kit consisted of four tom-toms up, two toms on the floor, with a double bass drum. He specified no resonant heads on the bottom for better microphone placement, although it made drum-tuning more of a challenge. His cowbell was an actual cowbell. He taped his drumsticks like a gladiator's sandals, calling it the \\"gladiator grip.\\" He took thin strips of duct tape, and painstakingly made an interweaving pattern along the stick. The tape created a bond with his hands so that he did not have to grip the sticks as hard and could play more aggressively. He wears ultralight black leather gloves, which he dampens just before a performance to create the same bonding effect. He uses heavy, unlacquered Vic Firth 5B sticks. Recent activities Pyle plays in several bands in the Asheville, North Carolina, area. He also tours the United States with a new incarnation of the Artimus Pyle Band that plays Lynyrd Skynyrd tunes note-for-note faithful to the recorded versions. Former Lynyrd Skynyrd member Ed King has instructed Pyle's bandmates on the original chords and tunings. In 2004, Pyle recorded four studio tracks on Southern Rock band Rambler's album First Things First with vocalist Pat Terranova, guitarist Mitch Farber, bassist Willy Lussier and acoustic guitarist and vocalist Rikki Cuccia. In 2007, he toured with the band Deep South, whose lineup also included Wet Willie vocalist Jimmy Hall and former Atlanta Rhythm Section members Robert Nix and Dean Daughtry. In 2007, Pyle released the album Artimus Venomus on Storm Dog Records Group/Cleopatra Records.Flans, Robyn. Artimus Pyle: Venomus after Lynyrd Skynyrd Modern Drummer Online. Accessed August 5, 2012. Several of the tunes referenced his personal tribulations, including \\"Blood Sucking Weasel Attorneys\\" and \\"Dead Rock Stars, Widows, Gigolos, Pocket Money.\\" Guests included Ed King and former Lynyrd Skynyrd backing singers Jo Jo Billingsley and Leslie Hawkins. In 2014, Pyle was a guest performer on Eli Cook's album, Primitive Son. In June 2017, Pyle was sued by Ronnie Van Zant's widow, Judy Van Zant, Gary Rossington, current Lynyrd Skynyrd singer Johnny Van Zant, and the representatives and heirs of Allen Collins and Steve Gaines. They claimed his involvement in a low-budget feature film about the band's plane crash infringed upon a consent decree the band agreed to in 1988. In October 2017, Pyle was going to publish his memoir, \\"Street Survivor: Keeping the Beat in Lynyrd Skynyrd\\", cowritten with journalist Dean Goodman, through Backbeat Books/Hal Leonard. However, the lawsuit kept the book from being published indefinitely. Personal life Pyle lives in Asheville, North Carolina. He has three sons, two daughters, two grandchildren and has been married twice. His interests include cars, motorbikes, horses and watching reruns of The Andy Griffith Show and Gomer Pyle. He is also a vegetarian. In 1993, Pyle was charged with attempted capital sexual battery and lewd assault on two girls. He denied the charges, claiming the girls had been abused by people connected to babysitters in a Jacksonville mobile home park who held a grudge against him. Moreover, he claimed the allegations were an attempt to extort money from the Lynyrd Skynyrd organization. Weeks before the trial was due to start in January 1994, Pyle pleaded no contest rather than risk a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment if found guilty in a jury trial. He was sentenced to probation and required to register as a sex offender. In 2007, Pyle was charged with failure to register as a sex offender in St. Johns County, Florida, after officials lost the change-of-address form he had sent them when he and his family moved to North Carolina. He rejected a plea bargain offer, and was acquitted by a jury in 2009. In popular culture *The sludge metal band Artimus Pyledriver based its name on Pyle. The members of the bands are not related. *The grindcore act Anal Cunt mentions Pyle several times in the song \\"I Gave NAMBLA Pictures of Your Kid\\" off their It Just Gets Worse album, referencing his sex offender conviction and status.

Dobson (born September 9, 1952 in Charlotte, North Carolina) is an American author in the fields of business (particularly office politics and project management), alternate history novels (relating to WWII) and role- playing game adventures (D&D;, Indiana Jones, and Buck Rogers XXVC). Early life Dobson's family moved from North Carolina to Germany when he was a child; his father had spent the latter part of World War II in a POW camp and had grown adjusted to German hospitality. The Dobson family returned to the United States five years later in 1960. Dobson later lived in Decatur, Alabama, but he felt that he did not fit in well in the South. \\"I still can't play a Civil War game to this day.\\" Having trouble in school, and having had enough of the Deep South, he moved back to Charlotte for college. During college, he was employed as a faculty member teaching freshman composition and science fiction. Dobson graduated from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte with bachelors degree with an English/writing major. Career Dobson worked at three jobs after college: a typist, substitute teacher, and a planetarium operator on weekends. \\"I worked real hard to get a real job,\\" explained Dobson, \\"and I was finally hired as a research assistant in the Aeronautics Department of the National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C. It was a great first job!\\" In 1976, Dobson began overseeing the business operations of the Albert Einstein Spacearium at the Smithsonian, and then running a r√©sum√© business in 1979. Dobson was hired as an editor at TSR, Inc. in December 1983, and moved to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin with his fianc√©e Debbie Singer, whom he had met in the resume business; they married on the Fourth of July in 1984. \\"The first three projects I worked on at TSR never appeared in print,\\" recalls Dobson. \\"I got a special satisfaction out of editing wargames. They were tough, but I loved the preciseness and detail.\\" The projects he edited included the Dragonlance series, as well as the Battlesystem fantasy combat supplement, which won the H.G. Wells Award at the 1986 Origins Game Fair. In 1985, Dobson was asked to join the Marketing Department and ended up as Marketing Manager. In March 1986, Dobson became the Director of Games Development. As a game designer, his credits included the four-module AD&D-game; Bloodstone Pass series with Douglas Niles, and X10, Red Arrow, Black Shield, both of which involved the Battlesystem rules; Dobson also co-designed the Partyzone Knave of Hearts game with Debbie. Dobson switched fields yet again to become a seminar leader in 1990, with authorship of several management books, tapes and videos to his credit, including several co-authored with his wife, Deborah Singer Dobson, who works in human resources. The publication of Fox on the Rhine in 2000 marked the beginnings of Dobson's forays into alternate history. In his RPG and alternate history books, he has frequently collaborated with Douglas Niles.

It is listed as endangered by the IUCN and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Description The Alabama waterdog is medium-sized at , with four toes and a laterally compressed tail. Its gills are permanent, bushy, and red. Typical adults exhibit a brown or black dorsum with minimal or no spotting, and the ventral side is white and often not spotted. Distribution and habitat The Alabama waterdog is found in the Appalachian headwaters of the Black Warrior River drainage basin in Alabama. Its range includes the Sipsey Fork and Brushy Creek in Winston County, the Mulberry Fork, Blackwater Creek, and Lost Creek in Walker County, the North River and Yellow Creek in Tuscaloosa County, and the Locust Fork and Blackburn Fork in Blount County. It is found in unsilted small and medium-sized streams in clay areas. It is more likely to be present when the larvae of the northern dusky salamander (Desmognathus fuscus) are present and less likely in streams where Asiatic mussels are abundant. The areas of dead leaves and detritus sometimes found in backwaters are important for this species. Diet N. alabamensis typically consumes invertebrates such as crayfish, amphipods, and insect larvae, as well as vertebrates such as small fish. Taxonomy The taxonomy of N. alabamensis is poorly understood. It is believed to be related to N. maculosus and N. beyeri. It is known to hybridize with N. beyeri, though electrophoretical evidence suggests they are separate species. Status The survival of N. alabamensis is threatened by habitat fragmentation and pollution and the IUCN has listed it as \\"Endangered\\". The quality of the water has deteriorated due to industrial, mining, agricultural, and urban pollution, and various impoundments have been made inhibiting its free movement. Even within the best habitats in their range, they are uncommon and their abundance may fluctuate. On 2 January 2018, the Alabama waterdog gained federal protection under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Along with its listing, 420 river miles of critical habitat gained protection from activities that could be injurious to the salamander. Parties wishing to undertake actions that may damage the salamander's critical habitat must now apply for a federal permit to do so. References=General references *Petranka, James W.

He has been the BBC's correspondent in Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, the Gaza Strip and Italy. He is based in London. Johnston was kidnapped in the Gaza Strip on 12 March 2007 by the militant group Army of Islam. He was unconditionally released on 4 July, nearly four months later, after much pressure was put on the group by the now-dominant Hamas. Early life Johnston was born in Lindi, Tanganyika (present-day Tanzania), to Scottish parents. Education Johnston was educated at the Dollar Academy, an independent school which is said to be the oldest co-educational day and boarding school in the world, in the small town of Dollar in Clackmannanshire in central Scotland, followed by the University of Dundee, where he graduated with an MA in English and politics. He also completed a diploma in Journalism Studies from Cardiff University. Career Johnston joined the BBC in 1991, and has spent eight years as a correspondent for them, including in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, as well as Kabul, Afghanistan. He was in Kabul when Afghanistan was still under the control of the Taliban. He was due to be the BBC's full- time correspondent in Gaza until 1 April 2007, and at the time of his kidnapping was the only foreign reporter with a major Western media organisation to still be based in the city. Johnston covered many major stories in Gaza for the BBC, including Israel's unilateral disengagement plan in 2005, Hamas winning the 2006 legislative elections, the 2006 Israel-Gaza conflict and the Palestinian factional violence of late 2006 to 2007. Johnston is highly regarded by the BBC as a respected, experienced journalist, and due to his local knowledge, he was someone other journalists would turn to for information when in Gaza. Prior to being kidnapped however, Johnston was not a journalist well known to the general public. Following his release he announced his intention to return to obscurity though, as of January 2008, he took over the presentation of the BBC World Service version of the programme From Our Own Correspondent. Johnston's BBC colleague Paul Adams noted that it was Johnston's \\"job to bring us day after day reports of the Palestinian predicament in the Gaza Strip.\\" Mustafa Barghouti, Palestinian Information Minister, has described Johnston as a \\"friend of our people\\", and said that Johnston \\"has done a lot for our cause.\\" Imprisoned Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti has also called Johnston a \\"friend of the Palestinian people\\". When not working as a correspondent, Johnston produced radio reports, one of which, on life after the Taliban, won a Sony Radio Academy Award bronze. Johnston has also worked as programme editor of The World Today and as a general reporter in the BBC World Service newsroom. From November 2011 to August 2014, Johnston was the BBC correspondent in Rome. From October 2014, Johnston has stated on his Twitter account (@AlanJohnstonBBC) that he is now based in London. The day after he was released, Johnston was awarded a prize by Amnesty International for his radio reports on human rights in Gaza, praising him for his \\"commitment to telling ordinary peoples' stories.\\" Kidnapping Alan Johnston banner at BBC TV Centre On 12 March 2007, Johnston was kidnapped by the Army of Islam. His captivity led to many protests worldwide. Hamas put immense pressure on the Army of Islam, including (according to a senior Hamas militant) the threat to hunt them down and kill them if they did not release Johnston.Time magazine 16 July 2007 issue. p. 15 On 4 July 2007, Johnston was freed. He was taken to meet Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh before leaving with an entourage of British diplomats to Jerusalem. Honours On 19 June 2008, the University of Dundee conferred an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws upon Johnston.

History Rear light in 1904 By the late 1830s, it was recognized that constructing a shipping channel through the delta at the mouth of the Saint Clair River would be an aid in shipping. An 1842 survey by the Corps of Topographical Engineers recommended dredging the channel, but due in part to opposition by President James K. Polk, no federal funds were appropriated for a decade. In 1852, $20,000 was appropriated for improvements, but the money was quickly spent with little result. Meanwhile, the opening of the St. Mary's Falls Ship Canal in Sault Ste. Marie increased shipping through the Great Lakes, and left the Saint Clair delta as the major bottleneck to commerce through the lakes. In the early 1850s, numerous ship ran aground in the area, often blocking the entire canal and preventing access by other ships. Congress voted to appropriate further funds for improvements in 1854, but President Franklin Pierce vetoed the bills, as he did again in 1855 and 1856. By this time, the problem was severe, and in 1856, Congress overrode the presidential veto, and $45,000 was appropriated. From this funding, the canal dredging was completed, and two lighthouses and a nearby beacon constructed at the mouth of the channel. The two lighthouses were completed by 1859. In 1866, a further $60,000 was appropriated for improvements. However, the United States Army Corps of Engineers recommended abandoning the current channel (known as the \\"south channel\\") and opening up a new Saint Clair Flats channel. This new channel was opened in 1870, after which the older channel became less important, but still used. In 1875, the front light began to lean. It was dismantled and rebuilt using the original stone and timber crib. By the early 20th century, the lights had become less useful, and in 1907 their use was discontinued. However, in 1915, the lights were re-established, and continued in use until 1934, when they were again discontinued. Despite the 1875 reconstruction, the front light began to lean further due to erosion near the base of the light. In 1990, the base was reinforced by constructing a steel cell and filling it with limestone for temporary support. In the fall of 1996, a permanent seawall was completed around the front light island. The rear light was constructed with a large keeper's house on the island surrounding the light. The house was demolished in the early 1930s. However, later vandalism has played a part in the overall deterioration of the rear light, which is also in need of major foundation work. Current restoration has been taking place on the rear light. Description The two range light towers are located in shallow water nearly a mile from the nearest land. The front range light is the smaller of the two, It is a cylindrical yellow brick tower, measuring 17 feet tall and tapering from 11 feet in diameter at the base to 10 feet in diameter in diameter at the top. It sits on a stone base atop a submerged timber crib structure. A single square-head door in the base of the tower leads to a circular iron staircase inside, which goes up to the lantern. The light originally had a ten-sided, iron lantern and an ornamental iron railing. These have disappeared, and the navigational light is now fitted with a plastic lens. The larger, rear range light is also a cylindrical, brick structure atop a square stone pier. It is constructed of off-white brick, slightly lighter in hue than the yellow brick of the other light. The tower measures about 40 feet tall, and the original, ten-sided, iron lantern remains in place. A round-head entrance in the base and a circular iron staircase leads to the lantern platform.

It has bright red but small and obscure flowers, and very soft, deeply divided, hairy leaves. Description A, A. sericeus mostly grows as an upright, spreading shrub but occasionally takes the habit of a small tree up to 5 m (16 ft) tall. It has erect branches that are covered in short hairs when young, but these are lost with age. Leaves may be up to 40 mm (1.6 in) long, and repeatedly divide by threes into from 5 to 50 narrow laciniae, circular in cross-section, with a diameter of less than 0.5 mm (0.02 in). Flowers are red, and occur alone or in small groups, hidden within the foliage at the end of branches. As with most other Proteaceae, each flower is composed of a tubular perianth of four united tepals, ending in a structure called a limb; and a single pistil, the stigma of which is initially trapped inside the limb, but is released at anthesis. In A. sericeus, the perianth is bright red, about 28 mm (1.1 in) long, hairy on the outside but smooth and hairless inside. The style is about 40 mm (1.6 in) long; being much longer than the perianth, it is very sharply bent for as long as the stigma remains trapped within the limb, and then springs erect. The fruit is an oval- shaped achene about 5 mm (0.2 in) long. Taxonomy=Discovery and naming This species was first described by Jacques Labillardi√®re in his 1805 Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen, under the name Adenanthos sericea. No explicit etymology for the specific name was given, but it is accepted that it is from the Latin sericeus (\\"silky\\"), in reference to the very soft foliage. Labillardi√®re did not acknowledge any collector, and so it was long thought that Labillardi√®re himself has collected the first botanical specimens. This was not obviously problematic, as A. sericeus does occur at Esperance Bay, where Labillardi√®re collected in December 1792. However, several Australian plant species described by Labillardi√®re do not occur in any locations that he visited, suggesting that some of his specimens were obtained from some other collector whom he failed to credit. This prompted a re-evaluation of the type material by Ernest Charles Nelson, who found several items of evidence suggesting that Labillardi√®re could not have collected the specimens that he apparently used to describe the species: * The specimens are labelled as having come from the herbarium of Ren√© Louiche Desfontaines, not that of Labillardi√®re * The specimens belong to the King George Sound form of the species (since published as A. sericeus subsp. sericeus), which Labillardi√®re could not have collected; whereas the Esperance Bay populations of this species belong to a distinctively different form (since published as A. sericeus subsp. sphalma). * Present-day Esperance Bay populations of A. sericeus are restricted to the granitic soils of Cape Le Grand at the extreme east of Esperance Bay, whereas Labillardi√®re collected only in the vicinity of Observatory Island and Observatory Point, 30 km (20 mi) west of Cape Le Grand at the extreme west of Esperance Bay, where the soils are not of granitic origin. Nelson concluded that Labillardi√®re could not have collected this species, instead attributing collection to Jean Baptiste Leschenault de la Tour, who visited King George Sound in 1803 as a member of Nicolas Baudin's voyage of exploration. This view has been accepted by some scholars though others treat it more cautiously. Infrageneric placement In 1870, George Bentham published the first infrageneric arrangement of Adenanthos in Volume 5 of his landmark Flora Australiensis. Bentham divided the genus into two sections, placing A. sericea in A. sect. Stenolaema because its perianth tube is straight and not swollen above the middle. This arrangement still stands today, though A. sect. Stenolaema is now renamed to the autonym A. sect. Adenanthos. Bentham also published a variety, A. sericea var. brevifolia (now A. macropodianus) based on specimens collected from Kangaroo Island in South Australia. This broad view of A. sericea continued into the 20th century, with several other species included in it, including A. oreophila and A. cygnorum. The current, narrower circumscription originated with Nelson's 1970 investigation of Adenanthos. Nelson was interested in the problem of why there are so many plant species with disjunct distribution patterns in southern Australia. One such species was A. sericea, the Kangaroo Island form of which occurred about 2500 km (1600 mi) east of the nearest population of the Western Australian variety. This led Nelson to undertake a full taxonomic revision of Adenanthos, in the course of which he concluded that the Kangaroo Island form of A. sericea warranted species rank, primarily because leaves are much smaller and have fewer laciniae than the Western Australian A. sericea. In 1978 he published A. macropodiana and synonymized A. sericea var. brevifolia with it. He also published A. oreophila and clarified confusion between A. sericea and A. cygnorum. Finally, Nelson refined Bentham's arrangement by dividing A. sect. Adenanthos into two subsections, with A. sericea placed into A. subsect. Adenanthos for reasons including the length of its perianth. However Nelson discarded his own subsections in his 1995 treatment of Adenanthos for the Flora of Australia series of monographs. By this time, the ICBN had issued a ruling that all genera ending in -anthos must be treated as having masculine gender; thus the specific epithet became sericeus. The placement of A. sericeus in Nelson's arrangement of Adenanthos may be summarised as follows: :Adenanthos ::A. sect. Eurylaema (4 species) ::A. sect. Adenanthos :::A. drummondii :::A. dobagii :::A. apiculatus :::A. linearis :::A. pungens (2 subspecies) :::A. gracilipes :::A. venosus :::A. dobsonii :::A. glabrescens (2 subspecies) :::A. ellipticus :::A. cuneatus :::A. stictus :::A. ileticos :::A. forrestii :::A. eyrei :::A. cacomorphus :::A. flavidiflorus :::A. argyreus :::A. macropodianus :::A. terminalis :::A. sericeus ::::A. sericeus subsp. sericeus ::::A. sericeus subsp. sphalma :::A. √ó cunninghamii :::A. oreophilus :::A. cygnorum (2 subspecies) :::A. meisneri :::A. velutinus :::A. filifolius :::A. labillardierei :::A. acanthophyllus Subspecies and hybrids Two subspecies are recognised: * A. sericeus subsp. sericeus is an autonym that encompasses the populations around King George Sound. The leaves of this subspecies are typically over 30 mm (1.2 in) long, and divided into many laciniae: average numbers range from 11 to 35, but individual leaves may have up to 50. * A. sericeus subsp. sphalma encompasses the populations at Cape Le Grand, which have smaller leaves typically divided into around 6 laciniae, and rarely more than 12. The existence of two subspecies was recognised by Nelson as early as 1975, but because of the confusion surrounding the type collection, Nelson treated this subspecies as encompassing the type material and therefore treated it as the autonymic subspecies. This error appeared in his doctoral thesis and on herbarium specimens annotations made by Nelson before 1977. This explains the subspecific epithet sphalma, from the Latin sphalmus (\\"mistake\\"). Adenanthos √ó cunninghamii is considered a hybrid between A. sericeus subsp. sericeus and A. cuneatus. It occurs in Torndirrup National Park and sometimes at Two Peoples Bay, and back-crosses with A. cuneatus have also been found in the vicinity of King George Sound. It can be distinguished from A. sericeus by its duller flowers, and by its foliage, which has very thick laciniae and, like, A. cuneatus, red new growth. Common names Common names for A. sericeus include Woollybush‚Äîa name applied to all Adenanthos species with deeply divided foliage‚Äîand various qualifications of this, including Coastal Woollybush, Tall Woollybush, and Albany Woollybush. However the last of these also refers to A. √ó cunninghamii, and Nelson has referred to it as \\"[a] name... so confused it is now almost useless.\\" In the cut flower industry, which values its silvery foliage, the common names Smoke Bush and Australian Smoke Bush have also been used. In Australian nurseries, it is sold under the name Silver Streak as a popular hedge plant for domestic gardens and landscaping.Specialty Trees - Adenanthos sericeus ' Silver Streak' Distribution and habitat Adenanthos sericeus has a disjunct distribution spanning about 500 km (300 mi) of the south coast of Western Australia. A. sericeus subsp. sericeus occurs mostly around King George Sound, extending west as far as Torbay Inlet and east almost to Cape Riche; it sometimes occurs very close to the sea. There is then a gap of over 300 km (200 mi) to the populations of A. sericeus subsp. sphalma at Cape Le Grand. Another group of A. sericeus subsp. sphalma occurs 100 km (60 mi) further east at Cape Arid. Both subspecies are calcifuge, occurring only in siliceous sands derived from weathered granite. Thus most populations are associated with granite monadnocks. Though its range is restricted, it is locally common and often dominant. A. sericeus subsp. sphalma is often found in association with Nuytsia floribunda, Kunzea baxteri, and Xanthorrhoea species. Ecology Both subspecies flower throughout the year, though A. sericeus subsp. sphalma flowers most between August and December. It is susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback. Cultivation Foliage with flowers Though its flowers are inconspicuous, A. sericeus is considered an attractive garden plant for the colour and texture of its dense foliage. Its high tolerance of salt-laden winds makes it an excellent screen plant in coastal areas. In the Albany area, branches or entire potted plants are used as Christmas trees, since young plants are shaped like small pine trees but have a silky feel. One study of application of controlled-release fertiliser to A. sericeus in pots found it benefited from increasing levels of fertiliser, whereas other species plateaued at lower levels. Propagation is by cuttings. These strike readily, but care must be taken not to mist the foliage too much, or it will rot. It requires very good drainage, and performs poorly in humid areas. Lacking a lignotuber, it tolerates only light pruning. Several cultivars have become available, including two developed and propagated in Israel. The silvery foliage is used commercially in the cut flower industry. It has an unusually long vase life: tests have yielded a vase life of 30 days, regardless of treatment or time of year.

It has attracted critical attention primarily for the question of James Shirley's participation in its authorship. Date and performance The play's date of authorship and its performance history are not known in detail; it was performed at the Blackfriars Theatre by the King's Men, and is plausibly dated to c. 1639-40.Perry, p. 110. The Country Captain was revived early in the Restoration period. Samuel Pepys saw it performed on 21 October 1661. In his Diary he called it \\"so silly a play as in all my life I never saw\\" -- though this negative verdict did not prevent Pepys from seeing the play again on 25 November that year, on 14 August 1667 and on 14 May 1668.Perry, p. 108. Texts The play was first printed in a duodecimo volume that included Newcastle's play The Variety, issued by the booksellers Humphrey Moseley and Humphrey Robinson in 1649. That first edition attributes the plays only to \\"a person of honor,\\" though Newcastle's authorship is stated in 17th- century sources.Perry, p. 112. The Country Captain also exists in a manuscript, Harleian MS. 7650 in the collection of the British Museum; the MS. is judged to be in the hand of Edward Knight, the prompter of the King's Men. The two texts are very similar though not identical; the manuscript appears to be the original authorial version, while the printed text shows the cuts and changes that adjusted the play for stage performance.Perry, pp. 102-4. Authorship A. H. Bullen edited the play, from the manuscript, for the second volume of his series Old English Plays (1883) -- apparently unaware of the 1649 printed text. Bullen followed J. O. Halliwell-Philips in titling the play Captain Underwit, and attributed the work to James Shirley. Subsequent critics and scholars have almost universally concluded that Bullen went too far to assigning the entire play to Shirley, and have judged that Newcastle \\"is almost certainly the author of this comedy.\\"Albert Wertheim, quoted in Logan and Smith, p. 167. But most have accepted the view that Shirley had some hand in helping Newcastle to write the play.Forsythe, pp. 420-4; Nason, p. 153; Perry, pp. 102-13. Some have speculated a connection with a lost play by Shirley titled Look to the Lady, which was entered into the Stationers' Register on 11 March 1640 but never published -- \\"Look to the Lady\\" being a reasonable alternative title for the drama (see the Synopsis below). The relationship between Cavendish and Shirley is clear from 17th-century sources. In his Athenae Oxoniensis, Anthony √† Wood wrote that \\"our author Shirley did also much assist his generous patron William duke of Newcastle in the composition of certain plays, which the duke afterwards published.\\"Wood quoted in Perry, p. 102. Shirley also dedicated his tragedy The Traitor to Newcastle upon its 1635 publication. The signs of Shirley's hand in The Country Captain are abundant and varied; they range from parallels of plot device and characterization to specific phrasings. For examples of the latter: The Country Captain employs the phrase \\"feather-footed Hours,\\" which also occurs in two of Shirley's masques, The Triumph of Beauty and The Triumph of Peace.Forsythe, p. 401. The line \\"That snorts at Spain by an instinct of Nature\\" can be found both in The Country Captain and in Shirley's The Bird in a Cage.Perry, p. 106. A verse beginning \\"Come let us throw the dice,\\" which is used as a drinking song in the play, is printed in Shirley's Poems (1646). Synopsis Sir Richard Huntlove is an elderly aristocrat who is jealous of his beautiful and vivacious young wife. His jealousy is more valid than he realizes, for Lady Huntlove is planning an affair with a gentleman named Sir Francis Courtwell. To distance his wife from the temptations of London, Sir Richard moves his household to his country estate -- along with a gaggle of followers and hangers-on, including: Lady Huntlove's otherwise-unnamed Sister; Sir Francis Courtwell and his nephew, the younger Courtwell being in love with the Sister; Captain Underwit, Sir Richard's stepson by his first wife; Engine, a \\"projector\\" or speculator; Device, a \\"fantastical gallant;\\" and Captain Sacksbury, a drunken old soldier. Captain Underwit has just received a commission in the local militia, and Captain Sacksbury is his mentor. Lady Huntlove's maid Dorothy is also present; she intends to become Mrs. Capt. Underwit. Sir Francis arranges a meeting with Lady Huntlove; he fakes indisposition when Sir Richard goes hunting. Sir Richard returns unexpectedly and catches the two together -- but Lady Huntlove manages to convince her husband that she is sleepwalking. The would-be lovers try for a second assignation: the Lady pretends to be pacing the floor with a toothache, and when her husband is asleep Dorothy slips into bed in her place and Lady Huntlove goes to Sir Francis. But the gentleman, tired of waiting, has fallen asleep. For their third attempt, Sir Francis intends to fake a riding accident while he and Sir Richard are going to London, and so return to the estate without the husband. He falls off his horse in reality, though, and injures himself seriously; and he takes this as a bad omen and turns penitent. The younger Courtwell has better luck in courting Lady Huntlove's Sister -- though at first she mocks and ridicules him, and he responds in kind. Paradoxically, the Sister is provoked by Courtwell's subsequent coolness; the two end up married. Dorothy sends a false letter to Sir Richard, indicating that she, Dorothy, is a runaway, and the daughter of a rich knight. Captain Underwit marries her in the belief that she's a good catch...and later finds out the truth. A supply of more blatant comedy is provided by Engine, who has to feign lunacy to escape the consequences of his previous financial manipulations and swindles. In addition to a wide range of commonalities with Shirley's plays,Forsythe, pp. 424, 426-9. The Country Captain shows debts to the drama of Ben Jonson. This is unsurprising, since Newcastle was a patron and friend of Jonson, and on the basis of his plays is often included in the so-called Sons of Ben, the group of self-styled imitators of the master.

Bryan had left her home in Greencastle on January 28, 1896 under the pretense that she was visiting a friend in Indianapolis.  Convictions  Bryan's body was found headless just behind what is now the YMCA in Fort Thomas, Kentucky on February 1, 1896 by a 17 year old farm hand named Johnny Hewling. According to the presiding coroner, she was found with multiple wounds across her back and her hands. He also indicated that she was decapitated while still alive. She was five months pregnant at the time of her death. Her body was identified by the tag in her custom-made shoes from Greencastle, Indiana.JACKSON AND WALLING DIE; Execution at Newport, Ky. March 21, 1897 New York Times Pearl Bryan's headless body is buried in the family plot at Forest Hill Cemetery in Greencastle. Scott Jackson, a dental student at the Ohio College of Dental Surgery was soon arrested for the murder, and later implicated fellow student and roommate Alonzo M. Walling. During the trial it was revealed that Jackson had a secret romance with Bryan for several months prior to her murder. Allegedly, on January 31, 1896, Jackson and Walling slipped cocaine into Bryan‚Äôs drink while they were at a saloon in Cincinnati and proceeded to murder her later that night. An analysis of Bryan‚Äôs stomach showed that there was indeed cocaine present in the organ at the time of her death. In response to the location of Bryan‚Äôs head, Jackson and Walling gave several answers, such as at the bottom of the Ohio River and in a sandbar in Dayton, Kentucky. The nearby Covington waterworks and parts of the Miami and Erie Canal were also drained in search of her head. However, investigations in these places turned up nothing. When interviewed in 1937, former detective Cal Crim of the Cincinnati Police Department theorized that Jackson and Walling burned her head in a furnace of the dental college that they attended. To this day, her head has never been uncovered. Jackson's trial begun April 21 and ended on May 14th, 1897. Walling's trial began on May 26th and ended July 18th of the same year. Both were convicted of first degree murder and hanged in the morning of March 20, 1897 behind the Newport Campbell County Courthouse on York Street, just south of the Taylor-Southgate bridge. According to reports, both Jackson and Walling survived the initial drop that was supposed to break their necks, and instead were strangled to death some minutes after. They were the last people hanged in Newport. The gallows located behind the courthouse were torn down following the execution. The case was very popular nationally at the time, provoking citizens to take souvenirs from the crime scene (even branches), and buy Pearl Bryan \\"merchandise\\" from a store near the Newport Courthouse. One report says the trial was \\"theatrical.\\" Local newspapers dubbed the case \\"the trial of the century\\". The actual double-hanging was urged to be done hastily due to the threat of a public lynching by friends and relatives of Bryan. Jim Reis, author, historian and well known reporter and columnist for the Kentucky Post, in an article titled \\"Pieces of the Past,\\" relates that even during a jail break at the Newport jail, the two men remained in their cell in fear of being lynched and were heavily protected.  Popular culture  In the 1910's and the 1920's, several folk songs surrounding the murder were created and popularized. The first of which to be recorded was by American county singer Vernon Dalhart in 1926. A year later, in 1927, folk singer Bradley Kincaid recorded a song named \\"Pearl Bryan\\" on the topic of the murder. Folk singers Dick Burnett and Leonard Rutherford also recorded their own versions in the same era. by In 2001, San Francisco based folklore band The Crooked Jades also recorded a song that focused on the murder. An episode of Ghost Adventures explored Bryan's murder and claims of supernatural activity at Bobby Mackey's Music World. The Ghost Adventures crew claim an Ovilus device allowed them to contact the spirit of Scott Jackson and hear him confess to the murder. It is featured in an episode of Most Terrifying Places in America. The case was also featured in an episode of the PRX podcast Criminal, which focused on the many versions of a folk song about the murder. The BuzzFeed Unsolved episode called The Ghosts and Demons Of Bobby Mackey's reviewed part of Pearl's murder.

Background Bilbao was the capital of the autonomous Basque area established by the Republic after the war began to reward Basque nationalist support of the Republic. The Basque people in Spain generally inhabit four provinces: Navarre, √Ålava, Gipuzkoa and Biscay. The Basque nationalists were dominant in the last two provinces. Navarre and √Ålava had rallied to the rising against the Republic. The Spanish Nationalist troops gained Gipuzkoa early in the war with the fall of Ir√∫n in August and San Sebasti√°n on 13 September 1936, isolating the Basque Country and the zone held by the Northern Republicans from the French border. On 31 March, the Nationalists, led by the General Emilio Mola, launched an offensive against Biscay Province. The Basque troops had to retire, and by June, the Nationalists had reached the outskirts of Bilbao. Battle By 11 June 1937 the Basque forces had fallen back to the city of Bilbao, which was defended by a series of rushed fortifications called the \\"Bilbao's Iron Ring\\". It was poorly designed for defence.Gabriel Jackson, pp. 380-384. It was quite a antiquated concept, akin to First World War fortifications, and so was vulnerable to modern warfare and weapons, such as aircraft and artillery, and only 30,000 troops were defending it (it was conceived to be defended by 70,000). Therefore the Iron Ring was rather easily overcome by Nationalist forces. Josu CHUECA: ¬´Burdin Gerrikoa puskatuta¬ª, 36ko Gerra orain. Imanol VILLA: ¬´El Cintur√≥n de Hierro¬ª, El Correo, 2007-02-11. The ring was breached by an infantry assault supported by heavy air and artillery bombardment (150 guns and 70 bombers). On 12 June, the Spanish Republican Army launched a diversionary attack against Huesca to stop the Nationalist offensive, but the Nationalist troops continued their advance. On the night of 13 June, the defenders evacuated most of the civilian population from the city. On 18 June, General Ulibarri withdrew his remaining troops from Bilbao, and the Nationalists occupied the city on the following day. The city's bridges had been destroyed to hinder the attackers, but the city remained mostly intact.

This theory is the basis of a number of unfounded claims and scams. History The first torsion field proposals were proposed in the late Soviet Union by a group of physicists in the 1980s who loosely based their ideas on Einstein‚ÄìCartan theory and some variant solutions of Maxwell's equations that do not have a solid grounding in scientific fact. The group, led by Anatoly Akimov and Gennady Shipov,Gennady Shipov homepage began the research as the state- sponsored Center for Nontraditional Technologies. They disbanded in 1991 when their research was exposed by physicist as a fraud and an embezzlement of government funding. Akimov and Shipov received financing for torsion field research from the Russian Ministry of Science from 1992 to 1995 and from the Russian Ministry of Defense from 1996 to 1997, and secretly continued their research, with a private enterprise called The International Institute for Theoretical and Applied Physics (later called UVITOR).UVITOR at shipov.com Presently championed exclusively outside of reputable scientific research due to its lack of evidence and absence of sound theoretical underpinning, the theory has been used to proclaim faster-than-light travel (FTL), extra-sensory perception (ESP), homeopathy, levitation, and other paranormal phenomena, and has been used to provide a rationale for the purported functioning of miracle cures and similar products. These claims have no independent backing.  Description  In physics, a field is an assignment of a quantity (vector, tensor, or spinor) to every point of the space containing it. The word \\"torsion\\" refers to any variable that describes rotation. Thus, torsion fields (i.e., fields of any physical value reasonably described as \\"torsion\\") do exist in established physics aside from in this pseudoscientific case, where the terms have been misappropriated. For example, an electromagnetic wave with circular polarization or the stress tensor of a solid body under torsion stress can be described as torsion fields, although such usage is rare. The torsion tensor is a quantity in general relativity, and plays an important role in Einstein‚ÄìCartan theory. Spinor fields, in particular fermionic fields, are existing concepts from particle physics and quantum field theory. Advocates for the existence of the spinor field or torsion field as described here claim that spin-spin interaction itself a well-studied quantum phenomenon can be transmitted through space similar to electromagnetic waves, but transmitting no mass or energy but only information, and does so at speeds of up to a billion times the speed of light, in explicit violation of special relativity. At the same time they claim that spin-spin interaction is carried by neutrinos which have very little mass and high energy and interact with matter through the weak interaction that it does not interact with matter but, at the same time, can be generated and detected easily. (in Russian) (English title: )  Claimed applications  Despite the several obvious contradictions with established physics along with associated statements by believers criticized as being \\"nonsensical\\" by reputable scientists, torsion fields have been embraced as an explanation for claims of homeopathic cures, telepathy, telekinesis, levitation, clairvoyance, ESP, and other paranormal phenomena. The harnessing of torsion fields has been claimed to make everything possible from miracle cure devices (including devices that cure alcohol addiction) to working perpetual motion machines, stargates, UFO propulsion analogs, and weapons of mass destruction (WMDs). Some such devices, in particular the miracle cure boxes, have been patented, manufactured and sold.  Funding of torsion-field-related projects  Proponents of torsion field have sought large-scale government and military contracts at different times, starting with the 1987 application to the Ministry of Defence of the USSR requesting funding to develop \\"highly-reliable detection of an enemy strategic weapons (ICBM, nuclear submarine, aircraft, etc.); the long-range destruction of enemy strategic weapons without contact; covert jamming- resistant communications with objects in outer space, on Earth, underground, and underwater; mobile equipment on gravitational principles; and psychophysical and biomedical influence on troops and the population\\" The Soviet government allocated 500 million rubles (about US$7 million at today's exchange rate) for this research. Another example of such funding applications was an experiment conducted in 1994 by the Russian private research group \\"VENT\\" (VEnture for Non-traditional Technologies,) which claimed to lower the resistivity of copper to as little as 1/80 of its normal value after exposing it to a torsion field generator. The group applied to the government of the Russian Federation for funding to open a factory, and promised great savings in energy consumption. The samples of exposed and unexposed copper were independently tested in presence of a VENT representative and their resistivities were not only found to be identical [(2.08¬±0.02)√ó10‚àí7 Œ©m and (2.05¬±0.02)√ó10‚àí7 Œ©m], but worse than industrial copper as well (1.7√ó10‚àí8 Œ©m). In 2002, an application was made for oil drilling licenses in Russia and the UK using \\"microlepton technologies\\". In 2011, National Research Council of Thailand approved a 4 million baht (around $130,000) fund for \\"Torsion Field Technologies\\" research at Chulalongkorn University.

Biography Joseph Sunnen (June 16, 1897‚ÄìApril 1979) was born in the coal mining town of Thayer, Illinois. He left school in the 7th grade to help on the family farm. At age 17 he purchased a Missouri lead mine with family savings, however this failed and his brother Gus offered him employment in his automobile garage in Mexico, Missouri. In 1923, at age 21, Sunnen applied for his first of nearly 100 patents, a valve lifter tool, marking the beginnings of Sunnen Company. However that same year he was nearly killed in a work explosion which burnt most of his body, and spent a year recovering. He returned to his brother's garage for employment and while in Mexico, Missouri, met and married Miss Cornelia Miller. They moved to St. Louis to pursue Sunnen's manufacturing ambitions in 1924. There Sunnen converted a 1916 Hupmobile into a camper and set out on the road to sell 500 of his new valve lifter tools. They sold two or three tools a day until they reached Mankato, Minnesota where a large distributor of shop tools bought his remaining stock and placed an order for 1,000 additional tools. Following the trip Sunnen returned home to build his manufacturing business around the auto engine rebuilding trade. The Sunnen Company grew to become a renowned global manufacturer of precision honing devices, and holds a position of global prominence to this day. In 1946 Joseph Sunnen made a generous donation to the Ozarks YMCA, and subsequently formed the Sunnen Foundation for further charitable projects. Sunnen's children and grandchildren continue to use the Sunnen Foundation as a vehicle for charity, with a particular emphasis on First Amendment rights, reproductive rights and youth services.

This group was named by Thomas Holtz, who defined it as \\"the most recent common ancestor of Ornithomimus and birds, and all descendants of that common ancestor.\\" Fossil evidence Many fossils have been discovered in recent years, particularly in China. Many of the feathered dinosaurs belong to this clade. In particular, a fossil of the Alvarezsauridae Shuvuuia has a version of keratin consistent with that of avian feathers. Many nearly complete fossil maniraptoriforms are known from the late Jurassic. Archaeopteryx is known from Bavaria at 155-150 Ma. Ornitholestes, the troodontid Hesperornithoides, Coelurus fragilis and Tanycolagreus topwilsoni are all known from the Morrison Formation in Wyoming at about 150 Ma. The Daohugou biota, including Anchiornis and Epidexipteryx, is the earliest record of maniraptoriformes, dating to about 160 Ma. One possible maniraptoriform, Eshanosaurus, lived even earlier, during the Early Jurassic, though its identification is controversial. The wide range of fossils in the early Cretaceous and morphological evidence suggests that the main branches of maniraptoriform differentiation were separate before the end of the Jurassic. Until recently, the relatives of Tyrannosaurus were thought to be maniraptoriforms,Benton, Michael J. (2004) Vertebrate Palaentology . 3rd ed. Wiley. but this now seems unlikely.Weishampel, David B., Dodson, Peter, and Osm√≥lska, Halszka (2004) The Dinosauria. University of California Press. History of study In 1994, a study by paleontologist Thomas Holtz found a close relationship between the Ornithomimosauria and Troodontidae, and named this group Bullatosauria. Holtz rejected this hypothesis in 1999, and most paleontologists now consider troodontids to be much more closely related to either birds or Dromaeosauridae than they are to ornithomimosaurs, causing the Bullatosauria to be abandoned. The name referred to the inflated (bulbous) sphenoid both groups shared. Holtz defined the group as the clade containing the most recent common ancestor of Troodon and Ornithomimus and all its descendants. The concept is now considered redundant, and the clade Bullatosauria is now viewed as synonymous with Maniraptoriformes. In 2002, Gregory S. Paul named an apomorphy-based clade Avepectora, defined to include all theropods with a bird-like arrangement of the pectoral bones, where the angled shoulder girdle (coracoids) come in contact with the breastbone (sternum). According to Paul, ornithomimosaurs are the most basal members of this group.Paul, G.S. (2002). Dinosaurs of the Air: The Evolution and Loss of Flight in Dinosaurs and Birds. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. . In 2010, Paul used Avepectora for a smaller clade, excluding ornithomimosaurs, compsognathids and alvarezsauroids.Paul, G. S. (2010).

The court held that the silence of an accused cannot be given any independent weight. Background A building manager found two young men, one named Sean Jeffrey Noble, in the building's parking lot. One was attempting to break into a car using a screwdriver. He asked for identification from Noble, who provided his driver's licence. The manager held onto the licence and called the police. At trial, neither the manager nor anyone else could identify Noble. The trial judge ruled that as the trier of fact he could look at the licence given to the manager and see that it was the accused in the picture on the licence. He also ruled that the manager would have looked carefully at the licence at the time of the alleged crime. He noted that the driver's licence made a much tougher case to meet by the accused, yet the accused remained silent. The judge drew a negative inference from this silence and said it could add strength to the Crown's case.R v Noble, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 874 Noble was convicted, but his conviction was set aside on appeal. The Crown then appealed to the Supreme Court. Ruling of the Court Justice Sopinka, writing for the majority, dismissed the Crown's appeal.

He was a member of the Board (1970-1984) of International Children's Centre in Paris, and he had been a member of the Board of Regents of the International Association for Humanitarian Medicine since 2000. Professor ƒ∞hsan Doƒüramacƒ± co-founded the Assembly of the Parliament of Cultures with Prince Hassan of Jordan and joined members from many nations in Ankara in 2004. The purpose of the Foundation is to promote and strengthen international and intercultural understanding among different cultures in the world and to enhance dialogue between their thinkers and intellectuals by means of peaceful dialogue.

He was a major financial charitable contributor to the UNICEF co- sponsored Turkish educational community campaign \\"Let's Go to School, Girls\\".  Turkey  ƒ∞hsan Doƒüramacƒ± matured in the secular Turkey of Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk. This was a political environment which Doƒüramacƒ± endeavored to help develop, with his focus being medicine and child health. He also saw higher education a parallel concern. He set out on the path to reform these fields, a path filled with obstacles of bureaucratic, legal and self-interested opposition by several circles. Sir Horace Phillips described him in his book: 'This is a likeable man, emphatic in manner, but gentle with it; sometimes intolerant of those who do not share his ideals. But he has not been spoiled by his achievements.'  Administratorship  Doƒüramacƒ± was the founding President of the Council of Higher Education of Turkey (Y√ñK) from 1981 until 1992. He chaired the Board of Trustees in Middle East Technical University in 1965 and held the rector position in Ankara University in 1963 and several other universities in Turkey.  Hacettepe University  After a rapid rise at academia, Doƒüramacƒ± became a Professor of pediatrics in 1955. In the same year Prof. Doƒüramacƒ± founded The Child Health Department affiliated with Ankara University Medical School. In 1958 the Child Health Institute and Hospital started to serve the community as well as its researches and education. In 1961 School of Health Sciences was founded as the first instance of school healthcare science in Turkey. Subsequent to the establishment of some other departments such as dentistry, home economics the institute became another higher education center affiliated with Ankara University Medical School and thus in 1967 the Hacettepe University was founded officially. After the establishments of some other departments under Hacettepe University, a need for a larger educational building complex aroused. ƒ∞hsan Doƒüramacƒ± endowed a considerable amount to foundations named Hacettepe Education Foundation and Hacettepe Health Foundation. Thanks to these donations the new campus for Hacettepe University was built rapidly. Presently, Hacettepe University is one of the best state universities in Turkey in medicine-related areas.  Bilkent University  After the legislation allowing establishment of private universities in Turkey upon Doƒüramacƒ±'s request and effort, he began his searches to found a private, campus university. Afterwards in 1984 between Middle East Technical University and Hacettepe University campuses the first private university of Turkey, Bilkent University was founded. Doƒüramacƒ± founded some industrial companies such as Tepe construction to build educational buildings and to provide financial support for the university as well. All the companies incorporated under Bilkent Holding are now one of the major corporate group of Turkey. All companies were endowed to the Bilkent University. Doƒüramacƒ±'s all heirs relinquished their rights to the companies. By this act, he donated nearly his whole fortune to the university. Bilkent University is now one of the best universities nationwide and according to Times Higher Education World University Rankings, Bilkent is the 112. best university worldwide. Affiliated with Bilkent University, Doƒüramacƒ± had some other educational projects. The first of his university level education centers of excellence (the opening of which had been his most recent project) was inaugurated in Erzurum (Bilkent Erzurum Laboratory High School) in 2007 followed by three other centers in East and Southeast Turkey. Professor ƒ∞hsan Doƒüramacƒ± also provided charitable financial private scholarship support to university students in medical sciences and music for over 40 years. The Turkish Foreign Policy Institute of Bilkent University administers an award program of ƒ∞hsan Doƒüramacƒ± Prize of International Relations for Peace. Doƒüramacƒ±, with his wife, Ayser Doƒüramacƒ±, endowed their family wealth to the support of educational and medical projects. In more recent times the Founder had turned his attention to the place of his birth, Erbil. The vision of the Ihsan Dogramaci Erbil Foundation was to build a needed and unique school in a region that has had a troubled history. After the completion of construction, the first students of ƒ∞hsan Doƒüramacƒ± Bilkent Erbil College began classes in 2010. Personal life His father Doƒüramacƒ±zade Ali Pasha was the Mayor of Erbil and later a Senator in Baghdad; his grandfather Mehmet Ali Kirdar was a Member of the Ottoman Parliament for Kirkuk. Doƒüramacƒ± was married to Ayser S√ºleyman in 1942. He had three children. His son, Professor Ali Doƒüramacƒ± was the Rector of Bilkent University until 1 March 2010. Currently his grandson- in-law Prof. Dr. Abdullah Atalar is the rector. Death ƒ∞hsan Dogramaci died at Hacettepe University Hospital on 25 February 2010 from multiple organ failure.

Early years Born to W.H. Helm of Dumfries, Alexander Knox Helm was educated at Dumfries Academy and King's College, Cambridge. Career In 1912, he passed the examination for what was then called second division clerkships and was appointed to the Foreign Office. He served as a member of the East Registry. A keen volunteer when World War I broke out, he was allowed by the Foreign Office to join his field artillery unit, being promoted second lieutenant in 1917 and serving in that capacity in Palestine. As a humble clerk, he had performed only routine duties but distinguished himself through his assiduity and retentive memory. Thus, when the war ended he was selected under the special recruitment scheme for filling vacancies caused by the war and appointed to the Levant Consular Service. After a short period of training in Oriental languages at King's College, Cambridge, he went as Vice-Consul to Thessaloniki, and soon after became third Dragoman at Constantinople. When the Turkish capital moved to Ankara and the office of Dragoman was abolished, Helm went there as Second Secretary. He served there as Consul, and in 1930 was transferred to the Foreign Office, working in the Eastern Department. In 1937 he was sent as Consul to Addis Ababa and at the outbreak of World War II was moved to the British Embassy at Washington, D.C., where he handled the various complicated problems connected with the supply of petroleum to the United Kingdom.

Hospitals In 1989, there were around 899 public health institutions, including state hospital, twelve district hospitals, 189 primary health centres, besides mainstream \\"Western\\" and ayurvedic dispensaries and specialized medical institutions. In order to meet the shortage of doctors, a medical college was established in 1967, which is having post-graduate teaching facilities in some branches. Death rate has now come down by 70% due to numerous public health measures. The incidence of venereal disease, which was roughly about 17% in 1951, has now came down to 2% in 1989. Diseases like malaria and small pox has been eradicated. The Tuberculosis control programme has been a great success. People have taken a keen interest in the family planning programme. One of its interesting feature is that women have outnumbered men in its acceptance.Webindia123.com Education In 1948 the state had only 200 educational institutions, out of which most of them were primary schools. In 1989 the state had 9,112 educational institutions including 38 colleges, 932 high secondary and high schools, 1,068 middle schools and 7,074 primary schools. The enrollment in these institutions was nearly 1,122,000 or about 26% of the entire state. The literacy percentage which was just 6.7% in 1951 and 31.32% in 1971, raised to 42.48% in 1989 and in 1991 it further reached to 63.54%. Himachal got its first university in 1971. Then 2 more universities, one for agriculture and the other for horticulture and forestry were established at Palampur and Solan, respectively. Water supply Drinking water supply poses a major problem in the state. Because of high altitude terrain and undulating topography drinking water is mainly obtained from streams. The pollution, lack of sanitation and open air defecation, leads to contamination of surface water. Water pollutants create a wide variety of problems by entering into the food chain. Over-exploitation of natural resources and dumping of hazardous wastes further aggravates the problem. Being unhygienic, it results to pollution and can spread diseases like hill dysentery. Since villages are sparsely populated and distantly located, the arrangement of drinking water leads to the problem of high costs. In 1948, except 4 towns, no other habitation in the state had piped water supply. By 1989, drinking water through pipes was made available in about 15,000 villages covering about 75% of the state population. Now alternate sources -underground water has been tapped through handpumps. Under ARWSP, the following norms are being adopted for providing drinking water to rural population in the habitations : 40 litres per capita per day of safe drinking water for human beings. 30 litres per capita per day additional for cattle in the desert development programme areas. One hand pump or stand post for every 250 persons. The water source should exist within 1.6 km in the plains and within 100 metres elevation in the hilly areas. [Water is defined as safe if it is free from biological contamination (cholera, typhoid, etc.) and chemical contamination (excess arsenic, fluoride, salinity, iron, nitrates, etc.)] Habitations which have a safe drinking water source point (either private or public) within 1.6 km in plains and 100 metre in hill areas but the capacity of the system ranges between 10 lpcd to 40 lpcd, are categorized as partially covered and those having less than 10 litres per capita per day are categorized as not covered. All the 16807 census villages have been provided with drinking water facilities. An ambitious project, under the Bharat Nirman Yojna, more than 40107 habitations are fully covered March 2006 and remaining 5260 partially covered habitations to be provided drinking water facility by March 2007.

History While JavaScript, as first developed by Netscape (and later Mozilla), has long had a presence on the Web for many websites, it gained a particular pitch with the rise of the Web 2.0 era of computing, in which JavaScript became increasingly used for the development of user interfaces for applications, both web-based and desktop- based. JavaScript was also combined with CSS to create dynamic web pages, which have also become popular as a more efficient and accessible alternative to Flash-based websites. Libraries With the expanded demands for JavaScript, an easier means for programmers to develop such dynamic interfaces was needed. Thus, JavaScript libraries and JavaScript widget libraries were developed, allowing for developers to concentrate more upon more distinctive applications of Ajax. This has led to other companies and groups, such as Microsoft and Yahoo! developing their own JavaScript-based user interface libraries, which find their way into the web applications developed by these companies. Some JavaScript libraries allow for easier integration of JavaScript with other web development technologies, such as CSS, PHP, Ruby, and Java. Many libraries include code to detect differences between runtime environments, and remove the need for applications to allow for such inconsistencies. Almost all JavaScript libraries are released under either a copycenter or copyleft license to ensure license-free distribution, usage, and modification. Frameworks Some JavaScript libraries, such as Angular, are classified as frameworks since they exhibit full-stack capabilities and properties not found in general JavaScript libraries.

An outdoor lifestyle center, named FlatIron Village; extends out of the mall's southern side and is anchored by a 14-screen AMC Theatres cinema and several restaurants. Others stores at the mall include 2nd & Charles, Crate & Barrel, Williams Sonoma, Pottery Barn, H&M;, and Old Navy. History FlatIron Crossing opened on August 11, 2000 after two years of construction, anchored by Lord & Taylor, Galyan's, Foley's, Dillard's, and Nordstrom. The mall's hybrid layout, with an outdoor extension attached to an indoor mall, was unique at opening and was one of the first of its kind in the United States. In 2001, a propane-powered shuttle bus began circulating passengers free of charge between FlatIron Crossing and its adjacent shopping centers, Flatiron Marketplace and MainStreet at Flatiron. Funded by the Flatiron Improvement District sales tax surcharge, it stopped at 14 points along a route used only by pedestrians, bicycles, and the shuttle itself. It ceased operation in 2008, and in 2015 portions of the shuttle route were repurposed for the bikeway constructed as part of the U.S. route 36 express lanes project. Although the mall is among the highest sales per square foot in the country , the mall had for many years after opening encountered several setbacks, particularly with the outdoor village area. The outdoor village area was originally populated by independent boutiques poached from nearby Boulder's Pearl Street Mall, alongside a Borders bookstore and several restaurants.http://extras.denverpost.com/business/biz0524h.htm An AMC cinema meant to anchor the Village opened more than a year late, leaving the outdoor area without a major draw and causing most of those independent tenants to leave.http://www.coloradodaily.com/ci_13056893 Structural issues caused by shifting soil beneath the Village caused other tenants to leave soon after, rendering the outdoor mall partially vacant. Many of those vacant buildings were demolished not soon after, while the bankruptcy of Borders left the outdoor mall with only the cinema and a handful of restaurants. A planned redevelopment of the village was floated in 2008, including a 140-room hotel, but was canceled in favor of a much more modest overhaul completed in 2013. Galyan's was acquired by Dick's Sporting Goods in 2004, leading Dick's to convert the FlatIron Crossing store to their own nameplate.http://www.deseretnews.com/article/595072078/Dicks-Sporting-Goods- to-buy-Galyans-for-305-million.html?pg=all Foley's was converted to Macy's in 2005, as a result of the merger between Foley's parent company May Department Stores and Macy's parent Federated Department Stores.https://money.cnn.com/2005/02/28/news/fortune500/federated_may/ The Lord & Taylor location also closed in 2005 citing a weak and competitive regional marketplace.https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/31/business/lord-taylor- to-shut-stores-and-cut-jobs.html In 2009, The vacant Lord & Taylor building was split into three tenants: Forever 21 on the upper level, and Ultimate Electronics and The Container Store splitting the lower level.http://www.broomfieldenterprise.com/news/ci_12974675 Borders and Ultimate Electronics closed in 2011.

In August 1974, CFFC President Joan Harriman asked him to travel with her to Marlboro, Massachusetts, to baptize a baby whose local priests refused to perform the rite. The baby's mother, 20-year-old Carol Morreale, had been interviewed regarding an \\"abortion-information clinic\\" that was proposed for Marlboro by Bill Baird, an activist from New York City. Morreale told a newspaper reporter that she did not advocate abortion herself but that she was in favor of free choice for others and thus she supported Baird's proposal. Because of her statement in the newspaper, and the town's polarization over the issue of abortion clinics, Morreale's local priest would not baptize her three-month- old son Nathaniel, and Humberto Sousa Medeiros, the Archbishop of Boston, said that he would not allow any other priest to perform the rite. O'Rourke and Harriman spoke with local priests but could not convince them to lift the stated baptism ban. On August 20, 1974, O'Rourke publicly baptized the baby on the steps of the parish church, Immaculate Conception Church, in front of its locked doors and 300 onlookers including Morreale family members and friends, and news reporters. In this, he acted against his superiors' express orders, and was dismissed from the Jesuit Order in September.Priest Expelled for Forbidden Baptism Sarasota Herald-Tribune, p. 4b, Oct. 18, 1975 O'Rourke continued to live with his order and appealed his dismissal to Rome on the grounds that he had a right to baptize the baby. His appeal was rejected. Later, he was also laicized.\\"When the swallows come back to Capistrano\\" Bottum, Joseph. First Things, Oct. 1, 2006. at highbeam.com. Retrieved 2011-07-14. Although O'Rourke was very critical of Catholic Church teaching in matters of sexuality, he remained committed to Catholic advocacy of religious liberty, and for constitutional, economic, political and human rights.Chihara, Michelle. (July 31, 2002). \\"Father Figures\\". Colorado Springs Independent. Retrieved 2011-07-16. O'Rourke later married and had a child.Becker, Joseph M.

With the revival of the recorder by Arnold Dolmetsch, who chose Baroque music and the corresponding recorder types as a fixed point, consideration was given to the design of recorder types larger than the bass recorder. The great bass recorder has up to seven keys, which serve to facilitate access to the finger holes. For modern large bass recorders woods like maple or African Bubinga are used. The term usually applies to an instrument with range is c‚Äìd2 (g2), but has also been used to describe an instrument descending to B or else to the low bass recorder in F, alternatively known as a contrabass. When \\"great bass\\" is used for the instrument in low F, the instruments in C and B are referred to as \\"quart- bass\\" and \\"quint-bass\\", respectively, because they are a fourth and fifth below the ordinary small bass, or \\"basset\\" . The prefixes \\"great\\" and \\"contra\\" refer to the registers from C to B and from ÕµC to ÕµB, respectively, in Helmholtz pitch notation. History In the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg are two famous great bass recorders. Both are of the Renaissance type, despite the fact that the instrument of (1636‚Äì1686) is provided on the head piece with high baroque ornaments. This recorder is part of an ensemble set that is made of plum wood. For larger recorders pear wood is usually used, for reasons of cost. The great bass recorder requires a key for the bottom note, which was protected by a so-called fontanelle. An S-shaped bocal or crook is used to make it somewhat more comfortable to play the instrument. Because the finger holes are not covered with keys, some of the tone holes are placed in acoustically unfavorable locations to accommodate the hand. The relatively large finger-span distance reduces fluency of playing. As an authentic instrument, the great bass recorder has a short history of about 100 to 120 years. The instrument is only described in the Syntagma Musicum of Michael Praetorius (1619) and Marin Mersenne (L'Harmonie Universelle, Paris 1637). The earliest great bass recorder is probably that in the collection of Venetian Catajo Palace. It is now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. The great bass recorder is given the name \\"BassFl√∂t\\" (bass recorder) by Michael Praetorius, and described by him as an instrument in B, a perfect fifth lower than the basset, or \\"small\\" bass in F . Marin Mersenne describes a great bass recorder with a very delicate carved double key for the lowest tone and the overlying semitone. The problem of the minor second above the bass tone, which can be achieved only by half-holing and which not every recorder player can get used to, is not solved by Mersenne's innovation by analogy to other instruments. The Kynseker instrument from the Germanisches Nationalmuseum is both the highpoint and the endpoint of development. It lags behind Mersenne's ideas. It is possible that it was already conceived as historicizing.

It was developed in Minnesota by Edmund LaCroix, a French inventor hired by Cadwallader C. Washburn and George Christian of the Washburn \\"A\\" Mill. It was developed to complement the emerging roller mill technique of the late 19th century, which used corrugated metal rollers instead of abrasive grindstones to grind wheat into flour. The middlings purifier was used in this process to separate the bran from the usable part of the flour. The machine developed by LaCroix passed the partially ground middlings over a screen, and a stream of air blew away the particles of bran.. Now at http://flour.com/flour/, accessed 15 August 2018 This process was used because winter wheat, sown in the fall and harvested early the next summer was not feasible to grow in Minnesota. Spring wheat was sown in the spring and harvested in late summer. This could be grown by Minnesota farmers, but the conventional techniques of grinding grain between millstones ended up producing a darker flour than consumers desired. It was also difficult to mix the gluten and the starch completely, as well. After Washburn's company developed the roller-milling technique with the use of a middlings purifier, they tried to monopolize the technique, but the Pillsbury Company and other competitors were able to duplicate the process thanks to employees who left Washburn and passed along trade secrets. The development of the middlings purifier may have been based on the invention of the purifier by Ignaz Paur, an Austrian Miller and inventor (1778 - 1842) early in the 19th century. Washburn later teamed up with John Crosby to form the Washburn-Crosby Company, which eventually became General Mills.

Recounts will often take place if the initial vote tally during an election is extremely close. Election recounts will often result in changes in contest tallies. Errors can be found or introduced from human factors, such as transcription errors, or machine errors, such as misreads of paper ballots. Alternately, tallies may change because of a reinterpretation of voter intent. United States In the United States recounts rarely reverse election results. Of the 4,687 statewide general elections held from 2000 to 2015, 27 were followed by a recount, and only three resulted in a change of outcome from the original count: 2004 Washington gubernatorial election, 2006 Vermont Auditor of Accounts election, and 2008 United States Senate election in Minnesota. Recount methods Recounting optical-scan ballots by hand in the United States Senate election in Minnesota, 2008. =Machine recount= A machine recount is a retabulation of ballots cast during the election. This can be done using an optical scan voting system, punched card system or direct-recording electronic (DRE) voting machine. With document-based Ballot Voting Systems, ballots are counted a second time by some form of machine. With Non-document-based Ballot Voting Systems officials will recollect vote data from each voting machine which will be combined by a central tabulation system. =Manual recount= A manual or \\"hand\\" recount involves each individual physical representation of voter intent being reviewed for voter intent by one or more individuals. With DRE voting machines, a voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) is examined from each voter. For some DREs that do not generate a VVPAT, images can be printed for each ballot cast and counted individually. Legal requirements Recounts can be mandatory or optional. In some jurisdictions, recounts are mandatory in the event the difference between the top two candidates is less than a percentage of votes cast or of a fixed number. Mandatory recounts are paid for by the elections official, or the state. Mandatory recounts can usually be waived by the apparent losing candidate. The winning side will usually encourage the loser to waive the recount in a show of unity and to avoid spending taxpayer money. Each jurisdiction has different criteria for optional recounts. Some areas permit recounts for any office or measure, while others require that the margin of victory be less than a certain percentage before a recount is allowed. In all instances, optional recounts are paid for by the candidate, their political party, or, in some instances, by any interested voter. The person paying for the recount has the option to stop the recount at any time. If the recount reverses the election, the jurisdiction will then pay for the recount.

They are also known as the Schildersbent (\\"painters' clique\\"). Activities Cornelis (Poelenburgh) from Utrecht (bent-name Satier), Wouter (Crabeth) from Gou (bent-name Almanack), Tyman (Cracht) from Emster (bent-name Botterkull) and Peter from Leiden (bent- name Ram). Bentvueghels in a Roman Tavern, by Pieter van Laer The members, which included painters, etchers, sculptors and poets, all lived in different parts of the city (mostly the parishes of Santa Maria del Popolo and San Lorenzo in Lucina in the north of the city) and came together for social and intellectual reasons. The group was well known for its drunken, Bacchic initiation rituals (paid for by the initiate). These celebrations, sometimes lasting up to 24 hours, concluded with group marching to the church of Santa Costanza, known popularly at the time as the Temple of Bacchus. There they made libations to Bacchus before the porphyry sarcophagus of Constantina (now in the Vatican Museums), which was considered to be his tomb because of its Bacchic motifs. A list of its members may still be seen in one of this church's side chapels. This practice was finally banned by Pope Clement XI in 1720. Although predominantly made up of Flemish and Dutch artists, a few other members were admitted, including Joachim von Sandrart and Valentin de Boulogne.Bentvueghels in Joachim von Sandrart's \\"Teutsche Academie\\", 1682 Despite the rowdy nature of these initiations, an intellectual quality was maintained. Joachim von Sandrart, for example, wrote in his 1675‚Äì1679 book, Teutsche Academie der edlen Bau-, Bild und Malereik√ºnste (German Academy of the Noble Arts of Architecture, Sculpture and Painting), that his \\"baptism\\" included \\"reasoned discourses, undertaken by French and Italians, as well as by Germans and Netherlanders, each in his own tongue.\\"Levine (1990), p. 217 Also Cornelis de Bruijn wrote about the rituals he had to undergo in 1674 and made some engravings, which he published in 1698.Corneille le Brun, A Voyage to the Levant: or Travels in the Principal Parts of Asia Minor. In: Cornelis de Bruijn. Voyages from Rome to Jerusalem and from Moscow to Batavia (Catalogue of an exposition in the Allard Pierson Museum , Amsterdam, 1998) The Bentvueghels and the Accademia di San Luca The Bentvueghels were frequently at odds with Rome's Accademia di San Luca (\\"Academy of Saint Luke\\"), which had the purpose of elevating the work of \\"artists\\" above that of craftsman. For this reason, before setting off for Italy, artists would first try to become members in their local Guild of St. Luke so they would have papers to show on arrival. Travel to Italy became a rite of passage for young Dutch and Flemish artists after publication of Karel van Mander's Schilder- boeck in 1604. Often encompassing a difficult and in many cases dangerous journey, artists would spend years getting to Italy, using their artistic talents to pay their way. Many never made it all the way to Italy, and many never attempted the trip back once they got there. On arrival, many artists were therefore fairly established thanks to their work experience done along the way. However, equally many were still young and unknown. What they all did have by the time they arrived in Rome, was an overwhelming feeling of self- confidence in their ability to live by their own work, and membership in the Accademia had little relevance for them. Traditionally, the low-brow qualities of the Bentvueghel's activities have been emphasized over their intellectual and artistic pursuits. David Levine suggests instead that \\"academic art- pedagogy, with its emphasis on repetitive copying, might well have struck members of the Bent [the Bentvueghels] as a low, mechanical process in contrast to their truly humanistic approach.\\"Levine (1990), p. 219 Artists such as Pieter van Laer, however, belonged to both organisations.Haskell, p. 20. Known members The earliest-known publication listing the members is the book by Arnold Houbraken, an artist and engraver who never traveled to Italy, but who used the Bentvueghels membership list as a source for his book, De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen, in 1718. Whenever possible, he gives the nickname or bent of the painter in his biographical sketches. The original members of the group were also depicted in a series of drawings made around 1620.The drawings are currently housed in the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam. Among those appearing in the drawings are Cornelis van Poelenburch, Bartholomeus Breenbergh, Dirck van Baburen, Paulus Bor, Cornelis Schut and Simon Ard√©.Levine (Grove) Upon initiation, members were given aliases that were often classical gods and heroes, such as Bacchus, Cupid, Hector, Meleager, Cephalus, Pyramus, Orpheus, etc. Sometimes, however, the aliases were witty or semi-obscene in keeping with the general activities of the society.

The South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive (SYPTE) was no longer allowed to operate buses itself, so an arms length operating company was created. SYT operated buses in and around Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield with some services extending to Chesterfield, Leeds and Barnsley. Known locally as 'one man buses', the company had by now dispensed with conductors and become driver operated vehicles. In November 1993 South Yorkshire Transport was sold in a management buyout and rebranded Mainline.South Yorkshire Transport Authority Sells Off Bus Company to Staff Local Government Chronicle 18 November 1993 Shortly after Stagecoach purchased a 20% stake in the company, however this was sold in 1995 to FirstBus. Competition SYT worked hard to maintain a dominant position for bus operations in most of South Yorkshire and were known to have bought out a number of smaller operators including Dearneways, Groves and earlier during SYPTE days Booth and Fisher. Whilst SYT operated in most of South Yorkshire, Yorkshire Traction, a rival operator dominated Barnsley and half of Doncaster, which effectively split the county in two when considering bus transport. Competition for routes and passengers grew fiercely from the mid-1980s and many new operators challenged SYT. A notable number were simply bought out and wiped off the road by SYT however one or two hung around to become a significant dent in the company's profits. West Riding One such project was when SYT began to expand and operate in West Yorkshire under the name Compass Bus. Allegedly in retaliation, West Riding buses returned the move by creating Sheffield and District Bus Co duplicating a number of routes in the north of Sheffield directly against SYT. In a dramatic move, the two companies withdrew from each other's main areas of operation dissolving both the S&D; and Compass names. Sheffield Omnibus Other competitors who survived temporarily included Sheffield Omnibus. This was a move by employees from Preston Bus in Lancashire who moved a fleet of aging double-deck Leyland Atlanteans onto cross city services in Sheffield, matching SYT's fares and also operating later than SYT until midnight. The services proved an instant hit especially as the livery was similar to the old Sheffield Transport one from pre 1974 and the vehicles were the same core model as SYPTE had in the mid-1970s. Arch competitor Yorkshire Traction bought Sheffield Omnibus along with smaller Leyland National operating company Yorkshire Terrier and South Riding buses which gave it a major foothold in Sheffield services for the first time. Sheafline SYT saw significant staff redundancies and on more than one occasion, staff losing their jobs set up in direct competition to SYT. One such venture was Sheafline. Their advantage was that the drivers already knew the routes, fares, timetables and just needed the buses to drive. So, pre-owned Leyland Fleetlines were bought and Sheafline was launched. It took SYT a number of years to buy out the business at which point the Sheafline buses were scrapped and drivers integrated back into SYT, the very company where they had previously worked. Sheffield United Tours To complicate matters further, a company which had ceased operating 20 years earlier, Sheffield United Tours was relaunched operating from the neighbouring garage to SYT's East Bank Road centre, and with early 1970s Daimler Fleetlines again, set its sights on duplicating the SYT route map. With some success, the company operated until the mid-1990s and were seen at the time as a possible real challenger to the SYT dominance. Andrews Buses Andrews MCW Metrobus at Meadowhall Interchange, 1999 This scenario repeated itself in a different format with Andrews buses. They were originally a well known PSV training unit in the city and bought a number of withdrawn PTE buses which were promptly repainted and pressed into service, often on their old routes. Daimler Fleetlines were the preferred vehicles and the company, after many years of service, was merged into the Sheffield Omnibus operation. Impact on SYT There were however many advantages to using SYT... As SYT had inherited the PTE owned vehicles, it did continue a solid reputation for comfortable seats and for the remainder of the 1980s held impressive regularity on most routes. Fares in South Yorkshire were the lowest in the UK. At just 2p per mile until 1986, services were very popular and there were over 200 routes plus works, schools and limited stop express services. However, fares rose rapidly with the introduction of the monthly unlimited 'SYT Savercard' priced at ¬£15. This was however just the beginning with fares that are now over ¬£3 per day under First. Not only that but services eroded significantly and past press releases from the company have quoted 'use them or lose them'. As fares rose, passengers declined at a similar rate. A trend that still continues today. Operations=Doncaster Buses in Doncaster were based at two garages in the borough. The main depot was the former Doncaster Corporation garage on Leicester Avenue, close to Doncaster Racecourse. In the 1980s, a new workshop building was erected at the rear of the yard behind the garage. In the early 1990s, the main depot building was demolished and the land sold. This made way for a new Wickes DIY store. The new workshop, yard and small section of the old garage building, which contained a bus-wash facility, remained. The only access to the smaller depot was now on Leger Way. The second garage, which was much smaller, was on Bootham Lane in Dunscroft. Rotherham Buses in Rotherham were based at a large garage on Midland Road, the present headquarters and also the location for the refurbishment of the complete remaining fleet of AEC Routemasters (which is why they sported SYT branded number plates). Sheffield Buses in Sheffield were operated from five garages; East Bank, Greenland Road, Halfway, Herries Road and Leadmill. Fleet South Yorkshire Leyland Olympian at Pontefract bus station, 1996 The initial fleet was inherited from SYPTE. The standard double-decker bus was the Alexander-bodied Dennis Dominator, with some Leyland Atlanteans, Volvo Ailsas, Leyland-DAB articulated buses and Daimler Fleetlines some of which came from smaller companies taken over by SYT, such as Rossie Motors and Blue Ensign; the predominant single-decker being Leyland National and later the Volvo B10M. Other fleets bought by SYT were Renault/Reeve Burgess minibuses and Dennis Dominos. As at the end of 2007, SYT is fondly remembered as from a time when fares were low, services were widespread, regular and vehicles had comfortable seating. There is an active SYT preservation society maintaining and rallying various vehicles from the SYPTE, SYT and Mainline plus an annual gathering each year at the Meadowhall Shopping Centre in Sheffield, usually the first Sunday in September.

He was president of the American Ornithologists‚Äô Union (AOU) 1920‚Äì23, and was editor of the AOU's periodical The Auk 1912‚Äì1936. He spearheaded the production of the 4th edition of the AOU checklist, published in 1931. He worked for over 50 years in the Ornithology Department at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, eventually serving as Director of the institution. Stone was one of the founding members of the Delaware Valley Ornithological Club (DVOC) in 1890 and was actively involved in the organization for the remainder of his life. Stone was one of only two scientists (Joseph Grinnell was the other) to serve as president of both the AOU and the American Society of Mammalogists, and he co-authored two popular books about mammals. His outstanding botanical contribution was The Plants of Southern New Jersey, published in 1911. Stone spent many summers at Cape May, New Jersey, summering there annually starting in 1916. He is best remembered for his two-volume classic Bird Studies at Old Cape May, which was published by the DVOC in 1937, two years before his death.  Early life  Witmer Stone was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on September 22, 1866, to Anne Eveline (n√©e Witmer) and Frederick Dawson Stone. According to longtime friend, Cornelius Weygandt, Witmer Stone was ‚Äúof the Chester County Quaker- Pennsylvania Dutch cross that has given us so many of our botanists and ornithologists, paleontologists and chemists.‚ÄùWeygandt, Cornelius. Philadelphia Folks. D. Appleton Century Co. 1938. Stone showed an early interest in all things natural, and was an inveterate collector. Stone was a boyhood friend and schoolmate of two of the Brown brothers: Amos Brown later became a geology professor at University of Pennsylvania, and Stewardson Brown became the Curator of the Department of Botany at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. Stone and his brother, Frederick, and three of the Brown brothers formed the ‚ÄúWilson Natural Science Association‚Äù, named in honor of the pioneering American ornithologist Alexander Wilson. Stone also spent time exploring the woods and fields around his grandmother's Chester County, Pennsylvania home. Stone married Lillie May Lafferty on August 1, 1904; they had no children. Stone graduated from Germantown Academy in 1883. He obtained an A.B. degree from the University of Pennsylvania (UP), then in March 1888 was appointed a Jessup Fund Student at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, when Dr. Joseph Leidy was the Academy's president. The Academy established an ornithology department in 1891, the same year that Stone completed an A.M. degree at UP. (UP later conferred an honorary ScD. on Stone in 1913, and presented him with the Alumni Award of Merit in 1937.) Stone participated in Academy-sponsored collecting expeditions to Bermuda in 1888 and to Mexico in 1890.  The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia Stone visited the Academy of Natural Sciences many times while growing up, and later worked there for 51 years. Stone inherited an ornithological specimens collection that had not been cared for properly, and spearheaded heroic efforts to salvage this and collections from other fields. Some specimens were historically valuable, including types described by pioneering ornithologists and mammalogists. The size of the Academy's bird collection increased fivefold during Stone's tenure, from 26,000 specimens to 143,000. From 1893 to 1908 Stone was Assistant Curator at the Academy; Curator 1908‚Äì1918 and Executive Curator 1918‚Äì1925; Director 1925‚Äì1928; Curator of Vertebrates, 1918‚Äì1936; and lastly, three titles (with year of appointment) that Stone held at the time of his death: Vice President (1927), Emeritus Director (1928), and Honorary Curator of Birds (1938).  As a botanist  Stone was an original member of the Philadelphia Botanical Club. He had a knowledge of systematics of the local flora ‚Äúsurpassed only by that of Simon-pure botanists,‚Äù and, according to a later eminent botanist, Frans Stafleu, Stone's concentration on ornithology was a ‚Äúdefinite loss‚Äù for botany. Stone produced 20 botanical writings during his lifetime. After a joint meeting of the Philadelphia and Torrey Botanical Clubs to Toms River, New Jersey, in early July 1900, Stone resolved to write a flora of the New Jersey Pine Barrens. Over the next decade Stone made hundreds of collecting trips to southern New Jersey. His research culminated in his botanical pi√®ce-de-r√©sistance, The Plants of Southern New Jersey, published in 1911, which ‚Äúis the only comprehensive floristic treatment for southern New Jersey and it continues to be used today [2002].‚Äù The Academy of Natural Sciences preserves many botanical specimens that Witmer Stone collected circa 1910, including many from New Jersey. The Mid-Atlantic Herbarium Consortium was leading a project to digitize records through volunteer crowd-sourcing as of 2020. Alt URL  As an ornithologist  Stone's first manuscript to appear in a ‚Äúserious‚Äù publication was ‚ÄúThe Turkey Buzzard Breeding in Pennsylvania‚Äù in American Naturalist in 1885. His first note in The Auk was ‚ÄúA migration of hawks at Germantown, Pennsylvania‚Äù in 1887. Stone was a founding member of the Delaware Valley Ornithological Club (DVOC) in 1890, and authored the DVOC's The Birds of Eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey, which was published in 1894 and put both him and the club on the ornithological map. He wrote The Birds of New Jersey, Their Nests and Eggs, published in 1909. His ornithological publications run into the hundreds; a search on the Searchable Ornithological Research Archive website turns up approximately 125 articles and notes in The Auk alone. Witmer Stone had a long association with the American Ornithologists‚Äô Union (AOU). He was elected an Associate in 1885; a Fellow in 1892; and a member of the council in 1898. He served as chairman of the AOU Committee on Bird Protection 1896‚Äì1901; as a member (from 1901) and later as Chairman (1915‚Äì1931) of the AOU Committee on Classification and Nomenclature of North American Birds; and as editor of The Auk 1912‚Äì1936 (after editing the DVOC's Cassinia for ten years). Stone was Vice-President of the AOU 1914‚Äì1920, and President 1920‚Äì1923. He chaired the committee which produced the 4th edition of the AOU checklist, published in 1931. Stone was an honorary member of many foreign ornithological societies, the Nuttall Ornithological Club, the Cooper Ornithological Club, and the Zoological Society of Philadelphia (Stone was also Director of the latter). He was awarded the Otto Hermann Medal of the Hungarian Ornithological Society in 1931 and was a member of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature, the Advisory Committee of the National Audubon Society, and the American Philosophical Society. He was also President of the Pennsylvania Audubon Society.  Bird Studies at Old Cape May  For all of his work as one of the preeminent ornithologists of his day, Stone's most enduring popular legacy is undoubtedly his charming Bird Studies at Old Cape May (BSOCM), originally published by the Delaware Valley Ornithological Club (DVOC) in 1937. This was an ornithological history of the New Jersey coast, with an emphasis on Cape May County, particularly the coastal areas. The bulk of the work consists of species accounts of all the birds that had been found in Cape May County at the time of the writing, with their historical occurrence in the state and notes on seasonality, habits, behavior, etc. gleaned from Stone's own notes and the records of fellow DVOC members. Stone dedicated Bird Studies at Old Cape May to his wife. Stone first visited Cape May in August 1890, and spent most of July‚ÄìAugust 1891 there. He made frequent trips there over the years, and became an annual summer resident starting in 1916 and continuing until at least 1937. The largest photograph of Stone hangs in the Cape May Bird Observatory‚Äôs Center for Research and Education in Goshen, NJ. Stone was posthumously awarded the Brewster Medal by the American Ornithologists‚Äô Union in 1939 for BSOCM. The DVOC published 1,400 two-volume sets of BSOCM (see the DVOC website for information about the original DVOC editionsBird Studies at Old Cape May at www.dvoc.org). Dover Publications (1965) and Stackpole Books (2000) have both published editions of BSOCM; however, both editions are now out of print.

He has argued that these two conflicting philosophies are in fact compatible. He is currently the George Kneller Chair in the Philosophy of Education in the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. Kellner was an early theorist in the field of critical media literacy and has been a leading theorist of media culture generally. In his recent work, he has increasingly argued that media culture has become dominated by forms of spectacle and mega-spectacle. He also has contributed important studies of alter-globalization processes, and has always been concerned with counter-hegemonic movements and alternative cultural expressions in the name of a more radically democratic society.Kellner, Douglas. Media Culture: Cultural Studies, Identity and Politics Between the Modern and the Postmodern. 1995 London: Routledge. He is known for his work exploring the politically oppositional potentials of new media and attempted to delineate what they term \\"multiple technoliteracies\\" as a movement away from the present attempt to standardize a corporatist form of computer literacy. Kellner has published multiple works on the 2016 Presidential Election, focusing on Donald Trump's media spectacles and authoritarian populism. Kellner has collaborated with a number of other authors, including K. Daniel Cho, Tyson E. Lewis, Clayton Pierce, and Rhonda Hammer. Kellner collaborated with Steven Best on an award- winning trilogy of books examining postmodern turns in philosophy, the arts, and science and technology. He served as the literary executor of the documentary film maker Emile de Antonio and acted as editor of \\"Collected Papers of Herbert Marcuse,\\" which collected six volumes of the papers of the critical theorist Herbert Marcuse.  Education and career  Kellner attended Doane College for his bachelor's degree, studying in Copenhagen for his junior year and graduating in 1965. Kellner then went on to Columbia University, earning a PhD in philosophy in 1973. During his time at Columbia, Kellner partook in student protests against the Vietnam War. During this time he came to believe in the political nature of knowledge as well as the relationship between history and the production of ideas. A historical understanding of philosophy's relationship to one's lived experiences became increasingly clear to Kellner through his research into German critical theory at the University of T√ºbingen in Germany. While studying there, he read the works of Theodor Adorno, Max Horkheimer, Karl Korsch, Herbert Marcuse, and Ernst Bloch, all of whom were instrumental in a new form of Marxist criticism concerned primarily with questions of culture and subjectivity rather than with analyzing production. Kellner then went from Germany to France, where he attended lectures and read books of Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Jean Baudrillard, Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard, and other postmodern theorists. Hence, Kellner's philosophical explorations did not end with the Frankfurt School. With his co- author Steven Best, Kellner has gone on to write a series of books critically interrogating what has come to be known as postmodern theory. Although adopting many insights from postmodernists such as Foucault, as well as many feminist and critical race theorists, Kellner retains the centrality of critical theory as a macro-theoretical lens capable of building conceptual bridges between various political movements and capable of critically evaluating and mediating competing philosophical perspectives. Throughout his philosophical adventures, Kellner has drawn from the Frankfurt School a concern for the industrialization and commercialization of culture under capitalist relations of production. This situation has become most acute in the United States with its highly commercial media culture. Combining insights and methodological tools from the Frankfurt School and from British cultural studies, Kellner has written on media culture as a complex political, philosophical, and economic phenomenon. In his view, media emerges as a \\"contested terrain\\" in which political struggles are played out in narrative and visual forms. Thus films, television, internet, etc. articulate dominant, conservative, reactionary social values but also offer progressive resistance against these values. As an example of Kellner's method of media analysis, he has read the image of the pop sensation Madonna as a complex representation of women that challenges gender, sexual, and fashion stereotypes while at the same time reasserting those very codes by offering a \\"new\\" notion of the self that is reliant upon hyper-consumerism. Kellner's work in the area of media culture has been influential for educators concerned with fostering \\"critical media literacy\\" capable of decoding the complexities of the visual culture that surrounds us. Another equally important line of inquiry defining Kellner's work is his interest in \\"techno-capitalism\\" or capitalism defined by ever sophisticated advances in technology. Thus Kellner has been at the forefront of theorizing new technologies and their social, political, and economic impacts. His interest in technologies began in the mid-seventies while a professor at the University of Texas at Austin. Here Kellner studied the political economy of television producing the renowned and original works Television and the Crisis of Democracy and The Persian Gulf Television War as well as launching his own very successful alternative culture public-access television cable TV show entitled Alternative Views. As with his theories of media images, Kellner offers a dialectical approach to new technologies, highlighting their progressive and democratic potentials while also critiquing the undeniable reality of corporate interests that drive the technologies market. Again this work has become increasingly important for educators concerned with the role of technology in the classroom. Indeed, Kellner has focused studies in education on explicating media literacy and the multiple literacies needed to critically engage culture in the contemporary era. On this basis, he has called for a democratic reconstruction of education for the new digitized, mediated, global and multicultural era.  Controversies  In January 2006, Kellner was caught up in the Bruin Alumni Association's controversial \\"Dirty Thirty\\" project, which listed UCLA's most politically extreme professors. The list was compiled by a former UCLA graduate student, Andrew Jones, who had previously been fired by his mentor David Horowitz for pressuring \\"students to file false reports about leftists\\" and for stealing Horowitz's mailing list of potential contributors to fund research for attacks on left wing professors.\\"Campus Activist Goes Right at ‚ÄòEm\\", The Los Angeles Times, 22 January 2006: B1 and B16 The Association offered students up to $100 for tapes of lectures that show how \\"radicals\\" on the faculty are \\"actively proselytizing their extreme views in the classroom\\".\\"UCLA's Dirty Thirty\\", The Nation, 26 January 2006 [online] Kellner, named number three; Peter McLaren, also in the School of Education and Information Studies at UCLA, topped the list at number one. Kellner responded in print with the view that the \\"attack exemplified right wing interventions within the cultural wars that have raged on campuses since the 1960s\\".\\"Education and the Academic Left: Critical Reflections on Todd Gitlin\\".  Political writing  Kellner's writing style has been the subject of criticism in the scholarly field, as many of his books are fiercely political. A Publishers Weekly review of Grand Theft 2000: Media Spectacle and a Stolen Election was positive, though it concluded that the book's end result is \\"somewhat formless and unfocused.\\" Although the review praised some aspects, notably Kellner's highlighting of some conservative ideological inconsistencies, it lamented that Kellner's \\"sporadic, underdeveloped discussion of Republicans projecting their own sins onto Democrats is particularly frustrating.\\"\\"Grand Theft 2000: Media Spectacle and a Stolen Election: Review\\", Publishers Weekly, 29 October 2001 [online] Kellner received the 2008 American Educational Studies Association (AESA) Critics‚Äô Choice Award for his book Guys and Guns Amok: Domestic Terrorism and School Shootings from the Oklahoma City Bombing to the Virginia Tech Massacre. The book argues that school shootings and other acts of mass violence embody a crisis of out-of-control gun culture and male rage, heightened by a glorification of hypermasculinity and violence in the media. Kellner has written multiple works on the 2016 Presidential Election, strongly opposing Donald Trump. In his 2016 book American Nightmare Donald Trump, Media Spectacle, and Authoritarian Populism, Kellner applies his focus on media culture and literacy to the election of Donald Trump. Kellner built on this work in 2017, publishing American Horror Show: Election 2016 and the Ascent of Donald J. Trump, in which he criticizes the president, referring to him as \\"the Swamp King\\" and \\"Putin's Poodle.\\"  Selected works  Books authored * Herbert Marcuse and the Crisis of Marxism.

In 1983 he was a co-founder of the African Liberation Forces of Mauritania (FLAM; Force pour la Liberation Africaine de Mauritanie), and in 1986 he was a communication specialist with FLAM when they published the second edition of the Manifesto of the oppressed black Mauritanian. Following this anti-racist publication, which highlighted racial and discriminatory practices by the Mauritanian government, many black leaders were arrested and thrown to jail. Ibrahima Sarr was sentenced to four years in jail. In 1989, after being released from jail, Sarr resigned from FLAM and ceased his political activities until the democratization process was started in 1992 by President Taya. Sarr then joined the Popular Progressive Alliance (APP) under Messaoud Ould Boulkheir, becoming a leading member of the party. He later left the APP.Birome Gu√®ye, \\"IBRAHIMA SARR, LEADER DE l‚ÄôAJD/MR : En qu√™te d‚Äôouverture\\", Africanglobalnews.com, August 24, 2007 . Sarr stood in the March 2007 presidential election on an anti-racist platform. In order to facilitate his candidacy, he founded the \\"Movement for National Reconciliation\\", although he stood as an independent. Claiming that \\"I am the candidate of the oppressed\\", he called for equal rights for Pulaar, Sonink√© and Wolof people alongside Moors, and the return of Mauritanian refugees from Senegal. Sarr came in fifth place with 7.95% of the vote in the election,\\"Le conseil constitutionnel proclame les r√©sultats du premier tour de l'√©lection pr√©sidentielles du 11 mars 2007\\", Agence Mauritanienne d'Information, March 15, 2007 . and he backed Ahmed Ould Daddah for the second round.\\"Mauritania : Ould Daddah gets support of fifth place holder for presidential runoff\\", African Press Agency, March 20, 2007. Sarr's Movement for National Reconciliation subsequently merged with the Alliance for Justice and Democracy (AJD), and at an extraordinary congress to ratify the merger on August 18-19, Sarr was elected as the leader of the new party, the AJD/MR. Sarr said on May 10, 2008 that the AJD/MR would not participate in the government of Prime Minister Yahya Ould Ahmed El Waghef due to policy differences.\\"L'AJD/MR annonce qu'il ne participera au nouveau gouvernement\\" , AMI, May 10, 2008 .

It was also the location of the final battle on South Carolina soil. History Brigadier General Edward E. Potter took command of the two Northern brigades--2700 men--recently landed at Georgetown. Colonel Edward N. Hallowell, former commander of the famed 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment and wounded at Fort Wagner, led one of the brigades including his former unit now consisting of over 700 men. Under orders to disable railroads in South Carolina, Potter's brigades were forced to contend with Kentucky's \\"Orphan Brigade\\" of mounted infantry from April 9 at Dingle's Mill through 18 April. On April 18, 1865, Potter's troops met again with the Kentuckians in the quiet town of Boykin, South Carolina. The Confederates held a strong defensive position in an abandoned fort. Sergeant Major Joseph Thomas Wilson later wrote about this fort:Joseph Thomas Wilson (1892/1968), The Black Phalanx: A History of the Negro Soldiers of the United States in the Wars of 1775, 1812, 1861--1865, reprint, New York: Arno Press. \\"No better position could be found for a defense, as the only approach to it, was by a narrow embankment about 200 yards long, where only one could walk at a time.\\"Clinton Cox (1991) Undying Glory: The Story of the Massachusetts 54th Regiment, New York: Scholastic, p. 146.

The force was deployed to the Alberta border in response to the Cypress Hills Massacre and subsequent fears of a United States military intervention. Their ill-planned and arduous journey of nearly became known as the \\"March West\\" and was later portrayed by the force as an epic journey of endurance. Background Mounted police preparing to leave Fort Dufferin in 1874, depicted by Henri Julien Sir John Macdonald acquired approval for his new force on May 23 1873, after Parliament, following a cursory debate, passed the Mounted Police Act into law unopposed.; ; At this point, Macdonald appears to have intended to create a force of mounted police to watch \\"the frontier from Manitoba to the foot of the Rocky Mountains\\", probably with its headquarters in Winnipeg. He was heavily influenced by the model of the Royal Irish Constabulary, which combined aspects of a traditional military unit with the judicial functions of the magistrates' courts, and believed that the new force should be able to provide a local system of government in otherwise ungoverned areas.; Macdonald had originally also wanted to form units of M√©tis policemen, commanded by white Canadian officers in a similar manner to the British Indian Army, but he was forced to abandon this approach after the M√©tis revolt of 1870 called their loyalty into question. In June 1873, around 30 members of the Assiniboine First Nation were killed in the Cypress Hills Massacre, creating a national furore. In response, Macdonald used a privy council order to enact the new legislation, formally creating the North West Mounted Police with the intention of mobilising the force and deploying it early the next year. A report then arrived from Alexander Morris, the Lieutenant Governor of the North-West Territories, blaming the massacre on the activities of whiskey traders at Fort Whoop-Up; Morris predicted that if action was not taken immediately, there would be a major uprising by the First Nations across the region, into which the United States might choose to intervene.; Macdonald was not entirely convinced by the governor's analysis, but nonetheless he agreed to recruit 150 men and send them west to Lower Fort Garry before winter weather blocked the route. Macdonald's Conservative government then fell from power over the Pacific Scandal,(Macdonald resigned as prime minister on 5 November 1873). and was replaced by the Liberal administration of Alexander Mackenzie, who placed more credence on Morris's reports and had his own moral concerns about the whiskey trade. These worries were amplified by calls from Washington for Ottawa to secure the frontier and so prevent American Indians from purchasing whiskey in Canada. Mackenzie initially suggested sending a joint Canadian-United States military expedition, but, after the Governor General and others noted the serious implications of inviting the United States Army to deploy into Canadian territory, he instead agreed to deploy the new mounted police to carry out the operation. Another 150 men were recruited in eastern Canada and sent west by rail through the United States to rendezvous with the first part of the force at Fort Dufferin. Deployment The force was given orders to proceed to Fort Edmonton in order to resolve problems around Fort Whoop-Up, before then dispersing to various posts stretching westwards across the territories. From Fort Dufferin, one option was to trace the southern line of the frontier, following a well-established trail created two years before by the British and United States Boundary Commission.; Morris disagreed with this approach, arguing that it might encourage an attack by the Sioux First Nation, and encouraged the NWMP to take a more northerly route. French finally agreed with Morris that the expedition would initially follow the trail, but would then steer away from the border and Sioux territory. The march The police in Dead Horse Valley in 1874, depicted by Henri Julien The NWMP finally left Dufferin on 8 July 1874. The 275 strong expedition was divided into six divisions, labelled A to F, supported by 310 horses, 143 draught oxen and 187 Red River carts and wagons, stretching out at least along the track.; The force took two field guns and two mortars for protection, cattle to use as food, and mowing machines for making hay. French had negotiated with the Canadian Illustrated News that the expedition be accompanied by Henri Julien, a journalist whom the Commissioner hoped would write a positive account of the new force. The teams made only 15 or miles a day at most, travelling under unpleasant and arduous conditions, made more difficult by the NWMP teamsters having little experience and the horses being unsuitable for draught work.; On 29 July, the badly depleted A division, including those men suffering from dysentery, was left behind as the main force turned off the southerly trail and across the much drier and rougher plains to the north-west.; Food began to run out and, due to the expedition having failed to bring any water bottles, the men had no option but to drink contaminated local water. Another detachment of the sicker men and livestock were left behind at Old Wives Lakes. On 24 August the expedition reached the Cypress Hills, where the weather turned wet and cold, and the expedition's horses began to die. French had thought Fort Whoop-Up would be found at the junction of the Bow and South Saskatchewan rivers, but when they arrived on 10 September there was nothing to be seen, as the fort was in fact around away.; The NWMP had expected the area to contain good grazing for their horses but it was barren and treeless.; ; French described it as \\"little better than a desert\\" and his men were reduced to drinking muddy water gathered from marshland.; ; Having sent out search parties with no success, the expedition now faced the total loss of their horses and imminent starvation.; French abandoned the plan to move further towards Whoop-Up and instead travelled 70 miles south towards the Sweet Grass Hills, close to the border, where supplies could be bought from the United States.; Yet more horses died from the cold and hunger and many of the men were barefoot and in rags when they arrived, having travelled a total of nearly .; After resupplying, French sent divisions D and E back east, before taking B, C and F to travel to Fort Whoop-Up. The expedition had been badly planned and executed, and almost failed; Baker describes it as \\"a monumental fiasco of poor planning, ignorance, incompetence, and cruelty to men and beasts\\".; Conclusion When the police arrived at Fort Whoop-Up on 9 October, they were prepared for a battle, but the whiskey traders were aware that they were coming and had long since moved on.; The NWMP had received new orders from Ottawa to garrison the area and settled down to build Fort Macleod on an island in Old Man's River. Legacy Early historians of the force stressed the epic nature of the expedition. The popular historian Arthur Haydon, for example, scorned the newspaper accounts which blamed the officers and men as \\"incapable\\", \\"inexperienced\\" and \\"careless\\", arguing that the march was \\"truly one of the most extraordinary on record\\", of which \\"all Canadians might well feel proud. By 1955, however, the historian Paul Sharp had suggested that the March West almost failed due to \\"misinformation, inexperience and ignorance\\" and criticism of the force's performance intensified after 1973. Ronald Atkin concludes that the expedition was \\"epic in its lack of organisation, in the poor way in which it was conducted and its incredibly close brush with disaster\\", Daniel Francis condemns it as \\"a fiasco of bad planning\\", with R. C. Macleod observing that \\"the difficulties of the Long March...were largely self-inflicted\\".; ; Nonetheless, it rapidly became portrayed by the force as epic story of bravery, endurance and determination.; ReferencesBibliography  * Category:Royal Canadian Mounted Police Category:Western Canada ","title":"March West"},{"id":"10082385","title":"Big Shot (song)"},{"id":"10082400","text":"Cheyenne Regional Medical Center (CRMC) is a hospital located in Cheyenne, Wyoming, USA.

Lean Hog futures and options are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), which introduced Lean Hog futures contracts in 1966. The contracts are for 40,000 pounds of Lean Hogs, and call for cash settlement based on the CME Lean Hog Index, which is a two-day weighted average of cash markets. Minimum tick size for the contract is $0.00025 per pound ($10 per contract). Trading on the contract are subject to price limits of $0.0375 per pound above or below the previous day's contract settlement price, with an exception that there shall be no daily price limits in the expiring month contract during the last 2 Trading Days. Lean Hog futures prices are widely used by U.S. pork producers as reference prices in marketing contracts for selling their hogs. Usage of marketing contracts tied to pork futures prices are correlated, and tend to increase, with the size of the producer. In addition, hog producers often trade pork futures contracts directly as part of a risk management program. Lean Hog futures prices are also a part of both the Bloomberg Commodity Index and the S&P; GSCI commodity index, which are benchmark indices widely followed in financial markets by traders and institutional investors. Its weighting in these commodity indices give Lean Hog futures prices non-trivial influence on returns on a wide range of investment funds and portfolios. Conversely, traders and investors have become non-trivial participants in the market for Lean Hog futures. Lean hog futures contracts are often grouped together with feeder cattle and live cattle futures contracts as livestock futures contracts. These commodities share many fundamental demand and supply risks, such long feeding periods, weather, feed prices, and consumer sentiment toward meat consumption, which makes grouping them together useful for commercial discussions about both the commodities and their futures contracts. Commodity indices have followed this practice and grouped these futures contracts together in livestock futures contracts categories.

Arcellinid testate amoebae are commonly found in soils, leaf litter, peat bogs and near/in fresh water. They use their pseudopodia, a temporary cell extension, for moving and taking in food. Like most amoebae, they are generally believed to reproduce asexually via binary fission. However a recent review suggests that sexual recombination may be the rule rather than the exception in amoeboid protists in general, including the Arcellinid testate amoebae. Test or shell Simple tests are made by secretion (autogenous tests), agglutination of foreign material (xenogenous tests), or sometimes a combination of both. Past environmental changes can be determined by analysing the composition of fossil tests, including the reconstruction of past climate change. Testate amoebae species have been used to reconstruct hydrological changes over the late Holocene, as a result of individual species possessing a narrow tolerance for ecohydrological conditions such as water-table depth or pH. Evolutionary history Fossils of arcellinid testate amoebae date back to the Cryogenian period. Also see Cryogenian Testate amoebae are theorized to be mostly polyphyletic (coming from more than one ancestral type), but testaceafilosea, one group of testate amoebae, are theorized to be monophyletic. Ancient tests of terrestrial fauna are commonly found in fossilized amber, although mid-Cretaceous testate amoeba (i.e., Diffligia, Cucurbitella) have been found in ancient lake sediments. It is likely that the group has evolved minimally over the course of the Phanerozoic. Classification The group contains the following taxa:Ralf Meisterfeld: Arcellinida, In: John J. Lee, Gordon F.

One of them, Nedra Talley, eventually became his wife. Ross and Talley celebrated their 52nd wedding anniversary in 2019.Scott Ross blogsite, cbn.com; accessed December 3, 2014. Ross later became a born- again Christian, and focused his professional efforts on the nascent contemporary Christian music genre. In the early 1970s, Ross started a new syndicated radio show, The Scott Ross Show, which at its peak was carried by more than 200 stations. During this same period time (late 60s and early 70s) he became a close friend of Harald Bredesen, pastor of First Reformed Church of Mount Vernon, New York, and was so impressed by Bredesen, who himself was on the Board of Directors of CBN, that he was invited by Bredesen to join him in Bredesen's selection of elders of his charismatic fewllowship when Bredesen was preparing to relocate go California. He ended up at CBN, which at the time also included The Family Channel among its outlets. He began as a personality on CBN's local radio station. His sometimes controversial comments often aroused the ire of the largely conservative Christian audience. Ross was a featured interviewer of The 700 Club, often talking with guests from the entertainment world, some of which he had worked with before his religious conversion. For three years, he hosted Scott Ross Straight Talk which was of a format similar to The Phil Donahue Show but from an evangelical Christian perspective. Ross was twice nominated for CableACE awards for this show.Ross profile, CBN.com; accessed December 3, 2014.1995 Article by Al Aronowitz about Ross in The Blacklisted Journalist, cbn.com; accessed December 3, 2014. Ross's various interviewees have included singers such as Johnny Cash, Sandi Patty, Amy Grant, Steven Spielberg, Noel Paul Stookey (of Peter Paul and Mary), Willie Nelson, Reba McEntire, and music promoter Marty Angelo, as well as spree killer David Berkowitz (\\"Son of Sam\\"). He remains with CBN and his interviews are still featured on The 700 Club. Over the years, Ross has filled in for Robertson on the show.Interview by Scott Marshall for The 700 Club: Scott Ross On His Time with Dylan, Hendrix, and Clapton, cbn.com; accessed December 3, 2014.

Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald through the basement of Dallas Police headquarters when Oswald was shot by Jack Ruby. Several photographs‚Äîincluding one that won a Pulitzer Prize‚Äîwere taken of Oswald just before and as Ruby pulled the trigger. Early life and military service Leavelle was born and raised in Red River County, Texas. In 1937, Leavelle joined the Civilian Conservation Corps. Following graduation from high school, Leavelle joined the United States Navy in 1939 (during World War II) and served as a sailor on board the ; he was on board the ship during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. In April 1942, the Whitney left Pearl Harbor and headed for the South Pacific Ocean to support operations there. After being knocked down and seriously injured by a rogue wave, he was evacuated to Oak Knoll Naval Hospital near Oakland, California. In the hospital, he met nurse Taimi Snelma, his wife-to-be. Around the same time, Leavelle left on a medical discharge to take a civilian supply job with the Army Air Force in Southern California. Police career After World War II ended, Leavelle worked as an auditor for the Veterans Administration until 1950. Leavelle began a career as a homicide detective in the Dallas Police Department in April 1950 and retired in April 1975. Kennedy assassination On November 24, 1963, two days after the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy, Lee Harvey Oswald was handcuffed between detectives Leavelle and L. C. Graves as he was being led through the basement of the Dallas Police Headquarters to an armored car for the short trip from the city jail to the county jail. Jack Ruby then stepped from the crowd and fatally shot Oswald at point-blank range. On March 25, 1964, Leavelle provided testimony to Warren Commission assistant counsel Leon Hubert. He provided additional testimony to assistant counsel Joseph Ball on April 7. When Leavelle testified before the Warren Commission, he said that the first time he had ever sat in on an interrogation with Oswald was on Sunday morning, November 24, 1963. When Counsel Joseph Ball asked Leavelle if he had ever spoken to Oswald before this interrogation, he stated, \\"No, I had never talked to him before\\". Leavelle then stated during his testimony that \\"the only time I had connections with Oswald was this Sunday morning [November 24, 1963]. I never had [the] occasion... to talk with him at any time...\\" The tan suit that Leavelle wore on November 24, 1963, is on display at the Sixth Floor Museum. Leavelle supported the official conclusion that Oswald acted alone and also refuted conspiracy theories surrounding the assassination. Portrayals Fifteen years after the assassination, Leavelle appeared as himself in the 1978 made-for-television movie, Ruby and Oswald. The character Leavelle, who trains Homer Simpson at \\"Leavelle's Bodyguard Academy\\" in The Simpsons' episode \\"Mayored to the Mob\\", is based on Leavelle, as he appeared when escorting Oswald when Oswald was shot by Ruby. Leavelle was voiced by Mark Hamill. Leavelle trains the bodyguards by pretending to shoot their protectee from a grassy knoll on a cart. This is a reference to the grassy knoll at the site of President John F. Kennedy‚Äôs assassination, Dealey Plaza and a scene from the Kennedy assassination film Executive Action (1973). \\"The Guy in the White Hat\\" Griffin, who appears in the Family Guy episode \\"Peter- assment\\", is based on Leavelle. Later life and death In December 1992, while demonstrating how L. C. Graves grabbed Ruby‚Äôs gun in an attempt to stop him from firing, Leavelle accidentally shot researcher and photographer Bob Porter in the arm, using the same model gun Ruby had used. Porter recovered at Parkland Hospital, the same facility where Kennedy, Oswald, and Ruby either died or were pronounced dead. In a 2006 interview, Leavelle said that he was the first to interrogate Oswald after his arrest; he said that he joked with Oswald before the transfer, saying \\"Lee, if anybody shoots at you, I hope they're as good a shot as you are,\\" meaning that the person would hit Oswald instead of Leavelle. Oswald smiled and said, \\"You're being melodramatic. Nobody's going to shoot at me.\\" In an interview with author Joseph McBride, Leavelle said he had different views on the murder of President Kennedy and Dallas police officer J. D. Tippit, describing the president's assassination as \\"no different than a south Dallas nigger killing...it was just another murder inside the city limits of Dallas. I‚Äôve handled hundreds of them.\\" Leavelle told McBride about Tippit, \\"What some people don‚Äôt realize is that when a police officer gets killed, that takes precedence over the shooting of the president, because that‚Äôs close to home.\\" Robert McClelland, who treated Oswald at Parkland Hospital, has said that while at Parkland, he noticed that Leavelle was waiting outside the hospital room and said that Leavelle told him that after Oswald was shot, he claimed to have \\"leaned over Oswald and said, 'Son, you're hurt real bad. Do you wanna say anything?' He looked at me for a second. He waited like he was thinking. Then he shook his head back and forth just as wide as he could. Then he closed his eyes.\\" In November 2011, Leavelle lost an eye after a serious fall, after which he wore a glass eye. In 2013, the Dallas Police Department's Detective of the Year Award was named in Leavelle's honor. After Leavelle's wife Taimi died in 2014, he lived in Garland, Texas. Leavelle died from a heart attack following hip surgery on August 29, 2019.

Plans to expel the Sudeten Germans  Czech districts with an ethnic German population in 1934 of 25% or more (pink), 50% or more (red), and 75% or more (dark red) in 1935 Following the Munich Agreement of 1938 and the Occupation of Bohemia and Moravia by Hitler in March 1939, Edvard Bene≈° set out to convince the Allies during World War II that expulsion was the best solution. Even Czechs who had moderate views towards the Germans agreed with the expulsion. The pro- Nazi Sudeten German Party had gained 88% of ethnic German votes in May 1938. Almost as soon as German troops occupied the Sudetenland in October 1938, Edvard Bene≈° and later the Czechoslovak Government-in-Exile pursued a twofold policy: the restoration of Czechoslovakia to its pre-Munich boundaries and the removal, through a combination of minor border rectifications and population transfer, of the state's German minority to restore the territorial integrity of state. Although the details changed along with British public and official opinion and pressure from Czech resistance groups, the broad goals of the Czechoslovak Government-in-Exile remained the same throughout the war. The pre-war policy of minority protection was now seen counterproductive (and the minorities themselves were seen as the source of unrest and instability), because it was associated with the destruction of the democratic r√©gime and the Czechoslovak state. Therefore, the Czechoslovak leaders made a decision to change the multi-ethnic character of the state to a state of 2 or 3 ethnicities (Czechs, Slovaks and initially also the Ruthenians). This goal was to be reached by the expulsion of the major part of minority members and the successive assimilation of the rest. Because almost all people of German and Magyar ethnicity gained German or Hungarian citizenship during the occupation of Czechoslovakia, the expulsion could be legalized as the banishment () of the foreigners.Miroslav Tr√°vn√≠ƒçek: Osidlov√°n√≠ s hlediska mezin√°rodn√≠ho a vnitrost√°tn√≠ho pr√°vn√≠ho ≈ô√°du.

Ingomar Pust Initially only a few hundred thousand Sudeten Germans were to be affected, people who were perceived as being disloyal to Czechoslovakia and who, according to Bene≈° and Czech public opinion, had acted as Hitler's \\"fifth column.\\" Due to escalation of Nazi atrocities in occupied Czechoslovakia the demands of the Czechoslovak Government-in-Exile, Czech resistance groups and also the wide majority of the Czechs for expulsion included more and more Germans, with no individual investigation of inference of guilt on their part, the only exception being 160,000 to 250,000 ethnic German \\"anti-fascists\\" and those ethnic Germans crucial for industries who were allowed to remain in Czechoslovakia. The Czechs and their government did not want Czechoslovakia to be burdened in future with a sizable German minority. The idea to expel the ethnic Germans from Czechoslovakia was supported by the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill\\"Churchill's Role in the Explusion of Germans from Easter Europe\\". Der Spiegel. 20 August 2010. and Britain's Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden. In 1942, the Czechoslovak Government-in-Exile received the support of the United Kingdom for the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia. In March 1943, President Bene≈° received Moscow's support. In June 1943, Bene≈° traveled to Washington, D.C. and obtained from President Franklin D. Roosevelt support for the Czechoslovak government's evolving expulsion plans.\\"The Myriad Chronicles\\". Johannes Rammund De Balliel-Lawrora, 2010. p. 113\\\\. During the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, especially after the Nazis' reprisal for the assassination of Heydrich, most of the Czech resistance groups demanded the final solution of the German question which would have to be solved by transfer or expulsion. These demands were adopted by the Government-in-Exile which, beginning in 1943, sought the support of the Allies for this proposal. The April 1945 Ko≈°ice Program, which outlined the postwar political settlement of Czechoslovakia, stipulated for the expulsion of Germans and Hungarians from the country. The final agreement for the transfer of the German minority however was not reached until 2 August 1945 at the end of Potsdam Conference. The drafter of article XIII of the Potsdam Communique concerning the expulsions, Sir Geoffrey Harrison, wrote on 31 July 1945 to Sir John Troutbeck, head of the German Department at the Foreign Office: \\"The Sub- Committee met three times, taking as a basis of discussion a draft which I circulated ... Sobolov took the view that the Polish and Czechoslovak wish to expel their German populations was the fulfilment of an historic mission which the Soviet Government were unwilling to try to impede....Cannon and I naturally strongly opposed this view. We made it clear that we did not like the idea of mass transfers anyway. As, however, we could not prevent them, we wished to ensure that they were carried out in as orderly and humane manner as possible...\\"(FO 371/46811, published in facsimile in A. de Zayas, Nemesis at Potsdam, pp. 232‚Äì34).  Germans in Czechoslovakia at the end of the war  Sudeten Germans are forced to walk past the bodies of 30 Jewish women starved to death by German SS troops in Volary (total of 95 women were tortured to death here) Developing a clear picture of the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia is difficult because of the chaotic conditions that existed at the end of the war. There was no stable central government and record-keeping was non-existent. Many of the events that occurred during the period were spontaneous and local rather than being the result of coordinated policy directives from a central government. Among these spontaneous events was the removal and detention of the Sudeten Germans which was triggered by the strong anti-German sentiment at the grass-roots level and organized by local officials. According to the Schieder commission, records of food rationing coupons show approximately 3,070,899 inhabitants of occupied Sudetenland in January 1945, which included Czechs or other non-Germans. In addition, most of the roughly 100,000 Carpathian Germans from Slovakia were evacuated on Himmler's orders to the Bohemia-Moravia region just before the end of the war. During April and May 1945, an estimated 1.6 million Germans from Polish Silesia fled the advancing Soviet forces and became refugees in Bohemia- Moravia. Thus according to German estimates there were 4.5 million German civilians present in Bohemia-Moravia in May 1945.  Chronology of the expulsions  From London and Moscow, Czech and Slovak political agents in exile followed an advancing Soviet army pursuing German forces westward, to reach the territory of the first former Czechoslovak Republic. Bene≈° proclaimed the programme of the newly appointed Czechoslovak government on 5 April 1945, in the northeastern city of Ko≈°ice, which included oppression and persecution of the non-Czech and non-Slovak populations of the partially restored Czechoslovak Republic. After the proclamation of the Ko≈°ice program, the German and Hungarian population living in the reborn Czechoslovak state were subjected to various forms of court procedures, citizenship revocations, property confiscation, condemnation to forced labour camps, and appointment of government managers to German and Hungarian owned businesses and farms, referred to euphemistically as \\"reslovakization.\\"  Role of the Czechoslovak army  The Potsdam Conference sanctioned the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia Western Czechoslovakia was liberated by U.S. forces under General Patton. General Zdenƒõk Nov√°k, head of the Prague military command \\"Alex\\", issued an order to \\"deport all Germans from territory within the historical borders.\\" A pamphlet issued on 5 June 1945 titled \\"Ten Commandments for Czechoslovak Soldiers in the Border Regions\\" directed soldiers that \\"The Germans have remained our irreconcilable enemies. Do not cease to hate the Germans ... Behave towards Germans like a victor ... Be harsh to the Germans ... German women and the Hitler Youth also bear the blame for the crimes of the Germans. Deal with them too in an uncompromising way.\\" On 15 June, a government decree directed the army to implement measures to apprehend Nazi criminals and carry out the transfer of the German population. On 27 July, the Ministry of National Defence issued a secret order directing the transfer should be carried out on as large a scale as possible, and as expeditiously as possible to present the Western powers with a fait accompli.  Bene≈° decrees  Between 1945 and 1948, a series of Czechoslovak government decrees, edicts, laws and statutes were proclaimed by the president of the republic, the Prague-based Czechoslovak Parliament, the Slovak National Council (Parliament) in Bratislava and by the Board of Slovak Commissioners (an appendage of the Czechoslovak government in Bratislava). Decrees 5, 12, 33, 108/1945 concerned the expropriation of wartime traitors and collaborators accused of treason but also all Germans and Hungarians. They also ordered the removal of citizenship from people of German and Hungarian ethnic origin who were treated collectively as collaborators (these provisions were cancelled for the Hungarians in 1948). This was then used to confiscate their property and expel around 90% of the ethnic German population of Czechoslovakia. These people were collectively accused of supporting the Nazis (through the Sudetendeutsche Partei (SdP), the political party led by Konrad Henlein) and the Third Reich's annexation of the Czech borderland in 1938. Decrees 33/1945 and 108/1945 explicitly stated that the sanctions did not apply to anti- fascists. Typically it was up to the decision of local municipalities. 160,000-250,000 Germans, some anti-fascists, but mostly people crucial for the industry remained in Czechoslovakia.  Massacres  The 1945 expulsion was referred to as the \\"wild transfer\\" (divok√Ω odsun) due to the widespread violence and brutality that were not only perpetuated by mobs but also by soldiers, police, and others acting under the color of authority. In the summer of 1945, for instance, there were localised massacres of the German population. The following examples are described in a study done by the European University Institute in Florence: The Expulsion of 'German' Communities from Eastern Europe at the end of the Second World War , Steffen Prauser and Arfon Rees, European University Institute, Florence. HEC No. 2004/1. pg. 18. * 18‚Äì19 June 1945, in the P≈ôerov incident, 71 men, 120 women and 74 children (265 Germans) who were Carpathian Germans from Dob≈°in√° were passing through Horn√≠ Mo≈°tƒõnice near P≈ôerov railway station. Here they were taken out of the train by Czechoslovakian soldiers, taken outside the city to a hill named \\"≈†v√©dsk√© ≈°ance\\", where they were forced to dig their own graves and all were shot.Verbrechen an Vertriebenen: Das Massaker von Prerau Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 18 June 2015 The massacre did not become publicly known until the fall of the Communist regime in 1989. * 20,000 Germans were forced to leave Brno for camps in Austria.

Accounts indicated that the Czechoslovak government was not averse to \\"popular justice\\" as long it did not excessively blacken the country's reputation abroad. There were even government officials who maintained that the massacres at Usti would not have happened if the government dealt with the Germans more harshly.  Internment camps  According to the German \\"Society against Expulsion\\", some Germans were sent to \\"concentration camps\\". A 1964 report by the German Red Cross stated that 1,215 \\"internment camps\\" were established, as well as 846 forced labour and \\"disciplinary centres\\", and 215 prisons, on Czechoslovak territory. Special Courts sentenced 21,469 persons to prison and 713 were executed for crimes committed during the Nazi occupation. They made rough estimate claiming 350,000 Germans in Czechoslovakia passed through one or more of these institutions and 100,000 perished.Kurt W. B√∂hme - Gesucht wird - Die dramtische Geschichte des Suchdienstes S√ºddeutscher Verlag, M√ºnchen 1965 Page 264 However the Red Cross was able to confirm only 6,989 deaths in the internment camps.Spiegel, Silke. ed. Vertreibung und Vertreibungsverbrechen 1945‚Äì1948. Bericht des Bundesarchivs vom 28. Mai 1974. Archivalien und ausgew√§hlte Erlebnisberichte.. Bonn: Kulturstiftung der deutschen Vertriebenen. (1989). . Page 47 According to Alfred de Zayas:  Expulsions  Germans living in the border regions of Czechoslovakia were expelled from the country in late 1945. The joint German and Czech commission of historians estimated that there were about 15,000 violent deaths. Czech records report 15,000-16,000 deaths not including an additional 6,667 unexplained cases or suicides during the expulsion, and others died from hunger and illness in Germany as a consequence. In 1946, an estimated 1.3 million ethnic Germans were deported to the American zone of what would become West Germany. An estimated 800,000 were deported to the Soviet zone (in what would become East Germany).  Act No. 115/1946 Coll.  On 8 May 1946 the Czechoslovak provisional National Assembly passed Act No. 115/1946 Coll. It was enacted in conjunction with the Bene≈° decrees and it specifies that \\"Any act committed between 30 September 1938 and 28 October 1945 the object of which was to aid the struggle for liberty of the Czechs and Slovaks or which represented just reprisals for actions of the occupation forces and their accomplices, is not illegal, even when such acts may otherwise be punishable by law.\\" This law, which is still in force, has de facto ensured that no atrocities against Germans during the time-period in question have been prosecuted in Czechoslovakia. However, the Czech government did express its regret in the 1997 Joint Czech‚ÄìGerman Declaration on the Mutual Relations and their Future Development:  Results  The joint Czech‚ÄìGerman commission of historians in 1996 stated the following numbers: the deaths caused by violence and abnormal living conditions amount approximately to 10,000 persons killed; another 5,000‚Äì6,000 persons died of unspecified reasons related to expulsion; making the total number of victims of the expulsion 15,000‚Äì16,000 (this excludes suicides, which make another approximately 3400 cases.  Legacy  The UN Human Rights Committee issued decisions in three cases concerning Sudeten Germans (Des Fours Walderode v. Czech Republic; Petzoldova v. Czech Republic; Czernin v. Czech Republic) in which violations of articles 26 and 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights were established and the Czech Republic was ordered to return the property to the rightful owners. As of 2010, the Committee's views had not been implemented.Jakob Th. M√∂ller, United Nations Human Rights Committee Case Law, N.P.Engel Verlag, Kehl am Rhein 2009 Public opinion surveys indicate that the public is opposed to such measures. According to an article in the Prague Daily Monitor: In the Czech‚ÄìGerman Declaration of August, 1997: German politicians and the deported Sudeten Germans widely use the word \\"expulsion\\" for the events. However, political representatives in both the Czech Republic and Poland, from where millions of Germans had to move after WW2, usually avoid this expression and rather use the word \\"deportation.\\", Retrieved April 4, 2007{{dead linkdate=May 2016bot=medic  Compensation to expellees  The British Foreign Office and the U.S. State Department planned a \\"population transfer commission\\" similar to the arrangement in the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923 to provide compensation for private property to transferred Greeks and Turks following the Kemalist war of 1919‚Äì1923. But events went faster and the expulsions began in May 1945, long before the Potsdam Conference and before any agreement on a commission had been settled. No population transfer commission with competence to evaluate the claims of the German expellees was ever established. (See Public Record Office documents FO 371/46810 and FO 371/46811). Since the Czechoslovak government-in-exile decided that population transfer was the only solution of the German question, the problem of reparation (war indemnity) was closely associated. The proposed population transfer as presented in negotiations with the governments of U.S., UK and U.S.S.R., presumed the confiscation of the Germans' property to cover the reparation demands of Czechoslovakia; then Germany should pay the compensation to satisfy its citizens. This fait accompli was to prevent Germany's evasion of reparation payment as happened after World War I. This plan was suggested to the Inter-Allied Reparation Agency (IARA) in 1945, but because of the advent of the Cold War was never confirmed by any treaty with Germany. The IARA ended its activity in 1959 and the status quo is as follows: Czech Republic kept the property of expelled ethnic Germans while Germany did not pay any reparations (only about 0.5% of Czechoslovak demands were satisfied ). For this reason, every time the Sudeten Germans request compensation or the abolition of the Bene≈° decrees, the Czech side strikes back by the threat of reparation demands. Even during the preparation of the Czech‚ÄìGerman declaration, the German side avoided the Czech demand to confirm the status quo by the agreement. However, Germany adopted the Czechoslovak fait accompli and has paid compensation to the expellees. One source claims the German government paid about 141bn DM to the expellees until 1993. Other sources state an overall amount of roughly 60bn EUR paid out as partial compensation to all citizens of Germany and ethnic-German expellees ‚Äî a group of 15m people alone ‚Äî affected by property loss due to consequences of the war.Lastenausgleichsgesetz (in German) The payout to Germans from Czechoslovakia can be assumed to represent a much smaller fraction of that sum. In contrast to Germany, the issue of compensation of expellees was, at least nominally, closed by several treaties with Austria and Hungary. The most important follow: * Treaty of 19 December 1974: According to this treaty, Czechoslovakia pledged to pay 1,000,000,000 ATS to cover the property demands of Austrian citizens and waived all former territory and all other demands of country or individuals against Austria. The Austrian side waived all demands against ƒåSSR and pledged to not support any demands of individuals against the ƒåSSR related to expulsion. * Treaty of 3 February 1964: According to this treaty, Czechoslovakia pledged to satisfy all demands of Hungary and Hungarian citizens related to confiscations by paying 20,000,000 Kƒçs.

One of the few hotspots in North America, the Anahim plume is responsible for the creation of the Anahim Volcanic Belt. This is a long chain of volcanoes and other magmatic features that have undergone erosion. The chain extends from the community of Bella Bella in the west to near the small city of Quesnel in the east. While most volcanoes are created by geological activity at tectonic plate boundaries, the Anahim hotspot is located hundreds of kilometres away from the nearest plate boundary. This hotspot's existence was first proposed in the 1970s by three scientists who used John Tuzo Wilson's classic hotspot theory. This theory proposes that a single, fixed mantle plume builds volcanoes that then, cut off from their source by the movement of the North American Plate, become increasingly inactive and eventually erode over millions of years. A more recent theory, published in 2001 by the Geological Society of America, suggests that the Anahim hotspot might be supplied by a mantle plume from the upper mantle rather than a deep-seated plume proposed by Wilson. The plume has since been tomographically imaged, showing it to be roughly deep. This measurement, however, could be an underestimate as the plume might originate deeper within Earth. Volcanism as early as 14.5 million years ago has been linked to the Anahim hotspot, with the latest eruption having taken place in the last 8,000 years. This volcanic activity has produced rocks that show a bimodal distribution in composition. While these rocks were being deposited, the hotspot coincided with periods of crustal extension and uplift. Activity in modern times has been limited to earthquakes and volcanic gas emissions. Theories Sketch showing the multi-scale nature of mantle plumes, which involves the creation of the lower-mantle superplume from the D layer and generation of the upper-mantle plumes from the low-viscosity layer below . Tectonic plates generally focus deformation and volcanism at plate boundaries. However, the Anahim hotspot is about from the nearest plate boundary. While studying the Anahim Volcanic Belt in 1979, Canadian geologists Mary Bevier, Richard Armstrong and Jack Souther used the hotspot theory to explain this zone of volcanism so far from regular conditions. The theory was first invented by Canadian geophysicist John Tuzo Wilson in 1963 to explain the formation of the Hawaiian Islands. Wilson's stationary hotspot theory In 1963, Wilson proposed that small, long lasting, exceptionally hot areas of magma exist under Earth's surface; these heat centres create thermally active mantle plumes, which in turn sustain long-lasting volcanic activity. This \\"intra-plate\\" volcanism builds peaks that rise above the surrounding landscape. Plate tectonics cause the local tectonic plate (in the case of the Anahim hotspot, the North American Plate) to slowly slide over the hotspot, carrying its volcanoes with it without affecting the plume. Over hundreds of thousands of years, the magma supply for the volcano is slowly cut off, eventually going extinct. No longer active enough to overpower erosion, the volcano slowly erodes away. As the cycle continues, a new volcanic centre manifests and a volcanic peak arises anew. The process continues until the mantle plume itself collapses. This cycle of growth and dormancy strings together volcanoes over millions of years, leaving a trail of volcanic mountains and intrusions extending from coastal British Columbia across the Coast Mountains into the Interior Plateau. According to Wilson's theory, the Anahim volcanoes should be progressively older and increasingly eroded the further they are from the hotspot and this is easily observable; the oldest rock on coastal British Columbia, that of the Gale Passage dike swarm, is about 14.5 million years old and deeply eroded, while the rock at Nazko Cone, the hotspot's present centre, is a comparatively young 0.34 million years of age or less. Radiocarbon dating of peat directly above and below a tephra layer extending from Nazko Cone suggest that the latest eruption occurred approximately 7,200 years ago. Path of the Anahim hotspot over the last 14.5 million years Geophysicists believe that hotspots originate at one or two major boundaries deep in the Earth, either a shallow interface in the lower mantle between an upper convecting layer and a lower non-convecting layer, or a deeper D‚Ä≥ (\\"D double-prime\\") layer, approximately thick and immediately above the core-mantle boundary. A mantle plume would initiate at the interface when the warmer lower layer heats a portion of the cooler upper layer. This heated, buoyant and less-viscous portion of the upper layer would become less dense due to thermal expansion and rise towards the surface as a Rayleigh- Taylor instability. When the mantle plume reaches the base of the lithosphere, the plume heats it and produces melt. This magma then makes its way to the surface, where it is erupted as lava. Arguments for the validity of the hotspot theory generally centre on the steady age progression of Anahim volcanoes and nearby features: a similar eastward-younging spatiotemporal trend exists for the Yellowstone hotspot track to the southeast. The presence of two hotspot tracks on the same continent and their general agreement between each other provides a unique tool in assessing and testing the motion of North America. Shallow hotspot theory Another hypothesis is that the Anahim hotspot is supplied by a miniplume. These mantle plumes have their roots in the upper mantle but they may later originate from the lower mantle. Arguments for an Anahim miniplume are centred on the existence of two small dike swarms at the western (hence oldest) end of the Anahim Volcanic Belt. This assumption is in turn based on the notion that giant dike swarms mark the arrival of deep-seated mantle plumes. History of study In 1977, Jack Souther produced a synthesis of volcanism in the Canadian Cordillera and delineated several Neogene-to-Quaternary volcanic belts throughout British Columbia. One of these was the linear Anahim Volcanic Belt, which included the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field at its eastern end. However, its origin had not yet been understood. In 1979, two volcano tectonic models had been proposed by Jack Souther, Mary Bevier and Richard Armstrong. This included a hotspot and a propagating crack controlled by stress fields related to large- scale plate tectonics of western North America. internal structure Garry C. Rogers of the Geological Survey of Canada speculated in his 1981 NRC Research Press article McNaughton Lake seismicity‚Äîmore evidence for an Anahim hotspot? that earthquake swarms at McNaughton Lake (now called Kinbasket Lake) may be related to the Anahim hotspot. Rogers noted that if the seismicity is related to a hotspot the surface expression must be lagging behind the passage of the hotspot. An alternative theory proposed by Rogers is that if the Anahim hotspot is located under the Wells Gray-Clearwater area, the stress field surrounding the hotspot must precede it by approximately . In 1987, Canadian volcanologist Catherine Hickson revealed that the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field is not part of the Anahim Volcanic Belt, but rather a separate centre that most likely represents an area of lithospheric decompression melting caused by rifting along pre-existing crustal fractures. The Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field has since not been considered part of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and the Anahim hotspot is now believed to be in the area of Nazko Cone. The existence of an Anahim hotspot was supported in a detailed Bulletin of Volcanology report by Kuehn et al. (2015). This included new geochemical and geochronometric data for the Baldface Mountain and Satah Mountain volcanic fields, as well as for Nazko Cone. The data obtained indicated that volcanism in the two volcanic fields were contemporaneous with the Itcha Range shield volcano and that both fields agree with the vector of the North American Plate motion over a hotspot in the British Columbia Interior. It was also noted that the trace and rare-earth element patterns of mafic lavas in the Anahim Volcanic Belt are similar to ocean island basalts, providing more evidence for a hotspot. Characteristics=Position The Anahim hotspot has been imaged through seismic tomography and is estimated to be wide. Recent high-resolution local tomography indicates a possible lower- mantle plume and a pond of plume material is evidenced by a large low-velocity zone in the upper mantle. These low seismic velocity zones often indicate hotter and more buoyant mantle material. The low-velocity zone is flanked on both sides by high-velocity anomalies of variable amplitude. In the north, high-velocities may reflect the remains of batholithic roots that formed as a result of continuous subduction along the northern continental margin 150 to 50 million years ago. High velocities in the south represent the subducting Juan de Fuca slab. Centered near Nazko Cone, the low-velocity zone extends to a depth of approximately . However, it may extend deeper southward beneath the Juan de Fuca Plate through the transition zone into the lower mantle. This has led to the conclusion that the Anahim hotspot is supplied by a mantle plume over slab edge flow. Movement Individual volcanoes drift southwest from the hotspot at a rate of about per year with each successive volcanic centre spending about two million years actively attached to the plume. The oldest Anahim volcano, situated on the Central Coast of British Columbia, formed 14.5 million years ago. If any prior record in the form of seamounts existed off the British Columbia Coast, this record would presumably have been subducted under North America with the Farallon/Juan de Fuca plates and lost. Thus it is unknown if the hotspot existed in the Pacific Ocean prior to being located on the North American continent from ongoing plate motion. However, past geologic field mapping and geochemical studies suggest massive plutons could be present in the offshore continental shelf. These suspected bodies are aligned with the northeast-trending Anahim Volcanic Belt, whose age progression suggests these suspected offshore plutons could be of Miocene age. An earlier displaced portion of the hotspot track might exist on Haida Gwaii as part of the Masset Formation. However, further analyses of Masset volcanic rocks are still required to determine if they are compositionally and istopically similar to alkalic lavas found on the mainland. Magma The Itcha Range as seen from the south with a forested volcanic cone in the foreground The composition of the volcanoes' magma has changed significantly with time as they grow over the hotspot and migrate away. Volcanic activity 14.5 to 3.0 million years ago was predominately felsic, producing large volumes of rhyolite and trachyte lava. This can be explained by the presence of thick granitic structures under these volcanoes, which have been tectonically compressed from being near the North American Plate margin. A unique characteristic of the felsic lava flows is that although they were high in silica content, the flows were overly fluid in nature. This is because the peralkaline content of these felsic lavas decreased the viscosity of the flows a minimum of 10‚Äì30 times over that of calc-alkaline felsic flows. Evidence for explosive volcanism exists in the form of pumice flows, bedded tuffs, intensely shattered basement rocks and the high content of coarse basement clasts in rhyolite breccias. Magma production of the Anahim hotspot has shifted from more felsic to more mafic compositions in the last 3.0 million years. For instance, much of the magma created between 3.0 and 0.33 million years ago was igneous phonolite, trachyte, trachyandesite, basalt and basanite; the volcanoes built during this period are almost entirely made of these rock types. Other igneous rocks such as phonotephrite are present in smaller quantities; these occur in the Satah Mountain volcanic field. Volcanic eruptions in the last 0.33 million years have been mainly basanitic and have occurred at the youngest eruptive centre, Nazko Cone. Basanites produced by these eruptions are significantly more undersaturated than basalts from older Anahim volcanoes in the west and may indicate an eastward shift toward a deeper or less depleted mantle source. It is also possible that as the North American Plate moves over the Anahim hotspot, it underlies thinner continental crust. The overall chemistry and mineralogy of the Anahim magmas are analogous to regions of incipient continental rifting above a mantle plume. Volcanoes Over the last 14.5 million years, the Anahim hotspot has created at least 40 volcanoes. They can be organized into three groupings: the eastern section, which comprises several small cinder cones and is the location of all modern volcanic activity; the central section, which consists of predominantly shield volcanoes; and the western section, all of which have since been reduced to remnants of eruptive breccia and high-level plutons and dike swarms. These form one of the six Neogene-Quaternary volcanic provinces in British Columbia. Volcanic characteristics Depth relationships and compositional correlation of plutonic, hypabyssal and volcanic rocks exposed in the western Anahim Belt The Anahim volcanoes are grouped into three types: volcanic cones, shield volcanoes and lava domes. The shields are characterized by their large size (hundreds of kilometres in volume) and their symmetrical shape. They are the most prominent of the three volcano types, with the Rainbow Range being the highest at around above sea level. Their outer slopes merge with older flat-lying basalt flows of the Chilcotin Group, which covers a large percentage of the Interior Plateau. The more abundant lava domes and volcanic cones are much smaller in size (less than one kilometre in volume). These comprise two extensive volcanic fields in the vicinity of the Itcha Range. Although many Anahim volcanoes are surrounded by Chilcotin Group basalt flows, the exact nature of their relationship is unknown. It is unlikely that the Anahim volcanoes ever were a source area for the Chilcotin basalts as they have distinct transitional geochemistries. The Chilcotin Group is interpreted to be related to back-arc extension behind the Cascadia subduction zone. Evolution and construction Each volcano type produced by the Anahim hotspot has its own unique life cycle of growth and erosion. Volcanic cones have their origins from tephra accumulating around vents during Strombolian eruptions. They are composed of trachyte, trachyandesite, basalt, phonolite, basanite and to a lesser extent phonotephrite. In contrast, lava domes are formed mainly by viscous trachytic magma that erupts effusively onto the surface and then piles up thick around vents. Most of these features are formed only by a single volcanic eruption and are therefore monogenetic in nature. However, in some cases several eruptions occur at a single locus to create larger, polygenetic centres (e.g. Satah Mountain, Baldface Mountain, Nazko Cone). Once activity has ended, erosion eventually reduces them into volcanic remnants such as lava plugs. Shield volcanoes undergo at least two stages of volcanic activity. The initial shield stage is the most productive volcanically and features repeated eruptions of large volumes of predominately fluid peralkaline felsic magmas that become progressively more evolved. During this stage, a small summit caldera may form, as is the case for the Ilgachuz Range. After the shield stage has been completed, the post-shield stage succeeds. This stage of activity is characterized by small volumes of more mafic lavas expressed as small cinder cones and capping flows. Dissection of the shield by stream erosion is also apparent, resulting in the creation of deeply incised radial valleys. Prolonged erosion eventually removes most if not all traces of the volcanoes to expose their underlying solidified magma systems. Such systems can be below the surface with rocks ranging from hypabyssal to plutonic. Exposure of the King Island Pluton and the Bella Bella and Gale Passage dike swarms are prime examples of this phase of erosion. Tectonic history=Extensional tectonics Queen Charlotte Sound as delineated by BC Geographical Names, along with Hecate Strait and Dixon Entrance. Rifting and crustal extension in Queen Charlotte Sound up to about 17 million years ago has been linked to the Early Miocene passage of the Anahim hotspot. Yorath and Chase (1981) proposed that subcrustal melting above the Anahim plume resulted in weakening of the regional crust, setting the stage for rift development. Later, widespread volcanism produced subearial basalt and rhyolite flows in the region of the rift and along transcurrent faults that extend towards the northwest. Haida Gwaii was displaced approximately to the north along a series of faults extending through Sandspit and Louscoone Islet. This period of rifting and crustal extension contributed to the formation of the Queen Charlotte Basin. While the rift was in development, a conservative plate boundary would have extended northwards from the landward end of the rift. Such a plate boundary might have been similar to the Gulf of California ‚Äì San Andreas fault system in the U.S. state of California. This type of configuration need have existed for only a few million years to have generated the of opening in the rift. Alternatively, the Haida Gwaii block may have been only partially coupled to the offshore plate during a longer period of oblique convergence. Bathyal sediments, perhaps as young as 15 million years, were deposited within the rift zone during and after the rifting took place as the Anahim hotspot passed by. Uplift Starting about 10 million years ago, the Anahim hotspot began to pass under the Bella Coola‚ÄìOcean Falls region. This coincided with increased regional uplift of the south-central Coast Mountains. After the hotspot reached the Chilcotin Plateau 8 million years ago, uplift had decreased. This suggests that the uplift could have been thermally driven by the Anahim hotspot, which thinned the lithosphere and caused changes in sub-crustal and surface heat flux. About of uplift was achieved during the hotspot's time in the south- central Coast Mountains over a period of a few million years. Hotspot‚Äìfault interactions The Anahim hotspot was stationed in a tectonically complex region of the Chilcotin Plateau between 3.9 and 1.4 million years ago. This complexity may have given rise to interactions of the hotspot with pre- existing fracture systems, such that magma rose along normal faults to create a long north‚Äìsouth chain of volcanoes. The Itcha Range developed directly over the intersection whereas the Satah Mountain volcanic field developed along the more distal portions of the fracture system and away from the Itcha Range. A lack of extensive volcanic fields adjacent to the neighbouring Ilgachuz and Rainbow ranges might indicate an absence of fracture systems associated with those volcanoes. Historical activity Volcanic eruptions are not known to have occurred from the Anahim hotspot in historical times. However, since 2007 there have been recorded volcano tectonic earthquakes and carbon dioxide emissions in the vicinity of Nazko Cone. The lack of evidence for historic seismicity prior to 2007 suggests that the area is tectonically stable, making the Nechako Basin one of the most seismically inactive areas of British Columbia. Seismicity World distribution of proposed hotspots, with the Anahim hotspot numbered 45. From October 9, 2007 to May 15, 2008, a series of earthquakes measuring up to 2.9 magnitude occurred in the Nechako Basin some west of Nazko Cone. Most of these tremors occurred below the surface, indicating they originated within the lowermost crust. Analysis of seismic waves suggest that the earthquake swarm was caused by brittle failure and fracturing of rock at depth from magma intrusion. No volcanic eruption was likely as the number and size of the seismic events were too small. Nevertheless, this suggests that the Anahim hotspot is seismically active and that small magma movements are still possible. Although these earthquakes were too small to be felt, they generated substantial local interest as they represented a significant concentration of seismic activity within the Anahim Volcanic Belt. Carbon dioxide emissions Vigorous degassing of carbon dioxide occurs from several vents in two bogs near Nazko Cone. These vents are in the form of small isolated travertine mounds on the bog surface. A mound with a partially submerged vent had been identified in 2013 with a steady flow of carbon dioxide. Several new vents with no travertine mound were actively releasing carbon dioxide gas in 2015. Analysis of the carbon-13 isotope in the carbon dioxide gas emissions suggest a magmatic origin. This has led to the possibility of a volcanic geothermal system, the existence of which has been investigated by Geoscience BC as part of their Targeting Resources for Exploration and Knowledge project. The lack of hot springs and geothermal evidence on the surface suggest that the heat source of such a system would be very deep underground. Volcanic hazards The Anahim hotspot is set in a remote location accessed by a network of logging roads from Quesnel on Highway 97. Because of this, the most immediate hazard relating to future eruptions is of local concern only. Although not heavily populated, the area is home to forestry operations and the small community of Nazko. The presence of burned wood within Nazko tephra suggests that this area is prone to forest fires caused by volcanic eruptions. Also, if an eruption column were to be produced, it would disrupt local air traffic. Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure, as well as damage to other aircraft systems. Renewed volcanism is likely to result in the creation of mafic cinder cones, with the latest such event having occurred with the eruption of Nazko Cone 7,200 years ago. However, eruptions of less mafic magma, typical of earlier activity of the Anahim hotspot, cannot be ruled out.

According to the Hockney‚ÄìFalco thesis, such devices were central to much of the great art from the Renaissance period to the dawn of modern art. The Hockney‚ÄìFalco thesis is a theory of art history, advanced by artist David Hockney and physicist Charles M. Falco. Both claimed that advances in realism and accuracy in the history of Western art since the Renaissance were primarily the result of optical instruments such as the camera obscura, camera lucida, and curved mirrors, rather than solely due to the development of artistic technique and skill. Nineteenth-century artists' use of photography had been well documented. In a 2001 book, Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters, Hockney analyzed the work of the Old Masters and argued that the level of accuracy represented in their work is impossible to create by \\"eyeballing it\\". Since then, Hockney and Falco have produced a number of publications on positive evidence of the use of optical aids, and the historical plausibility of such methods. The hypothesis led to a variety of conferences and heated discussions. Setup of the 2001 publication Part of Hockney's work involved collaboration with Charles Falco, a condensed matter physicist and an expert in optics. While the use of optical aids would generally enhance accuracy, Falco calculated the types of distortion that would result from specific optical devices; Hockney and Falco argued that such errors could in fact be found in the work of some of the Old Masters.Charles Falco, FAQ (accessed March 16, 2007). Hockney's book prompted intense and sustained debate among artists, art historians, and a wide variety of other scholars. In particular, it has spurred increased interest in the actual methods and techniques of artists among scientists and historians of science, as well as general historians and art historians. The latter have in general reacted unfavorably, interpreting the Hockney‚ÄìFalco thesis as an accusation that the Old Masters \\"cheated\\" and intentionally obscured their methods. Physicist David G. Stork and several co-authors have argued against the Hockney‚ÄìFalco thesis from a technical standpoint.Christopher W. Tyler, \\"Rosetta Stoned?\\" Diatrope.com Hockney and Falco's theory has already inspired an increase in research regarding the use of optics throughout the history of art. For instance, there was the case of the decade-long research on Rembrandt's works conducted by painter Francis O'Neill. In the published paper he wrote with Sofia Palazzo Corner entitled, Rembrandt's Self-portraits, O'Neill presented recurring themes in the painter's works that serve as evidence in his use of mirrors, particularly, in his self-portraits. These include the use of chiaroscuro, which is a signature of the lighting conditions necessary for projections as well as Rembrandt's off-center gaze in his self-portraits, which - according to O'Neill - indicated that the artist might have been looking at a projection surface off to the side rather than straight onto a flat mirror. Origins of the thesis Detail from Husband and Wife by Lorenzo Lotto (1523): Hockney realized that the rug pattern goes out of focus in the painting, something that would only happen when using a lens Aaron Scharf's 1968 book Art and Photography, which details evidence of the use of photographs and the camera by painters, is referred to by Hockney in his 1977 painting My Parents (Tate, London) in which his father is depicted attentively reading the volume. Scharf notes in his introduction that in 1568 Daniele Barbaro, the Venetian writer on architecture, recommended the camera obscura as an aid to artists: \\"By holding the paper steady you can trace the whole perspective outline with a pen, shade it, and delicately colour it from nature.\\" As described in Secret Knowledge, in January 1999 during a visit to the National Gallery, London, Hockney conceived of the idea that optical aids were the key factor in the development of artistic realism. He was struck by the accuracy of portraits by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, and became convinced that Ingres had used a camera lucida or similar device. From there, Hockney began looking for signs of the use of optical aids in earlier paintings, creating what he called the Great Wall in his studio by organizing images of great realistic art by time period. What he saw as a sudden rise of realism around 1420, combined with Charles Falco's suggestion that concave mirrors could have been used in that period to project images, was the germ of the Hockney‚ÄìFalco thesis. In 2000, Falco and Hockney published an analysis (\\"Optical Insights into Renaissance Art\\") of the likely use of concave mirrors in Jan van Eyck's work in Optics & Photonics News, vol. 11. In 2001, Hockney published an extended form of his argument in Secret Knowledge. The hypothesis that technology was used in the production of Renaissance Art was not much in dispute in early studies and literature. The 1929 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica contained an extensive article on the camera obscura and cited Leon Battista Alberti as the first documented user of the device as early as 1437. The discussion started by the Hockney‚ÄìFalco thesis ignored the abundant evidence for widespread use of various technical devices, at least in the Renaissance, and, e.g., Early Netherlandish painting. Hockney's argument Detail of the chandelier and mirror from Jan van Eyck's 1434 Arnolfini Portrait, one of Hockney's key examples In Secret Knowledge, Hockney argues that early Renaissance artists such as Jan van Eyck and Lorenzo Lotto used concave mirrors; as evidence, he points to the chandelier in Van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait, the ear in Van Eyck's portrait of Cardinal Albergati, and the carpet in Lotto's Husband and Wife. Hockney suggests that later artists, beginning with Caravaggio, used convex mirrors as well, to achieve a large field of view. Secret Knowledge recounts Hockney's search for evidence of optical aids in the work of earlier artists, including the assembly of a \\"Great Wall\\" of the history of Western art. The 15th century work of Jan van Eyck seems to be the turning point, he argues, after which elements of realism became increasingly prominent. He correlates shifts toward increased realism with advances in optical technologies. The argument of Secret Knowledge is primarily a visual one, as Hockney was largely unable to determine when and how optical aids were used by textual or direct evidence. Falco and Ibn al- Haytham At a scientific conference in February 2007, Falco further argued that the Arabic physicist Ibn al-Haytham's (965‚Äì1040) work on optics, in his Book of Optics, may have influenced the use of optical aids by Renaissance artists. Falco said that his and Hockney's examples of Renaissance art \\"demonstrate a continuum in the use of optics by artists from c. 1430, arguably initiated as a result of Ibn al-Haytham's influence, until today.\\" Criticism=Artist's skill Art historians and others have criticized Hockney's argument on the grounds that the use of optical aids, though well- established in individual cases, has little value for explaining the overall development of Western art, and that historical records and paintings and photographs of art studios (sans optical devices), as well as present-day realist artists, demonstrate that high levels of realism are possible without optical aids. Optical distortion In addition to incredulity on the part of art historians and critics of modern art, some of the harshest criticism of the Hockney‚ÄìFalco thesis came from another expert in optics, image processing and pattern recognition, David G. Stork. Stork analyzed the images used by Falco and Hockney, and came to the conclusion that they do not demonstrate the kinds of optical distortion that curved mirrors or converging lenses would cause.David G. Stork, FAQ (accessed March 16, 2007). Falco has claimed that Stork's published criticisms have relied on fabricated data and misrepresentations of Hockney and Falco's theory. Stork has rebutted this claim. Renaissance optics Diagram illustrating Grosseteste's theory, in De Nat. Loc. (see pp. 122, 149) of the focusing of the sun's rays by a spherical lens; from Roger Bacon's Opus Maius, late 13th century Critics of the Hockney‚ÄìFalco theory claim that the quality of mirrors and optical glass for the period before 1550 and a lack of textual evidence (excluding paintings themselves as \\"documentary evidence\\") of their use for image projection during this period casts doubt on the theory. Historians are more inclined to agree about the possible relevance of the thesis between 1550 and the invention of the telescope, and cautiously supportive after that period, when there clearly was interest and capacity to project realistic images; 17th century painters such as Johannes Vermeer and Gaspar van Wittel used optical devices in a variety of ways, though not the ways postulated by Hockney. pp. 128‚Äì135; quotation from p. 131 Leaving the technical optical arguments aside, historians of science investigated several aspects of the historical plausibility of the thesis in a 2005 set of articles in Early Science and Medicine. In his introduction to the volume, Sven Dupr√© claimed the Hockney‚ÄìFalco analysis rests heavily on a small number of examples, \\"a few dozen square centimeters\\" of canvas that seem to show signs that optical devices were used. Image projection Leonardo da Vinci. On the eye and vision. Leonardo's notebooks include several designs for creating concave mirrors. Leonardo also describes a camera obscura in his Codex Atlanticus of 1478‚Äì1519. The camera obscura was well known for centuries and documented by Ibn al-Haitham in his Book of Optics of 1011‚Äì1021. In 13th-century England Roger Bacon described the use of a camera obscura for the safe observation of solar eclipses, exactly because the viewer looks at the projected image and not the sun itself. David Lindberg's A Catalogue of Medieval and Renaissance Optical Manuscripts (Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies, 1974) lists 61 manuscripts written in the years 1000‚Äì1425. These manuscripts not only describe methods for making mirrors and parabolic mirrors but also discuss their use for image projection. Optical glass Sara J. Schechner claimed that surviving glassware from the 15th and 16th centuries is far too imperfect to have been used to create realistic images, while \\"even thinking about projecting images was alien to the contemporary conceptual frame of mind.\\" Vincent Ilardi, a historian of Renaissance optical glass, subsequently argued against Schechner's conclusions based on surviving glassware, suggesting that the present condition of Renaissance glassware is not likely to reflect the optical quality of such glassware when it was new. Ilardi documents Lorenzo Lotto's purchase of a high-priced crystal mirror in 1549, bolstering the Hockney‚ÄìFalco thesis in Lotto's case. Furthermore, even normal eyeglasses (spectacles) can also project images of sufficient optical quality to support the Hockney‚ÄìFalco thesis and such eyeglasses, along with magnifying glasses and mirrors, were not only available at the time, but actually pictured in 14th century paintings by artists such as Tommaso da Modena. Van Leeuwenhoek's microscopes depicted by Henry Baker Dutch draper and pioneering microbiologist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632‚Äì1723), a contemporary of artist Vermeer (and an executor for Vermeer when he died in 1675) in Delft was known to have exceptional lens making skills, having created single small lenses capable of 200x magnification, far exceeding those of more complex compound microscopes of the period. Indeed, his feats of lens making were not matched for a considerable time as he kept aspects of their construction secret; in the 1950s, C.L. Stong used thin glass thread fusing instead of polishing to recreate Leeuwenhoek design microscopes. It was long believed that Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was a master lens grinder (a notion repeated in the recent BBC television documentary \\"Cell\\"). However, it is now believed that he came upon a relatively simple method of making small, high quality glass spheres by heating and manipulating a small rod of soda lime glass. Metal mirrors On his website, Falco also claims Schechner overlooked manuscript evidence for the use of mirrors made from steel and other metals, as well as numerous metal artifacts that belie the claim that sufficiently large and reflective metal mirrors were unavailable, and that other contributors to the Early Science and Medicine volume relied on Schechner's mistaken work in dismissing the thesis. Earlier evidence of the use of optical tools Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington, 1434-1436) with three crown glass windows behind Mary Mirror depicted in the 1434 Arnolfini Portrait Don Ihde called the hypothesis being 'hyped' and referred to clear evidence about the use of optical tools by, e.g., Albrecht D√ºrer and Leonardo da Vinci and others. As well the 1929 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica contains an extensive article on the camera obscura and cites Leon Battista Alberti as the first documented user of the device as early as 1437. Ihde states abundant evidence for widespread use of various technical devices at least in the Renaissance and e.g. in Early Netherlands painting. Jan van Eyck's 1434 painting Arnolfini Portrait shows a convex mirror in the centre of the painting. Van Eyck also left his signature above this mirror, the book mentions various (previous) studies stating a broad use of technology in the Renaissance and does not refer to the hypothesis and the hype around it at all showing the importance of the tool. The painting includes a crown glass window in the upper left side, a rather expensive luxury at the time. Van Eyck was rather fascinated by glass and its qualities, which was as well of high symbolic importance for his contemporaries. Early optical instruments were comparatively expensive in the Medieval age and the Renaissance.

He is chiefly known from the legends of Saint Dubricius, who was supposedly his grandson. The contemporary rendering of this name would seem to be Peibio, as in Garthbeibio, a parish in Montgomeryshire, or Ynys Beibio, near Holyhead. Life of Dubricius Peibo Clafrog appears in the Life of Dubricius included in the 12th-century Book of Llandaff or Liber Landavensis as well as in a number of works derived from it, and in charters associated with Dubricius.Gould, pp. 359‚Äì363 He is consistently described as Dubricius' maternal grandfather. In the Life, Peibio is King of Ergyng and has a daughter, Efrddyl. He is afflicted with a mouth ailment that causes him to drivel saliva constantly. This is supposed to be the cause of his epithet Clafrog, though this term literally means \\"scabby\\" or \\"leprous\\"; there has evidently been some confusion with the similar-sounding Glyfoer or Glafoer, meaning \\"drivel\\".Gould, p. 363. Returning from a skirmish one day, Peibo asks his daughter to help him wash his head. In the process he discovers that she is pregnant. Furious, he orders her to be tied in a sack and drowned in a river. When she washes ashore, he then orders her burnt alive. The next day, however, his servants discover that she has miraculously survived the ordeal and is contently nursing her newborn baby on top of the pyre. The regretful Peibio then orders Efrddyl and her child brought to him; the child's touch instantly cures his affliction. In thanks Peibio bestows his grandson with the place of his extraordinary birth, called Matle (Madley), and eventually a monument commemorating the event is erected.Gould, p. 363. \\"[John] Lewis, in his History of Great Britain describes the monument of this Prince as existing in his time. 'In Herefordshire in a parish (probably he means Madley) is the picture of a King, with a man on each side of him, with napkins wiping the rheum and drivel from his mouth; that humour so abounding in him that he could get no cure for it, which King, the country people call King Driveller, the Britons Pebiau Glavorawc, the Latins Pepianus Spumosus, Rex Ereychi.'\\" From the similarity of the names it is possible that Pepiau and Pabiali, the son of Brychan, were the same person, which would make Dubricius a great-grandson of Brychan ‚Äî a great distance between the respective eras. Dubricius' mother could not have been the daughter of Meyrig, the son of Tewdrig, as Meyrig died in 575 at the age of 90 while Dubricius was born in 475, was consecrated bishop in 505 and died in 560 at the age of 85. In the genealogies in the Jesus College MS 20 of the fifteenth century, Peibo is called Peibiawn Glawrawc, and is reckoned to be the son of Arbeth and the father of Tewdwr. Peibio was also the uncle of Saint Inabwy, disciple of Dubricius and Bishop of Ergyng. Possible alternative identities According to the tale of Culhwch and Olwen, there were two kings named Nynnio and Peibio who were metamorphosed into horned oxen on account of their sins. They appear as insane kings, who were brothers in the tale of Rhita Gawr.

Within Poland's new boundaries there remained a substantial number of ethnic Germans, who were expelled from Poland until 1951. The remaining former German citizens were primarily autochthons, who were allowed to stay in post-war Poland after declaring Polish nationality in a verification process.The Expulsion of 'German' Communities from Eastern Europe at the end of the Second World War , Steffen Prauser and Arfon Rees, European University Institute, Florense. HEC No. 2004/1. p.28 According to article 116 of the German constitution, all former German citizens (regardless of nationality) may be \\"re-granted German citizenship on application\\" and are \\"considered as not having been deprived of their German citizenship if they have established their domicile in Germany after May 8, 1945 and have not expressed a contrary intention.\\"Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany This regulation allowed the autochthons, and ethnic Germans permitted to stay in Poland, to reclaim German citizenship and settle in West Germany. In addition to those groups, a substantial number of Poles who never had German citizenship were emigrating to West Germany during the period of the People's Republic of Poland for political and economic reasons. Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland After 1945, ethnic deportation was used to create a homogenous nation within the new borders of the People's Republic of Poland (which contained a substantial amount of territory that was once part of Germany). Groups forced to move included ethnic Germans from the Recovered Territories to the post-war Allied Occupation Zones in Germany and ethnic Ukrainians from eastern Poland to the USSR or the Recovered Territories. The decision to move the Polish border westward was made by the Allies at the Tehran and Yalta Conferences and finalized in the Potsdam Agreement, which also provided for the expulsion of German citizens to Allied occupation zones.Ryszard W. Piotrowicz, Sam Blay, Gunnar Schuster, Andreas Zimmermann, The unification of Germany in international and domestic law, Rodopi, 1997, pp.46-49, Potsdam Agreement, full text at pbs.org Although the Potsdam Agreement left the final decision about the border shift to a future peace treaty, the Polish government (which had implemented pre-Potsdam expulsions from the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line area)Philipp Ther, Deutsche Und Polnische Vertriebene: Gesellschaft und Vertriebenenpolitik in SBZ/DDR und in Polen 1945-1956, 1998, p. 57, interpreted it as final decision which would be confirmed by the peace treaty.Ryszard W. Piotrowicz, Sam Blay, Gunnar Schuster, Andreas Zimmermann, The unification of Germany in international and domestic law, Rodopi, 1997, pp.48-50, In reality, the Potsdam Agreement took its place. The status of the expellees in post-war West Germany, which granted the right of return to the German diaspora, was legally defined in the Federal Expellee Law of 1953. Federal Expellee Law (Germany) at juris.de The deportation of Germans ended in 1950; from 1945‚Äì1950, nearly 3.2 million were removed. After that, authorities stated that there were (at most) a few thousand ethnic Germans living in Poland; these figures included ethnic Germans living among the Mazurians, Silesians and Kashubs. Prime minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki (in office 1989‚Äì91) was the first Polish prime minister to officially recognize the German minority. During the post-war period, the new territories were resettled by Poles. Around 155,000 men from the Kresy (the Polish territories east of the Curzon Line), who were drafted into the Polish army in 1944, were settled in the West after the war. About 2.9 million settlers came from central Poland, and as many as two million had been freed from forced labor in Nazi Germany. 1,126,000 were expelled from former Polish territories in the east; however, an estimated 525,000 Poles remained in those territories after the war. Family-reunification process After the Polish Bureau for Repatriation (PUR) declared the expulsion of Germans completed, and was dissolved in 1951,Grzegorz Janusz in Manfred Kittel, Deutschsprachige Minderheiten 1945: ein europ√§ischer Vergleich, Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, 2007, pp.143,144, official estimates placed the number of remaining Germans at about 130,000. Historian Witold Sienkiewicz analyzed estimates from historians, and concluded that nearly 300,000 Germans lived in Poland at that time. Most, after first wanting to remain in their homeland, later decided to leave Poland and settle in Germany. On 2 January 1950, the governments of Poland and East Germany negotiated a treaty allowing 76,000 Germans to migrate from Poland to East Germany between early 1950 and late 1951. Later emigrations from Poland to Germany, although formally possible, were impeded by Polish local and national authorities. Many former German citizens willing to settle in West Germany were not allowed to leave Poland until the Polish October of 1956. This event, which marked the decline of Stalinism in Poland, allowed many to leave the country in a family-reunification process. From 1956 to 1959, between 231,000 and 260,000 people left Poland and settled in Germany (about 80 percent in West Germany). About 250,000 people were allowed to immigrate to Poland from the Soviet Union during repatriations from 1955 to 1959. The German minority in Poland, and others who emigrated to Germany, were non-Poles. During the post-war expulsions it was possible for former German citizens who had held Polish citizenship to be \\"rehabilitated\\",K. Cordell in Stefan Wolff, German Minorities in Europe: Ethnic Identity and Cultural Belonging, Berghahn Books, 2000, pp.79,80, and for former German citizens of Polish, Kashubian, Masurian or Silesian descent to be verified as autochtones,Philipp Ther, Deutsche und polnische Vertriebene: Gesellschaft und Vertriebenenpolitik in SBZ/DDR und in Polen 1945-1956, Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1998, p.306, obtaining Polish citizenship and avoiding expulsion. Some German speakers of Silesian and Masurian were also classified as autochthons by the Polish authorities. Although 1,104,134 people were verified, the number of people who were rehabilitated is unknown. An estimated 160,000 to 200,000 Germans were also allowed to stay in Poland when the expulsion decree of 1946 was partially renounced in 1950. Google Books Most emigrants were autochthones, who decided to start a new life in Germany due to cross-border family ties and for economic and political reasons. √âmigr√©s lost their Polish citizenship, and were granted German citizenship on crossing the border (if the person had not been a German citizen). During the early 1960s immigration to Germany was again impeded by the authorities, leading to a drop in √©migr√©s throughout the 1960s and 1970s. An estimated 22,000 people per year immigrated between 1960 and 1970, 12 to 28 percent of whom came from the recovered territories inhabited by autochthons. During the early 1970s about 67,000 people were leaving Poland annually, 10 to 26 percent from the territories. Google Books During the late 1970s, West German chancellor Willy Brandt's policy of Ostpolitik led to a rapprochement with Poland and relations were normalized in the Treaty of Warsaw. This led to further agreements between Brandt and Polish leader Edward Gierek, which concluded in Helsinki during the third phase of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. According to the agreements, 120,000 to 125,000 people could leave Poland in the family-reunification process in exchange for economic aid from West Germany to Poland. More than 230,000 people left Poland, among whom were nearly all remaining autochthons dissatisfied with political and economic conditions in Poland. Many, especially if they were born after 1945, were unable to speak German; at home they spoke their regional dialect, and at school they were taught Polish and Russian. Those emigrants were usually manual laborers, farmers and craftsmen, most without higher education. After arriving in Germany, they usually cultivated their regional traditions and language. Some of them retained Polish citizenship and played an active role in the Polish organisations in Germany. In the long run, however, most assimilated into German society. The 1980s, the last decade of the Polish People's Republic, saw nearly 740,000 people leave Poland due to the implementation of martial law and a stagnant economy affected by the economic sanctions imposed by the US under Ronald Reagan. These emigrants were primarily ethnic Poles, most of whom did not know German and had to learn it in language courses organised by German authorities. Most maintained close contact with relatives and friends in Poland; some retained Polish citizenship, and most are active in Polish organizations in Germany. Other emigrants In addition to former German citizens, their descendants and family members (usually from the marriage of an autochthon and non-autochthon) and other Polish citizens also emigrated to Germany after World War II in numbers difficult to estimate. During the 1980s, about 300,000 Poles left Poland (usually illegally) and settled in Western Germany. Although many were political emigrants, others emigrated for economic reasons. This \\"Solidarity emigration\\" involved a large number of people with secondary and higher education. They are characterised by deep national pride, and actively participate in Polish cultural and political life in Germany; however, few returned to Poland after the fall of communism in 1989. Recapitulation After World War II over 2.5 million Polish citizens emigrated to West Germany, most exchanging Polish citizenship for German. However, more than 300,000 people have dual Polish and German citizenship. Although nearly all who emigrated from Poland in their teens or older are still Polish speakers, their children usually speak German only. The number of former Polish citizens and those with dual citizenship living in Germany are estimated at two million.

The company offers research, analysis, and news on startup companies, emerging technologies, and other technology related topics. It was started by Om Malik in San Francisco, California and was acquired by Knowingly Corp. in 2015. History After running his personal blog under the name for several years, Gigaom was founded as a company by Om Malik in 2006. In June 2006, he left his day job at Business 2.0 magazine to work on Gigaom full-time. The site originally integrated several other technology-related blogs and services into its network. In 2011, Gigaom consolidated this network of blogs and rebranded all of them as separate topic channels on gigaom.com, with channels dedicated to technology news, Apple, cleantech, cloud computing, data, Europe, mobile technology, and digital video. Since 2006, Gigaom has organized technology conferences under the banner Gigaom Events. Former Gigaom employees founded Structure, an independent conference business in order to host some of the events. For its first conference, Structure gave free tickets to those who lost money on tickets to Gigaom's canceled conference in March and sponsors who had sponsored the canceled event got 90 percent of the money they lost to sponsor Structure's first conference. In 2008, Malik appointed Paul Walborsky as CEO of the company and in 2009, the company launched GigaOM Pro, a subscription-based technology research service. Walborsky stepped down as CEO in September 2014.Gabriel Kahn, \\"How Gigaom Built a Media Business Around Free Content,\\" PBS, October 14, 2014.

She was bought by the Atlantic Transport Line in 1897 because she was \\"practically a sister\\" to other Massachusetts class of ships already in service there. She was renamed SS Minnewaska by her new owners. Service history Minnewaska was one of six Atlantic Transport Line ships requisitioned by the U.S. Government for service as transports during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, and purchased on 26 July 1898 for $660,000 and renamed Thomas after General George Henry Thomas, a hero of the American Civil War battle of Chickamauga. Thomas could accommodate 100 officers, 1,200 men and 1,000 horses, and also had refrigerated capacity for shipping of meat, particularly prized because beef was considered an essential element of the military diet. A brief article in the Maryville Times of 28 October 1899 describes the ship and her facilities: During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, vessels going to and from the Philippines made a point of stopping and raising the American flag on Wake Island before it was formally annexed by the United States in 1899. One of these, in July 1898, was the Thomas. The Peace Corps tradition was arguably started by the Thomasites, a group of educators who got their name from the Thomas. This ship brought the first batch of 540 American teachers and some of their family members to initiate a new era of public education in the Philippines in August 1901. In early 1916, the Thomas broke its propeller on a voyage from San Francisco to Manila and put into Honolulu for repairs. The floating dry dock that was available had a capacity of only 4,500 tons, while the Thomas was an 11,000 ton vessel, and 118 feet longer than the dry dock. Engineers allowed the bow to extend beyond the front of the dry dock granting them access to stern which was lifted out of the water, allowing them to replace the damaged propeller. Though in Pacific service with large troop capacity the ship did not see service in the war zone during World War I due to slow speed and lack of bunker capacity to make a round trip of the Atlantic, where coal in Europe was critically short, without the intermediate bunkering at coaling stations available in the Pacific. According to U.S. Army service records of Private Leroy F Johnson who sailed on this voyage and served in Company E of the 27th Infantry Regiment, the Thomas sailed from San Francisco on 16 October 1919, and arrived in Vladivostok, Siberia, on 11 November 1919, with U.S. Army troops and supplies to support the American troops already in Siberia. The regiment departed Vladivostok 10 March 1920 aboard Thomas arriving at Manila on 17 March 1920. Between 10 June and 22 September 1920 Thomas was one of ten Army transports evacuating members of the Czechoslovak Legion from Vladivostok and transporting them to Trieste, Italy. In October 1922 the Thomas took aboard passengers and crew of the Los Angeles Steamship Company liner SS City of Honolulu, which had caught fire about 670 miles northeast of the Hawaiian Islands, and landed them at San Pedro, California. From 5‚Äì30 September 1923 Thomas was one of three Army transports involved in earthquake relief operations, Yokohama, Japan. Thomas made several trips to the Orient from New York via the Panama Canal, but was used mainly on the Manila run, stopping at Honolulu and Guam on the westward trip, and Nagasaki, Japan, and Chinwangtao, China, on the return voyage. She was the last of the more than 50 transports acquired by the U.S. Government in 1898 to remain in service. In March 1928 Thomas made her final voyage for the Army Transport Service and was turned over to the United States Shipping Board for disposal and sold to the American Iron and Metal Company 14 May 1929 for scrapping at Oakland, California.

The author of several important scientific publications, he also headed the Chilean Army's medical services during the War of the Pacific. Allende was of Basque descent.http://salvadorallende.blog.lemonde.fr/2009/06/27/el-personaje-de-hoy/ Biography The son of Jos√© Gregorio Allende Garc√©s and Salom√© Pad√≠n Ruiz, Allende was born in Valpara√≠so. He studied at the Liceo de Valpara√≠so and the Instituto Nacional before graduating, on 20 June 1865, from the Universidad de Chile as a physician specializing in obstetrics and surgery. He was an assistant professor of the School of Medicine, becoming a full professor in November 1865. In 1870 he became the Chief Doctor of Valpara√≠so's emergency public hospital, the Hospital de Sanidad. He also worked with Professor Wenceslao D√≠az and at the San Borja and San Vicente de Paul hospitals. In 1875 President Federico Err√°zuriz Za√±artu appointed him to the Public Welfare Committee, charged with a reforming brief. Allende joined the Radical Party and was in 1876 elected as deputy for Santiago. He was reelected in 1879, this time for Copiap√≥ and Caldera. He also served from 8 December 1879 to 1 November 1880 as chairman of the Council on Public Hygiene. On 28 September 1880, during the War of the Pacific (1879-1884), Dr Allende was appointed Superintendent of the Army Medical Services. During this time he attended the troops as chief medical officer in charge of the Ambulance Service (an \\"ambulance\\" at the time was a mobile hospital of about 20 beds, equipped for the performance of emergency field surgery). As such he is considered to be the founder of the Chilean Army Medical Corps. Allende headed the \\"Justice and Liberty\\" Masonic Lodge and was a notorious enemy of the Catholic Church, which excommunicated him. He was also editor of the newspapers Gu√≠a para el Pueblo (\\"The People's guide\\") and El Deber ('\\"Duty'\\"). He was nominated as a member of the Public Instruction Committee and in this role he founded several schools, among them the Blas Cuevas School in Valpara√≠so, the first masonically controlled school. He was also a director of the Corps of Firemen. Allende was elected to the Senate in 1882, and in 1884 he became Masonic Grand Master, but died a few months later, aged 39, from complications of diabetes. Allende's funeral - at which the public eulogy was delivered by the radical leader Enrique Mac-Iver and two future presidents of Chile, Jos√© Manuel Balmaceda and Ram√≥n Barros Luco, carried the coffin - turned into a gigantic political meeting. Personal life On 24 April 1869 Allende married Eugenia Castro del Fierro, with whom he had three sons: Ram√≥n, Tom√°s and Salvador. From his third and youngest son he was the grandfather of President Salvador Allende.

He is currently a Visiting Professor in the School of Politics and International Studies at the University of Leeds, where he was a faculty member from 1993 to 2020. Between 2015 and 2019 he held a shared appointment at Columbia University, where he was a Visiting Professor of Political Science and taught every spring semester. McCargo is also a visiting scholar at the Weatherhead East Asian Institute, Columbia University, and an associate fellow of the New-York-based Asia Society. He holds three degrees from the University of London: a First in English (Royal Holloway 1986); then an MA in Area Studies (Southeast Asia) (1990) and a PhD in Politics (1993) from the School of Oriental and African Studies. He has also taught at Queen's University, Belfast, and at Kobe Gakuin University, Japan. In 2006‚Äì07, he was a visiting senior research fellow at the Asia Research Institute, National University of Singapore. During the 2015‚Äì16 academic year, he was a Visitor at the School of Social Science, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton. McCargo is best known for his writing on contemporary Thailand and Asia-related topics. His work deals mainly with the nature of power: how entrenched elites seek to retain it, and how challengers seek to undermine their legitimacy. Writings on Thailand McCargo's PhD thesis, The political leadership of Major-General Chamlong Srimuang was published in a revised form as a 1997 book. Since then McCargo has published several other books on Thailand. These include: Politics and the Press in Thailand (2000), a fieldwork-based study for which he spent a year embedded in the editorial rooms of several leading Thai language newspapers; Reforming Thai Politics (2002) an edited volume which has become the standard work on the political reform process of the 1990s, containing chapters by a range of leading Thai and foreign scholars and activists; and The Thaksinization of Thailand, a widely cited analysis of the politics surrounding controversial former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, co-authored with the revisionist political economist Ukrist Pathamanand. Apart from his eleven books, McCargo has published a number of articles in journals including Critical Asian Studies, Journal of Asian Studies, Journal of Democracy and New Left Review. His writings regarding the \\"network monarchy\\", a term he coined to describe King Bhumibol Adulyadej and his proxies, particularly former Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanond, have been influential among Thai academics. His was the only journal article selected by Foreign Affairs for their seven-item list of essential reading on Thai politics. Other McCargo articles deal critically with issues such as constitutionalism, the politics surrounding Buddhism, and the role of the military. He was critical of the 2006 and 2014 military coups in Thailand. McCargo's work forms by now a basis of Thai studies, as evidenced by his many publications, awards and appointments mentioned here. At the same time, all of McCargo's work on Thailand and Southeast Asia forms part of his larger intellectual project on the nature of power and justice, which has a broad comparative reach. Work on the southern Thai conflict From 2005 to 2010, McCargo worked primarily on the violent conflict affecting Thailand's southern border provinces, spending a year driving around the region and interviewing more than 270 informants. His southern Thai project produced three books: the edited collection Rethinking Thailand‚Äôs Southern Violence (2007), which is based on a 2006 special issue of the journal Critical Asian Studies; the research monograph Tearing Apart the Land: Islam and Legitimacy in Southern Thailand (2008); and a second monograph, Mapping National Anxieties: Thailand's Southern Conflict in 2012. In the same year, a Thai translation of Tearing Apart the Land was published by Kobfai. Tearing Apart the Land has been widely reviewed; Time magazine wrote, \\"No armchairs for this author: he researched the book by crisscrossing southern Thailand in a temperamental 1989 Mercedes, hastening back to the town of Pattani by nightfall to avoid militant booby traps. McCargo is the real McCoy.\\" Pacific Affairs wrote of Tearing Apart the Land: \\"The nuances and complexities of this argument can be obtained only by a thorough reading of the book. It is by far the best analysis to date of the complexities of life in the insurgent area.\\" (Volume 82, No. 4 ‚Äì Winter 2009/2010, pp. 740‚Äì41). In a full-length review essay in London Review of Books, Joshua Kurlantzick declared, \\"Thailand, once known as one of the most stable democracies in Asia, is in political and economic crisis....Southern Thailand now resembles a war zone....McCargo gives a thorough explanation of why unrest began in southern Thailand, and why it has spread...\\" (25 March 2010). Reviewing the book in the Journal of Asian Studies (May 1010) Robert W. Hefner wrote, \\"McCargo has sifted through the details of this tragic conflict with extraordinary diligence and insight. The result is a small masterpiece of investigative rigor and balance.\\". McCargo's core argument is that the southern conflict is a political problem. Militants tap into local resentment concerning Bangkok's refusal to grant the region any real say in the management of its affairs. Without some form of political compromise, the conflict may prove intractable, but a solution remains perfectly possible. Tearing Apart the Land won the Asia Society's inaugural Bernard Schwartz Book Prize for 2009, worth US$20,000. Jury co-chair Professor Carol Gluck described it as a \\"vivid on-the-ground account of the Thai insurgency showing how national politics, rather than minority religion, drives the violence that is too often ascribed either to ethnicity or Islam. This is a lesson that applies not only to Southeast Asia but to many parts of the world.\\" Other writings Not all of McCargo's work has been on Thailand. He has also conducted research in Cambodia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and Japan. His 2003 book Media and Politics in Pacific Asia, a companion volume to his Thai press book, develops a comparative argument, arguing against simply \\"modelling\\" the political role of the media, in favour of an eclectic approach emphasising the different forms of agency deployed by media actors, which he terms \\"partisan polyvalence\\". His media work has won him an audience in the field of communications studies, whose standard assumptions he regularly challenges. In 2012 he published a chapter in Comparing Media Systems: Beyond the Western World, a book edited by Dan Hallin and Paolo Mancini. The chapter contains his critical responses to their earlier comparative work on developing models for the relationship between media and politics. He has also edited a book on Vietnam (2004). His book Contemporary Japan (third edition 2013) is widely assigned even by Japanologists as an introductory student text, and has been translated into Malaysian, Chinese and Korean. Religion has been a central theme of McCargo's work, dating back to his doctoral research on Chamlong's links with the Santi Asoke Buddhist movement. His writings on Thai Buddhism, which he claims is an obstacle to, rather than an asset for processes of democratization in the country, have generated controversy, and have been extensively challenged in two books by the leading scholar-monk Prayudh Payutto. His work on the southern Thai conflict dealt extensively with the role of Islam in Thailand's Malay-majority region. Writings on justice and politics Between 2011 and 2014, McCargo held a Leverhulme Trust major research fellowship to examine issues relating to justice and politics in Thailand, from which he has published a number of articles. McCargo spent 2012 conducting fieldwork in Thailand, including participant-observation in courts and police stations; his primary focus was on a number of politically-related court cases brought since 2006. This project was written up in Fighting for Virtue: Justice and Politics in Thailand (Cornell 2019). Fighting for Virtue was launched simultaneously on 23 April 2020 in Copenhagen and New York. McCargo has also written critical examinations of transitional justice initiatives, both in Southeast Asia and more broadly. His theoretical approach draws on critiques of legalism and constitutionalism as applied - or mis-applied - to the solution of deep-rooted political problems or conflicts. Urbanized villagers In 2011, McCargo published an influential article with his former PhD student Naruemon Thabchumpon in which they coined the term \\"urbanized villagers\\", to describe the socio-economic basis of the pro-Thaksin redshirt movement. They argue that the bedrock of the redshirts comprises \\"poor farmers\\" who are really neither poor nor farmers: though legally resident in provinces of the North and Northeast, they derive most their income from selling their labor and running small businesses, often in the greater Bangkok area. Former prime minister Thaksin succeeded in capturing the loyalty of this group by persuading them that he was working on behalf of their economic and political interests. The phenomenon found in Thailand, whereby a traditional elite allied with a metropolitan middle class finds itself threatened and outnumbered by the rise of urbanized villagers, can be seen in many other countries. In another co- authored article, McCargo has compared the social structure of Thailand with that of Turkey. Other activities As a leading expert on contemporary Thailand, McCargo regularly appears as a media commentator, pundit, and writer of op-ed pieces. He appears regularly in the broadcast media, especially on BBC radio and television, and his op-ed and commentary pieces have appeared in Time magazine, as well as in the Guardian Weekly, The Telegraph, The Economist,‚ÄòEnemies of the people‚Äô, The Economist, 30 July 2010 http://www.economist.com/node/16703377?story_id=16703377 The Guardian, and The Independent, The Financial Times, The New York Times, and a dozen other newspapers around the world. He has given lengthy interviews to The Chronicle of Higher Education and the New Mandala website. His photographs have appeared in Asia Times, The New York Times and Nikkei Asian Review, as well as in various academic publications.

Situated near the Wilton chemical complex, the station had combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) and open cycle gas turbines (OCGTs), however in 2011 the operation of the CCGT part of the station was suspended, and in 2013 the owners announced its closure and plans to demolish it. Prior to the suspension, the station had a generating capacity of 1875 megawatts (MW), making it the largest of any CCGT power station in Europe. The station could meet almost 3% of the electricity demand for England, Wales and Scotland. Opened in 1993, the station was initially operated by Enron but moved into the hands of PX Ltd after the Enron scandal of 2001, before being bought by Gaz de France and Suez in 2008. The station also worked as a cogeneration plant, providing steam for the Wilton complex. History The power station was constructed on a site at the Wilton chemical complex near Middlesbrough in north east England. Construction of the station began in December 1990 and took twenty nine months to complete. The main contracted construction work was undertaken by Westinghouse and Wimpey, employing a largely local workforce of 3,000. The station was commissioned in April 1993. The station was originally owned and operated by US energy company Enron. A visitor centre at the power station was opened by MP Mo Mowlam on 6 November 1998. During maintenance closure in August 2001, an explosion in one of the power station's transformers killed three workers and injured another man. After Enron's bankruptcy in 2002, the power station was sold to a management buyout. It was owned by Teesside Power Limited (TPL) and operated on behalf of its owners by PX Limited. In October 2007 it was put up for sale by its private equity owners Cargill and Goldman Sachs, valued between ¬£200 million and ¬£300 million. On 25 February 2008 the station was acquired jointly by Gaz de France and Suez. Plans for a ¬£500 million upgrade of the station were granted planning permission in 2008. This upgrade would consist of replacing the existing generating equipment with four 300 MW gas turbines and two 340 MW steam turbines. This would retain the power station's current capacity. However, with no work having begun by 2010, a five-year extension to the permission was granted in April 2010. Following a merger between GDF and International Power in 2010, the ownership of the site was shifted to the latter company. On 1 April 2011, GDF surrendered 1,830 MW of transmission entry capacity (TEC) of the station and ceased operations of the CCGT element of the plant leaving the Open Cycle gas turbine as the only available machine, leaving the station with an operating capacity of 45 MW. This was due to the low cost of energy imports and a weak market in the UK, resulting in a need to save on operating costs. It is unknown how long the power station will be out of operation for and around 100 workers may lose their jobs due to the mothballing. International Power's lack of clarity over the workers' jobs has been condemned by unions, with Unite the Union North East regional officer Bob Bolam stating \\"The company might say they will keep the plant on standby but workers can‚Äôt hang around waiting for an upturn\\". It is yet to be decided whether the mothballing will effectively shelve the planned upgrade of the power station. MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland Tom Blenkinsop also criticised the move, calling on Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Chris Huhne to \\"see to it that the [owners] ... are not allowed to pull the plug on this plant at this time.\\" in relation to forthcoming end of the lives of UK coal and nuclear plants. The owners, GDF Suez, announced in 2013, their intention to permanently close and demolish the plant.http://www.powerengineeringint.com/articles/2013/10/gdf-suez-announces- demolition-of-1875-mw-plant.html This was completed by early 2015. In 2018, the local authority was told it had pay ¬£2.6m to GDF Suez to due to a backdated re-evaluation of business rates for the site. Specifications With a total generating capacity of 1,875 MW, the station had the largest generating capacity of any CCGT power station in Europe, although it had been the largest in the world at the time of opening. It was able to generate enough electricity to provide 3% of England, Wales and Scotland's combined power needs. The electricity was produced by a number of generators. These were: eight 152 MW Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Westinghouse 701DA gas turbines, each fitted with a Nooter Eriksen heat recovery steam generator, with supplementary firing; two 305 MW Mitsubishi Westinghouse steam turbines; and a single 43 MW LM6000 General Electric black start gas turbine. These generators were fuelled by natural gas, propane and naphtha. As of 1 April 2011, the station was only generating 45 MW after a partial mothballing of the station. The gas fuel used in the power station was provided from a nearby gas processing plant. It was also connected to UK national gas transmission grid. Water used in the station's steam cycle was cooled by three cooling towers. Electricity generated at the station was distributed to the National Grid via 275-kilovolt (kV) substations built by ABB. As well as generating electricity, the station also produced heat in the form of of process steam per hour for the adjacent Wilton chemical complex, and of gas liquids per day, in the form of propane, butane and hydrocarbons.

This contrasts with conventional passenger trains, whose main purpose is to transport passengers to some destination as quickly as possible but which also might serve dinner on long- distance routes. The Old Road dinner train, Blissfield, Michigan Dinner trains have become popular in recent years, particularly in the United States. This is in part a result of a nostalgia for passenger trains (which are less common in the U.S. than in many other countries) and in part because it provides a very different experience from driving and from eating at ordinary restaurants. The first dinner train in the United States was the \\"Supper Chief\\" that ran on the Sierra Railroad in California in the 1970s. Dinner train service was renewed in 1999 with the Sierra Railroad Dinner Train. There are over 80 dinner trains currently operating in North America. Most such trains operate either seasonally or a few days a week, but some operate daily (or even twice daily on weekends in a few cases). Almost all dinner trains run on lightly used branch lines or tourist lines, and virtually all use older passenger cars. Almost all dinner train trips are characterized by 2‚Äì4 hour trips that return to where they started since the emphasis is the experience and not traveling to a destination. Some feature the use of steam locomotives for at least some of their runs. Speeds are usually between , much slower than ordinary passenger trains, not only due to lower track standards but also to the fact that the emphasis is on the journey itself, not the destination. Dinner trains can be fun not only for the passengers who ride them but also for the train crews and other employees. They can also provide jobs and be a profitable business. Moreover, they can generate substantial benefits for local economies, including boosting tourism and increasing sales at nearby businesses. For example, the Spirit of Washington, which operated daily on the Woodinville Subdivision near Seattle, provided 80 full-time jobs and contributed roughly $10 million annually to the local economy before ceasing operations in late October 2007. There was also the Michigan Star Clipper Dinner Train which was a dinner train that operated for 24 years out of Walled Lake, Michigan, with trips heading from West Bloomfield to Wixom. In addition to just providing dinner while riding on a scenic route, some dinner trains have developed additional functions, such as hosting wedding receptions, reunions, company retreats, murder mystery events during the dinner. Some so- called dinner trains do not actually serve meals aboard the train. Rather, the food is served in a building or outdoors after the train has reached its destination; the passengers then reboard for the return trip. This is particularly true for narrow gauge railways, on which it would be impractical to prepare and serve formal meals. Examples include the gauge Puffing Billy Railway near Melbourne, Australia and the gauge Lahaina Kaanapali Railroad in Maui, Hawaii.

It is adjacent to the Little Maria Mountains and located about northwest of Blythe. It is accessible from Blythe in the south via Lovekin Boulevard and Midland Road, and from Rice in the north via Midland Road. From 1925 to the 1960s, Midland was a company town owned by the U.S. Gypsum Co. The company had mined vast amounts of gypsum found in the area. Midland was also the site of a large plant that produced wallboard and plasterboard. For some time, there was a three part railroad between the quarry and the crusher, the last part being a narrow gauge line running few miles. The town's water was shipped from Blythe by rail. At its peak, the town had a population of approximately 1,000. As the character of the gypsum found in the area was considered too heavy as the years went on, company activity in Midland subsided and then ended in 1966. Many winter scenes in Hollywood films during the 20th century utilized faux snow that originated from Midland. In the 1960s (before the town's demise), a gypsum mine west of the plant and abandoned in 1948 was converted into the largest fallout shelter in the county. Most of the buildings of Midland were torn down, and today only foundations remain. In 1970, a 150,000 gallon water tank from Midland was moved on skids by tractor to the new Mesa Ranch Mobile Home Park and a housing site in northwest Blythe.Front page picture in the Palo Verde Valley Times, December 10, 1970.

He was a founding member and president of the Seafarers International Union (SIU) from 1957 to 1980. He was the senior vice president of the AFL-CIO at the time of his death.  Early career  He started shipping as a teenager in the early 1930s, mostly as a wiper and Fireman/Watertender and Oiler (FOWT). He also earned a 2nd Engineer license, but never sailed under it. 1938 saw the founding of SIU and Paul Hall was a charter member. He made his presence felt immediately. He was a tough, hard- nosed union activist and his early waterfront battles left him with ugly knife scars on his arms and legs. His first official post in the union was as patrolman in the port of Baltimore in 1944. He rapidly moved up to become port agent in New York and then Director of Organizing for the SIU Atlantic and Gulf District. Then in 1947, he became chief executive officer of SIU-Atlantic Gulf Lakes and Inland Water District, at the age of 32. He held this post until his death. Paul Hall led the SIU in the General strike of 1947 when seamen won unprecedented gains in wages and conditions. He also organized key breakthroughs for the union in bringing Isthmian Lines (with 125 ships) and Cities Service Tankers (a strongly anti-union company) under the SIU banner. Through collective bargaining, he also established the Seafarers Welfare, Pension and Vacation Plans. By 1954, the SIU had aided with, as Paul used to say, \\"money, marbles and chalk\\" a total of 75 brother unions in strikes and organizing campaigns. These constant battles to help other unions earned Paul Hall the lifelong reputation of one who got things done and who could always be counted on for help no matter what the problem.  President of SIU  In 1957, Paul Hall became president of SIU-North America, succeeding the late Harry Lundeberg, a post he held until his death. In the same year, he became president of the AFL-CIO Maritime Trades Department. When Hall took over the Maritime Trades Department, it was a struggling organization made up of only six small unions. He built it into the most active and effective political force in the family of the trade union movement. At his death, it comprised 43 national and international unions representing nearly 8 million American workers. In 1962, he was elected to the AFL-CIO Executive Council. He was senior vice president of the AFL-CIO and one of its most influential members at the time of his death. He fought continually at the bargaining table. In the words of SIU Vice President Red Campbell, \\"Paul Hall would go into a room of shipowners. They'd throw apples and oranges on the table and he'd come out with the fruit salad.\\" He established the Seafarers Harry Lundeberg School of Seamanship in Piney Point, Maryland in 1967 in order to give young people the chance for a career at sea. Since then, the school has developed into among the finest maritime training schools in the country. Thousands of SIU members have advanced their skills, and thousands of young people from deprived backgrounds have found employment through the school.Labor Hall of Fame Honoree (2003) After an 8-month battle with cancer, he died in 1980.

The party first qualified for statewide ballot access in 1980, and then again on September 1, 1982 with 41,000 petition signatures. The party ran 122 candidates that November. Legal issues making signature collection more difficult prevented the party from achieving ballot access in 1984, but it was able to collect the required 32,000 signatures in 1986 to once again make it on the ballot. Three statewide candidates achieved at least 5% of the vote that November, automatically granting the party ballot access for 1988.Under Texas law since the 1980s, any political party having at least one statewide candidate that garners at least 5% of the vote, is guaranteed ballot access at the next statewide election. In the 1990 statewide elections, gubernatorial candidate Jeff Daiell (author of the novel, From Roundheel To Revolutionary, available on Amazon) achieved 3.34% of the vote (129,128) and Comptroller candidate Gill Grisham received 5.8%, guaranteeing ballot access through 1994. Mr. Daiell's showing is still the LP of Texas record in a gubernatorial race in terms of per centage; in 2018 Mark Tippetts broke the record for most votes. On March 9, 1998, U.S. District Judge James Nowlin stopped the State of Texas from requiring voter registration numbers alongside ballot access petition signatures in Pilcher v. Rains, brought by the Libertarian Party of Texas. In every election since except that of 2002, at least one of the party's candidates achieved 5% of the vote, guaranteeing ballot access. In May 2004 the party easily met the state's signature requirement. In the November 2006 elections, the party ran 168 candidates, and easily secured ballot access for 2008 in two-way races for state judicial positions, with the highest vote total going to Jerry Adkins for Supreme Court Place 4: 830,331 votes, or 24.5%.Libertarian Party of Texas - Texas Libertarians make major gains, break records In the May 2019 local Texas elections, Tony Valdivia achieved 29.5% in the race for the San Antonio District 8 council seat. This result marked the first time that a Libertarian Party member exceeded 10% in a major Texas city council election. Unlike Republicans and Democrats, the Libertarian Party of Texas holds county, district, and state conventions to nominate their candidates for public office. The party also accepts no tax dollars for their conventions.http://www.lptexas.org/rules - LPTexas Party Rules Officeholders * Ed Tidwell -- Mayor of Lago Vista * Larry Bush -- Jarrell City Council Elections=2008 campaigns The party fielded 173 candidates for federal, state, county, and local positions for the 2008 elections.

Only two prototypes were constructed. Development The prototype Braemar was developed in response to the establishment of the Independent Air Force in October 1917, as a bomber capable of the long-range bombing of Berlin if necessary. A large triplane, it had internal stowage for up to six 250 lb (110 kg) bombs. The initial design featured a unique engine installation with a central engine room housing all four engines. The engines were to be geared in pairs and power taken from the engines to the four propellers by power shafts. This design was abandoned early in development, and both the completed Braemars had a conventional engine installation, with the engines in inline tandem pairs, driving pusher and tractor propellers. However, the engine-room design was resurrected later in the Braemar's development life, for the proposed steam-powered Tramp. A contract from the Air Board for three prototypes was awarded to Bristol & Colonial on 26 February 1918. The first prototype Braemar flew on 13 August 1918, with four Siddeley Puma engines. The prototype showed generally good performance with a top speed of , but there were complaints from the test pilots about the view from the cockpit and the controls,The pilots were no longer able to feel sideslip through the wind on their faces (Flight 12 February 1960 p208) and so the next aircraft produced was an improved version designated Braemar Mk.II. The Mk.II received considerably more power from its four Liberty L-12 engines, which gave it an improved speed of .

He subsequently declared Emperor Yang's nephew Yang Hao emperor and led Emperor Yang's elite Xiaoguo Army (È©çÊûú) north, but was then repeatedly defeated by Li Mi, Li Shentong (ÊùéÁ•ûÈÄö), and finally Dou Jiande. Believing that his defeat was near and wanting to be emperor before his ultimate defeat, he poisoned Yang Hao and declared himself the emperor of a Xu state. Dou captured him in 619 and killed him.  Background  It is not known when Yuwen Huaji was born. He was the oldest son of the Sui Dynasty official Yuwen Shu, a close associate of Yang Guang the Prince of Jin, the son of Sui's founder Emperor Wen, and played a large role in helping Yang Guang displacing his older brother Yang Yong as Emperor Wen's crown prince in 600. Thereafter, Yuwen Huaji served as a guard commander for Yang Guang's palace. It was said that he often rode strong horses at a high speed through the streets of the capital Chang'an, holding a sling and shooting stones from the sling, and several times, he was removed from his post for receiving bribes, but each time Yang Guang persuaded Emperor Wen to restore him, and Yang Guang gave a daughter (the Princess Nanyang) to Yuwen Huaji's brother Yuwen Shiji in marriage. In 604, Emperor Wen died‚Äîa death that traditional historians generally believed to be a murder ordered by Yang Guang, although they admitted a lack of direct evidence‚Äîand Yang Guang took the throne as Emperor Yang. He made Yuwen Huaji the deputy minister of husbandry. In 607, Emperor Yang visited Yulin Commandery (Ê¶ÜÊûó, roughly modern Yulin, Shaanxi), and Yuwen Huaji and another brother, Yuwen Zhiji (ÂÆáÊñáÊô∫Âèä) engaged in forbidden trade with Tujue. Emperor Yang was incensed and ordered that they be executed, but at the last minute spared them, formally awarding them to their father Yuwen Shu as slaves. In 616, with the northern empire engulfed in agrarian rebellions, Emperor Yang, at Yuwen Shu's suggestion, went to Jiangdu (Ê±üÈÉΩ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu). Yuwen Shu and his sons followed Emperor Yang there, and in winter 616, Yuwen Shu died. Emperor Yang, remembering Yuwen Shu's contributions to him, made Yuwen Huaji a general and returned his brother Yuwen Zhiji to office as well. He also allowed Yuwen Huaji to inherit Yuwen Shu's title of Duke of Xu.  Coup against Emperor Yang  Emperor Yang, believing that he was well-protected by the elite Xiaoguo Army and not wanting to return to the turbulent north, considered moving the capital to Danyang (‰∏πÈôΩ, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu). Meanwhile, Xiaoguo soldiers were largely from Guanzhong (i.e., the region around the capital Chang'an), and they missed their home. Once they saw that Emperor Yang was not intending to return, they considered fleeing. Several Xiaoguo officers‚Äîthe chief among whom were Sima Dekan (Âè∏È¶¨Âæ∑Êà°), Pei Qiantong (Ë£¥ËôîÈÄö), and Yuan Li (ÂÖÉÁ¶Æ)‚Äîplanned an organized plot to flee. When two of the officers involved in the plot, Yuwen Zhiji's friend Zhao Xinshu (Ë∂ôË°åÊ®û) and Yuwen Zhiji's nephew Yang Shilan (Ê•äÂ£´Ë¶Ω), discussed the plan with Yuwen Zhiji, Yuwen Zhiji opined that if the Xiaoguo soldiers fled, they would surely be chased down and executed; rather, he suggested that they carry out a coup instead. At the suggestion of Zhao and Xue Shiliang (Ëñõ‰∏ñËâØ), they decided to invite Yuwen Huaji to be their leader. Yuwen Huaji, who was described as cowardly, initially panicked when offered the leadership, but eventually accepted. In late spring 618, the Xiaoguo officers carried out their plot, and as they were trusted officers, they were able to quickly gain access to the palace. They quickly entered the palace, initially declaring that they were only intending to ask Emperor Yang to return to Chang'an, but soon showed that they intended more by starting to denounce Emperor Yang for his crimes, as well as killing his youngest son Yang Gao, the Prince of Zhao. Emperor Yang offered to commit suicide by poison, but poison could not be found quickly, and so one of the officers, Linghu Xingda (‰ª§ÁãêË°åÈÅî), strangled him with his scarf as he requested. Yuwen Huaji briefly considered declaring Emperor Yang's brother, the former Prince of Shu Yang Xiu, emperor, but the other coup leaders opposed the idea, and so Yang Xiu and his sons were put to death, as were Emperor Yang's son Yang Jian the Prince of Qi, Emperor Yang's grandson Yang Tan (Ê•äÂÄì) the Prince of Yan, and other members of the imperial Yang clan. A number of high level officials, including the prime minister Yu Shiji, Pei Yun (Ë£¥Ëòä), Lai Hu'er (‰æÜË≠∑ÂÖí), Yuan Chong (Ë¢ÅÂÖÖ), Yuwen Xie (ÂÆáÊñáÂçî), Yuwen Jiong (ÂÆáÊñáÁöõ), and Xiao Ju (Ëï≠Áü©) the Duke of Liang (the nephew of Emperor Yang's wife Empress Xiao), were also put to death. However, as Emperor Yang's nephew Yang Hao, the Prince of Qin, was a friend of Yuwen Zhiji, Yuwen Zhiji protected him, and Yang Hao was not killed. Yuwen Huaji also spared two other key officials‚ÄîPei Ju (on the basis that Pei had treated the Xiaoguo soldiers well) and Su Wei (on the basis that Su had largely been ignored by Emperor Yang late in his reign).  As regent over Yang Hao  Yuwen Huaji declared himself grand chancellor and effectively served as regent. He issued an edict in Empress Xiao's name, declaring Yang Hao emperor, but did not allow Yang Hao to actually exercise any imperial authorities. He soon gathered Emperor Yang's court, including his concubines and ladies in waiting, as well as officials, and began heading back northwest, toward the eastern capital Luoyang, leaving the general Chen Leng (Èô≥Á®ú) in charge at Jiangdu. On the way, the Xiaoguo officers Mai Mengcai (È∫•Â≠üÊâç), Qian Jie (Èå¢ÂÇë), and Shen Guang (Ê≤àÂÖâ) tried to carry out a counter-coup to overthrow Yuwen Huaji and to avenge Emperor Yang, but they only succeeded in killing the co- conspirator Yuan Min (ÂÖÉÊïè) before they were surrounded and killed. Meanwhile, Yuwen Huaji began to live in luxury, using items and ceremonies only appropriate for emperors. Not willing to abandon Emperor Yang's treasures, he carried them along, at great expense in manpower. Shocked at Yuwen Huaji's conduct, Sima Dekan, Zhao Xingshu, along with several other officers, plotted against Yuwen Huaji, planning to support Sima as leader instead. However, when they secretly asked for support from the nearby agrarian rebel leader Meng Haigong (Â≠üÊµ∑ÂÖ¨), Meng did not respond quickly, and the plot leaked. Yuwen Huaji sent Yuwen Shiji to arrest Sima. He rebuked Sima: :\\"We have together tried to pacify the empire, and it can be said that we have survived 10,000 deaths. Now that we have accomplished it, it is time for us to share our honors. Why were you plotting against me?\\" Sima responded: :\\"We executed the tyrant [i.e., Emperor Yang] because we could not endure his immorality and cruelty, and we supported you. You, instead, are even worse than the tyrant. I was forced into this.\\" Yuwen Huaji then had Sima executed. As Yuwen Huaji approached Luoyang, the rebel leader Li Mi, who controlled the region, resisted him. Yuwen Huaji initially could not get past Li, and therefore went to and took over Dong Commandery (Êù±ÈÉ°, roughly modern Anyang, Henan). Both Li Mi and the Sui officials at Luoyang (who had, after hearing of Emperor Yang's death, declared Emperor Yang's grandson Yang Tong the Prince of Yue emperor) were apprehensive of Yuwen Huaji's next move, and they, previously enemies, entered into an alliance where Li, previously showing imperial ambitions of his own, accepted a Sui-bestowed title of Duke of Wei and nominally submitted to Yang Tong. Yuwen Huaji made several attacks on Li Mi but could not prevail. Li, knowing that Yuwen Huaji's food supplies were running out, pretended to offer peace to Yuwen, agreeing to supply Yuwen's army with food, but instead planning to withhold food and, once Yuwen's food supplies did run out, attack. Li's plans, however, became known by Yuwen, and he in turn made a surprise attack on Li, nearly killing Li, but Li's general Qin Shubao protected Li from death, and eventually Yuwen was repelled. Yuwen, unable to gain food, headed north away from Li, and Li did not trail him. Many of his soldiers surrendered to Li, but he still had some 20,000 men by this point. After Yuwen Huaji reached Wei (È≠èÁ∏£, in modern Handan, Hebei), his close associate Zhang Kai (ÂºµÊÑ∑), who had previously helped him suppress Sima's plot, plotted against him. Yuwen Huaji discovered the plot and executed Zhang and his co-conspirators, but by this point was growing increasingly despondent over the increasing desertions from his rank. He and his brothers often feasted and wept at the feast, and he and Yuwen Zhiji blamed each other for the plot. Yuwen Huaji, believing that defeat was near, wanted to take imperial title. In fall 618, he therefore poisoned Yang Hao to death and declared himself emperor of the state of Xu.  As emperor  In spring 619, Yuwen Huaji attacked Yuan Baozang (ÂÖÉÂØ∂Ëóè), a general previously under Li Mi. (Li Mi had been defeated by the Sui general Wang Shichong in fall 618 and subsequently fled to the newly established Tang Dynasty, although he then tried to rebel against Tang in winter 618 and was killed around the new year 619.) Yuan surrendered to Tang, and subsequently, the Tang general Li Shentong (ÊùéÁ•ûÈÄö, a cousin of the Tang emperor Emperor Gaozu), in turn attacked Yuwen Huaji. Yuwen Huaji could not resist Li Shentong's attacks and fled east to Liaocheng. Li Shentong trailed him and put Liaocheng under siege. Yuwen Huaji then tried to use the treasures he carried to entice other rebel generals into assisting him. Wang Bo (ÁéãËñÑ) accepted, and entered Liaocheng to help defend it. Soon, however, Yuwen Huaji ran out of food and offered to surrender to Li Shentong. Li Shentong's assistant Cui Min'gan (Â¥îÊ∞ëÂππ) suggested that Li Shentong accept the surrender, but Li Shentong, wanting to show off his power and also to seize Yuwen's treasures to award to his soldiers, refused. Meanwhile, Yuwen Huaji had sent Yuwen Shiji out of the city to seek food, and Yuwen Shiji was able to deliver some food supplies to Liaocheng, allowing Yuwen Huaji to recover somewhat, and therefore he withdrew his surrender offer and continued to resist. Li Shentong could not capture the city. However, Dou Jiande the Prince of Xia, another rebel leader intent on attacking Yuwen Huaji, soon arrived, forcing Li Shentong to withdraw. Dou put Liaocheng under siege as well, and Wang Bo opened the city gates to welcome Xia forces in. Dou captured Yuwen Huaji and, referring to himself as \\"your subject\\" when greeting Empress Xiao, declared a mourning period for Emperor Yang and comforted the Sui officials. He arrested Yuwen Zhiji, Yang Shilan, and several other associates of Yuwen Huaji, executing them publicly. He then delivered Yuwen Huaji and Yuwen Huaji's sons Yuwen Chengji (ÂÆáÊñáÊâøÂü∫) and Yuwen Chengzhi (ÂÆáÊñáÊâøÈòØ) to his base Xiangguo (Ë•ÑÂúã, in modern Xingtai, Hebei) and had them beheaded in public. Before Yuwen Huaji was executed, the only thing he stated was, \\"I have never done any harm to the Prince of Xia!\\" Yuwen Huaji's brother, Yuwen Shiji, survived and later became an important official of the new Tang Dynasty.

For ages, wood has been used in Himachal in the construction of temples, homes, idols etc. Weaving Himachali youth wearing traditional hand woven cap ( Kullu, Himachal Pradesh) The extreme winters of Himachal necessitated wool weaving. Nearly every household in Himachal owns a pit-loom .Wool is considered as pure and is used as a ritual cloth. The well known woven object is the shawl, ranging from fine pashmina to the coarse desar. Kullu is famous for its shawls with striking patterns and vibrant colors. Himachali caps are of typical styles and they differ region to region. In Kinnaur, shawls, saris and trousers are woven in wool. The shawls woven in Rampur, known as Rampur chaddar, are known for their soft texture and durability. In Chamba district, weaving assumes a chequered pattern. Besides shawls, carpets and blankets are also a vital part of the Himachali lifestyle. Wood craft Himachal is the one of those areas in India where wood has played a significant role as a structural material. Pine, Cedrus deodara, walnut, horse chestnut and wild black mulberry are found in abundance in Himachal Pradesh. Places famous for woodcraft are Chamba, Tisza, Kalpa, Kinnaur district and Kullu. Village homes are constructed with carvings on doors, windows, balcony panels etc. This can be found in remote areas of the state, especially in the districts of Kinnaur and Kullu .

Antique metal statuettes are one of the most significant aspects in many temples of Himachal Pradesh. The statues of gods and goddesses also appear as mohras or in metal plaques. In fact, metalcraft in the state grew around temples and palaces. Repousse technique was made in use to create the temple doors of Vajreshwari Devi, Jwalamukhi in Kangra, Bhimkali in Sarahan and Chandika Devi in Kinnaur district.

Dean was born in Chicago. In 1846, he enlisted in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War as a surgeon and cavalry captain, apparently using forged medical diplomas from Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, and the Saint Louis University School of Medicine, Missouri. In 1847, he killed a fellow officer in a duel and fled to England, where he spent some months in a lunatic asylum. He married Jane Ann Mitchell, at Hastings and travelled to Adelaide as surgeon on the Augusta in 1849. He practiced as a doctor in Angaston in the Barossa Valley and was naturalised and admitted to a roll of medical practitioners in October 1850. He became an honorary special magistrate in 1852. His populist attacks on George Angas, led Angas to investigate Dean's qualifications and identity. As a result, Governor MacDonnell wrote in 1855 to Jefferson Davis, American Secretary of War to clarify the matter and Davis rejected Dean's claims. He was forced to resign from the magistracy and was struck off the medical rolls in 1857. He attempted to redeem his name by standing for the first election to the House of Assembly for Barossa in March 1857. He won, but he was disqualified by the Court of Disputed Returns. He won the resulting by-election in June but was disqualified again. Dean travelled to Melbourne and Sydney where he wrote for Henry Parkes' The Empire and in 1858 became as a storekeeper at Tinonee, near Taree on the Manning River. He again practised medicine, although unregistered, and started the Manning River News in 1865. In December 1869, he was elected for the Hastings but was disqualified because he worked for the Government as a postmaster. In July 1870, he won the resulting by-election but was again disqualified, this time due to his lack of citizenship. Dean then moved to Uralla and, in 1875, he purchased a store at Grafton. He became Mayor of Grafton, in 1878, but was sacked within six months for \\"gross mismanagement\\". He announced his intention of writing his autobiography, but a flood washed away his papers and destroyed his store. He died in Grafton, survived by four sons and four daughters.

Beerwah has seven springs in the town area. Beerwah is the major route to breath-taking snow resort of Doodhpathri. Doodhpathri lies 19 km away from Beerwah via Arizal. Beerwah is known as \\"The Gateway of Doodhpathri\\" also a gate way to famous tourist spot Tosamaidan. However it was engulfed by Indian army for ICT( Initial cadre training)almost for 100 years. This agreement was completed in 2017 and forces were withdrawn from the area in mid of said year. A decade or two ago Beerwah was the main route to visit famous tourist spot \\"Gulmarg\\".

It is surrounded by plains to the north, east, south, and southwest. The town is flanked by a mountain range on its southern side. At the eastern side of this mountain is located the celebrated cave connected with life of Acharya Abinav Gupta, the greatest Shiva philosopher of Kashmir. The Acharya was called Bhairwa. The celebrated cave is located at the height of nearly 85 meter on the side of the ridge overlooking the crescent shaped narrow valley of evergreen forests with a Sukhnag River flowing through it. The landscape is made up of plateau-like terraces known as karewas. The region contains forested areas with several mountain rivers and streams, including the Mala Kol, Lear Kol, Ahij Kol, Laen, Zaen, Mean and Sona Mean. The Ahij Kol, Laen and Sona Maen share a source at Sukhnag. The Mala Kol is locally known as the \\"deaf and dumb stream\\" due to a legend that when saint Syed Taj-ud-Din arrived in Khag, the stream silently followed him from Sukhnag to Sikandarpora. Local elders continue to tell stories about other local streams. River Sukhnag divides the town of Beerwah into Old town (South bank) and New town (North bank).

According to local legend, (Vanvas) Ram Chander stayed here during his 12-year-long exile with Lakshman and Sita. The spring's name comes from Sita who is said to have bathed in the spring. Naranag spring, or Narain Nag, is located near the Khag village. According to local legend, an ascetic passing through once dropped a bag full of sheep dung into the lake. When he reached Khag several days later, he saw the dung floating on the surface of the Naranag. He returned to Tosamaidan and sprinkled some turmeric powder into the lake, which appeared in the water in the Naranag. The Sukhnag (Sokhanag), known locally as the \\"spring of solace,\\" cascades in a 20 ft high waterfall at Kanj Zubji. Pushkar Nag is located to the east of Poshker village between Khag and Ferozpora, and is named for the village of its origin. According to local history, during the month of Sawan, Kashmiri Pandits would offer prayers and take a ritual dip in the spring. Some devotees continue to perform the ritual today. Gandhak Nag is a sulfur spring in the Darang Khaipora village of Khag. The healing properties of the sulfur make the spring locally significant.

There is universal agreement that some Mesoamerican people practiced human sacrifice and cannibalism, but there is no scholarly consensus as to its extent. At one extreme, anthropologist Marvin Harris, author of Cannibals and Kings, has suggested that the flesh of the victims was a part of an aristocratic diet as a reward, since the Aztec diet was lacking in proteins. According to Harris, the Aztec economy would not support feeding slaves (the captured in war) and the columns of prisoners were \\"marching meat\\". Bernard R. Ortiz de Montellano has proposed that Aztec cannibalism coincided with times of harvest and should be thought of as more of a Thanksgiving. Montellano rejects the theories of Harner and Harris saying that with evidence of so many tributes and intensive chinampa agriculture, the Aztecs did not need any other food sources. At the other extreme, William Arens doubts whether there was ever any systematic cannibalism. Aztec cannibalism The Mexica of the Aztec period are perhaps the most widely studied of the ancient Mesoamerican peoples. While most pre-Columbian historians believe that ritual cannibalism took place in the context of human sacrifices, they do not support Harris' thesis that human flesh was ever a significant portion of the Aztec diet. Michael D. Coe states that while \\"it is incontrovertible that some of these victims ended up by being eaten ritually [‚Ä¶], the practice was more like a form of communion than a cannibal feast\\". Documentation of Aztec cannibalism mainly dates from the period after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire (1519-1521): In The Man-Eating Myth, Arens writes, \\"The gradual transformation of what little evidence is available for Aztec cannibalism is also an indication of the continual need to legitimize the Conquest\\". The following claims could have been exaggerated. * Hern√°n Cort√©s wrote in one of his letters that a Spaniard saw an Indian...eating a piece of flesh taken from the body of an Indian who had been killed.Letters of Cort√©s, trans. Francis A. MacNutt (New York: 1908), 1:256-257, 2:244. Aztecs sacrificing a victim and bleeding their tongue and ears. * The Historia general (compiled 1540-1585) by Bernardino de Sahag√∫n (the first Mesoamerican ethnographer, according to Miguel Le√≥n-Portilla) contains an illustration of an Aztec being cooked by an unknown tribe. This was reported as one of the dangers that Aztec traders faced. * In his book Relaci√≥n (1582), Juan Bautista de Pomar (c. 1535 ‚Äì 1590) states that after the sacrifice the body of the victim was given to the warrior responsible for the capture. He would boil the body and cut it to pieces to be offered as gifts to important people in exchange for presents and slaves. It was rarely eaten, since they considered it of no value. Bernal D√≠az reports that some of these parts of human flesh made their way to the Tlatelolco market near Tenochtitlan. * In 2012 The National Institute for Anthropology and History (INAH) reported that they have discovered around 60 skeletons under subway lines in Mexico City, 50 children, and 10 adults, dating back 500 years. The skeletons appear to have cut marks on the bones that indicated human sacrifice, but does not indicate that cannibalism had occurred. Bernal D√≠az's account Bernal D√≠az's The Conquest of New Spain (written by 1568, published 1632) contains several accounts of cannibalism among the people the conquistadors encountered during their warring expedition to Tenochtitlan. * About the city of Cholula, D√≠az wrote of his shock at seeing young men in cages ready to be sacrificed and eaten.D√≠az del Castillo [c.1568](1992, p.150). * In the same work Diaz mentions that the Cholulan and Aztec warriors were so confident of victory against the conquistadors in an upcoming battle the following day, that \\"...they wished to kill us and eat our flesh, and had already prepared the pots with salt and peppers and tomatoes\\".Diaz del Castillo, Bernal [c.1568](1956, p.178), The Discovery And Conquest Of Mexico, Farrar, Strauss and Cudahy USA oclc 56-5758 * About the Quetzalcoatl temple of Tenochtitlan D√≠az wrote that inside there were large pots, where human flesh of sacrificed Natives was boiled and cooked to feed the priests.D√≠az del Castillo [c.1568](1992, p.176). * About the Mesoamerican towns in general D√≠az wrote that some of the indigenous people he saw were: D√≠az's testimony is corroborated by other Spanish historians who wrote about the conquest. In History of Tlaxcala (written by 1585), Diego Mu√±oz Camargo (c. 1529 ‚Äì 1599) states that: Controversy Accounts of the Aztec Empire as a \\"Cannibal Kingdom\\", Marvin Harris's expression, have been commonplace from Bernal D√≠az to Harris, William H. Prescott and Michael Harner. Harner has accused his colleagues, especially those in Mexico, of downplaying the evidence of Aztec cannibalism. Ortiz de MontellanoOrtiz de Montellano, B.R. \\"Aztec Cannibalism: An Ecological Necessity,\\" Science, 200, 611-617.1978 presents evidence that the Aztec diet was balanced and that the dietary contribution of cannibalism would not have been very effective as a reward. Cannibalism among the Xiximes As recently as 2008, Mexico's National Institute of Archaeology and History (INAH) derided as a \\"myth\\" historical accounts by Jesuit missionaries reporting ritual cannibalism among the Xiximes people of northern Mexico. But in 2011, archaeologist Jos√© Luis Punzo, director of INAH, reported evidence confirming that the Xiximes did indeed practice cannibalism.

He also has a career as a songwriter and singer. Biography Born in 1952 in one of the most traditional neighborhoods of carioca samba, Oswaldo Cruz, at the age of 4 stayed between his father's legs, stunning everyone with his ability on the first cavaquinho chords. At the age of 8, besides having written a parody for one of his father's sambas, for the samba-enredo of the Bloco da Alegria carnival block, was presented with a guitar by his mother Thereza, pastora of the samba school Portela. Therefore, Mauro Diniz gave his first steps towards music guided by the Old Guard of Portela. Had his dreams rocked by antologic sambas from his greatest idol, his father, known by some as the \\"Extraordinary Monarco from Portela\\". Mauro Diniz was an enviable autodidact, during a long while. At the age of 24 he bought his first cavaquinho, never letting go of the instrument until exchanging it for one which had belonged to \\"Master Nelson Cavaquinho\\", which accompanies him to this day. In 1982, started attending Physical Education College, not finishing the course due to the frequent trips he took integrating singer Beth Carvalho's band. Mauro Diniz studied music with people such as the late Copinha, maestro Joaquim Nagle and, indicated by producer Rildo Hora, went on to study classical piano, harmony and perception. Some time later he enrolled in CIGAM, one of the best music courses in Rio de Janeiro, where he concluded the course of Harmony, Improvisation and Arrangement. Mauro was also a student of Ian Guest, which he considers one of his greatest masters. Achievements Today, Mauro Diniz is among the most praised cavaquinists in Brazil, and is one of the most studious. Mauro developed, as does every cavaquinho player, his own style, which was one of the most influentials and which is already part of the history of samba. His strumming patterns are among the most unpredictable and surprising in the samba world, and a lot of the patterns which are part of the standard repertoire of cavaquinho players in the current samba scene were introduced by him. Mauro has recorded with all major samba names; his recordings with Almir Guineto are specially known for cavaquinho rhythm virtuosism; not the least, his recordings with Zeca Pagodinho and Beth Carvalho are registered as the foundation for new generations of sambistas. Some others with whom Mauro has recorded (the list would encompass almost every known sambista): Moacyr Luz, Monarco, Jorge Arag√£o, Wilson Moreira, Luiz Carlos da Vila and the Old Guard of Portela.

It breeds in southern Africa from Angola, southern Congo and Tanzania southwards. It is partially migratory with many birds from the south west of South Africa wintering further north. This is a bird of dry scrub, farmland and clearings. It is often found around human habitation. The pearl-breasted swallow builds a bowl-shaped mud nest reinforced with grass or hair and with a soft lining. It sometimes uses old nests of the greater striped swallow, Hirundo cucullata. The nest may be reused in later years, and one was utilised for 30 years. The nest is built in natural cavities or man-made structures such as buildings, culverts and shafts, but its preference for isolated and abandoned buildings means that this species has not benefited from artificial sites to the same extent as, for example, the greater or lesser striped swallows. The two or three eggs are pure white, and are incubated by the female alone for 16‚Äì17 days to hatching. Both parents then feed the chicks. Fledging takes another 20‚Äì23 days, but the young birds will return to the nest to roost for a few days after the first flight. The pearl-breasted swallow is 13‚Äì14 cm long. It has glossy blue upperparts and grey-white underparts. The upper wings, underwing flight feathers and forked tail are blackish-blue. The underwing coverts are a darker shade of grey-white. The lack of white in the tail is a distinction from similar Hirundo species. The outer feathers are slightly longer in the male than the female. Juveniles are duller and browner than the adult, with shorter outer tail feathers. The northern subspecies, H. d. marwitzi is darker and smaller than nominate H. d. dimidiata, but the differences are small, and the species may be monotypic. The pearl-breasted swallow is sparsely distributed, but can be locally common. It feeds mainly on flying insects, with a fast direct flight. The call is a chittering chip cheree chip chip.

Global sourcing often aims to exploit global efficiencies in the delivery of a product or service. These efficiencies include low cost skilled labor, low cost raw material and other economic factors like tax breaks and low trade tariffs. A large number of Information Technology projects and Services, including IS Applications and Mobile Apps and database services are outsourced globally to countries like India and Pakistan for more economical pricing. Common examples of globally sourced products or services include: labor-intensive manufactured products produced using low-cost Chinese labor, call centers staffed with low-cost English speaking workers in the Philippines and India, and Pakistan and IT work performed by low-cost programmers in India and Pakistan and Eastern Europe. While these examples are examples of Low-cost country sourcing, global sourcing is not limited to low-cost countries. Majority of companies today strive to harness the potential of global sourcing in minimizing cost. Hence it is commonly found that global sourcing initiatives and programs form an integral part of the strategic sourcing plan and procurement strategy of many multinational companies. Global sourcing is often associated with a centralized procurement strategy for a multinational, wherein a central buying organization seeks economies of scale through corporate-wide standardization and benchmarking. A definition focused on this aspect of global sourcing is: \\"proactively integrating and coordinating common items and materials, processes, designs, technologies, and suppliers across worldwide purchasing, engineering, and operating locations (p. 304)\\" Monczka, Trent, and Handfield. 2005. Purchasing and Supply Management, 3rd edition. Thomson South-Western. The global sourcing of goods and services has advantages and disadvantages that can go beyond low cost. Some advantages of global sourcing, beyond low cost, include: learning how to do business in a potential market, tapping into skills or resources unavailable domestically, developing alternate supplier/vendor sources to stimulate competition, and increasing total supply capacity. Some key disadvantages of global sourcing can include: hidden costs associated with different cultures and time zones, exposure to financial and political risks in countries with (often) emerging economies, increased risk of the loss of intellectual property, and increased monitoring costs relative to domestic supply. For manufactured goods, some key disadvantages include long lead times, the risk of port shutdowns interrupting supply, and the difficulty of monitoring product quality. (With regard to quality in the food industry, see Roth et al. (2008).Roth, Tsay, Pullman, Gray. 2008. Unraveling the Food Supply Chain: Strategic Insights from China and the 2007 Pet Food Recalls. Journal of Supply Chain Management, 44(1), 22-39.). International procurement organizations (or IPOs) may be an element of the global sourcing strategy for a firm. These procurement organizations take primary responsibility for identifying and developing key suppliers across sourcing categories and help satisfy periodic sourcing requirements of the parent organization. Such setups help provide focus in country-based sourcing efforts. Particularly in the case of large and complex countries, such as China, where a range of sub-markets exist and suppliers span the entire value chain of a product/commodity, such IPOs provide essential on-the-ground information. Over time, these IPOs may grow up to be complete procurement organizations in their own right, with fully engaged category experts and quality assurance teams. It is therefore important for firms to clearly define an integration and scale-up plan for the IPO.

The theory proposed by Goldberg is that social institutions that are characterised by male dominance may be explained by biological differences between men and women (sexual dimorphism), suggesting male dominance (patriarchy) could be inevitable. Goldberg later refined articulation of the argument in Why Men Rule (1993). \\"A much more precise, developed and persuasive (though repetitive) version of his theory was published in 1993 under the new title Why Men Rule.\\" Catherine Hakim, Key Issues in Women's Work: Female Heterogeneity and the Polarization of Women‚Äôs Employment, 2nd edition, Contemporary Issues in Public Policy, (Routledge Cavendish, 2004), p.4. The main difference between the books is a shift of emphasis from citing anthropological research across all societies, to citing evidence from the workforce in contemporary western societies. \\"In his first book, the emphasis was on anthropological research evidence showing that no society had ever existed in which women ruled. In his more recent book the emphasis shifts to contemporary societies and the evidence that within the workforce vertical job segregation is pronounced. All other hierarchies are also dominated by men.\\" Hakim (2004): 5.  Abstract  Goldberg reviews literature, gathering evidence from expert witnesses (both primary and secondary sources) to demonstrate that each of three distinct patterns of recognised human social behaviour (institutions) has been observed in every known society. Chapter 2 Inevitability (1977). He proposes that these three universal institutions, attested as they are across independent cultures, suggest a simple psychophysiological cause, since physiology remains constant, as do the institutions, even across variable cultures‚Äîa universal phenomenon suggests a universal explanation. Chapter 3 Inevitability (1977). The institutions Goldberg examines and claims to be universal among all known societies are patriarchy (men dominating higher hierarchical positions), male attainment (activities which provide higher status are related to male physiology) and male dominance (cultural expectation of male leadership and control). The hypothetical psychophysiological phenomenon he proposes to explain them, he denotes by the expression differentiation of dominance tendency. UK edition, original US edition used the term aggression. He explains this refers to dominance behaviour being more easily elicited from men on average than from women on average. In other words, he theorises a biologically mediated difference in preferences. Goldberg next provides expert witnesses from several disciplines regarding correlations between behaviour and the hormone testosterone, which are known to be causative in several cases, including dominance preference. He concludes with the hypothesis that testosterone is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the development of the institutions he examined.Inevitability (1977): 131. In other words, without testosterone, the institutions would not develop‚Äîit must be part (but not all) of an explanation for their universality. Finally, Goldberg proposes that if patriarchy is indeed biologically based, it will prove to be inevitable; unless a society is willing to intervene biologically on the male physiology.  Overview  Inevitability starts with a quote that summarises the main \\"nature over nurture\\" point of the book. * Numquam naturam mos vinceret; est enim ea semper invicta. : Custom will never conquer nature; for it is always invincible. :: ‚Äî Marcus Tullius Cicero, Tusculanae Disputationes, c. 45 BC. The book has ten chapters divided into four parts (I‚ÄìIV), and an addendum. The five chapters of the first part outline Goldberg's theory of patriarchy. The second part contains two chapters of engagement with alternative views. The third part speculates about possible cognitive differences between men and women. Part four consists of a single chapter of general sociological commentary on broader community discussion of the relationships between men and women. The addendum that concludes the book is offered in support of the anthropological consensus described in chapter 2 of part I, but has been considered by some to be the most valuable part of the total work, Daniel Seligman, \\"Why Men Rule: A Theory of Male Dominance\\", National Review, 4 April 1994. including Goldberg himself. \\"Cultural anthropology has given the world a priceless treasure ... the ethnographic descriptions of many hundreds‚Äîor thousands, if one counts less formal works‚Äîof societies and the incredible variation they have demonstrated. In the future, when the homogenization of the world has made all societies more alike than different, only these ethnographies will stand against the human ethnocentric tendency to think things had to be the way they are.\\" Steven Goldberg, quoted in William Helmreich. \\"Steven Goldberg, Iconoclast: The Most Controversial Professor in America\\", Heterodoxy 2 (September 1994): p. 12.  Criticism  In Key Issues in Women's Work (2nd ed., 2004), sociologist Catherine Hakim compares four competing theories of male dominance, including Goldberg's theory of patriarchy as well as her own preference theory, and notes the strengths and weaknesses of patriarchy theory.Hakim (2004). For example, women's dislike of female bosses is consistent with Goldberg's theory.Hakim (2004): 119. Goldberg's \\"is the only theory that can explain some of the more inconvenient facts about women as well as men\\".Hakim (2004): 6. \\"No other theory has been offered which can explain women's rejection of females in authority\\". She comments that Goldberg's theory \\"contrasts interestingly with the mind-games that Western intellectuals like to play\\",Hakim (2004): 206. but concludes that Goldberg's thesis has yet to be fully proven.Hakim (2004): 208. In her book's final chapter, after reviewing the empirical evidence, she notes that none of the four competing theories fully explains women's subordination, but that preference theory rules out the salience of sex and gender, given the evidence for female heterogeneity. The Marxist anthropologist Eleanor Leacock takes a more political view of Goldberg's work. In a response to Goldberg's The Inevitability of Patriarchy, she characterizes Goldberg's theories as simplistic and irresponsible: \\"To consign the grim brutalities of abused power we see everywhere about us to what amounts to masculine 'original sin' not only denies the historical and ethnographic record... but seriously disarms all of us, as humanity, in the urgency of our need to understand and redirect our social life if we would insure ourselves a future.\\" Biological anthropologist Frank B. Livingstone criticizes Goldberg's understanding of causation in evolution, characterizing the evolutionary model presented in The Inevitability of Patriarchy as \\"absolutely backward\\". According to Livingstone, social behavior drives evolution rather than the other way around: \\"Contrary to Goldberg, I do not believe that a genetic or physiological change will occur first and then cause social or behavioral change. In fact, just the opposite, the behavior or way of life of a population determines the fitness values of the genotypes, and this changes the genetic characteristics of the population.\\"  Selection of criticism 1973‚Äì1993  * Eleanor Maccoby, \\"Sex in the social order\\", Science 182 (November, 1973): 469ff.

An Old Bolshevik who rose to power during the rule of Joseph Stalin, joining the Politburo as a candidate member in 1926 and as a full member in 1932. Andreyev also headed the powerful Central Control Commission of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1930 to 1931 and then again from 1939 until 1952. In 1952 Andreyev was removed from the Politburo and placed in a largely ceremonial position as a member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. Biography=Early years Andrey Andreyevich Andreyev was born in the Sychyovsky Uyezd of the Smolensk Governorate of the Russian Empire to a peasant family. He left the village at the age of 13 to work as a dishwasher in Moscow. He attended workers' educational courses, and by the time he was 15 had joined a Marxist circle. He joined the Bolsheviks after settling in Petrograd to work in the Putilov arms factory, in 1914. During the great war, he worked as a hospital administrator, while carrying on illegal political work. He was a member of the Petrograd committee of the Bolsheviks in 1915-16, and one of the organisers of the wave of strikes that preceded the fall of the Tsar. After the February revolution, he helped found the Petrograd Metal workers' Union. He was in the crowd that welcomed the Bolshevik leader, Vladimir Lenin on his return from exile in April 1917. At the Bolshevik conference that same month, he was one of the younger delegates who backed Lenin's call for a second revolution. Union leader Andreyev spent the early part of the Russian civil war as a trade union and communist party organiser in the Urals, where he oversaw the nationalisation of the factories, and for ensuring that the new soviet republic was supplied with metal, and food He was posted in 1919 to Ukraine as the leader of the metal workers' union, and a member of the All-Russian Central Trade Union Council (TUC). In the latter part of 1919, Lenin came up against heavy opposition from the trade unions, who wanted democratic control of industry, which Lenin believed would undermine efficiency and delay economic recovery. In January 1920, he was outvoted in a meeting of the communist 'fraction' of the All-Russian TUC. Throughout, Andreyev was one of the minority who supported Lenin's line. His reward was to be appointed head of the railway workers' union, and at the 9th Communist Party Congress in March 1920 he was one of three union leaders, along with Mikhail Tomsky and Janis Rudzutaks elected to the 19-member Central Committee, which, prior to the creation of the Politburo, was the body that effectively ruled Russia and its former colonies. Aged 24, he was its youngest member. (The second youngest, Nikolai Bukharin, was 31.) During 1920-21, the Central Committee was split 10-9 split over the role of the unions. The minority, led by Leon Trotsky proposed that they be incorporated in the state; the majority, led by Lenin and including Josif Stalin argued for their continued existence, under party control. Andreyev was the only leading trade unionist to support the minority line \\\\- surprisingly, in view of his later career. (He was the only former member of that committee apart from Stalin still alive after the Great Purge: all the other who had not died in the meantime were killed.) Andreyev was dropped from the Central Committee in March 1921, but when the TUC had its next congress, in May 1921, he loyally supported the party leadership against a campaign led by the veteran revolutionary David Riazanov, who called for union leaders to be elected rather than appointed by the party. Tomsky and Rudzutaks were sacked, temporarily, for failing to block this proposal, whilst Andreyev was made a secretary of the TUC, and at the 11th party congress in April 1922, he was restored to membership of the party's Central Committee. He retained his membership for the next 40 years. He was also co-opted onto the Orgburo, which was dominated by Stalin, the newly appointed General Secretary.  Party official  Shortly after Lenin's death, in June 1924, Andreyev was appointed a Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. From that date Andreyev was a loyal supporter of Stalin and part the inner core of the Stalinist faction. He was one of five hard line Stalinists who were raised to candidate membership of the Politburo in July 1926, a few months before Trotsky was expelled from the same body. In 1925, when the People's Commissar for Finance, Grigori Sokolnikov, pointed out that workers' wages were still below their pre-war (1913) level and suggested raising them, Andreyev denounced him for attacking the trade unions and for his 'irresponsible attitude to the workers'. From January 1928 to December 1930, Andreyev was based in Rostov in south Russia, as First Secretary of the North Caucasus territory party committee. In this capacity, he was responsible for the seeing through the forcible collectivisation of agriculture in one of Russia's main grain-producing regions. At the outset, he seemed hesitant about forcing the pace: as late as October 1929, he forecast that it would be impossible to complete the changeover to collective agriculture before the end of the First five-year plan in 1933. His complaints about the difficulty of achieving the grain deliveries Stalin demanded almost caused a rift, when Stalin lost his temper with Andreyev - but then, unusually, apologised. By December, Andreyev had committed the regional party to a target of complete collectivisation by the spring 1931. In January 1930, he announced that they had been too modest, and would complete the process during that year. As part of the process, the North Caucasus OGPU was set a quota of 6,000-8,000 'kulaks' to be arrested and executed, and 20,000 to be deported to remote parts of the USSR. By February, 80 per cent of the rural population of the North Caucasus had been herded onto collective farms, but the result was armed rebellion by thousands of peasants, which was put down by the Red Army, and which forced a partial retreat by the authorities. Within two months, the proportion of peasants on collective farms had fallen to 67 per cent. In December 1930, Andreyev was recalled to Moscow and appointed Chairman of the Central Control Commission, which was responsible for party discipline, and chairman of Rabkrin. In September 1931, he volunteered to take the additional post of People's Commissar for Transport, after the Politburo had heard a report on the serious state of the railways. He relinquished the chairmanship of the control commission on 4 February 1932, when he became a full member of the Politburo. In March 1935, Andreyev was reappointed a secretary of the Central Committee, in the wake of the assassination of Sergey Kirov. On 3 April 1935, he was co-opted onto the Orgburo, to chair its meetings, and was put in charge of the Industrial department of the communist party.  Role in the 1930s purges  During the Great Purge, when it was common to send high-ranking party officials from Moscow to the provinces to oversee mass expulsions and arrests of provincial communist party members, Andreyev \\"became the unchallengeable master of these murderous sideshows.\\". Between June and September 1937, he travelled to Voronezh, Chelyabinsk, Sverdlovsk, Kursk, Saratov, Kuibyshev, Tashkent, Stalinabad, Rostov and Krasnodar. Sometimes, he accused local party leaders of arresting the wrong people, who were released. More often, his arrival meant arrests and executions. He always stayed in telegram communication with Stalin, who always approved all his recommended lists of party members to be expelled and/or arrested. Early in January 1937, he arrived in Rostov to organise the removal of Boris Sheboldayev, his successor as regional party in the renamed Azov-Black Sea territory, who was accused of excessive leniency because he had allowed former oppositionists such as Alexander Beloborodov and Nikolai Glebov-Avilov to hold responsible jobs in the region. Sheldboldayev temporarily saved himself by apologising, and was transferred to another post, only to be arrested later and shot. In Saratov, where he arrived on 20 July, his main target was the local head of the NKVD Yakov Agranov, who was arrested and shot, along with the second secretary of the regional communist party and others. Some people whom Agranov had had arrested were released. At the same time, Andreyev and identified 20 employees of the Machine Tractor Stations, who were \\"working very obstructively\\". Stalin replied with a telegram the same day, saying they should all be shot. In total, in the wake of his visit, 430 people were shot. In Kuibyshev, he ordered the local party boss, Pavel Postyshev to step up the hunt for hidden enemies, after which Postyshev disbanded most of the local party branches, and had 3,300 party members arrested. By the end of 1937, it was decided that Postyshev had gone too far, and Andreyev was assigned the job of collecting names of people wrongfully expelled from the Kuibyshev party, after which Postyshev was arrested and shot. When Andreyev arrived in Tashkent, in September 1937, the founder of the Uzbek communist party, Faizullah Khojaev and seven others were denounced as enemies of the people. Four days later, on 12 September, the First Secretary of the Uzbek communist party Akmal Ikramov was expelled from the party. He was arrested two weeks later. In the ensuing purge, 430 people were executed. Andreyev then moved onto Stalinabad, in Tajikistan, where he had 344 shot. In March 1938, an official of the USSR Writers' Union approached Andreyev about finding work for the poet Osip Mandelstam, who was in Moscow, but unemployed. Andreyev refused. Mandelstam was arrested, and died in the gulag. In October 1940, he issued an order that a recently published book of poems by Anna Akhmatova was banned and all copies were to be seized. in 1940, Akhmatova had suddenly been granted official recognition, having been prevented from publishing any of her work for 15 years. Andreyev's order meant that \\"Akhmatova's nine months a published poet again had come to an end.\\" In November 1938, Andreyev supervised the changes at the headquarters of the NKVD, in which Lavrentiy Beria was confirmed as its new head in place of Nikolai Yezhov, who was arrested and shot. Also in November, he chaired a session of the Central Committee of Komsomol, the communist youth league, at which most of its leaders were sacked, and later arrested and shot.  Later career  In 1939, Andreyev resumed his former position as Chairman of the Central Commission, combining that with his continued role as party secretary and Politburo member. He was also Chairman of the Soviet of the Union from 1938 until 1946. Despite this array of titles, there were signs that he was being supplanted within Stalin's inner circle by Georgi Malenkov, Nikita Khrushchev Nikolai Voznesensky and other rising stars. During the war, he was not included in the emergency State Defense Committee (GOKO), or involved front line duties, but was given responsibility for transport and food supplies, as Deputy Chairman of the transport sub-committee of GOKO, and as USSR People's Commissar for Agriculture, 1943‚Äì46, and was chairman of the Kolkhoz (collective farms) Central Council from December 1943 to February 1950. After the war, Andreyev appeared to recover his position. In March 1946, he was appointed a Deputy Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers, responsible for agriculture, while Malenkov was temporarily removed from his role as party secretary, and a protege of Andreyev, Nikolai Patolichev was appointed head of the party organisation department. In March 1947, Khrushchev was temporarily ousted from control of the Ukrainian communist party, and Patolichev was sent to Kiev apparently as the party secretary in charge of agriculture. During 1948, Andreyev ran the investigation which brought down Voznesensky, whom he accused of losing 526 documents from Gosplan. \\"This invented case was one of Andreyev's last achievements.Montefiore, Stalin, pgs. 606,611. It marked the start of the Leningrad case. However, by the summer of 1947, both Malenkov and Khrushchev had recovered their positions, while Andreyev was ill. His doctors proscribed cocaine, to which he became addicted. In December 1949, he was replaced by Khrushchev as the party secretary in charge of agriculture. Although still nominally a member of the Politburo, he was in reality excluded from the party leadership in what Khrushchev later described, somewhat hypocritically, as one of Stalin's \\"most unbridled acts of willfulness.\\" According to Sergo Mikoyan, son of Andreyev's contemporary and colleague, Anastas Mikoyan Andreyev asked for permission to go into semi- retirement, because he had become partially deaf - making him the only high ranking communist in Stalin's time to leave office alive, without being arrested.  Family  Andreyev was married to Dora Khazan (1894-1961), who was a student along with Stalin's second wife, Nadezhda Alliluyeva, at an industrial academy.Sheila Fitzpatrick, On Stalin's Team: The Years of Living Dangerously. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2015; pg. 317. Together the couple had two children, a son named Vladimir (born 1919) and a daughter Natalya (born 1922-2015). Dora Khazan worked in Stalin's secretariat for a time. She was arrested in 1948. It was not unknown for Politburo members to continue in high offices while their wives were in the gulag: the same happened to Vyacheslav Molotov, Mikhail Kalinin and Otto Kuusinen, among others. He later married Zinaida Ivanovna Desyatova. They had two daughters, Tatyana and Valentina. He has three grandchildren - Kochergin Ilya N., Kharlamov and Ivan V. Kharlamov Xenia Vyacheslavovna. Death and legacy Andreyev was formally removed from the Politburo, after 20 years, at the 19th party congress in October 1952. After Stalin's death, he was briefly brought back as Chairman of the Central Commission, in 1954-56, and was made a member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, a largely ceremonial position. Because he was no threat to Khrushchev or his successors, his role in the great purges was generally kept quiet for as long as the communist dictatorship lasted. However, after he died, on 5 December 1971, despite his historical importance and decades of tenure in the top ranks of Soviet government officials, Andreyev's funeral was not attended by either Leonid Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the CPSU, or Alexei Kosygin, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers.Evan Mawdsley and Stephen K. White, The Soviet Elite from Lenin to Gorbachev: The Central Committee and its Members, 1917‚Äì1991. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000; pg. 145. Andreyev is remembered for having loved the music of Tchaikovsky, mountaineering, and nature photography.Montefiore, Stalin, pg. 224. During his life Andreyev was four times awarded the Order of Lenin, the Order of the October Revolution, and other awards. He is the namesake of the AA-20 locomotive, which he is credited for sponsoring as the head of the Soviet railway system from 1931 to 1935.

United Kingdom Throughout the Articles' existence, there were separate sets for the navy and army. Royal Navy The UK's (or rather England's) first Articles of War were written for the Royal Navy. They formed the statutory provisions regulating and governing the behaviour of members of the Royal Navy. They were prominently displayed in all naval ships, and set out a list of criminal provisions which applied to members of the Royal Navy and others to whom the Act applied, in addition to the criminal law of England and Wales and any local criminal law. The naval Articles of War were originally issued by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty in 1653 as fighting instructions after defeat at the Battle of Dungeness. Soon after the Restoration, they were converted into an Act of Parliament.http://www.hmsrichmond.org/avast/customs.htmArticles of War, 1661, 1749 and 1866 / (1982) After another defeat at the Battle of Toulon, Parliament amended the Articles in 1749, further tightening discipline. These Articles resulted in the execution of Admiral John Byng, despite a clear sentiment in the navy and in Parliament that he should be given some lesser punishment. In response, the 1779 amendment was the start of a gradual process of easing the more draconian punishments. The naval Articles were retained in the 1957 Naval Discipline Act but then replaced by the provisions of the tri- service Armed Forces Act 2006. British Army The first set of Articles of War for the English Army, from 1707 the British Army, were written under William III (William of Orange) (r.1689‚Äì1702), taking the place of the medieval Rules and Ordinances of War, a list of regulations issued by the king at the beginning of every expedition or campaign. The Mutiny Acts empowered the king de jure and his government de facto to govern their army by creating a set of Articles of War for each conflict.E Samuel, An historical account of the British army: and of the law military, 1812, page 224 To a large degree, they were superseded by King's Regulations in force at all times. The Articles of War fell out of use by the Army when they were omitted from the Army Act 1955. United States  On 30 June 1775, the Second Continental Congress established 69 Articles of War to govern the conduct of the Continental Army.Articles of War, June 30, 1775 Effective upon its ratification in 1789, Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution provided that Congress has the power to regulate the land and naval forces.U.S. Const., Art.

It was extraordinarily popular in its day, and held an influence on popular theatre for over a century. Its echoes can be seen in the works of Rabelais. A number of phrases from the play became proverbs in French, and the phrase \\"Let us return to our muttons\\" (revenons √† nos moutons) even became a common English calque. In the play there are only five characters: the title character, his wife Guillemette, a clothier named Guillaume Joceaulme, a shepherd named Thibault l‚ÄôAignelet, and finally a judge. Every character except the last is dishonest in some way, which is exploited to great effect. The play focuses on issues including the complex emerging state structure and honesty. In total, it can be performed in approximately one hour. Plot summary Master Pierre Pathelin is a local village lawyer with no professional, formal training who has very little work, due to the emerging class of professionally trained clerks and lawyers. In order to obtain cloth to replace his and his wife's holey clothing, he visits the clothier Guillaume Joceaulme. By flattering him, Pathelin convinces the clothier ‚Äî against his better judgment ‚Äî to let him have six yards of fine cloth on credit. However, he promises Joceaulme that he can visit his house that day to be paid. When Pathelin arrives home he tells his wife Guillemette that the clothier is due to arrive home and to pretend that Pathelin has been sick in bed for almost three months. After some humorous arguments, Joceaulme barges in on Pathelin, who is in bed and raving like a madman. In time Pathelin's entertaining babble moves from one French dialect to another, which Guillemette has to explain away. After Joceaulme gives up on attempting to retrieve his payment, he turns his thoughts to his shepherd, Thibault l‚ÄôAignelet, who has been stealing Joceaulme's sheep and eating them for the past three years. Joceaulme summons Aignelet to court, and the latter goes to Pathelin in order to be legally represented. Pathelin directs Aignelet to say only \\"Baaa\\" (like a sheep) when anyone questions him in court in the hope that the judge will find Joceaulme's case groundless, as it will appear that he has taken a mentally-challenged person to court. At the trial Joceaulme instantly recognizes Pathelin. He tries to explain the details of both cases (the stolen cloth and the stolen sheep) to the judge, but he is unable to do so clearly, and the judge conflates the two cases.

Its native range is within Mexico. P. gigantea's flower is usually a purple colour with the occasional light blue also seen. P. gigantea was once classified as Pinguicula ayautla. This Pinguicula was discovered by Alfred Lau and described by the botanist Hans Luhrs. Pinguicula gigantea has a few different forms, such as the 'white flower' form or the 'blue flower'. Plant characteristics=Habitat Pinguicula gigantea grows in the Mexican state of Oaxaca at an altitude of 688 meters or 2260 feet. Leaves and carnivory Pinguicula gigantea, unlike most Pinguicula species, has sticky upper and undersides of the leaves. The leaves have trichomes on them, which secrete a mucilage that traps prey. P. gigantea's leaves are among the largest in its genus. The species epithet, gigantea, describes this characteristic. Flowers The flowers of P. gigantea are usually zygomorphic. The varieties of P. gigantea differ solely on their flowers, such as the 'blue flower' P. gigantea or the 'white flower' forms. Other forms have also been described. A dark purple flower exists in cultivation as well.http://carnivorousplantsusa.com/pinguicula.html Dormancy and winter Pinguicula gigantea is a tropical Mexican species of Pinguicula. Its dormancy is not regulated by temperature or light. Like most tropical species, its dormancy is triggered by lack of moisture. Very little precipitation falls during the winter in Mexico where this Pinguicula species lives. In order to survive in these conditions it forms non-carnivorous leaves and can handle dry conditions. When the plant emerges from its dormant period in the Spring, it produces new carnivorous leaves and eventually flowers. Cultivation Cultivation of P. gigantea requires little effort. P. gigantea thrives in soil medium that is more well-drained than most carnivorous plant media. Propagating Pinguicula gigantea can be propagated by seed or by leaf cutting. The disadvantages to propagation by seed include slow growth and the use of a second flowering P. gigantea plant to obtain better seed set results. Propagating by leaf cuttings has the advantage of a shorter time to the adult plant. Availability Pinguicula gigantea is available in cultivation.

They formed in 1989 and have toured Australia, Europe, the United States and South America. Biography=Pre-Chevelles The Chevelles' founding members are Guy Douglas on drums, Jeff Halley on bass guitar, Richard Lane on guitar, keyboards and vocals and Duane Smith on guitar. Smith's first band was the Freuds, which he formed with school friend Bruce Abbot and Halley (of the Kryptonics) in Perth in 1987. Ian Tubbs, their later drummer and formerly of the Lincolns, had also played in the Freuds. That band was short-lived, breaking up in 1989, despite having a recording contract with Revolution Records. At that time Lane was looking for a new project following the break- up of the Stems in 1987. For a period Lane had moved to Sydney and tried to put together another Stems-style band, without success. Halley and Smith had befriended Lane during the Freuds' and the Stems' concurrent careers. When Lane returned to Perth in 1989 they approached him with the idea of forming a new band. The Stems' drummer Gary Chambers was included in rehearsal sessions and jamming began late in 1989. However, Chambers lived too far away from Perth and could not sustain his involvement in a new band. His replacement was former Freuds and Rackett drummer, Douglas.  1989‚Äì93: Early days  The band took their name from the United States mid-sized car, Chevrolet Chevelle. They played their first headline show at the Coronado Hotel on 15 December 1989. The Chevelles signed with Sydney-based independent label, Zero Hour Records, (named after the Plimsouls' tune), operated by former the Stems roadie, George Matzkov. In April 1990 they recorded six tracks at Poons Head Studios in Perth. Matzkow chose Lane's punk pop rocker \\"Be My Friend\\" and Smith's \\"She Don't Come Around\\" for the band's first single. Although he thought there were better songs he felt those two captured the energy he was looking for from the band. The single, \\"Be My Friend\\", was released in August 1990. It was praised in pop zines such as Bucketfull of Brains, whose writer felt, \\"'Be My Friend' is a non stop rocker in prime Hoodoo Gurus/Screaming Tribesman heyday fashion with hooks a plenty and loads of blazing guitars.\\" Steve Gardener of Noise for Heroes opined, \\"[it] is harder and nastier than any Stems song.\\" Outside Australia it was promoted in Spain, Germany and France. The band's connection to the Stems was an attention-getter. Requests for tribute compilations followed and they recorded \\"Zero Hour\\" for a Plimsouls tribute album and \\"Back of My Car\\" for an Alex Chilton tribute on Spanish label Munster Records. In late 1990 they recorded five tracks for an extended play at Planet Studios: The Kids Ain't Hip, it was released in November. A trip to the east coast and high radio rotation for the track, \\"Show Me Your Love\\", confirmed the band's prospects. Upon return to Perth they embarked on an intensive gigging schedule. They supported local gigs by eastern states bands, Ratcat, Falling Joys and the Plunderers. In the later half of 1991, friction in the band mounted and delays in recording the band's first album followed. In September 1991 during rehearsal Smith presented a track, \\"Valentine\\", to the other band members. Lane said that the Chevelles were strictly a vehicle for his music. Halley and Smith then dismissed Lane from the band. The Chevelles performed a final show with Lane on Christmas Eve 1991. He was replaced on guitar by Adrian Allen (ex-the Diehards). The Diehards had supported the Chevelles, and Allen had previously filled in at gigs for Smith or Lane on occasion. A New Year's Eve concert at Wildwood Winery, alongside Boom Crash Opera, the Neptunes, the Kryptonics and the Dweebs, was the new line-up's first show. The band had found new focus at a live level but their recording plans were in a mess. Almost a full album's worth of material had been recorded with Lane. They salvaged some of Smith's tracks from those sessions, including the next single, \\"Girl for Me\\". Lane released his tracks under the name of his new band, the Rosebuds, without crediting the Chevelles' members for their performances. Meanwhile, the relationship between the Chevelles and Zero Hour had become strained. Royalties from the single and EP had not been seen by the band and the label had begun to license overseas releases and printing T-shirts, without their knowledge. Although they owed Zero Hour five tracks, they signed with Survival Records, whose acts included the Hitmen and the Screaming Tribesmen.McFarlane, 'The Hitmen' entry. Archived from the original on 3 August 2004. Retrieved 11 April 2018.McFarlane, 'Screaming Tribesmen' entry. Archived from the original on 3 August 2004. Retrieved 11 April 2018. Survival had connections in Europe, with an office in Brussels and distribution through Play It Again Sam. The label compiled a ten-song retrospective CD of the band's Zero Hour material, The Kids Ain't Hip (1992) for release in Europe. At the same time Zero Hour negotiated a similar release, In the Zero Hour (1993), through Spanish label Munster Records. In mid-1992 the Chevelles recorded and then released a new single, \\"Girl for Me\\" (October), with two B-sides: \\"Valentine\\" and Allen's first contribution, \\"On My Mind\\". For the remainder of that year they performed regular gigs in Perth, supporting Falling Joys, the Clouds and overseas acts the Smithereens. They issued another single, \\"Murder on Her mind\\" (January 1993).  1993‚Äì94: Gigantic  Gigantic, their debut album, had been planned for the end of 1991, but was delayed until June 1993. It received positive reviews in Australian Rolling Stone and in street press. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, observed, \\"Rather than concentrating on traditional 1960s jangly guitar pop, [it] showcased the band's heavier and more textured, but still tuneful, approach.\\" Radio picked up tracks, \\"Murder on her Mind\\" and \\"Memories\\", the latter was the third single from the album, delivered late in 1993 with three bonus tracks, including a tougher version of \\"Show Me Your Love\\" and a cover version of the Backdoor Men's \\"Out of My Mind\\". The band followed with three tours of the eastern states. The first was supporting Matthew Sweet on his Altered Beast tour. Then they supported United Kingdom visitors, the Sweet, on a national tour. Subsequently Guy Douglas left due to musical and personal differences. A Bunbury-based band, the Calhoons, had been supporting the Chevelles. They enlisted the support group's drummer, Mario Frisino, to fill-in. The band played gigs in Perth and Bunbury with Frisino and then made another trip to the eastern states in mid-1993. Back in Perth they recruited Martin Moon on drums as a permanent replacement. He had played with Perth bands the Marigolds, the Neptunes and Dom Mariani's Orange. The new line-up made another rip to the eastern states in late 1993 and then travelled to Europe. Survival Records booked the Chevelles to play around 40 shows over six weeks across December 1993 and January 1994. The tour covered Spain, France, Germany, and Switzerland. They played alongside label mates, the Screaming Tribesmen and Screamfeeder. In Spain the band met promoters and labels eager to release their records and organise more tours. Running Circle Records, whose manager, Michael Statesmann, had connections in Australia, organised six extra Spanish shows before the band headed home in January, and placed the Chevelles on a large support bill for a Summer Festival in the island of Majorca in July 1994. Between the European and the Mallorca Festival Martin Moon left due to personal reasons and was replaced by Julian Buckland on drums.  1994‚Äì96: Rollerball Candy After their Majorca festival appearance in mid-1994 Buckland and Smith stayed in Spain to play four promotional shows. When they arrived back in Australia the Chevelles began work on their next album, Rollerball Candy. Friction was developed between them and Survival. Recording sessions were under way but the label could not confirm a release date or promotion plans. It was withholding the band's royalties for Gigantic, and had fragmented the band's interests by sub- licensing that album to a number of different labels and distributors, including Shock Records in Australia and Play It Again Sam in Europe. The band confronted Survival on these issues and a decision was made to dissolve their contract. The band signed with Running Circle for a distribution deal for the second studio album, in Spain and the rest of Europe. Plans for worldwide distribution were delayed while trying to signed with Australian and other labels. Rollerball Candy was released by Running Circle in early 1995. It was more varied than Gigantic, displaying a punk sound in \\"Delirium\\" and including a melodic ballad called \\"Fall\\". Its 15 tracks made it a long album for a pop group but in essence it was tailor-made for Spanish rock and roll fans. Initial sales of the record in Spain and Portugal were encouraging. Response from Spanish press and radio was excellent. The record received strong reviews in established Spanish rock zines like Ruta 66, Beaten Generation and La Musica, in which the band were compared to Mariani's DM3 and to the Dubrovniks. Sales and promotion of Rollerball Candy were lower in Australia. With no distribution deal they relied on sales at shows and through a small number of Perth and eastern states record stores. Fans in Sydney and Melbourne were unaware of the new album. At that time Running Circle's European distribution campaign was floundering. There was no evidence that the disc had was being distributed or promoted outside Spain. Smith put together another band, Rollercoaster, to play songs which were unsuitable for the Chevelles. Teaming with Grant Ferstat (ex-Month of Sundays), Dave Shaw of the Stems and Boom Babies) and Craig Maclean, he recorded an 11-track rock album. Smith believed it would be well received in the Spanish rock scene, it was released in mid-1999 on Spanish power pop label, Snap Records. In mid-1996 Running Circle were bankrupt, this annulled the Chevelles' contract. Rollerball Candy had been released almost 18 months earlier and had not succeeded, through poor distribution and promotion. The band resolved to take the record back to the market. Smith contacted Paradoxx Music, a Brazilian dance music label, and negotiated for its release. An agreement was formed but the deal fell apart when Paradoxx restructured and restaffed. The band continued to have a following in Spain. Allen and Smith played three acoustic shows in Madrid in January 1997. Later that year, after six months of sporadic playing in Perth, the band sought a new deal in Australia. David Hughes-Owen, the manager of Perth power pop label, Spinning Top, had known the band for years. Smith had offered Rollerball Candy to Hughes-Owen for Australian release back in January 1995, but at the time the label felt it did not have the money or network to support it. Spinning Top put together an Australian power pop compilation, Pop on Top, for US label Bomp! Records, using the Chevelles' \\"She's Not Around\\" as its lead track. The compilation was released in 1996 and was well received in the US, where Spinning Top discovered the Chevelles had a fan base.  1997‚Äì99: At Second Glance In 1997 the Chevelles and Spinning Top formed an agreement to see if the label could market Rollerball Candy. Spinning Top had an association with US label Not Lame, whose manager Bruce Brodeen was a fan of the group and accepted an offer to release some of their material. They had obtained the rights to its back catalogue so Not Lame had the choice of all tracks back to 1992. Brodeen put together a compilation, At Second Glance, concentrating on the band's melodic pop sound rather than its rock aspect. At Second Glance was released in March 1998. The thirteen-track CD was released by Not Lame in the US and Spinning Top Records in Australia. It was the band's first release in Australia since Gigantic in 1993. Drummer Julian Buckland resigned, Dave Shaw joined the group, and the album was launched in July 1998. It received supportive reviews in the US: Pop freelance writer Claudio Sossi wrote \\"The Chevelles excel at making incredibly catchy guitar-based pure pop songs without compromise.\\" National distribution plus strong hometown reviews in Perth and radio airplay on Triple J, Triple R and community stations ensured they regained a profile in Australia. Not Lame was pleased with US sales, with the limited pressing of At Second Glance selling well in two months. It was given some airplay on college radio. Spinning Top's European connections ensured the album reached its markets. French label Hellfire Club Records released a four-track vinyl EP, Mezmerised, which used the tougher- edged tracks from Rollerball Candy. The band was included on two compilations: Beat Party CD on Japan's One and Two Records and Pop Under the Surface on Swedish label Yesterday Girl Records. The band organised a tour of Spain in January 1999, adding a French leg to support, Mezmerized. Most of the ten Spanish shows were sold out before the band arrived. The seven dates in France were also successful. The tour proved to the band that they were still had many fans in Europe, even though it was their first full-band tour since 1994.  2000‚Äì01: Sun Bleached to Delirium  The Chevelles recorded seven new tracks in May 1999 ‚Äî their first full studio session since Rollerball Candy some four years earlier. Three of the seven songs (including a version of Air Supply's \\"Lost in Love\\") were completed to demo level and then shopped by Spinning Top to various labels throughout Australia, Europe and the US. San Francisco label Zip Records started negotiations for a US EP and album release and advanced funds for more recordings. Sun Bleached, a five-track EP, was released on Zip in October 2000. Zip Records' strong promotional network pushed the EP to over 300 college radio stations. Spinning Top also negotiated a deal with Zip which saw the Chevelles and other Spinning Top bands be released under the Zip Records banner in Australia through MGM Distribution. Offers for the band to tour continued to come in and in early 2001 the band embarked on a 12-date tour of Brazil with GANGgajang and Yothu Yindi. A 20-track best-of CD titled Delirium was released in Brazil to coincide with the tour. The highlight of the successful tour was playing to a crowd of over 20,000 on the beach in Rio de Janeiro. In mid-2001 the Chevelles were recording another new album. A deal was set up with Spanish label Bittersweet for the release of Sunseekers (a compilation of the Sunbleached EP and six new tracks, which re-appear on Girl God). Its release in late 2001 was followed by another tour of Spain in March 2002. The tour coincided with the UK release of the all-new album Girl God. Three UK dates were added to the Spanish tour and, at the request of a Brazilian radio station, two shows were booked in Brazil.  2002‚Äì10: Girl God to Accelerator  The band launched Girl God in Australia in May 2002. The song \\"Get It On\\" from Girl God is featured as a downloadable track in Rock Band 2. In 2008 the Chevelles signed with Little Steven's Wicked Cool Records. This deal enabled the release of an anthology album titled Barbarella Girl God - Introducing the Chevelles, which featured four new songs, and a new studio album, Accelerator. The album was recorded at Forensic Sound Studios and Lounge Studios in Perth, with Ian Tubbs on drums. Accelerator was released in 2010. It was recorded over two recording sessions, where drum tracks were laid down by Marz \\"Calhoon\\" Frisini at Forensic Sound Studios, and then with Paul Di Renzo at Lounge Studios, Perth. The rest of the recording was done in the Chevelles studio - ATOMiC Studios, with production and mixing performed at Northbridge Sound Studios by the now late John Vilani (RIP). The album was mastered at 301 Studios by Don Bartley.  2010‚Äìpresent  In 2010 the Chevelles undertook a World Tour commencing at the Big Day Out in Perth, and followed by a tour through the USA (including appearances at SXSW) and by performances in the UK, Spain and Brazil. In 2011 and again in 2014 The Chevelles undertook a 21st Anniversary Tour commencing at Southbound musical festival, and then proceeding to the U.S .(including appearances at SXSW) and other shows in the trans atlantic region of the USA and then over to Spain playing sold out shows across the country. The Chevelles continued to demo new material in their Fremantle garage studio for an upcoming release on Wicked Cool Records in 2018. New material sees them returning to their roots and writing material full of power pop riffing and 60's inspired harmonies.

In 1890 he was appointed sixth president of Howard University in Washington, D.C. Howard's Andrew Rankin Memorial Chapel was built during Jeremiah Rankin's tenure as president (1890‚Äì1903) and named after his brother. Rankin is best known as author of the hymns \\"God Be with You 'Til we Meet Again\\" and \\"Tell It to Jesus\\". In 1903 Rankin published a fictional journal of Esther Burr (Jonathan Edwards's daughter and mother of the third vice president of the United States, Aaron Burr). Rankin was born in Thornton, New Hampshire, and graduated from Middlebury College in 1848. After completing his seminary studies at Andover in 1854, he served as pastor of Presbyterian and Congregational churches in New York, Vermont, Lowell, Massachusetts, Charlestown, Massachusetts, Orange, New Jersey, and Washington, D.C. He was awarded a doctorate from Middlebury College in 1869. From 1870 on he was closely associated with Howard University, as trustee, professor of homiletics and pastoral theology, and president. He served twice as delegate to general conferences of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and once to the Congregational Union of England and Wales. In 1869 Rankin became pastor of Washington's First Congregational Church. This appointment followed a split in the church over the issue of race. Those who remained with the church felt that he was prepared to lead the church in a properly unbiased direction. While pastor of the First Congregational Church (1869‚Äì84), Rankin's sermons were popular with Vice President Woodrow Wilson and numerous members of the United States Congress. Two sermons were published and circulated throughout the country (\\"The Bible, the Security of American Institutions\\" and \\"The Divinity of the Ballot\\").

The original members were: Taft, Ralph Elmer Clarkson, Oliver Dennett Grover, Charles Francis Browne, Henry B.

The original members first lived in tents at the colony, later, after the association's constitution was written, charter and regular members were allowed to build summer homes. The group began their search for a summer reprieve from Chicago a few years before the site along the Rock River was chosen. Their first colony, at Bass Lake, Indiana, ended after a malaria outbreak.

Major works at Eagle's Nest Black Hawk Statue at Lowden State Park In the summer of 1843, more than 50 years before the colony occupied the land, Margaret Fuller made her only visit to Oregon, Illinois. Walking along the east bank of the Rock River during her visit, she noticed the natural spring at the base of the bluff. She dubbed the spring \\"Ganymede Spring\\", and later sat down beneath the Eagle's Nest Tree, and penned her famous poem \\"Ganymede to His Eagle\\". An island at the center of the Rock River across from the eventual colony was named Margaret Fuller Island in her honor. Southeast of the former location of Taft's studio is the 1905 sculpture The Funeral Procession. The piece was the collaborative work of six of Taft's students who had taken up residence at the colony for the summer. The assignment required each student to create a human figure but left the subject of the sculpture to their collective choice. The end result is a piece with six human figures carrying a casket on their shoulders.\\"Other structures \\", NIU Historical Buildings: Lorado Taft Field Campus Historical Significance, Northern Illinois University.

The natural spring, which originates in the limestone beneath Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, supplied the colony with water for cooking, drinking and for use in their swimming pools. One pool was at the base of the spring and the other was located where the present-day NIU parking lot is found. The original pool at the base of the spring can still be seen when the water level on the Rock River is low. Originally, from 1898-1902 water was transported up the hill by horse and wagon. By 1902 a large pump was installed, though it took two attempts, and a water tower dispensed water to the various buildings. Influence The Oregon Public Library's design was influenced by members of the colony. The art colony influenced and contributed to area culture, in part due to the requirements of their lease. Two of the charter members of the art colony were Chicago architects, Allen and Irving Pond, who designed the Oregon Public Library, a Carnegie library building, heavily influenced by the presence of the art colony.Schnell, pp. 52‚Äì53. It was the Ponds' association with the Eagle's Nest Art Colony that led them to design the library. Even before the library was built, members of the Eagle's Nest Art Colony were pushing for the new building to include a second-story art gallery. The building was constructed after an Andrew Carnegie grant approval, and its first use came in October 1908 by Leon A. Malkielski, a colony member, for an exhibition of 100 paintings.Behrens, p. 14. The library proper did not begin providing its services until 1909. Hamlin Garland, a 1921 Pulitzer Prize recipient for literature, spoke at the Oregon library while he was a member of the Eagle's Nest Colony. The second floor art gallery on the second floor of the library building was not formally dedicated until July 4, 1918. This marked the beginning of the library's permanent collection, which started with additions from members of the Eagle's Nest Colony. The Soldiers' Monument in Oregon, Illinois Taft is responsible for several works of sculpture within the nearby city of Oregon, and a number of pieces within the library art gallery are credited to members and associates of the art colony. The Soldiers' Monument is a Taft created sculpture that stands on the public square of the Old Ogle County Courthouse in Oregon.

The Fish Boys, or Dolphin Fountain, is another Taft work located in Oregon. The fountain consists of two boys kneeling on the edge of a pool of water, each holding a large fish. Water from the mouths of the fish pours into the shallow pool. The figures were originally cast in bronze and designed as part of the Fountain of the Great Lakes in Chicago.

Many field boundaries in the central region of England originated with the enclosure of the previous open fields in the 18th or 19th centuries. In a few instances, current field boundaries (particularly in the West Country) have been shown to have originated in the Bronze Age or Iron Age. With a few exceptions, however, the attempt to establish pre-Saxon boundaries has been \\"largely fruitless\\". Areas that were never formally enclosed might yet prove a more fruitful area of research. Hedgerow dating The presence of bluebells in a hedge is often an indicator of an early hedge. It has been proposed that boundary hedges can be dated by hedgerow dating. This involves counting the number of species in a 27-metre section of hedge. In its simplest form each separate species suggests an age of 100 years. A variety of additional complexities have been suggested, but results have been mixed and the technique remains controversial. Parish boundaries Parish boundaries are of particular interest to landscape historians, since they are often inherited from land holdings that date back to the middle Saxon period or earlier. The coincidence of another landscape feature with a parish boundary can be used to date that feature‚Äîfor example in the Time Team episode screened on 11 March 2007, a mill leat was determined to pre-date the Norman conquest because it coincided with a parish boundary. The boundaries of a few Anglo-Saxon estates were described in the boundary clauses of Anglo-Saxon Charters. These boundary clauses can sometimes be used to characterise the landscape at the time. In some cases, it has been possible to show that the boundaries of these Anglo-Saxon estates correspond to the boundaries of the subsequent parish. Parish boundaries are shown on the old \\"1 inch\\" Ordnance Survey maps, although these are the boundaries of the civil parish which may be different. Parish boundaries are not shown on the modern \\"Landranger\\" maps. Tithe maps, from the early 19th century, usually show the parish boundary at the time they were drawn.  Beating the Bounds  A long tradition exists in England of 'Beating the Bounds', either an annual or seven-yearly event,OLIVER, PAUL. \\"\\"Beating the Bounds\\": Switching Boundaries over Five Millennia.\\" Traditional Dwellings and Settlements Review 15, no. 2 (2004): 7-17. http://www.jstor.org/stable/41758040. wherein parishioners would walk the bounds of the parish. The event was deliberately organised to make it as memorable as possible, and to hand-down an intergenerational memory of the precise boundaries. For civil parishes, the ceremony may have begun with the Poor Law Act of 1601, or much older for the 'Processioning' of churches, dating from Anglo-Saxon times.Tratman, W. S. \\"Beating the Bounds.\\" Folklore 42, no. 3 (1931): 317-23. http://www.jstor.org/stable/1255804. Older parishioners, and local officials, would walk the route as accurately as possible, pointing out all the various landmarks and boundary markers along the way, both natural and deliberate artefacts. A distinctive feature of these perambulations was the performance of peculiar rituals with the youngest walkers, in order to make particular points memorable. These could include being passed through the window of a local pub, rather than walking through the door, being carried across a stream, or being hung upside down by the ankles and their head 'bumped' on the grass. Such processions fell from practice in the Modernism of the mid-20th century,Astbury, B. E. \\"BEATING THE BOUNDS.\\" Charity Organisation Quarterly, NEW SERIES, 9, no. 4 (1935): 197-99. http://www.jstor.org/stable/44372929. but there was some interest in their revival from the 1960s.Darian‚ÄìSmith, Eve. \\"Beating the Bounds: Law, Identity and Territory in the New Europe.\\" Political and Legal Anthropology Review 18, no. 1 (1995): 63-73. www.jstor.org/stable/24497965.

Deer park boundaries The boundaries of medieval deer parks are often marked by pronounced earthworksRichard Muir, Be Your Own Landscape Detective (Sutton Publishing, 2007, p245) and for early parks, they can coincide with parish boundaries. Former boundaries Boundaries that have fallen out of use, may still be traceable by using geophysics or as a result of earthworks (lumps and bumps) or cropmarks. Cropmarks and earthworks are often visible in aerial photographs. Earthworks are more easily seen on photographs taken when the sun is low in the sky and as a result, shadows are more pronounced. They can also become more easily seen when the ground has a slight dusting of snow.

The term probably relates to the raising of sheep for wool, which was common in rural Quebec of the 1700s.) Some definitions are more specific, indicating those whose families arrived in Canada during a specific period, with a lineage that is 100 per cent derived from New France (1534 to 1763) settlers. Terms with a similar meaning include de souche (of the base of the tree, or root) and old stock as in \\"Old Stock Canadians\\". Many French- Canadians are able to trace their ancestry back to the original settlers from France‚Äîa number are descended from mixed marriages between the French, Scottish and Irish settlers. Unions sharing Roman Catholic faith were approved by the Roman Catholic Church in Quebec. Many English people in the region, especially after 1763 when Quebec was ceded to Britain, were ultimately assimilated into the francophone culture. Context Sister Marguerite Bourgeoys, Congregation of Notre Dame, Montreal The genealogy of the pure laine ‚Äì dating back to original settlers of New France in the seventeenth century ‚Äì has been the subject of detailed research. Prior to 1663 the Soci√©t√© Notre-Dame de Montr√©al recruited women to come to Montreal, then known as Ville-Marie. King Louis XIV ‚Äì following the advice of Jean Talon, Intendant of New France ‚Äì sponsored about 800 female immigrants the King's Daughters or les filles du Roi to increase the number of marriages and therefore the population of New France. The Sisters of Notre-Dame facilitated their settling in Ville- Marie. In his 1992 PhD dissertation Yves Landry listed 770 of the approximately 800 by name. From the seventeenth century into the twentieth century, French Canadians lived in relative geographic and linguistic isolation. Their \\"settlements, internal migrations, and natural population increase\\" were well-documented with \\"3 million records covering the whole province of Quebec over four centuries.\\" By 2015 \\"extended pedigrees of up to 17 generations\\" were constructed from \\"a sample of present-day individuals.\\" In an article published in 2001 in the Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics, McGill University professor Charles R. Scriver, observed there is \\"important evidence of social transmission of demographic behavior that contributed to effective family size and population structure.\\" Founder populations, like the descendants of the early French immigrants, have an important role in the study of genetic diseases. With an unusually high prevalence of genetic disorders in the subpopulations of Quebec, they became the subject of human genetics research. Clusters of hereditary disorders in eastern Quebec in the twentieth century were traced to immigrants from Perche, France who arrived in the seventeenth century. Catholic priest and historian Lionel Groulx (1878‚Äì1967) was the key figure behind the rise of Quebec nationalism which stressed \\"territoriality and the use of the Quebec state\\" in the first half of the twentieth century. Jean √âthier-Blais claimed that among Quebec nationalist intellectuals the twentieth century was Groulx century ‚Äî \\"le si√®cle de l'abb√© Groulx.\\" Groulx's best-known novel L'Appel de la race, challenged the narrative surrounding French-English relationships in Quebec and revisited the history of Canada from a French Canadian perspective. In the 1920s following the publication of this novel, French Canadian nationalism \\"espoused the thought of Lionel Groulx\\", retained Catholicism and abandoned Henri Bourassa's pan-Canadian perspective. In 1998, Xavier G√©linas, then- Curator at the Canadian Museum of History (French: Mus√©e canadien de l‚Äôhistoire), then known as the Canadian Museum of Civilization, presented a talk at a conference on Quebec history in which he argued that even in the 1980s Groulxism remained as an important ideology among Quebecois. Groulx's work is considered to be a contributing factor to the Quiet Revolution in 1960 even though the Quebec nationalism of the r√©volution tranquille was \\"a-religious and ethnically pluralistic.\\" Expressions such as Canadiens fran√ßais pure laine, Qu√©becois pure laine or r√©volution tranquille became powerful evocative symbols charged with ideology and identity. G√©linas challenged the thesis of French Canadian historian Esther Delisle whom he described as pure laine. Delisle's controversial PhD political science dissertation and the book entitled The Traitor and the Jew based on her thesis, argued that Groulx and the newspaper Le Devoir were antisemitic and supported fascism. History The use of pure laine was brought to the forefront following its controversial usage in the front-page article by Jan Wong in Canada's nationally distributed newspaper, The Globe and Mail, on September 16, 2006, three days after the shooting at Dawson College in Montreal. In her article entitled \\"Get under the desk,\\" Wong argued that the frequent and historic use of the term pure laine revealed a uniquely Qu√©b√©cois brand of racism. \\"Elsewhere, to talk of racial 'purity' is repugnant. Not in Quebec.\\" Furthermore, she suggested that the school shootings might have been related to the fact that the perpetrators were not old-stock French Qu√©b√©cois and they had been alienated by a Quebec society concerned with \\"racial purity.\\" Wong's accusations were denounced by National Post journalist, Barbara Kay, then-Premier Jean Charest and the Soci√©t√© Saint-Jean-Baptiste (SSJB). SSJB President Jean Dorion declared \\"There is no obsession for racial purity in Quebec, definitely not. ... The expression 'pure laine' is absolutely obsolete.\\" However the term was still frequently used in both English and French media.Katia Gagnon : La commission Bouchard-Taylor... √† l'envers  Actualit√©s  Cyberpresse And in 2007, the Taylor-Bouchard Commission included the recommendation that the use of the expression \\"Qu√©b√©cois de souche\\" be ended and replaced with the term \\"Quebecers of French-Canadian origin.\\" The Commission investigated reasonable accommodation of immigrants into Quebec society. According to David Austin, author of Fear of a Black Nation (2013), which was based on Austin's two decades of inquiry including interviews and international archival research, Similar terms in English=Old-stock Canadians The English-Canadian equivalent to \\"pure laine\\" is \\"old stock\\", referring to the descendants of those original settlers of British Canada and French Canada who immigrated in the 17th and 18th centuries. For example, Liberal MP St√©phane Dion used the term in 2014 in the following manner: \\"If I'm fishing with a friend on a magnificent lake in the Laurentians ... and I see a small boat in the distance ... usually it's two middle-aged old-stock French-Canadians or English-Canadians.\\" Unamerican According to Gilman and Milton, the appellation \\"Unamerican\\" favoured by US Senator Joseph McCarthy is a version of the terms pure wool, true blue, dyed- in-the-wool, and old stock.

It is based on a power electronics voltage- source converter and can act as either a source or sink of reactive AC power to an electricity network. If connected to a source of power it can also provide active AC power. It is a member of the FACTS family of devices. It is inherently modular and electable. These compensators are also usable to reduce voltage fluctuations. Uses Usually a STATCOM is installed to support electricity networks that have a poor power factor and often poor voltage regulation. There are however, other uses, the most common use is for voltage stability. Construction and operation A STATCOM is a voltage source converter (VSC)-based device, with the voltage source behind a reactor. The voltage source is created from a DC capacitor and therefore a STATCOM has very little active power capability. However, its active power capability can be increased if a suitable energy storage device is connected across the DC capacitor. The reactive power at the terminals of the STATCOM depends on the amplitude of the voltage source. For example, if the terminal voltage of the VSC is higher than the AC voltage at the point of connection, the STATCOM generates reactive current; conversely, when the amplitude of the voltage source is lower than the AC voltage, it absorbs reactive power. The response time of a STATCOM is shorter than that of a static VAR compensator (SVC), mainly due to the fast switching times provided by the IGBTs of the voltage source converter. The STATCOM also provides better reactive power support at low AC voltages than an SVC, since the reactive power from a STATCOM decreases linearly with the AC voltage (as the current can be maintained at the rated value even down to low AC voltage). Similar devices A static var compensator can also be used for voltage stability. However, a STATCOM has better characteristics than an SVC. When the system voltage drops sufficiently to force the STATCOM output current to its ceiling, its maximum reactive output current will not be affected by the voltage magnitude. Therefore, it exhibits constant current characteristics when the voltage is low under the limit. In contrast the SVC's reactive output is proportional to the square of the voltage magnitude. This makes the provided reactive power decrease rapidly when voltage decreases, thus reducing its stability. In addition, the speed of response of a STATCOM is faster than that of an SVC and the harmonic emission is lower, however STATCOMs typically exhibit higher losses and may be more expensive than SVCs, so the (older) SVC technology is still widespread.

He confessed to celebrating every year the birthdays of three heroes: Pasteur, Mozart and Paul Val√©ry, all of whom suggest admiration for the life of the mind lived at its highest pitch ‚Äî a concern for science and its social uses, and a love of art that is elegant, cerebral and orderly.\\" That is one part of Bowers. Another aspect is highlighted by Thom Gunn on the back of Bowers's Collected Poems: \\"Bowers started with youthful stoicism, but the feeling is now governed by an increasing acceptance of the physical world.\\" That 'physical world' encompasses sex and love which are refracted through his restrained and lapidary lines. The effect of this contrast is striking: at once balanced and engaged; detached but acutely aware of sensual satisfactions. Bowers' style owes much to the artistic ethos of Yvor Winters, under whom Bowers studied at Stanford, but his achievement far surpasses that of his mentor, and his other students, such as J. V. Cunningham. He often wrote in rhyme, but also produced some of the finest blank verse in the English language. He wrote very little (his Collected Poems weighs in at 168 pages), due no doubt to the careful consideration behind every single line. But that care never forecloses on the wilder aspects of human existence‚Äîthe needs, joys and violence. Bowers retired in 1991 and died in San Francisco in 2000.

Biography G√ºssfeldt was born in Berlin, where he also died almost 80 years later. After attending the Coll√®ge Fran√ßais in his home city, he studied natural sciences and mathematics in Heidelberg (where he joined the Vandalia student corps), from 1859 to 1865, and then in Berlin, Gie√üen and Bonn. When the first expedition was sent out by the German African Society () in 1872, he was chosen its leader. The expedition sailed to the coast of the Kingdom of Loango, but was shipwrecked near Freetown on 14 January 1873 and lost all its stores and equipment. Although G√ºssfeldt succeeded in establishing a station on the coast, he was unable to penetrate into the interior, and returned to Germany in the summer of 1875. In 1876 he visited Egypt and the Arabian Desert (with Georg August Schweinfurth). He made several first ascents in the Alps, including Piz Scerscen with Hans Grass and Caspar Capat on 13 September 1877 via the north-west spur (the Eisnase route). On 12 August 1878, Hans Grass, Johann Gross and he first climbed the Biancograt north ridge of Piz Bernina. He made winter ascents of the Grandes Jorasses and the Gran Paradiso, as well as putting up several new routes on Mont Blanc, including the Peuterey ridge on 15‚Äì19 August 1893 (with Emile Rey, Christian Klucker and C√©sar Ollier). Pointe G√ºssfeldt (4,112 m), the highest summit on the Aiguille Blanche de Peuterey is named after him, as is the G√ºssfeldtsattel, the col between Piz Scerscen and Piz Roseg also known as the Porta da Roseg. This steep ice slope was first climbed by G√ºssfeldt with guides Hans Grass, Peter Jenny and Caspar Capat on 13 September 1872. G√ºssfeldt explored a portion of the Andes, where he discovered a number of glaciers in latitude 34¬∞ 30' S. He also ascended to the top of the volcano of Maipo. In 1883 he made the first attempt on Aconcagua by a European. Bribing porters with the story that there was treasure on the mountain, he approached Aconcagua via the Rio Volcan, making two attempts on the peak by the north-west ridge and reaching an altitude of 6,500 metres. The route that he prospected is now the normal route up the mountain. Between 1889 until 1914 G√ºssfeldt was invited by the German Emperor Wilhelm II to join him for his annual summer cruise in the North Sea, which G√ºssfeldt was given the responsibility of planning as well. The emperor was fond of G√ºssfeldt and wrote about him in his memoirs.Wilhelm II, Aus meinem Leben 1859‚Äì1888, 1927, p. 238  Works  * In den Hochalpen.

It is located in the Wallowa‚ÄìWhitman National Forest and the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area, upriver from the Snake's confluence with the Imnaha River. In May 1887, it was the location of the Hells Canyon Massacre, where thirty-four Chinese goldminers were ambushed and murdered. History Chinese Massacre Cove is the location of one of the most brutal injustices against the Chinese immigrants in the Northwest United States. In May 1887, thirty-four Chinese goldminers were ambushed by horse thieves and schoolboys from Wallowa County. The crime was initially discovered through the discovery of the dead bodies near Lewiston, Idaho with little accuracy of crime specifics. The crime and its details were found later under the direction of Lee Loi of the Sam Yup Company of San Francisco which was a major employer of Chinese miners who sought the help of Judge Joseph K. Vincent to investigate the situation. Vincent reported his findings to the Chinese consulate in San Francisco which then sought the help from the U.S. State Department. This information included the bodies of the deceased Chinese immigrants, the vague background of the deceased Chinese immigrants, and information on the gang of killers. A year after the murders a trial in Enterprise, Oregon was held in a grand jury on September 1, 1888 that accused six men and boys of the nine total for murder. However, none of them were punished for the crime. Over time, the massacre was gradually forgotten. In 2005, The location was officially renamed from the \\"Deep Creek Massacre site\\" to \\"Chinese Massacre Cove\\" by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names to commemorate the crime. Each year thereafter, conferences and healing ceremonies were held at the site by local representatives in remembrance the murders of the Chinese immigrants victimized in the attack. In June 2012, a permanent granite memorial was established on the site to recognize these deceased Chinese miners. Written on the memorial in English, Chinese, and Nez Perce, the language of earlier inhabitants of the area are, \\"Chinese Massacre Cove ‚Äî Site of the 1887 massacre of as many as 34 Chinese gold miners ‚Äî No one was held accountable.\\" These words stand to represent the silently oppressed population of Chinese, Native Americans, and other minority races in the area who experienced insufficient justice regarding criminal victimization and injustice against their races.

Built and opened to customers in 1895, it is the only 19th-century hotel still in operation in Brussels today. The hotel has 251 rooms and 22 spacious suites. History In 1890, Prosper and Edouard Wielemans, two brothers with a brewing company, opened the Caf√© Metropole as a place in the city to sell their beer. The caf√© was a huge success and the Weilemans-Ceuppens family then purchased the building next-door, a former bank, which would become the Hotel Metropole, inaugurated in 1895. Today, the hotel's reception desk is easily recognisable as the desk of the former bank, a significant historical and heritage glimpse of the past. The Hotel Metropole in the 1920s The brothers commissioned French architect Alban Chambon to be the chief designer of the hotel. Today, Chambon's design is still a prominent feature of the heritage hotel, which is considered an important historical landmark in the city. Not only was the Hotel Metropole one of the first luxury hotels, it was also the first to have electricity and central heating, and is now the only existing 19th century hotel in Brussels. In fact, many heritage tours of Brussels visit the Hotel Metropole to look upon its facades and design. The Hotel Metropole is famous for having hosted the first Solvay Conference in 1911. Moreover, it is the birthplace of the Black Russian cocktail, which was created in 1949 by barman Gustave Tops for the United States ambassador to Luxembourg, Perle Mesta. Since 2002, the hotel's facade and ground floor, as well as the Belle √âpoque lift and ironwork, have been protected by the Monuments and Sites Directorate of the Brussels-Capital Region. As of 29 June 2015, the hotel stands at the edge of a large pedestrian zone in the centre of Brussels. It however remains directly accessible via / and /. It is also served by De Brouck√®re metro station. Building The hotel's reception, lobby, and lounge are overtly ornate with Corinthian columns, rich furnishings, gilded details, and chandeliers. Similarly, the hotel's 11 meetings and conference rooms are decorated in a Renaissance style. The hotel offers eating possibilities in Le Caf√© M√©tropole brasserie and Le Jardin Indien breakfast room. It also has a bar, Le 31, with a late 19-century style decor, as well as a fitness room.

In addition to the present-day Swedish Lapland, it also covered V√§sterbotten, J√§mtland and H√§rjedalen, as well as the Finnish Lapland. As a name, it is related to Finnmark, an old Norwegian name for the Sami area. \\"Finn\\" and \\"Lapp\\" are mutually exchangeable old names for the Sami people, although the latter is sometimes deemed offensive. Already in the Middle Ages, Lappmarken consisted of \\"lappmarks\\" whose Sami people were loosely governed either by the crown or birkarls. The purpose of lappmarks was largely colonial in nature. Originally, each consisted of a river valley with its surrounding areas from the Gulf of Bothnia up to the fjelds. The first lappmarks were: * Lycksele lappmark (Ume River valley) * √Ösele lappmark (√Öngerman River valley) * Tornio lappmark (Tornio River valley) * Pite√• lappmark (Pite River valley) * Lule√• lappmark (Lule River valley) * Kemi lappmark (Kemi River valley, separated from Tornio lappmark in 1633) State took Lappmarken to tighter control in the 17th century with the downfall of the birkarl system and establishment of the state controlled towns. County of Norrland was established in 1634 for the state administration on the region while the parallel concept of Lappmarken continued to regulate the Sami people and their relations with the settlers. Lappmark Proclamation in 1673 stipulated that anybody who settled in the Sami region would be granted tax exemption for 15 years and would not have to serve as a soldier in any war. Since Sami people contributed significantly to the public treasury, the settlers were allowed only to colonise land that was considered \\"unused\\". The proclamation was renewed in 1695. Sami people heavily protested against it, but in vain. Sami people were de facto forced to leave large areas and retreat northwards. Individual taxes were also removed from the Sami people, and their taxes were put on the Sami villages. This system was in place until 1928. Lappmark Regulation in 1749 ordered settlers to stay away from hunting and devote themselves to farming and the keeping of livestock. The colonial rights were now also opened up to the Sami people. Two years later, V√§sterbotten was separated from Lappmarken and its inhabitants were forbidden to hunt or fish in the Sami area. By now the then Lappmarken was also known as Lappland. In the 19th century, with the loss of Kemi and Tornio lappmarks along with Finland in 1809 and further retreat of the Sami people, Lappmarken gradually lost its purpose. The remaining area was incorporated to the general state administration in the early 20th century. However, the name \\"lappmark\\" still bears a legal meaning and is widely used in the Sami related legislation in Sweden.

Biography Babajanian was born in Yerevan, Armenia. By age 5, his musical talent was apparent, and the composer Aram Khachaturian suggested that the boy be given proper music training. Two years later, in 1928, Babajanian entered the Yerevan State Musical Conservatory. In 1938, he continued his studies in Moscow with Vissarion Shebalin. He later returned to Yerevan, where from 1950 to 1956 he taught at the conservatory. In 1952 he wrote the Piano Trio in F-sharp minor. It received immediate acclaim and was regarded as a masterpiece from the time of its premiere. Subsequently, he undertook concert tours throughout the Soviet Union and Europe. In 1971, he was named a People's Artist of the Soviet Union. Babajanian wrote in various musical genres, including many popular songs in collaboration with leading poets such as Yevgeny Yevtushenko and Robert Rozhdestvensky. Much of his music is rooted in Armenian folk music and folklore, which he generally uses in the virtuosic style of Rachmaninov and Khachaturian.

Timing A rate contract is usually attempted when a global sourcing effort is not feasible, due to financial or operational constraints. A rate contract is also typically established in inputs where the number of suppliers is large (where it is not a monopoly or an oligopoly). Level Rate contracts can be arranged at various levels by a large firm - in specific geography markets or at a national level or at a global level (if suppliers exist at differing scales) and in specific sub-categories, or in a range of sub-categories, or for a category, or for a related categories. The rate contract can also be established for a year or for multiple-years. The level of the rate contract agreed depends on: # The level of standardization of the input # The predictability of procurement spend # The nature of the supplier market # The pricing power of the procurer as against the supplier. Process of setup The process of setting up a rate contract in a category follows a set of standard steps:- # Procurement spend analysis: Identification of cumulative spend, identification of key suppliers and their share of business, identification of average price of procurement, spend growth projections # Market analysis: Study of the nature of the market, exhaustive identification of suppliers and their capabilities, study of supplier cost structures. One of the primary objectives of this step is the identification and introduction of new suppliers # Supplier Interactions: Selection of a fit-list of suppliers, invitation to suppliers for discussions, supplier discussions and interactions, RFQ to selected suppliers # Receipt of Quotes from suppliers # Selection of a fit list of suppliers # Agreement on the points of the rate contract and finalization of the rate contract Post the setup of a rate contract, a definitive monitoring mechanism must be set up. Such a monitoring mechanism needs to be done centrally by the organization and involves - monitoring of offtake by supplier, monitoring of non-RC offtake and monitoring of supplies and periodic quality audits. Without the setup of a monitoring mechanism, much of the effectiveness and purpose for a setup might be lost. Special Types A frame agreement is a special type of rate agreement entered with a set of suppliers, with a specific subset (may be just one) chosen as preferred. Frame agreements possess similar clauses as standard rate agreements with a few additional (optional) points such as * decreasing prices over time * quality control obligations for the supplier * minimum or maximum offtakes during the validity period * provisions for vendor-managed inventory The UNHCR procures a large percentage of its requirements under frame agreements.

An ethnic German from the Sudetenland, he is also known in Czech as Jan Josef Abert. Life and career Abert was born in Kochowitz near Gastorf, Bohemia, now Kochovice, Ho≈°tka, Czech Republic. He studied double bass at the Prague Conservatory with Josef Hrabƒõ and also received lessons in theory from Johann Friedrich Kittl and August Wilhelm Ambros. In 1853, Peter Josef von Lindpaintner selected him as a double bassist for the Court Orchestra at Stuttgart, the royal capital of W√ºrttemberg. He became the Court Kapellmeister in 1867 and remained in this office, previously occupied by Lindpainter, Friedrich Wilhelm K√ºcken, and Karl Anton Eckerts, until 1888. Abert composed chamber music and lieder, as well as several successful operas. Of his seven symphonies, the Fr√ºhlingssinfonie (Spring Symphony, No. 7) in C, the program symphony Columbus (No. 4), and the Symphony in C minor (No. 2) are generally considered to be the best. The W√ºrttembergische Landesbibliothek in Stuttgart and the Deutsches Literaturarchiv Marbach currently share responsibility for the preservation of his manuscripts and other personal papers. Abert's son, Hermann, became a noted music historian. Recordings Little of Abert's oeuvre has so far been recorded. However, there are recordings available of the String Quartet in A (together with a collection of songs), the opera Ekkehard, the 4th Symphony (Columbus), and the concertante works for double bass and orchestra.

Magnified 400 times. Lyme disease, or borreliosis, is caused by spirochetal bacteria from the genus Borrelia, which has 52 known species. Three main species (Borrelia garinii, Borrelia afzelii, and Borrelia burgdorferi s.s.) are the main causative agents of the disease in humans, while a number of others have been implicated as possibly pathogenic. Borrelia species in the species complex known to cause Lyme disease are collectively called Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) not to be confused with the single species in that complex Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto which is responsible for all cases of Lyme disease in North America. Borrelia are microaerophilic and slow-growing‚Äîthe primary reason for the long delays when diagnosing Lyme disease‚Äîand have been found to have greater strain diversity than previously estimated. The strains differ in clinical symptoms and/or presentation as well as geographic distribution. Except for Borrelia recurrentis (which causes louse-borne relapsing fever and is transmitted by the human body louse), all known species are believed to be transmitted by ticks. Species and strains Until recently, only three genospecies were thought to cause Lyme disease (borreliosis): B. burgdorferi s.s. (the predominant species in North America, but also present in Europe); B. afzelii; and B. garinii (both predominant in Eurasia). Thirteen distinct genomic classifications of Lyme disease bacteria have been identified worldwide. These include but are not limited to B. burgdorferi s.s., B. afzelii, B. garinii, B. valaisana, B. lusitaniae, B. andersoni, 25015, DN127, CA55, 25015, HK501, B. miyamotoi, and B. japonica. Many of these genomic groups are country or continent specific. For example, without migration, B. japonica is only prevalent in the eastern hemisphere. The genomic variations have direct implications on the clinical symptoms of tick-borne Lyme disease. For example, B. burgdorferi s.s.‚Äôs tick-borne Lyme disease may manifest with arthritis-like symptoms. In contrast, B. garinii‚Äôs tick-borne Lyme disease may cause an infection of the central nervous system. Emerging genospecies * B. valaisiana was identified as a genomic species from Strain VS116, and named B. valaisiana in 1997. It was later detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in human cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) in Greece. B. valaisiana has been isolated throughout Europe, as well as east Asia. Newly discovered genospecies have also been found to cause disease in humans: *B. lusitaniae in Europe (especially Portugal), North Africa and Asia. *B. bissettii in the United States and Europe. *B. spielmanii in Europe. Additional B. burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies suspected of causing illness, but not confirmed by culture, include B. japonica, B. tanukii and B. turdae (Japan); B. sinica (China); and B. andersonii (U.S.). Some of these species are carried by ticks not currently recognized as carriers of Lyme disease. The B. miyamotoi spirochete, related to the relapsing fever group of spirochetes, is also suspected of causing illness in Japan. Spirochetes similar to B. miyamotoi have recently been found in both Ixodes ricinus ticks in Sweden and I. scapularis ticks in the U.S. Epidemiology Lyme disease is most endemic in Northern Hemisphere temperate regions, but sporadic cases have been described in other areas of the world. The number of reported cases of the borreliosis have been increasing, as are endemic regions in North America. Of cases reported to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the rate of Lyme disease infection is 7.9 cases for every 100,000 persons. In the 10 states where Lyme disease is most common, the average was 31.6 cases per 100,000 persons for 2005. Although Lyme disease has now been reported in 49 of 50 states in the U.S (all but Hawaii), about 99% of all reported cases are confined to just five geographic areas (New England, Mid-Atlantic, East-North Central, South Atlantic, and West North-Central). In Europe, cases of B. burgdorferi s.l.-infected ticks are found predominantly in Norway, the Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy, Slovenia, and Poland, but have been isolated in almost every country on the continent. Lyme disease statistics for Europe can be found at Eurosurveillance website. Borrelia burgdorferi s.l.-infested ticks are being found more frequently in Japan, as well as in northwest China and far eastern Russia. Borrelia has been isolated in Mongolia as well. In South America, tick-borne disease recognition and occurrence is rising. Ticks carrying B. burgdorferi s.l., as well as canine and human tick-borne diseases, have been reported widely in Brazil, but the subspecies of Borrelia has not yet been defined. The first reported case of Lyme disease in Brazil was made in 1993 in Sao Paulo. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto antigens in patients have been identified in Colombia and in Bolivia. B. burgorferi has been reported in Bay Islands of Honduras. In Northern Africa, B. burgdorferi s.s. has been identified in Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, and Tunisia. In western and sub-Saharan Africa, tick-borne relapsing fever has been recognized for over a century, since it was first isolated by the British physicians Joseph Everett Dutton and John Lancelot Todd in 1905. Borrelia in the manifestation of Lyme disease in this region is presently unknown, but evidence indicates the disease may occur in humans in sub-Saharan Africa. The abundance of hosts and tick vectors would favor the establishment of the infection in Africa. In East Africa two cases of Lyme disease have been reported in Kenya. In Australia, no definitive evidence exists for the existence of B. burgdorferi or for any other tick- borne spirochete that may be responsible for a local syndrome being reported as Lyme disease. Cases of neuroborreliosis have been documented in Australia, but are often ascribed to travel to other continents. The existence of Lyme disease in Australia is controversial. Lifecycle The lifecycle of B. burgdorferi is complex, requiring ticks, and species that are competent reservoirs, often small rodents. Mice are the primary reservoir for the bacteria. Hard ticks have a variety of life histories with respect to optimizing their chance of contact with an appropriate host to ensure survival. The life stages of soft ticks are not readily distinguishable. The first stage to hatch from the egg, a six-legged larva, takes a blood meal from a host, and molts to the first nymphal stage. Unlike hard ticks, many soft ticks go through multiple nymphal stages, gradually increasing in size until the final molt to the adult stage. The lifecycle of the black-legged tick, commonly called the deer tick (Ixodes scapularis) comprises three growth stages: the larva, nymph and adult. Whereas B. burgdorferi is most associated with deer ticks and the white-footed mouse, B. afzelli is most frequently detected in rodent-feeding vector ticks, and B. garinii and B. valaisiana appear to be associated with birds. Both rodents and birds are competent reservoir hosts for B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. The resistance of a genospecies of Lyme disease spirochetes to the bacteriolytic activities of the alternative immune complement system of various host species may determine its reservoir host association. Genomic characteristics The genome of B. burgdorferi (B31 strain) was the third microbial genome ever to be sequenced, following the sequencing of both H. influenzae and M. genitalium in 1995, and its chromosome contains 910,725 base pairs and 853 genes. One of the most striking features of B. burgdorferi as compared with other bacteria is its unusual genome, which is far more complex than that of its spirochetal cousin Treponema pallidum, the agent of syphilis. In addition to a linear chromosome, the genome of B. burgdorferi strain B31 includes 21 plasmids (12 linear and 9 circular) ‚Äì by far the largest number of plasmids found in any known bacterium. Genetic exchange, including plasmid transfers, contributes to the pathogenicity of the organism. Long-term culture of B. burgdorferi results in a loss of some plasmids and changes in expressed protein profiles. Associated with the loss of plasmids is a loss in the ability of the organism to infect laboratory animals, suggesting the plasmids encode key genes involved in virulence. Chemical analysis of the external membrane of B. burgdorferi revealed the presence of 46% proteins, 51% lipids and 3% carbohydrates. Structure and growth B. burgdorferi is a highly specialized, motile, two- membrane, flat-waved spirochete, ranging from about 9 to 32 Œºm in length. Because of its double-membrane envelope, it is often mistakenly described as Gram negative, though it stains weakly in Gram stain. The bacterial membranes in at least the B31, NL303 and N40 strains of B. burgdorferi do not contain lipopolysaccharide, which is extremely atypical for Gram negative bacteria; instead, the membranes contain glycolipids. However, the membranes in the B31 strain have been found to contain a lipopolysaccharide-like component. B. burgdorferi is a microaerophilic organism, requiring little oxygen to survive. Unlike most bacteria, B. burgdorferi does not use iron, hence avoiding the difficulty of acquiring iron during infection. It lives primarily as an extracellular pathogen. Like other spirochetes, such as Treponema pallidum (the agent of syphilis), B. burgdorferi has an axial filament composed of flagella that run lengthways between its cell wall and outer membrane. This structure allows the spirochete to move efficiently in corkscrew fashion through viscous media, such as connective tissue. B. burgdorferi is very slow growing, with a doubling time of 12‚Äì18 hours (in contrast to pathogens such as Streptococcus and Staphylococcus, which have a doubling time of 20‚Äì30 minutes). Outer surface proteins The outer membrane of B. burgdorferi is composed of various unique outer surface proteins (Osp) that have been characterized (OspA through OspF). The Osp proteins are lipoproteins anchored by N-terminally attached fatty acid molecules to the membrane. They are presumed to play a role in virulence, transmission, or survival in the tick. OspA, OspB, and OspD are expressed by B. burgdorferi residing in the gut of unfed ticks, suggesting they promote the persistence of the spirochete in ticks between blood meals. During transmission to the mammalian host, when the nymphal tick begins to feed and the spirochetes in the midgut begin to multiply rapidly, most spirochetes cease expressing OspA on their surfaces. Simultaneous with the disappearance of OspA, the spirochete population in the midgut begins to express an OspC and migrates to the salivary gland. Upregulation of OspC begins during the first day of feeding and peaks 48 hours after attachment. The OspA and OspB genes encode the major outer membrane proteins of B. burgdorferi. The two Osp proteins show a high degree of sequence similarity, indicating a recent duplication event. Virtually all spirochetes in the midgut of an unfed nymph tick express OspA. OspA promotes the attachment of B. burgdorferi to the tick protein TROSPA, present on tick gut epithelial cells. OspB also has an essential role in the adherence of B. burgdorferi to the tick gut. Although OspD has been shown to bind to tick gut extracts in vitro, as well as OspA and OspB, it is not essential for the attachment and colonization of the tick gut, and it is not required for human infections. OspC is a strong antigen; detection of its presence by the host organism stimulates an immune response. While each individual bacterial cell contains just one copy of the ospC gene, the gene sequence of ospC among different strains within each of the three major Lyme disease species is highly variable. OspC plays an essential role during the early stage of mammalian infection. In infected ticks feeding on a mammalian host, OspC may also be necessary to allow B. burgdorferi to invade and attach to the salivary gland after leaving the gut, although not all studies agree on such a role for the protein. OspC attaches to the tick salivary protein Salp15, which protects the spirochete from complement and impairs the function of dendritic cells. OspE and OspF were initially identified in B. burgdorferi strain N40. The ospE and ospF genes are structurally arranged in tandem as one transcriptional unit under the control of a common promoter. Individual strains of B. burgdorferi carry multiple related copies of the ospEF locus, which are now collectively referred to as Erp (Osp'E'/F-like 'r'elated 'p'rotein) genes. In B. burgdoreri strains B31 and 297, most of the Erp loci occupy the same position on the multiple copies of the cp32 plasmid present in these strains. Each locus consists of one or two Erp genes. When two genes are present, they are transcribed as one operon, although in some cases, an internal promoter in the first gene may also transcribe the second gene. The presence of multiple Erp proteins was proposed to be important in allowing B. burgdorferi to evade killing by the alternative complement pathway of a broad range of potential animal hosts, as individual Erp proteins exhibited different binding patterns to the complement regulator factor H from different animals. However, the presence of factor H was recently demonstrated to not be necessary to enable B. burgdorferi to infect mice, suggesting the Erp proteins have an additional function. Mechanisms of persistence B. burgdorferi is susceptible to a number of antibiotics in humans. However, untreated B. burgdorferi may persist in humans for months or years. In North America and Europe, Lyme arthritis may persist, while Europe also includes a persistent skin condition called acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. *Antigenic variation and gene expression Like the Borrelia that causes relapsing fever, B. burgdorferi has the ability to vary its surface proteins in response to immune attack. This ability is related to the genomic complexity of B. burgdorferi, and is another way B. burgdorferi evades the immune system to establish a chronic infection.

This is due to different methods of calculating the centre, and whether surrounding islands are included. In 2002, the Ordnance Survey calculated the centre using a mathematical centre of gravity method. This is the mathematical equivalent of calculating the point at which a cardboard cut-out of Scotland could be perfectly balanced on the tip of a pin. It becomes complicated when the islands are included so one simplification is just to ignore them. The centre point including islands was found to be at (). This is on a hillside near Loch Garry, between Dalwhinnie and Blair Atholl and close to the A9 road and the railway line. Nearby, it is claimed that the centre lies a few miles from the village of Newtonmore, Badenoch. It is marked by a stone set into a wall.http://www.newtonmore.com/our-community/centre-of-scotland.html Ordnance Survey Plaques Eastern Slopes of Dun Coillich in Glengoulandie, east of Schiehallion The Ordnance Survey calculated that the centre of Mainland Scotland is at (). The point is 5 km east of the mountain of Schiehallion, which is sometimes claimed to be at the centre of Scotland. Another cruder method is to take the intersection between the line of latitude midway between the most northerly and southerly points on the Scottish mainland, and the line of longitude midway between the most easterly and westerly points. In the days when Corrachadh M√≤r in Ardnamurchan was undisputedly the most westerly point, this also produced 56 degrees 39 minutes N, 4 degrees 0 minutes W, very near the summit of Schiehallion. However the construction of the Skye Bridge, arguably turning Skye into part of the Scottish mainland, may have upset some of these calculations. Faskally Cottages Megalithic Centre Less credible candidates for the centre of Scotland also exist. The Society of Antiquaries of Scotland in 1908 suggested the megalithic Faskally Cottages Standing Stones. The Society were aware of other contenders of the centre of Scotland: \\"Various spots have been so designated: a site at Struan, several miles to the N.W. of Faskally; also a house on the Killiecrankie road, being the most talked of besides a house in the Fair City of Perth itself.\\" Historic Centre The Centre of Stirling Bridge - The Heart of Scotland Matthew Paris's map of 1247 shows a clear north-south divide to Scotland. Proverbially Stirling is the strategically important \\"Gateway to the Highlands\\". It has been said that \\"Stirling, like a huge brooch clasps Highlands and Lowlands together\\". There is also and east-west divide as told in the story as recorded by Boece who relates that in 855 Scotland was invaded by two Northumbrian princes, Osbrecht and Ella. They united their Northumberian Anglian forces with the Lowland Strathclyde Britons in order to defeat the Highland Pictish Scots. Having secured Stirling castle, they built the first stone bridge over the Forth. On the top they reportedly raised a crucifix with the inscription: \\"Anglos, a Scotis separat, crux ista remotis; Arma hic stant Bruti; stant Scoti hac sub cruce tuti.\\" It may be the stone cross was a tripoint for the three kingdom's borders or marches. In this way the stone cross in the centre of Stirling Bridge was the heart of Scotland. The Centre of the Central Belt and Watershed Arria Cumbernauld with a poem \\"Watershed\\" inscribed on its base. The M8 towards Glasgow from the footbridge at Heart of Scotland services The centre of the Central Belt may also be a point of interest. The Heart of Scotland services known as Harthill is close to the centre of the M8 motorway, Scotland's main road linking East with West. Cumbernauld, also in the Central Belt, is a watershed with one of its rivers (from which its name is derived) flowing to the east and the other flowing west. This watershed test could also apply to other sites like the summit of Ben Lomond being on the line of the Scottish watershed but Cumbernauld arguably has this property in its very name.

Synopsis The film revolves around four children living in an orphanage in Xinjiang province, China. The children are Uyghurs, members of China's largest Muslim minority. Their dream is to become tightrope walkers, an ancient Uyghur tradition. The children start learning to tightrope walk, but within a few months, they are judged inadequate by their coach. Now some of their dreams change: one wants to become a teacher, another a professional singer. One of them however, feels he is simply too small to be good at anything. Eventually, even the one judged most talented at tightrope walking, and the one who dreams of a place in the Guinness Book of World Records for tightrope walking, is let go by the unscrupulous coach who seems only interested in money. One year later, a different coach comes to the orphanage. Through love and kindness, he turns the children's initial failure at tightrope walking into success. The film culminates with their performance on a high wire ‚Äì without a safety net ‚Äì in front of their entire home town. Tightrope walking is in this movie a metaphor for how the Uyghurs try to balance between their Muslim faith and living in a communist state, where they are severely restricted in practicing their religion. This is the first film to ever document Chinese policy on religion in Xinjiang.

He led the efforts to improve the living conditions of the Beta Israel in Ethiopia by expanding education, providing medical facilities, increasing agricultural production and promoting religious freedom. His persistence in the face of opposition enabled many thousands of his people to fulfill their lifelong dream of Aliyah, or return to the homeland of Israel.  Biography  alt= Yona Bogale was born in 1908 in the rural village of Wolleqa, near Gondar in Northern Ethiopia, The eldest of five children of Bogale Birru and Beletu Reda, he was raised in a family of farmers and goat and cattle herders, but showed an early aptitude for language and education. With the help of Dr. Jacob (Jacques) Faitlovitch and Professor Tamrat Emmanuel, he completed his primary studies, and at the age of 12, and was one of several young people selected to study abroad. After attending elementary school in Jerusalem for four years, he spent two years in high school in Frankfurt, Germany. He attended the University of Heidelberg in Germany for two years and completed his international studies at the Asher Institute for Jewish Education in Lausanne, Switzerland and the Alliance Francaise Universelle in Paris, France. After returning to Addis Ababa in 1932, he taught in the teacher training and boarding school opened there by Dr. Faitlovitch. eventually becoming its principal. From 1935, Bogale served as a translator for the Ethiopian Red Cross at the time of the Italian invasion and occupation of Ethiopia. Afterwards, he returned to work in several private businesses , before being appointed in 1941 to a position in the Ethiopian government by King Hailie Selassie I. In 1945, he married Tayitu Kelkele and began a union that spanned 45 years and produced eight children. After Ethiopia gained its independence, Bogale worked as head of the translation department in the Ethiopian Ministry of Education for twelve years. Then, with the cooperation of the Jewish Agency, Sochnut Hayhudit, Bogale opened and supervised more than 20 Jewish schools in Ethiopia. In the wake of Dr. Faitlovitch's death. in 1955, Bogale and Tamrat Emmanuel became the lead advocates for the Beta Israel community. For the next two decades, he was the driving force in opening new schools, medical facilities, prayer houses and agricultural stations in the northwestern part of Ethiopia. His work drew the attention of religious leaders and government officials in Israel, as well as Jewish organizations worldwide, particularly with regard to his goal of aliyah for all Ethiopian Jews. left alt= = Quest for Aliyah = In 1979, increasingly pressured by the Derg, the military coalition that had replaced the King, Bogale emigrated to Israel with help from the American Association for Ethiopian Jews and his own relatives. Later that same year, Bogale, his son, Zecarias Yona, Rahamim Elazar and Baruch Tegegne traveled to Montreal, Canada, at the invitation of the Council of the Jewish Federations , to address that organization's General Assembly. On November 19, Bogale spoke during the plenary session to the 2,500 North American Jewish leaders in attendance. Following his presentation, delegates passed a pro-Beta Israel resolution, becoming the first major Jewish organization to support saving the Ethiopian Jewish community. Upon his return to Israel, with the assistance of Prime Minister Menachem Begin, Bogale began consolidating support for Beta Israelis to return to their homeland. During the next few years, many Jews fled Ethiopia, stopping at refugee camps in Sudan, before arriving in Israel, although thousands died along the way. Finally, in 1984,with the cooperation of the Israel Defense Forces, the Central Intelligence Agency, the United States embassy in Khartoum, mercenaries, and Sudanese state security forces., a covert initiative named Operation Moses airlifted some 8,000 Beta Israelis to Israel. Bogale's son, Zecarias, played a key role in both Operations Moses and Solomon. The latter was an airlift by the Israeli military in 1991 that brought more than 14,000 Ethiopian Jews from Addis Ababa to Jerusalem. Yona Bogale died in 1987 at his home in Petah Tikva. His funeral was attended by over 4,000 mourners, including the Speaker of the Knesset, Shlomo Hillel. He was buried in Har Hamenuhot, Jerusalem, near the grave of his teacher, Professor Tamrat Emmanuel .Yona Bogale's funeral in Jerusalem in 1987 drew more than 4,000 mourners.  Legacy  alt= Because of his devotion to his people and his persistence in freeing them from oppression, Bogale has often been compared to Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King Jr. and Theodor Herzl. In addition to his life‚Äôs work of returning the Beta Israelis to their homeland in Israel, he was a prolific author, editor and translator. Among other works, he published A \\"Falasha\\" Book of Jewish Festivals, an Amharic translation of portions of Pirke Avot and other prayer books, a Hebrew-Amharic dictionary, and translations of two 16th Century history books--all intended to give those Ethiopian Jews who were not proficient in Hebrew, access to books in their native tongue, as well as the means to learn the language of their religion. Fluent in Hebrew, Yiddish, English, French, Italian, German, Tigrinya, Oromia, Geez and Amharic languages, he introduced the Beta Israel community to the first Hebrew-English-Amharic calendar, published every year from 1954 to 1978. Bogale was an early proponent of Ethiopian Jews praying in Hebrew instead of the ancient Semitic language, Ge'ez, as he felt that it was no longer appropriate for those seeking to be a part of the broader Jewish community. However, he did think that Hebrew prayers could be set to Ethiopian Jewish melodies to preserve some liturgical traditions of the Beta Israel community.

It is noted for the hominin fossils that have been found there since the site's discovery in 1960. Originally thought to be Neanderthals, the specimens have since been assigned to Homo sapiens and have been dated to roughly 300,000 years ago ( for the Irhoud 3 mandible, based on other fossils and the flint artefacts found nearby). \\"Here we report the ages, determined by thermoluminescence dating, of fire-heated flint artefacts obtained from new excavations at the Middle Stone Age site of Jebel Irhoud, Morocco, which are directly associated with newly discovered remains of H. sapiens8.

It was discovered in 1960 when the area was being mined for the mineral baryte. A miner discovered a skull in the wall of the cave, extracted it and gave it to an engineer, who kept it as a souvenir for a time. It was eventually handed over to the University of Rabat, who organized a joint French-Moroccan expedition to the site in 1961, headed by the French researcher √âmile Ennouchi. Ennouchi's team identified the remains of around 30 species of mammals, some of which are associated with the Middle Pleistocene, but the stratigraphic provenance is unknown. Another excavation was carried out by Jacques Tixier and Roger de Bayle des Hermens in 1967 and 1969 in which 22 layers were identified in the cave. The lower 13 layers were found to contain signs of human habitation including an industry classified as Levallois Mousterian. Human remains The site is particularly noted for the hominin fossils found there. Ennouchi discovered a skull which he termed Irhoud 1 and is now on display in the Rabat Archaeological Museum. He discovered part of another skull, designated Irhoud 2, the following year and subsequently uncovered the lower mandible of a child, designated Irhoud 3. Tixier's excavation found 1,267 recorded objects including skulls, a humerus designated Irhoud 4 and a hip bone recorded as Irhoud 5. Further excavations were carried out by American researchers in the 1990s and by a team led by Jean-Jacques Hublin from 2004. Animal remains found at the site have enabled the ancient ecology of the area to be reconstructed. It was quite different to the present and probably represented a dry, open and perhaps steppe-like environment roamed by equids, bovids, gazelles, rhinoceros and various predators.  Dating  Stone tools found at Jebel Irhoud The finds were initially interpreted as Neanderthal, as the stone tools found with them were believed to be associated exclusively with Neanderthals. They also had archaic features believed to be representative of the Neanderthals, rather than Homo sapiens. They were thought to be around 40,000 years old, but this was thrown into doubt by faunal evidence suggesting a Middle Pleistocene date, around 160,000 years ago. The fossils were reappraised as representing an archaic form of Homo sapiens or perhaps a population of Homo sapiens that had interbred with Neanderthals. This was consistent with the idea that the then oldest known remains of a Homo sapiens, dated to around 195,000 years ago and found in Omo Kibish, Ethiopia, indicated an eastern African origin for humans at around 200,000 years ago. However, dating carried out by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig revealed that the Jebel Irhoud site was far older than first thought. Fresh excavations carried out in 2004 by the Hublin team revealed more than 20 new bones from the remains of at least five people, and a number of stone tools. The finds included part of a skull, a jawbone, teeth and limb bones which had come from three adults, a juvenile, and a child aged about seven and a half years old. The bones looked similar facially to those of humans today but had much larger lower jaws and elongated braincases. They have similar features to the Florisbad Skull dating to 260,000 years ago found at the other end of the continent, in Florisbad, South Africa, which has been attributed to Homo sapiens on the basis of the Jebel Irhoud finds. Jean-Jacques Hublin at Jebel Irhoud (Morocco), pointing to the crushed human skull (Irhoud 10) whose orbits are visible just beyond his finger tip. The tools were found alongside gazelle bones and lumps of charcoal, indicating the presence of fire and probably of cooking in the cave. The gazelle bones showed characteristic signs of butchery and cooking, such as cut marks, notches consistent with marrow extraction, and charring. Some of the tools had been burned due to fires being lit on top of them, presumably after they had been discarded. This enabled the researchers to use thermoluminescence dating to ascertain when the burning had happened, and by proxy the age of the fossil bones, which were found in the same deposit layer. The burnt tools were dated to around 315,000 years ago, indicating that the fossils are of about the same age. This conclusion was confirmed by recalculating the age of the Irhoud 3 mandible, which produced an age range compatible with that of the tools at roughly 280,000 to 350,000 years old. If they hold up, these dates would make the remains by far the earliest known examples of Homo sapiens. This suggests that, rather than arising in East Africa around 200,000 years ago, modern humans may already have been present across the length of Africa 100,000 years earlier. According to study author Jean-Jacques Hublin, \\"The idea is that early Homo sapiens dispersed around the continent and elements of human modernity appeared in different places, and so different parts of Africa contributed to the emergence of what we call modern humans today.\\" Early humans may have comprised a large, interbreeding population dispersed across Africa whose spread was facilitated by a wetter climate that created a \\"green Sahara\\", around 330,000 to 300,000 years ago. The rise of modern humans may thus have taken place on a continental scale rather than being confined to a particular corner of Africa. A composite reconstruction of the earliest known Homo sapiens fossils from Jebel Irhoud, based on micro computed tomographic scans of multiple original fossils. Hublin and his team also attempted to obtain a DNA sample from these fossils, but these attempts were unsuccessful. Genomic analysis would have provided necessary evidence supporting the conclusion that these fossils are representative of the main lineage leading up to modern humanity, and that Homo sapiens had dispersed and developed all across Africa. Because of the unclear boundaries between different species of the genus Homo, and the lack of genomic evidence from these fossils, some doubt the classification of these fossils as Homo sapiens. Questions remain over the classification of these fossils. Morphology When comparing the fossils with those of modern humans, the main difference is the elongated shape of the fossil braincase. According to the researchers, this indicates that brain shape, and possibly brain functions, evolved within the Homo sapiens lineage and relatively recently. Evolutionary changes in brain shape are likely to be associated with genetic changes of the brain's organization, interconnection and development and may reflect adaptive changes in the way the brain functions. Such changes may have caused the human brain to become rounder and two regions in the back of the brain to become enlarged over thousands of years of evolution. The Jebel Irhoud individuals also had very thick brow ridges and lacked prognathism. The degree of tooth development is similar to modern European children of the same age, but teeth roots develop faster than for modern humans (and slower than for apes and for some other fossil hominids). Tooth crowns took a longer time to form than in modern humans. While the Jebel Irhoud specimens were originally noted to have been similar to later Aterian and Iberomaurusian specimens, further examinations revealed that the Jebel Irhoud specimens differ from them in that the Jebel Irhoud specimens have a continuous supraorbital torus while the Aterian and Iberomaurasian specimens have a discontinuous supraorbital torus or in some cases, none at all, and from this, it was concluded that the Jebel Irhoud specimens represent archaic Homo sapiens while the Aterian and Iberomaurasian specimens represent anatomically modern Homo sapiens.

The genus ranged from the Miocene until the late Pleistocene, becoming extinct about 50,000 years ago. Megalibgwilia species were more widespread in warmer and moist climates. The extinction can be attributed to increasing aridification in Southern Australia. Megalibgwilia was first described from a broken left humerus by Richard Owen in 1884, as \\"Echidna\\" ramsayi. Complete skulls and postcranial fossils have since been described. A second species, M. robusta, was described in 1896 by Australian paleontologist William Sutherland Dun. Although they are sometimes commonly referred to as giant echidnas, Megalibgwilia species are thought to have been similar in size to the contemporary western long-beaked echidna, but with slightly longer forearms. They were smaller than a large species known from fossils in Australia, Zaglossus hacketti. M. ramsayi fossils have been found in deposits across mainland Australia and on Tasmania. M. robusta has only been found in New South Wales.Long, J., Archer, M., Flannery, T. and Hand, S. 2002. Prehistoric Mammals of Australia and New Guinea: One Hundred Million Years of Evolution.

G√ºlhane Park (, \\"Rosehouse Park\\"; from Persian: Gul _kh_ ƒÅna, \\"house of flowers\\") is a historical urban park in the Emin√∂n√º district of Istanbul, Turkey; it is adjacent to and on the grounds of the Topkapƒ± Palace. The south entrance of the park sports one of the larger gates of the palace. It is the oldest and one of the most expansive public parks in Istanbul.  History  The namesake of the park, the G√ºlhane (\\"Rosehouse\\") present on the grounds, was the place where the 1839 Edict of G√ºlhane ( or G√ºlhane Hatt-ƒ± ≈ûerif-√Æ) was proclaimed. The edict launched the Tanzimat reforms in the Ottoman Empire, which modernized the empire and included changes such as the equalization of all Ottoman citizens, regardless of religion, before the law. The proclamation was made by Grand Vizier Mustafa Re≈üid Pasha, a leading statesman, diplomat, and reformer in the Empire. G√ºlhane Park was once part of the outer garden of Topkapƒ± Palace and mainly consisted of a grove. A section of the outer garden was planned as a park by the municipality and opened to the public in 1912. The park previously contained recreation areas, coffee houses, playgrounds etc. Later, a small zoo was opened within the park. The first statue of Atat√ºrk in Turkey was erected in the park in 1926, sculpted by Heinrich Krippel. The park underwent a major renovation in recent years; the removal of the zoo, fun fair and picnic grounds affecting an increase in open space. The excursion routes were re-arranged and the big pool was renovated in a modern style. With concrete structures removed the park regained the natural landscape of the 1950s, revealing trees dating from the 1800s. The Museum of The History of Science and Technology in Islam The Museum of The History of Science and Technology in Islam is located in the former stables of Topkapƒ± Palace, on the western edge of the park. It was opened in May 2008 by the Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The museum features 140 replicas of inventions of the 8th to 16th centuries, from astronomy, geography, chemistry, surveying, optics, medicine, architecture, physics and warfare. Future The old barracks within the area of G√ºlhane is expected to be converted to a cultural center in due course; the center will host a library and exhibition hall together with a workshop on kilim and handicrafts.

It stars Toralv Maurstad as Grieg and features an international cast including Florence Henderson, Christina Schollin, Robert Morley, Harry Secombe, Oskar Homolka, Edward G. Robinson, and Frank Porretta (as Rikard Nordraak). Filmed in Super Panavision 70 by Davis Boulton and presented in single-camera Cinerama in some countries, it was an attempt to capitalize on the success of The Sound of Music, and was the first musical in Cinerama.

Reception Song of Norway was one of a series of commercial disasters that followed the success of My Fair Lady and The Sound of Music, two films that led studios to believe that a revival of full-scale musical films was imminent. Similar box-office disasters included Darling Lili, Mame, Paint Your Wagon, and Lost Horizon. However, the film was popular in some territories. In Britain, it was the most popular \\"reserved ticket\\" film of 1971. It earned rentals of $4.4 million in North America and $3.5 million in other countries, recording an overall loss of $1,075,000. Critics were virtually unanimously negative on its release, noting especially the aping of The Sound of Music and its generally poor production quality despite obvious expense. In The New Yorker, Pauline Kael wrote: \\"The movie is of an unbelievable badness; it brings back clich√©s you didn‚Äôt know you knew - they‚Äôre practically from the unconscious of moviegoers.\\"Kael, Pauline (1971) Deeper into Movies, Calder Boyars The New York Times wrote that the film \\"was no ordinary movie kitsch, but a display to turn Guy Lombardo livid with envy.\\"Quoted in Beck, R. (2002) The Edward G. Robinson Encyclopedia, McFarland. p. 293 Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film half of one star out of four and wrote \\"The fjords aren't exactly alive with the sound of Grieg thanks to a disastrous screenplay by Andrew Stone who finds it more convenient to photograph a mountain than to write intelligent dialog.\\" Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times called the film \\"inoffensive but unsatisfying\\" and compared it unfavorably to The Sound of Music, which \\"had a strong narrative line and generated a good deal of suspense. It's not Grieg's fault he wasn't chased by Nazis, of course, but such trials as there were in his life seem either lacklustre or inappropriate to a family musical.\\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote that the film had \\"next to no plot\\" and \\"beautiful scenery or not, people are going to lose interest as slowly but surely as they do when watching the neighbors' slides of their trip to Europe.\\" Critics' views were echoed by cast members.

Trains run frequently every day, with stops at 16 stations. Until 2011 it was known as the Paraparaumu Line.  Construction  The Kapiti Line was constructed by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company as part of its line between Wellington and Longburn, south of Palmerston North. It was built by a group of Wellington businessmen frustrated with the indecision of the government about the construction of a west coast route out of Wellington. Construction of the line began in September 1882 and followed a circuitous, steep route via Johnsonville. It was opened to Plimmerton in October 1885 and completed on 3 November 1886. The final spike was driven just north of Paraparaumu, at Otaihanga. The government acquired the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company on the 7 December 1908 and incorporated it into its national network as the southern portion of the North Island Main Trunk line.  Deviation and electrification  In 1928, work began on a deviation to avoid the difficult section of the line between Wellington and Tawa through Johnsonville. The deviation required the construction of two significant tunnels between Kaiwharawhara and Tawa. It opened as a single track line to freight on 24 July 1935 and as a double track line to passengers on 19 June 1937. The Wellington to Johnsonville section was retained as the Johnsonville Line. Electrification from Wellington to Paekakariki was completed on 24 July 1940,Bruce Murray and David Parsons: Rails through the Valley: The story of the construction and use of the railway lines through Tawa (2008, Tawa Historical Society) avoiding the smoke nuisance in the new deviation's lengthy second tunnel, and providing extra tractive effort on the Paekakariki Hill between Pukerua Bay and Paekakariki. Paekakariki became a major station where long-distance trains swapped from steam (later diesel) to electric motive power and became the northern terminus of the commuter line for many years. Electrification was extended to Paraparaumu on 7 May 1983 and to Waikanae on 20 February 2011. Duplication The Manawatu Railway Company railway when first constructed was a single track railway with crossing loops at principal stations to allow opposing trains to pass. In the 1920s the need for extra train services on the line was recognised, both to increase the tonnage of goods trains and to allow more frequent suburban passenger services. To increase the number of trains that the line could carry, duplication and electrification of the line along with other improvements, such as curve easements, was planned and progressed in stages. The first section of track duplicated was the Tawa Flat deviation. Completed in 1935, it provided double track from Wellington to Tawa Flat (now Tawa), and bypasses the steep 1 in 36 grades from Wellington to Ngaio on the Johnsonville Line. The section from Plimmerton to South Junction (a little north of Muri Station at the top of the Paekakariki Hill) and from North Junction (at the northern portal of northern Paekakariki tunnel) to Paekakariki was completed in 1940. The difficult single track section along the coast between South and North Junctions which passed through five short single track tunnels remaines as single track. As part of the Plimmerton to Paekakariki duplication, a Westinghouse three-wire (two feed and one return) Centralised Train Control (CTC) system was installed in 1940; to control trains from Wellington. It was the first CTC system in New Zealand and the first outside the United States of America.Changes to the Railway Line through Porirua City . Porirua City Council. Accessed 4 September 2016. This avoided the need for two new signal boxes at the North and South junctions and the need with \\"tablet\\" working to continuously man five stations (Tawa, Porirua, Paremata, Plimmerton and Pukerua Bay; with 3 or 4 tablet porters at each station); so requiring 19 men for traffic working. CTC working applied between Paekakariki and Plimmerton on 25 February, Plimmerton and Paremata on 30 June and Tawa to Porirua on 4 December 1940; giving full traffic control from Wellington to Paekakariki (as Wellington to Tawa was double tracked). From 14 June 1943 a siding for the US Marines' camp at McKays Crossing with a crossing loop and tablet station was opened; near where the Wellington Tramway Museum is now located. With duplication of the track from Paekakariki to McKays Crossing and automatic signalling from Paekakariki to Paraparaumu, McKays Crossing was relay worked from the Paekakariki South signal box from December 1943. But on 25 March 1946 the catch points and two cross-overs of the siding were lifted, and McKays Crossing became the point where the double-track section north ended. Further duplication was delayed in the 1940s but continued in the 1950s with the completion of the Tawa to Porirua section on 15 December 1957. Double track from Porirua to Mana was opened on 7 November 1960. Harbour reclamation allowed mostly straight track with the line no longer following the curves of the shoreline bays north of Porirua. A new station and bridge at Paremata were required. The Mana to Plimmerton section was opened on 16 October 1961. In conjunction with the extension of electrification to Paraparaumu in March 1983, double track was extended from Paekakariki to McKays Crossing on 5 December 1993. The section between McKays Crossing and Paraparaumu, built across a peat swamp, remained single track. Extension of double track from McKays Crossing to a junction south of the Waikanae River bridge was completed in February 2011 to coincide with the extension of electrification to Waikanae.  Operation  From electrification in 1940 until the 1980s, the majority of commuter services on the line were operated by DM/D electric multiple units, with some carriage trains hauled by ED and EW electric locomotives, particularly at peak periods. ED and EW locomotives also hauled freight trains over this section until the tunnels between Pukerua Bay and Paekakariki were lowered in 1967 and DA diesel locomotives could be used into Wellington. From 1982, the new EM/ET electric multiple units were delivered. They had been ordered to replace the wooden carriage trains hauled by electric locomotives on commuter services and largely displaced the DM/D units on the Paraparaumu Line. By the 1980s, the ED and EW electric locomotives were not required for either freight trains or for commuter trains. They were retired due to age and lack of use, the EDs by 1981 and the EWs by 1988. From 2010 the introduction of the Matangi EMUs provided extra passenger capacity, and enabled the remaining DM/D EMUs to be withdrawn in 2012. A second batch of Matangi EMUs was then ordered to replace the EM/ET EMUs (rather than reconditioning them). A proposal to extend the electrification to Waikanae was approved by the Greater Wellington Regional Council on 8 May 2007. This project included the double tracking of the single track line between MacKays Crossing (between Paekakariki and Paraparaumu) as far as the rail underbridge and river bridge south of Waikanae. The $90 million project started in December 2008, and was completed in 2011, with the first commuter trains to Waikanae on 20 February. Completion of the project was delayed to 2011 to minimise commuter disruption by working in the quiet end-of-year holiday period, according to ONTRACK program director David Gordon. The project involved 50 workers and 20 machines installing 600 traction poles in eight or nine metre deep holes, and laying 30 km of rail and 30,000 sleepers. The project allows commuter services from Waikanae every 15 minutes at peak travel times but more commonly every 30 minutes.Kapiti Observer 18 January 2010 pp8,9 The new Matangi electric multiple units were used on the Kapiti Line from mid-2011. Paraparaumu and Waikanae stations were upgraded at a cost of more than $1 million each. Upgrading Waikanae station rather than moving it south of Elizabeth Street or providing a road underpass was criticised locally, as frequent closing of the Elizabeth Street level crossing south of the station (which connected to State Highway through the town) could increase traffic congestion in Waikanae.Kapiti Observer 7 December 2009 page 3 However this has since been alleviated by the opening of the Kapiti Expressway which has moved the main road west and out of the centre of Waikanae itself. Ten traction substations along the line take electricity from Wellington Electricity or Electra's 11,000-volt distribution network and transform and rectify it to 1500-volt direct current for the overhead traction lines. The substations are located at Wellington, Kaiwharawhara, Glenside, Paremata, Mana, Pukerua Bay, Paekakariki, Raumati, Lindale and Waikanae. Also along the line are two \\"cross-tie\\" substations at Ngauranga and Tawa, which provide a switching function but don't have transformers or rectifiers. Public road-rail crossings have warning lights and barriers, and some are now fitted with automatically locking pedestrian gates to prevent use while alarms are operating.  The future  The Kapiti Line (2007, before electrification), looking south from the Otaihanga Road level crossing. On the right is the location of a former halt; on the left is the Southward Car Museum. Proposals for new stations at Raumati South, between MacKays Crossing and Paraparaumu, and Lindale, north of Paraparaumu near Otaihanga, were on hold, to be reconsidered after 2010, as it was claimed that there were problems affecting a station at Raumati (the provision of access to SH 1 and park-and-ride facilities) and an unstable hillside behind the line.The Dominion Post, 15 April 2008, page A5 \\"Railway station plans go on hold\\"Greater Wellington - Kapiti Coast railway upgrade details revealed The 2013 Review and Draft 2014 Review of the Wellington Regional Public Transport Plan confirmed that building additional stations on the Kapiti Line at Raumati and Lindale was no longer recommended, with the cost of new stations outweighing the benefits. The detailed analysis for Raumati (which was a \\"viability benchmark\\" for other new stations) said that the modelled peak-hour patronage needed to be about 300 new passengers to justify a new station, and that most Raumati users would have switched from Paraparaumu Station. Network extensions beyond the current Metlink rail operation limits would be by \\"shuttles or non-electrified services\\" running to Wellington.Draft Wellington Regional Public Transport Plan, April 2014 p 58 Proposed infrastructure upgrades include sleeper replacement in tunnels, stabilisation of high-risk slopes and renewal of one bridge with timber elements. To cater for freight trains with more frequent passenger trains, there will be a new freight loop at Plimmerton or an improved loop at Porirua (2021/2022; $11.09 million); and Plimmerton will get a high capacity train turn-back facility as a terminal station (2021; $12.8 million). Power supply upgrades will allow more long (8 car) trains (2020; $10.1 million).Wellington Timetable Changes and Infrastructure Upgrades by Bruce Taylor in The New Zealand Railway Observer June‚ÄìJuly 2018 No 349 Volume 75 No 2, pages 62,63 The single-track section above the coast between Pukerua Bay and Paekakariki (known as the North-South Junction) may also be double tracked through a single long double track tunnel (replacing seven short tunnels) or replaced by a less steep deviation; although the present proposal is to daylight only the northernmost (No. 7) tunnel which is through rock, and have double track north from there.Terry McDavitt, et al., Proposed Western Corridor Plan: Hearing Subcommittee's Report (Greater Wellington Regional Council, 8 March 2006), 51-4. Extension to ≈åtaki Further extension of the electrification north from Waikanae to ≈åtaki remains a possibility. A group known as \\"Save Kapiti\\" is actively campaigning for the extension. The Otaki Community Board also supports the extension of electrification. Provision has been made during road earthworks north of Waikanae for a future crossing loop between Peka Peka and ≈åtaki.Kapiti Observer 18 January 2010 page 7 In 2012 the Greater Wellington Regional Council investigated extension of the electrification with Matangi trains north of Waikanae to ≈åtaki (estimated cost $30 million for the ≈åtaki project) and north of Upper Hutt to a new station at Timberlea. In March 2014, the GWRC said that electrification to ≈åtaki was estimated to cost $115 million to $135 million and was too costly for the number of new passengers it would attract (approximately 250 new passengers). Because the trip would take over an hour, new trains with toilets would be required. As an alternative to electrification, it was suggested that diesel multiple units could be used on services north of Waikanae. This could be a \\"final nail in the coffin\\" for the under-threat Capital Connection service from Wellington to Palmerston North, which also stops at ≈åtaki. During the 2017 general election, the Green Party proposed extending electrification to ≈åtaki as an alternative to the Northern Corridor extension from Pekapeka. In the lead up to the local authority elections of 2019, candidate for Mayor of the Kapiti Coast District, Gwynn Compton, started a petition to extend electrification to ≈åtaki.

She made her screen debut in the episode broadcast on 4 June 2004. The character was played by twelve young actors, including Chloe Marshall who took over the role in 2007. Pippa made her last regular appearance on 2 April 2008, with the character departing town off screen in the following day's episode, but returned on 15 July 2013 with Piper Morrissey now playing the role. Pippa is Flynn Saunders (Joel McIlroy) and Sally Fletcher's (Kate Ritchie) daughter. Casting Pippa was played by twelve different child actors from her introduction in 2004 to her departure in 2008. The actors were Riley Stevens, Anouk Povaly, Noah Fraser, Isabelle Bell-Dickson, Jessica Taylor Lorenxo, Mia Szczenpanik, Leila Szczenpanik, Bojanna Main, Tameka Main, Phoebe Falconer, India Falconer and Chloe Marshall. In 2010, Charles Legge from the Daily Mail stated that the character held the record for multiple recasts in a soap opera. Pippa returned along with her mother, Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie), on 15 July 2013. Piper Morrissey was cast in the role. Morrissey auditioned twice for the role of Pippa. She was initially told the character she was reading for was called Poppy. Morrissey was not a regular viewer of Home and Away prior to landing the role of Pippa and she was not aware of who Ritchie was. However, they became close during filming and Morrissey commented \\"She was so nice. I just loved working with Kate, We kind of did act like mother and daughter.\\" Storylines=2004‚Äì08 Pippa is conceived using eggs that her mother Sally had frozen before her undergoing a hysterectomy for cancer some years earlier, after her friend Leah Patterson offers to be a surrogate for Sally and her husband Flynn Saunders (Joel McIlroy). When Leah goes into labour, her ex-boyfriend Jesse has to drive her to the hospital and Sally and Flynn are initially nowhere to be found. Leah gives birth to a girl, who Sally and Flynn name Philippa or \\"Pippa\\" after Pippa Ross (Debra Lawrance). Flynn dies of cancer a couple of years later, leaving Pippa without a father figure until Sally begins dating Brad Armstrong (Chris Sadrinna). The family move into the Caravan Park, along with Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher). Pippa is upset and shocked when Brad leaves Summer Bay and she starts talking to him, seemingly as if he is still around. Sally becomes concerned, but then remembers her own childhood imaginary friend and leaves Pippa to it. While minding Pippa, Alf goes to move his ute and is unaware that she has followed him outside. When Pippa drops her teddy bear, she goes to pick it up, just as Alf starts reversing. Alf hits Pippa and she is rushed to hospital where she has to undergo surgery. Sally decides to leave the Bay to travel around the world and she, Pippa and Cassie Turner (Sharni Vinson) depart together, eventually ending up in Thailand. 2013 Five years later, Sally and Pippa return to the Bay. Sally decides to show Pippa some of her favourite places like the beach, the high school and the house they lived in together. Pippa befriends Darcy Callahan (Alea O'Shea), after they meet on the beach. Sally worries that Pippa is becoming tired, but Pippa assures her that she is fine. She later forgets Darcy's name and when she drops a plate, Sally berates her for not taking a nap. Sally then reveals to Alf that Pippa has Mitochondrial disease and is dying. Pippa convinces Sally to let her attend Summer Bay High. Leah's son VJ Patterson (Felix Dean) and his friend Jett James (Will McDonald) learn of Pippa's condition when they look at her school records. They tell Pippa they will be there for her but Sally has kept the truth from Pippa, leaving her upset. The boys feel guilty and support her. Pippa is hospitalised after having a seizure at school and Sally wants to take her to a clinic in the United States that offers an experimental treatment but has insufficient money. Pippa, who has been planning her own funeral, is upset that Sally keeps hiding the truth from her and refuses to speak to her until she agrees to be honest. Pippa returns to school but plays truant with Jett. After Pippa's headteacher Bianca Scott (Lisa Gormley) and her fianc√© Heath Braxton (Dan Ewing) set up a fund for Pippa and Darryl Braxton (Stephen Peacocke) makes a large anonymous donation, there is enough money for Sally to take her to the States. Alf's daughter Roo (Georgie Parker) arranges a farewell party at the surf club but Alf, aware he might not see Pippa again and upset when Pippa asks him to witness her will, refuses to attend. At the last minute, he changes his mind and says goodbye to Pippa and Sally on the beach. Reception For her portrayal of Pippa, Chloe Marshall received a nomination for Best Young Actor at the 2008 Inside Soap Awards. James Joyce from the Newcastle Herald called Pippa a \\"medical miracle\\". A Daily Record reporter quipped \\"Pippa is one of Summer Bay's popular characters ‚Äì although we hardly see her. Sally's daughter invariably pops up now and then to remind us the long-standing resident is actually a working mum and not just a dedicated headmistress.\\" They added that \\"the poor lass\\" had been through a lot with Brad's departure and that it was only a matter of time before attention turned to her, following Sally's time in the spotlight. Commenting on the storyline in which Alf hits Pippa with his ute, another Daily Record reporter said \\"The tyke appears in the odd scene or two with her mum, who only seems to either put her to bed, make her some toast or pat her on the head. It's a shame then the poor lass has to be unconscious for her biggest storyline to date. She ends up critically injured after Alf backs over her, while Sally is beside herself with anguish.\\" The episode which dealt with the aftermath of the accident and Pippa's subsequent hospitalisation earned Sam Meikle a nomination for an Australian Writers' Guild Award in 2008.

Today, the palace is a branch of the M. K. ƒåiurlionis National Art Museum. History Antanas Smetona Monument President Kazys Grinius near the Presidential Palace, 1926 Antanas Smetona speaking from the balcony of the Presidential Palace The original palace was constructed on in 1846, when a local aristocrat received authorization to build the two-story edifice. The project featured a symmetrically designed structure with seven rooms on the first floor, and nine rooms on the second floor. Shortly afterwards the building was expanded and another portal was added. In 1866, a garden was also laid out in front of the building. Two years later, additional structures were built nearby, and the building was acquired by the Russian government as a residence for the Kovno Governor. In 1876, the building was finally purchased by that government. During the latter part of the 19th century the building underwent further expansion, and an additional wing was constructed as well as a new gallery. During World War I, Kaiser Wilhelm II briefly stayed in the palace in 1915 while visiting the Eastern front. Lithuania proclaimed its independence in 1918, and at that time the building became the property of the Lithuanian government. After Lithuania's capital, Vilnius, was occupied by Poland, Kaunas became the temporary capital and the building was designated as its Presidential Palace. It was remodeled and became the Lithuanian president's official residence. The building witnessed a crisis of parliamentarism, the Coup d‚Äô√âtat of 1926, and a turn towards authoritarian regime. The garden was surrounded by a cast iron fence that has survived to this day. The palace served as the presidential residence until 1940, when Lithuania again lost its independence. In the face of imminent Soviet occupation, the Last Meeting of the government of Lithuania took place here on the night from June 14 to 15 of 1940. During Soviet rule, the palace underwent further alterations and the size of the garden was reduced, while some adjacent buildings were demolished. On the first floor, some interior walls were removed to make way for a movie theater. Later it was converted to the Kaunas teacher's headquarters, and hosted teacher's organizations. In 1989, the administration of the palace was transferred to the Vytautas the Great War Museum. After Lithuania regained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, the palace was designated as a historical landmark. Soon afterward, three statues of the interwar presidents of Lithuania were erected in the palace garden, Antanas Smetona, Aleksandras Stulginskis, and Kazys Grinius. In 1997, more renovations were implemented, but due to financial problems, the work took six years to complete. In 2003, the 85th anniversary of Lithuanian Independence, the renovated palace was officially re-opened. The total cost of the works exceeded five million litas.XXI am≈æius.

Teubner, 1971, p. 392. The result was a Byzantine victory. After an unsuccessful campaign of the Byzantine Emperor Constantine V earlier that year, the Bulgar Khan Telerig decided to strike back to the southwest and sent a small raiding army of 12,000 to capture Berzitia. The Byzantine emperor was informed of the raid in due time by his spies in Pliska and gathered an enormous force. The Byzantines surprised the Bulgarian army, and after a long fight they managed to defeat them due to their great superiority in troops. Constantine V was eager to follow up his success and led another campaign against the Bulgars, but once again it failed. However, Telerig learned during this event that all his plans were known to Constantine through a network of spies within his government. He decided to eliminate them once and for all and sent a message to Constantine, stating that he was going to flee in exile to Constantinople. In exchange, Telerig asked the emperor to reveal the spies to his associates in Pliska for their own safety. As Telerig was not the first ruler to flee to Constantinople, Constantine revealed his information and sent the Bulgarian government the list of spies; however, Telerig deceived him and did not travel to Constantinople. When Telerig learned of their names, he executed them all and eliminated the Byzantine spy network within his government.John V.A. Fine, Jr. (1991).

It is the oldest continuously-operated port in Spain and one of the oldest in the Mediterranean. Principal port activities include cruise shipping and the importation of containerised manufactured products, break bulk and vehicles. A small fishing fleet also operates from the port. History Alcazaba of M√°laga from the port.  Ancient and medieval times  The Port of Malaga was founded by Phoenicians from Tyre in around 1000 BC. The name Malaka is probably derived from the Phoenician word for salt because fish was salted on the first dock; in other Semitic languages the word for salt is still Hebrew ◊û◊ú◊ó m√©la·∏• or Arabic ŸÖŸÑÿ≠ mil·∏•. This first dock was a single waterfront quay parallel to the shore and extending for about 500 metres from the customs house to the Puerta Oscura. By Roman times Malaga had become an important export port for minerals, pottery, almonds, wine and oil. An Iberian delicacy was fish prepared with garum, large quantities of which were also exported to Rome. Trade continued to grow, peaking when Malaga (now MƒÅlaqah (Arabic ŸÖÿßŸÑŸÇÿ©) was declared the capital of the Islamic kingdom of Granada. When the kingdom passed into Catholic control in 1487 the port assumed a strategic importance as an embarkation point for Spanish soldiers in the conquest of the Rif, Melilla, Pe√±on de Velez and Oran, and was renamed the Port of M√°laga.  Imperial Spain  The Port of M√°laga grew swiftly throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, establishing itself as Spain's major export port for cereals and manufactures during the Habsburg and Enlightenment eras. In 1720 King Philip V appointed French engineer Bartolome Thurus to prepare a project of port expansion for commercial and military needs, culminating in the construction of both the East Dock and the New Quay. The first lighthouse was built in 1814.  Twentieth Century  Between 1900 and 1910 an extensive reconstruction of port facilities resulted in the modernization of the existing quays and the completion of the current passenger terminal. The M√°laga-Puertollano oil pipeline was completed by 1920, permitting oil exports directly from the port. After the Second World War the importance of the port declined as new ports opened in North Africa and the Middle East, and post-war reconstruction led to the massive expansion of facilities at Port of Rotterdam and elsewhere. The Puertotollano pipeline ceased operation in the 1990s. Port operations were concentrated around ten wharves on the southern border of the existing port. The northern and central port areas were then progressively returned to the control of the city and converted for residential use. Muelle 1, (Quay 1) shopping and restaurant area. Quay 2.  Port facilities  Ten wharves are currently in operation at the Port of M√°laga: * East Quay: Embarkation for cruise ship. * Quay n¬∞1 \\"Ricardo Gross\\": Megayatchs and touristic cruise ships. * Quay n¬∞2 \\"Guadiaro\\": Cruise ships. * Quay n¬∞3 \\"Canovas\\": Roll-on/roll-off. * Quay n¬∞4 \\"Heredia\\": Roll-on/roll-off, bulk liquids, break bulk. * Quay n¬∞5 Floating dock: Repairs and defence forces. * Quay n¬∞6 \\"Romero Oak grove 1\\": Bulk liquids, dangerous goods. * Quay n¬∞7 \\"Romero Oak grove 2\\": Bulk liquids, dangerous goods. * Multipurpose Quay n¬∞9: Containers, Roll-on/roll-off * Soft Port 1: bulk liquid import/export where specialist equipment required. The quays are connected by a system of internal roads and a network of internal and external railway lines . Access to the Port is via State Highways A-7 (Barcelona-C√°diz) that runs by the coast, and A-45 (C√≥rdoba-M√°laga). The internal rail network links the Harbor Services Area with the M√°laga Main Station. The port is dominated by imports, principally an annual throughput of nearly 2 million tonnes of break bulk within a total annual throughput of 3.1 million tonnes. Major imports include cement, clinker coal, cereals, grains, petroleum coke and fertilizers. A substantially smaller export trade is centred on processed food and construction equipment. The port handles in excess of 450,000 TEU's annually, and 39,000 vehicles. Liquid bulk handling is approximately 70,000 metric tonnes per year, principally olive oil import and export. Cruise shipping is also an essential industry at the port, with 211,000 passenger embarkations each year from more than 220 cruise ships. The existing Mario L√≥pez Shipyard and Shiprepair facilities are part of the Cernaval Group Shipyards, founded by the local naval entrepreneur Mr. Mario L√≥pez on the early eighties; this installation has been a mayor player in the local marine sector for many years, and with over 40 shiprepairs yearly with vessels from all over the world a very important asset for the Port of M√°laga, in future more investments are fixed to continue the development of this industry.  Future works  City view from the port. An extensive program of works are planned for the Port as part of a Special plan developed by the City of M√°laga. The Hereida Quay will be refurbished to expand port operation centres and provide an additional 500 car spaces. The works are estimated at 33 million euros. A new passenger terminal, port museum and environmental education centre are planned for inclusion in the cruise ship facilities at Quay 2 at a further cost of 22 million euros. A commercial marina will also operate from Quay 1, catering for 24 superyachts of up to 30 metres, and the Eastern Quay passenger terminal will be remodeled to improve pedestrian access and double existing capacity to 560,000 passengers a year. The total area of the new terminal is 1,270 m2, consisting of two heights and two new berths: Southern Berth and Northern Berth with a total construction cost of 21.3 million euros.

On July 11, 1864, the Federation of Catholic Circles and Conservative Associations was created (; ). The other group which contributed to the party were the Catholic Cercles, of which the eldest had been founded in Bruges. The Malines Congresses in 1863, 1864, and 1867 brought together Ultramontanes or Confessionals and the Liberal-Catholics or Constitutionals. At the Congress of 1867, it was decided to create the League of Catholic Circles, which was founded on October 22, 1868. The Catholic Party, under the leadership of Charles Woeste, gained an absolute majority in the Belgian Chamber of Representatives in 1884 from the Liberal Party in the wake of the schools dispute. The Catholic Party retained its absolute majority until 1918. In 1921, the party became the Catholic Union, and from 1936 the Catholic Block.

Course and features The Deua River rises about southeast of Bendethera Mountain, on the eastern slopes of the Badja Range, part of the Great Dividing Range, within Deua National Park, in rugged and thickly forested ranges south of Braidwood. The river flows generally south, west, north, northeast, south southeast and east, making almost a complete circle, and is joined by fourteen minor tributaries, before becoming the Moruya River near Kiora. The river descends over its course. The lower reaches of the river are estuarine by nature and are called the Moruya River, while the freshwater reaches are called the Deua River. The upper catchment of the Deua River is suspected to be in a rain shadow, so the Deua River is on the whole a small river, and naturally experiences periods of very low flow. Heavy use of groundwater and riverwater however, for summer irrigation of fruit crop in the tributary Araluen Valley and the main river locality Merricumbene, greatly exacerbate summer low flows. The village of Araluen lies in the valley of Araluen Creek, that joins the Deua River at roughly the midpoint in its course. The name 'Araluen' means 'water lily' or 'place of the water lilies' in the local aboriginal dialect. At the time of European settlement Araluen was described as a broad alluvial valley with one or more large natural billabongs covered with water lilies. No such billabongs exist in the Araluen valley today. As with most river and creek valleys in south-eastern Australia, the natural landscape and landforms of Araluen Creek and its valley were destroyed by rampant and destructive gold mining in the latter half of the 19th century. This has mobilised hundreds of thousands of tons of coarse granitic sand and has led to serious sand-slugging or sand siltation of the lower half of the Deua River below the Araluen Creek confluence. New gold mines in the headwaters of the river remain controversial and have attracted considerable public attention for their proposed use of cyanide and breaches of environmental standards. Despite the sand-slugging the Deua River is bio- diverse and supports an extremely important population of the endangered fish the Australian grayling (Prototroctes maraena)Department of the Environment‚ÄîSpecies Profile and Threats Database‚ÄîAustralian Grayling‚Äîpossibly the best in the state of New South Wales‚Äîas well as thriving populations of several other native freshwater fish species including Cox's gudgeon (Gobiomorphus coxii), congolli (Pseudaphritis urvillii), Australian smelt (Retropinna semoni) and Galaxiids (Galaxias sp.). The river also supports healthy populations of platypus, azure kingfishers and eastern water dragons. Historical accounts of sand-slugging It is evident from the following accounts that sand-slugging of the Deua/Moruya Rivers commenced rapidly after the rampant destruction (via sluicing) of the tributary Araluen Creek and its valley in the 1860s. The damage of this gold-mining will last many lifetimes, as it is evident that the copious sand-slugging now present in the river will take many thousands of years to work through the river and out to sea via floods. Yarragee in its spring dress is really a pretty little village. It is situated about two miles from the town- ship, and on a bend of the Moruya River. The cottages are very comfortable, surrounded by flowers, timber, and fruit trees, and those in particular of Messrs. Jacob Luck, John Luck, and T. Gannon, are worthy of note. Near the banks of the river, Mr. Jacob Luck has a nice plantation of some hundreds of various young orange trees. Here my attention was called to the state of the Moruya River, which is very shallow at this point, being filled, it is alleged, by the silt washed down from the Araluen diggings by the floods. About sixteen years ago the depth was sufficiently great to allow a vessel of sixty tons register to be built and launched here. This vessel belonged to Mr. Collett, whose estate I have described. Now the stream is scarcely a foot deep at this point, which is about six miles from Moruya, following the river course. A Tour to the South. [FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT.] No. 10.‚ÄîTHE BROULEE DISTRICT (CONTINUED). Australian Town and Country Journal, Saturday 21 October 1871, Page 11THE BROULEE DISTRICT, Australian Town and Country Journal, 21 October 1871. Moruya stands on the south bank of the Moruya River, which runs west and east, its head being only five miles from the township. Steamers and coasters can enter the river with safety, and as several improvements have been effected of late years, the vessels find a fair port of shelter. The Moruya at the township is a fine wide stream fully 300 yards across; unfortunately it is shallow and only navigable for boats. The increase of silt in the river of late years has been somewhat remarkable, and can only be accounted for from the fact that the Moruya being the outlet for Araluen and the diggings around its head, it is stated that thousands of tons of sand are washed down each flood. The silting up of the stream would be of little moment were it not that directly opposite the town a sand-bank has during the last year placed itself, rendering the passage of the punt impossible. Traffic being impeded the inhabitants of Moruya are seriously inconvenienced. Petitions for a bridge have been presented, and the residents of the town and district are most anxious for a favourable consideration of their request.

[FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.] The Sydney Mail and New South Wales Advertiser, Saturday 26 July 1873, Page 102The Southern Coast Districts.‚ÄîFrom Bega to Moruya, The Sydney Mail, 26 July 1873. Some ten months back, I described in the columns of the Herald the southern coast, Moruya being included in my jottings with the rest of the coast town. I will not therefore at present enter into detail, but simply string together a few memories, mental ones made during my progress from Moruya to Manaro. One of the first of these memories, I find, must touch upon the Moruya River, a stream which, by the way, of late years has not been conducting itself in a manner likely to benefit or keep the goodwill of the residents along its banks. Some short time back a punt used to travel from bank to bank opposite the town, the depth of water being quite sufficient for the purpose‚Äîindeed more, for I believe small coasting craft used to come up from the Heads to the town, a distance of about five miles. Latterly, however, the stream commenced to silt up, each fresh bringing down from the Araluen thousands of tons of sand. In fact, the Moruya for years had to do the duty of a monster tail-race for the diggers of the Araluen Valley. Immense sandbanks now have formed in the river. The punt cannot work, and the crossings, which only can be attempted by horses or vehicles at low tides, are dangerous in the extreme. This state of things is most disagreeable to the people of Moruya, and offers a serious bar to the traffic along this part of the coast. By all reports, and according to all opinions, nothing but a bridge can answer the purpose. To obtain this boon the residents of the district have struggled, and I believe intend this year to make another attempt. TRIP TO THE MANARO. [BY OUR SPECIAL REPORTER.] The Sydney Morning Herald, Thursday 26 March 1874, Page 6TRIP TO THE MANARO, The Sydney Morning Herald, 26 March 1874. On approaching Araluen affairs assume a more serious air. The change commences where the Sideling Gold Mining Company has erected its great waterwheel, and is at work reefing and ground sluicing. This is at a distance of seven miles from Araluen. The company consists of eight proprietors, who are sanguine. The particulars promised respecting this claim have not yet reached me. From this claim the indications of mining increase. The timber is more interfered with, races intersected the country everywhere, and patches of upturned country impart an air of desolation inseparable from mining industry. The Araluen Creek winds through an extensive valley 1200 feet above the sea level, and surrounded by ranges of mountains about two miles apart. The ranges attain an altitude of 1000 feet, are precipitous, and sparsely wooded to the summit. In this enclosure the shallow stream which now winds about, once swelled into a lagoon [i.e. the lagoon once covered in water lilies], and over the whole of the rocky bed formed a deposit which is now the object of search. This layer of ‚Äúwash-dirt‚Äù, which varies from four to thirty feet in depth, contains the gold. Near the creek it is easily reached, but away back it is covered with the tailings and debris of former diggers, that has to be removed. Further from the creek, therefore, the more stripping there is to deal with‚Äî16, 18, and 20 feet. FROM MORUYA TO ARALUEN. [FROM AN OCCASIONAL TRAVELLER.] ARALUEN, NOVEMBER 20. The Sydney Mail and New South Wales Advertiser, Saturday 28 November 1874, Page 683FROM MORUYA TO ARALUEN, The Sydney Mail, 28 November 1874. Sir,‚ÄîFor the information of those who are opposed to dredging on the Murrumbidgee, permit me to quote the reply given recently at the Chamber of Mines, Sydney, by a New Zealand expert. The question was‚ÄîWhat effect had dredging on natural watercourses. His reply‚ÄîNothing more than that produced by ordinary sluicing. If that be so the people of the lower Murrumbidgee have every reason to be alarmed should the Minister grant the lease applied for at Gundagai. We have ample proof of the damage sluicing at Araluen has done on the Moruya River; it was, prior to the gold discovery at Araluen, navigable to the township of Moruya, but now the coasters cannot approach within ten miles of the town; the river has silted up to such a degree that rich maize-growing flats, which were formerly impervious to floods, now become submerged when we have what may be termed a moderate rainfall, making the land practically valueless for maize production. There are many gentlemen, residents of Gundagai, who can bear witness to the accuracy of the above statement.

History  At the start of the 20th century, housing in many areas of Wrexham was of poor quality and, with the increase in industry locally, in short supply. The development of Garden Village began with the purchase of some of land from Sir Foster Cunliffe near to the estate of Acton by the Welsh Town Planning and Housing Trust Limited.The Garden City Movement Up-To-Date by Ewart G. Culpin (Retrieved 2011-01-11) The intention was to provide affordable housing to workers coming to Wrexham to work in the expanding industries of coal and iron. Gresford Colliery had recently been opened where it was expected that approximately 3,000 men would be employed in the next two years. A Co-partnership Housing Society was set up in 1913 called Wrexham Tenants Limited, with Lord Kenyon, Mr. David Davies, M.P., and others as Directors to build the houses, while the Trust would build the roads and supervise the development of the estate. The original plan, by the Architect GL Cunliffe was to provide a village institute, two places of worship, a school and plenty of open spaces and recreation grounds. The design was inspired by the Garden City Movement and was planned as a Garden Suburb. In the first year, 44 properties were completed; numbers 63-69 Acton Gate, numbers 149-167, Chester Road (originally called Bryn Acton) and Cunliffe Walk. These first house were designed by Sutcliffe and the remaining 205 by Thomas Alwyn Lloyd, architect to the trust. One of the pioneering features of the development was that the tenants were also investors in the Company thus ensuring control of future development. Unfortunately, with the advent of World War I, the development lost impetus and no further development was undertaken by Wrexham Tenants Limited. The planned shops, churches, institute and school were never built, although St Margaret's church was built in 1928, partly to the original design of Thomas Alwyn Lloyd. In 1955, Wrexham Tenants Limited was wound up and the properties sold to the tenants at greatly reduced prices of between ¬£250 and ¬£450.

Early life He was the second son of Alexander Brown and his wife Sarah Benedict Brown, daughter of James Brown. His elder brother was Sir William Richmond Brown, 2nd Baronet, the High Sheriff of Northamptonshire, and his younger brother was the Liberal politician Sir Alexander Brown, 1st Baronet. His paternal grandfather was the banker and merchant Sir William Brown, 1st Baronet. Brown was educated at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he graduated with a Master of Arts. Career He was elected to the House of Commons at a by-election in 1876 for Horsham in Sussex, and held the seat until his defeat at the 1880 general election. Brown served as lieutenant-colonel of the 1st Lancashire Royal Garrison Artillery and on his retirement in 1884, was granted the rank of an honorary colonel of the 2nd Brigade, Lancashire Division. He was a Justice of the Peace and in 1888, he was appointed High Sheriff of Sussex. Personal life On 21 March 1866, he married Amelia Rowe, daughter of Charles Rowe and Sarah Amelia Pfeiffer. His father-in-law Charles Rowe (1819‚Äì1876) was born in Jamaica and was of mixed race, an Octoroon in the parlance of the time, as the son of planter Charles Rowe, Sr. and his 28-years younger mistress Mary Gauntlett (b. 1782), \\"a free Quadroon\\" who owned slaves herself. Mary Gauntlett was born out of wedlock to Elizabeth Roche (De La Roche, Delaroche; 1761‚Äì1812), a half black woman described in 1795 as \\"a free mulatto\\", and Lieutenant William Gauntlett; Elizabeth Roche was the daughter of Mary, \\"a freed Negro\\" born around 1740, and white planter John De La Roche. His mother-in-law was born in Lima, Peru in 1825 to Friedrich (Frederick) Pfeiffer, an Hanoverian-born flour merchant, and his Quakeress wife who left her sect to join her husband's faith; the Pfeiffers moved to Lima in 1821.Ulrich Muecke (ed.), The Diary of Heinrich Witt, Vol. 1, p. 101, pp. 156‚Äì157, pp. 190ff.Alfonso W.

The term is also applied to the covering of scale insects. The related Latin term testa is used for the hard seed coat of plant seeds.  Etymology  The anatomical term \\"test\\" derives from the Latin testa (which means a rounded bowl, amphora or bottle). It is distinct from the term \\"test\\" as in \\"examination\\", which derives from testis, related to the idea of testimony.  Structure  The test is a skeletal structure, made of hard material such as calcium carbonate, silica, chitin or composite materials. As such, it allows the protection of the internal organs and the attachment of soft flesh.  In sea urchins  Test of a sea urchin. The test of sea urchins is made of calcium carbonate, strengthened by a framework of calcite monocrystals, in a characteristic \\"stereomic\\" structure. These two ingredients provide sea urchins with a great solidity and a moderate weight, as well as the capacity to regenerate the mesh from the cuticle. According to a 2012 study, the skeletal structures of sea urchins consist of 92% of \\"bricks\\" of calcite monocrystals (conferring solidity and hardness) and 8% of a \\"mortar\\" of amorphous lime (allowing flexibility and lightness). This lime is constituted itself of 99.9% of calcium carbonate, with 0.1% structural proteins, which make sea urchins animals with an extremely mineralized skeleton (which also explains their excellent conservation as fossils).  In foraminiferans  Foraminiferan tests. The test of foraminifera, a group of single-celled organisms, is extremely evolutionarily diverse. Many different methods of constructing the test are present, from lacking a test in Reticulomyxa, proteinaceous tests in the \\"allogromiids\\", agglomerated tests made from foreign particles in many groups including textulariids, silica tests in silicoloculinids, and aragonite or calcite tests in many forms including miliolids and rotaliids. It can be of many types, including proteinaceous, agglutinated (exogenous agglomerate), porcelain-like (smooth calcite) or hyalin (lens). Foraminifera with multi-chambered tests are referred to as multilocular and develop by building new chambers in their test. These are arranged according to a geometry particular to each species: they can be rectilinear, curved, rolled up or cyclic, uniserial or multiserial. These organizational types can also be mixed, or even more complex. Miliolids have a particular arrangement of chambers known as \\"milioline\\". The surface of the test can be smooth or textured, and may be perforated with small holes.  In ascidians  In ascidians the sheath is sometimes called test as well, and is composed largely of a particular type of cellulose historically termed \\"tunicine\\". From 1845 (when this was discovered by Schmidt) until 1958 (when cellulose fibres were found in mammalian connective tissue), ascidians were believed to be the only animals that synthesised cellulose.Endean, The Test of the Ascidian, Phallusia mammillata, Quarterly Journal of Microscopical Science, Vol. 102, part 1, pp. 107-117, 1961. Other terms  On a strictly scientific point of view, the term \\"test\\" should be restricted to the hard shell protecting sea urchins and foraminiferans. For sessile echinoderms (like crinoids, but also many fossile groups such as cistoids or blastoids), the correct word is \\"theca\\". For diatomea, the term in use is \\"frustule\\", and for radiolarians it should be \\"capsule\\". The more common word \\"shell\\" is used for mollusks, arthropods and turtles (even if the latter ones belong to the order \\"Testudines\\").

Preston then served as a missionary in northern California until later that year when he led a company of Latter-day Saints to Utah Territory, responding to the call to gather in anticipation of the Utah War. Among those in Preston's company gathering to Utah was Moses Thatcher. Thatcher's sister Harriet A. Thatcher was also in this company, and the following February Preston married Harriet Thatcher. In 1859 Preston was among the first settlers of Logan, Utah. He was made bishop of Logan in November 1859. Beginning in 1862, Preston served as a member of the Utah territorial legislature. From 1865 to 1868 Preston served as a missionary in England. The next winter he spent as a sub-contractor working on the Union Pacific Railroad. He served as a member of the territorial legislature again from 1872 to 1882 and continued to serve as bishop of Logan after his return from England. In 1871, he became presiding bishop over Cache County, succeeding Peter Maughan, the first holder of this office, who had just died. Preston served as vice-president of the Utah and Northern Railway (the president was John W. Young), which was key to further economic development of Cache Valley. In 1877, Preston became first counselor to Moses Thatcher in the presidency of the Cache Stake. From 1879 to 1884, Preston served as president of the Cache Stake.

During his term in office, d'Anethan was responsible for directing the Belgian reaction to the Franco- Prussian War. D'Anethan and the king agreed a programme whereby the King's favoured military reforms--in particular the abolition of Remplacement conscription--would be implemented, along with an agreement not to institute electoral reforms. He served as Foreign and War minister in his own government. D'Anethan was obliged to include in his cabinet ministers who were opposed to the abolition of Remplacement which led to conflicts with the King.

Boarding is the entry of passengers onto a vehicle, usually in public transportation. Boarding starts with entering the vehicle and ends with the seating of each passenger and closing the doors. The term is used in road, rail, water and air transport (for example, passengers board a coach). Aviation At commercial airports, a boarding call on the public announcement system asks travelers to proceed to the departure gate and board the aircraft. This can begin any time from an hour to thirty minutes before departure (depending on the size of the plane and number of passengers). For boarding an aircraft, airstairs or jetways are used. Small aircraft may carry their own stairs. Airlines control the access to the aircraft by checking passengers' boarding passes and matching them with the list of passengers and their identification cards. Many airlines use the IATA standard Bar Coded Boarding Passes (BCBP) to automate this process. A 2D bar code is scanned and the data are sent to the airline's system to look up the list of passengers. If the passenger is entitled to board, a positive message is sent back to the airline agent. Boarding in air travel is supervised by ground personnel. The pilot is responsible for the boarding as soon as the doors are closed because by law the aircraft is then \\"in flight\\".(Treaty of Tokyo 1964, Title III, Section 5 Chapter 2) After boarding, the taxiing and takeoff will follow in most cases. Image:Cologne Bonn Airport Terminal C5.jpgBoarding bridge to an aircraft via a jetway at the Cologne Bonn Airport in 2001. Image:B737-500.Economycabin.jpgHaving boarded, passengers stow their cabin baggage - Lufthansa Boeing 737-500. Boarding patterns and efficiency Most North American airlines have assigned seating, but Southwest Airlines does not. Southwest boards passengers in A, B, and C groups depending on their ticket purchase date. Across North American airlines, it is standard to allow early boarding for passengers with mobility impairments, those with small children, and first class passengers. All airlines allow passengers in premium cabins or with elite status to board earlier, with some offering it to coach customers for a fee. Several boarding patterns by seating location are possible: * Back-to-front by row * Outside-in by column (window, middle, aisle = \\"Wilma\\") * Block boarding (outside-in within a zone, with zones ordered back-to-front) * Reverse pyramid (combines back-to-front with outside-in) * Rotating zone (alternating back-to-front and front-to-back segments) * Random Efficiency considerations to minimize overall boarding time include: * Whether passengers have to wait to pass other passengers in the aisle * Whether passengers have to cross already-seated passengers in aisle and middle seats * How many people can be storing luggage and taking their seats at the same time Competing considerations include: * Encouraging specific behaviors (paying more, self-service, checking in earlier, buying earlier) * Whether families and friends can board together * Passenger stress with regard to who gets what seat and competition for overhead bin space Computer simulations indicate that the outside-in and reverse-pyramid patterns should be fastest, followed by block and random, followed by back-to-front and rotating zone. American Airlines found in a two- year study that randomized boarding was faster than outside-in. Despite this, most North American airlines use the back-to-front pattern. Another proposed method to speed boarding is to have passengers sort themselves by row and seat while still standing in the waiting area. Television series MythBusters examined various boarding techniques in their 2014 episode \\"Plane Boarding\\" and found the standard back-to-front system to be the slowest among the tested. Pre-boarding As the process of controlling and verifying boarding passes and identity documents takes non-negligible amounts of time and as some airlines aim to reduce turnaround times, the process of \\"pre boarding\\" is increasingly employed. In this process, passengers enter a separate area after having their boarding pass inspected before the plane is ready to be boarded and once actual boarding commences passengers simply enter the plane. Water transport In water transport a boarding onto a watercraft can be done while it is located in harbour or at sea. Image:CBP female officers going aboard a ship.jpgOfficers board a ship using a gangway. File:tourist boat at sa calobra (majorca spain) arp.jpgTourists board a boat in Majorca (Spain) for a coastal trip from Sa Calobra to Port de Soller Buses Passengers board buses in the United Kingdom by either indicating to the bus driver they want to board (by queueing at the bus stop or by holding out an arm) or by boarding when a bus has stopped at a bus station. Once on board passengers can either purchase a ticket for their journey or they can show a travel pass (such as an Oyster card when passengers travel on London buses). On long distance buses in Europe tickets are usually checked upon boarding whereas in Latin America fares or tickets are collected on the moving bus by an assistant to the driver.

The cyclone caused significant damage to the town of Port Hedland and numerous isolated mining camps around the town. Losses in Northern Territory amounted to at least A$12 million (US$9.5 million). Two people died and more than a dozen others were infected in a melioidosis outbreak following the Northern Territory floods. Insured damage in Western Australia amounted to A$8 million (US$6.2 million), and there were 3 fatalities. Meteorological history On 24 February 2007, an area of low pressure began consolidating over the Arafura Sea. By 26 February, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) warning centre in Darwin classified the system as a tropical low with its centre situated northwest of Nhulunbuy. Over the following days, the system meandered around the Top End region and showed signs of gradual organisation. Initial forecasts depicted the low as moving gradually eastward and becoming a significant cyclone over the Gulf of Carpentaria; however, after approaching Milingimbi Island on 1 March, the system doubled back to the west in response to a subtropical ridge over central Australia. Though overland, the cyclone remained well-organized (a typical occurrence for tropical lows over Top End). Deep convection blossomed on 2 March, as the system approached the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf. Owing to favourable upper-level outflow and decreasing wind shear, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system that day. The agency estimated the formation of a tropical depression, assigning it the identifier 17S, by 00:00 UTC (9:30 a.m. ACST) on 3 March while it was still over land. Hours later, the low emerged over the Gulf and acquired gale-force winds while situated south-southeast of Oenpelli. In light of this, the Darwin warning centre initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone George, marking the first time since Cyclone Fay, in 2004, that the Darwin office named a storm. George quickly intensified once offshore, with a very small banding eye of approximately in diameter appearing on SSMI satellite imagery, and gained winds of 95 km/h (60 mph) by 18:00 UTC (3:00 a.m. AWST on 4 March). The system subsequently made landfall in the Kimberley region of Western Australia at that intensity hours later. Substantial structural degradation took place over land, with the eye feature dissipating, and the BOM estimated the system to have briefly weakened to a tropical low before emerging over the extreme eastern Indian Ocean late on 4 March. Once offshore, George regained tropical cyclone strength as it moved steadily west away from Australia. Intensification was slow due to a lack of outflow and increased wind shear. Over the following few days, most forecast models indicated that George would gradually turn to the south as it rounded the subtropical ridge and possibly strike areas between Exmouth and Onslow by 9 March. The models continued to indicate this scenario through 6 March, resulting in a high-confidence forecast from the Perth warning centre. Infrared satellite image of Severe Tropical Cyclone George near peak intensity shortly before its landfall near Port Hedland on 8 March. However, on 7 March George took an abrupt, nearly 90 degree left turn through a weakness in the ridge and began moving almost due south. This turn caught meteorologists almost entirely off-guard, with only the United Kingdom Met Office ensemble model depicting this scenario. Post- storm reviews of the forecasting failure pointed toward four factors that may have influenced George at the time but were not initialised by the models: the extratropical transition of Cyclone Humba well upstream over the Indian Ocean, a Fujiwhara interaction with Cyclone Jacob to the northwest, the Beta drift effect, and poorly represented monsoonal flow. Of these factors, the monsoonal flow was determined to have been the main cause in the poor track forecast as models did not capture the degree of influence of these winds on the cyclone. This resulted in the forecast track for George having the greatest error of any cyclone in the Western Australian region in at least five years. The average error of at 48 hours was comparable to the average accuracy of forecasts in the 1980s. Coinciding with George's turn south was a notable improvement of environmental factors. Wind shear, previously inhibiting organisation, began to decrease while a nearby upper-level low enhanced the system's outflow. The favourable condition allowed for an increase in both strength and size, with both the BOM and JTWC estimating the cyclone to have attained hurricane-force winds by 12:00 UTC (8:00 pm. AWST) on 7 March. By early on 8 March, George featured an area of gale-force winds spanning nearly across, significantly larger than average. A large cloud-filled eye soon developed before a sudden period of rapid intensification ensued. During this phase, the cyclone's eye steadily contracted to a minimum diameter of roughly . Between 09:00 and 10:00 UTC (5:00‚Äì6:00 pm. AWST) on 8 March, George passed directly over Bedout Island. As the eyewall moved over the island, a record- breaking ten-minute sustained wind speed of was measured. This marked the highest ten-minute wind measurement officially recorded in Australia. Based on the extreme winds measured on Bedout and additional intensification thereafter, George was estimated to have reached its peak intensity at 12:00 UTC (8:00 pm. AWST) with winds of 205 km/h (125 mph) and an estimated barometric pressure of 902 mbar (hPa; 26.64 inHg). Automated Dvorak classifications from the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies at University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison peaked at 6.8, equivalent to a high-end Category 4 on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale, as the storm moved ashore. At 10 p.m on 8 March, Cyclone George made landfall north-east of Port Hedland. When it made landfall, it was still at its peak intensity. Damaging wind gusts of were recorded at Port Hedland Airport weather station just before 11 pm. The anemometer failed shortly afterwards. At 00:12 a.m on 9 March, an air pressure reading of was recorded at Port Hedland Airport; this was lowest recorded at the airport during the passage of the cyclone. George weakened slowly while over land and it was downgraded to a Category 3 late on 9 March. The next day, the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre in Perth issued its final warning for the system. George's remnants continued drifting southeastward and then southward over the next 3 days, before dissipating on 13 March, in southern Australia. Preparations Cyclone George resulted in numerous schools and ports in Port Hedland being closed down to deal with the severe cyclone.WA towns brace for cyclone, The Australian.

Impact=Northern Territory Effects from the precursor low to George in Northern Territory As a developing tropical low, George produced prolonged heavy, in some cases record-breaking, rain across much of Northern Territory in late February through early March. The most prolific rains took place as the system strengthened and began moving away from the region. In a five-day span, numerous areas saw more than a month's worth of precipitation. Several towns and cities saw single-day rainfall records for March shattered by the system most notably Jabiru Airport with falling on 1 March, more than three times the previous highest. Other places that broke daily records include Adelaide River, Black Point, Channel Island, Elizabeth Valley, Howard Springs, Mango Farm, Oenpelli, Territory Wildlife Farm, Thorak Cemetery, and Walker Creek. The tremendous rains also resulted in many areas seeing their wettest March on record. Widespread flooding resulted from the rains in the region, with some areas becoming isolated by 2 March. Extensive damage was incurred by region's roadways, with losses reaching A$12 million (US$9.5 million). Officials referred to the effects of the flooding as the worst in 40 years. Portions of the Kakadu and Arnhem highways were shut down, with the latter expected to remain so for a week. Throughout the Top End region, a collective 101 bridges and roads were closed due to flooding. Workers at the Ranger Uranium Mine in Jabiru were forced to camp out at the mine as floodwaters overtook the area. The mine's pit was inundated and forced to shut down for nine days while processing had to be suspended for two weeks. The resulting loss in production cost Energy Resources of Australia 300 tonnes (330 tons) of uranium. According to resource analysts, the negative impacts of the flood in addition to lingering effects from Cyclone Monica in 2006 would result in a two percent decrease in the global supply of uranium by 2008. Economic losses sustained by the Energy Resources of Australia were estimated to reach A$200 million (US$158 million). At least one house nearby was submerged. Just south of Jabiru, 35 people were airlifted from the Gagudju Lodge in Cooinda. Helicopters were used to drop food to personnel stranded at outstations in the Kakadu National Park. Severe storms in the park spawned a rare tornado near the Mary River Ranger Station. The wide twister levelled trees and destroyed caravans along a path. In some cases, trees were even debarked. Based on the damage, the tornado was estimated to have had winds between . Severe thunderstorms battered Darwin on 3 March with frequent lightning, torrential rain, and destructive wind gusts up to 120 km/h (75 mph). Downed trees and power lines left 10,000 residents without electricity and flooded roadways isolated some in suburban areas. Flight delays were common at Darwin International Airport, while two had to be cancelled. Four people in Adelaide River required rescue from their home. Debris from flooding in the town left main street and a nearby bridge impassible. The most severe flooding took place in Oenpelli which saw roughly of rain in less than a week. Evacuation of 90 people from 47 homes in the town took place on 3 March as rising waters from the local billabong became contaminated with sewage. Residents initially attempted to protect their homes with sandbags but waters rose too fast and over-topped the barrier. Waters reached halfway up homes in the lowest lying areas, with high tide expected to reach on 4 March. Waters began subsiding in the town by 6 March, though low-lying areas remained partially submerged. More than 60 homes sustained flood-related damage. The local school and its library sustained extensive damage, with the latter being damaged beyond repair. An estimated 350 of the 1,400 cattle kept in paddocks near the community were swept away during the flood; at least 70 were known to have drowned by 7 March. Western Australia Cyclone George was the most powerful cyclone to hit Port Hedland since Cyclone Joan in 1975. The cyclone's peak intensity of 902 hPa (26.64 inHg) with wind gusts of up to was estimated following Dvorak analysis of satellite imagery. Power and telephone lines were down in Port Hedland, many roofs and fences were torn down and trees were uprooted.Cyclone George, The Geelong Advertiser, 9 March 2007. At least one house was destroyed. The Pilbara region was declared a disaster zone, and the Australian Defence Force was on standby to provide extra help. At around 10 p.m on 8 March, the Bureau of Meteorology's Port Hedland weather radar was damaged by the cyclone and was offline for nearly a day. Tropical Cyclone Jacob struck almost the same area as George only three days later, although it was not as damaging or deadly as George. It did however cause some minor flooding.Tropical Cyclone Jacob Impacts, Australian Bureau of Meteorology, 5 March 2007.

Aftermath=Northern Territory Starting on 7 March, the Gunbulunya Health Clinic in Oenpelli began warning residents of a possible melioidosis outbreak resulting from the floods. They urged residents to wear shoes and wash their hands before eating to avoid infection. More than a dozen people contracted the disease over the following weeks, with two dying as a result. Three others were hospitalised in the Royal Darwin Hospital. Reconstruction of roads in and around Darwin began by 9 March; however, portions of the Arnhem Highway remained under water. The Department of Planning and Infrastructure stated that a bridge would have to be constructed over the West Alligator River where a culvert collapsed. The A$1.2 million (US$950,000) bridge was completed on 5 April and allowed Arnhem Highway to completely re-open. Repair work on roads continued for more than a month, with additional rains in the following weeks creating additional potholes. A week after the floods, there was some concern over a delay in aid from the government; however, authorities assured that supplies would be provided in a timely manner once need assessments were complete. The Salvation Army began collecting supplies for the 90 people rendered homeless by 13 March with additional requests for assistance made to the Australian Red Cross. Shipments of supplies to Oenpelli began on 20 March, with a total of 14 flights scheduled over two days. The airlifts brought more than A$200,000 (US$158,000) worth of goods, consisting of mattresses, blankets, sheets, refrigerators, washing machines, and stoves, to the community. Western Australia Cyclone George weakening inland over Western Australia on 9 March On 9 March, Prime Minister John Howard announced that persons injured by the storm or those whom lost their home would be eligible for funding through the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment program. The initiative ultimately provided 530 people with a collective A$630,000 (US$497,700) in aid. After Cyclone George struck the Pilbara coast, a relief fund was set up to help the victims of the storm. Mining companies, business, and residents all donated money to assist with the cause, and within 48 hours the town of Port Hedland was able to raise just over A$520,000 (US$410 in 2007; $ USD).Money pours into cyclone George relief fund, ABC News Online, 16 March 2007. BHP Billiton also helped recover Port Hedland by giving the local government $1 million A$ each year which will fund for a large part of an enhancement scheme with the Western Australian State Government to improve the town's appearance. Schools in South Hedland remained closed due to safety concerns about the damage caused by cyclones George and Jacob until 19 March, after the local community joined in a massive clean-up.BHP Billiton offers funds advancement for cyclone-hit Port Hedland , ABC News Online, 19 March 2007. In commemoration of the deaths that took place, the Fortescue Metal Groups commissioned the McNally Newton Landscape Architects to construct a memorial in South Hedland. Acclaimed sculptor Ron Gomboc designed a twisted, steel monument for the project. The memorial was opened in March 2009, two years after the storm. =Lawsuits= The Australian Workers' Union (AWU) launched a scathing attack on the Fortescue Metals Group Ltd, saying they were disgraced that no evacuation took place before the cyclone hit. The AWU were also concerned about the buildings at the campsite as they were only built to withstand a Category 2 cyclone. Almost all of the buildings located at the camp site were destroyed. Fortescue and its subsidiary the Pilbara Infrastructure (TPI) were charged with a combined 18 counts of failing to provide or maintain a safe workplace over Cyclone George and appeared in Perth Magistrates Court.'No peace' for family after Fortescue cleared of cyclone deaths, WA Today, 18 February 2011.

Lagerstroemia indica is an often multi-stemmed, deciduous tree with a wide spreading, flat topped, rounded, or even spike shaped open habit. Planted in full sun or under canopy, the tree is a popular nesting shrub for songbirds and wrens. In the United Kingdom, Lagerstroemia indica has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit. Description Crape myrtle blooming near the United States Capitol Inflorescence The bark is thin and about 2mm. thich, smooth, pinkish- gray and mottled, shedding each year. Leaves also shed each winter, after spectacular color display, and bare branches re-leaf early in the spring; leaves are small, smooth-edged, circular or oval-shaped, and dark green changing to yellow and orange and red in autumn. Flowers, on different trees, are white, pink, mauve, purple or carmine with crimped petals, in panicles up to .

Low maintenance needs make it a common municipal planting in parks, along sidewalks, highway medians and in parking lots. Like the southern magnolia, the crape myrtle has come to symbolize the American South because of its extensive planting and ability to thrive in hot, humid summer climates with regular precipitation. It is one of only a few trees/shrubs to offer brilliant color in late summer through autumn, at a time when many flowering plants have exhausted their blooms. In arid climates, it requires supplemental watering and some shade in the very hottest areas.The plant must have hot summers in order to flower successfully, otherwise it will show weak bloom and is more vulnerable to fungal diseases. Frequently L. indica is root hardy to Zone 5 (-10 ¬∞F/-23 ¬∞C), meaning it will be killed back during harsh winters but regrow from the roots and flower in summer. As such Northern gardeners treat it more like a perennial than a tree or shrub. Too much watering and over-fertilizing can decrease the cold hardiness because it stimulates new growth late in the season that does not have time to harden off. Lagerstroemia indica is frost tolerant, prefers full sun and will grow to with a spread of . The plant is not picky about soil type but does require good drainage to thrive. Once established it is also quite drought hardy, though it benefits from the occasional deep watering during the summer months. 15 hybrid cultivars have been developed between L. indica and L. fauriei by the US National Arboretum for increased cold-hardiness and resistance to disease, all given the names of Native American tribes. There are also dwarf cultivars of indica √ó fauriei cross-breeds and regular L. indica species, which grow . Range Lagerstroemia is a common planting in South Atlantic States and is becoming an increasingly common shrub in Mid-Atlantic states all the way up through the coastal areas of Massachusetts. Lagerstroemia also thrives in the Mediterranean and Desert climates of Southern California, Arizona and Nevada, and also in Australia as a street plant. Diseases In the Southern U.S. mildew and fungal diseases have traditionally posed problems for L. indica. This was a major motivation for developing the L. indica √ó L. faueri hybrids, which show increased resistance to powdery mildew and fungus. The fungal pathogen Cercospora lythracearum can infest the plant in summer during hot, rainy weather and cause premature leaf drop. Gardeners plant resistant hybrid varieties or use fungicide sprays to help control this. Insect problems with Lagestroemia indica include the crape myrtle aphid, Tinocallis kahawaluokalani, which can cause yellow spots and black mold, Japanese beetles, and the flea beetle. None of these insects are fatal to the plant and other predator insects are usually enough to resolve infestations; however applications of insecticidal soap can also be helpful. Crape myrtle topping During the winter, gardeners will often lop off the branches of large specimens, to manage size and encourage more profuse summer bloom. This is colloquially known as \\"crape murder\\" because of the drastic pruning involved, leaving a bare trunk during the winter and early spring. Tree topping of crape myrtles is a common occurrence but is not recommended nor endorsed by many professional standards or arboricultural organizationshttps://www.saiglobal.com/PDFTemp/Previews/OSH/AS/AS4000/4300/4373-2007.pdf. In culture In 1983, Hinako Sugiura started a manga series titled Sarusuberi, after the Japanese name of the plant.

Note that the color of the star used in the flags is plain yellow, instead of the yellow- fimbriated blue star as dictated by law. The shade of blue used in this version is the same as that of the current shade of blue (royal blue) in the Philippine flag, which was only made official in 1998. However, when the specifications for the Bohol flag were described in 1969 the shade of blue of the Philippine flag was navy blue; most official versions of the Bohol flag use navy blue. The Flag of Bohol is a vertical triband bearing the three main colors of the Philippine flag, with the white field usually being wider than the blue or red stripes. According to the official interpretation of the flag's symbolism, the color blue represents nobility; white, purity; and red, courage. Charged on the white field is the main portion of the seal of Bohol, depicting the island's history and famous landmarks: on the foreground is a tableau of the Sandugo between Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi and Datu Sikatuna which symbolizes the \\"Boholano's love of peace,\\" while behind this are the Chocolate Hills and a field of green, symbolizing the province's natural beauty and agricultural resources. Flanking this scene are the two barongs (swords) representing the Tamblot Uprising and the Dagohoy Rebellion, whose tips meet at the bottom of the emblem. A blue five-pointed star, fimbriated yellow, appears above the central emblem; on all physical versions of the flag the star always appears on the observer's right, whether on the obverse or reverse side. The lone star represents Carlos P. Garcia, the only President of the Philippines to come from Bohol: his tenure as Philippine president (1957‚Äì1961) was originally represented by a yellow star on the original provincial flag; a smaller blue star \\"superimposed\\" on the yellow star was added in 1971 after Garcia was elected president of the 1971 Constitutional Convention, even though he died the day after he took his oath. Another star is meant to be added for every Boholano that becomes President of the Philippines. Bohol is one of the few Philippine provinces to have a distinctly-designed flag, deviating from the standard flag design of the provincial seal on a colored field. The flag has a proportion of 1:2, the same as the flag of the Philippines. The flag was adopted as the provincial flag through Provincial Board Resolution No. 238 on 28 October 1969. The current version of the flag, with a blue star \\"superimposed\\" on the yellow star, became official with the adoption of Provincial Board Resolution No. 121 in 1971.

The film marked the first appearance of Hay with Graham Moffatt and Moore Marriott acting as his straight men, however both Moffatt and Marriott had previously acted separately in films starring Hay, namely in Dandy Dick and Where There's a Will, respectively. Plot Ben Cutlet is a retired barge captain who entertains his bar room audience with tales of his alleged days at sea, although his maritime experience extends no further than navigating a coal barge. His tall tales catch him out when he is conned into commanding the unseaworthy Rob Roy to the West Indies by a gang of criminals who mean to scuttle the ship for the insurance money. Cutlet gets the upper hand however when he and his companions fall in with West Indian natives who mistake their radio set for a god.

Recursively axiomatizable first-order theories that are consistent and rich enough to allow general mathematical reasoning to be formulated cannot be complete, as demonstrated by G√∂del's first incompleteness theorem. This sense of complete is distinct from the notion of a complete logic, which asserts that for every theory that can be formulated in the logic, all semantically valid statements are provable theorems (for an appropriate sense of \\"semantically valid\\"). G√∂del's completeness theorem is about this latter kind of completeness. Complete theories are closed under a number of conditions internally modelling the T-schema: *For a set of formulas S: A \\\\land B \\\\in S if and only if A \\\\in S and B \\\\in S, *For a set of formulas S: A \\\\lor B \\\\in S if and only if A \\\\in S or B \\\\in S.

Well known former pupils include, amongst others, Deon Chang, journalist; Eddie Barlow, South African international cricket star; Richard Sterne, professional golfer; Tony Peake, novelist; and Elon Musk, business magnate, founder of SpaceX and CEO of Tesla Motors.  History = 1923  Waterkloof House Preparatory School has grown substantially from its small beginnings in 1923 with a total of twelve pupils to a prestigious preparatory school for boys, currently opening its doors to more than 400 pupils every year. The original Brooklyn House Preparatory School was located on the south-east corner of MacKenzie and Alexander Streets in Brooklyn without electricity or modern conveniences.  1925  To cope with the rapidly expanding numbers, the school moved to its present seven and a half acre site on Charles Street (Justice Mahomed Street), then known as Bailey's Avenue early in 1925.  1946  The Ruddells ran this private boys school until 1946 and established the relaxed teacher-pupil relationship coupled with firm but fair discipline, which have become part of the school's tradition. The school was bought by Mr Wilfred MacRobert when the Ruddells retired in 1946. WHiPS, as the school eventually became known, was virtually a family institution for the 18 years that Mr MacRobert was associated with it.  Past Headmasters = The Ruddell Brothers 1923‚Äì1947  Frederick J Ruddell (‚ÄòMister‚Äô) and Captain Ernest Ruddell (‚ÄòCappy‚Äô), twin sons of General and Mrs Ruddell (a one time Colonel of the Royal Scots,) Founders and Headmasters of Waterkloof House Preparatory School, initially known as Brooklyn House Preparatory School, or more familiarly, ‚ÄòRuddells‚Äô. At a time when South Africa was still recovering form the traumas of the Great War and the devastating strike on the Rand in 1922, when General Smuts was Prime Minister, a brand new four-seater motor car could be purchased for ¬£190 and family houses in Arcadia were selling for ¬£1 500, the Ruddell brothers opened their Preparatory School for boys on Friday, 2 February 1923, with a total complement of twelve day boys (¬£6-2-0d per term) and two boarders (¬£25 per term.)  Miss Meffis ‚ÄúMa‚Äù Lloyd 1927‚Äì1950  Writing the 1942 School magazine, Captain Ruddell recorded: ‚ÄúThere are very few boys who passed through Ruddells in the ‚Äòthirties‚Äô and ‚Äòforties‚Äô who will not recall with great affection Miss Meggis Lloyd, a member of staff since 1927. Before closing these notes I wish to record a special word of appreciation to Miss Lloyd for her unfounding help and co-operation in all that concerned the welfare of the school. During these difficult times, caused by changes of staff as, one by one our teachers have joined the Forces, Miss Lloyd has been ever ready to step into the breach and to give whole-hearted help wherever possible.‚Äù  Dudley Gower, (Oxon) FRGS, 1947‚Äì1949  Joining the school of a little under 100 boys in 1943, Dudley Gower immediately established himself as a play writer and producer of note, producing no fewer than four successful plays in his first year. An innovative, selfless man, he introduced many worthwhile changes including the introduction of SG 1 and 2, more efficient timetabling, fortnightly report cards and daily report forms. He succeeded to Headmastership in 1947 on the express wish of Wilf MacRobert who was to succeed him three years later. It was during Dudley‚Äôs first year as a headmaster that WHPS experienced its first ‚Äòstrike‚Äô! The shock to the boys (parent's) of General Smuts and his United Party's unexpected loss of the first post-war election was too much for the boys to tolerate! At the end of 1949, Dudley Gower resigned and returned to England. ‚ÄúHis going will be a great loss to the school and to me personally,‚Äù acknowledged Wilf.  Wilfred MacRobert, MA (Rhodes), 1950‚Äì1968  ‚ÄúThose of us who have been closely associated with him during the past few years, know well the outstanding ability and hours of hard work which he gave so selflessly to the welfare of the school. Many of his ideas and innovations in the general routine of the school will be of permanent value to us. We will miss him most though for the man he is, a man of character and ideals with the courage of his convictions, a fine sense of humour and one who invariably put himself last.‚Äù With the retirement of the Ruddells at the end of 1946, they offered the Headmastership to Wilfred MacRobert, an old boy, who at the age of 27 years felt that he was too young and inexperienced to become a headmaster having only joined the school in 1946. ‚ÄúMr Dudley Gower (who had joined the school in 1943) agreed to act as headmaster until I was ready to take over. This was an altruistic act of Dudley‚Äôs for which I shall always be grateful.‚Äù WHPS had now grown to a staff of 9 teachers and 144 pupils, at which time Grade 1 and Grade 2 classes were established.  Michael M Quail, BA Hons (RAU), 1969‚Äì1973  It fell to Michael Quail to uphold the proud record and traditions established by the previous headmasters. Michael was supported by his wife, Blanche, herself a university graduate and teacher of English, Art, Drama and a playwright who brought vigour into classrooms and onto the hockey fields. It was during the Quail era that WHPS entered into a period of transition and consolidation. The Transvaal Education Department's Curricula and schemes of work were introduced and, following a referendum of parents, Standard 6 classes were abandoned. Seven new classrooms were built during his headmastership, which included improved facilities for science, art exhibitions, and a museum under the organisation of Dr and Mrs Robbie Macmillan. Woodwork classes were introduced and with a library expanded to 2 226 books, compulsory half hour weekly library periods were introduced for all classes. Enrolment of pupils in the Golden Jubilee Year of 1973 stood at 160 day boys and 40 boarders. Midway through the school's 50th anniversary year, which was celebrated with a ‚ÄòGrand Fete,‚Äô Michael Quail resigned his position as Headmaster.  Michael de Lisle, MA (UCT) MA (Oxon) UED (Rhodes), 1973‚Äì1980  Michael de Lisle ‚Äì a Rhodes Scholar ‚Äì and his wife, Mary Beth, took over the school in July 1973, halfway through its Golden Jubilee Year, and saw it through a difficult time when numbers were declining. It was in this period that the move to spare land at St Alban's was promoted by the School Council but rejected by the Old Boys. The school community, in which the Old Boys‚Äô Association was prominent, undertook a concerted effort to keep the school's independence. What eventually made it possible for the school to stay was the re-establishment of standards and the slight rise in numbers that was de Lisle's achievement. Michael de Lisle's headmastership was extremely distinguished, as was the man himself. Extracts from the school magazines that follow attest to this. The contribution of his wife must not pass without mention. It was a time when the school was academically strong and an atmosphere of quiet discipline prevailed. A very fine staff was assembled that stood the school in good stead long after Michael de Lisle retired. It was a time, too, when the outdoor activities on the Macmillan and Junod farms became a notable feature of the school life. When he retired, Michael de Lisle began a new career as an Anglican Priest.  Patrick Hamilton, MA Cantab, 1981 ‚Äì 1989  It was during a period of indecision and uncertainty of the future of WHPS that Patrick Hamilton was invited to assume the headmastership of his old school where he was once headboy (1953). . Patrick, in idea-a-day man and communicator, was involved with everything from tending the grounds, re- writing the syllabus, insisting on academic excellence, sportsmanship, writing and acting in school plays and introducing many ideas, for example, Project Term, After School Care Centre, Ruddell Theatre, Ikageng and Art Alive, which the school continues to benefit from to the present day. Not the least of his innovative ideas was Wilf's! Adult literacy classes were soon to follow for the domestics, gardeners and workers from the local neighbourhood. Leaving the school in 1989 to establish the Project for the establishment of Pre-Primary and Primary Schools, (PEPPS), he would have been well satisfied to have heard the comment from a parent attending family fun day, ‚ÄúI have never experienced such a feeling of happiness at a school before.‚Äù  Gavin Sinclair, Teachers Certificate Rhodesia, BA Unisa, 1990‚Äì1999  The school has been blessed with some outstanding Headmasters in the past, and the choice of Gavin Sinclair to lead the school through the last decade of the 20th century proved to be a wise decision. Married to Mary, who served St Mary's DSG with distinction, and the father of three fine children, Gavin grasped the nettle and launched himself into all facets of school and community life. Educated in Rhodesia, he was deputy headmaster of The Ridge School in Johannesburg immediately prior to accepting the headmastership of WHPS. Inspired by his Council-supported overseas study tours, which included the UK and United States, WHPS could now boast Design and Technology, Computer and Music Centres to international standards. No fewer than 30% of the school's pupils were now playing musical instruments. The formation of a school orchestra was initiated whilst the choir continued to grow in numbers. The boys of WHPS under Gavin's leadership continued to learn the values of discipline, fair play, good manners, empathy for others, integrity and a sense of fun, all of which would equip them well to cope with the challenges of the future. Gavin made his own mark on WHPS that protected its ethos whilst firmly entrenching it as a leading preparatory school for boys in South Africa.  Tim Jackson 2000‚Äì2002  Tim Jackson, his wife Robyn, and sons, Christopher and Matthew, joined WHPS at the turn of the new millennium. Tim was a fatherly figure who noticed every boy at WHPS, knew his name and made him feel that School was his home. A good communicator, Tim initiated a weekly newsletter, featuring a tongue-in-cheek cartoon of himself at the time, which today still serves as a useful communication medium with the parents. Tim?s approach to leadership was that of ‚Äúconserve and innovate‚Äù, i.e. maintaining WHPS? values and traditions while introducing new concepts such as the school's Education Forward Plan and a Practical Maths Centre for the boys. Tim also introduced the WHPS Code of Conduct and ‚ÄúA Pupil‚Äôs Rights and Responsibilities‚Äù to assist the boys in embracing a sound value system that will remain with them for the rest of their lives. During his term of office, WHPS entered the new millennium in fine style with the inauguration of the Waterkloof House Theatre, a magnificent legacy funded by parents, Old Boys and friends of the School. Tim and his wife left WHPS to teach at a school in Botswana.  Doran Herringer 2003‚Äì2009  A graduate of Port Elizabeth, Doran Herringer has spent the greater part of his professional career at WHPS as a teacher, cricket coach, deputy headmaster and headmaster (as from 2003), supported by his wife, Dee. A man of action who strives to get results, Doran has driven and supported a number of projects at WHPS: the establishment of the pre-prep with the introduction of girls (up to Grade 00) for the first time in the school's history; the conversion of a house in Nicholson street into the new Grade 0 block; and the installation of a new pool for the Junior Primary. The introduction of smartboards in every classroom at WHPS during 2005 was a milestone, while every teacher plugged into a computer and linked to email and the internet. An exciting event was the realisation of Doran's dream to install state-of-the-art turf cricket nets at WHPS in 2005 and the first-ever overseas cricket tour, during which the WHPS First XI won eight out of ten games against the UK teams. Doran retired at the end of 2009 and with 36 years of service to the school.  Old Boys Association  Since 1923 thousands of boys have moved through WHPS classrooms. In most instances Waterkloof House Preparatory School left an indelible mark on the boy that helped form the man that he became. Unusually for a Prep School many ex-WHPSians choose to maintain their contact with their Prep School and become members of the WHPS Old Boys‚Äô Association. This is group of men who return to their Alma Mater and who keep the school's best interests close to their heart. They raise funds for the school, arrange social functions to further the fellowship of the school and participate in sports events such as the annual Old Boys Soccer and Cricket days to further strengthen the bonds between the old boys and the young boys. Over the years the WHPS Old Boys have made contributions to the development of the school and the campus, including building the squash courts, financing the new cricket nets, etc. They actively support the bursary fund making monies available for deserving children who have been in the school for no less than two years and who are in need of financial assistance to attend this private school for boys. They have also contributed to the school by being ambassadors the for the school. WHPS boys have gone on to become the head boys and prefects of all the prestigious High Schools in South Africa. They have represented their Country at sport and have led South African businesses onto the world stage. Actors, singers, fashion designers to name but a few, have all been moulded by the ethos of WHPS. Many of them return with their own children, who in turn, take advantage of what the school offers. At the annual Grade 7 Leavers‚Äô Dinner all the Grade 7 boys are handed their Old Boys‚Äô tie and 5 years later when they matriculate from High School they are all invited back for a Prawn braai and their first beer in Wilf's ‚Äì fully fledged WHPS Old Boys! Of course, not all Old Boys have become leaders or world players. However, they are all part of the ever-growing WHPS family and they have all made their own contribution to WHPS for which the School is always grateful and ever proud.

It was a single-engined biplane of mixed construction, with a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Design and development The A2N was originally developed as a private venture by Nakajima for the Imperial Japanese Navy. It was based loosely on the Boeing Model 69 and Boeing Model 100, examples of both having been imported in 1928 and 1929 respectively. Takao Yoshida led the design team. Two prototypes, designated Navy Type 90 Carrier-based fighter in anticipation of Navy acceptance were ready by December 1929. Powered by Bristol Jupiter VI engines, these were rejected, not being regarded as offering a significant improvement over the Nakajima A1N. Jingo Kurihara carried out a partial redesign and another prototype, the A2N1, powered by a 432 kW (580 hp) Nakajima Kotobuki 2, was completed in May 1931. The type was adopted by the Navy in April 1932. In 1932, Minoru Genda formed a flight demonstration team known as \\"Genda's Flying Circus\\" to promote naval aviation and flew this type. A two-seat trainer was later developed from the Navy Type 90 Carrier-based fighter as the A3N1 and 66 of these were built between 1936 and 1939.

The version now broadcast on TV4 Guld consists of episodes cut into 30 minutes each. The plot revolves around a boy who discovers that he is able to pull an infinite number of banknotes from the pockets of his jeans. According to the Swedish Film Database, the plot goes as follows: We follow the boy Mats and his adventures with his father after Mats one day finds a pair of trousers in the attic that bring them unimaginable riches. Mats just needs to slip his hand into his pocket and then he can pull out small denomination bills for as long as he is able to keep going. Initially, they both satisfy only their own personal desires with the money, but gradually Mats' intellect and idealism gains the upper hand and the two together start the firm Nilsson International to utilize the money for good. The biggest problem in the beginning is how to be able to exchange all their small bills into larger denominations without drawing attention. Gradually, it becomes clear that the money is mysteriously connected to money that disappears from bank vaults and cash transports. Soon, newspapers and radio news feature stories about the authorities' efforts to reveal the \\"man without fingerprints.\\" Mats and his father, Torkel, then establish the \\"Fund for Orphaned Children\\" and fly to a developing country in Africa to donate large amounts of money there. However, the recipients do not always react the way the two had intended. Mats and his father are hunted and eventually tracked down by financiers who want to stop the uncontrolled outflow of money. Alas, after an alcohol-fuelled evening, the father lets the truth slip to a German journalist, and Mats is finally caught by three hired villains who force him to give up his golden trousers, who then burn them. There the story ends for now, with the desperate Mats shouting that they can expect that there will be more boys with golden trousers.

Murray was granted land near Juniper Green, outside Edinburgh, in 1612. Between 1622 and 1623 he designed and built Baberton House as his home here. The innovative symmetrical u-plan house still stands, although it was extended in the 18th century. Murrays initials, together with those of his wife, Katherine Weir, appear on the house. King James gave orders for repairs to the royal palaces in Scotland in 1616, anticipating his visit in 1617. At Holyrood, Murray was to take down and repair the roof of the lodging above the outer gate called the Chancellor‚Äôs Lodging, demolish the lodging in the Palace of Holyrood House called the Master Steward‚Äôs chamber, rebuild Roger Aston's chamber and Chancellor Maitland's kitchen in the Duke's transe, and demolish lean-to buildings to improve the courtyard. At Stirling Castle, he was to demolish buildings between the inner and outer gate, re-roof the inner gate or fore-work, re-roof the king's kitchen, and rebuild the court kitchen, bakehouse, and pantry. At Falkland Palace, he was to re-roof the king's and queen's galleries overlooking the garden from the east quarter, and make a bartisan or wall-walk on a new lead roof, and repair the whole palace, making repairs and new doorways and windows as required.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1613-1616, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1891), pp. 517-8.

In February 1619 Murray received permission to demolish part of the remaining masonry adjacent to the north-west corner.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1894), p. 522. November 1619 there was a dispute amongst his workforce at Linlithgow, the Privy Council of Scotland intervened and the mason John Service was imprisoned in the Tolbooth of Edinburgh, and ten other masons were ordered to work for Murray under the conditions he set. Murray was asked by the Privy Council to calculate how much lead would be needed to cover the roof of the new north range at Linlithgow, and he arranged to buy 3,000 stone weight of lead from an Edinburgh merchant.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1895), p. 120, 335.

Murray drew up plans for Parliament House in Edinburgh in 1633, and the building was constructed to his design over the following years. As Master of Works he was also in charge of works at Linlithgow Palace, the reconstruction of Holyrood Palace prior to the coronation of Charles I, and additions to the Great Hall at Edinburgh Castle. In 1633, at the coronation of Charles I, Murray was knighted. He died in December of the following year.

The conference name was derived from Article 2 of the charter for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change The conference explored the possible impacts at different levels of greenhouse gas emissions and how the climate might be stabilized at a desired level. The conference took place under the United Kingdom's presidency of the G8, with the participation of around 200 \\"internationally renowned\\" scientists from 30 countries. It was chaired by Dennis Tirpak and hosted by the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research in Exeter, from 1 February to 3 February. The conference was one of many meetings leading up to the 2015 Paris Agreement, at which the international community agreed to limit global warming to no more than 2C in order to have a 50-50 chance of avoiding dangerous climate change. However, a 2018 published study points at a threshold at which temperatures could rise to 4 or 5 degrees through self-reinforcing feedbacks in the climate system, suggesting it is below the 2 degree temperature target. Objectives Global carbon dioxide emissions through year 2004 average surface temperature 1880 to 2015, with a zero variance point set at the average temperature between 1961 and 1990 The conference was called to bring together the latest research into what would be necessary to achieve the objective of the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change: :to achieve, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Convention, stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. It was also intended to encourage further research in the area. In the 2001 IPCC Third Assessment Report, an initial assessment of the subject had been included; however, the topic had received relatively little international discussion. Specifically, the conference explored three issues: *For different levels of climate change what are the key impacts, for different regions and sectors and for the world as a whole? *What would such levels of climate change imply in terms of greenhouse gas stabilisation concentrations and emission pathways required to achieve such levels? *What options are there for achieving stabilisation of greenhouse gases at different stabilisation concentrations in the atmosphere, taking into account costs and uncertainties? Conclusions Among the conclusions reached, the most significant was a new assessment of the link between the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the increase in global temperature levels. Some researchers have argued that the most serious consequences of global warming might be avoided if global average temperatures rose by no more than 2 ¬∞C (3.6 ¬∞F) above pre-industrial levels (1.4 ¬∞C above present levels). It had generally been assumed that this would occur if greenhouse gas concentrations rose above 550 ppm carbon dioxide equivalent by volume. This concentration was, for example, informing government in certain countries, including the European Union. The conference concluded that, at the level of 550 ppm, it was likely that 2 ¬∞C would be exceeded, according to the projections of more recent climate models. Stabilising greenhouse gas concentrations at 450 ppm would only result in a 50% likelihood of limiting global warming to 2 ¬∞C, and that it would be necessary to achieve stabilisation below 400 ppm to give a relatively high certainty of not exceeding 2 ¬∞C. The conference also claimed that, if action to reduce emissions is delayed by 20 years, rates of emission reduction may need to be 3 to 7 times greater to meet the same temperature target. Reaction As a result of changing opinion on the 'safe' atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases, to which this conference contributed, the UK government changed the target in the Climate Change Act from 60% to 80% by 2050.

Her style was partially inspired by American singers of the 1950s. Simultaneously, it was in the spirit of the modal jazz scene going down in Europe in the 1960s. Mostly, Carola's jazz repertoire consisted in idiosyncratic versions of American songs in English, while her most famous jazz track \\"The Flame\\" was an original composition by Esa Pethman and the lyrics by the singer herself. As the vocalist for Esa Pethman's quartet and Hazy Osterwald's sextet in the early 1960s, Carola made fame in Finland and Sweden, and toured Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Switzerland. Her most significant recording is a session with the Heikki Sarmanto Trio from 1966, which the Finnish Music Information Centre considers among the original blueprints of Finnish jazz. Carola's recordings have been credited for the accosting tone of her contralto voice and her phrasing. The singer also co-produced the groovy approach of her supporting orchestras. In late 1960s and early 1970s, she performed in nine languages and a wide variety of styles, including chanson, schlager, Latin, rock'n'roll, and soul. After her death of Alzheimer's disease in 1997, Carola's music was revived in 2004 with two Best of albums and Carola & Heikki Sarmanto Trio reaching the Finnish charts. Biography Carola Christina Standertskj√∂ld was born on 23 March 1941 to Elin Christina Fazer and Johan Standertskj√∂ld, into a Swedish-speaking noble family in Helsinki. They left the harsh Finnish post-war conditions and settled in Switzerland. From a very young age Carola was interested in learning foreign languages. Later her family moved to Spain, where her first public jazz performance took place; she also performed the French chansons at school parties and small occasions, accompanying herself on the acoustic guitar. Jazz career (1962‚Äì1966) When Carola returned to Finland, she was spotted by Esa and Anssi Pethman, brothers who led a jazz quarter that was popular in Finland and Sweden in 1962. As the lead singer of Esa Pethman's quartet, Carola gained fame in Sweden, Poland and Czechoslovakia in 1963 and released her first track in Finland.: the Jewish folk song \\"Hava Nagila\\", published by the RCA as the B-side of Laila Halme's version of \\"Telstar\\". After leaving Esa Pethman's quartet Carola became the vocalist for the Swiss Hazy Osterwald Sextet. During 1964 she toured the Central European scene and performed on television programs. Returning to Finland in 1965, Carola released a single in German, \\"Warum Willst Du Das Alles Vergessen\\" and also performed with a backup band, The Boys, who mostly recorded cover versions of songs in the English language, including the Rolling Stones' \\"The Last Time\\" and Skeeter Davis' \\"The End of the World\\".

In 1966, Carola returned to performing jazz music. As the vocalist of the Heikki Sarmanto Trio, she gave a number of concerts in Finland and recorded a session in the studios of Yle on 5 June 1966. Yle considered the material as uncommercial, aired the tracks once on Finnish radio, and shelved them.Carola & Heikki Sarmanto Trio. Liner notes.

Retirement (1975‚Äì1997) In the mid-1970s, tired of living constantly in the public eye, Carola retired from the music industry and concentrated on work in her husband Georg Liemola's grocery store. Throughout the 1970s, she made selected appearances at jazz clubs in Helsinki, including performances with the UMO Jazz Orchestra. Carola made a comeback in 1980 by publishing the Latin style album Maria, Maria, receiving a golden record certificate in Finland. After that, she refused to appear to audiences. In 1985, Carola was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. In 1987, Carola gave an exclusive concert with the UMO Jazz Orchestra and two years later one with pianist Iiro Rantala. In the early 1990s, she performed alone at a few charity concerts. After her long battle with the disease, Carola died on 12 November 1997 in Kirkkonummi. Artistry On stage, Carola used to devote herself totally to singing and living within the music, usually oblivious of her audience. The Finnish public usually reacted to her concentrated act, accusing her of being drunk. Carola enjoyed being on stage, but after her shows she usually felt depressed by and unsatisfied with her voice and performance. Jazz singer Carola had a deep voice and an accosting manner without frills, concentrated on the phrasing.Carola & Heikki Sarmanto Trio (In Finnish).

Malkin began his professional career at Tranmere Rovers, whom he joined from Stork on a free transfer in 1987. He spent eight years at Prenton Park, forming a successful partnership with John Aldridge upon his arrival from Real Sociedad in 1991, halfway through Malkin's stay on the Wirral. A couple of months earlier Malkin scored the winning goal at Wembley Stadium to win the Division Three play-off final against Bolton Wanderers. At Tranmere he was also part of the side that won the 1989-90 Football League Trophy. After over 200 league appearances and 60 goals for Rovers, Malkin joined Millwall in 1995 for a ¬£400,000 price tag. In fifteen months at the Den, he scored thirteen goals in a half-century of league appearances for the Lions. In 1996, Malkin moved back north, joining Gary Megson's Blackpool for ¬£275,000, becoming the Seasiders' record signing (which he remained until 2008). An injury-prone period at Bloomfield Road meant he made only 65 league appearances and scored six goals for the Lancashire club in just under three years. Blackpool didn't receive any return on their record outlay when, in August 1999, Nigel Worthington let the forward join Telford United on a free transfer. Malkin joined Chester City as player- physio in 2001, and a year later moved to Oswestry Town, with whom he finished his career. Malkin now works as a physiotherapist at Spire Murrayfield Hospital in Wirral, helping patients back to fitness. He previously had spells as club physio for Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest.

He served as King's Master Mason under James VI. From 1615, Wallace is known to have been the leading mason working on the King's Lodgings at Edinburgh Castle. On 18 April 1617 he was appointed King's Master Mason, holding this post until his death. Wallace was commissioned in 1618 to rebuild the north range of Linlithgow Palace, which had collapsed in 1605. He was responsible for design as well as building, and executed the new range in an Anglo-Flemish style, which he helped to popularise in Scotland.Colvin, p.862 He followed this with works to Winton House, near Pencaitland, for George Seton, 3rd Earl of Winton, which he undertook from 1620 to 1627.Buildings of Scotland:Lothian by Colin McWilliam In 1621 he was made a burgess of Edinburgh, and later served as Deacon of the Edinburgh Masons Lodge. From 1628 until his death Wallace was engaged on the design and construction of Heriot's Hospital, a school, again in the Anglo- Flemish style. He was almost certainly the principal designer of the building, which was continued after his death by William Aytoun. One of Wallace's last works was carving the monument to John Byres of Coates in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh, unpaid for at his death, and his will also includes debts for works at Moray House for the Countess of Home. In addition, Pinkie House and the original, unexecuted, design for Drumlanrig Castle have been attributed to Wallace on stylistic grounds, although no documentary evidence exists to confirm his involvement.
