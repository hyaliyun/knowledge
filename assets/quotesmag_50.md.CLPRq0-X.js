MindMeister was launched in 2007 by MeisterLabs GmbH, a software company founded by Michael Hollauf and Till Vollmer. After 10 years in the market, MindMeister has more than 7 million users who created more than a billion ideas to date. Overview MindMeister provides a way to visualize information in mind maps utilizing user modeling, while also providing tools to facilitate real-time collaboration, coordinate task management and create presentations. By using cloud storage, MindMeister users can share updates in mind maps in real-time with other users across in-browser and mobile apps. Mind maps can be shared both privately with an unlimited number of users or publicly. MindMeister is based on a freemium model, with a basic account available free of charge, providing limited functionality. The commercial model is built upon 4 different pricing levels with a choice of monthly or yearly subscription- charges. These pricing plans are titled Basic, Personal, Pro and Business. For use in the education sector, 3 different functional levels are available. The aim of MindMeister is to enable individuals to collaborate on a mind map, where everyone can share ideas, comments and plans, as well as vote on ideas in real-time. MindMeister allows users to share and edit mind maps, leave comments and feedback, attach files, images, videos, and link to external, as well as internal sources, via embedded URLs. Mind maps can be shared with colleagues internally or externally via an email invitation to collaborate, or via a hyperlink. Mind maps can also be turned into interactive presentations.  Development  Screenshot of the 2008 MindMeister mind map editor The idea behind MindMeister was first devised when the two founders, Michael Hollauf and Till Vollmer, were working together using Writely, which had been recently acquired by Google Docs, and the mind mapping tool MindManager. At the time, MindManager had to be installed locally, which made it hard to share mind maps externally or with anyone who had not installed the software. While using Google Docs and MindManager together, the idea was born to combine the two, forming a collaborative online mind mapping tool which could be easily shared and edited, via the cloud. In 2015, MeisterTask was released. A Kanban board- style collaborative Task management-application for agile teams that tightly integrates into the technology and methodology of MindMeister.  Milestones  * In 2006, MindMeister's first prototypes were created, in which mind maps were developed with 1x1 px DIVs * On February 7, 2007, MindMeister was released as a private beta. In the same year, MindMeister was awarded the Red Herring 100 Europe Award. * In 2008, MindMeister 2.0 was released. In this release, the History View was added. * In 2009, 5 additional languages were added and, with the advent of the iPhone, MindMeister for iOS was released. * In 2010, MindMeister was added to the Google Apps Marketplace and the first native version for iPad was released. * In 2011, MindMeister for Android was released and the presentation mode was integrated in the online version. * In 2012, MindMeister integrated with Google Drive. * In 2013, MindMeister Groups were introduced and MindMeister integrated with Google Hangouts. * In 2014, the add-on for Google Docs were released and MindMeister became a Google Cloud Premier Partner. New features released include Comments and Votes, New Map Layouts and Video Support. * In 2015, an integration to BiggerPlate was added as well as Geistesblitz for the AppleWatch.

History Barcelona. Metr√≤polis Mediterr√†nia (B.MM) was first published in 1986 under the editorship of the journalist Joan-Anton Benach Olivella as a magazine featuring information and debate dedicated to monitoring the evolution of the city of Barcelona. Benach defines the magazine as a library of urban culture, as it has contemplated Barcelona's transformation from different perspectives ‚Äìurbanistic, architectural, sociological, communicational and in regard to the new technologies ‚Äì and through all the cultural disciplines, from 1986 to 2006. In 2007 the philosophy professor Manuel Cruz became editor. His appointment coincided with the adoption of the magazine's current name, Barcelona Metropolis, and its re-definition as a magazine dedicated to urban information and thought, concentrating on the analysis and verification of the idea that what happens locally in the city has its meaning on a global scale. After the election of the new local government of CIU, the Catalan conservative party (up to present), Manuel Cruz was suddenly not invited to continue editing the magazine, obviously due to ideological reasons. The last issue of the magazine, dealing with \\"new models of family\\" was censored and finally replaced by another one. More details on this controversy on the national scale journal EL Pais, December 3, 2012 First period. Library of urban culture (1986‚Äì2006) The pages of B.MM have been a showcase of many events and trends that have occurred in Barcelona since 1986: initiatives, projects, debates, cultural and artistic endeavours, preservation of heritage and history, creators, architecture, communication, etc. The magazine has covered the city's great urbanistic transformation from the proclamation of Barcelona's candidacy for the 1992 Olympic Games to the conception of the new Districte 22@ and Diagonal-Mar. The magazine was launched by the local government with the goal of its being a public service in sharing knowledge in a way not done by private initiative. The 69 issues of this first phase of the magazine constitute an extremely useful reference collection about Barcelona available through the Internet in Catalan and Spanish. Second period. Magazine of urban information and thought (2007 ‚Äì the present) In 2007 Barcelona Metr√≤polis changed course, taking into account the heritage of the first phase, with a view to expanding the scope of the topics previously dealt with, adding new subjects of focus, discourses and with new sensitivities. The most visible change was the inclusion of the subtitle Magazine of urban information and thought, a declaration of principles which, in Manuel Cruz's words, seeks to invite the reader to reflect on the content of cities, which have become exceptional spaces of reality, the settings for maximum collective intensity, in which the most significant part ‚Äì both good and bad ‚Äì of everything that affects us takes place. In this sense, Barcelona Metropolis looks at the city as a phenomenon in which what occurs in the local sphere is also, at the same time, a reflection of what happens on a global scale. According to Manuel Cruz, ‚Äúthe city is made up of the web of situations and conflicts shared by a set of individuals determined to live together, and it is nothing over and above or beside this network‚Äù. Starting out from these premises, the present Barcelona Metropolis aspires to offer a space for the reflection that this life in common carries with it. Appearing three times a year, the magazine is published in hard copy in Catalan and Spanish with a print-run of 3,000 copies, and in an electronic version that can be consulted on the website in Catalan, Spanish and English. The Central Notebooks From the very beginning right up to the present, this section has given Barcelona Metr√≤polis its specific character. The Central Notebooks deal in depth with interesting issues to do with what is going on in regard to culture and heritage in Barcelona. Some of the Central Notebooks include the following titles (available in Catalan via the links indicated below): First period * Hist√≤ria i actualitat del disseny gr√†fic a Barcelona (History and Present of Graphic Design in Barcelona) * L'Exposici√≥ de 1888 i la Barcelona de fi de segle (The 1888 Exhibition and Fin-de-Si√®cle Barcelona) * Barcelona i la passi√≥ modernista (Barcelona and the ‚ÄúModernista‚Äù Passion) * El teatre barcelon√≠, avui (Theatre in Barcelona Today) * Ciutat Vella: l'hora decisiva (Ciutat Vella: the Decisive Moment) * El primer segle del cinema catal√† (The First Century of Catalan Cinema) * Josep Pla i Barcelona (Josep Pla and Barcelona) * Una cursa cap al cim, centenari de l'atletisme barcelon√≠ (A Race to the Top.

However, the total elevation uncertainty is at least ¬±3 m due to the global error in the areoid. Gullies Chincoteague Crater displays gullies on its wall. Many ideas have been put forth to explain them. For many years, many researchers thought they were made by recent liquid water.Malin, M., Edgett, K. 2000. Evidence for recent groundwater seepage and surface runoff on Mars. Science 288, 2330‚Äì2335. However, with more observations, other mechanisms became possible. It was observed that new gullies were forming today during the Martian spring when dry ice was able to sublimate (turn from a solid to a gas). Chunks of dry ice could accumulate in the cold winter months and then slide down when warmed. In the thin atmosphere of the planet they would ride on a cushion of gas that was coming off the pieces of dry ice.http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-226http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_032078_1420http://www.space.com/26534-mars- gullies-dry-ice.html  See also  * List of craters on Mars  References  Category:Impact craters on Mars Category:Cebrenia quadrangle ","title":"Chincoteague (crater)"},{"id":"26588987","text":"One of the first basilika issued, with a seated Christ and the standing figures of Andronikos II and Michael IX holding a labarum between them. The legend reads ŒòŒïŒï ŒíŒüŒóŒòŒïŒô AYTOKPATOPEC PWMAIWN (\\"God aid the emperors of the Romans\\").. The basilikon (, \\"imperial [coin]\\"), commonly also referred to as the ' (Greek: Œ¥ŒøœÖŒ∫Œ¨œÑŒøŒΩ), was a widely circulated Byzantine silver coin of the first half of the 14th century. Its introduction marked the return to a wide- scale use of silver coinage in the Byzantine Empire, and presaged the total abandonment of the gold coins around the middle of the century. History Silver Venetian ducat (Matapan) of Francesco Dandolo, ca. 1328. The similarity of the iconography with the basilikon is evident. The basilikon was introduced shortly before 1304 by Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282‚Äì1328), in direct imitation of the Venetian silver ducat or grosso, chiefly to pay the mercenaries of the Catalan Company.... The Byzantine coin closely followed the iconography of the Venetian model, with a seated Christ on the obverse and the two standing figures of Andronikos II and his son and co-emperor Michael IX Palaiologos (r. 1294‚Äì1320) replacing St. Mark and the Doge of Venice on the reverse. The similarity was reinforced by the name of the new coin: the ducato, the \\"coin of the doge\\", became the basilikon, the \\"coin of the basileus\\", although the contemporary Greek sources usually call both . The basilikon was of high-grade silver (0.920), flat and not concave (scyphate) as other Byzantine coins, weighing 2.2 grams and officially traded at a rate of 1 to 12 with the gold hyperpyron or two , the traditional rate for Byzantine silver coinage since the days of the hexagram and the miliaresion.; . The actual rate, however, was usually lower, and fluctuated depending on the changing price of silver: contemporary sources indicate actual rates of 12.5, 13, or 15 basilika to the hyperpyron.; . Examples of half-basilika are also known to have been minted.. In the 1330s and 1340s, however, the basilikons weight was much reduced, as a result of a silver shortage affecting all of Europe and the Mediterranean, falling to 1.25 grams by the late 1340s. It ceased to be struck in the 1350s, and was replaced circa 1367 with the new, heavier stavraton.

She is the founder of the dyslexia charitable organisation, Xtraordinary People. Her public speaking has ranged from the last Conservative Party Conference to appearances on TV & Radio. Biography Griggs founded Xtraordinary People and united the leading British dyslexic charities in support of her campaign to get teachers trained to recognise dyslexia and provide effective support as well as highlight the many talents and abilities that dyslexics have. Her campaign was supported by a number of well known dyslexics including Richard Branson, Jamie Oliver, Orlando Bloom and Robbie Williams. Griggs stood against the Education Secretary Ruth Kelly in the 2005 election. Since 2005 Kate has worked extensively with Government including giving evidence to the Education Select Committee SEN Review, ‚ÄòRose Review on Reading‚Äô, the ‚ÄòRose Review on Dyslexia‚Äô and the 2020 Personalised Learning Review. She has also written for the Commons/Lords House Magazine, Conservatives Crossbow magazine and is regularly featured in national newspapers and TV appearances including GMTV, BBC1, BBC Breakfast, Newsnight, Channel 4, Sky and 5 News. In 2006, BBC1 produced a 1-hour documentary about her work in a South London ‚Äòsink‚Äô school, working with 11-year-olds who had failed their SATS and gone off the rails. After support from the charity, all children made dramatic progress. In April 2007 Griggs was awarded the ‚ÄòSMK Social Inclusion Award‚Äô presented in Downing Street by Gordon Brown, patron of SMK, the awards charity. In May 2007 the DCSF funded Xtraordinary People‚Äôs ‚ÄòNo to Failure‚Äô project which demonstrated the need for effective support for children with dyslexia in UK schools. Their report, released in 2008, found 55% of children failing SATS to be at risk of dyslexia. In September 2008, Griggs spoke at the Conservative Party Conference, highlighting the educational needs of dyslexics. Xtraordinary People In 2004, Griggs formed Xtraordinary People. XP is a charitable initiative supported by famous dyslexics and leading dyslexia charities alike. Its main aim is to reframe the way people think about dyslexia, highlighting dyslexic children's talents and strengths. Xtraordinary People has been instrumental in reforming the Education System, specifically campaigning for teachers to be trained to recognise and support dyslexic children's abilities and difficulties. In March 2007, Xtraordinary People's 'No to Failure' report revealed that 55% of children who fail their Standard Assessment Tests (SATS) are at risk of dyslexia or specific learning difficulties (SpLD). In May 2008, Xtraordinary People released the 'Spelling it Out' report highlighting the cost to the nation of not dealing with dyslexia. It found that ¬£1.8bn is wasted each year that Government fails to ensure schools meet the needs of dyslexic children. Xtraordinary People called for Government to follow the example of independent schools by investing in tried and tested dyslexia specialists, as research indicates dyslexia and Specific Learning Difficulties (SpLD) is one of the biggest reasons for educational failure in this country, affecting as many as one in five children. In 2008 the Government announced that Sir Jim Rose would undertake a review into how dyslexic children are being supported in schools The report was published in June 2009 and supported the need for early identification of dyslexia and intervention by dyslexia specialists. The Government accepted the reviews findings and allocated ¬£10 million on a national program to provide 4000 dyslexia specialist teachers. They estimate one teacher to every 5 schools. Awards In April 2007 Griggs was awarded the ‚ÄòSMK Social Inclusion Award‚Äô presented in Downing Street by Gordon Brown, patron of SMK, the awards charity Media In the 2005 Party Elections, Griggs stood against then Education Secretary, Ruth Kelly to focus the Government‚Äôs attention on how schools were failing dyslexics. The resulting media attention made a significant difference to Griggs‚Äô campaign, affording her the opportunity to speak out on behalf of dyslexic children and their parents. In 2005, Griggs appeared on GMTV to challenge Professor Julian Elliott about his claims that dyslexia was a myth. In 2006, BBC1 produced a 1-hour documentary about her work in a South London ‚Äòsink‚Äô school, working with 11-year-olds who had failed their SATS and gone off the rails. After support from the charity, all children made dramatic progress. In January 2007, Griggs was quoted in The Times in an article about funding for Special Needs Children. In November 2007, Griggs was quoted in The Times in an article claiming that research showed that Entrepreneurs in Britain are twice as likely to be dyslexic as the general population, but are much less likely than their American counterparts In March 2008, Griggs was quoted in The Times in an article discussing the fact that half of children who fail key school tests are likely to have dyslexia or other learning difficulties. In January 2009, Griggs was quoted in The Times and The Guardian, when Graham Stringer, the Labour MP for Manchester Blackley, wrote in his column for Manchester Confidential magazine: ‚ÄúDyslexia is a cruel fiction, it is no more real than the 19th-century scientific construction of ‚Äòthe aether‚Äô to explain how light travels through a vacuum.‚Äù References Category:Living people Category:People from Somerset Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Kate Griggs"},{"id":"26589018","text":"Alonia may refer to: *Alonia, Messenia, a village in the municipality Aris, Messenia, Greece *Alonia, Pieria, a village in the municipality Pydna, Pieria, Greece *Alonia, Zakynthos, a village in the municipality Alykes, Zakynthos, Greece *Marki Alonia, an archaeological site in Cyprus ","title":"Alonia"},{"id":"26589028","text":"DMACA may refer to: * DMACA reagent or p-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde, a dye used to detect proanthocyanidins polyphenolic compounds in plants * DMACA crystal (or [NH2(CH3)2]3Sb2Cl9), a crystal showing ferroelectric phase transition studied in vibrational spectroscopyRaman studies of ferroelectric phase transition in [NH2(CH3)2]3Sb2Cl9 (DMACA).

In 1990 Phoenix won the Grand Prize at the International Choreographic Competition in Bagnolet for Aletta Collins' piece Gang of Five and was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for the Most Outstanding Achievement of the Year in Dance. Under Artistic Director Margaret Morris, who joined the company in 1991, Phoenix became established on the UK touring circuit and performed internationally particularly in the USA. Highlights in the company‚Äôs performing history during this time include the 1996 Cultural Olympiad in Atlanta, Georgia, where Phoenix were the sole representative of British dance, and the following year, when the company was commissioned to perform at the opening of the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Edinburgh. Following Margaret Morris' departure in 1997, Artistic Director Thea Nerissa Barnes led the company until 2000. In July 1998 Phoenix was commissioned by the BBC to perform with Roni Size at the Windrush Gala concert, which was broadcast nationally.  Phoenix Dance Theatre  Darshan Singh Bhuller was appointed as Artistic Director in 2002 and oversaw a complete rebranding of the company, changing the name to Phoenix Dance Theatre. During his tenure as Artistic Director from 2002 to 2006 Phoenix also began performing in predominantly large-scale venues. He was succeeded as Artistic Director by Javier de Frutos, during whose tenure Phoenix won the \\"Company Prize for Outstanding Repertoire (Modern)\\" in the Critics' Circle National Dance Awards, 2006. In 2007 the company was invited to perform at the 5th International Festival of Contemporary Dance - La Biennale di Venezia, closing the festival with the final performance.  Sharon Watson  Sharon Watson became the seventh Artistic Director of Phoenix Dance Theatre in May 2009, continuing a relationship with the company that stretches over 20 years. She first joined Phoenix as a dancer under the stage name Chantal Donaldson from 1989 to 1997, during which time she choreographed the pieces Shaded Limits and Never Still for the company. She returned to Phoenix in 2000 as Rehearsal and Tour Director, following which she embarked upon a fellowship with the Clore Leadership Programme,\\"Clore Fellows: Sharon Watson\\" , Clore People, The Clore Leadership Programme. while continuing her freelance work mentoring emerging artists, lecturing in vocational dance schools and delivering bespoke training programmes. In 2008 Watson was one of 26 aspiring leaders from around the globe selected to attend Dance East‚Äôs fourth Rural Retreat, an intensive four- day think-tank exploring the challenges of the role of Artistic Directors in the 21st century. Prior to taking up post at Phoenix she also spent eight months as Director of Learning and Access at Northern Ballet Theatre. In 2010 she was named as one of the Cultural Leadership Programme‚Äôs Women to Watch, a list of 50 influential women working in arts and culture in the UK selected by a distinguished panel made up of figures from the cultural and creative industries.  New building  In autumn 2010 Phoenix moved from its home of more than 20 years at Yorkshire Dance into a purpose-built dance centre in the centre of Leeds, alongside Northern Ballet. It is the largest space for dance outside London and is the only space for dance to house a national classical and a national contemporary dance company alongside each another.

It was initially raised in 1915 as part of the all-volunteer First Australian Imperial Force for service during World War I. During the conflict, the battalion saw action briefly at Gallipoli before later fighting on the Western Front between 1916 and 1918. It was disbanded in 1919, but was re-raised in 1921 as part of the Citizens Force, which later became the \\"Militia\\". During World War II the battalion was used mainly in a garrison role until the last year of the war when it was committed to the fighting against the Japanese during the Bougainville campaign. Following the end of hostilities it was disbanded in May 1946. Between 1948 and 1965 the battalion was re-raised and disbanded a number of times before eventually becoming part of the Royal South Australia Regiment. It was disbanded for a final time in 1987, when it was amalgamated with the 10th Battalion, Royal South Australia Regiment to form the 10th/27th Battalion, Royal South Australia Regiment. History=World War I Because of the restrictions that the Defence Act (1903) placed upon deploying units of the Citizens Force overseas, following the outbreak of World War I, the Australian government decided to raise an all volunteer force for overseas service. This force was known as the Australian Imperial Force (AIF). Initially, the AIF was to consist of only one infantry division, but following the despatch of the 1st Division in late 1914 further units were raised and these were eventually organised to form the 2nd Division. As part of the 2nd Division, the 27th Battalion was formed on 16 March 1915 at Ascot Park Camp, Adelaide, from recruits drawn mainly from South Australia, who had originally been allocated to the 24th Battalion. After a period of basic training, the battalion embarked for the Middle East on the troopship HMAT A2 Geelong on 31 May 1915, arriving there on 6 July. =Gallipoli= They then undertook a further two months of training in Egypt before an urgent request for reinforcements led to them being dispatched to join the Gallipoli campaign; they landed at Anzac Cove on 12 September. Attached to the 7th Brigade, along with the 25th, 26th and 28th Battalions, they reinforced the battle-worn New Zealand and Australian Division and took up a defensive position on Cheshire Ridge. Throughout October they defended the ridge, during which time they suffered five killed and 29 wounded, before being relieved by New Zealanders in early November. After this they moved to new positions in Mule Gulley where they undertook further defensive operations alongside the 26th Battalion. Losses during this time amounted to two killed and eight wounded. In December, they took over from the 28th Battalion around Happy Valley, before the decision was made to evacuate the Allied forces from the peninsula. On 12 December 1915, the battalion embarked upon the Osmaliegh, bound for Lemnos Island. Following this the 27th Battalion returned to Egypt, where the AIF undertook a period of training and re-organisation as reinforcements arrived from Australia. During this time the AIF was expanded from two infantry divisions to four ‚Äì with a fifth forming in Australia ‚Äì and many infantry battalions that had seen service at Gallipoli were split up to provide cadre staff for the newly raised battalions. The battalions of the 2nd Division, however, were not split up in this manner and the 27th Battalion remained intact. =Western Front= In early 1916, the decision was made to transfer part of the AIF to Europe to take part in the fighting in the trenches along the Western Front in France and Belgium. Still attached to the 7th Brigade, the 27th Battalion entered the front-line for the first time on 7 April 1916 as the Australians took over a quiet sector near Armenti√®res. On 8 July 1916, the 7th Brigade was ordered to march to the Somme to support the Australian 1st Division which was taking part in the fighting around Pozi√®res. On 28 July, the 7th Brigade undertook an attack on the German line, however, during this time the 27th Battalion was held back in reserve. The attack proved unsuccessful and as a result it was ordered to launch a second attack on 4 August, centred upon German positions around Bapaume. This time the 27th Battalion was to play a key role. Moving off from positions around La Boiselle in the afternoon, the battalion advanced with two companies forward and two back in reserve under the cover of an intense artillery barrage. Due to congestion around the assembly trenches, the battalion arrived at its objective late. Nevertheless, the first wave managed to capture the first line of German trenches and although the follow-up waves became lost amidst thick smoke, the two assault companies began to consolidate their position during the night. In the early morning of 5 August, a heavy German counterattack was launched. This was turned back at considerable cost, with the Germans suffering an estimated 100 men killed and 60 men captured. Following this, the battalion sent out patrols into no man's land as reinforcements were brought up. Later during the day their positions were subjected to heavy shellfire from German guns positioned around Thiepval. Although successful, the attack proved costly with the battalion reporting the following casualties: 40 killed, 289 wounded and 67 missing. Afterwards they were relieved by the 48th Battalion and were eventually transferred to Belgium where they were rested in a 'quiet' sector south of Zillebeke. In early October, the battalion undertook a number of small scale raids on the German line, capturing a number of prisoners, before they were withdrawn from the line on 27 October and transferred back to the Somme where they subsequently took part in two unsuccessful attacks against German positions east of Flers. In January 1917, the 7th Brigade moved into the Le Sars sector where they took over from British units that were holding the line near Mametz. Offensive operations during this time were largely curtailed by bad weather, but on 2 March the battalions of the 5th and 7th Brigades launched a combined attack north of Warlencourt. The initial assault yielded some ground, but the Germans completed a successful outflanking move on the left, which threatened to take the momentum out of the attack. As reinforcements were brought up, the 27th Battalion linked up with the 26th Battalion on its left flank near the Loupart Road and, under the cover of mist, managed to establish a new trench line long and captured a number of prisoners. The battalion's next engagement came on 26 March 1917 when they undertook an attack on Lagnicourt, during which they lost 11 killed and 29 wounded. The 27th Battalion did not undertake a major engagement until 20 September when they took part in the Battle of Menin Road, which resulted in success for the Australians. During the battle, they were committed to the fighting as part of the first wave which routed the German forces. Advancing under a cover of artillery and machine gun fire, the battalion captured a section of the German line known as the 'Blue Line' between Polygon Wood and a position known as the Iron Cross Redoubt. Later, they successfully took part in the Battle of Broodseinde on 4 October, which was their last major offensive action in 1917. A soldier from the 27th Battalion in the trenches at Villers-Bretonneux, July 1918 In early 1918, the 7th Brigade was placed in divisional reserve around Romarin as extreme winter weather conditions set in. At the end of January the brigade was relieved and moved back to Henneveux where it was tasked with covering a length of the line. During this time the 27th Battalion was near full strength, with 43 officers and 993 men, and was positioned between Bellebrune and Cr√©marest. They remained there throughout February and March during which time they undertook training and the men were given leave to visit Boulogne. In March 1918, the Germans launched their Spring Offensive in an effort to bring about an end to the war. The offensive saw considerable tactical gains, and although the Australian Corps missed the opening phase of the offensive as they were out of line at the time, they were brought up in April to help stem the tide of the German advance. As a part of this effort, the 27th Battalion returned to the battlefields of the Somme, as the 7th Brigade relieved the 13th Brigade around the Somme Canal on the night of 7/8 April. At the end of the month they moved to the Camon‚ÄìRivery area. As the German offensive became focused upon Villers‚ÄìBretonneux they were called upon to undertake a supporting role to the Australian counterattack, relieving the 6th Brigade around Ville-sur-Ancre following the 6th's assault on the town. In early June, plans were made for the Australian 2nd Division to attack around Morlancourt in preparation for a more significant attack at Hamel. On 10 June, the battalion advanced on the right of the 7th Brigade's line, capturing the German front line trenches around Morlancourt and wiping out a whole battalion, taking 325 prisoners for the loss of 400 men. On 4 July the battalion undertook a supporting role in the successful Australian attack at Hamel, following up the initial success with a further, albeit small, advance on 8 July. After the German offensive petered out, the 27th Battalion undertook peaceful penetration operations against the German line as the Allies began to prepare to launch their own offensive. On 8 August 1918, the Allies launched their Hundred Days Offensive. During the fighting around Amiens, the battalion was responsible for capturing 200 prisoners as well as a number of machine guns and artillery pieces. They remained in the line throughout August and September, undertaking further attacks at Biaches and Mont St Quentin. Casualties during this time were high and by the end of September 1918 the battalion's strength had fallen to 31 officers and 537 men. Their final engagement of the war came on the night of 3 October 1918, when they took part in the Battle of Beaurevoir. During this battle, the battalion attacked around Prospect Hill, suffering 67 casualties. The following night they crossed the Estrees Road and took up position northeast of Estrees to support the 6th Brigade which was attacking positions beyond Beaurevoir. Following this, the battalions of the Australian Corps were removed from the line for rest on 5 October, after a request from the Australian prime minister, Billy Hughes. They had been severely depleted and were suffering from acute manpower shortages as a result of the combination of a decrease in the number of volunteers from Australia and the decision to grant home leave to men who had served for over four years. Subsequently, when the armistice was signed on 11 November 1918, the Australian Corps had not returned to the front and was still in the rear reorganising and training. With the end of hostilities the demobilisation process began, and men were slowly repatriated back to Australia. The process took a considerable period of time, though, and a large number of men were able to undertake tertiary and vocational training in England and France to prepare for their return to civilian life. Finally, as numbers dwindled, the battalion was disbanded on 4 June 1919. The battalion suffered 762 men killed or died on active service during the war, as well as a further 2,155 wounded. Members of the 27th Battalion received a number of decorations, including: one Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG), five Distinguished Service Orders (DSOs), 20 Military Crosses (MCs) and two bars, 14 Distinguished Conduct Medals (DCMs), 69 Military Medals (MMs) and two bars, five Meritorious Service Medals (MSMs), 21 Mentions in Despatches (MIDs) and six foreign awards. A total of 16 battle honours were awarded to the 27th Battalion for its involvement in the fighting on Gallipoli and the Western Front. Interwar years In 1921, the decision was made to perpetuate the battle honours and traditions of the AIF by re-organising the units of the Citizens Force to adopt the numerical designations of their related AIF units. The 27th Battalion had been recruited mainly from personnel that had served in the 74th (Boothby) Infantry Regiment, and as a result, on 1 May 1921, the 74th's successor units‚Äîthe 2nd and 5th Battalions, 27th Regiment‚Äîwere amalgamated to re-raise the 27th Battalion. Through this link, the 27th inherited the battle honour \\"South Africa 1899‚Äì1902\\". Upon establishment, the battalion formed part of the 3rd Brigade and was based in South Australia where it formed part of the 4th Military District. In 1927, territorial titles were adopted by the units of the Citizens Force, and as a result the battalion adopted the title of the \\"South Australian Regiment\\". It also adopted the motto of \\"Primus inter Pares\\", meaning \\"First Among Equals\\". The following year, 1928, the battalion formed an alliance with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, which were also known as the 27th Regiment of Foot. A year later, following the election of the Scullin Labor government, the compulsory training scheme was abolished and in its place a new system was introduced whereby the Citizens Forces would be maintained on a part-time, voluntary basis only. It was also renamed the \\"Militia\\" at this time. The decision to suspend compulsory training, coupled with the economic downturn of the Great Depression meant that the manpower of many Militia units dropped considerably and as a result the decision was made to amalgamate a number of units. The 27th Battalion, however, did not suffer this fate and in 1938 it adopted the territorial title of \\"South Australian Scottish Regiment\\" and was afforded the right to wear the MacKenzie tartan, after forming an alliance with the Seaforth Highlanders. At the same time it also raised a pipe band. World War II Following the outbreak of World War II, due to the provisions of the Defence Act (1903) which precluded deploying the Militia outside of Australian territory, the government decided to raise an all volunteer force for overseas service, known as the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF). As such while the Militia would provide a cadre for this force, its main role was to provide training to conscripts as part of the compulsory training scheme which was re-established in early 1940. During this time the Militia were called up in cohorts for periods of continuous training and the 27th Battalion, along with the rest of the 3rd Brigade, undertook garrison duties in South Australia as well as running number of training camps designed to increase the nation's preparedness in case of war in the Pacific. With Japan's entry into the war following the attacks on Pearl Harbor and Malaya, the battalion was mobilised for wartime service on 9 December 1941 and transported to Darwin in northern Australia where it formed part of the garrison force to defend against possible Japanese attack. During this time it was based at Winnellie and took part in building defences in the north. Later, in December 1942, the 27th Battalion was transferred from the 3rd Brigade to the 23rd Brigade. This formation had previously been a part of the 2nd AIF, but the loss of several of its battalions when they had been deployed to Ambon, Timor and Rabaul, had resulted in it being re-formed with Militia battalions and the 27th joined the 7th and 8th Battalions to round out its establishment. In March 1943, after having endured several bombings by Japanese aircraft since their arrival in Darwin the previous year, the battalion was replaced in the Darwin garrison and its personnel returned Adelaide for leave. In December, they regrouped on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland for jungle training, as the 23rd Brigade‚Äîthen part of the 3rd Division‚Äîwas converted to the jungle establishment, in preparation for them undertaking active service in New Guinea. Around this time the battalion was gazetted as an AIF battalion, meaning that because more than 65 per cent of its personnel had volunteered for service outside of Australian territory, it could be deployed beyond the limits set out in the Defence Act (1903). A 27th Battalion mortar team during a training exercise in December 1944 In September 1944, the 27th Battalion was deployed to Green Island where they relieved the American troops defending Lagoon Airfield. The Americans were subsequently redeployed to the fighting in the Philippines. In 1945, the battalion moved to Bougainville to take part in the Australian campaign there. Initially, it was tasked with relieving the 55th/53rd Battalion at Laruma River in the central sector of the island in March. In April, the battalion pressed on to Pearl Ridge where they took over from the 31st/51st Battalion and began to carry out patrols in front of the ridge. Over the course of six weeks, the battalion carried out a number of minor attacks and in the process captured several key features before moving to the northern sector of the island on the Bonis Peninsula around Ratsua where they continued to harass Japanese forces through active patrolling and ambushing. This continued until the end of the war in August 1945. Following the Japanese surrender, the 27th Battalion ceased operations and was transported to Torokina, where they had to wait for shipping to become available for repatriation back to Australia to begin the demobilisation process. This process began in October 1945, albeit slowly, and gradually the battalion's numbers decreased as men were repatriated back to Australia or were transferred to other units for further service. Long service men received priority for discharge, while some men volunteered to be transferred to the battalions of the 34th Brigade that were being formed on Morotai Island for service as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan. Finally, on 1 May 1946, the battalion was disbanded. The 27th Battalion lost 22 men killed in action or died and 54 wounded during its service in World War II, the majority of these coming in the final weeks of the war. In addition to the normal campaign ribbons, the battalion's personnel also received a number of decorations for distinguished service and bravery, these included: one DSO, one MC, one MM and 16 MIDs. The battalion received one battle honour for its involvement in the war. Post World War II In 1948, with demobilisation of Australia's wartime army complete, the decision was made to re-raise the part-time forces of the Militia, albeit with the new name of the Citizens Military Force (CMF), on a reduced establishment. The 27th Battalion was re- raised in May 1948, and was once again assigned to the 3rd Division, attached to the 9th Brigade. In 1951, the compulsory training scheme was reintroduced and as a result the size of many CMF units swelled. The song, The Campbells Are Coming, was approved as the battalion's regimental march in 1953. In 1959, the national service scheme was suspended, and as a result numbers dropped once more. Following the introduction of the Pentropic divisional structure in early 1960, the CMF was reorganised and a number of infantry battalions were disbanded or amalgamated together to form six new State-based regiments. As part of these changes, in July 1960 the 27th Battalion was amalgamated with the 43rd/48th Battalion (Hindmarsh Regiment) and 10th Battalion (The Adelaide Rifles) to form the pentropic 1st Battalion, Royal South Australian Regiment (1 RSAR), with the 27th Battalion's personnel forming 'A' and 'B' Companies within this organisation. The 16 battle honours awarded to the 2nd AIF's 2/27th Battalion, which had served in North Africa, Syria, and New Guinea with the 7th Division were entrusted to the battalion in 1961, through the promulgation of Army Order 135. In 1965, the Australian Army's experiment with the pentropic structure was abandoned and the CMF was once again reorganised with many of the pentropic battalions being split once again to form additional battalions. On 1 July 1965, 1 RSAR was split and the 10th, 27th and 43rd Battalions were reformed in their own right as battalions of the Royal South Australia Regiment. On 29 November 1987, the 10th and 27th Battalions were linked to form the 10th/27th Battalion, Royal South Australia Regiment (10/27 RSAR). This unit continues to exist to this day, maintaining the battle honours and traditions of its predecessor units. Alliances The 27th Battalion held the following alliances: * United Kingdom ‚Äì Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers; * United Kingdom ‚Äì Seaforth Highlanders. Battle honours The 27th Battalion was awarded the following battle honours: *South Africa 1899‚Äì1902 (inherited); * World War I: Somme 1916‚Äì18, Pozi√®res, Bapaume 1917, Ypres 1917, Menin Road, Polygon Wood, Broodseinde, Poelcappelle, Passchendaele, Amiens, Albert 1918, Mont St Quentin, Hindenburg Line, Beaurevoir, France and Flanders 1916‚Äì18, Gallipoli 1915‚Äì16; * World War II: Liberation of Australian New Guinea.

He edited the monthly journal La Voix du Congolais from 1945 until 1959. He also served as Secretary of State for Information and Cultural Affairs of the Republic of the Congo (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) in 1960 and then as Minister of Information and Tourism from 1963 until 1964. Bolamba was born to a Mongo family in 1913 in the Belgian Congo. During his education he took interest in French literature and soon thereafter began to write, publishing various works and contributing to Congolese periodicals. He gained public attention in 1939 after winning awards for his writing. In 1944 he was hired by the colonial government to manage its press division, and the following year he was made editor-in-chief of a new publication, La Voix du Congolais. Bolamba held much influence in the city of L√©opoldville and frequently discussed the social implications of colonialism. He also began writing poetry, and in 1956 he released a collection entitled Esanzo: Chants pour mon pays, which articulated his Mongo and Congolese identity. In 1959 La Voix du Congolais ceased publication. Bolamba, a self-described liberal, grew increasingly involved in politics and founded the Parti de l'Ind√©pendance et de la Libert√©. In early 1960 Patrice Lumumba convinced him to join his own party, the Mouvement National Congolais. Though he failed to secure a parliamentary seat in the 1960 elections, he was appointed Secretary of State for Information and Cultural Affairs in the Congo's first independent government. After independence his rhetoric turned sharply against Belgium, and he denounced the country in numerous radio broadcasts. He also began to employ more violent imagery in his writing. In September, President Joseph Kasa-Vubu dismissed him from his post. Under Cyrille Adoula's premiership, Bolamba returned to government work, holding advisory and staffing responsibilities until his appointment as Minister of Information and Tourism in April 1963. He led the ministry until July 1964. He thereafter held press and administrative responsibilities for the office of the presidency, while his output of literature decreased. In 1979 he was given a press position at the state party, the Mouvement Populaire de la R√©volution. He died in 2002.  Biography  Antoine-Roger Bolamba was born on 27 July 1913 in Boma, Belgian Congo to a Mongo family from Coquilhatville. His father was a career soldier in the Force Publique. He received six years of primary education from the Colonie Scolaire de Boma, a school managed by the Fr√®res des Ecoles Chr√©tiennes, before going to the local school for assistant clerks for one year. He then attended the Ecole des Assistants M√©dicaux √° L√©opoldville-Kintambo for two years. Bolamba subsequently worked for 14 years as chief clerk and secretary to the medical director of the Fonds Reine Elisabeth pour l'Assistance M√©dicale aux Indig√©nes. He became a member of the √©volu√© social class. Later, Bolamba married and fathered nine children.  Writing and journalism career  Bolamba performed well as a student, taking keen interest in literature. Despite the low accessibility of books in the Congo during his youth, he managed to read many French classics. He soon thereafter began writing. His first work, L'Echelle de l'Araignee (The Spider's Ladder), was inspired by legend from Congolese oral tradition. In 1939 he won an award from the International African Institute for his writing. He also won the first prize in a contest organised by the Association des Amis de l'Art Indig√©ne for his work Les Adventures de Ngoy, le h√©ros l√©gendaire des Bangala (The Adventures of Ngoy, the Legendary Bangala Hero). His success brought him a considerable amount of public attention. He also contributed articles to several Congolese periodicals, including Band, Brousse, and Nsango ya bisu, the official journal of the Force Publique. In October 1944 Bolamba was hired by the Services d'Information du Gouvernement G√©n√©ral to serve as president of its press section. The following year he was made editor-in-chief of a new monthly journal, La Voix du Congolais, at the behest of Governor-General Pierre Ryckmans. The publication catered to √©volu√©s and was meant to encourage public engagement and literacy. As a journalist Bolamba held considerable influence in the capital of the Belgian Congo, L√©opoldville, and expressed deep insight into the sociological issues of colonialism. He criticised racist elements of colonial projects but advocated for the teaching of French and Latin in Congolese schools, as he believed that instruction in indigenous languages would be of less use. He also stated that boys and girls should be treated equally in the educational system. The Belgian administration promoted his more positive appraisals of the Congolese situation for propaganda purposes. In 1947 Bolamba published Premiers Essais (First Attempts), a collection of poems he had previously printed in La Voix du Congolais. They were influenced by the French Parnassianism that he had read in school. The following year Bolamba released a 176-page paper about African women's issues, entitled Les problemes de l'evolution de la femme noire (The Problems of the Evolution of the Black Woman). In 1949 and 1950 he made submissions to the creative writing contest of the Conference on African Studies at the International Fair in Ghent, though he did not win any awards. In August 1952 he attended the World Assembly of Youth in Dakar, Senegal, as part of the Congolese delegation. In April 1954 Bolamba undertook a cultural mission to Senegal under the sponsorship of the Alliance Fran√ßaise. While there he met L√©on Damas, a French poet whose poetry volume, Pigments, he held in high regard. Two years later Bolamba published another poetry collection, Esanzo: Chants pour mon pays (Esanzo: Songs for my Country). Prefaced by L√©opold S√©dar Senghor, it articulated Bolamba's identity as both Mongo and Congolese. Though all of the poems were written in French, some were set adjacent to Mongo translations. Most of the motifs were inspired by tropical imagery. He attended the Congress of Black Writers and Artists in Paris from 19 until 22 September 1956. La Voix du Congolais ceased publication in December 1959 and he ended his work as an editor. Following Congolese independence in 1960, his imagery became increasingly intense and violent and he expressed it in a stream of consciousness mode. In 1968 he became vice-president of the Committee of Friends of Congolese Art. After the end of the decade he wrote little. In the 1980s he served as a councilor of the Union of Zairean Writers and was a member of the Academia Brasileira de Letras. Though by then he had entirely retired from writing, he was still the Congolese writer most famous abroad. = Critical reception of writing = According to Congolese literary critic Kadima Nzuji Mukala, Bolamba was one of the \\"most important and representative\\" French-language writers in Belgian Africa. However, he posited that, aside from his contributions to journalism, he was \\"not a very prolific writer\\". Nzuji Mukala dismissed Premiers Essais as a \\"clumsy imitation\\" of French poetry of the 19th century. Other commentators criticised the collection as being a mimicry of the writings of European poets such as Paul Verlaine and Maurice Maeterlinck. Nzuji Mukala stated that Bolamba's \\"only intrinsic contribution to the early growth of Congolese literature in French\\" was Esanzo, praising it as \\"a highly original achievement\\". According to V. Klima, K. F. Ruzicka, and P. Zima, \\"His range of ideas is rather limited. He repeatedly praises his native country's march towards freedom, but presents his ideas in variegated, fantastic images.\\" Senghor wrote that Bolamba's poetry was more focused on articulating imagery than espousing ideas. He considered Bolamba to be a N√©gritude poet. Klima, Ruzicka, and Zima disagreed, writing \\"the philosophy and pathos of the Dakar intellectuals are rather remote from Bolamba's way of thinking. He has chosen his own, independent path and only the ideology of post-World War II African nationalism can be said to link him to the N√©gritude writers.\\" Franco-Senegalese poet David Diop believed Esanzo contained nonpolitical poetry and suggested that Bolamba, though aware of the N√©gritude movement, avoided engaging the highly politicised style out of \\"prudence\\". Guyanese critic Oscar Dathorne praised the lyricism of Esanzo and noted the theme of protest against injustice in the work Chant du soir (Evening Song), but concluded that Bolamba was only \\"a minor African poet who utilised some of the techniques of the N√©gritude poets.\\" Africanist scholar Willfried Feuser said, \\"Bolamba's Chant du soir is quite charming, but...his imagery lacks the power and density of his fellow-Congolese from the Brazzaville side of the river, Felix Gerard Tchicaya U Tam'si.\\" Donald E. Herdeck wrote, \\"Bolamba's poetry is often slack and full of trite expressions. Though intensely patriotic, his work generally is not impressive, for it offers neither genuine passion nor visions of a convincing reality.\\"  Government and political career  first Congolese government (pictured). Bolamba frequently advocated for public discussion of the issues of colonisation in the Congo in his editorials for La Voix du Congolais. In the 1950s, he strongly advocated for evolution of the Belgian Congo colony into a Belgo-Congolese community. The Belgian government regarded him as \\"friendly\\" towards its administration, and they granted him a carte de m√©rite civique. In 1952, while in Senegal, he joined Liberal International. The following year he traveled to Belgium where he was received by members of the Liberal Party. The trip was limited and a largely managed by the government. Bolamba subsequently criticised Belgian travel restrictions for the Congolese, writing, \\"Nothing should prevent Blacks to work in Belgium, if they wish to...Black parents should have the freedom to let their children be educated in Belgian universities of their choice.\\" Bolamba became the first African to be appointed assistant private secretary to Belgium's Minister of the Colonies, holding the post from September 1956 until October 1957. He served as president of the Association des Anciens El√®ves des Fr√®res des Ecoles Chr√©tiennes, vice-president of the Mouvement Cultural Belgo-Congolais, member of the consultative committee for √âmissions africaines de Radio Congo Belge, member of the regional committee of the Office des Cit√©s Africaines, and member of the consultative committee for the Fonds du Roi. In 1959 Bolamba was appointed Director-General of Service in the Commissariat of Information. In July he founded the Parti de l'Ind√©pendance et de la Libert√©, later becoming its vice president in December. During the municipal elections that month he secured a seat on the Council of the Kalamu commune of L√©opoldville on a Balikolo list. He participated in the Belgo-Congolese Round Table Conference in January‚ÄìFebruary 1960 in Brussels that resulted in Belgium granting the Congo independence. From April through May 1960 he toured West Germany at the invitation of the German government. Patrice Lumumba convinced him to join his nationalist party, Mouvement National Congolais-Lumumba (MNC-L). Bolamba later explained that he did this because Lumumba supported national unity, though he still identified himself primarily as a liberal. In the general elections he unsuccessfully ran for a seat in the Chamber of Deputies on a MNC-L list in an √âquateur constituency. Following independence in June 1960 his beliefs turned sharply against Belgium. Bolamba was appointed by Prime Minister Lumumba to serve as Secretary of State for Information and Cultural Affairs in his government of the newly independent Republic of the Congo. The government was officially invested by Parliament on 24 June. In August he was put in charge of directing the newly-created Agence Congolaise de Presse. He made numerous anti-Belgian broadcasts over Radio L√©opoldville during his tenure. On 5 September President Joseph Kasa-Vubu dismissed Bolamba, Lumumba, and several other members of the government. Under Prime Minister Cyrille Adoula he returned to government work, serving as chef de cabinet in the Ministry of the Post Office and Telecommunications. In November 1962 he was made Director of Presidential Affairs at the Office of the Prime Minister. From 14 April 1963 until 9 July 1964 he served as Minister of Information and Tourism. In February 1966 Bolamba was appointed Head of the Press Office of the Presidency. In May 1969 he was made Head of the Administrative Service of the Presidency. Ten years later he became the director of national press of and adviser to the office of the President-Founder of the Mouvement Populaire de la R√©volution.  Later life  Antoine-Roger Bolamba changed his name to Bolamba Lokol√© J'ongungu in 1972 in accordance with President Mobutu Sese Seko's policy of Authenticit√©. He died on 9 July 2002 at the Ngaliema Clinic in Kinshasa. On 3 August 2013 Minister of Youth, Sports, Culture and Arts Banza Mukalay hosted a day of tribute in Kinshasa to recognise Bolamba's contributions to Congolese culture.

The agency is based in Causewayside, Edinburgh, with branches in Liverpool and Istanbul. History Tayburn was formed on 5 March 1979 by Erick Davidson and Andrew Hunter. By 1980, Tayburn employed 18 people and began growing a blue chip client book across the UK. In 1981 turnover was ¬£1million and profit ¬£100,000 and offices were opened in London and Aberdeen. A management buyout led by Erick Davidson in 1988 meant a majority ownership for the executive directors. Tayburn was by this stage established as a respected design consultancy with many creative awards to its name. During the 1980s their clients included BP, Bank of Scotland, B & Q and The Scottish Development Agency. The latter was rebranded by Tayburn to become Scottish Enterprise, and they also handled the privatisation of Scottish Electricity for Scottish Hydro-Electric, who, as Scottish and Southern Energy plc, are still a client today. Tayburn was also the inaugural winner of The Scottish Design Consultancy of the Year Award in 1992. During the mid-1990s Tayburn became the only ever Scotland-based winner of Best Annual Report prize from the Stock Exchange for Grampian Holdings. They were also listed in the UK's Top Ten Design Consultancies for the first time. By the late 1990s Tayburn had more business from outside Scotland than within it, which led to the establishment of their first international office in Istanbul. At the turn of the century, Tayburn was awarded 'Design Company of the Decade' by Trade magazine 'The Drum'. In 2006, Simon Farrell joined Tayburn as Managing Director and Erick Davidson became Chairman. Tayburn announced the launch of a new Manchester office and beat entries from other Scottish design consultancies to develop the brand for the 2014 Commonwealth Games bid.Behind the Commonwealth Games Bid , accessed 2010-03-11 Towards the end of the decade, Tayburn had another management buy-outmanagement buy-out, accessed 2010-03-11 with Simon Farrell, Malcolm Stewart, Steven Mitchell and Bill Davidson taking over the reins.

The GEO first began organizing at UIUC in the mid-1990s, gaining its first contract with the Board of Trustees (BoT) of the University of Illinois system in 2004. The members of GEO are committed to the principles of participatory democracy. Their objectives are 1) Organizing, 2) Collective Representation and Bargaining, 3) Education, 4) Community, and 5) Cooperation and Social Justice. Since 1995, GEO has ratified five employment contracts with the administration at UIUC, with the fifth contract active over 2017-2022.  GEO's Organizational Structure  GEO is a recognized union affiliated with the Illinois Federation of Teachers (IFT), the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), and the AFL-CIO. The union is organized broadly into two groups: the Coordinating Committee (CC) and the Stewards‚Äô Council (SC). The CC is elected by the GEO membership every spring. GEO's Organizational Structure Coordinating Committee (CC) The CC is made of elected officials from all committees such as the Communications Committee (Comm), the Grievance Committee (GC), the Personnel Committee (PC), Treasurer, the Solidarity Committee, and the Bargaining Team (BT). Some committees like the Work Action Group (WAG) and the Bargaining Research Team (BRT) are temporary, based on GEO's current organizational needs. For example, the Bargaining Team is active only during contract negotiations. Stewards‚Äô Council (SC) The SC is made up of department representatives who work to advocate on behalf of GEO members. Meeting bi‚Äêweekly, the SC organizes rallies, develops strategies for strengthening the union and increasing membership, and ensures that the union works most efficiently and effectively on behalf of campus workers. Stemming from the SC are the Election Committee, International Student Working Group (ISWG), Orientation Committee, Conflict Resolution Ad Hoc Committee, and Healthcare Working Group (HWG). As of Spring 2017, the ISWG and HWG were an active group while the Conflict Resolution Ad Hoc Committee was a semi-active group. The Election and Orientation Committees form only as needed, in preparation for and during union elections and University orientation, respectively. Communications Committee (CommComm) CommComm is responsible for GEO's communications strategy and oversees external communications. Members create content for, edit, design, and distribute information for the GEO. These communications include the website, social media, orientation materials, mass emails, press releases, t‚Äêshirts, buttons, stickers, and much more. Grievance Committee (GC) The GC works to enforce the GEO contract. They are responsible for advocating for fair labor practices at UIUC and protecting graduate employees. Solidarity Committee (SolComm) SolComm is committed to working on issues of social justice and supporting them through various means such as financial endorsements, statements of support, and collaborations. To that end, the Solidarity Committee allows the creation of research groups to efficiently strategize around issues of social justice. Groups such as the Environmental Justice Research Group, the Gender Justice Research Group, and the Anti‚ÄêPolice Brutality Research Group work on these issues and report to the Solidarity Committee.  History  The early years Graduate employees have been organizing at UIUC since the early 1970s, when a group called the Assistants Union first worked to improve working conditions. In the late 1980s, the union named themselves the Graduate Employees‚Äô Organization (GEO) and got together to voice graduate assistants‚Äô concerns over issues such as salaries, workload, and health care, as well as a perceived lack of campus parking. An early victory came when the GEO convinced the administration to delay payment of student fees until the first payday. After initial success, this early GEO became inactive. In the fall of 1993, a new group of graduate employees began building an active organization with the goal of matching the achievements of unions at the Universities of Michigan and Wisconsin. In the Spring of 1994, the GEO issued a bill of rights and successfully rallied grads against the administration's plan to stop issuing staff ID cards to assistants. With the ID cards, assistants were able to retain many benefits such as staff parking, access to the Illini Credit Union, and state of Illinois employee discounts. During the 1994-95 academic year, the GEO grew and changed significantly. In the spring of 1995, GEO affiliated with the Illinois Federation of Teachers (IFT), joining over 70,000 Illinois educators in that organization. During the summer of 1995, along with other graduate employee unions in the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), they formed the Alliance of Graduate Employee Locals (AGEL). Securing the right to form a union By April 1996, 3226 graduate assistants had signed cards in support of the GEO's call for a union election. The GEO filed these cards as a petition with the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board (IELRB) to request a union election. In 1998, the Labor Board reviewed the petition and two of the three members in the committee ruled that graduate assistants would not be considered employees. GEO then appealed this case to the Illinois Court of Appeals. Deciding on the Bargaining Unit (BU) In early March 1999, a student referendum (sponsored by the Illinois Student Government) in support of graduate employees‚Äô right to union representation passed with 77% of the vote. At the end of March, 55 graduate employees and supporters (including clergy, union members, and student government leaders) held a 20-hour sit-in at the Board of Trustees office to draw public attention to the administration's policy of non-recognition. On June 30, 2000, the Illinois Court of Appeals, in a unanimous decision, overturned the IELRB's decision denying graduate employees the right to choose union recognition. Calling the Labor Board's decision ‚Äúclearly erroneous‚Äù and based on an ‚Äúoverly simplistic interpretation‚Äù of Illinois educational labor law, the Court sent the case back to the Board for reconsideration. They must now allow ‚Äúthose individuals whose assistantships are not significantly connected to their status as students ‚Ä¶ the same statutory right to organize as other educational employees.‚Äù The IELRB approved preliminary guidelines for who would be allowed to vote in the union election. Graduate students employed as teachers, researchers, or assistants whose employment duties overlapped with their academic discipline were to be excluded. In early 2002, GEO staged a sit-in at the Swanlund Administration Building. Soon after, the Administration agreed to meet with the union. Provost Richard Herman, accompanied by Deputy University Legal Counsel Steve Veazie, agreed to a series of meetings with GEO representatives to decide on the composition of the bargaining unit. After nearly seven weeks of negotiations, the GEO and university officials were able to come to an agreement on the composition of the bargaining unit. Union election The labor board scheduled the first GEO election for the week before Fall semester final exams: December 3‚Äì4, 2002. In a 1188 to 347 decision, graduate students overwhelmingly voted for GEO to represent them at the bargaining table. Contracts GEO's first contract spanned from 2003 to 2006. Once this contract ended, in the spring of 2007, GEO ratified their second contract for 2006-2009 with back-pay, a greater subsidy of graduate healthcare, and higher wages. Bargaining for the third contract began in April 2009. In early November, a strike authorization vote was overwhelmingly passed (92% of 777 votes cast) by members of GEO. More than 1,000 graduate employees and supporters walked picket lines for two days on the Main Quad. GEO then ratified the third contract, which secured tuition waivers for graduate employees. A few months after the new contract was signed, in the summer of 2010, the College of Fine and Applied Arts (FAA) reduced tuition waivers in five departments (Music, Dance, Theater, Landscape Architecture, and Urban & Regional Planning) from the out-of-state to the in-state rate, a difference of $13,000 per year. The union grieved this violation of the contract with the university administration and filed an unfair labor practice (ULP) with the IELRB. They won a decision from a federal arbitrator in September 2011. On November 15, 2012 the IELRB ruled in favor of the GEO, finding that the UIUC administration engaged in an unfair labor practice with regard to the reduction in tuition waivers and failure to comply with the arbitrator's ruling. Bargaining for the fourth contract began on April 13, 2012. After several months of no resolution, GEO passed a strike authorization vote by 87%. On November 27, 2012 the administration and GEO signed a tentative agreement and GEO ratified this contract with a 95% vote of approval.  GEO today  In spring of 2017, GEO began bargaining for their fifth contract with the University of Illinois management team in anticipation of the fourth contract expiring on August 15, 2017. As voted on by membership at the General Membership Meeting on February 1, 2017, the contract priorities were organized around protecting tuition waivers, raising wages and eliminating fees, ensuring quality healthcare, and promoting access and equality (which includes creating childcare support, strengthening the nondiscrimination statement, and expanding parental, bereavement, and visa/immigration leave). In the first session, GEO's elected bargaining team presented its comprehensive contract proposal to the management team and answered questions. This bargaining negotiation is ongoing and will continue until a new contract is signed.

He was a benefactor of the Knights Templar as well as religious establishments. He was succeeded by his son Otuel. From 1185 the family was based at Griff, Warwickshire, near land at Chilvers Coton given to Arbury Priory and the Templars. Biography Born in 1133 at Sudeley Castle in Gloucestershire, England, Ralph de Sudeley died at Griff, Warwickshire, England in 1192, according to Great Britain's Heraldry and probate records.Great Britain Heraldry Records According to genealogical records, Ralph De Sudeley was a true, historical figure and was the son of Baron John de Sudeley (1090-1140) and Grace de Traci (-?). His mother, Grace, was the daughter of William de Traci who was the son of King Henry I of England. This made Ralph the great- grandson of the King of England, earning him great respect throughout England.Ancestry.com ‚ÄúWhen the Knights Templar order was founded in France in the early 1100s, its members were French Cistercian monks who vowed to fight for Christianity in the Holy Land. Within fifty years, however, men from other European countries such as Germany and England joined the ranks, and many of these were far from being monks. Most were either professional soldiers or simply adventurers whose motives were a combination of glory and greed. (Rich pickings were to be had from plundering the Moslem population of the Middle East.) Although the Knights Templar order still considered itself to be an army of holy warriors, by the 1180s it was more like an early version of the Foreign Legion: an international militia under French control that made up its numbers with mercenaries and adventurers. One such adventurer was Ralph de Sudeley, the leader of the Templars who apparently found the treasure at Jebel Madhbah in the 1180s. He was a wealthy English knight who joined the Templars in the Holy Land in 1182, and in 1189 he returned to his home at Herdewyke (now called Temple Herdewyke) in the county of Warwickshire in central England, only ten miles from what would later be Shakespeare's birthplace of Stratford-upon-Avon. On his arrival home, de Sudeley immediately bought a large estate in the area and founded a Templar preceptory to train new recruits for a fresh Crusade planned by the English king Richard I. During this period, there was no such thing as a full-time, professional army in England, and in wartime troops were supplied by landlords who raised the required number of men from among their tenants. Most of these were sent into battle with little or no training. The exception, however, could be found in warrior orders such as the Knights Templar. A Templar preceptory was therefore a combined monastery and military base. While they were there, the monks lived a monastic life in one part of the camp, while the laymen lived in traditional barracks in another part of the base. The local Feet of Fines, contemporary records of land and property holdings, show that de Sudeley's preceptory possessed expensive holy relics brought back from the Middle East. An entry for the year 1192 included mention of certain objets sacr√©s‚Äî\\"sacred artifacts\\"‚Äîthat were housed in the chapel of the Herdewyke preceptory. As official documents in the twelfth century were frequently written in Norman French, the term objets sacr√©s was the usual way of describing holy relics returned from the Crusades, often precious objects thought to have been associated with the Bible. Unfortunately, no specific details are given, other than the fact that pilgrims donated large sums of money to the preceptory when they visited the chapel to see these items. Nevertheless, the chances are that these could well have been the same items discovered in the cave at Jebel Madhbah.‚Äù It has been claimed that Sudeley was a leader of the Knights Templar c. 1180. In a novel The Essene Conspiracy he is mentioned as a crusader in 1190. Graham Phillips claimed Ralph de Sudeley may have found the Ark of the Covenant when he discovered the Maccabean treasure at Jebel al Madhbah. Because Sudeley returned to Britain, it is theorised that he may have taken the Ark to Great Britain with him.Graham Phillips website http://www.grahamphillips.net/ark/ark6.html Notes Category:Medieval Knights Templar members Category:12th-century English people Category:1133 births Category:1192 deaths ","title":"Ralph de Sudeley"},{"id":"26589457","text":"Roberto Etxebarria Arruti (6 May 1908 ‚Äì 17 February 1981) was a Spanish footballer who played as a midfielder.

The small funerary sculptures from New Ireland were associated with death rituals. They are typical in the hilly Punam region of the New Ireland province in Papua New Guinea of the Bismarck Archipelago. They were believed to contain the soul of the deceased person whom they were meant to represent, and would be ritually smashed once their usefulness or the period of mourning was over. In more recent years, some have been sold in their intact forms to Westerners, particularly to German administrators. History The figurines were found in an intact form in the nineteenth century. However, as Christianity took roots in these islands, the belief system for Kulap figures vanished. Particularly when the Australian administration of New Ireland was established in 1914, the ritual practice ceased to exist. However, during the colonial rule, the figurines were sold to Westerners for their cultural value. The earliest recorded history of these figures was provided by Reverend George Brown during his visit to an area on the west coast at Patpatar of southern New Ireland where the language spoken was Hinsal. Brown had noted that these figures were kept in a large, painted, corner house, which was well maintained on protected land. The building had kept two, large, painted human figures (one large male figure and the other smaller but not intended for worship) inferred to be linked to some kind of superstition as people danced in front of the figures. Women and children were prohibited entry. The last of the figurines was created ca. 1910. Features The chalk limestone used for carving Kulaps is found in the river beds of the hilly Punam region of southern New Ireland. Recent studies indicate that the figures are also from Muliama on the east coast. In villages where the language spoken is Patpatar, the Kulaps are known by other names, such as Katpuo or Papawa in Saraha village. Carved Kulaps may sometimes be painted. They are produced by artisans from the Rossel Mountains. They may represent either men or women. Some of these figures are carved in \\"stylized\\" form and painted in pure white colour and kept in small enclosures. The figurines represent the dead, generally in a sitting posture. Only specific people were allowed to handle such figures as it was believed that the ‚Äúspirit\\" or \\"soul of the dead‚Äù in whose commemoration it was made should be temporarily confined to these figures to prevent them from harming the village environment. However, smaller images of Kulaps made of chalk are kept in houses. Rituals Rituals were involved in selecting and making these figures. It involved a male relative of the deceased specifically visiting the Russel Mountain quarries to acquire a suitable stone. The funerary sculpture was made by specialist artists. The carved figure was presented to a local leader in secret, where it would be formally kept, sometimes standing in rows with other kulaps, within leaf-decorated mortuary structures. Only men were allowed to visit the ceremonial enclosure to view and perform rituals to the figures of the dead. Women and children mourned the dead relative from outside the enclosure as they were considered impure to see the figurines. After the specific period of mourning was over, the figure was removed from the shrine in secrecy and destroyed to symbolically represent the release of ‚Äúthe soul into the realm of the ancestors‚Äù, otherwise bad spirits could reach the ancestor. These funeral practices are not conducted anymore.

Besides being trained in piano, Holly is a self-taught guitar and trumpet player. In 2001, she recorded High Above The City, a 20-track solo album available only at shows. In the fall of 2003, Holly met and teamed up with Alex Lipsen, producer and keys player. The project evolved into The Jealous Girlfriends, a four-piece band based in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.  Early life  Miranda grew up singing in church, in Detroit, learning piano at age six and picking up the guitar at 14, around the time she began writing songs. At the age of 16, she moved to New York City, dropping out of high school and finishing her degree through correspondence. She earned a deal with major label BMG at the age of 17, but the music she recorded for them was never released. Miranda commented on this, saying: \\"I ended up walking away from [it]. It's, like, in a safe somewhere and no one's ever heard it.\\"  Career = 2001‚Äì2007: Career beginnings, The Jealous Girlfriends  After moving to New York, she met the people she'd eventually refer to as bandmates for The Jealous Girlfriends.

Although much smaller in size than those of Rome, the catacombs in Malta, especially the ones in Rabat, are among the most important early Christian burial sites south of Rome. The site is managed by Heritage Malta and is currently closed for conservation. History An outside view of Abbatija Tad-Dejr catacombs The early catacombs comprised a singular shaft and chamber tombs dug from the vertical face of a quarry. Between the fourth and the ninth centuries AD, four larger complexes were added. The most important of the four small catacombs is the largest one; with its rows of carefully placed baldacchino tombs, it is possibly one of the few catacombs that saw some sort of pre-planning during excavations. Baldacchino tombs are often considered to be the richest out of the array of tomb types found in Maltese catacombs; at least three of such tombs in this complex are heavily decorated with reliefs. In the post-Roman period, the largest catacomb was enlarged and turned into a small church. Uses The presence in the hypogeum of a stone altar and the number of crosses carved into the rock surface suggest early Christian use. A fresco that, until recently, decorated the apse over the supposed location of the original altar is now housed in the National Museum of Fine Arts. The catacombs underwent various other phases of use. Amongst other uses, they were used as cow pens and for the quarrying of stone used in the production of lime. The latter has resulted in extensive damage. Some of the truncated shaft and chamber burials can be viewed from the low roof of the quarry.

Gold coin Theodora (r. 1055‚Äì1056). Ever since Emperor Constantine I (r. 306‚Äì337), the Byzantine Empire's main coinage had been the high-quality solidus or nomisma, which had remained standard in weight and gold content through the centuries. The Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas (r. 963‚Äì969), however, introduced a new coin which was a 2 carats (i.e. about 1‚ÅÑ12, despite its name) lighter than the original nomisma, which now became known as the histamenon.... The exact reason for the introduction of the tetarteron is unclear. According to the historian Zonaras, this was done to increase state revenues: the taxes were to be paid as before in the histamenon, while the state paid its own expenses in the less valuable tetarteron, which was officially rated as equal to the full histamenon, instead. Modern scholars have alternatively suggested that the tetarteron was an imitation of the Muslim gold dinar, for use in the eastern provinces recently conquered from the Arabs, or perhaps an element of an abortive monetary reform that intended to replace the histamenon altogether.. At any rate, the tetarteron was issued only in small quantities in the 10th century, and only from the mid-11th century on was it minted in quantity approaching the histamenon.. Initially, the two coins were virtually indistinguishable, except in weight. During the later reign of Basil II (r. 976‚Äì1025), the tetarteron began to be minted in a thicker and smaller form, while the histamenon conversely became thinner and wider. Only during the sole rule of Constantine VIII (r. 1025‚Äì1028), however, did the two coins become iconographically distinct as well... By the mid-11th century, the tetarteron measured 18 mm wide and its weight apparently standardized at 3.98 grams, i.e. three carats less than the histamenon, which now measured 25 mm in diameter (as opposed to 20 mm for the original solidus) and had acquired a slightly concave (scyphate) form.; . However, starting with Michael IV (r. 1034‚Äì1041), who was a former money lender, the gold content began to be increasingly lowered and the coins debased. After a period of relative stability in circa 1055‚Äì1070, the gold content declined dramatically in the period of crisis in the 1070s and 1080s.. During the first eleven years of the reign of Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081‚Äì1118), the last gold/electrum tetarterons were issued. Alexios reformed the whole Byzantine coinage in 1092 and eliminated the gold/electrum tetarteron and gold/electrum histamenon. In its place he introduced a new gold coin called the hyperpyron. Copper coin Copper tetarteron of Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143‚Äì1180). In 1092, Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081‚Äì1118) reformed the imperial coinage, introducing the hyperpyron gold coin instead of the devalued histamena and tetartera.. Alexios also instituted a new copper coinage (although many of the first examples were struck of lead) to replace the old follis. Apparently due to its similar dimensions and fabric to the gold tetarteron, it was also named tetarteron or tarteron. It has, however, also been suggested that its name derives from it being worth one quarter of the late, debased follis of the 1080s.; ; . The new coin, flat, weighing circa 4 grams and valued (at least initially) at 864 to the gold hyperpyron, was struck in great quantities and in a large variety of designs, especially in the 12th century. A half-tetarteron was also minted. Both coins remained relatively stable in weight, but begin to appear less frequently towards the turn of the 13th century.; ; . In the 13th century, copper tetartera were issued by the rulers of the Empire of Thessalonica in the 1230s and 1240s, as well as by the Empire of Nicaea (1204‚Äì1261).. In the restored Byzantine Empire, from 1261 on, they appear to have been replaced by a new type of copper coins named assaria after the ancient Roman coins..

Early life Elise Friedericke Hensler was born on 22 May 1836 at La Chaux-de-Fonds, in the Neuch√¢tel canton of Switzerland. She was the daughter of Johann Friederich Conrad Hensler and his wife, Louise Josephe Hechelbacher. Her family was Swiss-German. When she was twelve, her family moved to Boston in the United States, where she was given a remarkable education, with the arts and languages playing an important role. She finished her studies in Paris and, as an adult, could easily speak seven languages. Theatrical career Following her studies, Elise joined the Teatro alla Scala of Milan with an easygoing life. In 1855, when she was nineteen, she had a daughter, Alice Hensler, by an unknown father. The father was a member of the Milanese nobility. Alice Hensler later married a Portuguese officer, Manuel de Azevedo Gomes (1847‚Äì1907). On 2 February 1860, Elise arrived in Portugal and sang at the Teatro Nacional S√£o Jo√£o in Oporto and then at the Teatro Nacional de S√£o Carlos in Lisbon, where she performed in Giuseppe Verdi's opera Un ballo in maschera. On 15 April 1860, Ferdinand II of Portugal, widower of Queen Maria II, watched the play and was seduced by Elise's voice and beauty; she was then 24 years old. Their relationship deepened rapidly because, just like Ferdinand II, the singer had a passion for sculpture, ceramics, painting, architecture and gardening. Marriage Chalet of the Countess of Edla in Sintra On 10 June 1869, Elise married morganatically, in Benfica (Lisbon), the former King Ferdinand II of Portugal, Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Just before the ceremony, Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, a cousin of Ferdinand and the head of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, granted to Elise the title of Gr√§fin von Edla (Countess of Edla); the marriage was childless. In Portugal, the couple lived a discreet life in Sintra, where the former king occupied the Pal√°cio da Pena. As a hobby, both Ferdinand and Elise loved botany, and in the middle of their park, Elise built a chalet which she designed herself, inspired by Swiss chalets and rural houses of the United States. With the support of his cultivated wife, Ferdinand supported several artists, including the painter Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro and the pianist Jos√© Viana da Mota. Later years In 1885, Ferdinand died and in his will left all his households to the Countess, including the Pal√°cio da Pena. In order for the Countess to maintain these estates, King Charles I of Portugal had to pay her the amount of 410 million r√©is. As a widow, Elise abandoned Sintra and settled with her daughter Alice and her daughter's husband, Manuel de Azevedo Gomes. She died of uremia on 21 May 1929 in Lisbon, Portugal. At her funeral, the dowager queen Am√©lie of Orl√©ans and the ex-king Manuel II of Portugal were represented by the Viscount of Asseca.  Bibliography  *\\"Condessa d'Edla\\", by Teresa Rebelo.

This spring, or a similar one, might explain why the baths, which needed a constant flow of large amounts of water, were built in Gƒßajn Tuffieƒßa. Site Excavations in the 1930s One of the many sites excavated under the supervision of Sir Themistocles Zammit, it comprises a number of rooms. These represent the full repertoire seen in other Roman baths, including the Tepidarium, Frigidarium and Caldarium. There is also a latrine and a corridor connecting small rooms which are usually interpreted to be changing or bedrooms. It is possible that these rooms acted as a dormitory for people visiting the baths as they cannot be connected with any residential remains of the same period. All the rooms are decorated with intricate mosaics of coloured marbles and stones arranged in geometric designs. The corridors and latrine are, on the other hand, paved with ceramic lozenge-shaped tiles of a length of just fewer than ten centimeters. Restoration Floor mosaic found at the centre In 1961, the site‚Äôs mosaics underwent restoration sponsored by UNESCO and rooms were built to shelter and protect the remains. The site has also benefited in recent years from the UNESCO funded Malta Mosaics Project, which mapped mosaics and pavements at Gƒßajn Tuffieha and the Domvs Romana. The analysis of this mapping has resulted in a detailed conservation plan which will be implemented in the coming years. The European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development has granted funds for the study and conservation of the site as part of the 2007 Rural Development Programme for Malta. These funds will help to create visitor facilities and open the site to the public.

He was a grandson of Madame de Montespan. He was known as the marquis de Gondrin during his lifetime. Biography Born at the Ch√¢teau of Montespan, he was the eldest of two sons born to Louis Antoine de Pardaillan de Gondrin and his wife Julie Fran√ßoise de Crussol (1669‚Äì1742), daughter of the Duke of Uz√®s. His younger brother Pierre was the Duke-Bishop of Langres. As the eldest, he was expected to succeed to be the head of the House of Pardaillan de Gondrin. Known as the Marquis of Gondrin in his lifetime, he was outlived by his father and as such never succeeded to the Duchy of Antin which was created in 1711 by Louis XIV. He married Marie Victoire de Noailles, one of the twenty children of the Duke of Noailles and Marie Fran√ßoise de Bournonville. The couple married on 25 January 1707. At the time of her first marriage, Marie Victoire, marquise de Gondrin, was a dame du palais to the king's granddaughter-in-law, the duchesse de Bourgogne, future Dauphine of France and mother of King Louis XV. Louis died in February 1712 at Versailles. He was succeeded by his son to the title Marquis of Gondrin. On 2 February 1723, Marie Victoire married again, in a secret ceremony, the Count of Toulouse, the legitimised younger son of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan.

The group's greatest fame came during the early 1970s. They scored eleven Top Ten R&B; hits from 1969 to 1974. They also charted 21 songs in the Billboard Hot 100 Pop Chart, and had chart hits in Australia, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Canada, as well as in the U.S. History=Early career The group was formed in Chicago in the late 1950s while still in high school. The original members were lead singer Eugene Record, Robert \\"Squirrel\\" Lester, Clarence Johnson, Burt Bowen, and Eddie Reed of The Chanteurs. All attended Hyde Park High School except for Record who attended Englewood High School. The group performed at the their High School \\"Senior Varieties\\" talent show. Soon after, they released a single entitled, \\"You've Got A Great Love\\" written by Johnson. Bowen left the group and was replaced by Solly McElroy of The Flamingos, who was soon replaced by Marshall Thompson of The Desideros. In 1960, Reed died and Thompson brought in Creadel \\"Red\\" Jones who was a member of The Desideros to replace him. In early 1964 the group changed their name to The Hi-Lites and released a song entitled, \\"I'm So Jealous\\" with Record on lead. Noting that the name Hi-lites was already in use and wanting to honor their home town they changed their name to Marshall & The Chi-Lites\\" in 1964. Under their new name they recorded four songs entitled, \\"Pretty Girl\\" written by Record, who also was on lead, \\"Love Bandit\\" written by Jones with Thompson on lead, \\"Price of Love\\" and \\"Baby It's Time\\". Clarence Johnson left he group later that year, and their name was subsequently shortened to the Chi-Lites. Eugene Record was the musical group's sole songwriter and lead singer. Record never collaborated with members outside his singing group. In 1968, the group meet with record producer Carl Davis and signed a contract with Brunswick Records out of Chicago. The Chi- Lites with members Record, Thompson, Lester and Jones recorded their first charting song, \\"Give It Away\\" written by Davis and Record. The single became a top ten Billboard R&B; hit spending nine weeks on the chart and peaking at No. 10 on March 15, 1969. 1971‚Äì1979 Their major hits came in 1971 and 1972, \\"Have You Seen Her\\" and \\"Oh Girl\\", the latter becoming a #1 single on the Billboard Hot 100 on May 27, 1972. Each sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. Other transatlantic chart hits followed, although their output became more fragmented as the group's personnel came and went. Bass singer Jones left in 1973, and was replaced in quick succession by Stanley Anderson, Willie Kinsey, and then Doc Roberson. Shortly thereafter, Eugene Record left, and David Scott and Danny Johnson entered. More personnel changes ensued, when Johnson was replaced by Vandy Hampton in 1977. The Chi- lites cut some tracks for the Inphasion label in 1979, which appeared on an obscure album for the Excello label. 1980‚Äì1999 In 1980, Thompson, Jones, and Lester re-formed the group. Lester was the lead singer. The new group continued using the Chi-Lites established name. Creadel Jones left for a second time in 1982, and the group would remain a trio. In 1983, the group released the critically acclaimed Bottoms Up album and achieved notable club and R&B; chart success with the title track and \\"Changing For You.\\" Released on LARC Records, the album was also released in the UK on the R&B; label under the distribution wing of PRT. \\"Changing For You\\" album version was released in the UK as a 12\\" single which became popular in London clubs including Flicks in Dartford and The Goldmine in Canvey Island. \\"Changing For You\\" also remained on the Caister Weekender playlist for two years. \\"Changing For You\\" and the title track \\"Bottoms Up\\" were heavily played and promoted by UK Jazz Funk Soul DJ Robbie Vincent. An edited version of \\"Changing For You\\" entered the UK Charts and reached No. 61. Record left again in 1988, and new lead Frank Reed joined to replace him. Singer Anthony Reynard Watson replaced Reed later that year and the duty of lead vocals would alternate between Reed and Watson over the course of the next decade. (Lester took over singing lead on \\"Oh Girl\\", while Watson led on their other songs). In 1997, while returning home from a concert in Pennsylvania, the Chi-Lites were involved in a serious car crash which resulted in both Reed and Thompson's wife Constance being ejected from the vehicle. Constance died from her injuries and Reed had to have a metal plate inserted in his back. \\"Hold On to Your Dreams\\" was included on the Help Wanted (Heroes are in Short Supply) album in Constance's honor. Reed was subsequently replaced once again by Watson until Watson's permanent departure in 2002. On December 13, 1999, BMI named The Chi-Lites, \\"Oh Girl\\" No. 36 of the top 100 songs of the century (1900-1999). 1999‚Äìpresent The Chi-Lites had a big year in 2004. Their early 70s hit, \\"Are You My Woman,\\" was remade by Beyonce Knowles as the across-the-board hit and Grammy winning, \\"Crazy In Love.\\" And their 1974 song \\"That's How Long\\" was used as the backdrop for one of the cuts on Jay-Z's Black Album. Also, the group reunited with former lead Eugene Record for the March 2004 PBS Soul Music special and they sounded great. Record died in July 2005 after a long bout with cancer. Marshall Thompson and Squirrel Lester, along with more recent addition Frank Reed and the group's first female member, wife Tara Thompson, continued the Chi-Lites tradition, recording sporadically and touring unceasingly over the last two decades with other classic soul groups such as the Stylistics and Ray, Goodman and Brown. In 2005 the group released the single \\"Mother Love\\" and followed the next with a Christmas song. Lester died in January of 2010, leaving Thompson the sole remaining founding member of the group. Lester was replaced by Fred Simon (formerly of the Lost Generation). Then, in February of 2014, Reed died after an illness. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed The Chi-Lites among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. As of 2020, Thompson is continuing The Chi-Lites' legacy as the last surviving member. On June 17, 2020 Hollywood Walk of Fame announced their Class of 2021 to received stars on Hollywood Blvd., and The Chi-Lites were named as one of the honorees.

A christian church was built on site based on the pseudo-history and religious doctrine that the site has biblical connections. On site of a present chapel was a temple dedicated to the Greek God Apollo and a Roman villa. According to religious tradition the villa is where St. Publius, the governor and first bishop of Malta, welcomed St. Paul after his shipwreck. Apart from a copied and translated scripture attributed to Saint Luke, of which original source is now lost and has been translated from languages to languages, there are no periodic authors that wrote about the shipwreck at the time and no temporary authors supplement the tradition. Since the myth was founded, authors were careful in their writings to suit the Christian scripture which says Melite (not Malta). There is no archaeological evidence in support of Christian claims, and it is considered a word of mouth and misnomer by name dating to the middle ages. Evidence of Christian worship on the site only dates back to the building of the first chapel in the fourteenth century. According to Anthony Bonanno, archeological research in the entire area of St Paul‚Äôs Bay found no evidence of the Christian tradition related to the supposed shipwreck in the area. History Olive-telated equipment at the site. The site has been in use since prehistoric times; a couple of tombs date back to the Zebbug and possibly the Borg in-Nadur phases of the Maltese Bronze Age. The first building on the site was probably built in the Phoenician-Punic period, when the site was used intermittently for agriculture. A small number of structures remain from this period and one burial bears a neo-Punic inscription. In the Roman period, the site‚Äôs position on the slopes of a fertile valley and vicinity to the Roman harbour at Salina meant that it was ideally suited to the production of olive oil. The establishment was expanded; the original central courtyard was transformed into an industrial area. The trapetum (a rotating mill used to separate pips from olive fruit), anchor points and at least two presses can still be seen, as well as a set of settling vats used to purify oil. Although large enough to have been the property of a rich aristocrat, the villa does not contain any residential quarters of any particular richness. The four rooms which can be identified as serving residential needs were, in fact, only decorated with painted wall plasters and common cocciopesto flooring. The site was eventually reduced in size and surrounded by a thick fortification wall. This wall was erected circa the third century A.D. by the Romans as a mean for defence from invaders. Its fortified walls, constant water supply and good position meant that it was ideally located to control the nearby port and valleys. During the Arab period the site was majorly destroyed due to sea invasions and attacks. The Arabs decided to use the remains to fortify the site with limited construction techniques. A church was built on part of the site in the fourteenth century, but after more than a century it fell into disuse and in 1616 was replaced by a church dedicated to the welcoming of St. Paul. This church, which still stands today, is the oldest record connecting the site to the traditional event. Excavation Although the remains of the villa have long been well known, scientific excavations, led by the Missione Archeologica Italiana a Malta, did not commence until 1963. The final report on these excavations is yet to be published. The site was included on the Antiquities List of 1925. Today Today, the site is managed by Heritage Malta and closed to the public except for annual occasions.

Geography Otavice is a ribbon village below the Little Mountain () chain in the eastern part of the Ribnica Valley (). The nearby forests are rich in linden and fir, which has led to their use for bee forage. The Sela meadows lie west of the settlement, the Rupƒçe hay fields to the east, and the sparse Stevniki oak woods to the north. The soil is stony and sandy, making potatoes a principal crop, but crop damage by deer has led to many fields being planted in clover. Coniferous and mixed woods rise above the village on Little Mountain. Br≈°ljunovka Cave on Little Mountain is fed by a spring. Name Otavice was mentioned in written sources in 1340 as Ottawnich (and as Ottawnikch and Ottownikch in 1436). The name Otavice is probably derived from the Slovene common noun otava 'second crop (of hay)', referring to a meadow where hay could be harvested twice during the summer.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC, p. 197. In the past, the settlement was known as Otawitz in German. History The remnants of a Roman road pass near the village, attesting to early settlement in the area. Oral tradition relates that there are Ottoman graves in Tur Field () at the foot of Little Mountain. A water main was installed in the village in 1960, supplying water from Obrh Spring near Blate via Goriƒça Vas. Traditional handicrafts in the village included making rakes with wood from Koƒçevje Rog. Peddling declined in the 20th century as people started commuting to Ribnica to work.

The first commercial hard-disk drive, the IBM 305 RAMAC, used forced air to maintain a 0.002 inch (51 Œºm) spacing between the head and disk. The IBM 1301, introduced in 1961, was the first disk drive in which the head was attached to a \\"hydrodynamic air bearing slider,\\" which generates its own cushion of pressurized air, allowing the slider and head to fly much closer, 0.00025 inches (6.35 Œºm) above the disk surface. In 2011, the flying height in modern drives was a few nanometers. Thus, the head can collide with even an obstruction as thin as a fingerprint or a particle of smoke. Despite the dangers of hard drive failure from such foreign objects, hard drives generally allow for ventilation (albeit through a filter) so that the air pressure within the drive can equalize with the air pressure outside. Because disk drives depend on the head floating on a cushion of air, they are not designed to operate in a vacuum. Regulation of flying height will become even more important in future high-capacity drives. However, hermetically sealed enclosures are beginning to be adopted for hard drives filled with helium gas, with the first products launched in December 2015, starting with capacities of 10 TB.

It was founded in 1861 and joined the Schuylkill Navy in 1865. The Club's boathouse, at #4 Boathouse Row, is also known as the Hollenback House, named for William M. Hollenback, Jr., who served as President of USRowing from 1979 until 1985. Painter Thomas Eakins was most likely a longtime member of Pennsylvania Barge Club. His friend, Max Schmitt, rowed for the club, and won the single sculls championship 6 times. In Schuylkill Navy races, Pennsylvania Barge had 359 entries and 106 victories. Its teams represented the United States in the 1920 (four-with- cox), 1924 (four-with), 1928 (four-with and four-without), and 1932 (pair- with) Olympic Games. As a result of World War II, the club suffered a drastic reduction in membership. In 1955, the Club turned its boathouse over to the Schuylkill Navy. Thereafter, the Pennsylvania Barge Club served as an administrative center for rowing, including serving as Headquarters for the National Association of Amateur Oarsmen, which later became USRowing. The building also housed the Schuylkill Navy, the United States rowing Society (formerly Schuylkill Navy Association), the Philadelphia Scholastic Rowing Association, the Middle States Regatta Association, and the Dad Vail Rowing Association. In 2009, the Club was reactivated and reinstated as a member of the Schuylkill Navy. History of the Boathouse In 1868, the Club received permission from the Fairmount Park Commission to build a replacement for its brick house. Between 1869 and 1871, the Club erected a boathouse with Crescent Boat Club. In 1892, Pennsylvania Barge Club replaced their half of the double boathouse. Architect, Luis Hickman, designed Pennsylvania Barge Club's boathouse in the picturesque Victorian style. Hickman was a member of the T-Square Club and known for his renovation of Merchants' Exchange Building. In 1912, the Club hired C.E. Schermerhorn to add second floor of timber and stucco.

Keys Jr. aka DJ Swamp is an American hip hop DJ, turntablist, producer and vocalist. He was born in Cleveland, Ohio, United States. He currently resides in Los Angeles, United States. In 1996, he won the title of US DMC Champion, his first year entering the tournament. Currently he is touring with the band Ministry. Swamp toured with Beck for four years and later broke away into a solo career with his release \\"Never is Now\\" in 2001. Alternative Press gave \\"Never is Now\\" an 8/10 rating. His follow-up, a drum 'n' bass EP, Instruments of Torture, was recorded with Jack Dangers of Meat Beat Manifesto. Vinyl Disciple produced several music videos, including four 3D music videos. The music video for \\"The Leaders will Follow\\" is the first music video to incorporate 3D video scratching. His music video for \\"Rock Rollin'\\" features Dave England of Jackass fame. DJ Swamp has produced several DJ tools that are considered standards, including \\"skip-proof\\" records, which have the same sample repeated over and over so that if the needle is bumped it will land in the same sample. DJ Swamp's scratch at the beginning of The Crystal Method track \\"Name of the Game\\" is one of his most recognizable scratches. The song is featured in several films, including Tropic Thunder. 1996 US DMC tournament In 1996, as a first time entry, he won the DMC US DJ Championship. He ended his set using pitch manipulation to play Deep Purple's \\"Smoke on the Water\\", followed by him smashing his records. Career with Beck After winning the 1996 US DMC Championships, Swamp found himself still driving a street sweeper for a living in Ohio. He was making calls looking for gigs and a chance to break into the music scene full-time when he heard Beck was going to be in town. He formulated a plan to pose as a reporter and slip in a demo of him mixing and scratching Beck's tracks. He waited for Beck all day but never got to meet him. He did, however, give his demo tape to Beck's publicist. A few weeks later Beck called Swamp and he joined the tour as Beck's DJ. The two toured together for four years. Career with Ministry From 2016-2018 DJ Swamp toured as a member of the band Ministry. Solo career After years of touring with Beck, DJ Swamp released his first album, \\"Never is Now\\", which was supported by the successful single \\"Worship the Robots.\\" The song featured Simple Text voice Fred as the rapper. The text application vocals were chopped up and manipulated to make it more like rap than just spoken text. Also on the album was \\"Disintegrator\\" which was featured in the movie \\"Orgazmo\\" and appeared on the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack. As a solo artist DJ Swamp has opened for such artists as Daft Punk, The Prodigy, Bassnectar, Nero, The Crystal Method, Fatboy Slim, The Chemical Brothers, Mix Master Mike, Datsik, Diesel Boy, Outkast, Fuel, Method Man and Redman. Swamp has built a loyal following around the world appearing in festivals, rock shows, hip-hop shows and even raves. His stage performance consists of him Mixing, Scratching, Magic Tricks and even Emceeing. Crowds are often overwhelmed by his stage presence, heavy bass sound, crowd interaction and give-a-ways. DJ Swamp's scratching can be heard throughout the movie Thirteen which won an Academy Award and was the first movie for director Catherine Hardwicke of Twilight fame. He was featured in the DJ documentary Scratch and the motion picture Clockstoppers. In 1996 DJ Swamp formed Decadent Records, which allowed him to distribute his scratch tools vinyl and digital releases. Under this label he invented several DJ tools that are considered standards, including his infamous \\"skip-proof scratch tool\\" records which have the same sample repeated over and over in a straight line so that if the needle is bumped it will land on the same sample. A technique that has been copied by most battle breaks and scratch records and are a staple in many turntablist sets. Professional appearances DJ Swamp has become the go to man for studio scratching in Los Angeles and has appeared on songs by Beck, The Crystal Method, Vanilla Ice, Katy Perry, Supreme Beings of Leisure, Ben Folds, Belinda, Oblivion Dust, Kid Rock, Twiztid, Blaze Ya Dead Homie, Hanson, The Bloodhound Gang, Morcheeba, The Dandy Warhols, R. L. Burnside, Faithless, OPM, Devo, Save Ferris, Say Anything, Dust Brothers, Kool Keith, Sticky Fingaz, \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic, Death Grips and Better Than Ezra.

History  Following the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate in 1603, Tokugawa Ieyasu appointed his eleventh son, Tokugawa Yorifusa, as daimy≈ç in 1608. With his appointment, Yorifusa became the founding member of the Mito branch of the Tokugawa clan. Along with the Tokugawa branches in Kii and Owari, the Mito branch represented one of three Tokugawa houses known as the Gosanke (\\"three honourable houses of the Tokugawa\\").History of Mito Although the Mito branch held less land and wealth than either of the other two branches, they maintained considerable influence throughout the Edo period. Mito Domain's promiximity to the de facto capital in Edo was a contributing factor to this power as well as the fact that many people unofficially considered the Mito daimy≈ç to be \\"vice-sh≈çgun\\".Koschmann, 2 The Mito branch however, as the lowest of the gosanke, was not eligible for the sh≈çgun rank. Tokugawa Mitsukuni, the third son of Tokugawa Yorifusa, became the second daimy≈ç of Mito in 1661. Mitsukuni further established Mito's status as a respected han by sponsoring the Dai Nihonshi in 1657.Koschmann, 2 The endeavor would launch Mito's reputation as a center for intellectual thought.

Produced by sister cable sports network ESPN, it premiered on April 3, 2010. The two-hour program regularly aired on Saturdays at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time between mid-January and late August (due to the network's college football coverage during the fall) to fill time on weeks when ABC did not air any afternoon sports programming. However, it has since become the ABC simulcast of the ESPN 30 for 30 specials that now air during the Saturday afternoon timeslot on ABC thus officially ending the anthology show. The program featured a hosting segment, originally by Hannah Storm and later various anchors featured on ESPN's flagship program, SportsCenter. It was ultimately dropped in August 2015 due to a change in format thus officially making ESPN Sports Saturday obsolete (sans for its 30 for 30 airings). ESPN, which like ABC is owned by The Walt Disney Company, has handled ABC's sports coverage since 2006 under the ESPN on ABC umbrella, and ESPN Sports Saturday could be considered a descendant of ABC's Wide World of Sports. Content on the series initially included \\"Winners Bracket\\", a segment consisting of highlights, as well as specials sourced from other ESPN documentary programs, including Homecoming with Rick Reilly, 30 for 30 and E:60. Upon the show's return after the 2010 college football season, the \\"Winners Bracket\\" hour of the block was later replaced by a new weekly discussion series that showcased the best of the ESPN sports discussion shows including new exclusive content on the upcoming week's major sporting events. The program was eventually cancelled after 5 seasons in August 2015. This was because ABC gave back the Sunday afternoon schedule to its affiliates 4 months later. Also, with the rise of the Internet and 24/7 mobile applications and streaming services specializing in sports news have completely eliminated the need for a traditional anthology sports program airing on broadcast television (including ABC) during weekend afternoons. It also eliminated the need for a separate Sunday afternoon block on ABC which had seen a long decline until January 2016. It is now simply a simulcast of the 30 for 30 documentary series sourced from ESPN.

Britain's national debt had reached unprecedented levels during the early 1760s following the country's involvement in the Seven Years War which had been very expensive. Lord Bute proposed a tax of four shillings which would be levied on every hogshead of cider made.Anderson p.510-11 This produced an instant reaction from the cider-producing areas, particularly in the West Country which elected many MPs. Riots broke out and there was widespread outrage against the bill. The dispute added to Bute's growing unpopularity and in mid-1763 he stepped down as Prime Minister. His successor George Grenville pushed through the tax, defeating an opposition motion for repeal in February 1764.Lawson p.173-74 The reaction to the tax has been compared to the similar hostility in the American colonies to the Stamp Act of 1765. George Grenville initially went ahead with the Stamp Act because previous bills had not aroused such anger in America as the Cider Tax had in Britain.Anderson p.614 The tax was repealed in 1766.16 Parliamentary History 207. Some of the strongest words in favour of an individual's privacy from government intrusions into the home were made in the attacks opposing enactment and favouring repeal of this tax because excise taxes allowed warrantless searches. One of William Pitt's best known quotes comes from one of his speeches against this tax. It was noticed in Miller v. United States, 357 U.S. 301, 307 (1958). The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution derives from the debates over this tax and over the general warrants issued to suppress anti-Bute publications, especially by John Wilkes and John Entick.

Part I of the book takes as its starting point a reformulation of the marginal productivity theory of wages as determined by supply and demand in full competitive equilibrium of a free market economy. Part II considers regulated labour markets resulting from labour disputes, trade unions and government action. The 2nd edition (1963) includes a harsh critical review and, from Hicks, two subsequent related articles and an extensive commentary. The book presents: * labour demand as derived from the demand for output, such that for example a fall in the wage rate would lead to substitution away from other inputs and more labour use from increased production that the lower wage would facilitate * the first statement of the economic concept of elasticity of substitution, a measure of the substitution effect posited above as to how much one factor of production (say labour) would change to keep output constant in response to a change in relative factor prices * the relation of this concept and its determinants to the distribution of factor-income shares * technical change as biased or neutral (later termed Hicks-neutral technical change), depending on how it affects the marginal product of one productive factor (say labour) relative to that of another (say capital) * a macroeconomic hypothesis about induced innovation that \\"[a] change in the relative prices of the factors of production is itself a spur to invention, and to invention of a particular kind‚Äîdirected to economising the use of a factor which has become relatively expensive,\\" including from one factor (say capital) growing at a faster rate than another (say labour) (p. 124) * elements of employee-employer attachments in distinguishing regular and casual labour with an emphasis on expectations, imperfect information and uncertainty in the labour market * the first-ever attempt to model a labour dispute that might end in a strike.‚Ä¢ Christopher Bliss, 1987 [2008]. ‚ÄúHicks, John Richard,\\" The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics, v. 2, sect. 2, p. 642.

The boathouse Balderston's sketch of Crescent after renovationsBetween 1869 and 1871, Crescent erected a boathouse with Pennsylvania Barge Club. Today, the Club's boathouse exhibits the work of renowned Philadelphia architect Charles Balderston. From 1890 to 1891, Crescent made alterations and additions, designed by Balderston, to the 1871 building. The boathouse was initially two stories of stone, but Balderston's design added the upper stories of half-timbered brick and stucco, which cap the building today. After World War II As a result of World War II, the club suffered a drastic reduction in membership. In 1951, Crescent turned the operation of its boathouse over to LaSalle Rowing Association. The Club was known as LaSalle Rowing Association until 1960. By 1974, the boathouse was vacant. Under the leadership of John Wilkins, the house was later reoccupied by Crescent. In addition to hosting LaSalle's team, Crescent also hosted the St. Joseph's University women's team and the men's team from Roman Catholic High School.

Work as he appeared in 1905. John McClelland Work (1869‚Äì1961) was an American socialist writer, lecturer, activist, and political functionary. Work is best remembered as a founding member of the Socialist Party of America and as the author of one of its best-selling propaganda tracts of the first decade of the 20th Century. He was also the Executive Secretary of the Socialist Party of America from 1911 to 1913 and a frequent candidate for public office on its ticket. Biography=Early years John M. Work was born January 3, 1869, in rural Washington County in Southeastern Iowa, the son of John H. Work, a farmer.Solon DeLeon with Irma C. Hayssen and Grace Poole (eds.), The American Labor Who's Who. New York: Hanford Press, 1925; pg. 255. In September 1886, Work left the family farm in Dutch Creek Township and went off to school. He stayed close to home, attending the non-denominational religious preparatory school Washington Academy, in nearby Washington, Iowa, returning home on weekends to help with the farm work.John M. Work, Glances at My Life. Madison: Wisconsin Historical Society Micro 869, 1958; ch. 1, pg. 1. Work graduated the Academy in June 1889, part of a graduating class of 8. Following graduation from Washington Academy, Work began studying law in the office of an elderly lawyer in Washington who was a friend of the Work family, with John running errands.Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 2, pg. 1. After a year he returned to the farm to help with the summer work before enrolling in Monmouth College in Monmouth, Illinois, a United Presbyterian school which often sent its graduates on to theological seminaries.Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 1, pg. 15. Work entered with Senior class status and graduated in June 1891 with a Bachelor of Arts degree.Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 2, pg. 5. While in college, Work was a supporter of the Prohibition Party.Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 3, pg. 4. Upon graduation, Work took a job at a weekly newspaper published in Monmouth, gathering local news and soliciting advertising. He was a failure as an ad salesman, however, and was fired after just six weeks. Work decided to attend the United Presbyterian Theological Seminary at Allegheny, Pennsylvania in the fall of 1892. Upon arrival, Work found the seminary \\"cheerless and uninviting\\" and spontaneously decided to hop a train for Washington, D.C. to attend Columbian Law School, now part of George Washington University.Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 2, pg. 6. Work graduated in June 1892 with a degree of Bachelor of Laws.Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 2, pg. 10. After passing the Iowa State Bar exam, Work began to practice law in Des Moines, Iowa. He also joined the Young Men's Republican Club in Des Moines and was a delegate to a national convention of Republican clubs in Louisville, Kentucky in 1893.Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 3, pg. 1. He remained a Republican until 1896 and practiced law until 1900. Work married a former classmate at Monmouth College, Lucy Josephine Hoisington, on June 24, 1896, in Monmouth, Illinois.Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 3, pg. 2. The pair had a daughter, Josephine, in April 1897. In the fall of 1896, Work began studying various social remedies at the Des Moines Public Library, preparing for a public lecture against socialism. During the course of his studies, Work read The Co-operative Commonwealth by Laurence Gronlund. He later recalled: Work became absorbed with advancing the socialist idea. His law practice suffered as a result.Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 3, pg. 10. Political career John M. Work was a founding member of the Socialist Party of America in August 1901. Work was the organizer of the first branch of the formed Social Democratic Party of America of Iowa and attended the Iowa state convention of the newly formed organization in 1899. The gathering was attended by about 50 delegates from 11 of the state's 99 counties. Work was elected secretary of the state organization and given the task of preparing a state platform.Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 3, pg. 13. Work's first published article on socialism, entitled \\"Credential of Socialism,\\" was published in the Des Moines Iowa Unionist in January 1900. That fall he also addressed his first \\"street meeting\\" as a soapboxer on behalf of the Social Democratic Party, speaking for half an hour.Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 3, pg. 15. Work would subsequently tour the nation speaking to public audiences on socialist themes. In December 1900, Work went to Minnesota to await a forthcoming national convention of the Social Democratic Party, called for January 15, 1901 in Chicago, but fell ill and had to return to Iowa, missing the gathering.Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 3, pg. 17. In July 1901, Work was the delegate of the Des Moines branch of the Social Democratic Party to the Unity Convention which established the Socialist Party of America (SPA). Although taken aback by the \\"lack of brotherliness\\" displayed by many of the delegates, Work remained active in the new organization. In October 1901, he was elected by referendum vote of the membership as the Socialist Party of Iowa's delegate to the governing National Committee of the SPA.Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 3, pg. 19. Beginning at this time, Work also periodically contributed material to the Iowa Socialist, the newspaper of the Iowa party, the Chicago Socialist, and The Coming Nation (later gaining fame as The Appeal to Reason.)Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 3, pg. 32. In 1902, Work was the candidate of the Socialist Party for Mayor of Des Moines. He ran the next year for Governor of Iowa for the first time). When the SPA briefly moved its headquarters to Omaha, Nebraska in 1903, Work by virtue of his status as National Committee member of an adjacent state became a member of the so-called \\"National Quorum,\\" which acted as a de facto executive committee in between annual meetings of the National Committee.Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 3, pg. 34. Work was joined in this position by Barney Berlyn of Illinois, Stephen M. Reynolds of Indiana, Charles Dobbs of Kentucky, and Victor L. Berger of Wisconsin. The party moved its headquarters again, this time to Chicago, in 1904. Work was a delegate to the 1904 National Convention of the Socialist Party, held in Chicago. This convention established an elected 7 member National Executive Committee to handle matters of party governance in between annual sessions of the National Committee, a group which was at the same time expanded to enhance representation by large states. Work and the others of the National Quorum were reappointed until the new constitution could be ratified by the membership of the SPA.Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 3, pg. 38. In January 1905, Work wrote an introductory work on socialism called What's So and What Isn't. The short book was frequently reprinted and became his best known writing, one of the Socialist Party's propaganda standards of the Debs era. The first 10,000 copies of the work appeared as the March 1905 number of Wayland's Monthly.Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 3, pg. 40. The book would ultimately be published in over a dozen editions, with a total print run of well over 165,000 copies.For the printing count, see: What's So and What Isn't (Revised Edition). Chicago: National Office of the Socialist Party, 1916; pg. 1. The first edition of Work's best- selling introduction to socialism, What's So and What Isn't, appeared as the March 1905 issue of Wayland's Monthly. Work introduced five amendments to the SPA's national constitution in 1905, one of which made the National Executive Committee directly elected by the party membership instead of by the National Committee; another which made the party's Executive Secretary electable by the membership instead of by the National Committee, and a third which caused all amendments to the national constitution to be presented to the membership seriatim, so that individual parts of the proposal could be accepted or declined on their own merits. These proposals were overwhelmingly carried by the party membership in December 1905 and became a regular part of party life.Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 3, pg. 42. In January 1906, Work was reelected to the SPA's NEC on the first ballot, receiving 32 of the 45 votes cast. This was the last NEC elected by the National Committee, since the passage of Work's constitutional amendment had come too close to the January deadline to take immediate effect. Work was also reelected to the National Committee by the Socialist Party of Iowa in February of that same year.Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 3, pg. 43. In 1906, Work revised and shortened What's So and What Isn't so that The Appeal to Reason could issue it as a new 10 cent pamphlet. The book was again revised with the addition of five new chapters for 1,000 copies of a clothbound edition by Charles H. Kerr & Co. that same summer. Although stated as the Third Edition, this actually constituted the Fourth Edition of the work.Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 3, pg. 44. A slightly corrected hardcover Fifth Edition followed from Kerr the next year.Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 3, pg. 46. In January 1907, Work was again returned to the Socialist Party's 7 member NEC, this time by vote of the party membership in referendum. Joining Work on this first membership-elected committee were Morris Hillquit and Ben Hanford of New York, Ernest Untermann of Florida, A.M. Simons and Joseph Medill Patterson of Illinois, and Victor L. Berger of Wisconsin. Together with Hillquit and Simons, Work was part of a committee of three given the task of preparing the Socialist Party's 1908 platform. Work prepared and circulated a so-called \\"minority report\\" written in simple to understand language, while the erudite Hillquit prepared a version more to his liking. In his memoirs, Work later recalled exchanging mean-spirited words with Hillquit over the two drafts, with Hillquit calling Work's version \\"kindergartenish,\\" while Work retorted that Hillquit's version was \\"sophomoric.\\"Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 3, pg. 51. Neither version was ultimately accepted. Work was an employee of the National Office of the Socialist Party in August and September 1908, during which time he prepared the proceedings of the 1908 National Convention for publication. At the same time he appeared on the ballot as a candidate for U.S. Senate. Work was defeated in his attempt for re-election to the NEC in the party referendum election of January 1910. In the aftermath, Work was asked by National Executive Secretary J. Mahlon Barnes to take a job in the National Office, handling literature and supplies and working to develop organizations in unorganized states. Work accepted the offer.Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 4, pg. 1. Work also attended the 1910 National Congress of the Socialist Party as a delegate, delivering the report on organization on behalf of the NEC. He was also the candidate of the Socialist Party for Governor of Iowa in the fall of that year. In August 1911, Mahlon Barnes was forced to resign as Executive Secretary, revealed by a NEC investigation to have placed the mother of his illegitimate child on the party payroll.Ira Kipnis, The American Socialist Movement, 1897-1912. New York: Columbia University Press, 1952; pg. 380. John Work was selected by the NEC to take his place on an interim basis, beginning September 1.\\"News from National Socialist Headquarters,\\" The Socialist [Columbus, OH], vol. 1, no. 37 (Sept. 2, 1911), pg. 3. A referendum was held to formally fill the position that fall, an election in which Work was elected over J.O. Bentall, 22,081 to 6,449.Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 4, pg. 11. As Executive Secretary of the Socialist Party, Work found himself in the spotlight, the recipient of criticism and the object of political machinations. The rurally-raised Christian Socialist Work often found himself at loggerheads with de facto party leader Morris Hillquit, an eloquent urban Marxist. Hillquit plainly sought Work's removal as Executive Secretary. As chairman of the Constitution Committee at the 1912 National Convention of the Socialist Party Hillquit oversaw an amendment returning the selection of the SPA's Executive Secretary to the National Committee. For his part Work was unhappy that Hillquit had reintegrated his personal friend and close political associate Mahlon Barnes into the National Office as the 1912 Socialist campaign manager, a newly created post serving at the pleasure of the NEC rather than the Executive Secretary. When Barnes incurred a $12,000 deficit in the running of the campaign, Work bitterly remonstrated that Barnes had used the regular funds of the party without authorization instead of specially earmarked campaign funds.David A. Shannon, The Socialist Party of America: A History. New York: Macmillan, 1955; pg. 76. Not surprisingly, the return of Executive Secretary selection to the inner circle of the National Committee spelled the end of Work's tenure in the position. Work was cast aside by the National Committee at its 1913 meeting in favor of Walter Lanfersiek, with Lanfersiek garnering 37 votes to 9 for Work, with left wingers Frank Bohn and J.E. Snyder trailing with 8 and 5 votes, respectively.Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 4, pg. 21. This marked the first time in its history that a sitting Executive Secretary of the Socialist Party had failed in his bid for re- election.Kipnis, The American Socialist Movement, pg. 187. After a six-week lecture tour of Illinois on behalf of the state Socialist Party organization in that state, Work left the party's employment to take a job as a teacher of law at LaSalle Extension University in Illinois, a post which he continued for the next four academic years. The school had obtained over 3,000 socialist correspondence students, largely through its advertising in The Appeal to Reason, and actively sought a qualified socialist teacher for their instruction. Work was hired as a correspondence teacher of law.Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 4, pg. 30. Work ran two political campaigns in 1914, making a try for Chicago city alderman in the spring and appearing on the ballot as a Socialist for U.S. Congress in the 10th District of Illinois in the fall. With election of the NEC returned to direct election by the party membership in 1916, Work chose to run again for the body. In a vote closing in May 1916 he joined Victor Berger, Morris Hillquit, Anna A. Maley, and John Spargo on the 5 person NEC. He remained in that position until the Socialist Party split of 1919. In June 1916, Work was nominated by the state convention of the Socialist Party of Illinois as its candidate for governor. In the spring of 1917, Work was an alternate delegate to the 1917 Emergency National Convention of the Socialist Party in St. Louis. While he had been opposed to the calling of the special convention, he was supportive of the aggressive anti-war declaration drafted by Hillquit, C.E. Ruthenberg, and Algernon Lee which was passed by the convention and later ratified in referendum vote of the party membership. That fall, Work stood as the Socialist Party's candidate for Superior Judge in Chicago, having retained his citizenship in Illinois despite taking a job as an editorial writer in Milwaukee. Work was not a delegate to the 1919 Emergency National Convention of the Socialist Party, at which the party split into three rival organizations. Work was the Socialist Party's candidate in the 1925 special election to fill the seat of Wisconsin U.S. Senator Robert M. La Follette, who had died in office. Thereafter, Work largely contained his Socialist Party activity to journalism, making an exception to run for delegate to the 1936 National Convention. A known opponent of the 1934 Declaration of Principles, Work was defeated in his bid for full delegate status and was elected instead as an alternate. He chose not to attend but neither did he follow the so-called \\"Old Guard\\" out of the party into a new rival organization called the Social Democratic Federation. \\"I believed that the Socialist Party would get over this spell of 'the measles,' and I stayed in it ‚Äî and my belief turned out to be correct,\\" he later recalled in his memoirs.Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 5, pg. 63. Work did not lay an active role in Socialist Party affairs again until the middle 1940s, when the 75-year-old Work was elected a delegate to the 1946 National Convention of the Socialist Party in Chicago. Journalistic career In May 1917, Victor L. Berger offered John Work, his colleague on the NEC, a position as an editorial writer at The Milwaukee Leader, of which Berger was editor-in- chief. The previous editorial writer, James R. \\"Jim\\" Howe, had recently died and Berger was in need of an immediate replacement. Work accepted and on May 17, 1917, took over as the editor of the editorial page,Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 5, pg. 9. writing the unsigned daily editorials on the left side of the page. The Leader, as an anti-war publication, drew the ire of the Wilson administration and its Postmaster General, Albert S. Burleson and in October 1917 had its Second Class mailing privileges revoked. In August 1918 the publication was deprived of the right to receive First Class mail, with all letters from subscribers and readers sent to the publication summarily returned to sender with the envelope stamped \\"Mail to This Address Undeliverable Under Espionage Act.\\"Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 5, pg. 12. Despite the attack, loyal Milwaukee readers and advertisers rallied around the paper with monetary donations and the publication survived the attack. Through it all, Work wrote extensively on anti-militarist themes including, according to his own testimony, four of the five editorials for which Victor Berger was indicted by a grand jury in Chicago in December 1918.Work, Glances at My Life, ch. 5, pg. 19. After the termination of the Milwaukee Leader in 1942, Work wrote a series of texts on legal themes which were published through LaSalle Extension University. Death and legacy John Work died just two days after his 92nd birthday, on January 5, 1961 in Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin. John Work's papers are housed by the Milwaukee Public Library. The collection is contained 7 manuscript boxes and is available to scholars, who should contact the library in advance in order to work the papers. There is no on-line finding aid. The manuscripts of four unpublished autobiographical works by John M.

Migration During the ascension of the mythical Raksha demon King Ravana, some Deva people migrated to other places like present-day North Malabar of Kerala where they followed Buddhism before the advent of Brahminism. Having their own complete social fabric and systems of precedence and worship, they dominated the area until their power was seriously undermined by the Brahmin lead power lobby. However, they still survive in Malabar, and are known as \\"Thiyya\\", a localization of the name \\"Deyva\\" equivalent to Deva. The ancestor worship of Thiyyas springs from the fact that they consider themselves as descendants of \\"Deyva\\" or God. The ceremonial oracles, who represent the spirit of their ancestors of Lanka, in the temple are known as \\"Theyyam\\", originating from the word \\"Deyvam\\" meaning God. However, by the time of the arrival of Vijaya to Sri Lanka, a significant number of the Deva clan had intermingled with North Indians, Nagas and Yaksas, to create the Modern Sinhalese lineage.

Hence 19th century biographical criticism came under disapproval by the so-called New Critics of the 1920s, who coined the term \\"biographical fallacy\\"Lees, Francis Noel (1967) \\"The Keys Are at the Palace: A Note on Criticism and Biography\\" pp. 135-149 In Damon, Philip (editor) (1967) Literary Criticism and Historical Understanding: Selected Papers from the English Institute Columbia University Press, New York, Discussed extensively in Frye, Herman Northrop (1947) Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, page 326 and following, to describe criticism that neglected the imaginative genesis of literature. Notwithstanding this critique, biographical criticism remained a significant mode of literary inquiry throughout the 20th century, particularly in studies of Charles Dickens and F. Scott Fitzgerald, among others. The method continues to be employed in the study of such authors as John Steinbeck,Benson, Jackson J. (1989) \\"Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism\\" College Literature 16(29): pp. 107-116, page 108 Walt WhitmanKnoper, Randall (2003)\\"Walt Whitman and New Biographical Criticism\\" College Literature 30(1): pp. 161-168 and William Shakespeare.Schiffer, James (ed), Shakespeare's Sonnets: Critical Essays (1999),pp. 19-27, 40-43, 45, 47, 395  Peripatetic biographical criticism  In The Cambridge history of literary criticism: Classical criticism, in a chapter titled \\"Peripatetic Biographical Criticism\\", George Alexander Kennedy notes that in the Hellenistic age, \\"The works of authors were read as sources of information about their lives, personalities and interests. Some of this material was then used by other commentators and critics to explain passages in their works. The process became a circular one in that, though Peripatetic biographers utilized external evidence where available, they had little to go on and quarried the texts for hints\\".George Alexander Kennedy, The Cambridge history of literary criticism: Classical criticism, page 205, Cambridge University Press, 1989  Recognition of otherness  Jackson J. Benson describes the form as a \\"'recognition of 'otherness'‚Äîthat there is an author who is different in personality and background from the reader‚Äîappears to be a simple-minded proposition. Yet as a basic prerequisite to the understanding and evaluation of a literary text it is often ignored even by the most sophisticated literary critics. The exploration of otherness is what literary biography and biographical criticism can do best, discovering an author as a unique individual, a discovery that puts a burden on us to reach out to recognize that uniqueness before we can fully comprehend an author's writings.'\\"Benson, Jackson J. (1989) \\"Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism\\" College Literature 16(29): pp. 107-116, page 108 Connections to other modes of criticism Biographical criticism shares in common with New Historicism an interest in the fact that all literary works are situated in specific historical and biographical contexts from which they are generated. Biographical Criticism, like New Historicism, rejects the concept that literary studies should be limited to the internal or formal characteristics of a literary work, and insists that it properly includes a knowledge of the contexts in which the work was created. Biographical criticism stands in ambiguous relationship to Romanticism. It has often been argued that it is a development from Romanticism, but it also stands in opposition to the Romantic tendency to view literature as manifesting a \\"universal\\" transcendence of the particular conditions of its genesis.  Assessments of biographical criticism and literary biography  In The Art of Literary Biography (1995), John Worthen writes: : > 'The fact that we want an emergent sense of the inevitable development > suggests the enormously soothing quality which biographies have come to have > in our age. Not only do biographies suggest that things as difficult as > human lives can ‚Äì for all their obvious complexity ‚Äì be summed up, known, > comprehended: they reassure us that, while we are reading, a world will be > created in which there are few or no unclear motives, muddled decisions, or > (indeed) loose ends.'John Worthen, 'The Necessary Ignorance of a > Biographer,' in John Batchelor (ed.)

Because of Pitt's former prominence before his title, it is sometimes referred to as the Pitt ministry. Unusually for a politician considered to be Prime Minister, Pitt was not First Lord of the Treasury during the administration, but instead held the post of Lord Privy Seal.  History  Pitt, who moved to the House of Lords as Earl of Chatham upon his accession to the ministry, was determined to form a ministry of \\"measures, not men\\" that would give office to the most competent men without regard to faction. Thus, the ministry kept on Secretary of State Henry Seymour Conway from the previous, Rockingham Whig, ministry, and, after Chatham's brother-in-law Lord Temple refused the Treasury and decided to continue in opposition with his brother, former prime minister George Grenville, he promoted Conway's fellow Rockingham Whig the Duke of Grafton to that position. Chatham's own close associates Lord Camden and Lord Shelburne became Lord Chancellor and Southern Secretary of State, respectively, and the ministry was filled out with other politicians of unclear factional allegiance ‚Äì keeping on Lord Egmont at the Admiralty and Lord Granby at the Ordnance Board, moving the former Lord Chancellor, Lord Northington to the sinecure position of Lord President of the Council, and appointing the slippery Charles Townshend to the Exchequer. Chatham was ill with gout for long periods, and his government struggled to fulfill its various goals. Almost immediately its \\"measures, not men\\" philosophy began to come apart when Lord Egmont resigned the Admiralty due to his opposition to Chatham's foreign policy and was replaced by the Rockingham Whig Sir Charles Saunders. Its major foreign policy objective ‚Äì to secure Britain a major alliance partner in Europe that would end its diplomatic isolation ‚Äì failed when Frederick the Great of Prussia rejected an offer to reform the Anglo- Prussian Alliance. Soon after, Chatham managed to largely alienate the heretofore cautiously friendly Rockingham faction by dismissing their ally Lord Edgcumbe, the Treasurer of the Household. Though both Grafton, who had already been moving away from the Rockinghams due to his strong admiration for Pitt, and Conway remained in the ministry, Saunders and a large number of non- cabinet officeholders from the Rockingham faction resigned their positions. Though Saunders was replaced by the competent Admiral Sir Edward Hawke, most of the other positions were given to former supporters of the royal favourite Lord Bute, increasing the unpopularity of the ministry and strengthening the opposition. At around the same time, and with Chatham absent from the capital, the ministry was further riven by Chancellor Townshend's introduction of the idea of what was to become the Townshend Duties on the American colonies, which strongly divided the ministry. In the midst of this crisis in early 1767 Chatham apparently had a nervous breakdown and withdrew entirely from the conduct of affairs. Grafton attempted to maintain the ministry in his absence, but with difficulty due to the alliance between the three opposition factions of the Rockingham Whigs, Bedford Whigs, and Grenvillites and to conflicts within the ministry itself. After an unsuccessful attempt to bring his former allies in the Rockingham faction to support the government, Grafton instead turned to the Bedfords, leading to a major reconstruction of the ministry in late 1767 and early 1768, with Bedford's followers Lord Gower and Lord Weymouth as Lord President and Northern Secretary (Conway became a minister without portfolio), and the like-minded Lord Hillsborough given the new office of Secretary of State for the Colonies ‚Äì taking responsibility for the American colonies from the more conciliatory Shelburne, whose differences with the rest of the cabinet had led him to cease attendance at cabinet meetings. The death of Charles Townshend had also led to his replacement at the Exchequer by Lord North, who also took leadership of the commons over from Conway, who was increasingly uncomfortable with the direction of the ministry. The adhesion of the Bedfords ultimate gave them a dominant role in the ministry, which they used to pursue a more hardline policy towards the American colonies than Chatham had originally intended, or than several of the remaining were comfortable with. In October 1768, the Bedfords persuaded Grafton that it would be necessary to remove Shelburne from the ministry. This threatened dismissal roused Chatham, who resigned his post alongside Shelburne. Although Chatham's close friend Camden remained in the government, it was clear that the ministry was now dominated by the Bedfords, and the Duke of Grafton formally took over as Prime Minister and led the Grafton ministry, which lasted for slightly over a year until January 1770.

Measures of \\"relevance\\" IR (information retrieval) evaluation begins whenever a user submits a query (search term) to a database. If the user is able to determine the relevance of each document in the database (relevant or not relevant), then for each query, the complete set of documents is naturally divided into four distinct (mutually exclusive) subsets: relevant documents that are retrieved, not relevant documents that are retrieved, relevant documents that are not retrieved, and not relevant documents that are not retrieved. These four subsets (of documents) are denoted by the letters a,b,c,d respectively and are called Swets variables, named after their inventor.Swets, J.A. (1969). Effectiveness of information retrieval methods. American Documentation, 20(1), 72-89. In addition to the Swets definitions, four relevance metrics have also been defined: Precision refers to the fraction of relevant documents that are retrieved (a/(a+b)), and Recall refers to the fraction of retrieved documents that are relevant (a/(a+c)). These are the most commonly used and well-known relevance metrics found in the IR evaluation literature. Two less commonly used metrics include the Fallout, i.e., the fraction of not relevant documents that are retrieved (b/(b+d)), and the Miss, which refers to the fraction of relevant documents that are not retrieved (c/(c+d)) during any given search. Universal IR evaluation techniques Universal IR evaluation addresses the mathematical possibilities and relationships among the four relevance metrics Precision, Recall, Fallout and Miss, denoted by P, R, F and M, respectively. One aspect of the problem involves finding a mathematical derivation of a complete set of universal IR evaluation points.Schatkun, M. (2010). A Second look at Egghe's universal IR surface and a simple derivation of a complete set of universal IR evaluation points. Information Processing & Management, 46(1), 110-114. The complete set of 16 points, each one a quadruple of the form (P,R,F,M), describes all the possible universal IR outcomes. For example, many of us have had the experience of querying a database and not retrieving any documents at all. In this case, the Precision would take on the undetermined form 0/0, the Recall and Fallout would both be zero, and the Miss would be any value greater than zero and less than one (assuming a mix of relevant and not relevant documents were in the database, none of which were retrieved). This universal IR evaluation point would thus be denoted by (0/0, 0, 0, M), which represents only one of the 16 possible universal IR outcomes. The mathematics of universal IR evaluation is a fairly new subject since the relevance metrics P,R,F,M were not analyzed collectively until recently (within the past decade). A lot of the theoretical groundwork has already been formulated, but new insights in this area await discovery. For a detailed mathematical analysis, a query in the ScienceDirect database for \\"universal IR evaluation\\" retrieves several relevant peer-reviewed papers.

Nazi Imprisonment Princz is notable for among other things being an American citizen at the time of his imprisonment in 1940, his denial of reparations by the West German government and their successor, the government of a unified Germany, based in part to his American citizenship and his decades-long legal battle to collect a $500-a-month pension.  History  Princz' father Herman was a U.S. citizen therefore his citizenship was conferred upon his children. Princz and his family who were Jewish, were living in the former Czechoslovakia in 1939, were his father worked leasing combine harvesters to Czech farmers during the harvest. Soon after the annexation of Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany, on September 1, 1939 World War II started. In March 1942, they were detained by the Slovak Fascist police as enemy aliens. Custody of the family was turned over to the German SS, who confiscated their American passports and other identifying papers proving their American citizenship. Instead of being swapped in a Red Cross-sponsored exchange of prisoners, as most other American civilians were, the family was taken to Majdanek. He was uncertain of the fate of his parents Herman and Gisella and sister Irene, he believes they perished in Treblinka concentration camp. Another sister Yolanda was subjected to medical experiments at Auschwitz by Josef Mengele, and subsequently died. Princz along with his brothers Arthur and Alex were deported to Auschwitz where he was tattooed with the number 36707. He was leased out to I.G. Farben to work in the Buna-Werke industrial complex as a bricklayer, by the SS, as a skilled laborer for 4 Reichsmarks per day. Both his brothers were also leased to I.G. Farben. According to Princz, Alex starved to death and Arthur was beaten severely for bringing him food then was executed. An older brother Eugene living in Hungary at the time they were arrested was killed, and a married sister Elsa also living in Hungary was never heard from again. Princz was sent on a death march to Dachau to work repairing bomb damage to an underground Messerschmitt airplane factory. He was among a group of prisoners on a transport train headed toward the Alps on April 29, 1945 that was intercepted by an American armored unit when it stopped in Poing, Germany. \\"USA\\" had been stitched onto his uniform to identify his nationality, due to this the American troops sent him to a U.S. Military hospital.  Fight for Compensation  After the I.G. Farben trial at Nuremberg, I.G. Farben was broken up into the six original companies that existed prior to their merger. Three of the larger companies were BASF, Hoechst AG and Bayer. They were ordered to pay reparations prior to resuming business in the United States. The three companies set up a compensation fund which was combined with the one set up by West Germany's government. An office was established in New York City to handle claims and payments. Hugo Princz first applied for compensation in 1955 for his. His claim was rejected that November Germany claimed that he was \\"An American citizen at the time of your persecution and the further reason that on Jan. 1, 1947, you were not a resident within the territory of the German Reich, you are not entitled to a claim for compensation\\". Germany's defense against non-payment was sovereign immunity. The Trial Peter Heidenberger, represented Germany in the court case in Washington, D.C. stated to the press that: \\"The German government very much regrets what happened to Mr. Princz . . . and after the war passed various laws compensating individuals like Mr. Princz for the wrongs they suffered.\\" ...the original law compensating Holocaust victims covered only refugees and not U.S. citizens,... and Princz missed a 1969 deadline for filing a claim under a 1965 law that did hold the possibility of some relief.... Princz alleges that his enslavement at the behest of I.G. Farben and Messerschmitt was a commercial enterprise exempt under the 1976 Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act. Congressional Support In 1984, Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) acted on Pincz's behalf and had the State Department press his claim. Officials from the German Embassy in Washington acted on his behalf as well. In 1987 the West German Foreign Ministry in Bonn would still not approve payment. In October, 1990 after the merger of East and West Germany, senator, Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) acted on his behalf to try apply diplomatic pressure on Germany. \\"To them, this has become a matter of national honor,\\" Princz's lawyer, Perles, says of the German government. \\"When I first took the case in 1986, I expected to be done with it in 90 days. They admit this happened, they say they're sorry for it, but they're not going to pay.\\" In July 1994, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the ruling. The Supreme Court upheld the appeals court. The, in 1995, Prince sued the German companies for whom he was forced to work while he was a prisoner at Auschwitz. In 1995, after President Bill Clinton personally raised Mr. Princz's case with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Germany agreed to pay reparations. He eventually won part of a 2.1 million dollar settlement, shared with 11 others, after legal expenses, reached in part due to a settlement between the U.S. Justice Department and Germany.#029: 01-23-97 - Attorney General Reno Announces Upcoming Deadline ...One of these Americans was Hugo Princz, a survivor of Auschwitz and Dachau, ...Full text of \\"The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act : hearing before the Subcommittee on Courts and Administrative Practice of the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, One Hundred Third Congress, second session on S. 825 ...

The company manufactured hand tools that were sold under other brands, including private-label brands such as Craftsman and Husky. It was a subsidiary of Ideal Industries. The company was the largest American manufacturer of screwdrivers, though the company was relatively unknown because it sold no tools under its own name.  History  Western Forge was founded in Defiance, Ohio in 1965 as a joint venture between Sears and C. William Schlosser to make torque wrenches. In 1966, it relocated to Colorado Springs, Colorado, where it built a new manufacturing facility. In the next few years, the company began producing screwdrivers, punches, chisels, adjustable wrenches, and pliers.. The company's slogan at one time was \\"Mile High Quality\\" (in reference to the relatively dry Colorado manufacturing location). In 1976, Western Forge shipped its 100 millionth Craftsman screwdriver. In 2008, the company produced its billionth screwdriver overall. In 1978, Western Forge applied for and received its USA trademark. They produced and test marketed a line of hand tools branded with their own name. In 1981, the company was acquired by Emerson Electric. In the late 1990s, Western Forge moved its screwdriver production to a plant in Murphy, North Carolina. In April 2006, it closed the plant and consolidated its operations in Colorado Springs, citing declining sales. The company received $200,000 in cash incentives from the City of Colorado Springs and the Colorado Springs Economic Development Corporation to stay in Colorado Springs. Sears Craftsman products (and others) that are produced by Western Forge are marked with a \\"WF\\" on them. In 2007, the company was acquired by MW Universal. In 2010, it was acquired by Ideal Industries. In April 2017, Ideal declined to renew its contract with Sears and stopped supplying it with tools. Sears filed a lawsuit against the company in June, contending that it was not honoring the terms of its supply agreement. Sears Craftsman tools that were previously produced by Western Forge in the US are now supplied by an Asian supplier. In February 2020, Ideal announced that it would close the Western Forge manufacturing plant, laying off all 164 employees. Ideal had attempted to sell the facility but was unsuccessful. Ideal CEO Steve Henn said in a statement, \\"This was a long and carefully considered decision. Our Western Forge employees delivered high quality product and did everything we asked of them to help us maintain the business.

Mike storms off, and wanders aimlessly as he contemplates suicide while flashing back to his time with Sharon, and a childhood incident where he cut himself with a razor while playing truth or dare? Mike picks up a female hitchhiker, and the two go to a campsite, where they play truth or dare? The game turns violent, and ends when a park ranger finds Mike, who had mutilated himself at the behest of the hitchhiker, who was just a hallucination. Mike is admitted to the Sunnyville Mental Institution, and is released over a year later due to good behavior, overcrowding, and budget cuts. Immediately after being discharged, Mike tracks down and murders Jerry, and is readmitted to Sunnyville after being wounded while trying to kill Sharon. Once back in Sunnyville, Mike hallucinates playing ‚Äòtruth or dare?‚Äô with two disfigured patients, and cuts most of his own face off with a knife he had smuggled into the facility. Five months later, Mike, who has taken to wearing a frowning copper mask, goes berserk in his room after an employee taunts him by giving him a picture of Sharon. When an orderly tries to calm him, Mike stabs the man in the eye with a pencil, then escapes the institution, hijacking a car full of weapons on his way out. Mike goes on a rampage, indiscriminately slaughtering men, women, and children on his way to Sharon's house. Realizing where Mike is going, Detective Rosenberg and Doctor Thorne head there, with Thorne arriving first. Thorne is unable to save Sharon, and is killed in a shootout with Mike. Rosenberg happens upon Mike, bleeding heavily from being shot by Thorne, and manages to talk him down, and disarm him. Mike is taken by paramedics, and placed back in Sunnyville.

It was shot on location in Palm Beach County, Florida.Kathryn B., The Palm Beach Post, Entertainment Section, June 1986, Article: Teen Puts Screams on Video Screens  Reception  Tom Becker of DVD Verdict wrote that Truth or Dare? was \\"a typical, entertaining, and typically entertaining low-budget, direct-to-home-video '80s slasher/horror entry. It contains all the requisites: some nudity, lots of violence (some graphic, all cheesy), a masked madman, and plot holes so glaring, it seems like big chunks of the film are just missing (they aren't)\\".  Sequels  The film was followed by three sequels, all of them written and directed by Tim Ritter, and released direct-to-video. They are 1994's Wicked Games, 1998's Screaming for Sanity: Truth or Dare 3, and 2011's Deadly Dares: Truth or Dare Part IV. Funds for a fifth film, titled I Dared You! Truth or Dare 5, were raised by Ritter and Scott Tepperman through the crowdsourcing website Indiegogo. I Dared You! saw its official DVD release in March 2018. An unofficial sequel called Writer's Block (subtitled Truth or Dare 2 in some versions) was released by Dead Alive Productions in 1995.

Despite opposition from some quarters, by September 2010, 424 GP practices across at least 36 primary care trusts had uploaded 2.7 million Summary Care Records.Summary Care Record rollout pushes ahead as National Programme for IT axed published 2010-09-10, accessed 2011-01-13 On 10 October 2010, the Health Secretary announced that the coalition government would continue with the introduction, but that the records would 'hold only the essential medical information needed in an emergency ‚Äì that is medication, allergen and [drug] reactions'.Lansley confirms summary care record roll-out will proceed Health Service Journal, published 2010-10-11, accessed 2011-01-13 By March 2013, more than 24 million SCRs had been created across England. Content Access to data is available to NHS personnel anywhere in England, but only if they have had the correct access rights on their smartcard approved by senior management . Pharmacists in five regions were given read-only access in an NHS England pilot in October 2014 so they could verify and compare a patient's medicines during medicine use reviews. Patients were able to view their own records via the HealthSpace website, which closed down in December 2012. Initial content The initial content of the database was to include the following: * Drugs which the patient has been prescribed * Known adverse reactions to drugs * Known allergies * In his announcement on 10 October 2010, the Health Secretary implied that its scope would in future be restricted to these three items, stating but that it would 'hold only the essential medical information needed in an emergency ‚Äì that is medication, allergen and [drug] reactions'. It also stated however that additional information can be added at the specific request of the patient. Planned future content It was originally intended that the database system would be upgraded in the future to add: * Accident and Emergency discharge summaries * Inpatient discharge summaries * Outpatient discharge summaries * Out of Hours GP service encounters * Health and Social Care Common Assessment Framework Plans * Contributions submitted by patients to their records via the HealthSpace website However, following the Government announcement in October 2010 this is no longer envisaged. Implementation Initial plans were that patients' records would be automatically be uploaded, without seeking patient consent.From cradle to grave, your files available to a cast of thousands The Guardian, November 1, 2006 In December 2006, Sir Liam Donaldson, the Chief Medical Officer, wrote to GPs telling them that letters from patients requesting that their records should not be uploaded should be sent to Patricia Hewitt, the health secretary, for 'full consideration', causing consternation among privacy campaigners.GPs angered by call to reveal names of NHS database rebels The Guardian, December 2, 2006 Opting-out introduced As a result of pressure from privacy campaigners, the British Medical Association (BMA), the Ethics Committee of the Royal College of General Practitioners, and a report by the Department of Health's 'patients tsar' Harry Cayton (the Report of the Ministerial Taskforce on the Summary Care RecordReport of the Ministerial Taskforce on the Summary Care Record, Department of Health, December 6, 2006), the Government agreed that patients would be able to opt out of the Summary Care Record.Should we fear plans to put medical records on a national database? The Independent, December 19, 2006 After further pressure, it was decided that patients would be contacted before records were uploaded to provide them with the opportunity to opt out. Unless the patient does explicitly opt-out within the specified period after being notified (12 weeks as of April 2010), their details will be uploaded. Once entered and viewed, records cannot be fully deleted. A number of pilot schemes followed, in the primary care trust areas of Bolton, Bury, South Birmingham, Dorset, South West Essex, and Bradford & Airedale. In response to a freedom of information request, the Department of Health revealed that, as at 24 April 2009, 258,488 patients' clinical records had been updated to form Summary Care Records.

On 16 April 2010 the Department of Health suspended the implementation of Summary Care Records in the areas leading the roll-out, following calls to do so by the British Medical Association.SCR roll-out suspended E-Health Insider, April 16, 2010 The BMA believed that implementation was moving forward too rapidly, that patients did not have enough information, and that it was too hard for them to opt out.BMA says SCR roll-out ‚Äòtoo hasty‚Äô E-Health Insider, March 1, 2010 A week later it was reported that several primary care trusts and the NHS East of England Strategic Health Authority were seeking a dispensation to continue with their implementation.PCTs push on with SCR despite DH stop E-Health Insider, April 22, 2010 In August 2015 it was announced that retail pharmacies would be given access to NHS patients Summary Care Records after a pilot of 140 pharmacies in Somerset, Northampton, North Derbyshire, Sheffield and West Yorkshire, demonstrated ‚Äúsignificant benefits.‚Äù Pharmacists have to ask for a patient‚Äôs permission to view their record, and are required to complete the relevant Centre for Pharmacy Postgraduate Education e-learning package. In 2018 information on long-term health conditions, medical history and immunisations was available, and according to NHS Digital, this reduced the burden on the health service during winter. Patient awareness A concern that has been raised is that surveys have shown that most patients know nothing of the SCR scheme even if they have received leaflets, so that when people receive a package on the SCR it goes straight in the bin as junk mail. Criticism In March 2010 the British Medical Association asked the British Government to suspend the roll-out of the database as it was an \\"imperfect system\\" being rushed into service prematurely, amid accusations that the system is insecure and that data has been uploaded without giving patients the opportunity to opt out. The system has also been criticized for its inability to delete a patient record if a patient decides to withdraw from the system once their record has been created AND viewed. This has been stated to be due to the cost of completely deleting all information: \\"complete removal would require the hardware holding records to be completely sanitised. This is a process that destroys all data held, for example on a server or hard drive, and not just a particular record\\" and that in any case the record needs to be retained for legal reasons as \\"The issue of audit and the medico-legal evidential significance of the SCR will be extremely important and it would be inappropriate to provide tools that could completely remove a record, even if this were feasible.\\"http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240088940/Health- officials-will-reject-requests-to-delete-e-records-once-uploaded SystmOne and other GP systems provide much more detailed information than the Summary Care Record.

It comprises roughly of forested timberlands, mountain parks, rugged canyons, and stunning rock formations. This area represents the entire spectrum of environments found in the Bighorn National Forest and encompasses prairie land to high alpine peaks. This roadless area is the source of the north, middle, and south forks of Rock Creek, Balm of Gilead Creek, Pheasant Creek, and Ditch Creek. The area is flanked on the eastern side by the Bud Love Big Game Winter Range and the HF Bar Ranch Historic District. On the southern side the roadless area is surrounded by the Paradise Guest Ranch. The roadless area is home to elk, moose, mountain lion, pine marten, blue grouse, ruffed grouse, and raptors. The Rock Creek area is the largest area of quality elk security habitat outside of the Cloud Peak Wilderness Area and would provide an important corridor from the high country to the Bud Love Habitat Management Unit.Trout Unlimited, Where the Wild Lands Are: Wyoming, http://www.tu.org/atf/cf/%7BED0023C4-EA23-4396-9371-8509DC5B4953%7D/+Roadless_WYO_f.pdf The Rock Creek roadless area is dominated by lodgepole pine, some ponderosa, and aspen stands with low-growing juniper in the undergrowth. The area has not been opened to roads due to the ruggedness of the landscape and the high costs of implementation. In the 1990s three holes were drilled and abandoned north, south, and east of Rock Creek to assess the area for oil and gas production. The area has a very low potential for natural resource and mineral exploitation. Roadless Area definition A roadless area is the designation for backcountry, undeveloped lands having wilderness attributes as specified in the Wilderness Act of 1964 and that could be considered for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System. The Rock Creek area was inventoried in the Roadless Area Review and Evaluation process (RARE II) and managed under the land management plans of the US Forest Service. The Roadless Area Conservation Rule was a federal regulation that was adopted by the U.S. Forest Service shortly before President William Clinton left office on Jan. 12, 2001. It allowed reasonable exceptions for management activities like fire suppression and other public health safety measures, and permitted projects, such as grazing and mining, with valid existing rights to proceed.Federal Register, Final Rule, Part VI, PDF document p.11 At the same time, the national roadless rule attempted to conserve fish and wildlife habitat while not closing any existing access to these lands.A Short History of Inventoried Roadless Areas. http://trcp.org/issues/8-roadless/10-roadless-history.html At issue are 58.5 million acres (236,000 km¬≤), located in 42 states, but primarily in the West. Within 24 hours of taking office, President Bush's appointees began their campaign, with the timber industry, to undo this new rule. In May 2005, the Bush administration repealed the Roadless Rule, replacing it with a process that allows governors to petition the Forest Service for protection of the national forest roadless lands within their states, but giving the federal government the power to reject the petitions. The states of California, Oregon, New Mexico, and Washington successfully challenged the Bush roadless rule, resulting in reinstatement of the Clinton rule in 2006, the Roadless Area Conservation Rule was re-established. This rule set national guidelines limiting backcountry timber harvest and road construction and reconstruction with a goal of upholding the roadless characteristics found on millions of acres of inventoried roadless areas. The state of Wyoming and the Colorado Mining Association are currently involved in a lawsuit with the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on the basis that the 2001 federal rule banning construction of new roads on National Forest land violates the law.http://trib.com/news/state-and- regional/article_25b7a657-b2ed-51b3-8f0f-fa371da3984e.html?mode=story Although Rock Creek is protected from development through a roadless designation, roadless status is constantly under review and revocation. During the RARE (Roadless Area Review and Evaluation) II revision the Rock Creek roadless area was reduced from 51,000 acres was to 34,000 acres and illegal ORV roads that continued past the original southern boundary were inventoried and assimilated into the Forest Service Road system. Wilderness Designation The Rock Creek roadless area was the last area to be removed from the 1984 Wyoming Wilderness Act due to its potential for water storage and oil and gas development. Dick Cheney has been quoted saying: > the Wyoming Wilderness Act was one of my proudest achievements as a member > of congress ... We set aside a part of Wyoming, nearly a million acres of > wilderness that ought to be separate and not developed. We think that was > important. http://www.wildwyo.org The USFS recommended the Rock Creek area for wilderness designation in its 2005 Revised Land & Resource Management Plan. If the Rock Creek area is designated wilderness it will be assimilated and added to the Cloud Peak Wilderness Area. Congresswoman Cynthia Lummis toured the area in 2009 and when asked about her position regarding the recommendation for designating the Rock Creek roadless area as wilderness, she stated she would support the decisions of the local Johnson County Commissioners. On March 16, 2010, Albert L. \\"Smokey\\" Wildeman moved to adopt Resolution #399 opposing the proposal for \\"Wilderness Designation\\" in the Rock Creek area. Delbert Eitel seconded, and the motion was carried.http://www.johnsoncountywyoming.org/Commissioners/cc- minutes.html In early September 2010, videographer Melinda Binks and reporter Rebecca Huntington from Assignment Earth http://www.assignmentearth.org documented the Rock Creek Area on horseback. Highlighting outfitter Robert Granstrom of Buffalo Mountain Outfitters and Wyoming Wilderness Association employees advocating for wilderness designation. Late September 2010, 9 volunteers and staff of the Wyoming Wilderness Association traveled to Washington, D.C. to speak with the states congressional officials. Although legislation has yet to come from the visit, the event brought widespread awareness about wilderness across the US through the Campaign for America's Wilderness' Wilderness Week.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHwnlt0zO1A Suppositions Supposition, speculation and misconception is common place in preservation and conservationist movements and can be linked to Environmental disregard or crime. Criticism of wilderness designation is often not based in fact but rather based on generalizations, stereotypes, political ideals, and fear based accusations. Critics of wilderness designation often believe that the land will become off limits to forest users after designation or activities will be limited such as hunting and grazing due to the designation. *Timber Timber harvest is not economically feasible in the Rock Creek Roadless Area due to the lack of roads and infrastructure. Most lodgepole found in the Rock Creek Area is unmarketable due to its small size and cost to harvest. *Hunting Hunting would continue if the Rock Creek Roadless Area was designated wilderness. However out of state Big Game hunters would be required to hire a licensed outfitter or go hunting with a licensed resident hunter when entering Wilderness.http://gf.state.wy.us/ *Grazing Grazing would continue if the Rock Creek Roadless Area was designated wilderness and permitted leases would continue.House report 96-617 on the Colorado Wilderness Act *Fire and Insect Damage The Wilderness Act allows measures to be taken, as necessary, in wilderness areas to control issues such as fire, insects, and diseases.Section 4(d)(1) Wilderness Act A 2010 report by the National Center for Conservation Science and Policy and the Xerces Society has shown that battling forest beetles may be counterproductive.http://nccsp.org/files/Insect%20and%20Roadless%20Forests.pdf and http://www.xerces.org/press-releases/loggingbarkbeetle.html *Oil and Gas Development Test holes that were drilled in the 1990s demonstrated that the Rock Creek Roadless area has a very low development potential. Shortly after the 1984 Wyoming Wilderness Act, Oil and Gas leases in the area expired and since then the area has been removed from the leasing process.http://wogcc.state.wy.us/ *Potential for Water Storage The Rock Creek Roadless Area was removed from the Wyoming Wilderness Act due to its potential for water storage, which would require damming one or several forks of Rock Creek. However, the deeply cut limestone canyons which are found in the Rock Creek Area are not geologically stable for water storage and would not add a significant or economically feasible amount of capacity.Wyoming Water Development Commission water storage report http://library.wrds.uwyo.edu/wwdcrept/Hopkins_Producers_Irrigation_District/Hopkins_Producers_ID- Watershed_Water_Storage_Level_I-Executive_Summary-2008.pdf *Too much wilderness Those in opposition to designating the Rock Creek Roadless Area as wilderness often state that the Bighorn National Forest already has too much wilderness with the Cloud Peak Wilderness Area. In reality, wilderness is only a fraction of the total number of acres on the Bighorn National Forest. Out of the total in the BNF, the Cloud Peak Wilderness is only .Page 5 EIS of the 2005 Forest Plan http://www.fs.fed.us/r2/bighorn/projects/planrevision/ and Wyoming Wilderness Act http://www.wilderness.net/NWPS/documents/PublicLaws/PDF/98-550.pdf If the Rock Creek Roadless Area was designated wilderness then the total percentage of wilderness in the Bighorns would only be 18 percent. *Overuse due to designation Many critics believe that if the Rock Creek Roadless Area is designated wilderness it will see increased pressure from recreational enthusiasts causing adverse damage to sensitive areas from \\"loving them to death.\\" A study presented to the Johnson County Commissioners by the Wyoming Wilderness Association has shown a decrease in use after wilderness designation, with reference to the Rattlesnake National Recreation Area and Wilderness.http://www.buffalobulletin.com/articles/2010/02/17/news/local_news/doc4b7c48df8577a756390733.txt ReferencesExternal links *http://www.wildwyo.org/ *http://gf.state.wy.us/ *http://www.hfbar.com/Site_2/Welcome_to_the_Ranch.html *http://www.paradiseranch.com/ Category:Protected areas of Wyoming Category:Protected areas of Johnson County, Wyoming Category:Bighorn National Forest ","title":"Rock Creek Roadless Area"},{"id":"26591757","text":"Zuzana \\"Suzy\\" Pramukov√° (born 11 September 1981) is a Slovak footballer who has played for the Slovakia national team.

Date sugar can be substituted in many foods and beverages. Production Date sugar is made by first making a paste from raw dates. Then, the paste is mixed with a substance called maltodextrin (a common food additive). This mixture is oven dried and ground into granules. The proportion of maltodextrin to date paste determines the properties of the sugar. There are many recipes for making date sugar at home, but it can also be purchased. There are many methods looking to automate the process of date sugar production. Dates have a few stages of development: khalaal, rutab, and tamr. The best dates to make into date sugar are tamr dates, as they have a very low moisture content (about 30%) and are very sweet.

The calculation of the electric field vectors is based on a rigorous, vectorial model that takes polarization effects in the near-focus region and high numerical aperture microscope objectives into account. The polarization of the input beam (assumed to be collimated and monochromatic) can be chosen freely (linear, circular, or elliptic). Furthermore, a constant or Gaussian shaped input beam intensity profile can be assumed. On its way from the objective to the focus, the illumination light passes through up to three stratified optical layers, which allows the simulation of an immersion oil/air (layer 1) objective that focusses light through a glass cover slip (layer 2) into the sample medium (layer 3). Each layer is characterized by its (constant) refractive index and thickness. PSF Lab can also simulate microscope objectives that are corrected for certain refractive indices and cover slip thicknesses (design parameters). Thus, any deviations from the ideal imaging conditions for which the objective was designed for are properly taken into account. The following optical parameters can be selected:PSF Lab Getting Started Manual * Input beam ** Wavelength ** Gaussian profile filling parameter (0 = constant profile) ** Polarization (linear, circular, elliptic) * Outputs ** Individual field components ** Squared field components ** Intensity * Microscope objective ** Numerical aperture * Optical media ** Refractive index (design and actual) ** Thickness (design and actual) ** Depth (focus position within medium 3) The program calculates only 2D section of the PSF, but several calculations can be stacked (with a third party program) to obtain the full 3D PSF. Calculations are organized in \\"sets\\", each with its own set of parameters. Loops can be set up such that PSF Lab calculates one or several sets, increasing the resolution of the calculated images in each new iteration. The resulting image is displayed in PSF Lab in linear or logarithmic color scale with user-selectable color map, and the intensity, individual field components, or squared field component distributions can be exported into various formats (data formats: .mat, .h5 (HDF5), .txt (ASCII); image formats: .fig, .ai, .bmp, .emf, .eps, .jpg, .pcx, .pdf, .png, .tif).

Construction began in 1767 and it was dedicated by Henry Muhlenberg in 1769. St. Peter's Kierch was used regularly until 1879 when a large church was completed. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.  Design  St. Peter's Kierch is a 2¬Ω-story, Georgian-style church at the intersection of Union and High Streets in Middletown.Pennsylvania Register of Historic Sites and Landmarks, ¬ß 7. The church was constructed from red sandstone. Originally, galleries were located on the east, west and south sides with the wineglass pulpit on the north side. The bell tower was constructed 46 years after the rest of the church, on the west side, as it was not intended to be used an entrance. The sides of the church have three windows reaching to the upper story. Each window has forty- four panes of glass‚Äîeleven panes high, four across.  History  On September 18, 1764, with the intent of constructing a Lutheran church, a plot of land was purchased by some local residents from George Fisher, founder of Middletown, for 7 shillings and 6 pence, along with an annual rent of one grain of wheat.Pennsylvania Register of Historic Sites and Landmarks, ¬ß 8, p. 1. The cornerstone of the church was laid on July 13, 1767 by James Burd. The church was dedicated by Henry Muhlenberg on September 12, 1769. The bell tower was constructed in 1813; the bell was cast in Philadelphia by Hedderly and Leverin and hung in 1815. In 1876, the growth on the congregation led to the decision to build a new church several blocks south of the old one, at Spring and Union Streets. The last regular service was held at the Kierch on January 26, 1879. It is still used, however, for \\"occasional services and funerals\\" as well as other special events. St. Peter's Kierch was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 17, 1973.

H. C. Brown in command. Following her commissioning, the tug was assigned to duty in the 3rd Naval District. On 17 July 1920, she received the alphanumeric designation AT-34. In January 1921, the ship was reassigned to the 5th Naval District, homeported at Norfolk, VA., and carried out towing operations there until 12 September 1921. She sailed from Hampton Roads for the Canal Zone on that day and reached Coco Solo on 28 September. She then began operations between Coco Solo and San Diego, California, carrying out towing duties. In April 1922, the vessel left the Canal Zone and proceeded to the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, where she arrived on 29 March 1922 and began deactivation preparations. The tug was placed out of commission at Mare Island on 3 May 1922. Algorma was recommissioned there on 29 September 1924, Lt. Frank Schultz in command. She was assigned to Fleet Base Force, Train Squadron 2, Battle Fleet, and provided services as a tender to aircraft and towed targets and carried put routine towing duty along the California coast. The highlight of her service during this period was a mission of mercy late in June 1925, when the tug carried emergency supplies to victims of the 1925 Santa Barbara earthquake. Algorma continued her west coast operations through 30 June 1941, when she left San Diego and returned to the east coast. The tug reported to the Atlantic Fleet on 14 July 1941 and briefly operated in the Caribbean before arriving in Norfolk on 13.August. During late August and early September, she acted as a target towing vessel during exercises held off the coast of Maine. Upon completion of this assignment, the ship returned to Norfolk and remained in the Hampton Roads area through June 1942 performing various towing duties. In July 1942, Algorma sailed to the Caribbean and participated in fleet exercises, towing targets for vessels and shore batteries. She also carried out antisubmarine patrols. Among her ports of call were San Juan, Puerto Rico; Charlotte Amalie, United States Virgin Islands; Trinidad; Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and Willemstad, Netherlands Antilles. She returned to Norfolk in December 1943 for overhaul. The tug sailed in a convoy bound for England on 25 January 1944. She arrived at Falmouth, Cornwall on 15 February and assumed duties as a patrol, escort, and towing vessel. The ship participated in the buildup of Allied forces for the invasion of northern France. On 15 May, her designation was changed to ATO-34. Following the invasion of France, Algorma assisted disabled vessels, took part in salvage operations, and carried out regular barge and lighter duty between Great Britain and France. On 23 March 1945, the vessel joined a convoy at Belfast, Northern Ireland, and shaped a course for the east coast of the United States. She touched at New York City, NY, on 13 April. The tug continued down the east coast and entered the Norfolk Navy Yard for overhaul. Upon the completion of the yard period, she sailed, via the Panama Canal, for the west coast and arrived at San Francisco, Calif., on 25 August. Algorma assumed regular towing duties with the Pacific Fleet while based at Treasure Island. This assignment occupied the vessel until she was decommissioned at Treasure Island on 18 June 1946. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 31 July 1946. The ship was transferred to the Maritime Commission on 14 January 1947 for disposal.

This area, near Chester, was one of the earliest areas settled by Quakers in Pennsylvania. The meetinghouse, first built in 1688, then rebuilt after a fire in 1769, reflects this early Quaker heritage. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. History In the year that William Penn first arrived in Pennsylvania, 1682, the Chichester Meeting was first organized as an \\"indulged meeting\\" or subsidiary meeting of the Uplands Monthly Meeting of present-day Chester. The Uplands Meeting had been organized by Robert Wade, who arrived in the area in 1675, from earlier Quaker settlements in New Jersey. Chichester attained the status of Monthly Meeting in March, 1684. Note: This includes This group of Friends met in member's homes until about 1688 when a square meetinghouse was built on two acres. The land was sold on October 4, 1688 by James.chichestermeetinghouse.org Brown for 1 shilling and sixpence \\"only for the use of the people of God, called Quakers.\\" In January 1769 the meetinghouse burned down, and later that year a 33 by building was erected in its place. The doors show bullet holes incurred from British foraging parties after the Battle of Brandywine in September, 1777. In 1793 a school was organized at the meetinghouse and it continued until 1836 when the state mandated public education. About 1827, the time of the Orthodox-Hicksite separation, two meetings were established in the building. The Orthodox branch was \\"laid down\\" or discontinued in 1880. The Hicksite branch was discontinued in 1914. Since then the meetinghouse has only been used for special occasions. No modern conveniences such as heat, plumbing or electricity have been added to the building, so it is considered to be in pristine condition. Text and photographs by HABS It was illegal to build Quaker meetinghouses in England until the Act of Toleration of 1689. Because meetinghouses were built in this area of Pennsylvania at an earlier date, and because the 1769 meetinghouse is believed to reflect the style of the earlier meetinghouse, the Chichester Meetinghouse is believed to show an early \\"English\\" style of Quaker architecture. A caretaker's house was built in 1703 and in 1783 a two-story barn with a six bay shed was built. Both buildings are still in use.

The usual substrates are alkenes. It is sometimes called the Sohio process, acknowledging that ammoxidation was first discovered by Standard Oil of Ohio in 1957. An important application of this process is the production of acrylonitrile:Peter Pollak, G√©rard Romeder, Ferdinand Hagedorn, Heinz-Peter Gelbke \\"Nitriles\\" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. :CH3CH=CH2 \\\\+ 3/2 O2 \\\\+ NH3 ‚Üí NCCH=CH2 \\\\+ 3 H2O Several million tons of acrylonitrile are produced in this way annually. The solvent acetonitrile is a byproduct of this process. Scope Ammoxidation of alkenes exploits the weak C-H bonds that are located in the allylic position of unsaturated hydrocarbons. Benzylic C-H bonds are also susceptible to ammoxidation, reflecting the weakness of their C-H bonds. For this reason, cyanopyridines (e.g. 3-cyanopyridine, the precursor to niacin) and benzonitriles are produced from methylpyridines and toluene, respectively. Dinitriles are produced by double ammoxidation, examples being phthalonitriles (precursor to phthalocyanines) and terephthalonitriles, both from xylenes. Typical catalysts are the oxides of vanadium and molybdenum. œÄ-Allyl complexes are assumed as intermediates.Nugent, W. A.; Mayer, J. M., Metal-Ligand Multiple Bonds. J. Wiley: New York, 1988.

He was employed as legal counsel both for government corporations and labor organizations. His most widely recognized work was undertaken as counsel for the American Federation of Labor in the 1930s. He later became a noted advocate for the Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship, which asserts that Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford was the real author of Shakespeare's works. He published two major books on the topic, co-written with his wife Dorothy. Family Ogburn was the son of yet another Charlton Greenwood Ogburn and Irene Florence Wynn. His brother William Fielding Ogburn (June 29, 1886 ‚Äì April 27, 1959) became an influential sociologist responsible for popularizing the idea of \\"culture lag\\" to describe the difficulties cultures have in adjusting to new technology or other changes. On 8 June 1910, Ogburn married Dorothy Stevens, born 8 June 1890 in Atlanta, daughter of George Webb Stevens and Abbie Dyson Bean.Charlton Ogburn papers, 1898-1994, Emory University Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library In the 1930s Dorothy published mystery novels set in Georgia. Career Ogburn studied law, graduating from Mercer University in 1905 and then attending Harvard Law School in 1906‚Äì1907. He worked in Savannah, Georgia, until 1919, when he moved to New York. A member of the New York Bar from 1921, he worked in corporate law. Ogburn (standing) with members of the Federal Electric Railway Commission After America entered World War I he became an examiner of the National War Labor Board, serving from 1917 to 1919. In 1918, he was tasked to take a leading role in a government investigation of the electric railway industry, becoming the legal counsel and executive secretary of the Federal Electric Railway Commission. In 1920, he wrote an article on the work of the commission and its report in the Electric Railway Journal.Charlton Ogburn \\"The Federal Commission and Its Work\\", Electric Railway Journal, vol 55, January 3, 1920. He also had a number of administrative posts, and published on legal matters. His most notable writings were essays on the relationship between the law and public policy, Government and Labor and The Lawyer and Democracy (1915). Between 1949 and 1952 he served on the Counsel of the American Bar Association's Interprofessional Commission on Marriage and Divorce Laws. In the 1930s he worked for the American Federation of Labor and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. As counsel for the AFL he supported the introduction of laws to defend labor rights, and helped to draft the National Labor Relations Act of 1935.Marian Cecilia McKenna, Franklin Roosevelt and the Great Constitutional War: The Court-packing Crisis of 1937, Fordham Univ Press, 2002, p.274. In 1938 Ogburn supported William Green's attempts to maintain the unity of the AFL and resist the breakaway Committee of Industrial Organizations (COI) union. In what has been described as \\"an incredible display of legal gymnastics\\" he argued that the AFL's Executive Council did have the power to suspend the COI, contrary to the plain wording of the AFL's constitution.Craig Phelan, William Green: Biography of a Labor Leader, SUNY, 1989, p.137. The result was the creation of the independent Congress of Industrial Organizations. Oxfordian activity Ogburn was drawn into the Shakespeare authorship question when leading Oxfordian Charles Wisner Barrell approached him for assistance in a lawsuit against Folger Shakespeare Library director Giles Dawson for libel in response to comments made after Barrell published in Scientific American an article claiming that the Ashbourne portrait of \\"Shakespeare\\" was an overpainted original of Edward de Vere. The case was eventually settled out of court.William L.Pressly, A Catalogue of Paintings in the Folger Shakespeare Library, Yale University Press, 1993, p.62, n 20 After representing Barrell in the case against Dawson, Ogburn and his wife Dorothy both became very involved in the organizations devoted to Oxfordian theory and the Shakespearean authorship question. They subsequently published two books on the subject together, The Renaissance Man of England (1947) and This Star of England (New York, Howard McCann, 1952), both of which argued in favor of Oxford's authorship. The books also advocate the Prince Tudor theory, the belief that Oxford had a son with Queen Elizabeth I. The Ogburns argued that the child grew up as Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton. Charlton and Dorothy's son, also named Charlton Ogburn (sometimes distinguished as \\"Jr.\\"), after serving as the communications officer for Merrill's Marauders, became a noted State Department analyst and non-fiction writer. He continued his parents' interest in Oxfordianism and wrote several more books on the subject. He co-wrote a book with his mother, Shakespeare: The Man Behind the Name (1962). However, he later distanced himself from his parents' advocacy of Prince Tudor theory.

Then she and Spike hide outside suspecting they will try to move her. When they do, Spike intercepts her and they take her to Spike‚Äôs place. The girl decides to return to the commune, but a short time later she reports that she was forced to have sex with strange men. It turns out that the cult leader was running short of money, so he began holding fund raisers. At these fundraisers, older men would attend, donate money, and in turn be given sex with the young female members of the cult. Sunny presents this information to Jesse, who confronts the cult leader with the information they have. The cult leader agrees to leave town. The novel also relates the growing relationship between Jesse and Sunny. With Jenn and Richie out of the picture, Jesse and Sunny are free to pursue their relationship with each other. During his therapy sessions with Dix, Jesse discovers that it was his impression of Galen‚Äôs control over his already submissive wife that made him so envious of their relationship. This leads him to realize that it was his need to control Jenn that drove her away. Meanwhile, Sunny, with the help of her therapist, Dr. Silverman (the longtime love interest of another Parker character, Spenser), discovers that it was her fear of being controlled by her husband that she saw as so perfect, that drove her from him. This is largely due to her fear of becoming her mother who was controlled by her perfect father. Jesse‚Äôs flaws, particularly his struggle with alcohol, are what draw Sunny to him. She doesn‚Äôt want someone perfect like she perceived Richie and her father to be. With their newfound realizations, Jesse and Sunny decide to take their relationship to a more serious level. The novel ends with the two confessing that they are falling in love with each other. References Category:Jesse Stone (novel series) Category:Novels by Robert B.

He was a German refugee, one of the Forty-Eighters. Biography=Early years The son of Ludwig Schneider, a public official, he was educated in the Latin school of his native place. He became a journalist at the age of 21, and worked for several German newspapers. Strongly sympathetic with the revolutionaries of 1848, he took an active part. When the revolution in the Rhine Province was crushed by the Bavarian government's Prussian allies, he withdrew to Baden, then fled to France, and finally emigrated to the United States, arriving in New York City in July 1849. Neue Zeit With his brother, also an exile, he established the Neue Zeit in St. Louis, Missouri, which was devoted to the free discussion of questions of interest to the large German population of that city, including the question of slavery, to which a large majority of them were strongly opposed. During the following year the office of this paper was destroyed by fire. Illinois Staats-Zeitung In the next few months Schneider occupied a position as a professor of foreign languages and literature in a college in the vicinity of St. Louis. During the next year he relinquished this position and, coming to Chicago on August 28, 1851, entered upon his duties as editor of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung which had been established some four years previous. He remained there over ten years, in 1852 becoming the proprietor of a half interest in the paper. It was during his connection with the Staats-Zeitung that the contest over the slavery question was precipitated by the repeal of the Missouri Compromise as a consequence of the adoption of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854. Under Schneider's management the paper took strong ground on this issue. With the exception of the Western Citizen, an avowed anti-slavery weekly journal, the Staats-Zeitung was the first paper in Chicago to array itself in absolute opposition to the Kansas-Nebraska Act. In the latter part of January 1854, while the act was still pending in Congress, Schneider called the first popular meeting held in Chicago to express popular opposition to opening the door for the extension of slavery into territory that had been dedicated to freedom. While the paper and its managers were threatened with mob violence, the preparation made by Schneider and his assistants had the effect of restraining the spirit of mobocracy and protecting the city from the disgrace of lawless violence. The attitude then taken by a large majority of the German population of the region in opposition to the Kansas-Nebraska Act, and their subsequent attitude in loyal support of the Union during the Civil War, was due to a larger extent to the influence and teaching of the Staats-Zeitung. Republican politics It was during this period that the first steps were taken in the organization of the Republican Party in Illinois, and in this movement Schneider became an active and influential figure. At the meeting of the Anti-Nebraska editors, held at Decatur on February 22, 1856, which resulted in crystallizing the elements which had been in course of evolution during the preceding two years, he was present and, as a member of the Committee on Resolutions, bore a conspicuous part in giving shape to the principles of the new party which, in its first regular State Convention held in Bloomington, three months later nominated the ticket headed by William H. Bissell for Governor, which was elected in November following. It was chiefly through Schneider's influence, backed by the approval of Abraham Lincoln, that a resolution was adopted at the Decatur conference favoring tolerance of religious faith and freedom of conscience, as opposed to the principles of the Know Nothing Party. These sentiments were echoed in the platform adopted at Bloomington in May, and still later reiterated by the first Republican National Convention held in Philadelphia on June 17, in both of which Schneider was a delegate. He was a delegate to the Republican national convention of 1860 as well. He took a prominent part in calling the first public meeting held in Chicago in 1861 to sustain the Government in its opposition to the rebellion, then in its incipient stage. His service was recognized by Lincoln in his appointment as consul general at Elsinore, Denmark, where he rendered the country valuable service by imparting to the Danish people an accurate knowledge of the real issue between the federal government and the Confederacy. Returning from Denmark a year later, he sold his half interest in the Staats-Zeitung and accepted an appointment as Collector of Internal Revenue for the Chicago district, which he held for four years. He then became president of the State Savings Institution until 1871, when he became president of the National Bank of Illinois. In 1877, President Hayes nominated him for United States minister to Switzerland, but he declined for personal and business reasons. He was a presidential elector on the Garfield ticket in 1880. Philanthropic efforts He was treasurer of the Chicago South Park Board (1878), director of the Chicago Festival Association (1885) where he played a key role in recruiting talented musicians for Chicago, and director of the Illinois Humane Society (many years). Bank collapse In 1896, the Illinois National Bank was overtaken by disaster, largely through the mismanagement of others. In the last days of December 1896 it was forced to go into liquidation. This resulted in heavy pecuniary loss to Schneider, and wiped out of existence an institution which he had spent more than a quarter of a century in building up. Saddened by this event, the later years of his life were spent in practical retirement, much of it with one of his daughters in Kansas City. He died while seeking recuperation of his health at Colorado Springs, Colorado, and was interred at Rose Hill Cemetery, Chicago, a large number of his countrymen taking part in the honors paid to his memory.

Background Count Theophylact I of Tusculum, his wife Theodora, and daughter Marozia held great sway over the appointment of popes from 904 to 964. The lovers of Theodora and Marozia, as well as the son and grandson of Marozia, rose to the papacy during this period. However, a Count of Tusculum had not yet attempted to appoint himself as pope until 1012. Their rivals, the Crescentii had taken over the papacy from 974 to 1012. According to Cushing, \\"in many ways, increasing respect for papal authority from the mid-tenth century to mid-eleventh centuries can be best viewed through the spectrum of two Roman families: the Crescentians and the Tusculans, whose control of the papacy would have important ramifications for both the control and direction of reform.\\"Cushing, 2005, p. 61. Both the Crescentii and the Counts of Tusculum were descended from Theophylact I, the former papal vestararius. The Crescentii had cooperated with German empress Theophanu and Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor, who resided in Rome from 999 to 1001. The Tusculans did not expropriate church property to increase the already substantial holdings of their family; in fact, they appear to have expended their own resources to increase the power of the papacy. According to Luscombe and Riley-Smith, \\"in contrast to the Crescentians, who had largely relied on the entrenchment of their own dynasty and their supporters in the duchy of Rome as secular magnates and landowners ‚Äì often at the expense of the temporal power of the Roman church ‚Äì the Tusculans used their secular power and successes to shore up the standing of the papacy among the Roman nobility. The position of Patrician, so important to Crescentian rule, remained vacant.\\"Luscombe and Riley-Smith, 2004, p. 10. Abbot Odilo of Cluny flourished during this period, receiving support from Benedict VII and John XIX for monastic immunity. The power of the Tusculan popes derived both from their assertions of papal supremacy and from their ability to balance power between the competing families of Rome.Cushing, 2005, p. 63. The Counts of Tusculum were centered at Tuscolo, above Frascati, protected by an ancient fortress in Borghetto; their principle monasteries were Grottaferrata and Subiaco; they also controlled many churches and religious houses in and around Rome.Partner, 1972, p. 102. History=Benedict VIII Benedict VIII crowns Emperor Henry II, as imagined in the 15th century In 1012, Rome saw a violent political upheaval then ended Crescentii domination and elevated Theophylact, the son of Count Gregory I of Tusculum, as Pope Benedict VIII (1012‚Äì1024).Cushing, 2005, p. 62. Benedict VIII was a layman until his election. However, during his papacy he was a strong proponent of papal supremacy and frequently interfered in ecclesiastical matters on the Italian peninsula outside Rome. Benedict VIII's brother, Romanus, was the city prefect (\\"Senator of all the Romans\\"). His other brother, Alberic, was a Consul and Senator (\\"consul et dux\\"). Alberic was responsible for overseeing courts of justice in the Imperial Palatinate, near Santa Sabina.Gregorovius, 1896, p. 16. Gregory I had been a figure in the court of Emperor Otto III as the \\"naval prefect\\" and Alberic had been the \\"master of the imperial palace\\". Other Roman families still held important offices: the Stefaniani family held the prefecture of Rome and the Ottaviani retained the rectorate of Sabina. Among Benedict VIII's first acts as pope was a military campaign against the strongholds of the Crescentii around Rome. The Crescenzi fortresses in Sabina were demolished.Partner, 1972, p. 103. The Crescentii faction set up a rival to Benedict VIII: Antipope Gregory VI (1012).Milman, 1872, p. 352. John Crescentius still remained the Prefect of Rome, but was soon dispossessed of much of his property.Milman, 1872, p. 353. Benedict VIII was an ally of Emperor Henry II; he called upon the emperor to visit Rome, which he did in late 1013 (spending Christmas in Pavia). A synod convoked by the emperor deposed the archbishop of Ravenna, who was replaced with Arnulf, a half- brother. Benedict VIII and the emperor met in Ravenna, and then proceeded to Rome (with the emperor arriving later).Gregorovius, 1896, p. 17. Benedict VIII confirmed his privileges at Bamberg and crowned him on February 14, 1014 as emperor, in a ceremony in Old Saint Peter's Basilica. These twelve people calling themselves the Senate of Rome had doubtlessly consented to the coronation before it occurred.Gregorovius, 1896, p. 20. Benedict VIII visited Henry II in Bamberg in 1020 (where he celebrated Easter), and the emperor came to Italy the following year.Milman, 1872, p. 354. In Bamberg, Henry issued the Henricianum, which repeated the Diploma Ottonianum, which itself had repeated donations of land which date back to the Frankish Papacy. The Henricianum, as much as the forged \\"Donation of Constantine\\", played a central role in papal territorial and sovereignty claims in the coming centuries. Just as Henry II was promising the pope this territory, the pope was being deprived of nearly all of his temporal power by the armies of John Patricius, and competing hereditary counts had \\"sprung up on both sides of the Tiber\\".Gregorovius, 1896, p. 18. While the Tusculans remained strong in the Latin mountains, the Counts of Segni controlled Campagna, the Crescentii held Sabina, the Counts of Galeria controlled Tuscany, and Thrasmundus, Berardus, and Oderisius retained the Marsian territory as far as Subiaco.Gregorovius ,1896, p. 19. According to Gregorovius, \\"of the dominions founded for them by the Carolingians the popes possessed little beyond the yellowed deeds of gift in their archives\\". In 1016, a Pisan and Genoese fleet defeated the Arabs, in a victory which Benedict VIII may have something to do with; he also possibly schemed with the Normans against the Byzantines in southern Italy. Benedict VIII himself led an allied force against Mussetus, who escaped after the battle of Luni.Gregorovius, 1896, p. 25. However, in 1018, Melo, the leader of the rebellion against the Greeks was defeated. The Germans honored the Henricianum in 1022 by sending their own army to southern Italy.Partner, 1972, p. 104. In 1022, Benedict VIII held with Henry II a council in Ravenna which issued stringent prohibitions against clerical concubinage. John XIX Benedict VIII's brother Romanus succeeded him as Pope John XIX (1024‚Äì1032). John XIX did not resign his secular titles (\\"senatorial dignity\\") upon his election as pope; documents would refer to him not as \\"Senator\\" but as \\"Count Palatine and Consul\\".Gregorovius, 1896, pp. 31-32. According to Cushing, John XIX was \\"somewhat less adept\\" than his brother in cooperating with Henry II's successor, Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor but was \\"by no means a puppet\\". John XIX was open to rapprochement with Byzantine emperor Basil II and was willing to declare the patriarch of Constantinople an ecumenical bishop; the Italian bishops and congregation of Cluny, however, opposed such moves.Gregorovius, 1896, p. 32. Benedict IX Pope Benedict IX (1032‚Äì1044, 1045, 1047‚Äì1048) was the nephew of Benedict VIII and John XIX. Norwood Young calls Benedict IX the \\"Nero of the Tusculan Papacy. Absolute power appears to paralyse the brain if applied at an early age.\\"Young, 1901, p. 180. According to Cushing, \\"the report of [his] crimes and deviance became ever more squalid as the latter reformers grew in power\\" but was for the first 12 years of his papacy \\"adequate and credible, if not perhaps immensely pious\\". Another interpretation of his first twelve years is provided by successor Victor III: By Autumn 1044, the position of Benedict IX was \\"seriously threatened\\" by the creation of Pope Silvester III (1045). In May 1045, Benedict IX resigned the papacy in favor of John Gratian, who became Pope Gregory VI (1045‚Äì1046). Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor met Gregory VI in 1046 and received him favorably. By December, however, Henry III had changed his mind and ordered Benedict IX, Silvester III, and Gregory VI to appear before him in a synod in Sutri. Gregory VI was the only one to show up, and he was declared guilty of simony and deposed on December 20. Silvester III had long since given up being pope and returned to acting as Bishop of Sabina but he too was deprived of his orders and forced to retire to a monastery. Three days later, in Rome, Benedict IX was excommunicated for simony and Henry III's candidate, Bishop Suidger of Bamberg, was installed as Pope Clement II (1046‚Äì1047). File:Heinrich III.

More precisely, it is a software module for extracting background information from moving images. It has been developed by Oliver Barnich and Marc Van Droogenbroeck of the Montefiore Institute, University of Li√®ge, Belgium.http://www.telecom.ulg.ac.be/research/vibe/ ViBe is patented:World Intellectual Property Organization. ViBe patents the patent covers various aspects such as stochastic replacement, spatial diffusion, and non- chronological handling. ViBe is written in the programming language C, and has been implemented on CPU, GPU and FPGA.Kryjak, Tomasz; Gorgon, Marek. \\"Real- time Implementation of the ViBe Foreground Object Segmentation Algorithm\\". In Proceedings of the 2013 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS) pp. 591‚Äì596  Technical description = Pixel model and classification process  Many advanced techniques are used to provide an estimate of the temporal probability density function (pdf) of a pixel x. ViBe's approach is different, as it imposes the influence of a value in the polychromatic space to be limited to the local neighborhood. In practice, ViBe does not estimate the pdf, but uses a set of previously observed sample values as a pixel model. To classify a value pt(x), it is compared to its closest values among the set of samples.  Model update: Sample values lifespan policy  ViBe ensures a smooth exponentially decaying lifespan for the sample values that constitute the pixel models. This makes ViBe able to successfully deal with concomitant events with a single model of a reasonable size for each pixel. This is achieved by choosing, randomly, which sample to replace when updating a pixel model. Once the sample to be discarded has been chosen, the new value replaces the discarded sample. The pixel model that would result from the update of a given pixel model with a given pixel sample cannot be predicted since the value to be discarded is chosen at random.  Model update: Spatial Consistency  To ensure the spatial consistency of the whole image model and handle practical situations such as small camera movements or slowly evolving background objects, ViBe uses a technique similar to that developed for the updating process in which it chooses at random and update a pixel model in the neighborhood of the current pixel. By denoting NG(x) and p(x) respectively the spatial neighborhood of a pixel x and its value, and assuming that it was decided to update the set of samples of x by inserting p(x), then ViBe also use this value p(x) to update the set of samples of one of the pixels in the neighborhood NG(x), chosen at random. As a result, ViBe is able to produce spatially coherent results directly without the use of any post-processing method.  Model initialization  Although the model could easily recover from any type of initialization, for example by choosing a set of random values, it is convenient to get an accurate background estimate as soon as possible. Ideally a segmentation algorithm would like to be able to segment the video sequences starting from the second frame, the first frame being used to initialize the model. Since no temporal information is available prior to the second frame, ViBe populates the pixel models with values found in the spatial neighborhood of each pixel; more precisely, it initializes the background model with values taken randomly in each pixel neighborhood of the first frame. The background estimate is therefore valid starting from the second frame of a video sequence.

They are pioneers in the field of digital imaging and post-photography with projects exhibited at numerous venues including the 1995 Venice Biennale, the LA County Museum of Art and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Biography Anthony Aziz received his BA from Boston College in 1983 and then went on to earn his MFA from the San Francisco Art Institute in 1990. Sammy Cucher received his BFA from Tisch School of the Arts at New York University in 1983 and then earned his MFA from SFAI in 1992. They live and work together in Brooklyn, NY and are both members of the faculty at Parsons The New School for Design. Work Aziz + Cucher have worked in many media including digital photography, video installation, sculpture, and textiles. They were among the first to use Adobe Photoshop in the context of fine art photography. The resulting series of images (1992‚Äì2002) can be seen as a commentary and reflection on the relationship between the human body and the technological forces that shape our society. In later projects (2003‚Äì2006), which grew to include video installation, their concerns shifted towards the way that our perception of nature and the landscape had been augmented and modified by technological mediation. Significant examples=The Dystopia series (1994-95) Consists of large digitally manipulated portraits in which the orifices‚Äîeyes, mouth and nostrils‚Äîhave been covered by a layer of skin. The intention was to suggest an evolutionary change signifying the loss of individuality in the face of advancing technology and the progressive disappearance of face-to-face, direct interaction. Interior series (1999‚Äì2002) These are monumental images of architectural spaces seemingly constructed out of human skin. Created originally to metaphorically reflect the rapid proliferation of technological communications, these images have a haunting, lyrical quality which embodies the dichotomy between interior and exterior that will come to characterize their work subsequently. Synaptic Bliss series (2003-07) The central piece in this series is a 4-channel video installation commissioned by the Festival Villette Numerique in Paris in 2004. The series is characterized by a shift in visual language from the human body to representing a landscape in which diverse forms are superimposed, becoming intertwined, and slowly emerging from an intensive colored flurry. Each individual shape seems in constant flux, becoming distinguished by a shift in tone, orientation, or size of its colored texture. The work in this series explores ideas of a digital consciousness that allows for the simultaneous perception of multiple perspectives and scales, as well as for the blurring of the distinctions between the body and its environment.

His father moved to Bulgaria after the war of liberation in 1879, and Georgi joined him three years later. He graduated from military school in Sofia, and was an officer in an artillery regiment for a short time, but did not care for this career and instead began to study law at Sofia University. For most of his life he worked as a judge. Although his first published work was a poem (1890), he did not consider himself a poet and for the most part wrote pessimistic and ironic short stories set in provincial cities. His first story was published in the journal Thought in 1893, and much of his work is scattered among periodicals, with small book-size compilations appearing in 1905, 1915, and 1929.

COROT-9b's distance of nearest approach to its parent star of approximately 0.36 AU was the largest of all known transiting planets at the time of its discovery, with an orbital period of 95 days. The transit of this planet lasts 8 hours. The planet is at a distance from its star where there is a strong increase in albedo as the temperature decreases, because of the condensation of reflective water clouds in the atmosphere. This suggests its atmosphere may be locked into one of two states: a cloudless state with temperatures between and , or covered in water clouds with a temperature in the range to .  Discovery  COROT-9b was discovered by combining observations from the CoRoT satellite, which looks for a small dip in starlight as a planet passes in front of its parent star, and radial velocity measurements from the European Southern Observatory's High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) instrument on the 3.6 m Telescope. Its presence was confirmed by observations from several telescopes from the ESO.New exoplanet like 'one of ours' (BBC, March 17, 2010) This discovery was announced in 2010 on St. Patrick's Day, after 145 days of continuous observations in summer 2008.

File:Animation of the transiting exoplanet Corot-9b.ogvAnimation of an artist's impression.  Mass and size  COROT-9b has a mass of 0.84 times that of Jupiter (MJ) as determined from HARPS spectroscopy, and has a radius of 1.05 times that of Jupiter (RJ) as determined from photometry of the transit light curve. This implies that this planet has a density of 96% that of water, and surface gravity 1.93 times that of Earth. A search for rings and satellites around this planet with the Spitzer space telescope was negative.  Atmosphere and interior  Since COROT-9b is the first temperate giant exoplanet found by the transit method, astronomers will be able to study the atmosphere of a temperate giant planet for the first time, examining the composition of clouds, the composition of the atmosphere, temperature distributions, and even some details of the interior of the planet. The atmosphere of this planet is presumably dominated by hydrogen and helium (like Jupiter and Saturn), with up to 20 Earth masses of other elements including water, as well as rock at high temperatures and pressures. The authors of the COROT-9b discovery paper refer to the planet as a class II (\\"water cloud\\") or class III (\\"clear\\") atmosphere planet, as described by the Sudarsky extrasolar planet classification.

In professional learning contexts, individuals may \\"test out\\" of some training to ensure they engage with novel instruction. Computers adapt the presentation of educational material according to students' learning needs, as indicated by their responses to questions, tasks and experiences. The technology encompasses aspects derived from various fields of study including computer science, AI, psychometrics, education, psychology, and brain science. Adaptive learning has been partially driven by a realization that tailored learning cannot be achieved on a large-scale using traditional, non-adaptive approaches. Adaptive learning systems endeavor to transform the learner from passive receptor of information to collaborator in the educational process. Adaptive learning systems' primary application is in education, but another popular application is business training. They have been designed as desktop computer applications, web applications, and are now being introduced into overall curricula. History Adaptive learning or intelligent tutoring has its origins in the artificial-intelligence movement and began gaining popularity in the 1970s. At that time, it was commonly accepted that computers would eventually achieve the human ability of adaptivity. In adaptive learning, the basic premise is that the tool or system will be able to adjust to the student/user's learning method, which results in a better and more effective learning experience for the user. Back in the 70's the main barrier was the cost and size of the computers, rendering the widespread application impractical. Another hurdle in the adoption of early intelligent systems was that the user interfaces were not conducive to the learning process. The start of the work on adaptive and intelligent learning systems is usually traced back to the SCHOLAR system that offered adaptive learning for the topic of geography of South America. A number of other innovative systems appeared within five years. A good account of the early work on adaptive learning and intelligent tutoring systems can be found in the classic book \\"Intelligent Tutoring Systems\\". Technology and methodology Adaptive learning systems have traditionally been divided into separate components or 'models'. While different model groups have been presented, most systems include some or all of the following models (occasionally with different names):Charles P. Bloom, R. Bowen Loftin Facilitating the Development and Use of Interactive Learning Environments, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates (1998). * Expert model ‚Äì The model with the information which is to be taught * Student model ‚Äì The model which tracks and learns about the student * Instructional model ‚Äì The model which actually conveys the information * Instructional environment ‚Äì The user interface for interacting with the system Expert model The expert model stores information about the material which is being taught. This can be as simple as the solutions for the question set but it can also include lessons and tutorials and, in more sophisticated systems, even expert methodologies to illustrate approaches to the questions. Adaptive learning systems which do not include an expert model will typically incorporate these functions in the instructional model. Student model The simplest means of determining a student's skill level is the method employed in CAT (computerized adaptive testing). In CAT, the subject is presented with questions that are selected based on their level of difficulty in relation to the presumed skill level of the subject. As the test proceeds, the computer adjusts the subject's score based on their answers, continuously fine-tuning the score by selecting questions from a narrower range of difficulty. An algorithm for a CAT-style assessment is simple to implement. A large pool of questions is amassed and rated according to difficulty, through expert analysis, experimentation, or a combination of the two. The computer then performs what is essentially a binary search, always giving the subject a question which is halfway between what the computer has already determined to be the subject's maximum and minimum possible skill levels. These levels are then adjusted to the level of the difficulty of the question, reassigning the minimum if the subject answered correctly, and the maximum if the subject answered incorrectly. Obviously, a certain margin for error has to be built in to allow for scenarios where the subject's answer is not indicative of their true skill level but simply coincidental. Asking multiple questions from one level of difficulty greatly reduces the probability of a misleading answer, and allowing the range to grow beyond the assumed skill level can compensate for possible misevaluations. A further extension of identifying weaknesses in terms of concepts is to program the student model to analyze incorrect answers. This is especially applicable for multiple choice questions. Consider the following example: :Q. Simplify: 2x^2 + x^3 :a) Can't be simplified :b) 3x^5 :c) ... :d) ... Clearly, a student who answers (b) is adding the exponents and failing to grasp the concept of like terms. In this case, the incorrect answer provides additional insight beyond the simple fact that it is incorrect. Instructional model The instructional model generally looks to incorporate the best educational tools that technology has to offer (such as multimedia presentations) with expert teacher advice for presentation methods. The level of sophistication of the instructional model depends greatly on the level of sophistication of the student model. In a CAT-style student model, the instructional model will simply rank lessons in correspondence with the ranks for the question pool. When the student's level has been satisfactorily determined, the instructional model provides the appropriate lesson. The more advanced student models which assess based on concepts need an instructional model which organizes its lessons by concept as well. The instructional model can be designed to analyze the collection of weaknesses and tailor a lesson plan accordingly. When the incorrect answers are being evaluated by the student model, some systems look to provide feedback to the actual questions in the form of 'hints'. As the student makes mistakes, useful suggestions pop up such as \\"look carefully at the sign of the number\\". This too can fall in the domain of the instructional model, with generic concept-based hints being offered based on concept weaknesses, or the hints can be question-specific in which case the student, instructional, and expert models all overlap. Implementations=Learning management system Many learning management systems have incorporated various adaptive learning features. A learning management system (LMS) is a software application for the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting and delivery of educational courses, training programs, or learning and development programs. Distance learning Adaptive learning systems can be implemented on the Internet for use in distance learning and group collaboration. The field of distance learning is now incorporating aspects of adaptive learning. Initial systems without adaptive learning were able to provide automated feedback to students who are presented questions from a preselected question bank. That approach however lacks the guidance which teachers in the classroom can provide. Current trends in distance learning call for the use of adaptive learning to implement intelligent dynamic behavior in the learning environment. During the time a student spends learning a new concept they are tested on their abilities and databases track their progress using one of the models. The latest generation of distance learning systems take into account the students' answers and adapt themselves to the student's cognitive abilities using a concept called 'cognitive scaffolding'. Cognitive scaffolding is the ability of an automated learning system to create a cognitive path of assessment from lowest to highest based on the demonstrated cognitive abilities. A current successful implementation of adaptive learning in web-based distance learning is the Maple engine of WebLearn by RMIT university. WebLearn is advanced enough that it can provide assessment of questions posed to students even if those questions have no unique answer like those in the Mathematics field. Adaptive learning can be incorporated to facilitate group collaboration within distance learning environments like forums or resource sharing services. Some examples of how adaptive learning can help with collaboration include automated grouping of users with the same interests, and personalization of links to information sources based on the user's stated interests or the user's surfing habits. Educational game design In 2014, an educational researcher concluded a multi-year study of adaptive learning for educational game design. The research developed and validated the ALGAE (Adaptive Learning GAme dEsign) model, a comprehensive adaptive learning model based on game design theories and practices, instructional strategies, and adaptive models. The research extended previous researching in game design, instructional strategies, and adaptive learning, combining those three components into a single complex model. The study resulted in the development of an adaptive educational game design model to serve as a guide for game designers, instructional designers, and educators with the goal of increasing learning outcomes. Survey participants validated the value of the ALGAE model and provided specific insights on the model's construction, use, benefits, and challenges. The current ALGAE model is based on these insights. The model now serves as a guideline for the design and development of educational computer games. The model's applicability is assessed as being cross-industry including government and military agencies/units, game industry, and academia. The model's actual value and the appropriate implementation approach (focused or unfocused) will be fully realized as the ALGAE model's adoption becomes more widespread. Development tools While adaptive learning features are often mentioned in the marketing materials of tools, the range of adaptivity can be dramatically different. Entry-level tools tend to focus on determining the learner's pathway based on simplistic criteria such as the learner's answer to a multiple choice question. A correct answer may take the learner to Path A, whereas an incorrect answer may take them to Path B. While these tools provide an adequate method for basic branching, they are often based on an underlying linear model whereby the learner is simply being redirected to a point somewhere along a predefined line. Due to this, their capabilities fall short of true adaptivity. At the other end of the spectrum, there are advanced tools which enable the creation of very complex adaptions based on any number of complex conditions. These conditions may relate to what the learner is currently doing, prior decisions, behavioral tracking, interactive and external activities to name a few. These higher end tools generally have no underlying navigation as they tend to utilize AI methods such as an inference engine. Due to the fundamental design difference advanced tools are able to provide rich assessment capabilities. Rather than taking a simple multiple choice question, the learner may be presented with a complex simulation where a number of factors are considered to determine how the learner should adapt.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 11, 2010. In this episode, Mr. Burns is arrested for possessing stolen art and Smithers is chosen to run the nuclear plant‚Äîonly to turn into a misanthropic slave driver when his subordinates begin taking advantage of his kindness. The episode was written by Michael Price and directed by Bob Anderson. The episode features references to Stephen King's The Green Mile and The Shawshank Redemption. \\"American History X-cellent\\" has received positive reviews from critics and received a 2.7 Nielsen Rating in the 18-49 demographic. Plot Mr. Burns throws an elaborate Fourth of July party for himself, forcing his employees to wait on him and perform a Broadway-style musical number without pay. When Homer, Lenny and Carl become frustrated, they break into Burns' wine cellar and become completely drunk. Burns discovers this and calls the police, but the police soon notice that Burns' mansion contains stolen artwork including The Concert by Vermeer. He is arrested and paraded through the streets of Springfield inside a bamboo cage, where he is jeered by the townspeople on his way to prison. He leaves a reluctant Waylon Smithers in charge. In prison, Burns is placed in a cell with another white-collar criminal, but then demands to be moved when he discovers his cellmate was educated at Dartmouth College and the University of Virginia. Burns soon finds himself in the company of a tough-looking felon (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson), a born-again Christian who convinces Burns to find religion. The man became a born-again Christian when an inmate gave the man the book Helter Skelter with its subject Charles Manson on the cover; since the man was illiterate he misidentified the picture as Christ. He then \\"sucks\\" the evil, represented by green slime, out of Burns. The prison, first seen by Burns as a hell hole, now becomes a heaven hole: he joins the prison choir and a Beatles tribute band called \\"Stab Four\\" and reads the Holy Bible many times in the prison laundry while Sideshow Bob is being washed. Meanwhile, Smithers assumes management at the nuclear plant and attempts to show the plant employees that he is nothing like Burns by being kind and accommodating. But when he joins Homer, Lenny and Carl for beer at Moe's, he overhears the three friends making fun of him. Smithers realizes why Burns scorns humanity and his behavior quickly deteriorates into that of a tyrant, to the point of releasing wolverines instead of Burns' hounds. Homer, Lenny and Carl decide to break Burns out of prison by disguising themselves as prison guards to sneak into the institution and remove Burns from his cell. Burns, however, does not want to leave because he believes he has found his spiritual home. When the cellmate tries to stop them from escaping, Burns realizes that he misses being a power figure and that his toilet-tank baptism did not purge away all of his inner evil, stating that he forgot to suck some evil from between his toes, which had then multiplied rapidly and made him \\"a bigger bastard than ever\\". But Burns also wonders genuinely why his cellmate helped him; he is told that after killing so many rich white men over the years, he figured he would do right by at least one of them. The two men decide they are not so different and part company. Burns uses his money to leave the prison system, and is once again at the helm of the nuclear power plant, although he hopes his friend will gain another disciple. Burns' former cellmate finds a new disciple in Fat Tony. Meanwhile, Bart and Lisa are forced to play with one another when Marge goes shopping (she notes that the mall is deserted when the townspeople are rioting, as is the case with Burns' trip to prison). When the two fight over Lisa's ant farm, it breaks and Santa's Little Helper eats all but one of the ants. The experience brings Lisa and Bart closer together, and they name the ant Annie (as in Little Orphan Annie, as well as the layman's term ant itself). They care for her as they would a child, but realize that she is near death. They decide to release her, so she can live out her last days in the wild, but as soon as they let her go Santa's Little Helper eats Annie. Production Joe Mantegna guest starred in the episode as recurring character, Fat Tony. The episode was written by Michael Price and directed by Bob Anderson, his second credit of the season after \\"Rednecks and Broomsticks\\". The episode also features the second appearance of Kevin Michael Richardson who first appeared in \\"Homer the Whopper\\" and Joe Mantegna as Fat Tony. Sideshow Bob makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in this episode in where he is put in a dryer. Cultural references The Mr. Burns plot is based on Stephen King's novel The Green Mile, with the inmate being based on the character John Coffey. The episode also parodies elements from The Shawshank Redemption, by the same author, including the prison and the warden. Another reference to Shawshank Redemption is that the felon tears a Rita Hayworth poster off the wall, uncovering a cross. The title is based on the film American History X. The picture in Mr. Burns' office is based on Saturn Devouring His Son by Francisco Goya. Burns' induction to the prison is accompanied by \\"Prison Bound Blues\\" performed by John Lee Hooker. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"American History X-cellent\\" was viewed by 5.649 million viewers and a 2.7 rating and 8 share in the 18-49 demographic tying with the previous week's episode. The episode ranked 20 in the 18-49 weekly Nielsen Rating. The episode received positive reviews. TVFanatic.com gave the episode a 3.5/5 saying \\"Overall, the main story line was great.

In case of XML based documents, the corresponding XML schema document contains the structure of the XML document. transformation when services exchange messages that reference the same data model.Mauro. et al. Service Oriented Device Integration - An Analysis of SOA Design Patterns. [Online], pp.1-10, 2010 43rd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2010. Date accessed: 30 April 2010. Rationale The interaction between services often requires exchanging business documents. In order for a service consumer to send data (related to a particular business entity e.g. a purchase order), it needs to know the structure of the data i.e. the data model. For this, the service provider publishes the structure of the data that it expects within the incoming message from the service consumer. In case of services being implemented as web services,Service can be implemented using any technology as long as it conforms to the service-orientation guidelines. this would be the XML schema document. Once the service consumer knows the required data model, it can structure the data accordingly. However, under some conditions it may be possible that the service consumer already possesses the required data, which relates to a particular business document, but the data does not conform to the data model as specified by the service provider. This disparity among the data models results in the requirement of data model transformation so that the message is transformed into the required structure as dictated by the service provider. Building upon the aforementioned example, it is entirely possible that, after processing the received business document, the service provider sends back the processed document to the service consumer that once again performs the data model transformation to convert the processed business document back to the data model that it uses within its logic to represent the business document. This runtime data model transformation adds processing overhead and complicates the design of service compositions. In order to avoid the need for data model transformation, the Canonical Schema pattern dictates the use of standardized data models for those business documents that are commonly processed by the services in a service inventory.Thomas Erl, Herbj√∂rn Wilhelmsen.Canonical Schema Design Pattern[Online]. Date accessed: April 8, 2010. Usage Diagram A Service A is using a different data model as compared to Service B for the same business document. When messages are exchanged, runtime data model transformation needs to be performed. Diagram B Both services are using the same data model for representing a particular business document. As a result, no data model transformation is required when messages are exchanged. This design pattern is fully supported by the application of the Standardized Service Contract design principle. The Standardized Service Contract design principle advocates that the service contracts be based on standardized data models. This is achieved by performing an analysis of the service inventory blueprint in order to find out the commonly occurring business documents that are exchanged between services. These business documents are then modeled in a standardized manner. For example, in case of web services, the business documents are modeled as XML schemas. Once a standardized data representation layer exists in a service inventory, different service contracts can make use of the same data models if they need to exchange the same business documents. This eliminates the need for any data model transformation and reduces the processing overhead associated with the data model transformation. It also increases the reusability potential of a service as now the service can be consumed without requiring any custom data model transformation logic. In a way, the application of the Canonical Schema pattern reduces the need for the application of the Data Model Transformation design pattern. Considerations The application of this design pattern requires design standards in place that make the use of standardized data models mandatory, as the mere creation of data models does not guarantee their use. Although simple in principle but difficult to enforce as it needs commitment from different project teams which may entail extra efforts, on part of each team, in terms of designing solutions that accommodate standardized data models. On some occasions, either because of the sheer size of the organization or because of the resistance from different segments of the enterprise, the Canonical Schema design pattern may need to be applied within a particular domain inventory, created by the application of the Domain Inventory design pattern. The schemas need to be designed separately than the service contract design so that there is no dependency between them.Eben Hewitt.Java SOA Cookbook[Online].pp 50.Date accessed: 25 April 2010.

(often abbreviated NCDMV!; in Welsh ') was a registered political party of the United Kingdom. The party's core policies were to bring about electoral reform by putting a none of the above option onto every ballot paper of the future. That way the disaffected voter could use their vote to say that none of the parties currently represents them. At the 7 June 2001 County Council elections in Hertfordshire, the party stood its first candidates, its best result being 2.5% of the vote (174 votes) in St Albans South. The party took the view that offering the opportunity of positive abstention could assist in increasing voter turnout. The results of the MORI survey conducted for the commission after the election offers some support for this suggestion: 12% of those asked said that being able to vote for None of the above candidates would have made them more likely to vote, and the figure increases markedly to 33% for non-voters. However the evidence from international practice in this regard is inconclusive. The Commission does not believe that the case is yet made for the introduction of positive abstention within the UK electoral practice, but intends to undertake a more thorough examination of the issues involved. The party planned to field as many candidates as they could in the 2010 General Election. Stephen Phillips (a.k.a. Steve of Stevenage) planned to stand in the Stevenage Constituency, and Eric Mutch of Staple Hill, South Gloucestershire changed his name by deed poll to Zero None Of The Above and announced his intention to stand in the constituency of Bristol South; however, he changed his mind and handed in nomination papers for Filton and Bradley Stoke. The party deregistered with the Electoral Commission in 2012. History * November 2000 - The party was founded by Amanda Ringwood (n√©e Gardner) and Bob Goodall. * June 2001 - The party fielded five candidates in the local elections, four in the St Albans South, East, North and Central wards of the Hertfordshire County Council elections, and one in the Sopwell ward of the St Albans District Council elections. * May 2002 - Four candidates stood in the Ashley, Sandridge, Sopwell and Verulam wards of the St Albans Local Council elections and one candidate stood in the Southfields ward of the Ealing Local Council elections. * February 2010 - Stephen Phillips was elected as the party President to act as media spokesman for the party. To date, the highest number of votes gained in one ward is 174 which represented 2.5% of the vote in the St Albans South ward during the Herts County Council elections in June 2001. The highest vote percentage gained is 3.16% in the Sopwell ward during the St Albans Local Council elections in May 2002. Core policies No Candidate Deserves My Vote! has just one core policy: * To add a none of the above option onto the bottom of every ballot paper of the future, giving the disaffected voter a reason to turn out to vote. Any successful candidates will have the choice of standing down to force an automatic by-election or staying on to act as an Independent for all other issues.

The practice spread after these schools were integrated, and persists in a few rural places to the present day. The separate proms have been the subject of frequent (often negative) press coverage, and several films.  History  Prior to the 1954 decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Brown v. Board of Education, most schools in the southern United States were racially segregated.(Reporting on early integration steps after Brown was decided, article quotes an unnamed white student, \\"What we'll do about dances, Will they go to our proms.\\") The process of integration of schools was slow, and many schools did not become integrated until the late 1960s and early 1970s. In order to avoid having to hold an integrated prom, many high schools stopped sponsoring any prom, and private segregated proms were organized as a replacement.(\\"... the 1970s. That is when many Southern schools were belatedly integrated, and the time when a new set of traditions was born. While black and white students now sat side by side in classrooms and on the school bus, the races would still often gather separately when it came time for the biggest dance of the year.\\") Sometimes a concern over interracial dating was cited as the reason for not holding a single prom. (\\"After integration in the early 1970s, school officials stopped sponsoring a prom, in part because of fear of interracial dating.\\") Other schools cited liability concerns as the reason for not sponsoring a prom. (reported on segregated proms at Eufaula High School in Alabama, noting that \\"opponents of segregated proms claim the white-controlled school board uses worries over liquor and liability to dodge the issue of mixed-race dances\\") In addition to segregated proms, some schools have also elected black and white homecoming kings and queens, class officers, and even awarded separate black and white superlatives such as \\"Most Likely To Succeed.\\"(reporting on first integrated prom in Turner County, Georgia, also noting that \\"Aniesha Gipson, who became the county's first solo homecoming queen last fall as it abandoned the practice of crowning separate white and black queens.\\") School sponsored separate events, including separate homecoming queens or superlatives, have been deemed to violate federal law by the United States Department of Justice.(\\"Practices such as holding segregated high school proms or naming separate race-based sets of recipients for senior-year honors 'are inconsistent with federal law and should not be tolerated,' says the joint letter from the civil rights offices of the federal departments of Justice and Education.'

'We have also found that school districts have assisted in facilitating racially separate proms.'\\") In 1990, The New York Times reported that 10 counties in Georgia were still holding segregated proms.

When two separate proms are held for a school, generally the \\"black prom\\" is open to attendance by all students. Only the \\"white prom\\" is racially exclusive. School alumni at schools which held segregated proms sometimes hold segregated class reunions as well.  Outside the Deep South  Even prior to integration in the South, there have been instances of segregated proms being held in integrated schools in the northern United States. In the late 1920s, for example, separate proms for blacks and whites are recorded as occurring at Froebel High School in Gary, Indiana.  Notable cases  * Charleston, Mississippi: In 1997, actor Morgan Freeman offered to fund a racially integrated prom in Charleston, Mississippi, where he lives. The offer was turned down. In 2007, he made the offer again and it was accepted, and the school held its first integrated prom in 2008, profiled in the documentary Prom Night in Mississippi. * Taylor County, Georgia: In 2002, Taylor County, Georgia made international news for holding its first integrated prom, and again when a group of white students proceeded to hold a separate prom the following year. The 2006 film For One Night is based on these events. * Toombs County, Georgia: In 2004, it was reported that Hispanic students at Toombs County High School had planned their own prom, and that separate white, black, and Hispanic proms would be held. The school, 56% white, 31% black, and 12% Hispanic, had been holding separate white and black proms since 1971. * Montgomery County, Georgia: In 2009, The New York Times and The Daily Telegraph both profiled the racially segregated prom in Montgomery County, Georgia.

The toft village was occupied from the late-13th to the 16th century and temporary buildings were erected in the 19th century. Ulnaby Hall farm appears to have been built in the late-16th century, supplanting a high status medieval manorial enclosure associated with the original village. It is thought that the village shrank because of the change from labour-intensive arable farming to pasture, before being abandoned and the site was subsumed into the farm as pasture. Location The site is 6.8 km north-west of Darlington, in the grounds of Ulnaby Hall Farm, between Ulnaby Lane and the B6279, near High Coniscliffe, County Durham. The earthworks cover an area of 0.16 km2 under pasture, with the actual village covering 6.6 hectares. There are ridge and furrow areas to the north and west. There is visible evidence of two east‚Äìwest rows of tofts either side of an east‚Äìwest hollow way, and on the north side of the hollow way is the village green. The site, which slopes gently to the south, is bounded by roads on the north and west sides, and a stream to the south. Beneath the pasture the archaeology is on boulder clay overlying the Magnesian Limestone. Three fields make up the site: an 1841 document says that the western field was called Back Field, the eastern field was Garths and the southern field was New Acridge Carr. The fields immediately to the west of the site were called Kiln Field and Lime Kiln Field, and there is evidence of quarrying in Back Field. A garth in this context is an enclosed garden, yard or paddock, and would refer to the existing earthworks. Carr refers to marshland in the context of old pasture. History=Context The name, \\"Ulnaby\\", is possibly derived from the Old Norse for Ulfhethin's farm, which could imply that there was a pre-medieval settlement locally. Although archaeologists have not found reason to date the village itself before medieval times, there is local evidence of worked flints, a Bronze Age awl, three late Neolithic or early Bronze Age bowl barrows and the Roman road Dere Street, all within 3 kilometres. Roman items have been found locally at High Carlbury, High Coniscliffe and Ulnaby farm itself. Village and manor occupation Ulnaby Hall farm The village itself is believed to have been occupied from the late 13th to the 16th century; at first a few small tofts on the same hollow way which still leads east‚Äìwest through the lost village. In the mid-12th century the land belonged to the Greystoke family, and by the late 13th century it was the property of William de Somerville, who exchanged it for Scottish land held by the Marmadukes. In 1320 a Marmaduke widow gave the land to Sir Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, and after Sir Thomas was executed in 1322 it reverted to the Neville family, at a time when the Carlbury and Ulnaby estates were jointly worth ¬£20 per annum: quite profitable at that time. Before he died, it is thought possible that Lancaster redesigned the village around the green, and that he built the manor house in 1320 for a steward at the position now occupied by the southernmost farm buildings. The steward would have collected the peasants' dues for the absent landlord. Ulnaby and its associated manor belonged to the House of Neville from 1343 to 1573, and it is also possible that the original manor on the site, where Ulnaby Hall now stands, was built by Sir Ralph de Neville around 1354. Charles Neville forfeited it in 1571 for his part in the Rising of the North. Queen Elizabeth I granted it to the Tailboys family of Thornton Hall on 20 June 1573. The last medieval building survived on this spot until the 19th century, used as barn Documents of 1629 and 1654 indicate that the estate consisted of the manor, four tofts, three cottages, five barns, three gardens and orchards, a water cornmill and dovecote, with each of arable and meadow, of pasture and of woodland. It has been suggested that around 1573 the Tailboys family replaced the original manor with Ulnaby Hall and farm, possibly re-using material from the old manor house. The village dwindled in size until it became part of the farm; by 1629, three ‚Äì not four ‚Äì tofts remained, according to one source. Ulnaby Hall has been thought to date from 1609: this is possible as the earliest part of the hall dates from late 16th to early 17th century. Old maps show that Ulnaby village contained one last building of presumed medieval origin in 1855 beside the north-east corner of the present farm buildings, but that this was gone by 1896; it is said that it was used as a barn until the 1870s. Some farm cottages were then added, and these still exist. It is thought that the reduction in size of the village was in response to the success of the cloth industry, which encouraged change from labour- intensive arable land to pasture. Archaeological surveys and excavations=English Heritage and NDVA Group These earthworks were garths or toft enclosures A non-intrusive earthwork survey was done by English Heritage's Archaeological Survey and Investigation team in 2007. This suggested that there had been a village there without a green, then a toft village consisting of two rows of small farmsteads around a green. After that, some tofts were added and some abandoned. Next to the village there was an enclosed area including a manor, fishpond, dovecote and orchard. At the same time as the English Heritage survey, the Northumberland and Durham Vernacular Architecture Group undertook a measured survey of Ulnaby Hall. They thought that a raised rectangular earthwork in the old village green could possibly have been the earliest evidence of village habitation, perhaps indicating an earlier manor or even a Roman building. They found possible lynchets on the north side of the old road as the hollow way enters the village from the east. View north to Walworth Castle Hotel, showing Ulnaby's ridge and furrow fields in foreground The manorial enclosure was at least 1.6 hectares, and is considered to have been fairly high status. It was bounded by a wall of dressed limestone blocks, and contained a fishpond and dovecote. The fishpond was cut into an old ridge and furrow field, and the residence itself is believed to be underneath the present Ulnaby Hall. There is evidence of a succession of buildings on the site, terminating in the 19th century, but the village had shrunk by the 17th century, indicating the effect of the change from labour-intensive arable land to pasture. A survey of Ulnaby Hall shows a single-phase build in the late 16th century of a south-facing building of one large room over another and two wings at the back, with service rooms to the west. Two of the original gardens, to the south and east of the hall, still exist, and the third was probably the garth field or paddock to the south of the farm track. There was a smithy, five barns and orchards. One of the peasant houses was quite large, having three rooms. It is thought that the southern end of the site, around the water channel, was a marshy area that provided the village with various resources, and that it was drained in the 18th century. Time Team and Wessex Archaeology In April 2008, archaeological television programme Time Team excavated the site. A total of eight trenches were dug, and the report was written by Wessex Archaeology. Evidence was found of occupation from the late 13th or early 14th centuries until some time in the 15th century, when activity appears to have centred on the western tofts of the north row, and one or two tofts in the south row, until the 16th century. The double row of tofts with village green appeared to be the original pattern, and there was no evidence of pre-medieval occupation. The hollow way was cobbled and continued in regular use until the 19th century. Earlier buildings were found to be cruck-built with stone bases to the walls, and later ones probably stone- built. The manorial enclosure, early earthwork on the village green and the hollow way were not excavated. Preservation  The site is now listed as scheduled ancient monument, English Heritage Archive number 20961. Ulnaby Hall survives as a Grade II listed building with its farm. Some of its blocked-up windows are said to date back to the 16th or 17th century. An ancient sycamore tree and terrace in a field in front of the hall are survivors from one of the original gardens. Ulnaby Hall is surrounded by fields of earthworks under pasture, showing banks, ditches, walls and hollow ways. Possibly one of the fishponds was at the south end of the site, fed by the water channel. It is thought that it is the use of land as pasture which has preserved the site unchanged since the village was deserted. Around 2008, Ulnaby Hall Farm opened the site and farm as a visitor attraction. A reconstruction painting of the medieval village has been produced for visitors, along with a self-guided walk leaflet. Stiles, gates and bridges have been constructed for the use of visitors and to protect the earthworks, and guided walks were offered to local people by English Heritage. Wildlife at the site includes hares and owls.

After the Creek War, General Andrew Jackson ordered Major General Edmund P. Gaines and the 7th Infantry Regiment to construct a fort to protect settlers in the area from hostile Red Sticks. General Gaines instructed Major David E. Twiggs to set out from Fort Montgomery and establish a new post. The fort was placed at the border of the newly-formed Alabama Territory and Spanish West Florida on the bank of Murder Creek and named for 2nd Lieutenant Joel Crawford. Major John M. Davis described the fort as having two blockhouses located diagonally from each other, with the walls of the fort being made from multiple buildings. The fort also contained a medical building, artificer shop, and guard house. During the First Seminole War, Fort Crawford served as a base of operations for raids against Red Sticks in the Florida Panhandle. After the Butler Massacre, soldiers and Choctaw under the command of Major Youngs were sent from Fort Crawford to Fort Dale to assist in the pursuit of the Red Sticks. Supplies were sent to Fort Crawford from Fort Montgomery but delays were common. General Gaines wrote to Jose Masot, the governor of West Florida, to ask permission for supplies to be sent up the Conecuh River from Pensacola. Masot allowed three different ships to supply Fort Crawford via Pensacola, but never permitted regular supply lines via Pensacola. After the Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty took effect in 1821, Florida was ceded to the United States and Fort Crawford was no longer needed for its original use. Fort Crawford was connected to Fort Gaines via a road built in 1817. The site is marked on maps from the 1800s, but archaeological investigations have been unable to identify the original site of the fort.

It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2015‚Äì2019, which categorized it as a general aviation airport. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the Federal Emergency Management Agency signed a $25,000-per-month lease with the city to use at the Hope Municipal Airport as a staging area for trailers. About 12,000 travel trailers and 8,300 mobile homes sat at the airport. Many of them were never used by the victims of Hurricane Katrina or other emergency. History=World War II The Southwestern Proving Ground (SWPG) was utilized during World War II as an airfield for bombers and a testing ground for artillery shells and air bombs. The proving ground was in operation from 1941 to 1945 and was a major employer of Hempstead, Howard, Nevada, Clark and Lafayette counties. The construction of the Southwestern Proving Ground was part of the U.S. Government's National Defense Program which provided factories for the manufacture of munitions, airplanes and tanks in preparation for an eventual war. The news of construction on a proving ground in Hope became official in June 1941. The Real Estate Department of the War Department was in charge of acquiring land by filing condemnation proceedings against the tract and then taking possession of those sections they required to begin immediate work. After the initial evacuation order the War Department decided they needed more room for an airport so they added more acres. In the end 404 families were relocated by a deadline of July 24. Callahan Construction Company was awarded the job of erecting the proving ground by the War Department and the hiring of 4,000 construction workers began July 15. Senator Spencer and the project director, W.K. Mellyor, agreed upon a guarantee of preferential treatment of local citizens in considerations for jobs. When the airport was completed it had the third longest runway in the United States. Opening day festivities were postponed because of the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. The Army Air Force Proving Ground Command 616th Army Air Corps Detachment used the facility primarily to test ammunition during World War II. Testing began in January 1942 and Hempstead County residents were finally allowed within the gates of the proving ground in April. Troops explored the capabilities of LaBolenge chronographs and solenoid chronographs (two different instruments that record time intervals) for accuracy and reliability. 105-mm shells that had fired prematurely in battle were determined by research at SWPG to have faulty rotating bands, thus saving the lives of American troops. B-25s were sent from the airport in Hope to the Gulf of Mexico to observe the testing of bombs for tumbling and proper ballistics after being fired. After World War II the city of Hope received the Southwestern Proving Ground Airport, which became Hope Municipal Airport in 1947. Historic District The Southwestern Proving Ground Airport Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008, is composed of six buildings and five structures, which include the hangar, night landing plant, heating plant, storage building, garage, bomb assembly building, high explosives magazine and concrete runways and hangar apron. The magazine and bomb assembly building are located on adjacent land under private ownership. The remaining five buildings are located on owned by Hope Municipal Airport. The hangar is located to the west of U.S. Highway 278 and is surrounded by a concrete apron on all sides. The building is constructed of brick in a restrained Art Deco style on a continuous concrete foundation with a barrel vaulted roof and four corner towers. The interior of the hangar covers a total of . The night landing plant is adjacent to the hangar and is about from its southeastern corner. The plant is a very simple one-story rectangular brick edifice with a flat roof. The steam heating plant is located east of the hangar, across Airport Road. During the operation of SWPG this building generated steam heat to warm the buildings in the entire complex. The plant currently houses the Paul W. Klipsch Education Center, the educational component of the Klipsch Heritage Museum Association, Inc.www.klipschmuseum.org The storage building to the south of the steam heating plant is a rectangular vernacular building with a gable roof. The bomb assembly building is southwest of the hangar and is located on private property within a chain link fence. Bombs were assembled in this building and hauled by truck to Lake Charles, Louisiana, for testing. The high-explosives building is located on private property and is south of the bomb assembly building, outside of the fenced-in area.  Facilities and aircraft  Hope Municipal Airport covers an area of 1,575 acres (637 ha) at an elevation of 359 feet (109 m) above mean sea level. It has two runways with concrete surfaces: 4/22 is 5,560 by 150 feet (1,695 x 46 m) and 16/34 is 5,501 by 150 feet (1,677 x 46 m). For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2010, the airport had 8,000 aircraft operations, an average of 21 per day: 94% general aviation and 6% military. At that time there were 26 aircraft based at this airport: 88.5% single-engine, and 11.5% multi-engine.

He grew up with a love of early jazz recordings, principally those made by the New Orleans musicians; and in his playing he tried to re-create the style of such bands as King Oliver's. Webb \\"worked as a machine gun fitter in the Vickers-Armstrong factory at Crayford. The son of a former music hall artiste turned fishmonger, he was a keen jazz enthusiast and self-taught amateur pianist. He took it upon himself to organize lunchtime entertainment at the factory, assembling scratch bands from among the workers.\\" With his band, George Webb's Dixielanders, he played regularly and famously at The Red Barn public house at Barnehurst, Kent, from the early 1940s. \\"No one has ever seriously challenged their claim to have been the first British revivalist jazz band\\". They made several recordings and BBC radio broadcasts. The Dixielanders disbanded in January 1948. Webb was then part of Humphrey Lyttelton's band from September 1948 to June 1951. He reformed the Dixielanders in 1952, but this did not last long and he then concentrated on running a jazz club at the Shakespeare Hotel in Woolwich. From the mid-1960s he was an agent and manager for musicians. Early in the following decade, he returned to playing more frequently and toured Europe as a soloist. Another version of the Dixielanders operated from 1973 to 1974, and then Webb ran a pub in Essex for 12 years. After moving back to Kent, Webb was a guest in various bands into the 2000s. Among the musicians who played in the Dixielanders at various times were the British jazz trumpeter Humphrey Lyttelton, Wally Fawkes the clarinettist and Eddie Harvey the trombonist.

They were active from the mid-1980s till the early 1990s. Early history Celebrity Skin had its roots in Los Angeles hardcore band the Germs. Following the death of Darby Crash and subsequent breakup of the Germs in 1980, Germs guitarist Pat Smear eventually formed the band Vagina Dentata with former Crash girlfriend Michelle Bell on vocals, bassist Tim Ferris, and drummer Gary Jacoby. Vagina Dentata recorded a version of the song \\"Golden Boys\\", reputedly one of the last songs co-written by Darby Crash before his death, and a number that would become a Celebrity Skin staple for many years. Following the breakup of Vagina Dentata in 1985, Ferris and Jacoby recruited guitarist Robert Haas (formerly of the band Endless Banana) to form Celebrity Skin. Their first gig was reputedly a backyard performance for some graduating Caltech students, and was characterized by multiple costume changes and drum solos to flesh out their 15-minute set. At this point, Celebrity Skin did not have a regular drummer, and instead went through a number of drummers (supposedly 27), including, the \\"Little Matador\\" and Cujo. Jazz fusion guitarist John Goodsall of the progressive rock bands Atomic Rooster and Brand X was also briefly a member. Due to their raucous, prop- and costume-filled live shows, they were eventually banned from every club in Hollywood, and subsequently relocated to San Francisco, at which point former Verbal Abuse guitarist Jason Shapiro joined as second lead guitarist. They experienced similar difficulties in San Francisco, where they again were banned from a number of clubs due to their outrageous stage shows. One infamous show took place at the V.I.S. Club on Divisadero Street a week before Christmas. Photographer and artist Tony Millionaire created a mechanical sleigh pulled by four skinned goat heads. The sleigh had a bull's penis in it and the heads rocked back and forth feigning motion. The show was shut down prematurely by the owner, and the animal parts were callously thrown into the street. The next day the penis and heads were discovered off Hayes Street. Shortly thereafter the San Francisco Chronicle ran a story of \\"possible ritual animal sacrifice\\". After Cujo left the band they were united with another Germs alumnus, drummer Don Bolles, who had also played with Vox Pop and 45 Grave following the breakup of the Germs. At this point, Celebrity Skin focused on the music and costumes, and toned down the more sensational aspects of their stage act. In 1988, they recorded their cover of \\"SOS\\" by ABBA for the SST Records compilation The Melting Plot. By 1989, they were one of LA's top live acts, and stories about the band appeared in the Los Angeles Times and in the hardcore magazine Flipside. In 1989, the band began negotiations with the German record label LSD Records, which had recently signed the LA retro- alternative bands Thee Fourgiven and the Miracle Workers, to go to Berlin and record an album. Negotiations fell through, however, when the band discovered that the record label had only purchased them one-way plane tickets. At the same time, they were evicted from their apartments and forced to live in \\"The Celebrity Suites\\", a suite of offices above a dance studio overlooking Hollywood Boulevard; and adjacent to the offices of Rock City News. However, in April 1989 they were soon evicted from these as well and forced to find other accommodations. In late 1989/early 1990, Celebrity Skin signed with LA- based record company Triple X Records. Triple X Records, founded in 1986 by Dean Naleway and Peter Heur, had developed a reputation for signing first wave hardcore bands like D.I. and Rhino 39, and had recently achieved much success by releasing Jane's Addiction's first album. It was hoped that Triple X could do for Celebrity Skin what had been done for Jane's Addiction; i.e., to take a highly popular local band and record a debut album that would allow them to reach a larger following, resulting in a major label deal. Celebrity Skin joined a stable of other popular LA live acts, including Liquid Jesus, Inland Empires Funky Junkies, Pigmy Love Circus, the Ultras (formerly the Ultraviolets), on the Triple X label and would do many shows with these other bands. In early 1990, Celebrity Skin recorded a four-song self-titled EP which was produced by producer and former Sparks guitarist Earle Mankey, who had previously produced albums by The Runaways, The Dickies, and The Three O'Clock. The EP was recorded in Mankey's Thousand Oaks house and was released in April 1990. Throughout 1990 the band played a number of gigs at LA clubs the Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood) and the Whisky a Go Go with such other acts as Liquid Jesus, L.A.P.D. (aka KORN), the Ultraviolets, Haunted Garage, Tender Fury, the Miracle Workers, Thelonious Monster, Steel Pole Bath Tub, and Babes In Toyland. Celebrity Skin toured the US in 1990 as the opening band for Psychic TV. In early 1991, the band recorded their first long-playing album, entitled Good Clean Fun, in Hollywood, which was released in April 1991. The album was produced by long-time punk producer Geza X (who had produced albums by the Germs, the Weirdos, Black Flag and the Dead Kennedys). The album showcased the band's progressively greater pop direction but didn't sell well. Breakup In 1990, Celebrity Skin were playing in New York, touring with former 45 Grave bassist Rob Graves (who was helping them out on the road), when he was discovered dead of an overdose in the back of the tour van. Throughout 1991, Celebrity Skin continued to play local gigs in support of their album, playing at such clubs as Club Lingerie, Gazzarri's, and the Roxy in Los Angeles; the Kennel Club in San Francisco; and Bogart's in Long Beach, with such supporting acts as Tad, L7, Helmet, Tiny Tim, Green Jello, the Dickies, Theater Carnivale, Ethyl Meatplow, Shonen Knife, Permanent Green Light, the Muffs, and the Ultras. On August 24, 1991, they played the Splattering of Tribes Festival in the desert outside Indio, California, with such acts as Lead Corpse, the Rails, Liquid Jesus, Sort of Quartet, Pigmy Love Circus, Haunted Garage, the Stains, DC3, Suplex Slam, Porno Sponges, and Dead Corpse. In October 1991, Celebrity Skin did a tour of the United States opening for the glam metal band L.A. Guns. Chuck Mosley from Faith No More traveled with them helping out on the road. On December 4, 1991, Celebrity Skin played a show at the Shark Club in Hollywood with Pigmy Love Circus and the Saddletramps, 10 days after the death of Queen vocalist Freddie Mercury. The gig would turn out to be their final one, and the next week the band's breakup due to internal tensions was announced in the LA Weekly. Despite their enormous popularity in the LA alternative club scene, Celebrity Skin never managed to achieve mainstream success. Their glam, '70s-influenced look, melodic hooks, and feel-good lyrics set them apart from the then-popular grunge movement, which emphasized stripped-down attire (typically jeans and flannel shirts), heavy and frequently atonal music, and angry lyrics. In addition, because of their glam look and sound, they were frequently lumped in with 80s glam metal bands such as Poison and Warrant despite having little musically in common with these acts. A description of their travails can be found on the web site Sleazegrinder: > The mullets of the fly-over states were manifestly unprepared to cope with > the 'Skins. These poor saps automatically all hadda buy every record they > saw s'long as the doods on the cover were rank lookin' longhairs with nose > rings and they all bought the e.p. only to feel infuriated, ashamed, and > ripped-off by how un-macho Celebrity Skin was‚Äîand their Geza X-produced > full-length on Triple X records confused the heartland's bleached denim- > wearers even more.

A lot of people don't need their rock to be funny. Especially > not rural Metal Church enthusiasts. Following the breakup of Celebrity Skin, the various members moved on to other music-related pursuits. According to AllMusic, guitarist Jason Shapiro formed the band Threeway (still in existence as of late 2011) also currently playing with Redd Kross, and bassist Tim Ferris formed Big Baby, and later reputedly joined the Cramps. Lead singer Gary Jacoby released a second CD as a member of the Death Folk with former Germ member Pat Smear, and a solo album under the name of Gary Celebrity, Diary of a Monster, which contained the former Celebrity Skin songs \\"Fairies To London\\", \\"Golden Boys\\", \\"Gods\\", \\"Hobos\\", and \\"Life's a Gas\\". Drummer Don Bolles was a disc jockey for the Los Angeles radio station KDLD, where he had a regular and long-running show called The All- Night Truck Driver's Show and played in the occasional 45 Grave reunion show. In 2006, in answer to the favorable response to the Germs biopic What We Do Is Secret, Bolles, guitarist Pat Smear and bassist Lorna Doom reunited the LA hardcore band the Germs with the actor who played deceased singer Darby Crash, Shane West, taking over on vocals. Bolles currently plays with the group Fancy Space People. Reunion In August 2005, Celebrity Skin posted a page on the MySpace web site and as of April 2010 had 962 friends. On October 6, 2007, all five members of Celebrity Skin reunited for the second annual LA Weekly Detour Music Festival in downtown Los Angeles and were enthusiastically received by the crowd; a number of videos of this performance (as well as a few from their heyday) are available on YouTube. As of August 2008 they have posted no information regarding future shows. Sound and image Celebrity Skin's musical style is a combination of glam rock and punk rock; i.e., it consists of pop hooks and strong melodies played with a rough, loud, feedback-laden edge. Similar to their contemporaries Redd Kross, Celebrity Skin celebrated 70s musical and fashion styles. Their most relevant musical antecedents were the so-called \\"glitter\\" bands of mid-70s pre-punk Los Angeles, including Sparks, Zolar X and the Quick, as well as the early Los Angeles glitter- influenced punk bands the Germs, the Weirdos, the Skulls, and the Dickies. Their music also had elements of such first wave glam bands as Slade, David Bowie, T. Rex, and the New York Dolls; an early review by the LA Weekly stated that Celebrity Skin was \\"the only band in Hollywood to take seriously the music and styles of the original wave of glam rockers like Bowie Sparks, Gary Glitter, T. Rex, etc.\\" Another obvious musical antecedent was Redd Kross, one of the first L.A. bands to embrace the sound, themes, and images of 70s trash culture and combine them with the harder edge of punk rock. Celebrity Skin's sound evolved over their career, with earlier songs like \\"Long Black Yak\\" and \\"Rat Fink\\" having a rougher, more punk/hardcore quality while later songs like \\"Evicted\\" showing off more of their pop side, with lusher harmonies and more melodic guitar. In recorded work, their sound was considerably more polished than their live sound, and was augmented by keyboards,and sound effects. Their lyrics often focused on themes such as glamor, celebrity, stardom, etc. Written descriptions of their music emphasized their musical range. A 1990 article in BAM described their sound as having \\"the quirkiness and strange time signatures of Sparks\\", \\"the multi-lead guitars of Lynyrd Skynyrd or Wishbone Ash\\", \\"the sheer punk rock energy/white noise of the Germs\\", and \\"a knack for hooks worthy of ABBA or KC and the Sunshine Band\\"; an article from BAM later in 1990 emphasized their \\"trademark Sparks-meet-Dickies-meet-Oingo Boingo sound\\". An LA Weekly article from 1990 mentioned \\"distorted sounds of 70's pop washed over with raw punk and gushes of feedback\\", and an article from 1991 describes their sound as \\"stringing Queen crunch-chords and Josie & the Pussycats harmonies and the strip-joint doorman's come-on of Alice Cooper\\". Finally, a review in the rock trade publication Music Connection from 1989 described Celebrity Skin's musical style as follows: > Celebrity Skin is certainly like nothing you‚Äôve ever heard before or likely > will hear again. At times, the band's songs transport you to a crowded beer > hall in D√ºsseldorf, Germany, with packs of unruly Germans singing drunken > anthems. Then they whisk you off to England for an eye and an earful of > campy glam humor and drag-rock fashion. And then whoosh, back to the States > for a screeching thrash that only emanate from a decidedly American > intellect. Celebrity Skin covered a broad range of songs by other artists. Among their most popular songs was a cover of \\"SOS\\" by Swedish pop group ABBA, which they recorded twice, once on the Melting Plot compilation for SST Records and once on their eponymous Triple X EP. Their covers of \\"This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us\\" by Sparks and \\"All the Young Dudes\\" by Mott the Hoople were never recorded but were also extremely popular show closers in their live shows. They also covered \\"Celluloid Heroes\\" by the Kinks, \\"Godstar\\" by Psychic TV, \\"Elo Kiddies\\" by Cheap Trick, and \\"To Sir With Love\\" by Lulu. Celebrity Skin's live shows were renowned for their raucousness and entertainment value, and mimicked the image and theatrics of 70s glam artists like Alice Cooper, Gary Glitter, Ziggy Stardust-era David Bowie, and Slade. Moreover, they frequently played shows with other groups, such as Theatre Carnivale, Green Jello, and Gwar, that had elaborate stage shows and interactive theatrics.

He played close to 300 games and scored over 4000 points in his NBL career. Professional career Allen debuted as a teenager for the Otago Nuggets in 1998 and enjoyed his best season with the club in 2001, when he averaged 20 points per game and was named in the All-Star Five. His first championship title came the following year in 2002 with the Waikato Titans. He returned to Otago for the 2003 and 2004 seasons before joining the New Zealand Breakers as a development player for the 2004‚Äì05 NBL season. He went on to play three seasons for the Harbour Heat while also joining the Singapore Slingers for the 2007‚Äì08 NBL season. In 2009, Allen joined the Auckland Stars before returning to Waikato to play with the Pistons in 2010 and 2011. Allen's second championship came in 2012 with the Auckland Pirates. In 2013, Allen returned to Otago to play for the Nuggets once again. After taking a year off from basketball, Allen signed with the Super City Rangers for the 2015 NBL season on 1 December 2014. On 1 April 2016, Allen signed with the Southland Sharks for the rest of the 2016 NBL season. On 25 January 2017, he re-signed with the Sharks for the 2017 season. Allen battled a groin injury for much of the 2017 season. On 22 November 2017, he re-signed with the Sharks for the 2018 season. However, he later retired prior to the start of the season. National team career In 2012, Allen earned his first Tall Blacks selection to compete at the FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Venezuela. He was able to finally follow in the footsteps of his father, Glen, who represented New Zealand in 1973. Personal Allen and his wife, Natalie, have three children. On 12 August 2011, Allen was involved in a horrific car accident along with Pistons' teammate Dan Ryan. He was a non-seatbelt wearing passenger in a speeding car that smashed into a wall on the Auckland Harbour Bridge, sending him hurtling through a window and skimming along State Highway 1.

It is located in the neighbourhood of Areeta, in the municipality of Getxo. In its current form, the station opened on 11 November, 1995, replacing a much older overground station that existed in the same place.  History  The original station, named Las Arenas, was first opened on June 30, 1887, as the northern terminus station of the Bilbao-Las Arenas railway, which connected the city of Bilbao with Getxo by the estuary. It was an at-grade station, covered by a large train shed. The station was originally built as a cul-de-sac, but after the extension of the line to Plentzia in the decade of 1890, it was renovated as trains continued along the coast past the station. The station had two side platforms and was one of the most relevant train stations of the entire railway. Starting in 1947, the narrow-gauge railway companies that operated within the Bilbao metropolitan area were merged to become Ferrocarriles y Transportes Suburbanos de Bilbao S.A. (Railways and Suburban Transports of Bilbao), shortened FTS and the first precedent of today's Metro Bilbao. In 1977, the FTS network was transferred to the public company FEVE and in 1982 to the recently created Basque Railways. In the decade of 1990s, it was decided the station, just like the most of the former railway line, would be integrated into Metro Bilbao's line 1 with the demolition of the original station building and the construction of a new underground station. The new underground station was designed by English architect Norman Foster and was opened to the public on 11 November, 1995. The new station was named Areeta instead, following the Basque language orthographic rules and in replacement of the former Las Arenas name, which was in Spanish.

She was also appointed the director of the Detroit Public Library (1970‚Äì1978), becoming the first African-American director of a major city public library in the United States. Biography=Early life Stanton Jones was born on May 14, 1913, in St. Louis, Missouri, to a close- knit, Catholic family. Her future career and impact in library science almost seemed predestined as she frequented the library at an early age. Jones recalls that she was one of the smallest patrons at the public library near her grandmother's house; she was also among very few black children at that local library. Although Jones had very little interaction with librarians in her young years, she read what interested her and selected her own materials. Her mother, Etta J. Stanton, worked as a school teacher, lecturing at public school systems until her marriage. Due to the marriage bar prohibiting married women to teach in the public school system, she taught in Catholic parochial schools to help support her family, including Clara Jones' endeavor to attend college. Jones' father, Ralph Herbert Stanton, was a manager at the Standard Life Insurance Company. He eventually accepted a position with the Atlanta Life Insurance Company, where he worked until his death. Jones grew up in a highly segregated St. Louis neighborhood, but she was not daunted by the assumed, implicit Jim Crow laws; she instead regarded her young life to be privileged with all her primary mentors being African American.McCook, Kathleen de la Pe√±a (1998). Women of Color in Librarianship: An oral history. 5th ed. Chicago, IL: American Library Association.Fletcher, Sharon Melson. \\"Clara Stanton Jones Biography\\". biography.jrank.org. Education Education and solidarity were heavily emphasized in Jones' family. She obtained a well-rounded education even though the St. Louis public school system was completely segregated. She grew up in an entirely African-American world, with black role-models and mentors. In high school, Jones aspired to become an elementary school teacher, even though her future salary would be slightly below white counterparts. This position would still provide a high standard of living for African Americans at that time because the income gap between white and black teachers was only slight. Jones was the first member of her family to graduate from college. St. Louis was highly segregated, but instead of attending the local, tuition-free teachers college that was designated for black students, Jones attended the Milwaukee State Teacher's College in 1930; she was inspired by her older brothers' stories of college life away from home at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Jones was one of only six black students at the college. She transferred to Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia, where she majored in English and History and decided to become a librarian instead of a teacher. The president Florence Read caught notice of Jones' typing skills and offered her a position as a typist with the new Atlanta University Library; the librarians encouraged Jones to pursue a career in librarianship. She was highly receptive to their suggestions as she had already considered this career change. Jones remained in that position until her graduation; she received her Bachelor of Arts in 1934 from Spelman and a degree in Library Science in 1938 from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.Black Women Stirring the Waters (1997). Oakland, CA: Marcus Books Printing. Career in Library and Information Science Jones began working in libraries the same year she completed her degree in Library Science. She said that at the beginning of 1938, she worked in libraries at Dillard University in New Orleans and Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Jones spent the remainder of her library career at the Detroit Public Library, retiring in 1978 as the director. She was elected the first black president of the American Library Association after she accepted the position as head of the Detroit Public Library. There was opposition to the election of Jones at the Detroit Public Library; the Friends of the Library had originally offered to supplement the librarian's wages but withdrew the offer, then three people, a high ranking administrator and two of the commissioners, resigned when she was elected. Her detractors tried to challenge her authority by questioning her decisions, making decisions behind her back, and using degrading language. Her secretary, Carolyn Moseley, recalled how Jones never discussed these obstacles because that would affect how people perceived her. Moseley also recalled how Jones focused helping others become more successful by utilizing her power and resources on their behalf. Advocacy for the ALA \\"Resolution on Racism and Sexism Awareness\\" In May 1977, Clara Stanton Jones, then president of the American Library Association, responded to the ALA Intellectual Freedom Committee's (IFC) recommendation to quash the ALA's \\"Resolution on Racism and Sexism Awareness\\" because its language remained unclear. Her response was published in American Libraries, the official publication of the ALA. Jones opposed the IFC's proposal, declaring that the resolution required further adjustments and amendments to the language before the committee considered annulment. The IFC feared that the resolution favored censorship as a means to purge library materials of racist and sexist language, thereby opposing the Library Bill of Rights pledge to sustain access to information and enlightenment despite content and to encourage libraries to challenge censorship. The ALA made the decision to deliberate the fate of the resolution and report its results at the 1977 Detroit conference. Jones asserted that the resolution did not conflict with the Library Bill of Rights, and instead promoted awareness by encouraging training and outreach programs in the libraries and library schools. In agreement with the Library Bill of Rights, she advocated for more enlightenment, not repression, to combat the effects of racism and sexism in library materials. Jones viewed the resolution as the framework, and not the final solution, for enabling librarians to confront issues that hampered \\"human freedom\\". She argued, \\"The spirit of the 'Resolution on Racism and Sexism Awareness' is not burdened with repression; it is liberating. If the resolution is imperfect, try to make it perfect, but not by destroying it first!\\" Death Clara Stanton Jones died peacefully in her sleep on September 30th, 2012 in Oakland California at the age of 99. She was survived by her three children, seven grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.

A volcanic hazard is the probability that a volcanic eruption or related geophysical event will occur in a given geographic area and within a specified window of time. The risk that can be associated with a volcanic hazard depends on the proximity and vulnerability of an asset or a population of people near to where a volcanic event might occur. Lava flows There are different forms of effusive lava that can provide different hazards. Pahoehoe lava is smooth and ropy while Aa lava is blocky and hard. Lava flows normally follow the topography, sinking into depressions and valleys and flowing down the volcano. Lava flows will bury roads farmlands and other forms of personal property.Kusky, 24 This lava could destroy homes, cars, and lives standing in the way.Rosi, 63 Lava flows are dangerous, however, they are slow moving and this gives people time to respond and evacuate out of immediate areas. People can mitigate this hazard by not moving to valleys or depressed areas around a volcano.Ernst, et. al, 6693 Pyroclastic materials (tephra) and flow Tephra is a generalized word for the various bits of debris that are launched out of a volcano during an eruption, regardless of their size.USGS, Volcanic Hazards: Tephra, including volcanic ash Pyroclastic materials are generally categorized according to size: dust measures at <1/8 mm, ash is 1/8‚Äì2 mm, cinders are 2‚Äì64 mm, and bombs and blocks are both >64 mm.Decker, 122 There are different hazards associated with the different kinds of pyroclastic materials. Dust and ash could coat cars and homes, rendering the car unable to drive with dust accumulation in the engine. They could also layer on homes and add weight to roofs causing the house to collapse. Also, ash and dust inhaled could cause long-term respiratory issues in people inhaling the particles.Volcanic hazards, Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries Cinders are flaming pieces of ejected volcanic material which could set fire to homes and wooded areas. Bombs and blocks run the risk of hitting various objects and people within range of the volcano. Projectiles can be thrown thousands of feet in the air and can be found several miles away from the initial eruption point.Kusky, 27 A pyroclastic flow is a fast-moving (up to 700 km/hr) extremely hot (~1000 ¬∞C) mass of air and tephra that charges down the sides of a volcano during an explosive eruption. Mudflows, floods, debris flows and avalanches When pyroclastic materials mix with water from a nearby stream or river, they can turn the watercourse into a fast moving mudflows. These are called lahars;Olsen, et. al 48 when the lahar contains large material such as blocks of rock and trees, it is a volcanic debris flow.Decker, 144 Lahars can form directly from a pyroclastic material flow flowing into a river, or could possibly form after the main eruption. The latter is referred to as secondary lahars and form when rain wets the ash and debris already on a landscape and stick together rolling along the topography. It's estimated that it can only take 30% water to initiate ash into a lahar.Kusky 30 The thicker and/or more fast-moving a lahar, the more potential to destroy things in its path, thus making it more dangerous than a slower and/or more diluted lahar. Lahars and mudflows can damage buildings, wildlife and cars and can prove difficult to escape once caught in them. The lahars can coat objects, wash objects away and can knock objects down by their force. Lahars, debris flows and mudflows that travel into a river or stream run the potential for crowding the waterway, forcing the water to flow outward and causing a flood. The volcanic matter could also pollute the water, making it unsafe to drink. The debris that is ejected from the volcano adds to the sides of the slope with each eruption, making the sides steeper each time. Eventually the slope gets so steep that it fails and an avalanche ensues.Living With Volcanoes (USGS) 18 These avalanches carry material and debris for very long distances at very short intervals. This makes a warning system nearly impossible because the slope failure could occur at any time. The avalanche will destroy anything in its path including personal property, houses, buildings, vehicles and possibly even wildlife. If the impact of the materials in the avalanche doesn't destroy the person or object at first contact, there could be damage resulting from the weight of prolonged material on the objects.Lockwood, 42 Earthquakes related to volcanism Earthquakes can occur due to volcanic activity. These earthquakes could produce topographical deformation and/or destruction of buildings, homes, cars, etc. There are two different types of these earthquakes: volcano tectonic earthquakes and long period earthquakes. \\"Earthquakes produced by stress changes in solid rock due to the injection or withdrawal of magma (molton rock) are called volcano tectonic earthquakes\\". These are hazardous due to the possibility of ground cracks or slope failures, therefore destroying everything in its path.Volcanic Earthquakes Long period earthquakes, which happen when magma is suddenly forced into the surrounding rocks, are generally seen as a precursor to the actual eruption. Monitoring and mitigation According to John Ewert and Ed Miller in a 1995 publication, \\"a great majority of the world's potentially active volcanoes are unmonitored\\". Of the historically active volcanoes in the world, less than one fourth are monitored. Only twenty-four volcanoes in the entire world are thoroughly monitored for activity. They also state that \\"seventy-five percent of the largest explosive eruptions since 1800 occurred at volcanoes that had no previous historical eruptions\\". By monitoring the seismic and geological activity, the USGS can warn people ahead of time about impending danger. These volcanologists measure the size of an eruption in two ways: the eruption magnitude (by the volume or mass of magma erupted) and eruption intensity (by the rate of magma erupted).Volcanic Hazards of Yellowstone National Park There are also various forms of satellites and imagery, such as satellite InSAR imagery, that monitor the activity that isn't exposed to the naked eye.Zhong, et. al 55 However, the situation has somewhat changed with the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction 1994/31.

It is located in the neighbourhood of Neguri, in the municipality of Getxo. On its current form, the station opened on 11 November 1995, replacing an older station.  History  The primitive station opened in 1893 as part of the Getxo-Plentzia extension of the Bilbao-Las Arenas railway. The station was at-grade with two side platforms and a station building following similar design and architectural styles as other stations from the line. Starting in 1947, the narrow-gauge railway companies that operated within the Bilbao metropolitan area were merged to become Ferrocarriles y Transportes Suburbanos de Bilbao S.A. (Railways and Suburban Transports of Bilbao), shortened FTS and the first precedent of today's Metro Bilbao. In 1977, the FTS network was transferred to the public company FEVE and in 1982 to the recently created Basque Railways. In the decade of 1990s, it was decided the station, just like the most of the former railway line, would be integrated into Metro Bilbao's line 1. A new station was built 100 meters northbound from the old station building, which since became disused. The new station opened in 1995. The old station is one of the few buildings of the former Bilbao-Las Arenas railway still standing, although in state of disuse. Due to risk of collapse, the building was stabilised in 2018.

The work is considered one of the fundamental works on dialectical materialism and on Leninist communism. The book remains important in understanding the philosophy and politics of the Soviet Union; it consolidates the work of important contributions to Marxist theory.  Publication  The First Edition of The Fundamentals was published in 1961. A Second Edition was published in 1963. The text draws heavily on the works of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin, with additional references to Friedrich Engels, Josef Stalin, and Nikita Khrushchev.  Synopsis =Part One: The Philosophical Foundations of The Marxist-Leninist World Outlook Part One of Fundamentals covers materialist and idealist philosophy, the use of dialectics within materialist philosophy and its opposition to metaphysics, and develops a theory of knowledge, truth, necessity, and human freedom. The text argues that only a consistently materialist approach to philosophy can be truly scientific, since it requires the recognition of the objective existence of matter, as outside and independent of the human mind. Part Two: The Materialist Conception of History Part Two of the work covers Marxist theories of history, or historical materialism, by outlining the role of the mode of production, class, class struggles, the state and the individual in social development. Part Three: Political Economy of Capitalism Part Three summarizes Marx's Das Kapital and Lenin's theory of Imperialism. Part Four: Theory and Tactics of the International Communist Movement Part Four covers the Marxist‚ÄìLeninist strategy of the international communist and working-class movement.

He is of Sephardi Jewish descent. Originally elected as a member of Union Montr√©al, Perez sat as an independent councillor from December 2012 until August 2013, when he affiliated with the new √âquipe Denis Coderre.\\"Borough mayor Lionel Perez joins Coderre‚Äôs party\\". The Gazette, July 30, 2013. In the 2013 election, he ran for re-election to his original council seat in Darlington rather than as borough mayor, and was re-elected. Education Perez holds a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Osgoode Hall Law School in Toronto and a Bachelor of Civil Law (B.C.L.) from the Faculty of Law of the Universit√© de Montr√©al. He also holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science. Law career Before being elected, Perez was a practicing lawyer and co-founder of the Canadian legal document filing service company CorporationCentre.ca. Under his guidance, CorporationCentre.ca has garnered much recognition from numerous publications including the PROFIT HOT 50 and PROFIT 100 rankings, both published annually by Profit, Enterprise Magazine and L'Actualit√©. Perez has also developed an expertise in advising startups and has written on the business and legal aspects of business formation and its impact on small business owners. Prior to founding CorporationCentre.ca, Perez practiced corporate commercial law with a technology law firm advising start-ups and publicly traded corporations. In October 2010, Perez appeared as legal counsel on behalf the JORCCQ before the Quebec National Assembly commission to present its brief on the government‚Äôs draft legislation (Bill 94) governing reasonable accommodation when receiving or delivering government services. City councillor He won a decisive victory beating his closest rival by over 20 per cent of the vote in his first election on November 1, 2009 running under the Union Montr√©al party of Mayor G√©rald Tremblay. He was appointed to serve on the Commission on Finances, Administrative Services, and Human Capital. He was also named to the Land Use and Planning Commission of the Communaut√© Metropolitaine de Montr√©al. At the borough level, he was the official elected representative on the Comit√© consultatif d'urbanise (CCU). In December 2010 he was named vice-president, and ranking member of the governing Union Montr√©al party, to the new Commission on the Examination of Contracts. Perez made Canadian news headlines in May 2011 after he spoke up against the use of inappropriate Twitter remarks by a fellow councillor during council meetings. Opposition city councillor Benoit Dorais posted insulting comments on his Twitter account about the Union Montr√©al members during a council meeting, some of which were directed at Perez. The comments provoked Perez to bring the issue to the attention of council so that an examination of the rules governing council's proceedings should be extended to cover social media as well. Perez was not against the use of Twitter during council meetings, but rather wished to ensure the appropriateness of the language used by council members on Twitter while in session. Perez‚Äôs intervention resulted in a new policy on Twitter use by councillors, allowing councillors to use Twitter while council is in session, but with caution against using insulting or \\"unparliamentary\\" language as set out in a list of 225 words and phrases banned by the National Assembly of Quebec. The ruling is believed to be the first of its kind governing a municipal council in Canada.

Volume 1=Coward (Issues 1-5, Oct 06 - Mar 07) The story begins five years after Leo Patterson was the only survivor of the disastrous \\"Salt Bay job,\\" and fifteen years after his father Tommy, in state prison for the murder of Teeg Lawless, was killed by another inmate. Since then, Leo has kept a low profile as a pickpocket while he struggles to take care of Ivan, Tommy's old friend and partner-in-crime, who suffers from both Alzheimer's disease and an addiction to heroin. Leo has a strict set of rules he adheres to, and a reputation for being brilliant at planning scores, but also as a coward who runs from conflict and always manages to escape a bad situation. Both aspects attract the attention of Seymour, another Salt Bay survivor, and crooked cop Jeff. They try to recruit Leo for an armored-car heist, telling him a police evidence van will be carrying $5 million in diamonds to the courthouse. He refuses, unwilling to return to that life, but Seymour knows Leo can't refuse Greta, a recovering heroin addict and widow of Terry Watson, who was also killed at Salt Bay. Greta needs the money from the heist to start a new life with her daughter Angie, and blames Leo for her husband's death. Leo reluctantly agrees and recruits his friend Donnie, an epileptic con man.Criminal Vol 1 #1 When Jeff includes his own partners in the score, Leo and Greta suspect a double-cross, but they continue with the heist. Leo, however, doesn't anticipate that Jeff and his partners will pull guns and start shooting in the middle of the job, killing Donnie and wounding Greta. Leo, having made a back-up plan, manages to escape with Greta and the score, which they discover isn't diamonds but a briefcase full of uncut heroin. Jeff and his partners work for a drug kingpin named \\"Roy-L.T.\\" Hyde, and the evidence-van heist was intended both to retrieve his merchandise and facilitate the release of his lieutenant, Delron. \\"Roy-L\\" kills one of Jeff's partners as punishment, and sends the recently-freed Delron with Jeff to track down the heroin. While she recovers, Greta, Ivan, and Leo lie low at Leo's grandfather's farm. As Leo and Greta succumb to their mutual attraction and have sex, Ivan goes looking for a fix and discovers the stash of heroin. Meanwhile, Jeff and Delron track down Greta's mother and daughter. The next morning, Leo is devastated to find Ivan dead, having overdosed on the uncut heroin. He withdraws emotionally from Greta as he buries Ivan, and she lashes out in frustration, calling him a coward. He returns alone to the city and meets with \\"Genuine Jen\\" Waters, and old friend now Internal Affairs officer, who theorizes that Jeff hoped Leo would escape, but without the drugs, drawing the attention of the police while he paid his debt to \\"Roy-L.\\" Meanwhile, distraught over Leo and tempted by the heroin, Greta calls her mother's house, where Jeff and Delron are waiting to trace the call after having killed Greta's mother. Leo breaks into Seymour's apartment, looking for leverage against him, but finds a message on his answering machine: Jeff ordering him to join them in going after Greta.Criminal Vol 1 #4 Leo races back to the farm, finding Greta tortured to death. Seymour appears, having stayed behind with a picture of Angie behind held hostage. As they retrieve the briefcase of heroin, Seymour tells Leo that he's just as much a coward as everyone says; Leo retorts that his father didn't kill Teeg Lawless: Leo did. Leo throws an open bag of heroin in Seymour's face and coldly executes him, saying that what he's really afraid of is his own capacity for violence. He then tracks Delron to a local motel and stabs him to death, rescuing Angie. After leaving her with Gnarly, a bartender and old friend of his father, he tricks Jeff into leading him to \\"Roy-L\\" and kills him and his men in a gun battle. Jeff and Leo shoot each other several times; Jeff calls for backup and tries to flee, but Leo, knowing that Jeff participated in Greta's torture, follows and finishes him off. Severely wounded and too weak to escape the arriving police, Leo realizes that dying is a lot harder than killing and quips, \\"just my luck.\\"Criminal Vol 1 #5 Lawless (Issues 6-10, May 07 - Nov 07) After an incident that began in a bar in Baghdad's Green Zone, Tracy Lawless served eighteen months in a military prison, isolated from contact with the outside world. Upon release, he discovers that his brother Ricky was killed nine months earlier, and he soon goes AWOL to find out what happened. On the way to the city, he stops at the Center City docks long enough to rob two men carrying a briefcase of illicit cash, shooting one in the process.Criminal Vol 1 #6 He finds an old acquaintance named Jacob, a now-crippled criminal who specializes in creating false identities. Since he isn't recognized by Jacob, Tracy is confident he can infiltrate Ricky's old crew to discover why his brother was killed. Tracy finds the crew‚ÄîGray, Nelson, Davey, and Ricky's lover Mallory‚Äîmeeting frequently at the Undertow in obvious anticipation of an upcoming heist.

After considering killing her Tracy lets Mallory go only for her to be kidnapped by Hydes men. This forces Tracy to meet Hyde, who wants retribution for his stolen money.

He is also a co-founder of Vrenetic, which he co-founded with Roland Emmerich. Biography= Early Years  After a brief spell in a steel factory, Marco Weber earned his spurs in the media industry as production manager for the German version of The Price Is Right before venturing into the production of commercials. He gave his debut as a movie producer with the documentary Annie‚Äôs Shooting. Theatrical production being his main goal, he went to Los Angeles at the age of 25 in order to produce and finance independent movies. One year later he launched his first feature, Don't Do It, with upcoming stars such as Heather Graham and David Arquette. Together with blockbuster director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day) he produced the $20-million sci-fi thriller The Thirteenth Floor directed by Josef Rusnak, starring Vincent D'Onofrio and Armin Mueller- Stahl.Die Welt, 14.9.2006, S.29  Atlantic Streamline  In 1998 he founded his company Atlantic Streamline, which was to produce ‚Äì among others‚Äîthe heist comedy You're Dead with John Hurt und Rhys Ifans. In 2001 the flop of All the Queen's Men (directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky, who went on to win the 2007 Academy Award for best foreign picture for The Counterfeiters) plunged the firm into major trouble. But one year later Weber was able to celebrate his biggest hit up until this point ‚Äì the black comedy Igby Goes Down, which earned Golden Globe nominations for its actors Kieran Culkin and Susan Sarandon. Writer-director Burr Steers was honored with an Independent Spirit Award nomination for best screenplay. In the wake of this success Weber closed a first look/cofinancing deal with the studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer/United Artists.Dana Harris, David Bloom, \\"Lion/UA ink Streamline first-look deal\\" Variety, April 22, 2003 His 2005 production of Rohtenburg created a stir in Germany at first. The movie was inspired by the true crime case of convicted cannibalistic murderer Armin Meiwes. Upon protest of the offender, who saw his personal rights violated, the Higher Regional Court of Frankfurt prohibited the theatrical release that had been scheduled for March 9, 2006.Ed Meza, \\"Court halts cannibal pic release\\", Variety, March 3, 2006 Three years later this ban was to be overturned by the German Federal Court.Erik Kirschbaum, \\"Cannibal film cleared for German release Variety, May 27, 2009 Abroad the movie had already made a positive impression.

End of 2005 he and his partner Helge Sasse together with a group of German-American investors acquired a 50.1 per cent stake in the insolvent long-established distribution company Senator Entertainment AG. Thanks to a target-oriented acquisitions and production strategy Weber was able to give the company a new profile.Ed Meza, \\"Senator comes back from the dead\\", Variety, March 29, 2007 In 2007 he showed countable success with the Academy Award-nominated Pan's Labyrinth (287,905 admissions ‚Äì source: German Federal Film Board/GFFB), 1408 (537,334 admissions ‚Äì source: GFFB) and Quentin Tarantino‚Äôs Death Proof (572,906 admissions ‚Äì source: GFFB).

Bourgueil is an appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) for wine in the Loire Valley region, and produces primarily red wine from the grape variety Cabernet Franc, located in the commune of Bourgueil and surrounding communes.

Like other wine regions in the Saumur region, Bourgueil has mostly a continental climate with some maritime influences that are enhanced the further west you go in the AOC. It is situated on the left bank of the Loire River, which provides some climate moderation, to the west of Tours and on the edge of the Maine-et-Loire department.

Bourgueil wine is made from the Cabernet Franc grape variety, which is locally called Cabernet Breton. Up to 10% of the wine can also be made from Cabernet Sauvignon grapes. Limestone soil produces wines with a dusky red hue, whereas those grown in siliceous soil take on a redcurrant shade. Bourgueil wines have a floral and fruity bouquet, which becomes earthy as the wine ages. These wines age splendidly in the bottle, keeping for up to 20 years.

The term combines the notions of 'branding' and 'hijacking', and has been used since at least 2007 when it appeared in Business Week referencing the term used in a publication by the firm MarkMonitor (MarkMonitor and its PR firm, the Zeno Group, coined the phrase; MarkMonitor registered \\"BrandJacking Index\\" as a trademark, but not the term \\"brandjacking\\" on its own). The tactic is often associated with use of individual and corporate identities on social media or Web 2.0 sites, as described in Quentin Langley's 2014 book Brandjack, and may be used alongside more conventional (offline) campaign activities. While similar to cybersquatting, identity theft or phishing in nature and in possible tactics, brandjacking is usually particular to a politician, celebrity or business and more indirect in its nature. A brandjacker may attempt to use the reputation of its target for selfish reasons or seek to damage the reputation of its target for hostile, Waddington, quoting Quentin Langley's Brandjack News, describes brandjacking as \\"the ability for an individual to criticise and publicly shame a company ...

Brandjack author Quentin Langley praised Greenpeace for its integration of online (YouTube, Twitter) and offline (stunts, etc.).Langley (2014), p.185  Brandjacking avoidance  Brandjacking avoidance may include: * Pre-emptive registration of brand names and sub-brands as screen names on social media sites. * Staying vigilant * Use of social media and general media monitoring tools to seek evidence of infringement * Legal action against those seen as responsible for the infringement. However, action against the brandjackers and their supporters can actually draw attention to the problem (the Streisand effect). For example, following Greenpeace's KitKat campaign, Nestl√© had the video removed from YouTube, but Greenpeace quickly re-posted it to video- sharing site Vimeo.com and highlighted the attempted censorship using Twitter and other social media. Attempts by Nestl√© to constrain user activity on its Facebook fan page further fanned the controversy.

It appears to have been first established in 1950, and inherited the heritage of the former 3rd Diponegoro Division and other Central Java infantry units. Diponegoro Division personnel have been very significant in the history of the Indonesian Army. Among its early officers were Sarwo Edhie Wibowo, who served as battalion and regimental commander in the division from 1945-53. Former commanders of the division include Soeharto, a former president of Indonesia. Divisional personnel, including Lieutenant Colonel Untung Syamsuri, were involved in the 30 September Movement events of 1965. Former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was also member of this KODAM when he took command of KOREM 072/Pamungkas at Yogyakarta during his military tenure. As of 1965, the Diponegoro Division had three infantry brigades, the 4th/Dewa Ratna, 5th/Lukitasari, and 6th/Tri Shakti Balajaya.

The eleventh tropical cyclone and eight named storm of the 1980 Atlantic hurricane season, Hermine developed from a tropical wave that emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on September 11. After uneventfully crossing the Atlantic Ocean, the system developed a well-defined circulation while in the Caribbean Sea on September 20 and was then classified as a tropical depression. After becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression steadily strengthened as it tracked nearly due westward. By September 21, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Hermine and brushed the northern coast of Honduras shortly thereafter. It nearly became a hurricane before it made landfall in Belize on September 22. After weakening over the Yucatan Peninsula, Hermine restrengthened to near-hurricane status again over the Gulf of Mexico before making landfall in the Mexican state of Veracruz. Hermine steadily weakened inland and eventually dissipated on September 26. In Belize, the storm knocked out communications, though damage in that country was minimal. Heavy rainfall in Guatemala triggered landslides, causing eight fatalities. Additionally, portions of the Pan-American Highway were shut down due to flooding. In Mexico, many areas reported at least of precipitation, while a few locations experience more than of rain. At the capital city of Mexico City, ten districts reported significant street flooding. As a result of torrential rainfall, at least 30 fatalities occurred, with dozens more missing, and leaving 25,000 homeless. However, no estimates of damage associated with the storm were produced. Meteorological history A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on September 11, though the system lacked a well-defined circulation. The tropical wave tracked westward for several days with minimal development, until reaching near the Lesser Antilles where a low-level cloud banding feature appeared, along with an increase in central convection. This suggested a possible low-level circulation, though an Air Force Reserve Flight on September 17 indicated little evidence of a circulation. On the following day, the system crossed the Lesser Antilles and entered the Caribbean Sea. As it passed near Jamaica on September 20, a low-level circulation became more apparent on satellite imagery. It is estimated that Tropical Depression Eleven developed at 1200 UTC on that day, while it was centered about 240 miles (385 km) south of Kingston, Jamaica. However, the National Hurricane Center did not initiate advisories until 2200 UTC on September 20. The depression tracked just north of due west, and by September 21, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Hermine. Later on September 21, Hermine passed only 5 miles (8 km) offshore of northeast Honduras. An Air Force Reserve flight investigated if landfall occurred, though Hermine had remained offshore. After the storm moved to the northwest away from Honduras, it began to significantly strengthen. By September 22, maximum sustained winds had increased to 70 mph (110 km/h). Shortly thereafter, Hermine made landfall near Belize City at the same intensity. The storm weakened somewhat over the Yucat√°n Peninsula, and sustained winds were 50 mph (80 km/h) when Hermine emerged into the Bay of Campeche on September 23. The storm quickly began to re-strengthen as it tracked generally westward in the Gulf of Mexico. Although several computer models suggested a northward turn, Hermine drifted southwestward, possibly due to high terrain over Mexico. Hermine attained its peak intensity with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) and a minimum pressure of early on September 24, as measured by reconnaissance aircraft. After peak intensity, Hermine weakened slightly to a 65 mph (105 km/h) tropical storm. At 1200 UTC on September 24, the storm made landfall near Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, Mexico. Hermine steadily weakened inland and by late 1500 UTC on September 25, it was downgraded to a tropical depression. Later that day, the National Hurricane Center noted that a low-level circulation could no longer be located, and by early on the following day, Hermine dissipated over the Mexican state of Oaxaca. Impact Rainfall from Tropical Storm Hermine On September 21, the government of Belize issued a gale warning, as well as a hurricane watch, for most of the eastern coast of the country. It was canceled after Tropical Storm Hermine had moved inland. In eastern Mexico, an estimated 15,000 people evacuated from low-lying areas. Additionally, the Government of Mexico sent \\"advices\\" to \\"interests\\" in the Yucatan Peninsula. Officials in Mexico urged numerous residents along the southern Gulf of Mexico coast and surrounding states to evacuate prior to the storm's arrival. Timely warnings were later credited for reducing the loss of life. While crossing the southern Yucat√°n Peninsula, Hermine brought locally heavy rains and strong winds to eastern Mexico and much of Belize ‚Äì then a colony of the United Kingdom. Between of rain fell at the Philip S. W. Goldson International Airport. In Quintana Roo, more than of precipitation fell in localized areas, leading to floods. The storm also temporarily knocked out communication to all of Belize and Chetumal, Mexico. According to officials in the region, little damage took place during Hermine's passage. Heavy rains in Guatemala triggered landslides, killing at least eight people after crushing a bus. Portions of the Pan American Highway were shut down due to debris. Tropical Storm Hermine and the remnants caused heavy rainfall across along most of the southern and eastern parts of Mexico. Rainfall totals from Hermine peaked at in San Pedro Tapanatepec, Oaxaca. When the remnants of Hermine reached the Pacific coast of Mexico, several inches of rain were recorded. Throughout the country, the hardest hit areas were Veracruz, Oaxaca, Chiapas and Guerrero. More than 30 people were killed by the storm and dozens more left missing. Ten districts in Mexico City were brought to a standstill as flood waters blocked off streets. In the small towns of Cintalapa and Jiquiplan, flooding killed eight people and left twenty more missing. In addition to the loss of life, at least 25,000 residents were left homeless due to severe flooding. Two small dams broke due to excessive rains near Tuxtla Guti√©rrez, prompting the evacuation of 2,000 residents in nearby areas. In response to the storm, an estimated 15,000 personnel were deployed to assist in relief efforts.

He made his professional debut in 1967, reaching a highest rank of sekiwake in 1978. He won three special prizes and earned two gold stars. He retired in 1981 and became an elder of the Japan Sumo Association. He was the head coach of the Kataonami stable from 1987 until 2010, when he changed his elder name to Tateyama. He reached 65 years of age in 2014, the normal age of retirement for an elder, but was re-hired for a further five years as a consultant. Career He played basketball in high school. He began his career in May 1967, joining Kataonami stable. However, he ran away from the stable shortly after fighting his first tournament in the lowest jonokuchi division, and joined the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force. After being discharged, he returned to sumo in September 1970, winning two straight tournaments (or y≈´sh≈ç) in the jonokuchi and jonidan division. He reached sekitori status in November 1973 upon promotion to the j≈´ry≈ç division. In September 1974 he reached the top makuuchi division. In January 1978 he scored 11 wins against 4 losses at the rank of komusubi, including wins over all four ≈çzeki. As a result, he was awarded the Fighting Spirit prize and promotion to sekiwake for the following tournament. He held the rank a further five times, and stayed in the san'yaku ranks for eight consecutive tournaments. In September 1979 he defeated the eventual tournament winner, yokozuna Kitanoumi to earn his first kinboshi (he had defeated yokozuna Wajima on two previous occasions but had been ranked in san'yaku so was not eligible for a kinboshi). The victory was remarkable as Tamanofuji had lost every one of his previous 19 matches with Kitanoumi. He was awarded the Outstanding Performance prize. He defeated Kitanoumi again in the next tournament in November 1979, but did not get a kinboshi as he was ranked as a komusubi (he also defeated Wajima for the third time in this tournament, and was awarded his second Fighting Spirit prize). However, he did pick up another kinboshi in November 1980 with a win over Mienoumi. In 1981 he fell back to the j≈´ry≈ç division and he retired in November of that year. Retirement from sumo He became an elder of the Japan Sumo Association under the name Minatogawa. In 1987 he became head of the Kataonami stable following the death of the previous head, his old boss Tamanoumi Daitaro. As Kataonami Oyakata he produced several top division wrestlers including Tamakasuga, Tamanoshima, Tamarikido, Tamaasuka and Tamawashi. In February 2010 he handed over control of the stable to Tamakasuga and adopted the Tateyama name. In February 2012 he joined the board of Directors of the Sumo Association. In November 2014 he reached the Sumo Association's mandatory retirement age of sixty-five. He no longer had full oyakata status, but following a rule change he was rehired by the Sumo Association as a san'yo or consultant for a period of five years with reduced pay, the first example of this happening. The Sumo Association announced in April 2019 that he had left his position, around seven months ahead of schedule. Personal life His wife is the president of a company that trades in marine products. Fighting style Tamanofuji had a steady, unspectacular style, and has been described as a \\"dull and plodding grinder.\\" His most common winning kimarite was yorikiri or force out, followed by hatakikomi, slap down. His favoured grip on his opponent's mawashi was migiyotsu, a left hand outside, right hand inside position.

The grant was located along the north bank of Chico Creek, east of the Sacramento River and encompassed present-day Chico.Dise√±o del Rancho Arroyo Chico History William Dickey, George McKinstry, and John Bidwell, had all worked at one time for John Sutter and were also partners in various mining ventures. George W. McKinstry, Jr. (1810 ‚Äì 1882) came to California in 1846, and worked for John Sutter as clerk, sheriff of Northern California District, and assisted in the rescue of the Donner Party. In 1858, McKinstry moved to San Diego and practised as a physician there until his death. Dickey wanted to return to his eastern home, and sold Rancho Arroyo Chico to George McKinstry in 1849. Bidwell acquired Rancho Arroyo Chico in two separate purchases in 1849 and 1851. In 1849, George McKinstry sold an undivided half of Rancho Arroyo Chico to Bidwell. In 1850 George McKinstry sold the other half interest to Justus McKinstry;John K.

In 1848, John Bidwell discovered gold in Feather River, at a place now call Bidwells Bar. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored.

Thus, the efflux of (most constituents of) semen is not possible. It can be congenital or acquired. It is a cause of male infertility and/or pelvic pain. Ejaculatory duct obstruction must not be confused with an obstruction of the vas deferens. Cause  If both ejaculatory ducts are completely obstructed, affected men will demonstrate male infertility due to aspermia/azoospermia. They will suffer from a very low volume of semen which lacks the gel-like fluid of the seminal vesicles or from no semen at all while they are able to have the sensation of an orgasm during which they will have involuntary contractions of the pelvic musculature. This is contrary to some other forms of anejaculation. In addition, it is reported to be a cause for pelvic pain, especially shortly after ejaculation. In case of proven fertility but unresolved pelvic pain, even one or both partially obstructed ejaculatory ducts may be the origin of pelvic pain and oligospermia. Ejaculatory duct obstruction may result in a complete lack of semen (aspermia) or a very low-volume semen (oligospermia) which may contain only the secretion of accessory prostate glands downstream to the orifice of the ejaculatory ducts. In addition to the congenital form which is often caused by cysts of the m√ºllerian duct the obstruction can be acquired due to an inflammation caused by chlamydia, prostatitis, tuberculosis of the prostate and other pathogens. In addition, calculus was reported to mechanically block the ejaculatory duct, leading to infertility. However, in many patients, there is no history of an inflammation and the underlying cause simply remains unknown. Prevalence Ejaculatory duct obstruction is the underlying cause for 1‚Äì5% of male infertility. Since ejaculatory duct obstruction is a relatively rare cause of infertility, this possibility may be unfamiliar to some physicians, even some urologists. Diagnosis Low-volume, runny/fluid semen (oligospermia) or no semen at all (dry ejaculation/aspermia) are a logical consequence of an obstruction downstream of the seminal vesicles which contribute most to the volume of the semen. Usually, men will be able to observe a runny/fluid, low-volume semen by themselves during masturbation. Since the seminal vesicles contain a viscous, alkaline fluid rich in fructose, a chemical analysis of the semen of affected men will result in a low concentration of fructose and a low pH. A microscopic semen analysis will reveal aspermia/azoospermia. In contrast, if both vasa deferentia are obstructed (which may be the result of intended sterilization), a semen analysis will also reveal aspermia/azoospermia, but an almost normal volume of the semen, since the efflux of the seminal vesicles is not hindered. This is because approx. 80% of the volume of the semen is the gel-like fluid originating from the seminal vesicles whereas the fraction from the testicles / epididymis, which contains the spermatozoa accounts for only 5‚Äì10% of the volume of the semen. In addition, if an obstruction of the vasa deferentia is the cause for the azoospermia, the concentration of fructose in the semen will also be normal, since the fructose comes primarily from the fluid stored in the seminal vesicles. If the seminal-vesicles contain spermatozoa, but the semen does not, the obstruction must be downstream of the seminal vesicles and the ejaculatory ducts are very likely to be obstructed, provided that other causes for a dry ejaculation/aspermia such as a retrograde ejaculation are ruled out. Attempts are sometimes made to diagnose an ejaculatory duct obstruction by means of medical imaging, e.g. transrectal ultrasound or MRI, or by transrectal needle-aspiration of the seminal vesicles. However transrectal ultrasound has a relatively low sensitivity of approx. 50% and thus is only a tool to rule-out cysts in the region of the orifices but is not sufficient to rule out an obstruction of the ejaculatory ducts due to other causes. In approx. 50% of cases of unexplained low-volume azoospermia MRI and TRUS do not reveal any pathological findings, because it is difficult to see alterations in a narrowed, scarred duct with these methods. Due to the blockage of ejaculatory ducts, enlarged seminal vesicles are frequently seen in patients with ejaculatory duct obstructions. However, this is again neither a proof of an obstruction nor do normal-sized seminal vesicles rule-out an obstruction of the ejaculatory ducts. Treatment A method to treat ejaculatory duct obstruction is transurethral resection of the ejaculatory ducts (TURED). This operative procedure is relatively invasive, has some severe complications, and has led to natural pregnancies of their partners in approximately 20% of affected men. A disadvantage is the destruction of the valves at the openings of the ejaculatory ducts into the urethra such that urine may flow backwards into the seminal vesicles. Another, experimental approach is the recanalization of the ejaculatory ducts by transrectal or transurethral inserted balloon catheter. Though much less invasive and preserving the anatomy of the ejaculatory ducts, this procedure is probably not completely free of complications either and success rates are unknown. There is a clinical study currently ongoing to examine the success rate of recanalization of the ejaculatory ducts by means of balloon dilation.UK-SH Universit√§tsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein Usually, affected men have a normal production of spermatozoa in their testicles, so that after spermatozoa were harvested directly from the testes e.g. by TESE, or the seminal vesicles (by needle aspiration) they and their partners are potentially candidates for some treatment options of assisted reproduction e.g. in-vitro fertilisation. Note that in this case, most of the treatment (e.g. ovarian stimulation and transvaginal oocyte retrieval) is transferred to the female partner.

Origins and objectives The Pan American Association of Anatomy (PAA) was created in July 1966 in Mexico City at the 1st Pan American Congress of Anatomy, which was held together with the 3rd National Congress of the Mexican Society of Anatomy.Official Web Mexican Society of Anatomy Its mentor was the Prof. Dr. Liberato J. A. Didio. The need for a Pan American Association of Anatomy was proposed by Prof. Di Dio during the 74th meeting of the American Association of Anatomy held in Chicago, USA, in March 1961. Its objectives include stimulating the development and improvement of teaching and research of morphological sciences on the American continent, facilitating scientific exchange in all its aspects. Since then and through its meetings, it has spread and updated progress of morphological sciences on the American continent. Organizational structure The PAA is a member of the International Federation of Associations of Anatomists (IFAA).Official Web IFAA The Government of the Pan American Association of Anatomy consists on the General Assembly (performed with partners in the Congress), the Board of Directors (composed by advisers or delegates from each country) and the Executive Committee (headed by the President, who is elected by the General Assembly). There are two counselors or delegates for each American country concerned; one as owner and another alternate. When the mandate of the President of the Executive Committee is finished, he is named Honorary President of the Association and he automatically joins the Honorary Presidents Committee of the PAA, which works with the Executive Committee. The headquarters of the congresses vary from one congress to another, but they are always within the Americas and in a rotative form. The designation of the host country is resolved at the General Assembly by a vote of its partners and it is usually held every 3 years. Since 2013, the Association Executive Committee has been chaired by Prof. Dr. Manuel Arteaga Mart√≠nez, from Mexico (2013‚Äì2017). The next Pan-American Congress of Anatomy will be held in Peru, 2017; its President is Prof. Dr. Germ√°n Molina Albornoz, from Peru. The statutes of the Association and the Pan American Congress of Anatomy, adopted by majority vote by the General Assembly of the Association, can be found on the.PAA website Pan American Congress In 50 years of Association life, 18 congresses have been held, with an interval of 3 years (sometimes 2 years) between them. The following countries have hosted at least one congress: Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, Chile, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, USA and Venezuela. The Congress covers various topics of morphological sciences and related sciences that have application to the biology and health sciences, especially in medicine and dentistry. It involves research, teaching and medical care. In particular, issues related to development anatomy (embryology), microscopic anatomy (histology and Citology), human anatomy, veterinary anatomy, comparative anatomy, neuroanatomy, neurobiology, radiological anatomy, clinical anatomy, anthropology, biophysics and biochemistry, etc. are discussed. Symposia Iberian-Latin-American In 2009, during the 43rd anniversary of the Pan American Association of Anatomy, the 1st Iberian-Latin-American Terminology Symposium (SILAT) was held, with the purpose of disseminating the International Morphological Terminology. Educational institutions of medical and other health areas which spoke Spanish and Portuguese used it on a daily basis. Its mentor was Prof. Dr. Rolando Cruz Guti√©rrez. Up today, there have been sixteen symposia: four in Costa Rica, two in Brasil, three in Mexico, four in Chile, two in Peru and one in Nicaragua. In these symposia, participants are divided into groups to work with the anatomical, histological and embryological terminology from the Terminology Committee (FICAT) of the International Federation of Associations of Anatomists (IFAA). Meetings are held every day. The symposia also develops the presentation of free papers concerning different aspects and considerations of terminology. These groups of experts review, analyse and discuss the morphological terms; possible errors and defects in the studied structures are also discussed. It was determined that the future meetings are planned in other countries (such as Honduras, Ecuador, Argentina, etc.). Official publications The PAA has the support of various magazines, which are the official organ of publication, showing summaries of scientific congresses communications and other aspects. They are: International Journal of Morphology (Revista Internacional de Morfolog√≠a), Brazilian Journal of Morphology Sciences, Venezuelan Magazine of Morphological Sciences and Medical Journal of Costa Rica and Central America.

It was painted by Luna when he was a student of the school of painting in the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando (Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando) in Madrid, Spain in 1877. Alejo Valera, a Spanish painting teacher, took Luna as an apprentice and brought him to Rome where Luna created Las Damas Romanas in 1882. Luna spent six years in Rome from 1878 to 1884.Ocampo, Ambeth (columnist). Lost Luna found in Paris to be sold, Philippine Daily Inquirer, November 23, 2008, inquirer.net Historical overview Las Damas Romanas is one of the early works of Luna as a painter that resurfaced in the past quarter of a century after being thought lost or missing.Lost Luna work found, rogueclassicism, atrium-media.com Before its reappearance in Paris many years before 2008, it had been documented only as a title and as a listed work of Luna in the 1957 biography of Luna written by Carlos E. Da Silva. The painting had also been documented through a black and white photograph from the files of Alfonso T. Ongpin, a historian and pre-war art dealer. In 1980, the image from Ongpin was reprinted by Santiago Pilar in the book \\"Juan Luna: The Filipino As Painter\\". Description The concept for the 100 cm x 170 cm size painting was based by Luna on ancient Roman history. It depicted a domestic scene in ancient Roman life, portraying two women lying on the steps of a house. The hand of one woman was holding the reins of two pet dogs or hunting dogs, in order to prevent them from scaring away some doves. The doves symbolized divinity The background of the painting presented a shelf of artifacts. To the left of the shelf was a shrine with a pediment shaped like a triangle. In front of the pediment was a burner with a smoking incense. There are three major elements of Las Damas Romanas, namely the women, the dogs, and the doves. Roman life involved having dogs because they were employed by the ancient Romans for hunting activities, guardians of the home and their property, and as pets. In Luna's painting, the leashed pet dogs were acting as companions of women. Doves, on the other hand, were animals that connote eroticism. In relation to one of the women, there was a suggestion that the woman on the right with dark hair could be Maria de la Paz Pardo de Tavera. The notion was discarded because Luna was unmarried when he painted Las Damas Romanas. Luna finished Las Damas Romanas after winning a silver medal for The Death of Cleopatra painting in 1881 and before obtaining a gold medal for the masterpiece Spoliarium in 1884 (both were presented during the Madrid Exposition during the years mentioned).Ocampo, Ambeth R.

The band consists of Alex Levine (vocals, bass), Ryan Levine (guitar, vocals), Matt Elkin (guitar, vocals) and Zach Staggers (drums, vocals). They have toured the U.S. and Europe extensively on their own and have supported a wide range of acts (seen most touring with The Front Bottoms). They are also recognized for their active participation in the all-ages music venues of New York City and the DIY movement in general. History Brothers Alex and Ryan Levine are originally from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, as well as Zach Staggers whom Ryan met in pre-school. Through divorces and remarriages, Zach became their step-brother and they began playing music at a very early age. Singer/bassist Alex Levine was born with the rare metabolic disorder homocystinuria and lacks the proper enzyme to digest protein, which has affected his dietary habits nearly his entire life. Over the course of their childhood, the three brothers moved around the New York metropolitan area quite frequently always playing music together under different monikers. They adopted their current name in 2007 and self-released their eponymous debut that same year. The album was recorded in a series of after-hour sessions at a Staten Island studio with childhood friend and producer Adam Reich. Guitarist Matt Elkin joined the band in October 2007 shortly before their first cross-country tour. Upon returning to New York, they co-founded an all-ages venue in Brooklyn named The Market Hotel with DIY show promoter Todd P. The band helped construct The Market Hotel in spring 2008 and formerly resided there in between touring. The So So Glos released their Tourism/Terrorism LP in fall 2008 through Warner subsidiary Green Owl Records. The album received an A- from Robert Christgau and won the \\"Best Punk Album\\" category of the 9th Annual Independent Music Awards. After several D.I.Y. tours of the U.S. in support of the album, the band toured Europe as an opening act for ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead. During the summer of 2009, along with producer Adam Reich, the band established an all-ages performance space/recording studio in Brooklyn called Shea Stadium. Their 7-inch EP Low Back Chain Shift was released in fall 2010, and they promoted it on the road in North America with Matt & Kim and the Futureheads. The band's second full-length studio album, Blowout, was released independently on April 23, 2013 via their own Shea Stadium Records. Their most acclaimed release yet, Blowout received inclusions on the Top 50 Albums of 2013 lists for Rolling Stone and Consequence of Sound. The band toured in support of the album over the subsequent year with Titus Andronicus, Desaparecidos, Diarrhea Planet, and Say Anything. They opened for Stiff Little Fingers and The Hold Steady on their U.K. & European tour in October 2016. The So So Glos released their latest and third full-length studio album Kamikaze on May 20, 2016. The album was released by their record label, Shea Stadium Records, and Votiv, and was met with a positive reception from critics.

The Council expressed its determination to eliminate international terrorism and that those responsible for acts of terrorism would be brought to justice. In the context that the suppression of these acts is essential for international peace and security, it was noted that Libya had refused to comply with previous Security Council resolutions and its renunciation of terrorism, which the Council determined to be a threat to international peace and security. At the same time, letters from representatives of Libya in which it stated its intention to encourage those accused of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland and the bombing of UTA Flight 772 over Chad and Niger to co-operate with the concerned authorities was noted. Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council demanded that Libya comply with resolutions 731 and 748. To ensure the Libyan government's compliance with the aforementioned resolutions, the following measures would take effect as of 00:01 EST on 1 December 1993. Firstly, all countries were required to freeze Libyan funds or other financial resources in their territory, though this would not apply to funds or other financial resources derived from the sale or supply of petroleum and petroleum products, natural gas and gas products and agricultural products. Furthermore, sales, marketing or licensing of the following were prohibited: :(a) large pumps and motors used for transporting oil and gas; :(b) equipment for oil terminals; :(c) large pumps that could be used for oil transport; :(d) refining equipment; :(e) spare parts for any of the above. The Council also decided that, to make the provisions of Resolution 748 effective, all countries should: :(a) close offices of Libyan Arab Airlines; :(b) prohibit commercial transactions, including tickets, with Libyan Arab Airlines; :(c) prohibit aircraft or accessories available for service, and maintenance or servicing of aircraft in Libya; :(d) prohibit the supply of construction materials, improvement or maintenance of Libyan airports; :(e) prohibit advice, assistance or training to Libyan pilots, flight engineers or maintenance personnel; :(f) prohibit any renewal of insurance for Libyan aircraft :(g) continue to significantly reduce staff at Libyan diplomatic missions and consular posts. The Committee established by the Security Council in Resolution 748 was instructed to draw up guidelines for the implementation of the above measures and to deal with requests for assistance under Article 50 of the United Nations Charter for countries that suffered indirectly as a result of the sanctions. All states and international organisations were urged to co-operate with the provisions of the current resolution and to report to the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali on measures they had taken to implement the resolution. At the same time, Libya was urged to co-operate, while the Council affirmed that the present resolution did not affect its Libya's duty to adhere to all of its obligations concerning servicing and repayment of foreign debt. Measures taken by the Council would be reviewed after noting co-operation by Libya with regard to the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 and UTA Flight 772. Resolution 883 was adopted by 11 votes to none, with four abstentions from China, Djibouti, Morocco and Pakistan. Russia had previously threatened to veto the resolution, but after negotiations supported the provisions after stating its intention to recover the debt owed to it by Libya over purchases of weapons. Libya responded by closing its borders with Tunisia and Egypt for three days, denouncing the resolution as a product of hostile policy from the United Nations and affirming the need to seek a resolution to the crisis as soon as possible.

Levin (September 8, 1921 ‚Äì March 20, 1996https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0505616/) was an American film producer and business executive with the National General Corporation. He was also the owner of the National Basketball Association's Boston Celtics and San Diego Clippers. Levin began his film career as the president of Filmmakers Releasing Organization, a film distribution company founded by independent producers Collier Young and Ida Lupino. When American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, Inc. decided to expand to film production in 1956, Levin was named the first president of the Am-Par Picture Corporation. AB-PT sold Levin and Harry L. Mandell AB-PT Pictures and AB-PT Distribution Corporation in May 1958 and reformed the company as Atlas Pictures Corporation. Levin and Mandell then brought on Maurice Duke and Henry F. Ehrlich to form a TV production company, Sindee Productions Inc. with its first series Pancho Villa through distributor MCA. In 1961, Levin joined National Theaters & Television, Inc. as a vice president. In 1962 Eugene V. Klein restructured the company into National General Corp., where Levin served as the executive vice president from 1962‚Äì1969 and president and CEO from 1969‚Äì1972. Levin was also president of NGC's entertainment assets, which included National General Pictures and The Chinese Theatre. In April 1972, Levin and attorney Harold A. Lipton purchased the Boston Celtics for $3.7 Million. The sale was rejected by the NBA as a result of conflict of interest concerns due to fellow National General directors Sam Schulman and Eugene V. Klein owning the Seattle SuperSonics. Levin and Lipton were forced to sell their shares to Robert Schmertz that May for $3.95 Million with an option for the two to repurchase half of the Celtics' stock. After two years of litigation, Levin and Lipton were able exercise their option. Ten months later they purchased the remaining stock from Leisure Technology. In 1978, Levin and Lipton swapped their shares in the Celtics with John Y. Brown, Jr. and Harry T. Mangurian, Jr. for their shares in the Buffalo Braves. The Braves were relocated to San Diego, where they became the San Diego Clippers. On May 4, 1981, Levin sold the Clippers to Donald Sterling for $13.5 million.

The asd motif was detected by bioinformatics and an individual asd RNA in Streptococcus pyogenes was detected by microarray and northern hybridization experiments as a 170-nucleotide molecule called \\"SR914400\\". The transcription start site determined for SR914400 corresponds to the 5‚Ä≤-end of the molecule shown in the consensus diagram. Some asd RNAs are associated with genes, such as asd, that are suggestive of a cis-regulatory function. However, several lines of evidence suggest that this is not the biological role of asd RNAs. First, in some cases, the asd RNA is not in the 5' untranslated region of any annotated gene. Second, in Streptococcus mutans, there is a strong promoter immediately downstream of the transcription terminator that follows the asd RNA, and this promoter precedes the downstream gene. This arrangement suggests that asd RNA transcription is terminated, and the gene is transcribed from the downstream promoter. Finally, although the asd gene encodes an enzyme, aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, that participates in the synthesis of methionine, lysine and threonine, transcription levels of the asd gene remain constant even when the concentrations of these amino acids are varied. The sRNA was shown to interact with the 5'UTR of the mga transcript (the multiple virulence gene regulator gene) and was renamed MarS for mag- activating regulatory sRNA. In MarS deletion strains expression of mga and several Mga-activated genes is reduced. This down-regulation of virulence factors leads to increased susceptibility of the deletion strain to phagocytosis, reduced adherence to human keratinocytes. However, the lack of MarS increased bacterial dissemination and tolerance towards oxidative stress.

Eddie Lee Sexton was captured after living as a fugitive for over a year to avoid child abuse charges. He was sentenced to death for orchestrating the murder of his son-in-law, Joel, by holding a gun to his own son's head, Willie and telling him to strangle Joel. Sexton was also given an additional 15 years for conspiracy to commit kidnapping and murder of an acquaintance. After appeal, Sexton's death penalty case was overturned and a new trial ordered. After retrial he was again found guilty and sentenced to death, but died in prison of natural causes. Biography=Early life Eddie Lee Sexton was born near rural Logan, West Virginia to a family of coal miners. His father was a part-time Baptist preacher. In 1963, he committed armed robbery of a gas station the day after marrying his pregnant 15-year-old girlfriend. He was sentenced to five years in state prison for the robbery, and his wife filed for divorce after giving birth to a son, Patrick. Eddie later married Estella May, and they would have twelve children. Eddie and Estella settled in Stark County, Ohio. Eddie was regarded as charming and polite upon first impression, but those who knew him well saw him as a serial con artist and fraudster. Though receiving Social Security disability payments due to his allegedly seriously injured back, he also worked for cash as a painter and handyman. He was suspected of insurance fraud by setting three fires at his homes in the 1980s and faking burglaries and falsely reporting stolen items.Cauffiel (1997), p. 267 In the 1970s he briefly worked as an independent Christian preacher, espousing a highly unorthodox doctrine emphasizing sex and apocalyptic predictions that he would later use to indoctrinate and intimidate his children. Journalist Lowell Cauffiel wrote: \\"Eddie Lee Sexton certainly maintained his own place of worship. But nobody could figure out what gospel he was preaching. A little general occult. A little fundamentalism. A little Satanism. A little sci-fi hustle...\\" Cauffiel (1997), p 263 Neighbor Augusta Houston would report that Eddie claimed to worship both God and the Devil. Abuse and investigations The Sexton children would later describe Eddie and Estella as committing extreme acts of abuse almost daily. All the children were sexually abused by both parents, were beaten and locked in their rooms for minor infractions, and routinely suffered other indignities. The Sexton children attended public schools, and while Eddie allowed them to have only one friend each they were not allowed to visit friends' homes and friends were not allowed in the Sexton home. The Sexton children believed their father had supernatural powers, such as telepathy and the ability to summon ghosts or spirits. Subsequent to the abuse, many of the children became sexually reactive with or sexually abusive toward one another. Eddie staged mock wedding ceremonies with several of his daughters as preludes to his raping themCauffiel (1997), p. 197 (photos of these weddings are printed in Cauffiel's book House of Secrets, with Eddie's daughters wearing bridal veils in their family living room). His children would later report Eddie conducting such events as a seance-like ceremony involving a dead cat,Cauffiel (1997), p. 268 and forcing the children to sign contracts in their own blood stating they would go to hell for disobeying him. Eddie impregnated his teenage daughter Estella (known as \\"Pixie\\" to distinguish daughter from mother who shared the same name). He encouraged her to find a boyfriend to avert suspicion from himself. Pixie met Joel Good, a high school classmate who was described as slow-witted and overly trusting.Cauffiel (1997), pp. 25-30 They had an on-off romance, eventually marrying despite the reservations of Joel's family about his marrying a young woman with two young girls, Dawn and Shasta, of uncertain parentage. After the wedding, Pixie gave birth to a boy they named Skipper Lee Good.Cauffiel (1997) The Sexton household was long suspected of being abusive and neglectful towards their children, with county officials maintaining a file on the family from 1979 but lacking evidence enough for further action. In early 1992, his daughter Machelle, then 18 years old, informed employees at a women's shelter that her father had raped her. At the time of Machelle's allegation, six of the Sexton children were minors and authorities launched an investigation. Three of the young children reported nothing unusual, but three others reported physical abuse from their parents. These three children were removed from the home and assigned to foster families pending further investigation. Machelle retracted her allegations, complicating the case. Eddie filmed a three-hour video on VHS tape, denying the charges against him and claiming he was the victim of persecution of his brother Otis who had cooperated with authorities, and Stark County authorities who held a grudge against him.Cauffiel (1997), p. 176 To plead his case, Eddie mailed copies of the video directly to President Bill Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno. Fugitives After seven months with her foster family, young Lana Sexton confided to her foster parents that her birth mother Estella had sexually abused her. This disclosure was confirmed by a medical exam that found vaginal scarring consistent with her story. Stark County authorities moved to take custody of all the minor Sexton children. Eddie and Estella responded first with a flurry of legal motions designed to slow the court process, and by attempting to prove Native American ancestry in an attempt to shift the criminal case to a tribal court. When these steps were ineffective in avoiding court action against them, the Sextons went on the run. Along with Eddie and Estella, they traveled with three of their minor children, several adult children including Joel and Pixie, and Pixie's three young children. In total, eleven people lived in a cramped van as they roamed the country. They first lived in Oklahoma with Eddie's relatives for several months, before relocating to campsites at Little Manatee River State Park on the western coast of Florida. Eddie forced the children to engage in paramilitary drills in anticipation of a showdown with law enforcement, and the Sexton children began drinking heavily and inhaling gasoline fumes. Eddie drove back to Ohio every two weeks to cash his disability checks. Ohio courts issued arrest warrants, but the case had a relatively low priority and was not initially well- publicized due to family court rules to protect the anonymity of child abuse victims. Late on October 19, 1993 or early the morning of the 20th, Pixie smothered her son Skipper to death. The child had been ill and Eddie refused to allow a doctor visit, and Pixie later claimed that her father ordered her to silence the crying child to avoid drawing attention at the camp site, where the family lived in violation of the occupancy and time-limit rules. Pixie carried the corpse with her for several days, believing her father had the power to resurrect the child. They eventually buried the boy in a peat bog near the camp site. Pixie told Joel the boy died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), but Joel was suspicious. On November 30, 1993, Joel and Pixie visited the library at the University of Tampa, where librarian Gail Novak assisted him in finding information about SIDS. Eddie entered the library, furious that Joel and Pixie had visited without his permission. Novak would later testify that she saw Eddie assault Joel and Pixie in the library, and that she overheard an argument between father and daughter. When Pixie said that Joel was heartbroken over Skipper's death and wanted to go back to Ohio, Eddie replied that the only way Joel would return to Ohio was as a corpse. Novak reported the incident to campus police, who dismissed it as a prank or joke. At Little Manatee State Park, the Sextons made the acquaintance of Ray Hesser, who had recently retired after selling his business and was traveling cross-country by himself in a luxurious motor home. Eddie and his children began a scheme to use Pixie to seduce Hesser, hoping to eventually kill the man, drain his bank accounts and steal his vehicle.Cauffiel (1997), p 278 Initially friendly towards the Sextons, Hesser gradually grew suspicious and parted ways with them by lying about his travel plans specifically to avoid them. Eddie trained his hulking adult son Willie to use a garotte in preparation for murdering Joel. Willie strangled 24-year-old Joel to death sometime between Thanksgiving and Christmas 1993. They buried Joel's body in the swamp not far from Skipper's grave. Arrest and trials Eventually, the FBI issued a national arrest warrant for Eddie and Estella Sexton for Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution They were arrested in Florida on January 14, 1994 after authorities traced them by a Florida zip code on one of Sexton's self-produced videocassettes that had been mailed to Janet Reno. The minor children were taken into custody while the adult Sexton children were released. Investigation and questioning would reveal that there were other crimes involved, beyond the child abuse warrants for Eddie and Estella. Pixie's daughters Dawn and Shasta both showed signs of repeated sexual abuse, and Dawn identified Willie and Scott Sexton as her abusers. Interviews uncovered the death of Skipper, which was first blamed on SIDS though eventually Pixie took responsibility for the death. The Sextons all initially insisted that Joel had departed for Ohio, but eventually Willie confessed to killing him at Eddie's command. Authorities found Skipper and Joel's bodies where they had been buried and unintentionally preserved in unusually good condition in the peat, similar to the bog bodies of northern Europe. The investigation was exceptionally complex, headquartered in Hillsborough County, Florida but spanning several states and multiple jurisdictions. Sexton's children were difficult to interview, giving evasive and contradictory answers and all displaying major psychiatric problems like psychotic breaks, PTSD and vivid nightmares about their father.Cauffiel (1997), p. 194 Machelle agreed to testify against her father, saying that she retracted her confession out of fear but felt comfortable testifying now that he was in custody. His adult daughter Sherri Crotto reported that he had impregnated her several years before doing the same to Pixie, and that her son was adopted by relatives. DNA testing confirmed with 99% likelihood that Eddie was the father of Pixie's daughters Dawn and Shasta. Authorities suspected Eddie may have also fathered Skipper, but opted against DNA testing for the sake of Joel's family:Cauffiel (1997), p. 258 Joel was consistently reported to have adored and doted on Skipper and the two were buried in the same casket. Eventually, investigators came to believe that Eddie was the mastermind of the entire Sexton family. In February 1994 Pixie was charged with first degree murder for killing Skipper.Orlando Sentinel. Ohio Woman Faces Charge In Baby's Death In Florida, Feb 20, 1994; accessed 12 September 2017 However, she was later allowed to plead guilty to manslaughter for Skipper's death, in exchange for testimony against her father. Adult son Scott agreed to testify against Eddie regarding the Hesser murder plot, while Willie agreed to testify regarding the murder of Joel Good. Willie was found to have a borderline mentally handicapped IQ and was functionally illiterate.Cauffiel (1997), p. 281 He was further judged unfit to stand trial due to serious psychiatric problems, and was ordered to a mental health facility for treatment. His condition was stabilized, and Willie eventually testified. The first trial was for the murder plot against Ray Hesser. Eddie eventually accepted a plea bargain, and was sentenced to 15 years for conspiracy to commit kidnapping and murder. The next trial was for the murder of Joel Good. Prosecutor Jay Pruner stated in court: ‚ÄúEach of [Eddie's] children represented a key that would unlock a door to a different secret [...] To keep those family secrets sacred, Eddie Lee Sexton exercised complete domination and control over every member of his family.‚ÄùEd Balint (2017) Estella Sexton, wife of Eddie Lee Sexton Sr., dies during prison term TimesReporter.com, 20 October 2017; accessed 29 November 2017 Willie testified that Eddie had ordered Joel killed due to fears that he would return to Ohio and report Skipper's death and the Sexton family whereabouts to authorities. Defense attorneys noted the many contradictions and inconsistencies in the Sexton children's testimony and depositions and attempted to cast Willie and Pixie as the murderers, asserting that Eddie was not involved and did not approve of the crime. Rick Terrana objected to the information about Eddie's prior bad acts being heard in court. Judge Bob Mitcham ruled that such testimony would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, but ended up allowing most testimony of Eddie's abusive and manipulative behavior.Cauffiel (1997), p. 287 Judge Mitcham's memoir described Eddie as \\"look[ing] continually relaxed and in control throughout the trial.\\"Bob Anderson Mitcham (2005). Justice from Buttermilk Bottom, International Legal Press, p. 174 Eddie was found guilty after less than three hours deliberation, and was sentenced to death on November 2, 1994. Jurors later said that librarian Gail Novak's testimony was the most important evidence presented at the trial.Cauffiel (1997), p. 289 While the Sextons came across as mentally disturbed and their stories were often inconsistent, contradictory and incomplete, Novak's account provided jurors with critical independent corroboration of the most salient details of the prosecution case. Pixie was sentenced to six years for manslaughter. Willie plead guilty to second degree murder, and was sentenced to 25 years, with his low intelligence and overbearing father taken as mitigating factors. In the Ohio courts, Estella May was sentenced to two years in prison for abusing Lana;Cauffiel (1997), p. 266 during a second trial for over a dozen abuse charges against other children, she was sentenced to life in prison for accessory to rape.Cauffiel (1997), p. 300 On appeal in 1997, Eddie Lee Sexton's verdict was overturned and a new trial was ordered. The appellate judges agreed with defense attorneys that some of the prior bad acts evidence regarding the child abuse and other lurid details of the family history were prejudicial and inflammatory. After the retrial Eddie was again found guilty. During the sentencing phase, a psychologist testified for the defense that Eddie \\"had a diminished level of self-control due to dysfunction in his prefrontal cortex\\".Michael Freeman (2010). Law and Neuroscience: Current Legal Issues. Oxford University Press, p.16 The court rejected this line of reasoning, noting that Eddie's crimes shows considerable planning and concealment over many years thus demonstrating he possessed self-control.

The shrine in northwestern Spain rose to prominence following the Battle of Covadonga in about 720, which was the first defeat of the Moors during their invasion of Spain. A statue of the Virgin Mary, hidden in one of the caves, was believed to have miraculously aided the Christian victory. Our Lady of Covadonga/Cuadonga is the co-patron of Asturias, and a basilica was built to house the current statue. Her feast day is 8 September, as it is also the autonomic day of Asturias.http://www.traditioninaction.org/SOD/j225sd_OLCovadonga_9-07.html  History  Covadonga/Cuadonga is a mountainous region in the province of Asturias in the extreme north west of Spain. Following the Islamic Arab invasion of Spain in 711, Roderic, the Christian Visigoth King of Spain was defeated and killed at the Battle of Guadalete. The battle was decisive and led to the swift conquest of most of Visigothic Spain. The remnant of the Visigoth nobility retreated to the remote mountains of northern Spain. According to texts written in northern Iberia during the ninth century, they elected in 718 a man named Pelayo, or Pelagius, as their leader. Pelayo's father had been a dignitary at the court of the Visigoth King Egica. Pelayo gathered a band of warriors to resist Islamic encroachment. When in 722 the Arab commander of Spain sent an army to eliminate this resistance, the Christian army made its stand at a place of many caves known as Covadonga. According to tradition Pelayo retreated to a cave where a hermit had secreted a statue of the Virgin Mary, saved from the Muslim conquest. He prayed to the virgin for victory. In the subsequent battle the Christians made use of the natural defences. The moorish commander fell in the battle, and his soldiers fled. This victory, considered the first of the Christian reconquista of Spain, established the independence of the Kingdom of Asturias in north west Spain.  The Shrine  Pelayo credited the intercession of the Virgin Mary for his victory. And in recognition of this miraculous intercession, King Alfonso I, the Catholic (739-757) commanded that a monastery and chapel be built on the site in honor of Our Lady of Covadonga. The sanctuary came to be run by Augustinian canons but was destroyed by fire on 17 October 1777. The shrine was rebuilt piecemeal, until replaced by a great Basilica that was consecrated in 1901. The basilica houses the current statue of Our Lady of Covadonga, dating to the 16th century. Pope John Paul II visited the shrine during his papacy.

False scorpionfish are distributed throughout the Indo-West Pacific, bounded by the Ryukyu Islands of Japan to the north and Australia to the south, the Nicobar Islands to the west and New Guinea to the east. Description False scorpionfishes can grow to a maximum length of , but are usually no longer than . The operculum (bony covering of gills) has two spines, the lower of which is more conspicuous. False scorpionfish have 36 to 44 lateral line scales. False scorpionfishes have 13 or 14 dorsal fin spines and 9 to 11 branched dorsal rays. The base of the anal fin is short, and has three spines and five segmented rays. The second anal fin spine is the longest. The pectoral fins have 12 to 14 rays, whereas pelvic fins have one spine and three rays. A membrane connects the inner pelvic ray to the body. The body overall is pale brown or grey. The fins may be the same colour or lighter, or even clear. The ventral side is paler than the dorsal side, and large brown or grey spots mottle the pectoral and pelvic fins and also the forward portion of the anal fin. False scorpionfish feed upon small fishes, shrimps, and crabs. Mimicry The false scorpionfish appears very similar to the true scorpionfish, to the point of originally being described as a species of Scorpaena. This similarity protects the false scorpionfish from predators, which would not prey upon the very venomous true scorpionfish. Distribution and habitat They are brackish-water or marine fish, living in the benthopelagic layer. Their range encompasses the Indo-West Pacific, from the Nicobar Islands to New Guinea, southwards to northern Australia, and as far north as the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. False scorpionfish occur on rocky bottoms and reefs, almost always those with ample seagrass covering. They are most commonly found in shallow waters along the coast. Relationship to humans False scorpionfishes have little or no role in commercial fisheries. However, they are occasionally found in home aquaria.

The Council noted proposals for the establishment of an impartial Commission of Inquiry from the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and went on to establish the Inquiry, while the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was requested to appoint the Commission at the earliest possible time. The Commission was directed to determine procedures for carrying out its investigation, while taking into account standard procedures of the United Nations. It also noted that the members of the Commission will have the status of experts on mission in accordance with the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations. Boutros-Ghali was required to provide assistance to the Commission while the parties in Somalia were urged to co-operate with it. The Council called upon the Commission to report as soon as possible and for the Secretary-General, on the completion of a report by the Commission, to suspend arrest actions against those individuals who were implicated but not currently detained and make provisions to deal with those already detained pursuant to Resolution 837.
