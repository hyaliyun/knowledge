Biography Born in London, England, Blanchard migrated to Australia, where he was educated at the Institute of Technology in Western Australia. He subsequently returned to England for tertiary education at the University of London, and later became a social worker and criminologist, before taking up a post as a training and staff development officer. In 1983, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as the Labor member for the Division of Moore, defeating sitting Liberal member John Hyde. He held the seat until 1990, when a redistribution made his seat marginally Liberal. He opted to run for reelection, and was defeated by Liberal Paul Filing on a swing of six percent. In 1987 he headed an inquiry into the Aboriginal homelands movement in Australia, by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs.

Its altitude ranges between 240 and 1,632 m above sea level. It is characterized by limestone outcrops, small beech forests, and unique Cantabrian holm oaks, together with manmade meadows for livestocks. This diverse habitat allows the development of a varied wildlife characteristic of the Cordillera. The park is located in an area that has traditionally been very unpopulated, which has made it possible for it to be so natural and undisturbed.

In January 2019, three members of the board of directors resigned, about six weeks after the resignation of Chief Executive Fergus Gammie. They were Adrienne Young-Cooper, Chris Ellis and Fran Wilde. Minister of Transport Phil Twyford said the agency had been \\"going through a massive change process\\", with its compliance work in the issuing of vehicle Warrant of Fitnesses under review.

Telebuses typically have a scheduled route, but passengers can ring and book a pick-up within an area served by the route, and the bus route is modified to make the pick-up. Drop offs anywhere within the area can also be accommodated. The aim is to extend public transport services to the front door of all residences, or from any place to any place. Some services operate exclusively for disabled or elderly passengers; other services are open to the general public. The term Paratransit has been used as a term for Telebus service. But possibly because paratransit sounds to the uninitiated like a service for the disabled, other terms such as Telebus have become more popular, particularly for services not primarily intended to service disabled passengers. Often paratransit is used to mean Demand responsive transport that is limited to disabled passengers. Examples The city of Regina in Canada was one of the early pioneers of Telebus services. Their service operated from the early 1970s until the early 1980s. Other cities have since initiated services. A number of public Telebus services operate in the outer suburbs of Melbourne, Australia. Aberdeen in Scotland operates a citywide service for passengers unable to use normal public transport services, as does Peterhead.

In March 2019, he receives the XIX Marco Antonio Ettedgui International Award for his artistic career from the Rajatabla Foundation of Venezuela. Biography Carlos Be became a playwright at age 22, when in 1997 he decided to quit a medical degree program to devote himself to writing on a full-time basis. Critics considers him \\"one of the main protagonists of this madrile√±a moved theater that is being lived in recent years\\" (Julio Bravo, ABC), \\"the enfant terrible of Madrid theater\\" (Jos√© Luis Romo, El Mundo) and \\"an author ignored in the commercial circuit, but called to larger companies\\" (Javier Vill√°n, El Mundo). As a theater author, he has published, among other works, 25 Noel Road: a genius like us (Caja Espa√±a Theater Award 2001), The extraordinary death of Ulrike M.

According to Elisenda Romano (Insular Library of Gran Canaria, 2019) \\"the plays of the playwright Carlos Be use the words to stabbing social conventions and turn against the remorse of the spectator. Living the works of the author or reading them is absorbing dialogues and images that go beyond the stage and stay in the well of consciousness, some ideas asleep, others very awake, but always there, to come to the surface and look us in the eyes\\".

They are saprobes that typically live on wood. The genus has a widespread distribution, especially in temperate regions, and contains about 150 species. Pholiota is derived from the Greek word pholis, meaning \\"scale\\". Taxonomic details The genus Pholiota includes mushrooms, with scaly, glutinous to dry cap surfaces, and that frequently grow on wood or at the bases of trees or on decaying tree roots, and spores that are brown, light brown, or yellowish brown in deposit. These spores are smooth with a germ pore, although the germ pore can be quite narrow in species. Usually the species have pleurocystidia that include a type called chrysocystidia. There have been several varying concepts of the genus, ranging from a pre-molecular era very broad concept that nowadays would include the genera Phaeolepiota, Phaeonematoloma, Flammula, Meottomyces, some Stropharia species, some Hypholoma species, Hemipholiota, Hemistropharia, some Kuehneromyces and some Phaeomarasmius, etc. Currently the genus is restricted to a smaller but still large group of species that primarily grow on wood, causing a white rot, but other taxa occur on burnt ground following forest fires or camp fires, on peaty or forest soil, but none are known to be mycorrhizal. Many species have prominent partial veils and form an annulus or annular ring on their stipes. None of the species have purplish or purplish brown spore prints. None form acanthocytes on their mycelia.

Based on Freud's researches into slips and parapraxes from 1897 onwards,Peter Gay, Freud (1989) pp. 125-6 it became perhaps the best-known of all Freud's writings.Ernest Jones, The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud (1964) p. 315 Editorial history The Psychopathology was originally published in the Monograph for Psychiatry and Neurology in 1901,Adam Phillips, On Flirtation (1994) p. 11 before appearing in book form in 1904. It would receive twelve foreign translations during Freud's lifetime, as well as numerous new German editions,Peter Gay, Freud (1989) p. 465 with fresh material being added in almost every one. James Strachey objected that \\"Almost the whole of the basic explanations and theories were already present in the earliest edition...the wealth of new examples interrupts and even confuses the mainstream of the underlying argument\\".Quoted in Adam Phillips, On Flirtation (1994) p. 10 However, in such a popular and theory-light text, the sheer wealth of examples helped make Freud's point for him in an accessible way.Peter Gay, Reading Freud (1990) p. 76 A new English-language translation by Anthea Bell was published in 2003. Among the most overtly autobiographical of Freud's works,Sigmund Freud, On Sexuality (PFL 7) p. 23 the Psychopathology was strongly linked by Freud to his relationship with Wilhelm Fliess.Peter Gay, Freud (1989) p. 126 Summary Studying the various deviations from the stereotypes of everyday behavior, strange defects and malfunctions, as well as seemingly random errors, the author concludes that they indicate the underlying pathology of the psyche, the symptoms of psychoneurosis. Freud writes in his introduction: :\\"During the year 1898 I published a short essay on the Psychic Mechanism of Forgetfulness. I shall now repeat its contents and take it as a starting-point for further discussion. I have there undertaken a psychologic analysis of a common case of temporary forgetfulness of proper names, and from a pregnant example of my own observation I have reached the conclusion that this frequent and practically unimportant occurrence of a failure of a psychic function ‚Äì of memory ‚Äì admits an explanation which goes beyond the customary utilization of this phenomenon. If an average psychologist should be asked to explain how it happens that we often fail to recall a name which we are sure we know, he would probably content himself with the answer that proper names are more apt to be forgotten than any other content of memory. He might give plausible reasons for this 'forgetting preference' for proper names, but he would not assume any deep determinant for the process.\\" Freud believed that various deviations from the stereotypes of everyday conduct - seemingly unintended reservation, forgetting words, random movements and actions - are a manifestation of unconscious thoughts and impulses. Explaining \\"wrong actions\\" with the help of psychoanalysis, just as the interpretation of dreams, can be effectively used for diagnosis and therapy. Considering the numerous cases of such deviations, he concludes that the boundary between the normal and abnormal human psyche is unstable and that we are all a bit neurotic. Such symptoms are able to disrupt eating, sexual relations, regular work, and communication with others. In the last chapter of his book, Freud deals with the problem of psychic determinism, for which he makes a case. He argues that \\"If one investigates, let us say, this seeming voluntary formation, for example, of a number of many digits uttered in unrestrained mirth, it always proves to be so strictly determined that the determination seems impossible\\". He then discusses a famous case of a name \\"arbitrarily chosen\\", the Dora's one. Analysing the motivation of his choice, it occurred to him that the nurse of his sister's children was named Dora. Then a slight recent event soon flashed into his mind which brought the looked-for determination. On his sister's dining-room he noticed a letter with the address \\"Miss Rosa W.\\". Flabbergasted, he was informed that the real name of Dora was in fact Rose, and that she had agreed to have her name changed in order to get the job, because Rosa would also refer to his sister\\".S. Freud: The Psychopathology of Everyday Life, Standard Edition, Vol. VI, pp. 240-241 Freud's conclusion is that: :\\"The unconscious, at all events, knows no time limit. The most important as well as the most peculiar character of psychic fixation consists in the fact that all impressions are on the one hand retained in the same form as they were received, and also in the forms that they have assumed in their further development. This state of affairs cannot be elucidated by any comparison from any other sphere. By virtue of this theory every former state of the memory content may thus be restored, even though all original relations have long been replaced by newer ones.\\" Influence and reception Sometimes called the Mistake Book (to go with the Dream Book and the Joke Book),Adam Phillips, On Flirtation (1994) p. 10 The Psychopathology of Everyday Life became one of the scientific classics of the 20th century.A. Kukla/J. Walmsley, Mind (2006) p. 186 Freud realised he was becoming a celebrity when he found his cabin-steward reading the Mistake Book on his 1909 visit to the States.Peter Gay, Freud (1989) p. 209 The Rat Man came to Freud for analysis as a result of reading the Psychopathology of Everyday Life.Sigmund Freud, Case Studies II (PFL 9) p. 40 The psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan considered The Psychopathology of Everyday Life one of the three key texts for an understanding of the unconscious, alongside The Interpretation of Dreams (1900), and Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious (1905).Jacques Lacan, Ecrits (1996) p. 170 Through its stress on what Freud called \\"switch words\\" and \\"verbal bridges\\",Sigmund Freud, The Psychopathology of Everyday Life (1989) p. 70 and p. 349 The Psychopathology of Everyday Life is considered important for psychopathology. Strachey's English translation is criticized by the psychologist Louis Breger, who writes that Strachey translates the word for slips or mistakes as \\"parapraxis\\" when the English \\"blunder\\" or \\"faulty action\\" would have been more appropriate, and uses the Latinisms \\"id\\" and \\"ego\\" where \\"it\\" and \\"I\\" would have better captured Freud's language. The philosopher Michel Onfray argues that The Psychopathology of Everyday Life is not scientific.Michel Onfray, Apostille au cr√©puscule. Pour une psychanalyse non freudienne Grasset, Paris, 2010 p.140-141 Jacques B√©nesteau writes that Freud added lies in each edition.Mensonges freudiens: histoire d'une d√©sinformation s√©culaire. by Jacques B√©nesteau, √âditions Mardaga, 2002 The philosopher Mikkel Borch- Jacobsen and the psychologist Sonu Shamdasani write that Freud's coupling of an analysis of his dreams and childhood memories had a precedent in Belgian psychologist Joseph Delboeuf's Sleep and Dreams, one of the major themes of which is the capacity of dreams to recall forgotten memories.

The second incident involved Royal Navy ships striking mines and the third incident occurred when the Royal Navy conducted mine-clearing operations in the Corfu Channel, but in Albanian territorial waters, and Albania complained about them to the United Nations. This series of incidents led to the Corfu Channel case, where the United Kingdom brought a case against the People's Republic of Albania to the International Court of Justice.JSTOR The Corfu Channel Case Quincy Wright The American Journal of International Law, Vol. 43, No. 3 (July 1949), pp. 491‚Äì494 (article consists of 4 pages) Published by: American Society of International Law Retrieved 31-07-08 The Court rendered a decision under which Albania was to pay ¬£844,000 to the United Kingdom. This is equivalent to ¬£ in 2015 terms. Because of the incidents, Britain, in 1946, broke off talks with Albania aimed at establishing diplomatic relations between the two countries. Diplomatic relations were only restored in 1991.  History  HMS Orion was one of the ships fired on in the first incident The incidents started on 15 May 1946 when two Royal Navy ships, HMS Orion and HMS Superb, crossed the Corfu Channel following a prior inspection and clearing of the strait.ABC CLIO Schools Corfu Channel Incident (1946) While crossing they came under fire from Albanian artillery in coastal fortifications. The shells missed and the British warships did not return fire. Although the ships suffered no material damage and no human casualties occurred, Britain issued a formal demand for \\"an immediate and public apology from the Albanian Government\\". Such apology was not forthcoming, however, and the Albanian Government claimed that the British ships had trespassed into Albanian territorial waters.Digest of International Cases on the Law of the Sea By Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea, United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea, United Nations Office of Legal Affairs Published by United Nations Publications, 2007 . 272 pages Albania issued a warning that prior notice should be given for all vessels passing through the Corfu Channel. Britain declared that it would not give prior notice and threatened that if British warships were fired on again, they would return fire.https://books.google.co.il/books?id=wiVzAwAAQBAJ&pg;=PA237 The second incident was more serious. On 22 October 1946, a Royal Navy flotilla composed of the cruisers HMS Mauritius and HMS Leander, and the destroyers and HMS Volage, was ordered northward through the Corfu Channel with the express orders to test the Albanian reaction to their right of innocent passage.Australian Journal of Legal History Half Light Between War and Peace: Herbert Vere Evatt, The Rule of International Law, and The Corfu Channel CaseInstitute for International Law and Justice The crews were instructed to respond if attacked. They were passing close to the Albanian coast in what they considered to be a mine-free zone with Mauritius leading and Saumarez following closely. Leander was about one and two-thirds of a nautical mile or three kilometres away accompanied by Volage. Near the bay of Saranda, just prior to 3 p.m., the destroyer Saumarez struck a mine and was heavily damaged.People's war on BBC Picture of the moment of impact and estimate of men lost The destroyer Volage was ordered to tow the Saumarez south to a Corfu harbour. Light cruiser HMS Leander was present during the second incident At approximately 4:16 p.m., while towing, Volage also struck a mine and sustained heavy damage. Both ships' bows were completely blown off and adverse weather conditions in the straits made the towing effort exceedingly difficult with both ships sailing stern-first,HMS Cardigan Bay Association but after twelve hours of effort both ships managed to reach the Corfu harbour. Forty-four men died and forty-two were injured in the incident.

Since Albania had no appropriate vessels at that time, the mines were probably laid by Yugoslavian minelayers Mljet and Meljine on Albanian request, around 20 October 1946.

The British Minister of Pensions at the time of the incident awarded full military pensions to the disabled and to the widows of the dead. The third and final incident occurred on 12‚Äì13 November 1946 when the Royal Navy carried out an additional mine sweeping operation in the Corfu channel, codenamed Operation Retail.The Law and Organisation of International Commodity Agreements By Kabir-ur-Rahman Khan Published by BRILL, 1982 . 416 pages Under the direction of the Allied Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean the mine-sweeping operation took place within Albanian territorial waters, but without authorisation by the Albanian government, and had the additional purpose of using the mines as corpora delicti to prove that the British were acting in self defence by attempting to clear hazards to navigation. Light cruiser HMS Mauritius was present during the second incident There was also present a French naval officer who, at the invitation of the Mediterranean Zone Board, acted as an observer. An aircraft carrier (HMS Ocean), cruisers and other warships provided cover. Twenty-two contact mines were discovered and cut from their undersea moorings. The placement of the mines was such that the minefield was deemed to have been deliberately designed and not simply a random aggregation of isolated mines. Two of the cut mines were sent to Malta for further examination. It was then discovered that the mines were of German origin but they were free of rust and marine growth. They were also freshly painted and their mooring cables were recently lubricated. It was concluded that the minefield was laid shortly before the incident involving Saumarez and Volage. Mine fragment analysis from the Volage confirmed the mines were similar to the ones at Malta. Following the third incident, Albania, under prime minister Enver Hoxha, dispatched a telegram to the United Nations complaining about an incursion by the Royal Navy into Albanian coastal waters.Straits Used for International Navigation: A Spanish Perspective By Jos√© Antonio de Yturriaga Published by Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1991 . 372 pages  Aftermath  Saumarez under tow by Volage after being mined, October 1946 On 9 December 1946 Britain sent a note to the Albanian government accusing Albania of laying the mines and demanding reparations for the May and October incidents. Britain demanded a reply within fourteen days, mentioning that in the event of a negative Albanian response the matter would be referred to the UN Security Council. The Albanian government in its reply, which was received by the British on 21 December 1946, denied the British allegations and went on to elaborate that the whole affair was the work of countries which did not wish to see a normalisation of relations between Albania and Britain, and in fact vessels from Greece and other countries had trespassed recently in the area where the mines were discovered. The British government did not find this response satisfactory and it eventually brought its case to the International Court of Justice, having failed in its attempt to involve the Security Council in the matter.New York Times ALBANIA PLANNING WEST GERMAN TIES By DAVID BINDER, SPECIAL TO THE NEW YORK TIMES Published: 5 July 1987 It was the first case adjudicated by the ICJ,Nations Encyclopedia Disputes Relating to the Law of the Sea and in December 1949 the court awarded the British the sum of ¬£843,947 or US$2,009,437 having found that,Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online.

Retrieved 24 October 2009 irrespectively of who laid the mines, the Albanians ought to have observed any such action, since the minefield was so close to their coast, and thus they failed to inform the British of the danger.Fjalori Enciklopedik Shqiptar. (1985); page 399. The Court also rejected the self- defence argument advanced by the United Kingdom and found that the mine- clearing operations undertaken by the British during Operation Retail, in the absence of prior Albanian consent, were illegal. One of the mines being inspected after being swept, 12 December 1946. The Albanian Government refused to pay the reparations ordered by the Court and in retaliation the British withheld 1574 kilograms of gold belonging to Albania. The gold, looted by the Axis powers from Albania during World War II, was stored in the vaults of the Bank of England and was awarded to the Albanians by the US-UK-France tripartite commission in 1948 after it was retrieved by the Allies. With the end of the Cold War, the People's Socialist Republic of Albania ceased to exist in 1992. Diplomatic relations between the two countries were established on 29 May 1991.UK in Albania (British Embassy in Albania) Soon after, on 8 May 1992, Britain and Albania announced that they had come to an agreement over the Corfu Channel case, jointly announcing that \\"Both sides expressed their regret at the Corfu Channel Incident of 22 October 1946\\". Only in 1996 following lengthy negotiations was the gold finally returned to Albania after it agreed to pay US$2,000,000 in delayed reparations. Volage after being mined, October 1946 Enver Hoxha, in his memoirs about his first meeting with Joseph Stalin, wrote that the whole affair was concocted by the British as an excuse for military intervention at the town of Saranda. He also said that \\"We have never planted mines in the Ionian Sea. The mines that exploded had either been laid by the Germans in the time of war, or were deliberately laid by the British, later, so that they could explode them\\", he criticised the presence of the Royal Navy saying \\"There was no reason for these ships to be sailing along our coast, they had not notified us about such a movement.\\"Enver Hoxha Memoirs from my Meetings with Stalin First Meeting July 1947 Hoxha also described the events as \\"an unprecedented provocation toward our country\\". On 2 November 2009 a team of US and Albanian researchers announced that they found what they believe to be the bow segments of HMS Volage in the Corfu Channel under approximately fifty metres of water.Pieces of WWII-Era UK Warship Apparently Found Pieces of British destroyer mined in 1946 apparently found near Greece The Associated Press By LLAZAR SEMINI Associated Press Writer TIRANA, Albania 2 November 2009 (AP) from ABC news.com Dishes, shoes and ammunition found in the area surrounding the wreckage are further evidence that fits, according to the researchers. In May 2013, a special edition of Archaeology Magazine entitled \\"Shipwrecks\\", specifically, the article \\"Righting a Cold War Wrong: Where was HMS Volage?\\" gave insight into the new discoveries. The Director of the Albanian Center for Marine Research, Auron Tare obtained film footage from The National Archives United Kingdom of the incident showing HMS Volage very close to shore when the incident occurred. This was further reinforced by James P. Delgado, Director of Maritime Heritage for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). He reasserted his claim made previously to Associated Press that the wreck was that of HMS Volage because the electrical wiring of the bow section discovered was of the time period one would expect. The fact that the bow section, with dishes intact and stacked shows a rapid sinking, and negates the British claim that the ships, including HMS Volage were in international waters as claimed so many decades ago. [This last paragraph should be reviewed by someone more knowledgeable. Its seems to be editorializing rather than just conveying facts. The two citations cannot be verified.]  International law  The International Court of Justice ruling in the case established a precedent regarding whether a violation of territorial sovereignty is justified intervention. The United Kingdom claimed it was justified in entering Albanian territorial waters on 12 and 13 November 1946 to secure evidence needed to support its case. The ICJ responded, > The Court cannot accept such a line of defence. The Court can only regard > the alleged right of intervention as the manifestation of a policy of force, > such as has, in the past, given rise to most serious abuses and such as > cannot, whatever be the present defects in international organisation, find > a place in international law.

History Doc Watson and David Grisman first met in the early 1960s when Watson was playing at Gerde's Folk City in New York. Grisman, only 17 years old, was invited on stage by Watson to join him on mandolin for a rendition of ‚ÄúIn the Pines‚Äù. Mostly recorded at Grisman's home over a period of years, the recordings are informal and pulled from numerous recording sessions. In the liner notes, Grisman described the sessions: \\"These tapes document some wonderful 'after-dinner' sessions at my home during several of Doc's visits. Tunes were selected spontaneously and more often than not, played only once. We're pleased to share some of these moments.\\"Liner notes by David Grisman: Doc & Dawg. Reception Writing for Allmusic, the music critic S. Colby Miller wrote of the album, \\"The tracks are mainly traditional country and bluegrass tunes played lovingly and often with great restraint... This is an intimate collaboration between two men at the top of their craft who share a passion for acoustic music. It is a pleasure to listen in.\\" Stephen Hatfield of No Depression wrote, \\"Beyond the song selection and quality picking, the true source of bliss in this music is the level of familiarity and comfort it exudes. Listening to the music, one can almost imagine the two of them trading licks and guffaws right there on the front porch. Watson‚Äôs warm voice and conversational tone only add to the intimacy\\" Track listing # \\"Doc & Dawg\\" (David Grisman) ‚Äì 2:00 # \\"All About You\\" (Traditional) ‚Äì 3:38 # \\"Bluegrass Stomp\\" (Bill Monroe) ‚Äì 4:56 # \\"Summertime\\" (George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin, DuBose Heyward) ‚Äì 4:20 # \\"Sweet Georgia Brown\\" (Bernie, Casey, Pinkard) ‚Äì 1:59 # \\"Frankie and Johnny\\" (Traditional) ‚Äì 4:02 # \\"Soldier's Joy\\" (Traditional) ‚Äì 2:27 # \\"What Is Home Without Love?\\" (Monroe) ‚Äì 3:39 # \\"Fiddle-Tune Medley\\" (Traditional) ‚Äì 3:10 # \\"Kentucky Waltz\\" (Monroe) ‚Äì 3:34 # \\"My Dear Old Southern Home\\" (Ellsworth Cozzens, Jimmie Rodgers) ‚Äì 2:49 # \\"Florida Blues\\" (Traditional) ‚Äì 2:38 # \\"Blue as I Can Be\\" (Jimmie Rodgers) ‚Äì 3:20 # \\"Watson Blues\\" (Monroe) ‚Äì 3:52 Personnel * Doc Watson ‚Äì guitar, harmonica, vocals * David Grisman ‚Äì mandolin * Stuart Duncan ‚Äì fiddle * Jack Lawrence ‚Äì guitar * James Kerwin]‚Äì bass * Alan O'Bryant ‚Äì banjo * Curly Seckler ‚Äì harmony vocals Production notes *Produced by David Grisman *Engineered by Tom Anderson, David Dennison, Bob Shumaker *Mixed by David Dennison *Mastered by Paul Stubblebine *Photography by David Gahr, Jon Sievert, D.

In the 2008 Olympics, Gu was able to avenge his defeat to Murray by beating him convincingly. In 2009 he again reached the quarterfinal at the world championships, losing to Irish boxer John Nevin.

Murray came into the competition as the world bronze medalist in the 54 kg division. Despite of that, his reputations made minimal impact as Gu advanced into the last 16 with a 17-7 win that left the British camp fuming about poor judging. Afterwards, Murray said making the weight limit had been a problem. His comments came just days after, Frankie Gavin, Britain's world lightweight champion, has been pulled out after officials feared for his health if he carried on trying to beat the scales. Edwards, Murray's Coach, agreed with his fighter. 'The judges took it away from him. I thought they were very generous to the Chinese. You expect a slight bias but you come to the Olympic Games and expect a level playing field.' There are five judges for Olympic bouts, none of whom were British or Chinese for Murray's fight. Points are recorded when at least three simultaneously press their buttons to record a hit but the reactions from the crowd can influence them. 'I am not saying Joe would have won but I am saying they forced him to do some things that weren't in his game plan. He didn't box the best I have seen him box but scoring makes a difference to the tactics and those had to be changed because of the scoring. The Ukrainians have already protested about the judging when one of their fighters lost to a Chinese,' said Edwards. Murray's defeat followed the disappointment of Richard Faulds, the 2000 Olympic champion, who finished only sixth in the double trap.

It was co-written with Kathleen Gleeson. The book tells the story of Bardach's transformation from placid student in pre-war Poland, to a Communist convert after the Soviet Union's bisecting of the country with Germany, and then follows him through his trial for treason and sentence of forced labor in the camps in the Kolyma region of Siberia. Throughout, Bardach's accounts show the sacrifice, toil, and luck necessary to survive in a Stalinist-era labor camp.  Prologue  The memoir opens in Poland in July 1941, during Operation Barbarossa, the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. Bardach, a member of a tank crew, is digging his own grave in anticipation of his execution for treason. During the war, treason was an all-encompassing offense that could be applied to a litany of offenses, ranging from something as small as dereliction of duty. In Bardach's case, he was charged with treason for the belief that he intentionally wrecked his tank, when in fact it was simply rendered inoperable while fording a river. Bound and thrust into his self-made grave, Bardach waits for the impending shot, all the while wondering how it was that he had come to this place. \\"The night and earth and sleep and death had merged. All felt the same.\\"  Reviews  In so far as Man Is Wolf to Man is the story of man's brutality to man, popular criticism tended to compare it favorably to similar historical works, most notably Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago, while at the same time pointing toward its ultimately uplifting tale, not only of man's ability to survive, but also to assist others when seemingly at their worst. Perhaps most damning is Bardach's transformation from earnest Communist sympathizer to witness to its greatest atrocities.

(referred to in some records as \\"Ivan Vasiliev the First\\") was a Russian explorer and navigator of the Imperial Russian Navy. He accompanied Leonty Andrianovich Hagemeister (1780‚Äì1833) on ship Neva to explore the coasts of Alaska and the North Pacific in 1806. Vasiliev explored the Alexander Archipelago and the many coastal Islands in the area. In 1809 he surveyed the western shore of Baranof Island. Ivan F. Vasiliev should not be confused with explorer Mikhail Vasilyev (1770‚Äì1847) or with another navigator named Ivan Yakovlevich (Iakovlevich) Vasiliev (Vasil'ev) (1797 - died after 1838). Krusenstern says this about Ivan Filippovich Vasiliev: It is much to be regretted that the hydrographic works of a naval officer, Vasilief, who was in the employment of the American Company, were lost... Provided with a sextant and chronometer and with much zeal and attachment for his profession, he had during his sojourn in our American colonies made a complete survey of all of the Aleutian Islands without having had specific instructions to do so. Unfortunately he was drowned in Okhotsk harbor on his return from America to Russia, and what became of his precious papers and drawings is unknown...Krusenstern, Recueuil de m√©moires hydrographiques, 1827, Vol. II, p. 76 Ivan F. Vasiliev's name is spelt \\"Vasilief\\" in the United States, where he is also known as \\"Ivan Vasiliev the First\\", in order to differentiate him from other Russian mariners and early explorers of Alaska also named \\"Vasiliev\\". Vasilief Bank close to Sitka and Vasilief Rock in Kodiak Island were named after him. There are other geographic features in the coast of Alaska and the Aleutians bearing the name \\"Vasilief\\", but it is not clear after which Vasiliev they were named.

(bassist).Biography of Heavy metal band Kryptos They have long been considered to be one of the true spearheads of the Indian metal revolution upholding the old school metal ethos laid down by the 1980s NWOBHM/Thrash movements. Since their inception, the band has released five albums; Spiral Ascent (2004), The Ark of Gemini (2008) through Old School Metal Records (USA), The Coils of Apollyon (2013), Burn Up The Night (2016) and most recently, Afterburner (2019). The last three albums were released through AFM Records (Germany). History=Early years (1998‚Äì2003) Kryptos was formed in late 1998, Essentially a classic heavy metal band, they focus on fusing NWOBHM styling with elements of 1980s thrash metal. Their primary influences include Black Sabbath, Judas Priest and Iron Maiden along with secondary influences such as Coroner, Kreator, Mercyful Fate, and Candlemass.  Debut album (2004)  The first album Spiral Ascent was released in 2004, which quickly spread through the underground circuit in India as well as countries like Germany, Argentina and other parts of Europe. The album has long been out of print and is today considered a landmark release in Indian metal history. Dark Tranquillity's Niklas Sundin designed the album sleeve. Signing with Old School Metal Records and second studio album (2006‚Äì2009) In April 2006, Kryptos signed with Old School Metal Records from California, United States, and became one of the first metal bands from India to sign with an international metal label. November 2006 marked the departure of long-time vocalist/bassist Ganesh K. and guitarist Akshay 'Axe' Patel. This caused various changes in Kryptos' line-up. Nolan Lewis took up lead vocal duties in conjunction to being a guitarist. Rohit Chaturvedi and Jayawant Tewari were hired to fill the incumbent guitarist and bassist positions, respectively. The band entered the studios later that year to record the follow up to their debut album, and emerged in mid-2008 with their second album, The Ark of Gemini. The album received excellent reviews from different parts of the world and also enjoyed a fair amount of airplay on U.S and European metal radio stations. Supporting Iron Maiden (2009) Kryptos landed the supporting slot for Iron Maiden at Rock 'N India 2009 in their home town Bangalore, playing to almost 17,000 fans at the Palace Grounds at second edition of the festival.  The Coils of Apollyon (2012)  The Coils of Apollyon was released on 18 February 2012 in India, and 21 September 2012 internationally.  Tours = Early tours (Invasion Europa 2010 and Into the Spectral Void 2013)  In July 2010, Kryptos became the first Indian metal band to complete a cross-country tour of Europe, playing at the Rockmaraton festival in Hungary, in the Flammen Open Air festival in Germany as well as many more club gigs throughout Germany and Switzerland. The band kick-started the year 2012 by supporting folk/melodic death metal band Suidakra and German thrash metal pioneers Kreator at the inaugural edition of the Bangalore Open Air in June 2012. November of the same year saw them support Swedish Power Metal band Wolf at the third edition of the Harley Rock Riders festival. The band opened for Testament, whom they happen to consider an important musical influence, at the NH7 Festival in Bangalore. In 2013, Kryptos again toured Europe playing at festivals like In Flammen Open Air, Ragnarock Open Air and most notably Wacken Open Air, becoming the first Indian band ever to play at Wacken Open Air.  Signing with Seaside Touring and present events (2014‚Äìpresent)  In 2014, the band started the year with an appearance at Inferno Metal Festival in Norway and later announced a partnership with Seaside Touring. The band again played the third edition of Bangalore Open Air opening for Destruction and Rotting Christ. In September 2014, the band announced their Europe tour 'Apollyon Rising'. The tour started with the show at Hamburg Metal Dayz followed by 17 tour dates in countries such as Germany, Belgium, Italy, Austria, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Switzerland. The 17 days tour was part of the Wacken Road Show. In 2016, the band supported American thrash metal band Death Angel in Germany as well played a one-off show with Nervosa, Hirax and The Black Dahlia Murder in the Austrian town of Dornbirn. In 2017, the band opened for Swedish heavy metal band Katatonia at Saarang, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, and followed it up with a European summer tour supporting American thrash metal band Sacred Reich on the 30 Years of Ignorance tour. The tour included dates in Germany, Austria and The Netherlands, as well as appearances at Rockharz Open Air and Wacken Open Air. This tour would prove to be the most defining in the band's history and laid the foundation for their first headlining tour in 2019, which included a first concert in Malta. In 2018, long time drummer Anthony Hoover announced his departure from the band. Since then, the band has continued with sessions musicians behind the kit.

Its range includes the eastern parts of the Balkan Mountains, i.e. the regions of Dryanovo, Kotel and Elena). As a result of the mass population movements that affected eastern Bulgaria during the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, speakers of the dialect have also moved south towards Burgas and north towards Varna and Targovishte.

History  Miami Monthly evolved from a family of community publications founded in 1997 by publisher Elena V. Carpenter. Appearing first as tabloid-size newspapers, the Coconut Grove Times, Brickell Post and South Miami Times grew into glossy city magazines that were combined into an expanded city/regional in 2005.  Editorial content  Each issue contains community news, people profiles, feature articles, real estate news and advice, fashion, auto reviews, social pages, a cultural and events calendar, restaurant reviews and listings, a wine column, and the Miami Moment photo essay page. Miami Monthly is noted for its coverage of political issues, its analysis of real estate trends, and timely information of interest to the business community. In July 2007, Miami Monthly broke the story of an organized group of City of Miami employees who participated in an underground business known as The Firm. \\"Robbing the City Blind\\" described how members of the Capital Improvements Department spent many hours each day working on their secret clients using city computers, vehicles and other equipment. A dozen initial arrests included charges ranging from organized racketeering to grand theft and fraud. In November 2007, \\"Boom or Bust\\" exposed an enclave of single-family homes in a neighborhood-in-transition that were selling above listing prices, and promptly going into foreclosure. The feature story also brought to light an over-tasked law enforcement community unable to deal with the mounting cases of mortgage fraud in Miami-Dade County. A follow-up story in July 2008 documented thousands of mortgage-related foreclosures throughout the area. Miami Monthly publishes three themed issues each year: A roster of the spring festival season (February), a focus on international real estate activity in Miami (April), and a guide to the local cultural season (October).  Readership and distribution  Geared toward the area's professional population, Miami Monthly reaches readers from greater Miami's most affluent neighborhoods and communities. Miami Monthly is the area's largest circulated magazine, with an audited print run of 50,900. It is distributed through direct mail, home delivery and strategic commercial, office, condominium and hotel drop locations.

It is an estate designed and constructed in the Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture, and is considered one of the finest examples of the style. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and made a National Historic Landmark on January 16, 2009. Today the entire site is owned and operated as a historic house museum and garden by the non-profit Casa del Herrero Foundation, with the goal of restoring and preserving the house and grounds. History Casa del Herrero (Spanish for \\"House of the Blacksmith\\") was designed for George Fox Steedman and his wife, who were moving west from St. Louis, by architect George Washington Smith. The residence was completed in 1925, and the Steedmans moved into it the same day as the Santa Barbara earthquake. Steedman - an industrialist, engineer, and amateur architect - assembled a team of architects, landscape architects, antiquarians, and horticulturists to produce the Casa del Herrero estate ‚Äî an example of Spanish Colonial Revival architecture. Steedman participated in every detail of the property's buildings, furnishings, and gardens. In the 1930s, architect Lutah Maria Riggs designed the octagonal library addition. Steedman died in 1940, and his widow continued to live there until her death in 1962. Their daughter Medora Bass then lived at the Casa until her death in 1987. The foundation that now operates the estate was created in 1993 by her son. Tours Docent-led tours of the Casa del Herrero house, gardens and workshop are available by reservation.

The poem uses free verse to describe the death of a soldier. Interpretation The poem's longevity reinforces the naturalistic austerity of its depiction of death. One interpretive viewpoint asks whether Stevens is writing about any death, or rather, as Longenbach asserts, the death of the soldier‚Äî\\"and not an ambiguously 'fictive' soldier but Eug√®ne Lemercier [the young French painter killed in 1915 whose letters were collected as Lettres d'un soldat and read by Stevens in the summer of 1917].\\" Lemercier was the grandson of Irish artist Harriet Osborne O'Hagan. Longenbach claims that the poem's \\"utter bareness derives from the fact that Stevens was writing not about natural death ... but about a new kind of unnatural death, the daily death of thousands of soldiers on French battlefields.\\"Longenbach, J. p. 70 One response to Longenbach's interpretation is to invoke Stevens's distinction between the true subject of a poem and the poetry of the subject, as he draws it in \\"The Irrational Element in Poetry\\".Kermode, F., p. 785 > Now, just as the choice of subject is unpredictable at the outset, so its > development, after it has been chosen, is unpredictable. One is always > writing about two things at the same time in poetry and it is this that > produces the tension characteristic of poetry. One is the true subject and > the other is the poetry of the subject. Then Lemercier's death would be the true subject, and the poetry of the subject would be anyone's death. \\"The Death of a Soldier\\" and other works by Stevens lead Bates to describe Stevens as \\"a war poet, after his fashion\\", and Ramazani's \\"Stevens and the War Elegy\\" expands on that idea, especially as it relates to post-Harmonium poems that are informed by World War II.Ramazani, J. Bates compares the poem to The Snow Man, particularly its final stanza, in which the snow man must be \\"nothing himself\\" in order to behold \\"the nothing that is\\". In this respect \\"The Death of a Soldier\\" adopts the snow man's point of view, according to Bates. The soldier has a \\"Lockean mind\\": \\"He is the sum of his impressions\\", Bates writes, \\"identical, in this instance, with the nothing he does behold\\".Bates, p. 133 The soldier's \\"blank slate\\" (tabula rasa) becomes a blank, so to speak, leaving the clouds to go in their direction. Even if Bates's reading strikes one as strained, the poem marks a departure from Romantic and Victorian conceptions of death. Death is not personified, for instance. Compare \\"Invective Against Swans\\". The analogy between death and the season of autumn supports the interpretive idea that Stevens's care about the weather is interwoven with reflections on deeper themes such as death and the nature of time. (See the issue between Vendler and Bloom in the main Harmonium essay, the section \\"The musical Imagist\\".) Buttel includes \\"The Death of a Soldier\\" as among a handful of Harmonium poems that most notably anticipate the \\"more reflective, more meditative, more serene, but no less intense\\" poems of Stevens' later work, not excluding \\"those magnificent, direct, fervent and profound poems in The Rock at the end‚Äîand possibly the summit‚Äîof his career\\".Buttel, p. 250. The others that Buttel picks out are \\"Sunday Morning\\", \\"The Snow Man\\", \\"Another Weeping Woman\\", and \\"From the Misery of Don Joost\\".  Notes  References  * Bates, Milton J.

It slightly resembles a wind tunnel. The Voitenko compressor initially separates a test gas from a shaped charge with a malleable steel plate. When the shaped charge detonates, most of its energy is focused on the steel plate, driving it forward and pushing the test gas ahead of it. Ames Research Center translated this idea into a self-destroying shock tube. A shaped charge accelerated the gas in a 3-cm glass-walled tube 2 meters in length. The velocity of the resulting shock wave was a phenomenal . The apparatus exposed to the detonation was, of course, completely destroyed, but not before useful data were extracted. In a typical Voitenko compressor, a shaped charge accelerates hydrogen gas, which in turn accelerates a thin disk up to about 40 km/s. A slight modification to the Voitenko compressor concept is a super-compressed detonation, a device that uses a compressible liquid or solid fuel in the steel compression chamber instead of a traditional gas mixture. A further extension of this technology is the explosive diamond anvil cell, utilizing multiple opposed shaped-charge jets projected at a single steel-encapsulated fuel, such as hydrogen. The fuels used in these devices, along with the secondary combustion reactions and long blast impulse, produce similar conditions to those encountered in fuel-air and thermobaric explosives. This method of detonation produces energies over 100 keV (~109 K temperatures), suitable not only for nuclear fusion, but other higher-order quantum reactions as well. The UTIAS explosive-driven-implosion facility was used to produce stable, centered and focused hemispherical implosions to generate neutrons from D‚ÄìD reactions. The simplest and most direct method proved to be in a predetonated stoichiometric mixture of deuterium and oxygen. The other successful method was using a miniature Voitenko-type compressor, where a plane diaphragm was driven by the implosion wave into a secondary small spherical cavity that contained pure deuterium gas at one atmosphere. In brief, PETN solid explosive is used to form a hemispherical shell (3‚Äì6 mm thick) in a 20-cm diameter hemispherical cavity milled in a massive steel chamber. The remaining volume is filled with a stoichiometric mixture of (H2 or D2 and O2). This mixture is detonated by a very short thin exploding wire located at the geometric center. The arrival of the detonation wave at the spherical surface instantly and simultaneously fires the explosive liner. The detonation wave in the explosive liner hits the metal cavity, reflects, and implodes on the preheated burnt gases, focuses at the center of the hemisphere (50 microseconds after the initiation of the exploding wire) and reflects, leaving behind a very small pocket (1 mm) of extremely high-temperature, high- pressure and high-density plasma.

It originates from two villages in the eastern parts of the Balkan Mountains, Kozichino (formerly Erkech) near Pomorie and Golitsa south of Varna. As a result of the mass population movements that affected eastern Bulgaria during the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, speakers of the dialect have established numerous colonies in the regions of Provadia, Varna, Novi Pazar, Balchik, Silistra and Pomorie, thus significantly expanding the range of the dialect. The most significant feature of the dialect, as in all Balkan dialects, is the pronunciation of Old Church Slavonic —£ (yat) as or , depending on the character of the following syllable. Phonological and morphological characteristics Map of the Big Yus isogloss in Bulgarian language in early 20th century Due to the relative isolation of the two villages in the past, the Erkech dialect has a number of idiosyncratic features that separate it from the other Balkan dialects: * long vowels under stress, i.e. stressed i is pronounced as ' (–¥—É–±–∏–∏—Ç—ä–∫ vs. formal –¥–æ–±–∏—Ç—ä–∫) and stressed o is pronounced as ' (–∫–æ–æ–Ω vs. formal –∫–æ–Ω) * Pronunciation of Old Church Slavonic —´' (yus) and —ä as long broad –µ (') in a stressed syllable and as a slightly reduced a in an unstressed syllable - –∑–ø vs. formal –∑—ä–ø, –¥–∞–∂–¥ vs. formal –¥—ä–∂–¥—ä—Ç.

The 1924 Chatham Cup was the second annual nationwide knockout football competition in New Zealand. The competition was run on a regional basis, with the numerous local associations being grouped in with the four major regional associations (Auckland, Wellington, Canterbury, and Otago) in qualifying, with each of these four regions being represented in semi-finals by one team, followed by northern and southern semi-finals and a national final. Ten teams from the Wellington region took part, and it is known that Seacliff were the only Otago entrants (North Otago, the home of Oamaru Rangers, being counted as a separate region). The Auckland representative for the competition was not chosen via a knock-out competition. This raised concerns in some quarters that the rules of the competition were not being adhered to. The 1924 final The final was played in sodden conditions at Wellington. Seacliff took an early lead through W. Simmons, holding on to it until half-time.

Although found predominantly in Europe, where it grows in a mycorrhizal association with alder, it has also recorded from China, Japan and California. Fruit bodies are distinguished from other boletes by decurrent bright yellow pores that turn blue-grey on bruising. G. lividus mushrooms are edible. Taxonomy The alder bolete was initially described by French mycologist Pierre Bulliard in 1791 as Boletus lividus, before being given its current binomial name in 1888 by Pier Andrea Saccardo when he transferred it to Gyrodon. When Saccardo circumscribed Gyroporus, he included Boletus sistotremoides (published by Elias Fries in 1815) as the type species. Rolf Singer later determined that Fries's taxon was the same species as Gyroporus lividus. Before this, in 1886 Lucien Qu√©let erected the genus Uliporus with Boletus lividus as the type. As a result of Singer's discovery, the genus Uliporus was rendered obsolete, and Boletus sistrotremoides became synonymous with Gyropus lividus. The generic term Gyrodon is derived from the Ancient Greek gyros \\"whorl\\" and odon \\"tooth\\", while the specific epithet lividus is Latin for \\"lead-coloured\\". The fungus is commonly known as the alder bolete. Molecular research confirms the relations of the genus Gyrodon and the gilled genus Paxillus as sister taxa, and one of the earliest diverging lineages of the suborder Boletineae. Two subspecies of G. lividus have been described: subsp. alneti, published by Sven Johan Lindgren in 1874, and subsp. labyrinthicus, published by Saccardo in 1888. Neither are considered to have independent taxonomic significance. Description Gyrodon lividus has a pale brown, buff or ochre cap in diameter which is convex and later flat in shape, and can be sticky when wet. Like other boletes, it has pores instead of gills that make up the hymenophore on the underside of the cap. These large pores are decurrent in their attachment to the stipe. Bright yellow, they turn blue-grey when cut or bruised. The thin flesh is pale yellow. The ringless stipe is initially the same colour as the cap but later darkens to a red-brown; it is high by wide. The spore print is olive-brown and the oval spores are 4.5‚Äì6 x 3‚Äì4 Œºm. The mushroom has a non-distinctive smell and taste. In the United States, Gyrodon lividus could be mistaken for Boletinellus merulioides, which is generally a larger mushroom overall with larger spores and grows under ash (Fraxinus), or B. proximus, a dark brown or purple-brown capped species that does not change colour when bruised and is found only in Florida. Distribution and habitat Gyrodon lividus is found across Europe, including ƒ∂emeri National Park in Latvia, In Asia, it has been recorded in China and Japan. It is also found in several locales in Turkey, including Trabzon, Ma√ßka and Sevin√ß. In North America, it has been reported to occur in California, under alder (Alnus rhombifolia). As its common name suggests, Gyrodon lividus is found under alder (Alnus rhombifolia), with which it forms a mycorrhizal relationship. Fruit bodies may be found alone or in clumps and appear in autumn. The ectomycorrhiza of the fungus is characterized by its yellow colour in young specimens, rhizomorphs that are highly differentiated, and the presence of sclerotia. Edibility It is reported as edible by some authors, and inedible by others. Bioactive compounds Fruit bodies of Gyrodon lividus contain the cyclopentanedione compounds chamonixin and involution.

Salvador Rodolfo Sr. (7 February 1919 - 9 January 2012) was a Filipino soldier who helped liberate the Island Province of Catanduanes in the Philippines from the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II. He was known in Catanduanes as ‚ÄúPhantom‚Äù or the \\"Man who Never Dies\\", based on the comic book hero created by Lee Falk in 1936. He organized the Catanduanes Liberation Forces (CLF), the guerilla unit that paved the way for the liberation of Catanduanes in 1945. As a result, Japanese forces were destroyed before the American forces arrived in Catanduanes in 1945.Rebellion in Catanduanes, Perry M. Calara, Kaiba News and Features Personal life Rodolfo was born in 1919 in Bato, Catanduanes, Philippines. He was a descendant of Don Juan Rodolfo of Almeria, Spain who went to the Philippines in the 18th century and married the daughter of Datu Bantog, who was then one of the Tribal Chieftains in Catanduanes, in order to put to a halt the hostilities between the natives and the Spaniards. The Rodolfos played an important role in Catanduanes politics in the Spanish Colonial Period. His father, Roman Rodolfo, was an undefeated Mayor of Bato, and his mother, Maria Tan Arambulo, was a Chinese businesswoman. World War II When the Second World War broke out, Rodolfo was called to arms in defense of the Philippines against the invading Japanese Imperial Forces. He fought in the three-month Battle of Bataan in 1942, and was a survivor of the Bataan Death March. While in Camp O‚ÄôDonnel in Capas, Tarlac, he met the then Lt. Ferdinand E. Marcos, who would later on become President of the Philippines. He was released later. After being released from the camp in Capas, Rodolfo organized the Catanduanes Liberation Forces. Catanduanes Liberation Forces The Catanduanes Liberation ForcesHistory of Catanduanes, Bernardo C. Vargas (1991) headed and organized by Rodolfo was the resistance movement in Catanduanes. During this time, Rodolfo was rumored several times to have been killed in battle but returned to fight in Catanduanes, hence he was called ‚ÄúPhantom‚Äù or the Man who never dies. Liberation On February 8, 1945, when Rodolfo was about to declare the independence of the province after he and his men killed every Japanese Imperial Army and burned every Japanese garrison in Catanduanes, one of his men approached him and said that there were Japanese reinforcements on board 2 vessels approaching the island. He then talked to his men, most of whom were wounded and exhausted, he said: > Japanese reinforcements are coming. I have two options for you, we can go to > the hills and save ourselves and wait there until the Americans arrive, but > I assure you that all civilians left behind will be massacred by the > incoming Japanese, or we can repeat what happened in the Battle of > Thermopylae and stand our ground. Most of us will die, but we will live > forever in the pages of history as the men who fought for the liberation of > Catanduanes With that, everybody decided to stand their ground and fight the incoming Japanese. They went to their posts to wait for the enemy‚Äôs arrival but then, as if by providence, American planes arrived and bombed the Japanese vessels. Rodolfo declared independence of the entire province on February 8, 1945. Later life and death Rodolfo played a role in local politics in the 1980s and 1990s, serving as Senior Provincial Board Member of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan and acting Vice Governor in Catanduanes. He was a key ally of the late Gov. Leandro Verceles Sr., ultimately bringing an end to the political dynasty in the province. In 1995, he was appointed as Chief Security Consultant in the Bureau of Immigration under then Commissioner Leandro Verceles during Pres. Fidel V. Ramos Administration. He was granted US Citizenship in 1992 after the US Congress passed the law granting citizenship to the USAFFE Veterans who served under Gen. Douglas McArthur. He decided to stay in America for good in 2002. He died on January 9, 2012 at Los Robles Hospital in Thousand Oaks, California. He was a month away from his 93rd birthday. He is buried at the Garden of Valor in Valley Oaks-Griffin Memorial Park in Westlake Village, California. References * \\"Rebellion in Catanduanes\\", Perry M.

Life Weitenauer was born at Ingolstadt, Bavaria. His family had been knighted by the Elector of Bavaria, Maximilian Joseph. After the ordinary studies of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), which he entered November 3, 1724, he taught for eleven years poetry and rhetoric in several colleges, mainly at Eichst√§tt. In 1753 he was called to the chair of philosophy and Oriental languages at the University of Innsbruck. When his career as professor was abruptly brought to an end by the suppression of the Jesuits in 1773, he followed an invitation of the abbot of the Cistercians of Salem Abbey to continue his literary activity in the monastery. He died at Salem near Constance in W√ºrttemberg, at the age of 73. Works Prior to his call to Innsbruck, Weitenauer published several occasional works, festive odes and plays, of high merit. It was, however, during his professorship at Innsbruck that he composed his numerous learned works, the principal of which are: *Biblia sacra (\\"Holy Bible\\", Augsburg, 1773): a commentary based on a comparison of the Vulgate with the original text *Lexicon biblicum (\\"Biblical Lexicon\\", Augsburg, 1758, 1780), an explanation of difficult Hebrew and Greek phrases occurring in the Vulgate, republished frequently, even as late as 1866 *Hierolexicon linguarum orientalium, 1 (\\"Sacred Lexicon of Oriental Languages\\"), together with a grammar \\"Trifolium hebraicum, chaldaicum et syriacum\\" (\\"Hebrew, Chaldaic (Aramaic), and Syriac Trefoil\\", Augsburg, 1759) *Modus addiscendi. . .linguas gallicam, italicam, hispanicam, graecam, hebraicam et chaldaicam (\\"Method of Learning the French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, Hebrew, and Chaldaic Languages\\", Frankfurt on Main, 1756), which he supplemented in 1762 by the Hexaglotton alterum docens linguas anglicam, germanicam, belgicam, latinam, lusitanicam et syriacam (\\"Another Six-Language [Grammar] for Instruction in English, German, Belgian (Dutch), Latin, Lusitanian (Portuguese), and Syriac\\"), both of them appearing under the title \\"Hexaglotton geminum\\" (\\"Twin Six-Language [Grammar]\\") His extensive linguistic studies bore direct relation to the study of Scripture. Besides he published \\"Subsidia eloquentiae sacrae\\" (\\"Support of Sacred Eloquence\\", 19 vols., Augsburg, 1764‚Äì69). After the suppression of his order appeared \\"Apparatus catecheticus\\" (\\"Catechetic Apparatus\\", Augsburg, 1775), a collection of 1500 examples, illustrative of the teachings of Christianity. His last great work was a German translation in 12 volumes of both the Old and the New Testament with numerous annotations. References ;Attribution * That entry was by Charles F. Arnold.

The novel consists of two novellas, \\"Adventure on Poloda\\" and \\"Tangor Returns\\", written quickly in late 1940. The first was published in The Blue Book Magazine in 1942, but the second did not see publication until 1964 when it was featured in Tales of Three Planets along with \\"The Resurrection of Jimber-Jaw\\" and The Wizard of Venus. Burroughs likely intended Beyond the Farthest Star to be the opening of a new series comparable to the Barsoom or Pellucidar sequences, but declining health and Burroughs's World War II service as a war correspondent prevented this from happening. However, the story saw new life in 1972, when it was adapted by comics writer Marv Wolfman and artist Dan Green as one of the back-ups in DC Comics' version of the Tarzan comic book; the story itself lasted until January 1973 (issues #212‚Äì218, then Tarzan Family #61).

Its range includes the northeastern part of Bulgarian Thrace, i.e. the regions of Burgas, Sliven, Yambol, Stara Zagora and Chirpan. As a result of the mass population movements that affected eastern Bulgaria during the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, speakers of the Subbalkan dialect have moved en masse to northeastern Bulgaria and now form a vast portion of the population of the districts of Varna, Dobrich and Balchik. Some of these also went as far as Bessarabia establishing numerous colonies there. Nowadays, a large part of the Bessarabian Bulgarians speak this dialect. The most significant feature of the Subbalkan dialect, as in all Balkan dialects, is the pronunciation of Old Church Slavonic —£ (yat) as or , depending on the character of the following syllable. Phonological and morphological characteristics * The ending of the verbs in 1st and 2nd conjugation and female nouns is -a instead of -—ä as in the Central Balkan dialect: —á–µ'—Ç–∞, –∂–µ'–Ω–∞ (I read, woman). This separates the Subbalkan dialect from most other Balkan dialects and brings it closer to the Pirdop dialect and all Western Bulgarian dialects * Ending ' for Old Church Slavonic —£ (yat) in the end of the word instead of formal Bulgarian ': –∑–ª“Ñ–∞ instead of formal Bulgarian –∑–ª–µ (badly), –¥–æ–±—Ä“Ñ–∞ instead of formal Bulgarian –¥–æ–±—Ä–µ (well) * reduction of i' into ' in an unstressed syllable before hard syllables or a consonant in the suffixes -–∏–Ω, -–∏–Ω–∞, -–∏–Ω–æ and -–∏–∫: –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä“Ñ—ä–Ω instead of formal Bulgarian –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏–Ω (a Bulgarian), –∏—Å—Ç“Ñ—ä–Ω–∞ instead of formal Bulgarian –∏—Å—Ç–∏–Ω–∞ (truth) * Transition of the consonant group -–¥–Ω into -–Ω–Ω: –≥–ª–∞–Ω–Ω–∞ vs. formal Bulgarian –≥–ª–∞–¥–Ω–∞ (hungry) * Stress on the final syllable in past aorist tense of certain verbs: –≥–ª–∏'–¥–∞—Ö (I watched) * The masculine definite article is () (in a stressed syllable) and slightly reduced a (in an unstressed syllable) - –≥—ä—ÄÀà–±—ä, Àà—Å—Ç–æ–ª–∞ (the back, the chair) * The plural definite article is -—Ç–∏ instead of formal Bulgarian -—Ç–µ: –º—ä–∂–µ—Ç–∏ instead of formal Bulgarian –º—ä–∂–µ—Ç–µ (the men) * Lack of the oblique case in proper nouns: –¥–∞–¥—É—Ö –Ω–∞ –ò–≤–∞–Ω (I gave to Ivan), cf.

The game has been nominated for several Origins and ENnie awards since its release in 2006. The main rule book is Hollow Earth Expedition. System Hollow Earth Expedition uses the Ubiquity rules, which were also created by Exile Game Studio. The main feature of the system is its use of binary dice pool rolls to determine success. Under the default rules, each even number rolled counts as a success, while odd numbers count as nothing. Odd 'nothings' do not cancel out even 'successes', making dice rolling quick and simple. This binary system has also led to the development of special Ubiquity Dice, which are not detailed below. Game setting=The surface world Hollow Earth Expedition is set in the 1930s. On the surface, everything appears as it does in our real world history books, but if you dig a little deeper you encounter secret societies and villainous organizations, many of whom have a vested interest in the Hollow Earth. Two organizations are detailed in the main rulebook: the Terra Arcana and the Thule Society. Further organizations are listed in the first expansion, Secrets of the Surface World. The Terra Arcanum is an esoteric society dedicated to keeping the Hollow Earth a secret. They have their foundations deep in the mists of time, and only a few of their current members realize their true origins. The Thule Society are based on an actual organization associated with the Nazi Party during World War II. In HEX they have a deep interest in getting into the Hollow Earth and the powerful ancient weapons they believe are kept there. The Hollow Earth The Hollow Earth boasts a wide selection of beasts and humans. Dinosaurs and other extinct creatures still live and hunt and are hunted by the various human groups who have become stranded in the Hollow Earth over the centuries. Not a great deal of detail is provided about the Hollow Earth in the main book, allowing Game Masters to customize the terrain to suit their campaign. Mysteries of the Hollow Earth expands a great deal on the denizens of Hollow Earth, including rules for beastmen of various sorts, and provides details such as a map and gazetteer for those GMs who want a more fleshed-out world, rather than the more nebulous \\"land of mysteries\\" from the core book.

He represented Victoria at interstate football in 1921 at the Western Australian Football Carnival and again in 1922 against South Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. A wingman, he captained Collingwood in the 1922 VFL season and led the club to the 1922 VFL Grand Final which they lost by 11 points to Fitzroy Football Club. Drummond was initially appointed as coach of the Williamstown Football Club in March, 1923, but owing to a delay in the permit being granted, Charlie Laxton was appointed instead. Drummond was then appointed as coach of Benalla Football Club in late March 1923. In March, 1924, it was reported that Drummond would be coaching the Murtoa Football Club in the Wimmera Football League. Concerned Benalla officials were able to intercept Drummond at the Benalla Railway Station on his way back from Queensland and told him he would not be cleared to Murtoa. Drummond then committed to coaching Benalla again in 1924 in the Ovens and Murray Football League. Benalla finished 6th on the O&MFL; ladder in 1924 under Drummond.

National Wildlife Refuge System The refuge was established in 1986, -Approved by Congress to provide for 1) conservation and management of all fish and wildlife within the refuge, 2) to fulfill the international treaty obligations of the United States with respect to fish and wildlife, and 3) to provide opportunities for scientific research, environmental education, and fish and wildlife oriented recreation, including hunting, fishing and trapping, birdwatching, nature photography, and others. Wildlife and habitat The refuge is encompassed within of hardwood swamps, lakes and bayous. The natural floodplain of the Atchafalaya River flows for south from its junction with the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico. The basin's dense bottomland hardwoods, Bald Cypress-Tupelo swamps, overflow lakes, and meandering bayous provide a tremendous diversity of habitat for more than 200 species of resident and migratory birds and numerous other wildlife and the area has been recognized as an Internationally Important Bird Area. The basin's wooded wetlands also provide vital nesting habitat for wood duck, and support the nation's largest concentration of American woodcock. Bald eagles, ospreys, swallow-tailed kites, and Mississippi kites can occasionally be seen soaring overhead. Wild turkeys, white-tailed deer, eastern gray and fox squirrels, eastern cottontail, swamp rabbit, gray and red fox, coyote, striped skunk, and Virginia opossum inhabit the refuge, as do a small remnant population of Louisiana black bears. Furbearers found in this great swamp are raccoon, mink, bobcat, coypu, muskrat, North American river otter, and American beaver. The lifeblood of the fishery is the basin's annual flooding and dewatering cycle. Overflows occur during the winter and spring rains, with many areas gradually becoming dewatered during the summer and fall. Sportfishing is popular throughout the basin. Largemouth bass, white crappie, black crappie, warmouth, bluegill, redear sunfish, and channel catfish are the primary species sought. More than 85 species of fish occur in the basin, and their populations frequently exceed 1,000 pounds per acre (100 g/m¬≤). Red swamp and white river crayfish are also important for both a sport and commercial harvest.  Refuge area  The combined area of the refuge, totaling , classified as bottomland hardwoods, contains four dominant tree species associations: (1) cottonwood and sycamore, (2) oak, gum (American sweetgum or redgum), hackberry (sugarberry or sugar hackberry), ash (swamp or water ash), (3) willow (black willow), bald cypress, pumpkin ash, (4) overcup oak, and bitter pecan or water hickory.  Flood of 2011  Due to the flooding of the Mississippi River and the opening of the Morganza Floodway the refuge was closed to the public May 14, 2011.refuge closed -KATC.com, posted May 14, 2011; Retrieved 2011-07-21 This was the first time since 1973, and prior to the refuge opening, that the Mississippi was diverted through the basin.

He was the great-great-grandfather of Norman Bethune, the Canadian physician and medical innovator, and the great-great-great- grandfather of Canadian actor Christopher Plummer. Scotland Born into a well-respected family on the Isle of Skye, he was a son of Angus Bethune and Christian, daughter of Donald Campbell (1696-1784) of Scalpay. His maternal grandfather was best remembered for his involvement in the escape of Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1746, following the Battle of Culloden. The Prince was taken to Scalpay, to the home of Donald and Catherine (MacDonald) Campbell, which was a great risk as Donald Campbell was known to have supported the cause of the House of Hanover. Nevertheless, Bethune's grandfather's innate sense of hospitality to strangers and loyalty to his wife's Jacobite family meant that he welcomed and protected the Prince, despite their religious and political differences. American Revolution Bethune needed scholarships to keep him at King's College, Aberdeen. In 1773, he was ordained and under the influence of his relation, Allan MacDonald, Laird of Kingsburgh, Skye, (the husband of the Jacobite heroine Flora MacDonald), he and his mother emigrated to North Carolina, where they lived in the same place as the MacDonalds. As a Loyalist in MacDonald's Highland Regiment, Bethune fought at the Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge in February 1776, but was captured by the victorious rebels along with a great many of MacDonald's men. He was eventually released and made his way to Montreal, where he was appointed chaplain to the 1st battalion of the 84th Regiment of Foot (Royal Highland Emigrants). Canada Williamstown In 1784, upon the demobilization of his regiment, Bethune ministered to a small band of Presbyterian Scots and in 1786 established the first Presbyterian Church on St Gabriel's Street, Montreal, which became the mother church of Presbyterianism in Canada. One year later he came to Glengarry (spelled Glengary at the time) to be among the loyalist settlers of his regiment. Settling at his home (now a national historic site, later occupied by David Thompson) in Williamstown, here he devoted the remainder of his life to his ministry. The harmonious and amicable relations among the denominations is now legendary. The Roman Catholic Bishop at St Raphael's, Alexander Macdonell, prided himself on his knowledge of Protestant prayers by which he could fill in for Bethune when needed. Family In 1782, before the close of the war, Bethune married Veronique Wadin (d. 1846), daughter of Jean-√âtienne Wadin (1738‚Äì1782), a founding partner of the North West Company. Veronique's mother was Marie-Josephe De Guire, and the sister of Marguerite, wife of Dr. John McLaughlin, Father of Oregon.

Presidency of Brazil. Retrieved on 15 February 2016 History After Portugal's Crown Prince Pedro had proclaimed the independence of Brazil from Portugal, on September 7, 1822, some troops remained loyal to Portugal. To guarantee national independence, these troops had to be defeated. To fight the troops in Bahia, Pedro established in 1823 the Emperor's Battalion. In 1825, the Emperor's Battalion was sent to Montevideo to fight at Cisplatine War. After Pedro's abdication, the Emperor's Battalion was disbanded, as all other troops directly subordinated to them. On April 7, 1933, President Get√∫lio Vargas established the Guards Battalion to protect the government's palaces. The decree determined that this battalion was the heir to Emperor's Battalion and its traditions and would use its uniforms - blue polo and white pants with a shako, boots and a brown belt - at special ceremonies and celebrations. On April 6, 1960, with the transfer of the national capital from Rio de Janeiro to Bras√≠lia, the unit changed its name to today's Presidential Guard Battalion. The most important officer of the Presidential Guard Battalion was the 2nd Lieutenant Lu√≠s Alves de Lima e Silva, the Duke of Caxias and the Patron of the Army. Presidential Guard Battalion.

He had many careers, though, including time as a Georgian politician, military officer, and bureaucrat in the United States government. While in his thirties and forties, Calhoun served in a variety of political roles in his home state of Georgia. First, he was elected as a member of Georgia state legislature in 1830. Later, Calhoun became mayor of Columbus, Georgia from 1838 to 1839. Finally, he served in the Georgia state senate from 1838 to 1840 and again in 1845. In between his terms in the state senate, he also acted as the U.S. Consul in Havana, Cuba from 1841 to 1842. Calhoun held the rank of lieutenant colonel in the US volunteers during the Mexican War. Following the war, Calhoun remained in the border region and held key positions with the U.S. government. First, the President appointed Calhoun the federal Indian Agent for the newly acquired territory of New Mexico. During his two-year tenure in that position, Calhoun used various tactics to convince or coerce Pueblo Native Americans to renounce their rights under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo as former Mexican citizens.Mangusso, Mary Childers. \\"A Study of the Citizenship Provisions of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.\\" MA Thesis, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 1966 p. 81 Calhoun claimed that he only sought to \\"protect\\" the Pueblos from their Mexican-American neighbors by excluding them from territorial affairs. At that time in New Mexico, the argument that Pueblos were citizens (but denied the right to vote) was being used to remove any federal protection from their lands and water rights so they could be sold on the open market. The Pueblo agricultural lands and water rights were some of the best in the Territory. Federal action initiated by Calhoun led to the recognition of the Pueblos by the federal government with the issuance of the Pueblo Grants pursuant to the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo. Calhoun also negotiated a treaty with several Pueblos that Congress ultimately did not adopt, primarily due to Calhoun's premature death on a trip to Washington with a Pueblo delegation, and the subsequent federal action in 1854 recognizing the Pueblos and their lands. President Millard Fillmore later appointed Calhoun as Governor of New Mexico Territory in 1851. One of his first acts as Governor was to propose laws restricting the movement of \\"free Negroes\\" into New Mexico. He garnered the support of wealthy Mexicans who feared for their own racial status in the U.S.James Brooks, Captives & Cousins: Slavery, Kinship, and Community in the Southwest Borderlands, (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2002), p. 309 Shortly after the end of his term as governor of the territory, Calhoun died of scurvy near Independence, Missouri, carrying his own coffin, while en route to Washington D.C. and eventually for his home in Georgia.

Biography Marie Elizabeth Kachel was born in 1909. Her parents were Reuben S. Kachel and M. Kathryn Zerfass Kachel. She had four sisters and one brother. She was raised on Shady Nook Farm during her early life, which was located in what is now known as the Ephrata Cloister. Her family, who were one of its last residents, often gave tours of the Ephrata Cloister, which was founded by Johann Conrad Beissel in 1732.

A pauper at death, he drowned in the Ohio River. The city turned over his body for a pauper's burial to his friend A.Z. Hamock, the only African-American undertaker in town. Hamock preserved Atkins' body in an experiment with preservatives, and occasionally displayed it after his death. Hamock's wife had custody of the remains for 45 years, during which Atkins' mummy acquired increasing notoriety. His body was finally buried in 1994, 66 years after he drowned. The event was covered by national media and TV. Biography Charles Atkins was born in Tennessee and, as an adult, moved to Kentucky to find work. Not much is known about his life. He settled in downtown Paducah as an hourly employee at a plant with ties to the tobacco industry. He gained the nickname \\"Speedy\\" at work because of his speed with handling tobacco. He was also known as a womanizer. Single and without known relatives, he befriended A. Z. Hamock, an African American who owned the city's only funeral home for blacks in the segregated city. In May 1928, Speedy went fishing and fell with his line into the Ohio River, where he drowned. The city transferred his body to Hamock's Funeral Home for a pauper's burial. Having created a powerful preservative, Hamock decided to experiment with it to preserve Atkins' body. The mixture transformed the corpse into a wooden-like statue. While Atkins' black skin was altered to a reddish color, his facial features remained recognizable.Quigley, Christine. Modern Mummies, McFarland, 1998, pp. 94-96. , . Retrieved April 17, 2009. Hamock put the preserved body of Speedy on occasional display at the funeral home; he mostly stored it in a closet. He did not charge a fee for viewers. Washed away by waters of the Ohio River during the Paducah flood of 1937, Speedy's body was recognized and returned to Hamock at his funeral home. After Hamock died in 1949, his wife Velma took over custody of Speedy's body. She kept it for another 45 years before burial. During the 66 years that Speedy's body was preserved, awareness of the mummified corpse became more widespread.

Live your dream!\\" ‚Äî George Meegan George Meegan (born 2 December 1952) is a British adventurer and alternative educator best known for his unbroken walk of the Western Hemisphere from the southern tip of South America to the northernmost part of Alaska at Prudhoe Bay. This journey on foot was of 19,019 miles (30,608 km) in 2,425 days (1977‚Äì1983) and is documented in his book The Longest Walk (1988). He received substantial media coverage (including appearances on the Today Show, CBS Morning News and Larry King Live) and was featured in numerous public speaking forums. In the course of his walk and subsequent worldwide residencies, Meegan developed a profound interest in indigenous cultures; he sought innovative ways to teach native peoples how to flourish in modern technological society while retaining their language and identity. In 2014, he wrote Democracy Reaches the Kids,Meegan, George, Democracy Reaches the Kids: Rekindling the joy of learning, Free Man Publishing Company, 2014 a book about how persons of all cultures may best learn what they truly want to know in life, naturally and joyfully, without centralized government compulsion. Meegan lives internationally and has a wife, Yoshiko, in Japan. They have two children. Early life Shortly after George was born, his father left and his mother died from cancer. He was raised by his mother's older brother, Geoffrey Meegan, a former Royal Engineer, and Geoffrey's wife, Frieda, who was an auxiliary nurse at Keycol Hill Hospital. Legally adopted at age three, George's name was changed from Killingbeck to Meegan. He grew up in Rainham, Kent, England, attending schools: Meredale, Wakeley Road, and Orchard Street. At 16, he signed on as a cadet aboard the T.S. Worcester, under the Thames Nautical Training College at Greenhithe. From there he went to sea in the Merchant Navy, first, on the MV Trecarne (1970), then the other tramp freighter Hain-Nourse, which was then a part of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O;)‚Äîembarking on his childhood ambition for a life of ‚Äòhigh adventure.‚Äô Seafaring took him to more than 100 international ports of call, including Hong Kong, Bombay, Calcutta, Melbourne, Port Elizabeth, Cape Town, Antwerp, Dar es Salaam, and Mombasa. A crossing from Japan to Chile took over 30 days. A notable incident (during his anchorage off Lagos, Nigeria) in which Meegan played an important role‚Äîmaintaining order aboard his ship, the Omar‚Äîis now called The Great Cement Scandal of 1975.Keeley, George Meegan: The Longest Walk Companion, A Biography, Free Man Pub., 2013, , Appendix- ‚ÄòNigeria Great Cement Scandal,‚Äô Letter, 18 Sept. 2013 Meegan's career at sea spanned six-and-a-half years, serving in eleven ships. He finished in 1976 as second mate in navigation. The Longest Walk Final steps of the Longest Walk, Union Jack on shoulder (1983)In 1976 Meegan retired from the Merchant Navy, beginning a several-year odyssey: walking from the bottom of South America to the top of North America, a journey captured in his self-published book The Longest Walk: The Record of Our World‚Äôs First Crossing of the Entire Americas (Xlibris). According to the book, George Meegan: * Took 41 million steps. * Wore out 12 ¬Ω pairs of Italian hiking boots. * Married his Japanese sweetheart. * Had two children. * Traversed the historically impassable Darien Gap... where he was shot at and luckily survived a knifing attack unscathed. * Visited President Jimmy Carter at his homeLangdon, Dolly, \\"A Modern Marco Polo\\", People Magazine, 10 August 1998 * Garnered 8 world records. The book was listed in Guinness World Record. In Jimmy Carter's backyard, Plains, GA (1981) In America, the ‚Äòworld walker‚Äô was preceded in town-to-town media coverage signifying that, for many Americans, while in their country, Meegan had discovered the American Dream. In 1981, Jimmy Carter invited Meegan for a chat at the president's Plains, Georgia, home.Meegan, The Longest Walk: The Record of our World‚Äôs First Crossing of the Entire Americas (Xlibris), 2008, pp. 297-9, Later that year, Meegan reached Washington, D.C., where People magazine greeted him. Friends and followers arranged several meetings with high government officials and dignitaries. The crossing continued, through the northern United States, Canada, into the Yukon, and on to the final step above the Arctic Circle. On the afternoon of 18 September 1983, he crossed a strip of tundra to the edge of the Arctic Ocean, and dipped his hand into the cold water.Meegan, The Longest Walk: An Odyssey of the Human Spirit, Dobb, Mead, 1988, , p. 19 At the age of 31, Meegan had walked 19,019 unbroken miles from end to end of two continents. Walking from Patagonia to Alaska was later done by Karl Bushby (1998 to 2006) and Holly \\"Cargo\\" Harrison (2016-2018), though they did not detour to the East Coast making their trip shorter. Publication and publicity From the Arctic, he returned to his home in England. Meegan held a 600,000-word handwritten manuscript of the journey that he felt was invaluable to the world. (After all, Meegan figured, the feat was an historic 'first crossing,' suggesting the era of European explorers. It also carried an inspirational calling to modern youth that it was still possible to 'live your dream.') After being turned down by the major houses in London, he took a job as a courier for DHL and flew to New York City aboard the Concorde. Cold knocking there on door after door with a handful of news clippings proved unsuccessful, until he met American war hero John Walker, who introduced George to Dodd, Mead and Company. The 199-year-old firm, after a series of non-familial corporate ownerships, went bankrupt. So in 2008, he self- published The Longest Walk: The Record of our World‚Äôs First Crossing of the Entire Americas. 19,019-mile route through the entire Americas Paragon Press acquired the title and the book sold well, including translations in Japan and Italy.‚ÄòInterview to George Meegan the Britishman Longest Distance Walker' , L'Italo In 1988, Dodd, Mead, which did the first Lewis and Clark journal, published the more familiar edition with Meegan's preferred subtitle The Longest Walk: An Odyssey of the Human Spirit.Meegan, The Longest Walk: An Odyssey of the Human Spirit, Dobb, Mead, 1988, The book has been converted into an audio version distributed worldwide in English-speaking countries. Following the Dodd, Mead publication, strong reviews led to appearances on the Today Show, CBS Morning News, and Larry King Live. Meegan was invited back multiple times to various programs, and held dozens of TV appearances and radio broadcasts, along with hundreds of worldwide lectures‚Äîcolleges, Rotary clubs, The Explorers Club of New York, Sing Sing Prison, Ghana, Italy, Japan, and the RMS (Royal Mail Ship) Queen Elizabeth. He was listed as an inspirational speaker by Sports Illustrated. People magazine, having produced a four-page story on him in 1981, followed with a three-page feature after the 1983 finish.Reed, Susan, \\"19,000 Miles Later, George Meegan Says His Way Is No Longer the Highway\\", People, 10 October 1983 People editor John Drake wrote that Meegan was the most unknown Bio person they ever did. (One photographer, Peter B. Kaplan, would go on to shoot world-famous pictures of the Statue of Liberty.) Following the People publicity, New Yorker, Backpacker, Voice of America, Studs Terkel, various primetime TV interviews, and numerous newspaper articles from the New York Times to the Washington Post showcased the \\"witty, clean-cut globetrotter\\". Having arrived in the United States from Britain via fourteen countries, Meegan's fascination with America grew during his millions of steps across it to Washington, D.C. Everyday citizens helped and cheered him. In frequent letters to notable politicians and public figures, Meegan extols the land's open space, an innate drive of its people to achieve, and the availability of the American Dream to all. \\"It is the national ethos of a set of ideals found nowhere else he has walked,\\" he said. \\"It includes the opportunity to prosper and succeed, and an upward social mobility achieved through hard work that is available to the common man like him, an orphan, school dropout who ran away to sea.\\"Meegan, The Longest Walk: An Odyssey of the Human Spirit, Dobb, Mead, 1988, , p. 20 Back in England, the Royal Geographical Society made him a fellow in 1983. Also in 1983 a newspaper competition for ‚ÄòThe Best Legs in UK‚Äô included Meegan. Other candidates were the captain of England's soccer team, winner of the Derby (the horse) flat race, and so on. World decathlon champion Daley Thompson won the competition, but Daley, during training from the LA 1984 Olympics, said, \\"George deserves it more.\\" So the shield for 'Champion Legs of Great Britain' was presented to George by Ernest Saunders, Chairman of Guinness. After 2,426 days, Meegan reaches the Beaufort Sea (1983) Though he earned up to a thousand dollars for each lecture, most were gratis and he needed to work to support himself. Throughout 1983‚Äì84, he worked in plaster, sheetrock, demolition, and cleaning and thus he was able to finance his way back to England, then to Japan. Meegan returned again to New York in 1988 for a promotion of the new release of The Longest Walk by Dobb, Mead. He also lectured in NYC and made other public appearances. One special occasion, 16 August 1988, at the Brooklyn end of the Brooklyn Bridge: borough president Howard Golden proclaimed George Meegan Day in Brooklyn with dancers and music.‚ÄòAmerica‚Äôs Greatest Achievement‚Äì The 11 September Memorial,‚Äô The Brooklyn Record, 20 December 1988 \\"Only in America may such a dream come true\\", said Meegan.‚ÄòInterview with George Meegan- American Dream‚Äô by Steve bo Keeley, South Palm Beach, FL, 25 September 2013 Alaska 2000 In 2000, at age 47, and 17 years after completing the 19,019-mile Longest Walk, Meegan returned to the Arctic Circle and walked almost 500 kilometers farther northwest to reach Barrow, Alaska.Reed, Susan, \\"19,000 Miles Later, George Meegan Says His Way Is No Longer the Highway\\", People Magazine, 10 October 1983 This put a finishing touch on the hike at the northernmost land point of North America. The last 14 km leg of his walk in the cold blow at -83 ¬∞F wind chill from Barrow village to Point Barrow set his 8th Guinness record for the first crossing of the Americas by any other means (besides walking)‚Äîbe it by road, ship, or airplane. On 23 January 2001, of the new millennium, Meegan reached his goal ‚Äì land's end of North America ‚Äì with about 100 Barrow villagers and adventurers from the world.Paxton, Hugh & Midori, ‚ÄòWalking into the Millennial Sunrise,‚Äô The Japan Times Life, 1 Sept. 1999. Including Lt. Col. Norman D. Vaughan, representing Mount Vaughan, Antarctica (named for him by Rear Admiral Richard Byrd). The purpose of the Alaska 2000 effort was to complete the hemispheric walk and to bring hope to the indigenous world by developing an alternative educational route whereby they could maintain their endangered culture, and yet be a part of the 21st century, and to appeal to Uncle Sam not to block the option. Homecoming with cadets after Alaska 2000 in Kobe, JapanThe year 2000 March was cancelled due to weather until the following 23 January, which is the true Millennium (the 23rd is when the new sun finally reaches Barrow, the 11th most north village in the world).

At this millennium event, in front of world media, the US government formally apologized to First Nations‚Äîthe more than 600 Aboriginal peoples spread across Canada and Alaska who are neither Inuit nor M√©tis‚Äîin a public gesture unique in American history.Meegan, \\"How the US came to apologize‚Ä¶‚Äòto the Indians.\\" 29 Jan. 2009, Letter titled ‚ÄòOfficial Apology to the Native Peoples from BIA,‚Äô Appendix- George Meegan: The Longest Walk Companion, A Biography, Keeley, Free Man Pub., 2013, \\"At Barrow on 1 January 2001, the US government via the White House and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) offered sincere apology for ‚Äòthe cowardly killing of woman and children‚Äô... and other atrocities spelled out in three-and-a-half pages read out loud.\\"Meegan, ‚ÄòA few thoughts on the unspeakable‚Äô Review of Kobe University of MM, Studies in Humanities & Social Sciences, No: 43, July, 1994, pp. 95-102, ‚ÄòThis research emerged after the reported ‚Äòethnic cleansing‚Äô and other wanton killing of innocents in the Balkans and elsewhere‚Ä¶‚Äô Legislators from both Houses of Alaska sent special personal acknowledgments as well. The Alaska 2000 project also offered the US government a school alternative whereby‚Äîvia an adjusted education‚Äîall Alaska‚Äôs First Nation cultures would be revived from extinction. The basis for this cultural/language preservation effort was a model program that Meegan had written up before Alaska 2000, which he named ‚ÄòHope from the Land of the Polar Bear.‚Äô The new program gave a route to save the threatened Aleut, Athabaskan, Inupiaq, Tlingit, Tsimshian and Yupik languages. The key, Meegan judged, was a culture-based curriculum. Teaching would be primarily in the indigenous languages, along with English (or Spanish, etc.), and accompanied by all necessary tools for successful living in the 21st century. His aim was \\"to prevent language extinction\\".Meegan, ‚ÄòA strategic new direction for cultural survival,‚Äô Review of Kobe University of Mercantile Marine Part 1 Studies in Humanities and Social Sciences, No: 44 October 1995, pp. 51-63, Education & Cultural Survival, received by, Edna Ahgeak MacLean, PhD, president Illiksagvik College His culture-based curriculum is also called Democracy Reaches the Kids, for which the US government awarded its highest endorsement, the E11 visa.‚ÄòEvidence of Extraordinary Ability,‚Äô Jeansch Immigration Law Firm, p. 2 Meegan accepted the E11, an honorary citizenship from Barrow, and left Alaska with the gift of 100-year-old sacred eagle feather. Also the lesson that, at root, modern schooling is acting as a ‚Äòcultural destruction agent,‚Äô which can be corrected by a ‚Äòsnowroots‚Äô demonstration led by one person. Meegan left Barrow for Japan, England, and, currently, the indigenous children of the Ecuador Amazon. Democracy Reaches the Kids In 2000, when Meegan moved after the Alaska 2000 from Barrow back to Japan, he reacclimatized to professorial duties and his family. He taught in the Kobe University department of Maritime Science and lectured frequently worldwide.Kobe University, George Meegan, Associate Professor, http://www.yatedo.com/p/George+Meegan/normal/fadfcb2ce9b7ad0822f852e75604f658 He also began to piece together film footage of the Alaska 2000 to produce the documentary Hope from the Land of the Polar Bear (2002).Meegan, Hope from the Land of the Polar Bear, Review of Kobe University of MM, Part 1 Studies in Humanities and Social Sciences, No: 50 July 2001, \\"Last Defence of Native Cultures,\\" pp. 93-118.

George, in the next decade, carried the slim book with him wherever he went in the hope that it might register with someone and see its revolutionary educational possibility. As associate professor at Kobe (50) ‚Äî enrollment 16,000 in 2013, 10% international‚ÄîGeorge taught students to be ships‚Äô officers, and he lectured widely on maritime science on topics from shipboard English to navigation, in and out of Japan\\"Ship-Board English for Non-native Students- The Kobe Abridged SMCP,\\" at International Maritime Lectures Association (IMLA) 16th, Izmir, Turkey, 14‚Äì17 October 2008... and raised his family. From the university he led 45 students to Alaska in 2000, and then again in 2001. After 2002, Meegan moved about the world \\"with a purpose,\\" but always returned to Japan and his students until 2011. From these worldwide journeys emerged the principles of Democracy Reaches the Kids (DRTK)‚Äîbeginning with the question, \\"What does each individual child, at the beginning of that great challenge and adventure we call life, need to be successful in the 21st century?\\" The aim is for education to encompass the whole world of the childhood experience, especially for those kids who do not fit in (like Meegan himself), with holistic education.Meegan, \\"Action for Children- Beginning ‚Äòthose that don‚Äôt fit in,'\\" Letter, 1 March 2009, Appendix- George Meegan: The Longest Walk Companion, A Biography, Keeley, Free Man Pub., 2013, Though DRTK was never put out for public sale, George distributed them continually while resupplying from the Bangkok publisher.Crook, Matt, \\"Bangkok, City of Sex, Scandal and Wannabe Authors,\\" CNN Travel, 21 Sept. 2012, http://travel.cnn.com/bangkok/life/bangkoks-expat-authors-650113 DRTK proposes that environment‚Äîboth local and planetary‚Äîis the key in the battle of nature and nurture. The six-month pilot program for communities includes environment, culture, health, communication, computer, and social skills, plus a bit of money management. Then the distinguishing topics: talents, inspiration, activities, dreams... inherent to each child, which modern state schooling ignores or suppresses. Meegan suggests that the framework of DRTK enables the individual to soar beyond the nation, while creating an informed and caring citizenry.

The E1 visa applicant must possess extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, business, athletics, or as in the case of George, education. Expertise must be demonstrated by sustained national or international acclaim, and whose achievements are recognized in the field through extensive documentation, such as a Nobel Prize or Olympic Gold Medal. After intense review, the US Justice Department recognized Democracy Reaches the Kids by granting it the only extraordinary-capacity US visa ever issued in child education reform. The E11 does not expire and is a mark of prestige and welcome at any educational institution worldwide. Japan years The Meegans (George, Yoshiko, w/kids Geoffrey and Ayumi), shown here at the end of the Longest Walk (1983)Meegan lived in Kobe, Japan for most of the period between 1991 until 2010. He had met his wife, Yoshiko Matsumoto, in 1975 when he had to join a ship in Japan and so crossed from UK on the Trans-Siberian Railway. While hitchhiking to the ship in Kobe, George was picked up by Yoshiko, then they stayed in touch by mail for two years until he decided to break the long- distance hiking record held by David Kwan (18,500 miles).Toledo Blade 10 Jan. 1979 ‚ÄòPeach Section- Guinness Record‚Äô David Kahn As he mapped a route, he wrote about his plan to Yoshiko. She was unhappily employed in an office and trying to escape a prearranged marriage. She flew to London thinking George's trip would be by bus, and was shocked to find it was to be on foot. Nevertheless, she joined Meegan on his first step from Tierra del Fuego in 1977 with nearly 20,000 miles to go to reach the arctic. Since neither could speak the other's language, they couldn‚Äôt hold a conversation during the walk. Just 300 yards and Yoshiko stopped, sat down on the mud strip road, and started to cry. He proclaimed, \\"Don‚Äôt worry, love, only another 19,000 miles to go!\\" Yoshiko changed her mind to continue when, shortly, an escaped convict pointed a revolver at her head. They escaped, and walked over three weeks to the Strait of Magellan, which separates Tierra del Fuego from the South American mainland. Once across, George calculated they must cover 1,200 miles in three months or be marooned by the snows in the Argentine winter. Once on the mainland, they agreed that Yoshiko would hitchhike ahead across the desolate plateaus. Each night in the physical emptiness, she pitched camp, and waited, until nearing the tent in the dark, George would shine his tiny flashlight, and she hers, at each other. There was a happy reunion each night, and they fell in love all the way up to Alaska. Pausing in Mendoza, Argentina, they married. By the completion of the Longest Walk in 1983, Yoshiko had birthed a son and daughter during timeouts in Japan, as George marched the unbroken route up the Americas. After the walk, they reunited in Toki, Gifu, where her parents lived. George taught English, like a lot of other foreigners do, until a full Professor at Kobe University in Maritime Science told George that because of his background at the ‚ÄòUniversity of High Seas‚Äô, they were bringing him to Kobe, where he became an associate professor. George had left school at age 16, so it was the only degree he ever earned. It was the first ‚Äòprofessor‚Äô rank granted to a non-university graduate in Japan since the Meiji Revolution of 1859.\\"George Meegan Interview- At Kobe U in Japan\\" by Steve bo Keeley,‚Äô Iquitos, Peru, FL, 29-31 Aug. 2013 As the book The Longest Walk took off with readership around the world, during his 17-year tenure at Kobe, Japan took the lead.

As the only Westerner on faculty on the maritime side of the grounds, Meegan, 5‚Äô 10\\", 150 pounds and with blonde hair, stood out. He reported that the kids often told him he was the best teacher in their experience. At present, Japanese students go to study English in Portland or Disneyland. However, in George's time he took them and students from other departments on major expeditions in the Alaska Labrador, and such places that were in his real situation. The most publicized was to the Alaska 2000 event‚Äî\\"the most significant international adventures from Kobe U since WWII.\\"Keeley, George Meegan: The Longest Walk Companion, A Biography, Free Man Pub., 2013, 'Trips from Kobe U,' 1 Aug. 2013, One of the most enduring contributions to the MS department was the creation of an abridged version of the United Nation's International Maritime Organization (IMO) benchmark Standard Marine Communication Phrases that was the bulky benchmark. His replacement title, SHIPBOARD ENGLISH for Young Seafarers, was an important step in worldwide Maritime Education and Training.Meegan, ‚ÄòShip Board English for Japanese Pilots‚Äô with Glossary of Maritime English,‚Äô Review of Graduate School of Maritime Sciences, Kobe University, July 2008, No 5.

It was called The Kobe One Page Basic English DictionaryMeegan, The Kobe One Page Basic English Dictionary, Appendix of Keeley, George Meegan: The Longest Walk Companion, A Biography, Free Man Pub., 2013, and has 2,000 words, and was later published as Basic English One Page (VirtualBookWorm, 2013).\\"Want to Publish Your Book?,\\" VirtualBookWorm Publisher, http://virtualbookworm.com/ He still uses the One-Page Dictionary during travels to teach English to non- speakers, handing it to hold rather than a seven-pound Random House Webster's Dictionary.Meegan, Basic English One Page, VirtualBookWorm, 2013, Throughout the 2000s, George taught, wrote, lectured, and made a documentary Hope from the Land of the Polar Bear (2002), and raised his children. During this time, Japan was awash in the phenomenon of Hikikomori, which literally means ‚Äòshutting out the sun.‚ÄôZielenziger, Michael, Shutting Out the Sun: How Japan Created Its Own Lost Generation, Vintage, 2007, BBC did a program \\"Japan: The Missing Millions\\" (2002)Rees, Phil, \\"Mystery of the Missing Millions,\\" BCC News, 20 Oct. 2002, http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/correspondent/2334893.stm that describes millions of teenage boys in Japan's cities turning into hermits, and never leaving their rooms. Pressure from schools and an inability to talk to their families were the suggested causes. With his own children in the midst of peer pressure to withdraw, Meegan fought back with a written abstract titled \\"Hikikomori: New Approach of Hope\\"Meegan, \\"Hikkikomori: New Approach of Hope\\" Review of Graduate School of Maritime Sciences, Kobe University, July 2010, pp. 1-12 dealing with the country adolescents pulling inward by seeking extreme degrees of isolation.Toyoda, Natsuko, \\"Shutting out the sun: Hikikomori,\\" Japan Spotlight, August 2008, p. 38, http://www.jef.or.jp/backnumber/160th_promenade.pdf He noted that Hikikomori is not just a condition of Japan, though in sheer numbers it leads, but is growing throughout the world. Similar problems are emerging in his own Great Britain and the Asian tigers of Hong Kong and South Korea. Then, in a follow- up paper \\"A Blueprint for a Way Forward,\\" he summarized his solution. He would set up a program to harness the power of youth and youth dreams, to haul them out, step by step, from the darkness. The program would be a trajectory to educate, good citizenship, and a happier life. He spoke of the flattened lives being pulled up by the principles of Democracy Reaches the Kids. It is a simple alternative curriculum whereby the kids who don‚Äôt fit in are given a clear alternative route through education, and to success in society.Meegan, \\"Hikikomori Conclusion,\\" https://georgemeegan.wordpress.com/category/democracy-reaches-the-kids/ Both children grew up in Japan and became bilingual. Geoffrey left at thirteen to attend the famous alternative Summerhill School under head Zoe ReadheadRedhead, Zoe, 'Summerhill by Zoe Readhead', http://www.summerhillschool.co.uk/pages/summerhill_by_zoe.html in Suffolk, England.Neill, A.S., Summerhill School: A New Look at Childhood, St. Martin's Griffin, 1995, The Summerhill philosophy embraced Meegan's own that children learn best with freedom from concern and a strong voice in the classroom. Lessons are optional, and pupils are free to choose what to do with their time. The function of the school is to encourage a child to live his own life, rather than a life according to the purpose of an educator. Geoffrey also studied martial arts, was known for his sense of humor, and led his father's 44 Japanese students in Barrow at the Alaska 2000. Daughter Ayumi, which literally means ‚Äòwalking‚Äô in Japanese, was a scholar, and liked jazz.‚ÄòAyumi Meegan - Jazz singer appears in Kobe, 30 Aug. 2011, YouTube, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHnp57_wiYk After graduating high school in Kobe, she moved to San Francisco and performed jazz, travelling also to perform. She sang *The Star-Spangled Banner\\" in front of 2000 folks, plus VIPs, at the annual dinner and press conference for her father hosted by the Explorers at the NY Waldorf Astoria Hotel. George Meegan's position as Assistant Professor at the Japan Marine University in Kobe ended in 2011. There was a retirement ceremony and display of his photo record of eighteen years on faculty. The forty plus albums of his time are currently held at the Kobe University Archive.Keeley, George Meegan: The Longest Walk Companion, A Biography, Free Man Pub., 2013, \\"At Kobe U,\\" Letter, 15 October 2013, This has not been done for any faculty member before or since, and Meegan attributes the honour to the special activities he did with students at and away from campus. The sweeping record promotes him, as well as the university.Keeley, George Meegan: The Longest Walk Companion, A Biography, Free Man Pub., 2013, 'At Kobe U', Letter, 15 October 2013, Free from teaching, Meegan sought a change from the safe urban geographic and Cultural Landscapes of Japan. While his family stayed on in Japan, and later England, George set off, as ever, for new horizons. The first stop was Bethel, Alaska. Bethel, in central Alaska, 400 miles west of Anchorage has access only by air and the Kuskokwim River. It is the main port and transportation hub for 58 villages on the Yukon‚ÄìKuskokwim Delta. Ten years earlier, in 1990, George and son Geoffrey had slept behind the couch of an old friend in Barrow named Rex WilhelmAlaska Commercial Company, Inside View, President: Rex Wilhelm, http://www.insideview.com/directory/alaska-commercial-company who had since become president of the historic Alaska Commercial. George told Mr. Wilhelm about the destruction of the Eyak culture, and how he could stop it and other such tragedies. Wilhelm immediately suggested Bethel. He gave George a job as a shoe clerk 'grade 3' at his Bethel shoe store from Christmas 2011 to Christmas 2012 that paid him to reach Ecuador in early 2013 and attempt to launch Operation Safeguard to save the indigenous languages of Amazonia. He left with a deep regard for Bethel community which he calls the capital of Yupik America. He has many friends, and claims they always return there to be among the friendliest people he has met in the world.Keeley, George Meegan: The Longest Walk Companion, A Biography, Free Man Pub., 2013, , Appendix- ‚ÄòBethel‚Äô Letter, 1 Oct. 2013 It was in Bethel, in 2012, while in good health, that he selected his burial plot.

Politics Pena portrait at NY Explorers Club (1988)During his last year of teaching in Japan, Meegan took his university leave to England and ran for the UK Parliament. Using Democracy Reaches the Kids as a platform, Meegan ran for 2010 general election as a non- political Independent by gathering 109 personal votes for the constituency of Gillingham and Rainham, where he grew up as boy. It is more accurate to say he bicycled rather than ran for office:\\"The Walking Fool - George Meegan,\\" 19 June 2012, http://thewalkingfool.blogspot.com/2010/06/george-meegan.html > \\"All a wonderful adventure; and yes, I stood in the General Election for > where I grew-up as a boy!

One day in Japan, Meegan's boy, Geoffrey, was in tears because the school was telling him \\"how bad he was.\\" So, his father resolved to find a way so that all students could be happy and proud for whom they are. He imagined a world where all children could have their uniqueness, and what they can do be celebrated, rather than being judged and life blighted by what they cannot do. Democracy equals no more children made unhappy by school, ever. He wrote, \\"This is what I fight for every single day of my life remaining.\\" Meegan's roll into politics started in the northernmost cabin in the United States at Helmericks, on the Colville River (Alaska).'At Colville Village', Helmericks Family, http://www.goldenplover.org/ He took Geoffrey there in 1990, away from the constrained Japanese classrooms, for a fresh perspective on life. Helmericks is a family homestead village, and the two Meegans increased the town population for by 30% from 6 to 8 people during a one-month stay. His son helped Meegan organize the notes for Democracy Reaches the Kids, and the book was published later that year. One of its earliest supporters was celebrated NY teacher John Taylor Gatto, who used notes from Meegan's book and carried them protected in laminations with him during his lecture days.Gatto, John Taylor, \\"The Odysseus Group,\\" 2004, p. 7, http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/chapters/18g.htm As for politics, Meegan believes that education shouldn't actually have any connection with politics, as would be with democracy kids. In democratic classrooms that would be the case. Each kid would have a framework, as President Clinton said, \\"to become the best that they can be.\\" Letter canvassing to the general public followed the book publication, and especially to select dignitaries. In a letter to the public titled \\"Democracy Reaches the Kids!\\" (2009), the author outlined his plan to Save the Children, and therefore to change the planet:Meegan, \\"Not One More Unhappy Schoolchild Ever!,\\" Review of Kobe University of MM, Studies in Humanities & Social Sciences, No: 45, July, 1996. pp. 1-27 > \\"My vision is to gather together kids who have been lost to education and > use this bottom level group, one of whom none in education can doubt that > they have 'failed'.

He wrote in a 2011 campaign letter to US Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords: \\"USA: best miracle medicine in the whole wide world.

He took his text and scrapbook to describe a kickstart program for all the indigenous tribes of Amazonia. The pilot project aims to teach the kids what they need know to live in the modern world while keeping their culture intact. The six-month program will be filmed inside the classroom and, once completed, Meegan will incorporate the footage into a documentary. The objective is to seed Democracy Reaches the Kids to educational institutions around the world via YouTube.Keeley, George Meegan: The Longest Walk Companion, A Biography, 2013, Free Man Pub, Letter \\"Save the Indigenous Children of Ecuador,\\" 16 Oct. 2013, The search for a site in 2013 targeted the Amazonia mountain village of Puyo, the capital of Pastaza Province.Keeley, George Meegan: The Longest Walk Companion A Biography, 2013, Free Man Pub, Letter \\"Save the Indigenous Children of Ecuador,\\" 16 Oct. 2013, In June, 2013, Meegan flew from his annual swing in the United States (to sanction the E11 visa), and on to the Ecuador capital of Quito. He saw a colour picture in the Visiones newspaper of a Waorani with seven spears pushed through him. Studying the photo and reading the report, Meegan thought that these people needed his help. The story was heralded as Puyo, so there he went on a five-hour bus to the jungled mountainside town of 27,000, including many Waorani tribe. The Waorani or Huaorani, also known as the Waos, are Native Americans of the Amazonian who have marked differences, such as language, culture, and a deep identification with the Jaguar, from other ethnic groups from Ecuador. In the last 40 years, they have shifted from a hunting and gathering society to live mostly in permanent forest settlements such as Puyo. [According to myth, the Waorani are the descendants of a mating between a jaguar and an eagle. In their belief system, a jaguar shaman is able ‚Äòto become‚Äô a jaguar.]\\"Waorani People,\\" Shiripuno Research, p. 1, http://www.shiripunoresearch.org/index.php/waorani-people The store of botanical knowledge among the tribe is extensive, ranging from poisons to hallucinogens. In 1956, a group of five American missionaries made contact with the Huaorani in what was known as Operation Auca, in which they lowered gifts in a basket from a plane to initiate friendly contact. Two days later, all five of the missionaries were killed in a Huaorani spearing raid. Meegan, aware of the precedent spearing where he was going, was more alarmed by the nation's bureaucratic indecision. Despite Quito media reports of other alleged Huaorani attacks, Meegan made his visit. Meegan calls his pilot program \\"Operation Safeguard: Hope to the Indigenous Tribes of Amazonia\\".Meegan, The Longest Walk 3rd Edition, 2013, Free Man Pub, Introduction by the Author 2013, ix, On arrival in Puyo, he arranged meetings among the tribe and on 6 June 2013, presented a lecture called \\"Stealing the Fire\\" to the Quito Ministry of Higher Education. It was applauded and put him into the familiar Ecuador ‚Äòslow roll‚Äô of bureaucratic promises with delays. Then, on 17 September 2013, in a speech titled \\"Save the Indigenous Children of Ecuador\\" to Puyo teachers and Waorani, he explained that the Constitution of Ecuador \\"Guarantees the Nationalities of the indigenous tribes, however the education policy (as is common throughout the world) cannot support that guarantee.\\"\\"Interview with George Meegan- The Ecuador Project,\\" by Steve bo Keeley, South Palm Beach, FL, 25 Sept. 2013 The aim in Puyo is to better the world through the children, primarily by preserving their indigenous languages and teaching them the lessons for living in modern times. This is designed after a successful model he set up in Barrow following the Alaska 2000 event and subsequent US government aid. Operation Safeguard in Ecuador is based on what he calls Preventable Language Extinction. In Alaska, after the 2008 loss of Eyak when the last native speaker died,Alaska Native Language Center, University of Alaska Fairbanks, ‚ÄòThe last remaining native speaker of Eyak died in 2008,‚Äô http://www.uaf.edu/anlc/languages/ey/ no action had yet been taken to check this fast approaching extinction of several other Alaska First Nation languages. With a similar threat among the Amazonian tribes, Meegan suggests that the only thing left to stem the demise of the tribes is a shift to a culture based curriculum. The foundation of culture is languages, and these would be defended in courses taught in the native tongues. Other classroom focuses would include environment, social, computer, Spanish, and requirements for modern living. The syllabus is outlined in Democracy Reaches the Kids. At age 14, Meegan's son, Geoffrey, and his sister set out to walk across India from Bombay to Madras. During the 5-month trip, Ayumi became friends with Mother Teresa. She wrote Santa Pont‚Äôa Journey (2009)Ayumi Meegan, Santa Ponta‚Äôs Journey, https://www.amazon.com/Santa-Pontas-Journey-Ayumi- Meegan/dp/1434386023 in English and Japanese about a young boy who embarks on foot in search to find God. In 2013, in London, Geoffrey was diagnosed with Parkinson's, and currently lives in London with the help of his family. Meegan, in Ecuador, awaits a decision from the Ministry of Education so to begin his work among the peoples he first met 35 years before. It seems The Longest Walk is not finished after all.

Biography  His parents came at Chilioara, SƒÉlaj from Craciunel, Co»ôeiu, SƒÉlaj County. Alimpiu Barbulovici was born to Alexandru Barbolovici (1807 ‚Äì 19 January 1869) and Sofia Pop (they got married in 1831) on August 6, 1843. He attended school in »òimleu Silvaniei, Cluj, Satu Mare, Trnava, and Central Seminary in Budapest. He was a priest at Gherla, Bor»ôa, Cluj and on 6 September 1873 was appointed vicar of »òimleu Silvaniei. The two general assemblies of Astra took place in Simleu, on 6 August 1878 and 6 August 1908, under his leadership. He was among the most active supporters of the Transylvanian Memorandum. He attended the courses of the general and secondary school in »òimleu Silvaniei. On September 1, 1850, he was enrolled in the 7th grade at the Piarist Gymnasium in Cluj, and on September 14, 1852 he was sent by Alexandru Sterca- »òulu»õiu to complete his high school studies, in Trnava (Slovakia). After graduation from gymnasium, it was also sent by Metropolitan Alexandru Sterca- »òulu»õiu to the Central Seminary in Budapest, to study theology. In 1858 he returned from Budapest and was appointed an official in the Diocesan Chancellery of Gherla, with a perspective to become a professor of theology. However, he did not accept the teaching career, and in the summer of 1859 he was appointed a priest in Bor»ôa commune, Cluj. Barbulovici was a part of the priesthood without wealth. He was a member of the school senate of Doboka County. In 1861 he was invited to the National Congress of Astra in Sibiu, but it is not known if he participated. On September 6, 1873 the bishop of Gherla has appointed A. Barbulovici the vicar of Silvania, the parish of »òimleului, the protopop of Crasna and Valcau. Like Demetriu Coroianu, he was also president of the Department of Astra in Silvania, at those two general meetings of Astra in 1878 and 1908 in »òimleu taking place under his leadership. In 1871 he was elected the president of the \\"Astrei\\" of Salaj Department. As president he organized two general meetings in Simlu: the first on August 6, 1878, and the second on August 6, 1908. On May 15, 1874, he was also elected the president of the \\"Meeting of the Salajeni Romanian Teachers\\", a position that he held for 11 years. Since 1881 he has been a founding member and a reliable member of the \\"Meeting of Romanian Women in Salajene\\", since 1888 he was a founding member and the first president of the \\"Silvana\\" Institute of Credit and Economics, a lifetime member of the Society for the creation of a Romanian theater fund. At his home in Simleu it was decided who would be part of the delegation that was to take the Memorandum of the Romanians to Vienna in 1892. Also in the time of Barboloviciu's pastorate, in 1893, in the new church in Simleu was painted and placed iconostasis. Alimpiu Barboloviciu was the longest-serving in the position of foreign vicar of Salaj (1873‚Äì1913); he was followed by Alexandru Ghetie (1914‚Äì1922). He held a continuous correspondence with George Bari»õ and other personalities of the time. He has collaborated with several magazines: \\"Sionul Rom√¢n\\", \\"Amvonul\\", \\"Church, literary and scholastic sheet\\", etc. Barboloviciu had 3 children: Virgil sub-judge; Cornel engineer; Simion theologian ‚Äì la Gherla. His wife, an active member of the Committee of the Salajene Women's Meeting, died on June 27, 1896. On January 19, 1914, the vicar of Silvania move to Bocsa, Salaj, where his son Simion Barbulovici was a priest. On this occasion, in his honor, a ceremony was held at the vicarage house in »òimleu Silvaniei. He has died from pneumonia on December 10, 1914. His body was placed in the courtyard of the wooden church in Bocsa, near the tomb of Simion BƒÉrnu»õiu.

It was produced by Waheed himself and directed by his close friend Iqbal Yousuf. Waheed Murad died leaving this film incomplete. It was later completed by Iqbal Yousuf using 'cheat shot' techniques and released after two years of Waheed's death on 11 January 1985 countrywide. In those days, Waheed Murad was in trouble and was being cast in either supporting roles or being offered by 'B-class' film directors. So he decided to produce his own film and chosen his best friend Iqbal Yousuf as film director. The script and story was written by Waheed himself. Waheed's expectations were high for this film, as he once said in an interview in Anwar Maqsood's programme 'Silver Jubilee': Synopsis Hero is a romantic and action movie. Waheed Murad played double role in this film. It is based on a story of two different persons but with similar faces, one is very innocent and the other is a gangster. Release Hero was released on 11 January 1985, i.e., after two years of Waheed Murad's death. The film was released on Lyric Cinema of Karachi and Firdous Cinema of Hyderabad. The film had average success and completed 35 weeks on cinemas with 5 weeks on main cinemas and thus became a Silver Jubilee film. Filming During those days, Waheed Murad was depressed, frustrated and suffered from his illness. He had to undergo for a stomach removal surgery. After surgery, he recovered, but lost significant amount of weight, which could be seen in Hero. Babra Sharif revealed that during filming of a scene of Hero, Waheed lost his balance while walking briskly toward her and fell down. He took several minutes to catch his breath prior to standing up on his feet again. In July 1983, Waheed also had a car accident, which left a large scar on his face. He moved to Karachi to get the scar fixed (plastic surgery) in order to complete the last few scenes of Hero, but died one day before his surgery. Music The music of the film was composed by M.

The Mexican miracle () is a term used to refer to the country's inward-looking development strategy that produced sustained economic growth. It is considered to be a golden age of capitalism in Mexican economics in which the Mexican economy grew 4% each year. It was a stabilizing economic plan which caused an average growth of 6.8% and industrial production to increase by 8% with inflation staying at only 2.5%. Beginning roughly in the 1940s, the Mexican government would begin to roll out the economic plan that they would call \\"the Mexican miracle,\\" which would spark an economic boom beginning in 1954 spanning some 15 years and would last until 1970. In Mexico, the Spanish economic term used is \\"Desarrollo estabilizador\\" or \\"Stabilizing Development.\\" Conditions for sustained growth An important factor helping sustained growth in the period 1940‚Äì1970 was the reduction of political turmoil, particularly around national elections, with the creation of a single, dominant party. In 1946, the party founded by Plutarco El√≠as Calles in the wake of President-elect √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n's assassination in 1928 changed its name to the Institutional Revolutionary Party. With the party's presidential choice in 1946, Miguel Alem√°n Vald√©s, Mexico elected its first civilian president since Francisco I. Madero in 1911. The subsequent elections of Adolfo Ruiz Cortines (1952‚Äì58) and Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos (1958‚Äì64), Gustavo D√≠az Ordaz (1964‚Äì70) there were no political opposition challenges to the government's implementation of economic programs. During the presidency of L√°zaro C√°rdenas, there were significant policies in the social and political spheres that had impacts on future economic policies in Mexico, in particular nationalization of oil in 1938, as well as land reform, and nationalization of railways.Howard F. Cline, Mexico: Revolution to Evolution, 1940‚Äì1960. Oxford: Oxford University Press 1962, p. 231. C√°rdenas was succeeded by the politically more moderate Manuel √Åvila Camacho, who initiated a program of industrialization in early 1941 with the Law of Manufacturing Industries. One scholar has called the inaugural date of this law \\"the birthday of the Institutional Revolution,\\" since it was the inception of import substitution industrialization.Cline, Mexico: Revolution to Evolution, p. 232. Further legislation in 1946 under President Miguel Alem√°n Vald√©s, the Law for Development of New and Necessary Industries, was passed.Sanford Mosk, Industrial Revolution in Mexico. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1950. \\"In the long view, some of the permanent alterations in Mexico from World War II were economic.\\"Howard F. Cline, The United States and Mexico, revised edition. New York: Atheneum Press, 1962, p. 184. Mexico benefited significantly during World War II, by its participation on the side of the Allies. Mexico supplied labor to the U.S. via the Bracero Program, but its most significant contribution was in its supply of material to fight the war. It received cash payments for its material contributions, which meant that following the war the Mexican treasury had robust reserves. Although a participant in the war, like the U.S., Mexico was not a site of combat, so that in the post-war era, Mexico did not need to rebuild damaged infrastructure. However, with the resources available following the war, Mexico embarked on big infrastructure projects. √Åvila Camacho used part of the accumulated savings to pay off foreign debts, so that Mexico's credit standing substantially improved (increasing investors' confidence in the government). With increased revenues coming from the war effort, the government was now in a position to distribute material benefits from the Revolution more widely; he used funds to subsidize food imports that especially affected urban workers. Workers in Mexico received higher salaries during the war, but there was a lack of consumer goods to purchase, so that workers had both personal savings and pent up demand for goods. A key government institution for development, founded under L√°zaro C√°rdenas's administration was Nacional Financiera (abbreviated Nafin), the national development bank, which funded the expansion of the industrial sector.Cline, The United States and Mexico, p. 286. Growth was sustained by the government's increasing commitment to primary education for the general population from the late 1920s through the 1940s. The enrollment rates of the country's youth increased threefold during this period;Easterlin, R. \\"Why Isn't the Whole World Developed?\\", Appendix Table 1. The Journal of Economic History Vol. 41 No. 1, 1981 consequently when this generation was employed by the 1940s their economic output was more productive. Mexico also made investments in higher education that created a generation of scientists, social scientists, and engineers, who enabled Mexican industrial innovation. The founding of the Instituto Polit√©cnico Nacional (IPN) in 1936 as a government-funded institution in the northern part of Mexico City, trained a new generation of Mexicans. In northern Mexico, the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, known in Mexico as the Tec de Monterrey was founded by northern industrialists in 1942, with the programs designed by a former faculty member of the IPN and modeled after the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. From a small, private inception, the Tec de Monterrey built a major campus inaugurated by President Alem√°n in 1946, and has been a magnet for students from other areas of Latin America.Cline, The United States and Mexico, p. 301. Import-substitution program and infrastructure projects In the years following World War II, President Miguel Alem√°n Vald√©s (1946‚Äì52) instituted a full-scale import-substitution program which stimulated output by boosting internal demand. The government raised import controls on consumer goods but relaxed them on capital goods (such as machinery for Mexican production of consumer goods), which it purchased with international reserves accumulated during the war. The government spent it heavily on infrastructure, including major dam projects to produce hydroelectric power, supply drinking water to cities and irrigation water to agriculture, and control flooding.Cline, Mexico: Revolution to Evolution, pp. 68‚Äì81. By 1950 Mexico's road network had expanded to 21,000 kilometers, of which some 13,600 were paved.Cline, Mexico: Revolution to Evolution, pp. 63‚Äì66. The economic stability of the country, high credit rating allowing borrowing, an increasingly educated work force, and savings allowing purchase of consumer goods were excellent conditions for the government's program of import substitution industrialization. Finished goods previously purchased abroad could be produced domestically with the purchase of machinery. One successful industry was textile production. Foreign transnational companies established branches in Mexico, such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, and Sears (Mexico) under Mexican laws regulating foreign investment.Daniel James, \\"Sears Roebuck's Mexican Revolution,\\" Harper's Magazine (June 1959) 1‚Äì6. The automotive industry in Mexico already had been established shortly after the end of the military phase of the Mexican Revolution, with Buick became the first automobile producer to be officially established in Mexico in 1921. In 1925, Ford Motor Company was too established and began manufacturing vehicles in the country. With a growing middle class consumer market for such expensive consumer goods, the industrial base of Mexico expanded to meet the demand. The government fostered the development of consumer goods industries directed toward domestic markets by imposing high protective tariffs and other barriers to imports. The share of imports subject to licensing requirements rose from 28 percent in 1956 to an average of more than 60 percent during the 1960s and about 70 percent in the 1970s. Industry accounted for 22 percent of total output in 1950, 24 percent in 1960, and 29 percent in 1970. The share of total output arising from agriculture and other primary activities declined during the same period, while services stayed constant. The government promoted industrial expansion through public investment in agricultural, energy, and transportation infrastructure. Cities grew rapidly during these years, reflecting the shift of employment from agriculture to industry and services. The urban population increased at a high rate after 1940. Growth of the urban labor force exceeded even the growth rate of industrial employment, with surplus workers taking low-paying service jobs. Economic performance Mexico's strong economic performance continued into the 1960s, when GDP growth averaged about 7 percent overall and about 3 percent per capita. Consumer price inflation averaged only 3 percent annually. Manufacturing remained the country's dominant growth sector, expanding 7 percent annually and attracting considerable foreign investment. Mining grew at an annual rate of nearly 4 percent, trade at 6 percent, and agriculture at 3 percent. By 1970 Mexico had diversified its export base and become largely self-sufficient in food crops, steel, and most consumer goods. Although its imports remained high, most were capital goods used to expand domestic production.

Chaffey represented the electoral district of Tamworth from 1940 to 1973. He also served as the New South Wales Minister for Agriculture from 1965 to 1968. Chaffey succeeded his father, Frank in parliament after the latter's death, and together they served a combined fifty-nine years and nine months in the New South Wales parliament representing the New England region of New South Wales. Biography William Adolphus Chaffey was born in Tamworth, New South Wales on 18 February 1915 to Frank Augustus Chaffey, himself a member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, and Amy McIlveen. He was educated at Tamworth Public School, The King's School, and Hawkesbury Agricultural College. He subsequently returned to the Tamworth district and began farming there before his election to parliament. On 16 December 1941, in his first term in parliament, he joined the Australian Imperial Force. He served in the 2/5th Independent Company, and was twice mentioned in despatches, as well as winning the United States' Bronze Star Medal. In 1948, he became a member of the Australian Citizens Military Forces, remaining there until 1961. On 29 January 1946 William Adolphus Chaffey married Patricia Egerton-Warburton at Mount Barker. They would eventually have two daughters and one son. In politics On the death of his father, Frank Augustus Chaffey, William won his father's seat at the 1940 Tamworth by-election, as a member of the United Australia Party. In 1941, he was challenged for UAP preselection; however, like his father, who had never submitted to a party preselection vote, he refused to submit to an internal preselection contest. He instead contested and won the seat against his challenger as an independent. He was then re-elected unopposed in 1944 as an independent due to his active military service, having enlisted in 1941. He remained an independent until he formally joined the Country Party on 4 December 1945. Chaffey was the deputy leader of the Country Party from 1959 to 1968. He was Minister for Agriculture in the first term of the Askin government from 1965 to 1968. He was deposed as deputy leader by Davis Hughes in 1968 and dropped from the ministry in the aftermath, despite the support of the Primary Producers' Union. Always known for being independently minded, Chaffey was reported to have become increasingly estranged from his Country Party colleagues after his 1968 ouster.

For information on currently fielded UGS systems, refer to the Current Force UGS ProgramUS Army Market Survey for Current force unattended ground sensors or CF UGS. The CF UGS systems employ various sensor modalities including seismic, acoustic, magnetic, and pyroelectric transducers, daylight imagers and passive infrared imagers to automatically detect the presence of persons or vehicles, and transmit activity reports or imagery via radio-frequency (RF) or satellite communications (SATCOM) links to a remote processing, exploitation, and dissemination (PED) station. The systems are packaged for concealed emplacement in the field and for long-duration unattended operation.US Army Solicitation for Current Force UGS Systems The Army Research Laboratory developed unattended ground-sensor technologies for detection and tracking of personnel and vehicles for perimeter defense and border-monitoring applications. In 2005, the OmniSense system was commercialized and fielded. The CF UGS program includes a family of sensors from various companies: Qual- Tron Inc (MIDS, EMIDS, MMIDS) E-UGS, Silent Watch, Falcon Watch, Scorpion, OmniSense and OmniSense-Enhanced. The current sources for CF UGS are Applied Research Associates (E-UGS), Harris Corporation (Silent Watch, Falcon Watch), Northrop Grumman-Xetron (Scorpion), McQ Inc (OmniSense, OmniSense-Enhanced).  Future combat systems UGS  There are two types of unattended ground sensors that are being fielded under the United States Army's Future Combat Systems Program, the Urban UGS or U-UGS and the Tactical UGS or T-UGS. The current generation is manufactured by Textron Defense Systems a subcontractor under Boeing.  Tactical unattended ground sensor  T-UGS are small ground-based sensors that collect intelligence through seismic, acoustic, radiological nuclear and electro-optic means. These sensors are networked devices that provide an early warning system to supplement a platoon size element and are capable of remote operation. To an extent T-UGS will detect, track, classify, and identify personnel and vehicles within its coverage area and report to the FCS Network in near real-time. T-UGS comprises the following sensor systems: * The gateway node, which is a router and data collector that sends information back to a FCS Network equipped vehicle. * The intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) node, which is the key component that acquires and tracks personnel, vehicles and aircraft through seismic and acoustic means. * The electro-optic node obtains information from the ISR node and pans its camera toward the point of interest and is able to track and send images through the FCS Network. * The radiological nuclear node is capable of measuring and reporting gamma dose-rate and accumulated dose from a fallout environment in a tactical battlefield situation. Detected radiological events will be transmitted via a detailed spot report through the gateway node to an operator on the FCS network.  Urban unattended ground sensor  For urban areas, the urban-unattended ground sensor (U-UGS) is used as a surveillance tool during building clearing operations, and in caves, sewers, tunnels, and other confined spaces. Textron Defense Systems, along with Honeywell, designed these wireless, hand emplaced system of sensors to be lightweight and low cost. The U-UGS network is capable of taking field-of-view images of intruders in all light conditions and transmits images to the FCS Network where immediate recognition of human intruders should be achieved, or, when imaging is not needed, by using the motion detector sensors only. The proposed U-UGS sensors are made up of the following: * The gateway bridges U-UGS sensor field to the FCS network and relays motion alarm and image data. It's capable to be monitored locally by a soldier or remotely through a FCS network enabled modulevehicle. * The intrusion node is a motion sensor that detects movement and is able to tell the difference between animal and human beings. * The imager node is a combination of motion sensor and all light condition capable imager camera to make pictorial identification easier.  OmniSense  The Army Research Laboratory (ARL) developed Omnisense for perimeter defense and border-monitoring applications in collaboration with McQ Inc. In 2005, the OmniSense system was commercialized and fielded by the U.S. Army. The persistent surveillance sensors were deployed in quantity to warfighting areas to monitor roads, borders, and areas of interest for insurgent activities. This networked UGS system connected the user to the remotely deployed sensors to receive target information and allowed the user to remotely reconfigure the sensors. These intelligent sensors detected and classified the targets, in addition to capturing a picture of the target. The detected targets were tracked with either a daytime color camera or an uncooled nighttime infrared camera, so the user sees the target as it is detected. The US Army has cited OmniSense as ‚ÄúOne of the Greatest Inventions of 2006.‚Äù  Phalanx Shield  Phalanx Shield is a situational awareness system developed by Innovative Algorithms, a world class leader in UGS technologies. Phalanx Shield is a suite of high performing UGS integrated with the Phalanx Shield user interface, which allows operators to command and control sensors in real-time within an ecosystem that is fully compatible with ATAK. Phalanx Shield is the next level of performance in technology, advancing capabilities beyond yesterday‚Äôs Unattended Ground Sensors. Advanced processing, communication and data management capabilities opens the door to more intelligent processing and algorithms, while achieving lower power consumption. Reduced False Alarm Rates, reliable long range detection, and integration with advanced User Interfaces makes Phalanx Shield the most innovative Unattended Ground Sensor system currently on the market.

Early life and career Mitchell was born on April 4, 1823, in Mansfield, Ohio. For some odd reason, it was recorded that he graduated from both Kenyon College and Washington College, although neither school has a record of his attendance. Another Ohio-born Civil War general with the same surname, John G. Mitchell, did graduate from Kenyon, so he may have been confused in some early reference works with Robert B. Mitchell. He studied law in Mount Vernon, Ohio. After completing his studies, he practiced law in Mansfield. He served in the Mexican War as a second lieutenant in the 2nd Ohio Volunteers. He was elected mayor of Mount Gilead, Ohio, in 1855. Next year, he moved to Linn County, Kansas Territory. He served in the territorial legislature, as a delegate to the Leavenworth Convention, from 1857 to 1858. He served as treasurer of the Kansas Territory from 1859 to 1861. He was a delegate to the 1860 Democratic National Convention in Charleston, South Carolina. Civil War service After the start of the Civil War, Mitchell served as the Adjutant General of Kansas from May 2, 1861, to June 20, 1861. He later led the 2nd Kansas Infantry. He was badly wounded at the Battle of Wilson's Creek on August 10, 1861. He was shot from his horse while leading his regiment. After recovery, U.S. President Abraham Lincoln appointed him as a brigadier general to rank from April 8, 1862, and he was given command of a mixed brigade at Fort Riley. He commanded the 9th Division in Charles C. Gilbert's III Corps at the Battle of Perryville. He was then sent to Nashville, Tennessee, where he remained for several months. During the Chickamauga campaign, Mitchell served as George H. Thomas's Chief of Cavalry for the Army of the Cumberland. Just before the Third Battle of Chattanooga, he was ordered to Washington, D.C., for court- martial duty. According to some sources, this was due to severe wounds which incapacitated him from field duty but this is contradicted in the Official Records by Mitchell's own correspondence. Whether incapacitated or not, he would not see active campaigning again, and for the remainder of the Civil War, he commanded the District of Nebraska, then the District of North Kansas, and finally the District of Kansas. He saw service in Colorado Territory in January 1865, following the Indian raid on Julesburg, Colorado, on the Overland Trail, but he did not succeed in locating the Indian camp on the Republican River until after they had departed.Footnote 6, page 188, The Fighting Cheyenne, George Bird Grinnell, University of Oklahoma Press (1956 original copyright 1915 Charles Scribner's Sons), hardcover, 454 pagesChapters 32, 33, 34, Ware, Eugene, The Indian War of 1864: Being a Fragment of the Early History of Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado and Wyoming\\", Crane & Company (1911) Eugene Ware was the most junior officer in the Seventh Iowa Cavalry when on September 19, 1863, it was deployed to Omaha en route to the Indian Wars. Governor of New Mexico Territory Mitchell was honorably mustered out of the army on January 15, 1866. On the same day, the United States Senate confirmed his nomination as the Governor of the New Mexico Territory. He took the oath of office on June 6, 1866. He never appeared to take his duties as governor seriously. He was often absent from the territorial capital Sante Fe, without explanation, forcing the legislature to forward bills it had passed to Washington, D. C., for approval of the United States Congress. He resigned as governor in 1869. Later life After leaving the office, Mitchell returned to Kansas. He was unsuccessful in his bid to represent Kansas in the U.S. Congress in 1872. He then moved to Washington, D. C., where he died on January 26, 1882. He was buried with full military honors in Section 2, Grave 1023, of Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.

The Fruitvale Oil Field is a large oil and gas field in the southern San Joaquin Valley, California, within and just northwest of the city of Bakersfield, along and north of the Kern River. It is one of the few oil fields in the California Central Valley which is mostly surrounded by a heavily populated area. Discovered in 1928, and with a cumulative total recovery of more than of oil at the end of 2006, it is 41st in size among California oil fields, and according to the California Department of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR) its total reserve amounts to a little less than ten percent of its original oil.California Department of Conservation, Oil and Gas Statistics, Annual Report, December 31, 2006, p. 67 Setting Aerial view of the Fruitvale field, with subareas labeled; the lighter colored area is the field itself, which is almost entirely surrounded by the city of Bakersfield. Unlike most of the large Kern County oil fields, which are in the hills bordering the Central Valley, the Fruitvale field is on the valley floor, surrounded by the city of Bakersfield and its suburbs. The southern San Joaquin Valley in the vicinity of the oil field, except where cut by the Kern River and where artificially modified by features such as canals, is almost as flat as a table top, and the elevation of the field varies only from about across its extent. The climate is arid, with hot summers and mild winters. Temperature in the summer commonly exceeds . Only about 5 to of precipitation falls in a year, almost invariably as rain, and in the winter. Tule fog is common during the cooler months. Drainage is to the Kern River which flows southwest through the southern part of the field towards the Buena Vista Lake Bed. While the native vegetation in the area is mostly allscale and needlegrass, most vegetation has been removed from the area of active operations, and formerly active areas have largely been converted to industrial or other urban uses. Much of the northern part of the field, no longer used for production, is covered with residential development, as is the extreme south part, south of the Kern River. In the northwestern area of the field, the Calloway Area, a decommissioned part of the field has been turned into a golf course. Riparian vegetation and associated wildlife habitats can be found along the Kern River, which crosses through the southern part of the field. Since the oil field is in an urbanized area, it is easily accessible from all sides. California State Route 99, a freeway, runs along and through the east side of the field, and the Rosedale Highway, Route 58 runs across it from east to west. Calloway Drive runs approximately along the western boundary, and Coffee Road parallels Calloway Drive to the east, crossing through the entire field. Geology Fruitvale Oil Field Structure Map The Fruitvale Field is in a sedimentary basin in which the beds dip slightly to the west. The topmost sedimentary unit, the Kern River Formation, is young ‚Äì of Pleistocene age ‚Äì and not oil-bearing. Underneath this alluvial layer, which is over thick, and over millions of years, oil has collected in a series of structural traps, typically where an oil-bearing unit is topped by an impermeable one, and blocked up-dip by another impermeable structure placed there by faulting. The most productive geologic formations, from top to bottom, include the Pliocene Etchegoin Formation, Pliocene-Miocene Chanac Formation, the Miocene 42-O Sand, and the Miocene Santa Margarita Formation. Many of these formations are productive oil-bearing units elsewhere in the Central Valley, for their geographic coverage is wide, and many structural and stratigraphic trap types exist throughout the province.DOGGR, 178-182 The field is divided conventionally into two significant areas: the large Main Area on the east and south, and the much smaller Calloway Area on the northwest. At the west edge of the field is the small and abandoned Greenacres Area, which was marginally productive, between 1953 and 1969.DOGGR, 178-182 A total of five oil pools are distinguished within the Main Area. In order of discovery, they are the Mason-Parker, Martin, and Kernco (all February 1928), Santa Margarita (December 1929), and Fairhaven (March 1936). Oil is found at depths ranging from . In the Calloway Area, two pools are identified but production data is commingled; they are named for their petroleum-bearing unit, the 42-0/42-7 Sand. This area was not discovered until 1957.DOGGR, 180 Signal Oil & Gas Co. drilled the deepest well in the field, reaching a depth of , and encountering the granitic basement rocks, probably of Jurassic age.DOGGR, p. 179 History, production and operations The first well drilled in the area to find oil was by Pacific Eastern Production Company (later Gulf Oil) which reached oil in February 1928, and attained a total initial depth of . A few months after completion, the same well was recompleted to a depth of ; however, nothing significantly more productive was found at this depth.DOGGR, p. 182 Several enhanced recovery techniques have been used in the Fruitvale Field. In 1972, operators began waterflooding, thereby attempting to push the heavy crude to production wells, increasing the rate of extraction; in 1976, they began using cyclic steam flooding, a generally more effective technique for heavy oil, as the heat considerably reduces the oil's viscosity, helping it to flow.DOGGR, p. 182 Fireflooding, an enhanced recovery technology in which flammable units deep underground are ignited‚Äîin this case, a thick section of oil sand‚Äîbegan in 1980 in the portion of the field operated by Gulf. Engineers at the time believed that up to 400 million further barrels of oil could be recovered from the field, oil which could be made to flow due to the intense heat generated by this process. Rintoul, B. Fruitvale Field fireflooded. Drilling Contract, 36:12. 1980. In 2008, well operators on the field included none of the major oil companies. The largest operators were independents such as Summit Energy, Big West of California, San Joaquin Facilities Management, E & B Natural Resources, Sunray Petroleum, Black Gold Oil Co., and others. A total of 301 wells remained in production, and 65 were used for injection of various kinds (including steam and wastewater).DOGGR well database query interface; Fruitvale Field The most productive year for the field as a whole was 1954, during which were extracted.

The screenplay by James Schamus is based on the memoir Taking Woodstock: A True Story of a Riot, a Concert, and a Life by Elliot Tiber and Tom Monte. The film premiered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, and opened in New York and Los Angeles on August 26, 2009, before its wide theatrical release two days later. It received mixed reviews and was a box office failure. Plot Set in 1969, the film follows the true story of Elliot Tiber (Demetri Martin), an aspiring Greenwich Village interior designer whose parents, Jake (Henry Goodman) and Sonia (Imelda Staunton), own the small dilapidated El Monaco Resort in White Lake, in the town of Bethel, New York. A hippie theater troupe, The Earthlight Players, rents the barn, but can hardly pay any rent. Due to financial trouble, the motel may have to be closed, but Elliot pleads with the local bank not to foreclose on the mortgage and Sonia delivers a tirade about her struggles as a Russian refugee. The family is given until the end of the summer to pay up. Elliot plans to hold a small musical festival, and has, for $1, obtained a permit from the town's chamber of commerce (of which he is also the president). When he hears that the organizers of the Woodstock Festival face opposition against the originally planned location, he offers his permit and the motel accommodations to organizer Michael Lang (Jonathan Groff). A neighbor, Max Yasgur (Eugene Levy), provides his nearby farm land; first they agree on a fee of $5,000, but after realizing how many people will come, Yasgur demands $75,000, which the organizers reluctantly accept. Elliot comes to agreement about the fee for the motel more smoothly. Initial objections by his mother quickly disappear when she sees the cash paid in advance. Elliot and Yasgur encounter a little bit of expected opposition. The local diner refuses to serve Elliot anymore, inspectors target the motel (and only his) for building code violations, and some local boys paint a swastika and hate words on the motel. However, resistance quickly dissolves in the tidal wave of peace and love (and commerce) brought to the area. The Tiber family works hard serving the massive influx of visitors and become wealthy in the process. A cross-dressing veteran, Vilma (Liev Schreiber), is hired as a security guard. Elliot also struggles with hiding his homosexuality from his family, when he connects romantically with one of the event organizers staying at the motel. On the first day of the concert, Elliot, his father, and Vilma hear the music begin in the distance. Elliot's father, transformed and enlivened by all the new life in town, tells Elliot to go and see the concert. Elliot hitches a ride through the peaceful traffic jam on the back of a benevolent state trooper's motorcycle and arrives at the event. There, he meets a hippie couple (Paul Dano and Kelli Garner), who invite him to join them on an LSD trip in their VW Bus a short distance from the crowd. Elliot has trouble relaxing at first, but gradually melts into a psychedelic union with them. When they finally emerge after sundown, Elliot watches the vast crowd and brilliant lights of the distant concert ripple with harmonious hallucinatory visuals that swell into serene white light. Elliot returns home from his liberating experience and has breakfast with his parents. He suggests to his mother that they now have enough money to replace him, but she cannot bear to let him have his freedom. Elliot storms out, facetiously suggesting his mom eat the hash brownies Vilma has just offered. After another beautiful day at the festival, during which his friend the Vietnam veteran, Billy (Emile Hirsch), appears to overcome his post-traumatic stress disorder, Elliot returns home to find his parents laughing and cavorting hysterically, having eaten Vilma's hash brownies. The once-brittle family (particularly Sonia) is united in joy and delirious affection. The next morning, however, Sonia inadvertently reveals that she has secretly saved $97,000 in cash in the floorboards of her closet. Elliot is upset that his mother hid this from him while he put his own savings into helping his parents. After the final day of the concert, Elliot decides to move to California as he packs up his things and says farewell to his father, after his father encourages him to strike out on his own. As Elliot pays one last visit to the concert and looks out over the muddy desolation of the Yasgur farm, Lang rides up on horseback and they marvel at how despite the obstacles, the event was a success. Lang mentions his next big project: staging a truly free concert in San Francisco with the Rolling Stones.

Factual accuracy Elliot Tiber is the author of the memoir on which the movie is based (Bologna, June 2009). Michael Lang has disputed Tiber's account of the initial meeting with Max Yasgur, and said that he was introduced to Yasgur by a real estate salesman. Lang says that the salesman drove him, without Tiber, to Yasgur's farm. Sam Yasgur, son of Max, agrees with Lang's version, and says that his mother, who is still alive, says Max did not know Tiber. Artie Kornfeld, a Woodstock organizer, has said he found out about Yasgur's farm from his own sources. Release=Box office Taking Woodstock grossed $3,457,760 during its opening weekend, opening at #9. After five and a half weeks in theaters, on October 1, 2009, the film's total domestic box office gross was $7,460,204 with an overseas take of $2,515,533. The film grossed $9,975,737 worldwide, thus making the film, from an estimated $30 million budget, a box office bomb. Critical reaction The film maintains a 48% average on Rotten Tomatoes based on 179 reviews for an average rating of 5.4/10. The site's consensus states: \\"Featuring numerous 60s-era clich√©s, but little of the musical magic that highlighted the famous festival, Taking Woodstock is a breezy but underwhelming portrayal.\\" and a 55% on Metacritic. Director Ang Lee and actor Emile Hirsch promoting the film at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. Roger Ebert at the Chicago Sun-Times wrote: \\"... Lee and writer James Schamus aren't making a historical pastiche. This is a comedy with some sweet interludes and others that are cheerfully over the top, such as a nude theatrical troupe living in Elliot‚Äôs barn, and Vilma, his volunteer head of motel security, a transvestite ex-Marine played by Liev Schreiber. How does Schreiber, looking just as he usually does except for a blond wig and a dress, play a transvestite? Completely straight. It works.\\" Michael Phillips at the Chicago Tribune gave it 3 out 4 stars saying \\"Screenwriter James Schamus doesn‚Äôt do anything as stupid as shove Elliot back in the closet, but this is no Brokeback Catskills Mountain. It‚Äôs a mosaic ‚Äì many characters, drifting in and out of focus ‚Äì stitching the story of how the peace-and-music bash fell together as it bounced in the haphazard planning stages from its originally scheduled Wallkill, N.Y., location to a cow pasture in White Lake. (Eugene Levy, working hard to restrain his natural comic ebullience, plays the dairy farmer, Max Yasgur.)\\" Stephen Holden at The New York Times liked the film, which he described as a \\"likable, humane movie\\" and \\"a small, intimate film into which is fitted a peripheral view of the landmark event\\". He pointed out that \\"Taking Woodstock pointedly shies away from spectacle, the better to focus on how the lives of individuals caught up by history are transformed ...the movie explicitly connects Woodstock to the gay- liberation movement and the Stonewall riots, which took place two months earlier that summer.\\" Lou Lumeneck at the New York Post gave it 1.5 stars: \\"It turns the fabled music festival, a key cultural moment of the late 20th century, into an exceedingly lame, heavily clich√©d, thumb-sucking bore. There are two main problems with Taking Woodstock. One is the central nonperformance by the stand-up comedian Demetri Martin, who is pretty much an emotional black hole as Elliot ... the movie doesn't make much of an issue of the character's gayness‚Äîwhich is utterly untrue to the period, 1969, even in enlightened circles.\\" Melissa Anderson in The Village Voice wrote: \\"Ang Lee‚Äôs facile Taking Woodstock proves that the decade is still prone to the laziest, wide- eyed oversimplifications ... little music from the concert itself is heard. On display instead are inane, occasionally borderline offensive portrayals of Jews, performance artists, trannies, Vietnam vets, squares, and freaks.\\" Slate wrote: \\"After the long middle section building up to the actual Woodstock, the movie's treatment of the event is maddeningly indirect. No one's asking for a song-by-song re-enactment of the concert, but Lee's refusal to focus even for a moment on the musical aspect of the festival starts to feel almost perverse, as if he's deliberately frustrating the audience's desire.\\" Awards and nominations Taking Woodstock lost when it was nominated for the GLAAD Media Award for \\"Outstanding Film ‚Äì Wide Release\\" during the 21st GLAAD Media Awards to A Single Man. Home media The DVD and Blu-ray were released on December 15, 2009.

In the Visayas regions, mam√≥n are also known as torta mam√≥n or torta. Variants of mam√≥n include the larger loaf-like version called taisan, the rolled version called pianono, and ladyfingers known as broas. Mam√≥n also has two very different variants that use mostly the same ingredients, the cookie-like mam√≥n tostado and the steamed puto mam√≥n. Description Visayan torta mam√≥n The characteristic round cupcake-like shape of mam√≥n Mam√≥n is a very light chiffon or sponge cake known for its soft and fluffy texture. It is traditionally baked in crenelated tin molds which gives it a characteristic cupcake-like shape. It is typically slathered in butter and sprinkled with white sugar and grated cheese. Mam√≥n is commonly eaten for merienda. In the Visayas regions, mam√≥n is known as torta mam√≥n, torta Visaya (or torta Bisaya), or simply torta. Although the name is derived from Spanish torta, \\"cake\\", in some Philippine regions torta could also mean \\"omelette\\". The Visayan versions are traditionally denser and greasier in texture. They were traditionally made with lard and use palm wine (tub√¢) as the leavening agent. Variants=Broas ladyfingers) from Kalibo, Aklan The ladyfinger version of mam√≥n is known as broas or broa. The name is derived from Portuguese broa, a type of corn and rye bread from Portugal and Galicia. Broas can either be soft and spongy or crunchy and cookie-like. They are commonly eaten paired with coffee or hot chocolate (sikwate). They are also traditionally used to make icebox cakes in the Philippines, including crema de fruta and mango float. Among Muslim Filipinos, broa (also spelled b'rua, bulwa, or baulo) is a derivative dish. They are eaten similarly and can also come in soft or crunchy versions, but they have a more irregular muffin- like shape. The soft version is like a smaller version of mam√≥n, while the crunchy version is more properly mam√≥n tostado. They are popularly eaten during special occasions and festivals, like Hari Raya. Other notable variants of dry and crunchy broas include the camachile cookies and the lengua de gato cookies. Mam√≥n tostado Mam√≥n tostado is basically a cookie-like version of mam√≥n (from Spanish tostado, \\"toasted\\"). It uses the same ingredients and is similarly airy, but it is baked until dry and crunchy. Pianono Ube pianono Pianono or pionono is a rolled version of the mam√≥n. It is typically sold as \\"cake rolls\\" in modern times due to its resemblance to the Swiss roll. Originally, its filling was composed only of sugar and butter or margarine, like all other kinds of mam√≥n. It is also traditionally much smaller in diameter than Swiss rolls. But modern versions are larger can vary significantly in the fillings and are usually frosted. Puto mam√≥n Puto mam√≥n is regarded as a type of puto (steamed cake). Taisan Taisan is a loaf-like version of mam√≥n. Like mam√≥n, it is typically slathered in butter and sprinkled with sugar and cheese. Taisan was first developed in Pampanga. It literally means \\"whetstone\\" in Kapampangan, and is named for its shape. In popular culture In Filipino idioms, pusong mam√≥n (literally \\"mam√≥n- hearted\\") means someone who is overly emotionally-sensitive. It is equivalent to the English idiom \\"softhearted\\". It is also used as a euphemism for effeminate gay men (bakla).

In 1880, the DDSG was the world's largest river shipping company with more than 200 steamboat ships and about 1000 cargo tubs. Steamboats on the Danube were, by the end of the 19th century, dominated by the Austrian-based DDSG. A new organisation was formed in 1896, based in the Hungarian part of the Habsburg empire, which was to become a significant player in both the freight haulage and passenger businesses. The MFTR took over the fleet of the Hungarian Railways (MAV) in 1914 and eventually became MAHART, a company which continues to exist in the Danube freight business.

The boat displaced 42 tons, was 25 meters long and had 12mm of armor on its \\"citadel\\" protecting the engines and other vitals. While drawing more water than a half-meter, it still could operate in very shallow waters as it only drew 0.80 meters. The smaller version, known as BKA 1125, only drew 0.5 meters and displaced 29 tons. These were only slightly shorter (22.6 meters) but had less armor protection. Series production began in 1935 at small shipyards along the Soviet Union's inland rivers, World War II By the time of the 1941 invasion by Germany, 85 boats had been delivered with 68 more under construction. They went into action very early, with boats of the Danube flotilla infiltrating Romanian defenses to land troops on 24 June and routing Romanian marines defending the Danube delta.

The family includes about 113 species. Some are important food fish. One of the best known is the red snapper. Snappers inhabit tropical and subtropical regions of all oceans. Some snappers grow up to about in length however one specific Snapper, the Cubera Snapper, grows up to 5 ft in length. Most are active carnivores, feeding on crustaceans or other fish, though a few are plankton-feeders. They can be kept in aquaria, but mostly grow too fast to be popular aquarium fish. Most species live at depths reaching near coral reefs, but some species are found up to deep. Five-lined snapper (Lutjanus quinquelineatus), northeast coast of Taiwan As other fish, snappers harbour parasites. A detailed study conducted in New Caledonia has shown that coral reef-associated snappers harbour about 9 species of parasites per fish species.

The company operates a total of 14 cruise ships on the Rhine, Main and Moselle rivers. The famous KD steamer line operated on the Rhine both with connecting steamers and tourist boats. The Lorelei rock was a famed day outing for pleasure seekers.  History =Early history of tourism in Germany The first steamboats arrived from England in 1816, heralding a new age of tourism in Germany. Ten years later, the first German shipping line started up its operation between Cologne and Mainz; by 1856 the millionth ticket was proudly sold. In 1832, the first steam boat journeyed from the North Sea all the way to Basel, but this was not a regular service. Mannheim was an established port by 1840, and the river became heavily travelled during the industrial revolution. In 1846 the Ludwig-Donau-Canal was completed after 9 years of work. It was named after King Ludwig I of Bavaria. The KD Line founded The KD Steamer Line can trace its history back to 1853 when two earlier companies, the Preussisch-Rheinischen Dampfschiffahrtsgesellschaft (PRDG), the \\"K√∂ln\\" company and the Dampfschiffahrtsgesellschaft f√ºr den Nieder- und Mittelrhein (DGNM), the \\"D√ºsseldorf\\" company, merged at a time of intense competition and in response to the loss of much of the freight and passenger traffic along the Rhine following the expansion of the railways along its banks. The KD Line grows Despite the merger, the two companies, which were established in 1826 and 1836 respectively, maintained semi-independent operations ordering their own vessels which were known as \\"K√∂ln\\" or \\"D√ºsseldorf\\" boats. Although other companies operated vessels during this period, especially in the more northerly and southerly stretches of the river, the KD came to dominate and absorb the competitors, such as the M√ºlheim Company (MDAG), with the exception of the Dutch Steamboat Company (NSM/NSR), which traced its inception back to 1823, when steam was first introduced for passenger and goods transport. The KD Line acquired  In 2000, KD Line was purchased by Viking Cruises, making it a subsidiary of the largest river cruise line in the world.  Fleet =Paddle steamers The KD operated 38 paddle steamers at the outbreak of World War I and 20 at the outbreak of World War II and, although the latter war in particular brought severe losses, it was still felt suitable to raise and rebuild wrecked vessels for further service. The last survivor, Goethe, returned to service in heavily rebuilt form in 1952, and for the 1953 season, there ware 14 large paddlers on the roster. In 1969 this had been reduced to 6 although the shortfall in capacity had been made up by the introduction of similar sized motor vessels. After 1974, with the withdrawal of Cecilie and Bismarck, three paddlers remained, all of which survive. Preservation The former KD Rhein paddler Mainz serves as a floating industrial museum on the River Neckar at Mannheim near the Kurpfalzbr√ºcke. Built in 1929, and operational until 1980, she was disposed of from the KD reserve fleet in 1984 and opened in her new use in 1986. Her machinery remains intact. Goethe remains the only vessel now serving with the KD and is the last example of paddle propulsion. She is no longer steam, having been converted to diesel- hydraulic propulsion in 2008-2009. ;PS Goethe http://www.k-d.com/redirect- index.php?npfad=/kd-flotte/dampfer-goethe.html * Built at Cologne in 1913 by Sachsenberg at Cologne-Deutz * Length : 83 metres - 272 feet (extended from 77.8 m after 1951-2 rebuild) * Former Engines : Compound Diagonal, built by Sachsenberg at Rosslau References External links  * Category:Shipping companies of Germany Category:Companies based in Cologne Category:Tourist attractions in Cologne Category:Tourist attractions in D√ºsseldorf Category:Rhine Category:River cruise companies ","title":"K√∂ln-D√ºsseldorfer"},{"id":"18673677","text":"Lareau is a Canadian French http://genealogy.familyeducation.com/surname- origin/lareau surname.

The theory relates group actions on trees with decomposing groups as iterated applications of the operations of free product with amalgamation and HNN extension, via the notion of the fundamental group of a graph of groups. Bass‚ÄìSerre theory can be regarded as one-dimensional version of the orbifold theory. History Bass‚ÄìSerre theory was developed by Jean-Pierre Serre in the 1970s and formalized in Trees, Serre's 1977 monograph (developed in collaboration with Hyman Bass) on the subject.J.-P. Serre. Arbres, amalgames, SL2. R√©dig√© avec la collaboration de Hyman Bass. Ast√©risque, No. 46. Soci√©t√© Math√©matique de France, Paris, 1977J.-P. Serre, Trees. (Translated from the French by John Stillwell). Springer-Verlag, 1980. Serre's original motivation was to understand the structure of certain algebraic groups whose Bruhat‚ÄìTits buildings are trees. However, the theory quickly became a standard tool of geometric group theory and geometric topology, particularly the study of 3-manifolds. Subsequent work of BassH. Bass, Covering theory for graphs of groups. Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra, vol. 89 (1993), no. 1‚Äì2, pp. 3‚Äì47 contributed substantially to the formalization and development of basic tools of the theory and currently the term \\"Bass‚ÄìSerre theory\\" is widely used to describe the subject. Mathematically, Bass‚ÄìSerre theory builds on exploiting and generalizing the properties of two older group-theoretic constructions: free product with amalgamation and HNN extension. However, unlike the traditional algebraic study of these two constructions, Bass‚ÄìSerre theory uses the geometric language of covering theory and fundamental groups. Graphs of groups, which are the basic objects of Bass‚ÄìSerre theory, can be viewed as one-dimensional versions of orbifolds.

London Mathematical Society Student Texts, 14. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1989. Basic set-up=Graphs in the sense of Serre Serre's formalism of graphs is slightly different from the standard formalism from graph theory. Here a graph A consists of a vertex set V, an edge set E, an edge reversal map E\\\\to E,\\\\ e\\\\mapsto \\\\overline{e} such that ‚â† e and \\\\overline{\\\\overline{e}}= e for every e in E, and an initial vertex map o\\\\colon E\\\\to V. Thus in A every edge e comes equipped with its formal inverse . The vertex o(e) is called the origin or the initial vertex of e and the vertex o() is called the terminus of e and is denoted t(e). Both loop-edges (that is, edges e such that o(e) = t(e)) and multiple edges are allowed. An orientation on A is a partition of E into the union of two disjoint subsets E+ and E‚àí so that for every edge e exactly one of the edges from the pair e, belongs to E+ and the other belongs to E‚àí. Graphs of groups A graph of groups A consists of the following data: * A connected graph A; * An assignment of a vertex group Av to every vertex v of A. * An assignment of an edge group Ae to every edge e of A so that we have A_e=A_{\\\\overline e} for every e ‚àà E. * Boundary monomorphisms \\\\alpha_e: A_e\\\\to A_{o(e)} for all edges e of A, so that each Œ±e is an injective group homomorphism. For every e\\\\in E the map \\\\alpha_{\\\\overline e}\\\\colon A_e\\\\to A_{t(e)} is also denoted by \\\\omega_e. Fundamental group of a graph of groups There are two equivalent definitions of the notion of the fundamental group of a graph of groups: the first is a direct algebraic definition via an explicit group presentation (as a certain iterated application of amalgamated free products and HNN extensions), and the second using the language of groupoids. The algebraic definition is easier to state: First, choose a spanning tree T in A. The fundamental group of A with respect to T, denoted œÄ1(A, T), is defined as the quotient of the free product :(\\\\ast_{v\\\\in V} A_v) \\\\ast F(E) where F(E) is a free group with free basis E, subject to the following relations: *\\\\overline{e} \\\\alpha_e(g)e=\\\\alpha_{\\\\overline{e}}(g) for every e in E and every g\\\\in A_e. (The so-called Bass‚ÄìSerre relation.) *e = 1 for every e in E. *e = 1 for every edge e of the spanning tree T. There is also a notion of the fundamental group of A with respect to a base-vertex v in V, denoted œÄ1(A, v), which is defined using the formalism of groupoids. It turns out that for every choice of a base-vertex v and every spanning tree T in A the groups œÄ1(A, T) and œÄ1(A, v) are naturally isomorphic. The fundamental group of a graph of groups has a natural topological interpretation as well: it is the fundamental group of a graph of spaces whose vertex spaces and edge spaces have the fundamental groups of the vertex groups and edge groups, respectively, and whose gluing maps induce the homomorphisms of the edge groups into the vertex groups. One can therefore take this as a third definition of the fundamental group of a graph of groups. =Fundamental groups of graphs of groups as iterations of amalgamated products and HNN-extensions= The group G = œÄ1(A, T) defined above admits an algebraic description in terms of iterated amalgamated free products and HNN extensions. First, form a group B as a quotient of the free product :(\\\\ast_{v\\\\in V} A_v)*F(E^+T) subject to the relations *e‚àí1Œ±e(g)e = œâe(g) for every e in E+T and every g\\\\in A_e. *e = 1 for every e in E+T. This presentation can be rewritten as :B=\\\\ast_{v\\\\in V} A_v/{\\\\rm ncl}{\\\\alpha_e(g)=\\\\omega_e(g), \\\\text{ where }e\\\\in E^+T, g\\\\in G_e} which shows that B is an iterated amalgamated free product of the vertex groups Av. Then the group G = œÄ1(A, T) has the presentation :\\\\langle B, E^+(A-T) e^{-1}\\\\alpha_e(g)e=\\\\omega_e(g) \\\\text{ where }e\\\\in E^+(A-T), g\\\\in G_e \\\\rangle , which shows that G = œÄ1(A, T) is a multiple HNN extension of B with stable letters {e e\\\\in E^+(A-T)}. Splittings An isomorphism between a group G and the fundamental group of a graph of groups is called a splitting of G. If the edge groups in the splitting come from a particular class of groups (e.g. finite, cyclic, abelian, etc.), the splitting is said to be a splitting over that class. Thus a splitting where all edge groups are finite is called a splitting over finite groups. Algebraically, a splitting of G with trivial edge groups corresponds to a free product decomposition :G=(\\\\ast A_v)\\\\ast F(X) where F(X) is a free group with free basis X = E+(A‚àíT) consisting of all positively oriented edges (with respect to some orientation on A) in the complement of some spanning tree T of A. The normal forms theorem Let g be an element of G = œÄ1(A, T) represented as a product of the form :g=a_0e_1a_1\\\\dots e_na_n, where e1, ..., en is a closed edge-path in A with the vertex sequence v0, v1, ..., vn = v0 (that is v0=o(e1), vn = t(en) and vi = t(ei) = o(ei+1) for 0 < i < n) and where a_i\\\\in A_{v_i} for i = 0, ..., n. Suppose that g = 1 in G. Then *either n = 0 and a0 = 1 in A_{v_0}, *or n > 0 and there is some 0 < i < n such that ei+1 = and a_i\\\\in \\\\omega_{e_i}(A_{e_i}). The normal forms theorem immediately implies that the canonical homomorphisms Av ‚Üí œÄ1(A, T) are injective, so that we can think of the vertex groups Av as subgroups of G. Higgins has given a nice version of the normal form using the fundamental groupoid of a graph of groups.Higgins, P.J., \`The fundamental groupoid of a graph of groups', J. London Math. Soc. (2), 13 (1976) 145‚Äì149. This avoids choosing a base point or tree, and has been exploited by Moore.Moore, E.J., Graphs of groups: word computations and free crossed resolutions , PhD Thesis, University of Wales, Bangor, (2001). Bass‚ÄìSerre covering trees To every graph of groups A, with a specified choice of a base-vertex, one can associate a Bass‚ÄìSerre covering tree \\\\tilde {\\\\mathbf A} , which is a tree that comes equipped with a natural group action of the fundamental group œÄ1(A, v) without edge-inversions. Moreover, the quotient graph \\\\tilde {\\\\mathbf A}/\\\\pi_1(\\\\mathbf A,v) is isomorphic to A. Similarly, if G is a group acting on a tree X without edge-inversions (that is, so that for every edge e of X and every g in G we have ge ‚â† ), one can define the natural notion of a quotient graph of groups A. The underlying graph A of A is the quotient graph X/G. The vertex groups of A are isomorphic to vertex stabilizers in G of vertices of X and the edge groups of A are isomorphic to edge stabilizers in G of edges of X. Moreover, if X was the Bass‚ÄìSerre covering tree of a graph of groups A and if G = œÄ1(A, v) then the quotient graph of groups for the action of G on X can be chosen to be naturally isomorphic to A. Fundamental theorem of Bass‚ÄìSerre theory Let G be a group acting on a tree X without inversions. Let A be the quotient graph of groups and let v be a base-vertex in A. Then G is isomorphic to the group œÄ1(A, v) and there is an equivariant isomorphism between the tree X and the Bass‚ÄìSerre covering tree \\\\tilde {\\\\mathbf A} . More precisely, there is a group isomorphism œÉ: G ‚Üí œÄ1(A, v) and a graph isomorphism j:X\\\\to \\\\tilde {\\\\mathbf A} such that for every g in G, for every vertex x of X and for every edge e of X we have j(gx) = g j(x) and j(ge) = g j(e). One of the immediate consequences of the above result is the classic Kurosh subgroup theorem describing the algebraic structure of subgroups of free products. Examples=Amalgamated free product Consider a graph of groups A consisting of a single non-loop edge e (together with its formal inverse ) with two distinct end-vertices u = o(e) and v = t(e), vertex groups H = Au, K = Av, an edge group C = Ae and the boundary monomorphisms \\\\alpha=\\\\alpha_e:C\\\\to H, \\\\omega=\\\\omega_e:C\\\\to K. Then T = A is a spanning tree in A and the fundamental group œÄ1(A, T) is isomorphic to the amalgamated free product : G=H\\\\ast_C K=H\\\\ast K/{\\\\rm ncl}{\\\\alpha(c)=\\\\omega(c), c\\\\in C}. In this case the Bass‚ÄìSerre tree X=\\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf A} can be described as follows. The vertex set of X is the set of cosets :VX= {gK:g\\\\in G}\\\\sqcup {gH:g\\\\in G}. Two vertices gK and fH are adjacent in X whenever there exists k ‚àà K such that fH = gkH (or, equivalently, whenever there is h ‚àà H such that gK = fhK). The G-stabilizer of every vertex of X of type gK is equal to gKg‚àí1 and the G-stabilizer of every vertex of X of type gH is equal to gHg‚àí1. For an edge [gH, ghK] of X its G-stabilizer is equal to ghŒ±(C)h‚àí1g‚àí1. For every c ‚àà C and h ‚àà 'k ‚àà K' the edges [gH, ghK] and [gH, ghŒ±(c)K] are equal and the degree of the vertex gH in X is equal to the index [H:Œ±(C)]. Similarly, every vertex of type gK has degree [K:œâ(C)] in X. HNN extension Let A be a graph of groups consisting of a single loop-edge e (together with its formal inverse ), a single vertex v = o(e) = t(e), a vertex group B = Av, an edge group C = Ae and the boundary monomorphisms \\\\alpha=\\\\alpha_e:C\\\\to B, \\\\omega=\\\\omega_e:C\\\\to B. Then T = v is a spanning tree in A and the fundamental group œÄ1(A, T) is isomorphic to the HNN extension : G = \\\\langle B, e e^{-1}\\\\alpha(c)e=\\\\omega(c), c\\\\in C\\\\rangle. with the base group B, stable letter e and the associated subgroups H = Œ±(C), K = œâ(C) in B. The composition \\\\phi=\\\\omega \\\\circ \\\\alpha^{-1}:H\\\\to K is an isomorphism and the above HNN- extension presentation of G can be rewritten as : G = \\\\langle B, e e^{-1}he=\\\\phi(h), h\\\\in H\\\\rangle. \\\\, In this case the Bass‚ÄìSerre tree X=\\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf A} can be described as follows. The vertex set of X is the set of cosets VX = {gB : g ‚àà G}. Two vertices gB and fB are adjacent in X whenever there exists b in B such that either fB = gbeB or fB = gbe‚àí1B. The G-stabilizer of every vertex of X is conjugate to B in G and the stabilizer of every edge of X is conjugate to H in G. Every vertex of X has degree equal to [B : H] + [B : K]. A graph with the trivial graph of groups structure Let A be a graph of groups with underlying graph A such that all the vertex and edge groups in A are trivial. Let v be a base-vertex in A. Then œÄ1(A,v) is equal to the fundamental group œÄ1(A,v) of the underlying graph A in the standard sense of algebraic topology and the Bass‚ÄìSerre covering tree \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf A} is equal to the standard universal covering space \\\\tilde{A} of A. Moreover, the action of œÄ1(A,v) on \\\\tilde{\\\\mathbf A} is exactly the standard action of œÄ1(A,v) on \\\\tilde{A} by deck transformations. Basic facts and properties *If A is a graph of groups with a spanning tree T and if G = œÄ1(A, T), then for every vertex v of A the canonical homomorphism from Av to G is injective. *If g ‚àà G is an element of finite order then g is conjugate in G to an element of finite order in some vertex group Av. *If F ‚â§ G is a finite subgroup then F is conjugate in G to a subgroup of some vertex group Av. *If the graph A is finite and all vertex groups Av are finite then the group G is virtually free, that is, G contains a free subgroup of finite index. *If A is finite and all the vertex groups Av are finitely generated then G is finitely generated. *If A is finite and all the vertex groups Av are finitely presented and all the edge groups Ae are finitely generated then G is finitely presented. Trivial and nontrivial actions A graph of groups A is called trivial if A = T is already a tree and there is some vertex v of A such that Av = œÄ1(A, A). This is equivalent to the condition that A is a tree and that for every edge e = [u, z] of A (with o(e) = u, t(e) = z) such that u is closer to v than z we have [Az : œâe(Ae)] = 1, that is Az = œâe(Ae). An action of a group G on a tree X without edge-inversions is called trivial if there exists a vertex x of X that is fixed by G, that is such that Gx = x. It is known that an action of G on X is trivial if and only if the quotient graph of groups for that action is trivial. Typically, only nontrivial actions on trees are studied in Bass‚ÄìSerre theory since trivial graphs of groups do not carry any interesting algebraic information, although trivial actions in the above sense (e. g. actions of groups by automorphisms on rooted trees) may also be interesting for other mathematical reasons. One of the classic and still important results of the theory is a theorem of Stallings about ends of groups. The theorem states that a finitely generated group has more than one end if and only if this group admits a nontrivial splitting over finite subgroups that is, if and only if the group admits a nontrivial action without inversions on a tree with finite edge stabilizers.J. R. Stallings. Groups of cohomological dimension one. in: \\"Applications of Categorical Algebra (Proc. Sympos. Pure Math., Vol. XVIII, New York, 1968)\\", pp. 124‚Äì128; American Mathematical Society, Providence, R.I, 1970. An important general result of the theory states that if G is a group with Kazhdan's property (T) then G does not admit any nontrivial splitting, that is, that any action of G on a tree X without edge-inversions has a global fixed vertex.Y. Watatani. Property T of Kazhdan implies property FA of Serre. Mathematica Japonica, vol. 27 (1982), no. 1, pp. 97‚Äì103 Hyperbolic length functions Let G be a group acting on a tree X without edge-inversions. For every g‚ààG put :\\\\ell_X(g)=\\\\min{ d(x,gx)  x\\\\in VX}. Then ‚ÑìX(g) is called the translation length of g on X. The function :\\\\ell_X: G\\\\to\\\\mathbf{Z}, \\\\quad g\\\\in G\\\\mapsto \\\\ell_X(g) is called the hyperbolic length function or the translation length function for the action of G on X. Basic facts regarding hyperbolic length functions *For g ‚àà G exactly one of the following holds: :(a) ‚ÑìX(g) = 0 and g fixes a vertex of G. In this case g is called an elliptic element of G. :(b) ‚ÑìX(g) > 0 and there is a unique bi-infinite embedded line in X, called the axis of g and denoted Lg which is g-invariant. In this case g acts on Lg by translation of magnitude ‚ÑìX(g) and the element g ‚àà G is called hyperbolic. *If ‚ÑìX(G) ‚â† 0 then there exists a unique minimal G-invariant subtree XG of X. Moreover, XG is equal to the union of axes of hyperbolic elements of G. The length-function ‚ÑìX : G ‚Üí Z is said to be abelian if it is a group homomorphism from G to Z and non- abelian otherwise. Similarly, the action of G on X is said to be abelian if the associated hyperbolic length function is abelian and is said to be non- abelian otherwise. In general, an action of G on a tree X without edge- inversions is said to be minimal if there are no proper G-invariant subtrees in X. An important fact in the theory says that minimal non-abelian tree actions are uniquely determined by their hyperbolic length functions: Uniqueness theorem Let G be a group with two nonabelian minimal actions without edge-inversions on trees X and Y. Suppose that the hyperbolic length functions ‚ÑìX and ‚ÑìY on G are equal, that is ‚ÑìX(g) = ‚ÑìY(g) for every g ‚àà G. Then the actions of G on X and Y are equal in the sense that there exists a graph isomorphism f : X ‚Üí Y which is G-equivariant, that is f(gx) = g f(x) for every g ‚àà G and every x ‚àà VX. Important developments in Bass‚ÄìSerre theory Important developments in Bass‚ÄìSerre theory in the last 30 years include: *Various accessibility results for finitely presented groups that bound the complexity (that is, the number of edges) in a graph of groups decomposition of a finitely presented group, where some algebraic or geometric restrictions on the types of groups considered are imposed. These results include: **Dunwoody's theorem about accessibility of finitely presented groupsM. J. Dunwoody.The accessibility of finitely presented groups. Inventiones Mathematicae vol. 81 (1985), no. 3, pp. 449‚Äì457 stating that for any finitely presented group G there exists a bound on the complexity of splittings of G over finite subgroups (the splittings are required to satisfy a technical assumption of being \\"reduced\\"); **Bestvina‚ÄìFeighn generalized accessibility theorem stating that for any finitely presented group G there is a bound on the complexity of reduced splittings of G over small subgroups (the class of small groups includes, in particular, all groups that do not contain non- abelian free subgroups); **Acylindrical accessibility results for finitely presented (Sela,Z.

Universit√© de Grenoble. Annales de l'Institut Fourier, vol. 49 (1999), no. 4, pp. 1215‚Äì1224) and finitely generated (Weidmann) groups which bound the complexity of the so- called acylindrical splittings, that is splittings where for their Bass‚ÄìSerre covering trees the diameters of fixed subsets of nontrivial elements of G are uniformly bounded. *The theory of JSJ-decompositions for finitely presented groups. This theory was motivated by the classic notion of JSJ decomposition in 3-manifold topology and was initiated, in the context of word-hyperbolic groups, by the work of Sela. JSJ decompositions are splittings of finitely presented groups over some classes of small subgroups (cyclic, abelian, noetherian, etc., depending on the version of the theory) that provide a canonical descriptions, in terms of some standard moves, of all splittings of the group over subgroups of the class.

The theory of tree lattices turns out to be useful in the study of discrete subgroups of algebraic groups over non-archimedean local fields and in the study of Kac‚ÄìMoody groups. *Development of foldings and Nielsen methods for approximating group actions on trees and analyzing their subgroup structure.M.

Journal f√ºr die Reine und Angewandte Mathematik, vol. 602 (2007), pp. 1‚Äì16. Generalizations There have been several generalizations of Bass‚ÄìSerre theory: *The theory of complexes of groups (see Haefliger,Andr√© Haefliger. Complexes of groups and orbihedra. in: \\"Group theory from a geometrical viewpoint (Trieste, 1990)\\", pp. 504‚Äì540, World Sci. Publ., River Edge, NJ, 1991. CorsonJon Corson. Complexes of groups. Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society (3) 65 (1992), no. 1, pp. 199‚Äì224. Bridson- HaefligerMartin R. Bridson, and Andr√© Haefliger. Metric spaces of non-positive curvature. Grundlehren der Mathematischen Wissenschaften [Fundamental Principles of Mathematical Sciences], 319. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1999. ) provides a higher-dimensional generalization of Bass‚ÄìSerre theory. The notion of a graph of groups is replaced by that of a complex of groups, where groups are assigned to each cell in a simplicial complex, together with monomorphisms between these groups corresponding to face inclusions (these monomorphisms are required to satisfy certain compatibility conditions). One can then define an analog of the fundamental group of a graph of groups for a complex of groups. However, in order for this notion to have good algebraic properties (such as embeddability of the vertex groups in it) and in order for a good analog for the notion of the Bass‚ÄìSerre covering tree to exist in this context, one needs to require some sort of \\"non-positive curvature\\" condition for the complex of groups in question (see, for example Daniel T. Wise. The residual finiteness of negatively curved polygons of finite groups. Inventiones Mathematicae, vol. 149 (2002), no. 3, pp. 579‚Äì617John R. Stallings. Non-positively curved triangles of groups. in: \\"Group theory from a geometrical viewpoint (Trieste, 1990)\\", pp. 491‚Äì503, World Scientific Publishing, River Edge, NJ, 1991; ). *The theory of isometric group actions on real trees (or R-trees) which are metric spaces generalizing the graph-theoretic notion of a tree (graph theory). The theory was developed largely in the 1990s, where the Rips machine of Eliyahu Rips on the structure theory of stable group actions on R-trees played a key role (see Bestvina-FeighnMladen Bestvina, and Mark Feighn. Stable actions of groups on real trees. Inventiones Mathematicae, vol. 121 (1995), no. 2, pp. 287‚Äì321). This structure theory assigns to a stable isometric action of a finitely generated group G a certain \\"normal form\\" approximation of that action by a stable action of G on a simplicial tree and hence a splitting of G in the sense of Bass‚ÄìSerre theory. Group actions on real trees arise naturally in several contexts in geometric topology: for example as boundary points of the Teichm√ºller spaceRichard Skora. Splittings of surfaces. Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society (N.S.), vol. 23 (1990), no. 1, pp. 85‚Äì90 (every point in the Thurston boundary of the Teichm√ºller space is represented by a measured geodesic lamination on the surface; this lamination lifts to the universal cover of the surface and a naturally dual object to that lift is an R-tree endowed with an isometric action of the fundamental group of the surface), as Gromov-Hausdorff limits of, appropriately rescaled, Kleinian group actions,Mladen Bestvina. Degenerations of the hyperbolic space. Duke Mathematical Journal. vol. 56 (1988), no. 1, pp. 143‚Äì161 and so on. The use of R-trees machinery provides substantial shortcuts in modern proofs of Thurston's Hyperbolization Theorem for Haken 3-manifolds.M. Kapovich. Hyperbolic manifolds and discrete groups.

The \\"Montauk Monster\\" was an animal carcass that washed ashore on a beach near the business district of Montauk, New York, in July 2008. The identity of the creature and the veracity of stories surrounding it have been the subject of controversy and speculation. History The story began on July 23, 2008, with an article in the newspaper The Independent. Jenna Hewitt, 26, of Montauk, and three friends said that they found the creature on July 12 at the Ditch Plains beach, two miles east of the district. The beach is a popular surfing spot at Rheinstein Estate Park owned by the town of East Hampton. Jenna Hewitt was quoted: Her color photograph of the creature ran in black and white under the headline \\"The Hound of Bonacville,\\" a pun on the name Bonackers, which refers to the natives of East Hampton, and The Hound of the Baskervilles by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The light-hearted article speculated that the creature might be a turtle or some mutant experiment from the Plum Island Animal Disease Center. It then noted that Larry Penny, the East Hampton Natural Resources Director, had concluded that it was a raccoon with its upper jaw missing. There were rumors that the carcass had been taken away from the site. A local newspaper quoted an anonymous resident who claimed that the animal was only the size of a cat, and that it had decomposed to a skeleton by the time of the press coverage. She would not identify its location for inspection. Hewitt claimed that \\"a guy took it and put it in the woods in his backyard\\", but would not say who or where. Her father denied that his daughter was keeping the body's location a secret.

Photographs were widely circulated via email and weblogs, and the national media picked up on it raising speculation about the creature. The potential urban legend stature of the Montauk Monster was noted by Snopes. The monster has been discussed on Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura.

Wise discounted the following general possibilities: *Raccoon ‚Äì the legs appear to be too long in proportion to the body. *Sea turtle ‚Äì sea turtles do not have fur or teeth. *Rodent ‚Äì rodents have two large, distinctive incisor teeth in front of their mouths. *Dog or other canine such as a coyote ‚Äì the corpse is doglike, but the eye ridge and feet do not match. *Sheep or other ovine ‚Äì although the face looks \\"somewhat ovine\\", sheep do not have sharp teeth. Palaeozoologist Darren Naish studied the photograph and concluded from the corpse's visible dentition, skull shape, and front paws that the creature was a raccoon, with its odd appearance merely a byproduct of decomposition and water action removing most of the animal's hair and some of its flesh. Naish disagreed with the idea that the legs were disproportionately long for a raccoon, providing an illustration of a raccoon's body superimposed over the corpse in the photograph. Jeff Corwin also identified the carcass as that of a raccoon in a Fox News interview.

In antiquity, the adjective unguentarius and its substantives referred to the perfume trade. is a small ceramic or glass bottle found frequently by archaeologists at Hellenistic and Roman sites, especially in cemeteries.Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, \\"The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria,\\" American Journal of Archaeology 91 (1987), p. 105. Its most common use was probably as a container for oil, though it is also suited for storing and dispensing liquid and powdered substances. Some finds date into the early Christian era.For examples, James Whitley, \\"Archaeology in Greece 2003‚Äì2004,\\" Archaeological Reports 50 (2003‚Äì2004), p. 66, with example dating from the 5th‚Äì7th century. From the 2nd to the 6th century they are more often made of blown glass rather than clay.Henry S. Robinson, \\"Pottery of the Roman Period: Chronology,\\" in The Athenian Agora, vol. 5 (American School of Classical Studies at Athens, 1959), pp. 15 and 118. A few examples are silver or alabaster.Virginia R. Anderson- Stojanovic, \\"The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria,\\" American Journal of Archaeology 91 (1987), p. 111, note 34. Unguentaria were used as product packaging in commerce and for funerary practice. They are distributed throughout the Mediterranean region of the Roman Empire from Israel to Spain, and north into Britain and Germania. Their manufacture was nearly as widespread.Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, \\"The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria,\\" American Journal of Archaeology 91 (1987), p. 105; E. Marianne Stern, \\"Glass Is Hot,\\" American Journal of Archaeology 106 (2002), p. 464. Forms and function The term unguentarium is functional rather than descriptive; that is, it refers to the purpose for which this relatively small vessel is thought to have been used and is not typological by shape.Natalia Vogelkoff-Brogan, \\"Late Hellenistic Pottery in Athens: A New Deposit and Further Thoughts on the Association of Pottery and Societal Change\\", Hesperia 69 (2000), p. 316. In its early development, the shape was modeled in miniature after larger amphoras, which would have been the original bulk shipping containers for products sold in the ungentaria.Susan I. Rotroff, \\"Hellenistic Pottery: Athenian and Imported Wheelmade Table Ware and Related Material\\", part 1: text, The Athenian Agora 29 (1997), p. 177, and \\"Fusiform Unguentaria,\\" in \\"Hellenistic Pottery: The Plain Wares\\", The Athenian Agora 33 (2006), p. 142. An unguentarium is not always distinguished in the scholarly literature from an ampulla,William Anderson, \\"An Archaeology of Late Antique Pilgrim Flasks,\\" Anatolian Studies 54 (2004), p. 82, with reference to John Hayes (1971), who categorized a wheel-made, fusiform ampulla as a \\"late Roman unguentarium.\\" a term from antiquity that may refer to these as well as other small vessels. In scholarship of the modern era, an unguentarium is sometimes called a lacrimarium (\\"tear-container\\") or balsamarium (\\"balsam-container\\"). All three terms reflect modern usage based on assumptions about their use, and no single word is found in ancient sources for the vessels.Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, \\"The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria\\", American Journal of Archaeology 91 (1987), pp. 105‚Äì106; Susan I. Rotroff, \\"Hellenistic Pottery: Athenian and Imported Wheelmade Table Ware and Related Material\\", part 1: text, The Athenian Agora 29 (1997), pp. 175‚Äì176, note 28. Small vessels of two shapes, usually but not always without handles, are referred to as unguentaria: * Fusiform ‚Äì The fusiform shape (example herehere) is characteristic of Hellenistic unguentaria: a heavy ovoid body resting usually on a small distinct ring foot, with a long tubular neck or cylindrical stem. The shape is comparable to a spindle (Latin fusus, \\"spindle\\").Homer A. Thompson, \\"Two Centuries of Hellenistic Pottery,\\" Hesperia 4 (1934), p. 472; Henry S. Robinson, \\"Pottery of the Roman Period: Chronology,\\" in The Athenian Agora, vol. 5 (American School of Classical Studies at Athens, 1959), p. 15; Nabil I. Khairy, \\"Nabataean Piriform Unguentaria,\\" Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 240 (1980), p. 85; Virginia R. Anderson- Stojanovic, \\"The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria,\\" American Journal of Archaeology 91 (1987), p. 106. These ovoid unguentaria first appear in Cyprus around the turn of the 4th and 3rd centuries BC.George H. McFadden, \\"A Tomb of the Necropolis of Ayios Ermoyenis at Kourion,\\" American Journal of Archaeology 50 (1946), p. 474. and may have been Near Eastern in origin or influence.Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, \\"The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria,\\" American Journal of Archaeology 91 (1987), p. 115. Early examples are similar in shape to the amphoriskos. They are believed to develop functionally from the lekythos, which they replace by the end of the 4th century BC.Nabil I. Khairy, \\"Nabataean Piriform Unguentaria,\\" Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 240 (1980), p. 85; Virginia R. Anderson- Stojanovic, \\"The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria,\\" American Journal of Archaeology 91 (1987), p. 106; Susan I. Rotroff, \\"Fusiform Unguentaria,\\" in \\"Hellenistic Pottery: The Plain Wares,\\" The Athenian Agora 33 (2006), p. 138 The fusiform unguentarium was in use for several centuries and the form shows many variations, including later examples with very slender profiles.Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, \\"The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria,\\" American Journal of Archaeology 91 (1987), p. 107. Glass unguentarium with conical base, late 1st or early 2nd century * Piriform ‚Äì The unguentarium with a footless body that is rounded or pear-shaped (Latin pirus, \\"pear\\") began to appear in the second half of the 1st century BC and is characteristic of the Roman era, particularly the early Principate.Nabil I. Khairy, \\"Nabataean Piriform Unguentaria,\\" Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 240 (1980), pp. 85‚Äì86; Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, \\"The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria,\\" American Journal of Archaeology 91 (1987), pp. 113‚Äì114; Patricia Maynor Bikai and Megan A. Perry, \\"Petra North Ridge Tombs 1 and 2: Preliminary Report,\\" Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 324 (2001), p. 66. These are regularly associated with graves in the 1st century.Henry S. Robinson, \\"Pottery of the Roman Period: Chronology,\\" in The Athenian Agora, vol. 5 (American School of Classical Studies at Athens, 1959), p. 85. The piriform unguentarium was in use for a limited period of about a hundred years and did not replace the fusiform.Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, \\"The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria\\", American Journal of Archaeology 91 (1987), p. 107. An exception to this chronology is the squat rounded unguentarium with painted bands found on the northeast coast of Spain and in other Iberian cemeteries, dated as early as the 5th century BC.Susan I. Rotroff, \\"Fusiform Unguentaria,\\" in \\"Hellenistic Pottery: The Plain Wares,\\" The Athenian Agora 33 (2006), pp. 138‚Äì139. The word bulbous is used rather confusingly in the scholarship to describe both forms. \\"Bulbous\\" appears as a synonym for \\"piriform\\", but is applied descriptively to the fusiform to distinguish certain examples from more slender profiles. Thin blown-glass bottles began to appear in Cyprus after the middle of the 1st century BC.George H. McFadden, \\"A Tomb of the Necropolis of Ayios Ermoyenis at Kourion,\\" American Journal of Archaeology 50 (1946), p. 480. The use of the new medium for unguentaria resulted in variations of form, including the thin, \\"test-tube\\" type. Glass unguentaria made in Thessaly, for example, often have a distinctive conical body, flared like the bell of a trumpet, or are squat and rounded with a very long neck; they come in a range of colors including aquamarine, pale green, and yellowish green, or may be colorless.Gladys Davidson Weinberg, \\"Evidence for Glass Manufacture in Ancient Thessaly,\\" American Journal of Archaeology 66 (1962) 129‚Äì133. This shape was popular in the 2nd and 3rd centuries and is also characteristic of Thrace and Cyprus.Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, \\"The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria,\\" American Journal of Archaeology 91 (1987), p. 113. Glass bird-shaped containers for cosmetics found at various Roman sites from Herculaneum to Spain have also been called unguentaria. In these examples, dating from the period of the piriform type, the neck has become a spout, and the profile is no longer vertical. As with other unguentaria, no clear distinction can be made between the use of these vessels for grooming in daily life, and their inclusion in tombs.Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, \\"The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria\\", American Journal of Archaeology 91 (1987), pp. 116‚Äì117; Josefina P√©rez- Arantegui, Juan √Ångel Paz-Peralta, and Esperanza Ortiz-Palomar, \\"Analysis of the Products Contained in Two Roman Glass unguentaria from the Colony of Celsa (Spain),\\" Journal of Archaeological Science 23 (1996), pp. 649‚Äì650, following C. Isings, Roman Glass from Dated Finds (Groningen-Djakarta 1957), on vessel form. Commercial and secular use In her typology of Hellenistic vessels at Athens used to contain and pour oil, Susan I. Rotroff classes unguentaria with plastic askoi as used for perfumed oil in bathing and grooming, but notes the diversity of craft tradition associated with them.Susan I. Rotroff, \\"Hellenistic Pottery: Athenian and Imported Wheelmade Table Ware and Related Material,\\" part 1: text, The Athenian Agora 29 (1997), pp. 6, 32, and 169. Most unguentaria from the Athenian agora were probably intended for secular use, as they are found in household dumps; the pattern of deposition in some wells, however, suggests votive offerings.Susan I. Rotroff, \\"Hellenistic Pottery: Athenian and Imported Wheelmade Table Ware and Related Material,\\" part 1: text, The Athenian Agora 29 (1997), p. 176. Roman glass unguentarium, 2nd century; asymmetry may indicate mass production It has been suggested that products shipped in bulk containers were dispensed for sale in these smaller vessels.Susan I. Rotroff, \\"Hellenistic Pottery: Athenian and Imported Wheelmade Table Ware and Related Material,\\" part 1: text, The Athenian Agora 29 (1997), p. 177; Stuart James Fleming, Roman Glass: Reflections on Cultural Change (University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology, 1999), p. 62. Perfumed oils, ointments, balsam, jasmine, kohl, honey, mastic, incense, scent powdersDiapasmata, mentioned by Pliny the Elder, Historia naturalis 13.3.19. and cosmetic preparations are among the contents proposed by scholars or evidenced by archaeology.Susan I. Rotroff, \\"Fusiform Unguentaria,\\" in \\"Hellenistic Pottery: The Plain Wares,\\" The Athenian Agora 33 (2006), p. 137; Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, \\"The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria,\\" American Journal of Archaeology 91 (1987), p. 115; Josefina P√©rez-Arantegui, Juan √Ångel Paz-Peralta, and Esperanza Ortiz-Palomar, \\"Analysis of the Products Contained in Two Roman Glass unguentaria from the Colony of Celsa (Spain),\\" Journal of Archaeological Science 23 (1996), p. 650‚Äì651. With their long slender necks, the vessels were most suited for dispensing liquids, oils, and powders. Roman examples of bulbous unguentaria have been found with traces of olive oil.Susan I. Rotroff, \\"Hellenistic Pottery: Athenian and Imported Wheelmade Table Ware and Related Material,\\" part 1: text, The Athenian Agora 29 (1997), p. 174‚Äì175, note 28. A sharp distinction should not be made between cosmetics and medicaments, as ingredients for these preparations often overlap.Nabil I. Khairy, \\"Nabataean Piriform Unguentaria,\\" Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 240 (1980), p. 88. Chemical analysis of red and pink substances in two glass unguentaria from the Ebro valley in Spain showed that they were likely cosmetics, but similar ingredients are found in therapeutic recipes.Josefina P√©rez-Arantegui, Juan √Ångel Paz-Peralta, and Esperanza Ortiz-Palomar, \\"Analysis of the Products Contained in Two Roman Glass unguentaria from the Colony of Celsa (Spain),\\" Journal of Archaeological Science 23 (1996) 649‚Äì655, with reference to literary sources on the preparation of cosmetics (pp. 654‚Äì655). The substances were a mixture of gypsum and calcite, tinted with hematite (red ochre), in an organic binder. The name \\"unguentarium\\" may be misleading, as solid unguents, or ointments, would be difficult to remove through the narrow neck.Josefina P√©rez-Arantegui, Juan √Ångel Paz-Peralta, and Esperanza Ortiz-Palomar, \\"Analysis of the Products Contained in Two Roman Glass unguentaria from the Colony of Celsa (Spain),\\" Journal of Archaeological Science 23 (1996), p. 650; Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, \\"The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria,\\" American Journal of Archaeology 91 (1987), p. 115. There is little or no evidence of how the contents were prevented from spilling, as no corks, wax or clay seals, or lead stoppers have been found with unguentaria as they have with other vessels.Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, \\"The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria,\\" American Journal of Archaeology 91 (1987), p. 114; Nicola Schreiber, The Cypro-Phoenician Pottery of the Iron Age (Brill, 2003), p. 63. The manufacture of unguentaria seems to occur in conjunction with the marketing of products.Josefina P√©rez-Arantegui, Juan √Ångel Paz-Peralta, and Esperanza Ortiz-Palomar, \\"Analysis of the Products Contained in Two Roman Glass unguentaria from the Colony of Celsa (Spain),\\" Journal of Archaeological Science 23 (1996), p. 650; Susan I. Potroff, \\"Fusiform Unguentaria,\\" in \\"Hellenistic Pottery: The Plain Wares,\\" The Athenian Agora 33 (2006), p. 157, with cautions on the difficulty of defining industries or determining whether the vessels were intended for local products or repackaging bulk imports. Roman glass unguentaria often have markings or lettering, usually on the base, that could indicate the manufacturer of the vessel or the supplier or dealer of the product inside.Stuart James Fleming, Roman Glass (University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology, 1999), pp. 65‚Äì66. Nabataean piriform wheel-thrown unguentaria show creative variations by potters, perhaps to establish brand identity for the product they contained. These vessels include some of the larger unguentaria and may have been used for shipping as part of the Nabataeans' active perfume trade.Nabil I. Khairy, \\"Nabataean Piriform Unguentaria,\\" Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 240 (1980), p. 86. Mass production of Roman blown-glass unguentaria is indicated by their frequent asymmetry, which results from speed and timing in shearing the neck from the blow-pipe. Recycled glass, as from a large, heavy broken bottle, could have been used to make many of the smaller unguentaria.Stuart James Fleming, Roman Glass (University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology, 1999), pp. 24 and 53. Funerary and religious context Achilles and Ajax play knucklebones on this late 6th-century lekythos, a type of oil-storing vessel associated with funeral rites before the unguentarium replaced it While unguentaria often appear among grave goods, the purpose of their inclusion has not been determined with certainty or may vary by site. Unguentaria found in burials range in size from miniatures (4‚Äì5 cm.) to large examples 20 to 30 cm. high.Virginia R. Anderson-Stojanovic, \\"The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria,\\" American Journal of Archaeology 91 (1987), pp. 105‚Äì106. The presence of the vessel in Hellenistic graves may indicate a revival of an earlier practice, attested in the 6th century by aryballoi and in some 5th- and early 4th-century burials by small lekythoi, which involved the deposit of a small container of perfume or oil with the dead.E.G. Pemberton, \\"Ten Hellenistic Graves in Ancient Corinth,\\" Hesperia 54 (1985), pp. 284‚Äì285. By the 3rd century, the black-figure lekythos with palmettes or Dionysiac scenes has been completely replaced as a standard grave good by the undecorated, \\"cruder\\" unguentarium, indicating a shift in burial practice that is characteristic of the period.Karen Stears, \\"Losing the Picture: Change and Continuity in Athenian Grave Monuments in the Fourth and Third Centuries B.C.,\\" in Word and Image in Ancient Greece, edited by N.K. Rutter and Brian A. Sparkes (Edinburgh University Press, 2000), p. 222. Although the unguentaria seem often to have been buried along with other objects associated with or treasured by the deceased or as grave gifts, they may have also have held a substance ‚Äî such as oil, wine, or powdered incense ‚Äî for a graveside ritual. The design of many unguentaria would not permit them to stand without support, but no stands have been found. Late Hellenistic gravestones depict unguentaria resting in a support, but they would also fit well in the palm of the hand, as shown in this Egyptian mummy portrait.From Roman Egypt, 2nd century A.D.; British Museum, information here. Ritual dispensing, rather than long-term storage, might explain both the lack of durability needed for use in daily life and the absence of stands, stoppers or seals.Virginia R. Anderson- Stojanovic, \\"The Chronology and Function of Ceramic Unguentaria,\\" American Journal of Archaeology 91 (1987) 114, 116, 119, 121; Nicola Schreiber, The Cypro-Phoenician Pottery of the Iron Age (Brill, 2003), p. 63; Susan I. Rotroff, \\"Fusiform Unguentaria,\\" in \\"Hellenistic Pottery: The Plain Wares,\\" The Athenian Agora 33 (2006), p. 139. There is no standard assemblage of grave goods for which an unguentarium was required. Unguentaria often appear among articles for personal grooming; in one example, with a stone cosmetics pallet, strigils, tweezers and a pyxis,George H. McFadden, \\"A Tomb of the Necropolis of Ayios Ermoyenis at Kourion,\\" American Journal of Archaeology 50 (1946), p. 463. and in another, with a pyxis, mirror, bronze scissors and tongs.Susan I. Rotroff, \\"Hellenistic Pottery: Athenian and Imported Wheelmade Table Ware and Related Material,\\" part 1: text, The Athenian Agora 29 (1997), p. 191. Gravestones from Anatolia depict the deceased with a similar group of objects, including mirror, comb, boxes and cistai, wool basket, and unguentaria.Susan I. Rotroff, \\"Fusiform Unguentaria,\\" in \\"Hellenistic Pottery: The Plain Wares,\\" The Athenian Agora 33 (2006), p. 139; Susan Walker, Ancient Faces: Mummy Portraits from Roman Egypt (Taylor & Francis, 2000) p. 123, citing numerous examples in M. Waelkens, Die kleinasiatische T√ºrsteine (Mainz 1982). One Athenian burial produced five bulbous unguentaria along with five knucklebones and a bronze needle; another, of a female child, contained an unguentarium, earrings, a blue glass pendant, and six knucklebones.Cedric G. Boulter, \\"Graves in Lenormant Street, Athens,\\" Hesperia 32 (1963), pp. 127‚Äì128. Knucklebones, widely used for divination, are common in burials; see, for instance, Jenifer Neils, \\"The Morgantina Phormiskos,\\" American Journal of Archaeology 96 (1992) 225‚Äì235. As playthings of the Child Zagreus, knucklebones are among the sacred objects in Dionysiac religion, which may also account for their inclusion; on these toys, see Clement of Alexandria, Protrepticus 2.17.2, and W.K.C. Guthrie, Orpheus and Greek Religion: A Study of the Orphic Movement (New York: Norton, 1966, revised edition), pp. 120‚Äì126. Gold leaves and unguentaria were the grave gifts in a burial chamber at Kourion in Cyprus.George H. McFadden, \\"A Tomb of the Necropolis of Ayios Ermoyenis at Kourion,\\" American Journal of Archaeology 50 (1946), p. 465. At Amisos (modern Samsun) in the Black Sea region of Turkey, the grave goods in the early Hellenistic tomb of a wealthy family were exceptionally rich and of outstanding workmanship, but the unguentaria were plain and made of clay. One of the bodies was adorned with gold earrings in the shape of Nike, ten gold appliqu√©s of Thetis riding a hippocamp, snake bracelets and bracelets with lion-head terminals, and other gold items; on the right side of the skull was placed a single clay unguentarium.Deniz Burcu Erciyas, Wealth, Aristocracy and Royal Propaganda under the Hellenistic Kingdom of the Mithradatids (Brill, 2005) pp. 67‚Äì72. Some graves contain multiple unguentaria, in one case numbering 31 of the fusiform type, while others hold a single example.Cedric G. Boulter, \\"Graves in Lenormant Street, Athens,\\" Hesperia 32 (1963), pp. 125‚Äì128. Grave gifts sometimes consisted of nothing but unguentaria.Susan I. Rotroff, \\"Hellenistic Pottery: Athenian and Imported Wheelmade Table Ware and Related Material,\\" part 1: text, The Athenian Agora 29 (1997), p. 183. Neither the piriform unguentaria nor thin blown-glass vessels occur in burials before the Augustan period.George H. McFadden, \\"A Tomb of the Necropolis of Ayios Ermoyenis at Kourion,\\" American Journal of Archaeology 50 (1946), p. 480 In Mainz, unguentaria are the most common grave gifts made of glass during the first half of the 1st century; in Gaul and Britain, glass unguentaria appear as containers for scented oils in both cremations and inhumations in this period and continuing into the 3rd century, but disappear by the 4th.Dorothy Watts, Religion in Late Roman Britain: Forces of Change (London: Routledge, 1998), p. 125, on the unguentaria as evidence of how quickly Roman burial customs were adopted in Britannia; E. Marianne Stern, \\"Glass Is Hot,\\" American Journal of Archaeology 106 (2002), pp. 464‚Äì465 on Gaul. Rock-cut tombs at Labraunda, investigated in 2005, contained unguentaria. The grave goods of Jewish ossuaries at Jericho in the Second Temple period often include unguentaria along with bowls, lamps, and various vessels ordinarily encountered in daily life.Rachel Hachlili, Ancient Jewish Art and Archaeology in the Land of Israel (Brill Archive, 1988), p. 97. Unguentaria have also been found in Athens in ritual pyres along with the burnt bones of animal sacrifice and smashed pottery.Susan I. Rotroff, \\"Hellenistic Pottery: Athenian and Imported Wheelmade Table Ware and Related Material,\\" part 1: text, The Athenian Agora 29 (1997), p. 212. A single unguentarium was buried with a dog, possibly a pet, in an industrial district in Athens.Susan I. Rotroff, \\"Fusiform Unguentaria,\\" in \\"Hellenistic Pottery: The Plain Wares,\\" The Athenian Agora 33 (2006), p. 139. The many unguentaria at the Latin town of Aricia reflect the growth of commerce to support ritual activities at the famous sanctuary of Diana there.Carin M.C. Green, Roman Religion and the Cult of Diana at Aricia (Cambridge University Press, 2007) pp. 39 and 294‚Äì295, where the term \\"unguentarium\\" is used as it was in antiquity for a shop that sells fragrances or medicaments. Examples Most ceramic unguentaria either lack surface decoration or have simple horizontal lines around the neck or body consisting most often of three narrow bands of white paint.Homer A. Thompson, \\"Two Centuries of Hellenistic Pottery,\\" Hesperia 4 (1934), p. 472; √ñnder Bilgi, \\"Ikiztepe in the Late Iron Age,\\" Anatolian Studies 49 (1999), p. 38; Natalia Vogelkoff-Brogan, \\"Late Hellenistic Pottery in Athens: A New Deposit and Further Thoughts on the Association of Pottery and Societal Change,\\" Hesperia 69 (2000), p. 316. Punic unguentarium found in the Phoenician necropolis of Puig des Molins Glass unguentaria vary widely in quality and show a range of colors. The Judean desert caves, for instance, yielded unguentaria of aquamarine glass with large bubbles.Gladys Davidson Weinberg and Dan Barag, \\"Glass Vessels,\\" in \\"Discoveries in the W√¢di ed- D√¢liyeh,\\" Annual of the American Schools of Oriental Research 41 (1974), pp. 103‚Äì104. A striking example of a glass fusiform unguentarium from 1st-century Syria, a little over six inches tall, has a white spiral curling around the cerulean body. The base comes to an elongated, rounded point, and the lip is well-formed and prominent. Techniques of \\"marbling,\\" intended to emulate fashionably extravagant vessels made of sardonyx during the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius, were used for unguentaria as well as bowls.Stuart James Fleming, Roman Glass: Reflections on Cultural Change (University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology, 1999), pp. 22‚Äì23, with illustrations of the technique. An exceptionally elaborate unguentarium was found in a cremation burial at Stobi in North Macedonia. Made of milky glass, the vessel has a globular body decorated with an egg-and-dart motif around the top and festoons and vine clusters around the bottom. The middle had six panels illustrating various vessels, with two examples each of the hydria, oenochoe and crater.James Wiseman and Djordje Mano-Zissi, \\"Excavations at Stobi, 1970,\\" American Journal of Archaeology 75 (1971), p. 405. In literature Antony and Cleopatra, 16th century marble relief by Giovanni Maria Mosca The use of the term \\"lacrimarium\\" or \\"lacrimatorium\\" (also \\"lacrymatory\\" or \\"lachrymatory\\") for unguentaria persisted because the small vessels were believed to have been used to collect the tears (lacrimae) of mourners to accompany the beloved in the grave. This belief was supported by a scriptural reference () translated in the King James Bible as \\"put thou my tears into thy bottle.\\"\\"You have stored my tears in your bottle,\\" Contemporary English Version, but \\"list my tears on your scroll\\" or alternatively \\"put my tears in your wineskin\\" in the New International Version. Shakespeare refers to the practice in Antony and Cleopatra, when Cleopatra chides the Roman for shedding few tears over the death of his wife: \\"Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill / With sorrowful water?\\"William Shakespeare, Antony and Cleopatra I.iii.6; The Riverside Shakespeare (Boston 1974), p. 1351, note 63. The minor Victorian poet Charles Tennyson Turner, brother of the more famous Tennyson, wrote a sonnet called \\"The Lachrymatory,\\" elaborating the idea of \\"the phial of his kinsman‚Äôs tears.\\" Since the early 20th century, the use of a vessel to collect tears of grief has been regarded as more poetic than plausible.Homer A. Thompson, \\"Two Centuries of Hellenistic Pottery.\\" Hesperia 4 (1934), p. 473; Virginia R.

They are a type of singular integral operator, meaning that they are given by a convolution of one function with another function having a singularity at the origin. Specifically, the Riesz transforms of a complex- valued function ∆í on Rd are defined by \\\\,dt}} for j = 1,2,...,d. The constant cd is a dimensional normalization given by :c_d = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi\\\\omega_{d-1}} = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma[(d+1)/2]}{\\\\pi^{(d+1)/2}}. where œâd‚àí1 is the volume of the unit (d ‚àí 1)-ball. The limit is written in various ways, often as a principal value, or as a convolution with the tempered distribution :K(x) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi\\\\omega_{d-1}} \\\\, p.v. \\\\frac{x_j}{x^{d+1}}. The Riesz transforms arises in the study of differentiability properties of harmonic potentials in potential theory and harmonic analysis. In particular, they arise in the proof of the Calder√≥n-Zygmund inequality . Multiplier properties The Riesz transforms are given by a Fourier multiplier. Indeed, the Fourier transform of Rj∆í is given by :\\\\mathcal{F}(R_jf)(x) = -i\\\\frac{x_j}{x}(\\\\mathcal{F}f)(x). In this form, the Riesz transforms are seen to be generalizations of the Hilbert transform. The kernel is a distribution which is homogeneous of degree zero. A particular consequence of this last observation is that the Riesz transform defines a bounded linear operator from L2(Rd) to itself.Strictly speaking, the definition () may only make sense for Schwartz function f. Boundedness on a dense subspace of L2 implies that each Riesz transform admits a continuous linear extension to all of L2. This homogeneity property can also be stated more directly without the aid of the Fourier transform. If œÉs is the dilation on Rd by the scalar s, that is œÉsx = sx, then œÉs defines an action on functions via pullback: :\\\\sigma_s^* f = f\\\\circ\\\\sigma_s. The Riesz transforms commute with œÉs: :\\\\sigma_s^* (R_jf) = R_j(\\\\sigma_x^*f). Similarly, the Riesz transforms commute with translations. Let œÑa be the translation on Rd along the vector a; that is, œÑa(x) = x + a. Then :\\\\tau_a^* (R_jf) = R_j(\\\\tau_a^*f). For the final property, it is convenient to regard the Riesz transforms as a single vectorial entity R∆í = (R1∆í,...,Rd∆í). Consider a rotation œÅ in Rd. The rotation acts on spatial variables, and thus on functions via pullback. But it also can act on the spatial vector R∆í. The final transformation property asserts that the Riesz transform is equivariant with respect to these two actions; that is, :\\\\rho^* R_j [(\\\\rho^{-1})^*f] = \\\\sum_{k=1}^d \\\\rho_{jk} R_kf. These three properties in fact characterize the Riesz transform in the following sense. Let T=(T1,...,Td) be a d-tuple of bounded linear operators from L2(Rd) to L2(Rd) such that * T commutes with all dilations and translations. * T is equivariant with respect to rotations. Then, for some constant c, T = cR. Relationship with the Laplacian Somewhat imprecisely, the Riesz transforms of f give the first partial derivatives of a solution of the equation :{(-\\\\Delta)^{\\\\frac{1}{2}} u = f}, where Œî is the Laplacian. Thus the Riesz transform of f can be written as: :{R f = abla (-\\\\Delta)^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}f} In particular, one should also have :R_iR_j\\\\Delta u = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2u}{\\\\partial x_i\\\\partial x_j}, so that the Riesz transforms give a way of recovering information about the entire Hessian of a function from knowledge of only its Laplacian. This is now made more precise. Suppose that u is a Schwartz function. Then indeed by the explicit form of the Fourier multiplier, one has :R_iR_j(\\\\Delta u) = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2u}{\\\\partial x_i\\\\partial x_j}. The identity is not generally true in the sense of distributions. For instance, if u is a tempered distribution such that \\\\Delta u \\\\in L^2 (\\\\R^d), then one can only conclude that :\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2u}{\\\\partial x_i\\\\partial x_j} = -R_iR_j\\\\Delta u + P_{ij}(x) for some polynomial P_{ij}.

Career After the war Thornton passed the bar and began to practice law in Clinton, Missouri, and served two terms on the town council. He served in the Missouri House of Representatives in 1876. Thornton relocated to New Mexico Territory in 1877, seeking a climate that would improve his health. He began to practice law in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and eventually formed a partnership with Thomas B. Catron. Though Thornton and Catron were both Confederate veterans from Missouri, Catron was a Republican, while Thornton was a Democrat. Thornton was also involved in several businesses, including mining, cattle ranching, real estate development, and land speculation. Thornton was a member of New Mexico Legislative Council in 1880. In 1891 he was elected the first mayor of Santa Fe, and he served one two-year term. In 1893 Thornton was appointed Governor, succeeding L. Bradford Prince.

Born in Berhampore, India, Banerjee received his bachelor's degree in engineering before moving to the United States, where he received master's degrees in physics and computer science. He worked in scientific fields for six years at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and Boeing in Seattle. In 2000 his childhood passion for art, coupled with a deep love and concern for the wilderness and disappearing indigenous cultures, caused him to leave his career in science and pursue art. Since then he has focused all his efforts on indigenous human rights and land conservation issues in the Arctic. In 2001 Banerjee began the first of two years of ground-breaking year-around field photography in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The photos he took were published in the book Seasons of Life and Land. Banerjee's photographs of the Refuge were exhibited at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History, and controversy erupted when his captions for the photos were altered and the exhibit was moved to a far corner of the museum. Senator Richard J. Durbin and others in Congress felt that the Smithsonian had been pressured, probably by Alaska Senator Ted Stevens, to remove the exhibit from the spotlight because Senator Barbara Boxer had held up Banerjee's book during a Senate floor debate over oil drilling in the Refuge. The museum maintained the changes were made \\"for artistic reasons\\".Censorship or Politics? Views Differ Over Exhibit The attention brought by the controversy led the exhibit to travel to sixteen museums around the United StatesFinis Dunaway, \\"Reframing the Last Frontier: Subhankar Banerjee and the Visual Politics of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge\\", in A Keener Perception: Ecocritical Studies in American Art History, The University of Alabama Press, 2009 and since then Banerjee's work has been exhibited in more than fifty museums around the world.Amon Carter Museum of American Art, introduction to \\"Subhankar Banerjee: Where I Live I Hope to Know\\" http://www.cartermuseum.org/exhibitions/subhankar-banerjee-where-i-live-i- hope-to-know Banerjee has received many awards for his Arctic work including an inaugural Greenleaf Artist Award from the United Nations Environment Programme and an inaugural Cultural Freedom Fellowship from the Lannan Foundation. Banerjee was an artist-in-residence at Dartmouth College and the Sea Change Artist-Activist Resident at the Gaea Foundation in 2009.

Sharpe began his career as a boy player acting female roles, then switched to male roles in his young adulthood.Andrew Gurr, The Shakespeare Company 1594-1642, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004; p. 240. The Duchess of Malfi Sharpe's earliest known role was, arguably, both his most significant and his most controversial. The first edition of John Webster's The Duchess of Malfi, printed in 1623, contains the earliest cast list in English Renaissance drama. The list states that Sharpe originated the title role of the Duchess. The 1623 cast list actually covers two separate productions, the premiere staging and a later revival. * The original starred Richard Burbage and is usually dated to c. 1614. It must have occurred prior to William Ostler's death in December 1614, since Ostler played the role of Antonio. * The revival production starred Burbage's replacement Joseph Taylor, and so must have taken place after Burbage's March 1619 death. Scholars date it to c. 1621. The cast list holds that Sharpe played the Duchess in both of these productions; he would have been perhaps 12 years old for the first, and about 19 for the second (though the dates of both the productions and of Sharpe's birth are not certain). Some commentators blanche at the idea of a 12-year-old boy playing such a prominent woman's role; and some have assigned the part in the first production to the more experienced Richard Robinson,Colin Gibson, ed., Six Renaissance Tragedies, New York, St. Martin's Press, 1997; p. 243. or to Alexander Cooke, the veteran who is thought by some to have originated many Shakespearean heroines. (Cooke, however, died in February 1614, necessitating an earlier date for the original production.) The subject of boy players in female roles is controversial and long-disputed. A cautious approach would rely on the testimony of the evidentiary record, which assigns the role of the Duchess of Malfi to Sharpe. Other roles Sharpe originated other female roles in ensuing years. the cast lists added to the second Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1679 credit Sharpe with parts in the King's Men's premiere productions of: * The Custom of the Country * The Double Marriage * The False One * The Humorous Lieutenant * The Island Princess * The Knight of Malta * The Laws of Candy * The Little French Lawyer * The Lovers' Progress * The Loyal Subject * The Mad Lover * The Prophetess * Women Pleased -- in the 1616-24 era.

Johnson, W. R. Elton and William B. Long, eds., Dover, DE, University of Delaware Press, 1989, p. 145. -- that is, a partner in the company rather than a mere hired player. Sharpe then switched from important female roles to important male roles -- a transition that some boy players (like Robinson or Stephen Hammerton) executed more successfully than others (like John Honyman). Sharpe played Parthenius in the company's production of Philip Massinger's The Roman Actor (1626), Ferdinand the general in the same author's The Picture (1629), Lysander in Lodowick Carlell's The Deserving Favourite (also 1629), Wittworth in John Clavell's The Soddered Citizen (1630), and the King of the Lombards in Arthur Wilson's The Swisser (1631).

It is part of the Marvel Zombies series. The series is written by Fred Van Lente, penciled by Kev Walker, with covers by Greg Land.WWPhilly Fred Van Lente Takes a Bite of Marvel Zombies , Wizard, May 31, 2008WW Philly: Fred Van Lente Writes \\"Marvel Zombies 3\\", Comic Book Resources, June 1, 2008WW PHILLY '08: Fred Van Lente on Marvel Zombies 3, Newsarama, June 1, 2008Van Lente talks Marvel Zombies 3, Comic Book Resources, September 5, 2008Zombies in Florida: Fred Van Lente on Marvel Zombies III, Newsarama, October 3, 2008 Plot Zombies invade Earth-616, the original Marvel Universe, by entering through the Nexus of Realities in Florida. Siege, Jennifer Kale, Wundarr and the Conquistador (Juan Ponce de Le√≥n, who as a Roman Catholic regards his foes as demons), local members of the Fifty-State Initiative, investigate but are attacked by zombie DeadpoolMarvel Zombies 3 #1 (December 2008) and a few zombified civilians. The zombies kill the Conquistador, and infect Siege and Wundarr. A horrified Kale destroys Deadpool's body with an airboat. Siege's robotics detect the biological corruption and he self-terminates. Wundarr goes into hibernation to purge himself. A traumatized Jennifer Kale awaits in an observation room back at headquarters. Back at A.R.M.O.R., Machine Man and Jocasta travel to the Marvel Zombie universe to find DNA with Little Sky so they can find an uninfected human for Morbius, now an A.R.M.O.R. scientist, to make a vaccine against the zombie plague so the 616 heroes can be inoculated against the virus. While the heroes are gone, it is revealed that Morbius is the zombie version, who has kidnapped the real one. The two heroes find that \\"human\\" readings are really coming from clones generated by the zombie Kingpin, via his resources and created by the zombie Jackal, now used as the zombies' sole food source under Kingpin's control. As they watch, the zombified Inhumans arrive and are welcomed by Kingpin (who tells the now prolix Black Bolt to shut up). Machine Man and Jocasta stumble upon Vanessa Fisk, who is uninfected. She tells them that the Kingpin is keeping her safe. She allows Jocasta to get a blood sample, but declines an offer to escape to Earth-616, preferring to stay behind with her husband. Looking at the dead and dying bodies in the pit, Machine Man is overcome with pity, realizing that the zombies are treating the clones the way humans treat robots. He leaves Jocasta, goes into battle mode and destroys the clones out of mercy and gets attacked by the zombies, and he has destroyed their food source. A severely injured and sessile zombie Doctor Strange appears in the plot line; has only the powers to create manna (ironically inedible for the zombies) and to see other dimensions. He thus reveals A.R.M.O.R.'s operations on Earth-616. Machine Man sees that the impostor Morbius used Deadpool to create a distraction so that he could set his plans in motion. On the real Marvel Universe, a female team member finds the real Morbius captive. The infected version attacks and turns her, causing a zombie outbreak that quickly overtakes the entire facility. Little Sky returns Jocasta to A.R.M.O.R. without Machine Man, who didn't meet them on time, and Jocasta requests that Machine Man be given posthumous honors. Jocasta discovers Morbius is a zombie, and one zombie uses the A.R.M.O.R. teleporters to escape this reality. In the zombie universe, Machine Man defeats the zombies, leaving only zombie Lockjaw, whom Machine Man uses to teleport back to A.R.M.O.R., where he kills the zombies. (Immediately thereafter he queries Jocasta about having some \\"...sweet, sweet robot love\\" in a secluded spot, whereupon they kiss.) The real Morbius kills his zombie counterpart and escapes. Jocasta and Machine Man return to S.H.I.E.L.D., and Morbius volunteers to follow the zombie that teleported away, along with a new team of Midnight Sons. Sequel The end of the final issue sets-up the next part of the Marvel Zombies saga Marvel Zombies 4: Midnight Sons.Marvel Zombies 3 #4 Covers Unlike the prior Marvel Zombies series covers, which were zombie variations of past Marvel comics covers, Marvel Zombies 3 covers are variants of well-known movie posters. Art by Greg Land. * Issue #1 is a reference to the Army of Darkness movie poster. * Issue #2 is a reference to the 28 Days Later movie poster. * Issue #3 is a reference to The Evil Dead movie poster. * Issue #4 is a reference to the US Shaun of the Dead movie poster. The variant cover for issue #1 is an Arthur Suydam Zombie version of Machine Man #1, originally by Jack Kirby. The second printing of #1 features a variant cover by Kev Walker, using story art from the issue. Reception Paukolo reviewed the first issue for Comics Bulletin and was happy with the story although he knocked off half a point for the ending. The writing is \\"briskly paced, humorous, and loaded with references that makes me think we read the same comics growing up\\" according to McCoy, who said it measures up well against its predecessors, suggesting that it is \\"rough-hewn and hearkens back to Philips' work on the previous series, but lacks the detailed gore of those stories\\".Marvel Zombies 3 #1 review, Comics Bulletin Timothy Callahan at Comic Book Resources agrees, stating that Van Lente's writing \\"balances the sick humor with an engaging plot, providing a few twists and turns in just a single issue\\" and Walker's contribution is \\"streamlined an effective, with a kind of blocky Steve Dillon vibe.\\"Marvel Zombies 3 #1 review, Comic Book Resources Collected editions The series has been collected into an individual volume: *Marvel Zombies 3 (104 pages, hardcover, May 2009, , softcover, December 2009, ) See also *Marvel Zombies *Marvel Zombies 2 *Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness *Marvel Apes ReferencesExternal links  Category:Marvel Zombies Category:Comics by Fred Van Lente ","title":"Marvel Zombies 3"},{"id":"18674256","text":"Maryan Marushchak (; born 10 May 1979) is a professional Ukrainian football goalkeeper who plays for FC Lviv in the Ukrainian Premier League.

After spending the 2000 season out of football, Richardson was signed by the XFL's New York/New Jersey Hitmen early in the season. As part of a kayfabe quarterback controversy, Richardson (who, as part of the sports entertainment approach the XFL used, was given an angle in which his larger hands were an advantage he had over his small-handed predecessor, local native Charley Puleri) was given the starting quarterback job in week 3, a position he held for the rest of the year. Immediately after the Hitmen's season ended, Richardson joined the Arena Football League's Los Angeles Avengers, he was waived prior to training camp in 2002.

From 1918 to 2010, he held the record as the youngest ever Australian Member of Parliament. Early life Born in Victoria, he was educated in Western Australia at Perth Boys' School, and enlisted for military service in June 1915, after having previously been rejected. He served at Gallipoli and later in France, where he was wounded twice, first at Pozi√®res and later at Flers, before being invalided to England because of injury to his eyes, the result of a gas attack. On his return to Western Australia in May 1917, he worked as a clerk in the records branch of the Western Australian Lands Department and was an active member of the Labour Party. Political career=Federal politics At the age of 21, Corboy unsuccessfully contested the 1917 Subiaco by-election for a seat in the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia. He was subsequently elected to the Australian House of Representatives in the 1918 by-election for the Division of Swan. He won the by-election in somewhat unusual circumstances, winning the safe Nationalist seat for the Labor Party. The conservative vote was split because two conservative parties, the Nationalists and the Country Party, both contested the election. Corboy, received the highest number of primary votes and won the \\"first past the post\\" contest. This unexpected outcome led to the introduction of preferential voting in Australia. Corboy, who was 22 when he was elected, became the youngest person ever elected to the House of Representatives and held that record until Wyatt Roy, aged 20, won the Division of Longman in the 2010 federal election. Corboy made his maiden House of Representatives speech in November 1918, during a parliamentary debate on the Defence Bill. The Argus reported that Corboy \\"disagreed with the idea of allowing courts-martial to try soldiers for murder and to punish them with death.\\" The newspaper further reported that Corboy spoke clearly and with confidence, creating a good impression. In 1919, Corboy was censured by the central executive of the Victorian branch of the Labour party for supporting the deportation of all aliens interned during World War I from Australia. The executive, in condemning Corboy, claimed his stance was \\"inconsistent with principles of liberty and justice\\". Corboy, who was active in representing the interests of repatriated and demobilised veterans, had expressed concern that jobs in Western Australia's timber industry were being filled with Austrians released from internment and returning to their old jobs, while returned soldiers were not able to obtain work. Corboy was a state delegate to the federal executive of the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League (RSSIL), a predecessor of the Returned Services League, and in 1919 attended the RSSIL's fourth annual conference in Adelaide. In June 1919, Corboy made a speech to dock workers, following a period of industrial unrest, including riots, at the Fremantle wharf. He called for a federal election and stated that he would \\"a thousand times rather have been wounded in a wharf riot in Fremantle than fighting for the capitalistic rulers of the world in France\\". The comments were strongly criticised by the Kalgoorlie branch of the Returned Soldiers' Association, who called for his replacement as a Western Australian delegate to the federal executive of the RSSIL. In the 1919 Australian federal election, Corboy again stood for the seat of Swan, where he won the primary vote but was defeated on preferences by the Country Party's John Prowse. Western Australian state politics After his defeat in 1919, Corboy remained involved in Labour politics and in 1919 was elected to the Western Australian Legislative Assembly as the member for Yilgarn. In 1921, Corboy supported Edith Cowan in voicing disagreement with a policy allowing only male guests to the Speaker's gallery. Corboy was a member of the parliamentary select committee appointed to inquire into the cashing out of soldiers' war gratuity bonds. In 1927 Corboy expressed his support for the abolition of capital punishment in Western Australia, stating that the death penalty was not a deterrent to serious crime. Capital punishment was only formally abolished in Western Australia in 1984. In 1930, Corboy became the member for Yilgarn-Coolgardie, a new seat incorporating his former seat. A challenge to the validity of his election was mounted by a fellow Labor candidate, George Lambert, but was dismissed. However, Lambert defeated Corboy for Labor preselection prior to 1933 state election. After politics In 1939 Corboy was again called to military service, serving until 1945, when he returned to Australia and worked as a public servant in Perth. He died in on 6 August 1950. After his death, he was described by the Daily News as \\"one of the most colourful people in Australian politics\\".

Founded in 1941 and disbanded in 1949, the Columbus Philharmonic was the first professional symphony orchestra in Columbus and was a precursor to the present Columbus Symphony Orchestra. The orchestra's music director was the American conductor Izler Solomon. History The orchestra was founded in 1941 and presented concerts in Franklin County Memorial Hall (now the Franklin County Board of Elections building). Originally the orchestra was semi-professional with all of its principal chairs occupied by full-time professional players. Many of these musicians were imported to Columbus from Chicago, Cleveland and elsewhere due to a shortage of local players during World War II. In 1946, it became a full-time professional orchestra, the first in Columbus. In 1949 the fledgling eight-year-old orchestra was disbanded by its board of trustees due to an inability to continue raising the funds necessary to produce its concerts. The orchestra's concerts were broadcast several times nationally on the NBC Radio network. Live recordings preserving the sound of the Philharmonic exist, having been made during concerts by Robert Buchsbaum's local recording company, Coronet Records. Buchsbaum was also the orchestra's principal oboist. One of these, Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4 with Artur Schnabel as soloist, was issued on CD by the Pearl label in 1995. The music director during the entire life of the Columbus Philharmonic was Izler Solomon. Solomon later became music director of the Indianapolis Symphony. Solomon wanted to hire African American musicians, and brought in Carolyn Utz, a bassist, around 1944 as the orchestra's first black musician. In 1951, the Philharmonic's former concertmaster, George Hardesty, started the Columbus Little Symphony. From this group evolved the present Columbus Symphony Orchestra.

Ateneo and UE continue their streaks of playoff appearances, as UST returns after a three- year absence. The FEU Tamaraws were the first defending champions not to qualify for the semifinals. Ateneo Blue Eagles The Eagles entered the season as one of the preseason favorites. After winning a nailbiter against lowly NU Bulldogs on Opening Day, the Eagles went on an 8-game winning streak, sweeping the first round, and surviving squeakers against Adamson and FEU, and blowing out UST by 36 points, 114‚Äì78 on the first round finale through a high scoring second quarter. The second round was more of the same, when Ateneo again survived another 1-point game against the Falcons. However, they were dealt with their first setback in an overtime loss against the Growling Tigers, who were without three players due to injuries and ailments. Despite the loss, the Eagles were already assured of a twice-to-beat advantage at the semi-finals. They also dropped their last assignment, a no-bearing game against the Warriors at the last day of eliminations. UE Red Warriors Returning with an intact lineup, the hosts also emerged as one of the preseason tournaments. However, the first round was mixed, as they were beaten by UST and Ateneo, but they finished second. On the second round, UE was unbeaten, winning four straight (including the last game of the first round). However, UE was beaten by Adamson in an overtime thriller. After UST's victory of Adamson in the first game, UE is now assured of a twice-to-beat advantage at the semifinals. UST Growling Tigers The Growling Tigers opened the season with a stunning loss against the UP Fighting Maroons on a buzzer-beater shot by Marvin Cruz. However, they beat the defending champions Far Eastern and top seeds East in two closely fought games. With setbacks against National, Adamson and a blowout loss against Ateneo, their Final Four aspirations were cast in doubt. Santo Tomas opened their second round with another loss against UE. But they broke the .500 barrier with successive wins against National, Far Eastern, and an overtime win against Ateneo. Flirting a possible twice-to-beat advantage at the semifinals, the Maroons dealt the Tigers another defeat. With their fates not in their hands, they've beaten the Soaring Falcons in a tightly contested game. With Ateneo's drubbing of Far Eastern, the Tigers entered the Final Four for the first time since 2002. Adamson Soaring Falcons The Falcons is the only team not to enter the men's Final Four since the league instituted it in 1994. Seeking to end the streak, the Falcons had their first win against the Bulldogs, after being demolished by the hosts in their opening game. But Adamson still faced a rocky ride, losing to top contenders, Ateneo and FEU but beating UP and UST to end the first round with an even 3‚Äì3 record. Opening the second round, Adamson was beaten again by FEU and Ateneo. But with center Ken Bono posting MVP numbers, Adamson brought itself in the hunt for that elusive Final Four berth. They were able to demolish UP and upset UE in overtime. They lost to UST before closing out the second round with a win over NU. With Ateneo's defeat of Far Eastern, Adamson barged outright into their first Final Four appearance. Third-seed playoffBracketSemifinals=Ateneo-Adamson series This was the Soaring Falcons' first Final Four appearance. Adamson gave Ateneo two one-point victories in the elimination round, with the Eagles escaping due to their endgame heroics. A see-saw game until the fourth quarter, when Ken Bono of the Falcons converting a three-point play with 18.3 seconds remaining, to cut the Ateneo lead to, 74‚Äì73. On the inbound pass, Blue Eagle Chris Tiu threw an errant pass to Macky Escalona who failed to retrieve it. On the next possession, Soaring Falcon Patrick Cabahug missed a fadeaway jumper, which led to an Atenean rebound. The Falcons left with no choice but to foul Chris Tiu, who calmly sank his two freethrows, thereby eliminating the Falcons from contention. UE-UST series Season host was favored in this matchup, with several veterans in the lineup. The Tigers have no players with playoff experience, save for Jemal Vizcarra who was out of the season by the second game due to an Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. UST won the first game 91‚Äì77, while UE won the second game, 74‚Äì63 in the elimination round. UE's loss was the third time in tournament history where they were booted out of the semifinals armed with the twice-to-beat advantage (1994, 2002 and 2006). UE's last Finals appearance was on 1991. =First game= UST led for much of the game, when the Warriors started making inroads by the third quarter. With 21.1 seconds left in the fourth quarter, and with UST up by two points, June Cortez of UST converted a three-point play that gave the Growling Tigers enough breathing space to force a deciding elimination game. =Second game= With the Tigers off to a hot start, the Warriors kept within striking distance. In the fourth quarter, the Warriors forced a 70-all deadlock - the first in the game. UE then led by as much as five points, but the Tigers fought back, forcing turnovers and grabbing offensive rebounds, to tie the score at 79-all. After a UE turnover, Jojo Duncil missed the shot, but Jervy Cruz grabbed the offensive rebound, missing the put-back; Duncil then tipped in the ball for a two-point field goal, plus a foul. Duncil completed the three-point play. On the next possession, UE's Marcy Arellano drove unmolested to the basket, cutting the lead into one point. With a UST turnover and several seconds remaining, Red Warrior Jorel Ca√±izares missed a medium-range jump shot. Ca√±izares grabbed his own rebound but missed on a short stab; Warriors team captain Robert Labagala grabbed the rebound as time expired. Finals The Growling Tigers and the Blue Eagles met each other for the first time in the UAAP Finals. The last time they met in the Finals was in the 1931 NCAA season, in which the Ateneo won. Game One The game was close all throughout, with neither team leading by double figures. It ended in the fourth quarter with two crucial plays. With 4.3 seconds to go, Tigers forward Allan Evangelista made a tough fadeaway shot over the outstreched arms of Doug Kramer, pushing UST ahead of Ateneo, 72‚Äì71, with 1 second to go. Ateneo coach Norman Black immediately called a time-out over the tumultuous din of the rejoicing UST fans. In the inbound play, Macky Escalona found a wide open Doug Kramer on the paint, and the Ateneo forward calmly banked the ball in for the win, sending the Ateneo fans, in turn, into a wild frenzy. Game Two The Eagles, although led early, were down by a point at the end of the first half. The Tigers broke the zone defense by hitting outside shots and by grabbing offensive rebounds off their misses. JC Intal kept the Eagles at striking distance but his supporting cast wasn't enough as the Tigers cruised into a Game 2 victory, and forced a winner-take-all Game 3. Game Three UST gallery at Game 3. *Finals Most Valuable Player: * With a tightly contested first quarter, the Intal-Escalona connection of the Eagles threatened to pull away at the second quarter, leading by as much as ten. In the third quarter, the Tigers stormed back, keeping in touch with the Blue Eagles. In the dying minutes of the fourth quarter, rookie sensation Jervy Cruz fouled out with 1:16 left; Evangelista, the almost-hero of Game 1, fouled out two minutes earlier. With a 64‚Äì59 Ateneo lead, Anthony Espiritu scored a three-pointer on the UST offense. Mark Canlas scored a put-back to tie the game. Intal missed a short jumper at the other end for force overtime. With the score tied 74-all, June Cortez missed a jumper; Dylan Ababou was fouled as he grabbed the rebound. Ababou split his charities, which led to another JC Intal miss in the final seconds. The rebound was hotly contested, and the referee called for a jump ball; the possession arrow pointed to UST. Eric Salamat was forced to foul June Cortez, who converted his first and missed his second, which led to the Ateneo rebound with 3.6 ticks left.

He was a Ministerialist member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly from 1897 to 1911, representing the electorates of North Coolgardie (1897-1901) and Menzies (1901-1911). He was state Minister for Mines from 1901 to 1904 under George Leake and Walter James and Minister for Mines and Railways from 1905 to 1911 under Hector Rason, Newton Moore and Frank Wilson. He rose to become Treasurer from 1910 to 1911, a role that also entailed him acting as Premier if Wilson was absent, but lost his seat at the 1911 state election. He subsequently entered federal politics as a member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1913 until his death in 1940, representing the electorates of Dampier (1911-1922) and Swan (1922-1940). He was initially a member of the Commonwealth Liberal Party and its successor the Nationalist Party, but joined the new Country Party in 1920 and was its deputy leader from 1921 to 1922. Early life and working career Gregory was born in Kyneton, Victoria, where he was educated. He opened a tinsmithing and ironmongering business at Rochester aged 16, but 1892, with his business failing, went to Western Australia to prospect on the goldfields with little success. He worked for the Askin & Nicholson storekeepers at the Ninety-Mile camp on the Menzies road before relocating to Menzies township in December 1894. He was the proprietor of two hotels, the Pioneer Hotel and Menzies Hotel, floated two mining companies in 1896 (the \\"Menzies Compass\\" and the \\"Menzies Tornado\\"), opened the North Coolgardie Herald & Menzies Times newspaper in 1896 and bought out its rival the Menzies Miner in 1898. He was also often described in profiles as having been variously a hotel, stock and share broker at Menzies. He was chairman of the Menzies Progress Committee and became the first mayor of the new Municipality of Menzies from 1896 to 1897. He was appointed as a justice of the peace in 1897. He was also involved in the formation of an \\"Anti-Asiatic League\\" at Menzies, and advocated for the quarantining of all arrivals from Asia. Later in life, he would serve as the Western Australian representative on the Australian Board of Control for International Cricket (now Cricket Australia). State politics In 1897, he was elected to the Western Australian Legislative Assembly as the member for the new seat of North Coolgardie, narrowly defeating future federal MP Hugh Mahon in a bitter contest, and transferred to the Menzies electorate in 1901. He was promoted to the ministry as Minister for Mines in the short-lived First Leake Ministry of 1901; he subsequently returned in the Second Leake Ministry later that year. Gregory then served in the ministry continuously until his defeat in 1911, as Minister for Mines 1901‚Äì1904, Minister for Mines and Railways 1905‚Äì1911, and acting Premier and Treasurer 1910‚Äì1911. As Minister for Mines, Gregory consolidated the state's ten pieces of mining legislation into one consolidated act, reportedly colloquially known as \\"Gregory's Act\\", established the Kalgoorlie School of Mines, made numerous reforms to the mining leases system, and introduced the system of building state batteries to process gold. In 1904, while Minister for Mines, Kalgoorlie tabloid newspaper The Sun made allegations about Gregory's handling of a mining lease dispute, leading to the landmark imprisonment of its editor, John Drayton under parliamentary privilege after Drayton refused to appear before a parliamentary committee into the incident. Gregory lost his seat at the 1911 election, at which the Ministerialists were badly defeated by Labor. He had reportedly grown considerably more conservative during his time in state politics, contributing to his eventual defeat. He attempted to re-enter parliament at a by-election for the Metropolitan Suburban electorate of the Legislative Council the following month, but was again defeated. Following the loss of his state seat, he spent two years farming on a 6000-acre pastoral property 30 miles east of Wickepin. Federal politics In 1913, Gregory was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as the member for Dampier, representing the Commonwealth Liberal Party. In 1917, together with the rest of his party, he became a Nationalist. In 1920, the Country Party was formed, and Gregory was one of several Nationalist MPs to join it. He was the party's deputy leader from 21 April 1921 until his resignation due to policy differences on 22 February 1922. The abolition of Dampier led him to contest the seat of Swan at the 1922 election, while party colleague and member for Swan John Prowse contested the new seat of Forrest. In federal parliament, he was a long-serving member of the Public Works Committee (1914-26 and 1929-31) and its chairman from 1917 to 1926. He was also a member of the 1913 Royal Commission on the pearling industry, 1914 Royal Commission into powellized timber and the 1927-28 Royal Commission into the Australian moving picture industry. He frequently clashed with his conservative colleagues over tariff issues to protect Western Australian interests, and in 1932, he advocated a referendum to amend the Constitution to allow Western Australia to set its own customs and excise duties for 25 years; when this did not meet with support, he became a supporter of the 1933 Western Australian secession referendum. Gregory died at Mount St. Evin's Hospital in Melbourne in 1940, aged 80 and then the oldest member of the House of Representatives, following a short illness, although he was said to have been in indifferent health for several years. He was granted a state funeral, held at Melbourne's St Patrick's Cathedral in Melbourne, and buried at Fawkner Cemetery.
