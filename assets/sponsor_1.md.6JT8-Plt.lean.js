To test its new antibiotic, trovafloxacin (Trovan), Pfizer gave 100 children trovafloxacin, while another 100 received the gold-standard anti-meningitis treatment, ceftriaxone, a cephalosporin antibiotic. Pfizer gave the children a substantially reduced dose of the ceftriaxone (specifically, 33mg/kg) relative to that described on the US FDA-approved prescribing information. The allegation is that this was done to skew the test in favor of its own drug. Pfizer claimed that the dose used was sufficient even though a clinical trial performed by Médecins Sans Frontières recommends a dose of 50-100mg/kg. A 2002 report by the World Bank described the military government that ruled Nigeria at the time of these events as \\"pervasively corrupt\\". It further cites widespread comments by business managers in Nigeria characterizing the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) of that period as lacking the capabilities needed to perform its regulatory role and \\"harassing business and seeking bribes\\" rather than \\"protecting businesses and consumers\\". Five children given trovafloxacin died, as did six of those given ceftriaxone. The lead investigator, Dr. Abdulhamid Isa Dutse, later provided a letter of approval for human trials that was found to be falsified. The Nigerian government called the trial \\"an illegal trial of an unregistered drug\\". It has been alleged that participants and their families were not told that they were part of a trial, and that Médecins Sans Frontières was offering the standard treatment in another part of the same building.Goldacre, Ben. Bad Pharma. Fourth Estate, 2012, pp. 117–118. Pfizer acknowledged reducing the dose of the standard treatment, but said this was done to minimize injection-site pain, and that the mortality rates in both the trovafloxin and ceftriaxone arms of its trial were lower than among those treated with chloramphenicol by Médecins Sans Frontières. The survivors of the trial tried to bring a number of legal actions against Pfizer in the United States. These resulted in four judicial opinions, the first three dismissing the claims on procedural grounds. According to Ben Goldacre, Pfizer argued that it was not required to obtain informed consent for experimental drug trials in Africa, and that any case should be heard in Nigeria. In May 2006 Representative Tom Lantos of California, the senior Democrat on the House International Relations Committee, described the findings of a report compiled about the case by the Nigerian government as \\"absolutely appalling\\" and called for Pfizer to open its records. In January 2009 the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that the Nigerian victims and their families were entitled to bring suit against Pfizer in the United States under the Alien Tort Statute. Pfizer subsequently settled the case out of court with a $75 million settlement that was subject to a confidentiality clause. Overall, the 1996 meningitis epidemic in northern Nigeria killed about 12,000 people, during the worst known meningitis outbreak in Sub-Saharan Africa. Abdullahi v. Pfizer, Inc. I Nigeria's position on the African continent Chemical structure of trovafloxacin .In 2002, a group of Nigerian minors and their guardians sued Pfizer in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Plaintiffs alleged that \\"they suffered grave injuries from an experimental antibiotic administered by defendant Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) without their informed consent\\".Abdullahi v. Pfizer, Inc, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17436 at *1 (S.D.N.Y. September 17, 2002) (Abdullahi I). On 29 August 2001, plaintiffs brought this action under the Alien Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1350,Although titled the Alien Tort Claims Act, the Abdullahi Court refers to the act consistently as the \\"Alien Tort Statute\\" \\"because the statute is purely jurisdictional in nature, and does not provide a private cause of action\\". Abdullahi v. Pfizer, Inc, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16126, at *1 n. 1. to recover damages for Pfizer's alleged violations of the Nuremberg Code, the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and customary international law (otherwise known as the \\"law of nations\\"). The District Court summarized the Nigerian plaintiffs’ allegations as follows: > In the mid-1990s, Pfizer developed Trovafloxacin Mesylate, an antibiotic > that is also known by its brand name as \\"Trovan\\". Pfizer projected that its > total annual sales could exceed $ 1 billion a year. (Compl. P 96.) Beginning > in 1996, Pfizer conducted the largest drug testing program ever undertaken > by enrolling thousands of participants in clinical tests. (Compl. P 97.) > However, prior animal testing indicated that Trovan might cause significant > side effects in children such as joint disease, abnormal cartilage growth > (osteochondrosis, a disease resulting in bone deformation) and liver damage. > (Compl. PP 98-99.) In 1996, epidemics of bacterial meningitis, measles and > cholera besieged the impoverished Nigerian city of Kano. (Compl. PP 2, 5, > 101.) In April 1996, six weeks after it first learned of the epidemics, > Pfizer dispatched a medical team to establish a treatment center at Kano's > Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH). (Compl. PP 2, 8, 101-02, 101-07, 109.) In > addition to Pfizer team, humanitarian organizations such as Medecins Sans > Frontieres (MSF), also known as Doctors Without Borders, traveled to Kano's > IDH to treat the sick. (Compl. P 5.) The medical teams operated under > squalid conditions in a hospital consisting of several single story cinder > block buildings, some of which lacked electricity and running water. (Compl. > P 110.) The beds were filled to capacity and patients seeking care > overflowed on to the hospital's grounds. (Compl. P 110.) Plaintiffs allege > that while MSF and other organizations offered safe and effective treatments > for bacterial meningitis, Pfizer embarked on a medical experiment involving > the \\"new, untested and unproven\\" antibiotic \\"Trovan\\". (Compl. PP 2-3, 6, 8, > 95.) To travel to Kano, Pfizer needed the U.S. Food and Drug > Administration's (FDA) authorization to export Trovan. On 15 March 1996, > Pfizer informed the FDA of its intent to conduct the Kano study. (Compl. P > 108.) Thereafter, Pfizer obtained a 20 March letter from the Nigerian > government and a 28 March letter from IDH's ethics committee permitting > Pfizer to export Trovan to Kano. (Compl. P 108.) Although both letters > predate Pfizer's departure for Kano, plaintiffs allege that no IDH ethics > committee existed as of 28 March 1996 and that the 28 March letter was back- > dated in response to a 1997 FDA audit. (Compl. PP 132-33.) Pfizer,When > confronted with evidence that the 28 March letter was in fact back-dated, > Pfizer issued a public statement that the letter was \\"incorrect\\". Plaintiffs > further contend that Pfizer's sole purpose for traveling to Kano was to > expedite the FDA's approval of Trovan to treat pediatric victims. (Compl. P > 7.)

P 126.) > If a child was not responding well to Trovan, Pfizer switched his or her > treatment to ceftriaxone. (Compl. P 126.) Plaintiffs allege, however, that > Pfizer neglected to analyze the patients' blood samples and therefore could > not determine if a patient had a negative reaction until the manifestation > of a visible and permanent injury. (Compl. P 126.) Plaintiffs further allege > that low-dosing ceftriaxone resulted in injuries and deaths among the > control group. (Compl. P 3.) Although Pfizer's protocol called for its team > to obtain consent from the parents of the children treated who were too > young to sign, few parents could speak or read English. (Compl.

(Compl. PP 3, 117-20, 128-30, 154-55, 157.) After two > weeks, the Pfizer team left Kano and never returned for follow-up > evaluations. (Compl. P 122.) Plaintiffs allege that five children who > received Trovan and six children whom Pfizer \\"low-dosed\\" died. (Compl. P > 120.) Others suffered paralysis, deafness and blindness. (Compl. PP 16-50.) > On 30 December 1996, Pfizer applied for FDA approval to market Trovan in the > United States for various uses including the treatment of pediatric > infectious diseases. (Compl. P 216.)

PP > 221-22.)Abdullahi I, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17436 at *4-7. In response to plaintiffs' allegations, Pfizer filed a motion to dismiss, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,Despite the Court's consistent citation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the District Court ultimately dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Lack of subject matter jurisdiction is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). alleging that the Plaintiffs' fail to plead a violation of the law of nations, because their actions did not fit the narrow exceptions when a private party will be held liable for the \\"law of nations\\". However, the court denied the motion to dismiss on the grounds, because the complaint sufficiently alleged that Pfizer had worked in concert with the Nigeria government, thereby Pfizer acted as a \\"de facto state actor\\". Next, Pfizer sought dismissal on grounds of forum non conveniens. Despite the plaintiff's claims that the Nigerian court system is corrupt and could not provide an adequate alternative forum, the court ultimately found that Nigeria did provide an adequate alternative forum and the \\"Gilbert factors\\" weigh geted in favor of transferring the case to Nigeria. Accordingly, the court granted the defendant's motion to dismiss this action on grounds of forum non conveniens, provided Pfizer consented to suit and acceptance of process in Nigeria; Pfizer waived possible statute of limitation problems; Pfizer made available documents and employees, and; Pfizer agreed to return to the United States if Nigeria declined to accept jurisdiction. Abdullahi v. Pfizer, Inc. II United States Court of Appeals. The Nigerian Plaintiffs appealed from the District Court's order of final judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.Abdullahi v. Pfizer, Inc., 77 Fed. Appx. 48, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 20704 (2d Cir. N.Y., October 8, 2003) (Abdullahi II). Pfizer cross- appealed denial of its motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Court of Appeals reviewed the forum non conveniens dismissal under the \\"clear abuse of discretion\\" standard. The Court of Appeals, however, revisited the Court's analysis of the adequate alternative forum. While under normal circumstances Nigeria appeared to be an adequate forum, in rare cases this may not be enough. \\"If the plaintiff shows that conditions in the foreign forum plainly demonstrate that plaintiffs are highly unlikely to obtain basic justice, a defendant's forum non conveniens motion must be denied\\".Id. at 52. The Court of Appeals noted that plaintiffs had submitted a number of affidavits from State Department and United Nations officials to buttress their claims about corruption in the Nigerian judiciary. Next, the Court of Appeals acknowledged that on appeal both parties had requested judicial notice of facts contained within the record of a parallel proceeding, involving different plaintiffs, in a Nigerian Court. The Court of Appeals referred to the Nigerian litigation as Zango v. Pfizer (Zango litigation). The Zango litigation had recently been dismissed in Nigeria. The court declined to take judicial notice of the \\"Zango litigation\\", instead opting to vacate the district court's dismissal on grounds of forum non conveniens and remanding the case to the district court to consider the implications of the \\"Zango litigation\\" on its forum non conveniens analysis. For these reasons, the Court of Appeals vacated and remanded to the District Court. Abdullahi v. Pfizer, Inc. III After the Court of Appeals vacated and remanded, the District Court readdressed the dual grounds for dismissal, both dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and dismissal pursuant to the doctrine of forum non conveniens. On remand, the District Court granted Pfizer's dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) and found that the Zango litigation did not preclude dismissal for forum non conveniens.Abdullahi v. Pfizer, Inc., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16126 (S.D.N.Y., August 9, 2005) (Abdullahi III). Adequate Alternative Forum Analysis After setting forth the factual and procedural background the District Court turned its attention to the Zango litigation. The court's somewhat searching review of the Zango litigation came in direct response to the Court of Appeals holding, which questioned whether Nigeria was in fact an adequate alternative forum, because the \\"Zango litigation\\" had ended in dismissal. The District Court discussed the \\"Zango litigation\\"'s procedural history, concluding that the Plaintiffs’ filed a Notice of Discontinuance, based upon the Federal High Court, \\"having declined jurisdiction in this matter for personal reasons\\".Id. Next, the court addressed the Plaintiff's allegations of corruption within the Nigerian judiciary. Although Plaintiff's provided allegations of corruption and anecdotal evidence, the court ultimately held that Plaintiffs were unable to establish corruption and bias in the \\"Zango litigation\\". Finding instead, that dismissal was a result of the Plaintiff's waiting \\"endlessly for a new judge to replace Judge Hobon\\", who had recused himself for personal reasons. For these reasons, the District Court, again found that Nigeria provided an adequate alternative forum. Applying Sosa U.S. Supreme Court building In finding that dismissal was also appropriate under for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, which the court mistakenly refers to as Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the court relied heavily upon Sosa.542 U.S. 692, 124 S. Ct. 2739, 159 L. Ed. 2d 718. Under Sosa, the Alien Tort Claims Act creates no new causes of action but confers on federal courts the power to hear a narrow set of alien tort claims for violations of international law. However, the Supreme Court did leave the door open for courts, exercising a vigorous gatekeeping function, to recognized new actionable rules based on evolving principles of international law.Id. at 22-23. However, \\"federal courts should require any claim based on the present-day law of nations to rest on a norm of international character accepted by the civilized world and defined with a specificity comparable to the features of the 18th-century paradigms\\".Abdullahi v. Pfizer, Inc., 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16126, at *23 (S.D.N.Y., August 9, 2003) (Abdullahi III) (citing Sosa, 124 S. Ct. at ). Having set forth the relevant standard, the court evaluated whether Pfizer did in fact violate customary international law. First, the District Court found that the Nuremberg Code, which governs scientific research on human subjects, does not contain a private cause of action. Second, the District Court found that the Declaration of Helsinki and the CIOMS guidelines does not contain a private cause of action. Instead, finding these guidelines are merely a \\"general statement of policy that is unlikely to give rise to obligations in any strict sense\\". [Id. at 34.] Third, the District Court found that the ICCPR was not \\"self executing\\" and that a private right of action should not be implied. Finally, the District Court found that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights does not impose obligations as a matter of international law. Instead, it is \\"merely aspirational\\". None of the sources of international law cited by the Plaintiffs were a proper predicate for jurisdiction under the Alien Tort Claims Act. For the reasons discussed, the court granted Pfizer's motion to dismiss, for failure to state a claim under the Alien Tort Claims Act and, even if subject matter jurisdiction were found, the action would be dismissed on forum non conveniens grounds (under the same conditions set forth in Abdullahi I). Ajudu Ismaila Adamu v. Pfizer, Inc. The District Court recites the facts set forth in Abdullahi I, and the analysis of the Alien Tort Claims Act set forth in Abdullahi III, before turning to the claims under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act and the Connecticut Products Liability Statute. The court began by analyzing Connecticut's choice of law principles. Under Connecticut's qualified lex loci delicti doctrine, the District Court concluded that Nigerian -- not Connecticut -- substantive law governs, and accordingly, both Connecticut law claims were dismissed.Ajudu Ismaila Adamu v. Pfizer, Inc., 399 F. Supp. 2d 495, 503 (N.Y.S.D. 2005). In addition to lack of subject matter jurisdiction, under both the Alien Tort Claims Act and the Connecticut statutory causes of action, the court also granted the motion to dismiss on grounds of forum non conveniens, with the same additional conditions required by Abdullahi I and Abdullahi III. Nigerian government lawsuit On 5 June 2007, the government of Nigeria filed against Pfizer in the Nigerian Federal High Court, seeking US$6.95 billion in damages. Nigeria claimed that Pfizer \\"never obtained approval of the relevant regulatory agencies... nor did the defendant seek or receive approval to conduct any clinical trial at any time before their illegal conduct\\". After preliminary arguments, the case was adjourned until 26 June of that year.\\"Nigeria files suit against Pfizer, seeks $6.95 bln\\", Reuters, 4 June 2007 2009 settlement In February 2009, Pfizer decided to settle its legal case with the 200 plaintiffs. An out-of-court settlement was reached and will be put in writing at a meeting scheduled to take place in Rome, Italy in March 2009. The settlement followed months of negotiations between Pfizer and the Kano state government which represented the plaintiffs. According to Wikileaked US embassy cables, Pfizer's country manager admitted that \\"Pfizer had hired investigators to uncover corruption links to federal attorney general Michael Aondoakaa to expose him and put pressure on him to drop the federal cases\\". The talks were brokered by the former Nigerian military leader Yakubu Gowon and the former U.S. President Jimmy Carter. The lawyer representing the Nigerian government was Babatunde Irukera. In October 2009, it was announced that the medical records of the victims of the 1996 Pfizer Trovan clinical trial could not be found at the Kano State Ministry of Health nor at the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) where the trials were conducted according to the state's Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice Barrister Aliyu Umar. The announcement was made shortly after Umar confirmed that the state government had received $10 million from Pfizer as part of the $75 million settlement of the protracted dispute. Additionally, the Nigerian government conducted their own investigation. This report was kept secret for five years with the only three printed copies being lost and disappearing.

Final SaveEasy Logo before conversion to Independent Banner Save Easy Logo 80-90s, saveeasy SaveEasy (formerly Atlantic Save-Easy) was a chain of small retail grocery store franchises in the Atlantic Provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island, owned by Loblaw Companies The chain was owned by Atlantic Wholesalers Ltd. of Sackville, New Brunswick, and the first SaveEasy opened in 1959, followed by rapid expansion to quickly become the region's second-largest grocery banner, behind Sobeys. Loblaws entered the Maritime provinces in 1976 when they purchased Atlantic Wholesalers. During a period of restructuring SaveEasy stores introduced Loblaw house brands such as No Name during the recession of the early 1980s, and SaveEasy's logo was updated to match the Loblaws logo. In some instances, certain SaveEasy stores were converted from franchise-owned to corporate-owned stores, and their name was changed to the \\"No Frills\\" brand during this time. There were also some larger SaveEasy stores that carried the name SaveEasy Warehouse Foods, that were typically found in shopping malls, while most SaveEasy stores were stand- alone locations. Most SaveEasy stores in urban areas were closed or converted to the larger Atlantic SuperValu or the mega-size Atlantic Superstore concepts, and the remaining Atlantic SaveEasy stores were redesigned. The SaveEasy name, with a few exceptions, is now usually found in small towns and rural areas while the Atlantic SuperValu brand has largely disappeared as the company standardized its brands. While still considered a separate chain, in 2008, SaveEasy adopted branding very similar to that of Quebec's Provigo, also owned by Loblaw. The \\"P\\" in the Provigo logo is changed to an \\"S\\", and the SaveEasy slogan \\"So quick, so good!\\", is a translation of Provigo's \\"Si vite, si bon!\\" On November 4, 2014, Loblaws announced that the SaveEasy brand would be phased out in favor of its Your Independent Grocer brand in use in the rest of Canada.

Some sources describe the school as \\"in Austin\\". The school was operated by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago and served as the parish school of the Our Lady of the Angels Church. The school is best known for the fatal Our Lady of the Angels School fire, which occurred on December 1, 1958. The fire killed 92 students and 3 nuns and led to fire safety consciousness in private and public schools in the United States. The first school building: history prior to the 1958 fire Our Lady of the Angels was an elementary and middle school comprising kindergarten through eight grades. It was located at 909 North Avers Avenue in the Humboldt Park area on the West Side of Chicago, at the intersection of West Iowa Street. The school was located in a mostly Italian-American middle class community; the community held several second and third generation immigrant groups, including Italian Americans, Polish Americans, Irish Americans, and German Americans. Most members of the community were Roman Catholics. The area was originally mostly Irish, but slowly became mostly Italian by 1958. The facility was part of a large Roman Catholic parish which also consisted of a church, rectory, convent of the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and two other parish halls. The school was the educational home to approximately 1,600 students. In 1903, a two-story parish school was built, with four classrooms on the first floor and a chapel and convent on the second. The school opened in September 1904, and in 1905, the second-floor chapel and convent was converted into two classrooms for the seventh and eighth grades. In 1910, a second two-story building was built north of the original structure, at 909 North Avers Avenue; this brick and timber-joist structure with a wooden interior was in the \\"Old English\\" architectural style, with a basement a half-story above the street, a church on the first floor and 12 classrooms on the first and second floors. From 1939, a large new church seating more than 1100 parishioners was built together with a three-story brick rectory. When the new buildings were completed in April 1941, the church on the first floor of the 1910 building was converted into classrooms and a new chapel was built in its basement. In 1953, a two-story annex was built, connecting the 1910 building, which became the north wing of the school, with the older 1903 building, which became the south wing. Our Lady of the Angels School fire A fire in the north wing of the school occurred on December 1, 1958. It killed 92 students and 3 nuns and injured numerous others. The entire building was demolished in 1959, and a new school opened on the same site in 1960. The new school building A new Our Lady of the Angels School, with an address of 3814 West Iowa Street, which was located on the south side of the building and used in order to distance the school from the fire, was constructed with the latest required fire safety standards, such as a sprinkler system. Prior to the rebuilding, Our Lady of the Angels students attended various \\"replacement\\" schools to finish the school year while the new Our Lady of the Angels School was under construction. Catholic schools that took some Our Lady of the Angels students include: * Our Lady Help of Christians School (Since closed) * Our Lady of Grace School * St. Peter Canisius School (Since closed) Chicago Public Schools campuses that took some Our Lady of the Angels students include: * Cameron School (Cameron has similar construction to the former Our Lady of Angels School) * John Hay Elementary School * Rezin Orr School (now Brian Piccolo Specialty School) The modern three-story building with 32 classrooms plus a kindergarten opened in September, 1960. Donations from around the world helped to fund the new construction. Demographic changes Demographic changes in the population of the city’s west side began to reduce the number of students in the school during the 1970s. The cohesiveness of the parish weakened and many Catholic residents began to move to the northwest side of Chicago or to the western suburbs. In 1989, the St. Francis of Assisi School merged into Our Lady of the Angels. In 1990 the Our Lady of the Angels church merged into the St. Francis of Assisi Church (at 932 North Kostner). The Our Lady of the Angels parish buildings closed as the parish staff moved to the Francis of Assisi Church location. School closure As a result of declining numbers of students, the Archdiocese of Chicago closed Our Lady of the Angels School, which held the address of 3814 West Iowa Street, once the Class of 1999 graduated. The final graduating class dedicated a historic marker and fire memorial within the school. Due to the conflict between church and state property, this religious statue and pedestal have since been removed to the Holy Family Church. At first the Nuestra America Charter High School opened in the former Our Lady of the Angels building. Nuestra America closed in 2002. The building was subsequently leased to Galapagos Charter School until it also closed in June 2016, citing financial pressures.

Cox's house George Barnsedale Cox (1853–1916) was a political boss in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States, a member of the Republican Party, and associate of William Howard Taft. Early life Cox was the son of British immigrants. As a teen during the Civil War years, he supported his widowed mother as an errand boy. Later he drove a delivery wagon. Finally, he assisted his brother-in-law by operating the keno portion of the latter's casino. In these days he was already noted for being a physically strong and closed-mouthed man. As a young man, Cox acquired a saloon at the corner of Longworth and John, \\"Dead man's corner\\". Political career Cox was elected to the city council in 1879, serving two terms. He served most notably on the Decennial Equalization Board where he was able to fix the tax rate for prominent properties like the Shubert Theater, in which he became an investor. He also served significantly on the Board of Public Affairs in this turbulent era of the notorious Courthouse Riots. Known as a ward boss who delivered his delegation as promised, he became the executive chairman of the local chapter of the Republican Party. He ran unsuccessfully for Hamilton County Clerk in 1884 and 1888, being the only candidate on his party's ticket to lose in the latter year. He managed James G. Blaine’s 1884 presidential campaign in Hamilton County. He set up the Young Men’s Blaine Club, which became his main base of political operations. Cox took pride in running an orderly organization. He maintained decorum in city conventions, eliminated multiple voting, and accepted the nomination and election of reform business candidates for mayor, who usually won election. Cox’s coalition was “able to bring positive government to Cincinnati and to mitigate the chaos which accompanied the emergence of the new city.”Miller, Boss Cox’s Cincinnati: Urban Politics in the Progressive Era p. 239. With some justification, Cox boasted of his “achievement of taking the schools, Police, and Fire Departments out of politics” and insisted that “a boss is not necessarily a public enemy.” Cox quoted in Cincinnati Enquirer, 15 May 1911 as reported in Judith Spraul- Schmidt, American National Biography (2000). On the other hand Lincoln Steffens, a famous muckraker, in 1905 called Cincinnati one of the two worst- governed cities in the countrySteffens, Lincoln. “Ohio: A Tale of Two Cities,” McClure’s Magazine, June 1905, pp. 293–311. During his heyday, his chief lieutenants were Deputy County Treasurer Rud K. Hynicka and the President of the Board of the New Water works Commissioners, August Herrmann. Herrmann became President of the Cincinnati Reds from 1902 to 1927 and is known as the Father of the World Series. He influenced many local elections, including the nomination Julius Fleischmann, who became the youngest mayor of Cincinnati. George Cox died after suffering a stroke in 1916. Legacy The George B. Cox House at the corner of Brookline and Ludlow avenues was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 6, 1973. The Cox House has been converted into a branch of the Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County. , Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County, 2015. Accessed 2015-10-15.

Biography Born in Dublin, Ireland. Educated in England at Marlborough College (where he held a Classical Scholarship for 5 years) and at Trinity College, Cambridge University (admitted 7 October 1892.) After leaving Cambridge University he entered the British Army. After 7 years’ service (including service in India and South Africa), he left the Army with the rank of Captain and took a position in the British House of Commons. He left this position to join the staff of The Times newspaper. He gave up newspaper work to accept an invitation from Lord Cromer to act as his Chief of Staff in a National campaign of which Lord Cromer was the Leader. When this campaign was over he accepted an offer from Lord Roberts to act in a similar capacity to him in his famous National Service Campaign.National Army Museum, Department of Archives Photographs Film and Sound: Robert Papers On the outbreak of World War I, he rejoined his regiment, the Rifle Brigade, and was appointed to the Headquarters Staff in the War Office in London. In April 1915 Lord Kitchener sent him forth as his Personal Representative, with a free hand and full responsibility, to force an Emergency Pace and Streamlined Methods in the Production of Munitions. In the course of this mission—which was successfully fulfilled within 3 months—he came into personal contact with King George V, Mr. Henry Asquith (the Prime Minister), and other Leading Men of the day. Thus he had the experience of serving in succession under Lords Cromer, Roberts, and Kitchener—the three Big Men of Action of that generation—with a free hand and full responsibility to carry out their Policies. He moved to America in 1923. Prior to publication of his revised version of his book entitled Getting Things Done, he made an extensive study of American methods of Organization. He served as a Special Consultant in a Government Department in Washington for 14 months. Before going to Washington he worked as a member of a Trade Union in a Defense Plant—12 hours a night, 6 nights a week. In 1925, Creed was interviewed by The Christian Science Monitor.

He left Marlborough in July 1892 and went on to study at Trinity College, Cambridge. He joined the Army in 1897 (The Rifle Brigade) and retired from the Army in 1904. During World War I he rejoined the Army in 1915 with the rank of Captain and retired from the Army again in 1920. The only other details about him which have come to hand concern his cricketing ability. At the end of his final term here (27 July 1892) he played cricket for Marlborough College in the annual two-day match at Lords Cricket Ground in London against Rugby School.

Noted for their lightning strike raids on Union targets and their ability to consistently elude pursuit, the Rangers disrupted Union communications and supply lines. The 43rd Battalion was formed on June 10, 1863 at Rector's Cross Roads, near Rectortown, Virginia, when John S. Mosby formed Company A of the battalion. He was acting under the authority of General Robert E. Lee, who had granted him permission to raise a company in January 1863 under the Partisan Ranger Act of 1862 in which the Confederate Congress authorized the formation of such units. By the summer of 1864, Mosby's battalion had grown to six cavalry companies and one artillery company, comprising about 400 men. After February 1864, the Confederate Congress revoked the authority of all partisan units, except for two, one of which was the 43rd Battalion, the other being McNeill's Rangers. The battalion never formally surrendered, but was disbanded on April 21, 1865, after Lee surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox Court House to Ulysses S. Grant but not before it had attempted to negotiate surrender with Major General Winfield S. Hancock in Millwood, Virginia. Etymology Col. John S. Mosby, wood engraving 1867Engraving reproduced from frontispiece, Major John Scott, Partisan Life with Col. John S. Mosby, 1867) What to call the Confederate 43rd Battalion was a matter of contention during the war. The members of the battalion were referred to as soldiers, partisans, rangers, and guerillas. The Union viewed them as unsoldierly: a loose band of roving thieves. Northern newspapers and Unionists referred to them as guerrillas, a term of opprobrium at the time. One of Mosby's men, Munson stated in memoirs published after the war that \\"the term [guerrilla] was not applied to us in the South in any general way until after the war, when we had made the name glorious, and in time we became as indifferent to it as the whole South to the word Rebel.\\"Munson, Reminiscences of a Mosby Guerilla p. 19 (discussing the name of the command) Mosby himself avoided overtly militaristic words like \\"troops\\" or \\"soldiers\\" or \\"battalion\\" in favor of the more familial \\"Mosby's Men\\" or \\"Mosby's command\\".Munson, Reminiscences of a Mosby Guerilla p. 19 (Mosby's name for thaem) History=Unit organization and muster * Company A - Organized June 10, 1863, at Rector's Cross Roads, Rectortown, Virginia * Company B - Organized October 1, 1863, at Scuffleburg, Virginia, just south of Paris * Company C - Organized December 7, 1863, at Rectortown, Virginia * Company D - Organized March 28, 1864, at Paris, Virginia * Artillery Company - Organized July 4, 1864, at Paris, Virginia * Company E - Organized July 18, 1864, at Upperville, Virginia * Company F - Organized September 13, 1864, at Piedmont Station near Delaplane, Virginia * Company G - A reorganization of the Artillery Company, November 28, 1864, at Salem in Fauquier County, Virginia * Company H - Organized April 5, 1865, in Loudoun County, Virginia Operating area, purpose, and recruiting Map depicting Mosby's Confederacy and nearby areas printed in 1867, showing contemporary place namesreproduced from Major John Scott, Partisan Life with Col. John S. Mosby, 1867) The method of operation involved executing small raids with up to 150 men (but usually 20 to 80) behind Union lines by entering the objective area undetected, quickly executing their mission, and then rapidly withdrawing, dispersing the troops among local Southern sympathizers, and melting into the countryside. Mosby's area of operations was Northern Virginia from the Shenandoah Valley to the west, along the Potomac River to Alexandria to the east, bounded on the south by the Rappahannock River, with most of his operations centered in or near Fauquier and Loudoun counties, in an area known as \\"Mosby's Confederacy\\".43rd Battalion Virginia Cavalry Mosby's Command p. 12.(describing Mosby's confederacy) Mosby's command operated mainly within the distance a horse could travel in a day's hard riding, approximately in any direction from Middleburg, Virginia. They also performed raids in Maryland. Of his purpose in raiding behind the Union lines, Mosby said: Mosby felt that \\"a small force moving with celerity and threatening many points on a line can neutralize a hundred times its own number. The line must be stronger at every point than the attacking force, else it is broken.\\"43rd Battalion Virginia Cavalry p. 11 (quoting Mosby on the purpose of guerrilla tactics) Sergeant William T. Biedler, 16 years old, of Company C, Mosby's Virginia Cavalry Regiment with flintlock musket. From the Library of Congress Prints and Photographs DivisionAccording to the memoirs of former partisan Munson, Mosby welcomed volunteers attracted by the glory of the fight and the allure of booty, and had an eye for intelligence, valor, resourcefulness, but \\"what Mosby liked best was youth. He agreed with Napoleon, that boys make the best soldiers . . . mere boys, unmarried and hence without fear or anxiety for wives or children.\\"43rd Battalion Virginia Cavalry p. 17 (on recruits) A few partisans were wizened old men in their 40s, but most were in their late teens or early 20s; two paroled after the war at Winchester were only 14 years old. An adolescent boy released from school for the day in Upperville just as Mosby's men were chasing Union troopers out of town \\"became so excited that he mounted a pony and joined in the chase with no weapon except his textbook. This would be the last day of study for Henry Cable Maddux . . . but the first of many raids with Mosby's men.\\"43rd Battalion Virginia Cavalry p. 11 (on the Upperville raid)Private Lucien Love of Co.

Scott refers to \\"Captain Mountjoy\\", but most references spell it \\"Montjoy\\". The 43rd Battalion were partisans who melted into the civilian population when not on a raid, and at one point General Grant ordered several captured partisans hanged for being out of uniform. Nonetheless when raiding they did wear Confederate gray at least in some fashion. Munson said in his memoirs: > \\"Something gray\\" was the one requisite of our dress and the cost of it > mattered little. Much of it was paid for by Uncle Sam out of the money we > got from him directly and indirectly. . . . It has been said that we wore > blue to deceive the enemy, but this is ridiculous, for we were always in the > enemy's country where a Southern soldier caught dressed in a blue uniform > would have been treated to a swift court-martial and shot as a spy. I never > knew, nor did I ever hear, of any man in our Command wearing a blue uniform > under any circumstances . . . We had no reason to use a blue uniform as a > disguise, for there was no occasion to do so. Many of our attacks were made > at night, when all colors looked alike, and in daytime we did not have to > deceive the Yankees in order to get at them.Munson, A Mosby Guerilla p. 25 & > 178-184 (on uniforms--though Munson himself did wear a disguise when he > escaped from a Washington DC prison dressed in an improvised surgeon's > assistant uniform) Munson's denial of the use of Union blue is contradicted by another source however. The diary of Union mapmaker Private Robert Knox Sneden, who Mosby captured near Brandy Station, Virginia at 3:00am November 27, 1863, records that Mosby's raiders were disguised in Union Blue overcoats, and so was Mosby himself. While interrogating Sneden, Mosby \\"opened his blue cavalry overcoat, showing a Rebel uniform underneath.\\" Later in Sneden's diary, this description: \\"Mosby was an undersized, thin visaged looking fellow, with a sickly looking yellow mustache. He wore a United States officer's blue overcoat over a uniform of grey, had on fine silk stitched top boots . . . .\\" Mosby's men each carried two .44 Colt army revolvers worn in belt holsters, and some carried an extra pair stuck in their boot tops.Munson, A Mosby Guerilla p. 23 (on pistols) Mosby and his men had a \\"poor opinion\\" of cavalry sabres, and did not use them. Munson \\"never actually saw blood drawn with a sabre but twice in our war, though I saw them flash by the thousand at Brandy Station.\\"Munson, A Mosby Guerilla p. 23-24 (on sabres vs. pistols) Union cavalry initially armed with the traditional sabre fought at a considerable disadvantage: > The Federal cavalry generally fought with sabres; at any rate they carried > them, and Mosby used to say they were as useless against a skillfully > handled revolver as the wooden swords of harlequins. As the Mosby tactics > became better known, scouting parties from the Northern army began to > develop an affection for the pistol, with increasing success I might add. In > stubborn fights I have seen the men on both sides sit on their restless > horses and re-load their pistols under a galling fire. This was not a > custom, however; someone generally ran to cover after the revolvers were > emptied. We both did this a good many times but, I believe, without bragging > at the expense of truth, that we saw the back seams of the enemy's jackets > oftener than they saw ours. . . Revolvers in the hands of Mosby's men were > as effective in surprise engagements as a whole line of light ordnance in > the hands of the enemy. This was largely because Mosby admonished his men > never to fire a shot until the eyes of the other fellow were visible. It was > no uncommon thing for one of our men to gallop by a tree at full tilt, and > put three bullets in its trunk in succession. This sort of shooting left the > enemy with a good many empty saddles after an engagement.Munson, A Mosby > Guerilla p. 24-25 (on weapons) Lt. Col. William Chapman, who with six shots emptied five Yankee saddles, wood engraving 1867Engraving reproduced from Major John Scott, Partisan Life with Col. John S. Mosby, 1867)For instance, describing the fight at Miskel's barn, Munson says of William H. Chapman (later lieutenant colonel of Mosby's command) wheeling his horse in a thicket of Yankees \\"[t]he pistols were not a foot apart. The Yankee's pistol snapped [misfired] but Chapman's did its deadly work. He fired six shots and emptied five saddles.\\"Munson, A Mosby Guerilla p. 24-25 (on Chapman's marksmanship) A few guerrillas equipped themselves with carbines captured from the Union, but \\"they were unhandy things to carry\\" and unsuited for fighting on horseback; indeed in the thick of a February 1865 fight the carbines' long barrels made them too unwieldy to fire, and they were used instead as clubs.43rd Battalion Virginia Cavalry p. 15 (on ineffectiveness of carbines). Mosby tried out some small field artillery pieces, including a brass Napoleon,Scott, Partisan Life with Mosby p. 239 (discussing use of the brass Napoleon for covering fire during a raid at Point of Rocks) but artillery proved to be too cumbersome for his fast hit- and-run tactics and not especially helpful in action. Ultimately Union troops found the mountainside hiding places of the cannons and made off with them. \\"The rangers had some of the best horses in a region known for raising great horses.\\"43rd Battalion Virginia Cavalry p. 16 (on their mounts) All men had at least two; Mosby himself as many as six, since a few miles at a flat-out run would exhaust even the best horse—and Mosby's men were constantly either running toward or away from the federals. The men were devoted to their horses. During the Mount Zion Church fight on July 6, 1864, guerrilla John Alexander \\"noticed in one of the charges that his mount was unaccountable dull, and in spite of the most vigorous spurring ... fell into the wake of the pursuit.\\" After the action he rode his horse some distance toward Fairfax, slid exhausted out of the saddle and fell asleep in a field, and on the following morning: > . . . awoke [and] saw my horse standing at my feet with his head bending > over me. His breast and forelegs were covered with clotted blood which had > flowed from an ugly bullet wound. How long he had stood there in mute appeal > for sympathy and relief, I do not know--perhaps all night. But as I recalled > how cruelly I had spurred him to the chase the evening before, how without a > groan of protest he responded the best he could, and how patiently he had > stood with me, all unconscious of his suffering, on that lonely, miserable > watch, I was not ashamed to throw my arms around his neck and weep out of my > grief and contrition. . . . That was [our] final ride together.43rd > Battalion Virginia Cavalry p. 17 (on Alexander's wounded horse) Speed, surprise and shock were the true secret of the success of Mosby's command. A small, intrepid mounted force could charge a much larger one, and with the terrorizing advantage of surprise, rout them. If attacked themselves, the guerrillas would sometimes ride away a brief distance and then round on their attackers and charge back into them, panicking and scattering them in the melee. Or they would simply \\"skedaddle\\", that is scatter to the four winds, and individually make their way back to the farms in Loudoun and Fauquier counties where they were welcomed, hidden, and succoured. Mosby would then send word telling chosen men when and where to assemble for the next raid.43rd Battalion Virginia Cavalry p. 21 (on communication by messengers: \\"[a]fter the courier arrived at the first house, those boarding there would scatter to two or three other houses, and so on.\\"). 43rd Battalion unit history1863= * The Chantilly Raids - January 5–6, 1863 * The Chantilly Church Raid - January 26, 1863 * The Herndon Raid - February 2, 1863 * The Thompson's Corner Raid - February 26, 1863 * The Fight at Aldie - March 2, 1863 * The Fairfax Court House Raid - March 8–9, 1863 * The Miskell's Farm Fight - April 1, 1863 * The Warrenton Junction Raid - May 3, 1863 * The First Catlett Station Raid - May 19, 1863 * The Second Catlett Station Raid - May 30, 1863 * The Raid on Seneca Mills - June 11, 1863 * The First Calico Raid - June 19, 1863 * The Raid on Mercersburg - June 28, 1863 * The Fight at Gooding's Tavern - August 24, 1863 * The Cavalry Camp Raids - September/October, 1863 * The Wagon Raids - October/November, 1863 =1864= *The Battle of Loudoun Heights - January 1864 *The B&O; Raid on Duffield Station - January, 1864 *The Fight at Blackleys Grove - February 20, 1864 *The Battle of 2nd Dranesville - February 21, 1864 *The Second Calico Raid - July 3, 1864 *The Action at Mount Zion Church - July 6, 1864 *The Berryville Wagon Raid - August 13, 1864 *The Raid on Merritt's Cavalry Division - September, 1864 *The Manassas Gap Railroad Raid - Oct 3–7, 1864 *The Greenback Raid - October 14, 1864 *The Valley Pike Raid - October 25, 1864 *The Rout of Blazer's Command - November 17, 1864 The total tally for the 43rd Battalion by October 1864 was 1,600 horses and mules, 230 beef cattle, 85 wagons and ambulances, and 1,200 captured, killed or wounded, including Union Brig.

Lee surrendered the 43rd Battalion's parent command, the Army of Northern Virginia. Immediately Colonel Mosby attempted negotiations with the Union commander in Winchester, Virginia, to arrange for the surrender of the 43rd Battalion, but could not come to terms. Instead of surrendering, Mosby's command simply disbanded. On April 21, twelve days after Lee's surrender, Mosby gathered his battalion at Salem in Fauquier County, Virginia, and read this farewell address to his men: Reputation Virginian newspapers were eager to carry articles about Mosby's Rangers. When other correspondents were captured in the Rangers' raids, they were treated well and given liquor and cigars. Mosby often played up his exploits to gain attention in the press for his unit and to emphasize the fact that the 43rd Battalion was a legitimate military command within the command structure of the Confederate States of America's army. Legacy=The military effectiveness of Mosby's command Mosby partisan Lewis Powell modeling for photographer Alexander Gardner the hat and overcoat he wore when he attacked William Seward April 1865.It is difficult to evaluate the contribution of Mosby's raids to the overall Confederate war effort. In his memoirs, John Munson stated that if the objective was simply \\"to annoy the enemy,\\" they succeeded.Munson, Reminiscences of a Mosby Guerilla, p. 220 (saying annoyance and distraction, \\"that official nerves should be somewhat unstrung\\" was the objective) In discussing as Mosby's \\"greatest piece of annoyance\\", the Greenback Raid in which Mosby's men derailed a train and captured a $170,000 payroll from the paymasters of Philip Sheridan's army (each of the 80 raiders received a $2100 share, though Mosby himself took nothing), Munson says that due to Mosby's comparatively tiny force > ... [i]t was necessary for the Federal troops to guard every wagon train, > railroad bridge and camp with enough active and efficient men to prevent > Mosby from using his three hundred raiders in one of his destructive rushes > at any hour of the day or night. . . General Grant at one point reported > that seventeen thousand of his men were engaged in keeping Mosby from > attacking his weak points, and thus away from active service on the firing > line. Finally it was not safe to send despatches by a courier unless a > regiment was sent along to guard him.Munson, Reminiscences of a Mosby > Guerilla, p. 228(discussing effectiveness of raids). On the other hand, Mosby's guerrilla operations were not highly regarded even within the Confederate Army. Brigadier General Thomas Rosser (with the support of Generals Jubal Early and Fitz Lee) urged disbanding Mosby's command in a letter addressed to General Robert E. Lee. Rosser agreed with the Union that Mosby's men were not soldiers but glorified thieves -- and bad for morale, because his regular troops were jealous: > [Mosby's men] are a nuisance and an evil to the service.

It was later released in Japan under the title Cu-On-Pa, appearing on the consoles Super Famicom and PlayStation. A Nintendo 64 version was announced (again under the title Cu-On-Pa) but never released. The game uses new age messages throughout its soundtrack. Gameplay The player controls a small cube, referred to as a light body, by using the keyboard or mouse. The light body rolls along a grid (the unified field) collecting life force tiles (coloured tiles with a texture matching that of the cube) by rolling the cube over them such that the top face of the cube matches the colour of the tile. Coloured tiles of varying types appear randomly on the playing surface, but can be eliminated in the same manner as life force tiles. Games are divided into multiple levels, each of which has a set time limit and a life force target. If a player collects the target amount of life force play proceeds to the next level. If the timer expires or the light body is unable to move (all adjacent grid spaces are blocked by coloured tiles) then the game is over. There are three different modes of play in Endorfun, each with different goals: #Longevity: play for the longest possible time #Abundance: pass through a set number of levels before time runs out #Quickening: as Abundance, but levels become progressively faster and more difficult Soundtrack Endorfun's soundtrack is composed of a large number of short, looped song segments. Each segment is approximately 5 seconds long, with different segments strung together to provide longer, varied soundtracks for each level. Each level's soundtrack contains messages oriented towards peace, well-being, love, and happiness.  Subliminal messages  Endorfun featured phrases described by the press at the time as subliminal messages, which were audibly spoken trough speakers or headphones to the player during gameplay. These messages, dubbed \\"positive affirmations\\" by the game's publisher, took the form of phrases intended to convey positive feelings and moods such as body positivity and optimism - such as \\"I am joyful\\", \\"I am powerful\\" and \\"I am at peace\\". They became immediately controversial due to their very nature and were criticised by the press and a professor at the University of Michigan, who raised concerns that these messages, though ostensibly positive, could have certain unintended consequences. Although controversial, these messages were not illegal as no law prohibiting such phrases in video games exists in the United States. Furthermore, Time Warner stated that all of the messages included in the game were only intended \\"to uplift the heart and mind of its users\\" and that an exhaustive list of all such phrases was printed on the game's retail box, so that consumers buying knew exactly what they could be exposed to. The 'subliminal' phrases were also optional and could be disabled by the player trough the game's sound menu, though doing so would disable music (but not other sounds) as well. Instructions for doing so were included in the game's main help file. Reception Reviewing the Macintosh version, a Next Generation critic lauded the gameplay, saying it \\"soon becomes a Zen sort of experience in the same way that Tetris sometimes does\\". He added that the \\"abstract symphony of mesmerising graphics, colorful motion, and swelling, jazzy background tunes soon puts the player in that autopilot gaming state where complex movement sequences and on-the-fly strategies becomes second nature and all is forgotten but the rhythm.\\" Despite this, he gave it only three out of five stars. Computer Game Review praised Endorfun for \\"addictive game play, cool visual effects and some good music.\\" Game review site GameSpot described it as a \\"challenging, if repetitive game\\", though adding that the game's graphics and subliminal messages made it into a \\"far more interesting fare\\", summing it up as a \\"challenging, unique puzzle game that is pleasant to look at and listen to\\". The author opined that the phrases included within the game ranged from ones he found \\"harmonious\\" (such as \\"I love the world and the world loves me\\") to ones he found \\"scary\\" (such as \\"It's OK for me to have everything I want\\").

The integrin α chain is noncovalently bound to the integrin β chain. It binds to iC3b and can be involved in cellular adhesion, binding to the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). CR3 causes phagocytosis and destruction of cells opsonized with iC3b. CR3 and CR4 are thought to exhibit overlapping functions; however, the distinct binding sites to iC3b suggests differences in their functions. Additionally, CR3 has been shown to have therapeutic promise. Function Macrophage-1 antigen (hereafter complement receptor 3 or CR3) (CD11b/CD18) is a human cell surface receptor found on B and T lymphocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes (mostly neutrophils), NK cells, and mononuclear phagocytes like macrophages. CR3 is a pattern recognition receptor, capable of recognizing and binding to many molecules found on the surfaces of invading bacteria. CR3 also recognizes iC3b when bound to the surface of foreign cells. iC3b is generated by proteolysis of C3b and binding to the receptor causes phagocytosis and destruction of the foreign cell opsonized with iC3b. CR3 belongs to a family of cell surface receptors known as integrins (because they share this particular β chain, they are referred to as β2-integrins), which are extremely widely distributed throughout nature and which generally are important in cellular adhesion, migration, phagocytosis and other cell-cell interactions in a variety of cells and circumstances. Upregulation of Mac-1 in the presence of certain factors such as IL-2 may cause a prolongation of the life of the immune cell while the presence of TNF-α induces apoptosis and selective removal of the cell. A fully activated neutrophil may express on its membrane 200,000 or more CR3 molecules. Absence of CR3 results in reduced binding and ingestion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in mice. In human mononuclear phagocytes, phagocytosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is mediated in part by human monocyte complement receptors including CR3. CR3 has also been shown to mediate phagocytosis of the Lyme disease causing bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, in the absence of iC3b opsonization.  CR3 and CR4  CR3 and CR4, both members of the β2-integrin family, are generally thought to exhibit overlapping functions in myeloid cells and certain lymphoid populations. CR3 and CR4 have been shown to be 87% homologous via sequence analysis of human cDNA of the α chains; however, the complement receptors bind at distinct sites of iC3b and the intracellular domains differ in length and amino acid sequence, suggesting further differences in their functions. Further, CR3 favors binding to positively charged species, while CR4 binds negatively charged species. It has been shown that both CR3 and CR4 are found in mice and humans. Together, CR3 and CR4 are involved in various functions of the T and B lymphocytes and NK cells. For instance, while both CR3 and CR4 are involved in adhesion, migration and proliferation of B cells, they are involved in enhancing complement-dependent cytotoxicity in NK cells.  CR3 and CR4 for Disease Therapy  Immunomodulatory therapies often aim for an induced reduction of symptoms in inflammatory disease or supported elimination of malignancies. In vitro and in vivo experiments suggest a response of CR3 and CR4 to enable complement-dependent cell cytotoxicity towards antibody-coated cancer cells. Such biological therapeutic targeting is characterized by lowering autoimmune inflammation or enhancing anti-cancer vaccination effects. Leukadherin-1, a CR3 agonist molecule, has been shown to suppress human innate inflammatory signals. Its anti-inflammatory effect mediation further provides support for its therapeutic promise in animal models of vascular injury.

Education and career Omi holds a Ph.D. in Sociology from the University of California, Santa Cruz. Racial formation in the United States Omi's most influential work has been his 1986 collaboration with UC Santa Barbara Professor Howard Winant, Racial Formation in the United States. The theory draws upon Gramsci's conception of hegemony to describe the social construction of the race concept in contemporary US society. Omi and Winant argue that race emerged as an organizing factor in society due to political actions they call racial projects. These racial projects remain ongoing making race an unstable social category which is constantly changing as evidenced by the changing nature of race relations and as the result of political actions such as the Civil Rights Movement. Still, as Gramsci would predict, the reforms secured during crisis moments like the Civil Rights era serve merely to incorporate resistance. The political project of racial equality remains incomplete. Thus, the fundamental dynamics of race including institutional racism and continued inequality along racialized lines remain in place today, according to Omi and Winant. Racial formation has solidified as one of the primary paradigms of sociological understandings of race. Omi and Winant identify reductionist theories of race that identify race as epiphenomenal rather than durable as the chief competing theories of racial dynamics in contemporary sociology.

It increases a vehicle commander's situational awareness of the battlefield by gathering information near real- time based on vehicle locations being updated on the battlefield. This information is viewed graphically, and exchanged via both free and fixed text message formats (instead of verbal collection of reports). The location data for friendly forces is collected through the Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS) line of sight tactical radio network and Blue Force Tracking (BFT) satellite network. Development The development of the system is managed by Project Manager, Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below, a component of the U.S. Army's Program Executive Office – Command Control and Communications Tactical (PEO C3T). PEO C3T is based at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Aberdeen, Maryland. The original Army Program Executive Officer was William Campbell (LtG, ret). The original contractor program manager was Neil Siegel. FBCB2 was tested under the First Digitized Division 4th Infantry Division (United States) based in Fort Hood, Texas, and 1/25 infantry out of Fort Lewis, Washington. series of what were called \\"Advanced Warfighting Experiments\\" at the National Training Center near Barstow, California, starting in 1997. The division conducted Limited User Test on the equipment in 1998, and the system was approved for production. FBCB2 was then tested and implemented under the Force XXI concept that stemmed from Operation Desert Storm/Shield. The United States Army and the United States Marines Corps reached agreement to standardize on a new variant of the system to be called Joint Capabilities Release (JCR) developed by the Project Manager, Joint Battle Command-Platform (PM JBC-P) that was fielded in 2013. JCR takes advantage of the BFT-2 network, a new satellite infrastructure that can handle significantly more data than the first BFT. Deployment The United States Army awarded TRW (that became a part of Northrop Grumman in 2002) the prime contract for FBCB2 in 1995. ESP (Engineering Solutions and Products) is now the prime contractor for the system. FBCB2 was first used in actual military operations in the former Yugoslavia in 1998. It played a key role in operations in Iraq and Afghanistan starting in 2003, where it is still in use. Work has begun on plans to reach the level of nearly 160,000 tracking systems in the Army within a few years.

The literary society was founded by New York's elite black women to promote self-improvement through community activities, reading and discussion. Produced and given in 1837, the speech discusses how the neglect of cultivating the mind would keep blacks inferior to whites and would have whites and enemies believe that blacks do not have any minds at all. Jennings believed the mind was very powerful and its improvement could help with the abolition of slavery and discrimination. Therefore, she called upon black women to develop their mind and take action. The importance of improving the mind was a consistent theme among elite black women.Alexander, Leslie M. African or American? Black Identity and Political Activism in New York City, 1784-1861, (University of Illinois: 2008), pp. 91. By 1854, Jennings had become a schoolteacher and church organist. She taught at the city's private African Free School, which had several locations by this time, and later in the public schools. Jennings v. Third Ave. Railroad In the 1850s, the horse-drawn streetcar on rails became a more common mode of transportation, competing with the horse-drawn omnibus in the city. (Elevated heavy rail, the next transportation mode in the city, did not go into service until 1869.) Like the omnibus lines, the streetcar lines were owned by private companies, and their owners and drivers could refuse service to any passengers and enforce segregated seating. On Sunday, July 16, 1854, Jennings went to the First Colored Congregational Church, where she was an organist. As she was running late, she boarded a streetcar of the Third Avenue Railroad Company at the corner of Pearl Street and Chatham Street. The conductor ordered her to get off. When she refused, the conductor tried to remove her by force. Eventually, with the aid of a police officer, Jennings was ejected from the streetcar. Horace Greeley's New York Tribune commented on the incident in February 1855: The incident sparked an organized movement among black New Yorkers to end racial discrimination on streetcars, led by notables such as Jennings' father, Rev. James W.C. Pennington, and Rev. Henry Highland Garnet. Her story was publicized by Frederick Douglass in his newspaper, and it received national attention. Jennings's father filed a lawsuit (on behalf of his daughter) against the driver, the conductor, and the Third Avenue Railroad Company in Brooklyn, where the Third Avenue company was headquartered. This was one of four streetcar companies franchised in the city and had been in operation for about one year. She was represented by the law firm of Culver, Parker, and Arthur. Her case was handled by the firm's 24-year-old junior partner Chester A. Arthur, future president of the United States. In 1855, the court ruled in her favor. In his charge to the jury, Brooklyn Circuit Court Judge William Rockwell declared: \\"Colored persons if sober, well behaved and free from disease, had the same rights as others and could neither be excluded by any rules of the company, nor by force or violence.\\" The jury awarded Jennings damages in the amount of $250 (comparable to $6,000 to $10,000 in 2015 dollars) as well as $22.50 in costs. The next day, the Third Avenue Railroad Company ordered its cars desegregated. As important as the Jennings case was, it did not mean that all streetcar lines would desegregate. Leading African-American activists formed the New York Legal Rights Association to continue the fight. In May 1855, James W. C. Pennington brought suit after being forcefully removed from a car of the Eighth Avenue Railroad, another of the first four companies. After steps forward and back, a decade later in 1865, New York's public transit services were fully desegregated. The last case was a challenge by a black woman named Ellen Anderson, a widow of a fallen United States Colored Troops soldier, a fact that won public support for her.Volk, Kyle G. (2014).

They had a son, Thomas J. Graham. He was a sickly child who died of convulsions at the age of one during the New York Draft Riots of July 16, 1863. With the assistance of a white undertaker, the Grahams slipped through mob-filled streets and buried their child in Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn. The funeral service was read by Reverend Morgan Dix of the Trinity Church on Wall Street.History.com After the New York Draft Riots, there were numerous attacks against the African-American community.

Many casts, with different finishes, exist of the group. That pictured here is seen at the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC. Another example of the statue can be found in Bordeaux, France, where it faces Saint André's Cathedral. One is found, for example, at the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Copenhagen, Denmark, where the statue overlooks the museum's Winter Garden. Mercié designed this sculpture following France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. He intended to honor those French soldiers who had fallen in the conflict, especially his friend, the artist Henri Regnault (1843-1871). Upon France's defeat, Mercié changed the hero's head from lifted to fallen. A winged female allegorical image of Fame (or of Hope) carries to glory a dying French hero, his broken sword a sign of defeat. Mercié's original plaster sculpture won a medal at the 1874 Paris Salon. Bronze copies were cast in different sizes by the great foundry of Ferdinand Barbedienne. Its uplifting reassurance that those defeated were nevertheless cared for and granted immortality made this work well received among the French public, who felt humiliated after losing the war. Despite its acclaim, the work was harshly criticized by fellow French sculptor Jean Baffier for its neoclassical style and for its celebration of a defeat: > \\"We have been beaten like wheat in a barn, and we shouted: 'Glory to the > losers' – And along comes some sort of bastard artist, the pupil of a > sexless school, to put up the image of our cowardice.\\" Belfort memorial, a comparable piece by Mercié Mercié returned to this formula of a female allegorical figure with a soldier in his 1882 Belfort war memorial (nicknamed ', or \\"Still\\").

It was founded on 20 November 1991 and consists of Eight faculties.  History =Palabaddala Monastic University This ancient university was established by Kalikala Sahittya Sarvagna Pandita ParakramaBahu, the Second (1235–1271 AD) in the Dambadeniya period. Bhikku Dharmakirti held its chancellorship. Meanwhile, the monastic institution of higher education in Sabaragamuwa had been in the custody of Deva Pathiraja, the royal agent to the King Parakramabahu, the Second. Recent years During the early 1990s, the Sri Lankan government came up with the concept of \\"University Affiliated Colleges\\". The concept was triggered by social problems faced by the younger generation, in addition to several committee reports which made recommendations to the government on youth unrest. Based on these reports, the government decided to open new avenues for the younger generation by means of establishing diploma-awarding bodies, which were to be affiliated with several national universities. The Sabaragamuwa Affiliated University College (SAUC) was one such institution formed in affiliation with the University of Sri Jayawardenepura. Established at Belihuloya in the Sabaragamuwa Province on 20 November 1991 under the Sabaragamuwa Province Affiliated University College Ordinance No. 14 of 1992, the SAUC was ceremoniously declared open by His Excellency R. Premadasa, then President of Sri Lanka, on 8 February 1992. Following the opening, academic programmes of the SAUC commenced on 7 May 1992. Prof. Dayananda Somasundara, the founding director of the college, determined that the SAUC should become a national university. Guided by his motivation, the academic, administrative and non-academic staff, students, and the nearby communities actively contributed towards the development and promotion of SAUC into a national university. As a result, the government decided to elevate SAUC to the status of a national university, amalgamating the Uva Affiliated University College (UAUC) at Rahangala and the Buttala Affiliated University College (BAUC) as the Faculties of Agricultural Sciences and Applied Sciences respectively. (Before this amalgamation, the SAUC at Belihuloya and the UAUC at Buttala were affiliated to the University of Sri Jayawardenepura, while the UAUC at Rahangala was affiliated to the University of Peradeniya.) The directors of the UAUC and BAUC were the Rev. Elle Wimalananda Thero and Prof. Arthur Bamunuarachchi respectively. Professor Dayananda Somasundara was appointed as the first vice-chancellor in 1995. He continued in the post till 2001. The Faculty of Agricultural Sciences was functioning at Rahangala under difficult conditions until 2001. The main difficulty was the long distance between the university's main premises and Rahangala. In addition, the academic staff and students pleaded with the university administration to shift the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences from Rahangala to the main university premises at Belihuloya. In response, the faculty was moved to Belihuloya in 2001. Meanwhile, the Faculty of Applied Sciences was still operative in Buttala. In 2008 this, too, was moved from Buttala to the main university at Belihuloya for the same reasons. At present, the university has five faculties – Agricultural Sciences, Applied Sciences, Geomatics, Management Studies and Social Sciences and Languages. SUSL has several other institutes and centres, which are in great demand. They offer programmes to undergraduate and postgraduate students and the wider community. The university practices a semester-based system and conducts most of its study programmes in English medium. Although a bilingual medium (English/Sinhala or English/Tamil) instruction is available in the Faculty of Social Sciences and Languages, the proportion of students who follow study programmes in Sinhala medium is on the decline. Examples of the courses offered only by SUSL are the BSc degrees in Surveying Sciences, Agri-Business Management, Food Science and Technology, Tourism Management, Physical Education and Sports Sciences Management, Eco- Tourism Management, and many more. In addition to the above SUSL offers B.A. degrees and conducts postgraduate studies in subjects such as Ayurvedic Hospital Management, Indigenous Community Studies, Entrepreneurship and New Venture Creation etc. Students who follow these degree programmes benefit from these courses; this is as an incentive for the university to continue to introduce more innovative courses. The university has signed several memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with international universities, and national and international organizations, with the primary intention of collaboratively raising standards of academic excellence. Among the international institutions that have ventured into partnership with SUSL via MoUs are leading educational bodies such as Durham University, UK; Guilin University of Technology, China; Shivaji University, India; Gombe State University, Nigeria; and Gothenburg University, Sweden. Campus Entrance of the university. The SUSL is in the former Japanese expatriate village of the Samanalawewa project. Hence, from the inception of SUSL, some of the Samanalawewa project buildings became available. After expansion and renovation, this village became the hub of the university. Compared to its past, the university has achieved a high level of infrastructural development, including modern, state-of-the-art building complexes for its faculties. Management Studies, Social Sciences and Languages and Applied Sciences have received new building complexes, with up-to-date technology and facilities. Upon the invitation of Prof. Mahinda S. Rupasinghe, the vice-chancellor of SUSL, the new building of the Faculty of Applied Sciences and the second stage of the faculty building of the Faculty of Social Sciences and Languages were ceremoniously declared opened by His Excellency Mahinda Rajapakshe, president of Sri Lanka on 31 March 2012. Also present were the Hon. S. B. Dissanayake, minister of Higher Education, Hon. Nandimiththra Ekanayake, deputy minister of Higher Education and other honored guests. Meanwhile, construction of the new buildings complex for the Faculty of Geomatics and the playground and pavilion were completed as well. The Faculty of Agricultural Sciences had several new buildings, which were deemed adequate for its present requirements. In the future, a separate new building will be constructed for the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences to hold its growing student population. These infrastructural changes reflect steps taken towards the progress of the university.  Location  SUSL is in the southern foothills of the central mountain range about 162 km from Colombo, on the Colombo–Badulla (A4) road. Administratively, SUSL belongs to the Imbulpe Divisional Secretariat and to the Ratnapura District in Sabaragamuwa Province. The university is 500 m from the Pambahinna Junction, on the A4 highway which runs through Belihuloya. The closest city to the university is Balangoda (18 km), the closest railway station is Haputale (31 km), while Bandarawela is only 40 km from the university.  Organization  The SUSL was established on 7 November 1995 by the Gazette Notification No. 896/2 and operates under the provisions of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978 and the Universities (Amendment) Act No. 7 of 1985. SUSL was ceremonially declared open on 2 February 1996 by Her Excellency Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the president of Sri Lanka. The organizational structure represents a number of chief administrative positions such as chancellor, vice-chancellor, deans and many others, who plan for future development. They implement and monitor decisions taken by the overall management.  Chancellors  *Dr. C. R.

This was to become SB+ and was released in early 1990. Traditionally, up to this time, Pick systems were accessed using green- screen terminals like the Wyse60 or VT100 but with the rise of the PC a new paradigm presented itself and so around the end of 1991 the product was enhanced with the addition of a specialised terminal emulation client called Termulator! This was able to tightly integrate the server and the PC to allow for facilities like downloads direct from the server into Lotus 1-2-3 or the new kid on the block, Microsoft Excel. Shortly after, the client program was renamed SBClient and the ability to develop and render screens in either character or GUI mode. Having been bought by Unidata Corporation in 1996, and following Unidata's merger with VMark Software to form Ardent Software in 1998, the SystemBuilder product set came under the ownership of Informix in 2000 following their purchase of Ardent Software for its Datastage product. Subsequently, in 2001 Informix themselves were bought by IBM, and the U2 and SystemBuilder products eventually found their way to become part of IBM's Data Management portfolio. Development of the SystemBuilder and RedBack products continued in Sydney until 2005, when they were merged with the U2 development team located in Denver, United States. On 1 October 2009, Rocket Software announced'Acquisition Announcement' Rocket Software the purchase of the entire U2 suite, which includes SystemBuilder, from IBM. The SystemBuilder Development Environment The System Builder/SB+ server environment is based around a set of key tools and utilities. These leverage out to provide a powerful and comprehensive development environment which is, itself, built mainly from these tools. SB+ includes an application menuing system, screen generator, a 3GL programming language, an expression language, the GUI components and report writer tool. Evolution In August 2008, System Builder released SB/XA v6.0.0 SB/XA which includes many enhancements to the System Builder suite including a new user interface based on Web/XAML protocols.

They are sometimes also referred to as \\"the lost tribe\\". The group were hailed as \\"the last nomads\\" in the international press when they left their nomadic life in October 1984.The Last Nomads at Aboriginal Art Store History The group roamed between waterholes near Lake Mackay, near the Western Australia- Northern Territory border, wearing hairstring belts and armed with wooden spears and spear throwers, and intricately carved boomerangs. Their diet was dominated by goanna and rabbit as well as bush food native plants. The group was a family, consisting of two co-wives (Nanyanu and Papalanyanu) and seven children. There were four brothers (Warlimpirrnga, Walala, Tamlik, and Piyiti) and three sisters (Yalti, Yikultji and Takariya). The boys and girls were all in their early-to-late teens, although their exact ages were not known; the mothers were in their late 30s. The father – the husband of the two wives – died. After this, the group travelled south to where they thought their relatives might be, as they had seen 'smokes' in that direction. They encountered a man from Kiwirrkura but due to misunderstanding they fled back north while he returned to the community and alerted others who then travelled back with him to find the group. The community members quickly realised that the group were relatives who had been left behind in the desert twenty years earlier, when many had travelled into the missions nearer Alice Springs. The community members travelled by vehicle to where the group were last seen and then tracked them for some time before finding them. After making contact and establishing their relationships, the Pintupi nine were invited to come and live at Kiwirrkura, where most of them still reside. The Pintupi-speaking trackers told them there was plenty of food, and water that came out of pipes; Yalti has said that this concept astounded them. Medical examination revealed that the Tjapaltjarri clan (as they are also known) were \\"in beautiful condition. Not an ounce of fat, well proportioned, strong, fit, healthy\\".Charlie McMahon: Sunday Times At Kiwirrkura, near Kintore, they met with other members of their extended family. In 1986, Piyiti went back to the desert. Warlimpirrnga, Walala, and Tamlik (now known as \\"Thomas\\") have gained international recognition in the art world as the Tjapaltjarri Brothers.Tjapaltjarri Brothers at the Aboriginal Art Store The three sisters, Yalti, Yikultji and Takariya, are also well-known Aboriginal artists whose works can be seen on exhibition and purchased from a number of art dealers.

It borders Lauca National Park in Chile. The park is home to indigenous people, known as the Aymara, whose influential ancient culture can be seen in various aspects throughout the park. The park contains unique cultural artifacts and ecological wonders, making it an exemplary location for ecotourism. Many different indigenous plants and animals are exclusive to this area; therefore, its continued conservation is of great ecological importance. Management of the park operates under a co-administrative approach, with local people and park conservationists engaging in a constant dialogue regarding park upkeep and policy. History Sajama National Park is Bolivia's oldest national park. The park lies within the Central Andean dry puna ecoregion. It features a spectacular Andean landscape, with elevations ranging from 4,200 to 6,542 meters (13,780 to 21,463 ft). It contains the snowy cone of the volcano Sajama, the highest mountain in Bolivia at 6542 meters. The park also includes the Payachata volcanic group. The area was declared a nature reserve in 1939 because of the native Queñoa De Altura (Polylepis tarapacana) that grows on the hillsides of this region.Sajama National Park - UNESCO World Heritage Centre This shrub-like tree has adapted to the high elevations and harsh climate of the Andes. At the time that the area was declared a national park, rampant harvesting of this tree was taking place to create charcoal to supply Bolivian mines. On July 1, 2003, it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List due to its universal cultural and natural significance. Aymara people The Aymara people are indigenous to the Bolivian and Peruvian altiplano, and make up a quarter of Bolivia's population. Latest estimates predict about 300 families in the affluence zone of the park and about 100 in the park's interior. Much of the Aymara population participates in llama and alpaca herding and yarn spinning. Circular houses, traditional to the Aymara, can still be found today. The Aymara people also have the unique tradition of handing down historic textiles through the generations as inherited wealth. Because the Aymara people rely so heavily on the natural environment, they take on a protectoral role regarding its use. For example, the Aymara recently protested the Dakar Rally, an off-road race taking place through Bolivia's salt flats for the first time. The Aymara cited fears of environmental damage from litter and ruts in the white landscape from the vehicles as cause for concern. The Aymara have traditionally been an underrepresented group since the times of colonialism. Therefore, they fought alongside the victorious liberal party during Bolivia's Civil War of 1899. However, the Aymara are still being targeted. One current example of the struggle between the Aymara and the Bolivian government is the use of the coca plant by the Aymara. The Aymara have grown coca plants for centuries, using the leaves in traditional medicines and rituals. Over the last century, the Bolivian government has done its best to restrict this process due to fears of cocaine production. While coca cultivation for traditional practices is legal in Bolivia, there has still been strife and conflict between the government and the Aymara people due to this plant. When the practices of poor, disenfranchised, or indigenous people is demonized or condemned, there is often heavy dispute and strife between the two sides. By targeting the Aymara's use of the coca plant, the Bolivian government could be helping to create an even bigger problem and contributing to unrest. Small populations with little political power are often viewed as “inferior”, and can easily be blamed for an array of different problems, from political, to social, to environmental. The plight of the Aymara people has further been complicated with the election of Bolivia's first indigenous president, Evo Morales, in 2006. Morales was born into an Aymara family of subsistence farmers. In some senses, one would say that this election helped give the indigenous an extremely loud voice in Bolivian politics. In 2009, Morales helped enact a new constitution. The new constitution names Bolivia as a secular state, rather than a Catholic one as the previous constitution stated. It also recognizes a variety of autonomies at the local and departmental level, which many argue gives people like the Aymara more freedom. However, there has been some backlash against the constitution. Many opposed to it claim that it is \\"Aymara-centric\\", and not applicable or appropriate for all Bolivian citizens and is actually ostracizing. Attractions The Sajama National Park includes geological natural wonders like volcanoes, diverse organisms, and thermal springs, and also cultural wonders such as ancient burial buildings, cave paintings, and colonial architecture and art. Queñoa trees located in Sajama National Park The Queñoa (sometimes seen as keñua) forests that rise along the slope of the Sajama Mountain in the park are regarded as some of the highest forests in the world. There are numerous geysers and hot springs (Aguas Termales) which are about an hour walk from the village of Sajama. This area of Bolivia also features the Sajama Lines, mysterious lines covering the altiplano, etched into ground over thousands of years by the ancient ancestors of the Aymara people. The lines are estimated to be about 16,000 kilometers in length, roughly three times the breadth of the United States. The lines are thought to have been used as ancient pilgrimage routes. The park is also scattered with cultural treasures and remnants of the Aymara's ancient culture. Chullpas, tall funerary towers devoted to noble Aymara families, dot the landscape. These shrines are thought to have been deliberately placed in visible areas to ensure reverence and remembrance for the dead. Pucaras, ancient fortifications, can also be found. In terms of wildlife, Sajama is home to a unique set of organisms particular to the alpine regions of the Andes. Plants and animals must be able to handle high altitudes with less available oxygen, cold nightly temperatures and frosts well into the spring, little shade or protection from the elements, and arid, dry conditions. One example of unique wildlife in the park is the vicuña, a species of camelid related to the llama and the alpaca. These animals are prized because of their soft and warm, but extremely lightweight fur. Historically, only Incan emperors were allowed to wear their wool. Indigenous populations in the area still continue a rich cultural tradition of myths, legends, and rituals involving the vicuña. Once poached to near extinction because their fine, valuable wool, they are now protected in the area and their numbers are rebounding. The area is also home to armadillos, viscachas, bears, Andean cats, pumas, condors, pink flamingos, coots (black ducks), hummingbirds, rheas, and many more unique creatures. Ecotourism Ecotourism can be defined in a variety of ways, but broadly it is travel that has the object of enjoying features of what is seen as the natural, beautiful, and exotic environment. Main themes of ecotourism also involve sustainable activities and behavior that results in minimal negative consequences for the environment. Until recently, tourist activity in the park has been relatively nonexistent. The park is located far from any urban centers, and surrounded by mostly undeveloped land lacking infrastructure. However, a focus area for the co- administrative management committee is the creation of sustainable and responsible income-generating practices. For example, the Tomarapi eco-lodge opened in 2003, and provides local food and lodging for between 2000 and 3000 visitors a year. The lodge is currently managed entirely by native Aymara villagers. The climate in the Bolivian altiplano is not very conducive to productive agriculture. The area is typically very dry, receiving less rainfall than half the climactic demand. There are also very cold nights in this arid region, with frosts occurring well into the typical growing season. Only hearty crops like tubers and grains such as quinoa can grow in this area, and even then they are not extremely successful. Because agriculture would not be a viable source of income for many of the people in this region, they have been forced to look for other income options. Ecotourism can significantly aid natural places with weak economies, and help to generate an economical way to promote preservation. However, certain elements should be provided in order to ensure profitable and safe ecotourism. These elements, which are not exclusive or explicitly limiting, include culturally appropriate opportunities for local people, secure land tenure, and a focus on themes broader than simply provided economic opportunity. Arrangements between the Aymara people and the rest of the management committee for the park have helped to ensure excessive planning and local participation in decisions is taking place, but admittedly plans are not always perfect. Even when using the most optimistic of scenarios, SERNAP concedes that a fair number of indigenous people will have to leave this region in order to assure a minimum livelihood. In situations like these, every cost and benefit of ecotourism must be carefully weighed. Management Bolivian law defines protected areas as “natural areas with or without human intervention, declared under state protection by law, in order to protect and preserve the flora and fauna, genetic resources, natural ecosystems, watersheds and values of scientific, esthetic, historical, economic, and social interest, in order to conserve and protect natural and cultural heritage of the country.” As all protected areas in Bolivia are inhabited, nature conservation is not possible against the will of the local people. It is necessary to take their traditional rights, existing value systems and social organization into account. The reserve is jointly administered by park service officials and the indigenous people, the Aymara. However, the collaborative efforts between the Aymara and the Bolivian national parks authority (Servicio Nacional de Áreas Protegidas, SERNAP) did not begin until 1998, when SERNAP was formed. Sajama National Park did not have a formal administration nor park rangers until 1995, and relations between the Aymara people and this early park administration was essentially nonexistent due to top-down approaches and policies. Sajama's co-administrative Management Committee now includes representatives from each of the communities, the sub- alcaldía (local administration's decentralized office in Sajama village), the mayor of Curahuara de Carangas, a representative of the prefectural administration, and delegates from different NGOs active in the area. From the beginning, this diverse committee laid out fairly detailed plans to ensure that their economic and conservational goals were met. The original committee members believed that the success of the park depended upon the incorporation of three things: planning, participation, and projects. Planning regulations and developing a \\"horizon\\" for the park was a long and arduous process, but it brought the diverse group of people closer together. The planning and discussion helped to eradicate previously held prejudices between the Aymara people and the newly instated park rangers. Through dialogue, often new ideas and techniques for management and conservation can surface. From the aspect of planning, municipal, regional, and traditional authorities, as well as community members are required to participate in the management of Bolivia's national parks. This ensures that the voices and views of all stakeholders are clearly acknowledged. This process also increases trust between the different inhabitants of the area, because they know that they are playing a role in the process. Finally, projects are aimed to generate income while offering alternative livelihoods that employ a more sustainable use of biodiversity resources. Besides ecotourism, there have been arrangements to create initiatives for the sustainable management of the park's vicuñas. Vicuña fur is extremely valuable, with scarves of their wool costing well over $1,000. However, it is slow growing and may take anywhere from 2–3 years to regrow to a commercially viable length after shearing. By caring for the vicuñas, the Aymara deepen their connection to their environment and create a continuing means for income. However, the trade of vicuña fur is highly regulated, causing slow trade and sometimes even an inability to trade. While a local management co-administrative approach may seem like a very useful and effective means to protect this land, it also has its detriments. Some challenges to management systems like the one in place in this park are unclear roles, distrust, and poor communication, which has been seen in Sajama. Significance The icy cap of Mount Sajama, Bolivia's highest point, has enabled a variety of scientific endeavors. The recovery of ice cores from the summit in 1998 offered a unique look at historic South American climactic and atmospheric conditions, and marked the first time that this information of this kind has been available for a location with a tropical latitude. Data from these cores indicates an increase in many atmospheric heavy metals, likely caused by anthropogenic sources. The presence of these metals could be due to the production of non-ferrous metal. Significant in countries such as Chile or Peru, the emissions from this industry have decreased in recent times. The Aymara people who have lived in this region since before colonial times have a special bond with the environment and landscape of the park. However, some may question the effectiveness of protected areas when considering socioeconomic impacts on surrounding communities. Regulating the use of protected land may harm the livelihoods and cultures of those people who cherish it the most. However, recent studies in Bolivia have shown no evidence that the establishment of protected areas has exacerbated poverty. If anything, these studies conclude, estimates indicate that communities that are affected by protected areas have experienced greater levels of poverty reduction when compared to similar unaffected communities. Therefore, the presence of Sajama National Park and its management committee may help the Aymara people, giving them power to protect their environment and the organisms that inhabit it.

The song was recorded in September, 2005 and released through the Internet about 30 hours after the death of Puerto Rican Revolutionary leader Filiberto Ojeda Ríos in what appeared to be a botched raid at his house.  Background, recording and release  While Calle 13 was in the middle of the recording of their first album, Filiberto, who was the leader of the Puerto Rican Revolutionary group known as Los Macheteros was killed during a raid at his house led by the FBI, on September 23, 2005. Ojeda Ríos was deemed a fugitive by the FBI (he had been hiding at various places in Puerto Rico over a period that lasted exactly 15 years) for refusing to submit himself to justice on charges issued in absentia after a bank robbery in Hartford, Connecticut for which he was labeled as a conspirator. The raid's timing (which coincided with the anniversary of the Grito de Lares, the most successful event ever related with the Puerto Rican independence movement), led a considerable amount of the Puerto Rican populace to speculate that the event had the dual purpose of killing Ojeda and giving the pro-independence movement in Puerto Rico an exemplary punishment. Angered by the FBI's action, Residente (singer of Calle 13) wrote a song about what happened and asked his record label, White Lion, to allow them to release the single about thirty hours after Ojeda's killing, to the public via the Internet through viral marketing through Indymedia Puerto Rico, an alternative news website. The song was co-produced by local DJ Danny Fornaris.  Musical structure The song opens with an attention call addressed to people of all social backgrounds in Puerto Rico. Residente then describes his considerable anger against what had happened to Ojeda, and how that represents a humiliation to Puerto Ricans (\\"(A) nuestra bandera la han llena'o de mea'o\\", meaning \\"Our flag has been pissed upon\\") It also shows the political concerns of Calle 13, as evidenced by their allusions to 9/11, the U.S. government's involvement in the Ponce massacre. The song suggests putting an end to U.S. military and federal-police intervention in Puerto Rico by involving the entire Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, but particularly public housing dwellers, those residing in \\"caseríos\\" who normally battle each other on urban skirmishes related with crime, but who also happen to have federal law enforcement officials as a common enemy. The duo was criticized by some who believed the lyrics promoted violence against U.S. authorities (such as \\"hoy me disfrazo de machetero / y esta noche voy a ahorcar a diez marineros\\" (\\"Today I'll dress up as a machetero / and tonight I'll hang ten sailors\\") Also, \\"Y por eso protesto (...) Y hasta por un septiembre 11.\\" (And therefore I protest (....) and even for a September 11.\\" Calle 13 stated that the song was not meant to be taken literally and merely symbolized his frustration with Ojeda's killing. The lyrics also include the phrase \\"Sin cojones la radio y las ventas, White Lion me dio pasaporte para tirar este corte\\" (\\"Bollocks about radio and album sales, White Lion gave me a passport [permission] to throw [publish] this cut\\"), evidencing Residente's wish to have the song distributed for free with permission from the label.  Music video  Eventually, a video clip for the song surfaced, which combines images from Ojeda himself, his burial, scenes from historical footage from the 1954 armed attack to the United States House of Representatives by Puerto Rican nationalists, and images of everyday Puerto Ricans holding protest signs. Spanish-Puerto Rican thrash metal band \\"Juerguistas y Borrachos\\" also issued a remix of the song, adding electric guitar riffs to it. Both media items were also released to the public through viral marketing.  Impact  Public controversy about the song's lyrics ensured immediate attention from mainstream media in Puerto Rico and gave the band instant rise to local fame. The song, according to critics, \\"redefined what a reggaeton vocalist's relationship to Puerto Rico should be.\\"Frances Negrón-Muntaner and Raquel Z. Rivera, \\"Reggaeton Nation\\" (17 December 2007) Up to that moment, most local reggaetón artists had opted not to address political subjects in their songs. In comparison, \\"Querido FBI\\" became the subject of debate at a forum hosted at University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras soon after its release, and had its lyrics posted in local newspapers such as Primera Hora and Claridad. Although the song mentions the prospect of revenge for Ojeda's death, the duo asserts that the song was not intended to endorse violence.

Most of the housing is in the form of residence halls on the school's campus, but there are also university apartments, fraternity and sorority housing, and free-standing housing for grad students, faculty and staff. The residence halls are arranged into five neighborhoods; Brody Neighborhood, North Neighborhood, South Neighborhood, River Trail Neighborhood, and East Neighborhood. The university expanded its housing greatly in the 1950s and 1960s, resulting in what is now the largest residence hall system in the United States.Kiernan, Vincent. \\"Michigan State Asks Students to Turn Off Their Computers Over Winter Break\\".

Residence halls=North Neighborhood North Neighborhood, which includes Red Cedar neighborhood and West Circle neighborhood, was designed by the Malcomson, Calder & Hammond Architectural Firm, and was built throughout the 1930s and 1940s. This was built as one of the nine Public Works Administration (PWA) building projects on campus in that era.https://www.msu.edu/~msuarhc/buildingexhibit.htm Built on \\"sacred ground\\", the original campus growth sprang from this area. The ivy- covered halls are of a Tudor-style design, with high-pitched gabled roofs, metal casement windows, slate roofs, and Renaissance detailing, and recall medieval estates. Currently all but Yakeley are co-ed, though the West Circle complex was originally all female. Reflecting that fact, each of the West Circle halls is named for a woman who made significant contributions to Michigan State. Campbell Hall North Neighborhood is composed of residence halls from both West Circle and Red Cedar: The West Circle neighborhood is made up of six buildings: *Mary Anne Mayo (1931) - houses 250 studentsMichigan: A Guide to the Wolverine State by Federal Writers' Project *Louise H.

Mason/Theophilus Abbot Halls *Jonathan L. Snyder/T. Glenn Phillips Halls = Mary Mayo Hall = Mary Mayo Hall was built in 1931 as the first residence hall in the West Circle complex. It is named after Mary Mayo, a school teacher and wife of a Civil War veteran who was also an active member of the Grange. Mayo wanted her daughter to be able to attend a collegiate institution, but MAC (Michigan Agricultural College, former name for Michigan State University) did not then have a program for women. Through her speeches and involvement with the Grange, Mary Mayo became an advocate for a women's program and women's housing at MAC. Her persistence was rewarded in 1896 when the first women's course was officially created. Mayo Hall reopened in the fall of 2009 after a 15-month renovation which included upgrades to the plumbing and electrical systems, new furniture, and many cosmetic changes on its interior. Even with all of the changes, every effort was made to preserve Mayo's historic architecture and sacred grounds. Mary Mayo Hall is the oldest residence hall still being used as such, and it has long been rumored that the building is haunted. There are various stories to explain the ghostly presence that many residents have felt, though no concrete evidence exists to show that these stories are much more than tall tales.

The four- piece were made up of Thom Moore (lead vocals, guitar), Kirin J. Callinan (guitar), Ash Moss (bass guitar) and Julian Sudek (drums, percussion). Their debut self-titled album was issued in August 2008 and peaked at No. 10 on the ARIA Hitseekers Albums component chart. The band dissolved in February 2009 after four years together. History The band formed in 2005 after Moore met Callinan and Sudek at a Morning After Girls show. Callinan and Sudek lived in the same area and were childhood friends. Bassist Ash Moss joined the band soon after. The band played their first show in April 2005, three days after their first rehearsal. 2006 saw the band tour Australia with The Strokes, record two tracks with Dave Sitek from TV on the Radio, and after an intense bidding war, eventually sign with Capitol Records in the US. However, the deal would be short-lived, and 2007 saw the band part ways with Capitol after its merger with Virgin. The band toured with the Pixies, Editors, Cut Copy, Wolf & Cub and the Horrors, and played at the Sydney and Gold Coast legs of the V Festival. The band's first release, the Kept Low EP, was recorded and released August 2007 on Levity in Australia. On their self-titled debut album, released in Australia independently in August 2008, they collaborated with producer Tony Cohen and mixed the album in Melbourne with Tony Espie. It peaked at No. 10 on the ARIA Hitseekers Albums component chart. Mercy Arms have been on hiatus since February 2009 after touring with the Big Day Out nationally.

The film stars Franco Nero, Jack Palance, Tony Musante, Eduardo Fajardo and Giovanna Ralli, and features a musical score by Ennio Morricone and Bruno Nicolai. Plot On the northern side of the Mexico–United States border, Sergei \\"Polack\\" Kowalski, a well- groomed, greedy mercenary, attends a circus performance where he recognizes the show's lead rodeo clown as Paco Roman. During the performance, Kowalski reminisces on how he and Paco fought together as revolutionaries against the Mexican Government. Prior to the start of their partnership, Paco, a peon working in a silver mine owned by Elias Garcia, rebels against his boss and humiliates him and his two brothers, including Colonel Alfonso Garcia. He is soon captured, but saved from execution by his friends. Meanwhile, Kowalski makes a deal with Elias and his brother to take their silver safely across the border. Curly, Kowalski's flamboyant American rival, sees the three men talking and tracks down the brothers to find out what they hired Kowalski for, after which Curly kills the two. When Kowalski arrives at the mine to meet the Garcias, he meets Paco and his revolutionaries instead. Colonel Garcia's troops arrive to attack them, and Kowalski agrees to help Paco fight them for money. With the help of Kowalski and his Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun, the revolutionaries drive Colonel Garcia's forces away. Kowalski then leaves, but he is soon ambushed by Curly. Paco's group arrives and kills Curly's men. Although Curly swears revenge, they let him go after stripping him of his clothes. Paco then hires Kowalski to teach him how to lead a revolution. The revolutionaries travel from town to town robbing money, guns and horses from the army. They also release a prisoner named Columba, who joins the group. Columba at first resents Paco's violent methods and his over-reliance on Kowalski, but both soon begin to respect each other. After Paco stays in one town to protect the people, despite Kowalski telling him that they can not match the army sent to capture them, Kowalski leaves the group again. Paco's group admits defeat and returns to Kowalski. Kowalski doubles his fee, but he and Paco make another deal. After the revolutionaries take over a town by defeating a whole regiment, Paco, realizing the unfairness of the financial burden Kowalski has placed on him and Columba, imprisons Kowalski, confiscates his money, and marries Columba. When Colonel Garcia's army, along with Curly, attack them, Paco realizes he can not manage the situation on his own and decides to set Kowalski free, but finds himself locked up while Kowalski escapes. Columba frees Paco, and the two escape before Curly can find them. In the present, Kowalski notes that it has been six months since Paco betrayed him. After the performance ends, Curly and his men capture Paco. Kowalski shoots Curly's men and gives him and Paco both a rifle and a bullet, so that the two can have a fair duel. After Paco kills Curly, Kowalski takes him prisoner and heads to the headquarters of the 51st Regiment to collect the reward offered for his head. Columba, witnessing Kowalski's capture of her husband, rides to the 51st's headquarters with two members of Paco's troupe and meets with Colonel Garcia, pretending to betray Paco by telling him where the two are. When the army troops find the pair, Kowalski also finds himself arrested as there is now an even bigger reward for his head. The two are then sentenced to death by firing squad. However, Columba executes her plan, and holds Garcia at gunpoint while the circus performers create a diversion. Using two machine guns, Paco and Kowalski kill most of Garcia's troops, and they escape with Columba and the performers. The group splits up; Columba and the performers leave to spread the word of Paco's return to Mexico, Paco prepares to lie low before reuniting with Columba, and Kowalski, who has been given a share of his own reward money, prepares to leave Mexico. Kowalski suggests to Paco that they should team up as a mercenary pair, but Paco assures him that his \\"dream\\" is in Mexico. As the two friends part ways, Colonel Garcia and four soldiers prepare to ambush and kill Paco. Kowalski cuts them all down with his rifle from a nearby hillside. Before leaving, he yells, \\"Good luck, Paco! Keep dreaming, but with your eyes open!\\" CastProduction In 1968, Franco Solinas and Giorgio Arlorio wrote The Mercenary. Initially, the film was going to be directed by Gillo Pontecorvo. Release The Mercenary was released in December 1968.

History In 1988, Ohio Northern University applied to the Federal Communications Commission to build a new radio station in Ada. WONB began broadcasting October 18, 1991. It was a student-run station, with studios in the Freed Center for the Performing Arts and a transmitter on campus. The station played a classic hits format during the daytime and more contemporary hits at night. WONB was associated with the school's communication and media studies department and its multimedia journalism major. In December 2019, Ohio Northern announced it was selling the WONB license and facility to Holy Family Communications, which would use the station to rebroadcast its Catholic radio station WJTA, licensed to Glandorf. The facility sold for $175,000. Holy Family had been attempting to expand into the Lima area for nearly a decade; in 2016, the network had lost out on a translator that was then bought by a commercial broadcaster and relocated to Cincinnati. Ohio Northern has shifted its student radio to a live stream and podcasts; it also did not sell the WONB call letters in the transaction.

The second tropical cyclone of the season, Isa developed from a disturbance in the monsoon trough near the Caroline Islands on April 12. It moved erratically at first, though after attaining tropical storm status it curved westward due to the subtropical ridge to its north. Isa very gradually intensified, and on April 20 the typhoon reached peak 1-min winds of 270 km/h (165 mph), as reported by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center; Japan Meteorological Agency reported maximum 10-min winds of 155 km/h (100 mph). After turning northward, it accelerated to the northeast, and merged with a larger extratropical cyclone on April 24. Early in its duration, Isa caused light rainfall and moderate winds on Pohnpei. Later, a stationary rainband from the typhoon dropped heavy precipitation on Guam during its dry season. Damage in the Guam National Weather Service area of responsibility totaled $1 million (1997 USD, $ USD), the majority of it from crop damage. No deaths were reported. Meteorological history In early April, the monsoon trough established itself across Micronesia near the equator. An area of convection within the trough developed in the Caroline Islands on April 9, and resembled the characteristics of a monsoon depression. Shortly thereafter, a large, yet weak low-level circulation formed within the system. The system drifted erratically for several days as it slowly organized; the system underwent several cycles of developing and losing convection. On April 11, the system maintained a persistent area of well- organized deep convection, and subsequent to an increase in upper-level outflow, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Depression 02W at 1800 UTC on April 11. Strong influence from the monsoonal westerlies left the depression drifting and slowly executing a loop to the northwest. Based on sufficient satellite classifications, JTWC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Isa early on April 12 while it was located 105 km (65 mi) of Pohnpei. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) simultaneously classified the system as a tropical depression, and upgraded it to a tropical storm early on April 13. With the subtropical ridge to its north, Isa tracked to the north and gradually curved to the west. It slowly intensified, due to it being a large tropical cyclone, and late on April 13 JTWC upgraded the storm to typhoon status; at the same time, JMA continued to assess Isa as a minimal tropical storm, and did not upgrade it to a typhoon until April 16. Isa maintained a nearly due-westward movement, although tropical cyclone prediction models anticipated a quick turn to the north. The JTWC recognized the northward model bias, which was described as under- analyzing the strength of the subtropical ridge. By April 16, the typhoon attained the equivalence of a Category 3 tropical cyclone on the Saffir- Simpson Hurricane Scale, and despite a potential threat to Guam the typhoon remained 260 km (160 mi) south of the island. It gradually curved to the north, and on April 20 JTWC classified Super Typhoon Isa as reaching peak 1-min winds of 270 km/h (165 mph). At this point, Isa became an annular typhoon, with a large eye and a lack of spiralform rainbands, while moving nearly due northward, through a weakness in the subtropical ridge. Simultaneously, JMA assessed the typhoon as attaining peak 10-min winds of 155 km/h (100 mph). Shortly after peaking in intensity, Isa began to weaken, and by April 21 it dropped below \\"super typhoon\\" status. It accelerated to the northeast under the flow of the mid-latitudes, and the typhoon weakened more rapidly; JMA downgraded Isa to a tropical storm on April 22, which was followed suit by the JTWC the next day as upper-level wind shear increased. At 0600 UTC on April 23, the JTWC issued the last advisory on the system, and the next day JMA classified Isa dissipated as it became absorbed by a cloud band from a large extratropical cyclone to the east of Japan. Impact Typhoon Isa visible from Guam NEXRAD Isa first affected Pohnpei as a tropical storm on April 12. While passing near the island, the storm produced moderate winds across the island, peaking at 95 km/h (60 mph). The winds downed several trees and tree limbs which destroyed 40% of the island's power lines. A few buildings reported roof damage. About 15% of the crops on Pohnpei were damaged, including losses to the banana and breadfruit crops. After the passage of the typhoon, President of the Federated States of Micronesia Jacob Nena declared Pohnpei as a major disaster area due to the damage from Typhoon Isa and subsequent flooding; on April 20 heavy rainfall caused widespread mudslides and 19 fatalities on the island, though they were not related to Isa. In Guam, the threat of Typhoon Isa postponed a flight from Guam to Honolulu, Hawaii for 48 hours. The flight was the last in , which was a multimillion-dollar humanitarian effort to transport more than 6,600 Kurds in a political asylum to the mainland of the United States. The threat of the typhoon also canceled the first round of the Omega Tour golf event, which was the second professional golf tournament in the island's history. Though Typhoon Isa passed well to the south of Guam, one of its outer rainbands stalled across the island, which dropped heavy rainfall of 15–25 cm (6–10 in) across the island. The rainfall was welcome as it occurred during the dry season, and largely contributed to rainfall at the Guam International Airport being 45% above normal from the period between January through April. The rainband also produced wind gusts that reached 86 km/h (53 mph) at the island's Naval Air Station; the winds resulted in sporadic power outages across the island. The typhoon caused some light damage to buildings, particularly on the south side of the island. The combination of winds and sea salt caused damage to the island's tomato, okra, cucumber, and soy bean crops. Typhoon Isa later dropped light rainfall on the island of Rota. Across its path, damage from the storm totaled over $1 million (1997 USD, $ USD). No deaths or injuries were reported.

The cemetery formerly known as Cementerio del Norte was laid out in 1904.Vintage Philippines. December 2, 2010. \\"Manila North Cemetery: A Time Capsule of Philippine History \\". During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in World War II the cemetery became the site of atrocities, with accounts that Imperial Japanese forces led by General Tomoyuki Yamashita brutally killing more than 2,000 unarmed noncombatants in the cemetery from October to November 1944. The cemetery being one of the oldest cemeteries in the metropolis is evident on the different designs of mausoleums that reflect the prevailing architectural style in the Philippines during the period they were constructed. The styles range from simple, plain- painted with a patch of greenery, to very complex designs that contain reliefs that are difficult to carve while also having different colors. Informal settlement Many people already live inside the cemetery with some of them serving as caretakers of the mausoleums where they also stay to survive. When the families or owners of the mausoleums come, especially during and after All Soul's Day, the families transfer to other places. In addition, the informal settlers often serve as informal tour guides, bringing visitors to tombs of famous people and discussing the oral history of the area. Others take advantage of the quantity of visitors during the Allhallowtide holiday, setting up stalls to sell drinks and snacks, and providing visitors other services like renting out their toilets.Sauler, Erik.

Similar customs are thought to have been practiced by the Mongols,, see Mongolian Shaman Zorigtbaatar Banzar Incas; Caciques; Abyssinians; Tur’comans; Hungarians; and the ancient Lycians. Examples of the use of feathers related to hunting can be found in the cultures of highland peoples in Scotland and Wales where it is still customary for the hunter who kills the first woodcock to pluck out a feather and stick it in his cap. Other examples of feathers in caps which appear to be related to hunters and warriors can be found in mythological stories of historical figures such as the Austrian bailiff of Altdorf, Albrecht Gessler an aggressor who made Swiss national hero William Tell shoot an apple from the head of his son.

These airships were used for the strategic bombing of Great Britain by Germany. It was the first attack in history by aircraft launched from an aircraft carrier. On 19 July 1918 seven Sopwith Camels took off from the converted battlecruiser Furious. For the loss of one man, the British destroyed two German zeppelins, L 54 and L 60, and a captive balloon. Background In March 1918 the battlecuiser Furious joined the Grand Fleet at Scapa Flow, flying the flag of the Rear-Admiral Commanding Aircraft, R. F. Phillimore. Furious had initially been converted for use as an aircraft carrier during her construction, with a flight deck forward of her main superstructure, and during 1917 had been equipped with the Sopwith Camel 2F.1a navalised variant of the Sopwith Camel. These partially replaced the Sopwith 1½ Strutter. In late 1917 a second flight deck was fitted aft (landing on which proved \\"almost as hazardous as ditching in the sea.\\") Until such need arose however, she was dispatched on reconnaissance missions off the Heligoland Bight searching for minefields and looking for evidence of counter-mining by the Germans. An attack on the bases of the Imperial German Navy's Naval Airship Division was allegedly suggested to Rear-Admiral Phillimore by his Royal Air ForceOn 1 April 1918 the Royal Naval Air Service was amalgamated with the Royal Flying Corps to form the Royal Air Force. RNAS officers who had been part of the Navy hierarchy became members of the RAF. staff officer Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Clark-Hall and one of his pilots, Squadron Commander Richard Bell-Davies, VC. Clark-Hall received Phillimore's approval and the Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Fleet David Beatty's permission. Operation F.6 It was originally planned to use Sopwith 1½ Strutters in an attack, but these were too valuable for reconnaissance purposes and Sopwith Camels were substituted, whose range limitations meant an attack on the airship base at Tønder. The initial attack on Tønder, named Operation F.6 called for two waves of four aircraft, each pilot receiving special training. One of the pilots, Major Moore, was posted away before the operation's scheduled date of 29 June 1918, by which time it was too late to train a replacement. Training consisted of bombing runs on the airfield at Turnhouse, where the outlines of Tondern's three airship sheds were marked out. The pilots were Captains W. D. Jackson, W. F. Dickson, Bernard A. Smart and T. K. Thyne, and Lieutenants N. E. Williams, S. Dawson and W. A. Yeulett. On 27 June Furious put to sea from Rosyth, escorted by the First Light Cruiser Squadron and eight destroyers from the 13th Flotilla. On 29 June the ships reached the flying off point but with Force 6 winds prevailing flying was deemed impossible and the operation was called off. Operation F.7 The mission was attempted again, renamed Operation F.7, and Furious went to sea at 12:03 on 17 July. This time she was escorted by \\"Force B\\", including a division of the First Battle Squadron (all the new Revenge- class battleships), the Seventh Light Cruiser Squadron and a destroyer screen. HMS Resolutions' \\"Y\\" turret guns had been loaded with a special shrapnel shell for use against airships. During the passage the destroyer Valentine investigated a reported submarine contact, but nothing else untoward occurred. At 03:04 in the morning of 18 July Furious was ready to fly off her Camels when a thunderstorm struck. Rather than cancel the operation, it was decided to delay it twenty-four hours and Furious and her destroyer screen fell back on Force B. The combined squadron cruised out of sight off the Danish coast until the morning of 19 July, and in worsening weather conditions Furious flew off her Camels between 03:13 and 03:21. The first flight consisted of Jackson, Dickson and Williams; the second of Smart, Dawson, Yeulett and Thyne. Thyne was forced to turn around with engine trouble before reaching the target and ditched his aircraft before being recovered.Despite Furious having a landing deck aft, returning aircraft were expected to ditch in the sea, and the pilot would be rescued by a destroyer, and the plane recovered if possible. The first three aircraft arrived over Tondern at 04:35, taking the base by surprise. There were three airship sheds, codenamed by the Germans as \\"Toska\\", \\"Tobias\\" and \\"Toni\\". Toska, the largest one, was a double shed and housed the airships L.54 and L.60. Tobias contained a captive balloon and Toni was in the process of being dismantled. The first wave of aircraft focussed on Toska and three bombs hit the shed and detonated the gas bags of L.54 and L.60, destroying them by fire but not causing them to explode and destroy the shed. Another bomb from the first wave hit Tobias shed and damaged the balloon. The second wave destroyed the captive balloon afire and scored a number of near misses on a wagon loaded with hydrogen cylinders. Despite the loss of the two airships the Germans suffered only four men injured. During the attack ground fire was directed at both waves but the only damage was an undercarriage wheel shot off a Camel from the second wave. Williams, Jackson and Dawson, in the belief that they had insufficient fuel to reach the British squadron offshore, headed for Denmark and landed there. Dickson, Yuelett and Smart flew to sea to find the British ships. Dickson ditched at 05:55 and Smart, having suffered engine trouble, at 06:30. Yeulett was not heard from again and presumed drowned, and it was supposed that he had been forced to ditch prematurely through fuel exhaustion. The British squadron waited for the other pilots until the allotted time period for the Camels' fuel capacity had run-out, then after 07:00 the ships took cruising formation and made for home. Aftermath Wreckage of two Zeppelins LZ 99 (L 54) and LZ 108 (L 60) in their hangars The German Naval Airship Division quickly had the double hangar Toska repaired, but Tondern was abandoned as an active base, and ordered to be used only as an emergency landing site. Defences at the other bases were improved and at Nordholz a swathe of the countryside near the local airbase was burned off so as to prevent it being set alight by enemy bombs. The British conducted no other carrier raids during the war but other raids were being planned. From 1917 onwards a raid on the German High Seas Fleet was being mounted using the new torpedo-carrying Sopwith Cuckoo. The Cuckoo was not available in sufficient numbers until early 1919 and the project was still-born. The concept was revived during the Second World War and eventually resulted in the successful raid on the Italian port of Taranto in 1940. Of the British pilots Dickson and Yeulett were awarded the DSO, whilst Smart received the bar to his previously awarded DSO. Yeulett's body was later recovered from the sea.Flightglobal/Archive – Aviation History – 1918 NotesReferences ;Bibliography  External links * \\"The Raid on Tondern: July 19th, 1918\\" Accessed 2008-03-08 * \\"King George Visits the Mystery Ship; Goes Aboard Airplane Carrier Which Figured in Raid on Zeppelin Hangars.\\" New York Times 1918-07-25 Category:Military operations of World War I involving the United Kingdom Category:Military operations of World War I involving Germany Category:Royal Navy Category:History of the Royal Air Force during World War I Category:Aerial operations and battles of World War I Category:1918 in Germany Category:July 1918 events ","title":"Tondern raid"},{"id":"10885525","text":"Dr. Richard \\"Rick\\" J.

Gamboa's career ran from 1955 to 1974 in which time he played for Atlético Nacional, Millonarios, Independiente Santa Fe, Once Caldas, and Deportes Tolima, \\"Maravilla\\" translates directly to \\"wonder\\". In the beginning Born in Buenaventura (Valle del Cauca), Colombia, Delio Gamboa signed with Atlético Nacional in 1958, after getting noticed playing in a \\"aficionado\\" national league. A year later, Gamboa was transferred to a football club named CD Oro based out of Mexico. He was considered to be their most important player for two straight seasons. He led Oro to be runners-up of the Mexican Domestic league in his first season with the club. Time with Colombian National Team Delio took part in the 1961 Colombian National Squad which qualified for the following years FIFA World Cup. At the 1962 FIFA World Cup an injury limited Gamboa to just one appearance at said World Cup. \\"Maravilla\\" Upon his arrival in Colombia to play in the 1961 qualifiers Delio joined Millonarios. He went on to play for Millonarios from 1961–1965. He won the Colombian Domestic League (now the Liga Águila) title four straight seasons (1961, 1962, 1963 and 1964). Delio had been given his nickname \\"Maravilla\\" when still an amateur, as number 10 (inside-left was the position called then) on the Valle del Cauca selección, which outclassed all other State teams and garnered the Colombian championship, stunning the spectators with his play which people thought nothing short of miraculous and Gamboa \\"a wonder\\" in the flesh. He briefly revived the nickname which Millonarios sides earned in the DiStefano-Pedernera era, \\"El Ballet Azul\\" (\\"The Blue Ballet\\") for its elegant and artistic style of play.  Copa Libertadores with \\"Millos\\"  In the 1962 Edition \\"Maravilla\\" and \\"Los Embajadores\\" translating to \\"The Ambassadors\\" saw an early first round exit. In 1963 they were matched up with continental football giants of that era in Garrincha's Botafogo and Alianza de Lima from Peru. They faced no better fortunes as they again were eliminated. Despite being eliminated early \\"Maravilla\\" and \\"Millos\\" would come back and win the Domestic crown the following year. Though they had no title to show Millonarios led by Gamboa represented Colombia in the Copa Libertadores for four straight years and were thus nicknamed \\"Los Embajadores\\".  Stint at Santa Fe  Although then came the injuries, at the end of the 1965 campaign \\"Maravilla\\" was sold to Independiente Santa Fe. Nonetheless \\"Maravilla\\" went on to win the Domestic title with Santa Fe in 1966. Gamboa scored 33 goals in 76 matches for Santa Fe between 1966 and 1968.  Later Years  After the titles, \\"wonderful play\\" and the rash of injuries he spent the 1968–1970 seasons at Once Caldas and then transferred to Deportes Tolima for the 1971 and 1972 campaigns. \\"Maravilla\\"'s career finally came full circle when he returned to the club that quite possibly saw his best form, Millonarios, in 1973 and ended he professional playing career in 1974. He latter went on to be Head Coach for Deportes Tolima and then left to become the Director of Millonarios youth system. Delio \\"Maravilla\\" Gamboa's innate skill led many to consider him the best Colombian footballer of the 1960s. Real Madrid scouted him but apparently his lanky, slight build deterred the European Millonarios from signing him. He was also widely admired for overcoming the economic and social discrimination and barriers imposed at that time, as well as the discrimination and barriers he faced due to his skin's complexion, all of which were evident in Colombia in that era. Which may be just another reason why Delio Gamboa was considered a \\"Maravilla\\".

The original expression is generally attributed to the Roman poet Lucan (d. AD 65). It occurs for the first time in his work Bellum civile/Pharsalia. Lucan used the term to describe what he believed to be the outstanding characteristic of the Germanic tribe called the Teutones: a mad, merciless, berserk rage in battle.Lucanus, Pharsalia 1.255-256: vidimus - - cursumque furoris  Teutonici. The Teutons met with the armies of the Roman Republic in the Eastern Alps around 113 BC. The Romans, under the command of the Consul Gnaeus Papirius Carbo, tried to lure the tribe into a trap, but they underestimated their military potential and lost the Battle of Noreia. The Romans also lost the Battle of Arausio (105 BC) and other lesser battles, before putting Gaius Marius in charge of their defence. The Teutons were ultimately defeated in 102 BC.

The episode, originally titled \\"Robin Sparkles\\", first aired on November 20, 2006; the title was changed in order to keep the episode's ending a secret. The episode received highly positive reviews and features in several lists of the best How I Met Your Mother episodes. The episode led to two recurring jokes and storylines in the show: \\"Robin Sparkles\\", Robin's teenage pop star career, and the Slap Bet, in which Marshall slaps Barney at various points throughout the series.  Plot  Ted, Marshall, Lily, and Barney find out that Robin never goes to malls and refuses to explain why. Marshall posits that Robin was married in a mall in Canada, because whenever asked about Canada, Robin only talks about her friend who got married way too young. Barney, however, believes that the secret is related to pornography. They agree to a slap bet, where the winner of the bet slaps the loser as hard as he can, and appoint Lily as the slap bet commissioner. Barney then starts working his way through hours of Canadian porn, which he finds both depressing and tedious. Ted begins to worry that Robin is married. Ted pesters Robin to reveal if she really got married in Canada. After trying to avoid the issue, Robin tells Ted that she got married in a mall, after which her husband moved to Hong Kong without getting a divorce. Ted promises to keep it a secret but tells the gang after Lily begs him, so Marshall slaps Barney. To try and help Ted, law student Marshall searches a legal database and he reveals that there is no record of a marriage license for Robin in Canada. After asking her various questions about her wedding, Ted confronts Robin and she admits she is not married but finds out that Ted told Marshall her supposed secret. She is angry and tells him that she was testing him to see how long it would take him to tell the rest of the gang. She refuses to tell Ted the true reason she avoids malls. Marshall tells Lily that Robin is not married and Lily, as the slap bet commissioner, must allow Barney to slap Marshall three times (one for the lie, two for being premature). Barney reveals that he has uncovered a video of Robin and asks her if the name \\"Robin Sparkles\\" sounded familiar, which worries Robin. Ted tries to stop Barney from playing the video but Robin lets Barney play it. The beginning of the video shows Robin, dressed as a schoolgirl, seductively pleading with a teacher not to give her detention. Barney, supposedly for the sake of Robin's dignity, pauses the video and slaps Marshall. Robin is surprised to learn that the others think that it is porn, and plays the rest of the video: A 1980s-style bubblegum pop music video where a teenage Robin (referred to as \\"Robin Sparkles\\") sings \\"Let's Go to the Mall\\". Robin repeatedly sang the Canadian hit on a lengthy tour of malls around the country, causing her to develop a phobia of malls. Lily points out that Barney slapped Marshall without having won the bet and without the permission of the slap bet commissioner. Lily gives Barney a choice: He can be slapped ten times immediately, or five times at any moment Marshall chooses. Barney picks the five slaps. Robin tells Ted that she is glad Ted knows her secret now. They kiss and Marshall suddenly slaps Barney, proclaiming \\"That's one\\". The episode ends with the group, excluding Robin, dancing to her music video.  Production  The episode was originally titled \\"Robin Sparkles,\\" but the title was changed to \\"Slap Bet\\" in order to avoid giving away the ending. In reruns, CBS used the originally intended \\"Robin Sparkles\\" title. In syndication, this episode is titled \\"Slap Bet\\". The menu that Robin makes up when Ted questions her about her wedding was the actual menu at the wedding of writer Kourtney Kang, which took place two weeks prior to the writing of this episode. This is the first appearance of Robin's young bubblegum pop persona, Robin Sparkles. Sparkles appears onscreen again in the season 3 episode \\"Sandcastles in the Sand\\" (also the name of Sparkles' music video) and the season 6 episode \\"Glitter\\". Robin's later grunge persona, Robin Daggers, appears in the season 8 episode \\"P.S. I Love You\\".  Critical response  \\"Slap Bet\\" is often included in lists of the best How I Met Your Mother episodes. Staci Krause of IGN gave the episode 8.9 out of 10, describing it as \\"hilarious\\" and \\"a good break from the progressive storyline the show usually boasts\\". Krause said the \\"scene- stealing moment\\" was when the characters realized the video of Robin was a music video and described the video as \\"a very tongue-in-cheek homage to 80s pop in America\\". Later, in IGN's list of the 10 best How I Met Your Mother episodes, \\"Slap Bet\\" was selected as the best episode, citing the episode's introduction of \\"one of the show's most notable and iconic recurring bits: the titular Slap Bet\\" and noting that \\"it gave rise to Robin's teen pop star alter ego\\". The music video was described as the \\"ultimate gift\\" to television. In 2010, Joyce Eng of TV Guide called the episode \\"possibly the show's finest half-hour\\" and said, \\"nothing will ever be or beat 'Slap Bet'\\". Miss Alli of Television Without Pity gave the episode an A+. In 2009, TV Guide ranked \\"Slap Bet\\" #62 on its list of the 100 Greatest Episodes. The episode appeared on Radio Times list of the top 10 episodes of the series. Josh Lasser of HitFix said \\"Slap Bet\\" was the best episode of the show in a list of the top 10 episodes. Digital Spy rated the episode fourth in its top 10 list. In 2012, Eric Eisenberg of Cinema Blend chose \\"Slap Bet\\" as the best episode of How I Met Your Mother. Eisenberg commented, \\"the highlight of \\"Slap Bet\\" is the use of misdirection\\", and described Robin's singing as \\"maddening and hilarious\\". He said the song was \\"one of the best TV-created pop songs of all time\\" and claimed the episode had \\"a wonderful impact on the show at large\\", explaining that \\"both major elements at play in \\"Slap Bet\\" have gone on to have effects seen in multiple episodes throughout the program\\". Business Insider noted that the episode received the second-best rating of any How I Met Your Mother episode on IMDb, surpassed only by the 9th season episode \\"How Your Mother Met Me\\". In 2018, TheRinger.com listed this episode at #52 in its list of the best 100 television episodes to have aired since 2000, and was the only episode of How I Met Your Mother to have made the list.

The prehistoric site was named \\"Bukit Kerang\\", meaning \\"hill of mollusk shells\\". The most significant part of it is a large shell mound, formed from a mass of mollusk shells. Prehistoric man of the Mesolithic era (dating from 5000–7000 years ago) lived by the shore of eastern Sumatra and mollusks were the easiest foodstuff that could be found. A pile of waste mollusk shells built up over time. There were also skulls, brainpans and bones which have been found inside the site. One of the skulls had teeth made of hematite.

History=Second World War At the outbreak of the Second World War, Croome Court and its surrounding estate was requisitioned by the Ministry of Works. The main palladian house was initially leased for a year to the Dutch Government as a possible refuge for Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands to escape the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands. However, evidence shows that they only stayed for two weeks at most, and later emigrated to Canada. Construction of RAF Defford was started at the outbreak of war, and completed in 1941. For a few months the airfield was used as a satellite station by the Vickers Wellington bombers of No. 23 Operational Training Unit RAF (OTU), based a few miles away at RAF Pershore. In May 1942, the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE), responsible for radar research and development, and located near Swanage, moved to Malvern College. At the same time the Telecommunications Flying Unit (TFU), later named the Radar Research Flying Unit (RRFU), which operated flight trials on behalf of the TRE, transferred its aircraft to Defford. So hurried was the move to Defford that many of the personnel had to be accommodated in tents at first. However, at Defford the tempo of work carried out by TFU increased month by month, and by 1945 there were approximately 2,500 personnel and 100 aircraft on the station. Civilian scientists, flying from Defford with aircrews drawn from the Royal Air Force and Royal Navy, tested radar systems which were to revolutionise the operational capability of Allied aircraft. Early successes with Airborne Interception (AI) systems were demonstrated by John \\"Cats Eyes\\" Cunningham and other night fighter pilots. While Air to Surface Vessel (ASV) radar enabled the German U-boat menace to be effectively countered in 1943, and thus was critical to the success of the Battle of the Atlantic. By 1944, H2S radar was enabling accurate navigation and target identification to be achieved by Bomber Command crews, taking part in the strategic bombing offensive. No. 1001 Signals Unit RAF and the Special Installation Unit RAF were also here at some point. The Automatic Gun-Laying Turret (AGLT) Village Inn FN121 tail turret as fitted on a Lancaster test flown from RAF Defford. There were many other notable \\"firsts\\" demonstrated by TFU. A converted Wellington bomber was the forerunner of the modern AWACS aircraft. This was successfully used to detect fast moving German E-boats, and to control their interception by other aircraft. The world's first automatic approach and landing also took place at Defford in 1945, paving the way for today's airliners which are able to safely arrive at their destinations, whatever the weather. The world's first demonstration of an aircraft making a \\"hands off\\" automatic blind landing, using equipment the forerunner of modern ILS, was at Defford in January 1945.Daily Telegraph 30 April 2013 https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10025924/Flight-Lieutenant- Lennard-Barber.html Postwar use TFU remained at Defford after the war, and was renamed the Radar Research Flying Unit (RRFU) in 1953. However, the airfield at Defford was too small to allow the operation of the large \\"V\\" bombers on flight trials, and so RRFU moved to nearby RAF Pershore in 1957.ENTRUST funded restoration project Most of the technical and domestic sites at Defford were soon de-requisitioned, but the central part of the now disused airfield still houses the Satellite Communications facility operated by QinetiQ. The various dishes and aerials used can be seen from passing trains between Worcester and Cheltenham and from the M5 motorway near Strensham services. Current use The airfield site is now owned and used by the West Mercia Constabulary and many of the \\"golf balls\\" and other communications equipment have been removed. Some of the station buildings remain in other uses. A few are contained within the National Trust property of Croome, including part of the station’s medical facilities which now house the RAF Defford museum.RAF Defford museum Accidents and incidents The worst accident in the history of the unit happened on when Handley Page Halifax V9977 crashed on 7 June 1942 with the loss all eleven crew and scientists on board including Alan Blumlein. It had been testing the new H2S radar system that used the cavity magnetron valve developed by TRE. In 2002, exactly sixty years later, an RAF Defford Memorial was unveiled by Sir Bernard Lovell on the village green of Defford. It commemorates those who lost their lives in accidents while carrying out scientific research. It reads: :\\"Dedicated to the memory of those Royal Air Force Air Crew, Scientists, Engineers and Civilian Personnel who lost their lives in the furtherance of Radar Research while flying with The Telecommunications Flying Unit (TFU) later the Radar Research Flying Unit (RRFU) from RAF Defford 1941-1957 REQUIESCANT IN PACE\\" See also * Telecommunications Research Establishment * List of former Royal Air Force stations * MERLIN * Village Inn (codename) ReferencesExternal links * RAF Defford at the National Trust Category:History of telecommunications in the United Kingdom Category:Military units and formations established in 1941 Category:Research institutes in Worcestershire Category:Royal Air Force stations in Worcestershire Category:Royal Air Force stations of World War II in the United Kingdom ","title":"RAF Defford"},{"id":"10885842","text":"The Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) sets and enforces standards in physician continuing education (or 'lifelong learning') within the United States.

Born in North Ormesby, Middlesbrough, Yorkshire, England, Smurthwaite was a fast-medium swing bowler, who could also bowl medium-pace off-breaks. He was a successful bowler for Guisborough in the North Yorkshire and South Durham League before appearing for Yorkshire. In his first first- class match, in 1938, Yorkshire declared and won by an innings, and Smurthwaite neither batted nor bowled; it was his only County Championship match of the season. He is most noted for a spell against Derbyshire at Bramall Lane in June 1939, when he and Frank Smailes routed Derbyshire for 20 on a rain-affected pitch. Smurthwaite took five wickets for seven runs, in only four eight-ball overs. This was not the start of a famous career, however, and he was omitted from the team for the next match to make way for Yorkshire's returning Test players. He went back to the Yorkshire Second XI in the Minor Counties Cricket Championship, for whom he took 36 wickets at 12.94 that year. His hopes of further first-class cricket were dashed by the onset of World War II and the loss of the tip of a finger on his bowling hand. He played as a professional in the North Yorkshire and South Durham League for many years after the war. In all first-class games, Smurthwaite scored 29 runs, with a best of 20 not out against Worcestershire, and took 12 wickets at 19.75. He worked as an engineer with ICI, and lived with his wife Lynn in their home in Hutton Lane, Guisborough. He died in October 1989 in North Ormesby.

The period of revival was a significant influence on the modern charismatic movement.  Evangelists  The period of revivals was described by Christian writer John Crowder as \\"the most extensive public display of miraculous power in modern history.\\" Some, like critic and radio personality Hank Hanegraaff, rejected the entire healing revival as a hoax, and condemned the subsequent evangelical and charismatic movements as a cult. Divine healing is a tradition and belief that became increasingly associated with Evangelical Protestantism. The majority of American Christianity's fascination with divine healing played a significant role in the popularity and inter-denominational nature of the revival movement. Oral Roberts and William Branham are described by historian David Edwin Harrell as the two giants of the movement. William Branham, who died in a 1965 car accident, is widely regarded as the initiator and the pacesetter of the revival, and described by Harrell as the movement's \\"unlikely leader.\\"Harrell, D. E., All Things Are Possible: The Healing and Charismatic Revivals in Modern America, Indiana University Press, 1978 p. 25.Weaver, C. D., The Healer-Prophet: William Marrion Branham (A Study of the Prophetic in American Pentecostalism), Mercer University Press, 2000, p. 139. Roberts emerged as the most popular figure and left the most lasting legacy, including the university bearing his name. Referring to Branham’s first series of meetings in St Louis’ in June 1946, Krapohl & Lippy have commented: \\"Historians generally mark this turn in Branham’s ministry as inaugurating the modern healing revival\\".Krapohl, R. H., & Lippy, C. H., The Evangelicals: A Historical, Thematic, and Biographical Guide, Greenwood Press, 1999, p. 69. Branham was the source of inspiration for T. L. Osborn's worldwide crusade ministry and dozens of other smaller ministries involved in the healing revival.Dictionary of Pentecostal and Charismatic Movements (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 1988) p. 372. Other major figures of the revival were Jack Coe and later A. A. Allen. Many of these ministries shared their healing testimonies in The Voice of Healing, a periodical published by Gordon Lindsay, which created cohesion for the group in its nascent years. Branham Campaign meeting in Tacoma, Washington, April 1948  1956 peak  In 1956, the healing revival reached its peak number of evangelists holding campaigns, as 49 separate evangelists held major meetings. By 1960 the number of evangelists holding national campaigns dropped to less than a dozen. Several perspectives have been offered regarding the decline of the healing revival. Crowder suggests that Branham's gradual separation from Gordon Lindsay played a major part in the decline. Harrell attributed the decline to the increasing number of evangelists crowding the field and straining the financial resources of the Pentecostal denominations. Weaver similarly agreed that Pentecostal churches gradually withdrew their support of the healing revivals primarily over the financial stresses put on local churches by the healing campaigns. The Assemblies of God led the way, being the first to openly withdraw from the healing revival in 1953. Weaver pointed to other factors which may have played a role in destroying the initial ecumenism of the revival: tension between the independent evangelists and the Pentecostal churches caused by the evangelists' fund-raising methods; denominational pride; sensationalism; and doctrinal conflicts, particularly between the Oneness and Trinitarian factions within Pentecostalism. April 1948 cover of Voice of Healing magazine  Results  A result of these major healing ministries of the post-War era was a renewed belief and emphasis in divine healing among many Christians, and this was a part of the broader Charismatic Movement, a movement which today numbers about 500 million worldwide.Hollenweger, W.

Built by wealthy banker James F. D. Lanier in 1844, the house was declared a State Memorial in 1926, and remains an important landmark in Madison to the present day. History James Franklin Doughty Lanier was one of Madison's pioneers moving to the city in 1817 where he later practiced law. In the 1830s, he turned to banking and finance becoming the president of the Madison Branch of the State Bank of Indiana and a major investor in Indiana's first railroad. With his financial success, Lanier commissioned in 1840 prominent local architect Francis Costigan to design and build a residence for the sum of $25,000. Costigan designed the mansion in the Greek Revival style, popular in the mid 19th- century, drawing from the pattern books of New York architect Minard Lafever. Construction of the house used materials that were manufactured nearby, or on the premises, including the brick, limestone and timber, largely tulip poplar, that was plentiful in the area. and The mansion was completed and occupied in 1844. Lanier only lived at the property for seven years before moving to New York City where he helped start the investment firm Winslow, Lanier & Co. In 1861, his son Alexander was given the deed to the mansion and moved into the house. Alexander Lanier modernized the house by adding amenities such as a coal furnace, gas lighting, a toilet and bath tubs. Alexander also developed large, elaborate gardens containing two greenhouses that employed several professional gardeners. The mansion would remain within the Lanier family until 1917, when James' youngest son Charles donated the site to the Jefferson County Historical Society. In 1925, the society, with the family's blessing, gave control of it to the state, which promptly opened it publicly as a historic house museum. Since the 1990s, archaeologists and historians have worked at the site with much of the research funded by The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America and other grants. Their work has helped with the ongoing restoration of the mansion to its appearance in 1844. Archaeologists have discovered the locations of the former dog kennels, poultry house, greenhouses, cisterns, the original Lanier home (which faced Elm Street) and the carriage house, of which, was reconstructed in 2003 on the original foundation. Mansion and grounds=Architecture The Lanier mansion is sited on the sloping banks of the Ohio River with views of the hills of Kentucky across the river. Built in the Greek Revival style, the layout of the main block of the house is a near perfect square of approximately by , with a service wing projecting from the east side that extends the facade by . The house encompasses approximately , with just under of livable space. River front of mansionThere is no distinct entrance facade, as the house has a city front and a river front, with the latter being the most ornate. Built on a raised blue limestone foundation, the house is built of brick, painted a yellow ochre and trimmed in white. The southern river front features a two- story portico that extends the length of the facade, enclosed with ornate iron railings, and supported by four 30-foot fluted wooden columns with carved Corinthian capitals. The capitals, designed in a motif of rosettes and scrolled acanthus leaves, support an essentially Ionic entablature of architrave and frieze, pierced by three circular windows framed by a ring of leaves, separated by a projecting fillet and a simply molded denticulated cornice. A plain wooden parapet showcasing a decorative scroll ornament encompasses the low-hipped gabled roof that is crowned by an octagonal shaped cupola. The cupola has a wide eave overhang and is adorned with leaf-and- scroll decorative brackets and a string of dentils. Each side is embellished with a recessed diamond panel with a five-pointed star in the center. The exterior of the three bay facade features four Ionic engaged columns that correspond with the fluted columns of the portico. These engaged columns continue to encircle all but the east wing of the house. The center bay features a recessed paneled doorway with full length side lights, and framed with a classical surround of pilasters supporting a molded entablature. Above is a tripartite window with a plain surround. Flanking the central bay are full length six-over-nine double-hung sash windows, framed by wooden pilasters, stone sills, and a frieze ornamented with carved wooden rosettes and a scrolled fan-and-leaf motif on the first level; while the second level has six-over-six double-hung sash windows, and are framed in a similar manner as below. Due to the sloping nature of the site, the raised foundation is not as pronounced on the northern, city front elevation as opposed to the southern facade. The city front elevation mimics the southern front in regards to window, door placement and trim, but instead of an ornate two-story portico there is only a central one-story portico supported by a pair of fluted Corinthian columns, and plain squared pilasters that surrounds the entrance, flanked by wrought iron balconies under the respective lower windows. The eastern service wing is also 3 bays wide, asymmetrically arranged with two six-over-six double-hung sash windows and a paneled service entrance to the right. The wing continues the Ionic entablature of architrave and frieze that is pierced by three small rectangular windows. On the southern front, the service wing features two six-over-six double-hung sash windows. Interior Lanier Mansion dining room The interior of the mansion features a center-hall floorplan, with a wide formal entrance hall running north to south, with two rooms on each side of the hall. On the first floor there are double parlors to the west, and on the east are the dining room and library. The adjacent parlors are largely furnished as one, with twin black marble fireplaces, gilded mantel mirrors and chandeliers that hang from the high ceilings. The wide doorway, that can be closed off as needed, between the two rooms is ornately trimmed with fluted Ionic columns and an entablature with egg-and-dart molding. The same egg-and-dart molding can be found articulating the ceiling as well. An unusual feature found in both parlors, as a result of the mansion being built in the strict accordance to Greek Revival style of architecture, are the pair of doors found on the east side of the rooms. One of the doors opens only into a wall; this was necessary so that the entrance door from the hall would have a match. The library with its highly stylized decorative ceiling done in gold leaf, deep red and blue, is separated from the dining room by a passageway that leads to the service wing. The dining room features a botanical wallpaper from the French manufacturer Zuber, that uses a technique called British Transfer, where each color in the pattern is separately stamped onto the paper. The chandelier is adorned with Bacchus, the Greek god of wine. The service wing is divided into two nearly square rooms: the service room and kitchen. The upper stories are accessed by a self- supporting staircase, trimmed with a Greek key design, found at the midpoint of the entrance hall that corkscrews up to the cupola. The cupola provides natural light to the center of the house via a skylight. The second floor plan of the main block of the house, corresponds to the layout of the lower level, with bedrooms in the four corners. However, two small rooms are found at each end of the central hall, a study on the north end, and a nursery on the south that connects to the bedroom in the southeast corner. The private quarters of the family are less ornate than the main level, and the ceiling height decreases to . The servants wing houses an additional bedroom and bath, a servant's bedroom, and a stairway to the first level. The third floor, plainly decorated and with ceilings just over , housed smaller children, additional servants quarters and storage space. Grounds The Lower Terrace The Lanier Mansion sits on a large rectangular lot encompassing within the city of Madison. Bounded by West 2nd Street on the north, West Vaughan Street on the south and Elm and Vine Street on the east and west. The grounds and gardens of the mansion were developed by Alexander Lanier, the son of J.F.D. Lanier, and included the construction of several stately greenhouses in the late 19th- century. Unfortunately time and neglect caused the landscape to be abandoned and totally erased once flooding deposited silt a foot deep. Today, the historical recreation of the gardens are based on an 1876 lithograph of the site. The modern landscape consists of four areas: Craven Square, the Upper Terrace, the Lower Terrace and Pasture. Craven Square located opposite the northern elevation of the house was not originally part of the grounds, as the land was donated to the site in 1944. The city closed the portion of First Street directly in front of the house, so the grounds continue uninterrupted for a city block. Craven Square features curving brick walkways and a lush landscape of flowering trees, shrubs and annuals. The Upper Terrace has a walled sunken garden constructed in 1928, while the Lower Terrace directly in front of the south elevation of the house features the recreated formal gardens of geometric parterres enclosed by hedges of boxwood and gravel paths. Beyond the formal gardens is the pasture with views of the Ohio River.

Teams played each other in a home-and-away season of 22 rounds; matches 12 to 22 were the \\"home-and- way reverse\\" of matches 1 to 11 (except that rounds 14 and 15 were the reverse of 4 and 3 respectively). Once the 22 round home-and-away season had finished, the 1976 VFL Premiers were determined by the specific format and conventions of the \\"McIntyre Final Five system\\".

The company is majority owned by Total and is publicly traded on the NASDAQ as SPWR. History The initial technology and ideas that led to the creation of SunPower started from solar power research projects in the lab of Richard Swanson, a professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University. On April 24, 1985, EOS Electric Power was officially incorporated by co-founders, Richard Swanson and Richard (Dick) Crane, an engineer in Swanson's lab. Robert Lorenzini later joined and the company's name was changed to SunPower in 1988. The original plan was to develop and market solar concentrator systems and the next couple years were spent securing funding. In August 1990 the company received a research and development contract from EPRI and the US Dept. of Energy. Along with the financial support from two venture capital firms, SunPower now had the funding to begin manufacturing. Two years later, SunPower began shipping concentrator cells to customers. In 1993 SunPower's back-side contact solar cells powered Honda's Dream solar car to victory in the annual Darwin to Adelaide race across Australia (World Solar Challenge) beating the second-place winner by one full day. In 2001, the company's solar cells were solely used on the NASA Helios high altitude aircraft which set an altitude record of , a world record for sustained horizontal flight by a winged aircraft. In 2002, Cypress Semiconductor invested $8 million in SunPower. The following year Tom Werner joined as CEO. In 2004, SunPower opened manufacturing facilities in the Philippines and Bavaria. The company held an IPO in 2005. In January 2007, SunPower acquired PowerLight Corporation, a large-scale solar power systems company. In February 2010, it acquired Europe's SunRay Renewable Energy for $277 million. In April 2011, Total S.A. agreed to buy 60% of SunPower for US$1.38 billion. In December 2011, the company announced an agreement to acquire Tenesol SA. In 2013 SunPower acquired Greenbotics, Inc., maker of robotic solar panel cleaning products and services for large-scale solar power plants. In April 2018, SunPower announced it would acquire SolarWorld Americas to expand domestic manufacturing capabilities. The sale was concluded in October 2018, and the company took over SolarWorld's large manufacturing facility in Hillsboro, Oregon, the same month. In March 2019, SunPower announced it would buy out membership interests in a number of leaseback holding companies with a number of financial organizations, including Wells Fargo Bank, PNC Bank, MetLife, Regions Bank and SunTrust. In November 2019, SunPower announced that it will split into two publicly traded companies, separating its solar panel manufacturing operations from storage and energy services. The new solar panel company will be named Maxeon Solar Technologies. The French oil group Total has increased its stake in SunPower by acquiring an additional 676,000 shares from the American solar panel producer, according to a regulatory document filed with the SEC, the gendarme of the American stock exchange. Total acquired these shares between February 13 and 14 at a price between $8.27 and $8.90 per share, according to the statement. In addition, SunPower entered into an agreement with Total's solar energy subsidiary, Total Solar, to repurchase $56.4 million of its bonds due 2021. SunPower stock jumped 13.5% at the end of the session on Wall Street to $10.5. Total, which entered Sunpower's capital in 2011 to expand into renewable energies, holds directly with its subsidiaries more than 82 million shares of the company, according to the SEC document. Including the convertible bonds, Total holds more than 90.6 million SunPower shares with its subsidiaries, or 51.25% of the share capital.https://tecsol.blogs.com/mon_weblog/2020/02/total-se-renforce-dans-le- capital-de-sunpower.html Cells The company's main product is a high- efficiency solar cell, trademarked \\"Maxeon\\", the same size and shape as conventional 6-inch/160 mm single-crystal silicon cells, packaged into conventional 60-cell solar panels. The cells have a conversion efficiency of 25.2%, and each panel produces up to 360 W; typical conventional panels produce up to 250 to 270 W.http://us.sunpower.com/solar-panels- technology/x-series-solar-panels/ Silicon solar cells typically consist of a thin layer of silicon chemically treated to produce an electrically active layer near the front that produces electricity when the sun shines on it. Collecting that energy is normally handled via a series of very fine wires embedded on the front. There is an inherent paradox in the wiring design; larger wires lower electrical resistance and improve energy collection but reflect light that would otherwise reach the cell and improve energy creation. The wires are normally made of silver for a variety of reasons, although less expensive copper and aluminum wiring has been attempted with no great market success. The circuit is completed by a thin layer of aluminum that is deposited on the back of the cell. The Maxeon design starts with the same basic silicon cell, but changes the electrical connections. The silver wiring on the front is eliminated and both the positive and negative electrode fingers are deposited on the back of the cell, eliminating light blockage.https://web.archive.org/web/20190325012626/https://us.sunpower.com/sites/default/files/sp- gen2-solar-cell-ds-en-a4-160-506760e.pdf The back of the cell replaces the thin aluminum layer with a thicker copper one, which both improves electrical performance as well as offering a much more physically robust platform while eliminating corrosion that occurs in the aluminum over time. On June 23, 2010, The company announced that it has produced a full-scale solar cell with a sunlight to electricity conversion efficiency of 24.2 percent, a world record confirmed by the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL). However, EnergySage only rates SunPower photovoltaic cells as 22.2% efficiency at maxium, at the top of an 'efficiency range' of 16% to 22.2% - though at the top of its list of the best five solar cell production companies in America.What are the best solar panels on the market? Complete panel ranking table. EnergySage. Accessed March 3, 2019. After the cells are constructed, conventional assembly system uses a robot to place the cells into a grid of 6 columns of 10 cells - other arrangements are used, but rare outside commercial settings. As they are placed, wiring consisting of a strip of silver is woven between the cells and soldered to the connectors on the front and back. A small amount of space is required between the cells to allow the strips to pass over and under the cells. The layout takes place on top of a plastic sheet known as the backsheet, and the cells and wiring are glued to the sheet as the assembly advances. When the glue dries, the resulting laminate is ready for assembly into a panel, which consists of gluing the cell side of the laminate to a glass sheet, adding a junction box for electrical connections, and adding an aluminum frame around the outside for mechanical robustness. Different assembly systems may use different steps, but the end result is a glass sheet on top, cells and wiring in the middle, and the backsheet on the back. The company's panels are similar in concept and layout, but include a number of additional changes to further improve the system. Instead of using silver strips to connect the cells together, which is no longer needed due to the lack of silver on the cells, its panels use a robust edge-connector that includes a built-in strain relief to reduce mechanical stress. According to the company, these changes eliminate 85% of the failures in conventional designs, which is due primarily to corrosion and electrical breaks. Only 14% of failures are due to cell or component failures. The downside to these design changes is cost; both the materials and construction methods are more expensive and thereby drive up the price of the panels. However, the price of the panel is not the only input to a solar power system's total cost, and in recent years it accounts for much less than half of the total. In this case, using a more expensive panel can actually produce a lower overall system cost if savings can be found in installation time or there are artificial limits on system size. These are both true in the case of residential installs, where the roof defines the total size of the system that can be installed, and the cost of labor is the largest single cost of the system. Simply replacing conventional panels with SunPower panels will increase the total power of the system as much as 25% without having any effect on install times, in which case the total install cost in terms of price per watt can improve in spite of higher prices on the panels.  Development in stock exchange  The company's shares have been listed on the Photovoltaik Global 30 Index since the beginning of this stock index in 2009.

The 149th is equipped with the F-16C/D Fighting Falcon. History=World War II Established in mid-1943 as a P-47 Thunderbolt fighter squadron, trained under I Fighter Command on Long Island and Massachusetts. Moved to England, arriving in January 1944. Began operations with IX Fighter Command on 14 March and flew a fighter sweep over the English Channel coast of France. Made strafing and bombing attacks on airfields, rail and highway bridges, trains, vehicles, anti-aircraft gun positions, and V-weapon sites to help prepare for the invasion of France. Supported the landings in Normandy early in June 1944 and began operations from the Continent later the same month. Aided in the taking of Cherbourg, participated in the air operations that prepared the way for the Allied breakthrough at St Lo on 25 July, and supported ground forces during their drive across France. Continued to support ground forces, participated in the assault against the Siegfried Line, and took part in the Battle of the Bulge (December 1944 – January 1945) by attacking rail lines and trains, marshalling yards, roads and vehicles, armored columns, and gun positions. Operated with the Allied forces that pushed across the Rhine and into Germany. After V-E Day, served with the army of occupation, being assigned to United States Air Forces in Europe. Inactivated in Germany on 20 August 1946. Texas Air National Guard The wartime 396th Fighter Squadron was re-designated as the 182d Fighter Squadron, and was allotted to the Texas Air National Guard, on 24 May 1946. It was organized at the Brooks Army Airfield and was extended federal recognition on 27 January 1947 by the National Guard Bureau. The 182d Fighter Squadron was bestowed the lineage, history, honors, and colors of the 396th Fighter Squadron. The squadron was assigned to the Texas Air National Guard 136th Fighter Group and was equipped with F-51D Mustangs. The mission of the squadron was the air defense of Texas. During the postwar years, the 182d primarily trained the Hill Country and west Texas; the 181st Fighter Squadron, based at Love Field, Dallas, covered the north Texas, and the 111th Fighter Squadron, based at Houston Municipal Airport, covered east and southeast Texas to the Mexican Border. =Korean War Activation= As a result of the Korean War, the Texas Air National Guard was federalized and placed on active-duty status on 10 October 1950, being assigned to Ninth Air Force, Tactical Air Command (TAC). TAC ordered the 136th Fighter Group to Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, where the unit was re-designated to a Fighter-Bomber unit, and its status was changed to a Wing. At Langley, the 136th Fighter-Bomber Wing consisted of the following units: * 111th Fighter-Bomber Squadron * 182d Fighter-Bomber Squadron * 154th Fighter-Bomber Squadron (Arkansas ANG). 136th FBW F-84E Thunderjet at Taegu Air Force Base (K-2), South Korea At Langley AFB, the 136th trained with their F-51D Mustangs. Unfortunately losing two 111th FBS pilots in a training accident on 15 December. A third pilot was killed on 27 January 1951 in another accident. In February 1951, the aged F-51Ds that the unit had been flying since its activation in 1947 were replaced by F-84E Thunderjets, and the squadron began transition training on the jet fighter-bomber. Most of the training took place at Langley, although some pilots were sent to Shaw AFB, South Carolina. Maintenance crews, all new to jet aircraft, were trained at Langley and engine specialists were sent to the Allison plant in Indianapolis. Assigned to the Arkansas ANG 154th FBS at the time was a Navy exchange pilot, future NASA astronaut Lieutenant Walter Schirra (who happened to be the only pilot assigned to the 136th at the time who was a qualified jet pilot). U.S. Air Force Captain John McMahn and Sergeant White of the 182nd Fighter-Bomber Squadron, Texas Air National Guard, close out flight records at Taegu Air Base, South Korea, following their Republic F-84E-15-RE Thunderjet (s/n 49-2360, nicknamed \\"Miss Jacque II\\") becoming the first such aircraft to complete 1,000 flying hours, 1952. Note the mission markers. In May 1951, less than seven months later, the wing was deployed to Japan, being attached to Far East Air Force and stationed at Itazuke Air Force Base, the first echelon of the 136th arriving on 18 May. The 136th replaced the Strategic Air Command 27th Fighter-Escort Wing, which had deployed to Far East Air Force in the early days of the Korean War. At Itazuke, the squadrons took over the F-84Es of the 27th FEW, which remained in place, its aircraft being reassigned from SAC to Far East Air Force inventory records. On 2 June, the final elements of the 136th arrived in Japan, the national guardsmen officially relieved the 27th Fighter Bomber Wing and the SAC airmen departed for the United States. The 136th was the first Air National Guard wing in history to enter combat. From Japan the wing engaged in combat operations over South Korea, however flying in the North Pacific area was a challenge to the wing, losing seven F-84Es in non-combat operations and three in combat. On 26 June, in one of the largest air-to-air battles in Korea, two 182d FBS pilots, Captain Harry Underwood and 1st Lt Arthur Olighter shot down an enemy MiG-15 that broke through an F-86 Sabre escort of four B-29s. Two other 111th FBS pilots, 1sts Lt John Morse and John Marlins scored probables in the same encounter. These were the first combat victories by Air National Guard pilots. On 3 July the 136th sent their aircraft to North Korea, attacking FLAK batteries in downtown Pyongyang while other aircraft attacked North Korean airfields. However, the short-legged F-84 had limited combat time over Korea, therefore on 16 November 1951 the wing moved to Taegu Air Force Base (K-2) in South Korea for its combat operations. In 1952, the 136th was re-equipped with the F-84G Thunderjet, designed for tactical close air support of ground forces. During its time in combat, the 136th flew 15,515 combat sorties; was credited with 4 enemy aircraft destroyed; 7 probables and 72 others damaged. It was the first ANG unit to down a MiG-15; it dropped 23,749 (7,120 tons) of bombs and expended over 3 million rounds of .50 caliber ammunition; being awarded Five Korean Campaign Ribbons. The 136th Fighter- Bomber Wing was released from active duty and returned to the United States on 10 July 1952 =Air Defense Command= 182d F-86L Sabre Interceptors, 1959 With the 182d's return from the Korean War, the squadron was re-equipped with the Very Long Range (VLR) F-51H Mustang, which had been developed to escort B-29 Superfortress bombers in the Pacific Theater from the Mariana Islands to the Japanese Home Islands. The F-51H would allow the squadron to intercept any unidentified aircraft over any part of Texas. The squadron became part of Air Defense Command (ADC) and resumed its postwar mission of Texas air defense. On 16 January 1955, four P-51s assigned to the 182d were sold to Costa Rica and sent immediately out of country to boost that small country's air arm in fighting a five-day old rebellion. The fighters were dispatched from Kelly AFB in a fully armed state. Fernando Fournier, the undersecretary of foreign affairs for Costa Rica, said it was his understanding that the Mustangs were sold for a dollar apiece.Associated Press, \\"Little Republic Buys Four P51s To Fight Rebels: OAS Approves Sale; Americans Ferrying Craft to San Jose\\", The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Monday 17 January 1955, Volume LXI, Number 119, page 1. It was not until August 1956 that the 182d received first-generation F-80C Shooting Star jets, replacing some of the last F-51H Mustangs in the USAF inventory. In 1957, the squadron was selected by the Air Defense Command to man a runway alert program on full 24-hour basis – with armed jet fighters ready to \\"scramble\\" at a moment's notice. This event brought the wing into the daily combat operational program of the USAF, placing them on \\"the end of the runway\\" alongside regular USAF-Air Defense Fighter Squadrons. The obsolescent F-80 day fighters were upgraded to the all- weather/day/night F-86D Sabre Interceptor by the end of the year. In June 1959 the squadron traded their F-86Ds for the upgraded F-86L Sabre Interceptor with uprated afterburning engines and new electronics. 182d Fighter Interceptor Squadron – Convair F-102A 57-839 In July 1960 the unit became one of the first to transition to the F-102A Delta Dagger Mach 1.2 all-weather interceptor and began a 24-hour alert to guard the Texas Gulf coast. The 182d enjoyed the distinction of being the first F-102 \\"Deuce\\" squadron in the Air National Guard. When flight operations ended at Brooks AFB in October 1960, the squadron was moved to nearby Kelly Air Force Base, beginning operations on 1 November 1960. In August 1961, as part of an Air Defense Command re- organization, the 182d Fighter Interceptor Squadron's assignment to 136th Air Defense Wing was terminated with 136th being transferred to Tactical Air Command. As a result, the 182d was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 149th Fighter-Interceptor Group was established by the National Guard Bureau. The 182d Fighter Interceptor Squadron became the group's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 149th Headquarters, 149th Material Squadron (Maintenance), 149th Combat Support Squadron, and the 149th USAF Dispensary. The 149th was directly assigned to the Texas Air National Guard, being operationally gained by the Air Defense Command 33d Air Division. As with many other ANG squadrons, the 182d temporally operated two TF-102 twin-seat trainers for ANG F-102 pilots while remaining on runway alert status. Also, the squadron operated T-33A Shooting Star jet trainers and a Convair VT-29 transport for courier duties. =Tactical Air Support= The famous \\"triple null\\" F-100D 56-3000, while assigned to the 182d TFS in the early 1970s. In 1968, the Air National Guard began to retire its F-102s and the 182d was ordered to send their aircraft to Davis-Monthan AFB for storage at AMARC. In July, as part of the drawdown of continental fighter air defense, the 149th FIG was transferred from Aerospace Defense Command to Tactical Air Command (TAC), with the Group and 182d being re-designated as a Tactical Fighter Group and Squadron. As an interim measure, the 182d Tactical Fighter Squadron was re-equipped with obsolescent F-84F Thunderjets by TAC. The squadron was the second-to-last ANG squadron to fly the F-84F. During the summer of 1971 the 182d began to receive F-100D/F Super Sabre tactical fighter bombers. The 182d was one of the first ANG squadrons to receive the Super Sabre, as most were being operated in South Vietnam at the time. The F-100s received by the squadron were aircraft being withdrawn from the 20th Tactical Fighter Wing at RAF Wethersfield and the 48th TFW at RAF Lakenheath, England. RAF Wethersfield was being closed for flight operations and the 20th TFW being re-equipped with the new General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark at their new base, RAF Upper Heyford. The 48th TFW – a permanent resident at RAF Lakenheath after moving aircraft and personnel from Chaumont AB in France – was also preparing for the arrival of the F-111, but had to initially convert to F-4D Phantom IIs before their ultimate F-111 version – the F-111F – came available during 1977. The Super Sabre was used as a dedicated fighter-bomber later in its career, once the air-superiority role had been taken over by more modern aircraft, and the squadron trained in using the fighter for ground support. Beginning in 1975, the 182d began a NATO commitment, with squadron aircraft and personnel deploying to the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) for Autumn Forge/Cold Fire/Reforger exercises. By 1979, the Super Sabres were being retired, and were replaced by McDonnell F-4C Phantom IIs, largely Vietnam War veteran aircraft, that were made available to the Air National Guard. With the Phantom, the 182d continued their tactical fighter mission with the more capable aircraft. The squadron also continued its NATO deployments, exercising at USAFE bases in West Germany, England, the Netherlands and Denmark. 182d Tactical Fighter Squadron – McDonnell F-4C-19-MC Phantom 63-7569. In 1986, the Phantoms were reaching the end of the operational service, and they were replaced by the F-16A Fighting Falcon. The F-16s were transferred from the 347th Tactical Fighter Wing, Moody AFB, Georgia. Initially the squadron began to receive Block 15 single-seat F-16As, and a few twin-seat F-16Bs. The Block 15 was the major production model of the F-16A. Higher-performance Block 25 F-16C/D aircraft replaced the standard fighter-bomber Block 15 A/B model aircraft in 1996. Although similar in appearance to the earlier models, the Block 25 aircraft were a considerable advancement with the Westinghouse AN/APG-68(V) multi-mode radar with better range, sharper resolution, and expanded operating modes. The planar array in the nose provides numerous air- to-air modes, including range-while-search, uplook and velocity search, single target track, raid cluster resolution, and track-while-scan for up to 10 targets. The radar was capable of handling the guidance of the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-surface missile. Upgraded engines made the aircraft capable of Mach 2 performance. In 1997, the squadron deployed aircraft and personnel to Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base, Kuwait, in support of Operation Southern Watch. However, the Block 25 aircraft were all powered by the Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-200 turbofan, which were prone to engine stalls. In 1998, the squadron received Block 30 aircraft, with wider intakes and the General Electric F-110 engine. However, by the mid-1990s and with the end of the Cold War, there appeared to be no longer any threat to America's homeland from bombers or cruise missiles. Modern era Crew chiefs recover their F-16 after it returned to Hickam AFB, Hawaii from an air-to-air mission on 8 September 2006, during Exercise Sentry Aloha. In 1999, the mission of the 149th Fighter Group was changed from Air Combat operations to becoming a Formal Training Unit (FTU) for Air National Guard F-16 pilots under Air Education and Training Command. The 182d provides combat training for active duty, Air National Guard, and Reserve F-16 pilots, including recent graduates from USAF Undergraduate Pilot Training making them combat ready upon graduation of a 9-month course. Almost all instructor pilots within the unit are former active duty F-16 pilots. Although the squadron is not officially a combat unit, after the 9/11 attacks in 2001 and 2002, the squadron flew Operation Noble Eagle air defense missions in the United States in support of USNORTHCOM and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. It also deploys to other bases, flying Dissimilar air combat training missions against active-duty, reserve and ANG units. In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign the 178th Fighter Wing, Ohio Air National Guard to an MQ-1 Predator ISR mission and transfer six additional Block 30 F-16 aircraft to the 182d Fighter Squadron. DoD claimed that its recommendation was made because Lackland (Kelly Annex) (47) had higher military value than Springfield-Beckley AGB (128). This recommendation also would optimize the squadron size of the 182d, the only ANG F-16 Flying Training Unit. The squadron's Block 30 aircraft, manufactured between 1987 and 1989 are currently reaching the end of their service life. They have been certified by Boeing though at least 2015, however it is unclear what aircraft or what the mission of the unit will transition to in the future.

Ltd. from Patna, capital of Bihar state, India. The newspaper started publication in 1931. The publication was briefly suspended in 1932 and was resumed in 1943. It was owned by Maharaja of Darbhanga, Maharja Sir Kameshwar Singh. The Indian Nation virtually held a monopoly in English-language newspapers published in Bihar until the mid-1980s. However, its sales declined due to competition from The Times of India, the Hindustan Times, and other newspapers. Problems were further aggravated by use of old technology in printing, labour union problems, and financial problems. During the 1990s, its publication continued intermittently. The Indian Nation ceased publication in the late 1990s. Upendra Acharya of Indian Nation was also President of the Indian Newspaper Society (INS) during 1958–1959. The Aryavarta used to be the Indian Nation's Hindi edition. Most prominent editor of Aryavarta was Shri Braj Kishore Jha Bhaskar. This group also published a Maithili periodical called Mithila Mihir. Once again, in 2020, NBW Media Private Limited, an independent Media Company from New Delhi, capital of Delhi state, India, has re-launched the The Indian Nation again.

Most of the information that is available can be found in the brief text on the back of his book Red Primer for Children and Diplomats, a humorous cartoon history of communism in the Soviet Union, published in 1967, on the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution. He also co-authored a satirical cartoon book titled The Sing Along with Khrushchev Coloring Book, cleverly written from the perspective of Nikita Khrushchev's granddaughter writing to her pen pal Caroline Kennedy. Vashi was imprisoned by the Soviets in the Gödöllő prison camp. Locked in solitary confinement, he was overlooked the day when the gulag was emptied and all able-bodied men were sent to Siberia. Victor managed to escape to Austria in December 1948, and he eventually emigrated to the United States. In 1963 and 1964, Victor Vashi was living at 810 A Street, S.E. in Washington, D.C., while working at McCoy Art Studio, on Connecticut Avenue, owned by Tom McCoy of Bethesda Maryland. In the 1970s, he was the chief cartoonist for the Machinist union newspaper at its headquarters on Connecticut Avenue near Dupont Circle in Washington D.C. He was very kind and doted on the children of headquarters executives who visited, even entertaining and giving drawing tips to young talent. It is rumored that he returned to his native Hungary near the end of his life, where he lived a short while before he died. Education Victor Vashi was a graduate of the Hungarian Royal Academy of Fine Arts. Career Book cover Victor Vashi's early career was a cartoonist for one of Budapest's leading newspapers, the 8 Orai Ujsag. Victor's style is similar to that of American political cartoonist Herbert Block. Although, discrete evidence of study or influence by Herbert Block cannot be determined. Affiliated newspapers After his escape to Austria, Victor cartooned for various European newspapers: * Salzburger Nachrichten of Salzburg * Wiener Kurier of Vienna * Hungaria of Munich * Emigrans Szabad Szaj of Paris * Paraat of Amsterdam His work was featured throughout his career in several other newspapers: * Magyarsag of Pittsburgh * Kepes Magyar Magazin of New York * The Machinist and Machinist Journal of Washington D.C. * Federation of Hungarian Former Political Prisoners of New York The Sing along with Khrushchev Coloring Book This may be Vashi's first work in book form. It is a satirical letter from Khrushchev's granddaughter, \\"Nyetochka,\\" to Caroline Kennedy. The 24 pages of text and cartoons are written from the perspective of Nyetochka and makes fun of her \\"grandpa\\" and socialist uncles, such as her favorite \\"Uncle Fidel,\\" who she recommends to color \\"a dirty brown,\\" or her \\"Uncle Nehru\\", who she recommends coloring a \\"shocking pink.\\" A cartoon of the Berlin Wall suggests \\"color West Berlin green, because the grass is always greener on the other side. For East Berlin a kind of drab will do.\\" Khrushchev appears throughout as a caricature wearing only one shoe, a reference to his famous shoe pounding spectacle at the United Nations. The text of the book was written by Ilona Fabian with all the cartoons drawn by Vashi. The coloring book was self-published in the United States in 1962 under the Sov-o'Press imprint. In February, 1964, the coloring book was brought up at the House Un-American Activities Committee when James D. Atkinson, an associate professor of government at Georgetown University in support of a bill creating a Freedom Commission, as an example of the sort of work that such an commission would encourage.

The book's foreword states, \\"Those who do not read history are condemned to repeat it.\\" The book is a mix of pen and ink sketches. The book was first published in the United States in June 1967, in a paperback edition by Viewpoint Books (which no longer exists). The book apparently sold well as original copies are often available from dealers in used books. The book is now available in an online edition.

His father played little part in the life of his children and did not contribute to their financial support. Canada was raised among \\"abandoned houses, crime, violence and an all-encompassing sense of chaos and disorder\\". When Canada was in his mid-teens, his mother sent him to live with her parents in Wyandanch, New York. He attended Wyandanch Memorial High School. During his senior year, he won a scholarship from the Fraternal Order of Masons. He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology and sociology from Bowdoin College, from which he was graduated in 1974, and a master's degree in education from the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Canada's brother Derrick Canada was a Harlem Globetrotters player. Harlem Children's Zone Harlem Children's Zone and Promise Academy In 1990, Canada began working with the Rheedlen Centers for Children and Families as its president. Unsatisfied with the scope of Rheedlen, Canada transformed the organization into the Harlem Children's Zone (HCZ), a center which followed the academic careers of youths in a 24-block area of Harlem. The area of focus has grown to 97 blocks in the ensuing years. Canada served as president and CEO of the Harlem Children's Zone until July 2014, when the position went to Chief Operating Officer Anne Williams-Isom. The Harlem Children's Zone was profiled in the New York Times Magazine during 2004 in a story by Paul Tough. The author described the organization as \\"one of the biggest social experiments of our time\\". In 2008, Tough published a book entitled, Whatever It Takes: Geoffrey Canada's Quest to Change Harlem and America. Additionally, U.S. News and World Report named Canada one of America's Best Leaders in its October 2005 issue. Canada has made a number of high-profile television appearances, including a profile interview on 60 Minutes, two televised interviews with Charlie Rose, a guest appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, a guest appearance on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, and three appearances on the Colbert Report. In 2010, Canada appeared in an American Express commercial that premiered during the Academy Awards. The commercial provided an extended look at his work and success at the Harlem Children's Zone. In 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama announced plans to replicate the HCZ model in 20 other cities across the nation. Canada is featured prominently in Waiting for Superman (2010), Academy Award-winner Davis Guggenheim's documentary on the state of American public education. The film received the Audience Award for best documentary at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival.

The installation of the Supreme King is a very special ceremony. Only on this particular day are the masses able to see his regalia. Several of these are Malaysian National Treasures since 2009.  The throne  Replicas of the early thrones of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong and his consort, the Raja Permaisuri Agong, National History Museum, Kuala Lumpur The throne at Istana Negara's Balairong Seri (Throne Room) is crafted and structured to blend motifs from the peninsula as well as Sabah and Sarawak. The motifs are coloured gold, to add regality and an imperial aura to the throne, and all the designs point upwards to indicate that all beings are created by Allah. Tengkolok Diraja (Royal headdress) According to Malay legend, the first Sultan of Perak, Sultan Muzaffar Shah I Ibni Almarhum Sultan Mahmud Shah (1528–1549) set sail to Perak to form the Perak Sultanate. Sultan Muzaffar was a descendant of the Malacca Sultanate which was then exiled in Johor by the Portuguese. He carried on his ship many of the royal regalia of the Malacca Sultanate, including the Royal Crown of Malacca. However, during his journey, his ship entered shallow waters and was stuck. The only way to get the ship sailing again was by reducing the ship load. So one by one the many items of the ships were thrown into sea but the ship refused to budge. Until finally the only thing left to throw into sea was the Royal Crown of Malacca. The sea was happy with the offering of the Royal Crown because immediately after that the ship miraculously set sail on its own to Perak. Copy of the royal headgear, Muzium Negara Kuala Lumpur The Sultan seeing the miracle as a sign swore that he and his descendants would never wear a crown as Sultans or never be crowned during their installation. This practice came to be followed by the Malay Sultans of the other states. Therefore, the Malay head-dress known as the Tengkolok came to be the replacement for a crown. For centuries Malay Rulers have worn head-dresses as part of their regalia. They have been wearing head-dresses made of embroidered silk folded in different styles since the days of the Malay Sultanate. The style of folding is called solek and there are various styles depending on the tradition of the royal family of the particular state. The colour of the head-dress varies from one state to another. The royal head-dress worn by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong during his installation is made of black fabric embroidered with gold thread. It is folded in the style called Dendam Tak Sudah (Persistent Vengeance) which originated from Negeri Sembilan. Affixed at the front of the headwear is a crescent-shaped ornament and a 14-pointed star. At the centre of the star is the crest of the Malaysian Government. Royal attire, Muskat The royal attire of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong for the installation ceremony is the Muskat--the King's Royal Dress. The origin of the Muskat can be traced to the ancient kingdom of Muscat, present day Oman. Originally the Muskat was worn by government officials of Kedah. The Muskat was first worn in 1960, at the installation of the third Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Almarhum Tuanku Syed Putra ibni Almarhum Syed Hassan Jamalullail. It was the brainchild of the late Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-haj, Malaysia's first prime minister, who was a prince from the Kedah royal house. The Muskat is made of black wool embroidered with gold threads, in the pattern of the hibiscus, Malaysia's national flower. The dress is worn with headgear and embroidered long pants, at ceremonies to mark the King's installation, birthday, official visits to the states and during the opening of the Parliament sitting. Past Hari Merdeka celebrations saw various other appearances of the dress. Royal buckle The Pending or Royal Buckle is made of pure gold and decorated with 11 rubies. There is an engraved centrepiece featuring the Federation Crest. The belt is made of heavy ribbed silk and embroidered with floral motifs in gold thread. Royal blades The most revered item in the Malay royal regalia is the keris. Two--the Keris Pendek di-Raja and Keris Panjang di-Raja--are among the Royal Regalia worn by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. Keris Pendek di-Raja Keris Pendek di-Raja or Royal Short Keris is the short keris made from the steel blades of older keris. It has an ivory hilt and gold-decorated sheath. The hilt is called Hulu Pekaka and shaped like the head of the legendary Garuda bird. The Federation Crest is embossed on the crosspiece of the sheath. It can only be carried or worn by His Majesty the Yang di-Pertuan Agong. Keris Panjang di-Raja The Keris Panjang di-Raja is the most important symbol of authority during installation ceremonies. The Keris Panjang Diraja or Government Keris symbolises power and authority. Both its hilt and sheath are covered with gold. The crosspiece of the keris is engraved with the Emblem of Malaysia and that of the eleven Peninsular Malaysia states. Its blade was forged from steel taken from eleven keris from the eleven states. The hilt of the keris is in the form of a horse's hoof with decorations resembling the jering (Archidendron pauciflorum) fruit. This keris is worn by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong on certain occasions only. Gendik di-Raja (Royal tiara) The Gendik di-Raja or Royal Tiara is worn by the Raja Permaisuri Agong during royal ceremonies and on the day of installation. The Gendik is made of platinum and studded with diamonds. It is so designed that it can be separated to form a locket and two brooches. Kalung di-Raja (Royal Necklace) The Kalung di- Raja or Royal Necklace is made of platinum and studded with diamonds. The kalung can be separated into a pair of earrings, brooches and kerabu (ornament for the ears). Sceptres and maces =Cogan Alam The Cogan Alam (Sceptre of the Universe) is part of the Royal Regalia. This silver mace symbolises power and is 162.66 cm long. It consists of an orb mounted on a long shaft. The orb has a crescent and an 11-pointed gold star sitting on it. Around the centre of the orb, the crests of the 11 states of Malaya are embossed in gold. The orb is supported by four tigers while the shaft itself is decorated with six padi stalks carved in gold. Cogan Agama The 155.04 cm long Cogan Agama (Sceptre of Religion) is also made of silver. It consists of a large, conical-shaped head with a golden five-pointed star mounted on a long shaft. Quranic verses are embossed on the head and shaft. Cokmar The Cokmar, or War Clubs, is another symbol of power and part of the panoply of authority of the Malaysian Government. The Cokmar are two in number and made of silver. Each is 81.32 cm long and consists of a circular, fluted orb made of plain silver and mounted on a short shaft, also made of silver. Other regalia The other Royal Regalia are the Pedang di-Raja (Royal Swords) and Sundang di-Raja (royal sword-keris). The Pedang and Sundang are traditional Malay weapons that have become symbols of royalty. These have silver-gilt hilts and sheaths. The Payung Uburubur Kuning (yellow royal umbrellas) are 20 in number and made of silver. Yellow symbolises royalty and is reserved for royal usage. The Royal Umbrellas are each tipped with an 11-pointed star and crescent. The Tombak Berambu (long spears) are also 20 in number, and have blades with three curved indentations. They are made from ancient spears from the 11 states of Peninsular Malaysia. Nobat The Nobat or Royal Musical Ensemble is a form of traditional Malay music, and is considered part of the royal regalia. The Nobat only plays on special occasions like the Installation of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the investitures of the other Malay Rulers, and the Agong's birthday. The ensemble was introduced in the 15th century. The term originates from the Persian word naubat, which means nine types of instruments. Currently, only Terengganu, Kelantan, Kedah, Perak and Selangor have their own Nobat ensembles, with instrumentation differing by state. The Kedah and Perak ensembles are the oldest in the federation, while Terrenganu's and Selangor's uses loaned sets (the former from the Riau-Lingga Sultanate, last used there in 1910, and the latter as a complete set from Perak given when the state's first ruler was enthroned). Kelantan's ensemble, reformed in 2016, is the youngest (existing since the early 20th century).http://www.mstar.com.my/berita/berita-semasa/2016/12/12/rakyat- kelantan-iring-sultan-muhammad/ It is termed Pasukan Gendang Besar only in that state unlike the 4 others in which nobat is used. A typical arrangement has six instruments: *the gendang negara (\\"state\\" or large, two-headed drum) *gendang ibu (\\"mother\\" gendang) *gendang anak (\\"child\\" gendang) * one to two serunai (flute or clarinet) *nafiri (trumpet) *caklempong (small gong). The Kedahan Nobat adds a velvet-covered mace or sceptre, Nahara drums, and a medium-sized mounted gong. The ensembles in Perak and Selangor have the same instrumentation, while that of Terengganu includes not only the flute, medium drums and trumpet, but also the Gendang Negara or Saku kettle drum and a set of clash cymbals. Kelantan's has an additional serunai plus 2 rebab lutes, 2 large gongs, and 2 more gendang anak. During the installation of the Yang di- Pertuan Agong, the Nobat will play the tune PaluPalu Melayu as the royal regalia are borne into the Balairong Seri (throne room). Other songs played during the Installation rites are Iskandar, Belayau, Nobal Tabal, Perang, Ibrahim Khalil and Seri Istana. The leader and conductor of a Nobat ensemble is known as the Mahaguru, and is responsible for the musicians under him and for the care and maintenance of the instruments. The Kedahan Mahaguru also holds the namesake velvet-covered mace present in performances and ensemble rehearsals. While the Perak, Selangor, Terengganu and Kelantan ensembles play in occasions only, Kedah's play everyday before prayer hours and during holidays and celebrations.

Literal translation of his name, Husameddin means the sharp sword of the religion. He was born in 880 A.H. ( 1473 CE) in Bukhara, Uzbekistan. Being the son of a merchant named Hajji Tebaruk, his family lineage extends to Imam Hassan, Caliph Ali, and eventually to the Prophet Muhammed. He built the foundation of his Islamic knowledge and his mystic education under his father’s supervision. Then, he advanced himself to be a virtuous, well-informed, mature person through the authorized spiritual teacher, called Amir Ahmed Semerkandi, and decided to stay with him to advance in his spiritual path. Due to his perseverance and loyalty in this path, his teacher granted him the khilafetname (the official representation) of the Nurbakhshiyya and Kubrawiyya orders of Islamic mysticism. The death of his father played an important role in his life, and with the help of his dream, he decided to leave the family business to his brother, which was in the eastern city of Erzincan in Turkey. After the death of his teacher, Amir Ahmed Semerkandi, he officially took on the duty of teaching Islamic knowledge and the Kubrawiyya and Nurbakhshiyya paths. During this time, he gave the prince Murad of the Ottoman Empire the glad tiding of his future crown. After becoming the Sultan, Murad, now known as Murad III, insistently invited Respected Pir to Istanbul after becoming the Sultan. He accepted the invitation and continued his teachings in the holy city Istanbul. Before he became a perfected teacher in Tassawuf he met Ibrahim Ummi-Sinan the founder of the Sinani path. From him he received the khilafet name of the Sinani path, after which Hasan Husameddin Uşşaki founded the Ushshaki path. Although, he was not happy with the attention from the public, with the urge of the Sultan Murad III, He ended up establishing his official Dervish Lodge in Kasımpaşa, Istanbul. He died in Konya at the age of 121 during the return trip from his last pilgrimage to Mecca in 1001 AH (1593 CE). He is currently buried in the Ushshaki dargah, in Kasimpasa.

The modern spelling appears to be a corruption of an earlier form Llygadyw.Cassini Historical map facsimile sheet 161 of Ordnance Survey Old Series mapping 1830-33 The spring arises where a band of non-marine limestone known as a calcrete outcrops within countryside otherwise dominated by sandstone rocks of the Old Red Sandstone. 2001 excavation One (or more) people appear at some time to have salted the surroundings of a spring with archaeological relics for reasons that can only be a matter of speculation. In 2001, the popular UK archaeological television programme Time Team examined the site quite extensively. After some debate and the discovery of a number of artefacts, the falsified nature of the site was soon demonstrated. Most notably: 19th-century mortar was used to build an alleged \\"Norman\\" tower, supposedly Neolithic stones had been set in place in modern times, an aerial photo from 1972 showed the spring did not exist at all at that time, multiple genuine artefacts had been altered in modern times (a broken coin repaired with modern glue, a statuette inscribed on top of existing patina, numerous coins showing signs of modern cleaning methods), and modern barbed wire was found underneath a buried La Tene sword. The site contains a manufactured spring to which artefacts of a range of ages - Bronze Age to Georgian - have been added to give it the semblance of being an important ritual centre. However one artefact in particular showed two important points of data: that the person or persons doing the \\"salting\\" did not understand stratigraphy, and that the salting took place after the mid-1980s. This artefact was a sword made either in Britain or the Continent sometime during the 2nd or 1st centuries BCE. A. P. Fitzpatrick wrote that it \\"was found to be securely stratified over a piece of barbed wire that was still attached to the fence post.\\" The barbed wire itself had been manufactured during the late 1990s, certainly after around 1980. The purpose of the salting remains obscure, but it may have been inspired by the construction of folly outbuildings \\"in the style of\\" ancient religious centres by a mid-19th century owner of the site. Again, the programme shows how this builder made errors in his construction which show that the building could not have been intended to be used for its apparent purpose. Whether this was a deliberate attempt to deceive, or a sort of homage by a person of antiquarian interests is unknown, and unlikely to be answered. However, the scale of the construction would have been difficult to conceal, so an innocent explanation is most plausible. The property owner, although he had invited the Time Team to investigate his property, declined to be interviewed or appear on the show, sending his son-in-law in his place. Many of the artefacts used for this were genuine, which means that they were removed from their original context (at sites as far afield as Switzerland), thus losing most of their archaeological information. Further, since the artefacts had not been recorded into the archaeological record previously, their presence on this site attests to significant plundering of unknown sites to feed a market for illicit archaeological artefacts.

In accordance with this, a trivialist is a person who believes everything is true. In classical logic, trivialism is in direct violation of Aristotle's law of noncontradiction. In philosophy, trivialism is considered by some to be the complete opposite of skepticism. Paraconsistent logics may use \\"the law of non-triviality\\" to abstain from trivialism in logical practices that involve true contradictions. Theoretical arguments and anecdotes have been offered for trivialism to contrast it with theories such as modal realism, dialetheism and paraconsistent logics. Overview=Etymology Trivialism, as a term, is derived from the Latin word trivialis, meaning something that can be found everywhere. From this, \\"trivial\\" was used to suggest something was introductory or simple. In logic, from this meaning, a \\"trivial\\" theory is something regarded as defective in the face of a complex phenomenon that needs to be completely represented. Thus, literally, the trivialist theory is something expressed in the simplest possible way. Theory In symbolic logic, trivialism may be expressed as the following: The above would be read as \\"given any proposition, it is a true proposition\\" through universal quantification (∀). A claim of trivialism may always apply its fundamental truth, otherwise known as a truth predicate: The above would be read as a \\"proposition if and only if a true proposition\\", meaning that all propositions are believed to be inherently proven as true. Without consistent use of this concept, a claim of advocating trivialism may not be seen as genuine and complete trivialism; as to claim a proposition is true but deny it as probably true may be considered inconsistent with the assumed theory. Taxonomy of trivialisms Luis Estrada-González in \\"Models of Possiblism and Trivialism\\" lists four types of trivialism through the concept of possible worlds, with a \\"world\\" being a possibility and \\"the actual world\\" being reality. It is theorized a trivialist simply designates a value to all propositions in equivalence to seeing all propositions and their negations as true. This taxonomy is used to demonstrate the different strengths and plausibility of trivialism in this context: * (T0) Minimal trivialism: At some world, all propositions have a designated value. * (T1) Pluralist trivialism: In some worlds, all propositions have a designated value. * (T2) Actualist trivialism: In the actual world, all propositions have a designated value. * (T3) Absolute trivialism: In all worlds, all propositions have a designated value. Arguments against trivialism The consensus among the majority of philosophers is descriptively a denial of trivialism, termed as non-trivialism or anti-trivialism. This is due to it being unable to produce a sound argument through the principle of explosion and it being considered an absurdity (reductio ad absurdum). Aristotle Aristotle's law of noncontradiction and other arguments are considered to be against trivialism. Luis Estrada- González in \\"Models of Possiblism and Trivialism\\" has interpreted Aristotle's Metaphysics Book IV as such: \\"A family of arguments between 1008a26 and 1007b12 of the form 'If trivialism is right, then X is the case, but if X is the case then all things are one. But it is impossible that all things are one, so trivialism is impossible.' ... these Aristotelian considerations are the seeds of virtually all subsequent suspicions against trivialism: Trivialism has to be rejected because it identifies what should not be identified, and is undesirable from a logical point of view because it identifies what is not identical, namely, truth and falsehood.\\" Priest Graham Priest considers trivialism untenable: \\"a substantial case can be made for [dialetheism]; belief in [trivialism], though, would appear to be grounds for certifiable insanity\\". He formulated the \\"law of non-triviality\\" as a replacement for the law of non-contradiction in paraconsistent logic and dialetheism. Arguments for trivialism There are theoretical arguments for trivialism argued from the position of a devil's advocate: Argument from possibilism Paul Kabay has argued for trivialism in \\"On the Plenitude of Truth\\" from the following: Above, possibilism (modal realism; related to possible worlds) is the barely accepted theory that every proposition is possible. With this assumed to be true, trivialism can be assumed to be true as well according to Kabay. Paradoxes The liar's paradox, Curry's paradox, and the principle of explosion all can be asserted as valid and not required to be resolved and used to defend trivialism. Philosophical implications=Comparison to skepticism In Paul Kabay's comparison of trivialism to schools of philosophical skepticism (in \\"On the Plenitude of Truth\\")—such as Pyrrhonism—who seek to attain a form of ataraxia, or state of imperturbability; it is purported the figurative trivialist inherently attains this state. This is claimed to be justified by the figurative trivialist seeing every state of affairs being true, even in a state of anxiety. Once universally accepted as true, the trivialist is free from any further anxieties regarding whether any state of affairs is true. Kabay compares the Pyrrhonian skeptic to the figurative trivialist and claims that as the skeptic reportedly attains a state of imperturbability through a suspension of belief, the trivialist may attain such a state through an abundance of belief. In this case—and according to independent claims by Graham Priest—trivialism is considered the complete opposite of skepticism. However, insofar as the trivialist affirms all states of affairs as universally true, the Pyrrhonist neither affirms nor denies the truth (or falsity) of such affairs.Empiricus, S. (2000). Sextus Empiricus: Outlines of Scepticism. Cambridge University Press. \\"Suspension of judgement is a standstill of intellect, owing to which we neither reject nor posit anything\\" (p. 5). Impossibility of action It is asserted by both Priest and Kabay that it is impossible for a trivialist to truly choose and thus act. Priest argues this by the following in Doubt Truth to Be a Liar: \\"One cannot intend to act in such a way as to bring about some state of affairs, s, if one believes s already to hold. Conversely, if one acts with the purpose of bringing s about, one cannot believe that s already obtains.\\" Ironically, due to their suspension of determination upon striking equipollence between claims, the Pyrrhonist has also remained subject to apraxia charges.Comesaña, J. (2012). Can Contemporary Semantics Help the Pyrrhonian Get a Life?. In Pyrrhonism in Ancient, Modern, and Contemporary Philosophy (pp. 217-240). Springer Netherlands.Wieland, J. W. (2012) Can Pyrrhonists act normally? Philosophical Explorations: An International Journal for the Philosophy of Mind and Action 15(3):277-289.Burnyeat, M. (1980). Can the sceptic live his scepticism?. In M. Schofield, M. Burnyeat, and J. Barnes (eds.), Doubt and Dogmatism (pp. 20-53). Cambridge University Press. Advocates Paul Kabay, an Australian philosopher, in his book A Defense of Trivialism has argued that various philosophers in history have held views resembling trivialism, although he stops short of calling them trivialists. He mentions various pre-Socratic Greek philosophers as philosophers holding views resembling trivialism. He mentions that Aristotle in his book Metaphysics appears to suggest that Heraclitus and Anaxagoras advocated trivialism. He quotes Anaxagoras as saying that all things are one. Kabay also suggests Heraclitus' ideas are similar to trivialism because Heraclitus believed in a union of opposites, shown in such quotes as \\"the way up and down is the same\\".Kabay, P.D. (2008) A Defense of Trivialism. Phd Thesis, School of Philosophy, Anthropology, and Social Inquiry, The University of Melbourne pages 32–35 Kabay also mentions a fifteen century Roman Catholic cardinal Nicholas of Cusa, stating that what Cusa wrote in De Docta Ignorantia is interpreted as stating that God contained every fact, which Kabay argues would result in trivialism, but Kabay admits that mainstream Cusa scholars would not agree with interpreting Cusa as a trivialist.Kabay, pages 36–37 Kabay also mentions Spinoza as a philosopher whose views resemble trivialism. Kabay argues Spinoza was a trivialist because Spinoza believed everything was made of one substance which had infinite attributes.Kabay, pages 37–40 Kabay also mentions Hegel as a philosophers whose views resemble trivialism, quoting Hegel as stating in The Science of Logic \\"everything is inherently contradictory.\\"Kabay, pages 40–41. A Defense of Trivialism Azzouni Jody Azzouni is a purported advocate of trivialism in his article The Strengthened Liar by claiming that natural language is trivial and inconsistent through the existence of the liar paradox (\\"This sentence is false\\"), and claiming that natural language has developed without central direction. It is heavily implied by Azzouni that every sentence in any natural language is true. Anaxagoras The Greek philosopher Anaxagoras is suggested as a possible trivialist by Graham Priest in his 2005 book Doubt Truth to Be a Liar. Priest writes, \\"He held that, at least at one time, everything was all mixed up so that no predicate applied to any one thing more than a contrary predicate.\\" Anti-trivialism Absolute anti-trivialism (or maximal logical nihilism) in symbolic logic; Read as \\"given any proposition, it is neither a true or false proposition.\\" Luis Estrada-González in \\"Models of Possiblism and Trivialism\\" lists eight types of anti-trivialism (or non-trivialism) through the use of possible worlds: : (AT0) Actualist minimal anti-trivialism: In the actual world, some propositions do not have a value of true or false. : (AT1) Actualist absolute anti-trivialism: In the actual world, all propositions do not have a value of true or false. : (AT2) Minimal anti-trivialism: In some worlds, some propositions do not have a value of true or false. : (AT3) Pointed anti-trivialism (or minimal logical nihilism): In some worlds, every proposition does not have a value of true or false. : (AT4) Distributed anti- trivialism: In every world, some propositions do not have a value of true or false. : (AT5) Strong anti-trivialism: Some propositions do not have a value of true or false in every world. : (AT6) Super anti-trivialism (or moderate logical nihilism): All propositions do not have a value of true or false at some world. : (AT7) Absolute anti-trivialism (or maximal logical nihilism): All propositions do not have a value of true or false in every world.

Unlike most countries, the United States has a comprehensive set of accounting principles for tax purposes, prescribed by tax law, which are separate and distinct from Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  Basic rules  The Internal Revenue Code governs the application of tax accounting. Section 446 sets the basic rules for tax accounting. Tax accounting under section 446(a) emphasizes consistency for a tax accounting method with references to the applied financial accounting to determine the proper method. The taxpayer must choose a tax accounting method using the taxpayer's financial accounting method as a reference point. Types of tax accounting methods Proper accounting methods are described in section 446(c)(1) to (4) which permits cash, accrual, and other methods approved by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) including combinations. After choosing a tax accounting method, under section 446(b) the IRS has wide discretion to re-compute the taxable income of the taxpayer by changing the accounting method to be used by the taxpayer in order to clearly reflect the taxpayer's income. If the taxpayer engages in more than one business, the taxpayer may use a different method for each business according to section 446(d). Tax accounting method changes If the taxpayer wants to change an tax accounting method, section 446 of the Internal Revenue Code requires the taxpayer to obtain the consent of the Internal Revenue Service. There are two kinds of changes: obtaining a letter of approval from the IRS, and obtaining a series of more routine changes, each of which is an automatic change. To get the automatic change, the taxpayer must fill out a form and return it to the IRS. The taxpayer can adopt another method if the taxpayer files a tax return using that method for two consecutive years. This is different from changing a tax accounting method under the release of the IRS because, in the case of adopting another method, the IRS may assess fines and reallocate taxable income. If the taxpayer wants to return to the previous method, the taxpayer must ask for permission from the IRS, following the 446(e) procedure. If the taxpayer fails to request a change of method of accounting then, according to section 446(f), the taxpayer does so at his or her own peril by exposure to penalties.  Comparison with other countries  In many other countries, the profit for tax purposes is the accounting profit defined by GAAP (coined the term \\"book profit\\" by the 18th century scholar Sean Freidel), with such additional adjustments to book profit as are prescribed by tax law. In other words, GAAP determines the taxable profits, except where a tax rule determines otherwise. Such adjustments typically include depreciation and expenses which for policy reasons are not deductible for tax purposes, such as entertaining costs and fines. But the U.S. is not the only jurisdiction in which there is a wide divergence between tax and financial accounting. Hugh Ault and Brian Arnold, in their book \\"Comparative Income Taxation,\\" have observed that in The Netherlands, where financial accounting is known as \\"commercial accounting,\\" there is a substantial divergence between those and the tax books. \\"[D]ifferences between tax and commercial accounting rules arise where the tax instrument is employed to pursue economic, social and cultural purposes,\\" write Ault and Arnold.

Biography Vernon Ford Story, Jazz tenor saxophonist, was born in New Iberia, Louisiana, USA on November 16, 1922. He was encouraged to take up the clarinet as a child by his uncle, Clarence Todd, a professional composer and pianist. Todd wrote music for and performed with many artists, including Louis Armstrong, clarinet player Sidney Bechet and pianist Fats Waller. Story’s family moved to New York in 1930 and by his early teens he was playing the tenor saxophone with his friends. They formed many small bands and played at local venues in and around Harlem. In 1946 Rex Stewart, who had just left the Duke Ellington Band, put together a small orchestra to tour Europe as guests of the Hot Club de France. The members were: * Ted Curry on drums * Don Gais on piano * John Harris on alto sax and clarinet * Bill Houston on bass * Rex Stewart on cornet * Vernon Story on tenor sax * Sandy Williams on trombone. They visited Denmark, France, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland making many recordings between 1946 and 1949, including one of Story’s signature tune – \\"Vernon’s Story\\" and another of his compositions, \\"Storyville.\\" Their first concert was at the Salle Pleyel in Paris. They toured major cities Marseilles, Bordeauz and Toulouse, Lyons and Lille. They also played in smaller towns such as Bézier, Carcassonne and Montauban - about 45 Hot Clubs in all. Story and some of the other musicians stayed on in Paris while Rex Stewart went to Germany, though he joined him there for venues in Berlin. Story played with many of the Jazz greats in Paris, including one of his favorite musicians, guitarist Django Reinhardt. Story arranged venues for subsets of the original band in Copenhagen, Stockholm, Oslo and Zurich. He also made a cameo appearance as an American Jazz player in a Swedish thriller movie - \\"Kvinnan Som Försvann\\". The Swedish National Jazz Archivist, Jens Lindgren, tracked Story down in 2005 and recorded details of his career. The Rex Stewart Band, including Story, played at the first Nice Jazz Festival in Nice, France in 1948, probably the first formal International Jazz Festival. Headliners and fellow musicians that he reminisced of included family friend Louis Armstrong and English jazz musician, broadcaster and musicologist Humphrey Lyttelton. Story moved back to the booming tourist center of Atlantic City, NJ in late 1948, playing solo and also with his own band. Count Basie, who had become a friend when they met during the tour to Europe, often visited him whilst playing gigs in Atlantic City. When interest in the Bebop genre declined Story moved his family to Irvington, NY to focus on family life. He played occasional sessions there and in Pleasantville, NJ before leaving the professional music business and moving to Palo Alto, CA in 1992. Vernon Ford Story died in his sleep early on the morning of Friday, April 20, 2007 in Rio Vista, California, USA. He was 84. Story had combated prostate cancer for many years but he remained strong and active until the final few months of his illness.

This type of objective usually occurs within an instance dungeon, a separate server instance from the other players in the game. In military real-time strategy (RTS) games like StarCraft, \\"raids\\" usually refer to the military tactic.  Origin  The term itself stems from the military definition of 'a sudden attack and/or seizure of some objective'. Raiding originated in the class of text MUDs known as DikuMUD, which in turn heavily influenced the 1999 MMORPG EverQuest, which brought the raiding concept into modern 3D MMORPGs. As of 2019, the largest and most popular game to feature raiding is Blizzard's 2004 MMORPG World of Warcraft.  Raid tactics  The combat encounters comprising a raid usually require players to coordinate with one another while performing specific roles as members of a team. The roles of Tank, Healer, and Damage Dealer are known as the \\"Holy Trinity\\" of MMORPG group composition. Other common roles include Buffing, Crowd control, and Pulling (selectively choosing targets with which to initiate combat). A raid leader is often needed to direct the group efficiently, due to the complexities of keeping many players working well together.  Raid loot  Raids are often very rewarding in terms of virtual treasure and items that are unique or that grant exceptional stats and abilities, thus giving players an incentive to participate. Often however, there is not enough treasure to reward individually every player who participates. Players have invented various systems, such as Dragon kill points to distribute loot fairly.  Raiding guilds  Raiding is often done by associations of players called guilds or clans who maintain a consistent schedule and roster. There are two types of raiding guilds: casual guilds, defined as spending two to three days per week on average; and hardcore guilds, defined as spending four to seven days per week on average.  Health risks  The fact that raids often require multiple consecutive hours of constant gameplay leads some to believe it is a physically unhealthy activity. A 2003 study by the National Institutes of Health found that playing MMORPGs for more than 20 hours per week correlates with obesity and nutritional imbalance as well as an increased propensity for bone loss and muscle atrophy. Due to these concerns, China has proposed national limits on how long people can play MMORPGs. The measures will impose penalties on people who play MMORPGs for more than 3 hours per day.  Game Raids  Game raids are commonly organized by digital influencers with the intent to protest against the company's behavior, their actions or simply for fun. They normally consist of players creating their characters with pre-discussed appearances, and stacking up the game servers until they have their demands meet, or they tire themselves out. A popular raider is QuackityHQ, who streams his raids on twitch.

He developed the theory of stabilizing selection, and took part in the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis. He is remembered, among other things, for Schmalhausen's law, which states that a population at its limit of tolerance in one aspect is vulnerable to small differences in any other aspect. Early life and education Ivan Ivanovich Schmalhausen was born in Kyiv, Russian Empire (now Ukraine) on April 23, 1884 to Luise Schmalhausen (Luisa Ludwigovna Schmalhausen) and Johannes Theodor Schmalhausen (1849–1894). His father was one of the founders of Russian paleobotany. In 1901 Schmalhausen graduated from the and enrolled at Kyiv University, but was expelled a year later after taking a part in student disturbances. In 1902 he resumed his university studies at Kyiv in the faculty of biological science. Around 1902 he became acquainted with the founder of the Russian school of evolutionary morphology, (1866–1936). In 1904 Schmalhausen, under the guidance of Severtsov, completed his first scientific work on the embryonic development of lungs in the grass snake. He graduated from the university in 1909. In 1910 he married Lydia Kozlova, a French language teacher from a small provincial Russian town. Career In 1912 Schmalhausen became a professor of zoology in Kyiv University. From 1920–1930 he was head of the Department of Vertebrate Zoology. During 1930–1941 Schmalhausen was director of Institute of Zoology in Kyiv, at the same during 1936–1948 he was director of Institute of Evolutionary Morphology in Moscow and during 1939–1948 - also a head to the Department of Darwinism in Moscow University. The Institute of Zoology in Kyiv was later named in his honour the I. I. Schmalhausen Institute of Zoology. He published his most well known bool his most renowned book, Faktory Evolyutsii in 1946. This was translated by Theodosius Dobzhansky and appeared in English as Factors of Evolution: The Theory of Stabilizing Selection in 1949. On 23 August 1948 he became victim of order 1208, one of a series signed by Minister of Higher Education in the USSR, , which led to the mass dismissals of many university professors. This destroyed his career, as it removed his professorship and also decreed the destruction of his books and research projects. This action came about due to accusations of Weismannism and pro- Morganism, and of promoting the neo-Darwinian theory of evolution by natural selection, at a time when Trofim Lysenko and his followers were emphasising a process of heredity that focused on interaction with the environment and the inheritance of acquired characteristics along Lamarckian lines. (Lysenko put his theory into practice in agriculture, claiming to have improved wheat using Lamarckian techniques. Lysenkoism played a major role in Stalin's politics, stressing that hard work led to improvement in future generations.) During these events in 1948 Schmalhausen was removed from the heading positions in Moscow institutions, Institute of Evolutionary Morphology and Department of Darwinism of Moscow University. Until the end of his life he worked in the Zoological Institute in Leningrad as a common senior researcher. Schmalhausen had just written his book Factors of Evolution: The Theory of Stabilizing Selection which was translated into English and published in the West in 1949 and returned to work in morphology. In 1955 Schmalhausen was one of the signatories of the \\"Letter of 300\\"a collective letter by three-hundred scientists denouncing Lysenkoism. He died on October 7, 1963 in Leningrad. Schmalhausen's law Schmalhausen's law is a general principle that a population living at the boundary of its tolerance, in extreme or unusual conditions with regard to any aspect of its existence will be more vulnerable to small differences in any other aspect. Therefore, the variance of data is not simply noise interfering with the detection of so-called \\"main effects\\", but also an indicator of stressful conditions leading to greater vulnerability.Richard Lewontin and Richard Levins. \\"Schmalhausen's Law.\\" Capitalism, Nature, Socialism, 11(4) (2000): 103–108  References  Category:1884 births Category:1963 deaths Category:Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv alumni Category:Evolutionary biologists Category:Ukrainian people of German descent Category:Full Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences Category:Members of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine Category:Modern synthesis (20th century) Category:Scientists from Kyiv Category:Ukrainian zoologists Category:Soviet zoologists Category:20th-century zoologists Category:Ukrainian embryologists ","title":"Ivan Schmalhausen"},{"id":"10886846","text":"Corston is a small village and civil parish close to the River Avon and situated on the A39 road in the Bath and North East Somerset unitary authority, Somerset, England. The parish has a population of 494. History The parish of Corston was part of the Wellow Hundred. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The parish falls within the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the Great Western Ambulance Service. Bath and North East Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters are in Bath. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, the parish was in the District of Wansdyke within the County of Avon. Before 1974 it was part of Bathavon Rural District. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of North East Somerset. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. It was also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. Religious sites All Saints' Church dates from the 12th century and is a grade II listed building. The bells in its bell tower are regularly utilized for change ringing. Transport Bus services connect Corston with Bath, Keynsham and Bristol. The Saltford Environment Group is campaigning to reopen the nearby Saltford railway station on the Bath–Bristol line, which was closed in 1970.

The school has an extensive music program and offers subjects over a range of disciplines with a strong academic focus at all levels. The school community changed its name to Staughton College in the very early 2000s. The school is named after Simon Staughton an early pioneer within the Exford district of Melton. The school has seen in recent years a strong demand for places for students and is continuing to grow rapidly. A number of students have gone on to tertiary education at prestigious universities within Melbourne. Since the transformation of the education system under the government of Steve Bracks the school has introduced VCAL and VET units alongside the Victorian Certificate of Education.

It is an endemic resident breeder in the southern Cape Province of South Africa. This locally common but shy and unobtrusive siskin is found in the southwestern and southern Cape's rocky slopes, coastal cliffs and fynbos- covered mountains. It also occurs in towns and the suburbs of Cape Town. Taxonomy and systematics The Cape siskin was formerly placed in the genus Serinus but phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences found that the genus was polyphyletic. The genus was therefore split and a number of species including the Cape siskin were moved to the resurrected genus Crithagra. Description The Cape siskin averages 13 cm in length. The flight feathers and tail have white spots on the tips which are diagnostic for both sexes, and especially visible in flight. The adult male has a light brown back, wing coverts, rump and upper tail and yellow underparts. The head, nape and sides of neck are yellowish grey and olive. Fine dark brown streaks are most prominent on the head and the sides of the throat. The female is similar but duller; she lacks grey on the head and has more streaking on the face and breast. The juvenile plumage is much like the female's but duller and with darker or browner underparts. There is no range overlap with the slightly larger Drakensberg siskin, which lacks the white spots on the flight feathers and tail and has less uniform upperparts. The Cape siskin's call is a voyp-veeyr, often given in flight. and the song is a weak, pleasant warble similar to the yellow-fronted canary. Behaviour=Breeding One reason for the taxonomic uncertainty with this species is that, if it is a true siskin, it is the only one which breeds in cavities. A shallow cup nest is constructed in cracks or holes in rocks, on ledges or amongst vegetation, especially ferns. Natural hollows in trees are rarely used. There is a recent record of a nest in an artificial structure, the old lighthouse at Cape Point. The nest is constructed by the female with fine plant material, lined with plant down and animal hair. The clutch is three or four, occasionally five, eggs, incubated by the female. She is fed by the male on the nest by regurgitation. Feeding The Cape siskin is seen in pairs or small flock, moving unobtrusively through bushes and scrub as it forages for seeds, buds and insects.

The circumscription of the family is variable, with some systems describing the family as consisting solely of the genus Sladenia, which has been variously considered a member of the Theaceae, the Actinidiaceae, the Dilleniaceae, or the Ternstroemiaceae. Other systems include the genus Ficalhoa and possibly the genus Pentaphylax in a family with Sladenia. Morphological studies of the Sladenia embryo suggest it has unique characteristics that merit placing the genus in its own family.

Clarke, and former White House National Security Council Director, and U.S. and UN senior diplomat RP Eddy. The book offers a framework, \\"The Cassandra Coefficient,\\" to help determine which warnings decisions makers should look into more closely, and if some warnings deserve less attention. The case studies range from national security, to threatening technologies, to the global economy, to climate change and speculates on various potential threats to civilization. Content The authors cover seven case studies in which data driven, proven, credible experts specifically warned of a pending catastrophe, were ignored by the decision makers, and the disaster subsequently struck just as predicted. The authors call these seers, \\"Cassandras\\" after the Greek mythological figure who could foretell disaster but was cursed to never be believed. The authors propose a method to separate accurate predictions of danger from inaccurate doomsayers, \\"The Cassandra Coefficient.\\" They then investigate experts who today are warning of future disasters—the threats from artificial intelligence, bio-hacking, mutating viruses, and more—and whose calls are not being heeded. The concluding chapter describes how individuals and organizations can employ the Cassandra Coefficient, hedging and \\"sentinel intelligence,\\" to watch potential disasters so as to not be surprised by them, and expend the necessary remediative resources only when necessary. Reception Warnings was lauded and recommended by President Bill Clinton (who noted it on his recommended reading list), Henry Kissinger, Sen. George Mitchell, Gen. Michael Hayden, Commissioner William J. Bratton, Lawrence Wright, and other notables. It was a Publishers Weekly best seller, the #1 Best Seller on Amazon in four categories, and a top 15 seller of all books on Amazon. The book enjoyed positive reviews in The Washington Times, Real Clear Life, Kirkus, and on Good Morning America, the Tucker Carlson Show on Fox, and numerous other venues. Warnings won the Axiom 2018 Business Book of the year, silver medal. In her book What Happened and subsequent interviews, Hillary Clinton referred to Warnings and noted the value the Cassandra Theory could have had to encourage decision makers to take the Russian hacking threat in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election more seriously.

The Dollies are known for their loud and colourful costumes, spectacular dance scenes and their comical but incisive approach to contemporary social issues in Singapore. Denise Tan is the new member of the group completing the trio after the death of Emma Yong in 2012. History The trio began in 2002 with a show at the opening of the Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay, A Single Woman. 2003 saw them perform to a sold-out crowd in the immensely well received Steaming!, which was followed by Revenge of the Dim Sum Dollies in 2004, Dim Sum Dollies: Singapore's Most Wanted in 2005, and Dim Sum Dollies: The History of Singapore! in 2007. In 2006, they lent their names to Glen Goei's adaptation of the off-Broadway musical comedy Little Shop of Horrors performed at Victoria Theatre. According to local director Ivan Heng, the name \\"Dim Sum Dollies\\" was chosen because dim sum comes in threes, \\"each morsel painstakingly prepared to please eye and palate\\". This description describes the trio's presentation style on stage, which combines visually spectacular sets and costumes with an original take on all things Singaporean. The Dim Sum Dollies show Dim Sum Dollies: The History of Singapore Part 2 at the Esplanade Theatre, Esplanade – Theatres on the Bay, in December 2014 The Dim Sum Dollies are well-remembered for boldly addressing contemporary Singaporean issues in a light-hearted manner. The 2004 instalment, Revenge of the Dim Sum Dollies, had the Dollies dressed up as Filipino maids in a fog-filled heaven (all of them apparently died after falling off ledges while cleaning their employers' windows). In a review by local playwright Alfian Sa'at, he notes with regards to this scene that \\"there has been an alarming trend of such accidental deaths in Singapore in the past year, and when the audience laughed, it was laughter laced with hurt. This was an instance, so prized in theatre, where one could provoke such contradictory emotions.\\" Other memorable scenes that year saw the Dollies touching on the plight of much-maligned traffic wardens in \\"Parking Pontianaks\\" and donning the trademark kebaya worn by Singapore Airlines stewardesses in \\"Singapore Girl\\". In 2005's Dim Sum Dollies: Singapore's Most Wanted, the Dollies came on stage dressed up as food court aunties in one scene, while other segments had them satirizing the National Kidney Foundation Singapore scandal and exploring issues such as slimming centres and the Merlion. Dim Sum Dollies performed in the Love Amplified concert, a concert held in Singapore to commemorate World AIDS Day 2008. The concert was held at Fort Canning Park, Singapore on 29 November 2008. In 2010, they appointed as ambassadors for gracious campaign by the Public Transport Council with support from the Singapore Kindness Movement. The theme called \\"Love Your Ride\\", similar to the earlier \\"A Happy Journey Starts Like That\\" by Phua Chu Kang in 2009. Several jingles were recorded for the campaign. Emma Yong died of stomach cancer at the age of 36 in May 2012. Fellow actress Janice Koh said: \\"We have lost a beautiful actress and one of our most talented performers and singers tonight.

Two styles of rolling pin are found: rollers and rods. Roller types consists of a thick cylinder with small handles at each end; rod type rolling pins are usually thin tapered batons. Rolling pins of different styles and materials offer varying advantages, as they are used for different tasks in cooking and baking. Types of rolling pins A tapered (top) and straight (bottom) \\"rod\\" type rolling pins *Rod: Thin rods typically made of wood around 2–3 cm in diameter. They are used by rolling the rod across the dough using one's palm. The pins may be tapered at one or both ends for more pivot control in certain tasks such as making small jiaozi skins or pie shells. Most East Asian or French style rolling pins, and the Turkish Oklava are rod-style. *Roller: Consists of a thick heavy roller made of a variety of materials around 7–10 cm in diameter with thinner handles which extend through the roller. They are used by grasping the handles and pushing the pin across the dough. Many Western rolling pins are roller types. *Textured: Some specialized rolling pins have textured surfaces that mark and indents the dough surfaces for special breads and pancakes. They may even be embossed with writing. A wooden belan rolling pin is used on a round chakla to make chapatis * Chakla belan: In Indian cuisine, the rolling pin (belan) is used in combination with a chakla (flat circular rolling board). The dough for chapatis is rolled on the chakla with the help of the belan.Nandita Godbole, 2016, Roti: Easy Indian Breads & Sides.Chitra Agrawal, 2017, Vibrant India: Fresh Vegetarian Recipes from Bangalore to Brooklyn, page 35.

He played one more match in 1884 and then played a fuller season in 1886 and 1887. Between 1888 and 1893, Derbyshire games were not first-class, but Sugg continued playing regularly. In 1894, he scored 121 in a miscellaneous match against the South Africans at the County Ground, Derby before being run out. In 1895, he scored 104 not out against Leicestershire. His benefit match, against Yorkshire at Queen's Park, Chesterfield in 1898, was renowned for the then world record first wicket partnership of Yorkshire's Brown and Tunnicliffe which eclipsed all previous records to post 554. In the 1899 season Sugg scored 107 against Worcestershire. Sugg scored 3,469 runs at 17.17 in 218 innings in 129 first-class matches.

This episode is based on the novel of the same name by Bernard Cornwell. Plot It is 1813. The First Battalion of the South Essex Regiment has suffered terrible losses in the fighting in Spain and the entire regiment is in danger of being disbanded as a result. Major Sharpe (Sean Bean) and Sergeant Major Harper (Daragh O'Malley) are sent back to England to find out why replacements have not been sent. Sharpe is told that the Second Battalion of the South Essex is drawing pay for over 700 soldiers, but when he arrives at the Second Battalion's barracks, he finds only eleven men, even though there is regular recruiting for the regiment. Sharpe is determined to get to the bottom of things. During an audience with the dimwitted Prince Regent (Julian Fellowes), Sharpe is introduced to Lord Fenner (Nicholas Farrell), the man responsible for the regiment's troubles. Fenner insists that the Second Battalion exists only on paper as a means of paying troops who have been scattered for various reasons until they can be placed into a proper unit. Fenner sends Lady Anne Camoynes (Caroline Langrishe) to sleep with Sharpe and ascertain his intentions. When he finds out, he sends assassins to solve his potential problem, but Sharpe and Harper dispose of them instead. Their bodies are tossed into the river, and Sharpe sees to it that rumours are spread that it was he and Harper who have been killed. Meanwhile, the two men \\"enlist\\" in the Second Battalion to find out what happens to the recruits. They are trained by the brutal and effete Lieutenant Colonel Girdwood (Mark Lambert) and then auctioned off to other regiments by Sharpe's old enemy, Sir Henry Simmerson (Michael Cochrane), with Fenner getting a kickback. Simmerson's niece, Jane Gibbons (Abigail Cruttenden), helps Sharpe and Harper escape afterwards. Sharpe goes to Horse Guards to see the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, the Duke of York, but learns that the Duke is not in London. Sharpe sees his old friend, Sir William Lawford, in whom he confides. Lawford, on his own initiative, approaches Fenner and proposes a solution—the South Essex gets its men and Sharpe is given command of a rifle battalion and sent to North America. Lady Camoynes overhears and contacts Sharpe. She tells him that he needs proof of the sales and tells him that she wants to ruin Fenner, who gets sexual favors from her as a way of paying off the debts of her late husband, whom Fenner ruined. Sharpe and Harper return to Girdwood's training camp and take over, placing Girdwood under arrest, but they are unable to find any paperwork documenting the sales. Sharpe instructs Harper to complete the necessary paperwork, officially making the recruits part of the South Essex. Girdwood escapes and goes to Simmerson's estate, where he collects the incriminating paperwork, and then heads to Simmerson's London house. Sharpe arrives at Simmerson's house too late to stop Girdwood, but he sees an invitation to a party hosted by the Prince of Wales. Sharpe also learns from Jane that Simmerson regularly beats her (her father was a lowly saddler), and Sharpe rashly proposes marriage as a way of enabling her to escape Simmerson's abuse. Jane agrees to try to steal the paperwork from Simmerson's house. Sharpe forms up the recruits of the Second Battalion and takes them to London, where they march in on the Prince of Wales's party, with Sharpe bearing the eagle he took at Talavera. The Prince gleefully claims them as his own, making the regiment the Prince of Wales Own Volunteers, instead of the South Essex. Sharpe confronts Lord Fenner, but does not have any proof, as Simmerson gave the paperwork to Fenner, who ordered it burnt. Just in time, Lady Camoynes shows up with ledgers—which she saved from the fire—detailing the crimes and uses them for blackmail for herself and for Sharpe. Simmerson, due to his influential friends, once more escapes prosecution. To shelter Jane from Simmerson's wrath, Sharpe becomes engaged to her. Thanks to Lady Camoyne's blackmail of Fenner, Sharpe gets the men he came for and goes back to fight in Spain, saving the regiment from being deleted from the army list. The regiment is now under the command of Colonel Girdwood, which Sharpe also specifically requested. In Spain, Girdwood has a close encounter with a French artillery round during an attack on the French border and suffers a mental breakdown as a result. He is invalided home, and Sharpe takes command of the Prince of Wales Own Volunteers, leading them on to victory.

The business grew to more than 57 stores in the Great Lakes Region and elsewhere. Sanders retailers sold candy, fudge toppings, and baked goods, as well as light lunches and an assortment of desserts at fountain counters, including Ice Cream Sodas, Sundaes and Hot Fudge Cream Puffs. In 2002 Morley Candy Makers purchased the Sanders name and original recipes to add to its own tradition since 1919. History The company was founded by German-born Frederick Sanders Schmidt on June 17, 1875, when he opened a candy store with nothing besides his childhood dreams, a barrel of borrowed sugar and a leased shop on Woodward Avenue at Gratiot in downtown Detroit. Schmidt, who went by his middle name, had originally opened his first shop in Chicago but relocated to Detroit after his Chicago store was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1871. Ice cream was soon added to the menu, then baked goods and sweet cream sodas. One popular story asserts that on a hot summer day, the store was packed with thirsty customers, and Sanders noticed that the sweet cream used for the sodas had gone sour. So he quickly substituted ice cream, and it became the talk of the town. Sanders is among those who claim to have invented the ice cream soda. Business became so brisk that the store expanded and Sanders hired more employees. “The Pavilion of Sweets,” Sanders’ most famed confectionery shop, opened on Woodward in 1891. It had a red and white awning and tower that was similar to a mosque. It was here that the nation’s first ice cream soda was supposedly born, though Sanders is not the only man to stake his claim for inventing the drink. One evening during the summer of 1876, Sanders ran out of fresh cream for his cream sodas. In an effort to please the store full of eager customers, he used a scoop of ice-cream instead. His patrons were thrilled with the taste and word of the new beverage spread. The substitution of ice cream for regular cream became a customary offering at soda fountains and stores throughout the nation. In addition to candy and the ice cream soda, hot fudge became one of Sanders’ prime products. Like other Sanders treats, the recipe was passed down through generations. Another especially sought after treat that has delighted \\"sweet tooths\\" for years is Sanders’ “Bumpy Cake,” named for the chocolate ganache that covers thick ridges of buttercream. Before long, Sanders had cornered the candy market in the Motor City. The company started a chain of stand-alone neighborhood candy stores, some featuring counters that also served light lunches and soda fountain drinks. The chain also expanded into shopping centers and the Detroit Free Press reported “In 1962, when John Sanders, great-grandson of the founder, took over the company from his father, Sanders had 111 stores and more than $20 million a year in sales.” However, the real world eventually caught up with the family-owned company, and the 1970s and 1980s saw many ups and downs with the struggling firm. “Trouble began in the mid-1970s,” the Detroit Free Press reported, “as Sanders faced increasing competition. The decline became clear when the company closed its flagship downtown store. Sanders ultimately went through several different owners, and at one point was forced to file for bankruptcy. Sanders closed most of its lunch counters and its headquarters in Highland Park. The company restructured itself by selling its products directly to grocery stores. The company was purchased in 2002 by the Morley Candy Company, another Michigan-based confectionery firm, and under the new ownership, the Sanders retail outlets and products began making a comeback in the Detroit area. As of 2014, there were 9 Metro Detroit Sanders Chocolate & Ice Cream Shops and two additional retail outlets located on Mackinac Island, Michigan. In 2016, Detroit Free Press said, Sanders is becoming a \\"growing national player in desserts and candy.\\" Legacy Sanders had been one of the first businesses in Detroit to be open on Sunday. Although business would be good, Fred Sanders would eventually bow to pressure and close on Sundays. While the ice cream soda was the first signature menu item, Sanders would also become known for its dessert toppings, including hot fudge and classic caramel - using the original recipes passed down from generation to generation. Other popular menu items include the Hot Fudge Cream Puff, which Sanders still offers in its retails stores, and the Bumpy Cake (1912), a devil's food cake topped with \\"bumps\\" of buttercream and cloaked in chocolate ganache. Many consumers who no longer live in Michigan still place online orders for Bumpy Cake today. Ford Motor Company founder Henry Ford worked for Sanders, which was one of the first companies in Detroit to use electric motors to run equipment. As a new source of technology the motors would often break down. To remedy this, Fred Sanders hired Henry Ford, a young mechanic who worked at Edison Illuminating Company before he started Ford Motor Company. Fred Sanders was a true visionary. In the early 1900s the Sanders family owned one of the first electric automobiles; it provided much amusement for the early skeptics. The “electric“ seemed to have a temperamental streak; it would bring the family downtown in grand style, but once parked in front of the Sanders store it would refuse to run except in reverse. To commemorate the centennial of the company in 1975, Jack Sanders, great-grandson of the founder, invited then- Detroit mayor Coleman Young, the Detroit city council, and other Detroit celebrities to create their favorite ice cream desserts. Sanders also recreated an 1890s horse-drawn wagon that crisscrossed the Detroit area to celebrate the centennial. The Detroit Historical Society honored Sanders that same year for innovations that included the first carry-out service, the low stools and counters, and the use of dry ice to keep ice cream cold. Sanders now once again offers its ice cream in retail stores across the United States and provides hand-dipped scoops at its own Sanders Chocolate & Ice Cream Shops in Michigan.

He was born Mortimer Lieberman in Chicago, but was best known by the pen name he adopted as a young newspaper editor. With Jack Lait, he co-authored a popular series of books detailing crime in the United States, including New York Confidential, Chicago Confidential, Washington Confidential, and U.S.A. Confidential. His father Nathan Lieberman was born October 12, 1873 in Ukraine and emigrated in 1890. His mother, Rose, was born in Sweden in 1885, and immigrated to the United States in 1899. The couple had one other child, Robert Lieberman, born in Chicago in 1914, who was a promotions agent for The Chicago Tribune - New York News Syndicate. Nathan Lieberman brought his family to New York in the early 1920s, and founded a clothing firm. He died in 1955, at the age of 82. Mortimer Lieberman attended Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, then moved to New York City, going to work as an editor for Amusements Magazine adopting the pen name Lee Mortimer. Broadway columnist Walter Winchell, in a March 12, 1931 column, called out Mortimer for having reported that Winchell was changing newspapers, reporting that Mortimer, \\"an up and coming youngster now editing Amusements for Donald Flamm, goes a little gay with facts too, however, when he reports that I am shifting rags.\\" In 1932, Mortimer began his long-term association with the New York Mirror, working for editor Jack Lait, with whom he later penned a series of bestselling crime books. At the Mirror, Mortimer was installed as a reporter and critic, and later began a long-running Broadway gossip column. His association with Marcus Loew's theater publicist and nightclub impresario Nils Granlund led to introductions to speakeasy club owners of the Prohibition Era, as sources for his Broadway material. Mortimer found a close ally in Nils Granlund, who managed WHN radio and broadcast live jazz performances from NYC nightclubs, and by 1939, Mortimer had his own radio program on WMCA, a station owned by Flamm. Mortimer made appearances regularly at Granlund-staged events, and eventually produced Granlund-style dance revues for New York City nightclubs. Mortimer served as a first lieutenant in the Signal Corps from 1942 to 1943, then returned to New York City and began a collaboration with Jack Lait that produced several bestselling crime books. Following that success, Mortimer began lecturing on crime and communism, and at one point attempted to tie popular singer Frank Sinatra to the Mafia and the Communist Party. The two men had a confrontation in Hollywood on April 9. With Jack Lait, Mortimer wrote a series of books, including \\"New York: Confidential,\\" \\"Washington: Confidential,\\" \\"Chicago: Confidential,\\" \\"U.S.A. Confidential\\", and the science fiction short story \\"Mars Confidential\\". On his own, he wrote \\"New York Behind the Scenes\\" and \\"Women: Confidential.\\" Following the publication of \\"U.S.A.: Confidential,\\" Mortimer and Lait were charged in separate libel lawsuits by Margaret Chase Smith and Augustine B. Kelley, members of Congress. The $500,000 suit by Kelley was settled after Mortimer and the estate of Jack Lait offered written apologies and paid costs associated with the litigation. It was in 1961 when I first went to his apartment to pick up copy for that days column. He opened the door and I saw a completely Oriental apartment. You had to step down to enter the apartment. He came to the door in a kimono. Mortimer died of a heart attack in 1963, ironically the year the Mirror stopped publishing.

This has been repeated only by Fitzroy with Matthew Rendell, Bernie Quinlan and Michael Conlan in 1983 against North Melbourne. * In shocking conditions in Round 12, Carlton and Geelong played the first match since the 1927 Grand Final where both teams scored three or fewer goals. Both teams’ scores were lower than any score from any other game during 1977. In the same round, North Melbourne's Malcolm Blight missed a set shot for goal after the final siren at the Arden Street Oval, which resulted in Hawthorn winning the game. * In Round 16, Geelong beat Collingwood despite having fifteen fewer scoring shots. This equalled Richmond's record against Fitzroy from 1957. * In the Reserve and Under-19 Grades, the appalling weather of mid- to late June caused the only cancellation (as opposed to postponement) of matches in VFL/AFL history until 2015. These cancellations affected Round 14 in the Reserves and Round 13 in the Under-19s. * South Melbourne played in its last finals series before relocating to Sydney, as well as its first final series since 1970, and only its second since the infamous 1945 \\"bloodbath\\" grand final. * Collingwood became the first VFL/AFL team to win the Minor Premiership after winning the wooden spoon the year before. * North Melbourne is the only team to play twenty-seven matches in a VFL/AFL season. With the abolition of grand final replays in 2016, this record will remain indefinitely, as the current AFL fixture allows for a maximum of 26 matches (22 home and away matches plus four finals). John Cassin was the only player to play in all 27 matches. See also * McIntyre \\"Final Five\\" system References * Stephen Rogers and Ashley Brown (1998). Every Game Ever Played. 6th ed.

He has had a peripatetic career, playing for a number of clubs in Argentina, Spain, Mexico and Brazil after starting out at Vélez Sarsfield. Escudero was an Argentina youth international. Club career Escudero was born in Rosario, Santa Fe. A product of Club Atlético Vélez Sarsfield's youth system, he made his first-team debut in a 0–1 away defeat against Newell's Old Boys on 4 March 2006. He found himself at the centre of a controversy at the end of the year, when the club refused to release him and Mauro Zárate for the 2007 South American Youth Championship. When the 2007 edition of the Copa Libertadores started, Escudero was already a dynamic part in the team's attacking movements. He helped Vélez reach the round-of-16 in the tournament, scoring four goals. Escudero had an irregular 2007–08 season, during which his team failed to qualify for the Copa Sudamericana. However, he did net three times in the Clausura, including once against Boca Juniors. For 2008–09, Escudero was bought by Spanish La Liga side Villarreal CF in a US$12,000,000 move.Escudero, encantado de recalar en el Villarreal (Escudero, delighted to have joined Villarreal); Marca, 4 July 2008 (in Spanish) He was quickly loaned to Real Valladolid because his club's non-EU quota was already full,Escudero llega cedido para potenciar el ataque (Escudero arrives on loan to strengthen offense); Diario AS, 12 July 2008 (in Spanish)Mientras tramita los papeles... (Paperwork pending...); ESPN Deportes, 5 July 2008 (in Spanish) appearing rarely throughout the campaign due to injury.Escudero: \\"Tengo muchas ganas de volver a jugar\\" (Escudero: \\"I want to play again so badly\\"); Marca, 9 September 2009 (in Spanish) Escudero returned to Villarreal for 2009–10, but continued to be barred by the likes of Robert Pires and Santi Cazorla. Most of his appearances were due to injury problems to the latter, and he scored against Xerez CD on 14 March 2010 (2–0 home win) after only playing six minutes in the game.El Villarreal perdona primero la goleada y termina sufriendo frente al Xerez (2–0) (Villarreal start by forgiving rout then end suffering against Xerez (2–0)); El Mundo, 14 March 2010 (in Spanish) In June 2010, Escudero was sold to Boca Juniors, with Villarreal retaining 50% of the player's rights.El argentino Escudero vuelve a casa: Ficha por Boca Juniors (Argentine Escudero returns home: Signs for Boca Juniors); Marca, 22 June 2010 (in Spanish) The following year he was loaned to Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense and performed solidly but, after the two clubs could not agree on a transfer fee for another loan, he returned to Buenos Aires. In January 2012, Escudero returned to Brazil signing a one-year contract with Clube Atlético Mineiro, who paid Boca US$700.000. Apart from a one-year spell in the Mexican Liga MX with Puebla F.C. he continued to play in the country in the following years, with Esporte Clube Vitória, CR Vasco da Gama and Cuiabá Esporte Clube. International career In 2007, Escudero was selected in the Argentina under-20 squad to compete in the FIFA World Cup in Canada, but hardly played due to injury. The following year, he first played for the Olympic side against Guatemala in preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympics, appearing as a left back in the 5–0 rout.5–0.

Prisoner transport is the transportation of prisoners by law enforcement agencies or contractors. In order to extradite a suspected or convicted criminal from one jurisdiction to another, a rendition aircraft may be used, although the high cost involved means that it is normally used only to transport the most dangerous of prisoners; more commonly, a person being extradited would simply be put onto a commercial airliner, albeit escorted by law enforcement officers. One notable example of a prisoner transported on a commercial airliner was that of Christopher Tappin, a Briton extradited to the United States in February 2012 to face American charges of selling arms parts to Iran. Tappin was flown on United Airlines flights from London Heathrow Airport to El Paso, Texas via Houston accompanied, but not handcuffed, by US Marshals at all times. After arriving in El Paso, Tappin was transported to Otero County jail in New Mexico before his first court hearing in El Paso. Tappin would be subsequently remanded to the UK in September 2013 to serve 14 months at HM Wandsworth in South London before he was paroled from prison in May 2014 on the condition he wear an ankle monitor for the remainder of his sentence.  Issues  A Cell Van used by UK Immigration Enforcement to safely transport offenders Prisoner transport is risky due to the fact that dangerous inmates are temporarily introduced into a public environment. Specially designed prisoner transport vehicles are used to fulfill security requirements. Many inmates see this time as an opportunity to escape. Some inmates prepare for escape during transport by bringing along tiny objects (e.g. paper clips) that can be used to pick the locks of their handcuffs prior to escape from the vehicles. Law enforcement agencies, aware of this, often take extra security measures on inmates being transported, especially those who are more prone to escape or violence. This includes additional forms of restraint on the bodies, more secure vehicles, and escorts from additional law enforcement agents. Many transports are started at night to minimize the chance of harm to civilians. Prisoner in leg irons  Restraints  Prisoner in handcuffs with a alt= As a safeguard against escape, prisoners are routinely placed in physical restraints for transport. The type of restraints used depends on the security level of the prisoners and may vary from department to department. As a rule, most prisoners will have to wear at least handcuffs as a minimum restraint. Often, a belly chain is added so that the prisoner's hands are shackled to the waist. Leather or nylon belts may be used instead of belly chains. To prevent the prisoner from manipulating the keyhole of the handcuffs, for instance if he or she gets hold of a handcuff key or a lockpick, a handcuff cover may be placed around the handcuffs. The additional precaution of leg irons may also be taken, particularly if the prisoner will be walking outside of a secure area. When a prisoner is shackled at his or her hands, legs, and around his or her waist, this is commonly known as being placed in \\"full restraints\\". Prisoner in transport restraints Specific prisoner transport restraints (e.g. Smith & Wesson model 1850 transport restraint) are combinations which consist of a pair of handcuffs, attached by a longer chain to a pair of leg irons. When being placed in such transport restraints, the prisoner will still have the possibility to manage normal steps, but is prevented from running by the leg irons. The connecting chain also prevents the prisoner from lifting his or her arms. For transporting prisoners by car, special combinations called auto restraints are used where the chains of the leg irons as well as the connecting chains are shortened, allowing the prisoner only a stooping shuffling walk when he or she is outside the car. In addition to restraints, a stun belt may be fastened around the prisoner's waist for further control. In the event of the prisoner attempting to escape or attack someone, the escorting officers can activate the belt via a remote control to give the subject an electric shock.  Clothing  When going on a transport, prisoners will in most cases have to wear a Prison uniform to make them instantly identifiable. Sometimes, special high- visibility jackets are added for enhanced security.

The Svartholm fortress (; ) was built between 1749 and 1764 outside Loviisa in Southern Finland by Augustin Ehrensvärd. The fortress, which lies at the mouth of the Bay of Loviisa, along with the planned land fortress at Loviisa, would have prevented invading Russian forces from entering what was then Swedish territory in present-day Finland.  Construction  After Swedish defeats in the Great Northern War as well as in the Russo-Swedish War of 1741-1743, there was a pressing need to construct fortifications to guard both the border as well as the coast of Finland. By 1745 Degerby (later Lovisa - ) was deemed to be a suitable location for a border fortification and to protect it from hostile naval forces a seafortress at Svartholm was required to be built. Main base of operations and a base for Swedish naval forces would be built to Sveaborg (). Plans for the fortifications were prepared by Lieutenant-Colonel Augustin Ehrensvärd, who was also tasked with constructing the fortresses in 1747. Construction started in 1748 and continued with increasing tempo as the external political situation deteriorated in 1749 and 1750. Over half of the Swedish army in Finland was tasked with the construction and in 1750 more than 6,000 men were working on the fortifications at Svartholm and Sveaborg. Ehrensvärd had tasked first Captain O. R. Clansenstierna and later (1751-1757) Lieutenant-Colonel Fabian Casimir Wrede with the construction efforts at Degerby and Svartholm who had in 1751 around 2 000 workers at their disposal. While the plans for the fortifications around the town had to be cut short it did not hinder the construction of Svartholm. King Adolf Frederick visited the site in 1751 which was renamed from Degerby to Lovisa () after his wife Louisa Ulrika during his reign. Like at Sveaborg the Swedish participation to the Seven Years' War brought construction effort to a standstill. Work on the fortifications continued in the 1770s and after Ehrensvärd died were led in 1773-1774 by Jacob Magnus Sprengtporten but after his break with the King Gustav III works slowed down again. In 1775 works at fortifications around Lovisa were stopped when of the six planned bastions, only two were ready and efforts at Svartholm slowed further down and in 1778 only some minor construction took place. In 1788 when new war against Russia started the main fort of Svartholm was completed but the breastworks were not.  Swedish service  The sea fortress Svartholm: 1\\\\. Main Gate 2\\\\.

Non-completed ravelins While Svartholm had been constructed as a seafortress it had never been designed to act as a naval base and had only its guns to offer as a support for the naval forces. Order to prepare the fort was issued already on 22 May 1788. While Svartholm did not really see any action in the Russo-Swedish War of 1788–1790 it did act as important staging ground and rallying point during several stages of the war. The fortress at Svartholm was still not ready in 1808, when the Finnish War erupted, and two-thirds of the guns and mortars were available. It had however been noted already in the 1760s, that it was not possible to place as many guns on the fortress as would be required to repulse a big attack from the sea. It had also been noted that the southern part left much to wish for. It was armed with 86 guns and 8 mortars and gad garrison of 700 men. However the fort had fallen into neglect with most of gun carriages having rotted away while others had not even had any carriages to begin with. Small arms were in similar condition and fort lacked both food and ammunition which had not been stocked in sufficient quantities. Commander of Svartholm before the war had been Captain Carl Gustaf von Schoultz who had to tend with badly trained garrison of which only third could be armed with a functional weapon. Garrison had low morale and bad discipline which was not improved by the sudden change of commander as Major Carl Magnus Gripenberg assumed command on 15 February. However Gripenberg was not highly appreciated by his superiors or his subordinates. Effort was however made to prepare the fort for the war but war started long before work on the fortress would have been completed. Ammunition was in short supply especially for 12- and 18-pounder guns. There was also shortage of food which was further complicated by the fact that the drinking water was also limited as several of the wells had been found unusable. Lovisa was the first goal of the Russians in the Finnish War (1808–1809), and the Russian main force crossed the border at Abborrfors on February 21, 1808. The Russians quickly encircled Svartholm already on 22 February 1808 and demanded surrender which was refused by the Swedes. On 23 February additional Russian forces were brought in to besiege the fort bringing Russian strength to around 1 700 men. However messengers could still reach the fort and it took until 28 February before Russian cossack patrols cut the final routes to the fort. Russians attempted first on 2 March and on 8 March to get the fortress to surrender by negotiations but Swedes refused. When Russian artillery started bombarding the fort it soon became apparent that only 8 of the whole forts guns could be brought to shoot at the Russians as the narrow firing slits made it impossible to use the rest of the guns. Fort was already suffering from the siege with one sixth of the garrison sick and having shortage of warm clothing and food. Morale crept even lower and officers feared mutiny. On 11 March Gripenberg suggested truce of six weeks which the Russians Major General Muchanoff promptly rejected but agreed for a truce of three days after which hostilities would continue anew. Gripenberg agreed to a surrender on 14 March before the truce had run out. On 17 March Russian General commanding the armies in Finland, Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden, accepted the surrender. Swedes surrendered the fortress with all its weapons intact to the Russians who in turn agreed just to dismiss the mostly Finnish garrison of Svartholm. The reasons for the capitulation are somewhat unclear but it seems like the Swedish officers didn't believe in the Swedish capability, nor the fortress' capability to withstand the Russians in this war. As many of the other Swedish officers, Gripenberg entered Russian service after the capitulation. He was labeled a traitor in Sweden and was sentenced to death, along with other officers, for the loss of Finland. Due to a general amnesty, the death penalty process was interrupted, also for him.  Russian service  Svartholma lost its strategic importance during the Russian period. It was then used partly as a military base and partly as a prison for Finnish prisoners. During the Crimean War, British HMS Arrogant and HMS Magicienne on July 7, 1855 under the command of Captain Hastings Yelverton came up to the fortress. As soon as the British squadron appeared, the fortress was evacuated by the Russians and its armament removed, Captain Yelverton blew up everything that remained.History of War against Russia However, large parts survived the war. Svartholma continued to serve as a good harbor and a goal for weekend picnics. The Finnish National Board of Antiquities were restoring the castle since the 1960s, and the work was finally ready in 1998.

Africar Design They were initially to have Citroën engines and drivetrains, until such time as Africar's own engine and drive train was fully developed. The bodywork was to be made of epoxy-coated wood – the 'West' system used in the construction of some yachts – which could be repaired with locally-available labour and materials. The wood for building the cars was to be obtained from sustainably-managed forests. Production A company, Africar International Limited, was set up in 1986 to make and sell the vehicles. Based in Lancaster, England, it intended to offer a variety of vehicles, ranging from a four-wheel drive car to an eight-wheel-drive panel truck. There was considerable interest in the vehicles and their potential, both from firms who saw the commercial possibilities of the project, and from users who appreciated the vehicles' capabilities. Only 6 Africars ever made it into production. Promotion Three versions were actually completed, an estate car, a pickup and a six-wheeler and these were tested in 1984 on an expedition from the Arctic Circle in Norway to the equator. A Channel 4 television programme was made of this. There was also a book, entitled \\"Africar\\" to accompany the series. Failure The project foundered because of financial difficulties, and in July 1988 the company ceased trading. Legacy The car was never properly tested by market forces but interest, even in the UK, demonstrated that it was an attractive, capable vehicle. Founder's fate The company's founder and sometime owner, Tony Howarth, was arrested in 1994 and charged with fraudulent trading and obtaining property by deception. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 15 months' imprisonment. The project briefly resurfaced as the Bedouin.

Biography Born in Bay City, Michigan, Avis graduated from Bay City Central High School in 1933, and served in the United States Army Air Forces during the Second World War. When he got out, he bought a stake in a Ford dealership and began his plan to rent cars at airports. He said that he got the idea when as a pilot he could not find ground transport at airports.Warren Avis, car rental pioneer, dies at 92 Although he did not technically invent the rental car business, he ensured its future by deciding to locate his offices at airports instead of the downtown areas or central business districts where others were then located.

Warren Avis: His idea led to airport rental car firms. Detroit Free Press He sold the company in 1954 for $8 million. Avis established his business credentials by positioning himself as a capable negotiator between the major automotive companies and their union leaders and rank-and-file members. His unique approach, which became the subject for several of his books, involved soliciting ideas from an assembled group of stakeholders that could range from the C.E.O. to the lowest-level hourly worker, accept their ideas in anonymous fashion, combine them where overlapping and present them to the assembled group for discussion without attribution. Avis felt that ownership of ideas led to unnecessary championing by the idea's owner and that underlings would needlessly defer to upper-tier managers and executives. His process yielded spirited discussion by attendees and inevitable consensus in most instances on those ideas that prevailed. Avis would later head Avis Enterprises which invested in high tech electronic companies.Warren Avis In addition his real estate holdings at what was known as Avis Farms on the south side of Ann Arbor, Michigan were converted to commercial offices and industrial parks.

Initial signals that Blair's leadership was to end On 30 September 2004, Tony Blair said he would not seek a fourth term as Prime Minister. Labour went on to win a third successive term at the May 2005 General Election with a decreased majority of 66, with Blair pledging to serve another full term. Labour and Blair subsequently had a surge in popularity at the time of terrorist bombings of London of July 2005, but by the Spring of 2006 were facing significant difficulties, most notably with scandals over failures by the Home Office to deport illegal immigrants and national campaigns by many political parties and think tanks saying that the United Kingdom was being overrun by immigrants. Worries over the potential increase of support for the British National Party during the 2006 Local Election campaign saw many Labour backbenchers and activists begin to demand a timetable from Blair for his departure, with many suggesting that it should be sooner rather than later. Speculation over the timing of Blair's resignation had been amplified by a variety of politicians and newspapers making their own predictions. On 21 April The Guardian reported that the Brown camp were working on the assumption that Blair would announce the candidacy open on 9 May 2007, the day after power-sharing was due to start in Northern Ireland, following which the new Labour leader would be elected on 15 July 2007. Talk of David Miliband, Alan Milburn, Charles Clarke or John Reid as possible candidates was almost constant, although the former consistently denied any ambition to stand and the latter three refused to make a decision until there was a vacancy, ultimately declining in the week before Blair requested the NEC to find a successor. Demands for Tony Blair to announce a resignation timetable On 15 July 2006, John McDonnell became the first Labour MP to announce an intention to stand for the leadership when Blair resigned. On 5 September 2006, 17 Labour MPs signed a letter asking Blair to resign, accompanied by press reports alleging that up to 80 MPs were willing to sign. Later, senior party members stated that Tony Blair would not be Prime Minister at the next Labour Party conference and on 6 September, Tom Watson, one of the MPs who signed the letter, resigned as Junior Defence Minister along with seven Parliamentary Private Secretaries: Khalid Mahmood, Wayne David, Ian Lucas, Mark Tami, Chris Mole, David Wright and Iain Wright. On 7 September, Jack Straw stated that he expected the Prime Minister to announce a timetable for his departure in May 2007 and Blair announced that the September 2006 Labour Party Conference and TUC Conference would be the last he would attend as party leader, despite which he was heckled at the Trades Union Congress on 12 September by members calling for him to resign immediately. On 23 September, John Hutton became the first serving Cabinet Minister to say that Gordon Brown should face a serious challenger for Labour's leadership. At the 2006 Labour Party Conference on 25 September, Brown announced his candidacy for the leadership, while three days later at the same conference John Prescott announced that he would stand down when Blair resigned as Prime Minister. During the debate on The Queen's Speech on 15 November, Blair said Conservative leader David Cameron was a \\"flyweight against a heavyweight\\" at the next general election, widely interpreted as implicit support for Brown Campaigning commences In January 2007, Brown outlined a number of his potential policies for Britain, mentioning citizen responsibility, education, efforts to solve problems in Africa and \\"a new style of politics\\" as his priorities. On 17 January, he spoke of \\"a new world order\\" while on a tour of India, and announced backing for India's bid for a place as a permanent member on the UN Security Council, and on many other international bodies. On 21 March, at 12:30 pm, he delivered the budget for the 2007–08 financial year, his last budget as Chancellor of the Exchequer. On 16 January, Blair declared his intention to attend a summit of EU leaders as Prime Minister on 21–22 June 2007, and on 28 January stated that he was \\"not finished yet\\", and intended to complete the public sector reforms he had started, as well as leading Labour into local and devolved Elections on 3 May. On 17 January, left-wing MP John McDonnell claimed that support for his leadership challenge had grown to within striking distance of the necessary backing. Michael Meacher, former Minister of State for the Environment in the DETR and its successor Defra announced that he was also seeking nominations from MPs and was considering standing. On 22 February he became the third Labour MP to announce his intention to stand for the leadership, although critics in the media expressed doubt over the extent of backbench support for either challenger at this point. On 2 March, Jack Straw casually declined to run for the leadership after reports that someone had placed a £500 bet on his winning. On 20 March, the Labour Party NEC met to decide on rules for the upcoming leadership elections. On 13 April, Brown met US President George W. Bush for the first time, in a reportedly amicable discussion. On 15 April he encouraged rivals to \\"bring it on\\", in response to numerous reports suggesting that he would face three or four contenders for the leadership. David Miliband declared on 17 April that he would not be a candidate for the Labour leadership or Deputy leadership, and had not wavered in his position on that issue in the past three years. He subsequently announced his support for Brown in any leadership election. On 20 April, The Independent reported that many of Blair's closest allies were eager to unite the Blair and Brown camps and prevent any challenge to Gordon Brown from dividing the party. The next day, The Guardian reported that 217 MPs had already signed up to back Gordon Brown's leadership. There were also reports that even among the undecided, many were keen to prevent the progress of Michael Meacher and John McDonnell. On 27 April, Michael Meacher and John McDonnell agreed that whichever had fewer supporters the day after Blair resigned as Labour leader would step aside, to allow the other a stronger chance to secure the support of the 45 MPs necessary to qualify for the ballot paper. On 1 May, Blair announced that he would announce his resignation as Labour leader the following week, following which he expected a campaign of about seven weeks. He also announced his support for Brown to succeed him as Labour leader and Prime Minister. On 3 May, the day after Blair and Brown's tenth anniversary as Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer, elections were held for English and Scottish Local Government, the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly. Labour faced mixed results, making gains in some areas, with slightly higher support than the previous year in the Local Elections and fairly minimal losses in the devolved elections, remaining the largest party in Wales and having one less seat than the SNP in Scotland, while losing many English council seats, mainly to the Conservative Party. On 3 May, Charles Clarke changed his position towards Brown, praising him publicly and denying that he was poised to challenge for the Labour leadership. In an interview with The Times the following day, he claimed that he could get a sufficient number of nominations to stand for the Labour leadership, but that the Labour Party did not \\"have the appetite\\" for such a contest. John Reid and John Hutton also announced their support for Brown, Reid going on to announce that he would be stepping down as Home Secretary upon the departure of Blair and Prescott. Writing in the News of the World on 6 May, Blair said that while David Cameron had learned the tactics of opposition, Labour could still win the next General Election and that Brown had shown sound judgement in his steering of the economy, which was the way to win. On 9 May, in the last Prime Minister's Questions before Blair announced the vacancy for the Labour leadership, David Cameron described the Labour government as \\"like The Living Dead\\". Blair ignored Cameron's taunts regarding the possible chaos caused by interim arrangements for election of a new Labour leader and the upcoming resignation of John Reid from the government. Tony Blair asks Labour NEC to seek a new leader On 10 May Blair announced to the Sedgefield Labour Party that he would stand down as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007, and that he would be requesting Labour's NEC to seek a new party leader. Shortly afterwards, John Prescott announced that he would stand down as Deputy Prime Minister on the same day and that he had written to the NEC to announce his resignation as party Deputy Leader. Labour's NEC met on 13 May to finalise a timetable for the handover, confirming that Blair would remain leader until a new leader was elected, and giving any potential candidates three active Parliament days in which to submit their papers. Brown, Michael Meacher and John McDonnell held a joint policy debate in London. On 10 May, John McDonnell and Michael Meacher delayed a decision over which one should run, describing their respective levels of support as \\"too close to call\\". Interviewed by Red Pepper, John McDonnell stated that he could and would not support Michael Meacher, since he had voted with New Labour on many issues, and that it was a matter of them sitting down together to compare how many votes they had and decide a way forward. On 14 May Michael Meacher declared that he would not be a candidate in the Labour leadership election, since he did not have enough MPs support to get onto the ballot paper, going on to say he would be backing John McDonnell to get a left-wing candidate onto the ballot paper, though the possibility of this was still in doubt. On 10 May, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Peter Hain and Solicitor General Harriet Harman both announced that they had more than the minimum necessary number of nominations to appear on the Ballot paper for the Deputy Leadership Election, claiming 47 and 44 nominations respectively. Leadership elections As nominations opened on 15 May it became clear that Brown was well past the minimum requirement of nominations, with the support of around 282 MPs, while John McDonnell had only 27 nominations, still well short of the 45 required. In the Deputy Leadership Race, Harriet Harman, Hazel Blears, Peter Hain and Alan Johnson all had more than the minimum required nominations, with Jon Cruddas having 44 nominations and Hilary Benn 34. On 16 May John McDonnell alleged that many of Brown's supporters were using wrecking tactics to ensure that the decision did not proceed to a ballot. Later that day Brown secured 308 nominations, to John McDonnell's 29; although nominations were to be open for another day there were insufficient undeclared MPs remaining for anyone except Gordon Brown to be on the ballot, meaning he need only attend hustings and wait to be declared leader by the NEC. At this stage John McDonnell conceded defeat. In the Deputy Leadership Race, Jon Cruddas and Hilary Benn secured the required nominations. Nominations closed on 17 May, with Brown having secured 313 nominations compared to John McDonnell's 29. Harriet Harman (65 nominations), Hazel Blears (49 nominations), Peter Hain (51 nominations), Alan Johnson (73 nominations), Jon Cruddas (49 nominations) and Hilary Benn (47 nominations) all qualified to appear on the Deputy leadership ballot. At the husting at the University of Warwick on 20 May, Brown was heckled regarding the 2003 War in Iraq. He replied by saying that although there had been mistakes, it had been the right thing to do. Candidates for the Deputy Leadership election were asked which factors they considered important to the next General Election. Jon Cruddas named the issue of insecurity at work; Hilary Benn said that more housing was needed; Peter Hain described inequality as \\"the biggest challenge we face as a government\\"; Alan Johnson focused on social mobility; Hazel Blears mentioned education and employment opportunities; Harriet Harman said that Labour needed to \\"win back the trust and the confidence of the British people\\" and emphasised the importance of policy implementation. Blears, Harman and Benn all focused on the importance of party unity. At the Bradford husting on 27 May, Jan Wilson, leader of Sheffield City Council, told Gordon Brown that the shadow of Iraq hung over the party and that Brown had had an easy time on it during the leadership campaign. Brown said he was happy to discuss the decision to remove the Ba'athist regime, but that his priority now was to focus on the next steps, with numbers of UK troops decreasing and UK forces taking an \\"overwatch role\\". At the BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) husting in Leicester on 30 May, Deputy Leadership candidates were split on the question of whether there should be all-ethnic minority shortlists; Hazel Blears, Jon Cruddas and Peter Hain all backed the idea, to increase numbers of Black and Asian MPs. Alan Johnson said that shortlists could reflect a need for more ethnic minority MPs, but that he was not sure that all-minority shortlists were the answer, and Hilary Benn said that he was not persuaded of the case for such shortlists either. Harriet Harman made no comment on the issue, except to say that there needed to be more MPs from ethnic minorities. On 6 June, ballot papers were sent out to Labour MPs, Labour MEPs, Labour Party members and members of affiliated unions for the position of Deputy Leader of the Labour Party. At the Cardiff husting on 9 June, Brown described the Conservatives as caught between \\"what they think they should say\\" and \\"what they really believe\\". He accused them of being obsessed with Grammar schools, and said that parts of the Conservative Party wanted to scrap the NHS. He associated himself with decisions taken over the war in Iraq again, saying again that although mistakes had been made it had been the right thing to do. He also pledged that if necessary he would find more money to prevent job losses at Remploy, a provider of jobs for the disabled, and that promises made at the G8 summit to tackle poverty in Africa would be kept. At the Oxford Youth husting (for people under the age of 27) on 10 June, Gordon Brown said that Labour must modernise and reform again to further involve young people in decision making, including the use of online facilities such as MySpace. Hilary Benn was critical of Bob Geldof and defended the settlement of the recent G8 Summit in Germany, while Hazel Blears focused on anti-social behaviour. Peter Hain accused Home Secretary John Reid of \\"fanning up\\" the previous week's debate over possible introduction of new stop and search powers for police, saying \\"I don't believe in macho posturing on law and order and terrorism\\". Harriet Harman said that she felt the law needed changing to ensure that the government was informed if terrorist suspects en route to other countries faced the possibility of torture on arrival, and Jon Cruddas focused heavily on allegations of special rendition of terrorist suspects to Guantanamo Bay detention camp. Alan Johnson stated the need for testing in schools to assess how well schools and individual pupils were doing; Jon Cruddas agreed but said he felt that it had gone too far. The Deputy Leadership Ballot closed at 17:00 UTC+1 on 22 June. Brown was declared leader at a special conference on 24 June, while in an election on the Alternative Vote system, Harriet Harman won the Deputy Leadership by 50.4% to Alan Johnson's 49.6% after preferences were re-distributed, Jon Cruddas coming narrowly third. Harman had been behind until the last round of redistributions. Transition to Prime Minister Gordon Brown Tony Blair tendered his resignation as Prime Minister to the Queen on 27 June 2007 and Gordon Brown was asked by the Queen to form a new government. Unlike Blair with John Prescott, Brown opted to keep his new deputy, Harriet Harman, out of the position of Deputy Prime Minister.

The Game of Contemporaneity was originally inspired on Diego Rivera’s mural 'Dream on a Sunday Afternoon in the Central Alameda'. Oe's approach to history and story-telling, like in the mural, exposes the themes of simultaneity, ambiguity and thus complexity. The story centres itself around the alternative world of the dissident samurai, as opposed to that of the Emperor. The samurai turn into demons after being chased into the forest. The story of the village serves as a microcosmic representation of the history of the nation as a whole. It has its own creation myth and fertility goddess, as well as having a composite healer/trickster called: The One Who Destroys. Although the novel exposes the themes of marginalisation and outsiderhood, it also provides hope for a new beginning. This emphasizes the central theme of the novel: simultaneous ambiguity, in the amalgamation of past and present, fact and dream, as well as history and myth. Oe uses satire, parody and black humour to describe the many deeds and events of the samurai. This culminates in the Fifty-Day War, in which the samurai and the imperial army battle one another, with The One Who Destroys leading the battle against The No-Name Captain of the imperial guard. It ends in the samurai surrendering to avoid the destruction of the forest (mori). The word 'mori' in itself is ambivalent in that in Japanese it conjures an image of regeneration or rebirth and in Latin that of death. This novel has been considered as a main example of the current of magic realism in Japanese literature. Other Japanese authors with considerable literary contributions to this genre are: Abe Kobo, Yasunari Kawabata and Yasushi Inoue.

Plot The film begins with a sleepover of children. They prank call people while playing the game Seventy Five. Meanwhile, their parents are in the other room having drinks. The rules of the game are that you must keep a random person on the line for 75 seconds, and they must believe what you’re saying. As the night goes on, the kids go to bed, and a man whom the kids recently called calls back, before jumping from a closet and attempting to kill one of the kids before the parent jumped in front of him. The killer goes on to killing all the parents in the house with an axe. As the children hide in their bedrooms, the killer opens the closet to discover some of the kids and attempt to murder them before one of the kid’s mother is choked to death by the killer. He then hears police sirens and flees. He is never caught. Ten years later, Chuck (Josh Hammond) is murdered in his house by an unknown figure. Two detectives, Detective Anne Hastings (Gwendoline Yeo) and Detective John Criton (Rutger Hauer) discover Chuck was one of the children involved in the Waley murders 10 years previously. They begin an investigation and find more of the survivors have been murdered. Meanwhile, Brandon (Jonathan Chase) is throwing a party at his fathers secluded mansion. Brandon invites his ex-girlfriend, Karina (Judy Taylor), so he can try to get back together with her, but she insists that her group of friends also come, including Marcus (Brian Hooks), Roxy (Cherie Johnson), Shawn (Germán Legarreta), Kareem (Antwon Tanner), Scott (Wil Horneff) and Jody (Aimee Garcia). As the group arrive and the party starts, Brandon and his friend Cal (Austin Basis) show everyone around, revealing that the house is filled with cameras which can be monitored on screens in the monitoring room, due to the house previously being used as a reality show set. After a few hours of partying, Marcus suggests a game of Seventy Five. Various people take part, until one caller murders someone for the group to hear. They all decide to not answer the phone and continue with their night. As the party finishes and most people leave, Karina and Brandon reconcile. Becky (Ellen Woglom) and Julie (Soraya Kelley) stay up partying with two boys. However, the killer soon arrives at the house and decapitates Becky, before killing the boys and Julie. The killer proceeds to decapitate a boy in the hot tub before drowning his girlfriend. Kareem witnesses the murders and rounds up Roxy, Marcus and Anna (Denyce Lawton) to leave. The group split up to warn the others. Marcus and Anna find Jody and Cal, however they are soon attacked by the killer who murders Anna, while the others flee into Brandon and Karina's room. After Kareem and Roxy arrive with an unconscious Scott, who Kareem accidentally knocked out, the group lock themselves in the room. Brandon blames Marcus for the murders, causing a fight to break out. After a while of waiting, Brandon and Karina leave to retrieve keys for Brandon's car, while Marcus and Kareem search for Shawn. The killer soon attacks Brandon and Karina, and Brandon is eventually axed in the back, killing him. The killer then throws Karina off the balcony, however she survives and runs into the monitor room to hide. Meanwhile, Cal goes outside to try and hot wire a car. As he succeeds, the killer appears and beats him to death, although he does manage to summon help to the house. Marcus and Kareem return to the room only to find it empty, before discovering Roxy has been killed. They find Scott, but are soon attacked. However, Marcus and Kareem manage to overpower the killer and pin them to the ground. As Kareem urges Scott to kill him, he instead murders Kareem. Marcus hides in the monitor room with Karina, watching in horror as Jody and then Shawn are murdered. Scott soon comes to the monitoring room, with his accomplice (Kyle Turley), who is revealed to be an inmate from the mental hospital they both recently escaped from. He goes on to reveal that he is, in fact, Scott's twin brother, William, and that he murdered Scott before they left for the party. William tells Marcus he blames him for the deaths of his parents all those years ago as he was the one that wanted to play Seventy Five. William then turns on his accomplice, stabbing him, before a fight breaks out between him, Karina and Marcus. Eventually, William stabs Karina to death. While Marcus swings the axe to kill William, Detectives Anne and John arrive and shoot Marcus, believing he is the killer. As Anne and John comfort William, the accomplice rises with an axe and swings it towards the detectives.

Character's background Rita was first seen in late 2006 when she ran into Marlon Dingle, Donna Windsor-Dingle, Paddy Kirk and Toni Daggert in a night club in Hotten. She recognised Marlon straight away but he couldn't place her, but Paddy remembered her. It turned out that they met before, much to annoyance of Paddy's love interest, Toni. Paddy spent time with Rita in the club but when he saw Toni get rejected, he left Rita and went home with Toni. Rita wasn't seen again until Paddy went to an art class and when he saw Rita, he followed her. Much to Paddy's surprise, Rita stripped off and started posing. After the class, Paddy took Rita for a drink in the Woolpack. Rita gave Paddy her number by writing it on his hand but he foolishly didn't write it down and it got smudged, so he was unable to call her. Eventually, Paddy went back to the art class and explained to Rita what happened with the number and she accepted it. They planned to meet but a prank from the Dingles caused Paddy to get stuck in the middle of nowhere, but Rita came to the rescue. Paddy and Rita finally went on a date but it nearly came to an abrupt end but Marlon's cab nearly hit Rita, only to be saved by Paddy. From then on, Rita wouldn't stop talking about her superhero Paddy and told him that she had told her parents and that they wanted to meet him. Paddy started to get sick of all the praise and Rita's parents, Jeff and Sue were just the same. Paddy snapped at a meal with the four of them, which caused Sue to run to the bathroom crying, followed by Rita. Jeff told Paddy that Rita's sister, Sally, was killed eight months earlier in a hit and run incident. Paddy felt terrible and tried to apologise but Rita wouldn't listen. Soon after, Paddy won Rita back after posing nude as a model in one of her art classes, but things went sour again after Paddy's veterinary partner Hari Prasard stole money from the company's accounts. Rita noticed this but thought it was a mistake. When people started taking their animals elsewhere, Rita tried to cheer Paddy up by talking to journalist Jasmine Thomas, to see if she could advertise the place by writing an article that would reassure people. However, Jasmine's boss, John McNally, wasn't pleased with the article and edited it so the story detailed the scandal caused by Hari and also made it seem like Paddy was in on it. When Paddy found out, he was furious and Rita was left worse off, once more she tried to make things better by throwing a party for him in the Woolpack, but Paddy was too upset to enjoy himself. Soon after Paddy made the decision to put all his energy into reviving his business and decided to put romance on hold until it was all sorted, leaving Rita gutted.

The only aspects of his teachings which are known to us are what Cicero records concerning divination. Life Cratippus was a contemporary and friend of Cicero who had a very high opinion of him, for he declared Cratippus to be the most distinguished of the Peripatetics that he had known,Cicero, de Officiis, iii. 2 and thought him at least equal to the greatest of his school.Cicero, De Divinatione, i. 3. Cratippus lived for a time at Mytilene, and accompanied Pompey in his flight after the Battle of Pharsalia, endeavouring to comfort and rouse him by philosophical arguments.Plutarch, Pomp. 75; comp. Aelian, Varia Historia, vii. 21. Several eminent Romans, such as M. Marcellus and Cicero himself, were taught by him, and in 44 BC Cicero's son was his pupil at Athens, and was tenderly attached to him.Cicero, Brut. 31, ad Fam. xii. 16, xvi. 21, de Officiis, i. 1, ii. 2, 7. Young Cicero seems also to have visited Asia in his company.Cicero, Ad Fam. xii. 16. When Julius Caesar was at the head of the Roman republic, Cicero obtained from him Roman citizenship for Cratippus, and also induced the council of the Areopagus at Athens to invite the philosopher to remain in the city and to continue his instructions in philosophy.Plutarch, Cicero, 24. Although Cicero speaks of him as the leading philosopher of the Peripatetic school,Cicero, Tim. 1, cf. de Officiis, iii. 2 it is not certain if he was the scholarch.H. B. Gottschalk, (1987), Aristotelian Philosophy in the Roman World from the Time of Cicero to the End of the Second Century AD, in W. Haase (ed.), ANRW: Geschichte und Kultur Roms im Spiegel der neueren Forschung, page 1096. Walter de Gruyter After the murder of Caesar, Brutus, while staying at Athens, also attended the lectures of Cratippus.Plutarch, Brutus, 24. Teachings Although Cicero had a high opinion of the knowledge and talent of Cratippus, his philosophical opinions are unknown, apart from allusions to his opinions on divination, on which he seems to have written a work. Cicero states that Cratippus believed in dreams and supernatural inspiration () but that he rejected all other kinds of divination.Cicero, De Divinatione, i. 3, 32, 50, 70, 71, ii. 48, 52; Tertullian, de Anim. 46. He seems to have held that, while motion, sense and appetite cannot exist apart from the body, thought reaches its greatest power when most free from bodily influence, and that divination is due to the direct action of the divine mind on that part of the human soul which is not dependent on the body.

The film's music is by Laxmikant Pyarelal. It had a collection of 4 crores in 1977. The film became a superhit.http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/features/business-of- bollywood/chhaila-babu-a-tale-of-deception-and- seduction/articleshow/3343963.cms?curpg=1 This was the only film directed by Joy to be successful at the box office. and the success of Chhailla Babu gave a boost to the career of Khanna, who went through a bad phase between 1976 and 1978 at the box office. This film seems to be very heavily inspired by the Cary Grant/Audrey Hepburn super hit film CHARADE. The cinematographer in this film, Nariman Irani, while working on this film decided to borrow most of the plot of Chhailla Babu and shared a modified story idea to Chandra Barot, who made the new modified story as the film Don (1978). Plot A suspense thriller, Chhaila Babu was the yesteryear actor Joy Mukherjee's second and only successful film as a director. Rita, played by Zeenat, is vacationing in the snowy mountains in Kashmir. Rita is a ski champion. A warning sign on the slopes is chopped down by an unseen person, and Rita skis blithely on into danger. She's rescued by a local ski guide, who shows up again minutes later as a carriage driver. When she asks him who he really is, he responds with a song: \\"Main Chhaila Babu\\". Chhaila Babu had first posed as a skiing lifeguard and then as a tangewala. Meanwhile, in Bombay, Rita's gangster dad is murdered while trying to run away with a suitcase that has cash worth Rs 80 lakhs. A policeman curiously reaches the murder scene, and the dying dad murmurs a number into his ear - 77203. With no sign of the suitcase and suspecting the dreaded \\"Scorpion\\" to be behind the crime, the police call Rita to Mumbai. When he drops her off at her hostel, a CBI Inspector (Om Shivpuri) is waiting for her. He tells her about her father's murder and asks her about the money. She's distraught but knows nothing, and he asks her to return to Bombay to help the CBI in their investigation. At the airport observing her arrival are the gang and—Chhaila Babu, wearing a medal around his neck. Mac Mohan attacks Rita at her home and suddenly Chhaila Babu steps in to save her. Macmohan sees his Scorpion medal, and both men flee. Chhaila Babu tenderly administers to Rita's wounds and kisses her. He tells her that he loves her and wants to marry her, and if she hands over the robbery money he'll take it to the police for her—otherwise he's afraid she'll be killed for it. Rita sees a diamond necklace hanging out of one of his pockets, and tells him furiously to get out. He tells her that society has made him a thief; that it robbed him of his family and left him with nothing to live for except vengeance, but she's unsympathetic. Rita finds Chhaila in Mumbai again, this time as a taxi driver. He tells her that her words the night before have changed him. He tells her about his past. Meanwhile, the police and the CBI Inspector are pretty sure that Chhaila Babu is Scorpion, but they need evidence. He takes her to a nightclub and there he starts flirting with Lily. The club happens to belong to Ranjit, and Mac Mohan is there too; he recognizes Chhaila Babu as Scorpion. As he tells Ranjit who Chhaila Babu really is? But she is soon told that the man with many disguises could be the Scorpion, who could be her dad's killer. A furious Rita now gets determined to kill Chhailla, but the rest of the story is all about who Chhailla Babu is, why he is behind the girl, and how he was in Kashmir when Rita had been there too. Does he really love Rita or is he just using her? And where is the 80 lakhs rupees from the Southern Bank robbery? Reception It had collections of 4,00,00,000 in 1977 and became a superhit.

He was the 1st Canadian Surgeon General. He was born in York (later Toronto), Upper Canada in 1826, the son of William Bergin, a York merchant who had immigrated from Ireland. He studied at Upper Canada College and McGill College, receiving his MD in 1847. Bergin set up practice at Cornwall. He was founder and president of the Eastern District Medical Association, president of the St. Lawrence and Eastern District Medical Association and examiner for the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, also serving president of the council for the College from 1881 to 1882 and from 1885 to 1886. With his brother John, he also raised horses and cattle. He was defeated by Alexander Francis Macdonald, the brother of Donald Alexander Macdonald, in 1874. He opposed the Canada Temperance Act of 1878, feeling that, in the end, it increased rather than prevented the consumption of alcohol. Bergin also introduced private member's bills to regulate working conditions for women and children, even though it was believed by some that labour regulations fell under provincial control; his efforts led to the introduction of legislation regulating labour conditions in Ontario factories. With Joseph Kerr, he promoted the development of the Ontario Pacific Railway, serving as president from 1886 until his death in 1896, when his brother John succeeded him. Bergin also helped promote the expansion of the Cornwall Canal. He served in the local militia during the Trent Affair and the Fenian raids, later becoming lieutenant-colonel. Bergin served as surgeon general with Middleton's expedition to the North-West in 1885. Although he was unsuccessful in persuading the government to create a permanent militia medical corps following the North-West Rebellion, the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps was later established in 1904. He died in Cornwall while still in office in 1896 after succumbing to an unidentified illness.

She established the Women of India Fund in 1921 and National Baby Week in 1923, as well as supporting many existing charities.

It is found either as its crystalline hydrochloride salt or as an oily or crystalline base. DBT was first synthesized by the chemist Alexander Shulgin and reported in his book TiHKAL (Tryptamines i Have Known And Loved). Shulgin did not test DBT himself, but reports a human dosage of \\"1 mg/kg i.m.\\" being active, but less so than DMT or DET. This suggests that an active dosage of DBT will be in the 100 mg range. This compound has been sold as a \\"research chemical\\" and has been confirmed to be an active hallucinogen although somewhat weaker than other similar tryptamine derivatives. It produces a head- twitch response in mice. There are four symmetrical isomers of DBT which can be made, or ten isomers in total if unsymmetrical substitution is used. Of these only the n-butyl analogue DBT is known to be active in humans; the isobutyl, sec-butyl, and tert-butyl isomers DIBT, DSBT and DTBT have never been tested and only DBT and DIBT were made by Shulgin. 400px The unsymmetrical isomers BIBT, BSBT, BTBT, IBSBT, IBTBT and SBTBT are also possible but have never been made and no predictions have been made about their activity. Shulgin speculates that the s-butyl isomer DSBT may be more potent than the straight chain compound DBT, but that the more highly branched DIBT and DTBT would probably be inactive due to the bulk of the substituent group. As for longer chain compounds than butyl, they have not been made and would probably be inactive. Shulgin mentions that the monohexyl compound NHT is without activity. However the unsymmetrical compounds such as methylbutyltryptamine show more promise, and a wide range of possible compounds could be made by pairing the various butyl isomers with methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl or allyl groups ReferencesExternal links * TiHKAL entry Category:Psychedelic tryptamines ","title":"Dibutyltryptamine"},{"id":"10888403","text":"Geoff Boyce (born 31 December 1981) is a field hockey player from Australia.

It is composed of the basic word \\"heim\\" and the word \\"Bentrites\\", derived from the Proto-Germanic name Bandarit, which is existed in the 6th century. It was also spelled as \\"Bentersheim\\".  Early history  A 7300-year-old settlement was detected by aerial photo-evaluations in 2005 of already known archaeological sites in the Gemarkung Beindersheim. [...]The Rhine Palatinate, Ludwigshafen on the Rhine, Edition Frankenthal: Rudolf H. Böttcher: Beindi lived thousands of years before Ötzi ' Of 4 August 2005 Beindersheim is located on Speyer on Worms the Roman road from Speyer on the western bank of the Rhine. Foundations of the foundations of two Roman villas in the area of the Jubengewanne and Osterlanggewann are the Roman settlement in Beindersheim. In the changing history of the patrocinium is at the beginning \\"Holy Cross\\", gladly given in the Gallo-Roman time. Probably in the pre-Franconian period, the patristic of the church community changes to \\"Saint Peter\\", especially since it is only in the following Franconian-Carolingian period of worshiping Saint Peter together with Saint Paul. Frankish settlements were very frequent in the vicinity of Roman settlements. This is also the case in Beindersheim, which is also indicated by the characteristic name \\"-heim\\". The first documentary mention of Beindersheim of April 13, 855 in the Lorscher Codex manifests a property exchange in the district of the village of Bentritesheim in the Wormsgau. From the second documentary mention 874 in the \\"Mainz Declaration \\"Shows that between 629 and 656, a Franconian king from Bendirdisheim had surrendered his property to the Cologne Episcopal Church. From this it can be concluded that the village was founded by bandarite shortly after the Franconian occupation in the 6th century. There are no written sources for the next 400 years.  Middle ages  Under Konrad II (1024-1039), the Leiningen (Count of Leiningen) received the Landgrafschaft as Fief of the bishop of Worms. In 1254, the patronage and decree of the Church to the Holy Cross and to Saint Peter was transferred to the knight Diezo of Enselntheim (Einselthum). Ten years later Diezo von Einselthum (who was from Leiningen) was able to sell the assurance of the Worm Bishop Eberhard the Tenrecht for 600 pounds of light to the Andreasstift in Worms. Until the French Revolution, the Andreasstift Worms is patron saint and tenherr of the church at Beindersheim. The third church patron saint is St. Nicholas, whose worship of the Cluny monastery dates from the 12th century. A document from 1307 documents an existing village court together with apprentices in Beindersheim. In 1398, Beindersheim was one of three lemming dishes.  15th to 17th centuries  In 1438 Count Emich von Leiningen presented the Hans Kranich of Dirmstein, called Bock, with a good of 102 1/2 acres. In 1481, Leiningen retired from the Electoral Palatinate following the death of Count Hesso Beindersheim. In 1562 Arnold Aquila (eagle) became the first Lutheran pastor in the church. His date of entry coincides with the beginning of the confiscation of the spiritual goods, which is carried out by the administration of the Kurpfalz. In 1577, the Reformed Faith was introduced in Beindersheim, and this group became the largest religious community. Lutherans and Catholics form the minority. The Lutheran priest Hubertus Sturmius had to leave Beindersheim in 1579 and became a professor of theology at the newly founded Leiden University / Netherlands. In the Thirty Years' War, Beindersheim has a hard time, especially since it is in the immediate vicinity of the fortified town of Frankenthal. In 1621, the Spanish army besieged Spinolas Frankenthal. In Beindersheim the supplies are plundered and buildings are set on fire. In 1632, the Swedes laid the foundations for Frankenthal and in 1635 the Spaniards took over the city. In 1644-1646 the whole of the desolation of Beindersheim by the French, which laid siege on the Frankenthal occupied by the Spaniards. In 1654 40 Walloon faith refugees were taken in Beindersheim. In the coming years this group will grow to 200 persons. They celebrate their own worship and build a school in French. The large number of foreign residents must have led to a serious change in the cohabitation, since at the beginning also difficulties of understanding existed. In addition, the people who had been taken over had little real estate and had to make a living as day laborer and craftsman. When, on the 2nd Advent of 1688, French troops massacred Beindersheimer in the course of the Palatinate succession war, the majority of the Walloons left the village in order to secure themselves on the right side of the Rhine in the area of Hanau and Frankfurt. In October 1689 the village has only 111 inhabitants.  18th century  On 26 August 1705, the elector of the Palatinate of Beindersheim came to the bishopric of Worms. With the new rule the remaining Catholics are in a more favorable position. The population is growing rapidly, but the suffers of the years 1784 and 1785 lead to catastrophic plight for poorer population groups, as documented by the disturbing liquidation protocols. There are departures to the surrounding area, to emigration to East and West Galicia. In the course of the coalition war French troops came to Beindersheim in 1792. On February 2, 1794, the French requisitioned 47 pieces of cattle in the parish. The [Prussians] detach the French. On May 1, 1794, there were fights about Frankenthal, the Prussians must retreat. Several civilians flee to the right side of the Rhine.  19th century  On 17 October 1797 Austria left the left bank of the Rhine to France. Beindersheim is part of the department of the Mont-Tonnerre (Donnersberg). 1808 condemned a special chamber of the jury court Mainz 18 Beindersheimer citizens to six years of imprisonment. They had refused to pay the high French property tax and snatched the camp-book from the taxpayer and destroyed public documents. At the turn of the year 1813/14 Austrian and Bavarian troops liberated the left-Rhine region from the French rule. After the Vienna Congress (1815) Beindersheim became part of the Palatinate in 1816 to the Kingdom of Bavaria. In June 1849, the Bavarian military quartered 120 riders and 384 foot soldiers in Beindersheim to defend against the invasion of Baden and Palatinate. The last quartering was recorded by the philosopher Philipp Raquet in 1850. Between 1800 and 1858, according to the housebooks of Philipp Raquet and Heinrich Schardon 235 people of Beindersheim leave the village to emigrate to America. The main settlement area of Beindersheimer was Ohio (1833).  Population development  By the end of the 17th century, Beindersheim was probably a pure one-street village on the \\"Schenkelstraße\\" / Kirchenstraße, which had about 40 farms in the early 17th century and thus 150-200 inhabitants. In the 18th century, there was continuous population growth through reconstruction and resettlement after the Pfälzische Erbfolgekrieg, so that 1771 370 inhabitants were counted. During this time the southbound connecting roads were built. The local boundaries of the 18th century were scarcely expanded in the 19th century, as the inflow was only slight in contrast to the surrounding area, and only new vacancies were closed by new citizens. There has been an expansion since the beginning of the 20th century, especially in the southeast. They were mostly residential buildings of workers and employees in Frankenthal and Ludwigshafen am Rhein. The trend from the Bauerndorf to the Wohngemeinde continued after the Second World War, the newly populated areas have more than doubled the built area. In 1960 Beindersheim had 1260 inhabitants, since then several new construction areas in the south, west and east were opened up.

Born in St Vincent, Ollivierre initially played first-class cricket for Trinidad; he was selected to tour England with the West Indies team in 1900. He later qualified to play first-class cricket for Derbyshire between 1901 and 1907, becoming the first black West Indian to play for an English county. Ollivierre was reasonably successful in county cricket and had a reputation as a stylish batsman. However, he dropped out of first-class cricket after 1907 owing to eye trouble. Early life and career Ollivierre was born in St Vincent on 20 July 1876. His family were enthusiastic cricketers, although the region had little history within the sport, and his two younger brothers Richard and Helon went on to represent the West Indies in first-class cricket. Initially, Ollivierre played for Trinidad; he made his first-class debut against an English touring team in March 1895 at the age of 18. He took two wickets, scored 7 runs in his first innings and 12 runs in the second. In non-first-class cricket, he continued to represent St Vincent, and impressed critics when Barbados played the island in 1897. In 1899, he played two first-class matches for a team selected by A. B. St Hill against a team representing Trinidad. In the first game, he took 11 wickets and scored 67 in the second innings; in the second game, he took a further five wickets in Trinidad's first innings. West Indian tour of England in 1900 During the 1900 English cricket season, Ollivierre travelled to England with a West Indian team. Invited to tour England by Lord Hawke following the success of English tours to the Caribbean, the team was the first from the West Indies to visit England, and matches were not first-class. The team improved steadily throughout, and by the end of the tour were judged to be playing well. Although predominantly made up from white players, the team contained several black cricketers; at the time, the dominant teams in the West Indies were exclusively white. Ollivierre was the most consistent and successful batsman in the team, scoring 883 runs at a batting average of 32. His highest score, and only century, came against Leicestershire, when he scored 159 runs and shared an opening partnership of 238 with Pelham Warner. He also shared an opening partnership of 208 with Percy Cox against Surrey. He bowled occasionally in the early part of the tour, although with little success, but did not bowl at all in his last eight games. According to the review of the tour in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, Ollivierre was the team's best batsman, and his innings against Leicestershire was one of the best of the season. The article observed: \\"He has strokes all round the wicket, and in some ways reminds one of Ranji\\". During the tour, Ollivierre agreed to play for Derbyshire and remained in England to begin the two-year process of qualification for the County Championship. It is unlikely that Ollivierre ever returned to the West Indies. Derbyshire cricketer Throughout his career in England, Ollivierre played as an amateur cricketer. He was employed by Samuel Hill-Wood, a businessman and politician from Derbyshire, to work in his office in Glossop, where Ollivierre lived. During the 1901 season, he played three first-class games for Derbyshire in non-Championship games: twice against London County Cricket Club and once against the touring South African cricket team, hitting two half-centuries in the process of scoring 247 runs at an average of 41.16. After further appearances in 1902, while waiting to qualify, against London County and the Australian touring team, he became eligible for county matches in July and made his Championship debut against Essex. Later in 1902, he scored 167 against Warwickshire, his maiden first-class century. In all first-class matches in the season, Ollivierre scored 524 runs at 34.93. The following season, Ollivierre played in 19 games and scored 721 runs, but his average fell to 20.60. Ollivierre's most successful season was 1904, when he scored 1,268 runs at an average of 34.27. Against Essex, he made the highest score of his career, when, according to his obituary in Wisden, \\"he was the dominating figure in a remarkable match\\". Essex scored 597 runs in their first innings; Derbyshire replied with 548, of which Ollivierre made 229. After Essex were bowled out for 97, Derbyshire hit off the required runs to win by nine wickets. Ollivierre was left on 92 not out, and had scored 321 runs in the match. The match report in the 1905 edition of Wisden noted: \\"In defeating Essex, Derbyshire accomplished the most phenomenal performance ever recorded in first-class cricket ... [Their] achievement has no parallel in the history of the game.\\" Over the following seasons, Ollivierre's form faded. In 1905, he scored 759 runs at an average of 18.07. He improved his average with 752 runs at 25.06 in 1906, including his final first-class century. During that season, he played against a touring West Indian team which included his brother Richard—Green, Jeffrey, p. 169. Ollivierre scored 0 and 64 not out. In 1907, he managed just 417 runs at 12.26. In these later seasons, he began to have problems with his eyesight, and was forced to retire from first-class cricket after 1907. In total, he played 114 first-class games, scored 4,830 runs at 23.56 and hit three centuries. However, he continued to play club cricket in Yorkshire and, annually between 1924 and 1939, spent time in the Netherlands coaching in schools. Ollivierre died at Pontefract in Yorkshire on 25 March 1949. Style and impact According to Wisden in 1901, as a batsman Ollivierre \\"was particularly strong in cutting and playing to leg\\". J. N. Pentelow, a cricket writer, suggested in 1928 that \\"there was something about Ollivierre that reminded one of the great Ranji. He was a more heavily built man than the slim Ranji of the days when we were young; but his strokes and his movements had real grace.\\" A correspondent in the Observer in 1931 remembered Ollivierre as a \\"great batsman\\", while Neville Cardus, writing in 1920, named Ollivierre among a list of top-quality batsmen who did not do themselves justice at the highest level: \\"Geniuses who have just lost their way ...every one of them in possession of an excellent enough record in county cricket, but every one of them really intended by nature to wear the most precious laurels the greatest of games has to offer\\". Ollivierre was the first black West Indian cricketer to play county cricket,Green, Jeffrey, p. 167. and the first West Indian cricketer to establish a cricketing reputation outside of that region. Other West Indians looked to follow his example, and several were approached by English counties with a view to qualifying. At least one of Ollivierre's Derbyshire colleagues was unhappy playing alongside a black cricketer; Bill Storer, according to the cricket writer E. H. D. Sewell, believed in \\"England for the English\\" and specifically objected to presence of black people.Quoted in However, there is no evidence that Ollivierre experienced any difficulties from spectators, and the historian Jack Williams suggests that despite racism inherent in English cricket at the time, Ollivierre's presence may have \\"created goodwill towards non-whites among [Derbyshire's] white supporters\\".

Biography The first Swedish expedition to North America with Fogel Grip and Kalmar Nyckel was launched from the port city of Gothenburg in late 1637. The expedition was organized and overseen by Swedish Admiral Clas Fleming. Samuel Blommaert, a Dutch colonial patron, assisted with the fitting-out. Following the recommendation of Willem Usselincx, one of the directors of the Dutch West India Company, Swedish Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna appointed Peter Minuit to lead the expedition. Minuit made arrangements to found a Swedish colony on the lower Delaware River in parts of the present-day states of Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, within the territory later claimed by the Dutch. The first settlers, (Swedes, Finns, and some Dutchmen) reached the location now known as Swedes' Landing in Wilmington, Delaware on March 29, 1638. Peter Minuit became the first governor of the newly established colony of New Sweden. However, Minuit left the colony on June 15, 1638 and sailed to the Caribbean Island of St. Christopher to barter a ship's cargo of wine and aquavit for tobacco. Minuit died there during a hurricane.Ashmead, Henry Graham History of Delaware County, Pennsylvania (Chapter II, Philadelphia: L. H. Everts & Co. 1884)Weslager, C. A.

He played five seasons with the Korea Baseball Organization then six further seasons in Nippon Professional Baseball, primarily as a first baseman. Career=Minor league career Woods was the 5th pick of the Montreal Expos in the 1988 MLB draft as a high school third baseman. He fielded .882, making 10 errors in 32 games for the GCL Expos and batted just .121. He hit just 2 home runs in 149 at bats and walked 7 times while whiffing 47 times; he was also caught stealing four times in six tries. Woods was promoted to the Jamestown Expos in 1989. In Single-A action, Woods hit .263; he continued to strike out frequently (58 times in 209 AB), but his walks were up (20) and his average and power (9 homers) were also improved. In 1990, with the Rockford Expos, the 20-year-old third baseman hit .242, above the team average of .226. He also led the team in doubles (27), homers (8) and strikeouts (121). His OBP was .310 and he slugged .363. Woods made it to High-A in 1991 where he hit just .220 for the West Palm Beach Expos. He also was moved from third base to the outfield that year. He hit .291 for Rockford and even stole 15 bases in 21 tries. He hit .286 for West Palm Beach and struck out in 3 of his 4 at-bats in his first Double-A exposure with the Harrisburg Senators. In 1993, Woods returned to Harrisburg, batting .252. A year later, Woods split the year between Harrisburg (.316) and the Triple-A Ottawa Lynx (.224). On November 18, the Expos gave up on Woods and released him. Woods found a home with the Baltimore Orioles' Rochester Red Wings farm club in 1995, hitting .261 as a 1B/DH/OF. A year later, Woods was in another system, joining the Boston Red Sox, playing for their Double-A affiliate, the Trenton Thunder, hitting .312, tying for 4th in the league in homers (25) and was among the leaders in average, OBP and slugging. In 1997, Woods spent his 10th and final season in a United States-based league, hitting .352 for the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox. He homered 9 times and drove in 28 in 29 games but did not play for the parent Boston team. He also played that year for the Potros de Minatitlán of the Mexican League, homering 18 times in 85 games for 27 homers and 101 runs (73 RBI in 85 games for the Potros). Woods hit .342. His walk total (59) surpassed his K total (49). Career in Korea 1998 found Woods in the KBO, Korea Professional Baseball, where he became the first foreign player to hit a home run and be ejected from a game by an umpire in the league's first year allowing foreign players. Playing for the OB Bears (Doosan Bears), he set a KBO record with 42 homers and won the MVP award. He was the first foreign player to win the award. Two years later, he hit .315 with 39 homers and 111 RBI and lost the home run race by one to Park Kyung-wan. In 2001, he won MVP honors in the All-Star game, playoffs and the Korean Series, in which he blasted four homers in six games for Doosan. In 2002, Woods hit just .256; he struck out 123 times in 407 at-bats though he did hit 25 homers. In five years in Korea, he hit 174 homers, drove in 510 runs and batted .294. Woods left Korea with the longest career of any foreign player in KBO history until 2005, when Jay Davis broke his mark.Jay Davis, Baseball-Reference.com. Retrieved June 17, 2020. Yokohama BayStars Woods left the Bears to try his hand in Japan in 2003, signing with the Yokohama BayStars, hitting .273 and tied for the home run lead with Alex Ramirez with 40. He was 6th in the Central League in slugging, 4th in walks (66) and 5th in RBI (87) though he also led the league with 132 K's. Woods became the first man to lead a league in homers in both Korea and Japan. Woods improved in his second year with Yokohama, hitting .298. He made the Best Nine at first base, tied Tuffy Rhodes for the home run lead with 45, was third in walks (74) and tied for third in RBIs (103). He was also 5th in slugging and 4th in OBP and OPS. He struck out 142 times, ranking him third in that category. Chunichi Dragons After the 2004 season, he signed with the defending CL champion Chunichi Dragons and hit .306 with 38 homers. He was third in OPS and homers, 5th in slugging, 4th in OBP, tied for 4th with 103 RBI and ground into the most double plays (24) as the Dragons' 1B and cleanup hitter. Woods missed 10 games due to a suspension he served after charging the mound when Shugo Fujii threw high and inside during an at bat. Woods was also fined 500,000 yen. It was the harshest penalty given to any player in Japan in five years. After the 2005 season was completed, Woods had hit 421 homers in his pro career. In 2006, Woods put together an MVP caliber season by batting .310 with a league- leading 47 homers and 144 RBI. However, the MVP award that season went to his teammate, Kosuke Fukudome. To clinch the title for Chunichi, he hit grand slams in back-to-back games, the first Central Leaguer to do so since Fumio Fujimura 53 years earlier. He also set a new team record for home runs. He played for the Dragons until 2008. Pursuits outside baseball In addition to playing baseball, Woods worked for a time for the Brooksville Fire Department.

At the , Ungarra had a population of 241. The name 'Ungarra' is derived from a nearby waterhole of the same name which is located just to the south of the township. It has a Mediterranean climate and receives on average just over 400mm of rainfall every year.  Overview  Settlers started farming the area in the early 1900s as the Eyre Peninsula Railway from Port Lincoln reached Ungarra in 1909. This provided an incentive for the clearing of what was generally mallee/Melaleuca mix of native vegetation for the growing of wheat. This railway is still in operation and the branchline extended to Buckleboo but now is only operational to Kimba. An important local historic location in the nearby Moody Rock and Tanks where water was collected from a natural outcropping of granite and stored in a large tank for the require water for steam trains. This site is located within the Moody Tank Conservation Park. Moody Rocks Water Tank is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register. The Ungarra Memorial Park is located at the southern entrance to the township, containing an old windmill as a memorial to the early colonial settlers of the area. In its heyday, Ungarra sported a bank, a bakery, a school up to year 10, and general store and two churches. While the buildings for many of these enterprises still stand, only the school (R-7) and one of the churches is still in operation. The former bank is now located at the Koppio Smithy Museum at Koppio. The agricultural production around the area has expanded from the original wheat and now includes barley, lupins, faba beans, field peas and canola. There are also livestock industries, particularly sheep-based. The town has a number of facilities, including sporting grounds and a primary school as well as a lawn bowling green and soldier memorial hall. The school celebrated its centenary in 2014. The part-time Ungarra Community Cafe opened in 2015 as a local hub, selling coffee and local fresh produce, and donating some proceeds to local charities and overseas missions. The cafe operates out of the former general store building, which had previously been closed for eight years. The town is part of a popular tourist drive that can be done from Tumby Bay, with no camping or accommodation available within the town. Other conveniences include public toilets and payphone. The town also has clearly visible grain silos operated by Viterra which while being quiet for most the year spring into life in the November–December period each year.  Transport  While having a number of unsealed roads running into Ungarra, it is connected to Lipson and the Lincoln Highway via a sealed all-weather road, the sealing of which was only completed in 2004. Ungarra is served by two freight-only stations of the gauge Eyre Peninsula Railway - one is called Moody and the other is called Ungarra. A branchline is proposed to Ungarra with the proposed iron ore port of Sheep Hill which is northeast of Tumby Bay. Governance Ungarra is located within the federal Division of Grey, the state electoral district of Flinders and the local government area of the District Council of Tumby Bay.

Hughes briefly appeared with World Wrestling Entertainment in 2003 and performed for the Puerto Rico-based International Wrestling Association in the mid-2000s. Professional wrestling career=Early career Born in Stratford, Prince Edward Island, Hughes met Edge, Christian and Glen Kulka at a local gym while touring Canadian independent promotions during the late 1990s. After expressing interest in a professional career, the three encouraged him and Kulka suggested contacting promoter Emile Dupre to begin training. During 1998, Hughes began training under \\"Handsome\\" Hubert Gallant and the Cuban Assassin among other wrestlers in Dupre's Grand Prix promotion in Shediac, New Brunswick (he would later befriend fellow student Kingman, both of whom would eventually become charter members of Kardinal Sinners two years later).

Although planning to tour Puerto Rico, he was convinced by Gallant to jump to RAW and help promote the promotion resulting in Grand Prix promoter Emile Dupre blacklisting Hughes from the promotion and the Maritime territory. After the promotion was sold to Warren Olsen in 2000, Hughes stayed with the promotion and eventually won the promotion's heavyweight championship. During the next two years, he and the heel stable \\"Kardinal Sinners\\" including \\"The Natural\\" Bobby Rude, Kingman and the Acadian Giant dominated the promotion until its close in July 2002.

Cryovac was a federal lawsuit concerning toxic contamination of groundwater in Woburn, Massachusetts. Case The residents of Woburn, Massachusetts sued Beatrice Foods, the operator of a tannery; Cryovac, a subsidiary of W. R. Grace and Company; and UniFirst, a laundry service, for dumping chemicals that contaminated nearby groundwater. The occurrence of a cancer cluster and other negative effects on health led to revelations of water polluted primarily with trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene. The first trial included contentious disputes over \\"splitting\\" the trial into separate liability and damages phases. W.R. Grace was found liable, and Beatrice was found not liable. Judge Walter Jay Skinner, granted a motion for a mistrial put by W. R. Grace. Woburn residents then appealed that motion, along with Beatrice's not liable verdict. The Court of Appeal ordered a new trial. The district court then found that a discovery error made by Beatrice impaired the plaintiffs preparation process, but recommended that its earlier denial of motion for relief from judgment be sustained. On appeal, the circuit court judge held that: first, the district court did not abuse its discretion by its determination regarding pretrial discovery, namely, the district court had determined that the operator's failure to disclose a report during pretrial discovery did not warrant relief from judgment. Second, the judge held that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that the operator's nondisclosure of a report was roughly equivalent to residents' improper continuation of prosecution of their claim, and thus that monetary sanctions should not be imposed upon either party. Finally, the judge found that the operator's nondisclosure of report did not constitute “fraud on the court” which would trigger entry of default. On 22 September 1986, W.R. Grace settled with the plaintiffs for an undisclosed amount of money, however many sources report that it was around $8 million.  Follow-up  On January 28, 1987, W.R. Grace was indicted by a grand jury of lying to the EPA about its usage and disposal of toxic waste. Anderson Regional Transportation Center was later built on the site and named in memory of James R. \\"Jimmy\\" Anderson (1968–1981), whose mother Anne was the main plaintiff.

Soon the family moved to Novhorod-Siverskyi (modern Ukraine) where Konstantin's father was appointed an uyezd judge.The teacher of Russian teachers official site of Moscow University of Industry and Finance. In 1844 Ushinsky graduated from the Department of Law of Moscow University. From 1846 to 1849 he was a professor at the Demidov Lyceum in Yaroslavl but was forced to leave the position because of his liberal views. The unemployed Ushinsky earned money by literary work for the magazines Sovremennik and Biblioteka dlya Chteniya. After a year and a half he managed to get a position as a minor bureaucrat in the Department for Foreign Religions. Ushinsky referred to his job at the time as \\"the most boring position possible.\\" In 1854 Ushinsky became a teacher of Russian Literature and Law at the Gatchina Orphanage (Gatchinsky Sirotsky Institut). In 1855-1859 he became the Inspector at the same institution. There was a lucky incident during his inspectorship: he discovered two sealed-off bookcases untouched for more than twenty years, which held the library of Pestalozzi's pupil Hugel. This discovery strongly influenced Ushinsky's interest in theoretical pedagogy. In 1859-1862 Ushinsky was the Inspector of the Smolny Institute for Noble Maidens in Saint-Petersburg, In 1860-1862 he also worked as the Chief Editor of the Journal of the Department of Education (Zhurnal Ministerstva Narodnago Obrazovaniya). Following a conflict with the Department of Education, Ushinsky was forced to go abroad to study school organizations in Switzerland, Germany, France, Belgium and Italy (1862-1867). The position was perceived by many as an honorary exile. At the end of his life Ushinsky mostly acted as a writer and publicist. Together with Pirogov he may be considered as an author of the liberal reforms of the 1860s. Emancipated peasants needed schools, the schools needed teachers and textbooks. Ushinsky expended a lot of effort arguing the best way to organize teachers' seminaries. He also wrote children's textbooks for learning reading: Children's World (Detski mir), \\"the Russian equivalent of America's McGuffy Reader,\\"Jeffrey Brooks, When Russia Learned to Read: Literacy and Popular Literature, 1861-1917 (Northwestern University Press, 2003: ), p. 51. and Native Word (Rodnoye slovo).Konstantin Ushinsky on peoples.ru encyclopedia More than 10 million of Ushinsky's books, including 187 editions of Native Word, were printed before the October Revolution. Ushinsky died in Odessa in 1870 and was buried in Kiev. Works Ushinsky's magnum opus was his theoretical work The Human As a Subject of Education: Pedagogical Anthropology in three volumes, started in 1867. According to Ushinsky, the subject of education is human, so it is impossible to achieve results in education without using the results of the \\"anthropological sciences\\": philosophy, political economy, history, literature, psychology, anatomy, physiology. According to Ushinsky, \\"Pedagogical experience without science is equivalent to witchcraft in medicine.\\" Among Ushinsky's breakthroughs was the new \\"Analytic-Synthetic Phonetic Method\\" for learning reading and writing, which is still the main method used in Russian schools.

His ideas had a germinal impact on the nativist school of National Learning in Japan. Life Azumamaro was born, the second son of Hakura Nobuaki (1625-1696), into a scholarly family that for generations had supplied Shinto priests to the Inari shrine in Fushimi. From an early age he studied traditional Japanese poetry, waka, and Shinto thought and belief, and his precocity was such that he was soon employed, in 1697, as poetry tutor to one of the sons of Emperor Reigen (regnabat 1663–1687). Fushimi at the time had been described by Ihara Saikaku as an economically depressed town that had fallen down in its fortunes. This marked it off from the flourishing cultural developments of the Genroku period. He set up an academy for studying and teaching his nativist ideas in the Inari shrine. In 1700 he settled in Edo, where his students mainly came from the Shinto clergy whom he instructed in norito prayers and the Shinto liturgy, though the curriculum also encompassed such ancient texts as the Man'yōshū and the Nihon Shoki. His studies in the former classic profited particularly from the Buddhist priest Keichū, and together these two figures may be considered as founding fathers of the movement of nativist thought known as kokugaku (\\"national studies\\"). Azumamaro remained in Edo until 1713, when he returned to Fushimi. After a short time, he returned to Edo for a year on a stipend, but then retired to pursue his work in his native Fushima, where he was frequently consulted by members of the Bakufu regarding antiquarian matters regarding ancient court ceremonies and customs. He died by his own hand, after enduring many years of illness, in 1736. He developed an approach which drew a clear distinction between what was considered the native tradition of Japan from the prevalent socio-political orthodoxy of his day, Confucianism, but also sought to disentangle Japanese religion from the other major form of foreign thought, Buddhism. He regarded these foreign systems of belief and thought in adversarial terms. Kamo no Mabuchi, likewise the son of a Shinto priest and, like Azumamaro not of samurai origins, who was to become a major scholar of ancient literature, first met Azumamaro in 1722, and subsequently enrolled to study under him in 1728, and moving to Kyoto in 1733 to be taught by Azumamaro on a more permanent basis. Reputation Within a century of his passing, Hirata Atsutane described Kada no Azumamaro as the first of Kokugaku's 'great men' (taijin/ushi). Kokugaku, together with the kogaku (古学: \\"Ancient Studies\\") school founded by Kamo no Mabuchi laid the foundations for both the renaissance of interest in Japanese classical poetry and culture, and for the nativist critique of Confucian ideology which was to prove of great ideological importance during and after the transformation of Tokugawa Japan into the modernizing nation of that country under Emperor Meiji .

They were introduced in the course of the 1920s and remained in service until the 1990s. The E.626 was the first locomotive fed by 3,000 V DC overhead line in Italy. History The E.626 class is the result of a requirement issued in 1926 by the Ferrovie dello Stato (FS, Italian Railways) for a new locomotive to be used under the new 3,000 V DC line being built between Foggia and Benevento.The previous electrified lines of Italy used three-phase AC current at 16.7 Hz. The 3,000 V is currently the standard system in service, apart some High Speed lines fed at 25 kV AC. The design was carried out by the team of Giuseppe Bianchi, the \\"founder\\" of modern Italian railways, at the FS Traction and Material Service in Florence. The requirement specified the locomotive should have six traction axles, to improve adhesion on steep lines. The E.626 series totalled 448 units in three series, each with only slight electro-mechanical differences. It was old-fashioned, but reliable, and it became the mainstay of the new FS lines at 3,000 V DC, which gradually spread to the whole peninsula. Trials The firsts tests occurred on the Foggia-Benevento line in the September 1927, using three prototypes built by Savigliano, with the electrical equipment provided by Metropolitan-Vickers of Manchester. The first 14 prototypes (eight E.625 with lower gear ratio, for freight services, and six E.626) proved powerful and reliable, and entered service the following year. The only teething problem encountered was with the six 32R motors mounted on the axles, hanging laterally over transverse beams, a system devised to avoid the complicated side rods of the contemporary steam and three-phase locomotives. After a series of breakdowns, it was decided to limit the speed to . Traction control was provided by three different motor combinations (series, series- parallel, parallel) through banks of resistor-based rheostats. The transmission was rather noisy, but at the time, the crew's comfort was not a high priority. The carbody was in a single steel piece, mounted on an articulated chassis. The large bonnets at the ends limited the visibility of the rails, and they were reduced in size from the third series. Mass production JŽ series E361 In 1930 the mass production was started, with a first series of 85 units. In the meantime the E.625 were re-converted to E.626. In 1934-1938 a record number of 308 units was built, while in 1939 the last series, with low gear ratio, was shipped (they were later standardized). The new E636 of the 1940s initially shared the motors and some of the electro- mechanical devices with the E.626. After the destruction of World War II, in 1946 an updating and repair programme was launched. Some other units remained in the countries previously occupied by Italy. Seventeen locomotives were ceded to the Yugoslavian Railways (Class E361) and, in 1958, four were given to Czechoslovakia (Class E 666.0). Now inadequate for the passenger role, the E.626s were transferred to freight service, apart from working commuter trains in some areas of Italy. In the 1970s, the E.626s fell out of favour, partly because of complaints from trade unions about poor working conditions for the crew. Fourteen units were sold to private railways and the remaining units were gradually replaced by more modern classes, and scrapped. The last unit to be decommissioned was E.626.194, which was used for rescue trains, in 1999. Preservation Seven units survive today in museums, while 11 refurbished locomotives are used for historical trains.

The Via Foundation supports community and philanthropy development in the Czech Republic. Via Foundation focuses on growing the number of people in the Czech Republic working collaboratively to improve their communities and giving to help others. “Every act of charity is a story – which can motivate other people who are thinking about giving back but don’t know how to start,” says Executive Director Jiří Bárta about why Via Foundation presents the Via Bona awards. The Via Bona Awards are one of the two major annual awards in the Czech Republic to honor philanthropy and philanthropists. The other major Czech philanthropy award is the TOP Corporate Philanthropists Award presented by Donors Forum to award companies which have given the highest total monetary amount to charitable causes over the course of one year. Since 1997, The Via Bona Awards are held each year under the auspices of the Embassy of the USA in Prague and the general partner is Nadace Vodafone Česká republika. The Via Bona Award is given to those who serve as an example to others through their material and financial support, as well as their willingness to tread untried paths. The Via Bona Awards are nominated by Czech nonprofit organizations and are chosen by an independent jury. For the 19th year in a row, Via Foundation recognized individuals and companies who help improve their communities by giving their time, energy, expertise or money to help others. Via announced the winners of the 2016 Via Bona Philanthropy Awards. Juries selected winners in six categories. The 2016 award winners include people such as Zdeňka Mocňáková, who helps disabled people and senior citizens despite being bound to a wheelchair herself. She is the recipient of the Personal Engagement Award. In the Young Personal Engagement category, the jury selected two winners: Jakub Trefný, who despite being just nineteen years old, is an experienced volunteer nad helps senior citizens, homeless people and refugees, and Milan Dzuriak, who undertakes “Journeys against Pain” to raise money to make disabled children’s dreams come true. The Patron Award was presented to businessman Sanjiv Suri, owner of Zátiší Group, for his numerous philanthropic activities both in the Czech Republic and around the world. The Good Company Award went to Dušan Hopp’s company Auto Díly Servis s.r.o., based in Nový Jičín, whose owner and employees helped remodel a Home for Pregnant Women in Crisis. The Loyal Donor Award is a new category this year. It went to Asaf Auerbach, a regular donor to children’s charities whose own life was saved by Sir Nicholas Winton during World War II. The Bequests Help Award draws attention to bequests, which are still an uncommon form of giving in the Czech Republic. Via Foundation recognized microbiologist Ludmila Šilhánkova in memoriam. She left over CZK 2 million to help disabled children and young people. The Public’s Choice Award is a special seventh category presented under the auspices of Czech TV, the main media partner of the Via Bona Awards. Members of the public chose from among the 15 nominated philanthropists on the Via Foundation website. The winner of the voting was Zdeňka Mocňáková.

The party was disbanded after the liberation of France in World War II, because of ties to the Third Reich. The PNB was formed in the aftermath of split between federalists and nationalists within the Breton Autonomist Party (PAB), following the Congress of Guingamp in August 1931. Following the collapse of the PAB, the federalists led by Morvan Marchal formed the Breton Federalist League; the nationalist faction, led by Olier Mordrel, decided to found a new party with a clearly nationalist agenda, namely seeking Breton independence from France. This revived the programme of the previous Breton Nationalist Party, which had existed from 1911-1914. A congress was held in Landerneau on December 27, 1931. The following year, activists led by Célestin Lainé bombed a sculpture in Rennes representing Breton unity with France. The creation of this sculpture had spurred the foundation of the earlier party in 1911. The party was influenced by international Celticist ideas, and modelled its aspirations on Irish independence movements. It was also closely associated with fascist ideology. Because of its connections with Nazi Germany the party was banned in France on the outbreak of World War II in 1939, but after the defeat of France it was revived, becoming closely associated with Breton collaborationism. During the occupation France the PNB established a paramilitary, Bagadoù stourm, influenced by the SA that adopted a flag similar to that of the Reichskriegsflagge. An explicitly Nazi faction broke away in 1941 under the name Breton Social-National Workers' Movement. During its existence, the PNB published a newspaper, L'Heure Bretonne.

Hoffmann kilns are the most common kiln used in production of bricks and some other ceramic products. Patented by German Friedrich Hoffmann for brickmaking in 1858, it was later used for lime- burning, and was known as the Hoffmann continuous kiln. Construction and operation A Hoffmann kiln consists of a main fire passage surrounded on each side by several small rooms. Each room contains a pallet of bricks. In the main fire passage there is a fire wagon, that holds a fire that burns continuously. Each room is fired for a specific time, until the bricks are vitrified properly, and thereafter the fire wagon is rolled to the next room to be fired. Each room is connected to the next room by a passageway carrying hot gases from the fire. In this way, the hottest gases are directed into the room that is currently being fired. Then the gases pass into the adjacent room that is scheduled to be fired next. There the gases preheat the brick. As the gases pass through the kiln circuit, they gradually cool as they transfer heat to the brick as it is preheated and dried. This is essentially a counter- current heat exchanger, which makes for a very efficient use of heat and fuel. This efficiency is a principal advantage of the Hoffmann kiln, and is one of the reasons for its original development and continued use throughout history.The History Channel, Modern Marvels, \\"Bricks\\", repeat: April 18, 2008 In addition to the inner opening to the fire passage, each room also has an outside door, through which recently fired brick is removed, and replaced with wet brick to be dried and then fired in the next firing cycle. 100px In a classic Hoffmann kiln, the fire may burn continuously for years, even decades; in Iran, there are kilns that are still active and have been working continuously for 35 years. Any fuel may be used in a Hoffmann kiln, including gasoline, natural gas, heavy petroleum and wood fuel. The dimensions of a typical Hoffmann kiln are completely variable, but in average about 5 m (height) x 15 m (width) x 150 m (length). Historic examples of Hoffmann kilns The Hoffmann Kiln is used in almost every country. In the British Isles there are only a few Hoffmann kilns remaining, some of which have been preserved. The only ones with a chimney are at Prestongrange Industrial Heritage Museum and Llanymynech Heritage Area. The site at Llanymynech, close to Oswestry was used for lime-burning and has recently been partially restored as part of an industrial archaeology conservation project supported by English Heritage and the Heritage Lottery Fund. Two examples in North Yorkshire, the Hoffmann lime-burning kiln at Meal Bank Quarry, Ingleton and that at the former Craven and Murgatroyd lime works, Langcliffe are scheduled ancient monuments. There is an intact but abandoned Hoffmann kiln without a chimney present at Minera Limeworks; the site is abandoned but all entrances to the kiln have been grated-off, preventing access. The kiln is in a very poor state of repair, with trees growing out of the walls and the roof. Minera Quarry Trust hopes one day to develop the area into something of a tourist attraction. The Grade II listed Hoffmann brick kiln in Ilkeston, Derbyshire, is also badly neglected, although the recently installed fencing offers some protection for the building and for visitors. At Prestongrange Museum, outside Prestonpans in East Lothian, the Hoffman kiln is still standing and visitors can listen to more about it via a mobile phone tour. There is also a nearly complete kiln in Horeb, Carmarthenshire.There is a complete kiln in the restored Tsalapatas brick Factory in Volos Greece that has been converted to an industrial museum. At the Brunswick brickworks in Victoria, Australia, there are two surviving kilns converted to residences, and a chimney from a third kiln, another in Box Hill, also in Melbourne and one in Adelaide, South Australia and also at St Peters in Sydney, New South Wales.Iain Stuart, Why Did the Hoffman Brick and Pottery Works Stop Making Bricks?

However, the date given in Altmann, W. and Frank, P., 1936 is 18 November 1887) was a composer of opera and classical music and a theatre director. Salvi was born in Botta di Sedrina (Provincia di Bergamo), Italy. A student of Gaetano Donizetti, he is best known for having completed the score of Donizetti’s unfinished opera Le duc d’Albe for its first public performance in 1882, some forty years after Donizetti’s death. (The libretto was translated into Italian, and the opera was performed as Il duca d’Alba.) Salvi is usually credited as the composer of the tenor aria “Angelo casto e bel” in Il duca d’Alba, although as he was helped in the reconstruction of Donizetti’s score by several composers, including Amilcare Ponchielli, there has been some dispute as to the degree to which he was the aria’s sole composer.Ashbrook, W., 1998 He died in Rieti, Italy.

Biography Wrede was born at Bücken in the Kingdom of Hanover. He became an associate professor at Breslau in 1893, and full professor in 1896. He died in office in 1906. He became famous for his investigation of the Messianic Secret theme in the Gospel of Mark. He suggested that this was a literary and apologetic device by which early Christians could explain away the absence of any clear claim to be the Messiah. According to Wrede, the solution devised by the author of the Mark Gospel was to imply that Jesus kept his messiahship secret to his inner group of supporters. He also wrote a crucial study of the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians, which argued for its inauthenticity. In his work on Paul, Paulus, he argued that without Paul, Christianity would have basically become just another backwater Jewish sect that would have had little influence in later religious development. As a result, he concluded that Paul was \\"the second founder of Christianity.\\"Wrede, Paul (trans. Edward Lummis; London: Philip Green, 1907), 179. He went so far as to separate Paul from his Jewish background, arguing that Paul was definitely influenced by certain Hellenistic concepts. As a result, his understanding of the flesh/spirit dualism within Paul parallels that of many others who understand flesh from a Hellenistic context where matter itself is inherently corrupted. His work, and that of Albert Schweitzer himself mark the end of the First Quest or Old Quest into the historical Jesus. Schweitzer's 1906 book was called \\"The Quest of the Historical Jesus: A Critical Study of Its Progress from Reimarus to Wrede\\". (See the Quest for the historical Jesus.)

It is a member of the Verbandsgemeinde Maxdorf, together with Maxdorf and Birkenheide.  History  Archaeological findings indicate a settlement existed at the time of the Celts and Romans. The first certified documentary evidence comes from the list of goods of the Prüm Abbey from the year 893. Fußgönheim was owned by members of the Salian dynasty from 900 to 1100, and later the sovereignty changed to the Electoral Palatinate. Fußgönheim was divided into an upper-village (Oberdorf) and a lower-village (Unterdorf), and became a fief of the families of Falkenstein and . Later, the Bolandian possession was sold to the Count of Leiningen. In 1728, from the purchased the hereditary claim of the upper village and one year later he bought the lower village, after which Charles III Philip conferred the right of sovereign over the village to him. In 1740, Jakob Tillmann von Hallberg built Castle Hallberg with a church and introduced the Catholic confession to the place which had been Lutheran since the Reformation. The reign of the Hallberg family ended with the conquest of the Palatinate by the French, who incorporated the village into the Canton of Mutterstadt of the Department of Mont-Tonnerre. Since the departure of the French in 1818, the leadership of the municipality was subject to the mayor and the municipal council. The town was first administered by the District Office of Speyer of the \\"Bavarian Rheinkreis,\\" which was later renamed \\"Palatinate.\\" In 1886, Fußgönheim went to Ludwigshafen, a newly formed district, and is now part of the Rhein-Pfalz- Kreis. The was built between 1933 and 1940. It was later incorporated, with its 1,602 inhabitants, into the neighboring town of Maxdorf, as part of a regional reorganization on June 7, 1969. Demographics= Population development  Population details were first recorded in 1560, at which time around 150-200 people were living there. Until the 19th century, only the eastern route through the village, consisting of Hauptstraße and Ruchheimer Straße, was populated. The settlement of many peasants, craftsmen and merchants led to a strong population increase in the first half of the 19th century from about 500 inhabitants in 1815 to 1,000 in 1840. During this period, the settlement expanded in a westerly direction. Until 1900, the local boundaries remained virtually unchanged, after which most new development was on the western side of the original centre as the steep slope to the Niederterrasse on the eastern border constituted a problem. In 1950, the population of reached 1,500. This was mainly due to building the western road from Bahnhofstraße and Speyerer Straße. The largest increase in population occurred in the 1960s and 1970s following the designation of development areas, and by 1988 had risen to 2,565.  Religion  On October 31, 2014, 40.3 percent of the population was Protestant and 25.6 percent Catholic. The rest belonged to another religion or were nondenominational.  Politics = Coat of arms  Coat of arms The blazon of the coat of arms is: Per fess, the chief per pale. First Or, a wheel gules of six spokes, second azure, an eagle argent armed and langued gules, third a fox courant gules. It was approved in 1927 by the Bavarian State Ministry of the Interior. The fox refers to the origin of the town name, which is derived from Fuchs-Gönheim [lit. fox-Gönheim]. The wheel is reminiscent of the coat of arms of House Bolanden and the eagle of that of the House of Leiningen, both of which are former rulers of the town.

A realtor by profession, Russell first came to prominence by running for the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1966. He was defeated by Calgary lawyer Adrian Berry, but nevertheless ran in the 1967 provincial election as a Liberal in the riding of St. Albert. He finished second of four candidates, 527 votes behind Keith Everitt of Social Credit. In 1969 he ran for the party's leadership again, losing this time to another Calgarian, John T. Lowery. The party had no seats in the legislature at this point, and Lowery responded by exploring coalition options with Social Credit. These explorations were opposed by much of the party's membership, including Russell, and Lowery resigned from the leadership without contesting an election. This time, Russell was successful in becoming Liberal leader. He led the party in the 1971 election, in which it was unsuccessful in winning any seats. Russell himself finished third in St. Albert. Two years later, in a Calgary-Foothills by-election resulting from the death of Len Werry, Russell placed a distant fourth. Following this defeat, he resigned the party leadership in 1974 and was succeeded by Nick Taylor. After leaving provincial politics, Russell became the President of the Liberal Party of Canada in Alberta. During the 1984 federal election, Russell ran as a Liberal in the riding of Pembina. He finished third, as Progressive Conservative Peter Elzinga received more than seventy percent of the vote. In 1986, Russell turned his attention to municipal politics and ran for St. Albert City Council. He finished ninth of thirteen candidates (the top six were elected), which prompted him to comment that he might be finished with politics. However, he ran again in 1989, and was this time elected. In 1992, he ran against incumbent Anita Ratchinsky for mayor. He was defeated, but returned to city council as an alderman in 1995, and was re-elected in 1998. During the 2000 federal election, Russell ran as a Liberal in the riding of St. Albert. He finished a distant second to incumbent Canadian Alliance Member of Parliament John G. Williams, receiving fewer than half the number of votes that Williams did. During his second stint on city council, Russell reversed himself on the West Regional Road debate. While he had previously supported the so-called \\"west bypass\\" alignment that would have seen a bridge cross the Sturgeon River near the mouth of Big Lake, an eleven thousand name petition opposing the alignment apparently convinced him to support the alternative Ray Gibbon Drive alignment, which crossed the river further from the mouth of the lake and was the recommendation of the CityPlan process, a months long municipal planning initiative initiated by council in part in response to the petition. This incurred the wrath of S.E.N.S.I.B.L.E. Choice, a lobby group that publicly endorsed a set of pro-bypass candidates in the 2001 election; Russell, along with fellow pro-Ray Gibbon incumbents Paul Chalifoux, Penny Reeves, and Jim Starko, was defeated. He sought unsuccessfully to return to city council in the 2004 municipal election, and has announced that he intends to run again in the 2007 election. Since leaving municipal politics, Russell has held a number of community and political positions, including president of the Liberal riding association in Edmonton—St. Albert, Director of the St. Albert Senior Citizens Club, co-chair of the Standing Committee on Agriculture of the Liberal Party of Canada in Alberta, and President of the Big Lake Environmental Support Society.

As a surgeon he developed a knee flexion test that was later adapted in a diagnosis of foot and ankle disorders. He was employed at the Sabbatsberg Hospital (1927), Serafimerlasarettet (1936) and Karolinska University Hospital (1940). Silfverskiöld was born to a doctor, the head of a pediatric hospital. In 1911 he graduated from the medical faculty of the Uppsala University, in 1916 received a doctor's degree, in 1924 presented a PhD on the orthopedics of paralysis in children (), and later defended a habilitation. His work was devoted to healing disabled people, including those with missing limbs. In parallel he taught artistic gymnastics (until 1917) and served as a military doctor in Stockholm. Silfverskiöld had strong anti-Nazi and pro-Soviet sympathies. In 1937 during the Spanish Civil War he established a Swedish hospital in Spain to help the Republicans, and later became president of the Swedish-Soviet Federation. Silfverskiöld was married four times. His third marriage was in 1932 with Countess Mary von Rosen. Her family had good relations with Nazi Germany in general and with Hermann Göring in particular. This resulted in a scandal at the wedding of Silfverskiöld and von Rosen, when all the attendants (but not the groom and bride) made the Nazi salute to Göring.

OpenMRS is founded on the principles of openness and sharing of ideas, software and strategies for deployment and use. The system is designed to be usable in very resource poor environments and can be modified with the addition of new data items, forms and reports without programming. It is intended as a platform that many organizations can adopt and modify avoiding the need to develop a system from scratch. OpenMRS, Inc. is a registered non-profit that is the owner of all OpenMRS materials and the maintainer of the software's Public License. This entity will represent the OpenMRS project in legal and financial matters. The software is licensed under of the Mozilla Public License version 2.0 with an added \\"Healthcare Disclaimer\\". It requires that recipients are entitled to freely access the source code, but allows binary distribution, modification of the code (under the same license) and bundling into larger products that are under different licenses. History OpenMRS grew out of the critical need to scale up the treatment of HIV in Africa but from the start was conceived as a general purpose electronic medical record system that could support the full range of medical treatments. The first ideas and prototype of OpenMRS were conceived by Paul Biondich and Burke Mamlin from the Regenstrief Institute, Indiana on a visit to the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare (AMPATH) project in Eldoret, Kenya in February 2004. Around the same time the team at Partners In Health led by Hamish Fraser and Darius Jazayeri were looking at ways to scale up the web-based medical record system developed to manage drug resistant tuberculosis in Peru, and HIV in rural Haiti. Paul, Burke and Hamish met in September 2004 at the Medinfo conference in San Francisco, and recognized they had a common approach to medical information systems and a similar philosophy for healthcare and development and OpenMRS was born. Later, Chris Seebregts of the South African Medical Research Council became the fourth founding member. In 2005, Dr. Andrew S. Kanter from Columbia University joined the team. Dr. Kanter was directing the Millennium Villages Project's (MVP) health information systems and selected OpenMRS for use in the ten MVP countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Design The OpenMRS code is based on a \\"concept dictionary\\" that describes all the data items that can be stored in the system such as clinical findings, laboratory test results or socio- economic data. This approach avoids the need to modify the database structure to add new diseases, for example, and facilitates sharing of data dictionaries between projects and sites. An important feature of OpenMRS is its modular construction which allows the programming of new functions without modifying the core code. OpenMRS is web based but can be deployed on a single laptop or on a large server and runs on Linux, Windows or Mac OS X. Other key features of OpenMRS: * Built on the MySQL database (but uses Hibernate allowing it to be ported to other databases) * Programmed in Java * Includes tools for data export and reporting * Versions currently exist for HIV/AIDS, Drug resistant TB, primary care and oncology * Supports open standards for medical data exchange including HL7, FHIR, LOINC and IXF * Form-based tools, such as the Form Entry module and XForms module * Provides access to between-release code through \\"Continuous Deployment\\" * Bidirectional synchronization with systems such as MoTeCH and TRACnet * The Atlas module, which gives information on all OpenMRS facilities using a visual map * Can be integrated with SMS messaging New features (OpenMRS 1.9 and later): * Allows older versions to run without upgrading * Tools to link to hand held devices and cell phones (using JavaRosa) * Research data collection tools for clinical trials and community data collection projects * New CIEL dictionary entries * Patient dashboard tab-loading rendered on-demand via AJAX to decrease lag Currently being tested/developed: * API support for order entry that provides support of orders within the system * HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) support for OpenMRS * Anatomical drawing tool with pre-loads image and blank canvas options * User interface improvements * Ebola treatment unit electronic medical record as a response to the 2014 Ebola epidemic * Message delivery triggered by a trend in data entry Deployments The first deployment was in Eldoret, Kenya in February 2006 followed by the PIH- supported hospital in Rwinkwavu, Rwanda in August 2006 and Richmond Hospital in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa later that year. As of March 2010, OpenMRS is in use in at least 23 developing countries (mostly in Africa) and it has been used to record over 1 million patient records around the world. Most deployments are run by independent groups who carry out the work on the ground with technical support and training provided by the core team of OpenMRS developers, and other implementers. There have been four annual OpenMRS meetings in South Africa, organized by Chris Seebregts, who also leads the OpenMRS implementers community. Shorter meetings were held in Boston in May 2009, and a developer training in Indianapolis in February 2010. There are five known deployments supporting clinical care in the US - three in Indianapolis, one in Los Angeles, and one in Maryland. OpenMRS use will be expanded in Haiti to assist with the patients recovering from the January 2010 earthquake. In Nigeria, Institute of Human Virology is pushing for OpenMRS penetration in public and private clinics. The institute had a pilot of OpenMRS in 2011 to manage HIV/AIDs patients' records in 27 health facilities, the outcome of the pilot was overwhelming. In 2013, the institute decided to scale-up on OpenMRS and scale-down paper-based systems in all its over 400 health facilities and sub-partners' facilities. There has been tremendous progress in this scale-up.  Distributions  An OpenMRS Distribution is a particular configuration of the OpenMRS Platform, OpenMRS modules, content (concepts, forms, reports, etc.) and other integrated applications, that can be installed and upgraded as a unit. Distributions can be general purpose, targeted at a specific clinical or geographic use case, or specific to a single consumer. The OpenMRS Reference Application is maintained by the OpenMRS community. This distribution is an extensible facility EMR. ThoughtWorks maintains a general purpose OpenMRS distribution called Bahmni. It is an easily configurable out-of-the-box EMR and hospital information system. OpenMRS distributions targeted at specific countries are available for Mozambique (eSaude), Kenya (KenyaEMR), and Uganda (UgandaEMR). Several other distributions are available, or currently being built. Support OpenMRS is supported by core teams from Partners In Health, Regenstrief Institute, and the South African Medical Research Council. Other organizations that collaborate on OpenMRS are the Millennium Villages Project, based at Columbia University, and Baobab Health Systems in Malawi. Some institutes have extended financial and consulting support as well, including The United States Center for Disease Control, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the World Health Organization. A variety of organizations, such as Atlassian, Blueberry Software, and YourKit, have also donated licenses to OpenMRS developers. There are several groups of programmers working on OpenMRS in developing countries including Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, South Africa, Pakistan, Chile, and India. In Rwanda, Partners In Health started local training program called E-Health Software Development and Implementation (EHSDI). The nine-month course was designed to train students in medical information systems, and it focused highly in using the OpenMRS platform. Community The OpenMRS community includes developers, implementers, and users from multiple countries who collaborate through mailing lists, , and annual conferences. Each year, OpenMRS hosts their annual Implementers' Conference; a global meet up of developers and implementers hosted by different countries where OpenMRS is being used on a national scale.

In the summer of 2013, OpenMRS participated as a mentoring organization in the Outreach Program for Women. OpenMRS also held a three-day leadership retreat, OpenMRS Camp 2014, at Bradford Woods. The focus of the camp was to build strategies for growing the OpenMRS community and ensuring its success. OpenMRS held its first OpenMRS Code Jam on November 19, 2014 in Toronto, where it was hosted by ThoughtWorks. OpenMRS is a mentoring organization in Google Code-in 2015.

In the early 1980s, he decided to concentrate more on playing and writing music, working as a session musician with artists in a variety of genres, from Maddy Prior and Isla St Clair to the more commercial pop of Bucks Fizz. In 1982, he and fellow guitarist Grahame Lister wrote a novelty song, \\"Arthur Daley 'E's Alright\\", based on the Arthur Daley character from the British TV series Minder, and including many catchphrases from the show. Unable to find an artist willing to release the song, O'Connor and Lister did it themselves, under the name of 'The Firm'. It spent seven weeks in the UK top 40, peaking at No. 14, and was performed on the TV chart show Top of the Pops on 29 July 1982 featuring former Rubettes guitarist Tony Thorpe on lead vocals. The song also peaked at number 78 in Australia. \\"Long Live the National\\" In 1983, with the future of the Grand National horse race in doubt, The Firm released the song \\"Long Live the National\\" as a single in support of the campaign to keep the race alive. The single did not chart. The following year they released \\"Superheroes\\" written by Lister. \\"Star Trekkin'\\" In 1987, the group recorded another novelty song, this time based on catchphrases from the Star Trek TV series set to a catchy, childlike tune with an increasingly frantic arrangement. Group member Tony Thorpe, formerly of the Rubettes, adopted the stage name Ron Spock in homage to Star Trek character Spock. It was rejected by all the record labels which O'Connor approached with it. Believing it to be worth releasing, O'Connor pressed an initial 500 copies on his own label, Bark Music. The record, \\"Star Trekkin', spent two weeks at number one in the UK and a total of nine weeks in the UK top 40, and reached No. 3 in Australia, with comparable success in Japan and Europe and worldwide sales of over a million copies. Though it received substantial airplay on various radio stations throughout the US, the song did not chart on the Billboard Hot 100. On the back of their success with \\"Star Trekkin'\\", The Firm released an album, Serious Fun, in 1987, through K-Tel in the UK and Dino Music in Australia. As well as \\"Star Trekkin'\\", it included previous singles \\"Arthur Daley ('E's All Right)\\", \\"Superheroes\\" and \\"Cash in Hand\\", plus eight new tracks. In the US, \\"Star Trekkin'\\" was released on the Dr. Demento albums Dr. Demento Presents the Greatest Novelty CD of All Time in 1988, Dr. Demento: 20th Anniversary Collection in 1991, and Dr. Demento: Hits from Outer Space in 2006.

His initial studies were overseen in his village from 1903 to 1906 before moving to a Roman Catholic school at Csíksomlyó (now Şumuleu Ciuc, Romania) from 1907 until 1911. He was at another school from 1911 to 1914 before moving to a high school at Gyulafehérvár (now Alba Iulia, Romania). He graduated from high school in 1915 and was soon after drafted into the Austro-Hungarian armed forces that 15 June. He was involved in battles of World War I as a lieutenant (in the 82nd Securities Division) in different conflict zones and was injured several times (first at Doberdo and then at Oituz and Asiago). The conclusion of the war saw him find work as a farmer and was also a metal worker in Brassó (now Braşov, Romania) from 1918 to 1920. Priesthood Márton circa 1920. In 1920 he commenced his theological studies in Alba Iulia and soon after became a chaplain at Ditrau (July 1924 - 1 July 1925) once he received his ordination to the priesthood in 1924 (in Alba Iulia) from Bishop Gusztáv Károly Majláth. Márton was then made a chaplain at Gheorgheni on 1 July 1925 until being made a professor of religion in that town from 1926 to 1928. He later became a professor of theological studies in a range of different localities and he taught at a high school from 1928 to 1929 in Mureş. Márton served as a priest at Turnu Roşu from 1 July 1929 to 1 October 1930. He was also a court chaplain and an archivist for the Diocese of Alba Iulia after 1930 before serving as a priest at the Cluj college. On 15 March 1936 he was made the brief administrator of Saint Michael's parish in Cluj before being made its actual pastor on 14 August 1938. EpiscopateDuring fascist rule= On 24 December 1938 he was appointed as the Bishop of Alba Iulia in a decree that Pope Pius XI signed. He received his episcopal consecration in 1939 just after that pope's death from Andrea Cassulo before he was enthroned in his new episcopal see. Márton was one of the first intellectuals to oppose the preparations for World War II in public and he had started this in 1938 prior to his appointment as a bishop. He remained in the southern part of Transylvania, which remained part of Romania following the Second Vienna Award in 1940, unlike the northern part, which became part of Hungary. In a speech he gave in Saint Michael's Church - during a visit to Kolozsvár on 18 May 1944 (for the ordination of three new priests) - he condemned the prepared deportation of the Romanian and Hungarian Jews. That week on 22 May he also wrote letters to the Hungarian government as well as to the local police and other authorities requesting the prohibition of the deportation. But the response to his pleas was his expulsion from Alba Iulia. Bust in his honor, Áron Márton Square, Budapest Cluj =During communist rule= In 1945 - after the death of Cardinal Jusztinián Serédi - Pope Pius XII wanted Márton to become the next cardinal for the Hungarian nation, therefore leading Serédi's vacant see. But the opposition of the Hungarian Communists saw another prelate chosen for the position. Márton continued to be a strong advocate for religious freedom and human rights which made him an opponent of the Romanian Communists and of the dictatorial regime that it had established in late 1947. The bishop was arrested on 21 June 1949 and was sentenced to life imprisonment in mid-1951; but in 1953 - with the change of the political climate in Romania - the circumstances of his imprisonment became more bearable. Pius XII in 1949 (while Márton was jailed) even elevated him to the rank of archbishop \\"ad personam\\". He was moved into a villa in the outskirts of Bucharest but was not allowed to have contact with the outside world. He was released in 1955. Márton decided to revisit his bishopric after his release where he received a grand welcome on the part of an enthusiastic crowd. This proved embarrassing for the authorities and he was confined to house arrest following this. Márton was not allowed to leave the bishopric building for the decade and was permitted to emerge later in 1967. He was released as a result of negotiations that Cardinal Franz König had conducted in Bucharest. But Márton was still cautious of possible harassment from the authorities and volunteers often accompanied him on his pastoral visitations to ensure he was safe and left alone. He served as the President of the Romanian Episcopal Conference from 1970 to 1980. In 1972 he was diagnosed with cancer. He travelled several times to Rome where he met with Pope Paul VI. Death Márton submitted his resignation from his diocese to Pope John Paul II and the resignation was later accepted on 2 April 1980. He died not long after this on 29 September and was interred in the diocesan cathedral. During his battle with cancer he had never taken painkillers and continued with his work with great resilience. He was granted the posthumous title \\"Righteous Among the Nations\\" from Yad Vashem in Israel on 27 December 1999 for his activities in defending the Jews during the war. Cardinalate nomination On 22 February 1969 a private audience was held between Pope Paul VI and Monsignor Hieronymus Menges. The latter asked the pope to do something that would encourage the Romanian faithful and the pope asked: \\"what\\"? in response to what he could do. Menges recommended that the pope create both Márton and Iuliu Hossu as cardinals as well as name several priests as monsignors. Paul VI agreed and tasked the then-Archbishop Agostino Casaroli with seeing whether it would be acceptable to the Romanian government. Casaroli dispatched his aide to meet with the Minister for Culture in Bucharest to ask if the double appointment would be welcomed. The Minister assured the aide that Márton's appointment would be acceptable to them but that Hossu was an unacceptable choice. Márton himself learnt that he was to be made a cardinal but refused upon learning that the government had denied Hossu. But the pope circumvented the government: he named Hossu a cardinal \\"in pectore\\" and never made Márton a cardinal. Hossu's secret appointment was not made public until the pope did so on 5 March 1973 after Hossu's 1970 death. Beatification process The beatification cause commenced on 17 November 1992 under Pope John Paul II after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" and titled Márton as a Servant of God. The diocesan phase of the investigation was opened in Alba Iulia on 26 July 1994 and was later closed on 5 December 1996. The documentation was forwarded to the C.C.S. in Rome who validated the process on 23 October 1998. The Positio was delivered for evaluation to the C.C.S. in 2003 and theologians approved the cause on 25 June 2010. The second and current (since 2012) postulator for this cause is Monsignor Kovács Gergely.

The magazine has its headquarters in Royal Oak, Michigan. History Road & Travel Magazine was founded in 1989 by Courtney Caldwell under the name American Woman Motorscene. AWM was the first magazine to address the women's automotive market. Pursuing a connection between auto and travel, editors began adding travel content to expand the magazine's audience. In 2000, AWM became one of the first print publications to transition to an online format. At that time, changed the name to American Woman Road & Travel to more accurately reflect the magazine's editorial content. As the online version began to gain reader traction worldwide, American Woman was dropped from the title to avoid alienation of non-US and male readership, finally resulting in Road & Travel Magazine, a title that more accurately reflected its lifestyle content to a worldwide audience with an interest in automotive, travel and personal safety topics. In 2008, RTM added a section dedicated to environmental topics as they related to auto and travel. In 2017, RTM further expanded its content to include the RV and Camping lifestyle markets. Editorial direction Road & Travel's primary target audience is women between 25 and 59. Caldwell's editorial vision for RTM was an automotive magazine for the average consumer, one that was not geared toward car enthusiasts, therefore making it the rare lifestyle magazine that targets everyday \\"in-market\\" consumers—those looking for information on purchasing autos, trip planning, and safety on the road.  Awards  International Car of the Year Awards In 1997, Road & Travel Magazine launched its annual International Car of the Year Awards (ICOTY) honoring ten new vehicles in ten categories for the upcoming new model year. ICOTY awards became the first awards to honor new vehicles from a theme that reflected lifestyle and life stage; focusing on the emotionally compelling experience consumers have during car buying and ownership. The categories that make up the ICOTY awards are: * International Car of the Year * International Truck of the Year * SUV of the Year - Most Resourceful * Sedan of the Year - Most Dependable * Luxury Car of the Year - Most Respected * Pick Up Truck of the Year - Most Athletic * Crossover of the Year - Most Versatile * Sports Car of the Year - Most Sex Appeal * Minivan of the Year - Most Compatible * Entry-Level Car of the Year - Most Spirited Qualifications include vehicles manufactured by American, British, German, Japanese, Korean and Swedish automakers but are sold in America. In order to achieve a balanced perspective on voting that reflects all consumers, not just one gender, RTM engages a diverse group of 12 men and women renowned automotive journalists from the U.S. and Canada in the voting process. This jury of respected writers represents such publications as the Robb Report, Edmunds.com, Winding Road, MSN Autos, AutoWeek, NY Times, and Autoline Detroit. J.D. Power and Associates tabulates votes to ensure credibility and validity. The annual event takes place in Detroit at the onset of press week for the North American International Auto Show (NAIAS). The event is televised by the local CBS affiliate, WWJ-TV and is presented as a TV special on opening weekend of the NAIAS to consumers. Lifetime Achievement Award In 2004, Road & Travel Magazine introduced an award to honor automotive journalists who have achieved a lifetime of contributions to the automotive industry. The award was designed to acknowledge the talents of those journalists whose lifetime of contributions have helped enrich the world of automobiles. Past recipients include: Denise McCluggage,Denise McCluggage, TheCarConnection.com Jerry Flint, David E. Davis, Jr. and Jim Dunne. (In 1958, McCluggage appeared as a guest challenger on the TV panel show \\"To Tell The Truth\\".)

In 1957 he was appointed as the first Deputy Commander of NORAD. Career Slemon joined the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1922. After an early military career flying Vickers Vedettes, he served as Senior Staff Officer and then as the Commander of Canada's Western Air Command from 1938 to 1941. After a posting to the United Kingdom, Slemon became Senior Air Staff Officer at No. 6 (Canadian) Bomber Group in 1942. During the last year of World War II, Slemon was Deputy Air Officer Commander-in-Chief of the RCAF Overseas. Slemon became Air Officer Commanding Training Command at CFB Trenton in 1949, Chief of the Air Staff in 1953 and Deputy Commander in Chief of NORAD in 1957. On 5 October 1960, warning lights in Cheyenne Mountain Complex indicated that the BMEWS site in Thule, Greenland was detecting a possible ICBM attack. On the five-position scale, the reports were level three, requiring Cheyenne to contact NORAD headquarters, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Canadian Chiefs of Staff Committee, and Strategic Air Command (SAC). The commander on duty at that time was Colonel Robert Gould, whose first call was to NORAD's commander General Laurence Kuter, who was at that time flying and could not be contacted. His next call was to NORAD's second- in-command, Slemon, then located in Cheyenne's counterpart at CFB North Bay. While the call was being connected, the alert status went to level 4, and then 5, indicating the BMEWS site was almost positive an attack was underway, and giving Slemon the authority to order the immediate release of SAC's Airborne Alert force for attack on the USSR. By the time the call was connected, Brigadier General Harris Hull, NORAD's chief of intelligence, joined the call. After the situation was explained, Slemon asked where Khrushchev was at that moment. Hull replied that he was in New York City attending the United Nations. Slemon considered it extremely unlikely that an attack would take place that would likely kill Khrushchev, and asked Hull if there were any intelligence indications that such an attack was being prepared. Hull answered no, and Slemon broke protocol to call off further escalation of the now level-5 alert. Slemon then ordered that the BMEWS based be contacted directly. When they did, it was discovered that the signals were indicating an attack by as many as 1,000 missiles (at that time the Soviets had four ICBMs in service) but there were oddities about the signal. In particular, the signal timing seemed to indicate the targets were at a very long distance, while the computer was reporting they were about away. After much confusion, it was discovered that the radar was detecting the rising Moon. On further exploration, it was found that the computer program that reported distances was dropping digits, so only the remainder of the digits were being displayed, leaving what appeared to be a credible measurement. Slemon retired to Colorado Springs in 1964.

Composed over a two-week period in January/February 1921, its premiere was on 26 March 1922, at the Oper Frankfurt. The work is his third and final in a triptych of expressionist influenced one-act operas - the previous two being Mörder, Hoffnung der Frauen op. 12 (1921), and Das Nusch-Nuschi op. 20 (1921) – and much like the previous works, scandalised Frankfurt’s concert-going public, affording the young composer heightened critical attention and notoriety. Background Sancta Susanna examines the relationship between celibacy and lust in Christianity, depicting the descent of a nunnery into sexual frenzy. Hindemith, around this time in his career has often been regarded, ‘a twenty-four-year-old dabbling in the realm of German expressionism’, and although it cannot be described as a fully fledged work of expressionism, the opera undoubtedly shows a significant reflexivity on the composer’s part to such contemporary artistic trends. Much like his contemporaries, Hindemith spoke of the early twentieth century as a time in which ‘the old world exploded’, and artists were forced to make sense of this changed world by disregarding to a large extent, codes and conventions that had been established - in some cases - for centuries. Thus in the libretto (from the notable expressionist poet and playwright August Stramm) stage directions dominate over speech, which is highly fragmented through ellipses and incomplete phrases. Central to the opera is the expressionistic notion of shock as a means of articulating oneself, and musically, this was achieved to a large extent by pushing harmonic and tonal processes ‘to the very limits of tonality’. Hindemith did not however, divorce himself entirely from formalism, and the work is structured in a series of variations. Critical reaction The controversy generated by the opera upon its premiere is reflected in the difficulty Hindemith faced, getting the work performed in the first place. Among his problems was finding a competent and willing conductor. Fritz Busch, who had premiered the composer’s earlier operas, and who was seen as both progressive, and a champion of Hindemith’s work, refused to offer his services on moral grounds. Upon its premiere, contemporary critic, Karl Grunsky wrote that the performance ‘signifies a desecration of our cultural institutions’, and at a performance in Hamburg, concert goers were required to pledge in writing not to cause a disturbance during the performance. Even as recently as 2007, performances of the work have attracted criticism from Christian organisations. At the same time as it has generated controversy, Sancta Susanna (and more generally Hindemith's operatic triptych) has been praised for its technical excellence. In 1930, Marion Scott wrote in Proceedings of the Musical Association that although the contents of his early operas are unquestionably ‘horrific’, their ‘musical brilliance is equally certain, and “Sancta Susanna” is the cleverest of the bunch.’ The article describes him as ‘the acknowledged leader of the “new music”’, and it is in no small part that his provocative early works contributed to such recognition. Roles * An old nun, contralto * Klementia, contralto * Susanna soprano Synopsis The opera opens in a convent at night, the protagonist, Susanna, lying in prayer in front of an altar. She is approached by a number of figures, the most prominent of whom is Sister Clementia, who states that Susanna is sick, and ‘scarcely live[s] on this earth any longer’. The dialogue is underpinned by a high pedal in the organ, and - in conjunction with conventionally extra- musical sounds such as that of belfry bells, - heightens one's sense of total immersion, and helps reinforce the ritualistic and religious themes. Susanna finds herself increasingly seduced and overpowered, initially by the sweet scents and sounds entering through the chapel window, but soon by the physical presence of her maid-servant, and her lover. Following a Latin invocation of Satan by Susanna, she is cautioned by Sister Clementia, with the tale of a nun, Sister Beata, who gave in to her erotic fantasies, and as a punishment was bricked up behind the altar. Susanna, no longer capable of abstaining, discards her veil, rips the loin cloth from the crucifix in front of her, and demands such punishment from the nuns, who have now congregated around her. Musically, this finale consists of a giddying sequence in woodwind and strings, abruptly cut off by a piercingly dissonant, yet dynamically restrained chord in the upper strings. Following this, vocal and brass forces compete – the nuns all now chanting ‘Satana’ - in what is both a deafening and densely scored series of chordal exchanges.  Sources * Schubert, Giselher.

The station had two tracks, with track one serving trains towards Kirkkonummi and track two towards Helsinki. The station was opened in 1932, then named as Nokka. In that time, there was another station named Luoma, located about a kilometer more towards Helsinki. The station was out of use between 1944 and 1956, as the Porkkala Cape served as a Soviet military base and the frontier passed through the station. When the original Luoma station was abolished in 1978, the Nokka station was renamed as Luoma. Because of very low number of passengers, the station was closed a day after neighbouring station Mankki on 27 March 2016.Major changes to public transport in 2016 – Metro extended to Espoo Connections Only the U and L trains between Kirkkonummi and Helsinki stopped at Luoma, the faster S line did not.

Because of the activities of birdwatchers, these range expansions are well documented. Throughout the last century a number of birds have expanded their range. Birds that were once thought to be only located on the West Coast of have moved eastward all the way to the East Coast, an example would be the Brewer's blackbird. Since the 1950s the Brewer's blackbird, a relative of the red- winged blackbird, has been moving eastward first from the West Coast of Oregon and California to the Great Lakes Region and then towards the East Coast, with the range expanding from Coast to Coast according to the Audubon's 2005 Christmas Bird Count. The Inca dove first arrived as a native of Mexico and has slowly expanded Northward into Kansas and Arkansas. Great tailed grackles have also moved in similar fashion northward. Another region with documented range expansions is South Africa, where a number of birds have expanded westwards into the Western Cape province from other provinces due to habitat modification by humans and introductions. Examples of these include the Helmeted Guineafowl (introduced) and the Hadeda Ibis (natural expansion). Range expansion may be explained by several different reasons. Reasons for range expansion The largest reason for a bird to expand its range is to draw greater resources. Once resources for food, nesting, and potential mates become scarce in a particular area, birds and other animals move out of those areas to find new resources. Range expansion is a crucial component of evolution; however expansions are presently occurring at an alarming rate. One of the reasons for increased expansion is due to human alteration. Human causes such as changing of habitat and global climate change are leading factors in avian range expansion. Species that were previously adapted to the old niche are often replaced by species that are more adapted for newly created niche. For example, when forests are replaced by more urban areas, species such as the Inca dove are replaced by the mourning dove, allowing the mourning dove to expand its range. Bird populations are not static and naturally change over time. However, due to human effects such as global climate change and loss of habitat, a number of species are expanding in a particular range as the native species they displace are declining. In addition to environmental aspects that cause range expansion and subsequent decline of certain species, humans have introduced species that are largely responsible for decline of native species. Exotic species, such as the European starling which were introduced by Eugene Schieffelin in 1890 in New York City and then expanded to California by 1955, often do very well in new habitats. The lack of predators and new niche offer perfect conditions for the introduced species to flourish. These \\"exotic\\" species often displace other native species. For example, the European starling pursues aggressive breeding strategies that help it colonize new breeding areas. The European starling is an early breeder and out competes other native cavity nesters for nesting sites. Other cavity nesters include the kestrels, flycatchers, swallows, wrens, and bluebirds. The urbanization of much America also aids in the spread of the European starling (Podluka et al. 2004, Askins 2000, Elrich et al. 1998). Examples of when range expansion imperils other species=The barred owl and the northern spotted owl In the 1970s the logging of old- growth forests accelerated, and the numbers of the northern spotted owl began to decline. Beginning in 1912 the barred owl began expanding its range westward and northward. Once considered an East Coast resident, the barred owl moved into the Rocky Mountains and southern Canada, into the spotted owl's territory. The barred owl is extremely adaptable, whereas the northern spotted owl is much more stagnate. The barred owl can live in virtually any forest and eat almost anything. The northern owl is adapted to best survive in old growth forest and relies mainly on the flying squirrel as a food resource. Much like human counterparts, as the barred owl expanded westward these larger more adaptable birds forced native owls, such as the northern owl, off their territory. The barred owl is about 20% larger and will feast on flying squirrels out of convenience. Biologists have noted a severe decline in the breeding population of northern owls, whereas the barred owl populations thrive (Levy, 2004). The brown-headed cowbird and other songbirds The brown-headed cowbird is a brood parasite, which places its own eggs in nest of other birds, placing the burden of parenting on other birds. The brown-headed cowbird is thought to have a center of origin in the Great Plains of North America, but has expanded in both directions to spread across most of North America. The behavior of the brown-headed cowbird causes range expansion at the expense of other birds such as warblers, sparrows, and vireos. The efforts required for raising the cowbird chick often exhaust the parent and lead to either the death of the parent or the death of the other chicks within the nest, thus decreasing the chances of reproduction for that songbird. In a study conducted by the University of British Columbia, cowbird parasitism was shown to be a direct cause of population declines in black-capped vireos, Bell's vireo, and the southwestern willow flycatcher (Levy, 2004). Conclusion Avian species have expanded their range since long before humans. In fact the geographical range of avian species is often a very dynamic phenomenon, with the ranges of various species expanding and some contracting. Range expansions are important because they often signal changing habitats, whether the reason can be explained by natural causes or more often human aided causes. Avian range expansion can produce considerable effects in both the population numbers of the invaded species as well as numbers of hybrid species created. The interaction of invading species and native species is often very dynamic. References * Podulka, S., W. Rohrbaugh, Jr., and R. Bonney. 2004. Handbook of Bird Biology. Cornell lab of Ornithology.

WSNs are networks of small, battery-powered, memory-constraint devices named sensor nodes, which have the capability of wireless communication over a restricted area.Akyildiz, I.F., W. Su, Y. Sankarasubramaniam, and E. Cayirci, \\"A survey on sensor networks\\", IEEE Communications Magazine, vol.40, no.8, pp. 102-114, August 2002. Due to memory and power constraints, they need to be well arranged to build a fully functional network. Key distribution schemes Key predistribution is the method of distribution of keys onto nodes before deployment. Therefore, the nodes build up the network using their secret keys after deployment, that is, when they reach their target position. Key predistribution schemes are various methods that have been developed by academicians for a better maintenance of PEA management in WSNs. Basically a key predistribution scheme has 3 phases: # Key distribution # Shared key discovery # Path-key establishment During these phases, secret keys are generated, placed in sensor nodes, and each sensor node searches the area in its communication range to find another node to communicate. A secure link is established when two nodes discover one or more common keys (this differs in each scheme), and communication is done on that link between those two nodes. Afterwards, paths are established connecting these links, to create a connected graph. The result is a wireless communication network functioning in its own way, according to the key predistribution scheme used in creation. There are a number of aspects of WSNs on which key predistribution schemes are competing to achieve a better result. The most critical ones are: local and global connectivity, and resiliency. Local connectivity means the probability that any two sensor nodes have a common key with which they can establish a secure link to communicate. Global connectivity is the fraction of nodes that are in the largest connected graph over the number of all nodes. Resiliency is the number of links that cannot be compromised when a number of nodes(therefore keys in them) are compromised. So it is basically the quality of resistance against the attempts to hack the network. Apart from these, two other critical issues in WSN design are computational cost and hardware cost. Computational cost is the amount of computation done during these phases. Hardware cost is generally the cost of the memory and battery in each node. Keys may be generated randomly and then the nodes determine mutual connectivity.Eschenauer, L. and V.D.Gligor, \\"A key management scheme for distributed sensor networks\\", in Proceedings of the 9th ACM conference on Computer and communications security, Washington DC, USA, November 18–22, 2002, 41-47. A structured approach based on matrices that establishes keys in a pair-wise fashion is due to Rolf Blom.Blom, R.. An optimal class of symmetric key generation systems. Advances in Cryptology: Proceedings of EUROCRYPT 84 (Thomas Beth, Norbert Cot, and Ingemar Ingemarsson, eds.), Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer-Verlag, 209:335–338, 1985. Many variations to Blom's scheme exist. Thus the scheme of Du et al. combines Blom’s key pre-distribution scheme with the random key pre-distribution method with it, providing better resiliency.Du, W. et al., A Pairwise Key Pre- distribution Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks.

It was developed by the Naval Torpedo Station Newport concurrently with the Mark 14 and was first deployed in 1938. It replaced the Mark 8 torpedo on surface ships with tubes that could accommodate the longer Mark 15; this primarily included destroyers built after 1930. Older destroyers, primarily the Wickes and Clemson classes, continued to use the Mark 8, as did PT boats early in World War II. During the war 9,700 were produced at Newport and at the Naval Ordnance Station Forest Park, Illinois.Milford, Frederick J. \\"U. S. Navy Torpedoes. Part One: Torpedoes through the thirties.\\" The Submarine Review, April 1996. The Mark 15 had the same basic design problems that plagued the Mark 14 for the first 20 months following U.S. entry into the war, though this was not realized nearly as quickly by the destroyer crews as it was by the submariners. One major shared deficiency was the Mark 6 exploder, which usually caused duds. Another was a tendency to run deeper than set, often missing the target. Surface-combatant torpedo attacks very often included confusing splashes from gunnery and aerial bombs, obscuring smoke screens, and quick maneuvering to evade counterattack. Rarely was a destroyer given a chance for a slow, careful surprise attack. Torpedo results were difficult to estimate under these circumstances. The correction of the Mark 15's problems would depend on the submariners solving theirs.Milford, Frederick J. \\"U. S. Navy Torpedoes. Part Two: The Great Torpedo Scandal, 1941–43.\\" The Submarine Review, October 1996. Another problem with early war-built Mark 15s was the substitution of zinc for cadmium as interior plating for air flask sections and water compartments, due to a wartime shortage of cadmium. This resulted in zinc oxide clogging water strainers, leading to erratic runs and engine failures. After the failure of corrosion inhibition efforts, the ultimate solution was to re-coat the areas with cadmium or phenolic resin (Heresite).Rowland and Boyd, pp. 91-94, 99-109 The Battle of Vella Gulf on the night of August 6–7, 1943, was the first in which a surprise torpedo attack by U.S. gave the Americans an overwhelming advantage in the following gun battle, though one Japanese warship was hit by a dud torpedo and escaped. By September 1943, effective methods of torpedo deployment were beginning to be distributed to all U.S. destroyers. Tactics Above-water Mark 15 torpedo tube installation mounted on destroyers firing a Mark 15 torpedo, circa 1953. Anticipating the possibility of war with Japan, the United States planned to move their battleships across the Pacific with the fleet train. Cruisers and destroyers would be responsible for defending this large formation at night. Fleet exercises held during the 1930s revealed the confusing nature of close range engagements during hours of darkness. In 1932, during Fleet Problem XIII, \\"attacking\\" destroyers closed to within of before being detected. Fleet Problem XV in 1934 placed the destroyer screen beyond the battleship formation, but the battleships were unable to differentiate \\"friend\\" from \\"foe\\" at that distance. Screening destroyers were subsequently stationed at effective searchlight illumination range, . Recognition improved at that distance, but torpedo hit probability increased as evasive maneuvering of the large, compact force was restricted within the closer screen. United States Navy War Instructions (FTP 143) published in 1934 remained in effect through the initial 1942 engagements in the Solomon Islands. The instructions emphasized defense to avoid the attrition objective of Japanese planning: * Cruisers were advised to avoid night action unless conditions were favorable. * Destroyers were to attack at once with guns, but reserve torpedoes for use against capital ships. Searchlight illumination range effectively covered launch positions of United States torpedoes, but not the Japanese Type 93 torpedo. Japanese ships could remain outside of illumination range, launching torpedoes at American ships revealing their position with gunfire and searchlights.

She held the Walter Prescott Webb Chair in History and Ideas from 2008 to 2017 and is Mastin Gentry White Professor of Southern History at the University of Texas at Austin. Her expertise is in American social history in addition to writing on economics (including feminist economics), race, slavery, and class. She is a Macarthur Fellow, Bancroft Prize Winner, and has been a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize twice.  Background  Jones was born in Delaware. Jones' mother taught at Delaware Technical and Community College. Her father, Albert P. Jones (died 1995), worked for DuPont and was the president of the Delaware State Board of Education for many years; she attended an elementary school in Christiana, Delaware named after him in 1996. Jones received a B.A. in 1970 from the University of Delaware, and a Ph.D. in 1976 from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. She has held academic positions at Wellesley College, Brown University and Brandeis University. In July 1999 Jones was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship. Although the award typically allows academics to take time off from their teaching, she decided to wait before beginning her research and worked through the period of the fellowship, saying, \\"I think I will take time off in a few years, but I really like being here on campus, being around my colleagues, teaching.\\" Jones has also been awarded a Ford Fellowship, a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship, and an American Council of Learned Societies Fellowship, and was twice a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in history. She is married to the Political Scientist and Law Professor Jeffrey Abramson, author of We, The Jury and Minerva's Owl, among other texts. The couple has two daughters, Sarah Jones Abramson and Anna Jones Abramson.  Ideas and awards  In 1986, Jones's second book Labor of Love, Labor of Sorrow: Black Women, Work, and the Family from Slavery to the Present won her the Bancroft Prize. In Labor of Love, Labor of Sorrow, Jones demonstrates her extensive knowledge of the history of the South from 1830 to 1915. The book begins as a study of African Americans and the hardships they faced during the nineteenth century, but then develops to include commentary on the impact of class and gender on women in the South. The book goes on to debunk ideas about 'race' and also to blend analysis of the hardships faced by women and blacks into a single integrated picture centering on the figure of the black working-class woman. The book's combination of historical and feminist scholarship is characteristic of Jones's career. Upon winning a MacArthur fellowship Jones noted that finishing her Bancroft-winning volume inspired her to write her third book, The Dispossessed, America's Underclasses from the Civil War to the Present, which examines poverty in America across the boundaries of race and gender. That book would go on to win her a Choice Award for Outstanding Academic Title in 1992 as well as finalist standing for the Lillian Smith Award for non-fiction. In 2001, Jones published Creek Walking, a memoir of her childhood in Delaware during the 1950s. Although her expertise is primarily in African American history, Jones's books range widely in their coverage, from the effect of economic policies on workers' lives to American educational history. Her understanding of women's history has gained her recognition outside her own field among feminist circles, and she continues to reach non- academic audiences with the expansion of her areas of research. American Work: Four Centuries of Black and White Labor was a History Book Club Selection and in 2002 she was named a fellow in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Jones has reflected in an interview that her work involves \\"writing about issues of race and class and how the United States has changed over the years, how different groups have viewed each other and interacted, how certain groups have been assigned certain kinds of work.\\" Her history writing increasingly features case studies focusing on the overlooked but nonetheless exemplary lives of individuals. Her most recent book, A Dreadful Deceit: The Myth of Race From the Colonial Era to Obama’s America, was published in 2013. When asked by Politico Magazine to weigh in on which historical figures Donald Trump was comparable to, Jones said he echoed the comments of past Mississippi Governor James K. Vardaman.

He was a three-quarter for the Australian national team, and played in eight tests between 1919 and 1922, two as captain. Playing career=Club career He was born and grew up in Balmain, Sydney, and started playing rugby league at a junior level when the game commenced in Australia in 1908. In 1911 he made his first grade debut with the Balmain Tigers at half-back. Following Arthur Halloway's move to the Tigers in 1915, Johnston moved to five-eighth and their strong halves partnership was one of factors enabling Balmain to three consecutive premiership titles from 1915 to 1917. He joined Wests for the 1918 season, then spent two years as captain- coach at Newtown 1919-20. Following his Australian representative appearances in 1920 the admission of the St George Dragons meant that Johnston being a local resident had to play with the club, which he did for his final two club seasons of 1921 and 1922. Representative career In 1912 he was selected in a Sydney Metropolis side. In 1913 he was in a New South Wales touring squad to New Zealand as half-back but was kept out of the major matches by the form of his peer Arthur Halloway. He captained New South Wales in some 1918 games and then made his Australian Test debut in 1919 on Australia's tour of New Zealand. He scored a try on debut assisting Australia to a 44-21 victory. With tour captain Halloway unfit for the 3rd Test Johnston led the side to a series victory in Auckland in the process becoming Australia's 11th Kangaroo captain. In 1920 Johnston was chosen for the first Test of the domestic Ashes series. He captained the side to an 8-4 victory over England. Herb Gilbert took over as captain for the 2nd and 3rd Tests but Johnston's continued successful halves pairing with Queenslander Duncan Thompson set a platform for the talented backline featuring Harold Horder, Dick Vest and Gilbert, and Australia won the series and the Ashes for the first time on home soil. Johnston did not captain Australia again. He appeared for New South Wales through till 1922 and toured with the 1921-22 Kangaroos playing in the 1st Test and in 11 tour matches. Coaching career Johnston coached Newtown in 1923, 1925 and 1926 and Wests in 1924. He coached St George in 1933-35 taking the club to their first premiership final.

James I, the first king to reign in both England and Scotland, faced many difficulties with the Parliament of England. Though recent studies have shown that the Parliament of Scotland may have been more of a thorn in his side than was previously believed, James developed his political philosophy of the relationship between monarch and parliament in Scotland and never reconciled himself to the independent stance of the English Parliament and its unwillingness to bow readily to his policies. Overview The crucial source of concern was that the King and Parliament adhered to two mutually, extended exclusive views about the nature of their relationship. James I believed that he owed his authority to God-given right, that the law(s) of, and in, \\"His\\" Kingdom were only an extension of his royal prerogative, and that Parliament was in essence a lower Court to him, its laws and opinions always subject to his oversight and review; and that he was free to revise or overrule them completely whenever he wished. In the areas Royal administration and governmental policy (i.e., how the government did its business and what directions it took in the affairs of the country), the King saw no role for Parliament or to be informally bound by its opinions at all. Parliament on the other hand, particularly the Commons, first of all saw the relationship as a partnership. Parliament believed the king ruled by contract (an unwritten one, yet fully binding). Parliament believed that its own rights to exist and to function in the ongoing work of the government of the country were as sacrosanct as those of the King and, in that sense, Parliament's rights were equal to those of the King. Furthermore, Parliament believed that in return for grants of subsidies to the Crown, the king should take its views on policy formulation and execution into account. The end result of this fundamental disagreement was a series of difficult parliaments, two of which James dissolved in frustration. Many historians, from the mid-seventeenth century to the present, have traced the problems with Parliament faced by James's son, Charles I, to those experienced by James, though others have questioned the inevitability of Charles's fatal clashes with Parliament. Theory of monarchy In 1597–8, James wrote two works, The Trew Law of Free Monarchies and Basilikon Doron (Royal Gift), in which he established an ideological base for monarchy. In the Trew Law, he sets out the divine right of kings, explaining that for Biblical reasons kings are higher beings than other men, though \\"the highest bench is the sliddriest to sit upon\\".\\"Kings are called gods by the prophetical King David because they sit upon God His throne in earth and have the count of their administration to give unto Him.\\" Quoted by Willson, p 131. The document proposes an absolutist theory of monarchy, by which a king may impose new laws by royal prerogative but must also pay heed to tradition and to God, who would \\"stirre up such scourges as pleaseth him, for punishment of wicked kings\\".Croft, pp 131–133. Basilikon Doron, written as a book of instruction for the four-year-old Prince Henry, provides a more practical guide to kingship.Willson, p 133. Despite banalities and sanctimonious advice,A king, James advised, should not look like \\"a deboshed waster\\" (Croft, p135) and should avoid the company of women, \\"which are no other thing else but irritamenta libidinis\\" (Willson, p 135). the work is well written, perhaps the best example of James's prose.\\"The Basilikon Doron is the best prose James ever wrote.\\" Willson, p 132; \\"James wrote well, scattering engaging asides throughout the text.\\" Croft, pp 134–5. James's advice concerning parliaments, which he understood as merely the king's \\"head court\\", foreshadows his difficulties with the English Commons: \\"Hold no Parliaments,\\" he tells Henry, \\"but for the necesitie of new Lawes, which would be but seldome\\".Croft, p 133. In the True Law James states that the king owns his realm as a feudal lord owns his fief, because: > \\"[Kings arose] before any estates or ranks of men, before any parliaments > were holden, or laws made, and by them was the land distributed, which at > first was wholly theirs. And so it follows of necessity that kings were the > authors and makers of the laws, and not the laws of the kings.\\"Quoted by > Willson, p 132. James was ambitious to build on the personal union of the crowns of Scotland and England (the Union of the Crowns) to establish a complete and permanent union of the two realms under one monarch, one parliament and one law, a plan which met opposition in both countries.Croft, pp 52–54. \\"Hath He not made us all in one island,\\" James told the English parliament, \\"compassed with one sea and of itself by nature indivisible?\\" In April 1604, however, the Commons refused on legal grounds his request to be titled \\"King of Great Britain\\".English and Scot, James insisted, should \\"join and coalesce together in a sincere and perfect union, as two twins bred in one belly, to love one another as no more two but one estate\\". Willson, p 250. A disappointed James retorted: \\"I am not ashamed of my project, neither have I deferred it (I be to deal plainly) out of a liking of the judges' reasons or uses\\". In October 1604, he assumed the title \\"King of Great Britain\\" by proclamation rather than statute, though Sir Francis Bacon told him he could not use the style in \\"any legal proceeding, instrument or assurance\\".Willson, pp 249–52. The decision was a sign that where he lacked the consent of the Commons for his policies, James intended, unlike his predecessor, to resort to the royal prerogative. King and Parliament Portrait of James by John de Critz, circa 1606 James's difficulties with his first parliament in 1604 ended the initial euphoria of his succession.Croft, p 62. On 7 July, he prorogued the parliament, having achieved his aims neither for the full union nor for the obtaining of funds. \\"I will not thank where I feel no thanks due,\\" he remarked in his closing speech. \\"...I am not of such a stock as to praise fools...You see how many things you did not well...I wish you would make use of your liberty with more modesty in time to come\\".Quoted by Croft, p 62. The parliament of 1604 may be seen as shaping the attitudes of both sides for the rest of the reign, though the difficulties owed more to mutual incomprehension than conscious enmity.Croft, p 63. On the eve of the state opening of the next parliamentary session on 5 November 1605, a soldier called Guy Fawkes was discovered in the cellars of the parliament buildings guarding a pile of slaves, not far from about twenty barrels of gunpowder with which he intended to blow up Parliament House the following day and cause the destruction, as James put it, \\"not only...of my person, nor of my wife and posterity also, but of the whole body of the State in general\\".Stewart, p 219. A Catholic conspiracy led by a disaffected gentleman called Robert Catesby, the Gunpowder Plot, as it quickly became known, had in fact been discovered in advance of Fawkes's arrest and deliberately allowed to mature in order to catch the culprits red-handed and the plotters unawares.The plot had been exposed after one of the conspirators, Francis Tresham, warned his brother-in-law, Lord Monteagle, on October 26, with the note: \\"They shall receive a terrible blow this Parliament, and yet they shall not see who hurts them. The danger is past as soon as you have burned the letter\\". Monteagle had the note read aloud, possibly to warn the plotters the secret was out, and promptly handed it over to Cecil. Willson, p 224. James's difficulties with the Commons and his waning public popularity notwithstanding,For example, Archbishop Matthew Hutton of York informed James in December 1604 of widespread criticism of his extravagance and his devotion to hunting. Croft, p 63. the sensational discovery of the Gunpowder Plot aroused a potent wave of national relief at the delivery of the king and his sons and inspired in the ensuing parliament a mood of loyalty and goodwill which Salisbury astutely exploited to extract higher subsidies for the king than any but one granted in Elizabeth's reign.Croft, p 64. In his speech to both houses on 9 November, James expounded on two emerging preoccupations of his monarchy: the divine right of kings and the Catholic question. He insisted that the plot had been the work of a few Catholics and not of the English Catholics as a whole.James said it did not follow \\"that all professing that Romish religion were guilty of the same\\". Quoted by Stewart, p 225. And he reminded the assembly to rejoice at his survival, since kings were gods and he owed his escape to a miracle.Willson, p 226. The \\"Goodwin Case\\" drew a dispute in the early portion of James's reign. Sir Francis Goodwin, a known outlaw, was elected to parliament as MP for the constituency of Buckinghamshire. The election of outlaws had been prohibited by royal proclamation and James demanded that the commons exclude Goodwin from its membership. However, the commons claimed it should be the judge of its own election results and James, after some dispute, pragmatically backed down. This event did, however, create animosity between crown and parliament. \\"The Great Contract\\" As James's reign progressed, his government faced growing financial pressures. Some of those resulted from creeping inflation and the decreasing purchasing power of the royal income,Croft, p 69. but James's profligacy and financial incompetence substantially contributed to the mounting debt. Salisbury took over the reins as Lord Treasurer himself in 1608 and, with the backing of the Privy Council, introduced a programme of economic reforms which steadily drove down the deficit. In an attempt to convince James to curb his extravagance, he wrote a series of frank tracts on the matter,\\"It is not possible,\\" Salisbury wrote, \\"for a king of England... to be rich or safe, but by frugality\\". Croft, p 75. and he tried to induce the king to grant limited pensions to his courtiers, rather than showering them with random gifts.Croft, p 75. A believer in the necessity of parliamentary contribution to government,\\"All wise princes, whensoever there was cause to withstand present evils or future perils...have always addressed themselves to their Parliaments.\\" Quoted by Croft, p 76. Salisbury proposed to the Commons, in February 1610, an ambitious financial scheme, known as The Great Contract, whereby Parliament would grant a lump sum of £600,000 to pay off the king's debts in return for ten royal concessions,For example, Salibury proposed to reform, and, when pressed, to abolish, the resented Court of Wards, through which the Crown seized any vacant fiefs where the heir was under age and sold them on its own account. Croft, p 61. plus an annual grant of £200,000. Though the Commons agreed to the annual grant, the negotiations over the lump sum became so protracted and difficult that James eventually lost patience and dismissed the parliament on 31 December 1610.He had heard rumours, possibly circulated by his Scottish favourite, Robert Carr, of a petition that he send all Scots home. Croft, p 79, p 87. \\"Your greatest error,\\" he told Salisbury, \\"hath been that ye ever expected to draw honey out of gall\\".Croft, p 80. Salisbury, however, made it clear that without parliamentary subsidies, he could do no more to manage the Crown's financial crisis.Croft, p 81; \\"I have seen this Parliament at an end,\\" Cecil wrote to Sir Thomas Lake, \\"whereof the many vexations have so overtaken one another as I know not what to resemble them so well as to the plagues of Job.\\" Willson, p 268; Stewart, p 244. The subsequent downfall of the Howards left George Villiers, now earl of Buckingham, unchallenged as the supreme figure in the government by 1618.Willson, p 397. James had been attempting to rule without Parliament since the \\"Addled Parliament\\" of 1614, which he had dissolved after eight weeks when it proved reluctant to grant him money.Willson, p 348. Buckingham addressed the search for alternative revenues, employing officials, such as the businessman Lionel Cranfield, who were astute in raising and saving money for the Crown.Sir Henry Wotton wrote that Buckingham \\"had learned at court, first to sift and question well, and to supply his own defects by the drawing or flowing unto him of the best instruments of experience and knowledge, from whom he had a sweet and attractive manner to suck what might be for the public or his own proper purpose.\\" Quoted by Willson, p 397. Cash was also raised by selling earldoms and other dignities, many created by James himself.Willson, p 409. The Spanish match Sir Edward Coke Another potential source of income was the prospect of a Spanish dowry from a marriage between Charles, Prince of Wales and the Spanish Infanta, Maria.Willson, p 357. The policy of the Spanish Match, as it was called, was supported by the Howards and other Catholic-leaning ministers and diplomats—together known as the Spanish Party—but deeply distrusted in Protestant England, a sentiment voiced vociferously in the Commons when James finally called a parliament in 1621 to raise funds for a military expedition in support of Frederick V, Elector Palatine. By the 1620s, events on the continent had stirred up anti-Catholic feeling to a new pitch. A conflict had broken out between the Catholic Holy Roman Empire and the Protestant Bohemians, who had deposed the emperor as their king and elected James's son-in-law, Frederick V, Elector Palatine, in his place, triggering the Thirty Years' War.Willson, pp 408–416. James reluctantly summoned parliament as the only means to raise the funds necessary to assist his daughter Elizabeth and Frederick, who had been ousted from Prague by Emperor Ferdinand II in 1620. The Commons on the one hand granted subsidies inadequate to finance serious military operations in aid of Frederick,Willson, p 417. and on the other called for a war directly against Spain.Willson, p 421. In November 1621, led by Sir Edward Coke, they framed a petition asking not only for a war with Spain but for Prince Charles to marry a Protestant, and for enforcement of the anti-Catholic laws.When James heard of the petition, he is said to have cried, \\"God give me patience\\". Willson, p 421. James flatly told them not to interfere in matters of royal prerogative or they would risk punishment;Willson, p 442. to which provocation they reacted by issuing a statement protesting their rights, including freedom of speech.James wrote: \\"We cannot with patience endure our subjects to use such anti-monarchical words to us concerning their liberties, except they had subjoined that they were granted unto them by the grace and favour of our predecessors.\\" Quoted by Willson, p 423. Urged on by Buckingham and the Spanish ambassador Gondomar, James ripped the protest out of the record book and dissolved Parliament.Willson, p 243. Denied the military option, James ignored public opinion and returned to the Spanish match as his only hope of restoring the possessions of Elizabeth and Frederick. When negotiations began to drag, Prince Charles, now 23, and Buckingham, decided to seize the initiative and travel to Spain incognito,They travelled under the names Thomas and John Smith. Croft, p 118. to win the Infanta directly. Arriving in Madrid on 17 February 1623 to the astonishment of King Philip IV, the impetuous delegation proved a desperate mistake. Charles and Buckingham had no idea that Maria was strongly averse to marrying a non-Catholic and that the Spanish, who had been protracting the marriage negotiations to keep British troops out of the war, would never agree to such a match unless Charles converted to Catholicism and pledged to repeal the anti-Catholic laws.Croft, pp 118–119. Though a secret treaty was signed, the prince and duke returned to England in October without the Infanta, much to the delight of the British people.\\"There was an immense outbreak of popular joy, with fireworks, bell ringing and street parties.\\" Croft, p 120. Embittered by their treatment in Spain, Charles and Buckingham now turned James’s Spanish policy upon its head and called for a French match and a war against the Habsburg empire.Croft, pp 120–121. To raise the necessary finance, they prevailed upon James to call another Parliament, which met in February 1624. For once, the outpouring of anti- Catholic sentiment in the Commons was echoed in court, where control of policy had shifted from James to Charles and Buckingham,\\"The aging monarch was no match for the two men closest to him.

It began in 2004 as The British Postal Museum & Archive and opened in Central London as The Postal Museum on 28 July 2017. Sites Post Office vehicles in the BPMA's collection. The Postal Museum operates three sites: The museum at Phoenix Place, London near the Mount Pleasant sorting office in Clerkenwell, a museum store in Loughton, Essex and The Museum of the Post Office in the Community, located about the post office in Blists Hill Victorian Town, Shropshire. Origins The Public Records Act 1838 was the first step in organizing government archives, including the civil service department known then as ‘the Post Office’. This represents the beginnings of what is now The Royal Mail Archive. By 1896 a report concerning the maintenance of Post Office records had been produced and the first archivist was appointed. The Public Records Acts of 1958 and 1967 reinforced the need for the Post Office to keep, catalogue and make its archive records available. In 1966, the first National Postal Museum (NPM) was established, in part due to The Phillips Collection of Victorian philately being donated to the nation by Reginald M. Phillips. The museum was opened by the Queen on 19 February 1969, at King Edward Building near St Paul's Cathedral in London. A collection of postal equipment, uniforms, vehicles and much more was developed over the years; far more than could be displayed in the small museum. In 1998, the King Edward Building was sold, and the NPM closed. The collections were retained and the management of the museum and archive was combined. This was known as the Heritage unit of the Post Office (then renamed Consignia, then Royal Mail Group). Royal Mail Group decided to transfer the work of this heritage unit to an independent charitable trust, in light of the changing mail market and its own shift from public service to competitive business. This 'Postal Heritage Trust' came into being in April 2004, and was branded as the British Postal Museum & Archive. The Postal Museum booth at Spring Stampex 2016. From 2004, the BPMA expanded its work into providing a programme of events, exhibitions, education and web resources. New Postal Museum In February 2016, the BPMA was renamed the Postal Museum, and began building a new museum which opened in 2017 in Clerkenwell, London, near to the Mount Pleasant Mail Centre. The museum was expected to cost £26 million to build, and consists of two sections. The Postal Museum has opened up to the public a stretch of track in London's Mail Rail, which was the world’s first driverless electric railway. In the museum section, anticipated attractions include a commemorative stamp that would have been used had Scotland won the 1978 FIFA World Cup, telegrams from the night that the Titanic sank, and an intercepted first edition of Ulysses (banned in the United Kingdom until 1936). Relationship with Royal Mail The Postal Museum is an independent charity but is strongly linked with Royal Mail Group. The former director of the Postal Museum is Adrian Steel.\\"Nerves of Steel\\" by Andrew Neish in British Philatelic Bulletin, Vol. 51, No. 5, January 2014, pp. 144–147. The Postal Museum receives an annual payment from Royal Mail for managing the Royal Mail archive. Although the archive is part of the Postal Museum, because it is a public record, the ultimate responsibility for it lies with Royal Mail. The records have been given official designated status which means that they are recognised as nationally important, and are available to researchers to consult.

It is triggered by exposure to avian proteins present in the dry dust of the droppings and sometimes in the feathers of a variety of birds. The lungs become inflamed, with granuloma formation. Birds such as pigeons, parakeets, cockatiels, shell parakeets (budgerigars), parrots, turtle doves, turkeys and chickens have been implicated. People who work with birds or own many birds are at risk. Bird hobbyists and pet store workers may also be at risk. Signs and symptoms This disease is an inflammation of the alveoli in the lungs caused by an immune response to inhaled allergens from birds. Initial symptoms include shortness of breath (dyspnea), especially after sudden exertion or when exposed to temperature change, which can resemble asthma, hyperventilation syndrome or pulmonary embolism. Chills, fever, non-productive cough and chest discomfort may also occur. Upon re-exposure to avian proteins, sensitized individuals will typically experience symptoms within 4–6 hours or sooner. In the chronic form there is usually anorexia, weight loss, extreme fatigue and progressive pulmonary fibrosis, which is generally the most serious consequence of the disease because it progressively and irreversibly diminishes the lungs' efficiency over time. As a result, sufferers may have repeated chest infections and ultimately struggle to breathe. This condition can eventually be fatal. Differential diagnosis A definitive diagnosis can be difficult without invasive testing, but extensive exposure to birds combined with reduced diffusing capacity are strongly suggestive of this disease. X-ray or CT scans will show physical changes to the lung structure (a ground glass appearance) as the disease progresses. Precise distribution and types of tissue damage differ among similar diseases, as does response to treatment with Prednisone. There are two forms of BFL: acute and chronic. Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) can occur with acute respiratory failure; progressive interstitial fibrosis is typical of the chronic form. In both, the underlying inflammatory response stops upon exclusion of the allergen, but symptoms may persist depending on the degree of damage already sustained. Among invasive procedures, bronchoalveolar lavage typically shows prominent lymphocytosis with an inverted CD4+/CD8+ ratio, and lung biopsy usually reveals non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. Treatment Prednisone often suppresses symptoms temporarily, especially in the early stages of the disease, and by reducing inflammation it might also delay scarring (fibrosis) in the lungs. However, the only recommended long-term treatment is avoidance of the avian proteins that trigger BFL. Unless fibrosis has progressed beyond recovery, symptoms should improve, sometimes dramatically, in the absence of such allergens. Therefore, it is advisable to remove all birds, bedding and pillows containing feathers from the patient's home, as well as any down- filled outerwear and sleeping bags. At a minimum, it is also advisable to wash all soft furnishings, walls, ceilings and furniture, and to avoid future exposure to birds, bird droppings, or any items containing feathers, such as pillows in many hotels. In extreme cases patients may be advised to evacuate their homes permanently and to get rid of all possessions that have been exposed to avian proteins if they cannot be cleaned thoroughly inside and out. (This includes books, beds, and upholstered furniture.) The patient should not attempt to clean any contaminated items; in fact, anyone who comes in contact with items that have been near birds should change clothes and wash their hair before coming in contact with the patient. Depending on the extent of fibrosis at the time of their diagnosis and how well they follow recommended treatment protocols (especially avoidance of allergens), many BFL patients make a full recovery. However, symptoms may recur quickly upon re-exposure to birds or related allergens.

Geography Kilmory is reached by a branch road off the B8007 road that runs from Salen to Achosnich by way of Kilchoan. All the roads in Ardnamurchan are single track. There is a view north from the junction with the B8007 to the islands of Rùm, Eigg, Muck and Canna. The road descends northwards, crosses the Achateny Water that drains Loch Mudle, passes through Branault and on to Kilmory, Swordle and Ockle. The branch road that enters Kilmory continues to its end at Balnaha Croft. A rough track (access on foot only) leads to very beautiful, wild and unspoilt Kilmory Bay, a sheltered bay with clear water, white sands and black, volcanic rock. It is one of the few sandy beaches on Ardnamurchan. Kilmory is overlooked by Dun Mhurchaidh (). Archaeology Looking north from Kilnory over Eigg and Rhum A prominent feature in Kilmory is the graveyard. This is said to be the site of the original \\"Church of Mary\\", and it is suggested that outlines visible under the grass are part of that structure. Also lying in the grass near the centre of the graveyard is a stone said to be the font stone from the original church. Locally tradition has it that this stone never dries. The graveyard is surrounded by largely circular dry stone wall. There is a Standing Stone in the field behind Branault. (NM526695) Whilst the age and significance of this stone are unknown it aligns, almost perfectly, with Ben Hiant to the SSE (528m, NM537632, the highest point in Western Ardnamurchan) and Sgurr Dearg (986m, NG443215) to the NNW, the high point at the western end of the Skye Cuillin. Demographics Like many other communities in the remote parts of Scotland the population of Kilmory has declined. There are twenty houses in Kilmory/Branault. , a population of thirteen occupies ten of these houses throughout the year. The other ten houses are used as holiday homes. The average age of the population is 68 years, with the youngest being 46 years. Services Looking northwest from Kilmory over the Isle of Muck This decline has been mirrored by a steady decrease in services. In the early part of the 20th century, there was a shop in Branault (Mathieson) and one in Kilmory; up until the 1970s there were weekly visits by two grocery vans(mobile shops)(Burgess from Kilchoan and McColl from Acharacle) as well as the Tuesday butcher's van (Cameron from Acharacle) and the Thursday butcher's van (Connel from Salen). In 2008 British Telecom threatened to withdraw the service from the one telephone box. June 2017, the phone was removed but then, in February 2018, reinstated on appeal. In August 2018, British Telecom still had not re- connected the telephone. It is also reported in 2017 that it is taking over a year to get a telephone \\"landline\\" installed. Mobile phone reception in Kilmory is very poor as is the terrestrial television signal. In 2019 it has become possible to pick up a 4G signal in isolated spots around Kilmory. There are neither mains water nor mains drains in Kilmory. Internet access in Kilmory is difficult, even in 2017. There is no cable service; Kilmory is too far from the exchange to get Broadband through the phone line and the very very patchy mobile signal only offers a very slow GPRS signal, sometimes. A number of houses in Kilmory have installed satellite broadband systems. In 2019 Sunart Telecom, a locally based company, introduced a wireless broadband service. Some households have replaced their satellite services with the wireless broadband. Kilmory school closed in 1962 and the sub post office was closed in 2004. There is a notice board in Kilmory which usually lists the times of the Kilchoan Tobermory ferry. Religion Kilmory supported two churches. Members of the Free Church of Scotland worshipped in a wooden building set amongst trees to the east of the village whilst members of the Church of Scotland worshipped in Kilmory Church which stands to the south of the village; services ceased here in 1989. Development Issues In 2009 and 2010 there has been talk of up to four new houses being built in Kilmory. One of these projects was abandoned as access was too difficult: progress on two others is delayed as there have been problems securing a reliable water supply. The spring from which most of the existing dwellings are provided with water has been deemed to not have sufficient flow to sustain the additional houses.

Its studios are located at the Augusta Corporate Center near the I-20/I-520 interchange in Augusta, and the transmitter tower is in Beech Island, South Carolina. Station history WBBQ-FM signed on in 1958 as the sister to WBBQ AM 1340. The FM simulcasted the AM's programming for much of its existence. Both stations switched to Top 40 under the guidance of Edward H. Dunbar beginning in the early 1960s. WBBQ was very popular with this format and was the #1 station in the Augusta market for over 35 years. In addition, the station had a top-notch news department. Both WBBQ AM and WBBQ FM were owned by George Weiss (under his company, Savannah Valley Broadcasting), who would play an active role in the station's growth. In August 1994, the new station manager Birnie Florie (a former news reporter and salesman) ordered that WBBQ swap formats with newly acquired sister FM WZNY while Weiss was out of the country. WBBQ switched to adult contemporary and WZNY switched to CHR. That move, along with a few other unfavorable decisions, caused Weiss (in 1997) to donate WBBQ and WZNY to the Medical College of Georgia shortly before his passing from cancer. MCG, in turn, sold the stations to Cumulus Broadcasting for $14 million. The money was used to establish the Weiss Endowment for Research for cancer research. Cumulus sold WBBQ in 2000 to Clear Channel Communications (now known as iHeartMedia, Inc.). After spending more than 20 years as an Adult Contemporary-formatted station, WBBQ in recent years has started leaning more Hot AC and Adult CHR in music format. Instituted under previous program director and music director Cliff Bennett, the station started dropping slower songs more commonly found on AC stations and focused more on upbeat, uptempo music with a hard lean towards 2000s and 2010s hit music. The station still avoids hip-hop and most electronic music more commonly found now on Top 40/CHR stations but has positioned itself against variety-formatted, now 80s-formatted WDRR and Top 40/CHR WHHD.

St. Paul Seminary because the new buildings were not ready for occupancy. In December 1966 the campus opened in its current location, beginning with Northview Hall, the Field House, and the Commons. Southview Hall opened in February 1969, and both the Administration Building and an extension to Northview Hall, were added in 1978. The Fine Arts Center, with its 337-seat Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, came in 1987. In 1992, a computer center, and a new entryway to Northview Hall added to buildings on the campus. In celebration of the campus's 30th anniversary, the Student Commons was completely remodeled and Westview Hall was added. Dedicated on September 8, 1996, the $5.7 million project added to the Commons and renovated an existing . Along with expanded space for the student lounge, student activities, student services and study center offices, a dining area and re-located bookstore were added. In 2001, a new gym floor was installed in the Field House, and the building was remodeled and expanded to include three classrooms and a fitness center, adding . To preserve a natural environment for educational use, Gertrude Sherman donated a field station, located approximately west of the main campus, to the university in 1967. The former farm land is being restored to native prairie and woods, and it harbors the UW System's only large wood-fired kiln, and as well as a smaller one. In 2001 a classroom building was constructed on the site. The Gertrude Sherman Building includes one general classroom and one devoted to art. The Wildlife in Need Center moved its headquarters to the field station site in 2011.http://waukesha.uwc.edu/about/overview/history Students, through their segregated fee, support services to students such as day-care reimbursement, and a peer tutoring program, managed by the Academic Success Center.  Campus  UW-Waukesha's land and buildings belong to Waukesha County, which purchased the land from William J. Hughes and his wife, Blanche I. Fischer Hughes, in March 1965. As part of a local-state partnership, the University of Wisconsin provides faculty, staff, educational programs, technology, furnishings, libraries, and supplies. Student profile About 2,000 students attend each fall and spring semester and another 1,000 take summer classes. Many community residents are involved in the campus non-credit classes offered through Continuing Education.  Enrollment for fall 2013 http://waukesha.uwc.edu/about/overview * Headcount: 2,155 credit; FTE 1,569 credit; 2,907 non-credit ** Full-time: 47% ** Part-time: 53% ** Female:47% ** Male: 53% ** Ethnic minority: 9% ** Receiving financial aid: 43%  Curriculum  UW-Waukesha's curriculum covers the three broad areas of humanities, natural and mathematical sciences, and social sciences. The school offers a Bachelor of Arts and Sciences http://waukesha.uwc.edu/academics/majors- degrees/bachelors but many students go on to receive their bachelor's degree at other institutions.http://waukesha.uwc.edu/admissions/transfer  Extracurricular activities  Students can participate in a variety of co- curricular activities ranging from athletics and intramural sports to the student newspaper, The Observer. Student clubs range from drama, ecology, literary to philosophy. In addition, the Student Activities Committee (ACT) plans noon-time entertainment, movie/video nights, fall fest, and spring fling. Student Government (SGA) is the official representative and legislative body for all students.

They were introduced in the course of the 1930s, for fast services on the Florence–Rome railway, being decommissioned in the 1980s. History When in the 1930s, in the course of the Fascist government's program of railways development, a new locomotive was needed to provide a fast service on the newly electrified Milan-Rome mainline at 3,000 V DC. This was also permitted by the introduction of new metallic passenger cars, capable of relative higher speeds. The requirement was shipped to the FS design team of Ing. Giuseppe Bianchi at Florence. The new locomotive was impressive for the times: huge, heavy, powerful and fast. They were longer than the E.626, the first Italian DC electric locomotives, and weighed more. The original requirement asked for the notable service speed of , but this was later reduced to . The E.428 was to be built in conjunction with a lighter version, the E.326, but those proved unsuccessful and were limited to lower speeds. The first wheel arrangement devised was a 2-Do-2, with four trailing axles at the fronts and a single motor driving four central axles. However, the experiences with the E.326 suggested to split the central bogie into two motorized ones. The first locomotive, E.428.001, was released in May 1934. A first series, for a total of 97 units, was produced until 1937. A second order in the same series requested a shorter gear ratio (29/103) and larger air intakes, which caused an increase in weight of four tons. The \\"aerodynamic\\" profile of E.428.226, a third-series locomotive. The second series (81 units) differed in the removal of the frontal bonnets, replaced by a more profiled driving cabin: this set a style which was adopted for all the following Italian locomotives. A third order was issued on April 5, 1939 for 80 locomotives, but the construction was halted by the outbreak of World War II after the completion of 39 units. Some of those locomotives, built by Ansaldo, were theoretically capable of speeds up to 150 km/h. All the E.428s, aside from two, were repaired or rebuilt after World War II. Curiously, the bronze fascist lictorial crests on the front were removed only in 1946. In the 1960s the \\"Fast sub-class\\", with the 34/98 gear ratio, was built back to the shorter 29/103.

Signs and symptoms In addition to the symptoms associated with immunodeficiency, such as depletion of T-cells, decline of lymphocyte activity, and an abrupt proliferation of both benign and opportunistic infections — PNP-deficiency is often characterized by the development of autoimmune disorders. lupus erythematosus, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura have been reported with PNP-deficiency.Neurological symptoms, such as developmental decline, hypotonia, and mental retardation have also been reported. Cause The disorder is caused by a mutation of the purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) gene, located at chromosome 14q13.1. This mutation was first identified by Eloise Giblett, a professor at the University of Washington, in 1975.Motulsky A, Gartler S. \\"Biographical Memoirs: Eloise R. Giblett\\". National Academy of Sciences. PNP is a key enzyme in the purine catabolic pathway, and is required for purine degradation. Specifically, it catalyzes the conversion of inosine to hypoxanthine and guanosine to guanine (both guanine and hypoxanthine will be made into xanthine which will then become uric acid). A deficiency of it leads to buildup of elevated deoxy-GTP (dGTP) levels resulting in T-cell toxicity and deficiency. In contrast to adenosine deaminase deficiency (another deficiency of purine metabolism), there is minimal disruption to B cells. PNP deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome (chromosome 14 is an autosome), and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder. Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on the clinical examination and on laboratory findings showing leukopenia, severe lymphopenia with low CD3, CD4, and CD8 counts and variable B cell function and immunoglobulin levels. Neutropenia has also been reported. Hallmark diagnostic markers of PNP deficiency include hypouricemia, complete or near complete absence of PNP activity in red blood cell lysate and increased urine or blood levels of inosine, guanosine and their deoxy forms. Diagnosis is confirmed by genetic screening of PNP. Differential diagnosis Differential diagnosis includes aplastic anemias, SCID, severe combined immunodeficiency due to adenosine deaminase deficiency, ataxia- telangiectasia, and viral meningoencephalitis. Antenatal screening Measurement of T cell receptor excision circles during newborn screening for SCID can detect some patients suffering from PNP deficiency, although removal of metabolites by maternal PNP may delay the deleterious effects on PNP- deficient lymphocytes. Few newborn screening programs also measure purine metabolites in dried Treatment Supportive treatment, including intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii, and physical, occupational, and speech therapy, reduces the risk of infection and may encourage optimal neurologic development for patients. Epidemiology PNP- deficiency is extremely rare. Only 33 patients with the disorder in the United States have been documented. In the United Kingdom only two children have been diagnosed with this disorder in 1994 and 2008.http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/society/health/boy+first+in+uk+with+rare+condition/3022087 See also * Nezelof syndrome References External links  Category:Noninfectious immunodeficiency-related cutaneous conditions Category:Autosomal recessive disorders Category:Rare diseases Category:Inborn errors of purine-pyrimidine metabolism Category:Combined T and B–cell immunodeficiencies ","title":"Purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency"},{"id":"10890055","text":"North Pagai (Indonesian: Pagai Utara) is one of the Mentawai Islands off the west coast of Sumatra in Indonesia.

The attack however failed in its immediate purpose, as only one barge loaded with fuel was sunk. Due to this attack, however, the Austro-Hungarian Danube Flotilla retreated 130 km West along the Danube, stopping at Belene and subsequently taking extensive defensive measures.Raymond Stănescu, Cristian Crăciunoiu, Marina română în primul război mondial, pp. 73–76 (in Romanian)Michael B. Barrett, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, p. 6 The Romanian monitors and river torpedo boats were active all throughout the Battle of Turtucaia, providing artillery support to the ground troops along with the Romanian shore batteries. The Romanian monitors and shore batteries fired at ranges of 5–8 km, disrupting enemy artillery build-up, movement of troops and firing positions, and ultimately causing significant human and material damage. The Navy was the last to withdraw from the battle and the sector it defended was the last one to be captured by the enemy. The only Romanian warship to have suffered significant damage inflicted by the enemy was the river torpedo boat Grigore Ion, when she was sent to silence a group of 10 enemy machine guns which were blocking the evacuation of Romanian troops. She managed to destroy a few of them before withdrawing, having been struck by thousands of bullets, and having half of her crew killed.Raymond Stănescu, Cristian Crăciunoiu, Marina română în primul război mondial, pp. 82–97 (in Romanian) The Romanian monitors subsequently took part in the First Battle of Cobadin, making an important contribution to achieving the defensive Romanian-Russian victory. As a consequence of this and previous actions at Turtucaia and elsewhere, German General August von Mackensen decided to eliminate the Romanian monitors. He delegated 7 artillery officers, possessing guns with calibers ranging from 150 mm to 305 mm, to attack and destroy the monitors as they were travelling between Rasova and Oltina on 21 September. The German batteries fired with intensity, but by the end of the day, all that was achieved was minor damage to the monitor Lahovari, which also had 6 wounded. When a German aircraft reported that none of the monitors was sunk, Mackensen dismissed all 7 officers.Raymond Stănescu, Cristian Crăciunoiu, Marina română în primul război mondial, pp. 113–117 (in Romanian) During the September–October Flămânda Offensive, the Austro-Hungarian river monitors Bodrog, Körös and Szamos, together with the patrol boat Barsch and one coal barge were damaged by Romanian shore batteries (3 were killed on Barsch) and one large barge loaded with explosives was sunk. Körös was disabled after taking 12 shots, still being in repairs at the time of the armistice on the Romanian front in December 1917; only in April 1918 she became operational once again. No Romanian warships were involved in the operation, but rumors about their arrival caused the Austro-Hungarian warships to flee the scene and return to their base at Belene.Michael B. Barrett, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, p. 143 In early November, Russian- Romanian forces in Dobruja started a general offensive to recapture land lost to the Central Powers during the Second Battle of Cobadin. The Romanian Navy contributed to the offensive, with the monitor Catargiu landing 50 marines to occupy the town of Hârșova on 8 November, after it was abandoned by the retreating enemy. On 10 November, supporting the continuing Allied advance, two Romanian river torpedo boats landed troops at Topalu to occupy the village.Raymond Stănescu, Cristian Crăciunoiu, Marina română în primul război mondial, pp. 161–164 (in Romanian) On 3 December, the Romanian river torpedo boat Căpitan Valter Mărăcineanu was sunk on the Danube by an Austro-Hungarian mine with 1 sailor killed.Robert Gardiner, Conway's All the World Fighting Ships 1906–1921, p. 422Frederick Thomas Jane, Jane's Fighting Ships, p. 485 On 8 December, the Navy joined the ground troops as they started retreating towards the Danube Delta, stopping near Măcin.

In July 1917, the Romanian monitors took part in an intense bombardment of Bulgarian-occupied Tulcea. The bombardment caused significant losses, the monitors fired until all enemy artillery batteries in and around the city were silenced, despite suffering light damage themselves.Raymond Stănescu, Cristian Crăciunoiu, Marina română în primul război mondial, pp. 204–215 (in Romanian) On 22 September, the Romanian Navy achieved one of its greatest success of the war, when the Austro-Hungarian river monitor SMS Inn struck a Romanian mine and sank near Brăila.

Early life  Shmuel Eliyahu was born to Mordechai Eliyahu, the former Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel, and his wife Tzviya. As a boy, he studied at Yeshivat Yerushalayim L'Tzeirim, and later at Mercaz HaRav Kook, where he was a student of Zvi Yehuda Kook. He also served in an Israel Defense Forces combat unit.  Career  Eliyahu received his semikha (ordination as rabbi) at age 23, and at age 29 was appointed to the position of Municipal Rabbi of Shlomi. Three years later, he was appointed the Chief Rabbi of Safed. In July 2013, Eliyahu ran for the position of Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel.Sharon, Jeremy (9 July 2013) \\"Yesh Atid MK Decries Candidacy Of 'Racist' Sephardi Rabbi\\", Jerusalem Post Israeli Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein requested that Eliyahu abandon his candidacy, noting that he had made a number of offensive statements against Arabs.Ettinger, Yair (15 July 2013) \\"AG Urges Rabbi Eliyahu To Drop Candidacy In Light Of Anti-Arab Remarks\\", Haaretz Member of Knesset Issawi Frej submitted an emergency petition to the High Court asking that Eliyahu be disqualified, since \\"election of a racist like Eliyahu to the position would be the start of the destruction of values in the State of Israel\\".Bob, Yonah Jeremy (16 July 2013) \\"MK Files High Court Petition To Disqualify Rabbi Eliyahu From Chief Rabbi Race\\", Jerusalem Post The High Court rejected the petition based on technicalities. In December 2013, Eliyahu petitioned the High Court against the Attorney General for using confidential information that was gathered as part of the failed criminal investigation that Weinstein sent to the election committee in his attempt to prevent Eliyahu from running. Eliyahu has edited many sefarim, including Halakha books written by his father, the Kol Eliyahu siddur, and the Avihem Shel Yisrael series of stories about his father that were revealed after his death.  Views  Shmuel Eliyahu speaking at Yeshivat Mevaser Shalom  Carpet bombing  In May 2007, Eliyahu advocated \\"carpet bombing the general area from which the Kassams were launched, regardless of the price in Palestinian life\\". He further stated, \\"If they don't stop after we kill 100, then we must kill 1,000. If they do not stop after 1,000, then we must kill 10,000. If they still don't stop, we must kill 100,000, even a million. Whatever it takes to make them stop.\\"  State-sanctioned revenge  In March 2008, Eliyahu called for \\"state-sanctioned revenge\\" against Arabs. According to Haaretz, Eliyahu wrote an article for the newsletter Eretz Yisrael Shelanu (\\"Our Land of Israel\\"), wherein he proposed \\"hanging the children of the terrorist who carried out the attack in the Mercaz Harav yeshiva from a tree\\".  Prime Minister  Eliyahu calls for a religious Prime Minister of Israel, saying that earlier prime ministers (presumably referring to Ehud Olmert) had been \\"without faith...without credibility...[and] without values\\".  Propaganda pamphlet  Eliyahu was involved in publishing the conspiracy theory pamphlet On Either Side of the Border, in cooperation with the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America (OU). The OU later asserted that its connection with the pamphlet was unauthorized by senior management.OU Regrets Unauthorized Link with Publication, Orthodox Union, 20 July 2009. The pamphlet, citing the personal account of a recent convert to Judaism who had previously been a member of the Lebanese organisation Hezbollah, asserts that the Pope and the Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church allegedly help organize tours of Auschwitz for Hezbollah members, in order to teach them how to wipe out Jews. The pamphlet was distributed to IDF troops. Danny Orbach, a Harvard-based Israeli historian, said that the pamphlet, supposedly written by a Lebanese, actually contains gross factual errors that no Arab could have made. In addition, there are also numerous other blatant geographical and cultural mistakes in the pamphlet, proving that the author is in reality an ultra- Orthodox Jew from Israel who knows very little about the Arab world. Orbach's conclusion is that Eliyahu took part in a forgery, clearly in order to propagate hatred against Arabs and Muslims.Orbach, Danny (12 May 2011) \\"The Truth of Rabbi Eliyahu\\", Hayanshuf Eliyahu failed to answer the accusations, but his spokesman vouched for the authenticity of the pamphlet in a conversation with Haaretz.Orbach, Danny (14 November 2010) \\"The fairy tales of Safed's chief Rabbi\\", Haaretz Furthermore, Eliyahu had widely quoted from the pamphlet in a subsequent article.  Renting to Arabs  Eliyahu has urged Jewish residents of Safed not to rent housing to Arabs, leading to calls for his suspension, and for his prosecution on grounds of racial incitement.Sherwood, Harriet (7 December 2010) \\"Dozens of Israeli rabbis back call to forbid sale of property to Arabs\\", The GuardianKhoury, Jack (18 November 2010) \\"Safed rabbi to be suspended for 'inciting war between Jews and Arabs'\\", HaaretzWingfield-Hayes, Rupert (30 November 2010) \\"Israeli orthodox rabbi stirs up racism debate\\", BBC News In July 2012, Israel's Ministry of Justice closed the investigation into allegations of incitement, on the grounds of lack of evidence that the statements could be attributed to Eliyahu.  Moving of U. S. embassy  Following an address in December 2017 in which U.S. President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and announced plans to relocate the U.S. embassy there from its current location in Tel Aviv, Eliyahu organized a joint letter signed by 250 Israeli Orthodox rabbis praising Trump's historic proclamation, stating, \\"You will be remembered in the history of the Jewish people.\\"  References  Category:1956 births Category:Rabbis in Safed Category:Israeli Orthodox Jews Category:Israeli Orthodox rabbis Category:Religious Zionist Orthodox rabbis Category:Mercaz HaRav alumni Category:Chief rabbis of cities in Israel Category:Israeli people of Iraqi-Jewish descent Category:Living people Category:Anti-Arabism ","title":"Shmuel Eliyahu"},{"id":"10890191","text":"Delhi Junction, also known as Old Delhi Railway Station (station code: DLI), is the oldest railway station of Delhi city and a Junction station. It is one of the busiest railway stations in India in terms of frequency. Around 250 trains start, end, or pass through the station daily. It was established near Chandni Chowk in 1864 when trains from Howrah, Calcutta started operating up to Delhi. Its present building was constructed by the British Indian government in the style of the nearby Red Fort and opened in 1903. It has been an important railway station of the country and preceded the New Delhi Railway Station by about 60 years. Chandni Chowk station of the Delhi Metro is located near it. History The station started with a broad gauge train from Calcutta in 1864. Metre gauge track from Delhi to Rewari and further to Ajmer was laid in 1873 by Rajputana State Railway and metre gauge trains from this station started in 1876. The present building of the station was built in 1900 and opened for the public in 1903. Started with just 2 platforms and 1000 passengers, Delhi Railway Station now handles more than 180,000 passengers and around 190 trains starts, ends, or passes through the station daily. In 1904 the Agra-Delhi line was opened. Delhi then was a part of six railway systems. East Indian Railway, North-Western Railway, and Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway entered from Ghaziabad crossing the Yamuna river. Delhi - Panipat - Ambala Cantonment - Kalka Railway ran northwards from Delhi, and the Rajputana-Malwa Railway traversed the Delhi district for a short distance in the direction of Gurgaon and Rewari Junction. Old Delhi Junction Delhi railway station Delhi Railway Station was built in red stone to give the effect of nearby historic Red Fort. The station building had six clock towers and tower 4 is still in use as a water tank. This station served as the main station of Delhi, hosting junction of four railways until the opening of New Delhi Railway Station in 1926 ahead of the inauguration of the New Delhi city in 1931. Agra-Delhi railway track cut through the site earmarked for the hexagonal War Memorial (now called India Gate) and Kingsway (now called Rajpath). East Indian Railway Company shifted the line along the Yamuna river and opened the new track in 1924. The station was remodelled in 1934–35, when its platforms were extended and power signals were introduced. A new entrance from Kashmere Gate side was created in 1990s and new platforms were added. The platforms were renumbered in September 2011. The numbers that started from Kashmere Gate entrance as 1A and ended at 18 near the main entrance were renumbered starting as 1 from the main entrance and ending at 16 at Kashmere Gate entrance and some platforms were merged to form long platforms to accommodate trains of 24 coaches.http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/confusion-after-old-delhi- railway-station-reverses-order-of-platforms/842151/ The station building is being renovated in 2012–13. Delhi earlier handled both broad and meter gauge trains. Since 1994, it is a purely broad gauge station, meter gauge traffic having been shifted to Delhi Sarai Rohilla Station. In 2016, Vivaan Solar, a Gwalior based company won the contract to install 2.2 MW of rooftop solar project at the railway station in late 2016. The solar power project to be set up under Public Private Partnership will be executed on design, build, finance, operate and transfer (DBFOT) basis.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places both individually and as a contributing property in the Dallas Downtown Historic District and is a Dallas Landmark as part of the Harwood Street Historic District. It is also located across the street from Main Street Garden Park. History In 1902, Edward Titche formed a partnership with Max Goettinger and the two established Titche–Goettinger, a department store, on the southeast corner of Elm and Murphy Streets in downtown Dallas.Dallas Public Library - listing for the Titche–Goettinger Building. Retrieved on 25 April 2007. By 1904, operations had outgrown the Elm/Murphy location and the store moved to the year-old Wilson Building.Dallas Public Library - listing for the Wilson Building. Retrieved on 25 April 2007. By 1928, the store had again outgrown itself and construction began on a new building two blocks east in an area known as \\"Uptown\\". Located along St. Paul between Elm and Main, the new flagship building designed by architect George Dahl opened in November 1929 as one of the largest department stores in the Southwest. It consisted of seven floors plus basement and sub-basement. The exterior was clad in Indiana Limestone with Italian Florentine detail in Renaissance Revival style, while the inside featured Art Deco design elements. The interior of the building was set up like current department stores of its day.Ferry, John William. A History of the Department Store, p.14 The basement was used as a retail space featuring \\"popularly priced\\" merchandise. The first floor sold impulse goods such as gloves, hats, purses and hosiery. It featured a patterned terrazzo floor and eighteen foot ornamental ceiling. Columns had ornamental capitals with Texas-motifs. The second floor sold women's and misses' clothes as well as furs and featured differently themed \\"galleries\\".Dallas Times Herald, Nov. 24, 1929 Children's clothes and lingerie were located on the third floor, originally decorated with peach and apricot colors. House wares such as rugs, draperies, and furniture were on the fourth floor. The fifth floor featured glass ware and china, and the employee restrooms and hospital. The offices were on the sixth floor. On the seventh floor was a 600-seat auditorium that could also be converted into four small conference spaces. A basement and sub-basement held the mechanical equipment as well as a state-of-the-art refrigerated fur vault that could hold up to 3,000 fur coats. The cooling system cooled the basement and first floor. Expansion In 1955 the building doubled in size with the opening of a \\"Texas-size\\" major addition along Main between St Paul and Harwood designed by Thomas, Jameson & Merrill. This addition matched the original building in height, depth and building materials, although the façade was windowless and featured a large cartouche and prominent signage. The addition also boasted the first complete escalator service for a building of its size in the Southwest and the largest plate glass windows at street level. The expanded department store boasted three restaurants, a bakery and a 1,600-seat public auditorium. In the 1960s and '70s the chain was more well known as Titche's. The store took on the Joske's name in 1979. In 1985 Allied Stores consolidated Joske's three Texas divisions, and the top three floors of the building were converted to corporate offices. The store connected its retail concourse to the expanding Dallas Pedestrian Network during a renovation of the basement, first and second floors in 1986.Donna Steph Hansard. (1986, August 21).

The UCD was the first multi-institutional teaching center (MITC) for higher education in Texas and was established by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board to provide access to public higher education at the upper division and graduate levels to citizens who live and work in downtown Dallas. Four of the seven floors have been converted to classroom space and are used by Texas A&M; University- Commerce, Texas Woman's University (TWU), University of North Texas (UNT), University of Texas at Arlington (UTA), Dallas County Community College District (DCCCD) and 9th-12th grade of the Pegasus School of Liberal Arts & Sciences. The facility also contains Fashion on Main, the exhibition facility of UNT's Texas Fashion Collection. Future plans include expansion of the fashion gallery. The current address for this portion of the building is 1901 Main. The building was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1996. As one of the first residential renovations in downtown Dallas, Oglesby-Green adapted the original 1929 building into 129 loft-style apartments and retail space in 1997. To provide adequate light to interior apartments a section of the building on floors 2-8 was cut away, but the façade was left intact (this is evident when viewing the rows of open windows along Main). The eighth floor of apartments is the old \\"attic\\" space facing the interior courtyard and is only accessible via stairs from the seventh floor. Resident parking is accommodated in the basement and sub-basement levels. Many of the original finishes were incorporated into the renovation where practical, making each unit unique in design (units feature original windows and decorative columns, and one unit incorporates the old ballroom's stage). The lobby features many historical photographs and artifacts of the building's past. For several years in the late 1990s a portion of the lobby contained the Gold Bar and restaurant Champagne;Dallas Morning News, October 31, 1997 vestiges still remain of old bar and department store features throughout the building. The current address for this portion of the building is 1900 Elm. UNT purchased the Universities Center at 1901 Main with plans to expand program offerings. Because the building shares parking and other critical services with 1900 Elm, UNT also purchased the apartment building and offers a reduced rate to full-time students, thus reunifying the historic building under one ownership. On May 14, 2009 the Texas Legislature approved UNT's request for a public law school in the neighboring Dallas Municipal Building. The Universities Center will be home of the new law school until the renovated building is ready for occupancy. Design details The 96,000 pound cartouche is a prominent feature of the 1955 addition. *The prominent cartouch on the 1955 addition became a symbol of the Titche–Goettinger company and can be found in other areas of the building. It is made of solid Indiana limestone and stands 28 feet high by 26 feet across, covering part of the building's fifth, sixth and seventh floors. The design was created by the architectural firm of Thomas Jameson and Merrill. The center portion is topped by a star signifying the Lone Star State and Titche's place in it. On each side of the star are live oak leaves mixed in with cactus blossoms. Below the star on the left is a scale indicating full measure and value. On the right, a ship indicating the world of commerce. Nine cotton bolls are indicative of Texas farm life and the textile industry, and on the right are the initials of the store. The six national flags of Texas are shown, representing the United States, Confederacy, France, (on the left) Texas, Mexico and Spain (on the right). *Above the entrance doors are relief sculptures of important Dallas leaders and businessmen. *The 1929 building was once lit by a series of multi- colored lights. These light sconces can still be seen along the building façade but are not in use today. *On either side of the entry doors are medallions representing Texas commerce. At the St. Paul (west) entrance are designs of cotton and wheat, representing the two main agricultural crops of the state. At the Elm Street (north) entrance, timber and manufacturing are featured and at the Main Street (south) entrance cattle and oil are shown.

During the recognition of innominate contracts, and their enforcement via the actio praescriptis verbis, the condictio causa data causa non secuta still had relevance, however, outside the field of valid contracts. This can be explained by reference to the purpose which failed (the basis of the action): where pacta sunt servanda, the purpose is successful on discharge of the legal duties which flow from the contract, namely transfer of the object of the contract. The condictio causa data causa non secuta still exists in German Law and is represented in § 812 I 2 2. Alt BGB. Its modern short form is called \\"condictio ob rem\\". It has been used in several cases of post-socialist economies of Eastern Europe where the state was selling state owned property to nouveaux riches with an explicit request for the property (usually factories, but also land and other) to be brought for a specific purpose. As such requests were as a rule not fulfilled, in some (but by far not all) cases the public pressure has forced the governments to act upon the initial contract and claim back the property, paying the buyer who had failed to carry out his or her part of the agreement partial (or rarely full) restitution for his or her payment according to the first contract. Such cases were usually related to issues of bribery and embezzlement by state officials in the instances of signing the initial contracts of sale. Scots law also still recognises the action of condictio causa data causa non secuta among the other condictiones, as was shown in the landmark case, in the field of unjustified enrichment (restitution), of Shilliday v Smith (especially per Lord President Rodger).

EDGE combines many individual instructions into a larger group known as a \\"hyperblock\\". Hyperblocks are designed to be able to easily run in parallel. Parallelism of modern CPU designs generally starts to plateau at about eight internal units and from one to four \\"cores\\", EDGE designs intend to support hundreds of internal units and offer processing speeds hundreds of times greater than existing designs. Major development of the EDGE concept had been led by the University of Texas at Austin under DARPA's Polymorphous Computing Architectures program, with the stated goal of producing a single-chip CPU design with 1 TFLOPS performance by 2012, which has yet to be realized as of 2018.University of Texas at Austin, \\"TRIPS : One Trillion Calculations per Second by 2012\\" Traditional designs Almost all computer programs consist of a series of instructions that convert data from one form to another. Most instructions require several internal steps to complete an operation. Over time, the relative performance and cost of the different steps have changed dramatically, resulting in several major shifts in ISA design. CISC to RISC In the 1960s memory was relatively expensive, and CPU designers produced instruction sets that densely encoded instructions and data in order to better utilize this resource. For instance, the \`add A to B to produce C\` instruction would be provided in many different forms that would gather A and B from different places; main memory, indexes, or registers. Providing these different instructions allowed the programmer to select the instruction that took up the least possible room in memory, reducing the program's needs and leaving more room for data. An instruction set that tried to provide every possible access mode for every possible instruction (like the DEC VAX) was known as orthogonal, then considered the paragon of design. This style of memory access with wide variety of modes led to instruction sets with hundreds of different instructions, a style known today as CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing). By the late 1970s memory had become cheap, but at the cost of lower performance; CPU designs now ran many times faster than the memory they talked to. Under this new regime orthogonality became undesirable. Each of these versions of the instructions took up room on the CPU, but did little or nothing to improve performance because they communicated with the slow memory, while at the same time the memory savings were now unnecessary. During this period the RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) design philosophy flourished. The basic aim was to reduce access to memory as much as possible, using internal high-performance registers for most instructions. As a side-effect, the wide variety of different modes for instructions disappeared; there might be only one \`ADD\` instruction instead of many. Removing these instructions reduced the complexity of the instruction decoder and freed up considerable space on the CPU, space that was used to greatly increase the number of registers. Internal parallelism In the 1990s the chip design and fabrication process grew to the point where it was possible to build a commodity processor with every potential feature built into it. To improve performance, CPU designs started adding internal parallelism, becoming \\"superscalar\\". In any program there are instructions that work on unrelated data, so by adding more functional units these instructions can be run at the same time. A new portion of the CPU, the scheduler, looks for these independent instructions and feeds them into the units, taking their outputs and re-ordering them so externally it appears they ran in succession. The amount of parallelism that can be extracted in superscalar designs is limited by the number of instructions that the scheduler can examine for interdependencies. Examining a greater number of instructions can improve the chance of finding an instruction that can be run in parallel, but only at the cost of increasing the complexity of the scheduler itself. Despite massive efforts, CPU designs using classic RISC or CISC ISA's have plateaued at about three or four functional units . Additional performance can be wrung from systems by examining the instructions to find ones that operate on different types of data and adding units dedicated to that sort of data; this has led to the introduction of floating point units and, more recently, single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) units. The drawback to this approach is that it makes the CPU less generic; feeding the CPU with a program that uses almost all floating point instructions, for instance, will bog the FPUs while the other units sit idle. A more recent problem in modern CPU designs is the delay talking to the registers. In general terms the size of the CPU die has remained largely the same over time, while the size of the units within the CPU has grown much smaller as more and more units were added. That means that the relative distance between any one function unit and the global register file has grown over time. Once introduced in order to avoid delays in talking to main memory, the global register file has itself become a delay that is worth avoiding. A new ISA? Just as the delays talking to memory while its price fell suggested a radical change in ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) from CISC to RISC, designers are considering whether the problems scaling in parallelism and the increasing delays talking to registers demands another switch in basic ISA. Among the ways to introduce a new ISA are the very long instruction word (VLIW) architectures, typified by the Itanium. VLIW moves the scheduler logic out of the CPU and into the compiler, where it has much more memory and longer timelines to examine the instruction stream. This static placement, static issue execution model works well when all delays are known, but in the presence of cache latencies, filling instruction words has proven to be a difficult challenge for the compiler.W. Havanki, S. Banerjia, and T. Conte. \\"Treegion scheduling for wide-issue processors\\", in Proceedings of the Fourth International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architectures, January 1998, pg. 266–276 An instruction that might take five cycles if the data is in the cache could take hundreds if it is not, but the compiler has no way to know whether that data will be in the cache at runtime that's determined by overall system load and other factors that have nothing to do with the program being compiled. The key performance bottleneck in traditional designs is that the data and the instructions that operate on them are theoretically scattered about memory. Memory performance dominates overall performance, and classic dynamic placement, dynamic issue designs seem to have reached the limit of their performance capabilities. VLIW uses a static placement, static issue model, but has proven difficult to master because the runtime behavior of programs is difficult to predict and properly schedule in advance. EDGE=Theory EDGE architectures are a new class of ISA's based on a static placement, dynamic issue design. EDGE systems compile source code into a form consisting of statically-allocated hyperblocks containing many individual instructions, hundreds or thousands. These hyperblocks are then scheduled dynamically by the CPU. EDGE thus combines the advantages of the VLIW concept of looking for independent data at compile time, with the superscalar RISC concept of executing the instructions when the data for them becomes available. In the vast majority of real-world programs, the linkage of data and instructions is both obvious and explicit. Programs are divided into small blocks referred to as subroutines, procedures or methods (depending on the era and the programming language being used) which generally have well-defined entrance and exit points where data is passed in or out. This information is lost as the high level language is converted into the processor's much simpler ISA. But this information is so useful that modern compilers have generalized the concept as the \\"basic block\\", attempting to identify them within programs while they optimize memory access through the registers. A block of instructions does not have control statements but can have predicated instructions. The dataflow graph is encoded using these blocks, by specifying the flow of data from one block of instructions to another, or to some storage area. The basic idea of EDGE is to directly support and operate on these blocks at the ISA level. Since basic blocks access memory in well-defined ways, the processor can load up related blocks and schedule them so that the output of one block feeds directly into the one that will consume its data. This eliminates the need for a global register file, and simplifies the compiler's task in scheduling access to the registers by the program as a whole instead, each basic block is given its own local registers and the compiler optimizes access within the block, a much simpler task. EDGE systems bear a strong resemblance to dataflow languages from the 1960s–1970s, and again in the 1990s. Dataflow computers execute programs according to the \\"dataflow firing rule\\", which stipulates that an instruction may execute at any time after its operands are available. Due to the isolation of data, similar to EDGE, dataflow languages are inherently parallel, and interest in them followed the more general interest in massive parallelism as a solution to general computing problems. Studies based on existing CPU technology at the time demonstrated that it would be difficult for a dataflow machine to keep enough data near the CPU to be widely parallel, and it is precisely this bottleneck that modern fabrication techniques can solve by placing hundreds of CPU's and their memory on a single die. Another reason that dataflow systems never became popular is that compilers of the era found it difficult to work with common imperative languages like C++. Instead, most dataflow systems used dedicated languages like Prograph, which limited their commercial interest. A decade of compiler research has eliminated many of these problems, and a key difference between dataflow and EDGE approaches is that EDGE designs intend to work with commonly used languages. CPUs An EDGE-based CPU would consist of one or more small block engines with their own local registers; realistic designs might have hundreds of these units. The units are interconnected to each other using dedicated inter-block communication links. Due to the information encoded into the block by the compiler, the scheduler can examine an entire block to see if its inputs are available and send it into an engine for execution there is no need to examine the individual instructions within. With a small increase in complexity, the scheduler can examine multiple blocks to see if the outputs of one are fed in as the inputs of another, and place these blocks on units that reduce their inter-unit communications delays. If a modern CPU examines a thousand instructions for potential parallelism, the same complexity in EDGE allows it to examine a thousand hyperblocks, each one consisting of hundreds of instructions. This gives the scheduler considerably better scope for no additional cost. It is this pattern of operation that gives the concept its name; the \\"graph\\" is the string of blocks connected by the data flowing between them. Another advantage of the EDGE concept is that it is massively scalable. A low-end design could consist of a single block engine with a stub scheduler that simply sends in blocks as they are called by the program. An EDGE processor intended for desktop use would instead include hundreds of block engines. Critically, all that changes between these designs is the physical layout of the chip and private information that is known only by the scheduler; a program written for the single-unit machine would run without any changes on the desktop version, albeit thousands of times faster. Power scaling is likewise dramatically improved and simplified; block engines can be turned on or off as required with a linear effect on power consumption. Perhaps the greatest advantage to the EDGE concept is that it is suitable for running any sort of data load. Unlike modern CPU designs where different portions of the CPU are dedicated to different sorts of data, an EDGE CPU would normally consist of a single type of ALU-like unit. A desktop user running several different programs at the same time would get just as much parallelism as a scientific user feeding in a single program using floating point only; in both cases the scheduler would simply load every block it could into the units. At a low level the performance of the individual block engines would not match that of a dedicated FPU, for instance, but it would attempt to overwhelm any such advantage through massive parallelism. Implementations=TRIPS The University of Texas at Austin was developing an EDGE ISA known as TRIPS. In order to simplify the microarchitecture of a CPU designed to run it, the TRIPS ISA imposes several well-defined constraints on each TRIPS hyperblock, they: * have at most 128 instructions, * issue at most 32 loads and/or stores, * issue at most 32 register bank reads and/or writes, * have one branch decision, used to indicate the end of a block. The TRIPS compiler statically bundles instructions into hyperblocks, but also statically compiles these blocks to run on particular ALUs. This means that TRIPS programs have some dependency on the precise implementation they are compiled for. In 2003 they produced a sample TRIPS prototype with sixteen block engines in a 4 by 4 grid, along with a megabyte of local cache and transfer memory. A single chip version of TRIPS, fabbed by IBM in Canada using a 130 nm process, contains two such \\"grid engines\\" along with shared level-2 cache and various support systems. Four such chips and a gigabyte of RAM are placed together on a daughter-card for experimentation. The TRIPS team had set an ultimate goal of producing a single-chip implementation capable of running at a sustained performance of 1 TFLOPS, about 50 times the performance of high-end commodity CPUs available in 2008 (the dual-core Xeon 5160 provides about 17 GFLOPS). CASH CMU's CASH is a compiler that produces an intermediate code called \\"Pegasus\\".\\"Phoenix Project\\" CASH and TRIPS are very similar in concept, but CASH is not targeted to produce output for a specific architecture, and therefore has no hard limits on the block layout. WaveScalar The University of Washington's WaveScalar architecture is substantially similar to EDGE, but does not statically place instructions within its \\"waves\\". Instead, special instructions (phi, and rho) mark the boundaries of the waves and allow scheduling.\\"The WaveScalar ISA\\" References=NotesBibliography * University of Texas at Austin, \\"TRIPS Technical Overview\\" * A.

It is a young adult historical fiction novel about a twelve-year-old Kurdish girl and her family's escape from Iraq over the border into Iran. The book was originally published in Great Britain by William Heinemann Ltd. in 1991. It was first published in the US by Dutton Children's Books, a division of Penguin Books USA Inc. in 1992. Plot summary  When Tara Hawrami is returning from school one day, she witnesses Iranian troops shoot a mullah and an innocent boy reading a newspaper in broad daylight, it sight changes her thinking forever. However, when she returns home she is stunned when her mother, Teriska Khan shows a very muted reaction; Teriska Khan reveals that she and Tara's father have been concealing the horrors of the ongoing war between Iraq and Iran from Tara, including shootings like the one Tara had witnessed. That night, an injured intruder enters Tara's house, who turns out to be her Uncle Rostam, a Pesh Murga resistance fighter. The following morning, Tara's father, Kak Soran, suddenly returns with Tara's brother, Ashti, and her grandmother from Baghdad. Tara's life changes quickly and drastically from that moment on. When Rostam and Ashti leave to join the resistance fighters, the pesh mergas, Kak Soran is soon forced to go into hiding as well when the authorities suspect he has been indirectly supporting the pesh murgas. Tara's apprehension only grows when the rest of her family must escape into a village in the mountains soon afterward. Life in the mountains is peaceful, but boring for Tara until the area ends up being bombed repeatedly, injuring Tara. When Ashti arrives in the village after being injured, Kak Soran and Teriska Khan plan a risky escape to Iran through the mountains all the way to Iran where they wind up in a refugee camp for several months. Ashti, fearing conscription into the Iranian army, runs back to Iraq while Teriska Khan becomes very ill and sad as her son does not return for many months. Gradually Teriska Khan does recover after Tara finds a friendly neighbour willing to help. Tara has to care of her mother and younger sister Hero, until Teriska Khan recovers. Kak Soran's connections eventually come through and Tara's family manages to find help in the form of Kak Soran's cousin. However, with no available jobs in Iran, the family realizes that they must escape the country to become refugees in another country. Using the last of their savings, the family manages to arrive in London, where they apply for refugee status. In London, Kak Soran manages to get in contact with a family friend (Latif), who offers them a place to stay. In every place that Tara has been displaced to, she has experienced culture shock and needed to adjust quickly; At first the family has a hard time getting used to the new language and the new lifestyle. Tara's English gradually improves and despite the traumatic experiences she has endured, she manages to make some friends at her new school. Her family is overjoyed they hear that Ashti will soon arrive in London after several years apart. Though their new life is difficult and less comfortable than their old home in Iraq, Tara learns not to take anything for granted. The family gets back together and begins to live a better, new life. History The story is based on a Kurdish family living in Sulaymaniyah, a city in northeastern Iraq in 1984 during a time of war.  Characters  * Tara Hawrami - A 13-year-old Kurdish girl living in Iraq with her family. She is unaware of the conflict in her country, desiring the ordinary life she has always lived in the town of Sulamaniya. However, as the war begins to affect her directly, she becomes increasingly aware of her circumstances and begins to take more responsibilities in caring for her mother and younger sister. Through her experiences as an exile and a refugee, Tara matures and demonstrates courage. *Kak Soran - Tara's father, a businessman who works hard to support his family. He secretly works as an informant to the pesh murgas, which forces him to flee into the mountains when he is discovered. Though he is kind and generous, he is very strict and proud and wants to protect his family. *Teriska Khan - Tara, Hero, and Ashti's mother and Kak Soran's wife. A kindhearted and protective woman, she is decisive and strong-willed, though apprehensive about risky decisions concerning her family. Her sudden illness is a blow to the family, who has always seen Teriska Khan as a pillar of strength. *Ashti - Tara and Hero's older brother, approximately 18 years old. Because of his youth, he is eager to join Rostam and the pesh murgas, though he later reveals that working with Rostam is extremely demanding. However, he is courageous and determined. *Hero - Tara's younger sister, around four years old. She is playful and difficult to control, which proves to be dangerous to the family at times. She adapts quickly to most situations, but is largely unaware of the circumstances behind them. *Uncle Rostam - Kak Soran's brother, a pesh murga. He is renowned as a charismatic leader, though Teriska Khan fears he is too reckless, particularly when Ashti joins him. As a leader, Ashti reveals Rostam is controlling and demanding. *Granny - Tara's grandmother, an outspoken woman who advises Teriska Khan to leave for the mountains. *Leila - Tara's best friend and neighbour, an Arab girl, though they are rarely divided by their differences. Her family opposes the violent acts against Kurdish people done by the Iraqi government and Leila's mother, Mrs. Amina, later aids Tara's family in escaping to the mountains. Appears in many of Tara's wishes. *Baji Rezan - A woman who gossips with other girls, which annoys Tara when she arrives in the mountains. She ends up saving Tara's life during a bombing, after which Tara learns to appreciate and respect her. *Ghazal -Baji Rezan's daughter-in-law and a distant cousin of Tara's who lives in the mountains. She has a young baby. *Latif - A friend of Dabans, Kak Soran's cousin, who offers to let Tara's family stay at his flat when they arrive in London.  Themes  Kiss the Dust focuses on a number of themes, including family, courage, loyalty, and coming-of-age. Through her struggles, Tara is strengthened through her sense of family and matures through caring for her mother during her illness and watching over her younger sister. Though her family is unable to remain together despite their efforts, they are driven to find a safe place regardless of how far they must go in order to be reunited some day. The family remains loyal to themselves and trusting of others to help them through the hardships of war and the uncertainty of being refugees in foreign countries. Tara endures her constant displacement with courage and increasing maturity as she takes on more responsibilities and takes initiative in protect her family.

He was a medieval Anglo-Norman baron and a major figure in the Norman Invasion of Ireland.Cokayne 1890 Wars in Wales and Ireland Llanstephan Castle A Welsh Marcher Lord, Lord Llanstephan fought, along with his older brother William, and half-brother Robert FitzStephen, constable of Cardigan, under Robert FitzMartin at the Battle of Crug Mawr in Wales in 1136. Llansteffan Castle overlooks the River Tywi estuary where it enters Carmarthen Bay. It was captured by Maredudd ap Gruffydd in 1146 against the forces of Maurice FitzGerald and his brother William, Lord of Emlyn who were the leading Norman settlers of the region. The castle was retaken by the Normans in 1158. Diarmait Mac Murchada (Dermot MacMurrough), the deposed King of Leinster who had been exiled by the High King of Ireland, sought Cambro-Norman assistance to regain his throne. Lord Llanstephan participated in the resulting 1169 Norman invasion of Ireland. He assisted his younger half-brother Robert Fitz-Stephen in the Siege of Wexford (1169). His nephew Raymond was Strongbow's second-in-command and had the chief share both in the capture of Waterford and in the successful assault on Dublin in 1171. Lord Lanstephan and his son's the Fitzmaurices also fought in this battle. Marriage and issue Maurice FitzGerald (Lord Llanstephan) is rumoured(known) to have married Alice, a daughter of Arnulf de Montgomery.Weis, Frederick Lewis. Ancestral Roots of Certain American Colonists Who Came to America before 1700. Eighth ed. (2008), p. 169. Line 178-3. But there is no actual evidence that she could exist. It has been asserted by eminent authorities that Arnulf left, by his wife, Lafracoth, a daughter, Alice, and that she was later the wife of Maurice FitzGerald, son of Gerald of Windsor. By Maurice, one of the first conquerors of Ireland, who died in 1176, she was the mother of Gerald (died 1205), who laid the fortunes of the FitzGeralds of Kildare. (Even Curtis - referenced below - says he can't find a source for Alice and, on the whole, she seems a)unlikely to have existed and b)impossible for Maurice to have met.) Alice herself was living in 1171, and was then in Ireland with her husband and sons.Curtis, E. “Murchertach O'Brien, High King of Ireland, and His Norman Son-in-Law, Arnulf De Montgomery, circa 1100.” The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, vol. 11, no. 2, (1921), pp. 123-124. Maurice FitzGerald, by his wife Alice, had the following children: :* Thomas FitzMaurice, Lord O'Connello (d. c.1213) :* Gerald FitzMaurice, 1st Lord of Offaly (b. c. 1150, d. before 15 Jan 1204) :* Alexander Fitzmaurice :* William Fitzmaurice, Lord of Naas (d. c.1199) :* Maurice Fitzmaurice, Lord of Kiltrany :* Robert Fitzmaurice :* Nest FitzMaurice (m. Hervey de Montmorenci, Constable of England) Lord Llanstephan's second eldest son, Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice (the 1st Lord of Offaly) was the progenitor of the FitzGerald Earls of Kildare and Dukes of Leinster. The original Earldom of Desmond in the province of Munster was based on landholdings belonging to the descendants of Maurice's eldest son Thomas FitzMaurice, Lord OConnello. Thomas's son John FitzMaurice FitzThomas, who was killed in the Battle of Callann, became the first Baron Desmond. Others from this line include the Knights of Glin and Knights of Kerry. Ancestry Maurice FitzGerald was the second son of Gerald FitzWalter known as Gerald de Windsor, Constable of Pembroke Castle by his wife, Nest ferch Rhys, Princess of Deheubarth and a member of the Welsh royal House of Dinefwr.

Synopsis The story is about Mario (Ng), who is an office loafer who specializes in praising and pleasing his boss, the good-for-nothing eldest son of a business tycoon. Mario considers Harper (Wu) his apprentice, and together the two go about town picking up women. Mario has a theory that links the characteristics of a woman's breasts to her character. Without knowing that Yuki (Reis) is going to be his new colleague, he predicts her to be of his type from the shape of her breasts while she is standing outside a glass window of a restaurant. Despite his deserving reputation of being a womanizer, Mario is really kind at heart, but he is soon lured into a bet with his boss and has to get Yuki into bed to win it. He comes up with the brilliant plan of telling her that he has a malignant brain tumor in its terminal stage. Thanks to his acting skill, she totally buys his story. Using his smooth tongue, Mario soon turns Yuki's sympathy into love. But it is not long before Yuki brings him home and her father, who is a Chinese traditional medicine doctor, diagnose his lie. Quietly Yuki and her female colleagues strike back with a vengeance. She fools Mario and his sidekick, Harper, into taking an excessively large dose of a highly potent breast-enlarging tonic her father had concocted. Soon the two men are endowed with cup sizes many women would envy, but would freak men out.

The school takes children from the age of 11 through to the age of 18. The school has approximately 2,200 pupils. In September 2001 the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) designated the school as a specialist Sports College. Jon Ryder has been head of the school since September 2019 after taking over from David Wybron. In 2006, together with Thame leisure centre, the school opened a new astro-turf pitch. The official opening featured a team decathlon by the students, after which the ribbon was cut by the women's England hockey captain. The mayor of Thame was also present on the day. History Source: The school opened in 1570, having been founded at the bequest of John Williams, 1st Baron Williams of Thame, after his death in 1559. A building with a single classroom, two rooms for the Master and Usher, and a dormitory for boarders was erected in 1569 close to St Mary's Church and adjacent to the almshouses (all can still be seen today). In 1575, the Statutes were published which not only laid out how the school should be run but established the connection with New College, Oxford that lasts to this day. It was an Endowed grammar school supported by income from John Williams's bequests (an endowment) and fees paid by scholars. The first headmaster was Edward Harris, born in 1534 and a native of Thame. A note on one copy of the Statutes states: \\"On the Day before the feast of St Andrews [November 29] 1570, Edward Harris who had previously been elected master, took up his office of teaching in the newly completed school.\\" Across the seventeenth and eighteenth century, it had a history of educating scholars who went on to have significant national influence (as listed below). However, by the middle of the 19 century, its fortunes had declined and, in 1872, it was decided to temporarily close the school and make a fresh start on a site on the Oxford Road, Thame. The new buildings opened in 1879. Records show that by 1890 the school had 57 boarders and 7 day boys; over the next thirty years, the number of day boys increased and, by 1920, there were 61 boarders and 52 day boys on the roll. From 1895, the school started to receive grants from the local educational authority to supplement its income and the school began to lose its independence. In the 1930s almost all the school's income was coming from the local authority. By the mid 1940s it became clear that the school could no longer remain independent. In 1947 it became a state school under the direction of the Oxfordshire Education Committee. The roll increased rapidly and reached bursting point in 1960 when it stood at 200 and the school had to turn away pupils. The Education Committee announced that it would institute a building programme and double the school's size. The Committee also accepted the Governor’s recommendation that to preserve the essential characteristic of the school, the size of the Boarding House be increased to 90. In late 1963, these new buildings were opened and the roll increased again. In 1966, the Education Committee privately announced that it was planning to turn Lord Williams's Grammar School into a single-sex comprehensive to be called Lord Williams's School and that a separate girls' comprehensive school would be built alongside the existing buildings. However these plans were amended and in 1971 it became a co-educational comprehensive school when it merged with the Wenman School. The site of which became one part of the lower school, known as Lower School East, while Lower School West was established on the Oxford Road site alongside what was known as the Upper School. In 1995 Lower school west merged into another part of Upper school and lower school east became the one site for years 7-9. Currently, the school is still dual-site and the long awaited plans to have a single site on the Oxford Road have yet to be reached. Boarding Boys boarded at the school for over 400 years. When the new school opened in 1879 they boarded at Main House on the site of the current school. As their numbers increased in the 1960s, the older boys also used two residential houses close to the school – Greenacres and Highfield. In 1992, the boarding facility was closed and since then the school has admitted day students only.

The emergency services received a 999 call at 9.42pm although it is currently believed the fire had started at 8.30pm. 65 fire fighters from across the county were able to control the blaze and stop it from destroying a neighbouring building with fire fighters from Thame, Wheatley, Watlington and Slade Park, as well as teams from Buckinghamshire Fire & Rescue coming from Aylesbury, Brill, Princes Risborough and Waddesdon attending the blaze.  Causes  Originally it was believed that arson was the cause but an electrical fire was not ruled out. However, in February 2008, a 23-year-old man called Craig Fordhttp://www.thame.net/archives/3878 was found guilty of arson and sentenced to five years in prison. The Phoenix Project In early 2008, a project began to raise up to £1m in order to replace the drama studio with a new, state-of-the-art, drama and dance studio, including a box office and permanent seating for the popular Thame Youth Theatre, based at the studio.

It was not the first group to be formed by former pupils: there had been one in the late 1800s but this had disbanded. However, in 1908, eighteen old boys met in London, agreed to reform, and the OTA was established at the beginning of 1909. Within a few weeks of its inception membership stood at 45. Since then it has thrived, thousands have joined over the years, and today it is a flourishing Association with over 2000 members.

It is located in the district of Bruck an der Leitha in the state of Lower Austria. Mannersdorf is seated at the base of a range of wooded hills called the Leitha Mountains (Leithagebirge), from which it receives its full name. It overlooks an agricultural plain, through which flows the Leitha River, about two miles away. Palace Former town hall Plague column History The area of Mannerdorf has been inhabited since Neolithic times, as the archaeological materials in the municipal museum demonstrate. Excavations in 1981 indicate that the town itself has existed for at least 1000 years; the earliest historical mention is from 1233. Mannersdorf lies along historical invasion routes and its history has not been entirely serene. The town was razed by invading Turkish armies in 1529 and 1683, and burnt to the ground in 1704, 1705 and 1708 by the rebelling Hungarian forces known as the Kuruzzen. In 1805, 1809, and 1810, French troops were quartered there, following successful invasions of Austria by Napoleon. Soviet troops occupied the town near the end of World War II, in 1945. The baths In 1517, a Dr. Enzianer, who was Rector of the University of Vienna and court physician, established a bathing establishment, making use of the waters of a slightly sulfurousMannersdorf am Leithagebirge spring, temperature 22.5 degrees C. This spa remained popular for about 250 years. In the mid 18th century the spa was quite fashionable, visited by members of the Imperial family including Empress Maria Theresia. The baths continued until 1786, when they were closed by a decree of Emperor Joseph II. The baths were reopened only much later (1928), and continue to operate today, more as a water park (with pools and a water slide) than as a traditional spa. Musical history Mannersdorf was also a center of music. During the fashionable apogee of the 18th century, Prince Hildburghausen put on concerts and operatic productions in the town, and eminent musicians came to perform and visit the spa. The composer Joseph Haydn spent three summer months in Mannersdorf in 1753, though being only 21 and a struggling freelancer, he came not as a tourist but more or less as a servant. The ambassador of Venice to the Austrian Empire, Pietro Correr, visited the spa in the company of his mistress,Her name is known only as \\"Wilhelmine\\". who required the presence of the singing teacher who regularly taught her in Vienna. This was the Italian composer Nicola Porpora. At the time, Haydn was working for Porpora as an accompanist and valet. He was placed on salary in the Correr establishment at a rate of six ducats per month and ate his meals with the Correr servants. The visit was a career opportunity for the young Haydn, as the famous composers Gluck and Wagenseil heard him play. A monument on the Schubertplatz commemorates Haydn's stay.

Background Ola Didrik Saugstad is a son of the psychologist Per Saugstad and a grandson of the former rector of the University of Oslo Didrik Arup Seip. His father earned a PhD in psychology at the University of Chicago in 1952, before he became a professor of psychology at the University of Oslo, and was noted for introducing an experimental approach to psychology in Norway, influenced by American psychology. Ola Didrik Saugstad is the brother of Jens Saugstad, a professor of philosophy at the University of Oslo. Career He graduated with the cand. med. degree at the University of Oslo in 1973. Already as a medical student he became interested in the Swedish professor Gösta Rooth's research in the field of perinatal medicine and especially intrauterine asphyxia, and Rooth invited him to come to Sweden and do research; thus, after graduation he was a research fellow at Uppsala University Hospital. The research he carried out under Rooth's mentorship laid the foundation for his doctoral dissertation in 1977, Hypoxanthine as an Indicator of Hypoxia, and for what would become his major research interest. From 1980 to 1981 he was a Fogarty International Fellow at the Department of Neonatology of the University of California, San Diego, in the unit of the legendary professor Louis Gluck, known as the father of neonatology. Saugstad was appointed senior consultant in newborn medicine at Rikshospitalet in 1986. In 1991, he also became Professor of Pediatrics and Director of the Department of Pediatric Research at the University of Oslo. From 2002 to 2004 he was President of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine. He was a board member of the European Society of Pediatric Research from 1987 to 1990, and of the International Pediatric Foundation from 2001 to 2004.Christian P. Speer, Henry L. Halliday, Laudatio: Ola Didrik Saugstad – An Oxygen Radical. Neonatology 2008;94:188–189. Saugstad retired as Professor of Medicine and Director of the Department of Pediatric Research at the end of 2017. From 2017 he is affiliated with Oslo University Hospital as a research professor. In 2018 he was also appointed as Professor of Neonatology at the Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. Research In 1980, Saugstad was the first to demonstrate that oxygenation after a period of asphyxia could result in an explosive increase in oxygen radicals. In the late 1980s, Saugstad and Rooth published a seminal article questioning the use of 100% oxygen in the resuscitation of newborn children.Gösta Rooth, obituary, Dagens Nyheter, 2008-05-06 This would lead to his major discovery of the dangers of using 100% oxygen, resulting in the amendment of the international guidelines for newborn resuscitation in 2010 based on the research of Saugstad and his team. Saugstad has described the use of 100% oxygen as \\"one of the largest scandals in the history of medicine.\\"Livsfarlig oksygen, Aftenposten, 1 April 2014 It is estimated that his discovery can save the lives of 200,000 children each year.

It was designed in 1890 by the famous French architect and construction engineer Gustave Eiffel, to function as a customs building. It was built close to historical Konak Square and adds significant value to the area even now. The building was constructed with stone masonry and covered with rough plaster. For the roof design wood trusses were added. Even though it was meant to be a customs building, its function changed several times. In 1960 it started to function as a fish market. With the restructuring efforts in 2003–2004, Konak Pier gain its current look and function as upmarket shopping center. Context The building's location can be considered in an urban context due to its developing industrial surroundings. It is located close to two of the city marks like İzmir's famous Clock Tower and Konak Square. Konak Pier Roof Truss System When it was functioning as a customs building, the building was close to the dock where every export product from European countries were loaded. Today Konak Pier has become a city mark that İzmir is associated with. The building is a remarkable example of contrast with its modern steel constructed additions and it's both historical and modern surroundings. The façade that faces the first kordon is the most decorated one. The building contains several entries. One from the additional part which is on the South façade. The other entry is located on the east façade of the building which faces the pedestrian bridge. Formal qualities The plan of the building can be considered as combined prismatic forms. The long rectangular form is the restored old building and the square shaped part is steel and crick constructed additional part. Both parts have similar interior qualities and roof structure. Konak Pier Interior Look The interior consists of partition walls for the shops and stone masonry exterior walls. The details of the building arched openings and marvel floors. The approach to the building doesn’t give any clues of the building layout like any other mall. One sees a long corridor which surrounded with cinema and stores on each sides. Stores are located parallel to each other with wide walkways. The truss system of the roof can be seen from inside. And because of the small openings to outside one can see small birds like sparrows which gives the building cozy and intimate look.  Structure and material qualities The construction of the building can be explained with stone masonry and rough plaster cover. Later on second floor was added with concrete slabs and brick walls. The later addition part was constructed with cast iron columns and steel profiled points on top of it.

The convention centre is connected to the Winnipeg Walkway system via an above- ground walkway connection crossing St. Mary Avenue and Hargrave Street to Cityplace mall. The Walkway system also provides convenient access to the Bell MTS Place. History The convention centre was recommended as part of the Metropolitan Corporation of Greater Winnipeg (Metro) Downtown Development Plan of 1969. Metro and the Province of Manitoba announced the $35 million Winnipeg Convention Centre on September 10, 1970. Always in opposition to metropolitan government, Mayor of Winnipeg, Stephen Juba did not attend the announcing press conference. left Originally named the Winnipeg Convention Centre, the publicly owned facility was built in 1975. The building, designed by Canadian architect Isadore (Issie) Coop, of the Number Ten Architectural Group,\\"Winnipeg Architecture Foundation, Biography, Isadore Coop\\" was among the first such facilities built in Canada. Aside from trade shows and conventions, the Convention Centre has also been used as a sports venue and was home to the Winnipeg Cyclone basketball team from 1995 to 2001. A $180-million expansion, completed between 2012 and 2015, roughly doubled the size of the facility, adding of exhibit space and underground parking. In July 2013, the facility was rebranded as the RBC Convention Centre Winnipeg after its naming rights were purchased by Royal Bank of Canada. By 2017 the annual visitor count to the Winnipeg Convention Centre had increased by about 50,000 to 557,000 which was directly related to the WCC expansion.  Events  The Winnipeg Convention Centre hosts regularly scheduled annual events such as a New Years' Eve dinner and dance, a Christmas crafts show known as the \\"Signatures Handmade Market\\", the Mid-Canada Boat Show, the Manitoba RV Show and Sale, the Winnipeg Career Fair, the Home & Garden Show (formerly Home Expression Show), the Winnipeg Comicon Show, a Wedding Show. In the 1970s it was the host venue for the Progressive Conservative (1976) and the Liberal (June 1984?) leadership conventions. The WCC was the site of the January 1983 PC party convention where Joe Clark decided to step down as leader. All provincial leadership conventions, except recent NDP, since 1975 have been held at the Winnipeg Convention Centre.

The genre was especially popular in the first half of the 2000s, and experienced another small resurgence through the 2010s. There are several scenes associated with the nu- disco term, the original one is characterized as house music fused with disco elements (sometimes incorrectly referred to as disco house), and disco- influenced balearic music, also known as balearic beat revival or balearica. Nu-disco is often confused with the other disco-influenced house music genres, such as French house or disco house. French house has heavily sample based production, compared to the usually programmed or live original instrumentation that nu-disco relies on. The other key difference is in the song structure - nu-disco usually have the typical song structure of pop or classic disco song, with various breakdowns, and often with verses and a chorus, whereas disco house generally has a more constant and unvaried character throughout, as the most of house music. History= Early developments, disco-edits: mid 1990s–late 1990s  The early developments of the genre are linked with the Black Cock Records, primarily active in 1993-1998, founded by DJ Harvey and Gerry Rooney. The label was focused on releasing non-official re-edits of disco tracks and some funk-influenced rock. It was not the first existing disco-edits bootleg label, but had a huge impact on a generation of house music producers, inspiring many in digging decadent genre and adjusting their own house music productions with disco-sounding elements. In the mid 1990s Nuphonic Records was the house label for British artists Idjut Boys, Faze Action, Raj Gupta and Crispin J Glover, which are considered to be the pioneers of nu-disco. The Idjut Boys, best known for pioneering a house music style called \\"disco-dub\\" were heavily inspired by the freestyle and dub-influenced, post-disco dance sounds of the early 1980s. Faze Action were one of the first house production units to make \\"all live\\" productions that insisted on drawing on methods used in disco. DJ Dave Lee aka Joey Negro and Crazy P are also called to be the pioneers of the genre. In 1997, DJ I-F released the track Space Invaders Are Smoking Grass, a track based around electro-funk drum patterns, 80s FM synth stabs and vocoder vocals, that single-handedly started the electroclash movement, and brought melodic, European sounding electro-disco back to clubs and DJ sets. In 1999, I-F released the first of his \\"Mixed Up In The Hague\\" mixes, made up almost entirely of Italo disco and Euro disco, which became hugely influential.  Mainstream success, French house and disco house synonym: late 1990s–mid 2000s  In the late 1990s to early 2000s, disco-inspired dance genres became popular; many French house, funky house, and disco house songs broke into the charts. Popular tracks such as Kylie Minogue's \\"Spinning Around\\", Sophie Ellis-Bextor's \\"Take Me Home\\" and \\"Murder on the Dancefloor\\", Jamiroquai's \\"Little L\\", and Freemasons \\"Love on My Mind\\" all made the top ten of the UK Singles Chart. By this time, the nu-disco scene was heavily associated with disco house and French house. The moniker \\"nu-disco\\" first appeared in print as early as 2002. In 2002, The Independent described nu-disco as the result of applying \\"modern technology and pin-sharp production\\" to 1970s disco and funk. In the early 2000s the genre was a dance music mainstay, right until the mid-2000s when electro house gained commercial success, leaving nu-disco in decline from mainstream and pushing it to further development. Metro Area self-titled album, released in 2002, is often being called as one of the most influential albums in the genre. The album named the second best album of the decade by Resident Advisor and the best nineteenth of the decade by Fact magazine.  Decline in popularity and development of the sound: mid 2000s–late 2000s  In the 2000s nu-disco gained a new sound, which was developed in various local scenes: * Norwegian disco, a fusion of space disco with nu-disco, notable artists are Lindstrøm, Prins Thomas and Todd Terje. * Balearica or Balearic beat revival, a European scene, highly influenced by Balearic house, mostly presented by Belgian act Aeroplane and other European producers. * European synth-driven nu-disco, influenced by Italo disco, 1980s synth-pop and new wave, pioneered by and Kris Menace, the scene later outgrew into synthwave movement. * Australian scene, which crosses boundaries with indietronica and indie dance, notable artists are Miami Horror and Bag Raiders. In July 2008 Beatport added genre category \\"Nu Disco / Indie Dance\\", stating that nu-disco is \\"everything that springs from the late '70s and early '80s (electronic) disco, boogie, cosmic, Balearic and Italo disco continuum\\". Originally, service associated it with re-edits of classic disco records and a handful of European electronic producers who made music in that style. It was used alongside alternative dance up until September 2019, when Beatport separated categories into two, leaving nu-disco in \\"Nu Disco / Disco\\". In the 2008 Spin magazine stated that disco is experiencing a worldwide renaissance, with a flowering of new labels, compilations, and club nights, calling the disco of the 21st century seedy, underground, and punk in attitude. The magazine pointed that Euro disco sound, including instrumental space disco and the late-1970s—early-1980s Italo disco, was the main influence on the nu-disco scene of that time. Tensnake's single \\"Coma Cat\\" hit the European charts in 2010 and was one of the most success nu-disco tracks of that time.  Back to mainstream: early 2010s–present  In the early 2010s bands such as Metronomy, Hercules & Love Affair and Friendly Fires started using nu-disco elements in their songs, bringing nu-disco back to mainstream popularity and critical acclaim. Nu-disco artists Aeroplane and Soulwax became massively influential and have been released on major labels, while other producers are commissioned anonymously to work for pop acts. Steve Kotey, member of cult band Chicken Lips, said in 2012: \\"30 percent of music in the charts have the feeling of this left-field disco production style in it. The producers give it that kind of shine that makes it more for radio than your DJ box. You can hear the electronic Chicken Lips stuff that was prevalent in 2003 in some of Lady Gaga's music\\". In 2013, several disco and funk-influences songs charted as top hits, this time more in a 1970s style and one source stated that the pop charts had more dance songs than at any other point since the late 1970s. The biggest disco hit of the year was \\"Get Lucky\\" by Daft Punk, featuring Chic's Nile Rodgers on guitar. The song was initially thought likely to be a leading candidate to become the summer's biggest hit that year; however, the song ended up peaking at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for five weeks behind another major disco-styled song, Robin Thicke's \\"Blurred Lines\\", which spent twelve weeks at number 1 on the Hot 100, and in the process became the eventual song of the summer itself. Both were popular with a wide variety of demographic groups. In mid 2010s to early 2020s trend continued, many major dance-pop artists dabbed into the style. Calvin Harris released well-received by critics nu-disco / funk album \\"Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1\\" in 2017, which reached high position in both UK and US charts. Dua Lipa released nu-disco album \\"Future Nostalgia\\" in 2020, that broke into top charts in many countries. The album also spawned the nu-disco single Don't Start Now, which peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 2020. In May 2020, Studio 54, the former nightclub and 1970s center of the disco culture, has launched a record label called Studio 54 Music, featuring newly re-imagined versions of classic club disco tracks by Don Ray and T-Connection.  Characteristics = Disco edits / re-edits  A modified version of the original master, edited by disco and house DJs to extend and emphasize the best and most dance- friendly elements. Todd Terje's edit of the Bee Gees hit \\"You Should Be Dancing\\" does exactly that, downplaying the dated vocal riffs in favor of driving bass, lively percussion, and an overall sense of space. Many nu-disco producers are also disco editors and often there is a bit of overlap between the two genres as many nu-disco songs feature samples of classic disco tracks. It is also not uncommon for an edit to be made of a modern track.Credit To The Edit Volume Two: Sleevenotes  Electrofunkroots Modern notable disco editors include Greg Wilson, Todd Terje, Dimitri from Paris, Joey Negro and the Flying Mojito Bros.  Drum groove  Since nu-disco is a dance genre first and foremost, the drum grooves are an essential part. They often feature four-on- the-floor beats with an organic, lively feel based on the sounds of classic disco recordings by Chic, Sister Sledge, and others. In some cases, producers will sample these grooves directly. Los Angeles-based producer Goldroom uses both house and disco influenced drum grooves in tracks such as \\"Waiting to Ignite\\".  Live instrumentation  While modern production is abundant with synthesized sounds, many nu-disco records are, in the disco tradition, driven by guitar or bass licks. Guitarist, producer, and songwriter Nile Rodgers brought riffs to the forefront of the groove with Chic in the 1970s and again with Daft Punk in 2013. Other notable modern examples include \\"Baby I'm Yours\\" by Breakbot and \\"Holding On\\" by Classixx.  Synthesizers  As with other electronic genres, nu-disco producers use both digital and analog synths to create melodic and harmonic lines, and add ambiance and color to their records. Gigamesh uses a heavily synthesized sound while still retaining old- school influences in tracks such as \\"Back to Life\\", and Poolside uses atmospheric synths to complement their drum, bass, and guitar sounds in \\"Do You Believe\\".  Arrangement  Unlike its disco precursors, nu-disco and disco house are not beholden to song forms that are essential to the modern pop idiom. Rather than following the traditional verse-chorus model, nu-disco tends to take after its electronic cousins, with more drawn-out, repetitive sections that slowly ramp up to the chorus and back down again. Otherwise monotonous lines are brought to life with the use of filters, samples, and other subtle changes in the sound or groove over time in ways that make people want to keep dancing. Daft Punk's \\"One More Time\\" is considered one of the most influential examples of the application of \\"filter disco.\\"  Notable labels  * Black Cock Records (UK) was founded by DJ Harvey, and operated primarily in the 1990s. The label issued disco mixes and re-edits, and encouraged many young DJs on the label to incorporate disco elements into their house mixes, despite it being out of fashion at the time. * Nuphonic Records (UK), which carries releases from a range of electronic genres and subgenres, helped launch a number of acts in the 1990s and early 2000s including Faze Action and Raj Gupta, and was one of the early pioneers of collaboration, fusion of genres, and live performance in disco house and beyond. The label has been suggested as the origin of the phrase \\"nu-disco\\". * DFA Records (NYC) was initially started by James Murphy as a platform to launch his and his band LCD Soundsystem's music. The label has released records from a number of dance rock and nu-disco acts, including its very first hit with The Rapture and nu-disco/electronica project The Juan MacLean. * Roche Musique (FR) is a progressive nu-disco and chill electronica label on the French scene. Citing the importance of the \\"French Touch\\", artists such as FKJ and Darius have released records on the label. * Ballroom Records (US) is a now defunct label that produced a large number of bootleg re-edits released as white labels.  Notable artists  * French duo Daft Punk has had a significant influence on nu-disco and numerous genres related to it. Their albums Homework and Discovery contain several reinterpretations of classic disco records, and they collaborated with Nile Rodgers on the hit single \\"Get Lucky\\". Although many French artists in the French house scene have produced music associated with nu-disco, Daft Punk are the most recognised name in the scene internationally. * Dimitri From Paris, another French artist, is also strongly associated with the genre. Rather than focusing on 1970s pop records, he uses eclectic sources for samples such as 1950s jazz, Latin exotica, and film soundtracks. * Norwegian producer Hans-Peter Lindstrøm pioneered a new sound in European clubs that became a precursor to nu-disco. With a musical background spanning from country and rock to gospel and jazz, Lindstrom's \\"Norse House\\", which has gained an international reputation, evoked many of the elements of 1970s disco. Other Norwegian producers connected to the scene are Lindstrom's studio mate Prins Thomas and protege Todd Terje.

The order for its establishment was issued by Isma'il Pasha who was, then, the Khedive of Egypt. The first rules of the Council were issued in January 1874 by Khedive Tewfik Pasha who ruled Egypt after his father Isma'il Pasha. By 1883, the Council was fully established and in charge of managing non ecclesiastical matters of the church. The Chairman of the council is the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria.

Members  Currently the Council is formed of twenty four members (males and females) elected by the Copts in Egypt and is chaired by the Pope.  Relations with the Popes  The Council had a disagreement with Pope Cyril V of Alexandria at the start of his pontificate, which was resolved in the Pontiff's favour. This was followed by several confrontations between the two parties, primarily because of the Pope's objection about the interference of the Council in the church's matters. There were at many times tension between the Council and the Pope, especially during the Pontificate of Pope Macarius III (1942–1944), the council agreed with The Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church in the decision to remove Pope Joseph II (1946–1956) from office in 1954. During the Pontificate of Pope Cyril VI (1959–1971) there was no major disagreements and Pope Shenouda III (1971–2012) maintained a good relationship with the Council, since he was the Chairman of the Council.

The style blended traditional elements from Rajput and Mughal painting with a more Western treatment of perspective, volume and recession. Most paintings were small, reflecting the Indian miniature tradition, but the natural history paintings of plants and birds were usually life size . Locations Leading centres were the main British settlements of Calcutta, Madras (Chennai), Delhi, Lucknow, Patna, the Maratha court of Thanjavur and Bangalore. Subjects included portraits, landscapes and views, and scenes of Indian people, dancers and festivals. Series of figures of different castes or trades were particular favourites, with an emphasis on differences in costume; now they are equally popular as subjects for analysis by historians of the imperialist mentality. Portfolios of animal or botanical subjects were also commissioned, and some erotic subjects. Architectural subjects were popular, usually done in a detailed and frontal style more like that of an architectural draftsman than the Romanticised style used by most European painters visiting India. The techniques varied, but mostly drew on Western watercolour technique, from which \\"transparency of texture, soft tones and modelling in broad strokes\\" were borrowed.Linda Leach in George Mitchell (ed.), In the Image of Man, The Indian Perception of the Universe through 2000 years of painting and sculpture, Royal Academy of Arts, London, 1982, Patrons and artists Great Indian Fruit Bat (Pteropus giganteus), Bhawani Das or follower, 1777–82, from Mary Impey's album of natural history paintings Large-scale patrons included Colonel James Skinner of Skinner's Horse fame, who had a Rajput mother, and for natural history paintings, Mary Impey, wife of Elijah Impey, who commissioned over three hundred, and the Marquess Wellesley, brother of the first Duke of Wellington, who had over 2,500. There were equivalent movements, but much smaller, around the French and Portuguese possessions in India, and in other South Asian areas like Burma and Ceylon. The French-born Major- General Claude Martin (1735–1800), latterly based in Lucknow, commissioned 658 paintings of birds, including Black Stork in a Landscape, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Some notable artists include Mazhar Ali Khan, who worked on Thomas Metcalfe's Delhi Book, and was part of a dynasty of miniature artists, the patriarch of whom, Ghulam Ali Khan, had worked for William Fraser on a similar commission known as the Fraser Album, considered a masterpiece. He, like his uncle Ghulam Murtaza Khan, also painted portraits of the last Mughal emperors and their courts. Material A Green- Winged Macaw, folio, , from Mary Impey's album of natural history paintings, Attributed by inscription to Shaikh Zain al-Din, Calcutta, about 1780, opaque watercolor on paper. Paintings were mostly on paper, but sometimes on ivory, especially those from Delhi. They were mostly intended to be kept in portfolios or albums; the muraqqa or album was very well established among Indian collectors, though usually including calligraphy as well, as least in Muslim examples. The style developed in the second half of the 18th century, and by the early nineteenth century production was at a considerable level, with many of the cheaper paintings being copied by rote. By the 19th century many artists had shops to sell the work and workshops to produce it. Decline The arrival of photography was a direct blow for the style, but it survived into the 20th century, Ishwari Prasad of Patna, who died in 1950, being perhaps the last notable exponent. In the late 19th century the British established several Schools of Art, where a yet more Westernised version of the style was taught, later in competition with other styles.

Al-Hidayah 2018 was held between the dates of 17–19 August 2018 at Fletcher Hotel Doorwerth-Arnhem in Arnhem under the spiritual guidance of Shaykh-ul-Islam, Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri. More information can be found by visiting alhidayah.nl  Al-Hidayah 2005 (Pioneer Centre, Shropshire)  In 2005, Minhaj-ul-Quran UK began 'Al-Hidayah', a series of annual 3 day residential educational and spiritual retreats, targeted at British Muslims, and inviting the foremost Islamic scholars from around the world. Al-Hidayah 2005 was held in the picturesque surroundings of the Pioneer Centre, Shropshire under the spiritual guidance of his imminence Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri head of Minhaj ul Quran International. Over 300 young Muslims attended the 3 day event and due to its success the residential retreat has been held as an annual event. The aims and objectives of Al Hidayah were to provide British youth with true knowledge of Islamic teachings based on love, peace and humanity.  Al-Hidayah 2006 (Heythrop Park, Oxfordshire)  Al-Hidayah 2006, was held between Friday 25 August to Monday 28 August 2006 in Heythrop Park, Oxfordshire. The main speaker at the event was Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri. The event was also attended by Shaykh Asad Muhammad Saeed as-Sagharji, who was a great scholar from the Islamic world. The main feature of the event was the keynote speech of Shaykh- ul-Islam on the Life and Travels of Imam Bukhari. The organisers attracted more than 600 participants from United Kingdom and Europe and as far as the United States.  Al-Hidayah 2007 (Heythrop Park, Oxfordshire)  The third annual Al-Hidayah Residential Spiritual and Educational Retreat took place at the same venue as the 2006 event, in Heythrop Park Oxfordshire. Hundreds of participants from all over the United Kingdom and Europe came to benefit from the one in a lifetime opportunity of spending four days in the company of Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri. The previous two retreats were life changing for the young participants who were blessed with the opportunity of elevating their spirituality and to purify their inner-selves from lusts of the material world, to be replaced by a longing for the Creator. Alongside being a Mufassir, Muhadith and Faqih; among a long list of responsibilities that Shaykh-ul-Islam has taken upon himself in order to carry out his work for the Ummah, he is also one of the greatest Sufi leaders of the time. He is the ultimate all-in-one entity perfectly qualified to meet all the needs of those who want to escape from the clutches of materialism. Knowledge alone is not sufficient for this, thus a mere scholar is unable to bring about these changes in his followers. It is only when oceans of knowledge merge with galaxies of spiritualism, does a person qualify to carry out such a task. The venue selected by the Al-Hidayah organisers was the perfect environment for both gaining knowledge and also experiencing spiritual uplift. The peaceful and green surroundings together with the spiritual teachings and company of Shaykh-ul-Islam made the venue a practical fountain of Tazkiyyah, Ihsan and Tasawwuf. The venue also catered for all the needs of the participants including accommodating the needs of families with children, separate facilities for brothers and sisters such as gym, swimming pool, sports activities, excellent dining facilities and accommodation and much more. Shaykh Asad Muhammad Saeed as-Sagharji, Damascus Syria, was the chief guest. Shaykh Abdurahman al-Hammami and Sayyid Muadh were also special guests from Syria. Shaykh Abdul-Hakim Murad (University of Cambridge), a renowned British scholar was a guest speaker.  Al-Hidayah 2009 (University of Warwick)  Minhaj-ul-Quran UK organised a three-day annual \\"Al-Hidayah Youth Camp\\" at the University of Warwick in August 2009, which was attended by more than 1200 participants, from across the world. The participants started arriving at 9am on 8 August 2009. After the computerised verification of all delegates, they were issued passes. Renowned Syrian scholar, Shaykh Asad Muhammad Saeed as- Sagharji, delivered the first lecture to the participants on the subject of \\"Discipline & Morality\\". Shaykh Abdul-Hakim Murad Murad of University of Cambridge, another British scholar of immense erudition, delivered his talk on the importance of relations with other religions in a non-Muslim society. The proceedings of the first day were punctuated with the occasional recitation from the Quran and presentation of Nasheed to keep the participants spiritually energised. In addition to Shaykh Abdur Rahman and his companions, the \\"Qawals\\" of Hassan Minhaj Naat Council kept the audience spiritually ecstatic with their presentations in Arabic, Urdu and Punjabi languages. Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri was given a standing ovation and huge round of applause upon his arrival in the hall as chief organiser Dr Zahid Iqbal, welcomed Shaykh-ul-Islam and invited him to deliver his keynote speech. Shaykh-ul-Islam made \\"Peace & Unity\\" the subject of his address. Former minister of Egypt, Prof Yahya Jamal, attended the camp on the first day and delivered a special lecture. The pictorial exhibition of renowned British photographer, Peter Sanders, who embraced Islam in 1991, was also the focus of people's attention. His pictures highlighted religious, social and sociological behaviours and trends in different societies. The participants liked the exhibition very much. Dr Raheeq Ahmad Abbasi, Secretary General of Minhaj-ul-Quran, gave comprehensive briefing to the participants about the organisations worldwide network. The office bearers of Minhaj Welfare Foundation also gave briefing about their activities whose chief highlight was the ongoing project of ‘Aagosh’ (Orphan Care Home), which is estimated to cost 34 million rupees. The briefing also included details of Minhaj Welfare Foundation activities in other areas etc. The highlight of the camp was the question & answer session. The panel, which asked questions, included Canon Dr Christopher Lamb, representative of Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams, Professor Ron Geaves, Professor of the Comparative Study of Religion, Liverpool Hope University, Dr Sophie Gilliat-Ray, Director, Centre for the Study of Islam in the UK, Cardiff University, Dr Tahir Abbas, Director of the Centre for the Study of Ethnicity and Culture, University of Birmingham, Phil Rees, prominent journalist and producer, Maqsood Ahmed, Senior Advisor from Communities Ministry and Zahoor Niazi, Chief-Editor of Jang News London, Peter Sanders, prominent photographer. The thrust of every question revolved around the issue of terrorism, extremism and practical steps that could be taken to save the Muslim Youth from these scourges. The participants gave cheering applause and kept clapping in response to the answers given to these questions by Shaykh-ul-Islam, which speaks volumes of the satisfaction they must have derived from this informed discourse. Shaykh- ul-Islam reminded the youth attending the camp that they should not allow their love and association with the worldly life to exceed a particular limit. Rather they should focus on their morality, character and values so that they could not feel embarrassed in front of Prophet Muhammad on the Day of Judgement. He urged the youth to start implementing the teachings of Islam and following Prophet Muhammad ideal life for both material and spiritual success. Denouncing extremism and terrorism, Shaykh-ul-Islam said that peace was the main message of Islam. He threw light on the difference between Jihad and Terrorism, saying that Prophet Muhammad prescribed guidelines to be followed during war etc. The Muslims were prohibited from bringing any harm to non- combatants such as children, women, old people, and destroying orchards, animals and buildings of the enemy etc. \\"Whatever is being perpetrated in the name of religion is complete negation of what Islam stands for and it is clear violation of Islamic teachings,\\" Shaykh-ul-Islam said while referring to Islamic history. Shaykh-ul-Islam instructed the youth to devote themselves fully to obtaining an education and said that it is by playing positive role and making positive contribution to their respective societies that they can increase the esteem of their country and religion. He said that ideal character of forefathers was responsible for the spread of Islam around the globe, not the sword. Shaykh-ul-Islam said that Minhaj-ul-Quran was promoting the real message of Islam through its network by engaging other religions and communities in constructive dialogue for better tomorrow. He urged the youth to stand up to the extremists and terrorist who were out to malign Islam through their practices in collaboration with their communities and government institutions. \\"This is through joint action and understanding that we can eliminate extremism and terrorism,\\" he held. The three-day camp concluded on the determination to work collectively to spread awareness about Islamic teachings and defeat terrorists at intellectual levels.  Al-Hidayah 2010 (University of Warwick)  Al-Hidayah 2010 was held at The University of Warwick between 7 August and 9 August 2010 under the spiritual guidance of Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri. Al Hidayah held in 2010 was of great significance as it was the year Shaykh-ul-Islam released the world famous work titled Fatwa on Terrorism which is an Islamic edict condemning all forms of terrorism in the world. At the opening press conference Shaykh-ul- Islam Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri shed light on the aims and objectives of the camp and emphasised on the reasons why he believes it is necessary to train the youth to tackle extremist ideologies. He said that this 3-day initiative is aimed at awakening the Muslim youth to challenge the arguments of the extremist and to promote the need of collective action for promotion of peace, interfaith dialogue, and harmony and addressing the misunderstandings and confusions the concepts of jihad, khilafah and democracy. Analysing the emergence of terrorism, he said that cancer of terrorism does not emerge from nowhere but it begins as an ‘ideological infection’ which is a narrow interpretation and vision of Islam. It is misinterpretation of the Quran, Hadith and classical authorities of Islam. He said this process begins in mosques, schools, Universities, and through the internet by extremist groups. They initially start persuading their argument which leads towards brainwashing. He said that \\"terrorism is a cancer that begins from and an ideological infection.\\" Shaykh-ul-Islam said that following the publication of Fatwa on Terrorism, it put a stop to its practice of stereotyping the Muslims and conveyed the Islamic message of tolerance, harmony and interfaith dialogue to a wide range of people and regions. This step dealt a lethal blow to the extremists and encouraged the reformers. The event attracted over 1200 youngsters from all over United Kingdom and Europe.  Peace for Humanity Conference 2011 (Wembley Arena)  ‘Peace for Humanity’ Conference was held on 24 September 2011 at the Wembley Arena under the banner of Minhaj-ul-Quran UK. Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri presided over the Conference attended by 12,000 people, which was also attended by human rights and peace activists, religious scholars, opinion leaders and key leaders and followers of Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism. In his address, Shaykh-ul-Islam said that the world needed peace, security and brotherhood more than before. He said that after 9/11, the difficulties of the Muslims around the globe have increased manifold. The picture of Islam spread in the world has nothing to do with Islam and 99% of Muslims are peace-loving. He said that terrorism and extremism had affected the Muslims more than the world. He said that thousands of people were killed in terrorist incidents, affecting millions of families. Extremism, he said, divided people and produced pessimism and despondency. He congratulated MQI UK on holding such a grand and purposeful Conference.  Al-Hidayah 2016 (Keele University, Staffordshire)  Minhaj-ul-Quran UK Al-Hidayah project team arranged Al- Hidayah 2016 with a relevant and much needed focus on developing future leadership. This year’s event was the first three day event since Al-Hidayah 2010, and the objectives of the event were geared towards nurturing and inspiring future leaders from amongst the youth. Keele University in Staffordshire, was chosen as the venue for the event, set in 600 acres of scenic greenery and with all accommodation, facilities and events on campus, it provided the ideal environment for three days of learning and development. It is also worthy of note that this was Minhaj-ul-Qur’an International’s first three day residential event of this size organised anywhere in the world outside of Pakistan, without the direct participation of the founder of Minhaj-ul-Qur’an International, his eminence Shaykh-ul-Islam Dr. Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri. However, the event was presided over by the main keynote speaker Shaykh Dr. Hussain Mohi-ud-Din Qadri (President of the Minhaj Education Society), eloquently and with an ideal blend of knowledge, inspiration and motivation.

The Spartan garrison at Nisaea surrendered, but the Athenians were unable to capture Megara itself, and were compelled to withdraw when the Brasidas arrived to relieve the Megarans. Hippocrates then commanded an Athenian force which invaded Boeotia. Hippocrates was given command of the land force that was to take Delium and he succeeded in doing so and fortifying a garrison there. When Hippocrates learned that the Boeotian army was approaching, Hippocrates began to retreat to Athens; he was unable to do so, and fought an army commanded by Pagondas at the Battle of Delium. The Athenians were clearly defeated. Hippocrates died near the beginning of the battle and nearly a thousand Athenians were slain alongside him. Only nightfall prevented further losses. After a siege of seventeen days, Delium fell to the Boeotians and at that point the bodies of Hippocrates and the other men were returned to the Athenians.
