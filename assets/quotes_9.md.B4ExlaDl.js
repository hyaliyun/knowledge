His work indicated that, rather than riots being driven by hooligans who are predisposed to violence (the 'mindless mob' perspective developed at the end of the nineteenth century), they are structured and led by beliefs. The majority of the crowd consider that they are peaceful protestors with a right to express their views. If disorder or confrontation starts, and the police act against it, the crowd experiences what they consider is illegitimate police use of force. This changes their behaviour so that they resist the police. His research has led to changes in policing by some authorities with the aim of reducing violent confrontations. He studied the London Poll Tax riots and Italian World cup in 1990, riots in the UK in 2011 and in Hong Kong in 2019, using social media and mapping to follow their trajectory. Using ideas gained from his research, he advised a region of Portugal on policing football matches. The success of this approach led to its introduction across Portugal, and was subsequently adopted by UEFA across Europe. It has resulted in decreased violence.

Kroeber, and part of the Oxford University Press series 'What Everyone Needs To Know'. The book provides a broad overview of the rise of China's economy.  About  The book starts with the initiation of modern economic reforms in China starting with the Deng Xiaoping in 1979 and his prioritization of development over politics, conveyed as \\"Development is the only Iron Law\\". The chapters of the book go on to cover - agriculture and the rural economy, industry, urbanization, infrastructure, state-owned and private enterprises, the financial system, demographics, the labor market, inequality and corruption. The personalities and institutions in China that have led to its economic growth are discussed as well as the reforms that have worked, such as the 'de-collectivization of agriculture' into family farming, what would eventually become the single most important cause in the decrease in China's poverty levels from 84% in 1981 to 6% in 2011. The book provides an overview of the structure of the country as a decentralized bureaucratic- authoritarianism. The book also compares China to China's neighbourhood, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, which have also deeply influenced China's growth, with some major differences such as the level of influence of the United States on policy. Many of the fears related to China's economic growth, such as a prospective property crash, are overstated. The book also analyzes what the future holds for China, how Xi Jinping seems to be reinforcing his political strength, which may cause troubles to China's economy in the future. The Sinica Podcast says that the book is a \\"refreshing antidote to much of the commentary in the media\\", the \\"conventional wisdom\\" related to China.

He became the foremost intermediary between the Tahitians and the French during the visit, and volunteered to accompany Bougainville on his journey back to France. After one year in Paris, Ahutoru undertook the journey back to Tahiti, but he died of smallpox on the way.  Biography  Ahutoru was born on Raiatea. He was the son of a slave taken from Oopoa, and of the king of Raiatea. He was around 30 years old when Bougainville arrived at Tahiti. After Bougainville's arrived at Tahiti, Ahutoru boarded √âtoile with gifts, and stayed the night. Bougainville first attempted to call Ahutoru \\"Louis de Cyth√®re\\", but after he befriended Bougainville, he started using the name \\"Butaveri\\", the tahitianised version of Bougainville's name. Ahutoru had himself dressed in the French fashion by Commerson's valet, who was Jeanne Baret in disguise. Ahutoru quickly recognised her as a woman and revealed her as such to the other members of the crew. Ahutoru courted Bar√© with insistence until Commerson led him to believe that she was married. On 15 April 1768, Boudeuse and √âtoile set sail to depart Tahiti. Seeing the frigates readying for departure, Tahitians came on boats to give their farewell. The chief gifted Bougainville a boat sail, and asked him to take Ahutoru with him. Bougainville promised to provide him with the means to return to Tahiti. En route, Bougainville had French lessons given to Ahutoru. However, Ahutoru never had more than a rudimentary command of French. He nevertheless managed to communicate, enlightening Bougainville on aspects of Tahitian life that had eluded the French during the few days they had spent on the island. In particular, Ahutoru informed Bougainville that war was a common state of affairs between the islands, that they practiced slavery and human sacrifices, and that a strict class system was in force. He thus became the prime source of information for Bougainville's ethnographic work about Tahiti. Ahutoru also impressed the crew with his knowledge of astronomy and his skills as a navigator. Bougainville also noted that Ahutoru composed poetry in his native language to describe his experiences on Boudeuse. On 3 May 1768, Boudeuse and √âtoile arrived at Samoa where Ahutoru proved contempuous of the inhabitants and could not understand their language. Bougainville had hoped that Ahutoru could serve as an interpreter in further first contacts, but these contacts proved too rare, and the languages in the archipelago too diverse, for the idea to be practical. In September, Boudeuse and √âtoile called Batavia, which impressed Ahutoru, but where many of the crew caught dysentery, Ahutoru himself included. He finally arrived at Saint-Malo on Boudeuse on 16 March 1769. Bougainville and Ahutoru departed for Versailles immediately. On 25 April, Ahutoru also met Jacob Rodrigues Pereira, who examined him. Pereira concluded that the Tahitian phonetic system to which Ahutoru was used allowed him to pronounce only a few of the French Consonants, and none of the nasal vowels. During the summer of 1769, Ahutoru was introduced in the high society, notably meeting Louis XV and Denis Diderot. He developed a marked taste of opera. Ahutoru was well-adjusted to the life in Paris, easily navigating the city and using money. He befriended B√©atrix de Choiseul-Stainville, whom he often visited when she was in Paris. Ahutoru had multiple relationships with women in Paris, including with sex workers. Ahutoru's presence in Paris yielded controversy: Bougainville was accused of unethically removing Ahutoru from what he himself said was paradise on earth, to bring him to Paris as an exhibit. Bougainville had to defend himself and insisted that Ahutoru had volunteered to come. After a year, Ahutoru was homesick and lonely in Paris. Bougainville paid to offer him passage back to Tahiti, and the Duchess of Choiseul offered money to purchase tools, grain and cattle for Tahiti. On 27 February 1770, Ahutoru departed Paris for La Rochelle, and in late March 1770, he departed Rochefort on Brisson, bound for Port-Louis. Brisson arrived there on 23 October. At Isle de France, Ahutoru was hosted by Poivre, and met Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, who wrote an account describing Ahutoru as intelligent, and noting that he could express himself by signs, and that he used a watch. Pierre Poivre, the intendent of Isle de France, had orders to return Ahutoru to Tahiti but to also save the cost of chartering a ship especially for the purpose. Ahutoru thus embarked on the 350-tonne fluyt Mascarin, under Marion Dufresne. Mascarin, along with the 300-tonne Mar√©chal de Castries, were on a mission of exploration to Tasmania, New Zealand and ultimately Tahiti. Ahutoru then changed his name to \\"Mayoa\\" in honour of Marion, as he had previously done with Bougainville. Ahutoru departed Isle de France on Mascarin on 18 October 1771, but arriving at Saint- Denis, he fell ill with smallpox. Marion continued on to Madagascar, but Ahutoru died Fort Dauphin in Madagascar (now T√¥lanaro) in the evening of 6 November 1771. Lieutenant Roux noted: \\"his passing affects us all the more that he was one of the reasons for our expedition, and that he was a good man.\\" Ahutoru was buried at sea with his clothes and personal effects, and given a Christian ceremony.  Works about Ahutoru  Bougainville authored two works about Autoru, R√©cit sur le s√©jour de Boutaveri en France (\\"tales of Butaveri's stay in France\\") and Impressions de voyage de Aotoutou (\\"Ahutoru's voyage journal\\"), now lost. La Condamine authored Observations sur l'insulaire de la Polyn√©sie ramen√© de l'√Æle de Tahiti par M. de Bougainville. Jacques Delille wrote a poem depicting Ahutoru falling in tears at the sight of a tree from Tahiti. There exists no known portrait of Ahutoru.

Between May 1985 and 1988, she hired two men, Edwin Gordon and Lionel Robinson, for a series of brutal insurance murders in Baltimore, Maryland. Parrish suffered from a superiority complex, as a result of which her relatives and close friends became victims of her crimes.  Biography  Very little is known about Geraldine's early life. She was born in rural North Carolina, in a poor family with several other brothers and sisters. In her youth, Parrish began attending church, where she became acquainted with the basics of Catholicism. Later on, she developed an interest in the religions practiced by people in Central and West Africa, particularly Santer√≠a and Voodoo. In subsequent years, Geraldine studied deeper into the religious aspects and rituals, and eventually came to practice them. Since the 1970s, she began to present herself as a member of the clergy, but no supporting evidence of her position in any religion was uncovered, and her position as an ordained minister was declared a breakaway.  Murders  In the late 1970s, Parrish began to show signs of a superiority complex and began to exhibit deviant behavior towards her friends and relatives. In the early 1980s, she developed a get rich quick scheme by receiving insurance benefits via life insurance policies. For this purpose, Parrish urged relatives, friends and acquaintances to make life insurance policies that made her the only beneficiary in the event of an untimely death. In order to get said benefits, Parrish planned out several killings in the mid-1980s. The first victim was 46-year-old Frank Lee Ross, a friend of one of Geraldine's sisters, who was shot dead on November 12, 1985. This murder was committed by 20-year-old Edwin Bernardo Gordon, whom Parrish paid more than $2,000 to commit the killing. On October 6, 1986, Albert Robinson and Parrish's brother Ronald Brown were killed by Lionel Robinson (no relation), and on March 6, 1987, 65-year-old Helen Wright, Geraldine's housekeeper, was killed. After her death, Parrish received more than $10,000 from life insurance and social security checks. This murder was also committed by Gordon, who also received a reward of $2,000. Six months later, Parrish arranged a plan to kill her niece, 29-year- old Dolly Brown, for whom Geraldine was the beneficiary of an insurance policy worth more than $10,000. On September 19, 1987, Edwin attacked the girl and her husband, 37-year-old Ronald Mitcher, during which Mitcher was shot dead. Brown survived, and went on to survive two more attempts on her life.  Arrest  After the unsuccessful attempt to kill Dolly Brown in May 1988, Edwin Gordon was arrested and soon began cooperating with the investigators. He told them that Parrish had orchestrated everything, and she was arrested later that summer. Gordon was charged with three murders, four counts of assault and conspiracy to murder, while Geraldine was charged with conspiracy to murder and contract killing. Subsequently, Parrish was suspected of committing several more murders, after it became clear that 77-year-old Rayfield Gilliard died in February 1988, 15 days after marrying her. He had left his home, money and social benefits amounting to $440 per month in a life insurance policy, which Geraldine began receiving a month after his death. The death certificate stated that Gilliard had died from a cardiovascular disease, but there was no record in his medical history that he ever had any heart problems.  Trial  Parrish's trial began in early 1989. During the course of the trial, Geraldine feigned insanity, but according to the results of a forensic psychiatric examination, she was recognized as sane. In May, she and Edwin Gordo plead guilty to organizing and committing four murders between November 1985 to May 1988, in order to receive insurance benefits in the amount of $39,000. They were also found guilty of assaulting three more people. After the conviction, Parrish received eight terms of life imprisonment, with no chance of parole. Her accomplice was also given several life imprisonment terms.  Further fate  After her conviction, Geraldine Parrish was sent to the Maryland Correctional Institution for Women to serve her sentence. According to unconfirmed reports, she died in custody in the 2000s.

She also made significant contributions to the understanding of encephalitis lethargica.  Early life and education  L√©vy was born in Paris on 11 January 1886 to Mina Marie Lang (1851‚Äì1903) and Emile Gustave L√©vy (1844‚Äì1912), who was in the textile business. She was the last of five children, and the only girl. As a child, she had many interests including music, but chose to study medicine. An obituary published in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease describes her as having \\"qualities of intense application and of intelligence.\\" L√©vy started her in Paris in 1911. Between 1912 and 1915, she worked at the surgical department of La Piti√© Hospital, with Paul Oulmont at , with Antoine Marfan at the , and again at La Piti√© Hospital with Professor Enrique. She then worked for three years with Pierre Marie at the , then completed her internship between 1918 and 1919. At the Salp√™tri√®re, L√©vy also acted as Marie's chief of laboratory (1920‚Äì1922), and later assistant at the pathology department (1923‚Äì1926). In 1925, at the age of 39, she was named associated physician at the Paul-Brousse Hospital. She became a full attending physician shortly before her death.  Research interests  L√©vy was known professionally for her scientific rigour, her passion for neuropathology, and her perseverance. During her career, L√©vy focused on two main areas of research: encephalitis lethargica, and the Roussy‚ÄìL√©vy syndrome, which was named for her. However, she also worked on Lhermitte symptom and the Lhermitte-L√©vy syndrome, the neurology of war, movement disorders including palatal myoclonus, brain tumours, and disorders associated with higher cortical functions such as palilalia. According to her obituary, \\"her investigations brought out much entirely new material.\\" Gustave Roussy also praised her work for its originality. Though she is rarely cited as first-author in the publications to which she contributed, Roussy credited her with many of the initial ideas for projects, and a great part of their execution, describing her role in the research as \\"dominant\\".  Encephalitis lethargica  L√©vy's first article was a collaboration with Pierre Marie describing 10 cases of movement disorders associated with encephalitis lethargica. She subsequently published another 13 articles on the subject of postencephalitic syndromes, culminating in her 314-page thesis, published in 1922 and titled \\"Contributions √† l'√©tude des manifestations tardives de l'enc√©phalite √©pid√©mique\\". Her thesis was based on the personal study of 129 cases from the Salp√™tri√®re hospital, and contained over 700 references. It was reviewed by Eduard Feindel, who described it as rich in facts and original ideas. Her thesis was later published as a book, Les manifestations tardives de l'ench√©phalite √©pid√©mique (1925). According to her obituary, \\"her contributions to rare syndromes of this disorder have been of the highest order,\\" and her thesis in particular \\"gave her a commanding place in the neuropsychiatric world.\\"  Roussy-L√©vy syndrome  In 1926, in collaboration with her colleague Roussy, she published an article describing seven patients with hereditary areflexive dystasia, which then became known as Roussy-L√©vy syndrome. It is a disease of the peripheral nervous system, caused by a mutation in one of two myelin genes. Roussy and L√©vy published follow-up work on their first paper in 1934.  Lhermitte-L√©vy syndrome  L√©vy collaborated with Jean Lhermitte on peduncular hallucinatory syndromes. The Lhermitte-L√©vy syndrome, a progressive post-stroke paralysis, was named for their work.  Other interests  During the First World War, the Piti√©- Salp√™tri√®re Hospital became a military neurological centre. L√©vy became interested in the neurology of war, and wrote several articles on war injuries she observed in the hospital. Throughout her career, L√©vy published several articles on movement disorders, describing cases of rhythmic myoclonus of the palate muscles (also known as palatal nystagmus or palatal myoclonus), athetosis, and choreic movement disorders. According to Gustave Roussy, L√©vy's work on palatal myoclonus was particularly influential. In addition, Roussy was mainly an oncologist, so under his direction, L√©vy wrote several reviews on neuro-oncology. She collaborated with both Roussy and Simone Laborde on the use of radiotherapy for cerebral tumours.  Personal life  L√©vy had to choose between marriage and career, reportedly declining a proposal from an ophthalmologist because she did not want to abandon her work. In the obituary written by Gustave Roussy, he explains that \\"circumstances made her work, research and the exercise of her profession her raison d'√™tre\\". He further praises the numerous qualities she possessed: \\"In all her work, we find the mark of her personality: the method in the rigorous observation of the facts, the determination to pursue the analysis and the repeated verification of a sign or a lesion that may have seemed unusual or new to her, the curiosity to go back to the origins of this sign in order to find its logical and rational explanation, the patience to frequently compare what she saw with what others had noted before her, finally the taste to debate - as she liked to call them - with her contradictors, the validity of her assertions, and in this dialectic in which she excelled, she was served by a great memory and a perfect knowledge of foreign languages.\\" L√©vy died on 6 October 1934, at the age of 48, in the middle of reviewing a new article on Roussy‚ÄìL√©vy syndrome. She suffered from a severe disease of the nervous system, which she diagnosed herself, but she remained lucid until the end. Though her family believed that her death was caused by the very disease she was studying, the real cause of her death is uncertain.

The album was released on February 12, 2020 by Victor Entertainment (VIZL-1706) in Japan and JPU Records (JPU060) in Europe and North America, featuring a total of twelve songs, including the band's first double-A-side CD single ‚ÄúMasterpiece‚Äù and ‚ÄúMabataki‚Äù. The album peaked at number five on the weekly Oricon Albums Chart, Japan's music industry-standard popularity chart. This extended Scandal's streak of having all nine of their studio albums reach the top five of the Oricon chart upon release.  Background  Kiss from the Darkness is Scandal's first album on their private record label \\"her\\". Thematically, the album is meant to reflect the band's lifestyles as both a band and as individuals, and hence features the band and its members as the protagonist in several of the songs. This is a departure from their previous albums, in which the band seldom wrote about themselves. The band paid greater attention to incorporating their personal feelings of joy, sorrow and vulnerability into the album. The band decided to take an experimental approach to the album by covering more genres and by collaborating with other Japanese musicians whom they spend personal time with, so the album could better reflect their personal selves. All the songs on the album were written and composed by themselves.  Themes  \\"Tonight\\" was written while the band was on tour in 2019. Mami noted down what Haruna said to the audience during an emcee segment at one of their live performances, and turned the words into lyrics. The song is meant to depict the band's determination to continue making impactful music together. In the second volume of their \\"her\\" label magazine, it was also revealed that Mami has an interest in Buddhist sayings and deliberately included the phrase \\"tenchi kaibyaku\\", which translates to \\"creation of heaven and earth\\" into the lyrics. The song is arranged by then-16-year-old track maker Sasuke, who commented he was impressed by the band's original demo of the song and took great care not to alter its atmosphere too much. The music video was filmed in Singapore when the band visited to perform at C3 Anime Festival Asia 2019. In January 2020, the song was announced as the theme song for the Japanese drama Raise de wa Chanto Shimasu (I'll be fine in the afterlife). \\"Masterpiece\\" is the very first single the band released after starting their private record label \\"her\\". It is a fast-paced song that starts with a heavy guitar riff, and the lyrics represent the band's candid feelings on what they consider a fresh creative start to their career since starting their private label \\"her\\". In the second volume of their \\"her\\" label magazine, the band shared that when the song was still a demo, they sang gibberish in English to fill it out, until Rina picked up the word \\"Masterpiece\\" and began to pen the lyrics from there. She then described the song as having taken extraordinarily long to complete, as there were too many thoughts and feelings they were trying to capture into a single song. \\"Masterpiece\\" was used as the opening song for every live on their Fuzzy Summer Mood tour. \\"Fuzzy\\" is the first digital single and second single overall released from the album, although it had already been written during the time of their Honey album. It is an uptempo love song which literally describes a boyfriend who smokes. Rina, who wrote the lyrics, explained that the song taps on her own experience of wanting a special moment to not end, while still knowing deep down that the future is uncertain. This was further emphasized by titling the song \\"Fuzzy\\", which means \\"ambiguous\\" when translated into Japanese. In an interview, the band described the song as different and more \\"raw\\" than other love songs they had previously written. Lead guitarist Mami composed the music for all but three songs on the album. \\"Saish≈´heiki, Kimi\\", which translates to \\"you, the ultimate weapon\\", is the album's second digital single and third single overall. It was described by the band as an experimental song. Mami, who wrote the music, pictured the song with a strong western image and included pistol-like sounds at the end of the demo. When Rina heard this demo, the lyrics \\"saish≈´heiki wa kimi nan da\\" sprang to her mind immediately and she began to pen the lyrics about living life to the best of one's ability, hence becoming the \\"ultimate weapon\\". The song is one of the few Scandal songs arranged for only one guitar (played by Mami), so Haruna can experiment with a \\"wilder\\" stage presence during live shows. \\"Laundry Laundry\\" is the only song on the album written by Tomomi. It draws from her personal experience of forcing herself to adhere to her daily routine, such as eating meals and doing laundry, even when she is feeling down or frustrated. Tomomi is fond of and frequently listens to acoustic songs. While the band has often performed acoustic versions of their songs live, Tomomi wanted to make a song that had an acoustic arrangement from the start. She approached her friend, Yusuke Takeda of Radwimps, to help with the arrangement. The song uses a variety of instruments such as claves, cabaca, marimba and sleigh bells, some of which were played by Yusuke Takeda himself. Yusuke Takeda later commented that he had liked the sound of the original demo, and was excited to help shape the rest of the song. \\"Neon Town Escape\\" is the only song on the album written by Haruna, and was described by Haruna as reminiscent of the \\"90s J-pop\\" genre that she is very fond of. It was arranged by Haruna's friend, Chiaki Sat≈ç, who created the atmosphere of the song by deliberately overlaying brass and wind instruments. Chiaki Sat≈ç also recommended the brass players who play for fellow Japanese band, Lucky Tapes, to play on this song, to which Haruna readily agreed as she was a fan of Lucky Tapes as well. \\"Ceramic Blue\\" is a love song that Mami wanted to put a twist on by depicting the uneasiness and insecurities of being in love. Mami chose the word \\"ceramic\\" because she wanted something that was strong but yet could break easily to represent this insecurity. The fast pace of the song and its lyrics are meant to create a feeling of no escape. To further depict this feeling, the song immediately starts with fast singing to create the impression of breathlessness. \\"Kinenbi\\" is described by the band as the happiest song on the album. In the second volume of their \\"her\\" label magazine, the band shared that many of their friends and relatives (including Mami's older brother) got married during the time the band was putting together their album, and told the band that they had wished there was a suitable Scandal song they could have played at their weddings. So the band decided to write a celebratory song that could be used for any occasion. The song was played on their radio show, Scandal Catch Up supported by Meiji Apollo, to commemorate Haruna's thirty-second birthday. \\"Mabataki\\" is the other A-side single accompanying \\"Masterpiece\\". Rina wanted the song to capture her feminine worldview, and tasked Mami to instill an \\"80s pop\\" vibe in it. The band further emphasized this by filming at a bright, colourful European-style apartment and dressing in feminine vintage clothing for the music video. Mami deliberately included musical dissonance when writing the music, to provide contrast to the otherwise gentle mood of the song. \\"A.M.D.K.J.\\" is short for \\"amidakuji\\", a Japanese lottery game that the band members sometimes play among themselves to make decisions (such as which room they each would occupy when they used to live together, or which band member would perform which publicity activity). It is also the ending theme for the long-running anime GeGeGe no Kitar≈ç, which the band members professed to be fans of when they were children. The music video was directed by Hiroshi Usui, who wanted the video to reflect the dark theme of the anime. Rina described this song as being the band's \\"first angry song\\". It was written during a time when Rina had observed that misogynistic news and media content were being carelessly downplayed by media personalities, which frustrated her and she decided to turn this frustration into lyrics. The band wrote the song with the intention of making it a staple at their live shows, hence deliberately incorporating parts that fans could sing along with them. The song was performed live for the first time at the C3 Anime Festival Asia in Singapore in 2019. \\"Tsuki\\" is a slow ballad and the final track on the digital editions of the album. Rina, who wrote the lyrics, explained that the song was meant to describe the feeling of being able to reminisce about past memories and relationships without regret, and to being able to look forward with hope despite uncertainty of the future. To capture the feeling of a long night, Haruna deliberately dimmed the lights in her booth while she was recording during the day. She also used a handheld microphone to capture a stronger feeling of intimacy. \\"You Go Girl!\\" is the bonus track included in all CD editions of the album. In the second volume of their \\"her\\" label magazine, the band shard that when they were experiencing a creative slump, they sat each other down and had a frank conversation about how the band and their lives were going. The next day, they wrote this song and incorporated all the things that they had talked about the day before. When they started looking for a CD- only bonus track to put on the album, they decided to pick this song as they felt it would close the album on a positive note.  Release  Kiss from the Darkness was released on February 12, 2020. In addition to a regular edition, five other limited editions were also made available. Limited Edition A features a DVD with a \\"her\\" label documentary, Limited Edition B features the second volume of Scandal's \\"her\\" label magazine, the international Limited Edition from JPU Records includes English lyric translations and an English print of \\"her\\" label magazineKiss from the darkness CD and English magazine from JPU Records , DVD+T-Shirt Edition features both the \\"her\\" label documentary DVD and a T-shirt with the album art, and Vinyl Edition features the album on vinyl. The cover art for all editions was done by collage artist Q-TA. All CD editions include the bonus track \\"You Go Girl!\\". Each physical copy sold in Japan is also accompanied by a clear folder featuring one of the band members (Mami's folder can be found with copies purchased from Tower Records, Haruna's from HMV, Tomomi's from Tsutaya, and Rina's from Scandal supporting stores).

Personal life  Hughan was born circa 1760 in Burns, Kirkmabreck, Kirkcudbright, the first son of Alexander Hughan, a merchant from Creetown. His mother was Margaret Gerran. He had one brother, Alexander (died 30 March 1810). On 1 February 1810 he married Jean Milligan, eldest daughter of Robert Milligan, the slave-owner and dock promoter in part responsible for the construction of the West India Docks. He had two illegitimate daughters and one son, Thomas. Sir Arthur Henniker-Hughan was his grandson.  Career  During the late 18th century, Hughan spent 12 years in Jamaica working for the slave-trading West India Dock Company, returning to London around 1797. He continued working for the Company and was promoted to Director in 1803, and to Deputy Chairman in 1805. While residing in London, he lived at 8 Billiter Square and 12 Devonshire Place. He also served as founding member and Director of the Imperial Fire Insurance Company. Hughan served as a Member of Parliament twice, for the constituency of East Retford from 1806 to 1807, and for Dundalk from 25 July 1808 to 29 October 1811. On 27 February 1807, he used his maiden speech in the House of Commons to protest against the proposed abolition of the slave trade, stating that the bill was \\"fraught with ruin to the colonies and to the Empire\\", and that \\"there did not exist a more happy race than the slaves in our colonies\\". He voted against the bill twice but failed to defeat it, the bill passing into law as the Slave Trade Act 1807, which formally prohibited the slave trade in the British Empire. (Slavery itself was not abolished until the Slavery Abolition Act in 1833). In 1810, Hughan was called before the Bullion Committee to answer questions regarding the bullion supply in Jamaica and the excessive dividend payments of the West India Dock Company. Hughan died following a short illness on 29 October 1811, two days before his son was born.

On 2 June 2020, he transferred the entire stake to football legend Nasko Sirakov.https://www.24chasa.bg/sport/article/8651338  Controversies = Alleged abuses  The financial circles and the press have expressed doubts that Bozhkov is manipulating the minority owners by draining Nove Holding by taking out non-public subsidiaries and bonuses for himself.https://www.investor.bg/blogosfera/363/a/bojkov-se-izsmia-na-zakonite- i-kfn-106790/ On 5 January 2009, the General Meeting of Holding Roads voted for Bozhkov an additional remuneration of 3.84 million levs.https://www.investor.bg/bylgariia/5/a/osa-na-holding-pytishta-prie- premiiata-ot-384-mln-lv-za-vasil-bojkov-73738/ The Financial Supervision Commission does not report any irregularities.  Alleged links to the mafia  Bozhkov is suspected of having close ties to the SIC group. He is considered a co-owner of the Bull Ins insurance company, although the nominal owners are offshore companies and the connection is unprovable. Bull Ins took over the SIC's \\"insurance\\" structures after they did not receive a license in 1998. Bozhkov's name is mentioned in the WikiLeaks correspondence leaked to the US Embassy in Bulgaria. Together with Todor Batkov, Grisha Ganchev and the brothers Krassimir and Nikolay Marinovi, Bozhkov was given as an example \\"of some of the most famous connections\\" of Bulgarian business with organized crime. Again, according to information leaked through WikiLeaks, in 2009 the acting US ambassador to Bulgaria John Ordwick in a diplomatic letter identified Bozhkov as \\"the most infamous gangster\\" and found that Bozhkov was still active \\"in money laundering, in privatization fraud, threats, extortion, racketeering and the illegal trade in antiques. 'https://bivol.bg/wlbgcrime.html  Politics  On 8 June 2020, Bozhkov announced from his rented apartment in Dubai that he had plans to enter politics after returning to Bulgaria. He commented: ‚ÄúWe need a new political project. Power must be seized from Borisov.\\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-09/fugitive-tycoon- seeks-route-to-power-in-eu-s-most-corrupt-state He also created a Facebook poll asking his followers whether they would follow him in a political project.https://www.svobodnaevropa.bg/a/30658636.html  In fiction  The prototype of one of the characters in Lyudmila Filipova's first novel ‚Äì \\"Anatomy of Illusions\\", Boris Bukov, is Vasil Bozhkov.

While detained in Granges, Valais at Cr√™telongue Prison, he was handcuffed lying on his stomach. A police officer rested his weight onto Chukwu's back leading to Chukwu's death by \\"postural asphyxiation\\". Before authorities were able to complete an autopsy, State Councilor Jean-Ren√© Fournier, responsible for security and institutions claimed that the cause of death was a heart attack. The final autopsy results released in July 2001 confirmed asphyxiation as the cause of death. Chukwu's family filed a lawsuit against local police officials. However, a Valais court later dismissed the lawsuit citing officer ignorance of the detainment method's danger. Amnesty International used the case to urge Switzerland to reduce their program of forced deportations. The organization has also used Chukwu's death as evidence of a larger pattern of excessive force used by Swiss police, and the event lead to police reform in the country. Chukwu's death was the second case in two years of an asylum seeker being suffocated to death by Swiss authorities. While large scale public protests did not occur at the time, Chukwu's name has often been cited in subsequent Black Lives Matter protests in Switzerland.

The Comet radial was fairly standard with steel finned cylinders, cast light alloy cylinder heads and two valves per head. The valves are operated by a single rocker arms and push-rods, to the rear of the cylinder, which are in turn operated positively by inner and outer cam tracks operating rollers on the pushrod. Oil pumps and magnetos are driven by the camshaft drives as well as the Heywood air starter and tachometer. The two-piece crankshaft, with counter-weights, is carefully forged from heat-treated chrome-vanadium alloy steel and drilled for lightness and lubricating oil flow.

Mosaic of the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, VI century Women in the Byzantine Empire played an important role, but many details of their lives are a matter of debate. Numerous sources (chronicles, legal texts, hagiographic literature) paint a picture of the Byzantine patriarchal society in which women did not have independent significance and were imprisoned in a gynaeceum. For a long time, the attention of historians was attracted only by prominent Byzantine women, mainly the Empress, especially the wife of Emperor Justinian I Theodora, who had a significant influence on the events of the first half of the VI century. The scientific study of the legal and economic status of women in the Byzantine Empire began in the second half of the 19th century and is currently intensively ongoing. The subject of study is both women in general and related issues of family and property law. The scarcity of surviving sources leads to diverse assessments of the place of women in Byzantine society. With the development of gender studies in the 1970s, there is a tendency to revise early views, according to which this role was not significant.  Sexuality = Ascetic ideal of a woman  According to Judith Herrin, sexuality in the Byzantine Empire was saturated with hypocritical double standards, as in any other medieval society. On the one hand, men appreciated female charm and resorted to the services of prostitutes and mistresses, on the other hand, demanded moral purity from their relatives. Moreover, in Byzantium, the Christian church played a huge role, whose ideas about the relationship of the sexes were formed in the period Early Christianity. Christianity has inherited beliefs from Classical antiquity that women are physically and morally weaker than men, more prone to the needs and desires of their bodies, and therefore less able to understand what is good, and if they understand, to adhere to it. Finally with rare exceptions, Byzantine literature was created by men and reflects their views. Until the 12th century, in the Byzantine Empire there was no erotic literature and erotic art in general, and the subject of expression of feelings was the attitude of ascetic to God, which implied the complete elimination of sexuality.. According to the general idea, a woman was responsible for the desire arising to her in a man, and even for a monk, the best way was not to look at women. There was no general consensus on whether disgusting sexual desire is always dangerous. Some Christian authors of the 4th century agreed that the desire was given by God for the purpose of procreation, and a married person can lead a Christian life no less than one who adheres to celibacy. Some believed that a chaste man and woman could live in the same house without risk to their souls, however, the practical experience of ascetics indicated that sexual desire was almost impossible to contain. In this sense, even a mother or sister could become a reminder to the ascetic of all the other women and the rejected worldly life in general. In this regard, for an ascetic woman, it was necessary to abandon an attractive appearance, wear clothes hiding the figure, and abandon her social status. The washing was condemned, as it once again attracted attention to the rejected body.  Prostitution  Dancing Miriam, miniature from Khludov Psalter, mid-9th century The prostitutes were at the bottom of the social ladder and were known by a variety of names - hetairai, ‚Äúpublic women‚Äù, ‚Äú(women) from the attic¬ª (). They are more known from hagiographic literature (where they appear under the designation \\"humiliated¬ª () or ‚Äúmiserable¬ª ()) or in civil or church law attempting to limit this phenomenon. Probably, prostitution has always been prevalent in Byzantium. However the word referred not only to communication with prostitutes, but to many other deviations from the recommended sexual behavior. Prostitution flourished in capital and the largest cities of the empire - Alexandria, Antioch, Beirut and Edessa, later in Thessaloniki and ports of Asia Minor. Engaging in this activity was relatively voluntary when the daughters of actors or artisans were seduced by tales spread by the brothel holders () about the luxurious life of getters; also prostitutes could become slaves and prisoners. Mistresses of brothels also went to the provinces to find suitable girls, buying them in poor families. However, such transactions were illegal, and the found father of the family was deprived of parental rights and could be sent as a punishment to the mines; for the members of the Church, the punishment was excommunication. But, obviously, these measures were applied without much success, and at least in the 12th century, prostitution was not only voluntary. Attempts to limit prostitution geographically were also futile even in Constantinople - founded even under Constantine the Great Lupanar was empty, and under the emperor Theophilos (829-843) the building was transferred to the hospital. Women whose activities involved trading of their bodies also included mime artists, performers on flute, and singers at weddings or banquets. According to the Byzantines, engaging in secular art is not befitting an honest man, and women of these professions were considered prostitutes of a separate kind. The lower class prostitutes were considered to be maidservants in taverns and xenodochiums, about which, according to the tradition dating from ancient times, it was believed that they should satisfy all the needs of the guests.. A frequent topos of Byzantine hagiographic literature was the spiritual degeneration of the ‚Äúharlot,\\" who, repenting, \\"acquired holiness for herself.\\" So, for example, this happened with a saint of the V century Pelagia of Antioch or a saint of the VI century Mary of Egypt. According to the suggestion of Judith Herrin, the mother of Constantine the Great Saint Helena was a prostitute in the tavern.  Political participation  Regarding the participation of women in the political life of the Byzantine Empire, there are two main points of view. According to one of them, women were isolated from the rest of society in a gynaeceum. In this case, historians refer to the relevant statements of Michael Psellos, Kekaumenos and Michael Attaleiates. Another points of view, more common at the present time, is that the isolation of women in the sources does not reflect the real state of affairs, but the ideal idea of Byzantine men. Since the 12th century, numerous examples of the opposite have been known. Talking about how her mother accompanied Alexios I on campaigns, Anna Komnene speaks not only about how she took care of the emperor‚Äôs sore legs, but also was his adviser, who helped identify the conspirators. According to the writer, ‚Äúthese were the reasons that overpowered the natural shame of this woman and gave her the courage to appear before the eyes of men‚ÄùAnna Komnene, Alexiad, XII, 3. The wife of Emperor John VI, Irene Asanina, ruled the city of Didymoteicho during the absence of her husband during the second civil war (1341‚Äì1347). Their daughter Maria ruled the fortress of Enez a few years later, in place of her husband Nikephoros, who was the Despotate of Epirus. According to A. Laiu, the role of Byzantine women in the political life of the country was significant in the late period of its history in connection with the consolidation of the aristocracy, whose position became dominant. Within this ruling class, women were important because they possessed significant property and had influence over their children. The importance of family ties in the Komnenos period was noted by the Soviet-American Byzantinist Alexander Kazhdan.

Her four page A Voz Feminina caused international comment with its advocacy of increased women's rights and O Progresso was said to be the first feminist newspaper in Europe. Life Wood was born in Lisbon in 1802 and she spent over twenty years in Britain. She married and returned to Portugal where she and her husband created two titles. Wood is remembered for editing the weekly periodical, A Voz Feminina, for two years. The journal title changed to O Progresso. The four page periodical called for women's suffrage in Portugal caused consternation in conservative England as it reacted to the petition raised by Barbara Leigh Smith Bodichon and presented by John Stuart Mill to the British Parliament in 1866. The periodical was presented as a \\"‚Äòa hermaphrodite paper\\" creating comment in the Atheneum, the Bern Journal and the Victoria Magazine. A much later source cites O Progresso as the first feminist newspaper in Europe. Her first publication carried the strap line, a mulher livre ao lado do homem livre (the free woman beside the free man) whilst the second wanted Justice at any cost. Wood was one of the first women in Portugal who were concerned with women's subordinate status and in particular about improving the educational opportunities for Women in Portugal together with Carolina Micha√´lis de Vasconcelos, Maria Carvalho, Alice Pestana, Alice Moderno, Angelina Vidal, Ant√≥nia Pusich and Guiomar Torrez√£o.

In 2019 the Financial Times named her as one of 100 most influential Black, Asian and minority ethnic leaders in technology.  Early life and education  Broni-Mensah is the eldest of four children, born to Ghanaian parents who worked in finance. Her brother is Edwin Broni-Mensah, the founder of the charity GiveMeTap. She was raised in Edmonton, London, and found a passion for mathematics and music. At the age of 5, Broni-Mensah experienced prejudice at primary school, \\"I was met with shrills from other children during playtime, who couldn't contemplate the idea of playing with a black girl\\". In secondary school she was repeatedly denied access to higher level maths classes despite achieving the highest grades in the intermediate class. Broni-Mensah credits the actions of her parents, who escalated this issue to the headmistress, for enabling her to move classes. Between 2000-2003 Broni-Mensah studied mathematical economics at the University of Birmingham, and continued her love of music by working for the radio station Burn FM as a breakfast DJ and drive-time DJ. She took on a role for Sony music and Relentless Records to promote events and artists on campus. She was inspired by P. Diddy and his route into music through taking on a College Marketing Rep position for Columbia Records. Her initial contact with Sony was to cold-call \\"a random number I found on Google\\".  Career  Broni-Mensah worked for UBS Investment Bank as a junior trader after university, where she found the day-to-day work lacking in excitement. In interviews, Broni-Mensah reflects on the pressure she felt to pursue a technical degree as her mother \\"wasn't too keen on me doing something like media studies\\". In hindsight, she has no regrets on her career journey despite having to work a second job in her spare time as a manager of a hip-hop artist and event organiser. She took this longer route into the media business because she felt that there was not enough support, such as financial backing, for inner city young adults born to immigrant parents to take risks.  Shoobs  Broni-Mensah was inspired to start Shoobs after spending many days searching for events for a night out, but found many events, especially those held on a regular basis, required tickets to be purchased in-person, or only advertised using flyers. In particular, she found promotion of black music events lacking. She began working on Shoobs as a solo founder in 2010 - at the time, Shoobs was the only black entertainment event ticketing site in the UK.. Shoobs is a slang term for party. The vision for Shoobs is to \\"build a community of people who come to us to figure out how to spend their Friday and Saturday nights‚Äù. Broni-Mensah secured funding from the Bright Ideas Trust owned by Tim Campbell, the first winner of the UK TV programme The Apprentice, using the fund to create the first version of the online platform. She would then win the Shell LiveWIRE Grand Idea award in 2010. In 2014 Broni-Mensah left London to join Y Combinator, a startup accelerator where she received support from Geoff Ralston and Aaron Harris. She became the first Black female entrepreneur to secure capital from a Silicon Valley seed fund. In 2014 Shoobs had 1027 organisers signed up, with more than 100,000 tickets sold in 2013. In 2018 Broni-Mensah was interviewed by the BBC as part of their series CEO Secrets. In 2019 the Evening Standard interviewed Broni-Mensah as part of their Women Tech Charge series. She is the alumnus of the Ernst and Young Winning Women Programme and the Morgan Stanley Innovation Lab in New York. On the subject of the advantages or disadvantages of being a female founder, Broni-Mensah comments \\"I am a solo non-technical first-time female founder from London, so it is difficult to pinpoint which one of those attributes has been the most disadvantageous!\\". On the subject of racism in the music industry, Broni-Mensah has spoken out about the treatment of black event organisers and attendees, having witnessed for example, the actions of bouncers who disproportionally turn away black men from events. Broni-Mensah has plans to internationalise Shoobs into African markets following the growth of African music such as Afrobeats and Afroswing into the UK and across the world. In contrast with early concerns that this market would be niche, Broni- Mensah states \\"Often when you are doing something really groundbreaking you‚Äôve got to be ahead of the curve and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôve done at Shoobs so it‚Äôs great to see how well Urban is being received now.'  Awards  In 2019 Broni-Mensah was named in the Financial Times and Inclusive Boards list as one of the 100 most influential black, Asian and minority ethnic leaders in technology. Broni-Mensah was recognised as one of Britain's most influential Black people under 40 by Powerful Media.

It is intended to work as a replacement for the original : a) for certain subjects (for whom?) : b) within a certain time range (when?) : c) restricted to certain conceptual or physical actions (what for?).

It took place on July 18, 2020 at the Skyway Studios in Nashville, Tennessee. It was the sixteenth event under the Slammiversary chronology. Seven matches were contested at the event. In the main event, Eddie Edwards defeated Ace Austin, Trey, Eric Young, and Rich Swann (the last two being unannounced participants) in a five-way elimination match to win the vacant Impact World Championship. In other prominent matches, Chris Bey defeated Willie Mack to win the Impact X Division Championship, and Deonna Purrazzo defeated Jordynne Grace by submission to capture the Impact Knockouts Championship.  Production = Background  On the June 2, 2020 episode of Impact!, it was announced that Slammiversary would take place on July 18, 2020. It took take place at Skyway Studios in Nashville, Tennessee, where all Impact! tapings have been recorded since Rebellion due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  Storylines  The event will feature professional wrestling matches that involves different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that build tension and culminate in a wrestling match or series of matches. At night two of Rebellion, Tessa Blanchard was due to defend the Impact World Championship against Michael Elgin and Eddie Edwards in a three-way intergender match. However, due to Blanchard and Edwards being stuck in lockdowns in Mexico and Massachusetts respectively as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the match was unable to take place, and Elgin faced Moose and Hernandez in a three-way match instead, which Moose won. On the May 5 episode of Impact!, it was announced that an eight-man tournament would take place to determine the number one contender for the Impact World Championship. Ace Austin won the tournament during the June 2 episode of Impact! after defeating Wentz, who stood in for Trey after he was attacked before the match, in the tournament final. However, on the following week's episode, it was announced that Blanchard would defend her title against Elgin, Edwards, Austin and Trey in a five-way intergender match at Slammiversary. On June 22, 2020, Impact Wrestling released a statement announcing that alongside the termination of Dave Crist and Joey Ryan's contracts with the promotion, that Elgin had been suspended indefinitely pending a further investigation into allegations of sexual assault made against him. On June 26, Impact released a second statement announcing that Elgin had also had his contract terminated with the promotion as a result of the allegations. Twenty-four hours earlier, Impact released yet another statement announcing that it had also terminated Blanchard's contract with the promotion and stripped her of the Impact World Championship, ending her reign as world champion at 165 days and also removing her from the match. On the June 30 edition of Impact!, it was announced that Austin, Edwards, Trey, and a mystery opponent will face each other in a four-way match for the vacant title at Slammiversary. On the June 9 edition of Impact!, Deonna Purrazzo made her return to the company, attacking Knockouts Champion Jordynne Grace after Grace successfully defended the championship against Taya Valkyrie. The following week, Purrazzo interrupted Grace's backstage interview and once again attacked her. On June 23 episode of Impact!, it was announced that Grace would defend the championship against Purrazzo at Slammiversary. On Night 1 of Rebellion, Willie Mack defeated Ace Austin to win the X Division Championship, whereas the following week on Night 2, rising star Chris Bey won an X Division four- way match involving Rohit Raju, Suicide, and Trey. After the match, Bey went backstage to state that he deserved to be the #1 contender to the X Division Championship; a match he would get on the May 5 edition of Impact! in a three- way match also involving Austin, but Mack retained the title. Two weeks later on May 19th, Mack retained the title by defeating Johnny Swinger, after Swinger was told by Bey the previous week that Mack was saying things behind his back. However, after the match, Bey came out and assisted Swinger in a beatdown of Mack. The two eventually formed a team, that Swinger called \\"The Finesse and Bench Press Express\\"; though it was mostly as a way to get Bey to another X Division title shot. On the June 23 edition of Impact!, Bey, Swinger, and Raju defeated Mack and The Deaners (Cody and Cousin Jake) in a six-man tag team match after Bey pinned Mack. Two days later, Impact announced that Mack would defend the X Division Championship against Bey at Slammiversary, with Swinger banned from ringside. On June 29, Impact Wrestling announced a Knockouts gauntlet match for Slammiversary, with the winner becoming the #1 contender to the Knockouts Championship. Rosemary, Nevaeh, Susie, Kiera Hogan, Taya Valkyrie, Tasha Steelz, Alisha Edwards, Kylie Rae, Kimber Lee and Havok were announced to compete in the match. On the July 7 edition of Impact!, former TNA Knockouts Champion Madison Rayne announced during an episode of her chat show, \\"Locker Room Talk\\", that she would be returning to the ring to also compete in the gauntlet match. On the March 17 edition of Impact!, Sami Callihan returned to Impact Wrestling as the mysterious ICU hacker, and launched a fireball into the face of Impact Hall of Fame-designate Ken Shamrock. The feud would culminate at Rebellion Night 1 in an unsanctioned match, where Shamrock submitted Callihan to an ankle lock. Several weeks later on May 12, Shamrock appeared on \\"Locker Room Talk\\" with Madison Rayne and Johnny Swinger, only to be attacked by Michael Elgin, taking him out of the World Championship #1 contender's tournament; whereas the following week, Elgin defeated a noticeably limping Callihan in the first round. The two kept their issues with Elgin going, from Sami distracting him in his semi-final tournament match with Trey, to an in-ring promo between Elgin and Shamrock, and a three-way match won by Elgin. On those same weeks, The North (Josh Alexander and Ethan Page) had defended the World Tag Team Championships in Canada against questionable challengers, including against Cody Deaner and Wheels Deaner at the Deaner Compound. They eventually returned on the June 16 Impact! to defeat The Rascalz (Dez and Wentz) in a title match. Unfortunately, no one was watching backstage, and were instead watching Ken Shamrock's Greatest Hits on Impact Plus. The next week, Page went on about people watching Shamrock instead of them, leading to Shamrock challenging Alexander to a match that night. However, The North would attack Shamrock before he even got in the ring. The following week, The North came to address their assault, only for Shamrock to come out looking for a fight. He was eventually joined by Sami Callihan, fighting off The North alongside his rival before disappearing into the night. EVP Scott D'Amore, looking to appease to an irate Ethan Page, scheduled a tag team title match between The North and the team of Shamrock and Callihan for Slammiversary. At Night 2 of Rebellion 2020, Moose interrupted Michael Elgin while wearing the old TNA World Heavyweight Championship. Defeating Elgin and Hernandez in three-way match, Moose would proclaim himself TNA World Heavyweight Champion, doing everything to make sure everyone knew it, from pulling out of the Impact World Championship #1 Contender's Tournament, to defending the title against TNA Originals. He defended it against Hernandez, Suicide twice, and Crazzy Steve. After the match with Steve, Tommy Dreamer came down to check on the injured challenger, but Moose attacked Dreamer. Once Dreamer recovered from the assault, he cut a promo on Moose, claiming that he \\"lacked the passion and drive for his profession, despite having the God-given natural talent\\". He went on to criticize him for creating a title for himself because he couldn't win any, (despite Moose winning the now-defunct Impact Grand Championship twice), and stated that he would be \\"a footnote in both the National Football League and professional wrestling\\" and calling him \\"a waste of talent\\". Moose responded by calling Dreamer's comments slanderous and defaming of his character, threatening to sue him and the company unless he was given an apology. The next week, Dreamer formally gave Moose a written apology, albeit wth some backhanded remarks that poked at Moose's delusional behavior. Moose would interrupt him, but then told Dreamer that the \\"TNA Championship Committee\\" proclaimed him the #1 contender to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. After the confrontation, Impact announced that Dreamer and Moose would face each other for the TNA World Heavyweight title at Slammiversary in an Old School Rules match. On April 16, WWE announced that several of their talent, both on-air and recruits, as well as much backstage personnel, were released from their contracts. On June 1, Impact Wrestling released a video on their YouTube channel to promote Slammiversary, featuring a hooded figure drinking and watching the news being broken about said people being released while flashing images of both former Impact and WWE wrestlers, teasing the returns of some of them, including at least one former World Champion. Many names were teased, including the reunion of Team Canada with Michael Elgin, Heath Slater, D'Lo Brown reuniting Aces & Eights, Luke Gallows & Karl Anderson, and Super Eric. At the end of the July 7 edition of Impact!, it was revealed that the former World Champion wouldn't be alone, before ending the vignette with three hands grabbing glasses of alcohol. On July 18, 2020, Gallows and Anderson announced that they had signed two-year contracts with Impact Wrestling and would be appearing at Slammiversary.

The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1974. It is now owned by Esbjerg Municipality. History Three small houses at the site were destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1795. A new building was constructed in 1796-97 for barber Lars Hansen T√∏yring. It was heightened by his heirs in 1845. The composer Hans Christian Lumbye was a resident in the building in 1848. The politician Hans Egede Schack was among the residents ten years later. Ph. L. Nathan opened Kj√∏benhavns Manufaktur- og Kl√¶deoplag in the late 1890s and lived in one of the apartments on the second floor. The Danish Women's Society and Danish Women's Council were later among the tenants. The building was in 1924 acquired by the coffee wholesaler Anton Linnet. He converted the ground floor into a coffe outlet the following year. He purchased the adjacent building at Studiestr√¶de 47 in 1935 two years later also the one at Vester Voldgade 21. The coffee company and associated buildings were later handed down to his son Palle Linnet. Linnet's coffe shop closed in 1976. The building was sold to aktieselskabet Rafiki, in 1979. The new owner converted it into nine condominiums. All nine apartments were in 1997 sold to Esbjerg Municipality. Architecture The building seen from Vester Voldgade The building consists of four floors and a Mansard roof over a cellar. The Mansard roof is clad with zinc on the lower part and red tiles on the upper part. The facades towards both Vester Voldgade and Studiestr√¶de are five bays wide and meet in a canted corner bay. The wider, outer bay on each side of the building is placed in a corner risalit. The corner window on the first floor is topped by a rounded pediment. Between the ground floor and the first floor runs a frieze featuring a Greek key. The former main entrance towards Vester Voldgade was converted into a display window in 1925. The year of the conversion is inscribed in sandstone relief numbers above the window. A gate topped by a fanlight is located in the corner risalit towards Studiestr√¶de. Today The building is still owned by Rsbjerg Municipality and the apartments are used by employees with business in Copenhagen. The ground floor houses a bar.

From 1962 he was a professor at the University of Amsterdam. His model for the development of a phobia was published posthumously. Barendregt argued that a phobia arises from what he called \\"it\\", an acute attack of depersonalization, in which the phobia has a survival function; the \\"foothold is found in fear, which is preferable to emptiness.\\" In retrospect by Jaap van Heerden, Barendregt is called 'a walking paradox', because he became the personification of the method struggle that was going on at the time between the hermeneutics of psychoanalysts and psychotherapists, and the methodological approach of experimental psychologists and psychometricians. He blamed the first group for not being able to test their findings. However, according to Barendregt, the methodologists paid too little attention to the individual. Chess career Barendregt became obsessed with chess at the age of 13 and proved in 1937 that a chess problem in The Chess World was incorrect. He four time played in the Dutch Chess Championship. In 1961 he finished third in the Blast Furnace chess tournament, behind Bruno Parma and Francesco Scafarelli. He was awarded the title of FIDE International Master (IM) in 1962. In 1966 he defeated Mikhail Botvinnik at the IBM international chess tournament. He is mentioned in My 60 Memorable Games (1969) by Bobby Fischer in connection with the Ruy Lopez Exchange Variation, a line in which he made important theoretical contributions.

Biography = From Birth to Promotion to Colonel  Born and raised in Sardinia, Luigi Efisio Marras began his career in 1906 when he began his training at the Military Academy of Turin. After graduating, he served as an officer in various artillery departments. He would later take part in the Italo-Turkish War and was particularly involved in the occupation of the Dodecanese. During the First World War he fought in the Balkans against the troops of the Central Powers and after the war, he returned home to work in the operations department of the Italian General Staff. From 1926, he was serving in a field artillery regiment stationed in Livorno and at the same time was a teacher at the local Military Academy. In 1931 he was promoted to colonel and from 1936 he was given command of a heavy artillery regiment.  His Actions as Military Attach√© to Germany and Later Life  In October 1936, Marras was chosen for the delicate task of being a military attach√© in Berlin. In this capacity, he was responsible for the North European area and for relations with the Baltic states. Marras, who soon became known for his courteous nature, also wrote numerous reports on the German armaments situation, paying particular attention to the Wehrmacht and the training of personnel in the war academies. He gave an unusually accurate picture of the German war effort in terms of practical and pragmatic training, but also on human aspects and weaknesses such as pride and arrogance. From July to November 1939, he was active in Rome and Libya and then transferred back to Berlin. After the 8th of September in 1943, he was promoted to lieutenant general and then interned in Germany. On the 31st of March 1944, the German authorities handed him over to the fascists of the Republic of Sal√≤ in northern Italy and since then he was imprisoned in Verona then Gavi and finally in Alexandria, but in August of that same year, he managed to escape to Switzerland. From May 1945, he was at the head of the Territorial Military Command of Milan and from the 1st of December 1947 he became Chief of Staff and from the 2nd of December 1950 he was Chief of the Defence Staff, contributing significantly to the reconstruction of the Italian Army after the war. He retired from active service on the 15th of April 1954 would die in Rome in 1991.  References  * Sergio Pelagalli: Il Generale Efisio Marras - Addetto Militare uno Berlino (1936-1943).

The Belorussky suburban railway line connects Moscow with the stations in the west, in particular, with the towns of Odintsovo, Golitsyno, Zvenigorod, Kubinka, and Mozhaysk. The stations the line serves are located in Moscow, as well as in Odintsovo, Ruza, and Mozhaysk in Moscow Oblast. Some of the suburban trains have their eastern terminus at Moscow Belorussky railway station in Moscow, others commute from the Savyolovsky suburban railway line. In the western direction, the suburban trains terminate at Usovo, Odintsovo, Golitsyno, Zvenigorod, Kubinka I, Dorokhovo, Mozhaysk, and Borodino. The line is operated by Moscow Railway. The tracks between Moscow Belorussky railway station and Odintsovo are also used by Line D1, one of the Moscow Central Diameters, and by the service to Sheremetyevo International Airport, provided by Aeroexpress. The suburban railway line follows the railway which connects Moscow with Smolensk and Minsk. It is electrified everywhere. Between Moscow and Odintsovo, there are four tracks, west of Odintsovo there are two tracks. The distance between Moscow Belorussky railway station and Borodino is . History The railway connecting Moscow and Smolensk was constructed in 1859 and opened in 1870. It was first known as Moscow ‚Äî Smolensk railway, and since November 1871, when it was extended to Brest, as Moscow ‚Äî Brest railway. The section between Moscow and Kuntsevo (which then was a separate town, currently Kuntsevskaya railway station) was electrified in November 1943. The electrification was extended to Setun in 1944, Odintsovo in 1947, Golitsyno in 1949, Zvenigorod in 1950, Usovo in 1957, Mozhaysk in 1958, and Borodino in 1959. The whole track to the border with Belarus and further is electrified, and the suburban service technically could be extended to Smolensk. However, direct suburban trains from Moscow to Gagarin and Vyazma were discontinued in 2015. On 21 November 2019 Moscow Central Diameters started operation. Simultaneously, a direct connection to the Kursky suburban railway line was closed for passenger traffic.

A defence district (, Fo) was an administrative division of the Swedish Armed Forces, and was a lower regional level subdivision, usually corresponding to a Swedish county. The commander of a defence district was the Defence District Commander, who usually commanded local defence units, including infantry, engineers, air defence and light artillery, as well as any Home Guard units in the district. The commander answered to the larger military district that the defence district was part of. History A defence district was the lowest regional unit in the Swedish Armed Forces. Such were found in particularly important coastal areas during World War I and from 1939 on at a time of mobilization. From 1943 they were included as part of the ordinary peace organization. The district was responsible for defence planning, home defence, supervision of fixed facilities, certain territorial units and the Home Guard equipment and equipment. In 1973-76, the defence districts were amalgamated with regiments into defence district regiments (f√∂rsvarsomr√•desregementen) (except Fo 67, which remained independent), but in the early 1990s some independent defence districts again were formed. These latter districts were disbanded as a result of the Defence Act of 1996. The locations of the defence districts are often indicated by their names.

The annual event attracts up to 20,000 visitors and over 100 stalls annually. Festivities The fair lasts seven days and begins on a Tuesday in mid-May, when a mixture of local music and entertainment combined with traditional craft demonstrations and workshops is held. A parade takes place and hosts many participants and local groups before a soapbox derby race commences, with a fireworks finale. Other events include family fun activities, amusements, street performers, local movies, tea dance, shows and much more. History The fair was traditionally held on a Tuesday in late May but in the nineteenth century such was the demand for horses that the Monday was given over to this sale. Representatives of cavalry regiments from all over Europe came to buy as the reputation of the fair spread. Local farmers also needed horses to plough and transport their produce, while the nearby city of Belfast sought carriage horses and sturdy animals to pull carts. The great days of the horse fair ended with the First World War and the growth of mechanisation. In 1948, a committee of local people came together to revive the May Fair. It was to grow in the following years to become a week long festival which began with the Mayor's Parade. More features were added each year with a fancy dress parade and floats on the opening Saturday and a pipe band contest adding a colourful ending to the week. By the late 1950s the local newspapers were reporting that the fair was attracting 20,000 people to the town. By the 1970s, the fair was suspended for several years during the worst years of the Troubles. The 2020 fair was cancelled by Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was announced that almost ¬£60k was lost due to the cancellation.

Constructed in 1913 for A. F. J. van Hattum, it is a replica of the Eremitageslottet hunting lodge in the Jaegersborg Dyrehave in Denmark. It was inhabited until the mid-1980s, when it became offices. Since 2000, it has been owned by speculator Ronnie van de Putte, known as the \\"Slum King of the Netherlands\\" (Krottenkoning van Nederland). He refuses to renovate the building, despite its monumental status. Heritage groups warned the local municipality in the late 2010s that the villa was severely dilapidated and it was placed on a list of the fourteen most threatened monuments in Europe. It is currently the subject of an intense dispute over emergency renovations and was squatted in 2018, by people wanting to carry out essential repairs. The house, the formal garden, the gate and the playhouse are all national monuments.  History  Huize Ivicke stands at Rust en Vreugdlaan 2, adjacent to the Rijksstraatweg (N44) which runs between The Hague and Wassenaar. It was constructed in 1913 by architect G. J. van der Mark. The owner was A. F. J. van Hattum, who bought the plot from Princess Marie of the Netherlands and planned to give the villa to his Danish wife Xenia Maria Pousette as a present. The house is a replica of the Eremitageslottet hunting lodge which was used by Danish royalty in the J√¶gersborg Dyrehave park near to Copenhagen. Huize Ivicke is a national monument (rijksmonument), as are the wooden playhouse constructed behind it for the couple's children, the ornate metal gate and the formal garden. alt=Danish building in the snow Pousette died in the house at the age of 33, in 1922. Van Hattum remarried with Leoni Hubertina Anna Maria van Zweden and himself died in 1961. Van Zweden then sold the house to the wife of Paul Huet, a banker, and the Huets were the last people to live in Huize Ivicke. By the mid-1980s, it had been converted into office space. Huize Ivicke was sold in 2000 to Muntendamsche Investerings Maatschappij, which is run by Bever Holding.  Decline  In 2017, two groups dedicated to protecting monumental buildings sounded the alarm because Huize Ivicke was becoming dangerously dilapidated. Stichting het Cuypersgenootschap and Erfgoedvereniging Heemschut asked the local municipality to write to Bever Holding, a real estate company which is notorious for allowing properties to decay, to ensure that the building was protected against rain damage and would not experience further destruction. Heemschut later nominated the building as one of the fourteen most threatened heritage monuments in Europe. After being listed as one of the fourteen, it was then proposed by Europa Nostra as one of the seven most endangered monuments in 2020. It was not listed and a representative of Heemschut commented \\"It's a shame of course but we understand the choice of the buildings that are on the list\\".  Dispute  Huize Ivicke, protests (2020) The major shareholder in Bever Holding is Ronnie van de Putte, a well-known speculator and real estate investor who is known as the \\"Slum King of the Netherlands\\" (Krottenkoning van Nederland), as a result of his policy of buying buildings then leaving them to decay or even demolishing them and decades later selling the land parcel for a profit. The municipality of Noordwijk issued a fine of 200,000 euros to the company for not restoring two buildings, a restaurant called De Vuurtoren and a villa called De Vier Winden. After being fined, Bever demolished both places. In Leiden, Bever had for years owned a plot of land with two buildings on it next to the central train station. One building was demolished in 1993 and the entire site stood derelict until 2010, when the municipality paid Bever 17.9 million euros for the plot, having failed to expropriate it. Van de Putte also bought a monumental former school called Het Hoompje in Sluis, which he has left empty since 1992. He is able to do this because local councils only have limited rights to interfere with a privately owned building. Huize Ivicke was occupied by squatters in July 2018, who were willing to carry out emergency repairs on the building to prevent water damage. The squatters stated that they were doing what the owner should have already been doing. In Dutch squatting culture it is common for buildings to be occupied in order to preserve them. Most squatting actions are to provide housing, but buildings are also occupied for political or entrepreneurial reasons. The local municipality ordered Ronnie van de Putte to repair the building in November 2019 and required him to make it wind- and waterproof within a month. Since he did not do that, a contractor was employed by the municipality in January 2020. According to the squatters, the contractor did a shoddy job, simply nailing plastic sheets to the leaking dormer windows and even creating new problems. The following month, van de Putte had still not begun the essential works, claiming that he was unable to do so because the building was squatted. The municipality did not agree with him. Since van de Putte has never applied for any permissions or permits, it is unlikely a judge would evict the squatters since there is no reason to do so under Dutch law. In January, the building had been sold twice with van de Putte ending up as the owner. The municipality was concerned that by these manoeuvres van de Putte was attempting to evade paying for the necessary renovations. By March 2020, the province of South Holland had offered to help fund the renovation costs, which it estimated to be around 500,000 euros. The municipality was still struggling to make van de Putte pay for the restoration himself and the province said if the was not possible it would make a contribution. The squatters stated \\"we stand against this abuse of public funds for a project that does not meet the criteria set by Zuid-Holland's own monument restoration policy, where there is no guarantee the money could be recouped, and which does not guard against a new cycle of neglect and decay\\".

Following his arrest for the murder of Irina Vakhrusheva, he was connected to previous crimes and sentenced to life imprisonment. Early life Little is known about Falkin's early life. Born in Yekaterinburg, he served in the army before finding a job as a firefighter for the Ministry of Emergency Situations. He was married, had two children and was perceived as an ordinary family man by those who knew him. Crimes Between October 2004 to April 2017, Falkin assaulted six women and two underage girls in the Nizhneserginsky District, Yekaterinburg's Ordzhonikidzevsky City District and in Verkhnyaya Pyshma. From these attacks, three of the victims died from their injuries: a 20-year-old in 2004, a 43-year-old in 2014 and a 30-year-old in 2017. No details on their killings are available at present. In 2012, two significant events occurred on unspecified dates: in the first instance, Falkin tried to kill a woman using a screwdriver, but the victim's frightened screams drew the attention of two men, causing Alexey to flee. In the second case, near the end of the year, Falkin picked up a hitchhiking young teacher from Beryozovsky in his car, agreeing to drive her to her home in exchange for 400 rubles. After offering to have sex with her to pay for the fair, since he believed the woman didn't have the necessary amount of money on her, and after his advances were refused, Alexey slammed her head into the car window, dragged her into the back seat and raped her. Six months later, he was arrested for the crime, but since he expressed apparent remorse, he was given a meager 3.5 years sentence. Following his arrest, he lost his job and his family abandoned him. After spending two years behind bars, he was paroled. Not long after, Falkin found himself a new girlfriend and got a job as a turner at a factory, but continued to prowl the city in search of new victims. Murder of Irina Vakhrusheva On April 15, 2017, at about 8:25 PM, the highly intoxicated Falkin was driving around in Verkhnyaya Pyshma in his Dacia Logan. While passing by Mashinostroiteley Street, he came across 31-year-old Irina Vakhrusheva, who had gone out to visit a friend at a neighboring house. Acting on impulse, Falkin attacked her while she was talking on the phone, grabbing Vakhrusheva by the neck and holding up a knife to it, draggin her to a nearby abandoned basement, where he proceeded to violate her on the stairs. Then, using a knife, he stabbed her at least 40 times in the head, neck, elbows, torso and legs. After he was finished, he put the bloodied corpse in the trunk of his car, drove out to a nearby forest and proceeded to cut off the genitals from the body, which he put in a bag, before burying it in a shallow grave. Falkin then disposed of the bag and the knife, washed off his clothes, went home and directly went to sleep. Arrest, trial and imprisonment After Irina failed to arrive at her friend's house or return home, her husband alerted the authorities. Nearly all residents from the area went out to search for any trace of the missing woman, scouring through backyards, porches, parks, manholes and attics. One day after the search, drops of blood were found on one of the basement stairs. When witnesses were interrogated, they testified to seeing an unfamiliar man driving a Dacia Logan in the area. After examining all of the known owners of such cars, investigators arrived at the doorstep of Alexey Falkin. Upon closer inspection, blood spots were found in his car. Caught red-handed, Alexey immediately admitted to all of his crimes and offered to help locate Vakhrusheva's burial site, but claimed to be mentally ill and unable to control his urges. At trial, he said before the court: These claims of insanity were scrutinized heavily by outraged citizens, who signed a petition to apply the death sentence for Falkin, which would eventually be signed . In this petition, the authors expressed concern that Falkin was faking his mental illness to avoid punishment, citing as evidence his steady jobs prior to his conviction, and the fact that a few years prior, he had successfully sued his employer in court. He was later examined by Professor Alexander Thostov, from the Department of Neuro and Pathopsychology of the Moscow State University, and he ascertained that Falkin was sane. In 2018, in two separate trials, Alexey Falkin was convicted and sentenced to two terms of life imprisonment. A year later, authorities successfully connected him to three additional sexual assaulted, committed in February and July 2006, and in August 2012. For these crimes, he was given another 20 years imprisonment, to be run consecutively with his other sentences. Authorities have publicly stated that if Falkin is responsible for any crimes, they would be outside Sverdlovsk Oblast.

He was an early devotee of stereophonic recording, and wrote enthusiastically about it in Gramophone and other publications. His Gramophone colleague Martin Cullingford recalled: During the 1960s many local authorities in Britain set up lending libraries of LPs, and March was called in to advise many of them. His wide knowledge of the range and varying quality of the available recorded repertoire led him to found The Stereo Record Guide, co- written with Edward Greenfield and Denis Stevens. He later came to an agreement with Penguin Books, and from 1975 to 2012 March and his colleagues wrote 29 volumes of Penguin guides to recorded classical music.\\"Ivan March ‚Äì Penguin Guide\\", WorldCat.

Born in Lohr am Main, N√§tscher completed an apprenticeship as a butcher in W√ºrzburg, which was interrupted by serving in the military from 1915 to 1918. He joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and the Central Union of Butchers in 1914, and in 1920 was elected as chair of the union branch. He rose quickly in the union, becoming the secretary for its Northern Bavaria region, then moved to Nuremberg to work full-time for the union at its headquarters. When the union merged into the Union of Food and Drink Workers, he retained his position. The Nazi government banned trade unions in May 1933, and N√§tscher was arrested, and was in custody for most of the next three years. In 1939, he was drafted into the Wehrmacht, but managed to get himself released the following year, and found work as a gravedigger. After World War II, N√§tscher was involved in reconstructing the unions. In 1946, he became chair of a consumer co-operative in Nuremberg-F√ºrth, then in 1947 he became the first chair of the executive of the Bavarian Food, Beverages and Catering Union. In 1949, this merged with other regional unions to become the national Food, Beverages and Catering Union (NGG), and N√§tscher served as the chair of its executive. In this post, he was highly critical of president Ferdinand Warnecke, who wished to centralise the union. In 1951, N√§tscher was elected as president of the NGG, in which role he campaigned for the union to be politically active, and in particular to oppose right-wing extremism. In 1958, he was also elected as president of the International Union of Food, Drinks and Tobacco Workers' Associations (IUF), the first German to hold the post. He retired from the NGG in 1962, and the IUF in 1964, although he was then made honorary president of the IUF, and continued voluntary work for the NGG.

The Militia had always been important in the county, which was vulnerable to invasion, and from its formal creation in 1758 the regiment served in home defence in all of Britain's major wars, later as a reserve battalion for the Devonshire Regiment. It was disbanded in 1908. Background The universal obligation to military service in the Shire levy was long established in England and its legal basis was updated by two Acts of 1557, which placed selected men, the 'Trained Bands', under the command of Lords Lieutenant appointed by the monarch. This is seen as the starting date for the organised county militia in England. The Devon Trained Bands were divided into three 'Divisions' (East, North and South), which were called out in the Armada year of 1588.Hay, pp. 11‚Äì17, 25‚Äì6, 88.Hay, pp. 269‚Äì71.Walrond, pp. 1‚Äì17. Although control of the militia was one of the areas of dispute between King Charles I and Parliament that led to the First English Civil War, most of the county Trained Bands played little part in the fighting. After the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 the militia of Devon were called out on a number of occasions when the appearance of hostile fleets caused alarm, and in 1685 they prevented the rebel Duke of Monmouth from accessing recruits and supplies from Devon and Cornwall. After the Battle of Sedgemoor the Devon Militia were active in rounding up rebels.Hay, pp. 99‚Äì104.Scott.Walrond, pp. 23‚Äì4. The Devonshire Militia continued to be mustered for training during the reign of William III, the six 'county' regiments together with the Exeter and Plymouth regiments and several Troops of Horse, mustering 6163 men.Hay, pp. 116‚Äì7. But after the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 the militia was allowed to dwindle.Western, p. 73.Walrond, pp. 25‚Äì7. South Devon Militia=Seven Years War Under threat of French invasion during the Seven Years' War a series of Militia Acts from 1757 re-established county militia regiments, the men being conscripted by means of parish ballots (paid substitutes were permitted) to serve for three years. Front-line Devonshire was given a quota of 1600 men to raise. There was a property qualification for officers, who were commissioned by the Lord Lieutenant. The size of the militia was increased as the war continued.Fortescue, Vol II, pp. 288, 299, 301‚Äì2, 521.Hay, pp. 136‚Äì44.Holmes, pp. 94‚Äì100.'Militia and Volunteer Lists' at Devon ‚Äì Military History.Walrond, pp. 28‚Äì31.Western, Appendices A & B.Western, p. 251. The first issue of arms to the Devon Militia was made on 5 December 1758, and they were embodied for permanent service on 23 June 1759. Two, later four (Exeter, North, East and South), battalions were formed in Devon under the command of the Duke of Bedford as Lord Lieutenant. They served in the West Country for the whole of their service; the duties included guarding French prisoners of war. In December 1762 the battalions were stood down ('disembodied') and the following year were reorganised into three peacetime regiments: the 1st or East, 2nd or North and 3rd or South Devon Militia. The South Regiment consisted of 500 men organised in eight companies commanded by Colonel Sir John Rogers, 3rd Baronet, who had raised the regiment in 1758.Frederick, p. 86.H.G. Parkyn, 'English Militia Regiments 1757‚Äì1935: Their Badges and Buttons', Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, Vol 15, No 60 (Winter 1936), pp. 216‚Äì248.Walrond, pp. 31‚Äì55.Western, p. 124. War of American Independence The militiamen's peacetime training was widely neglected, but the Devonshire regiments do appear to have completed their training each year. After the outbreak of the War of American Independence in 1775 Lord North's government introduced a Bill in Parliament to 'Enable His Majesty to call out and assemble the Militia in all cases of Rebellion in any part of the Dominion belonging to the Crown of Great Britain'; the Bill was passed in December 1775.Walrond, pp. 59‚Äì65. The militia was called out when Britain was threatened with invasion by the Americans' allies, France and Spain, and the regiment was embodied at Plymouth on 26 March 1778. During the summers the militia went into camp where they were exercised as part of a division alongside Regular Army troops. In 1782 the South Devons were at Roborough near Plymouth where all three Devon regiments were gathered. The South Devon were in 1st Brigade alongside the 75th Foot and the Carmarthen and Worcester Militia regiments. The Light Companies of the regiments at Roborough were formed into a composite Light Battalion, which trained separately. The Militia also had to find guards for the American prisoners of war lodged in Mill Prison. The camp at Roborough was broken up on 10 November 1782 and the regiments went into winter quarters. American independence was recognised in November 1782, and peace was settled with France and Spain early in 1783, so the militia could be stood down. The South Devons were disembodied on 3 March.Walrond, pp. 66, 99‚Äì100, 105, 107.Fortescue, Vol III, pp. 173‚Äì4. French Revolutionary War From 1787 to 1793 the South Devon Militia was assembled at Plymouth for its annual 28 days' training, but to save money only two-thirds of the men were mustered each year. In view of the worsening international situation the whole Devonshire Militia was embodied for service on 22 December 1792, even though Revolutionary France did not declare war on Britain until 1 February 1793.Fortescue, Vol III, pp. 530‚Äì1.Walrond, pp. 112‚Äì5. The militia were frequently moved around the country but in the winter of 1795‚Äì6 all three Devon regiments were at Plymouth guarding the fortifications and the French prisoners of war.Walrond, pp. 140‚Äì1. In March 1798 the standing militia regiments were reinforced by men from the newly-raised Supplementary Militia, the remainder forming new regiments (such as the 4th Devon Militia formed at Exeter).Walrond, pp. 153‚Äì5. The South Devon regiment volunteered for service in Ireland and was stationed there during the Rebellion of 1798‚Äì99. In 1799 an Act was passed to allow militiamen to transfer to the Regular Army. This caused a dispute between the Colonel of the South Devons, Lord Rolle, who opposed the legislation, and his second-in-command, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir William Elford, Member of Parliament for Plymouth, who had voted for it and had obtained around 50 volunteers from the regiment. In November 1799 the Militia was partially disembodied, two-fifths of the men being stood down together with the whole of the Supplementary Militia. The hope was that the men dismissed from service would enlist in the Regulars. The militia's traditional local defence duties had been taken over by the Volunteers. Although he remained colonel, Lord Rolle was no longer serving with the regiment, and was concerned with raising the Beer and Seaton Volunteers, which he offered to help the 1st Devon Militia in putting down rioting in Plymouth in 1801. The militiamen disembodied in 1799 were called up again.Walrond, pp. 167‚Äì77, 189‚Äì97. However, a peace treaty having been agreed (the Treaty of Amiens), the Militia could be stood down, the South Devon being disembodied on 24 April 1802. Napoleonic Wars The Peace of Amiens did not last long, and the Militia were soon called out again. The warrant to embody the Devon and Exeter Militia was sent to the Lord Lieutenant (Earl Fortescue) on 11 March 1803, and the South Devons were duly embodied on 31 March 1803. All three Devon regiments assembled at Plymouth, where they trained alongside the Regulars, with particular emphasis on the Light Companies, and six chosen men from each of the other companies trained as marksmen alongside the Light Companies.Walrond, pp. 204‚Äì7. Rewards were posted on 1 August 1803 for the apprehension 23 men who had not rejoined the regiment and were listed as deserters, though a number were believed to be serving on naval warships, in the Regular Army or working in London or Newfoundland.Trewman's Exeter Flying Post, 25 August 1803, quoted at Devon ‚Äì Military History. Once again the militiamen were encouraged to volunteer for the Regular Army (or the Royal Marines, in the case of men from Devon and Cornwall), and by 1805 Lord Rolle was complaining that, his South Devons being the weakest, men should be transferred into it from the other Devon regiments, but this was rejected. An Act to augment the militia was passed in 1807 by which 1134 additional men were to be raised in Devon and distributed to the three regiments. Lord Rolle successfully argued for the three to be made up to equal strength, which meant his regiment receiving men from East Devon, some of whom refused to serve in the South Devons. This led to a long and angry correspondence between the three colonels and the Lord Lieutenant.Knight, p. 238.Walrond, pp. 230, 243‚Äì6. In 1809 another recruitment drive for men to transfer to the Line regiments was accompanied by balloting to bring the Militia up to strength, and the regiments were allowed to obtain recruits 'by beat of drum' (as in regiments of the Line) and by volunteers from the Local Militia, which had replaced the Volunteer Corps. This led to a resumption of the correspondence between the colonels in 1810, and Lord Rolle and the officers of the South Devons threatened to resign.Walrond, Appendix C.Walrond, pp. 254‚Äì7, 261‚Äì3. In 1812 there was an outbreak of Luddite machine-breaking in the industrial Midlands and the regiment was part of the force employed in suppressing the Luddite Riots, operating in the Nottingham area. It was officially thanked for its service by the commander. In the summer of 1813 the South Devons rejoined the Plymouth garrison, but the regiment was detached in camp on Dartmoor; it moved into the city for winter quarters.Walrond, pp. 288‚Äì92. By now the war was over, the Treaty of Fontainebleau having been signed in April 1814. Plymouth was busy with militia regiments returning from Ireland to be disembodied, and returning British prisoners of war. On 16 June the warrant for disembodying the Devonshire Militia was signed and the regiment completed the process by 9 August.Walrond, pp. 296‚Äì301. Waterloo campaign Napoleon's escape from Elba and return to power in France in 1815 meant that the Militia had to be called out once more. The regiments began recruiting for volunteers 'by beat of drum' from 25 April and the warrant for embodying the Devonshire Militia was issued on 16 June, with the South Devon to be embodied at Plymouth on 17 July. By then the decisive Battle of Waterloo had already been fought, but the process of embodiment went on while the Regulars were away in the Army of Occupation in France. The South Devon Militia was disembodied on 8 February 1816.Walrond, pp. 302‚Äì3, 308. Long Peace In 1817 an Act was passed that allowed the annual training of the Militia to be dispensed with. So although officers continued to be commissioned into the regiment and the ballot was regularly held, the selected men were rarely mustered for drill. The regiment assembled at Plymouth for 28 days' drill in 1820, and for 21 days the following year. Training was held again in 1825 at Exeter, when rewards were offered for 31 men who had failed to appear and were listed as deserters.Trewman's Exeter Flying Post, 4 August 1825, quoted at Devon ‚Äì Military History.Walrond, pp. 311‚Äì7. Training was held in 1831, but not again before 1852, and the ballot lapsed. The permanent staff of a militia regiment in 1819 was reduced to the adjutant, paymaster and surgeon, sergeant-major and drum-major, and one sergeant and corporal for every 40 men and one drummer for every two companies plus the flank companies, but these were progressively reduced so that by 1835 there were only the adjutant, sergeant-major and six sergeants, while the other long-serving men were pensioned off. (In 1834 an inspecting officer had found all the sergeants unfit for service).Walrond, Appendix A.Hart's.Walrond, pp. 317‚Äì28. 2nd Devon Militia The Militia of the United Kingdom was reformed by the Militia Act of 1852, enacted during a period of international tension. As before, units were raised and administered on a county basis, and filled by voluntary enlistment (although conscription by means of the Militia Ballot might be used if the counties failed to meet their quotas). Training was for 56 days on enlistment, then for 21‚Äì28 days per year, during which the men received full army pay. The permanent staff was increased. Under the Act, Militia units could be embodied by Royal Proclamation for full-time home defence service in three circumstances:Dunlop, pp. 42‚Äì5.Grierson, pp. 12, 27‚Äì8.Hay, pp. 155‚Äì6.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 91‚Äì2, 162‚Äì3.Walrond, pp. 329‚Äì30. * 1. 'Whenever a state of war exists between Her Majesty and any foreign power'. * 2. 'In all cases of invasion or upon imminent danger thereof'. * 3. 'In all cases of rebellion or insurrection'. Under the Act, the militia establishment for Devon was fixed at two regiments of infantry and one of artillery. The North Devon Militia were converted to artillery in 1853 and the Plymouth regiment dropped the 'South Devon' title and took their place as the 2nd Devon Militia.Army List, various dates.Walrond, pp. 331‚Äì3. Crimean War and Indian Mutiny War having broken out with Russia in 1854 and an expeditionary force sent to the Crimea, the Militia were called out for home defence. The 2nd Devon Militia was embodied from 31 May 1854 to 10 June 1856. Unlike the other Devon units, the regiment was also embodied from 9 November 1857 to 14 May 1858 during the Indian mutiny. Thereafter the militia carried out their annual training regularly. Reforms Under the 'Localisation of the Forces' scheme introduced by the Cardwell Reforms of 1872, Militia regiments were grouped into county brigades with their local Regular and Volunteer Force battalions. For the 2nd Devon Regiment this was Brigade No 34 (County of Devon) in Western District alongside the 11th Foot, the 1st Devon Militia and the Exeter and South Devon Volunteers. The Militia were now controlled by the War Office rather than their county Lord Lieutenant, and officers' commissions were signed by the Queen.Hay, pp. 27, 158.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 195‚Äì6.Spiers, Late Victorian Army, pp. 4, 15, 19.Walrond, p. 372. A mobilisation scheme began to appear in the Army List from December 1875. This assigned to Militia units places in an order of battle serving with Regular units in an 'Active Army' and a 'Garrison Army'. The 1st and 2nd Devon Militia were both assigned to the Garrison Army in the Plymouth defences. Devonshire Regiment The badge of the Devonshire Regiment, adopted by the whole regiment in 1883. The Childers Reforms of 1881 took Cardwell's reforms further, and the Militia regiments became integral parts of their Regular county regiment, with the 11th Foot becoming the Devonshire Regiment of two battalions and the two Devon Militia regiments becoming the 3rd and 4th battalions. This caused some confusion: because there had been no established order of precedence, when Militia regiments were brigaded together they had traditionally drawn lots for precedence in that year's camp; this became an annual ballot between the counties. Then in 1833 individual regiments were balloted for a permanent order of precedence and this list was continued in 1855: the East Devons were drawn as No 41, the South Devons as No 25. Normally this only affected matters such as positions on the parade ground, but when the militia became numbered battalions it meant that the former South Devons (now the 2nd) became the 3rd Battalion, (2nd Devon Militia) Devonshire Regiment by virtue of their higher precedence, while the 1st Devons became the 4th Battalion (1st Devon Militia).W.Y. Baldry, 'Order of Precedence of Militia Regiments', Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, Vol 15, No 57 (Spring 1936), pp. 5‚Äì16.Walrond, pp. 322, 384. Training was now more realistic, often carried out at annual camps, but there was a falling-off in recruitment and the Devon Militia regiments were each reduced by two companies in 1876, and by a further two, to a total of six, in 1890.Walrond, pp. 379, 401. Second Boer War With the bulk of the Regular Army serving in South Africa during the Second Boer War, the Militia were called out. The 3rd Battalion was embodied from 4 December 1899 to 20 October 1900. Disbandment After the Boer War, the future of the Militia was called into question. There were moves to reform the Auxiliary Forces (Militia, Yeomanry and Volunteers) to take their place in the six Army Corps proposed by St John Brodrick as Secretary of State for War. However, little of Brodrick's scheme was carried out.Dunlop, pp. 131‚Äì40, 158-62.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 243‚Äì2, 254. Under the sweeping Haldane Reforms of 1908, the Militia was replaced by the Special Reserve, a semi- professional force whose role was to provide reinforcement drafts for Regular units serving overseas in wartime (similar to the Militia Reserve of 1867).Dunlop, pp. 270‚Äì2.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 275‚Äì7. Under these changes, the 3rd (2nd Devon Militia) Battalion was disbanded on 15 July 1908, and the 4th (1st Devon Militia) became the 3rd (Reserve) Battalion, Devonshire Regiment on 1 April 1908. Commanders=Colonels * Sir John Rogers, 3rd Baronet, raised the regiment in 1758 and resigned in 1765.Walrond, pp. 32, 54, 60. * John Rolle, 1st Baron Rolle, the longest-serving colonel, who held the command when the regiment went to Ireland in 1798 and retained it until his death in 1842, despite his disagreements with the Lord Lieutenant and the other militia colonels, and his also being concerned with raising the Beer and Seaton Volunteers and the Royal North Devon Yeomanry.Walrond, pp. 169‚Äì71, 230, 244‚Äì6, 261‚Äì3. * Edmund Parker, 2nd Earl of Morley, appointed 8 January 1845, whose father had commanded the North Devon Militia during the Napoleonic Wars.Walrond, p. 230. Lieutenant-Colonels The appointment of colonel was abolished in the reorganisation of 1852, and militia regiments were commanded by lieutenant-colonels thereafter: * John Yarde-Buller, 1st Baron Churston, who had served as lt-col under the Earl of Morley. * The Hon John Buller Yarde-Buller, son of Lord Churston, served under his command and then succeeded him in command; died in 1867.Army List, various dates. * John N.

Honorary Colonel The following served as Honorary Colonel of the regiment: * Rt Hon Charles Seale-Hayne, MP, former CO, appointed 10 October 1894.London Gazette, 9 October 1894. * Francis Mountsteven, former CO, continued with the 3rd Bn in the TFLondon Gazette, 27 November 1908. Uniforms and insignia The uniform of the South Devon Militia in 1778 was red with dark green facings; in 1800 the facings were yellow, and in 1814 they were white. The badge from about 1800 to 1881 was a lion rampant (derived from the coat of arms of the early Earls of Devon) within a garter inscribed with the regimental title. In 1883 the whole of the Devonshire Regiment adopted the castle badge of the former 1st Devon Militia.Walrond, p. 387. NotesReferences * Col John K.

Mair is a British chemist and a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Chemistry at The University of Manchester. His research is based on synthetic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, catalysis and polymer chemistry.  Education  Mair completed his Bachelor of Science degree in applied chemistry in 1988 at University of Strathclyde, where he investigated on borane cluster synthesis for his undergraduate research project. He continued to read for his Doctor of Philosophy degree at University of Strathclyde on Synthesis and Bonding Studies on Icosahedral Borane and Carborane Anions for Neutron Capture Therapy \\" and successfully completed it in 1991.  Research and career  Mair worked as a research fellow at Queens from 1992 - 1993 where he worked on s-block coordination chemistry. He then moved to Trinity College Dublin as a lecturer where he worked on Œ≤-diketiminate ligands and s-block chemistry and in 1996 joined the Department of Chemistry at the University of Manchester as a lecturer in inorganic chemistry and later on was promoted to the position of senior lecturer. Mair's research is based on synthetic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, catalysis and polymer chemistry, specifically in the area of ligand Design, inorganic synthesis and polymerization catalysis. Apart from research and lecturing, Mair has also worked at the RSC, Manchester as the District Local Section Science Chair in 2017. He also works in many chemistry based outreach activities, including the flash-bang show as well as in the Salters festival.  Notable work  In 2015, Dr. Mair led a research to investigate the behaviour of Œ≤-triketimine cobalt complexes in the polymerization of isoprene, and upon confirmation of the capability to use such complexes in polymerization, led a further research in 2016 on the use of enamine‚Äìdiimine cobalt complexes in isoprene polymerization. Both these researches indicated the potential to replace the use of more expensive neodymium complexes as a catalyst in the rubber industry, and also confirmed that the use of the cobalt complexes enhanced the polymerization rate of isoprene by 10 times, however also indicated issues including chances of cross-linking leading to gelation. In general, the capability to replace the highly demanded Neodymium based catalysts was observed in this research, and it also confirmed the potential to replace it with cobalt and even more cheaper and abundant iron which may eventually help to reduce the cost of rubber production in the future. In 1999, Dr. Mair led a research on a new supramolecular packing motif where he showed how the structure of N,N‚Ä≤,N‚Ä≥-tris(2-methoxyethyl)benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide consists of aryl rings self-assembled using a organized œÄ-stack surrounded by a triple helical network of hydrogen bonds confirming a new mode of organization for columnar liquid crystals. In 1998, Dr. Mair also reported the first synthesis and use of the ligand, Dipp-NacNac as a N,N - bidentate anionic ligand, which is now currently one of the major alternatives that is available instead of common bulky ligands, including Cp*, and [RC(NR‚Äò)2]‚àí (R = Me, Ph; R‚Äò = Me3Si).

Premise The twins Daria (Margherita Morchio) and Mauro Raina (Federico Russo) return to their mother's eerie small hometown, Curon in Northern Italy. Seventeen years ago, their mother Anna Raina (Valeria Bilello) fled the town, pregnant with the twins, after her own mother's tragic death. The three arrive at the family hotel, which has been closed ever since. After a cold welcome, it becomes apparent that no one wants Anna and her kids back in town, not even Anna's own father, Thomas (Luca Lionello). In fact, the twins do not want to stay either, they are eager to move back to their home in Milan. After some troubles on their first school day, Daria befriends the teacher's daughter Micki Asper (Juju Di Domenico) and they kiss after a late-night party by the town's lake. When Micki's brother, Giulio (Giulio Brizzi) hears the rumors that his sister could be a lesbian, he cannot believe this and confronts Daria and Micki. On the other hand, Micki's and Giulio's father, Albert Asper (Alessandro Tedeschi) also seems to have some unresolved history with Anna Raina. Meanwhile, Micki struggles with the rejection from her former friend group and the trust breach of her former best friend Lukas (Luca Castellano). Daria and Mauro discover that Anna had returned because of an incessant nightmare about the circumstances of her mother's death. In the nightmare, Anna saw someone, who looked identical to her, shoot her mother and then turn to point the gun at her. Everything leads them to the town's lake. The day Anna disappears, the twins begin searching for her and after going through a few troubling events, they finally solve the mystery of their grandmother's death and uncover the secret surrounding the town's lake.

Reception  Curon received generally positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the first season holds a 71% rating based on 7 reviews, with an average score of 6.5/10. Melissa Camacho of Common Sense Media gave the show 3 out of 5 stars, stating: \\"Curon is a decent pick for anyone looking for a solid supernatural teen drama, but will leave you feeling disappointed if you want something more spine-chilling.\\" Joe Keller of Decider.com wrote: \\"Curon has its issues, but the two teen leads and their polar-opposites dynamic is compelling enough for us to keep watching.\\" Ronak Kotecha of The Times of India gave it 3.5 out of 5 stars, saying: \\"The show establishes its context very clearly right from the beginning and hooks you as the 17-year-old twins Daria and Mauro begin their life in Curon. Their first day at school and all the subsequent scenes are quite refreshing as they focus on the skewed relationship between the teenagers ... Also, the show concurrently explores relationships among the youngsters, who make new friends and foes and among the adults, who share a mysterious past. The makers blend it well with the show‚Äôs suspenseful narrative that focuses on the curse of Curon. Its core idea of discovering one‚Äôs true self is told in a supernatural way, which is only believable if you can digest a heavy dose of suspended reality.\\" NotesReferencesExternal links * * Category:2020 Italian television series debuts Category:2020s Italian television series ","title":"Curon"},{"id":"64234699","text":"Peren Government College, is a general degree college in Peren, Nagaland.

A woman falls asleep under a tree and is impregnated by a spirit that dwells in the tree. The boy child is named for Moses because, like Moses, his father is not known.

A second Hira comes, and a diviner says that the monster can only be killed by a female elephant--who is disguised as the chief's girlfriend. She transforms and becomes a female Hira, falls asleep near a pond, and when the Hira comes to drink at the pond he begins licking her. She pulls four hairs from his tail and gives them to Moussa; the next day, all Moussa has to do is show the Hira his own hairs for the monster to lie down and be killed.

The main source for the hero are the epics collected by M. A. Dupuis Yakouba at the start of the twentieth century.Belcher, African Myths, 21, 459. Moussa's origin is mythical, and his father, like Moses unknown. He is born of a woman who falls asleep under a tree and is impregnated by a spirit that dwells in the tree. The boy child is named for Moses because, like Moses, his father is not known. A local leader, Kuruyore, sees in him the future leader of their people but they don't believe him, and Moussa is bullied by the other children. Finally, he goes to his mother, who in turn sends him to the tree where his spirit-father teaches him hunting magic. Kuruyore takes off his cap and offers it to the young man; while he refuses the cap, his expertise and leadership are clear, but he accepts his position as chief on the condition that none of the people will eat cooked food in the bush. His greatest heroic feat, performed while still young, was to defeat the mythical monster the Hira.Belcher, African Myths, 21-22.

Name Sabla Wangel Hailu is frequently confused with her 16th-century ancestor, Empress Sabla Wangel, whom the modern people of Gojjam also believe to have been connected to their region. To differentiate the two famous women, people refer to the earlier queen as Sabla Wangel 'Teleq' (the great) or 'Kedamawit' (the first), while the modern Sabla Wangel is referred to with the suffixes 'Hailu', derived from her father's name, 'Dagmawit' (the second), or 'Tinishi' (the little). Biography Sabla Wangel Hailu was born the daughter of Hailu Tekle Haymanot, the ruler of Gojjam, and Askale Mariam Mengesha. Marriage to Lij Iyasu At the age of 14, she was selected by the Emperor of Ethiopia, Menelik II, to marry his presumptive heir, Lij Iyasu. The marriage was an alliance between the throne and a powerful Christan family, as well as an attempt to reduce the political influence of Menelik's wife Itege Taytu, as Sabla Wangel had no links to Taytu's family. She was the first of Ras Mengesha's descendents to marry a designated heir to the throne, the second being Medferiashwork Abebe. As Lij Iyasu's first, brief marriage to Romane Werq was probably unconsummated, Sabla Wangel may have been his only official wife. Sabla Wangel had one daughter with Iyasu, named Alem Tsahai Iyasu. The pair divorced in 1916. Later life Sabla Wangel's paternal grandfather, Tekle Haymanot of Gojjam, had rebuilt a church at M√§ng…ô≈õt√§ S√§mayat in 1887. In 1956, Sabla Wangel restored this church once more. The church's founding was associated with the 16th century queen of Lebna Dengel, also called Sabla Wangel.

Early life and education  Prescod was born in Barbados and emigrated to the United States in 1962 as a teenager. Within her first two weeks of moving to the United States she was on a picket line, protesting against a medical centre in Brooklyn that would not employ Black people. Prescod attended Long Island University for her undergraduate studies. She started a course at the Teachers College, Columbia University, but left to work in remedial teaching for adults. Prescod became increasingly active in the civil rights movement.  Career  In the early 1970s Prescod started to focus her activism on initiatives that looked to improve the welfare of mothers. At the time she was working as a school teacher in New York City. She became involved with the United Nations, and was part of the series of conferences that were part of the Decade for Women. She launched the International Black Women for Wages for Housework programme with Wilmette Brown. in 1975.

Description  While only known from partial remains, enough has been found of Pterosphenus to suggest it was a large reptile over 4 metres.

Palaeoenvironment and Palaeoecology  A marine ocean dweller, Pterosphenus lived in the shallow seas of the future eastern US, such as Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arkansas, up north to New Jersey. Pterosphenus was a top predator of the ecosystem, likely preying on fish and molluscs found in the same area. It is certain that Pterosphenus would have encountered basal cetaceans of the time like Zygorhiza, Dorudon, and Basilosaurus, though its likely a mixed of niche partitioning and living in different areas in the case of Basilosaurus (which lived in estuary ecosystems according to recent finds) would prevent competition between the species.

His work on using graph theory for data mining was featured in the PBS series Life by the Numbers. In 1997 Dean received the Bell Labs President's Silver Award, and shortly thereafter began a professorship at Rice University. While at Rice, he supervised four Ph.D. students with thesis topics ranging from algorithmic graph theory to biological computing. On January 11, 2001, Dean was elected Vice President of the National Association of Mathematicians (NAM). In 2003 he moved from Rice University to Texas Southern University, where he attained the rank of full professor and would serve as chair of the mathematics department. Dean's departure from Texas Southern University to Texas State University was announced in a NAM newsletter in 2006.

However, they were still able to use the honorific abroad and von Ripper continued to do so.), known as 'Rip' or 'Jack the Ripper', was an Austrian-born American surrealist painter and illustrator, soldier and Office of Strategic Services agent.  Life = Early life  Rudolph von Ripper was born in 1905 in Cluj, at the time in Austria-Hungary and now in Romania. He was the son of an Austrian baron and general who was the last aide de camp to Charles I of Austria. After his father's death and the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire, he ran away from home and worked in various jobs including as a coal miner and a circus clown, before studying art at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf.  Paris and the French Foreign Legion  He then moved to Paris, where in 1925, aged 19, he joined the French Foreign Legion. He served in the Legion for two years, being deployed against the Great Syrian Revolt, where he was wounded in action. Mopsa von Ripper in 1933  Berlin, Shanghai and Mallorca  He then deserted the legion, and moved to Berlin, before traveling to Shanghai in 1928 as a filmmaker. On his return to Berlin in 1928, von Ripper began a relationship with stage designer . Sternheim was also in love with surrealist writer Ren√© Crevel, who also had feelings for von Ripper, and for a time there was a plan for a m√©nage √† trois; however, this did not come about, and Sternheim and von Ripper married on 17 December 1929. The couple settled in Berlin, where they were part of the decadent Weimar culture of the city in the early 1930s. However, at some point during the 1930s the couple separated and Sternheim began seeing other men and women. Around 1933, von Ripper traveled to Mallorca, where he produced anti-fascist drawings to the commission of the German resistance. KZ Oranienburg, 1933  Concentration camp  In October 1933, von Ripper returned via Paris to Berlin, now under Nazi rule, bringing with him copies of the 'Braunbuch', an anti-Nazi publication written by German left-wing groups in exile and published in Paris. He was taken to the office of Gestapo chief Rudolf Diels, and accused of high treason for his production of anti-Nazi cartoons and possession of anti-Nazi pamphlets. He was imprisoned and tortured for some months in Oranienburg concentration camp, until in 1934 he managed to get a message to Austrian Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss, who intervened to have him released, with a requirement to leave all Nazi-held territories.  Return to Mallorca and Spanish Civil War  He returned, via Amsterdam and Paris, to Mallorca, where he created a series of pieces entitled Ecrasez l'infame (To Crush Tyranny), a reference to Voltaire. These were published in Paris in a limited edition in 1938. In October 1935, fourteen of his pieces under the title \\"Kaleidoscope\\" were exhibited at the Tooth Gallery in London, and according to the New York Times \\"created a sensation in the art world\\". The German ambassador asked that the show be censored, but British authorities refused. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, in which General Francisco Franco's coup was supported by troops from Nazi Germany, von Ripper joined the Republican Army, with the specific aim of fighting the Germans. In 1937, he was serving as an aerial gunner in the Spanish Republican Air Force when his plane was shot down and his left leg riddled with metal from a shell. He was told by doctors that his leg would have to be amputated, but left before they could do so.  Move to the United States, Time and Fortune magazines  In 1938, his health too damaged to fight further, he traveled to New York City, where he settled for a while in Greenwich Village and he held exhibitions at the A.C.A and Bignou galleries. He then earned a residency at the Yaddo artists' community, before moving to New Canaan, Connecticut where he established an art studio in a century-old barn. In January 1939, Time used von Ripper's picture captioned 'From the unholy organist, a hymn of hate', from Ecrasez l'infame, on the front cover of the issue which named Adolf Hitler as 1938's Man of the Year. The issue also contained a profile of von Ripper and his art, under the heading 'Art: Enemy of the State'. Another picture by von Ripper, depicting Nikolaus von Falkenhorst, was used on the cover of Time magazine on May 13, 1930. In 1939, he produced illustrations for Norman Corwin's book Seems Radio is Here to Stay. During this period his art also began to appear in Fortune magazine. In 1941, Rudolph and Mopsa were officially expelled from the German Empire.Michael Hepp (Hrsg.): Die Ausb√ºrgerung deutscher Staatsangeh√∂riger 1933-45 nach den im Reichsanzeiger ver√∂ffentlichten Listen.

Meanwhile, he painted propaganda posters intended for distribution abroad for the Office of War Information. Eventually, on September 5, 1942, he was admitted to the United States Army for 'limited service only' due to his wounds, and initially served as a hospital laboratory technician. On the formation of the Corps of Engineers War Art Unit, he transferred to that unit and in 1943 sent to North Africa as an Artist Correspondent alongside Mitchell Siporin. In 1943, he became a United States citizen. He worked alongside Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ernie Pyle, who in his 1944 book Brave Men wrote: The Army Artist Unit was dissolved in May 1943, and von Ripper transferred to the Intelligence Section to interrogate prisoners. He was assigned to the 34th Infantry Division, with whom he took part in the Invasion of Italy. In Italy, he served as acting intelligence officer of the 2nd Battalion of the 168th Infantry Regiment. He also led patrols against Nazi positions, either with squads of soldiers or alone. For actions in these sorties he was awarded a Silver Star and oak leaf cluster, and on December 12 1943 was promoted to second lieutenant, which fellow artist Sergeant Mitchell Siporin described as 'a battlefield appointment about which much should be said'. He also received a Purple Heart with oak leaf cluster and a Division Citation. In a later sortie, he was ambushed and wounded in his right hand, left leg and face by machine gun bullets. He was taken to Naples to recover, where he continued to work on paintings based on his front line sketches. He became sufficiently known for his audacity when leading patrols that his division forbade him going on patrol without specific permission. In December 1943, his art was included in The Army at War, a War Department exhibition of combat art. Writing in the catalog for the exhibition, von Ripper wrote: In February 1944 he returned to the front lines and was involved in the Battle of Monte Cassino. His exploits drew the attention of Office of Strategic Services (OSS) director William J. Donovan, and he was recruited for its Secret Intelligence Branch. He parachuted into Austria early in 1945 to organize resistance and inform the OSS about the situation. After the war ended, von Ripper was involved in finding Gestapo and Nazi officials hiding in Austria.  After the war  He left the OSS in late 1945 with the rank of Captain, though some commentators suggest he continued as an operative for the Central Intelligence Agency. His final official evaluation form assessed him as \\"Outstanding in fieldwork but too restless for staff work\\". He returned to Europe in 1946 and taught at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna. Around this time he obtained a divorce from Mopsa, and married art critic Evelyn Leege, with whom he returned to his pre-war home in Connecticut. He earned two Guggenheim Fellowships for fine art painting, in 1945 and 1947. In 1947, a portfolio of thirty of von Ripper's etchings was published in New York in 200 numbered editions, under the title \\"With the 34th Infantry Division in Italy\\" with a foreword from Major General Charles W. Ryder. In 1950, Rudolph and Evelyn moved to a villa called Ca'n Cueg near Pollen√ßa on Mallorca, despite the island still being under the Francoist regime that von Ripper had fought against in the 1930s. In 1960, returning from a four-month trip, von Ripper was arrested by Spanish police and charged with smuggling. His wartime comrade C. L. Sulzberger, who had cautioned him against returning to Mallorca, believed that this might be the Spanish regime seeking revenge against him.  Death  On July 9 1960, while on bail awaiting trial, von Ripper stepped outside the villa. He was found dead the following morning by Evelyn, with his death recorded as being from a heart attack, though some commentators including biographer Sian Mackay have considered the death suspicious. His obituary in the New York Times was headed, \\"Rudolf von Ripper, Artist, Dies; War Hero Served With O. S. S.\\". In the 1990s, workers clearing out the Ca'n Cueg villa found a large number of papers and sketches belonging to von Ripper, which formed the basis of Sian Mackay's book Von Ripper‚Äôs Odyssey: War, Resistance, Art and Love.

He was the twelfth African-American to earn a Ph.D. in mathematics, which he received from the University of Michigan. Living in the era of racial segregation in the United States, Ellis taught at historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) including Fort Valley State University in Georgia and Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1948 he became the first black faculty member at Oberlin College, where he worked for 19 years before eventually moving back to the University of Michigan. Ellis was active in promoting mathematical education in the United States and abroad, and in 1966 he was honored by the government of Peru for his efforts. At the University of Michigan, he was Associate Dean of the Graduate School and Professor of Mathematics until his retirement in 1977. Upon his retirement, he was named Professor Emeritus. Afterwards he served in various administrative positions including vice chancellor of academic affairs at University of Maryland Eastern Shore and interim president of Marygrove College in Detroit. Family history and life Wade Ellis' father, Whitfield Washington, was born on September 26, 1870 in Sumter County, Alabama. In the mid 1880s, a confrontation involving Whitfield and several white men resulted in two white men dying. He escaped a possible lynching by making his way south to Mobile, Alabama and finding work as a cook on an international trade ship where he traveled to the Caribbean and the west coast of Africa. He eventually returned to the United States and moved to Oklahoma, changing his name to Whit Ellis and opening a restaurant. Wade Ellis' mother, Maggie Ellis, was born on August 25, 1880, in Dallas, Texas. Her father, James Riley, was likely born into slavery in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1844 before joining the Union Army towards the end of the American Civil War and eventually becoming a Buffalo Soldier. As a child Maggie attended an integrated school for white and Indian children and from 1898-99 she attended high school at the Colored Agriculture and Normal University at Langston, Oklahoma, now known as Langston University. She met Whit in 1899 and the two were married in 1900. Wade Ellis was born in Chandler, Oklahoma on June 9, 1909, one of ten children. As a child he worked at his family's restaurant, doing chores such as cleaning fish and shucking corn. He took up the trombone and played in a family band. Ellis excelled academically and attended Douglass School, graduating at 14. He received his bachelor's degree from Wilberforce University, Ohio in 1929, at age 18, his master's degree from the University of New Mexico in 1938, and his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in 1944. After moving to Ann Arbor in 1939, he purchased a home in 1941 with the help of a $300 ($ in 2019 value) loan from his barber. He died of a heart attack on November 20, 1989 in San Jose, California. Career Ellis' career in mathematics took place during the period of racial segregation in the United States, and when he earned his Master's Degree from the University of New Mexico he was forced to march at the end of his graduation line. When he was invited to speak and have dinner at the Texas Section of the American Mathematical Society, black people were not allowed to dine with the Section. Worried at offending their guest, mathematicians Paul K. Rees, who invited Ellis, and C.V. Newsom, who was then- chair at New Mexico, arranged the seating so that the two of them, along with another individual from New Mexico, would leave an empty seat for Ellis at dinner in hopes that the seating would not be noticed. It passed without incident, and Ellis inadvertently became the first black mathematician to have dinner with the Texas Section. In 1938, he presented The efficiency of approximation formulas for determining the rate of interest in amortization schedules to the Southwestern Section of the Mathematics Association of America (MAA). He began teaching in a one-room schoolhouse in Oklahoma, and taught at the Boys Industrial School in Boley, Oklahoma, Fort Valley State College in Georgia, and at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee, all of which were segregated. He received a Rosenwald Fellowship. In 1939, he moved with his wife Agatha and newborn son William Whit to Ann Arbor, Michigan to begin his doctorate at the University of Michigan. He chose the university as at the time only a few schools in the country accepted black students, and it was among the best-known. The school still had many segregation policies and issues with racism, but compared to others he believed it treated black students relatively well. He encouraged his brother Francis (Frank) Willis to enroll in a summer program at the school, and Frank eventually became a research assistant and also enrolled at the school. Upon earning his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1944 under the supervision of George Yuri Rainich, he became the twelfth African-American to do so in the United States. His thesis, On Relations Satisfied by Linear Operators on a Three Dimensional Linear Vector Space, was designated the \\"best in his department\\". Despite his excellent scholarly record, unlike other Ph.D. candidates he did not receive a teaching fellowship, and as a teaching assistant he was only paid 20% of what white teaching assistants earned. From 1944 to 1948 he worked at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory as a Section Director, where he carried out classified research on radar antennas as well as detecting whether the Soviet Union had detonated atomic weapons. Afterwards, he taught at Boston University and became the first black faculty member at Oberlin College, where he stayed for 19 years. While at Oberlin, he also became a member of the city council and served one term as the town's Vice-Mayor. In 1953 he became a Full Professor, and was elected to the Board of Governors of the Mathematical Association of America, and in 1954 he presented his paper On the directional derivative and was elected as an officer of the organization's Program Committee. In 1967 he became the Associate Dean of the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies and Professor of Mathematics at the University of Michigan, where he contributed to the Michigan Scholars Program. He consulted with several international groups on how to encourage mathematics education in developing countries, and in 1966 he was decorated by the government of Peru for his contributions to their higher education. On August 31, 1977 he retired from Michigan and was named Associate Dean Emeritus and Professor Emeritus of Mathematics. He took on administrative positions elsewhere, including becoming vice chancellor of academic affairs at University of Maryland Eastern Shore and interim president of Marygrove College (Detroit). He wrote the foreword to Black Mathematicians and Their Works, which was published in 1980. The book was part of the push to eliminate inequities in math education of minority students, and Ellis wrote that it was fighting back against the beliefs held by teachers that promising young black students were incapable of being mathematicians.

She is a co-founder of the National Association of Black Storytellers, which works to preserve folk traditions.  Early life and education  Linda McNear Goss was born in Alcoa, Tennessee to Willie and Junior McNear. She grew up in a large storytelling family, and often cites tales heard from her Granddaddy Murphy and Uncle Buster as her earliest influences. Her mother was a frequent public speaker at Blount County churches and civic events, and Goss learned speaking techniques from her mother's example. From her father, she learned a love of music, particularly jazz, and an appreciation for the way stories can be told through music. Goss's interest in the oral tradition began when she was in high school, working on an assignment to interview the oldest person she knew. After interviewing her grandfather, she realized that old stories like the folklore and personal history he shared with her would be lost if they weren't passed on and collected. She graduated from Charles M. Hall High School in 1965, and went on to study drama as an undergraduate at Howard University. She imbued her performances with elements from folk storytelling and oral tradition, in a collision of styles that was considered unusual at a time when vernacular traditions were kept separate from \\"fine\\" arts. She went on to earn a master's degree in education from Antioch University. She is a member of Zeta Phi Beta sorority.  Career  Linda Goss was a leader in the resurgence of American storytelling traditions that began in the 1970s. She was a featured storyteller at the 1975 Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife. It was at this festival that she developed her signature style of beginning a storytelling performance by crying out ‚ÄúWell, Oh Well, Oh Well. It‚Äôs Storytelling Time!‚Äù while ringing bells to gather the crowd and focus its attention. Goss would later trace the lineage of this calling to her grandfather, who had once been responsible for playing a bugle call to wake workers on a plantation in Alabama. She calls it \\"waking up the people,\\" in honor of and in conversation with this legacy. Goss's storytelling is influenced by folk tales, poetry, history, and musical forms including jazz, gospel, and country. She sees storytelling as a \\"tool for social change\\": a responsive and flexible art form that can be adapted and transformed to fit the immediate context of the teller and the audience. One of her mentors was the folklorist and art historian Gladys-Marie Fry, a professor at the University of Maryland. Other storytellers, artists, and scholars of folklore were sources of encouragement and community, including Brother Blue, Stephen Henderson, and Sonia Sanchez. She is the author of six books, and her poems have been collected in anthologies.  National Association of Black Storytellers  After attending a 1982 national storytelling conference at which she was one of only two Black participants, Goss realized there was a need for spaces focused specifically on Black storytelling and folk traditions. She and Mother Mary Carter Smith cofounded the \\"In The Tradition...\\" Annual National Black Storytelling Festival and Conference that year, followed in 1984 by the creation of the National Association of Black Storytellers. Through these organizations, they worked to organize storytellers and provide a platform to increase their visibility, as well as to preserve the oral tradition and ensure stories and folkways were not lost. Goss is a co-founder of Keepers of the Culture, a Philadelphia storytelling organization affiliated with the National Association of Black Storytellers, and a founding member of Patchwork, a storytelling group in Delaware.  Personal life  Goss lives in Baltimore, Maryland, with her husband Clay, with whom she has co-authored several books. They have three children: Aisha, Uhuru, and Jamal.  Awards and honors  Goss was honored as a National Endowment for the Arts National Heritage Fellow in 2019. She is the first African-American fellow honored for storytelling. She received the National Storytelling Network's Oracle lifetime achievement award in 2003, the 2005 Fellowship in Folk and Traditional Art from the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts, and the 2006 Leeway Transformation Award for women artists. In 2006 she was honored with the Benjamin A. Botkin Scholar Lecturer Award from the American Folk Life Center at the Library of Congress. She is the storyteller- ambassador for the National Great Blacks in Wax Museum, and has been a storyteller in residence at the Peale Museum in Baltimore and the Rosenbach Museum and Library in Philadelphia. She became the official storyteller for the city of Philadelphia in 1984, and her image is featured on a mural in that city as \\"The Traveling Storyteller\\" In 2017, Goss became the storyteller-in- residence at the Peale Center in Baltimore, Maryland.

Produced by Norro Wilson at Columbia Recording Studios in Nashville, Tennessee, it was released in September 1974 as the group's first album on Epic Records. As with its predecessor Comin' Right at Ya, Asleep at the Wheel's self-titled album featured a mix of traditional and original compositions, including songs written by popular country musicians Rex Griffin, Cindy Walker and Hank Penny. The second album by Asleep at the Wheel was the first to feature bassist Tony Garnier, who replaced Gene Dobkin in early 1974 and would remain with the band for several years. It was also the only album to feature the group's first full-time fiddler Richard \\"Corky\\" Casanova, who joined in time for the album's recording but left shortly after its release. Guest contributors include Johnny Gimble on fiddle and mandolin, Andy Stein on saxophone and fiddle, and Mickey Raphael on harmonica. Like its predecessor, Asleep at the Wheel failed to register on any national or international record charts. However, the band did register on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart for the first time, when second single \\"Choo Choo Ch'Boogie\\" (originally recorded by the Tympany Five) registered at number 69 in December 1974. Critical reviews of the album were generally positive, with commentators praising the breadth of musical styles on the record and its place within Western swing. Background After being dropped by United Artists, Asleep at the Wheel signed a deal with Epic Records in May 1974. For the recording of their first album on the label, the band wanted to work again with Tommy Allsup, who produced their 1973 debut Comin' Right at Ya; however, Don Ellis, head of Epic at the time, assigned Norris \\"Norro\\" Wilson to the project. Sessions took place in Nashville, Tennessee again, this time at Columbia Studio B. Speaking about the recording process, frontman Ray Benson recalled that Wilson \\"let us do what we wanted\\", describing it as \\"a good experience\\". The album was released in September 1974. The Asleep at the Wheel album cover features a photograph of the seven-piece band in front of a vintage 1938 Cadillac, which was taken in Austin, Texas shortly after the band relocated there from Oakland, California. The album was the band's first to feature bassist Tony Garnier, who replaced Gene Dobkin before recording began. It was also the only album to feature the group's first full-time fiddler Richard \\"Corky\\" Casanova, who joined for the recording and was credited as an official member on the album sleeve. Two tracks from Asleep at the Wheel were issued as singles in 1974: \\"You and Me Instead\\" and \\"Choo Choo Ch'Boogie\\". Reception Critical response to Asleep at the Wheel was generally positive. In an uncredited review, Cash Box magazine credited the band for the \\"gaining momentum\\" of progressive country, stating: \\"The group has gained considerable repute for their live act and their first album for Epic marks a worthy label debut as these seven dyed-in-the-wool country buffs confidently rip their way through numbers like \\"Choo Choo Ch'Boogie,\\" \\"I'm Gonna Be a Wheel Someday,\\" and \\"Bloodshot Eyes.\\"\\" In a retrospective review for website AllMusic, James Allen gave Asleep at the Wheel three and a half out of five stars, praising the \\"multitude of styles\\" present on the record including Western swing, jazz and honky-tonk. Music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a B rating, lower than the A‚Äì awarded to Comin' Right at Ya, comparing it to the style of Bob Wills. Cash Box praised \\"You and Me Instead\\" as \\"sweet\\", and hailed \\"Choo Choo Ch'Boogie\\" as \\"an infectious shuffle\\".

Ambler was tased multiple times by authorities. Video of Ambler's death, recorded by police officers, was obtained and released by news organizations in June 2020. During the arrest Ambler repeatedly stated \\"I can't breathe\\" and \\"please save me\\" before dying. Ambler's death was recorded by a Live PD television crew and the recording has since been destroyed, according to A&E; Networks. Javier Ambler II Javier Ambler II was a 40-year-old black man, a postal worker, and the father of two sons. His mother described him as a gentle giant and a great father. Ambler's father, who was in the army, said that Javier \\"didn't know white from black or Latino from Filipino... Everything was green, Army green.\\" Ambler lived in Pflugerville and had earlier played football at Ellison High School, Blinn College, and also attended Prairie View A&M; University. On the night of March 28, Ambler was driving home after playing poker with friends. Arrest and death On March 28, 2019, sheriff's deputies tried to stop Ambler after they said that he did not dim his SUV lights to oncoming traffic. Ambler continued driving, leading to a 22-minute chase. After the 22 minute police chase and several minor collisions, the chase ended when Ambler crashed into a tree, on a North Austin Street. Ambler was unarmed and exited his car with his hands raised. According to the police report, Deputy J.J. Johnson, who was accompanied by a film crew of Live PD, told Ambler to \\"get down\\" five or six times, and then tased him after Ambler appeared to back towards his SUV. According to the police report, Ambler partially fell but tried to stand again, and was then tased in the upper back by Deputy Zach Camden. The report stated that Ambler further resisted, and was tased again by Johnson. According to news organizations deputies pinned Ambler down and tased him 3‚Äì4 times. Video evidence released in June 2020 shows that Ambler pleaded with officers that he could not breathe and suffered from congestive heart failure. During the arrest Ambler said \\"I am not resisting\\" and \\"I have congestive heart failure.\\" He called out \\"please save me\\" before deputies tased him for a final time. Ambler became motionless and unresponsive after officers placed handcuffs on him. During the arrest one of the officers said \\"give me your hands or I'm going to tase you again,\\" and another officer said \\"I'm pretty sure I just broke his finger.\\" Ambler's death was ruled a homicide, caused by congestive heart failure and hypertensive cardiovascular disease \\"in combination with forcible restraint\\" According to CBS Austin's reporting, Ambler may have been en route to hospital during the chase, quoting Ambler's former partner that \\"...per police, it was never a high-speed chase. It was just, he couldn‚Äôt stop in distress.\\" Investigation An internal affairs investigation by Williamson County stated that its deputies did nothing wrong in Ambler's death. In February 2020, KVUE and journalist Tony Plohetski learned of Ambler's death after they were contacted by investigators who were frustrated by failed efforts to acquire more information from the Sheriff's Office of Williamson County. In June 2020, the Austin American-Statesman and KVUE obtained police officer body camera footage of Ambler's death, after months of records requests. A&E; then revealed that they had earlier destroyed their own footage due to a contract between Williamson County and Live PD producers in place at the time of Ambler's death. On September 28, 2020 Williamson County Sheriff Robert Chody was indicted on a felony evidence tampering charge stemming from destruction of video relating to Javier Ambler's death.https://www.statesman.com/news/20200928/williamson-county-sheriff- robert-chody-indicted-in-javier-ambler-case Reactions In the wake of the protests over the killing of George Floyd, A&E; had already pulled Live PD from its schedule. On June 9, Live PD host Dan Abrams, who acts as ABC News' chief legal affairs anchor, promised Live PD fans that the show would eventually return. The next day, A&E; announced that they had officially canceled the series. Margaret Moore, a Travis County District Attorney, stated that Sheriff Robert Chody had refused to provide evidence. In response, three of Williamson County's four commissioners called for Chody's resignation. Protests against Ambler's death were held outside the Williamson County Court on June 9, 2020.

There are 27 regional chapters at municipal, provincial, and federal levels. These include the Toronto Police Association and the Vancouver Police Union. A police strike in Montreal in October of 1969 led to the Murray-Hill riot, named for the company that held a monopoly on taxi traffic at the Dorval Airport, now the Montr√©al‚ÄìTrudeau International Airport. Amid a background of ethnic tensions, six years of steady bombings of the Front de lib√©ration du Qu√©bec, rioting by separatists, a coincidental gangland war for control of the city, and a record high murder rate in the city, the Montreal Police Service called for a daylong \\"study session\\" at the Paul Sauv√© Arena. They were joined by militant cab drivers, who chose the Murray-Hill building as a target. Two persons were killed, several injured, six banks were robbed, vandalism, looting and arson common, and millions of dollars of damage done during the 16-hour walkout. The police did not legally strike as a union. The contractual right to a \\"study session\\" as written into the , allowed for such a work stoppage, which is not technically considered a strike.  Police unions in Germany  There are three police unions in Germany: the Trade Union of the Police (), one of eight industrial affiliations of the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB); the Deutsche Polizeigewerkschaft, affiliated with the German Civil Service Federation; and the Bund Deutscher Kriminalbeamter, which is exclusively for members of the Kriminalpolizei. Police unions in Sweden The Police Union () is a trade union in Sweden. It has a membership of 18,500 (including police academy students), and is affiliated with the Swedish Confederation of Professional Employees, and EuroCOP. It also maintains contact with the Swedish branch of the International Police Association. Police unions in the United States Police unions in the United States encompass a variety of organizations. About 80% of police unions engaged in employee contract negotiations are independent, operate in a municipality or a region of similar size, and are not affiliated with larger organized labor unions. The national Fraternal Order of Police is the largest single organization, but includes both labor union locals and fraternal lodges. The police union with the largest membership nationally is the International Union of Police Associations, which chartered with the AFL‚ÄìCIO in 1979. For decades after the Boston Police Strike of 1919, police and other public employees were prevented by state laws from organizing.

She was the first female archaeologist from Togo, and in 2017 she was given the honor of ‚ÄúHuman Living Treasure of Togo‚Äú.  Biography  Ang√®le Dola Akofa Aguigah was born on 4 December 1955 in Lom√©, Togo, where she grew up. She studied at the University of Paris I, Pantheon-Sorbonne from 1978‚Äì86, where she graduated with degrees in: License in Archaeology and History of Art; MA in African Archaeology; Diploma of Advanced Studies; PhD in African Archaeology. She is one of the few academics in West Africa to hold two PhDs - she graduated with her second in 1995 under the supervision of Jean Devisse at the University of Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne.  Career  In addition to a successful career in archaeology, Aguigah has also held high political offices in the Government of Togo.  Archaeology  Aguigah is head of the Archaeological Programme of Togo and is a senior lecturer at the University of Lom√© and University of Kara. She is an international consultant on cultural heritage and has lectured widely. She researched traditional floor coverings in Togo. This research concentrated on a survey of potsherd floorings at Tado. This research also demonstrated that archaeo-metallurgical activities had taken place there since the eleventh century. She has directed archaeological excavations at Nots√©, Tado, Dapaong, Nook (Togo), and B√® sites. Her research at Nots√© demonstrated that the earthworks built there were not used for defence, but to define the space as socially distinct. As a result of her collaboration with Nicoue Gayibor, their excavations were able to demonstrate that the thirty-three neighbourhoods at Nots√© were made up of family enclosures. She coordinated World Heritage Site applications for Togo, with particular concern for the cave sites of Nook and Mamproug.  Politics  Taberma house in Koutammakou, Togo Aguigah's experience in archaeology and heritage meant that work in government became a second phase of her career. From 2000-03 she was Minister Delegate to the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office in charge of Private Sector of Togo. From 2003 she was Minister of Culture of Togo. During her ministry the Cultural Landscape of Koutammakou was registered as a World Heritage Site and a programme of public engagement. She also encouraged a decentralisation of cultural industries in Togo, in order to create more regional opportunities. In 2012, Aguigah became director of the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI) in Benin. Her time at CENI was not without controversy: she announced that elections could be ready in May 2013, ahead of the government's expected date of October, which caused opposition from the government. She had previously been an RTP candidate in the 2007 legislative elections. She has been outspoken about the need for internal and external investment on the archaeological heritage of Togo.

Public transportation means all transportation facilities and means that provide transportation services available to the general public. The range of public transportation, including air, sea, and roads, is wide, and among them are city buses and urban railroads. Along with the rapid growth of Korea, public transportation has also developed to facilitate people's movement.  Background  After the Industrial Revolution, people began to flock to the city center. Factories began to sprout around the city. People working in factories settled around, and industrial activity increased at a rapid pace. As time went by, people from farther places began to flock. Public transportation such as trams and railways was installed for these people to move quickly. As the industry continued to develop, people gradually left the countryside and came to work in factories. These people naturally settled in close proximity to jobs or near easy-to-move stations. In other words, the city developed along the station. The concentration of population in large cities has continued and more transportation is needed to move these people. The development of industry and automobile technology in the 1960s led to a growing number of people having own cars, mainly in advanced countries such as Europe. The number of cars has more than doubled in Europe in a decade. People can go anywhere, anytime by car. Even now, the demand for cars continues to grow. Increased demand for cars has also helped ease the population's downtown concentration. This is because you can buy a cheap house in a relatively remote area that was difficult to access by public transportation and travel by car. At first, residential areas were formed in the center of the city, and the size of the city grew as the concentric circle grew from the center. Of course, new roads had to be built and intersections, circular roads and highways had to be built to accommodate the growing number of cars. In other words, transportation systems such as private cars and road expansion have been developed to speed up travel time. The problem of environmental pollution is also a reason why public transportation has developed. The car's fuel is consumed and pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and dust due to incomplete combustion are also released. By the 1990s, cars also emitted sulfur dioxide.  Bus  Korea Bus card terminal in bus Buses are one of the most popular means of transportation in Korea. Buses began operating in 1912, and were operated first in the provinces. There are also types of buses, including city buses, intercity buses, and express buses. In 2017, the total number of passengers transported in total was 5,968,577,185. Also the bus, which carries 65 people and operates every 10 minutes, has 390 passengers per hour. In the case of bus fares, the amount varies depending on the type of bus and the method of payment, and it also depends on the age. Like the card terminal image on the right, people pay the right fare by placing the transportation card on that machine. Among the various types (mainly classified according to distance traveled), there is a separate application for bus booking. The app has a simple payment function, so if you register only the card you want to pay for, you can make a reservation in just a few minutes if you choose the boarding date and the seat you want. There is also a machine at a bus stop in Korea that allows passengers to check their remaining balance by bringing a transportation card that they want to use. In addition, the arrival time and remaining seats of the buses at the bus stop in question are displayed on the electronic display board, which is very convenient. If you search the desired bus number in the search box in conjunction with the Internet, you can know the arrival time of the bus, bus car number, etc., even if the passenger is not necessarily at the bus stop. Currently, not all buses in Korea are considerate of the disabled. For them, the number of low-floor buses with low footrest heights has increased compared to the past, but they are still lacking. Of course, in addition to this situation, there are some areas where low-floor buses are not suitable for running on some roads. In principle, buses in Korea cannot carry food such as beverages. Especially when you ride with food that smells a lot, you get away from etiquette. In a similar vein, drivers can refuse to ride if they get on a bus without a mask as the Korona Virus has become so prevalent recently.  Subway  alt= a subway map of the metropolitan areaKorean subways include regular subways, KTX, Mugunghwa-ho and Saemaeul-ho trains. As of 2018, there are 348 stations for regular subways. The biggest advantage of the subway compared to other means of transportation is that it has a large number of people per hour. With 600 people on board, the hourly passenger traffic on the subway, which runs every two minutes, is 18,000 people. Due to this amount of transportation, it is hard to find large cities that do not have subways not only in Korea but also in the world. In Lyon, France, about 10,000 people use the subway per hour. The reason why the subway has a large number of people per hour is because it uses a dedicated railroad. It can run at an average speed of 75 kilometers because there is nothing in the way of driving. During rush hour, when there is a severe congestion, one bus runs every two minutes. However, it takes a lot of time and money to build a subway infrastructure. The subway has to invest three to five times more money than trams because it has to build rails through tunnels and build elevators, stairs and platforms. Construction costs are covered by taxes from local governments, the central government, companies and passengers. The safety of the subway system is almost safe if checked in general without many factors. However, it is not completely safe and requires more caution than other public transportation in terms of derailment, power outage, tunnel collapse and collision. Therefore, the subway has many safety technologies. Recently, screen doors were installed at all stations to prevent the train from crashing into the tracks. Using double track, frontal collisions are extremely rare and reduce the risk of rear-end collisions and derailments by lowering the speed of operation. Fire is prone to occur, and the system provides places for evacuation. However, it is said that it is almost under control.  Bicycle  In Korea, the number of registered bicycles is about 11,268,816 as of 2016, and the number is increasing. In Korea, there is a record that Seo Jae-pil first introduced it in 1895 after returning from the U.S. in the 1890s and toured the construction site of Independence Gate. At that time, it was called a wheelbarrow, but the government named it Bicycle in the 1903s. There are many bicycle clubs in Korea, and many people enjoy riding bicycles as a leisure activity. In addition, when other public transportation is crowded, bicycles can travel faster than walking, so office workers often use them when commuting. As the number of bicycle riders increased, almost every part of the country also built bike lanes. Bicycle-only roads are mainly accessible, and are designed to reduce the contact accidents between pedestrians and bicycles. On the other hand, bicycle clubs are beneficial in that they can build a bond between people and live a healthy life. However, there are growing calls for improvement as they are driving on motorways rather than bicycle lanes, and are feared to cause contact accidents between bicycles and cars.  Problems  The problem of public transportation is that people have to transfer too often. In order to solve this problem, it was necessary to reduce the travel time, or distance, in urban and residential areas as much as possible. Therefore, urban lawmakers are also planning to deploy the existing mega-sized complex centers on a small scale and deploy residential and commercial facilities in various places. Some big cities in developed countries come up with extreme policies to address traffic jams. In London, for example, motorists have to pay to enter central London. Some cities completely restrict the entry of cars from the heart of the city, allowing only pedestrians and bicycles to travel. Meanwhile, South Korea argues that taxi drivers are included in public transportation even if they do not have regular connections due to the nature of taxis. In fact, some members of the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea proposed a bill to include taxis in the scope of public transportation in 2012, but bus drivers and operators decided to suspend the operation of buses in Korea in protest. In addition, the bill was opposed by the South Korean government and many other places.  Accidents  Bus = Buses carry more people than cars, so special attention is needed for bus drivers. Drowsy driving is more important than expected among the causes of accidents. There were also various types of accidents, such as hitting a person on the road, sliding on a snow road, and falling below a cliff. Buses are likely to be accompanied by casualties in the event of an accident. = Subway = There are also constant subway accidents, and the biggest reason is the aging of the subway. In the case of Seoul, it has been operating the Seoul Metro for about 40 years, and it needs to be discussed whether maintenance personnel are properly deployed. Besides aging, there are also traffic errors between subways and lack of safety personnel. = Bicycle = Bicycles are often caused by collisions between people, cars and bicycles. When unexpected objects pop out, accidents can't be avoided no matter how much they brake. People who have to wear helmets when riding a bike, but those who don't, are not uncommon. There is also a case of riding a bicycle on a motorway, a very dangerous and conceptless behavior.  Others  * Etiquette : In the case of buses and subways, you should not talk loudly next to you or call loudly with the person because it is a public facility used by many people. Nor should the facilities be soiled that everyone can use them pleasantly. For safety reasons, passengers should board in order and get off in turn. When you take the subway, you have to let the person who gets off first get off and then get on the subway. It is not a duty, but it is better to give your seat when the elderly and the weak board on the bus or subway.  See also  * A man once held a Danso and threatened other passengers on the subway line 7, which people called a \\"Danso killer.\\" His appearance had high views. * One man who took the subway on Line 4 is also famous for dancing in front of other passengers. * There are seats for the elderly and the weak on buses and subways in Korea, and recently, seats for pregnant women have been added.

Release and reception  Mestri was released on 12 March 2009, and became controversial because many of its dialogues were interpreted as being targeted at the-then Praja Rajyam Party chief Chiranjeevi, despite Krissna's denial. Deepa Garimella of Fullhyd gave the film an overall rating of 5 out of 10. She gave 7 points for the cast performances, 5 for the script, 7.5 for the music and 6 for the visuals. Radhika Rajamani of Rediff.com rated the film two stars out of five, saying, \\"One has to wait to see if the climate is favourable for Mestri's percolation to the audience in all the centres.\\" The Times of India said it \\"fails to impress on many counts.

(1987). Introduction: Definitions and perspectives in the study of children's ethnic socialization. In J. Phinney & M. Rotherman (Eds.), Children's ethnic socialization: Pluralism and development (pp. 10-28). Beverly Hills, CA: Sage Publications. In a multiracial country like the United States, the phenomenon of minority parents \\"helping children understand their race/ethnicity and cope effectively with discrimination\\" is widely seen. In African American communities, a common manifestation of this is \\"The Talk\\", an explanation of the realistic dangers children and young adults face due to racism or unjust treatment from authority figures, law enforcement or other parties.  Racial-Ethnic Socialization Practices  Studies indicate the use of ethnic-racial socialization practices promotes healthy psycho-social well-being and supports the development of a strong-racial identity in children of color. There is a positive association between ethnic-racial socialization with self- perceptions, interpersonal relationship quality, and internalizing behavior. Ethnic-racial socialization‚Äôs link to psycho-social outcomes are dependent on four practices: cultural socialization, preparation for bias, promotion of mistrust, and egalitarianism. The integrative model proposes parental ethnic- racial socialization practices and the link to psycho-social outcome differs across time and is dependent on the child‚Äôs developmental stage and cognitive competencies.  Cultural Socialization  Cultural socialization is the mode by which parents of ethnic children communicate cultural values and history to address ethnic and racial issues. Research has consistently linked cultural socialization with positive psycho-social outcomes such as a decrease in anxiety, anger, depressive symptoms, and overall psychological distress as a result of facing discrimination. Studies have demonstrated that children‚Äôs ability cope effectively with negative experiences regarding their race and cultural background is negated by their parents practice to impart racial and ethnic pride. Moreover, parental ethnic-racial socialization in some instances has been shown to act as a barrier between the negative impact of racism and discrimination on youth‚Äôs psycho-social outcome. Among the four ethnic racial socialization practices, cultural socialization has been shown to have the strongest and most consistent positive effects on children of colors psycho- social well-being.  Preparation for Bias  Preparation for bias is the ethnic-racial socialization practice that parents use to prepare their children to have the resilience and ability to cope when dealing with experiences of racism and discrimination. Unlike cultural socialization, studies have not shown a consistent link between preparation for bias and psycho-social outcome for youth of color. Some research indicates how bias socialization may be associated with decreased externalizing behavior such as physical aggression. Inversely, other studies demonstrated that preparation for bias was negatively related to self-esteem. Additionally, bias socialization requires comprehension of complex race relations and thus preparation for bias could benefit adolescents more than young children who are more likely to experience and recognize oppressive systems and discrimination.  Promotion of Mistrust  Promotion of mistrust is the practice by which parents teach youth to mistrust or be cautious of other groups or people from a different cultural background or race. Unlike preparation for bias and cultural socialization, the association between promotion of mistrust and youth of colors psycho-social outcome is not well documented. Research has presented varied findings regarding promotion of mistrust. Some studies find that promotion of mistrust is linked to decreased externalizing behaviors among young children , whereas other studies associate this practice with increased depression and reduced family cohesion.  Egalitarianism  Egalitarianism is the practice that refers to the principle that all people are equal and focuses on the commonalities among different racial and ethnic groups. Egalitarianism has been an unsuccessful ethnic- racial socialization practice and studies have linked it to poor mental health outcomes for children of color. Research demonstrates there is an association between the use of ethnic-racial socialization practices and children‚Äôs self- perceptions, interpersonal relationship quality, externalizing behavior, and internalizing behavior. Parents of color utilize culturally informed and ecologically adaptive socialization practices in order to prepare their children and offer them the tools necessary to mitigate the effects of racism and discrimination on their psycho-social development. For this reason, studies have shown ethnic-racial socialization practices to be an effective tool to promote a strong ethnic-racial development for African Americans in particular, given their long-standing history of stigmatization and oppression in the United States.

In 2019, she was elected to the National Academy of Medicine in recognition of her work.  Education  Taylor is African-American. She attended Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan for both her undergraduate and graduate studies. There, she received her Bachelor of Science in Nursing in 1999, her Master of Science in Nursing in 2002, and her Doctor of Philosophy in 2004. She first joined a laboratory during her undergraduate studies, working under the mentorship of Joseph Dunbar, who was the chair of the department of physiology. Her research at the university evolved over the years to ultimately studying the genetics of hypertension, focusing on multiple generations of African American women .  Career and research  In 2005, Taylor became an Assistant Professor of Nursing at the University of Michigan. In 2008, she moved to Connecticut, where she became Associate Professor and Associate Dean of Diversity and Inclusion at Yale School of Nursing. While at Yale, she was Contact PI on a five-year study, receiving funding support from the National Institute of Nursing Research at the National Institutes of Health. The study, known as the Intergenerational Impact of Genetic and Psychological Factors on Blood Pressure (InterGEN) study, investigated the combined impact of genetic, environmental, and psychological stressors on blood pressure, with a focus on members of the African American community. During her tenure, she also began to study the genomics of lead poisoning in response to the ongoing Flint water crisis, developing a method to simultaneously measure lead levels and test genotypes of children to identify genetic factors that increased risk of long-term damage. As a graduate student at Wayne State, she also investigated the interplay between gene variants and environmental exposure to lead among children in Detroit. She identified a correlation between children with a variant of the gene that codes for arylsulfatase A (ASA) and an increased risk of neurodevelopmental damage as a result of exposure to lead. In 2018, Taylor joined the faculty at New York University, becoming the inaugural Vernice D. Ferguson Professor in Health Equity where she remained until 2020. There, she served as the co-Principal Investigator on a five-year grant award, which established the NYU Meyers Center for Precision Health in Diverse Populations.

Northwestern European American people can usually trace back all or some of their heritage to Great Britain, Ireland, Northern Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Northern France, and other nations connected to Northwestern Europe geographically or culturally. As Northwestern Europe is also a cultural region, this group often includes American people with descent from bordering regions, such as Austria, Finland, Southern Germany, and Switzerland. The category is a subgroup of the diasporic panethnic grouping of European Americans, which includes Eastern European Americans and Southern European Americans. Background Northwestern European Americans have been researched academically, reported on in journalistic works, and are widely considered as a distinct panethnic group. The grouping is based on the identification of descent from one or more nations located in Northwestern Europe or a country that is ethnoculturally related with the area. The group can be subdivided into national subgroups, including Welsh Americans, Swedish Americans, and French Americans. History In the territories that would become the Thirteen Colonies (which would become the US), Northwestern European people colonized large coastal areas of North America, creating farms and plantations. The New World culture of the group contributed to the creation of early modern slavery, which \\"juxtaposed west and central Africans with northwest Europeans in the Americas.\\" Although these Dutch, French, and British settlers were broadly from the same region of Europe, there was intragroup hostility and prejudice between them. In 1751, Benjamin Franklin, an Old Stock American and Founding Father of the US, expressed cultural and racial concerns about German immigration to the United States. Historian Thomas Borstelmann noted that within a few decades, \\"the idea of Germans having a different complexion than other northwestern European Americans came to seem peculiar\\". Northwestern European immigration Large numbers of Irish, German, French, and British people emigrated to the East Coast of the US from 1821 to 1880. This period has been described academically as the \\"Northwest European Wave\\". According to Professor Vincent N. Parrillo, \\"By 1890, the 'mainstream American' ingroup did not yet include many other northwest European Americans. Although some multigenerational Americans of non-British ancestry had blended into the mainstream, millions of others had not.\\" Between 1880 and 1920, immigration to the United States from Eastern and Southern Europe increased greatly. Despite this, historian Paul Spickard noted that in this period, \\"Northwest Europeans continued to come and stay in very large numbers.\\" There were various prejudices among them, sometimes attributed to them being the dominant ethnic group, which found expression in the general view that the newer arrivals would never assimilate to their majority culture. This view was held, particularly by those of \\"colonial background\\", up until World War I, who believed there was a \\"deep divide\\" between Southern or Eastern Europeans and what were regarded as Northwest European Americans. By 1914, \\"terms denoting a common northwest European consciousness, such as 'American race stock'\\", became significantly more inclusive to incorporate increasingly large numbers of Germans. Northwestern European heritage began to be equivocated with the founding myth of the nation, utilized by nativists to include \\"northwest Europeans who shared the common racial 'stock' of 'our forefathers'\\". Even with gradual inclusion, sociologist Stanley Lieberson noted that in the early 20th century, Northwestern Europeans were one of the slowest immigrant groups to apply for US citizenship. Use of the category for racism Although not explicitly racial, 19th-century American historians, such as George Bancroft, Francis Parkman, and William H. Prescott, often wrote with a presumption of \\"a genetic trait, a germ, genius, or creative spark found in northwest Europeans\\", which, as a narrative, contributed towards bias and preferential treatment towards the group in the United States. Towards the late 19th and early 20th century, American eugenists, such as Madison Grant and Lothrop Stoddard, were utilizing the ethnic category for supremacism, denigrating immigration into the US from other ethnic groups, and popularizing ideas that Northwestern Europeans were being genetically diluted; they also suggested, along with the likes of Thomas Bailey Aldrich and Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, that a race suicide of the group was occurring. Works from academics such as William Ripley, while more subtle in their terminology, referenced the panethnic grouping in a discriminatory manner compared with other peoples: \\"If not overtly stated, the superiority of the Teutonic race (blond-haired, pale- skinned, blue-eyed northwestern Europeans) was implied, an assumption welcomed by writers like Madison Grant.\\" Professor Ruth Clifford Engs analyzed the 1972 essay Genetics, Eugenics, and the Immigration Restriction Act of 1924 by historian Kenneth Ludmerer and its in-depth exploration of \\"the interrelationship of eugenic and anti-immigrant sentiments based upon the supposition that Northwestern Europeans were more 'genetically fit' than southern and eastern Europeans\\". National Origins Act The Immigration Act of 1924 significantly favored Northwestern Europeans, with its reference to the 1890 United States Census, due to the 2% immigration (based on the number of foreign-born residents) allocated by the National Origins Quota. This act almost restricted meaningful immigration from any grouping other than Northwest Europeans. Climatologist and eugenics advocate Robert DeCourcy Ward had served as a key witness to Congress, in favor of passing the legislation. The co-founder of the Immigration Restriction League, Ward wrote in 1924 regarding the Act: > There was no question of the racial superiority of Northwestern Europeans or > of the racial inferiority of Southeastern Europeans. It was simply a > question as to which of these two groups of aliens is, as a whole, best > fitted, by tradition, political background, customs, education, and habits > of thought to adjust itself to American institutions and to American social > and economic conditions ‚Äì to become, in short, an adaptable, homogeneous, > and helpful element in American national life. Modern period As part of the wider group, Irish immigrants held a uniquely complex route to inclusion within a greater Northwestern European identity, partly due to their predominantly Catholic faith, in contrast with the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant establishment in 19th- and 20th-century America. During the 1940s, assimilated Catholic German Americans created \\"common ground\\" with Irish Americans while they also \\"cooperated with other northwest Europeans and echoed the behavior of such other 'Nordic' groups as Norwegian Americans\\". By 1960, the United States had shifted significantly from relying on native-born or immigrant Northwestern Europeans, with large increases in the labor force from Hispanic and Latino Americans. Academic research A 2009 Population and Development Review study by professor Steven Ruggles compared the demographic structure of Northwestern European families in Europe and North America. Published in the American Journal of Human Genetics in 2011, genetic data was analyzed for the pan-ethnic group. The research, conducted by Dr. Evan E. Eichler with multiple other scientists, compared copy-number variation in the genomes of various ethnic groups including Northwestern European Americans, Yoruba people, and Han Chinese.

Biography  Coughtry was born in Saint-Lambert, Quebec, on June 8, 1931. He learned to paint at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts School, then attended the Ontario College of Art, graduating in 1953 with a travelling scholarship. Abroad, he travelled to Ibiza, an island which is part of the Balearic group, which would in time become his home. In Toronto again, he worked with Graphics Associates as a film graphic designer for television and later with the television department of the Canadian Broadcasting Company until 1959. In 1955, he had his first exhibition with Michael Snow at Toronto's Hart House, University of Toronto (now the Justina Barnicke Gallery). Figure on a Bed, a thickly painted study of an interior space, influenced by his favourite artist, the French Post-Impressionist Pierre Bonnard, was bought by the Art Gallery of Ontario. His first one-man show with the Isaacs Gallery was in 1956 and he continued to show with the Isaacs thereafter. For that reason, he has been called one of the Isaacs Group of artists which includes Michael Snow, Joyce Wieland, Gordon Rayner and John Meredith, among others. His national reputation was made with semi-abstract paintings that showed one or two figures floating in space, but, as he said, colour came first, along with heavy impasto. In some of the canvases the figure might be hardly perceptible. In the years which followed, he continued to create this crucial subject of art for himself while exploring different media. In 1962, he painted a major mural at the Toronto Pearson International Airport. He was elected to the Canadian Group of Painters and Canadian Society of Graphic Art. Coughtry died on January 13, 1999, in Toronto, at the age of 67.

The acquittal of the confessed killer on the gay panic defense led to widespread fear in Charleston's gay community.  Murder  Jack Dobbins was a 30 year old chemical company executive at the Davidson Chemical Co. Division of W.R. Grace and Company at the time of his murder on November 1, 1958; his murder is believed to have occurred during the hours of 1:30 to 7:00am. According to friends of Dobbins, he had gone to a Halloween party with his roommate Edward Otey, a 25 year old student at the Medical University of South Carolina, and several other friends and is reported to have left the party at 2:00 am on November the 1st. When reporting to the home of Dobbins at 14 Queen Street, Elizabeth Bryant, Dobbins' maid, found him dead on his living room sofa unclothed. Bryant alerted Dobbins' housemate, Edward Otey, who had been asleep upstairs and Otey proceeded to call the police. The Charleston News and Courier reported Dobbins injuries saying that his \\"his head was bloodied from repeated blows near the left ear\\". The weapon believed to have used in the murder of Dobbins was a brass candlestick holder found in the arms of Jack Dobbins at the scene causing the assault to be referred to as the Candlestick murder. An autopsy of Dobbins indicated that he had been struck nine times resulting in the fracturing of his skull in three places. Coroner Jennings Cauthren stated that there were no signs of struggle to the attack which he said suggests that the attack was a surprise to Dobbins. Suspects Dobbins' housemate, Edward Otey (1934-1969) was an initial suspect but was later dismissed. John Mahon became the primary suspect. Mahon was an 18 year old airman that Dobbins had met at Club 49, a mixed gay and straight bar in Charleston on October 31, 1958 where Dobbins helped to \\"tend bar\\". Dobbins had served Mahon a few drinks before they decided to continue their night at the Elbow Cocktail bar, where Mahon was denied entry because he could not comply with their dress code. They returned to Dobbins' house at 14 Queen Street in the early morning of November 1. Mahon claimed to have thought Dobbins to only be unconscious after hitting him and that he became aware of Dobbins death through newspapers. Mahon turned himself into the police and admitted to the murder claiming self defense. The Charleston News and Courier published Mahon's account of the night writing that Dobbins had brought Mahon back to his residence on 14 Queen Street and served him whisky and proceeded to make \\"improper advances\\". The Charleston News and Courier went on to report that the \\"advances\\" made Mahon uncomfortable and that he tried to \\"think of a method of escape\\". Mahon used the restroom and upon returning found Dobbins \\"unclothed\\" in the living room. It is then that Mahon claims that Dobbins told him to \\"come here John\\" prompting Mahon to run upstairs where he obtained the candlestick from the bedroom of Dobbins and upon returning downstairs where he said that he told Dobbins that he wanted to leave. Trial of John Mahon Mahon was put on trial for Dobbins' murder on December 9, 1958. Witnesses at the trial made allusions to Dobbins' sexuality, commenting that he didn't often have female visitors. Mahon testified that Dobbins had made advances and that Mahon had attacked to knock Dobbins out, not to kill him. While testifying, Mahon was quoted that he \\"hit [Dobbins] three or four times\\" after which Dobbins \\"fell on the couch\\"; Mahon says that he proceeded to \\"[toss] the candlestick down on the couch and ran out the door\\". The state had called for the death penalty against Mahon. The prosecution tried to cite robbery as a motive for the murder of Jack Dobbins. Solicitor Theodore D. Stoney claimed that in the case of Dobbins it would have been a robbery as \\"some people preyed on persons of abnormal behavior to get money\\"; this was a reference to Dobbins' sexuality. Mahon appeared in front of the all-male jury to testify. He was later found not guilty by the jury under the argument of self defense that was presented by the defense. He was allowed to return home with his family to celebrate Christmas.  Aftermath  Billy Camden, a member of the local gay community, stated that the attack and the verdict made the gay community distrust the justice system. \\"By emphasizing accepted gender roles, the defense lawyers placed sexuality on the list of concerns for those in Charleston looking to maintain the old social order of veiled white supremacy and racial segregation,\\" writes Thompson, current head of digital research services at University of Houston Libraries. \\"Furthermore, the close coverage of the trial by local and regional newspapers helped to spread the consequences of sexual non-conformity to a wider audience, even if these newspapers did not blatantly engage in a discussion on homosexuality. The trial served as just one in a series of reminders on what the white power structure of Charleston and other Southern cities would tolerate.\\" Leonard Matlovich recalled the Candlestick murder as a reminder of the negative consequences of homosexuality.

Furthermore, Doleski's research focuses on the areas of Smart Markets, transformation of the energy industry and Internet of Things.  Utility 4.0  In 2013, Doleski developed the term Utility 4.0 for innovative energy supply companies. The number 4 stands for a fourth epochal leap in the energy sector: after allocation (Utility 1.0), supply (Utility 2.0) and service (Utility 3.0) comes digitization.The term is not only influenced by the historical division into four phases by the terms Industry 1.0 - 4.0, but also picks up on the discussion about digitalization as the fourth industrial revolution in the production economy under the term Industry 4.0 and transfers it to the energy industry.. In 2016, the booklet Utility 4.0 - Transformation from Utility to Digital Energy Services was published by Springer Publishing as one of the first publications on the digital transformation of the energy sector. This was followed in 2017 by the book Herausforderung Utility 4.0 - Wie sich die Energiewirtschaft im Zeitalter der Digitalisierung ver√§ndert and finally in 2020 by the double volume Realisierung Utility 4.0.

The Associated Press wrote that it would be \\"the most significant conservation legislation enacted in nearly half a century.\\"  Legislative history  President Trump signs the Great American Outdoors Act, August 4, 2020. The bill was first introduced in the House of Representatives by John Lewis (D-GA) as the Taxpayer First Act of 2019 on March 28, 2019. After inserting amendments, Senator Cory Gardner (R‚ÄìCO) reintroduced the bill on March 9, 2020, during the 116th United States Congress as the Great American Outdoors Act. On June 9, it passed a procedural vote 80‚Äì17 and moved to full consideration before the Senate. The bill passed the Senate on June 17 by a vote of 73‚Äì25. On July 22, the amended bill was passed by the House on a bipartisan vote of 310‚Äì107.  Support and opposition  Considered bipartisan in nature for the 116th Congress, the bill attracted 59 co-sponsors, both Democrats and Republicans. President Trump expressed a willingness to sign the act after being shown an impressive picture of land within Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park protected by LWCF funds, despite previously opposing the LWCF. The LWCF, first established in 1965, had been made permanent by the 2019 John D. Dingell Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act but had not been permanently funded at that time. The measure was supported by conservation organizations such as The Nature Conservancy, the National Wildlife Federation, and the League of Conservation Voters, while some animal husbandry and mining groups opposed it. While supporting the bill, some Democrats suggested that Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, only allowed debate on the bill in order to support the 2020 re-election efforts of Gardner and Steve Daines (R‚ÄìMT).

The lower part of this small valley is served by Chemin Royale (route 368) which runs along the southeast shore of √éle d'Orl√©ans. Forestry is the main economic activity in the upper part of this valley; and agriculture in the lower part. The surface of the Maheu River is generally frozen from the beginning of December until the end of March; however, safe circulation on the ice is generally done from mid-December to mid-March. The water level of the river varies with the seasons and the precipitation; the spring flood occurs in March or April.  Geography  The Maheu river originates in a forest area at the mouth of a very small unidentified lake (length: less than a hundred meters; altitude: ), in Saint-Pierre-de-l'√éle-d'Orl√©ans. This source is located a hundred meters southwest of the Route des Pr√™tres, southeast of the village center of Saint-Pierre-de-l'√éle-d'Orl√©ans, southeast of the Chenal de l'√éle d'Orl√©ans and northeast of the shore of St. Lawrence River (chenal des Grands Voiliers). From this source, the course of the Maheu river descends on , with a drop of , according to the following segments: * north-east in a forest zone in Saint-Pierre-de-l'√éle-d'Orl√©ans, first by crossing the Route des Pr√™tres, by collecting a stream (coming from the southwest), to a bend in the river corresponding to a stream (coming from the north); * first towards the east in the forest zone by entering Saint-Laurent-de-l'√éle-d'Orl√©ans, towards the east by entering the agricultural zone , by bending to the north and collecting a stream (coming from the south) before entering Saint-Jean- de-l'√éle-d'Orl√©ans, up to a bend in the river; * towards the south-east in the agricultural zone by forming a loop towards the east, then crossing a series of rapids until its mouth.Atlas of Canada - Department of Natural Resources Canada - Maheu River - Distance and altitude measurements established from the application of site measurements. The Maheu river flows at the bottom of the Rade Maheu in Saint-Jean-de-l'√éle-d'Orl√©ans, that is to the limit of Saint- Jean-de-l'√éle-d'Orl√©ans (northeast side) and Saint-Laurent-de-l'√éle-d'Orl√©ans (southwest side). This harbor is spanned a hundred meters further by the route 368 bridge. This harbor whose sandstone of about at low tide, is attached to Chenal des Grands Voiliers whose width is at this location and is crossed by the St. Lawrence River.  Toponymy  The toponymic designation \\"river Maheu\\" evokes the memory of Ren√© Maheu, pilot on the river, whose concession was granted to him in 1651. Originally from Paris, Maheu was nephew of the first pioneer of New France, Louis H√©bert. Ren√© Maheu was present in Acadia in 1610 and 1612; a first concession in New France was granted to him in 1637. Ren√© Maheu married May 23, 1648 in La Rochelle, in France, to Marguerite Courivault (Corriveau).Marriage contract of May 23, 1648 passed in La Rochelle, between Ren√© Maheu and Marguerite Courivault (Corriveau). Following the death in 1661 of the pioneer Maheu, his fiefdom was passed on to his son Jean-Paul Maheu.Conseil Souverain, Nouvelle-France, March 29, 1664, order to convene the parents and friends of the minor children of Ren√© Maheu (Maheust) to choose a tutor and substitute tutor for them. Marguerite Corriveau was appointed tutor of the minor children of Ren√© Maheu (Maheust).Sovereign Council, New France, Appointment of Marguertie Corriveau as guardian of minor children. According to a plan of 1659, the Maheu fief included the watercourse designated \\"Saint- Louis river\\" on √éle d'Orl√©ans. Formerly, this river drained a swamp locally designated \\"Lac √† Maheu\\". In 1689, the lake at Maheu and the river of the same name appear on a geographical plan. Due to the digging of streams, this marsh has dried up throughout history, and this toponym has disappeared from geographic maps. Thus, the name of the owner of the fief has supplanted that of \\"Saint-Louis river\\" in popular usage.Source: Names and places of Quebec, work of the Commission of toponymy published in 1994 and 1996 in the form of a printed illustrated dictionary, and in that of a CD-ROM carried out by the company Micro-Intel, in 1997, from this dictionary.

He is the Joseph Silbert Dean of Engineering at the Cornell University College of Engineering and will become the inaugural vice president and executive director of the new Virginia Tech Innovation Campus.  Education  As a rising high-school senior (from Westbury, New York) in 1976, Collins participated in the Minority Introduction to Engineering (MITE) Program at Lafayette College, where he discovered his interest in engineering. Collins was accepted at Cornell University, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Collins graduated with a BSE in chemical engineering from Princeton University in 1981 and earned a MS in 1983 and a PhD in 1987 in chemical engineering, both from the University of Pennsylvania. Collins was the second African-American to graduate in chemical engineering from Princeton University (one year after Cato T. Laurencin) and the first African-American to receive a PhD from the University of Pennsylvania's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. As a graduate student, Collins earned a Cooperative Research Fellowship at Bell Laboratories.  Career  In 1989, Collins was a postdoctoral scholar at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where he worked with Francis H. Harlow. Collins served as professor of chemical engineering at Pennsylvania State University for 11 years. In 1998, he was a visiting scientist at the Laboratoire de Combustion et Systemes Reactifs in Orl√©ans, France and at Los Alamos National Laboratory. Collins joined Cornell University as a faculty member in 2002. Collins became the first African American director of the Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and later the first African American dean at Cornell University. After serving as S. C. Thomas Sze Director of the Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Collins became Dean of Engineering at Cornell University in 2010. As dean, Collins nearly doubled the proportion of underrepresented minority students (to 21%), while undergraduate female enrollment grew to 50%. He also took on a central role in establishing of Cornell Tech on Roosevelt Island in Manhattan, New York City in 2011. During Collins' tenure as dean, the college of engineering secured the two largest gifts in its history: a $50 million gift to name the Meinig School of Biomedical Engineering and a $50 million gift to name the Smith School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. After two terms as Joseph Silbert Dean of Engineering at Cornell, Collins will join Virginia Tech as the inaugural vice president and executive director of the new Innovation Campus in Alexandria, Virginia on August 1, 2020. Together with Gilda Barabino, Collins founded the Minority Faculty Forum in 1995. In 2006, they co-organized the Minority Faculty Development Workshop. Collins served as chair of the U.S. National Committee on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (USNC/TAM) in 2010‚Äì2012. Collins was elected Member-at-Large of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences Engineering Section in 2014. Until May 2020, he served on the Alan T. Waterman Award Committee for the National Science Foundation. Collins has been a member of the board of trustees of the Mitre Corporation since 2018. He is currently a member of the Leadership Advisory Board of the University of Michigan College of Engineering.  Research  Collins conducts research on turbulent processes with numerical simulations, for example in flames. He studies turbulent coagulation of aerosol particles, the turbulent breakup of microstructures such as in droplets or red blood cells, and drag reduction due to polymer additives. Collins is also developing new models to describe such microturbulence processes.

On May 31, 1952, the school was reopened with the reconstruction of the classrooms, being called Dr. Francisco Machado Lyceum (in portuguese: Liceu Dr. Francisco Machado; LFM), by means of Law No. 43330 of November 18, 1952. As of October 1, 1960, the Ministry of Overseas also assigned the high school the functions of a technical school, being able to issue diplomas of commerce and agriculture, under a coeducation regime (tutored jointly by the Government of Timor and the Diocese of Dili). At the height of the mid-1960s, the institution still housed mostly Portuguese children, with very few Timorese having access to education, a situation that would change only from 1972/1973. With the advent of the educational reforms of the 1970s, the first democratic ones, the LFM is totally under the control of the State, excluding the joint tutelage of the Catholic Church. Indonesian occupation period In 1975, when FRETILIN proclaimed the independence of Timor, the LFM had around 300 students. However, it was still the only high school institution in the new country. The Indonesian invasion and subsequent occupation was harmful to education in East Timor, primarily because it destroyed all educational establishments (including the Lyceum), and; secondly, because it excluded the Timorese population from access to formal education, making it possible, in 1999, to register the frightening indicator that 90% of the population was illiterate.Freitas, Jo√£o C√¢ncio.

In 1979, the Indonesian Ministry of Education refunds the high school (setting it up in its old building) giving it the name of Public School of Middle Education (in indonesian: Sekolah Pendidikan Guru Negeri; SPGN). The institution was reformulated, in the principles of pancasila, so that it trained secondary school students and also technicians in teaching, forming two distinct sections.Guterres, Guilherme Bonif√°cio.

Its principle is to confine ecosystems in totally or partially waterproof enclosures (i.e. waterproof in material but not in energy) capable of generating a range of physical and chemical conditions applied to terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems, continental or marine. Environmental control and real-time measurements are precise enough to test hypotheses or operating models. For this purpose, the enclosures are fitted with significant equipment allowing continuous measurement of fluxes, states or biological characteristics. Other specific measurements, in situ and ex situ, on samples taken complete these online measurements. A sufficient number of independent confinement chambers is necessary to study several interacting factors in a framework of statistical inferenceUn √âcotron pour mesurer les impacts des changements environnementaux sur les √©cosyst√®mes.

She was twice held in prison. Her work with the poor and to assist political prisoners led to her becoming known as ‚Äúmother courage‚Äù. She was born as Maria Eug√©nia de Bilnstein Sequeira in √âvora, Portugal on 18 December 1925. Her father and grandfather were soldiers, her grandfather being a General. She had six brothers. When she was four, the family moved to Cascais, living in the house that subsequently became the Cascais Municipal Library. After completing school, she enrolled in a technical college in 1940 but only stayed there for six months. In 1942 she entered Portugal‚Äôs Social Services Institute and received lessons from Father who contributed significantly to the development of her political ideas. He had started out as a supporter of the dictatorship and was elected to the National Assembly, but later became increasingly uncomfortable due to his commitment to combating poverty. She took his side, unsuccessfully, when the Portuguese dictator, Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar wanted to remove him from his position in the Institute. Her initial work experience as a social worker included a posting at a cork factory in Seixal and in the Bairro da Boavista, a newly constructed area of Lisbon populated mainly by the very poor. Maria Varela Gomes married Captain (later Colonel) in 1951 and they had four children, two girls and two boys. He was also very active in the opposition to the dictatorship. In 1956 she was appointed as Head of Social Services at Santa Maria hospital in Lisbon, now the city‚Äôs largest hospital, but was forced to leave after two years because of her political stance against the Estado Novo. She campaigned actively for the candidature of Humberto Delgado in the 1958 Presidential elections. In March 1959 she was involved with the failed coup, known as the Revolta da S√©, which was frustrated by the Portuguese secret police, the PIDE. She was investigated but not arrested and subsequently closely monitored the trial and imprisonment of some of those involved. On New Year‚Äôs Eve 1961 about 20 soldiers and civilians stormed the army barracks at Beja in an attack supported by Humberto Delgado. The attack was repelled and Delgado went into exile. Among the attackers injured was Varela Gomes‚Äô husband. A few days later she was arrested by the PIDE, not knowing at the time whether her husband was alive, and held in prison in isolation until the middle of April 1962. For some of the time she was subjected to sleep deprivation as a form of torture. Interviewed later in her life she stated that she managed to stick to her determination to deny knowledge of the planned assault in Beja while at the same time indicating her full support for the overthrow of the Estado Novo. She repeated over and over again, ‚ÄúI did not participate in either the preparation or the assault on the Beja Barracks, but I am heart and soul with my husband and his companions‚Äù. For most of her imprisonment she was held in Caxias prison, together with many well-known members of the Portuguese communist party. However, she never, herself, joined any political party. She was released from prison in 1964 after eighteen months but, following a trial in 1964, her husband was sentenced to six years. After being released she joined the Patriotic Front for National Liberation, working with the future President of Portugal Jorge Sampaio. In 1967 Varela Gomes visited London for contacts with the exiled Frente Portuguesa de Liberta√ß√£o Nacional (FPLN ‚Äì Portuguese Front for National Liberation), which had been set up by Delgado. The following year she worked at the Seara Nova magazine, being unable to take up a Government job. She also went to Paris for an FPLN meeting attended by Jorge Sampaio, √Ålvaro Cunhal, Virg√≠nia Moura, and others. In 1969 she was a co-founder of the National Commission for Relief for Political Prisoners (Conselho Nacional de Socorro aos Presos Pol√≠ticos - CNSPP). In 1970 she was again arrested; this time only for a week. In 1973 during the campaign for the National Assembly election she was brutally beaten by the police in front of her younger daughter. Following the Carnation Revolution, which deposed the Estado Novo on 25 April 1974, she worked with lawyers and the CNSPP to secure the immediate release of all political prisoners. As a result of the overthrow of the Estado Novo she was offered compensation for the jobs she lost because of her political beliefs. Despite being poor, she refused. Following the failed Coup of 25 November 1975 (usually referred to as the ' in Portugal), which was an attempt by Portuguese left-wing activists to replace the Portuguese transition to democracy in favour of Communism,√Ålvaro de Vasconcelos and Maria Jo√£o Seabra (eds.); Francisco Seixas da Costa...

After a coup in Angola in 1976 the couple moved to Mozambique. They returned to Portugal in 1979 as a result of an amnesty for her husband. Varela Gomes died on 27 November 2016 at the age of 90. She was survived by her husband and their two daughters, the sons both having pre-deceased her.

It was passed by Parliament on 11 April 1962 and prohibits people from begging or encouraging children who are under the age of 16 to beg. The law came into effect in 2018. If a person is caught breaking the law, they can be fined up to ‡§∞‡•Ç70 Nepali rupees (NPR) (equivalent to US$0.55 in 2020) or face imprisonment for three months. The act will not apply to someone if \\"it requires begging alms as per the religious rites and rituals or custom in any festival, or religious ceremony or festivity\\". When a person makes a complaint and fails to give sufficient evidence to prove they are guilty, they might be fined up to ‡§∞‡•Ç40 NPR (equivalent to US$0.30 in 2020), or be jailed for about one and a half months or both. The act's preamble reads: \\"Whereas, it is expedient to prohibit the tradition of beggary in order to maintain good conduct and morality of general public\\". In 2014, there were about 5,000 beggars in the capital of Nepal. In 2019, Kathmandu Metropolitan City's mayor Bidya Sundar Shakya made an announcement to shelter vagabonds and homeless people in ashrams located in Kathmandu to make the streets free from beggars. In 2014, Dipak Bayalkoti of The Kathmandu Post wrote that by not enforcing this act, it created a rapid population of beggars, especially in Kathmandu. In 2017, the Act Relating to Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2074 listed that \\"no person shall engage a person with [a] disability in begging\\". In August 2018, the Government of Nepal passed a new version of the Criminal Code and Criminal Procedures Code that bans people from begging and encouraging someone to beg in the streets. The charges include being jailed for one month to a year to someone if they are found begging in public areas.

According to the Phoenix Police, a trooper was patrolling when he discovered Johnson's vehicle parked in the gore point near Loop 101 and Tatum Boulevard. The trooper approached the vehicle and found Johnson asleep at the drivers seat, with cans of beer and a gun in the car, after removing the gun, the trooper attempted to arrest Johnson. According to the officer, an altercation occurred when Johnson woke up and grabbed at the officer, the officer drew his weapon and ordered Johnson to comply with instructions, Johnson complied and then as the officer holstered his weapon, Johnson lunged for the weapon. Another altercation ensued in the struggle, resulting in the officer allegedly firing his weapon twice, with one bullet fatally striking Johnson. Johnson later died at the hospital. Police stated there was neither body camera nor car camera footage, and the trooper was not wearing a body camera. However, significant evidence, including several eye witnesses, have corroborated what Trooper Cervantes said happened  People involved  Dion Johnson was a prohibited possessor of firearms due to past criminal charges and had recently been released from the Arizona Department of Corrections several months prior. George Cervantes is a Public Safety Trooper who was identified as the trooper involved in the shooting, and a fifteen year veteran of the force.  Incident  According to the Phoenix Police account, a trooper was patrolling when he discovered Johnson's vehicle parked at the triangle piece of land between the freeway and on/off ramp, near Loop 101 and Tatum Boulevard. The trooper approached the vehicle and found Johnson asleep at the drivers seat, with cans of beer and a gun in the car, after removing the gun the trooper returned to his motor unit to wait for a backup officer. Trooper Cervantes then noticed Johnson begin to move around in the vehicle. Fearing Johnson would attempt to drive off and endanger the public, he attempted to arrest him. An altercation occurred when Johnson woke up and grabbed at Trooper Cervantes, who drew his firearm to force Johnson to comply. Johnson initially complied so Trooper Cervantes holstered his weapon. At this time Johnson lunged forward and grabbed a hold of Trooper Cervante's vest. Fearing he would be pushed into oncoming traffic, Trooper Cervantes drew his weapon and fired two shots, striking Johnson once. Trooper Cervantes removed Johnson from the vehicle and placed him into handcuffs, per proper procedure while waiting for backup to arrive to provide traffic control for emergency vehicles staging nearby,  Investigation  Officials have placed the trooper who shot Johnson on paid administrative leave. The department also stated there is no dashcam video as both troopers involved were motorcycle officers and were not equipped with body cameras. However, video footage was later released from a live-feed Arizona Department of Transportation camera that was recorded by a local news station after the incident took place.  Aftermath  The Arizona Department of Public Safety erected fencing around its headquarters in Phoenix in late May 2020 in order to stop a vigil for Johnson on the grounds. The fencing has since been turned into a community mural of posters, cardboard and paper signs that were fixed to the fencing with string and tape. Johnson's death was protested by Black Lives Matter protestors along with the death of George Floyd. On June 7, protestors had held 11 days of daily marches in Phoenix to demand change and chanted for six minutes straight to highlight the time that medical aid was withheld from Johnson even with an ambulance stationed a few hundred feet away.  Response  The family of Johnson and their attorney Jocquese Blackwell, have questioned how a man who was sleeping in his vehicle and disarmed could end up being killed, emphasizing the lack of body cameras, police cameras, or other witnesses to corroborate the sole police account of the incident. Arizona State Representative Reginald Bolding, has demanded more transparency in the case and sent a letter to the public safety department. He later issued a statement to the US Department of Justice to take over the investigation, that was cosigned by Representative Doctor Geraldine Peten and Arizona Commissioner Sandra Kennedy.

He is considered a political prisonerhttps://www.rferl.org/a/potential-lukashenka-challenger-remanded-in- custody-as-belarus-election- nears/30698959.htmlhttps://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/EUR4926202020ENGLISH.pdf after having his candidacy rejected, followed by being detained by the Belarusian government over charges of \\"illegal [financial] activities\\" that are considered to be politically motivated. Life and career Babaryka was born on 9 November 1963 in Minsk. In 1981, he graduated from secondary school No. 92 of Minsk. In 1988, he graduated from the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of the Belarusian State University, in 1995 ‚Äì the Academy of Public Administration under the aegis of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus. Five years later, he finished master courses at the Belarusian State Economic University. Babaryka has been working in the banking system of Belarus since July 1995. In July 2000, he was appointed as the Chairman of the Management Board of Belgazprombank. On 12 May 2020, he voluntarily resigned as Chairman of the Management Board of Belgazprombank and declared his intention to participate in the 2020 Belarusian presidential election. On 19 June 2020, Babaryka was detained. The detainment is believed to be politically motivated. Amnesty International considers Babaryka, his son and several other arrested opposition figures to be prisoners of conscience.Belarus: Growing Crackdown on Human Rights Ahead of Presidential Electionhttps://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/EUR4926202020ENGLISH.pdf Philanthropist In 2008, Viktar Babaryka became one of the founders of the International Children's Charity Foundation \\"Chance\\". The Foundation has been providing charity support to seriously ill children. In 2018, on the initiative of Babaryka, Belgazprombank financed the publication of 15,000 copies of Svetlana Alexievich's five-volume edition and donated them to Belarusian libraries. With the support of Viktar Babaryka, the original of Francysk Skaryna's Bible, as well as the paintings of Marc Chagall, Chaim Soutine and L√©on Bakst were returned to Belarus. Viktar Babaryka also came up with a proposal to create an art-space OK16 organising exhibitions and theatrical performances.  Running for the presidency  On 8 May 2020, the House of Representatives of the National Assembly set the Presidential election in the Republic of Belarus on 9 August 2020. On 12 May, Viktar Babaryka expressed the wish to run for the Presidency, and on 20 May he registered the second biggest initiative group that included 8,904 persons. The candidacy of Babaryka was publicly supported by Belarusian cultural figures including Nobel Prize laureate Svetlana Alexievich and director Andrej Kurejchyk. On 17 June, philosopher Uladzimir Matskevich (previously supporting the boycott of the election) left his signature to endorse Babaryka's running for presidency as a sign of solidarity with all the people who were persecuted during the election campaign and to encourage the opponents of Alexander Lukashenko‚Äôs regime to unite around Babaryka, who had become the de facto leader of the Belarusian opposition. Apart from that, two former presidential candidates of the 2010 election also spoke out in support of Viktar Babaryka: Uladzimir Nyaklyayew (13 June) and Andrei Sannikov (15 June). At the end of May, Internet polls showed that Viktar Babaryka was ranking first with more than 50% support. In view of such results, Belarusian authorities recategorized website surveys as equivalent to national public opinion polls, which can only be conducted by institutions with a special accreditation (not a single media agency possesses such an accreditation); electoral ratings of politicians have not been published in the country since 2016. On 31 May, Viktar Babaryka presented the Declaration of Fair Elections. According to Belarusian legislation, in order to be registered as a presidential candidate, a person has to submit 100,000 signatures in his/her support ‚Äì the initiative group gathered the needed amount by 6 June. By 9 June, Babaryka broke the record of Zianon Pazniak by gathering 230,000 signatures. By 19 June, Babaryka's team reported 425,000 signatures gathered. On 17 June, the bank account of Babaryka's electoral fund in Belarusbank was blocked. According to the election team, more than 100,000 BYN were frozen (approx. US$42,000). On 20 June, Babaryka's team submitted the whole package of documents, including the needed amount of signatures, to the Central Election Commission of Belarus. On 14 July 2020, Babaryka was denied the registration as a candidate for presidency. A number of political scientists believe that, by doing so, the Chairperson of the Central Election Commission of Belarus deliberately violated the Constitution under the direction of incumbent President Lukashenko.  Criminal prosecution  On 11 June 2020, a government search and seizure campaign started in Belgazprombank. Three members of Babaryka's initiative group, including the coordinator in Mogilev Region, former vice- mayor of Mogilev Uladzimir Dudarau, were detained. On the next day, the State Control Committee of the Republic of Belarus announced that 15 former and current employees of Belgazprombank had been detained. The committee's Department of Financial Investigation brought a criminal case pursuant to part 2 of Article 243 ‚ÄúTax and duties evasion on a massive scale‚Äù and part 2 of Article 245 ‚ÄúMoney laundering on a massive scale‚Äù. At first, Viktar Babaryka was not targeted by the investigation, but, according to the Head of State Control Committee Ivan Tertel, the investigation team had ‚Äúsolid evidence of Babaryka‚Äôs involvement in illegal activities‚Äù and ‚Äúmost of the detainees are cooperating with the investigating authorities and making confessions‚Äù. Babaryka himself maintained that the investigation had no actual compromising materials and that the criminal case had purely political implications ‚Äì this statement was indirectly confirmed by Alexander Lukashenko who said that ‚Äúhe had commissioned the State Control Committee to inspect the activities of Belgazprombank‚Äù. The lawyers of the NGO ‚ÄúPravovaja Initsiativa‚Äú (‚ÄúLegal Initiative‚Äù) declared that the claims of the State Control Committee, the President and his press-secretary about Babaryka's complicity and the guilt of persons detained within Belgazprombank case were unacceptable and crudely violated human rights, and was only intended to cut off Babaryka's presidential bid. On 18 June 2020, Viktar Babaryka and his son and head of the initiative group Eduard Babayka were detained ‚Äì later on it was reported that Babaryka had been arrested and sent to the Pre-Trial Detention Centre of the KGB of Belarus. According to the key charges, over a couple of years Belgazprombank had transferred more than 430 million dollars from its account to Latvia, and Viktar Babaryka was the ‚Äúmastermind behind the crime‚Äù. Starting from 19 June, the case has been investigated by the State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus (KGB), as the defendants ‚Äúput at risk national security interests‚Äù. On 20 June, charges were pressed against Viktar Babaryka, and on the following day, against his son Eduard. In both cases the grounds for arrest were kept secret. Viktar and Eduard Babaryka are kept in custody in the Pre-Trial Detention Centre of the KGB of Belarus. On 29 June 2020, Amnesty International recognized Viktar and Eduard Babaryka, as well as a number of Lukashenko's opponents, as prisoners of conscience. On 2 July 2020, it was reported that Viktar Babaryka was accused of criminal offence pursuant to part 2 of Article 243 (tax and duties evasion on a massive scale), part 2 of Article 245 (money laundering on a massive scale) and part 2 of Article 431 (recurrent bribery or bribery on a massive scale) of the Belarusian Criminal Code. On 3 July, during a closed session Minsk City Court considered and dismissed Babaryka's complaint about the decision of the Court of Central District to keep him in custody. On 10 October 2020, Lukashenko spoke with the imprisoned Babaryka, his son Eduard, and fellow candidate Sergei Tikhanovsky in a four-hour meeting concerning changes to the Constitution. Babaryka's election campaign coordinator Yuriy Voskresensky was subsequently released and spoke against public protests on state television. Babaryka campaign manager Maria Kalesnikava refused to attend this meeting. She and Babaryka remain in custody at this time.https://polit.ru/news/2020/10/13/babariko/ Public opinion According to unofficial Internet polls, at least half of respondents were ready to support Babaryka in the upcoming presidential election over incumbent Alexander Lukashenko (assuming his candidacy would be allowed).Telegraf.by Personal life=Family His wife Marina died on 15 August 2017.

In Cartesian coordinate system, it can be denoted as :\\\\frac{e^{-j k_0 r}}{r}=\\\\frac{1}{j 2\\\\pi} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} dk_x dk_y e^{-j(k_x x + k_y y)} \\\\frac{e^{-jk_z z}}{k_z} where k_x, k_y and k_z are the wavenumbers in their respective coordinate axes: :k_0=\\\\sqrt{k_x^2+k_y^2+k_z^2} The expansion is named after Hermann Weyl, who published it in 1919. Weyl identity is largely used to characterize the reflection and transmission of spherical waves at planar interfaces; thus, it is often used to derive the Green's functions for Helmholtz equation in layered media. The expansion also covers evanescent wave components. It is often preferred to the Sommerfeld identity when the field representation is needed to be in Cartesian coordinates. The resulting Weyl integral is commonly encountered in microwave integrated circuit analysis and electromagnetic radiation over a stratified medium; as in the case for Sommerfeld integral, it is numerically evaluated. As a result, it is used in calculation of Green's functions for method of moments for such geometries. Other uses include the descriptions of dipolar emissions near surfaces in nanophotonics, holographic inverse scattering problems, Green's functions in quantum electrodynamics and acoustic or seismic waves.

Songs on the album feature appearances from rappers Trippie Redd, Amin√©, Gucci Mane and Don Toliver as well as production from Dylan Brady, Take a Daytrip, Avedon and Tay Keith. Singles preceded by the album's official release include \\"iPhone\\", \\"Own It\\" and \\"Don't Like Me\\" (featuring Gucci Mane and Don Toliver). Background and recording Rico Nasty first revealed the title \\"Nightmare Vacation\\" to Coveteur in September 2019, without distinguishing whether it would be a mixtape or an album. In October 2019, she told Complex that the album was supposed to be released in that year but she held it off \\"because of factors that she doesn't explicitly divulge.\\" Instead, she released the collaborative mixtape Anger Management (2019) with Kenny Beats, as well as a string of several non-album singles to supposedly \\"hold fans over\\". Talking to NME about the time spent during her creative process and the self-doubt it causes, Rico Nasty said, \\"I made Anger Management in a week. I made Nasty (2018) and Sugar Trap (2017) in around three months. I made Tales Of Tacobella (2017) in a month [...] I made this album [Nightmare Vacation] in a year. I hope that I'm not one of the people that overperfected it and took away what [the fans] enjoyed.\\" In June 2020, Rico Nasty tweeted the words \\"Nightmare vacation\\" with two photographs which could potentially be the album cover. She formally announced the album on August 13, 2020, alongside the release of its lead single, \\"iPhone\\". She subsequently released a makeup palette as a collaboration with Il Makiage, and later confirmed that names of the shades will be titles of the tracks in the album. In a letter directed to her fans, Rico Nasty explained that the project's title is a metaphorical oxymoron: \\"[...] understand that anything you want you can achieve! But know that there will be good and bad with everything. That's why this album is called Nightmare Vacation. Sometimes the things you want aren't the things you need.\\" In September 2020, Rico Nasty revealed that the album was prepared for imminent release in that month. She told Complex that it will be released in \\"spooky season\\" (September ‚Äì October), but not exactly on the day of Halloween.  Composition  Musically, Kyann-Sian Williams of NME described the album simply as \\"sugar trap [genre] on steroids\\". John Ochoa of The Recording Academy also noted that tracks like \\"Come Over\\" and \\"Loser\\" both \\"show a little bit of a softer side with some R&B; melodies.\\" Rico Nasty herself described the album as \\"a more evolved version of Sugar Trap [2016 mixtape], because it's good and bad\\", and noted that unlike most of her existing repertoire, \\"there are no rock cadences on it. It's a vibe. It makes you feel good, makes you feel happy.\\" On the concept behind the album and its musical presence, she said: \\"Nightmare Vacation is your best and worst experience. In my case, it's music. [...] Nightmare Vacation is playing on those super aggressive sounds, along with these super melodic shapes.\\" Rico Nasty told Dazed that the album \\"is not based on one aesthetic\\" and that the album features \\"another voice\\" she has developed which is neither rap or rock. She continued: \\"it sounds natural. It's really fire. I'm happy that I locked myself in the studio and didn't give up on life.\\" Release and promotion On August 13, 2020, Rico Nasty released \\"iPhone\\" as the lead single off of Nightmare Vacation alongside its own music video. The second single, \\"Own It\\", also had its own music video and was released on September 17, 2020. Critical reception Prior to its release, both Los Angeles Times and Uproxx listed Nightmare Vacation as one of their most anticipated albums of fall 2020. Kyann-Sian Williams of NME wrote: \\"Channelling nostalgic noughties culture and sound while exuding turbulent modern production, Rico's studio debut solidifies her status as a singular talent\\", and noted the record \\"taps into the DIY freedom of 2017's underground Tales of Tacobella, but with a more refined approach\\".

Cashe's awarding is controversial, prompting significant subsequent debate and discussion of an upgrade of his award to the Medal of Honor.  Early life and education Cashe was born in Sanford, Florida on July 13, 1970. He was raised in Oviedo, Florida and attended Oviedo High School, graduating in 1988.  Career  Cashe enlisted in the U.S. Army following high school graduation in 1988. An infantryman, he served tours of duty in the 1991 Gulf War and in Iraq following the 2003 invasion prior to his tour with the 3rd Infantry Division.  Silver Star citation Acting as Platoon Sergeant of 1st Platoon of Alpha Company from Forward Operating Base Mackenzie, Sergeant First Class Cashe departed Forward Operating Base (FOB) Mackenzie October 17, 2005 on a route clearance mission in the city of Daliaya, Iraq. Cashe was in the lead Bradley Fighting Vehicle when it struck an Improvised Explosive Device, rupturing the vehicle's fuel cell, covering Cashe in fuel, and causing the vehicle to burst into flames. Cashe, initially slightly injured, exited the vehicle and assisted the vehicle's driver to exit the burning Bradley and extinguish the flames on his clothes. Six soldiers and an interpreter remained in the rear of the vehicle, which was in flames. Cashe moved to the rear of the vehicle and reached into the flames to remove injured soldiers, while his fuel-soaked uniform burned. Cashe rescued soldiers from the burning vehicle, returning multiple times to continue to pull troops from the burning vehicle, all the while afire himself. Cashe rescued 6 soldiers from the flames and refused medical evacuation until others were evacuated. The interpreter was killed in the action, with 10 soldiers wounded, 7 severely. Cashe was burned over 72% of his body. He succumbed to his injuries November 8, 2005 at Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, Texas. He was survived by his wife and children. Cashe is interred at Restlawn Cemetery in Sanford, Florida.  Legacy On July 19, 2014, a new Army Reserve center in Sanford, Florida was memorialized for Cashe. On May 11, 2019, the Oviedo Post Office was renamed in Cashe's honor. As of July 23, 2020, Alwyn Cashe's son, Andrew Cashe, graduated from the U.S. Army's One Station Unit Training (OSUT) for Infantry at Fort Benning in Georgia.  Campaign to upgrade Cashe's Silver Star to the Medal of Honor  Major General Gary Brito, Cashe's battalion commander at the time of the action, did not initially realize the extent of Cashe's injuries and the pain he must have been in when he nominated Cashe for the Silver Star award. Witnesses were evacuated for medical treatment and unavailable for statement. Brito subsequently submitted additional statements to the Army to justify upgrading Cashe's award to the Medal of Honor. Brito continues to support efforts to upgrade Cashe's Silver Star to the Medal of Honor On October 17, 2019, the 14th anniversary of Cashe's actions, three members of Congress wrote to Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy formally requesting an upgrade of Cashe's award to the Medal of Honor. The letter was authored by retired Navy SEAL Dan Crenshaw, former Special Forces officer Michael Waltz and Stephanie Murphy. On August 24, 2020 Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, agreed that Cashe's actions merit award of the Medal of Honor. thumb On September 22, 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed a bill, introduced by Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-FL), which would allow Cashe to finally receive the Medal of Honor. HR 8276 would waive a five-year time statute of limitations that has expired for normal consideration for Medal of Honor awards by directly authorizing the President to award the medal ‚Äúfor acts of valor during Operation Iraqi Freedom.‚Äù On September 28, 2020, Pittsburgh Steelers left tackle Alejandro Villanueva, a former US Army ranger, taped Cashe's name on the back of his helmet, covering the name of Antwon Rose Jr, who was killed by an East Pittsburgh policeman in June 2018. The team had previously decided to honor Rose. Villanueva stated his actions were intended to support the campaign to award Cashe the Medal of Honor.

Cabr√© developed her interests in archaeology at a young age, when she often accompanied her father , a prominent Spanish archaeologist, on expeditions to Peninsular Spain. She became his main collaborator in his fieldwork, and later published many works with him or on his behalf. In the 1930s, she became a prolific academic in archaeological excavation, documenting her activities in various journal publications and presenting them at international conferences. After the Spanish Civil War, she mostly retired from the field and was forbidden from teaching by the Francoist dictatorship. She returned to the field again in 1975, where she worked for thirty years until the end of her life. Cabr√© is considered to be the first woman in Spain to become a professional archaeologist, and was honoured in a 2018 parliamentary initiative as part of a \\"group of skilled young women who opened the university to many others and demonstrated that women can successfully enter traditionally masculine disciplines.\\"  Biography = Early life  Encarnaci√≥n Cabr√© Herreros was born on 21 March 1911 in Madrid, Spain, to a middle-class family with \\"deep Catholic roots.\\" Her father, , was a prominent Spanish archaeologist. The first six years of her life were spent in the house of her maternal grandparents in Santa Mar√≠a de Huerta. Her father could not own a house due to the intense nature of his work. In 1917, her family moved to Madrid, so that her father could conduct his research on Iberian culture at the . In Madrid, she was enrolled into the Colegio de Monjas del Sagrado Coraz√≥n, a school of the Sacred Heart, for her primary education. She entered the in 1921, where she studied for her baccalaureate until 1928. Later in 1921, she had her first experience with archaeological excavations when she visited Cantabria, where her father was completing an inspection of archaeological sites.  Early academic career  The necropolis at Las Cogotas, photographed by Cabr√© in 1930 Cabr√© began to work as her father's main collaborator with much of his fieldwork in 1927, when she was seventeen years old. She accompanied him on excavations in Peninsular Spain through her university education and until the Spanish Civil War, later becoming a co-author on the report of their results. She attended the Complutense University of Madrid from 1928 to 1932, where she obtained a degree in history. In September 1929, she attended the IV International Congress of Classical Archaeology in Barcelona, where she presented the only study conducted by a Spanish woman. She also attended the XV International Congress of Prehistoric Archaeology and Anthropology in Portugal in 1930. The same year, her portrait was included in publications by the Portuguese and French press which discussed the modernity of Spanish women. Cabr√© taught as a professor at the University of Madrid and the in Germany and Morocco, as well as on a hosted by the University of Madrid in 1933. However, the Francoist dictatorship forbade her from continuing her tenure at the University of Madrid. She became the only woman to have begun work on a doctoral thesis in the first three decades of the 20th century which she began after receiving a scholarship from the (an institution that managed the Center for Historical Studies). She used the scholarship to attend prehistory and ethnography courses at universities in Berlin and Hamburg in 1934 and 1935. There, she studied under German academics Leo Frobenius, , and . From 1934 to 1936, she travelled to France, Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Italy, and Switzerland as a part of a pedagogical initiative launched by Spanish government.  Postwar career  Through the peak of the civil war, from 1937 to 1939, Cabr√© finished her doctoral studies while working at the Center for Historical Studies under Manuel G√≥mez-Moreno Mart√≠nez. Her thesis focused on Iron Age weaponry in the Iberian Peninsula. After the war, in 1939, she was forced to retired from the field of archaeology due to family obligations, after marrying Francisco Mor√°n. She only intermittently published works, primarily in collaboration with her father. After her father died in 1947, she returned to the field, mainly to publish his work in various academic journals and conference proceedings from 1949 to 1959. She began to publish again in 1975, mainly in collaboration with her son Juan Mor√°n Cabr√©, and continued doing so until the end of her life. She died on 18 March 2005 in Madrid. Upon her death, she bequeathed her father's and her own archives to the Autonomous University of Madrid.  Legacy  In the first three decades of the 20th century, women were incompletely incorporated into professional archaeology and scarcely took part in excavations. According to archaeologist , women in this time period were viewed as \\"a disruptive and undesirable element\\" on excavations. Margarita D√≠az-Andreu, an archaeologist at the University of Barcelona, asserts that Cabr√© became an exception to this predominant view. Because Cabr√©'s father carried out most of the archaeological fieldwork in Spain during this time period, she was exposed to the field of archaeology and collaborated with her father on much of his fieldwork. In 2018, Unidas Podemos registered a proposal to the Government of Spain and the to rename a garden at Madrid's National Archaeological Museum after Cabr√©. The garden would be renamed as the Jard√≠n de Encarnaci√≥n Cabr√© in recognition of her role in the \\"group of young women who opened the university to many others and demonstrated that women can successfully enter traditionally masculine disciplines.\\" The proposal was unanimously approved by the Committee of Culture in the Congress of Deputies on 27 February 2019.

On October 20, 1939, Richard became the first Black woman to host her own television cooking show. Her show aired from October 1949 - November 1950 on local television station WDSU. Richard initially received her culinary education locally in New Orleans, and later in Boston where she attended the school founded by Fannie Farmer. She graduated in 1918 and returned to New Orleans where she opened her own catering business and several eateries. She opened a cooking school in 1937 in New Orleans specifically for Black students. In 1939, Richard self-published Lena's Richard's Cook Book. The cookbook made her the first Black author to feature New Orleans Creole cuisine. Early life Lena Richard (n√©e Paul) was born in New Roads, Louisiana on September 11, 1892 to Fran√ßoise Laurent and Jean-Pierre Paul. She was baptized as Marie Aurina Paul on October 9, 1892 and was one of six children. Culinary career Richard began her culinary training working as a domestic worker employed by the Vairin family of New Orleans. Alice and Nugent Vairin would later send Richard to the Fannie Farmer Cooking School in Boston. After graduation in 1918, Richard returned to New Orleans and started a catering business. During the next two decades, she started multiple businesses and also worked as a cook at the Orleans Club, an elite organization for white women. In 1937, Richard and her daughter, Marie, started a cooking school. As historian Ashley Young Rose writes, \\"Richard‚Äôs school targeted young black men and women. She sought to train them in the culinary sciences so as to give them a chance to make a career for themselves in a city that historically disenfranchised African Americans.\\" In 1939, Richard self-published Lena Richard‚Äôs Cook Book. A year later, Houghton- Mifflin reissued her book with a new title, New Orleans Cook Book. Although Richard's self-published book included an image of herself, the reissue did not, essentially erasing any connection to the author's heritage. While traveling to promote her book in the Northeast, Richard was recruited to be the head chef at Bird and Bottle Inn in Garrison, New York. Richard soonreturned to New Orleans and opened Lena's Eatery in November 1941. In 1945, Richard started a frozen food business, creating fully cooked packaged dinners that could be shipped anywhere in the United States. The meals were prepared by Bordelon Fine Foods Company. In 1949, Richard opened her last restaurant, The Gumbo House, which was one of the only Black-owned fine-dining establishments in the city at that time. Media career From 1949‚Äì1950, Richard hosted a 30-minute cooking television show called Lena Richard's New Orleans Cook Book. The show aired twice weekly and was broadcast on New Orleans' first television station, WDSU. During the program, Richard and her assistant, Marie Matthews, guided their television audience through recipes from Richard's cookbook. Richard and Matthews were the first African- Americans to host a cooking show in an age when few households owned television sets. Personal life Richard married Percival Richard in the 1920s. They had one daughter, Marie Richard, who graduated from Xavier University with a degree in Home Economics. Marie later helped her mother open her cooking school in New Orleans in 1937. Recognition In 2020, Richard was one of eight women featured in \\"The Only One in the Room\\" display at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. Bibliography * Lena Richard's Cook Book.

She moved to the United States in childhood, with her mother and stepfather. Roselle acted in Budapest and studied acting with Szidi R√°kosi as a young woman.  Career  Roselle sang in New York, with the Metropolitan Opera in 1920, as Musetta in La boh√®me. She sang for two years with the San Carlo Opera Company, was a guest soloist with the Minneapolis Orchestra, toured in the central United States in the 1922-1923 season, then moved back to Europe. She joined the Dresden Opera in 1925 to sing the title role in the first German performance of Puccinis's Turandot. She sang in Budapest, Milan, Vienna, London, Paris and Berlin, and was part of a radio broadcast of Verdi's Un ballo in maschera, with Maria Olszewska. She was also known for singing the title role in Verdi's A√Øda and Leonora in Il trovatore, among others. Roselle returned to the United States late in 1929, and sang at Carnegie Hall. The New York Times reported that \\"her higher tones are usually produced with fine resonance and color and absolute fidelity to the pitch\\". In 1931, she starred in the first United States performance of Wozzeck, with the Philadelphia Orchestra, under the direction of Leopold Stokowski. In 1934, she was back at Carnegie Hall, in Orfeo ed Euridice. and went to London to sing Turandot. In 1946, she sang in a diverse 'pop' concert at Carnegie Hall, sharing the program with Hungarian pianist Ern√∂ Balogh, Huddie Ledbetter, Mary Lou Williams, Tom Scott, Susan Reed, and others. She gave a recital in 1948 at New York's Town Hall performance space. After she retired from the stage, Roselle taught voice in Philadelphia. She was artist-in-residence at Florida Southern College in her later years, until she retired from teaching in 1967. Roselle made several recordings in Berlin in the 1920s. In 1934, she gave an interview decrying the effect of recorded music on live music. In 1971, she gave another interview, grateful to revisit the past through recordings.

Design and development  The N-1 was a development of an earlier flying wing bomber concept from 1937, when Jack Northrop worked for Douglas Aircraft Company at El Segundo, California. This concept featured a fuselage that protruded forward of the leading edge of the wing, two pusher propellers, and vertical stabilizers on the tips of the wings. Its engines were never specified, but its defensive armament was to consist of a nose and tail turrets. A wind tunnel model of the concept was built and tested, but the project was abandoned shortly after Northrop left Douglas. Northrop continued work on the bomber after he formed his own company, Northrop Corporation, in 1939. In response to the United States Army Air Corps' XC-219 specification, which called for a new high-altitude medium bomber, Northrop made several major changes to the design and gave it the model number N-1. The wing was now thicker, and the separate fuselage structure was dispensed in favor of incorporating the crew compartments into the airfoil. The vertical stabilizers were replaced with drooped wingtips with an anhedral of 35 degrees, which were apparently found to stabilize paper planes during tests conducted by Jack Northrop, his son John, and Moye Stephens on a stormy weekend. Details of the design varied greatly as the aircraft evolved, with an early version featuring a large greenhouse canopy and a single vertical stabilizer under the fuselage to act as a propeller guard. There were originally planned to be seven crew, later reduced to four, including two gunners manning forward-firing guns in the nose. Later, the stabilizer was deleted, with the anhedral of the wingtips increased to 40 degrees to make up for it, and a retractable tail wheel was added as a propeller guard instead. The greenhouse canopy was replaced with a bubble canopy protruding from the top of the wing. Defensive armament was to consist of four remotely operated turrets; one on the top and one on the underside of each wing. The proposed powerplant of the N-1 was originally a pair of Pratt & Whitney X-1800 liquid-cooled H24 engines. When development of the X-1800 ended in October 1940, Northrop proposed that the N-1 be powered by either the Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp or the Lycoming XH-2470. Although Northrop never received a contract to build the a full-scale N-1, the company did build a flying mockup as the N-1M. The N-1M was used mainly for research, but also served as the forerunner of the larger Northrop YB-35 and YB-49 bombers.

He had the chair of General Physiology and Neurobiology at the University of Pisa and worked with Giuseppe Moruzzi and Eric Kandel. Together with Kandel, he obtained the first demonstration of the role of the cyclic AMP as a second messenger in the transmission of the nervous impulse.. Biography In 1967 Brunelli graduated with honors in Medicine and Surgery at the University of Pisa. In the same year he began his research activity at the CNR Institute of Clinical Physiology and from 1969 to 1970 at the Institute of Neurophysiology, also in Pisa. From 1970 to 1974 he was assistant of Human Physiology at the Pisa Physiology Institute. Together with Franco Magni he published researches on the nervous system of the pigeon and the leech and on the hormonal mechanisms of light emission in fireflies. In the two-year period 1975-1976 he visited the United States, where he worked in the laboratories directed by Eric Kandel making a fundamental contribution to the studies on the intracellular mechanisms of nerve signal transduction, which will lead Kandel himself to win the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2000. In 1976 he returned to Italy and two years later became Professor of General Physiology at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Pisa. From 1983 to 1986 he took the place of Prof. Moruzzi at the head of the CNR Institute of Physiology in Pisa. In the following four years he was director of the Department of Physiology and Biochemistry of the University of Pisa. He currently lives in Pisa. Research activity Brunelli began his career as a scientific researcher by investigating the nervous and hormonal mechanisms that control the emission of the luminous signals of Luciola lusitanica and demonstrating their circadian rhythms. The results of these experiments were published in a series of papers on the Archives Italiennes de Biologie from 1968 to 1973. Other studies were on the nervous system of the leech Hirudo medicinalis and visual perception in the common pigeon. His research activity subsequently focused on the study of the neurobiological mechanisms of memory and non-associative learning in animal models. One of the main contributions of Brunelli was the identification of the cyclic AMP as the second messenger in nerve impulse transduction. In the mid-seventies it was known that serotonin acted on the terminals of sensory neurons by increasing the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft, but the mechanism of action was not known yet. Brunelli and colleagues injected cyclic AMP ‚Äì whose role as a mediating molecule was well established ‚Äì directly into the presynaptic terminal and observed that nerve transmission was facilitated. During the 1980s Brunelli continued his studies on the role of serotonin and intracellular calcium in synaptic modulation in the leech. The nervous system of this annelid consists of a chain of interconnected ganglia that contain relatively large and easily accessible neurons, lending itself well to electrophysiological recording. This has made it possible to make great progress in understanding the mechanisms of habituation and sensitization. In a series of experimental studies his group identified the role of acetyl-L-carnitine in influencing neuronal gene expression. Before retiring from academic life, Brunelli directed an interuniversity research group investigating the physiological and medical aspects of the trigeminal-cardiac reflex (TCR) associated with proprioceptive stimulation of the jaw. The TCR is a still poorly known vagal reflex activated by the stimulation of the trigeminal nerve that induces a sustained reduction of heart rate and mean arterial pressure . Brunelli and colleagues observed the activation of the reflex following mandibular stretching in humans. Further experiments on the rat have shown a concurrent vasodilation of pial arterioles  References  Category:Living people Category:Neurophysiologists Category:University of Pisa alumni Category:University of Pisa faculty ","title":"Marcello Brunelli"},{"id":"64237980","text":"Wolfram D√∂rinkel (September 5, 1907 - November 26, 1975) was a German politician of the Free Democratic Party (FDP) and former member of the German Bundestag.

Harwell is an American neuroscientist who is an assistant professor in the Department of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School.  Career  Harwell initially planned on pursuing a career in medicine, an early research experience in Cori Bargmann's laboratory led Harwell instead to the basic sciences and in particular to neurobiology. As a graduate student, Harwell conducted his thesis research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under Elly Nedivi. He studied the role of the gene cpg15 (candidate plasticity gene 15) and its protein product in neural development and plasticity. Cpg15 had been found to be a target of intracellular signaling pathways important for synaptic plasticity. Increases in cpg15 expression caused changes in axon and dendrite growth, as well as synapse formation. Harwell and his colleague Ulrich Putz showed that expression of a soluble form of CPG15 promoted survival of cortical neuron progenitors in early brain development. Additionally, Harwell, with members of Karel Svoboda's group, demonstrated that cpg15 expression in adult mice could be diminished by sensory deprivation, raising the possibility that CPG15 functions in a neural activity-dependent manner. After receiving his PhD, Harwell completed a postdoctoral fellowship in Arnold Kriegstein's laboratory at the University of California, San Francisco. There, Harwell investigated early neural development. He identified a role of the gene sonic hedgehog (shh) and its receptor, BOC1, in the formation of connections between layer II/III cortical neurons and their postsynaptic targets, the layer V corticalfugal neurons. Additionally, Harwell characterized the relationship between cell lineage and distribution of developing cortical interneuron circuits and found that cell lineage does not determine clustering of cortical interneurons Following his postdoctoral work, Harwell became an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School in the Department of Neurobiology. His laboratory continues to focus on neural development.  Research  The Harwell Lab investigates how the developmental origins and lineages of different neuron types affects their function in the adult brain. The lab approaches these questions using circuit tracing, molecular biology, and genetic tools in mice. Currently, the lab seeks to characterize the molecular diversity of neural progenitors and dissect the genetic and epigenetic programs that drive the differentiation of these progenitors and their assembly into functional neural circuits. Recently, the lab has uncovered important roles for glial cells in neural development as well.

History The company, founded in the early 1970s in downtown Manhattan and incorporated in Delaware, was a debt collection agency that paid a penny on the dollar for loans that sellers viewed as worthless, focusing on debts that people owed to hospitals, banks, and phone companies.

US, February 6, 2012.Alana Goodman and Daniel Halper (2020). A Convenient Death, Penguin Publishing Group. Jeffrey Epstein Hoffenberg hired Jeffrey Epstein in 1987 to help with the Towers Financial Corporation. Hoffenberg set Epstein up in offices in the Villard Houses in Manhattan, and paid him $25,000 ($ in current dollar terms) per month for his consulting work. They unsuccessfully tried to take over Pan Am in a corporate raid with Towers Financial as their raiding vessel. Their bid failed, in part because of the 1988 terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, which ultimately contributed to the airline's bankruptcy. A similar unsuccessful bid in 1988 was made to take over Emery Air Freight Corp. Between 1988 and 1993, Towers Financial raised over $400 million by selling bonds and promissory notes to investors, luring them in using false financial statements.United States Securities and Exchange Commission (September 17, 1996).\\"Litigation Release No. 15053 / Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No.816; SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. MICHAEL ROSOFF,\\" 96 Civ. 7064 (WK) S.D.N.Y. Hoffenberg and his associates then used the money they had raised to pay operating costs, repay earlier investors, and to pay themselves. Hoffenberg began using Towers Financial funds to pay for a lavish lifestyle that included a Locust Valley, Long Island mansion, homes on Sutton Place in Manhattan and in Florida, and a number of cars and planes. The Ponzi scheme was the largest financial fraud in American history prior to Bernie Madoff's being uncovered. In February 1993, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged that the company, while fraudulently reporting a profit of $13 million ($ in current dollar terms) for the four years ended June 30, 1991, actually lost $137 million ($ in current dollar terms). In March 1993, Towers Financial filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Hoffenberg pleaded guilty in April 1995 to five criminal charges, cheating thousands of investors out of $462 million, surrendered to the FBI in Manhattan, and was arraigned and released on bail. He was sentenced in 1997 by federal judge Robert W. Sweet to 20 years in prison, and was released in 2013, after serving 18 years. He was also sentenced to pay restitution of $462 million ($ in current dollar terms) and a $1 million fine. Towers Financial executives Mitchell Brater (Vice Chairman) and Michael Rosoff (chief legal officer) were handed prison sentences of seven to nine years, and Rosoff was disbarred.\\"In Re: Michael E. Rosoff,\\" July 6, 2000. Epstein was not charged. In July 2019, Hoffenberg claimed that Epstein was his ‚Äúuncharged co- conspirator‚Äù in the Ponzi scheme. Hoffenberg stated that he didn't turn in evidence against Epstein, mentioning Epstein \\"had traction with\\" The United States Department of Justice, and stated further, \\"You cannot grasp the magnitude of [Epstein's] controlling effect.\\" In 2020 Hoffenberg added some corroboration to evidence published in a 2019 book indicating that Epstein was a top-level spy for Mossad. Over three decades after the Towers Financial scandal and six years after his prison release Hoffenberg suggests an overall intelligence aspect to Epstein. He paints a picture of Epstein's long-term ability to avoid justice, stating this was enabled by being \\"needed by the CIA or the FBI for intelligence, because he was manipulating the American intelligence for the overseas organizations\\". In 2007-08 Epstein faced a serious portfolio of charges on statutory rape and sex trafficking although Florida Southern Attorney General Alexander Acosta agreed a Federal Non- Prosecution Agreement, reducing all charges to a single instance of solicitation of a girl under 18. This simultaneously shut down an FBI investigation into more victims and conspiring and associated powerful perpetrators of sex crimes. Hoffenberg references how Acosta stated publicly, ‚ÄúThis is an intelligence criminal case, this is not a standalone criminal case.‚Äù Epstein's perceived exemption from justice described by Hoffenberg continues after his death. The 2007-08 Non-Prosecution Agreement was retained on appeal in 2020, effectively for the moment preserving the block and preventing future investigation into circumstances, people and organisations surrounding Epstein in those earlier charges. Subsequently, in August 2020 an appeal court en banc review hearing of that decision has been ordered. Whilst Hoffenberg states that he was \\"double-crossed\\" by Epstein over the Ponzi scheme, he emphasised he has no \\"axe to grind\\" against Epstein but instead a \\"story to tell ... something to explain\\" over Epstein, about \\"his mindset, the profile, how Epstein saw things, and how he played the chess board\\". In 2020, a year after his alleged suicide while on detention in a Manhattan prison on new charges of sex trafficking involving minors, Epstein was described as having had a \\"major role\\" in the Towers Financial Ponzi scheme. It was reported by journalist Vicky Ward that Epstein was \\"pivotal\\" in designing how the scheme worked. In mid-2020 the American documentary mini-series Surviving Jeffrey Epstein claimed that Epstein was \\"at the absolute centre of the operation\\".

He served in World War II and the Cold War and saw colonial service in French North Africa. He was the last commander of French forces in Algeria, and completed his career as commander-in-chief of the French Forces in Germany. Biography=Early life and career Lecointe was born in Poitiers on 7 July 1912, the son of Capitaine (Captain) Henri Lecointe,Pierre Laffitte, Qui est qui en France, Volume 11, 1969 (in French). an Officer of the Legion of Honor. He attended high school in Douai, where he won eleven awards for excellence. He originally planned to attend the √âcole Polytechnique, but instead chose to attend the military academy at Saint-Cyr, which he entered in 1930 at the age of eighteen in the \\"Joffre class.\\" While at the school, he was promoted from cadet to aspirant in 1931. Lecointe graduated from Saint-Cyr in 1932 and was appointed sous-lieutenant (second lieutenant) in the 1st Regiment of Moroccan Tirailleurs, in which he took part in the final operations of the pacification of French Morocco in the Grand Atlas in 1933 and in southern Morocco in 1934. He received his baptism of fire at Iskerioul on 3 September 1933. World War II World War II broke out in September 1939, and Lecointe returned to France in October 1939 with the 1st Moroccan Division, in which he commanded the 2nd Company of the 1st Regiment of Moroccan Tirailleurs. During the \\"Phoney War\\" period, he took part in the outpost battles of December 1939 along the French border with Germany. During the Battle of France, he distinguished himself at the Battle of Gembloux in the vicinity of Gembloux, Belgium, on 14‚Äì15 May 1940, during which he was the last French officer to leave the soil of Gembloux when the high command ordered a retreat. He was seriously wounded near Lille on 24 May 1940 and was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour. The Battle of France ended with France‚Ä≤s surrender to the Germans on 22 June 1940. Lecointe resumed combat in 1942 as a company commander in the 7th Moroccan Infantry Regiment, operating as part of the Free French forces against German and Italian forces in Tunisia. At the head of his company, he distinguished himself during violent assaults on enemy positions in Tunisia in December 1942 and April 1943. He later participated in the battles of the Italian campaign with the French Expeditionary Corps in 1944 and with the French 1st Army in the Allied invasion of Southern France (Operation Dragoon) in August 1944 and the subsequent campaign in the Vosges and to the Rhine with the 1st Regiment of Moroccan Tirailleurs. Post-World War II After World War II, LeCointe returned to French Morocco. He was made an Officer of the Legion of Honor on an exceptional basis in 1948 and entered the √âcole sup√©rieure de Guerre (France‚Ä≤s war college) in 1949. Completing his studies there in 1951, he was promoted to commandant that year and posted to the general staff of the French Forces in Germany, where he served as head of the operations office until 1954. He then took command of the 24th Guard Chasseur Battalion, a unit of the French 5th Armored Division, at Bad Bergzabern, West Germany. In 1956, Lecointe left West Germany for Algeria, where he successively served as Chief of Staff of the Army Corps of Algiers and then for 30 months as commander of the Cherchell District. Made a Commander of the Legion of Honor on an exceptional basis in 1958, he left Algeria in 1959 for Fribourg, France, where he served as deputy to the general commanding the French 3rd Infantry Division. In 1960, he became auditor at Saint-Cyr at the Centre des hautes √©tudes militaires (Center for Advanced Military Studies, or CHEM) and the Institut des hautes √©tudes de d√©fense nationale (Institute for Advanced National Defense Studies, or IHEDN). Promoted to g√©n√©ral de brigade (brigadier general) in 1961, LeCointe returned that year to West Germany and took command of the 11th Mechanized Brigade at Landau and of the French Forces of the Palatinate. In 1963 he was promoted to g√©n√©ral de division, and from 1963 to 1964 he was in Algeria, where he commanded the 4th Infantry Division and the French Forces of the Levant and the Sahara. He was the last commander of the French forces in Algeria, which under his command totaled 40,000 men. In 1966, Leconte took command of the 8th Infantry Division at Compi√®gne, France, and then returned to Paris as first assistant to the military governor of Paris. In 1970, he was promoted to g√©n√©ral de corps d'arm√©e and succeeded General Jacques Massu as commander-in-chief of the French Forces in Germany, which under his command totaled 110,000 French personnel, including 73,000 soldiers and 38,000 civilians. He completed this tour in 1972 and retired from the French Army. Lecointe died on 30 January 2009 at La Baule-Escoublac, France. Personal life Lecointe was married to Matt√©a Celli.

Barabino is the president of the Olin College of Engineering, where she is also a Professor of Biomedical and Chemical Engineering. Previously, she served as the Dean of The Grove School of Engineering at the City College of New York, and as a professor in the Departments of Biomedical Engineering and Chemical Engineering and the CUNY School of Medicine.  Early life and education  Gilda Barabino was born in Anchorage, Alaska on May 28, 1956. Both her mother, Margaret Agnes Barnes Barnum, and her father, Norman Edward Barnum III, were originally from New Orleans, Louisiana. Barabino's father was in the US Army and stationed in Alaska at the time of her birth. The family moved frequently during her childhood. After her father retired, the family returned to New Orleans. Barabino's mother went back to school and became a nurse's aid, working at Charity Hospital. Her father took a job in the Veteran's Administration, while studying for a bachelor's degree in Business Administration from Southern University at New Orleans. Barabino began attending Xavier University of Louisiana while still in high school and continued on to complete her studies at Xavier after her high school graduation in 1974. When a high school teacher told her that girls could not become chemists, she decided to pursue an undergraduate degree in chemistry to prove the teacher wrong. Barabino enjoyed her time at the historically black university, since she was no longer the only black student in her classes and was encouraged academically. She graduated with a Bachelor of Science in chemistry with minors in biology and math in 1978. After finishing her degree, she enrolled in the Louisiana State University Dental School and applied for an Army Health Professions scholarship to cover the expenses. Barabino ended up leaving LSU after one year, after her professors refused to communicate with her and another black student, and she was told she would have to repeat her first year. The terms of her scholarship required her to serve in the army as a commissioned officer for three years, even though she did not finish her training. She served in a medical combat unit in Fort Lewis, Washington. After her mandatory service, Barabino applied to several PhD programs in Chemical Engineering and received a prestigious National Science Foundation graduate fellowship. She decided to pursue chemical engineering, since she was interested in medicine but did not want to be a clinician. She became the first African American admitted to the chemical engineering program at Rice University and only the fifth African American female in the U.S. to obtain a doctorate in chemical engineering. Her thesis work involved studying the abnormal flow of blood in sickle cell disease, a topic she picked because it disproportionately affects African Americans. She worked to understand the molecular mechanisms that cause red blood cells to stick together and adhere to the walls of blood vessels as they deform to pass through small capillaries in people with sickle cell disease. She received a PhD in 1986.  Career  After finishing her graduate studies, Barabino spent three years working as a chemical engineer at the Rohm and Haas, where oversaw the synthesis of acrylics and acrylates. However, she found that she missed basic research and wanted to work in areas with biomedical applications. In 1989, she became a faculty member at the Northeastern University Department of Chemical Engineering and a Senior Research Fellow Center for Biotechnology Engineering at Northeastern. She was the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education from 2000-2002 and rose to Full Professor in 2005. Together with Lance Collins, Barabino founded the Minority Faculty Forum in 1995. In 2006, they co- organized the Minority Faculty Development Workshop. In 2007 she moved to Georgia Tech, which was a center for sickle cell research. She was a professor in Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University, as well as the Associate Chair for Graduate Studies and the inaugural Vice Provost for Academic Diversity. In 2013 she became the Daniel and Frances Berg Professor and Dean of The Grove School of Engineering at The City College of New York, where she maintained an active research group. Her areas of research included sickle cell disease, cell and tissue engineering, as well as race, ethnicity and gender in science and engineering. On July 1, 2020, Barabino became the President of the Olin College of Engineering in Needham, Massachusetts.

It was completed in 1993.  Background  Your Rockaby was born after Turnage had spent some time in Tanglewood and as a composer-in-association at the CBSO. Even though he explored composing for the saxophone in his first opera, Greek, this was the first time Turnage wrote a concertante piece for saxophone. The concerto loosely bases its rhythmic structure on Samuel Beckett's play Rockaby. However, the link between these two works is only readily apparent thanks to their title. Since the piece is not scored for any voices, it includes no text from the play. The concerto was a BBC commission, composed between November 1992 and November 1993, with a hiatus between February and September 1993. The work was completed in Arsenal. It was first performed on February 23, 1994, at the Royal Festival Hall in London, by Martin Robertson at the soprano saxophone and the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Andrew Davis. The soloist saxophone part was specifically written for Robertson, who first became associated with Turnage in 1986 when he played Turnage's Sarabande for soprano saxophone and piano in his solo debut at the Purcell Room in London. It was published by Schott in 1995.  Structure  Turnage himself described the concerto as \\"a journey through the flamboyant landscape of gaudy jazz figures, with the sax desperately clutching its melodic sanity\\". It is set in a single, 24-minute movement, even though there are some recognizable sections in it, e. g., an accompanied cadenza and a passacaglia entitled Lullaby for Charlie close to the end of the piece (Charlie is Martin Robertson's son). The lullaby is an instrumental setting of the first lines of the one-woman original play by Beckett. It is scored for a solo soprano saxophone in B-flat with amplification, three flutes, two alto flutes, a piccolo, three oboes, two clarinets in B-flat, a bass clarinet, a contrabass clarinet in B-flat, two bassoons, a contrabassoon, four horns in F, three trumpets in C, two tenor trombones, a bass trombone, a tuba, a large percussion section for five percussionists (consisting of a brake drum, a large bass drum, a pedal bass drum, two bodhr√°ns, a sizzle cymbal, a woodblock, a large whip, a large untuned gong, a xylophone, a marimba, a vibraphone, crotales, hand bells, tubular bells, tuned cow bells, a djembe, two darabukas (or two large bongos), and a large saucepan), a cimbalom, a large ratchet, a harp, a piano, a celesta, and a large string section (consisting of sixteen first violins, sixteen second violins, twelve violas, twelve cellos, and eight double basses. The general tone of the composition is bluesy and dark, which is specified in the tempo markings used in the score and reinforced by the unusual percussion scoring of the piece, calling for bodhr√°ns (Irish traditional drums), darabukas (drums from the Middle East and North Africa) and the djembe (from West Africa). This was also noted by Andrew Clements's original The Guardian review, which had the headline Lullaby in Black.  Recordings  Despite its initial success, this piece has been performed very rarely. The only recording widely available is the authoritative version from the musicians who premiered the piece. It was recorded in November 25, 1995, at Abbey Road Studio No. 1. It was released on CD by both Argo and Decca.

The goal of the conference was to acknowledge the wide-spread use of traditional medicine, review the role of traditional healers in HIV prevention and care, and support collaboration between traditional medicine and biomedicine. This conference also led to the formation of an East and Southern African Regional Task Force on Traditional Medicine and HIV/AIDS in 2001Homsy, Jaco, et al. Defining Minimum Standards of Practice for Incorporating African Traditional Medicine into HIV/AIDS Prevention, Care, and Support: A Regional Initiative in Eastern and Southern Africa. p. 6.. The task force involved 9 members from East and Southern African NGOs (Traditional Health Practitioners Association of Zambia and Zimbabwean National Traditional Healers Association), international organizations (UNAIDS, WHO/AFRO, Global Initiative for Traditional Systems), and observers from Ghana, Nigeria, and Cameroon.Amzat, Jimoh, and Ali Abdullahi. ‚ÄúRoles of Traditional Healers in the Fight against HIV/AIDS.‚Äù Ethno-Med, vol. 2, July 2008.

Traditional healers performing a successful Cesarean section as observed by R. W. Felkin in 1879 (present day Kahura, Uganda)  Traditional Medicine in Uganda = History  Before the Colonial Era, traditional medicine was the only health system in Uganda. During the Colonial Era from 1894 to 1962, traditional medicine was suppressed as it was negatively seen as \\"backwards\\" and \\"witchcraft\\", and the legitimacy of healthcare practice was placed on colonial biomedicine. Gradually, there have been attempts to provide support to traditional healers, legally recognize traditional medicine practice in Uganda, and move towards collaboration between the two practices.Yahaya, Sekaya, et al. ‚ÄúTraditional Medicine in Uganda: Historical Perspectives, Challenges, and Advances.‚Äù World Bank, 2004, documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/208041468121755812/pdf/312570iknt67.pdf. For example, since the early 1990s, the WHO has pushed for the inclusion of traditional medicine in national programs.Kayombo, Edmund J., Febronia C. Uiso, Zakaria H. Mbwambo, Rogasian L. Mahunnah, Mainen J. Moshi, and Yasin H.

HIV/AIDS  The Ugandan AIDS Control Programme of 1989 by the Ministry of Health promoted decentralization of AIDS prevention and control from the national level to the district level in order to increase coverage and effectiveness. This highlighted community-based approaches involving biomedical health staff, NGOs, religious groups, local village leaders, local AIDS committees, and traditional healers.Ankrah, E. Maxine. ‚ÄúAIDS and the Social Side of Health.‚Äù Social Science & Medicine, vol. 32, no. 9, Jan. 1991, pp. 967‚Äì80. ScienceDirect, . For people who were HIV-positive, traditional healers provided a local, familiar, and accessible option compared to biomedical personnel who were usually overbooked and located farther away.Liddell, Christine; Barrett, Louise; Bydawell, Moya (2005). \\"Indigenous representations of illness and AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa\\". Social Science & Medicine. Elsevier BV. 60 (4): 691‚Äì700. In the early 1980s in southwestern Uganda, it was reported that many locals infected with the disease (\\"Slim\\") after showing symptoms of diarrhea and weight-loss would initially consult traditional healers due to their belief in the connection between the disease and witchcraft.Iliffe, J.; Anderson, D.; Brown, C.; Clapham, C.; Gomez, M.; Manning, P.; Robinson, D. (1998). \\"10. AIDS\\". East African Doctors: A History of the Modern Profession. African Studies. Cambridge University Press. . Retrieved 8 June 2020. In local communities, traditional healers were seen as having a respected and credible role in treating physical, psychological, and spiritual aspects of health, serving approximately 80% of people seeking health care.Green, Edward C. ‚ÄúCan Collaborative Programs between Biomedical and African Indigenous Health Practitioners Succeed?‚Äù Social Science & Medicine, vol. 27, no. 11, Jan. 1988, pp. 1125‚Äì30. ScienceDirect, . Despite their influence, biomedical practitioners often distrusted their credibility and traditional healers lacked adequate information about HIV/AIDS.
