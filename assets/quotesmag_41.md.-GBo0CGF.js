Relations have deteriorated in recent years, due to Cuba's poor human rights record and the European Union's numerous accusations of Cuba's human rights abuses. EU's common position EU relations with Cuba was governed by the Common Position, as approved by the European Council of Ministers in 1996, which was updated every six months following regular evaluations. According to the Common Position \\"the objective of the European Union in its relations with Cuba is to encourage a process of transition to a pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people\\". Cuba rejects the Common Position as interference in its internal affairs. There is an EU Delegation in Havana that works under the responsibility of the EC Delegation in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. The Common Position was repealed on 12 December 2016. Cocktail wars In response to the Cason affair of March 2003, when the government of Cuba arrested dozens of journalists, librarians, and human rights activists, the EU took measures, which were publicly announced on 5 June 2003 to limit high level governmental visits. The EU reduced the profile of member states' participation in cultural events and invited Cuban dissidents to National Day celebrations. The Cuban authorities announced on 26 July 2003 their refusal of all direct aid coming from the European Union. This period of diplomatic friction became known as the Cocktail Wars. On 31 January 2005, the EU decided that all the measures taken on 5 June 2003 would be suspended temporarily. The Council stated once again that the EU remains willing to maintain a constructive dialogue with the Cuban authorities aiming at tangible results in the political, economic, human rights and cooperation sphere. Furthermore, it decided that the EU will develop more intense relations with the peaceful political opposition and broader layers of civil society in Cuba, through enhanced and more regular dialogue. The temporary suspension of these measures was confirmed in June 2005. Recent On 11 May 2009, Czech Foreign Minister Jan Kohout, who represented the EU at a meeting with Cuba had stated that Cuba had made no headway in human rights. Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodr√≠guez Parrilla defended Havana's record stating that the EU position was obsolete. Although the EU lifted economic sanctions against the nation in 2008, it reviews the situation annually. After the death of another dissident in Cuba in March 2010, the European Parliament put forward a resolution against Cuba and calling for the release of political prisoners. Meanwhile, Spain, currently holding the EU Council presidency had been working to normalise relations, claiming that the common position had failed to produce change in Cuba. On 10 February 2014, the EU adopted negotiating directives for a bilateral EU-Cuba Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement. The talks started in April 2014 in Havana. They were followed up during a second round in Brussels in August 2014 and a third round in Havana in March 2015. On 11 March 2016, HR/VP Mogherini visited Cuba to sign the final deal and mark \\"the end of the common position\\". On 12 December 2016, the EU repealed the Common Position and signed the Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement (PDCA).https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage_en/16558/EU- Cuba%20relations,%20factsheet Trade Cuba benefits from the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) preferential treatment for its exports. Furthermore, despite being a member of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States since 2000, Cuba does not benefit from the ACP-EU Sugar Protocol but from a sugar quota granted by the EU (some 59,000 tonnes per year; duty paid on this quota is ‚Ç¨98 per tonne). The EU is Cuba's second most important trading partner (accounting for 20% of total Cuban trade).

The award is called a 'Palatinate' rather than a 'Blue' because palatinate (a shade of purple) is the historical colour of the university. A different colour, palatinate blue, is the colour of County Durham. The highest award is the Full Palatinate, given to those who have represented their country whilst at University and have, at the same time, also made a significant contribution to their club. Half Palatinate awards are given to those who have either competed at a very high level, but not made a significant contribution to their club, or held a position of responsibility but lacked the necessary standard of sporting ability. The awards are notoriously difficult to achieve, and differ from the awarding of colours by other universities in that a Palatinate is not awarded merely for representing the University. The awarding of Palatinates is decided by a committee which is appointed each year. Honorary Palatinate awards recognise the success of former Durham students who have gone on to greater things within the field of sport.

The Philippines has among the highest rates of discovery in the world with sixteen new species of mammals discovered in the last ten years. Because of this, the rate of endemism for the Philippines has risen and likely will continue to rise.  Birds  alt=A A Philippine eagle at Philippine Eagle Center at Davao City. There are 612 species of birds in the Philippines, of which 500 are endemic, three have been introduced by humans, and 52 are rare or accidental. There are 67 globally threatened species.

A past oboe player, Gordon studied composition at King's College, Cambridge with Robin Holloway, and subsequently with Oliver Knussen and John Woolrich, and in Italy with Franco Donatoni. He was a composition pupil of Louis Andriessen from 1989 to 1990. His work has often involved a deep engagement with the subject of memory, with the use of quotation of, or allusion to, other music, sometimes explicit, sometimes more buried. He has himself also spoken of his work in terms of 'turbulence seeking serenity'. Stylistically, this could be seen in the relationship between tonal and more dissonant materials in his music. Key works include the oboe concerto The Fabric of Dreams (2006), premiered by Nicholas Daniel and the Britten Sinfonia, The Impermanence of Things for piano, ensemble and electronics (2009), a London Sinfonietta commission, Allele for 40 voices (2010), a project involving the science of genetics, Bohortha for large orchestra (2012), a BBC Symphony Orchestra commission, Seize the Day (2016), a Birmingham Contemporary Music Group Sound Investment commission, and his Violin Concerto (2017), a BBC Symphony Orchestra commission. Gordon was the recipient of the Prix Italia 2004 for his composition for radio A Pebble in the Pond, and two British Composer Awards, for Allele and for This Night for choir and solo cello (2009), a commission for the choir of King's College, Cambridge. He has taught at the universities of Durham, Southampton and at the Royal College of Music. Since 2012 he has been Professor of Composition at the University of Birmingham. His music is published on Composer's Edition.

The archaeological clearing of the site has revealed an extensive system of underground galleries and tombs dating from the third to the eighth centuries CE. The site was first fully investigated in 1894 by Dr. Antonio Annetto Caruana. It is now managed by Heritage Malta. There are over 30 hypogea in the entire St. Paul's and St. Agatha's complex, over 20 of which are open to the public. History St. Paul's catacombs are part of a large cemetery once located outside the walls of the ancient Roman city of Melite, now covered by the smaller Mdina and Rabat. It also comprises the catacombs of Saint Agatha, San Katald, St. Augustine and many others. The cemetery probably originated in the Phoenician-Punic period. As in Roman tradition, Phoenician and Punic burials were located outside city walls. The many tombs discovered in areas outside the known line of the Roman city suggest that the city of Melite was close to equal size. The early tombs consisted of a deep rectangular shaft with one or two chambers dug from its sides. This type of burial was used well into the Roman occupation of the islands, but the chambers grew larger and more regular in shape over time. It is probable that this enlargement joined neighboring tombs and led to the creation of small catacombs, which became the norm by the fourth century AD. The catacombs were in use till the seventh, possibly eighth century. Some of the catacombs were used again during the re-Christianisation of the Island around the 13th century. Site Menorah indicating the presence of Jewish burials The site is open to the public every day from 9am till 5pm. Visitors can access over 20 of the catacombs in the St Paul's cluster. The main complex, covering an area of more than 2000 square metres, is so far the largest catacomb ever to be found on the island. It is large enough to have served as a communal burial ground in successive phases of Malta's history. The two halls at the bottom of the entrance stairs show two agape tables (circular tables hewn out of the living rock and used for ceremonial meals commemorating dead relatives). Although the complex contains almost all of the burial types found in the Maltese repertoire, the best represented are so- called baldacchino tombs. These free-standing, canopied burials dominate the main corridors of the complex; their four elegant arches and supporting pillars are exemplary. Other decorations within this catacomb include illustrations and written messages in red paint. Another catacomb is much smaller than the first. The surgical tools carved in relief on one of the three blocking stones in the inner chamber suggest that it was the burial place of a particular family or group of surgeons. The 24 catacombs show evidence of Christian, Pagan and Jewish burials side-by-side and no visible divisions. Excavation and conservation The catacombs The excavation of the catacombs began in the late 1800s and, other than the construction of protective rooms, no further conservation was undertaken in the twentieth century. With funds from the European Union's European Regional Development Fund (Operational Programme I ‚Äì Cohesion Policy 2007-2013), Heritage Malta is performing extensive archaeological and environmental research. Various other studies will be conducted in the coming few years, culminating in the development of new visitor facilities as well as the opening to the public of most of the smaller catacombs.

The rostellum is surrounded by suckers which are armed with spines.Jones, A. & Bray, R.A. (1994). Family Davaineidae Braun, 1900.

Byrne was most notable for being a weather presenter for WIN Television from 1990 until 2012. Biography Peter was born in Mackay, Queensland and worked with the Australian Bureau of Meteorology for over 37 years.100 years of weather wild and fair After graduating from a high school in Mackay, Byrne was appointed as a junior weather observer at the Bureau of Meteorology.Weather of not?: Peter Byrne has faced up to that question for 37 years, Tony McMahon, The Morning Bulletin, 11 August 2001 Byrne then went on to complete meteorological training in Brisbane and Melbourne for 18 months before being posted to Brisbane. After his marriage to a Townsville school teacher, Byrne was posted to Madang on the north coast of Papua New Guinea which Byrne described as a \\"weather man's dream\\" as there was a smoking volcano to the north and snow-capped mountains to the south. Byrne undertook more training in Melbourne and after receiving the relevant qualifications in 1971, he went from being an weather observer that collected and collated information to a fully-fledged forecaster. His new role as a forecaster required him to chart and analyse information to make forecasts. His role now also included briefing pilots - and the media. His job as a forecaster took him Byrne to Townsville where he worked for nine years. During his time in Townsville, Byrne was heavily involved with the Royal Australian Air Force and the United States Air Force as they researched the behaviour of cyclones. In his time with the Bureau he worked in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands and many regional centres, including Cairns, Mackay, Cloncurry, Brisbane, Townsville and some time in Mount Isa before finally settling in Yeppoon in 1986 where he made numerous appearances on RTQ7's local news, being regularly interviewed about storms and for other weather-related stories. Byrne joined RTQ7 in Rockhampton in February 1990 as the local Rockhampton weather presenter, prior to the station becoming part of the WIN Television network. By his own admission, Byrne was reluctant to move into television. Byrne had already declined an offer from news director Phil Smith to fill in for the regular RTQ7 weather presenter while they were on holidays. Some months later, new news director Alastair Frew extended another invitation to Byrne to join the station as their permanent weather presenter. After some consideration, Byrne accepted the offer. However, Byrne had to seek the approval from Rex Falls, the regional director of the Bureau of Meteorology. Falls agreed to Byrne's new television commitments but it meant Byrne had to begin work at the Bureau of Meteorology earlier. This meant Byrne now had to leave his Yeppoon home at 2:45am each morning to start his shift in Rockhampton, and then drive back to Yeppoon after work for some sleep before driving back up to the WIN Television studio in North Rockhampton to begin recording his weather reports for the various news bulletins. While he was employed at WIN Television, his role expanded to being the weather presenter on all the local editions of WIN News weeknightly, delivering individual weather reports for the Cairns, Townsville, Mackay, Rockhampton, Wide Bay‚ÄìBurnett, Toowoomba and Sunshine Coast regions of Queensland.Cyclone Ului coverage labelled 'irresponsible' Additionally, Byrne also began presenting a statewide weather report upon the introduction of the Queensland edition of WIN Late News in 2001. Byrne retired from his post at the Rockhampton office of the Bureau of Meteorology in 2001, but continued his work as a weather presenter with WIN Television in Rockhampton. In 2012, Byrne made news when he used his weather reports to criticise reports made by metropolitan television stations, particularly on the breakfast programs such as Sunrise and Today relating to weather conditions in Queensland.WIN weatherman criticises reports, The Morning Bulletin, 23 March 2012. Retrieved 20 October 2016. In one weather report, Byrne said: The southern media are at it again... more unprofessional claptrap on what they portray as breakfast television. Imagine the repercussions if, on national television, I forecast 200km/h winds for Sydney or Melbourne! Hooley, Dooley! Queensland deserves and demands better.

Byrne later said that while management still weren't happy with him, the issue had been reconciled and his colleagues had even handed him a \\"Storm in a Teacup\\" award after the incident, which consisted of a cut-out of a Melbourne Storm player in an actual teacup. Byrne also alluded to not having a job at WIN for much longer, which was likely referring to the imminent closure of the WIN Television studio facilities in Rockhampton.Cloud over Byrne's future, Nikita Watts, The Morning Bulletin, 24 March 2012.

Continually rising real estate prices and high incentives for home ownership have encouraged restrictive loans to those wishing to own a residence, but lacking the required wealth. The resulting loans have had a deteriorative effect on the indebted, who are left with little money to invest or otherwise improve their financial position and standard of living.  Causes  Housing demand in urban China has greatly increased. Export-oriented economy and educational opportunities in Chinese cities have accelerated the country's urbanization, as have cities with available public goods limiting their access to residents who have purchased and registered real estate. Further raising the demand are distrust in the country's social safety net, cultural expectation for long- term residences, and \\"poor public housing implementation\\" that has left affordable housing hard to find. An inflated industry increases GDP statistics, the primary criteria for promoting public officials, which promotes governmental inaction. Real estate companies, banks, the government, and already-established urban residents have indirectly increased prices by speculating on the booming market. Effects Because most of their disposable income is spent repaying the loan, mortgage slaves have an extremely tight budget. They have little or no money left for increasing their wealth through investment, which leaves them chained to the loans for long periods of time, or for consumption, which pushes down their standard of living, social standing, and personal development as well as the country's consumer economy.

Her ambition was to become a painter since she was old enough to hold a brush, and this she pursued under the tutelage of Pietro Annigoni.Boca Raton News, October 18th, 1981 She stated that 'Annigoni gave me the heart to fight for a career when the cards of my sex, youth and country of origin were neatly stacked against me... he was a strict disciplinarian.'Boca Raton News, October 18th, 1981 In her youth she acted in numerous TV and film roles under both her birth name, Shirley Lorimer and her assumed name Sara Leighton. Leighton quickly found considerable success in portrait painting, becoming highly sought after by rich and influential society figures who were eager for her to paint their likeness. One of her most famous commissions was the Queen Mother. Leighton stated that she was also her favourite subject 'something goes on when she enters a room... the Queen Mother is genuinely so kind and has a way of making you feel you are the important one, not her.' Helen Cathcart, the Queen Mother's biographer noted that 'preparing a fresco, a younger artist, Sara Leighton, preferred to eschew formal sittings and was permitted to follow the Queen Mother with a sketchbook,'Cathcart, Helen. The Queen Mother Herself (W.H.Allen, 1979) One of these sketches was later made into a popular limited edition print, published by the House of Questa, London in an edition of 2,500. 1963 saw Leighton establishing the company London Portrait's LTD in order to administer the increasing demand for her work.British Journal of Photography, Volume 110, p.229 The following year, Leighton was badly injured in a car accident near Tunbridge Wells, receiving facial injuries and leg fractures. Also involved in the accident was Keith Waters her husband, and the famous American female bullfighter Sandra Landry who had flown to England to have her portrait painted by Leighton.Sarasota Herald-Tribune, April 19th, 1964 In November, 1971 it was reported in the Toledo Blade that Muhammad Ali was to have his portrait painted by Sara Leighton, however according to the Boca Raton News in October 1981, Leighton declined his request as well as that of Elizabeth Taylor.Toledo Blade, November 13th, 1971 She justified the reasons for her decision, stating 'when I paint I must have total concentration. Although they would make lovely subjects, I can not paint in a three-ring circus. There was too much activity around them at the time I was propositioned to paint.'Boca Raton News, October 18th, 1981 In 1972, she travelled to South America in search of the Jaguar, the resulting painting being donated to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The painting Storm over the Veldt was donated to the Worldlife Fund on its 10th Anniversary, with the proceeds from reproduction rights going to the fund.Boca Raton News, October 18th, 1981 In the mid-1970s she lived in Bahrain, taking a flat in the National Bank of Bahrain Building, Manama, overlooking the then dhow harbour. Leighton was also controversially outspoken in regards to her sex, rejecting the rising feminist discourse prevalent at the time. In 1962 at the age of 26, she founded (perhaps satirically) The Society for the Protection of Utter Femininity. The society's aims were to encourage women to give up the vote and stop trying to compete with men in business - she quipped to the press, 'A woman should stay in the home...my ex-husband agrees with me.'Daytona Beach Morning Journal, September 2nd, 1962 She later stated that \\"Chopin was right when he said that all creative energy is sexual. He was writing a letter and he said something like: 'and when I think my darling, of how many sonatas I have poured into you.' That's why I don't think there have been great women painters.\\"Attallah, Naim. Women (1987) Sara Leighton was also famed for her beauty, Pietro Annigoni once labelled her 'the most beautiful woman in the world'.Leighton, Sara. Of Savages and Kings (Bachman and Turner, 1980) The British newsreader Jan Leeming recalled 'I thought salvation, or an answer to my dilemma would come in the shape of a job in the north of England. I'd been to an audition for a news reading position with Granada Television in Manchester. I vividly remember walking into a room where other hopefuls were sitting. My heart sank when I looked at one stunningly beautiful woman and thought I hadn't got a chance. She was a painter called Sara Leighton, who went on to relative acclaim. To my surprise, she didn't get the job, I did. I can only think it was because I already had experience of news reading and the others hadn't.'Leeming, Jan. Addicted to Love: an Autobiography In 1973 it was reported that Sara Leighton had bought a 40-room monastery in Tuscany, Italy, and intended to turn it into a sanctuary for writers, musicians, artists, as paying guests.Sarasota Journal, April 5th, 1973 Leighton increasing became a media personality, appearing regularly on talk and panel shows including Parkinson, which brought with it her fair share of press attention. In 1975 '' 1980 saw Leighton publish her autobiography titled Of Savages and Kings, which recounts her adventures around the world with the diverse and interesting people that were part of her exciting life. She recalls her encounters with many of her clients and friends including Lord Olivier, The Prince of Wales, Muhammad Ali, Sheikh Yamani, Gloria Swanson, Pietro Annigoni, Sir Roger Moore, Jean Rook, David Niven, Shirley Bassey, Joan Collins, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, The Princess Royal and the Beaverbrook family.Leighton, Sara. Of Savages and Kings (Bachman and Turner, 1980) Sara Leighton's work is scarce, owing to the majority being commissioned portraits still in the possession of the patrons.

Death While serving as a eunuch in his wife's palace, Parthenius was accused by Roman emperor Decius with embezzlement of Anatolia's money, and with the capital crime of Christianity. Ignoring the financial accusations, Parthenius and his brother defended the Christian faith. The court took their defense as an admission of their Christianity and sentenced them to death. Parthenius was thrown into a bonfire but did not burn. In order to carry out his sentence, guards took flaming brands from the fire and beat him to death. He was buried in the catacombs under Saint Callixtus. Relics In the 18th century, relics of St. Parthenius were moved to Vienna. In 1784, with the permission of Pope Pius VI, the relics were moved to Zhovkva in Eastern Galicia (then Austrian Empire, nowadays western Ukraine).

On the other hand, LPDS is developing easy-to-maintain middleware solutions and technologies for interoperability that enables cost- efficient alternative distributed, grid and cloud platforms for scientific and business applications. LPDS laboratory, in cooperation with other departments of MTA SZTAKI, was involved in the development of the SZTAKI Cloud, and takes part in more and more cloud-based projects. The LPDS cloud research is focusing on the field of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)-based cloud systems to make the previously evolved products and services of LPDS to be available for cloud-based executing in a scalable and transparent way. The home of LPDS  Main Research Areas  *Cloud systems *Scientific gateways for grid and cloud systems *Workflow-based IT solutions *Grid computing, especially Desktop Grids *Interoperability between cloud and grid systems *Resource brokering in cloud systems  Products  gUSE (grid and cloud user support environment) is a well-known and permanently improving open source science gateway framework that enables users the convenient and easy access to grid and cloud infrastructures. It has been developed to support a large variety of user communities. It provides a general purpose, workflow-oriented graphical user interface to create and run workflows on various Distributed Computing Infrastructures including clusters, grids, desktop grids and clouds. The gUSE framework can be used by National Grid Initiatives (NGIs) to support small user communities who cannot afford to develop their own customized science gateway. P-GRADE Portal is a Liferay technology-based web portal of gUSE. It can be accessed via the major modern web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, etc. It supports development and submission of distributed applications executed on the computational resources of various distributed computing infrastructures (DCIs) including clusters, service grids, desktop grids and clouds. Data Avenue is a file commander tool for data transfer, enabling easy data moving between various storage services over various network protocols. Data Avenue is integrated into WS-PGRADE as a portlet. The goal of SZTAKI Cloud was to develop and to deploy an institutional cloud infrastructure that allows the significant improvement of the traditional institutional IT infrastructure. This new cloud-based infrastructure is significantly more effective and more cost efficient than the former infrastructure built on traditional conceptions and individual specific servers. SZTAKI Desktop Grid provides an enterprise solution to exploit PCs and clusters located at different sites of a company or institute, solving large scale distributed programs via an easy-to-use application programming interface. It is extended to include clusters as single powerful PCs and to hierarchically propagate work from one desktop grid to the other.  Research  LPDS has participated in national and international grid and cloud research projects since 2000 with outstanding results in the area of grid/cloud resources and in the development of high-level user interfaces. In this field an important result is the WS-PGRADE/gUSE (used in several European grid), made for to access grid and cloud systems through a portal in a convenient and user-friendly way. Additionally, LPDS participates in Big data management and storage within the field of agricultural research. Ongoing projects with the participation of LPDS: *ENTICE *VIALACTEA *CloudSME *AgroDat The laboratory maintains a comprehensive list of other projects. LPDS Training Room  Training  LPDS has played an active role in providing grid and cloud trainings in Europe and worldwide. With the national and international trainings the Laboratory provides knowledge transfer and targets new users from industry as well as from science. LPDS organized and hosted summer schools and trainings in grid- and cloud-related topics since 2005.  Personnel  The Head of the LPDS is Prof. Dr. P√©ter Kacsuk. The Deputy Head of the LPDS is Dr. Robert Lovas. 1 DSc, 10 PhDs, and over 20 full or part-time members work in the laboratory.

Premise Will, a writer in his thirties, faces a crisis in his life when he has to choose between his wife and mistress. He is also on the fence about choices in his professional life, something that is accentuated when he meets a childhood friend who has become a successful TV producer in England.

They made the film as a co-production with Senior Films, a large production house in Melbourne who specialised in making commercials.Andrew Pike and Ross Cooper, Australian Film 1900‚Äì1977: A Guide to Feature Film Production, Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1998, 244.

The film was autobiographical, with \\"two thousand weeks\\" being an expression Burstall used in the 1950s.Peter Coleman, 'Australian Exotica: A rare glimpse into the daily routine of a bohemian from Down Under', American Review accessed 9 September 2012 Release Burstall secured Columbia Pictures as a distributor and they agreed to split the $10,000 in marketing costs with Elthan Films, but it took them seven months to release it, but Burstall put this down to the reluctance of Australian exhibitors to show local films. Reception The film was poorly received by Australian critics such as Colin Bennett of The Age and at Australian film festivals. It received a better critical reception overseas. The experience encouraged Burstall to move in a more commercial direction for the rest of his career. However he did later explore many of the themes from 2000 Weeks again in Petersen (1974). Burstall later said of the film: > I have a special place in my heart for it, because it was my first feature > and in some ways autobiographical. But I wince when I see it, except for the > few energy points which are mainly in the flashbacks. I think of the first > ten years of my film work, up to and including 2000 Weeks as my > apprenticeship... I don't believe the acting in 2000 Weeks is bad so much as > a question of actors being asked to say unsayable things, and act unactable > things. It was too deficient in energy and too much of it was in an > intellectualised form, instead of action. David Stratton wrote of it: > 2,000 Weeks was an important film; important for what it had to say, > important in the courage it took to make it in the first place. It deserved > a fair go, and it didn't get it. Doubtless Collin Bennett would try to > justify his attitude by saying that he judges every film by the same > inviolable standard of excellence, and that in the light of this rigid > philosophy, 2,000 Weeks was found wanting. Doubtless. But his attitude was > unbearable righteous and helped create a climate in which good film could be > destroyed. No wonder Burstall never forgave, or forgot. No wonder he never > made the mistake of trying to produce a \\"serious\\" film again.David Stratton, > The Last New Wave: The Australian Film Revival, Angus & Robertson, 1980 > p23-24 The film was also entered into the 6th Moscow International Film Festival. Paul Byrnes from the NFSA comments: \\"2000 Weeks was one of the first features of the modern era in Australian cinema, after decades in which almost the only productions were British and American films in search of exotic locales. ... There was an intense desire amongst a few people to restart an Australian film industry, and Burstall was one of the leaders. Indeed, he made nationalist artistic longings the main theme of the film, although it didn‚Äôt help the film‚Äôs reception. It was booed when it screened at the 1970 Sydney Film Festival and damned by some influential critics. The box office was poor and Burstall became determined to make films for a wide commercial audience, rather than an art-house few. Many of these later films, starting with Stork (1971) and Alvin Purple (1973), were great popular successes.\\"Australianscreen > 2000 Weeks.

The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 24, 2007. It includes 37 contributing buildings and three contributing sites. Architectural styles The architectural styles of the district include Colonial Revival, Craftsman, Federal, Georgian, Gothic Revival, Greek Revival, and Italianate. History Village of Middlebush In 1701, a group of eight people bought a tract of 10,000 acres from John Harrison in what is now Franklin Township. They divided this Harrison Tract into eight plots and then into sixteen by drawing a north-south dividing line. This line eventually became a road, the Middle Line, now called South Middlebush Road. The other main road in the district is the east-west Amwell Road, which historically connected New Brunswick to Millstone, which was then the county seat of Somerset County. By 1704, two of the sons, John and Peter, of Cornelius Wyckoff, one of the original eight buyers, had settled in the Middlebush area. Contributing properties The Middlebush Reformed Church, located at the intersection of South Middlebush Road and Amwell Road, was built in 1919 to replace the original 1834 church. It is a mix of Gothic Revival and Craftsman styles. The Voorhees House, located at 1719 Amwell Road, was built in 1793 by P. Metz in a Georgian style. It is now the Stage House Tavern. The oldest building in the district, it was used in 1834 to organized the Middlebush Reformed Church. The location also includes a contributing large, red shingle, 19th-century Dutch barn. The Middlebush School, located at 1755 Amwell Road, was built in 1926 as an elementary school. It is now known as the Franklin Township Board of Education Building. The house at 17 South Middlebush Road was built by John Wyckoff in a style between Greek Revival and Italianate. The house at 53 South Middlebush Road was built and was owned by Peter Brokaw.

On its website, the organization says that \\"SEJ‚Äôs mission is to strengthen the quality, reach and viability of journalism across all media to advance public understanding of environmental issues.\\" History The Society of Environmental Journalists was founded in 1990 by a small group of award-winning journalists, including reporters, editors, and producers working for The Philadelphia Inquirer, USA Today, Turner Broadcasting, Minnesota Public Radio, and National Geographic. Today, SEJ's membership includes more than 1,500 journalists and academics working in every type of news media in the United States, Canada, Mexico and 27 other countries. As a 501(c)3 non- profit educational organization, SEJ provides educational opportunities and vital support to journalists of all media who face the challenging responsibility of covering complex environmental issues. SEJ operating and project budgets are underwritten through a combination of foundation grants based on SEJ proposals (emphasis on general, unrestricted support), university sponsorships of the annual conference, media company contributions, earned income from dues and fees for services (including exhibit, ad space and single use rental of the mail list/email distribution listserv) and earnings from individual gifts to the endowment fund. SEJ does not seek or accept gifts or grants from government agencies, non-media corporations or environmental advocacy groups. Lobbyists and public relations professionals are not eligible for membership in SEJ. All are welcome to subscribe to SEJournal and participate in SEJ's annual conferences. Activities SEJ provides support to journalists of all media in their efforts to responsibly cover complex issues concerning the environment. SEJ offers educational programs and services for working journalists, educators, and students, including annual and regional conferences; daily EJToday news service; quarterly SEJournal; biweekly TipSheet and other publications; FOI WatchDog project; SEJ Awards for Reporting on the Environment; members-only listservs; mentoring program; website-based resources; and a lively membership network of journalists and academics. The SEJ has criticized the Environmental Protection Agency for its policy of restricting independent scientists who advise the agency from talking to media outlets without the Agency's permission. Objectivity The SEJ is frequently accused on conservative blogs of being \\"unwilling to think or report critically about environmental issues\\". The editor of one of the organization's online publications replies that the SEJ \\"has worked hard to uphold the distinction between environmental journalism and environmentalism\\", and notes that its members have produced \\"countless instances of fair, impartial, and incisive reporting\\". Objectivity as Independence: Creating the Society of Environmental Journalists, 1989-1997, by John Palen, provides an in-depth look at SEJ's creation and the philosophy of its founders. His paper was presented at the national convention of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communications in Baltimore, MD, in August 1998.

There is no way out, no place to run. The healthy, normal emotionally resilient child will learn to accommodate to the reality of continuing sexual abuse.\\" Summit described how he claimed that children try to resolve the experience of sexual abuse in relation to the effects of disclosure in real life. He posited five stages: # Secrecy # Helplessness # Entrapment and accommodation # Delayed disclosure # Retraction Summit himself recognized in later articles the extent to which many persons were misled by the use of the term \\"syndrome\\" and how his theory had been used inappropriately as a diagnostic method for both behavioural sciences and criminal trials.R. v. K (A.), (1999), 1999 CanLII 3793 (ON CA), 45 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.) at paras. 125 According to Mary de Young, CSAAS was invoked often during the day-care sex-abuse hysteria of the 1980s and 1990s, because it purports to explain both delayed disclosures and withdrawals of false allegation of child sexual abuse. De Young argued that CSAAS is used to justify any statement made by a child as an indication that sexual abuse had occurred, because immediate disclosure could be an indication of abuse, but also delayed disclosure, withdrawal and sustained denial. Several states have prohibited testimony regarding CSAAS, based on evidence that it is not accepted generally by scientists, except for delayed reporting.State v. J.L.G., Docket Number A-50-16(N.J.

Flashbacks return from Colin McRae: Dirt 2, which can be used up to five times in any difficulty, but cost reputation points to use. A new gymkhana mode puts players in obstacle courses, challenging them to perform various tricks to earn points. Featured in the game are various party modes, involving events such as smashing wooden targets (\\"Invasion\\"), spreading a zombie infection (\\"Outbreak\\"), and a capture the flag-like game mode (\\"Transporter\\"). Other new features include a Hardcore mode which limits players to the cockpit view (known as \\"head cam\\") with no driver assists, the appearance of rain and snow, and the ability to upload replay clips directly to YouTube. Reception IGN gave the game a score of 8.5 and an Editor's Choice award, praising the gameplay and online functionality while criticising some of the design choices. GameTrailers gave the game a score of 9.2, praising the gameplay and presentation, although criticising the limits of the YouTube functionality. GamesRadar gave the game a score of 9/10, praising its impeccable gameplay though noting slightly lower structure presentation compared to the previous game. Official Xbox Magazine gave the game a score of 8.5/10, hailing its impressive car design and smooth handling, while criticising the lack of dynamism in the surfaces and poor social features. Following reports that the PC version of the game was unplayable due to the game's reliance on the now defunct Games for Windows ‚Äì Live software, a spokesperson for Codemasters issued a statement on the Steam community in January 2014 stating that Codemasters were in the process of removing Games for Windows ‚Äì Live from the game, and would announce completion of the task at a later date. On 1 April 2015, the work had been completed and GFWL had been removed from the game. The game was one of the November 2015 Games with Gold free games, the first of the promotion to be playable on Xbox One through backwards compatibility.

Until his resignation on March 13, 2010, following personal disclosures, he represented District 16 of Utah, which covers Davis County, Utah. Early life, education and business career Kevin Garn was born in Ogden, Utah and graduated from Layton High School. Garn attended Weber State University. He dropped out to focus on his business, KSG Distributing, a music and movie distribution company that he started while still in high school. Garn founded Pegasus Music and Video, a music and retail store, in 1985 after purchasing an existing store in Bountiful. Pegasus expanded from one location to thirteen stores throughout Utah and in Montana, and Idaho. Garn sold Pegasus to Wherehouse Entertainment in 1993. In 2004 Kevin Garn, partnered with Layton and Davis County, developed the Davis Conference Center, a 43,000-square-foot multi-use conference center connected to a Hilton Gardens. Since 2000, Garn has served as the chairman of the board for The First National Bank of Layton. Political career Garn first became involved in politics in 1989 when Franklin Knowlton, a family friend and politician, retired from the Utah House of Representatives. Knowlton asked Garn to run for his soon-to-be vacant 16th District's seat. Garn won the seat. Garn served in the Utah House of Representatives from January 1, 1991, to June 19, 2002, serving as Assistant Majority Whip in 1995 and 1996. In 2002, Garn ran for the seat of Utah's 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives, but lost the Republican primary to Rob Bishop. In the 2007 election he again won in the State 2009-2010 legislative session and served in the House Business and Labor Committee, Ethics Committee and the House Joint Subcommittee for Public Education Appropriations. Resignation At the close of the 2010 legislative session, Garn admitted to a nude encounter with an underage female, Cheryl Maher, in a hot tub in 1978 when he was 28. Garn paid Maher $150,000 for signing a confidentiality agreement in 2002 when she threatened to expose the incident during his failed U.S. congressional campaign. Maher, who was an employee of Garn's company at the time, told the press that Garn lied about the lack of physical contact, but did not elaborate. Garn, who was married at the time, denied the activities went beyond sitting nude in the hot tub, but called the incident \\"clearly inappropriate\\". Maher wrote to LDS Church president Thomas S. Monson asking for the church to seek action against Garn, who served as a bishop and Sunday school teacher at an LDS Church. The LDS Church responded to her letter by saying, \\"The 2008 letter sent by Ms. Maher to Church headquarters was referred to local ecclesiastical leaders to be addressed. Church disciplinary matters are handled at a local level and not at Church headquarters\\". Garn resigned from the House on March 13, 2010, and the Davis County Republican Party picked businessman Stephen G. Handy to replace Garn on April 11; Handy worked with Garn in the Layton City Council. Handy was sworn in four days later. Maher was killed in a murder-suicide in New Hampshire in July 2011.

Tasburgh House was built in 1891 by photographer John Berryman. Although Bath was being built exclusively of honey-coloured Bath Stone, Berryman's influential position (Royal Family's official photographer) gave him permission to build the house with red brick. Tasburgh House was the first and only red-brick-built house in Bath at that time. Original deeds show that the house was initially named 'Avonhurst', the name was changed to 'Tasburgh House' at some point before 1925, although the exact date is unknown. The house still stands in its original form and the exterior has not changed significantly. It was converted from three flats into a hotel in approximately 1969. The hotel was owned and managed by Susan Keeling from 1996 until 2019. During this time, it received extensive investment and refurbishment, including the addition of three guest bedrooms and multi-level terracing at the rear of the property. Tasburgh House Hotel has featured twice on the TV series The Hotel Inspector. In 2015 the hotel won 'Best UK Luxury Guest House' in the World Hotel Awards. In 2019 the hotel was sold to The Three Bears Ventures Limited. The building now operates as a 15 bedroom boutique hotel with a bar (residents only), with Grant Atkinson as general manager.

Playing career He played for 8 seasons (112 games, 19 goals) in the Serie A for A.C. Milan, Torino F.C., A.S. Varese 1910, Ternana Calcio, A.S. Roma, Hellas Verona F.C. and Bologna F.C. 1909. His career almost ended after he received a 3 years and 6-month ban from football in the Totonero 1980 match-fixing scandal. After 1982 he played for a few more seasons. After retirement After ending his career in football in the mid- eighties, Petrini devoted himself to business, for a time managing his own finance company. After initial success, the business was affected by the accumulation of debts to moneylenders. To escape his creditors, Petrini left Italy and took refuge in France, where he lived for several years in complete anonymity. Petrini's name came back to the headlines in 1995. His 19-year-old son, Diego, was dying from a brain tumor in the Galliera hospital in Genoa, and he launched an appeal through the media, asking to see his father, which he had not heard from for the past six years. Diego, a promising footballer, died without seeing Petrini, who had decided not to return to Italy.Mi spiace per Diego, ma non posso tornare Petrini later wrote a touching book of poetry inspired by this sad story after his final return to Italy in 1998. Carlo Petrini, who resided in his native Monticiano, had been affected for some time from a severe form of glaucoma, which had caused almost complete blindness in his left eye and serious impairment of the right. According to the doctors who had cared for him over the years, and put him through five surgeries, the disease could be related to the usage of many performance-enhancing drugs during his career. The books In 2000 Petrini published his autobiography, Nel fango del dio pallone (In the Mud of Holy Football), in which he narrates in first person several events he witnessed, or was involved in, in the Italian football world. Petrini stats In particular that the practice of doping in the sixties and seventies was rampant, and he claims to have used them too multiple times aided and abetted by sports doctors. He also tells about having been involved or having witnessed cases of match-fixing. Petrini subsequently published another book, 'Il calciatore suicidato' (The Suicided Footballer), where he personally investigated the mysterious death of Donato Bergamini, a player for Cosenza, who was found dead in 1989 on Route 106 near Roseto Capo Spulico. Despite the courts ruling the death a suicide, Petrini argued that the death of the footballer had occurred at the hands of local criminals. Petrini went on to publish five books, the last of which is titled Lucianone da Monticiano, (2012), and is a biography of football manager Luciano Moggi. Involvement in civil society Petrini continued to rally against the usage of performance-enhancing drugs, showing concern especially for the spread of doping practices among the young. He said: \\"A recent survey has shown that one teenager in three is willing to make use of illegal drugs while achieving success in the world of football. What is even more disturbing is that 10% of them declare themselves 'ready to die for use of doping', just to look like their sports idol.\\" In 2006, along with other former players, Petrini joined the Association of Victims of Doping (Associazione Vittime del Doping) founded by Claudia Beatrice, daughter of Bruno Beatrice, a former Fiorentina midfielder who died of leukemia in 1987 at just 39 years.

Unfinished Business was nominated for five AFI Awards.IMDb Awards Plot Geoff, a journalist in his mid 40s, returns to Australia from 15 years abroad, leaving behind him in the US a failed marriage and three children. He meets Maureen, the girl he was in love with when he left Australia. She is married to an older man, George, who she loves but have no children. Maureen - who once fell pregnant but had an abortion - tells Geoff her husband is sterile and asks for him to impregnate her. A year later, Geoff meets Maureen and her baby. Cast *John Clayton as Geoff *Michelle Fawdon as Maureen *Norman Kaye as George Production=Development Bob Ellis originally wanted to make a film in the style of My Dinner with Andre starring Patrick Cook and John Clarke called Business Lunch. Clarke would play an ABC executive about to tell Cook he was going to be fired and dialogue would be largely improvised. $60,000 was raised by Patric Juillet and Rebel Penfold-Russell to make the film but then Clarke became unavailable. \\"Cook was ready and willing to go whenever we were but Clarke was impossible to pin down and so the whole thing lost momentum,\\" said Ellis. \\"We had to spend the money so the producer, Rebel Penfold Russell, asked me to come up with another small idea with \\"business\\" in the title. The result was Unfinished Business. We had to raise a little more money to cover it because you've no idea how hard it is to come up with a small idea. Big ideas are far easier to get. I'm the greatest writer of unmade epics in the business.\\" Ellis wrote a script in three days (spread over three weeks) and constructed roles specifically for John Clayton and Michelle Fawdon. Ellis' wife Anne Brooksbank participated at rehearsals and contributed to the script. Ellis says the film was based on a personal experience. \\"Twice in my life I've had girls ask me to oblige them in that way. And both times I've said yes. And both times they failed to turn up and go through with it. The frustrating stop-star love-making Geoff and Maureen indulge in as they go about graphing his sperm count and her temperature to maximise their chances of conceiving is also something I've been through. When Anne and I were trying to have our third child she'd kick me awake at four in the morning saying her temperature was up and I'd have to reorganise my protoplasm to suit the occasion.\\"G.J. Burchall, \\"Wit, warmth in a spot of unfinished business\\", The Age 1 May 1987 Shooting The film was rehearsed and shot in eleven days at three locations - Ellis' houses in Wahroonga and Palm Beach and his flat in Bellevue Hill. Cast member Norman Kaye also wrote and performed the music. Ellis: > It's one of the most enjoyable experiences I ever had. Although the actor > and the actress were both acting on stage - one was rehearsing in the > daytime and the other was performing at night. The net result was that we'd > sometimes converge at midnight and begin shooting, which is about the worst > thing you can do. But it was wonderful. It took 11 days and I wish it had > taken 13.

Sturtivant, Geoff (2008-11-08), \\"Ray Sturtivant\\", The Independent. http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-19427408.html, retrieved 12 March 2010 Early life Ray Sturtivant was born in Nottingham. He spent his National Service in the RAF (Royal Air Force), but was given a desk job in India at the end of World War II, with poor eyesight that thwarted his ambition of becoming a pilot. That led to a long career in the Civil Service. Professional life In 1948, Sturtivant joined the Civil Service at Nottingham County Court, with further similar posts at Sheffield, and Kingston upon Hull. He became chief clerk at Carlisle County Court, then at Willesden County Court, and then Bow, London County Court. He wrote the Bailiffs Manual, (1980) that was judged to be an invaluable resource. Within the Inland Revenue, he was responsible for 300 probate offices in the UK. In 1984 he was appointed Establishment Officer of the Principal Registry of the Family Division at Somerset House. In 1986 he retired from the Civil Service. In 1987 he was awarded an ISO (Companion of the Imperial Service Order), a prestigious award, but now no longer awarded. His ISO honour was presented to him by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. Life as historian and author From childhood, Sturtivant's principal and passion was aircraft and aviation. While an Air Cadet, he pursued his interest in recording aviation activities while cycling around pre-war and wartime airfields around Nottinghamshire. He developed a prolific skill for record-keeping and detail, and started writing for magazines such as Flight and Aviation News. In 1978 he wrote his first aviation book, 'Royal Navy Instructional Airframes', followed 1982 by 'Fleet Air Arm at War'. Further books followed at an average of one per year, including 'The Camel File', 'The Swordfish Story', 'The Anson File'. His most important work was probably 'The Squadrons of the Fleet Air Arm'; written with Theo Ballance, this book detailed all the FAA Squadron histories, and widely regarded as the definitive book on the subject. In 1995, a specially bound copy of 'The Squadrons of the Fleet Air Arm', was presented to HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh at the Fleet Air Arm Museum at Yeovilton, when the Prince retired as President of the Museum. In later years he expanded his range of books to include 'The SE5 File', The 'DH4/DH9 File', and 'Spitfire International'. One of his last books, co-authored with Henry Boot, was 'Gifts of War: Spitfires and other Presentation Aircraft in Two World Wars', covering the subject of wartime aircraft that were funded by donations from individuals, groups, private companies, towns, and nations. Many of his books were published by the historical aviation society Air-Britain, of which he had been a member since 1948, and for which he served many years as a member of the governing council.Ray Sturtivant website Family life He married Doreen, and had a daughter Yvonne and son Geoffrey.

(eds.) Media, War, and Terrorism: Responses from the Middle East and Asia. Psychology Press, 2004, p. 138. . Along with the Muslim Brotherhood, founded in 1928, Jamaat-e-Islami was one of the original and most influential Islamist organisations, and the first of its kind to develop \\"an ideology based on the modern revolutionary conception of Islam\\". The group split into separate independent organisations in India and Pakistan‚ÄîJamaat-e-Islami Pakistan and Jamaat-e-Islami Hind‚Äîfollowing the Partition of India in 1947. Other groups related to or inspired by Jamaat-e-Islami developed in Bangladesh, Kashmir, Britain, and Afghanistan (see below). The Jamaat-e-Islami parties maintain ties internationally with other Muslim groups.Haqqani, Pakistan: Between Mosque and Military, 2010: p.171 Maududi was the creator and leader of Jamaat-e-Islami, which opposed the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan, actively working to prevent it. Though he opposed the creation of Pakistan fearing the liberalism of its founders and the British-trained administrators, when it happened, he viewed it as a gradual step to the Islamization of its laws and constitution even though he had earlier condemned the Muslim League for the same approach. After the partition of India, the organisation became the spearhead of the movement to transform Pakistan from a Muslim homeland into an Islamic state. Madudi, like the traditionalist ulama, believed in the six canonical hadiths and the Quran, and also accepted much of the dogma of the four schools of fiqh. His efforts focused on transforming to a \\"theo- democracy\\" based on the Sharia which would enforce things like abolition of interest-bearing banks, sexual separation, veiling of women, hadd penalties for theft, adultery, and other crimes. The promotion of Islamic state by Maududi and Jamaat-e Islami had broad popular support. Maududi created Jamaat- e-Islami with the objective of making post-colonial India (or a separate Muslim state if the Muslim League got its wish), an Islamic state. Although this would be the result of an \\"Islamic revolution\\", the revolution was to be achieved not through a mass organising or a popular uprising but by what he called \\"Islamization from above\\", by winning over society's leaders through education and propaganda, and through putting the right people (Jamaat-e- Islami members) in positions of power. incrementally and through legal means.Haqqani, Pakistan: Between Mosque and Military, 2010: p.122 Maududi believed politics was \\"an integral, inseparable part of the Islamic faith\\". Islamic ideology and non-Islamic ideologies (such as capitalism and socialism, liberalism or secularism) were mutually exclusive. The creation of an Islamic state would be not only be an act of piety but would be a cure for all of the many (seemingly non-religious) social and economic problems that Muslims faced. Those working for an Islamic state would not stop at India or Pakistan but would effect a sweeping revolution among mankind, and control all aspects of the world's life. History Maududi opposed British rule but also opposed both the anti-colonialist Muslim nationalist Muslim League's proposal for a separate Muslim state led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, and the composite nationalism (muttahida qaumiyyat) idea of Jam'iyyat al-Ulama-ye Hind and Deobandi scholar Maulana Sayyid Hussain Ahmad Madani for a united independent India with separate institutional structures for Hindus and Muslims. At the time of the Indian independence movement, Maududi and the Jamaat-e-Isami actively worked to oppose the partition of India. Maududi argued that the division of India violated the Islamic doctrine of the ummah and believed that the partition would separate Muslims by a temporal boundary. As such, before the partition of colonial India happened, the Jamaat-e-Islami actively worked to prevent it. In his view Muslims were not one religious or communal group among many working to advance their social and economic interests, but a group \\"based upon principles and upon a theory\\" or ideology. A \\"righteous\\" party (or community) that had \\"a clearly defined ideology, allegiance to a single leader, obedience, and discipline\\",Adams, Maududi and the Islamic State, 1983: p.104 would be able to transform the whole of India into Dar al-Islam. Unlike the fascists and communists, once in power an Islamic state would not be oppressive or tyrannical, but instead just and benevolent to all, because its ideology was based on God's commands.Charles J. Adams (1966), \\"The Ideology of Mawlana Maududi\\" in D.E. Smith (ed.) South Asian Politics and Religion (Princeton) pp.375, 381‚Äì90. In 1940, the Muslim League met in Lahore and passed the Lahore Resolution, calling for autonomous states in the Muslim majority areas of India. Maududi believed the nationalism in any form was un- Islamic, concerned with mundane interests of people and not Islam. In response he launched his own party, Jamaat-e-Islami, founded on 26 August 1941, at Islamia Park, Lahore.Historical Dictionary of Islamic Fundamentalism, 2012:pli Seventy-five people attended the first meeting and became the first 75 members of the movement. Maududi saw his group as a vanguard of Islamic revolution following the footsteps of early Muslims who gathered in Medina to found the first \\"Islamic state\\". Members uttered the Shahada, the traditional statement of conversion to Islam, when they joined, implying to some that Jama'ati felt they had been less-than-true Muslims before joining.Nasr, Mawdudi and the Making of Islamic Revivalism, 1996: p.110 Jamaat-e-Islami was and is strictly and hierarchically organised in a pyramid-like structure. All supporters work toward the common goal of establishing an ideological Islamic society, particularly through educational and social work, under the leadership of the emir.Kepel G.

Muslim Organisations in the Twentieth Century: Selected Entries from Encyclopaedia of the World of Islam. EWI Press, 2012 p.70 , 9781908433091. Maududi sought to educate the elite of the Muslim community in the principles of Islam and correct \\"their erroneous ways of thinking\\" both because he believed societies were influenced from the top down. During the years before the partition of India, Jamaat-e-Islami stood aloof from the intense political fights of the time in India, concentrating on \\"training and organising\\" and refining and strengthening the structure of Jamaat-e-Islami.Adams, \\"Maududi and the Islamic State\\", 1983: p.105-6 Groups associated with Jamaat-e-Islami * Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan, based in Pakistan.

The cheese in ema datshi is home-made from the curd of cow or yak's milk. In the process, the fat is removed from the curd to make butter, and the remaining curd without fat is used to make the cheese. After the cheese is made, a watery liquid is left over, which is used as a soup that can be taken with rice. No part of the curd is wasted.

The fossils consist of two skull fragments. Unlike Neanderthals and Homo sapiens of the time, the frontal skull fragment lacks any development of a brow ridge. This feature led French paleoanthropologists of the time to propose the \\"pre-sapiens\\" theory, in which the line to modern humans was said to have branched off before the appearance of the Neanderthals. Subsequent research has cast doubt on the importance of the Font√©chevade evidence. One of the fossils may be from an immature individual or from a period of time later than its surrounding deposits. The other does not preserve the brow area, but other aspects of its morphology are similar to those seen in Neanderthals.

History Tobias Harry Tilly Snr. The firm can trace its roots to the Hartlepool practice of Edward Turnbull, established in 1842, which later formed the basis of a partnership with Tobias Harry Tilly. Turnbull & Tilly were Notaries Public largely dealing with shipmaster's claims. Tilly took his eldest son into the partnership and the firm continued until Tilly senior's death in 1932. The firm was then expanded by amalgamation with two other local firms. As Temperley, Tilly & Hayward, it moved to larger offices in Church Street, opposite Turnbull's first premises. In 1949 Mr JB Irvine, the son of a West Hartlepool timber merchant, entered into partnership with FWJ Webb. Mr Webb had been practicing with Edward Fryer, a firm established in 1897. As Fryer, Webb & Irvine, the new partnership continued until 1955 when it amalgamated with Harry Bailey & Son, becoming Webb, Bailey & Irvine. The latter practice worked in association with Temperley, Tilly & Hayward amalgamating in 1969.

Action against suspected file sharers On 1 March 2010, Lord Clement-Jones criticised TBI Solicitors along with firm ACS:Law for tactics that they employed when accusing people of copyright infringement. He called TBI Solicitors \\"new entrants to the hall of infamy\\" and their activities \\"an embarrassment to the rest of the creative rights industry\\". On 3 March, UK consumer rights website Which? reported complaints by people who had received letters from TBI Solicitors accusing them of illegally sharing files of pornographic material that belongs to Golden Eye (International). TBI Solicitors threatened legal action against the letters' recipients unless they paid ¬£700 compensation within fourteen days of the date of the letter. On 9 March, Which? reported an undertaking by Lord Young that the government would keep watch on ACS:Law and TBI Solicitors. Which? also asked the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) to investigate whether sending these letters breached the Solicitors Code of Conduct (SCoC). On 1 April, TBI Solicitors notified the SRA that the firm would discontinue sending these letters. In its letter, TBI Solicitors stated that they had been \\"surprised and disappointed\\" by the time and resources required to manage the adverse publicity that their activities had attracted, and were \\"concerned\\" that this adverse publicity could affect other areas of their business. Deborah Prince, head of the Which? in-house legal team believed that TBI Solicitors had indeed breached the SCoC, but TBI solicitors denied this in their letter to the SRA, stating that the decision was \\"based on purely commercial reasons and does not alter our view that our conduct has always complied with the Solicitors Code of Conduct.\\" Later that month TBI said it would end its campaign. John Hall, managing partner at Tilly, Bailey & Irvine Solicitors said in a statement, \\"We have been surprised and disappointed by the amount of adverse publicity that our firm has attracted in relation to this work. Following discussions with our clients we have reluctantly agreed that we will cease sending out further letters of claim.\\" Hall added that the firm was \\"delighted to be able to dispose of this matter in a way that makes it clear that the firm has never acted with any conscious or deliberate impropriety\\".

It has a length of with two or four lanes on each direction in different areas, and is indicated in red in the map. On km marker 31 it connects with National Route A004, the main road to the coastal tourist areas of Mar del Plata and others in Buenos Aires Province. The highway runs (from northeast to southeast) through the partidos of Avellaneda, Quilmes, Berazategui and Ensenada. Autopista Buenos Aires - La Plata pointing southeast in La Boca neighborhood History The origins of this road go back to the Plan Director para Capital Federal y lineamientos estructurales para el Area Metropolitana y su regi√≥n (Directing Plan for Capital Federal and structural guidelines for the metropolitan area and region) written by Buenos Aires City Hall between 1958 and 1965, where they describe, among others, a coastal highway between the cities of Tigre and La Plata. The road planned after studies done starting in 1964 was accepted as it required the least expropriations. As the roadbed coincided in part with Acceso Sudeste which was a federally administered road, when defining the routing of the Autopista Buenos Aires‚ÄìLa Plata, the Federal Department of Public Works (Secretar√≠a de Estado de Obras P√∫blicas de la Naci√≥n) and the Buenos Aires Province Ministry of Public Works (Ministerio de Obras P√∫blicas de la Provincia de Buenos Aires) took part in the discussions and planning. The project was presented for its eventual bidding on 3 August 1967. Although this project had been included in the Trienal Road Plan 1968-1970, the bidding did not take place. On 29 March 1979 the national Department of Transportation and its provincial counterpart signed an agreement were both entities would call for a joint bidding for the construction and widening of the Buenos Aires‚ÄìLa Plata highway, dividing it in three sections: the first between the neighborhoods of La Boca and Hudson, including the bridge over the Riachuelo, the second between Hudson and La Plata and the last one from the junction near Mart√≠n Garc√≠a Avenue until 9 July Avenue. This agreement was ratified by Provincial decree 9343. On 30 March 1980 the Concesionaria Vial Argentino-Espa√±ola (Coviares) company won the bid and obtained the work permits after signing a contract on 2 January 1983. This contract, with state subsidies was re-negotiated several times until September 1994, when the project was added to the Red de Accesos a Buenos Aires (Buenos Aires Access Roads) plan, replacing the state subsidy with an extension of the concession to 22 years. After several stops and starts, on 1 July 1995 the Buenos Aires - Quilmes section was opened to traffic. On 17 November of the same year the connection with Provincial Route 36 in Juan Mar√≠a Guti√©rrez was completed, (road that connects to the southeast of Buenos Aires province). Finally, on 24 May 2002 the section from Hudson to Provincial Route 11 was completed. The original concession contract included the construction of a coastal highway that would join this road with the Autopista Illia going through Puerto Madero and Retiro, in Buenos Aires city, but it was never built. On 17 July 2004, Congress changed its name to Doctor Ricardo Balb√≠n by law #25912 to commemorate the leader of the Uni√≥n C√≠vica Radical. In November 2005 work was started to add a third lane on each direction between Acceso Sudeste and Quilmes () but work was stopped and not resumed. Record set on Buenos Aires - La plata highway in 2015 by Juan Ignacio Chiusaroli at 15:25, averaging 205.25 km/h. Old road Camino General Belgrano westbound in Gonnet neighborhood (La Plata) Before 1979 Nacional Route 1 was placed farther aways from the R√≠o de la Plata, as seen in the green line. The Avellaneda‚ÄìGuti√©rrez section run on the old National Route 2, the continued parallel to the Ferrocarril General Roca railroad until joining Camino General Belgrano, then following to the provincial capital. Through Law #1595 of 1979 the road was transferred to provincial control. Buenos Aires Province took over in 1988, so the section northeast of Juan Mar√≠a Guti√©rrez circle is now part of Provincial Route 36, while the southeast of the circle up until 32nd Street in La Plata, is part of Provincial Route 1.

It involves throwing darts outdoors with a target approximately . A short segment of the BBC TV programme 'Lost Land of the Tiger' (series 1, episode 2: 2010), filmed at a village game in the southeast of the country, implies the following features: 1\\\\. It is a team sport. It seems to involve about 8 to 12 players, but the number of teams is not mentioned. 2\\\\. Competitors (all adult males in the clip, although there is a woman instructing the guest) take turns to throw two darts, one after the other. 3\\\\. These darts are wooden sticks, approximately 20 cm long, with a sharp point at the tip, a bone, wood, or metal collar surrounding the middle 6 cm or so (acting as a handle and to give the projectile enough weight to fly and embed), and four wooden fins at the rear. 4\\\\. The target is a wooden flat-sided post, perhaps 50 cm tall,15 cm wide, and 8 cm thick, stuck into the ground in front of a low bank. Its top is rounded. The front, sides, and top of the post are wrapped in white paper, and the front face has a design marked on it in, seemingly drawn with a black marker pen. Around the curved top is an arc of six small stars. Beneath this is a circle about 4 cm in diameter, with a still smaller circle within it. Directly beneath this is a line, bowed slightly downwards in the middle. A second line, more deeply bowed, appears beneath this, meeting the edges of the post at the same points. A short horizontal mark appears midway between these two curved lines. Beneath the lower curve, and roughly midway up the post, is a circle almost the full width of the post, with a small (approximately 4 cm in diameter) circle within it. A feint figure '2' appears below this. The lowest 15 cm or so of the face is marked off by a horizontal line, below which is a pattern composed of numerous crosses and a curtain-like design. The significance of these markings is not explained, but the middle concentric circles resemble a target. 5\\\\. Over this post is an arch made of thin branches, approximately semicircular, and about 120 cm in diameter. At the points where this arch is embedded in the ground, two wooden uprights are erected, approximately 2.5 metres high. 6\\\\. Other players (or perhaps judges or helpers) stand close to the target, wearing large white cuffs around their wrists, seemingly helping to indicate the target. 7\\\\. The 'court' appears to be double ended, because another, similar target can be glimpsed just behind the thrower. 8\\\\. The game is preceded and followed by singing and dancing. Bhutanese instructors in an annual sports' week event at ICIMOD introduced these Khuru rules: 1\\\\. At least two teams play the game, but a larger reasonable number is allowed. The usual number of players in a team is 5, but there can be fewer or more depending on availability. 2\\\\. Competitors (teams can be single gender or mixed, there are no strict rules about that) in pairs from opposite teams throw two darts one after another, then it is turn for another pair until all the players have had their turn. This is the end of one round. 3\\\\. The game can be played on a round or points basis. The usual game consists of three rounds and the team with highest score wins. 4\\\\. The points are scored if: * the dart sticks to the ground and its wooden handle is closer than about 20 cm from the target, verified by a designated stick (1 point) * the dart hits the target and leaves a mark (1 point) * hits the target and sticks (2 points) * hits the bull's eye (~2 cm diameter circle in the middle of the target) (3 points) 5\\\\. The court is double ended and, once the round is finished, both teams go to the opposite end, points are counted and verified, competitors collect their own darts and the second round starts with target now on the opposite side.

Administratively the Diocese is part of the Archdiocese province of Birmingham. The Shrewsbury Diocesan Pilgrimage to Lourdes is an annual undertaking for over 1000 pilgrims from across the Diocese to the shrine town of Lourdes in Southern France. Traditionally the pilgrimage takes place during the last week of July.  History  The formal history of the pilgrimage begins on 2 January 1951 when the then Bishop of Shrewsbury, Bishop Murphy, proposed \\"to form a committee to make arrangements for an annual pilgrimage to Lourdes.\\"Letter to Deans 2/1/1951 Shrewsbury Diocesan Archive The first pilgrimage, under the direction of Fr Nixon, was organised for that year, and on Tuesday September 4, 1951 a pilgrimage train set off from Birkenhead Woodside carrying 360 pilgrims, calling at Chester and Crewe en route to Folkestone. The pilgrims then crossed by ferry to Boulogne, before taking another train, arriving in Lourdes at 6pm on 5 September. The return journey followed the same pattern, leaving Lourdes at 10:30am on 11 September. On that first pilgrimage a pilgrim travelling first class would have paid the princely sum of ¬£25. By the early 1960s the pilgrimage had grown to include an element travelling by air, to coincide with the pilgrimage train, although this was considered no more than \\"alright\\",Diocese Of Shrewsbury Lourdes Hospitalit√© AGM Minutes 1962 and in 1964 the original Pilgrimage Director Fr Nixon was succeeded by Fr Carroll. In 1969 Fr Carroll made the decision to bring the Diocesan Pilgrimage under the auspices of the Catholic Association and the pilgrimage dates moved to coincide with the association dates (18‚Äì25 August in that year). In the early seventies there was much discussion regarding linking with other local Dioceses, both Salford and Liverpool being suggested, or even restricting the pilgrimage to alternate years. These discussions eventually led to a break away from the Catholic Association, and a further change of dates to late July, coinciding, over time, with both Liverpool and Salford. Rising costs (by 1976 the cost was ¬£175) further promoted the prospect of a linked or diminished pilgrimage, however the Pilgrimage has remained steadfastly individual. Following the breakaway from the Catholic Association, the pilgrimage retained the use of a number of different travel agents, with varying degrees of success, however by the mid-1990s concerns about further increasing costs led to the decision being made for the Diocese to go it alone, and since 1995/96 the Diocese has operated a truly independent pilgrimage, aided by the Maison du Pelerin as a booking agent in Lourdes. Coinciding with the move to independence were two other significant decisions, a return of the pilgrimage flight, which had been discontinued in the 1970s, and a move away from the overnight sleeper train to the modern TGV for the journey through France, the UK rail journey having been replaced by coaches in the mid-1980s. By 2008 the pilgrimage had grown to over 1500, travelling on 2 official flights, 2 TGV trains fed by 12 coaches, as well as a number of direct coach groups.  The Current Pilgrimage  The Pilgrimage travel is organised by the current Director, Fr David Long, and a team of unpaid volunteers. Although some pilgrims make their own way, the vast majority travel on the Diocesan coaches and ferry to the port of Calais in the North of France, and then on to Lourdes on chartered TGVs. The team also arranges the charter of a flight for those Pilgrims who are unable to travel for the 24 hours overland. Pilgrims can stay in a range of hotels, available for most budgets, whilst those who need constant care or medical support are accommodated in the Accueil Notre Dame where they are looked after by a medical team, led by the Matron, of doctors and nurses. However many pilgrims choose to stay in hotels and avail themselves of the assistance provided by the Diocese of Shrewsbury Lourdes Hospitalit√© to ensure that no one misses out on the Lourdes experience. Between the medical team and the Hospitalit√© over 600 helpers are co-ordinated and over 200 pilgrims are assisted through their stay in Lourdes. In 2010, due to the availability of TGV stock, the pilgrimage will once again be travelling on an overnight sleeper train through France, in addition to a direct chartered flight from Manchester to Lourdes.

He was involved in the formation of the Republican Party. Biography=Education He received a common school education, and passed one term in the Jesuit college of Chambly, Quebec. At 15, he was appointed assistant to the state librarian, who was also his guardian, at the state library at Albany. He remained there until 1838. At this time he began to publish poems and sketches in the daily papers, his first contribution being a long poem, which he dropped stealthily into the editor's letterbox, and which appeared the next day with flattering comments, but so frightfully misprinted that he hardly knew it. This experience and a natural aptitude led him to acquire proofreading as an accomplishment, at which he became very expert. The Pioneer In 1841 he went to Boston, where he formed a lifelong friendship with James Russell Lowell, and together they began The Pioneer, a Literary and Critical Magazine, a monthly magazine which the Cyclop√¶dia of American Literature said was \\"of too fine a cast to be successful.\\" Nevertheless, its want of success was due, not to the editors, but to the publisher, who mismanaged it and failed when but three numbers had been issued. Among the contributors were Poe, Hawthorne, Whittier, Neal, Barrett (afterward Mrs. Browning), and the sculptor Story. Carter began in its pages a serial novel entitled The Armenian's Daughter. William H. Prescott He next spent two years in editing statistical and geographical works, and writing for periodicals. His story, \\"The Great Tower of Tarudant,\\" ran through several numbers of the Broadway Journal, then edited by Poe. In 1845 he became a clerk in the post office at Cambridge, and from 1847 to 1848 was private secretary to Prescott the historian. His elaborate article on the character and habits of Prescott, written for the New York Tribune just after the historian's death in 1859, was republished in a memorial volume issued by the Massachusetts Historical Society. Early politics Carter joined the Free Soil Party in 1848, and in 1850 wrote for the Boston Atlas a series of articles in reply to Francis Bowen's attack on the Hungarian revolutionists. These articles were republished in a pamphlet as The Hungarian Controversy (Boston, 1852). They are said to have caused the rejection of Bowen's nomination as professor of history at Harvard. At the same time Carter edited, with Kossuth's approval, a large volume entitled Kossuth in New England (Boston, 1852). From 1851 to 1852 he edited, at first as assistant of John G. Palfrey and afterward alone, the Boston Commonwealth, the chief exponent of the free soilers. For two years he was secretary of the state committee of the Free Soil Party. Republican Party foundation In the summer of 1854, he obtained the consent of the committee to call a convention, which he did without assistance, sending out thousands of circulars to men whose names were on the committee's books. The convention met in Worcester, July 20, was so large that no hall could contain it, and held its session in the open air. A short platform drawn up by him was adopted, together with the name \\"Republican,\\" and on his motion a committee of six was appointed to organize the new party, John A. Andrew being made its chairman. More editing In 1855 Carter edited the Boston Telegraph, in conjunction with W. S. Robinson and Hildreth the historian; in 1856 he edited the Atlas; and from 1857 to 1859 he was Washington correspondent of the New York Tribune. His next work was with George Ripley and Charles A. Dana on the first edition of the American Cyclop√¶dia (1859 to 1863), in which many important articles were from his pen, including \\"Egypt,\\" \\"Hindostan,\\" \\"Mormons,\\" and the history of the United States. In January 1864, he was appointed private secretary of the treasury agent whose headquarters were at Beaufort, South Carolina; and from July of that year until October 1869, he edited the Rochester, New York, Democrat, doing such work for it as was seldom done on any but metropolitan journals. When news came of the assassination of President Lincoln, he wrote, without consulting any book or memoranda, an article giving a brief but circumstantial account, with dates, of every celebrated case of regicide. He was editor of Appletons' Journal from 1870 to 1873. And then he became associate editor for the revision of the American Cyclop√¶dia, writing articles on \\"Jefferson Davis\\" and \\"The Confederate States of American\\". In 1874 impaired health compelled him to discontinue his literary work, and in the next three years he made three tours in Europe. Family His first wife, Ann Augusta Gray, was a successful writer of poems and tales for the young. They married in 1846, and she died in 1863. He married his second wife, Susan Nichols, in 1864. She was principal of the women's art school at Cooper Union in New York City, published handbooks of art and contributed to periodicals. Works He was the author of A Summer Cruise on the Coast of New England (Boston, 1864), which passed through several editions. The 1888 edition has an introduction by Rossiter Johnson with biographical notes. He left unpublished memoirs, of which only the first volume was complete in manuscript.

The area is part of the traditional region of Lower Carniola and is now included in the Southeast Slovenia Statistical Region.Lo≈°ki Potok municipal site It consists of the hamlets of Binkl, Kurja Vas (), Pri Ambro≈æiƒçu, Hrib, and Preska (). The main road from Lazec to Prezid runs through the village.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1971. Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 2. Ljubljana: Dr≈æavna zalo≈æba Slovenije, p. 244. Name The Slovene name Stari Kot and the German name Altwinkel are semantically equivalent, both meaning 'old closed valley', referring to the end of a valley where it meets the mountains.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC, p. 205. The designation 'old' (Stari, Alt-) distinguishes the settlement from Novi Kot () (literally, 'new closed valley.'). Traditionally, the people of Stari Kot and Novi Kot were nicknamed Bajtarji (literally, 'tenant farmers'), but this nickname is rarely used today. History Oral tradition indicates that Stari Kot was founded around 1700. The village had 32 houses in 1770 and had a minority Gottschee German population. The men traditionally performed seasonal work in the forests of Croatia, Hungary, and elsewhere. A part-time school was founded in the village in 1904, and a separate school building was built in 1910. During the Second World War, on 19 April 1942 the men of the village joined the Partisans en masse. On 29 July 1942 Italian forces burned the entire village and removed the population to concentration camps. After the war some of the villagers settled in neighboring villages and others rebuilt their houses with the assistance of the recovery association in Draga. The prewar/postwar number of houses in the village's hamlets were Binkl (11/6), Kurja Vas (4/2), Pri Ambro≈æiƒçu (3/2), Hrib (2/1), and Preska (2/1). Church The local church is built on a hill west of the village next to the cemetery. It is dedicated to Saint Francis Xavier and belongs to the Parish of Draga. It is a late Baroque building that contains three 19th-century wooden altars.Slovenian Ministry of Culture register of national heritage reference number e≈°d 1793 It was consecrated before 1740, but the building's current architecture dates from circa 1900.

First chancellorship  In 858, by which time Xiahou Zi was referred to as the deputy minister of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Bingbu Shilang) and the director of the salt and iron monopolies, Emperor XuƒÅnzong gave Xiahou the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), making him a chancellor de facto. After Emperor XuƒÅnzong died in 859 and was succeeded by his son Emperor Yizong, Emperor Yizong continued to have Xiahou serve as chancellor, and made him Menxia Shilang (ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰æçÈÉé), the deputy head of the examination bureau of government (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng); he also created Xiahou the Marquess of Qiao.New Book of Tang, vol. 182. In 860, when agrarian rebel Qiu Fu (Ë£òÁî´) overran Zhedong Circuit (ÊµôÊù±, headquartered in modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang), it was at Xiahou's recommendation that Emperor Yizong commissioned the general Wang Shi to suppress Qiu's rebellion, and it was said that it was with Xiahou's full support that Wang was fully supplied and was able to defeat Qiu. In late 860, after the end of the Qiu rebellion, Xiahou was made the military governor (Jiedushi) of Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), continuing to keep the Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi title as an honorary title.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 250.  Second chancellorship  In 862, by which time Xiahou Zi was referred to as the former military governor of Xichuan, he was made Zuo Pushe (Â∑¶ÂÉïÂ∞Ñ), one of the heads of the executive bureau, and chancellor again, with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi. It was at Xiahou's recommendation that, in 864, the general Gao Pian was commissioned to recapture Annan (ÂÆâÂçó, in modern Hanoi, Vietnam) from Dali forces. Late in 864, Xiahou was again removed from his chancellor position and made the military governor of Hezhong Circuit (Ê≤≥‰∏≠, headquartered in modern Yuncheng).The Zizhi Tongjian, which gave the date for Xiahou's second removal, actually indicated that he was made the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), but as this conflicts with Xiahou's biographies in the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang ‚Äî and, in particular, an edict quoted in the Old Book of Tang biography ‚Äî it will be assumed here that he was made the military governor of Hezhong, not Hedong. Compare with Old Book of Tang, vol. 177 and New Book of Tang, vol. 182.  After second chancellorship  In 868, when Xiahou Zi was apparently still governing Hezhong, and by which time he was referred to by the title of Duke of Qiao Commandery, Dali forces made a major incursion into Xichuan Circuit. Emperor Yizong, blaming Xiahou for not having fortified Xichuan's defenses while governing Xichuan, issued an edict rebuking Xiahou and relieving Xiahou from his post as military governor of Hezhong. Xiahou was made an advisor to the Crown Prince, with his office at the eastern capital Luoyang.However, as there was no crown prince at the time, the post was entirely honorary. It was said that Xiahou died soon thereafter, but the date is not known.  Notes and references  * Old Book of Tang, vol. 177. * New Book of Tang, vol. 182. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 249, 250.

Severini, independently from Dmitri Fyodorovich Egorov, proved and published earlier a proof of the theorem now known as Egorov's theorem. Biography He graduated in Mathematics from the University of Bologna on November 30, 1897:According to the summary of his student file available from the (an electronic version of the archives of the University of Bologna).The content of this section is based on references and : this last one also refers that he was married and had several children, however without giving any other detail. the title of his \\"Laurea\\" thesis was \\"Sulla rappresentazione analitica delle funzioni arbitrarie di variabili reali\\".An English translation reads as \\"On the Analytic Representation of Arbitrary Functions of Real variables\\"; despite the similarities in the title and the same year of publication, the biographical sources do not say if the paper is somewhat related to his thesis. After obtaining his degree, he worked in Bologna as an assistant to the chair of Salvatore Pincherle until 1900.The 1897‚Äì1898 yearbook of the university already lists him between the assistant professors. From 1900 to 1906, he was a senior high school teacher, first teaching in the Institute of Technology of La Spezia and then in the lyceums of Foggia and of Turin;According to . then, in 1906 he became full professor of Infinitesimal Calculus at the University of Catania. He worked in Catania until 1918, then he went to the University of Genova, where he stayed until his retirement in 1942. Work He authored more than 60 papers, mainly in the areas of real analysis, approximation theory and partial differential equations, according to . His main contributions belong to the following fields of mathematics:Only his most known results are described in the following sections: reviews his research in greater detail. Approximation theory In this field, Severini proved a generalized version of the Weierstrass approximation theorem. Precisely, he extended the original result of Karl Weierstrass to the class of bounded locally integrable functions, which is a class including particular discontinuous functions as members.According to , the result is given in various papers, source perhaps being the most accessible of them. Measure theory and integration Severini proved Egorov's theorem one year earlier than Dmitri EgorovEgorov's proof is given in the paper . in the paper , whose main theme is however sequences of orthogonal functions and their properties.Also, according to , Severini, while acknowledging his own priority in the publication of the result, was unwilling to disclose it publicly: it was Leonida Tonelli who, in the note , credited him the priority for the first time. Partial differential equations Severini proved an existence theorem for the Cauchy problem for the non linear hyperbolic partial differential equation of first order :\\\\left{ \\\\begin{array}{lc} \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x}=f\\\\left(x,y,u,\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right) & (x,y)\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^+\\\\times[a,b]\\\\ u(0,y)=U(y) & y\\\\in[a,b]\\\\Subset\\\\mathbb{R} \\\\end{array}\\\\right., assuming that the Cauchy data U (defined in the bounded interval [a,b]) and that the function f has Lipschitz continuous first order partial derivatives,This means that f belongs to the class C^{(1,1)}. jointly with the obvious requirement that the set \\\\scriptstyle {(x,y,z,p)=(0,y,U(y),U^\\\\prime(y));y\\\\in[a,b]} is contained in the domain of f.For more details about his researches in this field, see and the references cited therein Real analysis and unfinished works According to , he worked also on the foundations of the theory of real functions. lists Severini's researches on this field under as \\"Fondamenti dell'analisi infinitesimale (Foundations of infinitesimal analysis)\\": however, the topics covered range from the theory of integration to absolutely continuous functions and to operations on series of real functions. Severini also left an unpublished and unfinished treatise on the theory of real functions, whose title was planned to be \\"Fondamenti dell'analisi nel campo reale e i suoi sviluppi\\".\\"Foundations of Analysis on the Real Field and its Developments\\": again according to , the treatise would have included his later original results and covered all the fundamental topics required for the study of functional analysis on the real field.

Career  Maguire was born in Dublin as one of six siblings, all of whom became professional musicians. His father Elias, a headmaster and tenor, introduced him to violin lessons at age 6. By age 12, he had won every prize for violin- playing at the principal music festivals in Ireland. Educated at the Belvedere College, in 1944 he gained a four-year scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music in London, where he won the Alfred Waley and Alfred Gibson Prizes for violin playing, and the Cooper Prize and McEwan Prize for quartet playing.

Bayard served as the 16th Mayor of New York City, from 1685 to 1686. He is notable for being Peter Stuyvesant's nephewLandmarks Preservation Commission LP-0645 and for being an immigrant member of the Bayard family, which remained prominent in New York City into the 20th century.\\"Biographical Sketches of Wealthy Men of the Colonial Era in New York\\" Early life Bayard was born in Alphen, Holland, the son of a Huguenot refugee to Samuel Bayard (c. 1615‚Äìc. 1647) and Ann Stuyvesant (1613‚Äì1683), the sister of Governor Petrus Stuyvesant. In May 1647, he accompanied his widowed mother to America. Three other children, Balthazar (who married Maria Lockerman in 1664), Petrus (who married Blandina Kierstede in 1674) and Catharine (who married William De Meyer), also arrived in New Amsterdam. His Aunt Judith Bayard (c. 1615‚Äì1687), the sister of Samuel Bayard, married Director General Stuyvesant, and thus there was a double relationship between the families. Career In 1664, Stuyvesant, whose patronage supported Bayard's career, appointed him clerk of the Common Council, and soon afterward became private secretary to Stuyvesant and received the additional appointment of surveyor of the province. After the re-conquest of New York by the Dutch in 1672, Bayard became secretary of the province. Under the second English regime, in 1685, when Thomas Dongan, 2nd Earl of Limerick, was governor, Bayard was mayor of New York; prior to 1680, New York mayors served one-year terms but thereafter they served two-year terms, with few exceptions. Bayard was one of the exceptions and served only one year. As a member of the governor's council, Bayard drew up the Dongan Charter that was granted in 1686. In 1688, he received, at the head of the regiment of militia of which he was colonel, the restored but cordially detested Governor Edmund Andros. As one of the three resident members of the governor's council, and commander-in- chief of the militia of the province, he was the object of popular hatred during Leisler's Rebellion, and fled to Albany to escape assassination. Returning to attend an only son on his sickbed, he was arrested and briefly imprisoned. He was released upon the arrival of the new governor, Henry Sloughter, who put down the rebellion and sat on the Common Council. A Narrative of an Attempt made by the French of Canada upon the Mohaque's Country, by Colonel Bayard and his friend Lieut.-Colonel Charles Lodowick was published in London in 1693.A facsimile, with an introduction by Adelaide R. Haase, was published in New York, 1903. Bayard was an owner of slaves and slave ships throughout much of his adult life. According to Alan J. Singer, he > was the mayor of New York City under the English from 1685 to 1686 and a > nephew of Dutch colonial superintendent Peter Stuyvesant, the largest > private slaveholder in the Dutch colony.

Aside from his sizeable farm in the \\"Out Ward\\" of New York, Bayard received a license from the notoriously corrupt Governor Benjamin Fletcher in 1694 to buy 4,000 acres along the Schoharie Creek from the Indians, for some ¬£100. When Fletcher chartered his staunch ally's purchase in 1695, the original 4,000 acres became a tract forty miles long and thirty miles broad on both sides of the Schoharie Creek, some 768,000 acres, the Manor of Kingsfield. The Indians were unhappy and repudiated the deal. They found an ally in Governor Bellomont, who replaced Fletcher in 1697 and revoked some of Fletcher's most outrageous land grants, including Bayard's. Colonel Bayard did not relinquish his claim on these lands and went to London to clear his title before the Lords of Trade. Accused in 1702 of high treason before Chief Justice William Atwood, on the basis of a remonstrance signed by him and others, as libelous, he was sentenced to death;Thomas Jones Howell, William Cobbett, David Jardine, eds.

Personal life On 23 May 1666, he married Judith Verlet or Varleth, daughter of Casper Varleth whose brother Nicholas Varleth was Ambassador to Virginia from New Amsterdam. Together, they were the parents of: * Samuel Bayard (1669‚Äì1746), a member of the Colonial Assembly who married Margaretta Van Cortlandt (b. 1674), daughter of Stephen Van Cortlandt and his wife, Gertruj Schuyler, daughter of Philip Pieterse Schuyler, and established the Bayard family in colonial New York, on 12 March 1696.

In Van Aerde's obituary which appeared in 2007 in 'Trouw', it was said that: \\"Ka√Øn was a big success and was even translated, but Frans van Rijen didn't get a penny from it. Just like his father Aad van Rijen he did not have a mind for business. With his publisher 'Urbi et Orbi' he signed a contract stating that he never would earn more than 1000 guilders and that he was not allowed to get another publisher until 1950. Moreover, the book was banned by the Germans, who claimed it was too \\"Jewish-minded\\". They also checked if the writer was an Aryan.\\" As a journalist, Rogier van Aerde also wrote reports for De Volkskrant and the Katholieke Illustratie and later on he made contributions to Margriet and Nieuwe Revu. The books he wrote after Ka√Øn did not get much attention and he never equalled the success of his d√©but.

This method of compounding is used in Rateau and Zoelly turbines. Construction The arrangement consists of a number of simple impulse turbines in series mounted on a common shaft. The exit steam from one turbine is made to enter the nozzle of the succeeding turbine. Each of the simple impulse turbines would then be termed a \\"stage\\" of the turbine. Each stage comprises its ring of nozzle and blades. The steam from the boiler passes through the first nozzle ring where its pressure drops and velocity increases. The high velocity jet steam is directed onto the first moving blades wherein nearly all of its velocity is absorbed. The steam pressure remains unaltered. The steam from the first ring of moving blades enters the second ring of nozzles where its pressure is further reduced and velocity increased again. The next ring of moving blades absorbs the velocity obtained from this second ring nozzle. The process is repeated in the remaining rings until the whole of the pressure has been absorbed. Effect The total pressure drop of the steam does not take place in the first nozzle, but is split equally between all the nozzle rings in the arrangement. The effect of absorbing the pressure drop in stages is to reduce the velocity of the steam entering the moving blades.

He became director of the Institute for Radium Research in Vienna and received the Lieben Prize in 1913 for his research on radium. He was the brother of Hans Leopold Meyer who was also awarded the Lieben Prize. Life and work Stefan was the second son of Jewish parents: a lawyer and notary Gotthelf Karl Meyer and his wife Clara (n√©e Goldschmidt, sister of Victor Goldschmidt). He went to school in Vienna and later graduated from gymnasium in Horn in 1892. He studied physics at the University of Vienna and attended the University of Leipzig for one year. He obtained his PhD in 1896 for work with Franz Serafin Exner and completed his habilitation in 1900. In 1897, Meyer became assistant of Ludwig Boltzmann at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, University of Vienna. His research was dedicated to magnetic permeability of liquids. After a talk of Friedrich Oskar Giesel ‚Äì a pioneer in the research and production of radium ‚Äì he obtained a sample of radium from Giesel to determine magnetic properties of the new element. Meyer and his colleague Egon von Schweidler were able to show that the Becquerel rays (beta rays) could be deflected by magnetic fields; this effect was discovered simultaneously by several scientists, but Meyer et al. also showed that the radiation from polonium (alpha rays) behaved differently in the magnetic field. Meyer was able to organize the production of 4 grams of radium, as recommended in 1901 by the Austrian Academy of Sciences. The chemical plant of Auer von Welsbach, which was used to produce rare earth elements, provided the necessary technical equipment and knowledge for separation of small quantities of material from ore. Meyer became interim head of the institute for one year after the suicide of Boltzmann. During that time, Meyer had also contacted Lise Meitner before she left for Berlin in 1907. Meyer became assistant of Exner in 1908 and professor in 1909. The ample supply of radium which he shared with the Curies in Paris, Rutherford in Manchester and Ramsey in London made him a key figure in the research on radium. The only larger source for radium-containing pitchblende was the Sankt Joachimsthal mines, which were located in Austria-Hungary. To improve the industrial use and mining of radium, Austrian industrialist donated 500,000 Austrian kronen to found an institute for research on radium in 1908. In 1910, the Institute for Radium Research in Vienna was opened. Meyer became its first acting director under Exner who was the official director of the institute. The institute in Vienna opened two years before the Institute du Radium in Paris. During the time when Meyer was acting director, a number of prominent scientists worked at the institute, including George de Hevesy, Victor Francis Hess and Friedrich Paneth. With the Anschluss √ñsterreichs in 1938, the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany, Meyer as a Jew had to leave office. He requested retirement before he was forced out of the institute. He stayed in his house in the countryside of Austria and, because of the intervention of several people, was left unharmed for the rest of the war. His older brother Hans Leopold Meyer, a professor of chemistry, was less protected and was killed in the Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1942. After the war, Meyer was rehabilitated and allowed to return to his Institute as director. Meyer died in Bad Ischl in 1949 and is buried in the Bad Ischl Friedhof. Publications Stefan Meyer published several articles on radioactivity together with Schweidler. He compiled most of the findings on radioactivity in a book. This book became a standard German textbook on radioactivity similar to the book of Curie in French and the book of Rutherford in English. During his forced retirement, he wrote a book on musical instruments and acoustics.

A former official of the Nationalist Vanua Tako Lavo Party (NVTLP),Background Briefing: 4 February 2001 - Fiji: Encore for a Coup at ABC Radio National Waqabaca claims to have been hired by two businessmen, at the behest of the party, to help bomb Nadi International Airport and strategic positions in Suva after the People's Coalition had come to power in the general election of 1999, and to have initially participated in, before withdrawing from, the campaign of unrest that led to the coup d'√©tat which deposed the Chaudhry government in May 2000. He supported similar allegations made by coup-convict Maciu Navakasuasua. In an interview with the Fiji Sun, published on 22 December 2005, Waqabaca said that a religious conversion experience had led him to confess his role in the 2000 coup. The Fiji Sun reported on 6 March 2006 that Waqabaca had applied for the Fiji Labour Party (FLP) nomination for the Suva City Fijian Communal Constituency for the upcoming parliamentary election, due on 6‚Äì13 May 2006. He described the ethnic politics to which he had once subscribed as \\"suicidal\\" and that dialogue with other ethnic leaders was the only way forward. He went on to contest the seat, receiving 675 votes, or 6.84 percent of the 9,865 votes cast. He thus became one of a mere handful of FLP candidates to poll more than five percent in a Fijian communal constituency. The Fiji Sun quoted Waqabaca on 16 March as saying that in late February, he had been confronted by Cabinet Minister Ted Young and rebuked for not joining the ruling Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL), and later by the businessmen who had planned the bombing of Nadi airport, who had forced him to sign a denial of his earlier media plans.

History Stavraton of the Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos (r. 1391‚Äì1425). The name stavraton first appears in the mid-11th century for a gold histamenon showing the Byzantine emperor holding a cross-shaped scepter, but in its more specific sense, it denotes the large silver coins introduced by Emperor John V Palaiologos (r. 1341‚Äì1376, 1379‚Äì1391) in circa 1367 and used for the last century of Byzantine history..For an examination of the chronology of the stavraton and its introduction, see . The late Byzantine coin was probably named after the cross (Greek: œÉœÑŒ±œÖœÅœåœÇ, stavros/stauros) that featured in its presumed model, the double gigliato of Naples and the Provence; alternatively, the name may have derived from the small crosses at the beginning of the coins' inscriptions, an unusual feature for Byzantine currency, although these are not very conspicuous... The coin was designed to replace the defunct gold hyperpyron as the highest-denomination coin in circulation. Hence it was made heavier than any previous Byzantine silver coin, or, for that matter, any contemporary European coin, weighing initially 8.5 grams but falling later to 7.4 grams. It still had only half the value of the hyperpyron however, which remained in use as a notional currency... The stavraton was complemented by fractions of 1‚ÅÑ2 and 1‚ÅÑ8, both in silver. The half-stavraton initially weighed 4.4 grams and gradually declined to 3.7; the one-eighth, known as the doukatopoulon (Greek: Œ¥ŒøœÖŒ∫Œ±œÑœåœÄŒøœÖŒªŒøŒΩ, \\"little ducat\\", duchatelo in Italian sources) or aspron () weighed circa 1.1 grams. Quarter-stavrata were not minted, and the silver Venetian ducats (Greek: Œ¥ŒøœÖŒ∫Œ¨œÑŒøŒΩ, doukaton) were used instead.; . All these coins featured a bust of Christ on the obverse and an imperial bust on the reverse. The inscriptions are fairly uniform, with the reverse featuring an inner and an outer inscription: \\"+[Emperor's name] ŒîŒïCŒ†ŒüŒ§ŒôC Œü Œ†ŒëŒõŒïŒüŒõŒüŒìŒüC / Œò[ŒïŒü]V ŒßŒëŒ°ŒôŒ§Œô ŒíŒëCŒôŒõŒïVC Œ°WŒúŒëŒôWN\\", i.e. \\"Lord (despotes) [Emperor's name] the Palaiologos / by God's Grace, Emperor (Basileus) of the Romans\\". In the stavrata of John V's reign, the inscriptions were in reverse order, and under Manuel II, the inner inscription used the term Autokrator instead: \\"Œò[ŒïŒü]V ŒßŒëŒ°ŒôŒ§Œô AVTOKŒ°ŒëŒ§OŒ°\\"..

About WDI is a statewide non-profit that works to grow and keep good jobs in New York State. WDI uses a range of tools - including ground level information, workforce expertise, and funding - to facilitate projects that build skills and strengthen employer's ability to hire and promote workers. WDI's work often fills gaps not covered by other organizations. History WDI began in 2003 as a partner to the New York State AFL-CIO and Area Labor Federations to provide workforce training and education services to regional and local unions. Its role has since evolved and is now focused more broadly on the growth and retention of good jobs in NYS through a variety of mechanisms including partnerships and collaborations with businesses, unions, other non-profits, educational institutions, and government. Services= Workforce Development  WDI works regionally to identify targeted strategies that address workforce development opportunities and challenges. These strategies can include partnerships, training and/or funding. * Regional Solutions: WDI's strength is its ability to identify trends, quickly fill gaps not covered by other programs, and then move successful programs throughout the state. * Interactive Grants Program: Through a unique grants program, WDI makes investments that lead to workforce development and economic growth. This program is an ‚Äúinteractive‚Äù one, where WDI regional staff work directly with a business, union, or other entity to understand the issue at hand, and then help develop a response. Although WDI works in all sectors of the economy, it has a special interest in two growing sectors that hold particular promise in terms of good jobs: Manufacturing and Energy.  Workforce Support  Many issues impact individuals‚Äô capacity, productivity and earnings in the workplace market. WDI provides programs and services to help individuals thrive in the workplace. * Child Care Subsidy Program: Many families in New York State struggle with the high cost of quality child care even when they are working full-time or nearly full-time. WDI's Child Care Subsidy Facilitated Enrollment Program helps eligible working families apply for financial assistance. WDI staff are available to answer questions and guide families through the application process. In addition, WDI can provide information to aid families in choosing quality, developmentally appropriate care for their children. The subsidy program is currently active in the following counties: Albany, Schenectady, Rensselaer, Schenectady, Erie, Monroe, Oneida, and Onondaga. * Employee Assistance Program: In today's complex world, balancing work-life issues can be challenging. To that end, WDI works with Employee Services, Inc. to offer a comprehensive Employee Assistance Program to businesses and unions at a reduced rate.  Workforce Enrichment  WDI works to build stronger communities by integrating arts, culture, and thought leadership into workforce development efforts. * Arts and Culture: WDI supports the training of individuals for employment within the arts and culture sector and creative economies, opportunities that provide working people the means to express themselves and represent their own lives through the medium of art and culture, and efforts that capture, celebrate and share diverse artistic and cultural practices focusing on work. * Publications: ** _Working Stories - Essays by Reflective Practitioners_ , began as an idea from the WDI Executive Director, Ed Murphy, to capture the life stories, lessons learned, and paths taken from a group of individuals involved in workforce development in NYS. This collection of essays is intended to generate dialogue around paths to development and perhaps serve as guideposts to others navigating similar waters. ** Each year the WDI celebrates women and the contributions they make to the workplace through the _Women Working_ calendar that features extraordinary women and their stories.

He attended technical high school from 1912‚Äì15 and trained as a salesman for an instrument firm and later as a bookkeeper for an insurance firm. He attended Ludwig-Maximillian University in Munich (philosophy and art history, 1914 to 1917) and became active in the Youth Section and later the Pacifist wing of the Social Democratic Party. In 1918, he took part in the Soviet-inspired Bavarian coup d‚Äô√©tat, which was the first spark of the revolutionary fire that swept over Germany in the wake of the armistice. For a few months, Breitenbach also occupied an official position in the new government. Although the revolution was short-lived, the ties he forged with the radical circles of Munich‚Äôs intelligentsia later helped him establish his reputation as a photographer. In 1932, after several unsuccessful years at the head of the family business‚Äîduring which period he was mainly engaged with perfecting his use of a camera‚ÄîBreitenbach opened his first photographic studio. His clients were prominent members of Munich‚Äôs bohemia, including actors and actresses performing in the Munich theater. Munich was a stronghold of libertarians and refined peoples, whose spirit Breitenbach captured in theatrical portraits of his friend, the journalist Theo Riegler. This world vanished in 1933 with Hitler‚Äôs takeover. War Years More than his Jewish roots, the photographer's political past and the active anti-Nazi activity of his teenage son, Hans, made them a target for persecution. In early 1934 a band of Sturmabteilung (SA) storm troopers, members of Hitler‚Äôs private army, banged on the door of Josef's studio looking for Hans. Using a portrait of German nobleman Franz von Papen he‚Äôd taken the year before when he was Chancellor of Germany, and a letter of thanks he‚Äôd received, Breitenbach convinced the troopers that he was under Papen‚Äôs protection. With his passport about to expire, Breitenbach made his way to France a few days later, joining other German exiles seeking refuge in Paris. The Surrealist ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù had by then become dominant in the Parisian art scene. Soon after his arrival, Breitenbach came into contact with Andr√© Breton and his circle. Preferring to retain his independence, he never became a member of the Surrealist group, but did show work in important exhibitions of Surrealist photography alongside Man Ray, Jacques-Andr√© Boiffard, Brassa√Ø, Eli Lotar, Henri Cartier-Bresson, and Roger Parry. Breitenbach only lived in Paris for six years, until the war broke out in 1939. Yet during this period, he produced some of his most inventive work. He adopted several techniques favored by new photographers such as superimpression, montage, solarization, printing in negative, and the photogram. More importantly, he was one of the rare artists of the pre-War years to produce color photographs. Examples are the images Montparnasse, Portrait of a Woman in Black and Red, and Forever and Ever. However, these prints are not in color, but colors, using processes of bleaching, toning, and pigment. Also during his years in Paris, he was an active member of the German exile community, which alerted the democratic world to the threat of fascism. He participated in the 1938 exhibition by the Union des Artistes Allemands Libres, \\"Five Years of Hitler Dictatorship\\".\\"Josef Brietenbach: Visages de l'exil\\" (PDF) M√©morial de la Shoah / Mus√©e, Centre de documentation juive contemporaine. Press packet. (May 18 ‚Äì September 11, 2005), p. 7\\\\. Retrieved February 13, 2012 A high point for Breitenbach was his collaboration with Bertolt Brecht, summarized by portraits of the playwright. The war interrupted this second chapter of the photographer‚Äôs life. Interned by the French as a suspicious alien, then drafted into a civilian corps composed of foreigners, Breitenbach eventually escaped to New York from Marseille in 1941. New Life in America Breitenbach seemingly had no trouble adjusting to America. New York, the city in which he would spend the rest of his life, became home to him, as evidenced by his photomontage of 1942, \\"We New Yorkers.\\" He responded to the electric beat of the city, composing photographs such as \\"Radio City\\" (1942) that have a jazz-like quality. His first teaching appointment was at Black Mountain College near Asheville, North Carolina, where he was invited by Josef Albers to teach as Visiting Instructor in photography in summer 1944. In New York City, he taught at Cooper Union from 1946-1966 and the New School for Social Research from 1949-1975. The 1950s and 1960s were years of intense activity for Breitenbach. He did photographic reportage in Asia for the United Nations and other varied businesses, documenting relief work. He exhibited his photographs extensively in Europe in the 1930s (especially in Paris) and in the United States from the 1940s to the mid-1960s, including at the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where he had work selected by Edward Steichen for the Museum's international touring exhibition The Family of Man. The time not spent on the road was spent absorbed by his teaching at Cooper Union and The New School. After Life Since his death, there have been 26 one-person exhibitions of his work, shown New York, Paris, Berlin, Munich, and multiple other locations in both Europe in the United States. Eight books have been published on his work, including two by Larissa Dryansky (Josef Breitenbach and Josef Breitenbach Manifesto) and Josef Breitenbach Photographien, published by Schirmer/Mosel. The Josef Breitenbach archive is located at the Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona, Tucson.

His practice as an artist is usually associated with monochrome, concrete, modernist, post, color-based, radical, minimalist, and abstract painting. Life and work Ebnother has been living and working in Stanley, New Mexico since 2000. He mixes and grinds his own pigments. His oils, in hand-ground dry pigment on stretched linen and wood panels, are characterized by rich impasto, dense pigmentation, and dense markings. Ebnother trained as a ballet dancer. He has said that he considers painting and dance to be similar art forms: \\"Painting is a very sensual and tactile experience, as is dance. Both rely on instinctual decisions, with the critical eye entering and judging after the act.‚Äù His understanding of elevation, extension, and balance comes through in his dispersed composition and the agility of his paint handling. The high pigment-to-oil ratio and furrowed surfaces of these paintings combine to create an unusually saturated color with a grounded, concrete physicality.

Together with the Obedjiwan and the Coucoucache Indian Reserve No. 24, it belongs to the Atikamekw First Nation.Indian and Northern Affairs Canada - Aboriginal Community profile: Wemotaci First Nation The reserve, an enclave within the city of La Tuque, is bordered to the west and south by the Saint-Maurice River, whereas its eastern boundary is about long, and its northern boundary is . It is accessible by gravel road from La Tuque's town centre through the hamlet of Sanmaur that is on the opposite shore of the Saint-Maurice River. Also at this location, the Canadian National Railway crosses the river and has a siding at Sanmaur.  Economy  The local economy is based on the art and craft, shops and services, forestry, trapping, construction, tourism, transport and outfitters. Etymology Like many other native names, Wemotaci underwent many spelling variations over time. The oldest reference to the toponym is from 1724. In 1827, it was written as Montachene, and in 1829 as Weymontachinque, in 1830 as Waimootansking, in 1832 as Weymontachingue and Warmontashingen, in 1837 as Warmontaching. The 1932 spelling of Weymontachingue on the map of John Arrowsmith became the most common form until 1986, when it was replaced by Weymontachie, as demanded by the local band council. The standardized writing of the Atikamekw language spells it as Wemotaci, which was made official in March 1997. History The area of the upper Saint-Maurice River had long been the homeland and hunting grounds of the Atikamekw indigenous people. Some sources claim that the North West Company had already established a trading post at this place between 1770 and 1780, but this remains doubtful. Confirmation of the existence of a trading post at Wemotaci came in 1806, when Jean-Baptiste Perrault built the first structures for fur trading. In 1821, the post was taken over by the Hudson's Bay Company. In 1851, the Government enacted the allotment of of land as reserves for the use and benefit of the \\"Indian\\" tribes residing in Lower Canada. Two years later, these lands were distributed among the Atikamekw, Algonquins, and Abenakis by John Rolph, Commissioner of Crown Lands. On August 9, 1853, this was made official by the Governor General in Council.Natural Resources Canada - Legal Surveys Division, Historical Review - Wemotaci But the Atikamekw didn't give up their nomadic life and settle on the reserve. And it wasn't until 1895 that the reserve was surveyed. The construction of a dam and the National Transcontinental Railway led to the growth of the Sanmaur settlement, which in turn attracted the Atikamekw to the reserve at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1939 however, the Hudson's Bay Company left Weymontachingue and due to lack of funding for maintenance of the village, its population stopped growing after 1950, when its inhabitants began to leave and settled either in Sanmaur or in other nearby villages. In the 1970s, the village revitalized. A new village was built closer to its namesake mountain. In 1971, the Federal Government bought the lands of the Hudson's Bay Company and these were subsequently added to the reserve. In May 2010, many residents of Wemotaci were evacuated as a forest fire threatened their homes.Quebec forest fire force 1,300 from homes - Demographics Historic populations:Statistics Canada: 1996, 2001 census * Population in 2001: 1042 * Population in 1996: 856 * Population in 1991: 708 Mother tongue: * English: 0% * French: 3.4% * Atikamekw: 96.2% * Other: 0.4%  Education  There are two schools on the reserve: * √âcole Seskitin, Pre- Kindergarten to Secondary grade 1 * √âcole Waratinak Nikanik, grades Secondary 1 to Secondary 5  See also  * Sanmaur, Quebec * Manouane River (La Tuque) ReferencesExternal links * Conseil de la Nation Atikamekw Category:Atikamekw Category:Communities in Mauricie Category:Indian reserves in Quebec Category:Hudson's Bay Company trading posts Category:La Tuque, Quebec ","title":"Wemotaci"},{"id":"26527779","text":"Equestrian sports are sports that use horses as a main part of the sport.

Once imaging is complete the image can be transfer to a wide variety of substrates including papers, boards, shrink wrap, plastics, metals, etc. The system comes in two sizes: The 3-page model images a proof 13.3 √ó 20.9 in. (338 √ó 530 mm); the 4-page model images a proof 26.6 √ó 20.9 in. (676 √ó 530 mm) The Approval is similar to the Fuji FinalproofFINALPROOF product. Another similar lamination device is the Creo SpectrumDigital Halftone Proofing (Spectrum) Option (now supported by Kodak) which is unique in that proofs are created on the actual plate-setting device (the Creo/Kodak Trendsetter). History The Approval was introduced to the market by Kodak in 1991, and continues to be sold and used in printing shops as of 2010. The Approval Classic (original) version quickly became the market standard for contract proofs. That was quickly followed in 1995 by Approval PS. In 1998 there was a major redesign which is the basis for the contemporary product. The Approval NX released in 2004 decreased the printing time of spot colors giving users significant productivity improvements. There is continued research and development aimed at improving the quality and usefulness of Approval output. Prepress Applications The Approval was designed to mimic the quality of Printing presses using high resolution imaging (2,400 or 2,540 DPI similar to the printing plate) and halftone screening to accurately reflect what would be seen on press. Stochastic screening (or FM screening) can also be used to proof print runs with this screening technique. Being able to simulate screening effects with high fidelity makes it possible to detect undesirable screening artifacts (i.e. Moir√© patterns) before going to press, consequently saving customers time and money. The Approval system allows control over screen angles, screen ruling, density control per color, dot gain adjustment and dot shapes. The wide range of color donors makes it possible to simulate accurately process, corporate, brand, spot and special colors. Process donors include cyan, magenta, yellow and black. Additional donors, orange, green and blue, extend the color gamut. There are 2 opaque donors: white and metallic. The metallic donor combined with the other color donors allows for the creation of a wide range of metallic colors such as gold, copper, bronze, etc. This produces special effects not possible via inkjet printers but commonly used in today‚Äôs packaging. The Approval is especially useful in packaging applications because it is possible to transfer the images to so many of the different substrates used in the packaging industry. The white donor is a critical tool in replicating packaging printing that will be applied to clear packaging. The adjustable laydown order allow exact representation of the prepress shops most difficult print jobs such as package labels and lottery cards were white or silver is required on the top and bottom. Often customers want three-dimensional mock-ups of the actual package. This could be cardboard, metal (i.e. aluminum pop can), glass, plastic, shrink wrap, etc. Approval proofs are highly effective for these applications. As of 2010 the Approval supports several certified workflows: Kodak Proofing Software (KPS), Prinergy, Kodak (HQ-1), Brisque, EskoArtwork FlexRIP and Nexus, and Rampage RIPS / workflows with direct connections through the Open Front End (OFE) interface. Nexus, MetaDimensions, and Screen Trueflow all interface through the Approval Interface Toolkit software (AIT).

Although he was born in the Mississippi Delta, Burns has spent nearly all his life in Chicago. His elder brother, Eddie \\"Guitar\\" Burns, was a Detroit blues musician. Biography Jimmy Burns was born in Dublin, Mississippi and raised on the Hilliard Cotton Plantation where he learned to play one-string and 12-string guitar. He was the youngest of eleven children. He sang in a church choir when he still lived in the Delta and he was influenced by the blues he heard on the streets. His favorite blues musician was Lightnin' Hopkins. Burns's father was a sharecropper who performed as a singer in medicine shows. At the age of 12, Jimmy Burns moved with his family to Chicago and four years later joined The Medallionaires who recorded a couple of doo-wop tracks. Recording mostly solo in the 1960s, Burns issued singles for the USA, Minit, Tip Top and Erica labels. He toured the Midwest with his backing group, the Fantastic Epics, and with another outfit called Jimmy Burns and the Gas Company into the early 1970s. Burn's 1972 single, \\"I Really Love You\\" was named in the top 500 singles of Northern soul in 2000, and it is sought by collectors. Burns took a long break from the music industry after the early 1970s to raise his family and run a barbecue stand. He performed infrequently until the early part of the 1990s, when he started a long residency at Chicago's Smokedaddy Club. It was there that Delmark Records boss Bob Koester first heard Burns perform, and agreed to record him after hearing only one set of music. His debut album for Delmark in 1996, Leaving Here Walking, was produced by Scott Dirks, and was awarded the 'Best Blues Record of the Year' title by the National Association of Independent Record Distributors, and received two W.C. Handy Award nominations. Burns then began touring internationally. The more recently formed Jimmy Burns Band includes Anthony Palmer (guitar), E.G. McDaniel (bass), and James Carter (drums). Jimmy Burns played guitar on his brother Eddie's 2002 album Snake Eyes. Burns's wife, Dorothy, died on February 12, 2010. They had six children.

History Citrus Hill High School opened on August 18, 2005 with 651 enrollees grades 9-10. Citrus Hill High School (CHHS) is located on 60 acres in the unincorporated area of Perris in the County of Riverside, approximately nine miles southwest of Moreno Valley and three miles southeast of Riverside. The community in which CHHS is located consists of primarily rural, residential community with some commercial and retail service businesses. The immediate area consists of single family homes and ranch style properties. The school name refers to the former orange groves. The school now serves approximately 2,200 students. It also serves 146 special education enrollees. Students' families are largely nuclear families in the lower to middle socio- economic range. The most recent demographic data shows Citrus Hill High School has an ethnically-diverse population, with 73% of students Hispanic, 14% African-American, and 10% White. The remaining 3% includes Native American, Asian, Pacific Islander, and Filipino students. About 17% of the students are English Learners, and 67% qualify for free or reduced lunch. Campus Citrus Hill students begin their day at 7:30 a.m., complete with six (possibly seven) periods of instruction, and end their day at 2:39 or 3:40 p.m. (end time for seventh period). The school year is divided into two 18-week semesters. Successful completion of each course earns five credits per semester. Academic class size has a maximum enrollment of 33 students per class or a maximum of 165 students per day. Citrus Hill High School provides students with a variety of co-curricular and extra-curricular activities. Currently, there are nearly two dozen academic support/co-curricular clubs active on camps along with sixteen cultural and service clubs which provide students with a large selection of choices for extra curricular activities. In addition, there are sixteen competitive athletic teams, many with three levels of participation. Citrus Hill High School is staffed with full-time Activities and an Athletic Director to provide support for these programs and to provide a stronger school connectedness and participation among the student body. Currently 25% of students participate in a co-curricular class/activity and 21% participate in athletics. Activities and organizations Citrus Hill High School has many support services for all grade levels. The Link Crew program serves to train and support upperclassmen mentors for the ninth grade class. Most ninth grade advisory classes have two Link Crew members for a class of 20-25 students. Link Crew leaders must qualify for the program by maintaining a grade point average of 2.5. The leaders know that they are considered role models and behave as such. The Associated Student Body is in charge of all social activities for the student body. There are student representatives from all grade levels. In order to qualify for ASB, students must maintain a 2.0 grade point average. The program is open to any student that qualifies and has the desire to learn how to become an effective leader. ASB has elected-officer positions for the school as a whole and for each grade level. Students are elected to these positions by their grade-level peers and help to facilitate meetings. Excessive discipline issues or not meeting the required GPA serve as cause for removal from the program. The students at Citrus Hill benefit from the many ASB activities including dances, Pep rallies, lunchtime activities, spirit weeks, and the like. ASB also publishes a Daily Bulletin that is broadcast daily to all 2nd period classes to announce upcoming events and requirements. Monthly, there is a school-wide unity day that focuses on cultural diversity and teacher-to-student relationship building. On these Fridays, teachers and students attend performances from various school groups during the advisory period. Planners ensure that the performances celebrate the diverse populations of Citrus Hill. The choral program is one part of an extensive electives program offered at Citrus Hill High School. The three levels of choir offered are; Beginning Choir, Jazz Choir, and Chamber Singers. The leveling of the choral program allows students to participate in that choir that best suites their performance skills while fulfilling the required fine arts credit. In addition, Chamber Singers meets the University of California and California State University's A-G subject requirements. All groups are performing groups; however, Jazz Choir and especially Chamber Singers compete extensively with other high school choral groups. Citrus Hill's active drama department regularly produces two full productions a year. Once a year, there is a musical uniting effort with band and choir. Furthermore, there are additional showcase performances where students are able to do their class projects for a larger community. The art program features an annual show where students are able to share selected works with the campus community. With two AP courses, the art program does much to prepare college bound students for UC/CSU admissions. The Talon, the yearbook of Citrus Hill High School, is a full-color book with 172 pages. Students use various types of publishing software and completely digital photographs. The staff of dedicated students works during their class time, as well as before and after school, covering events both on- and off-campus. The intent of the yearbook is to document each school year by highlighting the positive and significant events fairly and accurately, in a style that is visually attractive and professionally designed. Students learn Associated Press styles and formats used in journalism publications.

He is president of Public Response, a digital agency that services non-profit organizations and trade unions in the fields of online engagement and government relations. He also founded the Rideau Institute, a non-profit, independent research, consulting and left-leaning advocacy group located in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The Rideau Institute specializes in defence and foreign affairs policy. Biography Staples was born in Fredericton, New Brunswick in 1966 and now lives in Ottawa, Ontario. He attended Fredericton High School and has a Bachelor of Education from the University of New Brunswick. Over the past 25 years, Staples has been involved with a number of organizations that promote peace, disarmament and restrictions on international trade. He has acted as the director of security programs for the Polaris Institute, issue campaigns coordinator for the Council of Canadians and the coordinator for End the Arms Race. Staples was part of the anti-globalization movement, participating in protests at a meeting of the WTO in Seattle in 1999. Speaking at a meeting of NGOs, he linked corporate globalization to militarization and argued that \\"the WTO is a weapon of mass destruction.\\" Along with Peter Coombes, he is the founder of Ceasefire.ca, a network of 25,000 Canadians interested in peace and social justice issues. Ceasefire.ca acts as the public outreach and advocacy arms of the Rideau Institute, and focuses on internet-based campaigning. Staples is also a member of the Canadian Pugwash Group, the Group of 78 and the international network of anti-nuclear groups, Abolition 2000. On 20 October 2012, Staples received the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Medal from Ottawa Centre Member of Parliament Paul Dewar, for his commitment to peace and international security through disarmament.  Writing and advocacy  Staples has written one book, Missile Defence: Round One (James Lorimer & Company Ltd., 2006) and was co-editor with Lucia Kowaluck of the anthology Afghanistan and Canada: Is There an Alternative to War (Black Rose Books, 2008). He has also written and co-written reports about Canadian security and defence matters: *Staples, Steven, \\"Pilot Error: Why the F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter is wrong for Canada,\\" Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives October 2010. *Staples, Steven and Mike Wallace, \\"Ridding the Arctic of Nuclear Weapons: A Task Long Overdue,\\" Rideau Institute and Canadian Pugwash Group March 2010 *Staples, Steven, and Bill Robinson, \\"More Than the Cold War: Canada‚Äôs military spending 2007‚Äì08,\\" Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives October 2007 *Staples, Steven, \\"No Bang for the Buck: Military contracting and public accountability,\\" Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives June 2007 *Staples, Steven, \\"Marching Orders: How Canada abandoned peacekeeping ‚Äì and why the UN needs us now more than ever,\\" The Council of Canadians October 2006 *Staples, Steven and Bill Robinson, \\"Canada's Fallen: Understanding Canadian Military Deaths in Afghanistan,\\" Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives September 2006 Staples is a regular commentator on programs like CTV News and CBC News Network, and contributes to major Canadian news chains like The Globe and Mail and the Toronto Star. Policy positions=Afghanistan Staples is opposed to Canada's military presence in Afghanistan and has advocated for a negotiated settlement with the Taliban. In a 2006 report for the Council of Canadians, Staples argued: ‚Äú‚Ä¶Afghanistan must be rescued from the current cycle of violence. But Canada is complicit in this violence and should have never taken up its current ‚Äòcounter-insurgency‚Äô war-fighting role in Kandahar. Instead, we should refocus our role in the country on diplomatic measures to win ‚Äòthe hearts and minds‚Äô of the Afghan people, extend the legitimacy of the Afghan government, and ensure that aid dollars can reach those who need it most.‚Äù Canadian Defence Policies Staples has been a vocal critic of increases to Canadian military spending. In a 2012 presentation to the House of Commons Standing Committee on National Defence, Staples argued that the Canadian government has and continues to overspend on defence, and should reduce National Defence spending in order to return to pre-September 2001 levels. Staples made similar arguments in a 2011 presentation to the House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance. Commenting on why the Government of Canada would set up military bases around the world to the Toronto Star's Thomas Walkom, Staples said: ‚ÄúThe notion that we‚Äôre going to have permanent bases around the world is over the top. I don‚Äôt understand the rationale for parking a bunch of equipment in Singapore in case we might need it some time. That‚Äôs why we bought C-17s in the first place ‚Äì so we could move troops and material quickly.‚Äù In May 2012, Staples contributed an op-ed to Embassy Magazine on why Canada does not need a defence industry, arguing that the industry takes up too much of the government's time, money and effort. He urged the Canadian government to create jobs by spending in other areas like education, and warned against concentrating too much on defence production thereby leaving the Canadian economy vulnerable to collapse. Canadian F-35 II Lightning Purchase Staples is strongly opposed to Canada's purchase of the F-35 II Lightning stealth fighter jets. Canadian magazine Maclean's once called him the \\"most outspoken critic of the purchase\\". His 2010 report, Pilot Error: Why the F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter is wrong for Canada, was published by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. In a press release for the report, Staples argued: ‚ÄúThis is a massive commitment of defence spending on ‚Äòflying Cadillacs‚Äô that is being driven by defence contractors, not by a clear-eyed view of Canada‚Äôs defence needs‚Ä¶Defending and controlling Canadian and North American airspace doesn‚Äôt require purchasing high-end first strike stealth fighters.‚Äù Staples contributed to two documentaries in 2012 that examined the Canadian government's decision to purchase the F-35: \\"Runaway Fighter\\" by CBC Television's the fifth estate and \\"Air Rage\\" by CTV's W5. Nuclear disarmament Staples is a strong proponent of nuclear disarmament and is involved with numerous anti-nuclear organizations. He is a director on the board of the Canadian Pugwash Group, a member of the Group of 78 and a member of the Coordinating Committee of Abolition 2000. In a 2007 opinion piece for Embassy Magazine, Staples argued: ‚ÄúNow is the time for nuclear disarmament. Now is the time for Canada to join other middle power nations to avert a global catastrophe and abolish nuclear weapons.‚Äù In 2010, he co-authored the report Riding the Arctic of Nuclear Weapons: A Task Long Overdue with Michael Wallace, a former professor emeritus of the University of British Columbia. The report provides evidence that the Arctic is becoming a zone of increased military competition and follows in the footsteps of the Canadian Pugwash Group by issuing a call for the establishment of an Arctic Nuclear-Weapons-Free Zone. Peacekeeping Staples has spoken out in favour of a continuing commitment by Canada to United Nations peacekeeping missions. His 2006 report for the Council of Canadians, Marching Orders: How Canada abandoned peacekeeping ‚Äì and why the UN needs us now more than ever, argued that Canada should provide more support to UN missions. In a July 2012 piece by Paul Koring of The Globe and Mail on Canada's role in international peacekeeping, Staples commented: ‚ÄúThe need is greater than ever but Canada‚Äôs contribution has never been lower, the Harper government doesn‚Äôt regard peacekeeping as a route to enhancing Canada‚Äôs international stature.‚Äù References External links  *Rideau Institute on International Affairs website *Ceasefire.ca *Abolition 2000 *The Canadian Pugwash Group Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian activists Category:Canadian non-fiction writers Category:University of New Brunswick alumni Category:Writers from Fredericton ","title":"Steven Staples"},{"id":"26528332","text":"Tokyo Muzical Hotel (typeset in promotional material as TOKYO MUZiCAL HOTEL) is the second full-length album by Sug.

Reviews noted that \\"even without his impressive physique, [Waldmann] has a winning way about him with a wonderful engagement with the text and captures the impetuosity and passion of this slighted young noble perfectly\\" with a performance that is \\"engagingly nerdy\\" with an \\"electrifying\\" sexual frisson.  Horatio in Hamlet (dir David Farr)  In Hamlet, he played Horatio, an \\"affable, bespectacled housemaster who wears Scandinavian sweaters\\" played by \\"the now consistently worthwhile Alex Waldmann\\", \\"putting in yet more fine work for the RSC\\".

The production received 5 star reviews from The Telegraph and The Guardian. Charles Spencer writing in The Telegraph said, \\"Alex Waldman mercilessly lays bare the callow insolence of the hard-drinking, charmlessly laddish Bertram\\". Michael Billington noted, 'As for Alex Waldmann's Bertram, he is less an irredeemable rotter than the damaged product of a laddish, battle-hungry culture: it is clear he secretly fancies Helena but is seduced even more by the thrill of danger and a world in which the French gentry are \\"sick for breathing and exploit\\".'  Brutus in Julius Caesar (dir Angus Jackson)  In 2017, Alex will play the role of Brutus in Angus Jackson's Julius Caesar. The play is part of the RSC's Rome Season.https://www.rsc.org.uk/julius-caesar/cast-and-creatives Recent theatre career=Sam Wanamaker Playhouse opening season In January 2014, Waldmann was cast as Antonio in The Duchess of Malfi which was the opening production of the new Sam Wanamaker Playhouse.

Jonah and Otto at Park Theatre (dir Tim Stark) In 2014, Waldmann played Jonah in Robert Holman's Jonah and Otto at the Park Theatre which was directed by Tim Stark. What's on Stage said \\"Alex Waldmann captures both the strength and the weakness of Jonah, a troubled 26-year-old trying to be a good father and carting his infant daughter around with him in a trolley. It is a challenging role and Waldmann gets the balance between Jonah's vulnerability and his abrasiveness just right, making him both likeable and, at the same time, repulsive.\\". The Evening Standard said \\"Waldmann's Jonah is a beguiling mix of mischief and shyness.\\" Lynn Gardner in The Guardian praised Waldmann's performance stating, \\"Alex Waldmann is terrific, too, as the angelic and devilish Jonah, capturing the desolation that lurks behind the unnerving facade of alternating charm and aggression.\\"  Widowers' Houses Orange Tree Theatre (dir Paul Miller) In December 2014, Waldmann starred in the Orange's Tree production of Widowers' Houses Waldmann played the doctor, Harry Trench. Dominic Cavendish commented that \\"Alex Waldmann exudes bluff, wide-eyed likeability as Harry Trench, the young gentleman who falls for Sartorius's daughter only to (briefly) recoil on learning of this self-made man's insalubrious source of income, but his dawning cynicism needs to come at more evident personal cost.\\" Michael Billington felt that there was \\"There is lively support from Alex Waldmann as the culpably naive Trench\\". Paul Taylor in the Independent described Waldmann as \\"excellent\\". and Sarah Hemming in The Financial Times felt, \\"Alex Waldmann's touchingly impulsive Trench blithely flouts convention to the despair of Cokane.\\" King John Shakespeare's Globe (dir James Dacre) Temple Church, London = Waldmann is now playing the Bastard in the Globe's production of King John. Michael Coveney on What's On Stage comments that he thought. \\"Waldman, [sic] too, transforms the character's villainy into comic and appealing complexity.\\" Sam Marlow in The Times was also very positive about the production and gave it 4 stars. Marlowe observed that, \\"Alex Waldmann, as the Bastard, Lionheart's illegitimate son, supplies both swashbuckling swagger and sardonic commentary.\\" The Express gave the production five stars and commenting on Alex's role, said, \\"The key player here is the common man Faulconbridge, the bastard son of Richard the Lionheart and a kind of proto Bolingbroke, fearless, tribal and a bit of a bruiser with a native intelligence.\\" = Holy Sepulchre Church, Northampton = Reviews for Waldmann's performance at The Holy Sepulchre, Northampton were very positive from both the local and national Press. There was praise for Alex's performance from the Northampton Herald and Post. \\"The whole cast is strong with Alex Waldman [sic] as The Bastard witlessly brimming with lionhearted courage particularly eyecatching.\\" The Stage Review gave the production five stars, saying, \\"Waldmann excels as the hot-headed bastard heir who acts as narrator and rabble-rouser. When not talking to the audience, he blasts John with rhetoric in a hopeless attempt to give the king some backbone.\\" The Stage gave the production five stars saying, \\"Alex Waldmann excels as the Bastard, but his comic ability and the intimacy of his dialogue to individual members of the audience shows a touch of genius.\\" Lyn Gardner in The Guardian saw Waldmann demonstrating his ability to play future roles. She said, \\"Alex Waldmann, clearly limbering up for an assault on Richard III ‚Äì just as many believe Shakespeare was himself doing with this play ‚Äì is entertaining as the Bastard.\\" = Shakespeare's Globe = After playing for four nights at Salisbury Cathedral, King John moved on to play at the Globe until 27 June 2015. The Exeunt Magazine said, '[...] the show belongs to Alex Waldmann as The Bastard [...]', and continues 'Waldmann's smiling unpolished Bastard nevertheless develops a similar easy complicit relationship with the audience.' Time Out said, \\"Alex Waldmann's charismatic The Bastard works the audience nicely [‚Ä¶].\\" Wars of the Roses, Rose Theatre (dir Trevor Nunn) Waldmann played Henry VI in Trevor Nunn's Wars of the Roses which was staged at the Rose Theatre, and finished on 31 October 2015. Waldmann received enormously positive reviews for his portrayal of Henry VI. Henry Hitching writing in The Evening Standard said, \\"The undoubted star is Alex Waldmann as Henry VI. At first he seems absurdly childlike, fidgety and uncertain. As he develops into a passive and politically limp monarch, Waldmann delicately conveys his mix of fecklessness and saintly idealism, contrasting strikingly with the steely, dominant Joely Richardson as his queen, Margaret of Anjou.\\" Alex Ramon writing in the Reviews Hub was equally full of praise for Waldmann's performance saying, \\"Alex Waldmann is a sensational King Henry, growing and deepening from innocent youth to a kind of piousness that seems indistinguishable from deep inner strength. Buffeted so much by fortune, his Henry finally seems to be able to accept both victory and defeat with equal equanimity, even, in a startling final moment of forgiveness, tenderly kissing his murderer.\\"  In the Night Time (Before the Sun Rises) at the Gate Theatre (dir Ben Kidd) Waldmann was cast as the man in The Gate Theatre's In the Night Time (Before the Sun Rises) by Nina Segal The production closed on Saturday 27 February 2016.

One variation of cocada in Brazil is the \\"black cocada\\" () made with brown sugar and slightly burnt coconut. In Brazil, \\"rei da cocada preta\\" (black cocada king) is used to refer to an arrogant person who thinks too highly of himself. Although similar, cocadas and queijadinhas are not the same thing. The cocada is usually made from coconut and sugar only, rolled together to form an amorphous mass. Queijadinha is made with more ingredients, and gets its shape from the baking tin. Venezuela In Venezuela, conserva de coco is a candy and cocada is a drink blended with coconut and the confectionery or candy form is called \\"conserva de coco\\".

In 1969, following the departure of founding editor Bill Jay, Turner became assistant editor to Creative Camera's founder and publisher, Colin Osman. David Brittain, writing in Afterimage Journal, said \\"Over the next nine years Creative Camera became a pillar of the support structure for photography in the United Kingdom and a byword for good taste\\". He left Creative Camera in 1978 to set up with his partner, Heather Forbes, the short-lived photographic publisher Travelling Light in 1980 in Putney. Its publications included the first edition of Chris Steele-Perkins' The Teds. In 1986, with Travelling Light in financial difficulties, Turner returned to Creative Camera as editor, welcoming colour photography (\\"by championing younger documentarists such as Paul Graham, Martin Parr, Paul Seawright, Anna Fox, and emerging transcendental formalists including Peter Fraser\\") and tolerating the photographic work of \\"fine artists\\". Turner curated photography exhibitions for the Arts Council of Great Britain, the Barbican Art Gallery, London (notably American Images: Photography 1945‚Äì1980 in 1985) and the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford.

Playing career Lehkosuo played most of his career at HJK Helsinki. He was not a very prominent youth player and made his top division debut in 1993 after spending three years with lower division club Vantaan Pallo. He did not make his breakthrough into the HJK senior squad until 1995, when he made 24 league appearances and scored one goal. In the previous season he had even played one league match for FF Jaro. In the following seasons Lehkosuo received more and more responsibilities and became one of the best midfielders in the Veikkausliiga. In the end of the 1990s he formed the successful midfield trio with Aki Riihilahti and Jarkko Wiss with whom he won the league title in 1997 and worked their way to the group stage of UEFA Champions League in the next season. A sponsorship deal with a local radio station meant that Lehkuosuo wore the unusual shirt number 96.2 for a period at HJK Helsinki. This deal ended when he was forbidden to wear the number in UEFA Champions League matches. Lehkuosuo captained HJK in the group stage of the Champions League that season, helping HJK become the first ever Finnish team to earn that distinction. In the winter of 1998 Lehkosuo was signed on loan by Italian Serie A side Perugia. He only played eleven games in Italy and returned to HJK for the next Veikkausliiga season. In 1999 and 2000 Lehkosuo was made the captain of the HJK squad and he played in a more attacking role. However, in August 2000 Lehkosuo injured his knee ligament. The knee didn't fully recover and Lehkosuo was forced to end his playing career in 2002 after playing 190 matches in Veikkausliiga, of which he played 189 for HJK. International career Lehkosuo played 17 matches for the Finnish national team and scored one goal. Managerial career Lehkosuo started his managerial career with HJK youth teams quickly after retiring as a player. In 2005, he was appointed as assistant manager of Ville Lyytik√§inen of Ykk√∂nen (the second tier) side FC Honka. After Lyytik√§inen was sacked, Lehkosuo became head coach. He guided the team to the top place of Ykk√∂nen. In the first season in the Veikkausliiga Lehkosuo guided his team to the fourth place. In 2007 Honka was again fourth. In 2008 Lehkosuo guided Honka to second place and to the UEFA Cup qualifications for the next season. In 2009 Honka was again second in the league table. Lehkosuo managed FC Honka until February 2014. On 29 April 2014, Lehkosuo was appointed as the manager of HJK as Sixten Bostr√∂m was sacked. He led HJK into the Europa League group stages in 2014 with a 5‚Äì4 aggregate victory over SK Rapid Wien in the play-off round.

The ends of the drawstring may be tied to hold it in place (and/or simultaneously close an opening). Alternately, the drawstring may be kept drawn using a cordlock. Typically, the drawstring is loose when not being used, and tightened when needed during use. A drawstring may be threaded through a hem or casing (a continuous tube of material) or laced through holes, which may be lined with eyelets. It may also be laced through loops attached to the material, in the same way that belt loops are. A very wide, flat drawstring becomes a belt. Hazard In 1996 the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) issued guidelines for drawstrings on children's upper outerwear to help prevent children from strangling or getting entangled on the neck and waist drawstrings of upper outerwear garments, such as jackets and sweatshirts. Drawstrings on children‚Äôs clothing are a hidden hazard that can lead to deaths and injuries when they catch on such items as playground equipment, bus doors, or cribs.

At 1968 he started to write poems in the literary column of the newspaper Laiko Vima, which was the only printed media allowed to be published in Greek language, in communist Albania (1945‚Äì1991).

The film, which was shot in Technicolor, is based on the 1941 novel Swamp Water by Vereen Bell, and is a remake of the Jean Renoir's 1941 adaption of the novel featuring Walter Brennan in a smaller version of his leading role in the earlier film. Although some shots are added of wildlife, in documentary style, the film has a very optimistic view of the range of local species: black panthers; water buffalo; crocodile (instead of alligator) and river otter. Moreover, whilst perhaps seen as a \\"love of wildlife\\" film at the time the main heroes do kill most of the wildlife so it would not be politically correct to modern eyes. Plot The film is set in the 1910s in Fargo, Georgia, near a dangerous swamp. Ben Tyler and his father Zack one day go into the swamp to search for two lost trappers. During an unsuccessful journey, Ben's dog Careless disappears while running after a deer. While looking for Careless, Ben is hit in the head by someone, and when he awakens, he finds himself captured by two people living feral: old Jim Harper and his fierce, aggressive but beautiful daughter, Laurie. Ben recognizes Jim, who has been accused of a murder committed eight years ago. Fearing lynching, Jim and his daughter have since fled the nearby village to live in the wilderness. Jim admits to one killing, claiming it was done in self-defense, but insists that the other murder was committed by the vicious Longden brothers. Despite Laurie's clearly noticeable lack of trust in Ben, he believes the story of Jim and tells them he wants to return to the civilization to give them a fair trial. The following days, Ben accompanies Jim and Laurie in their routine days, which includes hunting. In this period, Laurie's hostility towards Ben softens and they start feeling attracted to each other. During a short return to home, Ben outrages his father and fianc√©e Noreen by announcing he will soon go back into the swamp. Noreen announces she does not plan on waiting for him and that she will look for another beau. At a later dance, Noreen provokes a fight between Ben and Jack Doran, her date, and Ben eventually breaks off the engagement. Noreen follows Ben to Laurie and finds out about her identity. She falsely claims to Laurie that Ben has betrayed the Harpers and she next tells the Longdens about Ben's interference with Jim and Laurie. As a revenge, the Longdens almost drown Ben and later try to find the Harpers to kill them, so the truth will not come out. Ben also goes into the swamp to warn Jim and Laurie, who initially do not believe his warnings until Ben becomes a target of the Longdens. After Jim is shot by one of them, Laurie sets a trap which kills one of the brothers and captures the other. In the end, the Harpers' name is cleared and they are finally able to return to the civilization, accompanied by Ben.

Early life He was the third son of Ali Qoli Khan, ‚ÄúMokhber-ol Douleh I‚Äù and grandson of Reza-Qoli Khan Hedayat (historian of the Qajar era and director of Iran's first polytechnic institute, the Dar-ol Fonun in Tehran). Mehdi Qoli Hedayat received a broad traditional education, including courses in western science. In 1878, he was sent to Berlin to visit a school. Although he soon left the school for private tutelage, his stay in Germany (from which he returned, fluent in German, in 1879) was a formative experience in his future perception of western influence on Iranian culture. Qajar era In 1885 Hedayat taught at the Dar-ol Fonun, and was made special chamberlain (pishkhedmat-e khass) by Naser al-Din Shah Qajar in 1893. After the death of his father in 1897 Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar bestowed the title Mokhber-os Saltaneh on Hedayat, and he accompanied the monarch as a German interpreter on his trip to Europe in 1901. After a year Hedayat returned to Iran and worked as a translator at the imperial court, influencing Mozaffar-ol Din Shah's granting of the constitution in 1906. Prior to that, being a member of the circle close to Mirza Ali Asghar Khan Amin al-Sultan, an influential aristocrat and several time prime minister of Iran, he joined the aforementioned on an around the globe tour in 1903, becoming one of the first Iranians in modern times to visit the Russian Far East, Imperial China, Meiji Japan, Hawaii, and the United States. The intention of the trip was to reach Mecca for performing \\"Hajj\\", albeit through an exotic route, and apparently the group derived sheer pleasure from sending postcards and telegrams to rival aristocrats in Tehran, from destinations previously unheard of. He meticulously recorded the events of this escapade in a travelogue which was later published in Tehran. On his return, after briefly serving as Governor General of Azerbaijan in 1908, he was appointed Governor of Azerbaijan from 1909 until his resignation in August 1911 due to Russian pressure on the central government in Tehran. As Governor General of Fars Province 1912, the central government had to cede to the British insistence to replace him and recalled Hedayat on 13 September 1915. As Minister of Justice, the Interior, Public Instruction, Finance and Public Works, Hedayat headed a number of ministries in several short-lived cabinets. RezƒÅ ShƒÅh era In 1926, Mostowfi became prime minister for the sixth time. Hedayat was appointed to the Ministry of Commerce and appointed public benefits and statesmanship; he was later elected president of the Supreme Court under Ali Akbar Davar, Minister of Justice. Hedayat served nearly six-and-a-half years as prime minister to RezƒÅ ShƒÅh Pahlavi; his premiership was conservative (laying a foundation for dictatorship), and he was dismissed in September 1933. Hedayat died on 21 September 1955 at the age of 92.

She was rebuilt in 1897 and remained active in the Menhaden fishery, operating out of Lewes, Delaware, until taken over by the Navy for World War I service. She served in the Delaware Bay area. In 1919 or early 1920, she was reported to be sunk at the Naval Air Station, Cape May, New Jersey, and was stricken from the Navy list in March 1920. After efforts to sell the wreck were unsuccessful, Albert Brown's remains were removed by Army Engineers. She was officially abandoned by the Navy in early 1923.

He is recorded in Greek as \\"stratelates of Scythia\\", hence probably a magister militum. In 528, Baduarius and Godilas led a military expedition from Odessus (modern Varna) against the Huns of Crimea.

He and Justin, Dux of Moesia Secunda, joined their forces in battle against a force of foreign invaders. Malalas reports \\"the Huns\\", whom Theophanes identifies as Bulgars, invading Scythia and Moesia. Either way, the battle went poorly for the Byzantines.

It comprises ten parishes and portion of two others viz Rathbeggan, Dunshaughlin, Kilbrew, Crickstown, Killegland, Cookstown, Donaghmore, Ratoath, and portions of Ballymaglasson and Trevit. Feudal History The Normans landed in Ireland in 1169 and captured the Danish city of Waterford. It is likely that the only cities or strongholds in the country at the time were those founded by the Danes, and of these the most important was Dublin, which was captured soon afterwards by Milo de Cogan and successfully held by him in spite of a long siege by Ruaidr√≠ Ua Conchobair, the High King of Ireland, who had the co-operation of the Danes. Henry II of England arrived in Dublin in 1172 and many of the Gaelic Chieftains made their submission to him, i.e., they recognised him as their feudal lord, who gave them the right or title to the lands they held. In other words, Henry applied to Ireland the Norman or feudal system of land tenure which prevailed on the continent and which the Normans introduced into England. This meant displacing some of the native kings ‚Äì one of whom was the king of Meath or Tara. Henry granted Hugh de Lacy \\"the land of Meath in as full a measure as Murchadh √ì Maoilsheachlainn or anyone before or after him held it.\\" The technical name of this grant was a Liberty and it meant that, within his Liberty, de Lacy‚Äôs power of jurisdiction was equal to that of the king himself with one reservation, that the king could dispose of Church lands anywhere. The person enjoying such liberal delegation of royal jurisdiction was known as a Count and the territory over which he ruled was called a county. One of the privileges of a Count Palatinate, such as de Lacy in this case, was that he could create barons or inferior lords who held their land from the Count. Some time after 1196, the son of Hugh de Lacy, named Walter, granted \\"the whole land of Rathtowth\\" to his younger brother, Hugh. Hence we have now the sub- division of the county Meath named the Barony of Ratoath and it has the distinction of being perhaps the first instance that the term, barony, was used in Ireland for a division of a county. It is likely that it was this second Hugh de Lacy who erected that large moat that stands out so prominently adjacent to the Catholic Church in the village. (The Rath that gives its name to the village). The site was well chosen. The summit commands a view of most of the barony. It had all the other characteristics of the typical Norman fort ‚Äì a keep, bailium, fosse, etc. The Normans had to defend themselves in a new country that was thinly populated and almost without roads. They set up their own courts to administer justice and keep the peace. As in England, the native population in the area made no resistance. It was not so along the borders where the native kings raided the Norman territory just as they raided and were raided by their neighbours. Before long Ratoath was well inside the Norman territory and it was not necessary for them to build a stone castle for defence such as they erected at Duleek, Slane, Dunshaughlin, etc. It may have been this Hugh de Lacy too, that erected the first Church in Ratoath as the site in the old cemetery was just then right by Norman practice. On the other hand, the fact that its patron is the Most Holy Trinity suggests either as earlier foundation, as the Normans usually dedicated their churches to Our Blessed Lady or to one of the saints, or that they borrowed the title from an existing church in the neighbourhood. As the head or chief centre of a barony, Ratoath village enjoyed a certain prestige. The village was chartered for the holding of fairs and markets at an early period and it had its \\"portreeve\\" (local magistrate) and all the usual officials. The courts were held here also and had its Manor House where manorial courts were held up until 1830. This is now the Nursing Home.

The piazza takes its name from the Cors Ducis (Ducal court) which was found in the square during Longobard times. It is well known for its several turn-of-the-19th-century Neoclassical, eclectic and Art Nouveau buildings, banks and post offices. Even though many of these have now relocated elsewhere, it is still an important commercial square in the city and hosts the Palazzo delle Assicurazioni Generali (Palace of the Assicurazioni Generali), the Palazzo del Credito Italiano (Palace of the Credito Italiano) and the Palazzo delle Poste (Palace of the Post Office), former Borsa di Milano (former Milan Stock Exchange). Piazzale Cordusio hosts the Cordusio metro station and is the starting point of the elegant pedestrian Via Dante which leads to the imposing medieval Castello Sforzesco, or Milan Castle.

They are powered by small 4-cycle engines (200 cc), generally starting out as 5 hp Briggs & Stratton engines originally referred to as \\"lawnmower\\" engines, since that is where the first engines were taken from. After being modified for racing, the engines can produce anywhere from 7 to 30+ hp, depending on the racing class. Microstocks were originally designed to hit speeds between 45-65 mph; however, modified racing has pushed them over 100 mph in some cases. They generally race on asphalt oval tracks, but have also raced on street courses and dirt tracks as well. They are a rigid chassis design using no suspension. Microstock is considered one of the most inexpensive forms of kart racing. History The first microstockkarts were built by Bob and Bill Wagner in the late 1970s, and were raced around a small dirt track in their backyard. Design Microstocks are small, single seat karts designed for oval track racing. They were originally separated into two classes: Sportsman and Modifieds. Both classes shared the majority of physical kart design, with distinctions primarily in engine modification. Sportsman The Sportsman class, the larger of the two classes, was an engine class that used very few and minor modifications to the stock 5 hp engine. This generally consisted of replacing the stock air intake and filter with a more race-ready one, as well as replacing the stock muffler system with a straight pipe exhaust. During the 1980s, Sportsman engines were producing around 7-8 hp. The Sportsman class was considered the most inexpensive class to join, which attracted the most interest to new members. Modifieds The Modified class allowed much more work to be done to the engines, including changing piston bore and stroke, valve timing, etc. During the 1980s, a modified engine might have been able to produce 17-18 hp. The Golden Years (1981 - 1989) The \\"golden years\\" of microstock racing were through the 1980s, when they raced at their home track of Pine Brook Speedway in Pine Brook, NJ. The location of the track in north-central NJ was optimum to attract drivers from all over NJ, PA, and NY. It was not uncommon for car counts to reach over 60 microstocks at the peak of their popularity (in contrast, a typical NASCAR race has around 40 cars). AMSRA During the 1980s, all official microstock racing was governed by the American MicroStock Racing Association. Cars had to adhere to AMSRA rules in order to participate in AMSRA sanctioned races. During the early 1980s, kart racing was nearly unheard of in other parts of the country. It is possible that AMSRA was one of the first few kart sanctioning bodies in the United States along with the WKA. After the loss of their home track of Pine Brook Speedway (see below), microstock racing began a slow but steady decline. After a few years, AMSRA did not have enough membership to maintain control of the sport, and the club began to fraction into smaller subsets of racing (Modified Outlaw Microstocks, World Formula, etc.). AMSRA has been considered defunct since the late 1990s. Microstock Racing League The MRL was formed as a replacement to AMSRA. Tracks Microstocks are generally built to race counter-clockwise on asphalt or paved oval tracks, however they can use modified tires and chassis adjustments to race \\"drift style\\" on dirt or clay surfaces. Wagner Raceway Built in the backyard of Bob and Bill Wagner's house, Micro Stocks were born and raised on this 1/12 mile dirt track. It is unknown if the track is still there because their address is unknown. Pine Brook Speedway Pine Brook Speedway was a small 1/10 paved oval track located on US Route 46 in Pine Brook, Morris County, New Jersey. Built in 1962 for TQ Midget racing, the track saw nearly three decades of racing before being closed by the property owner at the end of the 1989 racing season (October). A Home Depot now sits on the site. Microstock Racing Today With the fractioning of the larger microstock collective, several smaller subsets have emerged. The most popular ones are the Modified Outlaw Microstocks (MOM), which is primarily made up of cars from the previous Modified class; the World Formula class, which uses a sealed Briggs & Stratton World Formula kart engine; and the Microstock Racing Series (MSRS), it is the sportsman class of the Microstocks using the sealed Briggs & Stratton Local Option 206; The Microstocks still run in New York, New Jersey, and in Pennsylvania.

Location St Mary's Parish Church is at the junction of two major roads A308 and A311, leading to Twickenham, Kingston upon Thames and Sunbury-on-Thames. Standing tall on Bell Hill it marks the ancient heart of Hampton. During the mid-19th century houses were built to the north of the existing village; this area became known as New Hampton, and later as Hampton Hill. The Parish of St James, Hampton Hill was created in 1863. In 1929 the Hampton parish was further divided by the creation of a separate parish of All Saints. History The site upon which this church is built is said to be that of a Romano-British chapel. Certainly a house of worship has stood here for at least 650 years, as historical records begin in 1342, when the site came into possession of the Priory of Takeley in Essex. It is described in the annals of the Priory as a Rectory of that monastery. Before that time it is possible that a simple wooden structure existed, or services may have been held under the ancient yew tree that stood in the churchyard until 1829. The old church The first church for which there are historical records was built of flint and stone. The interior of the building had galleries round the north, west and south sides, with a singing loft for choir and instrumental accompaniment. There was a three-decker pulpit: the first level for the clerk, the second for the reading of lessons, and the uppermost for the delivery of sermons. The royal pew was situated at the front of the north gallery. The old church also housed a school room and provided a master for Hampton School, from 1557. The original church, demolished in 1830 At the time of Henry VIII a new nave, south aisle and porch were rebuilt with brick (‚Äúhaving got out of repair and become unsafe‚Äù) ‚Äì the original flint and stone chancel and tower were retained. In 1671 the tower also became unsafe and a new brick tower was erected. Charles II contributed ¬£350. In 1726, the north aisle and the vault beneath it were added to the church, as was the vestry room at the north-west corner of the church; George I gave ¬£500 towards the extension. This version of the building was described as Hampton's \\"brick church in pre-eminence, with fresh-painted and accommodating covered benches in the churchyard\\". The church was well-attended (one service on Sunday morning, and one in the evening); twelve or more carriages waited outside the church . A notable worshipper was George FitzClarence, 1st Earl of Munster. The present building As the population grew the Vestry decided that the old building needed to be enlarged. There was an initial plan simply to extend in 1821. The Crown promised a contribution if seats were to be provided for those who lived at Hampton Court Palace. However insufficient money was raised from other sources and the project was deferred. In fact for the next eight years there were various schemes and competitions to design a new building. Eventually the old building closed on 27 December 1829, and the congregation moved to the Great Hall of Hampton Court Palace as the church was demolished. The Duke of Clarence (later William IV) laid the new foundation stone on 18 April 1830 and the new building was consecrated on 1 September 1831. Princess Adelaide, Prince George and his sister Princess Augusta attended and the roads were blocked with carriages a quarter of a mile away such was the significance of the occasion.(There had been an announcement that the Duke was to attend ‚Äì he was to be crowned one week later ‚Äì but he did present the organ to the parish.) By 1879 the churchyard had become full and, from then on, burials took place at the new Hampton Cemetery which was opened that year on Holly Bush Lane. Also in 1879, the organ, originally in the centre of the west gallery, was moved to its present position in the north-west corner of the church when a surpliced choir was begun. It was later reconstructed in 1901. The interior in 1860 The incumbency of Prebendary Digby Ram (1882‚Äì1911) saw a resurgence of church life and further development of the building. In 1885 the box pews were removed and replaced with the current ones, and the nave was refurbished. As a sign of the new life coming to the parish, when the building was re-opened by Bishop Walsham How, there immediately followed the first Confirmation service since the building was opened in 1831. To mark Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee (1887) the chancel was built together with the impressive Heaton, Butler and Bayne east window ‚Äì inspired by the Te Deum. The window on the north side of the chancel is the 'Magnificat' window and that on the south side is the ‚ÄòNunc Dimittis‚Äô window. The stained-glass windows on the north and south walls are by Eric Fraser. These depict the Annunciation on the north wall and the four Archangels (Michael, Raphael, Gabriel and Uriel) on the south wall. In 1920 the church was re-ordered and restored again; a war memorial screen was added as a memorial to the fallen of the First World War. Then in 1931 new choir and clergy stalls were added, in keeping with the screen. A striking feature of the west wall is the mural by Eric Fraser‚Äôs son, Rev Geoffrey Fraser, painted in 1952-3. The left-hand panel depicts figures from local history, the right-hand panel members of the church of the time (1952‚Äì53). Above the River Thames rises the figure of Christ. In the graveyard is an unusual pyramidal tomb for John Greg (1716‚Äì1795), plantation owner in Dominica, and his wife Catharine who died at Hampton in 1819 \\"full of years and of benevolence\\". In the next decade attention turned to the north aisle. A small chapel was created, with an altar table, reredos, altar rails and with stainless steel fittings. The new chapel was consecrated in 1967. St Luke's Chapel in the west porch was dedicated in 1990. The doors are etched with two figures, the Virgin Mary and the Archangel Gabriel, taken from drawings by Eric Fraser and presented by his family in his memory. In the late 1990s a small kitchen and toilet have been added in the north porch. Inside the church a small stage area was created in front of the screen. Floodlighting was installed at the Millennium. In 2005, after an appeal, the exterior stonework was extensively restored and cleaned. In 2013 the toilet area was redeveloped to include two cubicles. At the same time the side chapel was moved to the south aisle, and a flexible space with some chairs was created in the north aisle. Church life The church continues to have an active congregation and is a member of Churches Together around Hampton. In 2013, St Mary's opened a primary school in Oldfield Road as part of the Free School programme. In literature The church is briefly mentioned in Jerome K Jerome's 1889 comic novel, Three Men in a Boat. While the church does contain a memorial to Susanna Thomas (d.1731) on the east wall of the south aisle, Paul Goldsac, in his book River Thames: In the Footsteps of the Famous, states there is little that is funny, or even remarkable about it. However, the tomb is floridly classical, with partly draped female figures which may have surprised some Victorians and amused others, including J K Jerome himself. Hence the tomb is \\"funny\\" in both senses, of being unusual as well as entertaining. ReferencesSources *Ripley, Henry. History and Topography of Hampton on Thames (1884) *Heath, G. D.

He began his career in aviation in the First World War with the Royal Flying Corps after transferring from the Black Watch. He rose through a series of command positions in the RAF to become a consequential participant in the Second World War. Early life George Ranald MacFarlane Reid was born in Ardeer, Scotland on 25 October 1893. First World War Reid began his military career in the Officer Training Corps prior to the First World War. He was commissioned a temporary second lieutenant in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders on 15 August 1914, in the early days of the war. However, it was with the Black Watch that he went into action; in January 1915, he was wounded at the Battle of Festubert while with the Watch. The wound could not have been serious, as Reid began pilot's training that same month. The following month, on 16 February, he was confirmed as a Second Lieutenant. He earned Aviators' Certificate No. 1900, awarded on 16 October 1915. Upon completion of training, he was assigned to No. 25 Squadron RFC; his appointment as a flying officer dated from 15 November 1915. Reid destroyed enemy aircraft on 16, 19, and 21 May 1916, using a Royal Aircraft Factory FE.2b with Lieutenant James Anderson Mann as his pilot. Reid won a Military Cross (MC) on 24 June 1916 as a result of these victories. On 19 June, Reid had been transferred to No. 20 Squadron RFC as a Flight Commander with the accompanying rank of acting captain. With 20 Squadron, Reid used a slightly newer FE.2d with Lieutenant Laurence H. Scott as his gunner; the pair scored six more wins between 29 July and 21 October 1916. Reid's final tally was seven German planes destroyed, two driven down out of control. A Bar in lieu of a second MC followed, on 25 November 1916. On 10 February 1917, Reid was promoted to temporary major, a squadron command rank in wartime. On 30 March 1917, he was promoted to command of No. 18 Squadron RFC on the Western Front. On 25 July 1918, he was transferred to command of No. 211 Squadron RAF. Interbellum On 23 May 1919, Reid took command of No. 206 Squadron RAF. Over the next year and a half, the squadron would move from the Western Front to Germany and on to Egypt, renumbering as No. 47 Squadron RAF along the way. He received the rank of squadron leader to match his position, on 1 August 1919. When this assignment ended on 30 December 1920, he moved on to three years of staff duty. On 23 April 1924, he took command of No. 99 Squadron RAF. On 1 July 1925, he was again promoted, to wing commander. In the wake of this promotion, on 15 September 1925, he was transferred to command of RAF Spitalgate. This ended on 8 September 1927, when he was posted to Khartoum as Senior RAF Officer. He returned home from this posting on 20 January 1930. Over the next three years, he would attend both the RAF Staff College and the Imperial Defence College, with a staff assignment wedged between. On 1 July 1932, he was promoted to group captain. On 25 March 1933, he began duty as Air Attach√© to the United States, in Washington, D.C.. In 1934, was engaged to his future wife, Miss Leslie Livermore Wright, granddaughter of former United States Senator William D. Washburn of Minnesota. Upon his return to England, on 3 October 1935, he took command of RAF Upper Heyford. He was raised to air commodore on 1 July 1936. Second World War After a spell as Commandant of a technical school, Reid was chosen as Air Officer Commanding British Forces Aden. On 1 April 1939, he reached air vice marshal. While in this post, he had to project air operations 200 miles out to support British defense efforts in Somaliland; lack of usable airfields kept him from stationing airplanes closer to the effort. Nevertheless, Reid's conduct of these air operations garnered him a Mention in Despatches in both the 12 September 1941 report of General Sir Archibald Wavell to the Secretary of State for War, and of Wavell's followup to it on 21 May 1942. Reid's return to England saw him posted as Air Officer Administration at Headquarters Flying Training Command on 18 July 1941. From there, he moved to becoming Air Officer Commanding No. 54 Group on 21 June 1943. On 14 December 1944, he became Air Officer Commanding West Africa. Post-war Reid retired on 20 January 1946, having faithfully served his country for 32 years and through two world wars. On 1 January 1952, he was honoured with the appointment of Gentleman Usher to King George VI. He continued in that post for Queen Elizabeth II; she renewed his appointment 1 August 1952. On 10 November 1959, Reid resigned as Gentleman Usher, but was concurrently appointed an Extra Gentleman Usher.

Allen Mansion is an historic property on the Green in Fair Haven, Vermont, United States. It is a contributing property to the Fair Haven Green Historic District. History In 1866 the Hon. Ira C. Allen, a former Rutland County state senator, state representative, and prominent Fair Haven businessman, purchased the property on the west side of the town Green. Allen, who had interests in real estate, banking, the railroad, marble, and slate, was a distant relative of American Revolutionary War patriot and Vermont Founding Father Ethan Allen. Allen was married to Mary E. Richardson, the niece of one of his business partners. By 1867 Allen finished construction on the twenty-two room, French Second Empire/Italianate mansion. On January 1, 1868 Allen and his family moved into the home. The home was the first in Fair Haven to have electricity. After he died, Allen left the mansion to his four children: Charles R., Ira R., Jessie A., and Francis. Charles R. Allen and his wife Jessie Dailey Allen lived on the property before he and his brothers sold their shares in 1889 to their sister, Jessie, for $15,000.00. In 1903 the home moved from Jessie A. Allen to George Vail, whose wife Elizabeth was a distant relative of the Allen family. The Vails then in turn sold the property to Aaron Vail Allen, Sr. and his wife Rebecca. The last Allen to live in the mansion Sherman Vail Allen, who died in 1975. Architecture The Ira C. Allen Mansion is an example of the French Second Empire and Italianate architectural style. The exterior is made from numbered white marble blocks. An Italianate porch and porte cochere encircles the main house. The wood trim is painted white. The mansion has a mansard roof and a belvedere.

Today it is a rest stop on the Washington State Route 401 highway just east of the Astoria‚ÄìMegler Bridge and is affiliated with Lewis and Clark National Historical Park. History In 1805, the Lewis and Clark Expedition Corps of Discovery were low on supplies and traveling rapidly down the Columbia River, intending to meet one of the last trading ships of the season, hoping to secure needed supplies and to send back journals and specimens home as requested by President Thomas Jefferson. On November 10, 1805, a severe winter storm struck the area, forcing them off the river for six days and preventing them from meeting the supply ships. The group landed in a cove on the north bank of the river that Captain William Clark called in his journals \\"that dismal little nitch\\". After the storm passed the company moved to Station Camp on the west side of Point Ellice (referred to by Clark as \\"blustering point\\", \\"Stormey point\\", and \\"Point Distress.\\"\\"Blustering Point\\"), and camped at that location for 10 days before relocating for the winter to what would become Fort Clatsop. In the 1870s and 1880s, Joseph G. Megler operated a fish buying station on the east side of Point Ellice in Clark's \\"Dismal Nitch\\", and it in time became known as Megler Cove. In 1921, increased tourism to the nearby Long Beach Peninsula led to creation of a car ferry between Astoria and the Megler dock. In 1946, the Oregon Highway Department purchased the ferry service and operated it until the Astoria‚ÄìMegler bridge was completed. In 1956, Washington State Route 401 was constructed east of Megler, and construction of the Astoria‚ÄìMegler Bridge began in 1962 and was completed in 1966. The last ferry run occurred in July of that year. In 1968 and 1969, the Washington Department of Highways demolished the ferry landing and constructed the Megler Rest Area in its place. The Megler Rest Area was renamed the Dismal Nitch Rest Area in 2005.

After an apprenticeship as a window dresser Bahnsen studied at the College of Fine Arts in Hamburg. From 1958 to 1986 he held various positions with Ford Europe, most recently as vice president for design. During this time his designs included the Taunus 17m and the Capri II. Bahnsen was also a motor sport enthusiast, and in the 1960s he organised a Ford Works Team. He was a team member involved with the design of the Mk1 Capri, working with chief stylist Phil Clark. Ford Sierra MK I Ford Capri MkII Ford Taunus P3 17M By the mid 1970s, Bahnsen had risen to become the Vice President of design for Ford of Europe, and moved the company away from the \\"coke bottle\\" design language of the late 1960s, towards the fashionable \\"origami\\" or \\"folded paper\\" school of design, typified in his square and angular designs for the Escort Mk II (1975), Mk IV Cortina/Taunus (1976), Granada Mk II (1978) and the Escort Mk III (1980). By the early 1980s, he had moved Ford's styling language forward again to the rounded \\"aero\\" look - most famously the Ford Sierra in 1982 and the Scorpio/Granada iii in 1985 - Bahnsen's final design for Ford. In 1986 Bahnsen left Ford to become training director at the Art Center College of Design in La Tour-de-Peilz (Switzerland), which he ran between 1990 and 1995.

The Icelandic Glacial brand is owned and operated by Icelandic Water Holdings hf. based in Hlidarendi, √ñlfus, Iceland. Icelandic Water Holdings controls the sole commercial rights to bottle and sell water from the √ñlfus Spring. The capacity of the Spring is recognized as one of the largest in the world. Icelandic Water Holdings was established in April 2004 by a group of private investors led by former media entrepreneur Jon Olafsson. The company has been exporting Icelandic Glacial to consumers since 2005. In the United States, it is distributed by Anheuser- Busch Inbev, which took a 20% ownership stake in the company in July 2007.Tessa Thorniley, \\"Jon Olafsson: He's 'a street boy, a maverick'.

Since then, Icelandic Glacial distribution has expanded to other territories including Australia, the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, France, Russia, Canada, Peru, Singapore, South Korea, and China. Environmental record In 2007, Icelandic Glacial received a Carbon Neutral certification for both product and operations from The Carbon Neutral Company. With the program developed with The Carbon Neutral Company Icelandic Glacial conducts an ongoing assessment of CO2 emissions and reduces emissions wherever possible. Any unavoidable remaining CO2 emissions are then offset by investing in accredited and bonafide projects around the world to reduce carbon emissions to a net-zero level. Icelandic Glacial offset project investments have included renewable energy projects in Europe, China and India. Icelandic Glacial uses natural renewable energy in the form of geothermal power to fuel production.

Located on 12 acres, the Center provides a variety of services that benefit the community through educational and therapeutic programs for people, and humane care and adoption for animals.  Mission Statement  Helen Woodward Animal Center‚Äôs passionate belief that animals help people and people help animals through trust, unconditional love, and respect creates a legacy of caring. Sharing this philosophy with others, the Center inspires and teaches, locally and globally, the importance of the animal-human bond.  History  The Center was established in 1972 as the San Dieguito Animal Care and Education Center with its primary focus on pet adoption and on-site humane education. It was renamed in honor of its founder, Helen Woodward, in 1986. Since its inception, services have grown to include an equine hospital, small animal hospital, boarding facility, animal-assisted therapy outreach, therapeutic horseback riding for the disabled and AniMeals food for pets of the homebound. Education services have expanded to off-site presentations and outreaches. The Center also provides three-day workshops and conferences through The Business of Saving Lives International Conference. The conference provides tips and techniques on managing pet adoptions, public relations, fundraising, humane education, accounting, marketing, human resources and volunteers. Participants have attended from 33 states and 17 locations outside the United States including Argentina, Canada, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Ireland, Iran, Japan, Kenya, Mexico and Romania. Michael (‚ÄòMike‚Äô) Arms has been CEO and President of Helen Woodward Animal Center since 1999. In October 2007, the Center had to evacuate over 400 animals from their property in the Witch Creek Fire. In 2013, Mike Arms created an international awareness campaign to remember all animals who never found new homes after landing in shelters. The campaign was called Remember Me Thursday and occurs annually on the fourth Thursday of September. In May 2014, the center had to evacuate animals from their center during the Bernardo Fire. In 2017, the center created the Pets Without Walls program to help the pets of homeless community members. That same year the President and CEO, Mike Arms, was the subject of controversy for taking home a salary of $354,492, compared to the median salary of CEOs of similar sized charities of $148,659. The organization also provided Mike Arms with a home loan amounting to $400,000, as well as paying his membership dues at the University Club in Symphony Towers. In January 2018, the center began construction on a new adoptions building. The new adoptions building opened to the public on July 17, 2019. Helen Woodward Animal Center holds an annual fundraising event for surfing dogs and surfing people called the Surf Dog Surf-A-Thon at Dog Beach, in Del Mar, California. This event helps raise awareness and money for animals while promoting responsible pet ownership. The Center also publishes a quarterly newsletter called \\"The Companion.\\" In 2020, Helen Woodward Animal Center introduced a program called AniMeals Relief to offer a two week supply of dog and/or cat food for individuals that have been laid off due to the COVID-19 outbreak. As of June 2020, the program provided more than 42,000 lbs of food to more than 3,000 families in need within San Diego County. Some celebrities that support the Center are: Kristen Bell, Tippi Hedren, Ryan Newman and his wife, Krissie.  Remember Me Thursday  Remember Me Thursday¬Æ, honored every fourth Thursday in September, aims to unite individuals and pet adoption organizations around the world to be an unstoppable, integrated voice for orphan pets in need of forever homes. In the previous six years of the campaign, over 190 countries supported the movement with hundreds of thousands of individuals and more than 700 separate animal welfare organizations around the globe holding candle-lighting ceremonies of their own, spreading the message on social media, visiting the Remember Me Thursday website, or lighting a virtual candle. Mike Arms, on why he created Remember Me Thursday, ‚ÄúMy heart breaks for those beautiful people working in animal welfare who are forced to take the lives of the pets they love. I believe lighting a candle for the orphan pets will be a way for people to let the world know how much they love them, and the awareness can help in increasing adoptions and decreasing euthanasia.‚Äù  Blue Buffalo Home 4 The Holidays  In 1999, Helen Woodward Animal Center created the Home 4 the Holidays pet adoption campaign including 14 animal shelters in San Diego County, California. The goal of the drive was to reduce euthanasia by encouraging families to adopt a pet rather than purchase a pet from a puppy mill or backyard breeder. During the first campaign, the participating shelters adopted 2,563 orphaned pets. In 2000, the campaign expanded to 5 states, and then expanded both nationally and internationally over the next 13 years. Some Home 4 the Holidays spokespersons include Hilary Swank, Diane Keaton and the canine movie star, Benji. In 2009, the Home 4 the Holidays campaign included participants from more than 3,900 animal organizations in 17 countries, and was featured on the television series The Doctors on October 23, 2009. In 2013, The Blue Buffalo pet food company became the Home 4 the Holidays pet food sponsor.

Meaning Nishprapanchaya (‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§™‡§û‡•ç‡§ö‡§æ‡§Ø ni·π£prapa√±cƒÅya )is variously translated as \\"He is beyond world- consciousness\\", \\"He is transcendent\\", and \\"Who is above this world\\". Grammatically, ni·π£prapa√±cƒÅya is the dative of a Sanskrit noun, ni·π£prapa√±ca, where ni·π£prapa√±ca is \\"unmanifest\\": ni·π£- means the negative/\\"without\\", and pra- pa√±ca means \\"manifest, of the world\\" and -ya is the dative suffix meaning \\"to\\" or \\"for\\". Nishprapanchaya occurs in some popular mantras, as following Om Namah Shivaya (plus a string of datives giving qualities of Shiva), thus: :Om Namah Shivaya Gurave (o·πÉ nama·∏• ≈õivƒÅya gurave) (Om. Salutations to the guru, who is Shiva.) :Satchidananda Murtaye, (satccidƒÅnanda m≈´rtaye) (His form is being, consciousness, and bliss.) :Nishprapanchaya Shantaya (ni·π£prapa√±cƒÅya ≈õantƒÅya) (He is transcendent, calm,) :Niralambaya Tejase. (nirƒÅlambƒÅya tejase) (free from all support, and luminous.) Expounded in more detail, Muktananda glosses the second half of the verse as describing an \\"aspect of God, the inner Self\\", and meaning \\"Dwelling in everything as its inmost essence, the basis of love, supremely blissful, free from occupations and agitations (nishprapanchaya shantaya), he needs no other support (niralambaya) and yet he sustains and supports all.\\". Usage and context Nishprapanchaya occurs in some forms of the Guru Stotram. A form of the Sri Guru Stotram is sung daily in the Shivananda Ashram, Rishikesh, India.

All different in approach, all equal in how they communicate in the most recent generations fundamental references of Portuguese culture. Rua da Saudade part of an idea of Ary dos Santos to join four female voices - Viviane, Susana F√©lix, Mafalda Arnauth and Luanda Cozzeti - to honor Ary dos Santos, in the year they are 25 springs on his death. If the idea is generous, the end result is debatable. Of the four singers, but no compromises are Susana Felix and Mafalda Arnauth, this bright outside the scope of fate, clearly at home in time to swim out standing, who shines most. The arrangements often distance themselves from the original but rarely go beyond the average (which is different from the median): sober, it is a fact, but without wing coup. If Ary dos Santos was a man ahead of his time, why a disk so conservative? Not that the poet's words are lost in space and time but the (re)discovery of a personality as bold deserved a little more daring. Wordpress also gave a positive review.

Immediate Disaster and The Venusian in the United States) is a 1954 independently made British black-and-white science fiction film, produced by Burt Balaban (who also directed), Gene Martel, and Roy Rich, that stars Patricia Neal, Helmut Dantine and Derek Bond. It is a low-budget remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), which also starred Patricia Neal. Plot A flying saucer is seen in the sky above the British countryside by various eyewitnesses, including an American woman driving in her car. She crashes after being blinded by the craft's landing lights and deafened by its loud propulsion system. A stranger walks up to the car and sees that she is injured. The stranger (Helmut Dantine) later enters a country inn very near where the sighting and accident took place. He is able to read people's thoughts, and when asked says he has no name. He also asserts that he is responsible for saving the life of Susan North (Patricia Neal), the car accident victim. She later walks into the inn a little dazed, but with her crash wounds nearly healed. After the mysterious stranger explains that he comes from the planet Venus, a guest at the inn, Arthur Walker (Derek Bond), a high-ranking government official (and Susan's fianc√©), calls the war ministry. With permission, Dr Meinard (Cyril Luckham) examines the stranger from Venus and says that he has no detectable pulse. The area surrounding the inn is quickly cordoned-off by the government. Journalist Charles Dixon (Kenneth Edwards) tries to learn more about the man from Venus. Dixon discovers that the stranger is able to speak multiple human languages, and that his people have learned quite a bit about humanity by listening to our radio broadcasts and viewing our television transmissions. He also explains how Venusians use 'magnetic brilliance' for their spaceship propulsion, supplied by the magnetic energy fields of the other planets as they revolve in their various orbits. When governmental officials arrive at the inn, the man from Venus outlines his purpose for coming to Earth: to prepare the way for the arrival of his superiors, who have a dire warning for humanity's leaders. Humans are developing dangerous technologies without measuring their long term destructive consequences, such as nuclear explosions, creating very dangerous magnetic field effects that threaten Venus and the other planets in the solar system. Should fifty hydrogen bombs be exploded in the same general location during a future atomic war, they could alter the Earth's orbit, thereby affecting its gravitational field. This disruption would then affect the orbits and gravitational fields of all the other planets in the solar system. The stranger makes a promise that if Earth eliminates these dangers, Venus will share some of its higher scientific knowledge with our scientists. During the meeting, however, the man from Venus concludes that humanity is not yet ready to receive such advanced knowledge. After his communication disc is stolen, which allows him to contact the approaching Venusian ship, the stranger quickly realizes that an interplanetary meeting of minds can never take place. He also learns that such a meeting will be turned into a trap by the British government, to seize the Venusian ship for its advanced space technology. Should the government carry out this warlike action, the stranger assures Walker that an immediate retaliation from an orbiting Venusian mothership would terminate all life in Britain. Walker tries to warn the war ministry, without success, but he returns the stolen communication disc, and the stranger is able to warn away the approaching scout ship. An interplanetary conflict is avoided, but discussion with Earth's leaders has been derailed by the British government's short-sighted play for Venusian technology. The future now uncertain, and his peaceful mission a failure, the stranger from Venus says farewell to Susan North, the woman that he saved, and vanishes without a trace. CastUS theatrical and television releases The film was released theatrically in the UK and in other countries under the title Stranger from Venus and Immediate Disaster. In the U.S. it was only released to television by Flamingo Telefilm out of New York City under the title Immediate Disaster. This was because of the possibility of legal action from 20th Century Fox. This was due to it being similar in plot to the earlier Patricia Neal film The Day the Earth Stood Still, which in 1954 was still in theatrical re-release. The rights were sold to Wade Williams Distribution, and the film was made available theatrically under the title Stranger from Venus. It has been licensed for home use for several decades, both on VHS and DVD. Home media Stranger from Venus was released on VHS by Englewood Entertainment. On September 5, 2000, Image Entertainment released the film on Region 1 DVD. References=Bibliography * Warren, Bill.

Military- Nutrition.com from the founding of the country to the present day. Through the research and guidance of medical and military professionals, rations and packaging have been consistently and dramatically improved. General history The first formal institution for US military nutrition research was created in 1917, when the Surgeon-General's office established a Food Division for ‚Äúsafeguarding the nutritional interests of the Army.\\"Murlin, J.R., Miller, C.W. \\"Preliminary Results of Nutritional Surveys in United States Army Camps\\". American Journal of Public Health. 9(6). Currently, the US army's nutrition research is presided over by the DoD Combat Feeding and Research Program (CFREP), providing a research, technology and engineering base for all combat feeding systems. The Army is the executive agent for the Combat Research and Engineering Board (CFREB; formerly known as the Food and Nutrition Research and Engineering Board).Department of Defense Directive 3235.2. May 21, 2004 Chaired by the office of the director, defense research and engineering, the CFREB includes representatives from Army Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and the Defense Logistics Agency. The Military Nutrition Division at the US Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM) has been at the forefront of Military Nutrition Research since 1986, and addresses physical, physiological and nutritional requirements of modern military personnel. Eras= 1775‚Äì1917  In 1775, the Continental Congress stipulated that all enlisted persons of the Continental Army should receive peas, beans, or vegetables and one pint of milk per man in addition to their provision of meat and bread.Journals of the Continental Congress, November 4, 1775 For the time, this was a significant recognition of the need to include fresh food in the military diet. As food preservation and refrigeration techniques had not been perfected at the time (late 18th century), perishables were rarely delivered in edible condition to soldiers in the field. Without fresh fruits and vegetables, many soldiers suffered death or illness by such diseases as scurvy. As a result, the overall health and morale of American soldiers suffered.Rush, Benjamin (1777). \\"Directions for preserving the health of soldiers\\" The Pennsylvania Packet, no. 284.Gillett, Mary C. (1981), \\"The Army Medical Department, 1775‚Äì1818\\", Washington, DC: Center of Military History, United States Army. Aware of the situation, General George Washington wrote a letter to Congress suggesting new personnel be hired to correct issues in the Commissary Department.George Washington to Continental Congress Conference Committee, January 29, 1778 Congress then directed the Board of War to supply sauerkraut, vegetables, vinegar, beer and cider to troops.Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774‚Äì1789. Friday, March 13, 1778. p. 248‚Äì252. A few decades later, in response to a 12000 franc award offered by Napoleon Bonaparte for the creation of a method to preserve food for armies on the move, Nicholas Appert developed a method to preserve food in airtight bottles. Samples of Appert's preserved foods were sent to sea with Napoleon's men and the food remained fresh for several months. Ten years later, Pierre Durand, a British merchant, patented a similar method using tin-coated canisters, and by 1813, the British Army and Navy were supplied with food preserved in tins. During the American Civil War, conditions prevented adequate supply and delivery of all ration components to troops.\\"Food and Rations.\\" Gale Library of Daily Life: American Civil War. Ed. Steven E. Woodworth. Vol. 1. Detroit: Gale, 2008. p15‚Äì18. Typhoid, diarrhea, and dysentery, easily spread by contamination of water and food supplies, were widespread, and fatalities caused by these diseases were common.CivilWarHome.com. \\"Medical Care, Battle Wounds, and Disease.\\" In 1861, the Army of Virginia published \\"Directions for Cooking by Troops in Camp and Hospital,\\"Nightengale, F. Directions for Cooking by Troops in Camp and Hospital. J.W. Randolph. Richmond, VA. 1861 an Army camp cooking manual, the content of which was written by Florence Nightingale. The recipes emphasized meat and milk (for protein) and whole grains, fruits and vegetables (for carbohydrates). The first \\"US Family Food Guide (1916)\\" was published 35 years later, with essentially similar recommendations. In 1861, John Ordronaux's \\"Hints on the Preservation of Health in the Armies\\"Ordronaux, J. Hints on Health in Armies for the Use of Volunteer Officers. 2nd Ed. D. Van Nostrand, New York, NY. 1863. was published containing the first known dietary guidelines for soldiers, identifying priorities of an effective military diet. After the Civil War, the 1892 ration was developed, providing for fresh meat, fish and vegetables. Although advances had been made in food processing, preservation, storage and refrigeration techniques, food often spoiled over long distances or in warm climates, as these techniques had not been perfected. During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, many soldiers suffered serious illness as the result of rotten or fermented food. Also in 1892, Captain Charles Woodruff conducted the first military nutrition survey, and earned the title \\"foremost student of the diet of the American soldier\\".Thomspon, W. Gilman. \\"Modern Dietetic Principles: Their Practical Application.\\" Boston Medical and Surgical Journal. Vol. 162, Iss. 2 Through his research, he observed gradual improvement in the quality of Army rations and noted the need for further research and development to ensure the continuation of this trend. While rations continued to improve, broad distribution of perishable foods did not occur until World War I, when technological advances made it possible to supply camps with fresh meats, eggs, dairy products and vegetables. While overseas, American soldiers consumed the generally adequate Pershing garrison rations, which lacked dairy and vegetable products. Problems such as these were overcome later with the development of the \\"New Army Ration.\\" 1917‚Äì1941 Facing food shortages in both military and civilian populations during World War I, it was important to address reports of food wastage at military training camps. The Division of Food and Nutrition of the Medical Department, U.S. Army (established in 1918 by the War Department) instructed that nutritional surveys should be conducted to assess food requirements and economy. Findings showed that garrison rations were providing an excess of food, were nutritionally unbalanced and had a high fat content. Based on these findings, a new ‚Äútraining ration‚Äù was developed to avoid waste. The first issue of the Journal of Nutrition was published in 1928 by the American Institute of Nutrition (AIN). AIN was the first independent scientific society for researchers in the field of nutrition. It was cofounded by an Army nutrition officer, John R. Murlin.Nasset, E. M. \\"Professor John R. Murlin and the Beginnings of The Journal of Nutrition.\\" The Journal of Nutrition. April 2003. 133 While military nutrition research came to a stop between World War I and World War II, the League of Nations established the Commission on Nutrition to make detailed recommendations based on sound scientific principles of nutrition. The Commission's Mixed Committee on the Problem of Nutrition published its final report, emphasizing the importance of foods such as green leafy vegetables, fruit and milk.Final Report of the Mixed Committee of the League of Nations on the Relation of Nutrition to Health, Agriculture, and Economic Policy. Geneva, 1937. 1941‚Äì1953 In response to an observation of poor nutritional status among enlisting men, the National Academy of Sciences and the National Research Council created a force that defines the minimum need and safety margin for nutrient intake. Using available data, the task force specified a tentative set of allowances, intended to address the nutritional needs of civilians and military personnel. These allowances eventually became the Food and Nutrition Board‚Äôs Recommended Dietary Allowances.Harper, A.E. \\"Origin of Recommended Daily Allowances-An Historic Overview\\". American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. 41(1). 1985 The Medical Nutrition Laboratory (formerly the Food and Nutrition Laboratory, founded in 1942) along with the Medical Nutrition Laboratory of the Quartermaster Food and Container Institute developed and subsequently improved the individual \\"D\\", \\"K\\", \\"C\\", Survival and Emergency rations. By June 1945, the Army had 157 nutrition officers. Between 1941 and 1946, more than 30 field ration surveys were conducted to assess health, performance and nutritional status of troops in different environments.Nutrition in the National Defense (1941‚Äì53) World War II and Post-War Era. Military-Nutrition.com. In 1949, Congress authorized the construction of a new Quartermaster research facility in Natick, Massachusetts. After several name changes, the facility would eventually be known as the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center. 1953‚Äì1974 In 1958, the Army's Medical Nutrition Laboratory in Chicago, IL, and the Research and Development Department of Fitzsimons General Hospital in Aurora, Colorado, were combined to form the U.S. Army Medical Research and Nutrition Laboratory (USAMRNL). This institution quickly became known as the nation's leading laboratory for human nutrition research and conducted broad and extensive studies.Kuemmerlin, A. J., et al. \\"Three Decades of Endeavor-A Bibliography: 1944‚Äì1974.\\" U.S. Army Medical Research and Nutrition Laboratory.

Meanwhile, in 1955, the Interdepartmental Committee on Nutrition for National Defense (ICNND) was established to address nutritional problems.Sandstead, H. H. \\"Origins of the Interdepartmental Committee on Nutrition for National Defense, and a Brief Note Concerning Its Demise\\". The Journal of Nutrition. 135:1257‚Äì1262, May 2005 After reorganization in 1967, the ICNND published a Ten State Nutrition Survey,Ten-State Nutrition Survey in the United States, 1968‚Äì70. Preliminary Report to the Congress. April 1971. exploring issues such as serious hunger, malnutrition and related health concerns. The findings of this report spurred the creation of the Food Stamp program (1974), nutrition programs for the elderly, the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) supplemental nutrition program (1972), the USDA school breakfast program (permanently authorized in 1975), military dietary reform, and the establishment of NIH- funded Nutrition Research Centers. 1974‚Äì1980 The Letterman Army Institute of Research (LAIR) was at the forefront of Military Nutrition Research and conducted studies in various areas of medicine, optics, toxicology and nutrition throughout the latter half of the 1970s. Nutrition research targeted the development of new methodologies for the measurement of nutrient intake, identification of contaminants in food, assessment of the nutritional adequacy of the soldier's diet, and assessment of feeding system changes at selected military dining facilities. Scientists also conducted studies exploring the specific roles and mechanisms of nutrients such as vitamin A,Hodges, R.E., et al. \\"Hematopoietic Studies in Vitamin A Deficiencies\\". The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. 31(5) 1978. vitamin C,Milne, D.B. et al. \\"Effect of Ascorbic Acid on Copper and Cholesterol in adult cynomolgus monkeys fed a diet marginal in copper\\".

Although driven primarily by military concerns, scientists at LAIR and its predecessor labs also contributed essential knowledge to our general understanding of nutrition as it applies to the human body. Among other things, they established requirement recommendations for water, vitamins, and minerals and provided insight on the effects of calorie deprivation. In the late 1970s, a series of Army management decisions and congressional directives threatened to abolish the nutrition research program at LAIR. Dr. Allan L. Forbes argued strongly for the continuation of nutrition research at LAIR, noting ‚Äúit would be tragic in the extreme to see dissolution of the finest clinical nutrition research facility we have.‚Äù Although those at LAIR had made great efforts and achievements, the Army Nutrition Research Program was suspended in 1980 after Army and Congressional priority decisions. All assets from the Army's military nutrition program were transferred to the USDA's Western Human Nutrition Research Center in Davis, California. 1980‚Äì1986 Although the Army Research Program had been suspended, the Department of Defense continued to conduct nutrition research. During the early 1980s, some military nutrition studies continued at the Naval Health Research Center, the Naval Submarine Medical Research Laboratory, the Food Engineering Laboratory at the Natick Research and Development Laboratories, the Army Institute of Surgical Research, the Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. After the National Research Council's Advisory Board on Military Personnel Supplies (ABMPS) observed that insufficient attention was paid to nutrition by armed services food programs, funding was granted to establish a Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) Committee on Military Nutrition Research (CMNR). Since its creation in 1982, the CMNR has published more than 50 reports containing analysis, guidance and recommendations to the Department of Defense on nutrition-related priorities. During the 1980s, new feeding systems were developed, including MREs and T rations. MREs (Meals Ready to Eat) are complete meals in flexible pouches that replaced the less adequate ‚ÄúC-Ration.‚Äù The heat-and-serve tray-pack ‚ÄúT‚Äù ration was developed to provide the option of a hot meal when cooks were unavailable. In 1983, field trials began to test the adequacy of the MRE ration for long- term subsistence, leading to concerns about weight loss.Marriott, B.M. Not Eating Enough, Overcoming Underconsumption of Military Operational Rations. National Academy Press. Washington, DC. 1995. p. 100-105. Following these trials, a new military nutrition research division known as the Nutrition Task Force was established at the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine. One of the Nutrition Task Force's first objectives was to complete an intensive field trial of rations to test ration acceptance and intake over extended periods of time. The second half of the 1980s saw continued investment in military nutrition research and in 1986, the Nutrition Task force became the Military Nutrition Division. 1986‚Äìpresent In 1986, the U.S. Army retook the lead in basic and applied military nutrition science, presided over by the Department of Defense Combat Feeding and Research Program (CFREP), and providing a research, technology and engineering base for combat feeding systems. Since then, the Military Nutrition Division at the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM) has been at the forefront of physical, physiological, and nutritional requirements research to address the needs of modern military personnel. The Military Nutrition Division, in collaboration with the Pennington Biomedical Research Center, has made several scientific advances in understanding the energy and nutritional requirements of healthy individuals performing in extreme environments, addressed comprehensive menu modification and enabled the development of improved food composition databases, and developed weight control intervention programs for soldiers.Military Nutrition Division Brochure. USARIEM. 2008 This alliance has also allowed for investigation of performance-enhancing ration components (PERCs), improving human performance by at least 15%, and leading to developments such as the HOOAH! energy bar and the ERGO (Energy Rich Glucose Optimized) energy drink.Modern Military Nutrition Research (1986‚Äìpresent), MilitaryNutrition.com During the 1990s, several nutrition studies were conducted, including studies on nutritional influences on immune function, nutritional interventions and susceptibility to disease during high- stress training, and the role of energy balance in disease resistance. The latter study directly led to changes in food allowances for U.S. Army Ranger Training and other high-intensity programs. Through modern research, ration and hydration requirements have been defined for soldiers and personnel working in high altitudes and in extreme temperatures. Working alongside scientists at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center, scientists of the Military Nutrition Division at USARIEM continue to improve ration technologies, address nutrition concerns, establish new programs for soldier weight management and otherwise optimize warfighter performance through military nutrition research.

His mother, Sybil Dessena, was discussed in Anthony Lo Frasso's book Diez libros de fortuna d'Amor in 1575. Delitala was indicted in 1572 and taken into prison, possibly for a crime associated with vengeance. He was acquitted by a parliamentary committee in 1573. In 1583, he participated in the General Parliament. He sent his brother Agostino Angelo as his delegate. In 1589, Delitala was again imprisoned, this time under the Inquisition, which imposed a fine of 5,600 Sardinian lire upon him. He left prison in 1590 through the intervention of his friend the historian Giovanni Francesco Fara. In 1593, he was summoned to Parliament, and sent Ramon de Cetrilla as his delegate. He married around 1595 and had 5 children: Agostino Angelo, Giovanni Geronimo, Pietro, Diego and Francesco.

In retaliation for an Irish Republican Army (IRA) ambush of a police raiding party, Protestant loyalists attacked Catholic enclaves, burning homes and businesses. This sparked clashes and gun battles between Catholics and Protestants, including republican and loyalist paramilitaries. There were also gun battles between republicans and police, and it is claimed that some police patrols fired indiscriminately at Catholic civilians. Seventeen people were killed on 10 July, and a further eleven were killed or fatally wounded over the following week. At least 100 people were injured. About 200 houses were badly damaged or destroyed, leaving 1,000 people homeless.Parkinson, Alan F. Belfast's Unholy War. Four Courts Press, Dublin 2004; , pg. 154. The violence took place just before a truce came into effect, which ended the war in most of Ireland. Background Belfast saw almost 500 people die in political and sectarian violence from 1920‚Äì22. Violence in the city broke out in the summer of 1920. It was partly in response to the Irish Republican Army (IRA) assassinating British Army officer Gerald Smyth from Banbridge in July, and Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) Detective Oswald Swanzy after a Protestant church service in nearby Lisburn in August. Loyalists forced 7,000 Catholics and some Protestant trade unionists from their jobs in the Belfast shipyards and more than 50 people were killed in rioting between Catholics and Protestants.Parkinson, p. 317. There was sporadic violence in Belfast over the following year, until fierce fighting flared in the summer of 1921. At the time, Irish republican and British authorities were negotiating a Truce to end the war. On 10 June 1921, IRA volunteers shot three RIC officers on the Falls Road, fatally wounding one, Constable James Glover. He had been targeted because the IRA suspected him of being part of a group of police officers involved in sectarian killings of Catholics. This attack sparked a wave of violence over the following three days, during which at least 14 people were killed and 14 wounded, including three Catholics who were taken from their homes and killed by uniformed police.Parkinson, pp. 137‚Äì138. Sporadic violence continued in the city over the next month until another outbreak of violence that led to \\"Bloody Sunday\\". On 8 July, the RIC attempted to carry out searches in the mainly Catholic and republican enclave around Union and Stanhope streets. However, they were confronted by about 15 IRA volunteers, leading to an hour-long firefight.Parkinson, p. 151 The events of July 1921 On 9 July a truce to suspend hostilities was agreed in Dublin between representatives of the Irish Republic and the British government, to come into effect at noon on 11 July. Many Protestants/unionists condemned the truce as a 'sell-out' to republicans.Bell, J Bowyer. The Secret Army: The IRA. Transaction Publishers, 1997. pp. 29‚Äì30; / On the night of 9‚Äì10 July, hours after the truce was announced, the RIC attempted to launch a raid in the Lower Falls district of west Belfast. Scouts alerted the IRA of the raid by blowing whistles, banging dustbin lids and flashing a red light. On Raglan Street, a unit of about 14 IRA volunteers ambushed an armoured police truck, killing one officer and wounding at least two others. The officer killed was Thomas Conlon, a Catholic from County Roscommon, who, ironically, was viewed as \\"sympathetic\\" to the local nationalists.Glennon, Kieran. Today in Irish History ‚Äì July 10 1921 ‚Äì Belfast‚Äôs Bloody Sunday. The Irish Story. 10 July 2015. This sparked an outbreak of ferocious fighting between Catholics and Protestants in west Belfast the following day, Sunday 10 July, in which 16 people (11 Catholics and 5 Protestants) lost their lives and between 161 and 200 houses were destroyed.Parkinson, pp. 153‚Äì4. Of the houses destroyed, 150 were owned by Catholics.Lynch, Robert. The Northern IRA and the Early Years of Partition. Irish Academic Press, Dublin 2006; , pg. 79. Most of the dead were civilians and at least four of the Catholic victims were ex-WWI servicemen. Protestants, \\"fearful of absorption into a Green, Catholic Ireland [...] and blindly angered by the presence of heresy and treason in their midst, struck [...] at the Catholic community\\" while \\"vengeful Catholics struck back with counter-terror\\". Gun battles raged all day along the sectarian 'boundary' between the Catholic Falls and Protestant Shankill districts and rival gunmen used rifles, machine guns and hand grenades in the clashes. Gunmen were seen firing from windows, rooftops and street corners. A \\"loyalist mob, several thousand strong\\" attempted to storm the Falls district, carrying petrol and other flammable materials. A tram travelling from the Falls into the city centre was struck by snipers' bullets, and the service had to be suspended. The Irish News reported that the Falls district was \\"in a state of siege\\". The New York Times characterised the clashes as \\"a three-fold fight between Sinn F√©in and Unionist snipers and Crown forces\\". It added, \\"In the extent of material damage to property, Sunday's rioting can be compared to the Dublin Rising in 1916\\". New York Times, 11 July 1921. Catholics and republicans claimed that police‚Äîmostly from the Ulster Special Constabulary (USC)‚Äîdrove through Catholic enclaves in armoured cars firing indiscriminately at houses and bystanders. A 13-year-old Catholic girl, Mary McGowan, was shot dead by USC officers firing from an armoured car. The inquest into her death concluded that they had \\"deliberately\\" shot the girl and added: \\"In the interests of peace, Special Constabulary should not be allowed into localities of people of opposite denominations\\". William Baxter (a 12 year old Protestant boy) and Ernest Park (a 16 year old) were shot dead by nationalist snipers. The police returned to their barracks late on Sunday night, allegedly after a ceasefire had been agreed by telephone between a senior RIC officer and the commander of the IRA's Belfast Brigade, Roger McCorley. The truce was due to come into effect at midday on Monday 11 July, but violence resumed that morning. Three people were shot dead that day, including an IRA volunteer who was shot minutes before midday. In the north the official truce did not end the fighting. IRA members later recalled, \\"The Truce was not observed by either side in the north\\", while McCorley said the truce in Belfast \\"lasted six hours only\\".Both quotes, Lynch p. 80. While the IRA was involved in the violence, it did not control the actions of the Catholic community. An IRA officer reported that \\"the Catholic mob is almost beyond control\\".Fearghal McGarry. Eoin O'Duffy, a Self-Made Hero. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2005; , pg. 78. Tuesday 12 July saw the Orange Order's yearly Twelfth marches pass off peacefully and there were no serious disturbances in the city. However, sporadic violence resumed on Wednesday, and by the end of the week 28 people in all had been killed or fatally wounded in Belfast.Parkinson, pp. 154‚Äì55. At the time the day was referred to as \\"Belfast's Bloody Sunday\\". However the title of \\"Bloody Sunday\\", is now more commonly given in Ireland to events in Dublin in November 1920 or Derry in January 1972. Aftermath A strict curfew was enforced in Belfast after the violence, to try to ensure the Orange Order's 12 July marches passed off peacefully. Directly after the violence, on 11 July, the Commandant of the IRA's 2nd Northern Division, Eoin O'Duffy, was sent to Belfast by the organization's leadership in Dublin to liaise with the British authorities there and try to maintain the truce. He said, \\"I found the city in a veritable state of war. The peal of rifles could be heard on all sides, frenzied mobs at every street corner, terror-stricken people rushing for their lives, and ambulances carrying the dead and dying to hospitals.\\"McGarry, pp. 78‚Äì79. O'Duffy set up headquarters in St Mary's Hall in Belfast city centre and made contact with British forces and the press. With the tacit consent of the RIC, he organized IRA patrols to try to restore order in Catholic areas and announced that IRA action would cease except in self-defence. Both Protestants and Catholics saw the truce as a victory for republicans. Protestant unionists \\"were particularly appalled by the sight of policemen and soldiers meeting IRA officers on a semi-official basis\\". However, in Belfast this temporary ceasefire only lasted until the end of August. The violence of the period in Belfast was cyclical, and the events of July 1921 were followed by a lull until a three-day period starting on 29 August, when another 20 lives were lost in the west and north of the city.Parkinson, p. 318. The conflict in Belfast between the IRA and British forces and between Catholics and Protestants continued until the following summer, when the northern IRA was left isolated by the outbreak of the Irish Civil War in the south and weakened by the rigorous enforcement of internment in Northern Ireland.

Services that are categorized into a particular layer share functionality. This helps to reduce the conceptual overhead related to managing the service inventory, as the services belonging to the same layer address a smaller set of activities. Rationale Grouping services into functional layers reduces the impact of change. Most changes affect only the layer in which they're made, with few side-effects that impact other layers. This fundamentally simplifies service maintenance. The service reusability principle dictates that services should be designed to maximize reuse. Similarly, the service composability principle advocates designing services so that they can be composed in various ways. Both principles require that a service contain only a specific type of logic e.g., either reusable or process-specific logic.Thomas Erl.Introducing SOA Design Pattern[Online]. Date accessed:6 April 2010. Restricting each layer to a particular functionality, simplifies the design of the service. Usage Diagram A In the absence of any layers, services contain a mixture of different types of logic. This makes it difficult to manage these services. Diagram B A service inventory divided into layers where each layer contains the same type of logic. Applying this pattern requires creating a service inventory blueprint, a list of services with associated functionality. Next, group the services into layers according to function. Adopting a common layering strategy across the enterprise facilitates reuse in other applications, because developers don't have as much to learn (or invent) when they join a project. One common layering uses task, entity and utility. Wajid Khattak Service Layers[Online].Date accessed: 21 April 2010.

The Institute's researchers won multiple Nobel Prizes. Due to the gradual change of interests, \\"nuclear physics\\" was added to the institute's name in 1956. Since 2004, it is called the Stefan-Meyer-Institute for subatomic physics. History The Sankt Joachimsthal mines were located within the Austria-Hungary monarchy, and were the largest producers of uranium containing ore at the end of the 19th century. Eduard Suess sent the first samples of pitchblende to Pierre and Marie Curie for their research on radioactive materials. This action was taken after the advice of Franz Serafin Exner. After the discovery of radium, the Austrian industrial Karl Kupelwieser donated 500,000 Austrian kronen to found an institute for research on radium in 1908. After constructing the building for the institute in 1909‚Äì1910, the institute was opened on 28 October 1910. Stefan Meyer became the first acting director, and Franz Serafin Exner was the director of the institute until Meyer took over in 1920. Meyer stayed in that position until the Anschluss √ñsterreichs in 1938, the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany, forced him to retire due to his Jewish ancestors.St. Sienell und Chr. Ottner: Das Archiv des Instituts f√ºr Radiumforschung, Anzeiger der √ñsterr. Akad. d. Wissenschaften Abt. II, 140, 11-53 (2004) After the war, he was reinstated as director and performed his duties until his retirement in 1947. The starting years were dominated by the research on the new element radium. Meyer was able to organize the production of 4 gram radium, as recommended in 1901 by the Austrian Academy of Sciences. The chemical plant of Carl Auer von Welsbach, which was used to produce rare-earth elements, provided the necessary technical equipment and knowledge required for separation of small quantities of material from ore. This relative large amount made it possible for Otto H√∂nigschmid to determine the molecular mass of radium using 1.5 g of radium bromide. Victor Franz Hess was working on the absorption of gamma rays in the atmosphere. His discovery of cosmic rays in 1912, which was rewarded by the Nobel Prize in 1936, was a direct result of his work in the institute. George de Hevesy and Friedrich Adolf Paneth developed at the Institute the radioactive tracers method, for which Hevesy received the Nobel Prize in 1943. Initially, very few women scientists worked at the Institute, including Berta Karlik and Marietta Blau; however, the percentage of women reached 30% during the time of Meyer. From 1945 to 1974, Berta Karlik directed the Institute. In 1955, Karlik became professor for nuclear physics at the University of Vienna, so that the Institute was now both an Academy and a University Institute. Herbert Vonach succeeded her as director from 1974 to 1986. The institute was renamed in 1956, so that \\"nuclear physics\\" was now included in the title - corresponding to the widened research interests. In 1987, the institute was converted into an \\"Institute for Intermediate Energy Physics\\" under the direction of W. H. Breunlich.http://medienportal.univie.ac.at/uniview/veranstaltungen/detailansicht/artikel/physik- mit-strahlender-vergangenheit/  Honour  On 28 May 2015, the Institute received the title \\"Historic Site\\" by the European Physical Society.http://www.eps.org/?page=distinction_sites[tt_news]=65&tx;_ttnews[backPid]=23&cHash;=bab2a18726  Successor organisations  There are now two separate successor organisations: * The Stefan Meyer Institute for subatomic Physics of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (SMI, earlier: Institute for Intermediate Energy Physics) that investigates the Strong Interaction in cooperation with foreign research centers. * The Institute for Isotope Research and Nuclear Physics of the University of Vienna which uses the particle accelerator VERA for Radiocarbon Dating and similar dating methods.

He was the father of two other American military men. Early life William Harris was born October 7, 1757, on his parents' farm in Willistown Township in the Province of Pennsylvania.Joseph S. Harris, 1903, p. 21. His father, Thomas Harris (1722‚Äì1799), had immigrated from Ireland about 1745.Joseph S. Harris, 1903, p. 20. His mother, the former Elizabeth Bailey (1726‚Äì1799), also an immigrant from Ireland, was the heir of her childless uncle, Alexander Bailey, owner of the farm.Joseph S. Harris, 1903, pp. 20-21. About 1760, the family moved to nearby Grubb's mill, and about 1768, they moved to neighboring East Whiteland Township in the Great Valley of Pennsylvania where, in 1770, Thomas Harris bought a farm just inside the Welsh Tract. This farm was William Harris' home for the rest of his life. Thomas and Elizabeth Harris had nine children, seven of whom‚Äîtwo sons and five daughters‚Äîlived to adulthood.Joseph S. Harris, 1903, p. 27. Both sons, William and his older brother John (1753‚Äì1838), participated in the American Revolution.Joseph S. Harris, 1903, p. 22. Military service William Harris joined the Pennsylvania militia at the age of 18, as the Revolutionary War broke out. The first known mention of him appears in a memorandum book of Captain Persifor Frazer in the summer of 1776, which calls him a sergeant.Joseph S. Harris, 1903, p. 33. In March 1777 he was appointed a second lieutenant in Captain John Marshall's company of the State Regiment of Foot, Col. John Bull, commander.Joseph S. Harris, 1898, p. 15. In time, he rose to the rank of captain. He is listed as captain of the 5th Company, 5th Battalion, of the Pennsylvania Militia for 1777, and of the 4th Company, 4th Battalion for 1780.Revolutionary War Militia Organization: Chester Co., Pa. His regiment was taken into the Pennsylvania Line of the Continental Army, and became the Thirteenth Regiment, which saw action in the battles of the Brandywine and Germantown and several minor engagements. Although records exist showing his involvement in a number of troop movements later in the Revolution, his battalion appears not to have seen any battles in the later years of the war. His name appears on a list of Chester County residents who applied to the government for reparations after the war was over.Futhey and Cope, 1881. Harris was involved in the capture of Joseph Doane, a notorious highwayman and member of a family of robbers, in 1782.Joseph S. Harris, 1898, p. 16. Harris again saw service in 1794, when the militia was called upon to suppress the Whiskey Rebellion in western Pennsylvania. He served as captain of the eighth company of the Chester County regiment, and was the regimental paymaster. He continued his involvement with the state military organization for the rest of his life. In 1811, he was commissioned brigadier general of the Second Brigade, Third Division of Pennsylvania troops. When the War of 1812 broke out, Governor Simon Snyder called up 14,000 troops, including Harris, but the new general died before the troops took the field. Legislative service Harris was elected to the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1779, 1780, 1810, and 1811. He served on the committee to arrange the procedures for the election of the state's president and vice-president in 1780. He participated in the last session of the legislature before his death. Other activities Although a lifetime farmer, Harris was actively involved in community affairs, and was especially interested in public education. He was instrumental in the founding of the Chester County academy. While in the legislature, he obtained an appropriation to build the school's buildings, and he donated the land on which they were built, which was a part of his farm.Joseph S. Harris, 1903, pp. 33-34.Joseph S. Harris, 1898, p. 17. He is listed as a member of Masonic Lodge No. 59, founded in East Whiteland in 1790.Futhey and Cope, 1995, p. 395. He was also an elder of the Great Valley Presbyterian Church, which his family had joined upon leaving St. Peter's Church in the Great Valley during the Revolution because St. Peter's, an Anglican congregation, continued to say prayers for the King,Joseph S.

Due to the fame of his son, actor William G. Nunn III, he was also known as Bill Nunn Sr. Biography=Early life Nunn was born and raised in the Homewood neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He is the son of William G. Nunn Sr., who was the managing editor of the Pittsburgh Courier. The Courier was among the most influential black publications in the nation. The younger Nunn attended college at West Virginia State where he was a stand-out basketball player on a team which went in his senior season. His high school and college teammate, Chuck Cooper would become the first black player drafted by the NBA. Another college teammate, Earl Lloyd, was the first black to play in an NBA game. Nunn was recruited by the Harlem Globetrotters, but chose instead to return home to Pittsburgh to work at the Courier. Journalism Nunn started as a sportswriter at the Courier, and eventually moved up to become the sports editor and then managing editor in the mid-1960s after his father's retirement. Scouting career As a sportswriter for a black publication, Nunn developed deep knowledge of football programs at historically black colleges and universities. The Courier named a \\"Black College All-America\\" team starting in 1950. The NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers noted Nunn's coverage of these players who were traditionally under-represented in the league and in Nunn accepted a part-time position on team's scouting staff. The sideline became a full-time position two years later when Chuck Noll became the team's coach. Personal Nunn lived with his wife, Frances, in the Schenley Heights neighborhood of Pittsburgh. Their son Bill was an actor; he played Radio Raheem in Do The Right Thing. Because of his son's fame, the elder Nunn referred to himself as Bill Nunn Sr. Their daughter, Lynell Wilson, is a former U.S. Attorney. Nunn died on May 6, 2014 at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, two weeks after suffering a stroke. Burial was at Homewood Cemetery, Pittsburgh. Nunn is survived by his wife Frances, his daughter Lynell, his three grandchildren Jessica Nunn, Matthew Wilson and Cydney Nunn, and one great grandchild.

It is a Carnegie library and is the first public library built for African Americans staffed entirely by African Americans.It is not however the first Carnegie library built for African- Americans. Built in 1907 and opened the following year, it is predated by an academic library which opened in 1902 at the institution now known as Tuskegee University (a historically black university). Previously known as Louisville Free Public Library, Western Colored Branch, and registered as a historic site in that name, it is a branch of the Louisville Free Public Library system. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. With History The Western Colored Branch library first opened in September 1905 and was originally located at 1125 West Chestnut Street. At the time it was common for black libraries to be housed in rented or converted private facilities; when the Western Colored Branch first opened it was operated in three rented rooms in a private home. Albert Ernest Meyzeek, principal of Central High School at the time, was concerned about the lack of adequate reading and reference materials at the school.\\"The Record of Albert Ernest Meyzeek\\" (1947). Negro History Bulletin, 10(8)p.186-187 He challenged the 1902 legislation that created the Louisville Free Public Library system, on the basis that it did not adequately serve African Americans, and persuaded the city council to open a branch to fill this need. Meyzeek later pushed for a second black library, the Eastern Colored Branch (which opened in 1914).  Carnegie's involvement  In 1908, industrialist Andrew Carnegie donated funds to build a new library building. As a result, the Western Colored Branch became the first public library for African Americans in the American South that was housed in a Carnegie-funded facility. The new library building was designed by McDonald & Dodd. The building is in plan, and is built of brick with stone trim. The library was well received by the community. It marked a new level of civic engagement by \\"the emerging, turn-of-the-century, southern black middle class\\" which was determined to \\"build positive community infrastuctures for purposes of racial uplift.\\"  Early success (1910s-1930s)  Several prominent African-American librarians worked in the Western Branch and assisted in education and outreach programs for the local black community. Of particular note are Reverend Thomas Fountain Blue, who served as the administrative head of the Western and Eastern Colored Branches as well as Rachel Davis Harris, who served as the children's library specialist and chief assistant. Blue and Harris were influential in providing services to Louisville's African American community during the Jim Crow era. In 1917, about 12,000 people attended 498 meetings at both branches. Blue created a community outreach strategy, he said the library was much more than a place to store books. ‚ÄúWith its reading and study rooms, its lecture and classrooms, it forms a center from which radiate many influences for general betterment. The people feel that the library belongs to them, and that it may be used for anything that makes for their welfare.‚Äù The two branches (Western and Eastern) became community social centers and regional models for other libraries like it. The library included a Children's Department, which developed story time, debates, and special events. The library also held an annual spelling bee with Cup winners and cash rewards sponsored by Joseph S. Cotter, a local black educator. The prominent Douglass Debate Club for high school boys, which argued civil rights topics, studied and cooperated with this branch. The library also helped set up forty classroom collections at eleven African American city and county schools. By 1935 this had expanded to eighty classroom collections as well as library services administered at two junior high schools and the development of 15 deposit stations. From 1912 to 1931, Blue also organized and held an apprenticeship librarian class, which was the \\"only opportunity for formal training for prospective black librarians\\" until the Hampton Library School was opened in 1925 in Virginia.  Recent developments  The library was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. In 2001 Prince anonymously donated $12,000 to keep the library from closure.

Published purportedly without Bradstreet's knowledge, Bradstreet wrote to her publisher acknowledging that she knew of the publication. She was forced to pretend she was unaware of the publication until afterwards, or she would have risked harsh criticism. Bradstreet wrote the poem \\"The Author to Her Book\\" in 1666 when a second edition was contemplated. The book was published, without Bradstreet's knowledge, by the Rev. John Woodbridge. Woodbridge took the manuscript to England where it was published. The \\"Four Monarchies\\" is regarded by some critics as epic. Criticism Many critics believe that Bradstreet was a woman who pushed the boundaries of her religion. Fortunately for her, she did not suffer negative consequences like Anne Hutchinson, who was also a Puritan writer of her time.Tonti, Kaitlin, \\"Seeping Through the Divide: The American Experience in Bradstreet's Verse\\" (2013).

Blair, who originally took up an offer to sell raincoats. After several unsuccessful attempts at selling the coats, he was asked by an undertaker if he had any attractive black raincoats. He didn't, but it gave him an idea. The idea John had was to take advantage of the relatively new process of rubber vulcanization to adhere an attractive black wool fabric to the outside of a rubber raincoat, with an inner lining of a Scottish plaid. His classmate agreed to begin producing just such a coat and supplied him initially with 1200 coats, which were purchased almost immediately. He actually had to send out letters of apology until new coats could be produced. Samples of his letters from as early as 1910 still exist.http://www.blair.com/custserv/custserv.jsp?pageName=Story With the help of his father and siblings, John mailed 10,000 letters to undertakers across America and the coat quickly saturated the market. He expanded with letters to ministers and businessmen, and he also expanded his product line. For the first few years his business was known as New Process Rubber Company, and by 1916 it was changed to New Process Company. New Process Company went public in 1924. By the mid-1980s, New Process was also said to be the largest publicly held direct-marketer of clothing and home products in the United States, and also had the oldest continually traded stock on the American Stock Exchange.International directory of company histories, Vol. 25.

It had sales in 1988 of US$414 million, US$506.8 million in 1998, and US$420 million in 2007.

A hungry ghost (Tibetan: yidag, yi-dvags; Sanskrit: preta, ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§§) has a tiny throat and huge stomach, and so can never be satisfied. Ghosts may be killed with a ritual dagger or caught in a spirit trap and burnt, thus releasing them to be reborn. Ghosts may also be exorcised, and an annual festival is held throughout Tibet for this purpose. Nature of ghosts Tibetan Buddhists believe that when a person dies, they enter the intermediate Bardo state, from which they may be reborn in this world in a human or animal body, in the ghost world in a ghost body, in one of the paradise realms or in one of the hells. But eventually, the person will die in this after-death world and be reborn as a human or other creature unless they achieve Nirvana, where they are beyond all states of embodiment. Hungry ghosts have their own realm depicted on the Bhavacakra and are represented as teardrop or paisley-shaped with bloated stomachs and necks too thin to pass food, so that attempting to eat is also incredibly painful. Some are described as having \\"mouths the size of a needle's eye and a stomach the size of a mountain\\". This is a metaphor for people futilely attempting to fulfill their illusory physical desires. Buddha taught that the principal causes of rebirth as a hungry ghost are greed and negative actions motivated by miserliness. The consequence of these actions is extreme poverty. If by chance they come across a drop of water or a scrap of food it disappears like a mirage, or transforms into something repulsive such as pus or urine. These appearances are due to their negative karma and lack of merit. Sometime individuals have a predominance of hungry ghost in their makeup. They can never get enough, and are always hungry for more. The Tibetan word for the emotional state of the hungry ghost, ser na, literally means \\"yellow nosed\\", and could be said to mean \\"meanness\\" or \\"lack of generosity\\". The person in this state is constantly seeking to consume and to enrich themselves, but can never be satisfied. A tulpa is a type of ghost or being that is created through mental effort, purely from the thoughts of its creator. A very skilled Buddhist practitioner or sorcerer may have this ability, and in some cases a Tulpa may be created from the collective thoughts of the villagers. Such a ghost is not self-aware at first, but may gradually acquire awareness and go on to become a normal human being. Dealing with ghosts=Phurba The phurba (Tibetan: ‡Ωï‡Ω¥‡Ω¢‡ºã‡Ωñ, Sanskrit: kƒ´la) is a ritual dagger used by a tantric practitioner to release an evil spirit from its suffering and guide it to a better rebirth. Such a spirit (ghost) is a being which lingers in confusion between different realms. By plunging the dagger into it, it is thrown out of its confusion and gets the chance to be reborn, probably as a lower kind than human. Spirit traps Families often mount ghost-traps on the roofs of their houses, spindle-like contraptions wound with colored yarns. A spirit trap may also be hung in a tree. The series of interlocking threads is thought to ensnare the spirit, and is burnt when the job is done. Exorcising-Ghost day The Tibetan religious ceremony 'Gutor' ‡ºº‡Ωë‡ΩÇ‡Ω¥‡ºã‡ΩÇ‡Ωè‡Ωº‡Ω¢‡ºã‡ºΩ, literally offering of the 29th, is held on the 29th of the 12th Tibetan month, with its focus on driving out all negativity, including evil spirits and misfortunes of the past year, and starting the new year in a peaceful and auspicious way. The temples and monasteries throughout Tibet hold grand religious dance ceremonies, with the largest at Potala Palace in Lhasa. Families clean their houses on this day, decorate the rooms and eat a special noodle soup called 'Guthuk'. ‡ºº‡Ωë‡ΩÇ‡Ω¥‡ºã‡Ωê‡Ω¥‡ΩÇ‡ºã‡ºΩ In the evening, the people carry torches, calling out the words of exorcism. A folk tale A story tells of a man who met a ghost while out walking. The ghost started walking with him, which made him very frightened, although he hid his fear and pretended that he too was a ghost. They came to a town. The ghost left the man resting, entered the town and stole the soul of the king's son, tying it up in a yak hair sack. Returning to the man, the ghost left the sack in his care for a while. The man took the sack into the town, where the king was in great alarm because his son was dying. The man promised to revive the boy, conducting rituals and at the same time releasing the boy's soul from the bag. When the boy revived, the king gave the man half of all his property as reward.

He was the State Department Coordinator for U.S. Assistance to Europe and Eurasia, and subsequently the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization from 2003 to 2005. Later he served at the Brookings institution and was appointed Special Envoy and Coordinator for International Energy Affairs at the State Department's Bureau of Energy from 2011 to 2014. He currently serves as senior vice president at IHS Markit. Education Pascual attended Bishop Amat Memorial High School in La Puente, California, and graduated in 1976. He then earned a B.A. in international relations from Stanford University in 1980 and an M.P.P. from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in 1982. He was a student of Coit D. Blacker. Career Pascual worked for USAID from 1983 to 1995 in Sudan, South Africa and Mozambique, and as Deputy Assistant Administrator for Europe and Eurasia. From July 1998 to January 2000, Pascual served as Special Assistant to the President and NSC Senior Director for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, and from 1995 to 1998 as Director for the same region, from October 2000 until May 2003, as the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine. When the Melnychenko recordings of Leonid Kuchma became known, Pascual revealed that the tapes are genuine, undistorted, unaltered, and not manipulated because of the conclusion from FBI Electronic Research Facility's analysis of the original recording device and the original recording found that there are not unusual sounds which would indicate a tampering of the recording, the recording is continuous with no breaks, and there is no manipulation of the digital files. These recordings, known as Kuchmagate, confirmed Kuchma's involvement in the assassination by decapitation of Georgiy Gongadze and Kuchma's unwavering support for Vladimir Putin during the Cali cocaine cartel money laundering through the Putin-owned German firm St. Petersburg Real Estate Holding Company () (SPAG). His support for the recordings' authenticity directly led to the Orange Revolution of 2004 in Ukraine. He was then named Assistance Coordinator for Europe and Eurasia. In 2004, he was named Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization at the US Department of State.

Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School at the time, Brigadier General James Guest. Candidates in SFAS class 04-10 participate in logs drills in January 2010. There are now two ways for soldiers to volunteer to attend SFAS: * As an existing soldier in the US Army with the Enlisted rank of E-3 (Private First Class) or higher, and for Officers the rank of O-2 (1st Lieutenant) promotable to O-3 (Captain), or existing O-3s. * Initial Accession or IA, where an individual who has no prior military service or who has previously separated from military service first attends Infantry One Station Unit Training (OSUT, the combination of Basic Combat Training and Advanced Individual Training), Airborne School, and a preparation course to help prepare them for SFAS. This program is commonly referred to as the \\"X-Ray Program\\", derived from \\"18X\\". The candidates in this program are known as \\"X-Rays\\". Both the Active Duty and National Guard components offer Special Forces Initial Accession programs. The Active Duty program is referred to as the \\"18X Program\\" because of the Initial Entry Code that appears on the assignment orders. = Training at SFAS = A Canadian soldier participates in a timed march alongside US Army soldiers during the Special Forces Qualification Course. In 2009 the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center began to once again accept some students from allied nations wishing to attend the school. The first phase of the Special Forces Qualification Course is Special Forces Assessment and Selection (SFAS), consisting of 24 days of training held at Camp Mackall. Events in SFAS include numerous long distance land navigation courses. All land navigation courses are conducted day and night under heavy loads of equipment, in varied weather conditions, and in rough, hilly terrain. Land navigation work is done individually with no assistance from instructors or fellow students and is always done on a time limit. Each land navigation course has its maximum time limit reduced as course moves along and are upwards of each. Instructors evaluate candidates by using obstacle course runs, team events including moving heavy loads such as telephone poles and old jeep trucks through sand as a 12-man team, the Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT), a swim assessment, and numerous psychological exams such as IQ tests and the Defense Language Aptitude Battery (DLAB) test. The final event, which was discontinued in early 2009 and reintroduced sometime before December 2013, is a road march of up to known as \\"the Trek\\" or Long Range Individual Movement (LRIM). Selection outcomes: * Those who quit are Voluntarily Withdrawn (VW) by the course cadre and are generally designated NTR or Not-to-Return. This generally ends any opportunity a candidate may have to become a Special Forces soldier. Active Duty military candidates will be returned to their previous units, and IA 18X candidates will be retrained into a new MOS based upon the needs of the Army. * Candidates who are \\"medically dropped,\\" and who are not then medically discharged from the military due to serious injury, are often permitted to \\"recycle,\\" and to attempt the course again as soon as they are physically able to do so. * Candidates who successfully complete the course but who are \\"Boarded\\" and not selected (\\"Non-Select\\") are generally given the opportunity to attend selection again in 12 or 24 months.The time window to attend SFAS a second time can be heavily influenced by deployment schedules, as \\"non-selected\\" candidates are assigned to infantry units in the meantime. Upon selection at SFAS, all Active Duty enlisted and IA 18X candidates will be briefed on: * The five Special Forces Active Duty Groups * The four Special Forces Military Occupational Specialties (MOS) initially open to them * The languages spoken in each Special Forces Group Candidates will then complete what is often referred to as a '\\"wish list.\\" Enlisted candidates rank the available MOS (18B, 18C, 18D, 18E) in order of preference. Officer candidates will attend the 18A course. Both enlisted and officer candidates will list in order of preference the SF Groups in which they prefer to serve (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 10th) and the languages in which they prefer to be trained. Language selection is dependent on the Defense Language Aptitude Battery (DLAB) test scores of the candidate, as well as the SF Group to which they are assigned. Different SF Groups focus on different areas of responsibility (AOR), which require different languages. A board assigns each enlisted and officer candidate their MOS, Group placement, and language. The MOS, Group, and language that a selected candidate is assigned is not guaranteed, and is contingent upon the needs of the Special Forces community. Generally 80% of selected candidates are awarded their primary choices. Successful Active Duty candidates usually return to their previous units to await a slot in the Special Forces Qualification Course. Because an Initial Accession (IA) 18X candidate lacks a previous unit, they will normally enter the Q Course immediately. All SF trainees must have completed the United States Army Airborne School before beginning Phase 2 of the Q-Course.  Course Orientation and History: Phase I (7 weeks)  Course Description: Phase 1 of the SFQC is the SF Orientation Course, a seven-week introduction to SF. Dubbed the Orientation and History module, the course falls under the auspices of the 4th Battalion, 1st Special Warfare Training Group (Airborne). The course is separated into six modules:https://atrrs.army.mil/atrrscc/courseInfo.aspx?fy=2013&sch;=331&crs;=2E-F253%2f011-F95&crstitle;=SF+QUAL+%28ORIENTATION%29&phase;= = Module A ‚Äì Introduction to Unconventional Warfare = This module exposes the students to the overall learning objectives and outcomes of the SFQC, trains them in tactical guerrilla warfare, and provides them the operational and strategic context under which they will train for the remainder of the SFQC. Under the supervision of the cadre in Robin Sage and mentorship of the \\"G\\" chiefs, the students are expected to complete this phase with a firm understanding of what will be expected of them throughout the remainder of the SFQC and the importance of unconventional warfare in the Special Forces mission. = Module B ‚Äì Introduction to Special Forces = This module is intended to provide the soldiers an understanding of Special Forces, its history, organization, attributes and the core tasks that relate to their mission. Lessons include SFOD-A and SFOD-B numbering convention, command and control architecture, joint special-operations area, duties and responsibilities of each MOS, SF planning and organization, core mission and tasks, SOF physical fitness and nutrition. The training is to prepare potential Special Forces soldiers for what is expected of them and the standards that they must acquire to graduate the SFQC and be members of the Army Special Forces. = Module C ‚Äì Airborne Operations and Refresher = This module allows soldiers to maintain their jump proficiency and prepare for the training they will encounter throughout the SFQC. = Module D ‚Äì Special Forces Planning = This module provides the soldiers an understanding of the Special Forces Mission Planning process. The soldiers are given classes on the Military Decision Making Process followed by a practical exercise that reinforces the training. = Module E ‚Äì Operational Culture and Regional Analysis = The purpose of this instructional module is to give students a foundational understanding of the battlespace including: operational culture and a systems' analysis of an area. The lessons include a view of one's own cultural lenses, leading to an understanding of the perspective of others as well as the use of PMESII-PT system of regional analysis to deduce the capabilities, people and environment of a given area. The Pineland Area Study will be used as the basis for analysis allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the training environment. The acronym PMESII-PT refers to a form of environmental analysis which looks at the aspects of political, military, economic, social, information, infrastructure, physical environment and time aspects of the military theater.Walden J. (2011), Comparison of the STEEPLE Strategy Methodology and the Department of Defense‚Äôs PMESII-PT Methodology, Supply Chain Leadership Institute  Language and Culture: Phase II (18‚Äì25 weeks)  Emblem of the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School Phase 2 of the SFQC focuses on language and culture. During Phase 2, soldiers receive basic special-operations language training in the language assigned to them at the completion of Special Forces Assessment and Selection. Languages are broken into four categories based on their degree of difficulty to native speakers of English. Soldiers who are assigned a Category I or II language will be enrolled in an 18-week language program, while soldiers who are assigned a Category III or IV language will attend 24 weeks of language training. Students receive instruction in three basic language skills: speaking, participatory listening and reading (limited). An overview of physical and social systems, economics, politics and security, infrastructure, technology, culture and regional studies forms the cultural component. Language instruction focuses on functional application geared toward mission- related tasks, enhanced rapport building techniques, cultural mitigation strategies, interpreting and control of interpreter methods. Also during Phase 2, a progressive physical training program is started in order to prepare for Phase 3. To successfully complete Phase 2, soldiers must achieve a minimum of 1/1 Listening and Speaking as measured by the two-skill Oral Proficiency Interview.  Small Unit Tactics & SERE: Phase III (13 weeks)  Small Unit Tactics is the third phase in the qualification course. The 13-week program provides soldiers in the SFQC the apprentice-level tactical combat skills required to successfully operate on an SF OD-A. Students will master the following tactical skills: advanced marksmanship; small-unit tactics; SF common tasks; urban operations; mission analysis; advanced special operations level 1; sensitive-site exploitation; military-decision making process. At the end of Phase 3, soldiers will enroll in SERE Level C, where they will receive intensive training in support of the Code of Conduct. Training includes survival field craft skills, techniques of evasion, resistance to exploitation and resolution skills in all types of environments. Students will participate in a survival and evasion field-training exercise and in a resistance-training laboratory. The course spans three weeks with three phases of instruction. The first phase lasts approximately 10 days of academic instruction on the Code of Conduct and in SERE techniques that incorporate both classroom training and hands-on field craft. The second phase is a five-day field training exercise in which the students practice their survival and evasion skills by procuring food and water, constructing evasion fires and shelters and evading tracker dogs and aggressor forces over long distances. The final phase takes place in the resistance-training laboratory (RTL), where students are tested on their individual and collective abilities to resist interrogation and exploitation and to properly apply the six articles of the Code of Conduct in a realistic captivity scenario.  MOS Training Phase IV (14‚Äì50 weeks)  The purpose of this phase is to train selected soldiers in the critical MOS and skill level tasks and competencies required to perform the duties of a member of an SF ODA. Candidates must have successfully passed the SF Orientation Course, Language, SUT, and SERE before entering Phase IV training.

UW CULEX (Robin Sage): Phase V (4 weeks)  A Special Forces candidate conducts a pre-mission rehearsal with Army ROTC cadets role playing guerilla fighters during Robin Sage. Since 1974, Robin Sage, the culmination exercise for the SFQC, has been the litmus test for soldiers striving to earn the coveted Green Beret. (Prior to 1974, similar exercises were held under the name Devil's Arrow, Swift Strike, and Guerrilla USA.) It is during Robin Sage, held across 15 rural North Carolina counties, that soldiers must put all of the skills they have learned throughout the SFQC to the test in an unconventional-warfare training exercise. The exercise, broken into two phases, puts students on their first SFODA. The SFODA is trained, advised and mentored throughout the entire exercise from mission receipt through planning and infiltration. During the first week, the students are taught the necessary skills to survive and succeed in a UW environment using the small group instruction teaching methodology. The remaining three weeks focus on their planning and application during Robin Sage. The students are placed into an environment of political instability characterized by armed conflict that forces soldiers to exercise both individual and collective problem solving. A key to the success of the Robin Sage training is its real- world feel that is established by the use of guerrilla forces. The SFODA must assess the combat effectiveness of the G-forces, and then train them in basic individual tasks from each of the MOSs as well as collective tasks in basic small-unit tactics, while remaining responsive to asymmetrical challenges. Just as language plays a key role in all other phases of the pipeline, language skills will be put to the test during Robin Sage. During this training, the SFODA must demonstrate its knowledge of UW doctrine and operational techniques. The 15 counties that make up the People's Republic of PinelandOn the last day of isolation the detachment presents its plan to the battalion command and staff. This plan will explain how the commander intends to execute the mission. The next day, the students make an airborne infiltration into the fictitious country of \\"Pineland\\". They then make contact with the guerrilla forces and begin Robin Sage. Students will then begin their task of training, advising, and assisting the guerrillas. The training will educate the guerrillas in various specialties, including weapons, communications, medical, and demolitions. The training is designed to enable the guerrillas to begin liberating their country from oppression. It is the last portion of the Special Forces Qualification Course before they receive their \\"Green Berets\\". Robin Sage involves approximately 100 Special Forces students, 100 counter-insurgent personnel (OPFOR), 200 guerrilla personnel, 40 auxiliary personnel, and 50 cadre. The local communities of North Carolina also participate in the exercise by role playing as citizens of Pineland. The exercise is conducted in approximately of North Carolina. Many of the OPFOR and guerrilla personnel are made up of North Carolina residents who are financially compensated for their participation. The role of the guerrilla chief, \\"G-chief,\\" is sometimes played by a retired Green Beret. During the summer Robin Sage exercises, Army ROTC cadets from The Citadel act as guerrilla fighters. = 2002 death during Robin Sage = During a Robin Sage exercise on 23 February 2002, Moore County Deputy Sheriff Randall Butler shot and killed 1st Lieutenant Tallas Tomeny, 31, wounded Staff Sergeant Stephen Phelps, 25, and detained civilian volunteer Charles Leiber. While on patrol, Deputy Butler pulled over the three exercise participants when he determined that their behavior indicated they might be searching for robbery targets. Once stopped, Leiber (the driver of the pick-up truck) was led by Butler to Butler's patrol cruiser for questioning. After leaving Leiber in his patrol car, Butler led Tomeny from the pick-up passenger seat to the truck bed where Phelps had been riding. Butler wished to inspect a bag that Tomeny was in possession of which contained Tomeny's M4 service rifle. Butler later admitted that he had no knowledge of the weapon at this point, as the compartment containing the gun remained unopened. At this point, the soldiers, under the assumption that Butler was aware of the ongoing Robin Sage training, attempted to bribe him with \\"Don\\" (Pineland currency), which looks similar to Monopoly money. Butler then tussled with Tomeny for the bag, pushed Tomeny away, then threw the bag to the side. Tomeny then backed up and raised his hands, and, according to court documents, \\"Tomeny [...] did not bump Butler or reach for Butler‚Äôs service weapon.\\" Butler then reholstered his service pistol and then \\"sprayed Tomeny in the eyes with pepper spray until the pepper spray appeared to run out,\\" which caused Tomeny to scream and rub his eyes with his hands. Phelps then moved from his position in the pick-up truck's bed, grabbed the bag with Tomeny's M4 service rifle, and ran for cover in the direction of the woods. Deputy Butler then shot Tomeny, turned, and shot the fleeing Phelps who had, after hearing the shots fired at Tomeny, turned suddenly, and due to the wet pavement slipped and fell to his hands and knees. Phelps at this point did not make any attempts to open the bag, and was shot by Butler twice. According to Butler's counsel he had warned Phelps to show his hands, but this was contested. Prior to the accident, there was confidence within the military establishment that the law enforcement community of North Carolina was well familiarized with the exercise. Press releases are now issued before an exercise commences and law enforcement officers who participate in the training are now required to wear a distinctive uniform. On 27 October 2009 a federal civil trial jury in Greensboro, North Carolina awarded $750,000 to Phelps after he sued Butler and the Moore County Sheriff's office. Tomeny's estate had previously settled out-of-court with the sheriff's office. Jurors said that they did not believe portions of Butler's testimony about what had occurred during the shooting incident. Butler sued the US Government for $5,000,000.00 for \\"emotional distress\\" and \\"post-traumatic stress disorder\\" as a result of shooting Tomeny and Phelps, which was summarily dismissed.https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS- ncmd-1_05-cv-01136/pdf/USCOURTS-ncmd-1_05-cv-01136-0.pdf  Phase VI (1 Week): Graduation  Phase 6 is the final phase and consists of one week of out processing, the Regimental First Formation where students don their green berets for the first time, and the graduation ceremony.  Further training  After successfully completing the Special Forces Qualification Course, Special Forces soldiers are then eligible for many advanced skills courses. These include, but are not limited to, the Military Free Fall Parachutist Course (MFF) (this is now a requirement for all members of the Special Forces), the Combat Diver Qualification Course and the Special Forces Sniper Course (formerly known as the Special Operations Target Interdiction Course). All Special Forces soldiers conduct real world, non-combat operations in order to maintain their skills. Special Forces Medical Sergeants (18D) often work in both military and civilian Emergency Rooms in between deployments. Additionally, because one of the Special Forces soldier's primary mission is the instruction of other forces, they participate extensively in special operations training courses offered by other services and allied nations throughout their careers.

In addition to being a neighborhood high school, Kelvyn Park also serves as a middle school; serving grades seventh and eighth. As of 2015, Kelvyn Park has a graduation rate of 52.1 percent. History Kelvyn Park began as an elementary school in 1918. Before that time, the land contained 19 portable units that were connected to Nixon Elementary School. In 1925, a junior high school was organized in the building to relieve pressure at Carl Schurz High School, which was overcrowded at the time. In 1927, some of the Kelvyn Park elementary students were phased-out to the newly constructed Barry Elementary School. In 1933, Kelvyn Park became a high school; however, elementary students remained until 1936. From its opening, the school had been predominantly populated by Whites; with the overflow of Hispanics migrating into the neighborhood in the early 1970s, the school's Hispanic population increased from 11% to 59% by 1978. Kelvyn Park High has been converted into a 7‚Äì12 grade school to compensate for the loss of Ames Middle School which is being converted into the Marine Math and Science Academy. The conversion of Ames is considered controversial among community stakeholders and is currently being contested.

Headquartered in South Beloit, IL, it is a private label snack food manufacturer and the maker of Pajeda's snacks. History Eugene \\"Mac\\" McCleary graduated with a degree in Chemical Engineering from Michigan State University class of 1942. He enlisted in the Navy during World War II and was stationed in Beloit, WI, where he was head of government inspection for submarine engines being built at Fairbanks Morse. After the war, Mac was offered a job at Adams Corporation, a fledgling company formed to manufacture and distribute the Korn Kurl, a new snack food that was invented on a local dairy farm. Mac worked with Adams Corporation for 15 years as their Director of Manufacturing and was instrumental in the development of continuous production of this new snack food. Mac started his own private label snack food company on November 22, 1960, and called it McCleary Industries, which would later be renamed to McCleary, Inc. and then Axium Foods, Inc. In the year 2000, Axium Foods created Pajeda's, its first branded line of tortilla chips and snacks. In 2010, Pajeda's introduced Fiesta Crunch, a line of tortilla chips and potato poppers. In November 2010, Axium Foods celebrated 50 years in business. Mac McCleary died in 2007, but the company remains family-owned and operated. In March 2012, Axium Foods introduced the brand Mystic Harvest, including tortilla chips made with purple corn. Environmental sustainability Axium Foods has a full wastewater treatment plant that includes an anaerobic digester. That process creates methane gas, and while the company currently flares that gas, it is exploring ways to recapture it and/or generate electricity with it.

The first installation occurred in 1960. A total of 89 were delivered. The H-800 design was part of a family of 48-bit word, three-address instruction format computers that descended from the Datamatic 1000, which was a joint Honeywell and Raytheon project started in 1955. The 1800 and 1800-II were follow-on designs to the H-800.Mark Smotherman Paper about the Honeywell 800 Data The basic unit of data was a word of 48 bits. This could be divided in several ways: * 8 Alphanumeric characters of 6 bits each * 12 Hexadecimal or Decimal characters of 4 bits each * 16 Octal characters of 3 bits each * An instruction with four components of 12 bits each: the operation to be performed, and three memory addresses. Hardware The Honeywell 800 was a transistorized computer with core memory. Its processor used around 6000 discrete transistors and around 30,000 solid-state diodes.Eldon C. Hall, Journey to the Moon: The History of the Apollo Guidance Computer,AIAA, 1996, , page 32 The basic system had: * A Central Processor with 16 controlled input/output trunks * An Input/Output Control Center (IOCC) with control functions for: ** A card reader/punch, ** A high-speed printer ** Up to 4 magnetic tape units * A Control Memory of 256 special registers of 16 bits each * A Main memory containing 4 banks of 2048 words. Extra peripherals could be added running through additional controllers with a theoretical possibility of 56 tape units. Up to 12 more main memory banks could be added. A random access disc system with a capacity of 800 million alphanumeric characters could be added. Multiprogram control allowed up to 8 programs to be sharing the machine, each with its own set of 32 special registers. A Floating-Point Unit was optionally available. The 48 bit word allowed a seven bit exponent and 40 bit mantissa. So numbers between 10‚àí78 and 10+76 were possible and precision was 12 decimal places. If the customer did not buy the floating point unit, then floating point commands were implemented by software simulation. Peripheral devices included: high-density magnetic tapes, high- speed line printers, fast card and paper tape readers and punches to high- capacity random access magnetic disc memories, optical scanners, self- correcting orthoscanners and data communications devices.Company Sales Manual for the Honeywell 1800 Software Available software included: * ARGUS (Automatic Routine Generating and Updating System), an assembly language. * FACT (Fully Automatic Compiling Technique), a business compiler. * PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique), a project management system. * COP (Computer Optimization Package), a program testing system. * COBOL (COmmon Business Oriented Language), a compiler for the well known business programming language. * FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslator), a compiler, runtime package, and \\"load and go\\" OS for the scientific language compiler.

He was an art student at the University of Munich and began his career as a painter while still in Europe. His style has been compared to that of Claude Monet. In the 1880s, Raubicheck painted and sold many impressionist landscapes, many of which are scenes on the East End of Long Island. He also established himself during this time as an etcher of some renown. One of his works is in the permanent collection of the Parrish Art Museum in Southampton, New York and several appear in an edition of Washington Irving's Knickerbocker's History of New York, published in 1886 by the Grolier Club in New York. He was one of the creators of the official seal for the Grolier Club, which still hangs on the banner outside the club's E. 60th Street address in Manhattan. In 1892, he exhibited more than 40 paintings at the Fifth Avenue Auction House in New York under the management of William B. Norman and the E. W. Noyes Gallery in Boston, Massachusetts. These paintings were a result of three years' work in Bavaria, the Netherlands and Belgium. In the mid-1890s, he went to work as an etcher and illustrator for The New York Times and worked there until the paper moved from Park Row to midtown in 1906. He continued painting throughout the remainder of his life, which was spent in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Hartsdale, New York, in Westchester County.

It is sometimes referred to by its English common name, clinging aneilema, and in Yoruba, a language of West Africa, it may be referred to as ·∫πfƒ©ajija. Description and habit A. aequinoctiale is a perennial shrub, sometimes considered a herb, that may be scrambling or erect in habit. It can grow up to two metres in height. The leaves and their leaf-sheaths, arranged distichously on the stem, are pale green and covered in fine, hooked hairs that give a \\"sticky\\" feeling. Leaf shapes may be ovate or lanceolate to elliptic. Roots of the plant are fibrous and thin. The inflorescences are usually terminal, and the cincinni may be whorled, opposite, or alternate. The petals of A. aequinoctiale are bright yellow and grow as a single pair, with a third petal either absent or small and withered. The flowers are short-lived, opening daily from approximately 07:00 to 10:00 during the flowering season, which is September through June. The flowers may be perfect, possessing both male and female reproductive organs, or may be staminate only. The capsules are generally oblong to obovate, and seeds are brown. Natural habitat, cultivation, and uses A. aequinoctiale prefers moist, partially shaded areas, and often grows on forest margins and by streams, though it can also be found growing in grassland, farmland, and roadside scrub. It is widespread in several regions of West and East Africa, though it is reported as being more widely cultivated and made use of in Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya, Zanzibar, and Zimbabwe. Ungulates may graze on the plant in grassland areas, such as Kenya, though its main uses in Africa are medicinal, culinary, and domestic. In the Ondo regions of Nigeria, infants may be bathed in a wash made from the roots of A. aequinoctiale. In other regions, the roots may be used as feed for livestock, and leaves may be cooked like spinach. The plant may be used to relieve colds in Zanzibar, though throughout Africa, the roots serve many other medicinal purposes, being used to treat skin disorders, diseases of the eye, constipation, leprosy, kwashiorkor, and amenorrhoea. Its application is also believed to help children with osteomalacia to walk. Considerable research has confirmed that chimpanzees self-medicate with A. aequinoctiale by swallowing the leaves whole. Not normally a part of the chimpanzee's diet, this behaviour is most often witnessed during rainy seasons, when the animals are most likely to be afflicted with the parasitic nematodes Oesophagostomum stephanostomum and other species of parasitic worms. Examination of the faecal matter of chimpanzees shows that the whole-swallowed leaves remain intact, along with multiple expelled worms. In one dung sample, as many as 20 worms were found, along with 50 undigested leaves. The mechanism through which A. aequinoctiale causes these worms to be expelled from the primates is not yet fully established, though a common factor in the chimpanzee's whole-leaf swallowing of A. aequinoctiale and other plants is the presence of trichomes on the leaves. Trichomes not being easily digestible, the un-chewed and rough surfaces of the leaves are thought to help physically extract the worms from the intestines.

The doctrine is named for and associated with John Calvin, but is commonly found in the church fathers and is prominent in Augustine's Christology. This theological distinction is in contrast to scholastic Lutheran Christology. In the theology of Martin Luther Jesus Christ is omnipresent, not only his divine nature but also his human nature, this is because the two natures cannot be separated from one another, but are shared by the same individual (communicatio idiomatum). The Reformed, on the other hand, argued that \\"the Word is fully united to but never totally contained within the human nature and, therefore, even in the incarnation is to be conceived of as beyond or outside of (extra) the human nature.\\" For this reason, the Reformed argue that Christ cannot be present corporeally (bodily) in the Lord's supper, because he reigns bodily from heaven.

Supporters of this campaign believe that Canadian citizens feel that their government should play a leadership role in advancing issues such as human rights, social justice, democracy and environmental sustainability. The founder and coordinator of RightOnCanada.ca is Kathleen Ruff. She is the former director of the Court Challenges Program of Canada and the former director of the BC Human Rights Commission. Currently, she is the President of the Rotterdam Convention Alliance and is a senior advisor on human rights to the Rideau Institute. RightOnCanada.ca is an independent organization and does not receive government funding. The only funding it receives is from individual donors. It has purposefully not sought charitable tax status so that it is not restricted in its activism and lobbying activities. Holistic approach The campaign uses what is refers to as a holistic approach. Human rights and the environment are deeply interconnected and therefore these issues cannot be dealt with separately but as one. The campaign believes communities have a responsibility to care about human rights and should act as responsible stewards of the environment. Grass roots campaigning RightOnCanada.ca is a campaign that operates at the grass roots level by encouraging citizens to lobby the government through actions such as: * signing on to receive their action alerts and sending letters to MPs and the government. * raising public awareness of their website * donating to support the work of RightOnCanada.ca and its campaigns * volunteering to help with advocacy campaigns * sending in ideas for action campaigns Strategies RightOnCanada.ca's main approach to campaigning is to hold MPs accountable to Canadians. MPs who have relevant ministerial or critic responsibilities are specifically targeted and local citizen efforts are supported. The key idea is to empower Canadians who too often see their government‚Äôs policies dictated by non-accountable institutions such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. The goal of the campaign is foster an open democratic process and policies that put the well being of people and the planet first. War and Peace One of the main concerns of the RightOnCanada.ca campaign is militarization. Supporters of the campaign feel that the Canadian government is aligning the country with the United States's policies that are based increasingly on militarization and weaponry. This prevents Canada from being a leader in promoting human rights, democracy and a healthy environment.

Name and meaning  While mentioned in several primary sources, her name is only recorded in the Patria of Constantinople. The name is generally accepted as genuine, though Cyril Mango has raised some doubts in his works.Shah√Æd (1995), p. 390 Shah√Æd's Byzantium and the Arabs in the sixth century (1995) examines the implications of her name. Arabia appears to be a unique personal name, and she seems to have been named by her great aunt, Empress Theodora, as a show of gratitude to Arab phylarch Arethas. The poem In laudem Justini minoris (\\"In praise of the younger Justin\\") by Flavius Cresconius Corippus, a primary source for the coronation of her father, notes its difference from the conventional and respectable name of her mother,Shah√Æd (1995), pp. 318‚Äì322 indicating that it did sound strange even to a contemporary.Shah√Æd (1995), p. 392 The name would appear to have negative connotations, as the Arab people were mostly seen as barbarians by the Byzantines. Similarly embarrassing names for the women of an imperial family had resulted in renamings both before and after Arabia's lifetime, for instance the empresses Aelia Eudocia and Aelia Anastasia, whose original names (Athena√Øs and Ino) had pagan connotations. At the time however, the Byzantine Empire had a subject Arab population in the provinces of the Diocese of the East, a population that had undergone both Hellenization and Christianization. Thus \\"Arab\\" did not translate to \\"enemy\\" or \\"raider\\". For hostile peoples of Arab origin, the sources use the term \\"Saracens\\" instead. Shah√Æd speculates that the name may have something to do with the period of Arabia's birth. Corippus informs us that Arabia was a married woman when her father rose to the throne in 565. Assuming her to be at least twenty years old, Shah√Æd suggests that the name could have been chosen to please her great- aunt Theodora (d. 548), the wife of Justinian I (r. 527‚Äì565). Theodora was noted for her support of Monophysitism, while her husband was known for actively persecuting this religious faction. One of Theodora's allies and strong supporter of Monophysitism happened to be the Arab phylarch Al-Harith ibn Jabalah (Arethas) of the Ghassanids. Arabia may have been named in honor of this alliance, especially given Justin's and Sophia's own adherence to Monophysitism at the time.  Family  She married Baduarius, with whom she may have had a daughter, Firmina, attested in a single inscription dated to 564.Martindale, Jones & Morris (1992), pp. 102, 484 The phrasing of the inscription is obscure, containing a Greek word that could be seen as \\"Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒ∑ŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑\\" or \\"Œ≥ŒµŒΩœåŒºŒµŒΩŒ∑\\" of Arabia. \\"Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒ∑ŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑\\" means \\"born of\\" and would make the phrase read \\"Firmina, daughter of Arabia\\", whilst \\"Œ≥ŒµŒΩœåŒºŒµŒΩŒ∑\\" means \\"who became\\". Cyril Mango reads the phrase as \\"Firmina who became the nursemaid of Arabia\\".Shah√Æd (1995), p. 319 Arabia is recorded by Corippus in his poem praying with her mother on 14 November 565: \\"At her holy side went her beautiful daughter, who could outdo the full moon with her own light, the equal of her mother in height, as shining in her appearance, as beautiful with her snowy cheeks. Her eyes blaze with fire, like her mother's\\".Shah√Æd (1995), pp. 321‚Äì322 She was depicted in a statue at the Milion; another was possibly placed at the harbour of Sophianae.Janin (1950), p. 104Shah√Æd (1995), p. 322  Religious account  A hagiography of Simeon Stylites the Younger claims that Arabia suffered from demonic possession during the reign of her father, and was cured by the saint.Shah√Æd (1995), p. 320  Sources    References  Category:Justinian dynasty Category:6th-century Byzantine people Category:Daughters of Byzantine emperors Category:6th-century Byzantine women ","title":"Arabia (daughter of Justin II)"},{"id":"26530472","text":"Svein Gunnar Morgenlien (13 May 1922 ‚Äì 22 September 2016) was a Norwegian trade unionist and politician for the Labour Party.

Born in New Jersey, Lewis and a friend, Lucius Allen, traveled across the continent in 1851 to open a dry goods and grocery store in what was then a frontier town of about 800 people living along the west bank of the Willamette River. By 1880, their firm, Allen & Lewis, had become one of the leading wholesale grocery companies on the West Coast. Supporting transportation projects that affected his business, he was a member of the Portland River Channel Improvement Committee in the 1860s, invested in the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company in the 1870s, and was appointed to the original Port of Portland Commission in the 1890s. He helped form a local subscription library in the 1860s, and he was named to the city's first water board in the 1880s. Married to Clementine Couch, daughter of another prominent Portland pioneer, Lewis fathered 11 children and after 1881 lived in a large, elegantly furnished house within walking distance of his office. He spent most of his time at work or at home, and had few other interests aside from church and charitable donations. He died in 1897 while walking to work on a Saturday afternoon. Early life Born in 1826 in Cranbury, New Jersey, Lewis moved with his parents at age 13 to Newburgh, New York. At age 20, he went to New York City to work in the dry-goods business of Chambers, Heiser & Company.Gaston, pp. 106‚Äì09 Merchant-entrepreneur John DeWitt, a New York merchant, hired Lewis in 1851 to assist DeWitt's son-in-law, Lucius Allen, in running a wholesale supply house in Portland, a frontier settlement on the West Coast.MacColl, Merchants, pp. 31‚Äì33 Portland, with a population of about 800, was in good position to trade via the Willamette and Columbia rivers and the Pacific Ocean with San Francisco and other ports and by land with an increasing number of pioneer farmers in the Willamette Valley. Allen, a friend of Lewis, had tried and failed in 1850 to establish a Portland branch store, and DeWitt thought that the more experienced Lewis would be able to help. In 1883 after several setbacks, the two men opened their own business (independent of New York) in a rented store at Front and \\"B\\" (Burnside) streets. They specialized in dry goods and groceries, building customer loyalty by selling at a fixed price, extending credit to reliable customers, and offering free space in their safe for storage of their customers' gold. By 1860, Allen had moved to San Francisco, a seaport city about south of Portland, where the company bought most of its supplies. He became a silent partner, uninvolved in day-to-day management. By then the firm of Allen & Lewis had begun to focus on wholesale markets, and by 1880, it was one of the leading wholesale grocery firms on the West Coast. Lewis and three contemporaries, Henry W. Corbett, William S. Ladd, and Henry Failing, who arrived in Portland in 1851 and set up businesses along Front Street,MacColl, Merchants, p. 20 became \\"merchant princes of the Northwest\\". > Within 10 years, this group of dedicated Front Street merchants and their > families would dominate the economic, political and social life of Portland. > All became warm and lasting friends with Ladd, the former teacher and > railroad agent, first among equals... With Benjamin Stark and John H. Couch, > who became Lewis's father-in-law, they formed Portland's earliest > Establishment, one of merchant-entrepreneurs. In 1864, these four merchants and others formed the Portland River Channel Improvement Committee, to raise money to make the Willamette shipping channel more easily navigable. This led to a federally funded project by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which dredged the channel in 1866.MacColl, Merchants, p. 154 In 1891, Lewis was named to the original Port of Portland Commission, established by the Oregon Legislative Assembly to oversee the maritime commercial and shipping interests of the city.MacColl, Shaping, p. 421 When railroads began replacing steamships as a shipping method in the 1870s, Lewis, Ladd, Corbett, Failing, and Simeon Reed (a Portland transportation executive), became the five largest stockholders, aside from Henry Villard, in Villard's Oregon Railway and Navigation Company (OR&N;).MacColl, Shaping, pp. 42‚Äì44 In 1888, Lewis was part of a group that visited Villard in New York to negotiate favorable shipping rates on the Union Pacific and the Northern Pacific railroads, with which Villard and the OR&N; had contracts affecting Portland.MacColl, Shaping, p. 46 Lewis's interest in Portland railroads extended to the Portland & Willamette Valley Railroad, of which he became a local director in 1885, and which was controlled and formally taken over by the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1890.MacColl, Shaping, pp. 70‚Äì73 Lewis and the other three pioneer merchants were among those in 1864 who formed the Mercantile Library Association (later renamed the Library Association of Portland) to establish a local subscription library. Roughly 30 years later, after a public library opened in Portland in 1891, members of the Cicero Lewis family were among its largest donors.MacColl, Merchants, pp. 194‚Äì96 In 1885, Lewis was one of 15 men named to the Portland Water Committee, empowered by the state legislature to acquire and operate a municipal water system for the city.MacColl, Merchants, p. 246 Family, other interests, death In 1857 Lewis married Clementine Couch, daughter of John H. Couch, a sea captain and early Portland settler. Unlike many of his friends, Lewis developed few interests beyond his business. His only form of recreation was walking to work, and although he was a charter member of the Arlington Club and could have dined there, he usually walked home for lunch. Historian E. Kimbark MacColl writes that Lewis \\"spent his life at his desk and never went out in the evening for entertainment or the theater... He was never known to have taken a pleasure trip, spending what remaining leisure time he had with his wife and 11 children.\\"MacColl, Shaping, pp. 26‚Äì29 Lewis died of a stroke in 1897 while walking back to work on a Saturday afternoon. Lewis was a member of the Episcopal ChurchMacColl, Merchants, p. 312 and a Mason.MacColl, Merchants, p. 189 He was one of the largest supporters of Good Samaritan Hospital and Trinity Episcopal Church in Portland. After Lewis died, his wife funded a hospital addition named in his honor at Good Samaritan. The Lewis family lived in a house on Fourth and Everett streets until 1881, when they built a large house on a lot in the Couch tract in northwest Portland. The tract, consisting of half of the block between 19th and 20th streets and Everett and Flanders streets, was owned by Mary Couch, Clementine's sister, and was developed by other members of the Couch family. The project consisted of four houses, each on a lot wide and long.Marlitt, pp. 29 and 58‚Äì65 The Lewis property, facing 19th Street, included stables, a greenhouse, and a sweeping drive leading to a carriage porch. Their very large house was built in a stick style that was \\"rather simple for its period\\", but its interior featured tall windows, a massive staircase, front and rear parlors, a reception room with a marble fireplace, and tall mirrors in elaborate frames, as well as \\"rare woods, marble mantels, brocaded walls [and] fine lighting fixtures\\" throughout. The four houses on the Couch tract were demolished in the 1960s. Notes and references Notes References Works cited *Gaston, Joseph (1911).

August 20, 1349) was Lord Chancellor of England, the first layman to hold the post. Family Robert Bourchier was the eldest son of John de Bourchier (d.circa 1330) (alias Boucher, Boussier, etc.), a Judge of the Common Pleas, by his wife Helen of Colchester, daughter and heir of Walter of ColchesterCharles Mosley, editor, Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, 107th edition, 3 volumes (Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003), volume 1, page 355 of Stanstead Hall, in Halstead, Essex. The Bourchier family seat became the estate of Stanstead (not to be confused with nearby Stansted Mountfitchet) in the parish of Halstead, Essex, in which county the family later acquired several estates. Life Robert initially followed his father in working for the de Vere family, Earls of Oxford, but later worked for the crown. He served on a diplomatic mission to France in 1327 and was returned as a member of parliament for the county of Essex in 1328-9, 1330 (twice), 1332 (once), and 1339 (both). He held a number of judicial positions, despite no evidence for legal training (although likely), and in 1334 he was chief justice of the king's bench in Ireland, but never took up office. His military career was more active, joining the invasion of Scotland in 1335, was stated to have been present at the Battle of Cadsand in 1337 (although this is regarded by some as a translation error by his descendant John Bouchier) and travelled with Earl of Northampton on Edward III's expedition to Flanders in 1338. On 3 June 1341 he received, in the name of Robertus Bourghchier, Stanstede, a royal licence to crenellate his house at Stanstead in the parish of Halstead in Essex. On his return to England, the king Edward III committed the great seal, which had been alternating between Archbishop John de Stratford and his brother Robert de Stratford, the Bishop of Chichester, to Bourchier, who thus became, on 14 December 1340, the first lay chancellor. His salary was fixed at ¬£100,according to Dictionary of National Biography, although Cokayne et al puts it at ¬£500 besides the usual fees. In the struggle between the king and the archbishop, Bourchier withheld the writ of summons to the ex-chancellor, interrupted his address to the bishops in the Painted Chamber, and on 27 April 1341 urged him to submit to the king. When the parliament of 1341 extorted from the king his assent to their petitions that the account of the royal officers should be audited, and that the chancellor and other great officers should be nominated in parliament, and should swear to obey the laws, Bourchier declared that he had not assented to these articles, and would not be bound by them, as they were contrary to his oath and to the laws of the realm. He nevertheless exemplified the statute, and delivered it to parliament. He resigned his office on 29 October 1341. Robert continued to serve in the King's Council, as a diplomat and as a soldier. In 1342, he commanded a contingent in Brittany, and is recorded as being at the Battle of Cr√©cy in 1346. He was summoned to parliament as a peer in November 1348 and from then was known as Lord Bourchier (or Burgchier). He died the following year, of the Black Death in Bordeaux, while on a diplomatic mission to Castile with Joan of England, who died shortly after him. He was later buried at Halstead, where he had intended to found a college of eight chaplains.

The most important part of his career was spent in Portugal, although he mainly represented local Celta de Vigo. He died at only 34. Club career Born in Vigo, Province of Pontevedra, P√©rez started his professional career with hometown club Celta de Vigo. His stay, however, would not be a productive one, as he only managed 16 first-team appearances for the Galicians during his first three seasons combined. From 1994 to 1996, P√©rez appeared slightly more, but never established himself as an important member of the main squad, being subsequently loaned to UD Almer√≠a from Segunda Divisi√≥n: he played the most he had in years, but suffered relegation. Upon his return to Celta, he made no La Liga appearances whatsoever and was released. P√©rez then took his game to Iberian Peninsula neighbours Portugal, first with G.D. Chaves. After one Primeira Liga campaign where he scored a career-best four goals (albeit with relegation), he joined another side in the north, Vit√≥ria de Guimar√£es. In the summer of 2001, P√©rez signed with second level team C.D. Nacional, helping them promote in his debut campaign (19 matches, two goals).

Liberals have long proposed such privatization. The Market for Liberty, published in 1970, stated that \\"as companies drilling for off-shore oil have proved, there is no reason why a piece of land cannot be owned and used simply because it is covered by water.\\" In proposing privatization, Walter Block stated that \\"there are vast areas of human existence where private property rights play no role at all: oceans, seas, rivers and other bodies of water. But why should we expect that there would be any better results from such 'water socialism' than we have experienced from socialism on land?\\" Murray Rothbard's For a New Liberty likewise notes, \\"Anyone can capture fish in the ocean, or extract its resources, but only on the run, only as hunters and gatherers. No one can farm the ocean, no one can engage in aquaculture. In this way we are deprived of the use of the immense fish and mineral resources of the seas...Even now there is a simple but effective technique that could be used for increasing fish productivity: parts of the ocean could be fenced off electronically, and through this readily available electronic fencing, fish could be segregated by size. By preventing big fish from eating smaller fish, the production of fish could be increased enormously.\\" Mary Ruwart's Healing Our World states, \\"Owners would also be more likely to invest in artificial reefs to bolster the fish population. Whalers could operate only with the permission of the owners, much as hunters must request permission to stalk deer on privately owned land. Ocean owners profit most by making sure that the valuable species in their region are not hunted to extinction.\\" Much as ownership of land also, under the common law, included ownership of all the airspace above him upward indefinitely unto the heavens and downward into the center of the earth, and causing polluted air to enter another person's airspace would constitute aggression, causing polluted water to enter waters owned by another person would constitute aggression that would be legally treated as such, under an anarcho-capitalist system. In 2009 George Mason University professor Peter T. Leeson has suggested that ocean privatization could help combat Somalian piracy. R≈°gnvaldur Hannesson's book The Privatization of the Oceans argues that privatization will help alleviate the tragedy of the commons. Donald R. Leal's Let's Homestead the Oceans argues that regulation has failed and that individual transferable quotas, which guarantee each fisher a specific share of the total allowable catch before the season begins, should be established, or preferably, fullfledged property rights either to fishing areas or to the fish themselves should be created. The article argues that the more secure the property rights, the healthier fish populations and fishing communities will be. Some questions that arise in reference to water privatization are what areas are to be privatized exactly; how it can be ensured that the general public interest is not corrupted by private corporations acting alone or with government collusion to destroy these once-public resources; what would be a fair price to privatize oceanic tracts; how to hand over title to private firms to manage water resources; and how to manage any future transfers from one private institution to another.

The monument was designed by J√≥zef Gos≈Çawski.\\\\  History  The first monument erected by Poles in Gorz√≥w Wielkopolski was to be the Freedom Monument. At the end of 1945, the starosty laid the foundation stone and the erection act. Then the work was stopped. Ten years later, the manager of the Juliusz Osterwa Theatre, Leon Haegenbarth, proposed to commemorate Adam Mickiewicz, whose centenary of death was just being celebrated. The idea was supported by the Municipal National Council and the Social Building Committee was established. It was chaired by Dr. Edward Stapf. The Committee announced a fundraising in schools and workplaces. A tax of five pence in the price of tram tickets was also introduced in Gorz√≥w for this purpose. The project was prepared by the Pozna≈Ñ-based sculptor J√≥zef Gos≈Çawski, author of the Fryderyk Chopin monument in ≈ªelazowa Wola, among others. As the bronze turned out to be too expensive, the figure of the bard was made of cast iron. The cast was produced by the Mechanical Plants \\"Gorz√≥w\\" (Polish: Zak≈Çady Mechaniczne \\"Gorz√≥w\\"). Funds for monument came from contributions of local society. In Gos≈Çawski's design, Mickiewicz held a pen in his left hand and a book in his right hand. Members of the Social Construction Committee decided that the pen should be removed and the left hand should point to the book. As a result, it is 20 cm longer than the right hand. The ceremonial unveiling of the monument took place on 15 December 1957. The Mickiewicz monument has permanently inscribed itself in the panorama of Gorz√≥w Wielkopolski, but for the following decades it did not evoke much emotion. It was remembered in 2008 on the occasion of the European Football Championship, to which the Polish team was promoted for the first time in history. It was then included in the social campaign \\"In Poland even monuments cheer for ours\\". Mickiewicz was then dressed in a white and red T-shirt of the Polish national team. Once again, the monument became famous when, due to the Sikorski Street reconstruction project, the City Council had to give its consent to move it by 12 meters. So that it would not stand in the middle of the roundabout planned for its place. During the stormy debates, the issue that Mickiewicz's sculpture has one hand 20 cm longer and should be shortened on that occasion came back. Controversy was also aroused by the fact that the displaced monument may stand backwards to the nearby J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski monument on Kasztanka. Ultimately, it was decided that Mickiewicz's sculpture would not be reworked and would take an exposed place, without colliding with Pi≈Çsudski's monument. The whole operation is still in the sphere of plans.  Contemporary importance  The Adam Mickiewicz monument was the first Polish monument erected in Gorz√≥w Wielkopolski. At the same time, the first monument of the poet in the Zielona G√≥ra Province and the second in the Western Territories. Despite its precursor, its role as a place of remembrance was for a long time unknown and only of local significance. The ceremonies were usually organized at the site occasionally, in connection with the anniversaries of the poet's birth or death. The monument remained present in tourist guides, but it is difficult to speak of its special distinction as an attraction for visitors. It was only the need to move and the discussion of this project by the local authorities and in the regional media that animated public interest in the monument. And school students from the Secondary School in Gorz√≥w started to organize happenings at Mickiewicz Street to symbolize, among other things, the moving of the monument.

Principle  Bacteria are inoculated on a medium containing sodium citrate and a pH indicator such as bromothymol blue. The medium also contains inorganic ammonium salts, which are utilized as sole source of nitrogen. Use of citrate involves the enzyme citrase, which breaks down citrate to oxaloacetate and acetate. Oxaloacetate is further broken down to pyruvate and carbon dioxide (CO2). Production of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) as well as ammonia (NH3) from the use of sodium citrate and ammonium salts results in alkaline pH. This results in a change of the medium's color from green to blue. Bacterial colonies are picked up from a straight wire and inoculated into slope of Simmons citrate agar and incubated overnight at 37 ¬∞C. If the organism has the ability to use citrate, the medium changes its color from green to blue. Examples: * Escherichia coli: Negative * Klebsiella pneumoniae: Positive * Frateuria aurantia: Positive  Method  Inoculate Simmons citrate agar (do not inoculate heavily) by using straight wire from an 18- to 24-hour old colony. Inoculating from a broth culture is not recommended because the inoculum would be too heavy. Incubate at 35 ¬∞C for up to seven days.  Results  Positive : Growth on the medium even without colour change will be considered as positive. A colour change in the medium would be observed if the test organism produces acid or alkali during its growth. The usual colour change observed is from green (neutral) to blue (alkaline). Negative : No growth observed.

SEC chairman, Mary Schapiro, indicated that the agency was trying to determine whether other companies used similar techniques as the \\"repo 105\\" used by Lehman Brothers.

She was best known for her appearances in 1950s cabarets, where she sang soprano. In 1965, she portrayed the cantankerous Sister Berthe in the film version of The Sound of Music; she also had a minor role as Sarah in the musical Doctor Dolittle; on TV's All My Children Nelson played the long-running role of nanny Mrs. Gurney. Her book of poetic musings, There's a Hole in My Sidewalk: The Romance of Self-Discovery, became a mainstay of twelve-step programs.Obituary, \\"Portia Nelson, 80, Songwriter and Club Performer,\\" Stephen Holden, New York Times, Mar. 10, 2001 Early life and education Nelson was born in Brigham City, Utah on May 27, 1920 and was the youngest of nine children. (The Danish family name of Nielsen had been anglicized before her birth.) Her Mormon family owned a farm; her father was also a railroad worker. At a young age, Nelson taught herself to play piano; after two years at Weber College in Ogden, Utah she quit school and moved to Los Angeles. Early career While attending an LDS Church service in L.A. in 1945, Nelson met the King Sisters, the popular swing-era vocal quartet, also from Utah. The sisters were employed by bandleader Alvino Rey; and since Nelson needed a job, they hired her to come on the road as their secretary. In the months that followed, she took one of her first steps as a musician by writing a few vocal arrangements for the group. Back home in Los Angeles in early 1946, Nelson worked briefly as secretary to film director Andr√© de Toth; she held another secretarial job in the publicity department of United Artists Pictures. Around that time she adopted the name Portia, a nickname that friends gave her based on her love of the popular radio soap opera Portia Faces Life. She was known for occasionally sitting at pianos on the lot and demonstrating songs, and word of her vocal talents spread. Jane Russell was then on the lot making a film, Young Widow; one day they talked about songs they both liked, and Nelson performed one at the piano. \\"What the hell are you doing pounding a typewriter? ... You should be singing,\\" said Russell.Portia Nelson interview for James Gavin's book Intimate Nights: The Golden Age of New York Cabaret (New York: BackStage Books, 2006), June 27, 1985 Nelson would later work for Russell as a vocal coach. After Nelson's death, Russell said that she \\"had a high, clear voice, with such intonation and shading! Her lyrics were sung with such understanding that you felt you'd heard a poem sung.\\"Portia Nelson obituary, by Tom Vallance, The Independent (UK), March 14, 2001. Through Ida Lupino, Nelson met Nick Arden, a lyricist who was planning to open a small nightclub in Sherman Oaks, California. She and Arden teamed to write a song, \\"It's as Simple as That.\\" Nelson recorded the demo, which reached the hands of singer Jo Stafford; on October 18, 1946, Stafford recorded the ballad for Capitol as the B-side of \\"September Song.\\" The disc didn't chart, but once his nightclub had opened Arden hired Nelson to make her debut there as a singer. Her accompanist was Walter Gross, a former staff pianist at CBS radio and the composer of a standard written that year, \\"Tenderly\\". Early cabaret work After leaving Nick Arden's, Nelson continued to work day jobs, while singing sporadically. In 1949 she performed at the Caf√© Gala, a cabaret on Hollywood's Sunset Strip; singer-pianist Bobby Short entertained. Recalled Short in his 1995 autobiography Bobby Short: The Life and Times of a Saloon Singer: \\"Portia walked onto the floor of the Gala, tall, poised, goddesslike in floating chiffon ‚Äì and singing in a way that was all her own. She was a smash.\\"New York: Potter, 1995, p.116 It was at the Caf√© Gala that Nelson was heard by Herbert Jacoby, the owner (with Max Gordon) of Manhattan's preeminent cabaret, the Blue Angel. Jacoby invited her to sing there. In January 1950, Nelson moved to New York; soon after she was performing on one of the Blue Angel's four-act bills. She would sing there on and off until 1959, sharing rosters with Carol Channing, Pearl Bailey, Imogene Coca, Orson Bean, Wally Cox, Harry Belafonte, Johnny Mathis, and other budding stars. Nelson sometimes performed in the front lounge, where her accompanist was William Roy, a young pianist and composer who was just beginning a fifty-year career as a musical director for many of cabaret's greatest performers. In 1951 Nelson would also appear at the New York lounge Celeste, accompanied by songwriter and pianist Bart Howard, who soon became the emcee at the Blue Angel. At Celeste, Nelson performed many of the songs (including \\"In Other Words,\\" later retitled \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\") that she would gather on her album Let Me Love You: Portia Nelson Sings the Songs of Bart Howard. She championed Howard for the rest of her career. The singer had made an auspicious recorded debut with the album Love Songs for a Late Evening, released in 1953 by Columbia's Masterworks division, normally reserved for classical artists. The New Yorker reviewer Rogers Whitaker wrote in his liner notes: \\"One has only to hear the delicate phrasing and effortless command of melody to understand why she could immediately create such a stir.\\" Theater and other recordings Nelson was also a frequent participant in a series of recorded re-creations of classic musicals, produced by Columbia president and producer Goddard Lieberson. The singer was heard on Roberta, The Boys from Syracuse, On Your Toes, and Oklahoma! A recording of No√´l Coward's Bitter Sweet, which featured Nelson and singer Robert Rounseville, remains unissued; according to Nelson, its release was nixed by Coward, who disapproved of it.Portia Nelson, June 27, 1985 interview for James Gavin's book, Intimate Nights: The Golden Age of New York Cabaret (NYC: BackStage Books, 2006) Her other early recorded work include the 1956 album, Autumn Leaves (on the Dolphin label); she wrote arrangements for the album Stritch by Elaine Stritch, released on Dolphin in 1956. In 1954, Nelson originated the role of Miss Minerva Oliver in The Golden Apple, John Latouche's musical adaptation of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey. The Golden Apple opened off-Broadway at the Phoenix Theatre, then moved to Broadway's Alvin Theatre, where it ran from April through August. In 1955, she contributed material to the Broadway review Almost Crazy, which lasted just 16 performances. She continued to sing at the Blue Angel and other cabarets, including New York's Bon Soir and Downstairs at the Upstairs, the Colony in London, and Bricktop's in Rome. In 1959, she began hosting her own musical radio show, Sunday in New York, produced by Allen Ludden. Tracks from the series would later comprise Nelson's 1994 CD, Sunday in New York, released on the Lockett-Palmer label. Los Angeles Her cabaret career, like the scene itself, was starting to wane, and in 1960 Nelson moved to Los Angeles. There she maintained a dual career as a writer of special musical material (for Carol Burnett, Debbie Reynolds, Marlene Dietrich, Julie Andrews, and others) and as vocal coach to such actors as Rod Steiger. She also became an actress who specialized, inadvertently, in roles of nuns. In The Sound of Music (1965), Nelson played Sister Berthe, who saved the von Trapp family in pre- World War II Austria by sabotaging a Nazi car. Nelson uttered the memorable line, \\"Reverend Mother, I have sinned.\\" The next year she appeared as Sister Elizabeth in the film comedy The Trouble with Angels. In 1967 Nelson appeared as Sister Benedict on the TV western The Big Valley in the episode titled \\"Days of Grace.\\" She appeared in the movie Doctor Dolittle and worked as consulting producer and writer for the 1969 TV special, Debbie Reynolds and the Sound of Children. During her L.A. years, Nelson studied painting with celebrity portraitist and art teacher Richard McKenzie, who was Fred Astaire's son-in-law and who owned an art gallery in Beverly Hills. In honor of Nelson's repeated castings as a nun, the gallery hosted an exhibition of nun paintings by Nelson and other artists. When her friend Rock Hudson was preparing to record his first and only album, Rock, Gently: Rock Hudson Sings the Songs of Rod McKuen (on the Stanyan label) in 1970, Nelson coached the actor vocally.Obituary, \\"Portia Nelson, 80, Songwriter and Club Performer,\\" Stephen Holden, New York Times, Mar. 10, 2001 Another friend, the actor, screenwriter, and novelist Tom Tryon, cast her as the busybody Mrs. Rowe in the 1972 film version of his thriller novel, The Other. New York In the 1960s Nelson had sung little; her only album of that decade, Picadilly Pickle: Lady Nelson and the Lords, was a rock-and-roll spoof on which Nelson played Vox organ and didn't sing. Around 1971, she returned to New York and made a rare cabaret appearance at the short-lived club Mary Mary, owned by singer-actress Mary McCarty. In 1976, with a cabaret renaissance underway in New York and other cities, Nelson made her official singing comeback with an engagement at the Manhattan club Brothers & Sisters; thereafter she sang at other New York clubs (The Ballroom, Ted Hook's OnStage, Freddy's Supper Club) and at the Mocambo in San Francisco. Reviewing her appearance at The Ballroom, Rex Reed wrote: \\"With silver hair rising to a peak atop sleek chiffon and mile-long pearls, Miss Nelson is as graceful and refined to observe as she is to listen to.\\"New York Daily News, Nov. 10, 1978 Acting work, 1970s-1980s From May through November 1976, Nelson played the small role of Therese, a spinster, in the touring company of The Baker's Wife, a musical by Stephen Schwartz and Joseph Stein. The show was Broadway-bound, but closed in Washington, D.C. before its New York opening. Nelson continued to act, taking on roles in the soap operas The Doctors and All My Children (in which she played the recurring role of nanny Rachel Gurney) and appearing on numerous TV commercials. She was also seen on an episode of the sitcom Chico and the Man and in the movie Can't Stop the Music (1980), which starred the Village People. Writing Nelson was a cancer survivor, having conquered breast cancer after a mastectomy in 1973.Marian Zailian, \\"The Bittersweet Lady of the Supper Clubs Is Back,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, Oct. 9, 1977 Four years later, Popular Library published Nelson's milestone book, There's a Hole in My Sidewalk: The Romance of Self- Discovery. (Beyond Words Publishing reissued it in 1993.) Its cover appears on a poster displayed in the office of Sean McGuire, the fictional psychologist portrayed by Robin Williams in the film Good Will Hunting (1997). Nelson turned the book into an off-Broadway musical, presented at the York Theatre in Manhattan. One of her poems, \\"Autobiography in Five Short Chapters\\", went on to become a highly popular self-help and recovery text: _Chapter I_ I walk down the street. :There is a deep hole in the sidewalk. ::I fall in. :::I am lost ... I am helpless. ::::It isn't my fault. It takes me forever to find a way out. _Chapter II_ I walk down the same street. :There is a deep hole in the sidewalk. ::I pretend I don't see it. :::I fall in again. I can't believe I am in the same place. ::::But it isn't my fault. It still takes a long time to get out. _Chapter III_ I walk down the same street. :There is a deep hole in the sidewalk. ::I see it is there. :::I still fall in ... it's a habit. ::::My eyes are open. :::::I know where I am. It is my fault. I get out immediately. _Chapter IV_ I walk down the same street. :There is a deep hole in the sidewalk. ::I walk around it. _Chapter V_ I walk down another street. The poem (which was often uncredited to Nelson) was adopted by motivational speakers and reprinted in The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying by Sogyal Rinpoche,New York: HarperOne, 1994 as well as in the foreword of TV actress Roseanne Barr's autobiography, My Lives.New York: Ballantine Books, 1994 Jazz singer Dianne Reeves set the poem to music and recorded it as \\"The First Five Chapters\\" on her live CD In the Moment (2000). Later life and death In the early 1990s, a bout with throat and tongue cancer ‚Äì which Nelson, who never smoked, blamed on her years of singing in smoky nightclubs ‚Äì robbed her of her soprano voice.Patricia O'Haire, \\"Her 'Rainbow' Song Shines for Bill\\", New York Daily News, January 21, 1993. Within a couple of years she had resumed singing in a low, husky speech-song style, while devoting more attention to her songwriting. By the end of her career Nelson had written hundreds of songs, as well as scores for various book musicals and animated films. All went unproduced, but Nelson was lavished with accolades for her accomplishments. In October 1992, the Mabel Mercer Foundation honored her with its Premier Cabaret Classic Award. On January 20, 1993, at the inauguration of President Bill Clinton, the mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne, a close friend of hers, sang the song that would become Nelson's trademark, \\"Make a Rainbow\\". Nelson had written it in the 1960s and dedicated it to Horne's bi-racial daughter Angela. In 1996, Nelson's \\"As I Remember Him\\" was voted Song of the Year by the Manhattan Association of Cabarets and Clubs (MAC). That same year, Backstage magazine honored her for lifetime achievement at its annual Bistro Awards. Also in 1996, DRG Records issued This Life, a CD of her original songs as sung by cabaret artists Margaret Whiting, Amanda McBroom, Ann Hampton Callaway, Deborah Tranelli, Nancy LaMott, and Nelson herself. DRG also reissued Nelson's three solo albums of the 1950s. In early 2001, she was honored at a MAC/ASCAP Songwriters' Showcase in New York; around that time she made her last appearance at a performance of a revue of her songs, This Life, at the New York cabaret Don't Tell Mama. By now her cancer had recurred, and the singer died in her apartment on March 6, 2001. At her request, Nelson's ashes were spread by friends and family at the Kolob Canyons in Utah's Zion National Park, one of her favorite childhood recreational spots.Interview with friend Lars Jahns, October 20, 2010 Also per her wishes, the singer's writings, photographs, recordings, press clippings, and personal memorabilia were donated to the New York Public Library to establish the Portia Nelson Archive at the Library for the Performing Arts in New York City.

Development and design Dmitri Lyudvigovich Tomashevich was the chief designer on the Polikarpov I-180 fighter before the crash of the prototype, killing test pilot Valery Chkalov, led to Tomashevich being arrested and sent to a NKVD-run Special Prison in January 1939, where he assisted Andrei Tupolev in the design of the Tupolev Tu-2. In August 1941, Tomashevich was evacuated to Omsk in Siberia where he was put in charge of his own design bureau. In 1942, inspired by the success of the simple Polikarpov Po-2 biplane as a night ground-attack aircraft, Tomashyevich was authorised to design and build a simple ground-attack aircraft that would be much more capable than the Po-2 but could be built at the same price. The resulting design was a low-wing monoplane with a fixed tail-wheel undercarriage, of wooden construction, with pine frames and birch plywood skins. The pilot sat in an open cockpit which was protected by mild- steel armour plating designed to withstand bullets. It was powered by two Shvetsov M-11F engines (the same powerplant used by the Po-2) and was armed with two cannon and a heavy machine gun in the nose, with the option of replacing the cannon with up to of bombs. An optional jettisonable upper wing was tested on the Pegas-01 prototype. The first prototype, Pegas-01, made its maiden flight in late 1942, proving to be overweight and underpowered, although the aircraft's handling was acceptable. It was hoped to test one of the prototypes at the Kursk front, but the distance from Omsk to the front line made that impractical, and development of the type was abandoned after four prototypes had been built.

He was known for publishing the Toleranzpatent (tolerance patent) meant to ensure equal rights for the Serbian Orthodox Church and the Catholic church in Sremski Karlovci. Biography Vasilije Putnik was born in 1728, in Novi Sad, at the time part of Kingdom of Hungary in the Habsburg Monarchy (modern Serbia). He was the grandson of Stevan Putnik, the dignity having been conferred in 1621 by Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor, to Stevan von Putnik for his services in the Imperial Guard Cavalry as a captain of the Military Frontier, known as Potiska Krajina (They were mainly bordermen from the Potiska and Pomoriaka border zones‚Äîknown as Kraine‚Äîin course of time these Serbs merged with the Cossacks, and partly with the Moldavians, who live in the southern part of Imperial Russia). Stefan died in 1622 in the Thirty Years' War, but his male heir attained the honour of knighthood. Coming from such an illustrious background meant that Vasilije Putnik received a thorough education that commenced in the primary and later Latin School in Novi Sad, the same school where Zaharije Orfelin taught two decades later. Vasilije Putnik went to the Lyc√©e of Novi Sad as a student of theology and philosophy, and soon thereafter he decided to take orders. He was then only seventeen. Young Vasilije took the monkish name of Mojsije (Moses) and began his clerical career. He was soon noticed by Arsenije IV Jovanoviƒá ≈†akabenta and was made a deacon. In the next few years he was elevated to the position of Archimandrite. Putnik was then entrusted to an important diplomatic mission to suppress the Uniates (Eastern Catholic Churches) who were propagating their confession in one of the Orthodox dioceses. His mission was a success, as the correspondence kept in the Archiepiscopal Archives confirms, and he managed to persuade the local congregation that was forced to accept the Uniate Church to return to the Eastern Orthodox Church.For the correspondence between Archimandrite Mojsije Putnik from Veliki Varad and Archbishop Pavle Nenadoviƒá see the following documents kept in the Archiepiscopal Archives in Sremski Karlovci: B-1756-54 and B-1756-3. With all this in mind, Metropolitan Pavle Nenadoviƒá (1699‚Äì1768) proposed Putnik as the chief candidate for the Bishopric of Baƒçka, Szeged, and Eger. After a year of negotiations, Putnik was installed in Novi Sad on the sixth of June 1757. He was then, at the age of 29, the youngest ever Orthodox cleric to be raised to the episcopate. Here he soon did good service, and made himself remarkable not only for his magnanimity but the moral qualities indispensable for the office he held. He was responsible for inviting Jovan Rajiƒá to Novi Sad as well as other Serbian and Russian scholars. Mojsije Putnik remained in that position for eighteen years, and during that period he took particular care to improve the educational system of his diocese, which culminated in the foundation of its first seminary. His care for his faithful surpassed the usual efforts of Orthodox clergymen, which made his contemporaries write of him in terms of ideal bishop, vescovo ideale. During floods that gravely endangered Novi Sad in 1769 and 1770, members of his staff were seen dutifully helping people and saving lives. During those months Putnik regularly assisted the citizens of both Novi Sad and Petrovaradin with clothes, food and shelter. His congregation would have been happy to have elected him archbishop immediately after Metropolitan Pavle's death, but numerous intrigues developed during the sabors (assemblies) of 1769 and 1774 which prevented Putnik from taking the high office. After these, he was, at his own request, transferred to the post of Bishop of Banat. His congregation from Novi Sad was so desolate that on the day of his departure a large number of citizens, dressed in their finest clothes, \\"and driving their finest carriages and carts went to bid him farewell. They followed him as far as Beƒçej where they parted from him and kissed his hand and the hem of his robes.\\" While living in Timi»ôoara, Putnik became the first Orthodox bishop to whom Empress Maria Theresa (1717‚Äì1780) granted the prestigious title of Privy Councillor‚Äîan honour up to then reserved only for the highest prelates, indeed, patriarchs of the Orthodox Church in the Empire. He stayed in the diocese of Banat until 1782, when he was at last unanimously elected the Metropolitan of Sremski Karlovci. In 1783 Putnik was given further dioceses of Bukovina and Erdelj (not formerly under the protection of Metropolitanate of Karlovci). On the thirteenth of October 1784, Mojsije Putnik and three bishops in Sremski Karlovci ordained Bishop Petar I Petrovic-Njegos of Montenegro, the uncle of the great poet Njegos. Customarily, all Serb hierarchs in Montenegro went to the Serbian Patriarchate of Peƒá for their ordination, however, in 1766 all that changed. The Patriarch Vasilije Ivanoviƒá-Brkiƒá whom the Turks exiled, and placed a Phanariot Greek, Kalinik II, at the head of the Serbian Orthodox Church, who went on to abolish the Patriarchate of Peƒá altogether. After that it became necessary for the archimandrites of Montenegro to seek to be ordained bishops far from their mountain fastness in Sremski Karlovci (in the case of Petar I Petroviƒá-Njego≈°) and Imperial Russia (in the case of Petar II Petroviƒá Njego≈°). Mojsije continued his educational policies, and founded the first secondary school in the Military Frontier, better known as the Vojna Krajina, after a permission was received directly from Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1782. During the 1770s, Putnik was decorated by Empress Maria Theresa; and having received the Commander's cross with the image of Saint Stephen (the patron saint of Hungary) he was an enthusiastic partisan of Joseph II during his struggle with parliament.On 1 June 1784 Mojsije Putnik elevated a distinguished Serbian Orthodox monk and writer, Kiril Zhivkovich, to the rank of archimandrite before he was ordained Bishop of Pakrac two years later, on 20 June 1786. In 1787 Emperor Joseph II decided to launch a war against the Ottoman Empire. The Turks immediately took the military initiative, driving back the Austrians from Mehadia and overrunning the Banat (1789). The Austrians soon organized units of Serbian Freikorps who fought valiantly, deep inside the Turkish-controlled country, under Koƒça Andjelkoviƒá, and were able to establish Koƒça's frontier for a time. Many Serbs were present at the Siege of Belgrade (1789), led by General Ernst Gideon von Laudon, and participated in all of the actions against the Turks. While elsewhere the combined armies of Austria and Russia were carrying city after city, Joseph II died. In May 1790 Mojsije Putnik went to Vienna with the bishops of Temi»ôoara, Vr≈°ac, and Baƒçka to pay respects to the newly enthroned Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor (1747‚Äì1792). But the idea of distinct political nationhood among the Serbs living in Hungarian-occupied territories began to reveal itself. The years of cooperation with Austrian authorities proved a great disappointment. Sensing the current of the time, Putnik decided that a separate convention from the usual Ecclesiastical Sabor (Assembly) be convened. He decided that it was now an appropriate time to establish \\"a People's Congress\\" for the Serbs and Vlahs of Temi≈°var (Timi»ôoara) in particular and the Banat region in general. Unfortunately, Mojsije Putnik died at Vienna in June 1790 before the sabor met on the 21 August of the same year. The Temi≈°var Serb and Vlah Congress of 1790, to which the Serb parish priests, smallholders, burghers, high clergy and military leaders received an invitation, regarded ad hoc privileged positions as final. Albeit the Turkish occupation ended. On the basis of the existing situation, Frontier General Arsenije Secujac, backed by Serb military and the high clergy, demanded the establishment of a Serb- Illyrian chancellery. Sava Tekelija, a politician and a leader of the Serbs, was opposed to the military demands, advocated a peaceful compromise with the Hungarian authorities in the spirit of constitutionality. (The Vienna Royal Court, following its self-serving divisive policy towards the nationalities of the Danube region, found the creation of the Illyrian chancellery practicable for the time being). Undoubtedly, the list of his books supplies the most valuable information. In Putnik's library, theological literature abound, particularly Russian ecclesiastical works, and he owned a large nunmber of liturgical titles (books of psalms in several edition, catechisms, prayer books and books of hours). He also owned famous works such as \\"the Spiritual Alphabet\\" and \\"The Rock of Faith\\" by Russian theologian Stefan Javorski (1658‚Äì1722), the representative of the scholastic theology of the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, and the popular \\"Spiritual Regulations\\" of Peter the Great (written by Feofan Prokopovich), the work widely copied in the ecclesiastical reforms in the Archbishopric. Putnik was also versed in the works by universal authors that had a great influence in both the Eastern and Western Roman Empires, most notably \\"Meditations\\" by our St. Augustine and \\"Annales ecclesiastici\\" (Ecclesiastical Annals) by Caesar Baronius (1538‚Äì1607) in the Russian edition of Piotr Skarga. Putnik was also interested in Erasmus of Rotterdam and philosophical works by the German Jewish philosopher Moses Mendelssohn (1729‚Äì1786).

Jowo Rinpoche is housed in the Jokhang temple and Jowo Miky√∂ Dorje in the Ramoche temple in Lhasa. History The Jowo Rinpoche statue has a long history and is said to have been personally blessed by the Buddha. It came to be owned by the king of Magadha, who gave it to a Tang emperor of China. One of the emperor's clansman's daughter, Wenchen Kongjo took it to Lhasa via Lhagang in a wooden cart when she married King Songtsen Gampo. During Mangsong Mangtsen's reign (649-676), because of a threat that the Tang Chinese might invade, Princess Wencheng is said to have hidden the statue of Jowo Rinpoche in a secret chamber in the Jokhang. Princess Jincheng, sometime after 710 CE, had it placed in the central chapel of the Jokhang. It was replaced at Ramoche by a statue of Jowo Mikyo Dorje, a small bronze statue of the Buddha when he was eight years old, crafted by Vishvakarman, and brought to Lhasa by the Nepalese queen, Bhrikuti. Jowo Mikyo Dorje was badly damaged by the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution.Dorje, Gyume (1999), p. 92. Footprint Tibet Handbook with Bhutan.

The restoration of the Jowo was possible thanks to Ribur Rinpoche (1923‚Äì2006), a revered Lama who was jailed by the Chinese Army in 1959 for 20 years in Lhasa and was released in 1979 in connection with the liberalization politics of Deng Xiaoping. Ribur Rinpoche was granted a position at the Office of Religious Affairs of Tibet and began attempts to bring back spiritual sacred treasures that had been taken to China. In 1983, with the help of the 10th Panchen Lama, he succeeded in finding the upper part of Jowo Miky√∂ Dorje and returned it to Tibet. The Panchen Lama explained to the Chinese government how sacred the value of Jowos was for Tibetans and that their response to the quest of Ribur Rinpoche would help to prove the sincerity of the new Chinese religious policies.Ribur Rinpocheis no more, His Story Remains with Us Preface and Short Biography  References Literature von Schroeder, Ulrich. 2001.

Plot summary Set on the planet Palos, the novel concerns Jason Croft, a wealthy American who has learned the art of astral projection from a Hindu teacher. Croft feels an unusual calling to Sirius, the Dog Star, and projects his consciousness there, eventually finding his way to the major planet of the solar system, Palos. Once there, Croft finds human life, and floats among them observing their lives. He falls in love at first sight with the princess Naia, and determines to win her love. He eventually finds a host body in the form of the \\"spiritually sick\\" Jasor of Nodhur. Within Jasor's body, Croft sets out to win the love of the princess, by introducing technological improvements to the rulers of her kingdom, Tamarizia. Because of the knowledge gained by astrally spying upon key figures and places on Palos, the people view him as an \\"angel\\" of sorts, sent by their deity Zitu. Croft uses this misunderstanding to explain his knowledge of advanced technology.

The site was excavated between 1957 and 1959 by Danish and Iraqi archaeologists and was inundated by Lake Dukan until recently. The excavations showed that the site was occupied, although not continuously, from the Hassuna period (early sixth millennium BCE) until the 14th century CE. A small archive recovered from the Middle Bronze Age layers (early second millennium BCE) revealed that, at least in that period, the site was called Shusharra and was the capital of a small, semi-independent polity called mƒÅt Ut√™m or \\"land of the gatekeeper\\" ruled by a man called Kuwari.  History of research  The site was first recorded in 1955 during an archaeological survey of the Ranya Plain, which was to be flooded by the reservoir of the planned Dukan Dam. In 1957, a Danish team of archaeologists started a rescue excavation because the site would be flooded by Lake Dukan once the Dukan Dam would be finished. The Danish excavation was directed by Professors Harold Ingholt, who also excavated the citadel mound of Hama, and J√∏rgen L√¶ss√∏e. It was funded by the Carlsberg Foundation and the Danish Government Foundation for the Promotion of Research. The excavations were continued in 1958 and 1959 by Iraqi archaeologists of the State Board of Antiquities and Heritage (SBAH) under the direction of Abd al-Qadir at- Tekr√Æti. The work was never published but a small archive of accounts tables was found. The excavations have revealed that the site was occupied at least from the Hassuna period onward and the latest occupation phase dates to the 12th‚Äì14th centuries CE. The objects found during the Danish excavation were divided between the National Museum of Iraq and the National Museum of Denmark. So far, the prehistoric material of the Hassuna layers and the majority of the archives from the second millennium BCE have been published. In 2012, teams of the Netherlands Institute for the Near East and the Central Zagros Archaeological Project (CZAP) conducted new investigations at the site, as part of a larger archaeological project focussing on the entire Ranya Plain.  The site and its environment  Tell Shemshara sits along the Little Zab, a tributary of the Tigris. Its strategic location in the northeastern corner of the Ranya Plain in the Zagros Mountains gave Shemshara control over travelling routes in all directions, particularly toward the north and east. Shemshara is a tell, or settlement mound, that can be divided in two parts; a high main mound and an elongated lower mound. The main mound is in diameter and high, whereas the lower town is long and high. Shemshara is now partially submerged under Lake Dukan. It has lost 164,000 cubic meters of volume to erosion since 1957 and at high water levels becomes an island.  Occupation history  The excavations at the main mound revealed 16 occupation layers, ranging in date from the Hassuna period (early sixth millennium BCE) to the 14th century CE. Layers 16‚Äì9 dated to the Hassuna period. This occupation was characterized by rows of stones that are interpreted by the excavators as foundations for mudbrick walls, a pebble floor and a clay basin in the final occupation layer. Pottery, which has only been found in abundance in layers 13‚Äì9, shows stylistic links with that of Hassuna and Tell es-Sawwan. Obsidian was the preferred material for stone tools, with flint making up only 15 percent of the total assemblage. Whereas the flint was procured locally, the obsidian was obtained from two sources in eastern Turkey ‚Äì one as yet unidentified, the other one being the volcanic Nemrut Daƒü more than away from Shemshara. A unique piece in this assemblage is a dagger of over in length, broken in four pieces due to a fire. Other arti facts that have been found at the site include stone bowls, bracelets and quern-stones and small objects made of bone. Whereas the main mound seems to have been abandoned after the Hassuna occupation, scarce archaeological material from the Uruk (fourth millennium BCE) and Jemdet Nasr periods (early third millennium BCE) has been found on the lower town. Both the main mound and the lower extension were re- occupied during the Middle Bronze Age (early second millennium BCE). Layers 8‚Äì4 on the main mound can be assigned to this period. The excavations found a number of graves with bronze weapons on the main mound, as well as a mudbrick platform. In the lower town, a small part of a palace was excavated, and in three of its rooms a small archive of clay tablets was found. The palace was destroyed by fire, and through analysis of the archive it has been proposed that this happened in year 30 of the reign of Shamshi-Adad I of Assyria in the first quarter of the 18th century BCE. The archive consisted of 146 clay tablets or fragments thereof, of which a small part dealt with the administration of the town, whereas the majority consisted of letters written to a certain Kuwari. Some fragments were part of the clay envelopes in which these letters were sent. The texts were written in Akkadian. These texts revealed that during this period the site was called Shusharra, that it was the capital of a polity called mƒÅt Ut√™m or \\"land of the gatekeeper\\" and that it was ruled by a man named Kuwari. Chronologically, the archive can be divided in two parts, one covering the period during which Shemshara was the capital of a small semi-independent kingdom, and one covering the period after Kuwari became a vassal of Shamshi-Adad, who at that time had already conquered Mari and Shubat-Enlil and was now campaigning in the Zagros Mountains. Together, these two periods do not last longer than 3 years. The letters in the Shemshara archive show that during this period, Kuwari had to deal with Turukkean refugees coming from the east and fleeing a war with Guteans; events which are also mentioned in the much larger archives found in Mari on the Syrian Euphrates.

It was originally part of the incidental music he composed for his brother-in-law Arvid J√§rnefelt's 1903 play Kuolema (Death), but is far better known as a separate concert piece. Sibelius wrote six pieces for the 2 December 1903 production of Kuolema. The first was titled Tempo di valse lente - Poco risoluto. In 1904 he revised the piece, which was performed in Helsinki on 25 April of that year as Valse triste. It was an instant hit with the public, took on a life of its own, and remains one of Sibelius's signature pieces. Background The background to the music as it functions within the original play is expanded upon by the programme notes for the production: > It is night. The son, who has been watching beside the bedside of his sick > mother, has fallen asleep from sheer weariness, Gradually a ruddy light is > diffused through the room: there is a sound of distant music: the glow and > the music steal nearer until the strains of a valse melody float distantly > to our ears. The sleeping mother awakens, rises from her bed and, in her > long white garment, which takes the semblance of a ball dress, begins to > move silently and slowly to and fro. She waves her hands and beckons in time > to the music, as though she were summoning a crowd of invisible guests. And > now they appear, these strange visionary couples, turning and gliding to an > unearthly valse rhythm. The dying woman mingles with the dancers; she > strives to make them look into her eyes, but the shadowy guests one and all > avoid her glance. Then she seems to sink exhausted on her bed and the music > breaks off. Presently she gathers all her strength and invokes the dance > once more, with more energetic gestures than before. Back come the shadowy > dancers, gyrating in a wild, mad rhythm. The weird gaiety reaches a climax; > there is a knock at the door, which flies wide open; the mother utters a > despairing cry; the spectral guests vanish; the music dies away. Death > stands on the threshold. Publication and later developments The original version, presented in 1903 as Tempo di valse lente - Poco risoluto, has not survived. Breitkopf & H√§rtel published the later piece in 1905 as 'Op. 44'. However, because of the nature of the publishing contract, Sibelius saw relatively little money in terms of royalties from performances of Valse triste. In 1906, Sibelius merged the third and fourth numbers of the incidental music into a single piece, which he renamed Scene with Cranes. This was posthumously published in 1973, as Op. 44, No. 2; Valse triste was retrospectively renumbered as Op. 44, No. 1. According to the International Music Score Library Project in 2014, the work is \\"in the public domain in Canada (where IMSLP is hosted) and other countries where the term is life-plus-50 years (like China, Japan, Korea and many others worldwide). As this work was first published before 1923 or failed to meet notice or renewal requirements to secure statutory copyright, it is very likely to be public domain in the USA as well.\\" On April 19, 1952, record label Columbia Records and Porgie Music settled out of court with George Williams, who had sued the label for royalties in 1949 after it recorded (with Gene Krupa) Williams' jazz arrangement of Valse Triste. On November 13, 2014, the Vienna Philharmonic posted a notice on its Facebook page stating, \\"The Vienna Philharmonic regrets to have to make a change to the previously announced program of the New Year's Concert 2015. Due to unacceptable demands made by the publisher [which remains Breitkopf & H√§rtel], Valse triste, which had been intended to mark the 150th anniversary of the birth of Jean Sibelius, will not be performed as part of the New Year's Concert 2015. We are pleased to announce that, instead, the orchestra will perform the Anna Polka (in German: Annen-Polka), op. 117, by Johann Strauss, Jr., under the baton of Zubin Mehta.\\" In other media * Wendy Carlos created a synthesizer version of Valse triste for Stanley Kubrick's film The Shining.

It was formed from the split of London Country Bus Services in 1986 and operated a fleet of around 350 buses from six garages, with its headquarters located in Hatfield. The company was the last subsidiary of National Bus Company to be privatised, being sold to the AJS Group on 22 April 1988. Later in the same year it was split into County Bus & Coach and Sovereign Bus & Coach.

Early difficulties with staff conditions and wages, which the company was attempting to simplify from the complex contracts arranged by LCBS, led to strike action by staff in February 1988. Performance levels on contracted routes were already below those expected by the local councils who had awarded LCNE the contracts, and by London Regional Transport. Following the strike three of the company's London contracts (routes 292, 298 and 313) were terminated and awarded to independents.London Country North East loses three routes Commercial Motor 25 February 1988 On 22 April 1988, London Country North East was sold by the National Bus Company, the last of 72 subsidiaries to be privatised.NBC sale is completed with London Country NE Commercial Motor 7 April 1988 page 16Hansard House of Commons 18 April 1988 The buyer was Alan Stephenson's AJS Group,Companies House extract company no 2188825 Blazefield Travel Group Limited ex AJS Travel Group Limited ex AJS Holdings Limited which had been formed by the management buyout of West Yorkshire Road Car Company.

Parkdale Holdings later went out of business having changed their name to Pavilion Leisure. A month later LCNE was banned from registering new services for six months by the Traffic Commissioner for failing to operate service in accordance with registrations made. Following poor financial results, AJS decided to split the company in two. Division In 20 months of existence London Country North East had lost ¬£5.5 million, on a turnover of ¬£14 million.

Its chief executive, Bob Howells, had previously been West Yorkshire Road Car Company's traffic manager. A third company, Cambridge based Premier Travel Services, was added to the group in 1989 but was sold to Cambus in 1991. Both subsidiaries continued to be owned by AJS until 1991, when they were sold to new owners. County Bus & Coach County Bus & CoachCompanies House extract company no 2294927 Arriva East Herts & Essex Limited formerly County Bus & Coach Company Limited took over the former London Country North East garages at Harlow, Grays and Hertford. Under AJS's ownership it was managed by Graham Willet, previously London Country Bus Services' chief engineer. The company enjoyed some expansion: small independent Sampson Coaches and its garage at Hoddesdon were bought in February 1989; however, as a result of this, Hertford garage was vacated and sold for redevelopment by its owners Parkdale Holdings. The Debden and Wyatts Green depots and some local routes of the former East Midland owned Frontrunner operation were acquired in July 1989. County Bus & Coach's fleet policy was to use Mercedes-Benz minibuses on most routes, including in Grays when Lakeside Shopping Centre opened and when two London contracted routes were run; there is some evidence that passengers did not like these vehicles, and their use is thought to have reduced patronage in the area.ThameSide Thurrock TransportSovereign takes on BTA Commercial Motor 7 December 1989 page 18 Citibus Tours Leyland Atlantean in Manchester in the 1990s AJS group was wound up in 1991, and the company's director Bob Howells bought County Bus & Coach through a new holding company, Lynton Travel Group.Companies House extract company no 2525773 County Bus Holdings Limited formerly Lynton Travel Group Limited County Bus & Coach was relaunched with three new local identities: Grays garage became ThameSide, Harlow became TownLink, and Hoddesdon became Lea Valley.

The company was one of the beneficiaries of the collapse of London Forest, gaining three routes in Walthamstow.McLachlan p.33 The services of Golden Boy were also taken over, in September 1992, although this deal involved no vehicles and no garage. In July 1993, Lynton Travel purchased 41-vehicle independent Citibus Tours, based in Chadderton near Oldham. Other changes made in 1993 included the opening of a new garage in Grays to replace the previous building, and a totally new garage at Ware which replaced that at Hoddesdon. Two more operators were taken over in 1994, namely coach operators Airport Coaches of Stansted Airport and Biss Bros of Bishops Stortford. However, on 7 October 1994 County Bus & Coach was sold to West Midlands Travel, who had also acquired the former London Buses subsidiary Westlink. In November 1994 County Bus & Coach became only the tenth operator in the UK to introduce low-floor vehicles into service, when four Dennis Lance SLFs with Wright Pathfinder bodywork were introduced to route 502 Harlow to Romford. West Midlands Travel was taken over by National Express in 1995, and the new owners decided not to keep their London companies. Westlink was the first to be sold, to London United in September 1995.

The English translation by Will Hobson appeared in 2000. The book describes the 1809 Battle of Aspern- Essling between the French Empire under Napoleon and the Austrian Empire. The action in the novel follows closely historical observations and descriptions as seen from the French perspective. La Bataille is the first book of a trilogy by Rambaud about the decline of Napoleon, describing his first personal defeat in a European battle; the other two books cover Napoleon‚Äôs defeat in Russia in The Retreat and his banishment at Elba in Napoleon‚Äôs Exile. Historical background Diagram of the battle of Aspern-Essling, 1809 In the War of the Fifth Coalition Austria and Great Britain sought to reduce French dominance on the continent. Napoleon, however, succeeded militarily in Southern Germany and entered Vienna on May 13, 1809. The main Austrian army under Archduke Charles retreated to the eastern shore of the Danube. Napoleon chose to cross the Danube south of Vienna at the Lobau island. He directed the construction of a pontoon bridge to cross to the eastern side where he occupied the villages of Aspern and Essling (today part of Vienna). On May 21-22, 1809 Austrian forces attacked the French foothold and beat them back. Their success was in part due to their ability to break the bridge and disrupt Napoleon‚Äôs attempts to bring reinforcements across the river. The two-day battle was very costly with over 40,000 fatalities. It was the first personal defeat of Napoleon in a European battlefield. He recovered, however, and was able to beat the Austrian army at Wagram in July and subsequently dictated his conditions at Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn. The book The book has seven chapters, the first two cover the days prior to the battle, four chapters deal with the day and night of each of the two days of the battle, and the last one with the immediate aftermath of the \\"hecatomb\\". Historical notes are attached. The narration picks up the action in Vienna on May 16, 1809 and introduces colonel Louis-Fran√ßois Lejeune, a professional soldier and officer of the General Staff; he and Napoleon are the pivotal characters of the novel. As a liaison officer, Lejeune has access to Napoleon and his entourage. Napoleon is shown \\"as a foul-mouthed, callous bully, driven by vanity and detested even by his closest comrades.\\" The book describes Napoleon's preparations for the battle, his hasty and ultimately disastrous decision to build a pontoon bridge across the raging Danube, and his often tense relationship with his subordinates, among them Andr√© Mass√©na, Pierre Daru, Jean-Baptiste Bessi√®res, Louis- Alexandre Berthier, Jean Boudet, Jean-Baptiste Marbot, and the fatally wounded Jean Lannes. The two-day battle is described in gory detail, including the mass murder of hundreds of prisoners. Lejeune‚Äôs friend is Henry Beyle, later known as Stendhal, who, afflicted with syphilis, remains in Vienna as an observer; they both have a common love interest in Anna Krauss, an Austrian woman. Balzac's \\"La Bataille\\" The novel is based on a concept by Honor√© de Balzac who in the 1830s made notes and preparations for a novel La Bataille in which he intended to describe the Battle of Aspern-Essling. He visited the battlefield in 1835. Balzac wrote to his future wife that he wanted to depict the battle with \\"all the horrors and all the beauties\\" so that the reader felt himself to be present in it. The work was never completed. Rambaud suggests that Balzac was interested in this particular battle as here the \\"nature of war\\" changed. Not only did the battle damage Napoleon's prestige, but afterwards nationalistic movements started to develop all over Europe. The Battle of Aspern-Essling gives a glimpse of the senseless horrors and slaughters of wars to come. Historical accuracy Rambaud studied French sources closely and follows the battle with accuracy. The main characters are based on real people with few exceptions. The gentle fusilier Paradis and the brutal cuirassier Fayonne are contrasting representative characters, and Anna Krauss, the love interest of Lejeune and Beyle, is a fictional person; also, the friendship between Lejeune and Stendhal is an artistic device. Friedrich Staps attempted to kill Napoleon not in May but on October 12, 1809. Reception It is generally acknowledged that the battle has been well researched and described vividly; the novel received prestigious awards. There is some critique that the viewpoint was strictly from the French side-- although it could be argued that not knowing the other side is a realistic presentation of the fog of war--and that the love affair was \\"weak\\". Anna Mundow found the novel \\"astonishing\\" with excellent distillation of the historical events, while Jeff Waggoner complained that the novel was short on characterization.

His work is among the most widely recognized of any artist in Hawaii. A long-time resident of the Big Island, he is known primarily for scenes of Hawaiian mythology and of traditional Hawaiian life and stylized designs from nature. Early life Varez was born in Berlin, Germany, at the start of World War II. His father was Friedrich Donat, an architect and engineer of Lithuanian heritage, whom Varez has said was a Nazi who worked on military construction. His mother, Ursula, was a Polish-Swedish translator of English. As the war ended, Varez's father left his family to fend for themselves and he went into hiding from occupation forces, a period Varez has said was \\"pure misery\\". Ursula divorced Donat in 1947. In 1948, she married U.S. Army Sgt. Manuel Varez, who adopted her sons, Dietrich and Christian, and brought the family to his home in Oahu, Hawaii. Dietrich graduated from President Theodore Roosevelt High School in Honolulu and from the University of Hawaii with a degree in English. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1962, earning the rank of second lieutenant, and then served in the Army Reserves in Honolulu while earning a master's degree in English at the University of Hawaii. He married Linda Denneberg, a native of California who had come to Hawaii as a competitive surfer and stayed to become an artist, in 1965. Varez, with his wife and recently born son, moved to the Big Island in 1968 after purchasing a property near Kilauea Volcano, sight unseen. For several years, the family lived in cabins at the Hawaii Volcano National Park, or in a tent on their land, supported by Varez's groundskeeping job at a nearby golf course or as a bartender for the Volcano House, the 1877 lodge in the National Park overlooking the caldera of Kilauea Volcano. He supplemented his earnings by carving firewood scraps with the image of Pele, Goddess of the volcano, which he sold at the bar, and later he made woodblock prints, mostly giving them away but selling some in the lodge gift shop. In 1974, the nonprofit Volcano Art Center opened, providing increased visibility for his work. Varez prints became increasingly popular, eventually allowing Varez to earn a living as an artist. Art Varez has published more than 225 wood- and linoleum-block prints. The subject matter in most of Varez's work is inspired by traditional Hawaiian legends, integrating mythological figures in scenes with flora and fauna typical of the diverse Hawaiian environment. His work is informed by graphic interpretations of traditional Polynesian designs, as seen, for instance, in Hawaiian quilts, and is especially rich in imagery from the Hawaiian rainforest. However, Varez has stated that he actively avoids other art that might influence the unmediated nature of his vision. His recent graphic work has branched out to include more modern stories, notably that of Father Damien, known for his work in the leper colony on Molokai, and also the renowned battleship USS Missouri (BB-63), berthed at Pearl Harbor, the U.S. Naval base on Oahu. His work is widely known through books that he has illustrated, and, in some cases, written, including: *Lehua: A Legend of Old Hawaii (Island Heritage Publishers) *Hina the Goddess (Petroglyph Press, Hilo) *Pele and Hi'iaka, A Tale of Two Sisters (Petroglyph Press, Hilo) *Pele: The Fire Goddess with Pua Kanaka'Ole Kanahele (Bishop Museum Press) *Maui the Demigod, by Steven Goldsberry (Bishop Museum Press) *Maui: The Mischief Maker with Lilikala Kame Eleihiwa (Bishop Museum Press) *The Water of Life‚ÄîA Jungian Journey Through Hawaiian Myth with Rita Knipe *Hawaiian-Japanese Dictionary (Nishizawa) *Kamapua'a, by John Charlot *'Olelo No'eau: Hawaiian Proverbs & Poetical Sayings, by Mary Kawena Pukui *The Legend of La'ieikawai with Martha Warren Beckwith *The Law of the Splintered Paddle: Kanawai Mamalahoe by Carol Chang *A Pocket Guide to the Hawaiian Language by Albert J. Schutz Video: Dietrich Varez talking about the early days at Volcano House / His Painting of Volcano House Bar https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As4XHWmRE-Y Varez has also adapted prints to fabric for a line of Hawaiian shirts with clothing maker Reyn Spooner, and he has also painted in oils on a limited basis. DIETRICH VAREZ JEWELRY: A new addition of Varez Art is a line of handmade jewelry inspired by Dietrich's block prints. The first pieces have just been released but over time most of Varez's prints will be available as wearable art jewelry. The \\"Varez Collection\\" of story jewelry is created under an exclusive license given by Varez to long-time Volcano artist & gemcutter \\"Ken Arnopole\\" and his wife artist & designer Beate Arnopole. A collaboration between the artists Dietrich was tickled to see his art made into one of a kind jewelry. They are marketing the Varez Collection under the brand names \\"Aloha Accents\\" & \\"Varez Jewelry\\" (www.DietrichVarezJewelry.com). Dietrich had worked with a Catholic Nun from Honolulu to create two religious prints with Saint Damien and Saint Marianne, and Ken and Beate are creating also a wonderful line of religious jewelry inspired by these prints. This includes custom rosaries, and in 2017 they created a very special Sterling Silver Vermeil & Genuine Lapis St. Damien Rosary given as a gift to Bishop Silva of Honolulu during the first Saint Damien Conference in Hawaii. DIETRICH VAREZ \\"Edible Art\\" CHOCOLATE: The most recent addition is a line if \\"edible art\\" Pure Hawaiian Chocolate Bars that Ken and Beate created as a special gift for Dietrich. Dietrich absolutely LOVED good chocolate, and he was amused to be able to eat his own art. The special chocolate bars are currently for sale in a couple select health food stores in Hilo. Lifestyle The studio where Varez works and lives is in a rural forested area near the small town of Volcano, Hawaii a few miles from the entrance to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. He built the house himself after many years of living in tents or cabins on the land or in the Park. For most of his life there, he and his family have lived a self-sufficient pioneering life. They capture rainwater for their needs, and had no electricity for thirty years. The road to his home has been described as \\"barely passable\\". Varez and his wife rarely leave their homestead, virtually never travelling off-island. Unconventional approach to life and business Varez, as a self-taught artist whose career developed outside framework of the institutional art world, maintains a strict policy of keeping prices low and distributing directly to the widest audience. This is consistent with his earliest practice of giving away prints, and only then, when demand required it, of charging nominal prices to cover his expenses. It was only after several years of a growing reputation that he decided to make his living from the sale of his work, and he has expressed in interviews a deep ambivalence toward being considered a professional artist. > \\"Some people have told me that until I start charging more, I'm never going > to become a 'known artist.' I think that's nonsense. You either like the > print or you don't, and that shouldn't have anything to do with the price. > My goal is to make art ‚Äì at least my art ‚Äì available to common people. I > don't give a damn about the art people; I want to get it into your mom's > house and my mom's house\\". Contrary to the usual practice among printmakers, he refuses to limit his editions, printing until a block is exhausted. He dates his prints according to when the print was struck, not, as is customary, when the block was carved. These individualistic practices may have limited the value of his work to collectors, but Varez has said he is committed to staying outside the artificial boundaries of art world conventions. \\"The printmaking business needs some new blood and new traditions\\", he has been quoted as saying.

The creek is part of a $67 million Chinook salmon restoration project, a PG&E; Battle Creek Hydroelectric Project. Many adjacent properties hold conservation easements protecting them from development. In addition to the Chinook salmon, the creek has steelhead, rainbow, and brown trout. Counterintuitively, first-year data from a post- wildfire soil erosion study funded by Sierra Pacific Industries, a large industrial timber company, show that control sites disturbed only by fire produced substantially more water runoff and soil erosion than did sites that received post-wildfire salvage logging.James, Cajun \\"Post Wildfire Salvage Logging, Soil Erosion, and Sediment Delivery, Ponderosa Fire, Battle Creek Watershed, Northern California\\" However, given this document was written by an employee of the large timber company which has extensively salvage logged the watershed, the results are questionable. Furthermore, two hydrologists' reviews of the document found substantial flaws in it.Myers, Tom \\"Review of Study: Inspection of Sierra Pacific Industries‚Äô Ponderosa Post-Fire Sediment Study, Shasta County, California\\"Lewis, Jack Topographic Characterization of Swales in Sierra Pacific Industries‚Äô Ponderosa Post-Fire Sediment Study, Shasta County, California The industrial timberland in the Battle Creek watershed is upstream of the restoration project.

She was the daughter of Louis I, Duke of Orl√©ans, and Valentina Visconti. Life She was the granddaughter and niece of King Charles V of France and King Charles VI of France, respectively. Her mother was the daughter of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Duke of Milan, and Isabella of France, who was a daughter of King John II of France. Her brother was the famous and unfortunate Charles, Duke of Orl√©ans, (father of the future Louis XII of France), captured at Agincourt and imprisoned for twenty-five years in England and who during his long captivity, became the greatest poet of the 15th century in the French language. In 1423 she married Richard of Montfort, son of John IV, Duke of Brittany, and Joanna of Navarre, later Queen of England as wife of Henry Bolingbroke. Margaret succeeded her brother Philip as Countess of Vertus. She and Richard had seven children, of whom only two, Francis and Catherine, would have progeny. In 1458 Francis succeeded his uncle Arthur III as Duke of Brittany. Margaret, widowed in 1438, lived for a long time at Longchamp and in other monasteries with her younger daughters, Margaret and Madeleine (who was born after her father's death). She was described as a very pious woman. The Book of Hours of Marguerite d'Orleans, regarded as a defining example of the Illustrated Prayer Book of the Fifteenth Century, was made for her so that she might practice her devotion on a daily basis. She obtained a declaration from the Cardinal of Estouteville that sheltered her liberty and that of her daughters as they moved among the convents and religious monasteries of northern France. She finally retired to the Abbey at Guiche, order of Sainte Claire near Blois, where she died April 24, 1466 at the age of sixty. County of √âtampes A folio from the Book of Hours of Margaret of Orl√©ans, western France, commissioned around 1430. The combined arms of Brittany and Orl√©ans appearing behind the lady praying to the Virgin indicate that this book was produced for Marguerite d'Orl√©ans. The artist's decorative genius is affirmed most strongly in the imaginative borders With her father's death, Margaret inherited the rights to the County of √âtampes, and was named countess with her husband as count, in 1423, which was recovered from the crown lands after the death in 1416, of its last incumbent lord, John, Duke of Berry. However, the claim was disputed by the then Duke of Burgundy, Philip the Good, who succeeded his father John the Fearless in 1419 after the latter's assassination by the agents of Dauphin Charles. Philip took possession and ruled the county personally, (possibly wresting it from Richard in vengeance of his father's death) till 1434, after which he gave it to John II, Count of Nevers, his first cousin, who kept it in peaceful possession, until it was reverted to Richard in September 1435 (who died in 1438) by the former Dauphin, who was now King Charles VII of France. The new king confirmed his gift to the deceased duke by letters patent presented to his widow in 1442. However, this decision was contested by the Attorney General of the Parlement, who argued that the County should have been reunited with the Crown, after the death of Richard. It was taken back from Margaret's son Francis in 1478 and in the month of April of the following year, Charles's son and successor, King Louis XI gave it to John of Foix, Viscount of Narbonne, whose wife Marie of Orleans was a niece of Margaret and sister of the future Louis XII of France.

In his lifetime he held many titles and positions; he was appointed captain-general of Guyenne and Poitou in 1419, became comte d'√âtampes and seigneur de Palluau et de Ch√¢teaumur de Thouarc√©, de Bourgomeaux-l'Ev√™que et de Ligron on 8 May 1423, and Count of Mantes in October 1425.

The bride received the county of Vertus as dowry, thus Richard became count in the right of his wife. She and Richard had: * Marie of Brittany, Abbess of Fontevraud * Francis II, Duke of Brittany married Margaret of Brittany * Isabeau * Catherine of Brittany, married William of Orange in 1438. * Marguerite of Brittany, nun at Longchamp * Madeleine of Brittany Richard also had a natural daughter by a mistress.

He also became baron de Clisson, seigneur de Courtenay, de Piffonds, de Houdan et de l'Epine-Gaudin in 1423, and ch√¢telain de Renac et de Bois-Raoul near Redon in 1424. Richard became Count of √âtampes in the right of his wife. She inherited the rights to the county from her father and was formally granted them by King Charles VII of France. However, their claim was disputed by Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy. Presumably, Philip sought to avenge his father's death by disrupting Charles's reign; Charles was most probably responsible for the late duke's assassination in 1419. Philip occupied the duchy and held it personally until 1434, after which he gave it to his cousin, John II, Count of Nevers. Nevertheless, the County was returned to Richard in September 1435. Other relations Richard had many varying and complex relationships with French and English royalty. His mother Joan later married Henry IV of England, and became Queen of England. Richard's stepbrother and Henry IV's son and successor, Henry V of England, would later claim the throne of France and re-initiate the Hundred Years' War and marry Richard's wife's paternal cousin, Catherine of Valois. His step-nephew, King Henry VI of England, succeeded his grandfather and Richard's wife's uncle, Charles VI to the French throne, as a rival to Dauphin Charles. Coincidentally, Henry's wife, Margaret of Anjou, was the step-daughter of Jeanne de Laval, who was a granddaughter of Richard's brother, John VI, Duke of Brittany. Richard was also distantly related to the Courtenays, who were also descended from Louis VI, through his youngest son, Peter I of Courtenay. Succession Richard died on 2 June 1438. Both of Richard's older brothers had succeeded their father, John IV, as Duke of Brittany. By the time of Richard's death, he had predeceased the remaining claimants to his father's title, save his only legitimate son, Francis II. As a result, Francis II succeeded Richard, his father, as Count of √âtampes and Arthur III, his uncle, as Duke of Brittany.

With 40 percent vacant by the resignations of Cox and Allen, 60 percent, therefore, a majority voting stake, still belonged to original board members. Consequently, the FCC rejected this allegation, and no fines were issued. The station's licence application was approved, expiring June 1, 2011.

In 1869 he moved to Canterbury, working as a general contractor until becoming a Member of Parliament in 1886. Member of Parliament William White resigned his Sydenham seat in Parliament in March 1886 on medical advice. Taylor successfully contested the subsequent by-election on 12 May, gaining 438 votes against John Lee Scott (418), Samuel Paull Andrews (230) and S. G. Jolly (2). At the 1887 general election, Taylor contested the electorate against John Crewes. They received 766 and 392 votes respectively, so Taylor entered the 10th New Zealand Parliament. The Sydenham electorate was abolished in 1890 so Taylor contested the City of Christchurch electorate instead, winning the third highest number of votes in the three-member electorate. He unsuccessfully contested the 1893 and 1896 general elections, and the 1896 by-election. Private life Taylor was married in 1887 to Laura Augusta Gray (born ca. 1832), a daughter of S. F. Gray of London. She died on 21 December 1903 at their home in Waltham Road, Sydenham, aged 69. Taylor died in Wellington on 26 August 1919, and was buried at Karori Cemetery.

(French: La Terre est habit√©e!) is a 1966 National Film Board of Canada animated short co-directed by Les Drew and Kaj Pindal. The film is a mockumentary, introduced in its opening credits as produced by the \\"National Film Board of Mars\\"Thought, Volume 21, Issues 1-26, Page ccxii that takes a humorous look at car culture from the point of view of fictional Martians, who mistake automobiles for Earth's true inhabitants and people as their parasites. It attempts to examine the sociology of the automobile as the dominant species on earth, and makes wild guesses about the lifestyle, feeding habits, mating habits and funeral rites of this \\"species.\\" Plot The film shows the earth from the view of an orbiting Martian spaceship, which did not land but used cameras to film earth society. It follows average (what it believes to be) earthlings and their civilization, by in effect showing a \\"day in the life\\" and how they live it. First, it shows one having dinner - a precisely regulated feeding (vehicle refueling from a gas pump), then how it must take its rest (pulling into a house's attached garage), because the next day will be a busy one. The next morning it shows a large number of earthlings (cars) out traveling on roads and highways. The earthlings apparently enjoy \\"all play and no work\\" and do not tolerate anything that impairs their \\"smooth, fast life\\"; slowdowns cause significant complaints (honking) until a worker arrives to fix the problem (a traffic jam is solved when a batch of construction vehicles \\"eat\\" a mountain to open the roadway, and cover a chasm to build a new bridge). The presence of many earthlings (vehicles) in traffic is presumed to be the need for companionship. But if their desire for companionship and dancing is interrupted, social directors who never leave their post (traffic signals) will instruct them. With this fun comes exhaustion (tow trucks pulling cars). There is a steady run on spas and health centers (car washes and repair shops). Libraries (road signs and billboards) and audio-visual centers (drive-in theaters) are readily available. When they become too old, earthlings move to retirement parks (used car lots) and then, when it is time, earthlings perform their final act; they instruct a worker to perform euthanasia on them (being crushed in a wrecking yard), so that they can reproduce. Earthlings have eliminated sex, and reproduce (in secret) in three or four large breeding centers (car factories). The Martian narrator of the film tells his audience that their scientists believe that the process of earthling reproduction \\"must go something like this\\", after which is shown a completely incorrect version of how a car is built. However, at the end of this demonstration, it is stated that, \\"a newborn earthling, fully grown, is ready for its place in society\\". Despite their advancement, the earthlings have not eliminated the parasites that infest them (human beings and pets) are working on eradicating their nests (tearing down buildings). The film ends with the Martians' hope that they will soon be able to actually send visitors to meet with the earthlings. Production The film was first proposed at the NFB by Pindal in December 1963, with the working title Automation, with the intention of showing how \\"in spite of appearances, man is the master in the automated world.\\" The working title would become Martians, before the final title What on Earth! was chosen. Drew was brought in to work on the film in 1965 and 1966, with Brittain assigned to write narration. Pindal's original idea of \\"man as the master\\" is not reflected in the final version of the film, and NFB archivist and blogger Albert Ohayon believes Brittain may have been responsible for this key change. Release What on Earth! was completed in late 1966 and shown to distributors including Columbia Pictures, which purchased international theatrical rights in January 1967. The film received several film festival awards, including at the International Festival of Science Fiction in Trieste, Italy. It was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film at the 40th Academy Awards.Short Film Oscars¬Æ in 1968-Oscars on YouTube Following a successful theatrical run, the film was sold to approximately 30 networks around the world, beginning in 1969. TV sales included CBC-TV in Canada and the ABC TV network in the US. The ABC sale was for seven animated shorts, including Walking, Cosmic Zoom and Hot Stuff, and marked the first time NFB films had been sold to a major American television network. The films aired on ABC in the fall of 1971 as part of the children's television show Curiosity Shop, executive produced by Chuck Jones.

It premiered on March 10, 2010 on USA Network in the United States. The episode serves as the season 4 finale and is the sequel to the third season's finale, \\"An Evening with Mr. Yang\\". It is an important installment in one of the series' few story arcs. A third and final installment of the Yin/Yang series, entitled \\"Yang 3 in 2D\\", aired as the fifth season finale. Plot Shawn and Gus are attending a triple-feature of famous Alfred Hitchcock films, including (according to a playbill) The Birds, The Man Who Knew Too Much, and Psycho. After squeezing down a row of other patrons, Shawn finally is able to sit down, 20 minutes into Psycho. After finally finishing the films, they exit the theater and bump into Mary Lightly (Jimmi Simpson), one of the key figures in capturing Mr. Yang a year earlier. He takes them to a diner, where they discuss a new book written by Yang. Mary insists that, according to Yang's account of the events leading up to her capture, it was impossible that she was working alone. There had to have been a Yin. Shawn and Gus are skeptical, and leave the diner. Shawn rereads Yang's book but falls asleep. The next morning he and Gus are called to a crime scene. The waitress who had served them their pie at the diner had been found dead. Shawn notices that her body was arranged into a Yin/Yang symbol. Shawn, Gus, Detective Lassiter, Detective O'Hara, and Mary arrive at the diner, where they find a pie marked with the Yin/Yang sign. Inside is a crossword clue, decoded by Officer McNab (Sage Brocklebank) to mean \\"Find Me.\\" Mary insists that the events of the past day are the work of Yin. Shawn, Gus, and Mary visit Yang (Ally Sheedy) in prison. She reveals that she did have a partner, and that her partner is even more psychopathic than she is. Shawn leads the group back to the theater, using the crossword to find a specific seat. Shawn remembers that the person who had sat in that seat was one of the people he had been forced to squeeze by when trying to get to his seat during the showing of Psycho. After discovering a note, Mary concludes that Yin is working alone, and that, being the opposite of Yang, represents chaos. After realizing that Yin must be basing his devious activities off of Hitchcock films, Gus proposes that they each take several Hitchcock films and watch them all so as to get a better idea what Yin will do next. The others agree, and split up. While watching Vertigo, Shawn falls asleep. During a dream, he sees Juliet, Lassiter, Chief Vick, and his father in classic Hitchcock situations encouraging him to find something. Finally, he sees the person in the theater. He remembers that the person in theater was wearing ankle weights, leading him to believe that Mary is Yin. When he is awakened by Gus, Shawn discovers that, while he was sleeping, someone had vandalized the \\"Psych\\" logo on the window to read \\"Psycho.\\" Shawn believes it was Yin. Shawn reveals his theory to the police. He urges them to keep Mary on the case and allow him to incriminate himself. When Mary suspiciously arrives with a note from Yin that was left on his doorstep, Lassiter and Juliet trace the clue to a fountain in the park. Meanwhile, Shawn and Gus take a detour to Mary's house. They find a ticket stub proving he had been in the theater and a closet that appears to be a shrine to Yang. At the park, Lassiter and Juliet reach the 39th stair (a reference to Hitchcock's The 39 Steps), but Mary stays behind, blaming his ankle weights. Lassiter notices Mary is gone, but Juliet sees Yin boarding a nearby bus. After failing to stop the bus, Mary appears, claiming to have tried to stop the bus. At Mary's house, Shawn and Gus discover a notebook with several rough drafts of what appears to be Yin's next clue. To Shawn, this confirms his suspicions. When the police and the Psych duo stake out a location referenced in Yin's rough draft, they see Mary entering the building alone. It appears as if he is preparing for something. Lassiter and Juliet go around the building to catch him, ordering Shawn and Gus to stay in the car. However, they disobey, and enter the building. They find themselves in a studio with surveillance monitors, all covering a staircase. They watch as Mary enters and begins walking up the stairs. They realize that they were wrong about Mary: he is playing the part of Martin Balsam in Psycho. They realize that he is about to be killed. Shawn and Gus try hopelessly to escape the room and save Mary; by the time they find him, he has been stabbed by the real Yin. As he is dying, Mary reveals that he had come alone in an effort to be heroic. Gus notices Yin nearby but he escapes before the police catch him. Shawn and Gus return to Yang. She tells them to look in her book. Gus protests that he had read the book cover-to-cover. Shawn realizes that the clue might actually be in the cover. He holds the book up to the light as sees a crude drawing of a girl standing near water. Vick calls, and tells them that Yin has left another clue. When they arrive, she tells them that Yin cast each of them as \\"archetypal characters from Hitchcock's canon.\\" Not even Henry can escape from the deathly casting call, being cast as Sean Connery in Marnie. That night, they arrive at the designated location, where Yin has recreated various sets from Hitchcock films. The five \\"actors\\" split up: Henry with Lassiter, Gus with Juliet, and Shawn by himself. Juliet and Gus are lured to a bar, which contains a clue for Juliet. She follows the instructions, but falls through a trapdoor in the floor and is kidnapped. At the police station, Shawn blames himself. Lassiter asks Shawn to account for all of his friends and family. Henry is safe, and Shawn's mother, Madeleine, is at a conference in New York, where she is safe. However, Abigail, Shawn's girlfriend, is waiting for him at the airport, arriving back temporarily from a six-month trip to Uganda. McNab is designated to pick her up, as Vick deems it is safest that way. As Abigail (Rachael Leigh Cook) sits in his squad car, he turns his head sideways. He slumps forward, unconscious. Yin sprays her with knockout gas and kidnaps her. Shawn receives a phone call from Yin, who tells him that he must choose who he loves more (Juliet or Abigail), and that there is no way to save them both. Juliet is bound, gagged and dangled from a clock tower. Mr. Yin is there and activates the trap and leaves. Gus and Lassiter deduce her location and go to save her with Vick. Shawn figures out that the picture in the book is a clue to Abigail's location. He goes with Henry to the pier to find Abigail. When Shawn arrives, he surprises Yin, who is just leaving. Yin darts away. Shawn finds Abigail tied up under the pier. He and Henry save her with moments to spare. Meanwhile, Gus and Lassiter make their way to the top of the tower to rescue Juliet. Realizing that the line that is holding Juliet up is about to be severed, Gus grabs the blade and holds it back long enough for Lassiter to jam the gears with his gun. Back at the pier, Henry talks to the police while Shawn speaks with Abigail. She tells him that she can no longer date him if that kind of danger follows him around. Meanwhile, Lassiter goes to talk to Juliet, who is getting frustrated with everyone asking if she's okay. Lassiter tells her that \\"it's okay to not be fine\\" and Juliet, overcome with the fear that she was very close to being killed, starts sobbing as Lassiter hugs her. Henry scrapes the painted \\"O\\" off of the Psych window. Shawn and Gus attend Mary's racquetball-themed funeral. Yang sits in her cell, staring at a wall. In closing, we see Yin, who takes off his hat and sighs. He looks at a picture of Yang, standing next to a young Shawn Spencer. Reception The episode was well liked by critics, including IGN writer Jonah Krakow, who rated it 9.4 out of 10 and awarded it the IGN.com Editor's Choice Award. He particularly praised the red herrings of the episode, including the filmmakers making the audience momentarily believe that Mary and McNabb could be possible Yins. Krak√≥w in particular made note that the episode managed to stay true to the series formula while offering up a nail-biter of an episode: \\"...at the same time, I love how they can completely switch gears and offer up a legitimately suspenseful episode and still remain true to the premise of the show.\\" Krak√≥w also speculated on Juliet's breakdown in the epilogue and its ambiguous nature: \\"It makes sense that she was scared out of her mind, staring death in the eye and needed a shoulder to cry on (in this case, Det. Lassiter), but part of me thinks knowing that Shawn chose to save Abigail instead of her was another reason why she was so upset. Hopefully we'll get some closure to this relationship in the upcoming season.\\" Krak√≥w finished the review with the following: { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"10\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" width=\\"90%\\" style=\\"background-color: #EEEEEE;\\" -----  I had high expectations going into this episode because of the bar they set one year ago with \\"An Evening with Mr. Yang.\\" This episode of PSYCH exceeded my expectations due to an even more suspenseful story and an even creepier killer. I don't mind that Mr. Yin is still at large because after four seasons, we finally have a foe who's crafty enough to face off against Shawn. I'm a little bummed that the show will be off for a few months, but they couldn't have left on a better note.http://tv.ign.com/articles/107/1076766p1.html } Gerald So also praised the episode, but stated that the tone seemed a little too serious compared to the rest of the series. He particularly complimented how the characters worked together to save both Juliet and Abigail in the climax.http://www.bscreview.com/2010/03/psych-mr-yin-presents-review/ However, viewership for the episode was down from previous weeks to only 2.95 million viewers.http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/03/11/psych-ends-season-on-a-so-so- note/44699 The episode received an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Music Composition For a Series (Original Dramatic Score). The music was composed by Adam Cohen and John Robert Wood.Emmy nomination list (p. 16) Hitchcock references The entire episode was based upon several themes and iconic scenes from Alfred Hitchcock's canon. * The title of the episode is a play on the title of the television series hosted by Hitchcock, Alfred Hitchcock Presents. * Shawn arrives 20 minutes late to the theater to watch Psycho. This is a reference to the initial release of the film, in which Hitchcock instructed theater owners not to allow people into the theater after the film had begun. * When Shawn and Gus encounter Mary after the movies, it is raining and people are carrying umbrellas, and Mary appears wearing a white trenchcoat and carrying an umbrella, in reference to the famous umbrella scene in Foreign Correspondent. * During the opening of the initial diner sequence, an Alfred Hitchcock look alike can be spotted in the background. This is a reference to Hitchcock's cameo in every one of his films. * The waitress at the diner brings Gus a glass of milk, a reference to Suspicion. * When delivering the glass of milk to Gus, the waitress says, \\"here's your milk, Dollface\\", a reference to Dollface Cosmetics, a fictional company mentioned in The Birds. * When Shawn rises to leave the diner, refusing to help Mary catch Yin, Mary grabs Shawn's lower arm to prevent him leaving, and the arm-grab is then shown in close-up. This is a reference to the scene in To Catch a Thief in which Francie (Grace Kelly) does the same in an attempt to prevent Robie (Cary Grant) from leaving after refusing to help catch the real burglar. * When removing Mary's hand from his arm, Shawn says, \\"Good luck at the Creepy Arm- grab awards this year, Mary; I think you have a real shot at winning,\\" which could refer to the fact that Hitchcock was frequently nominated but never won a contested Academy Award. * After Shawn and Gus leave the diner, Mary elaborately cuts his pie with his fork and knife, a reference to the murder scene in Sabotage in which Mrs. Verloc kills her husband. * The necktie strangling of the waitress was a reference to Frenzy. * Yang's book was \\"Edited by Dr. Anne Powers, PHD\\". Dr. Anne Powers, PhD. was a writing colleague of Robert Bloch (writer of Psycho), who, along with him, wrote many episodes of Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Later in her career, Powers served on the faculty of Marquette University as a creative writing professor. * Shawn has a dream sequence in which each of the characters are shown in classic Hitchcock situations. Detective O'Hara is shown speaking to him in the famous shower scene from Psycho, Detective Lassiter is dressed as a woman with a kitchen knife mimicking a woman's voice, just as Norman Bates was in the same film, and Shawn (dressed as a woman) is shown sitting in a theater seat with tongue hanging out and with blue lips, strangled with a necktie and posed exactly as the corpse from Frenzy. * Lighting effects simulating a flashbulb, and the sound of flashbulbs going off are used during Shawn's dream sequence, and the sleeping Shawn flinches in reaction to the light effects in the same way that Raymond Burr reacted to them in Rear Window. * While Shawn is reviewing Hitchcock films and falls asleep, Yin paints a red \\"O\\" on the Psych window, leaving it to read \\"Psycho,\\" a reference to the film of the same name. * In an out-take, the crossword puzzle providing the clue that gives the location of the seat in which Yin sat at the theater was found (from a phone call to the newspaper made by Lassiter) to have been written by Ben McKenna, a name Gus recognizes as being a character from The Man Who Knew Too Much. * When suspecting Mary of being Yin, Shawn's line \\"Cat and mouse, cat and mouse. But which is the cat and which is the mouse?\\" is a direct quote from Rope. * When Shawn makes a realization about the case, a dolly zoom is used, in which the camera moves forwards while zooming out, creating distortion of the picture. This technique was famously used by Hitchcock in Vertigo. * While running towards Yin's clue, Lassiter is forced to duck underneath a low-flying plane, as Cary Grant's character Roger Thornhill must in North by Northwest. * Yang's aversion to colors and Mary's lost shoe are references to events in Marnie - the main character fears red and loses a shoe whilst committing a robbery. * While looking for Yin, Lassiter and O'Hara must climb a staircase to the 39th step, a reference to The 39 Steps. * Just before Mary is killed, he is shown walking up a staircase, as in Psycho. * In her cell, Yang exercises with a ball, rolling it to the corner then saying, \\"Roll it back, Reginald.\\" This could be a reference to silent film star Reginald Gardiner whose first screen appearance was in Hitchcock's 1926 The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog. * Yin's recreation of Hitchcock film sets included many props from Rear Window (overlooking window with wheelchair, in which Shawn sits and raises his left leg like Jimmy Stewart), Vertigo (Ernie's restaurant), The Man Who Knew Too Much (filmed scenes shown in rear window of the car in which Henry and Lassiter sit), Lifeboat (a lifesaver), The Birds, and Marnie (the car). * When Gus and Lassiter run up a staircase to save Juliet, the camera view is rotated and descends the tower stairways to look like an iconic scene from Vertigo. * While Gus and Shawn are in Mary's house, they notice that the number œÄ (pi) is written out on Mary's walls. This is a reference to the film Torn Curtain in which a character is named œÄ. * The tower clock is stopped (thus saving Juliet) at 4:29, a reference to Hitchcock's death on April 29, 1980. * Juliet's grey suit is reminiscent of Madeline's/Judy's in Vertigo's bell tower scene. Sequel The final installment of the Psych Yin/Yang trilogy, entitled \\"Yang 3 in 2D\\", aired on December 22, 2010 as the fifth season finale. The episode follows Shawn and Gus as they, along with Yang (Ally Sheedy) and the rest of the SBPD, attempt to track down and arrest Yin one final time.

Many of his designs were produced in collaboration with his brother George Richard who practised in Cork.Dictionary of Irish Architects - PAIN, JAMES Buildings St. Saviour's Dominican Church in Limerick, designed and built in 1815 by the Pain brothers. * The Market House, Mitchelstown * O‚ÄôNeill Crowley Bridge (formerly Brunswick Bridge), Cork * Saint George's Church, Mitchelstown - now Saint George's Arts and Heritage Centre * Mitchelstown Castle * St. James‚Äô Church, Mallow, County Cork St. James Church - Mallow Hub - Strategic Development Area * Dromoland Castle, County Clare Dromoland Castle - Hutchinson encyclopedia article about Dromoland Castle * Limerick Gaol * Athlunkard Bridge * Strancally Castle, County Waterford * Pery Square (Tontine terrace), Limerick * Toll House, Thomond Bridge, Limerick * St. Michael's Church, Pery Square * Adare Manor * Bank of Ireland, O'Connell Street, Limerick * Clarina Castle * Blackrock Castle * St Munchin's Church of Ireland, Limerick * Limerick Courthouse (alterations) * Convamore House, Ballyhooly, County Cork * Castletownroche Church of Ireland Church, County Cork * Castlehyde Church, Fermoy, County Cork ReferencesExternal links * https://web.archive.org/web/20110610100049/http://www.limerick.com/theroyal/thebook/architects.html Category:Irish architects Category:English ecclesiastical architects Category:1877 deaths Category:1779 births Category:Irish ecclesiastical architects Category:Architects of Roman Catholic churches ","title":"James Pain"},{"id":"26531937","text":"Principina a Mare () is an Italian seaside resort, a frazione of the comune of Grosseto, in the province of the same name. Overview The centre, less populated during winter, is mainly made up of houses of holidaymakers, hotels and a campsite. It is frequented due to its closeness to the mouth of the Ombrone river and to the Natural Park of Maremma. The largest number of tourists is registered in the months of July and August, the highest peaks being in the weeks around Ferragosto. The main touristic flux comes from the northern regions, such as Lombardy and Veneto, asides from centre-eastern Tuscany. Relevant is the presence of overseas tourists, mainly coming from the Netherlands, Austria, Germany and Switzerland; which however choose more the months of June and September. The coast south of Principina a Mare is characterized by wild beaches, which penetrate into the still marshy territories towards the Ombrone. This area, called Padule della Trappola, extends around the Tower of Trappola, a medieval fortification put to use for harvesting salt from some salt works now disappeared. Not far away stands the Chapel of Santa Maria della Trappola, whilst the Strillaie Chapel has its position on the outside of the marshy area, inside a farm situated near the Strada della Trappola, in proximity to the Principina a Mare crossing. The marshy area of the Trappola is ideal for birdwatching due to the large number of marshy birds which come to hibernate in this area. Recently a new itinerary P1 has been opened which crosses part of the area positioned inside the borders of the Natural Park of Maremma.

The taxonomy of this genus is highly uncertain. Most taxonomies have given this genus as having over a hundred species, but recent studies have synonymised dozens of species and found other names to be invalid. Some Menacanthus species remain to be discovered, or are synonymised in error. Menacanthus lice feed on the blood of a wide variety of birds, including chickens, by piercing the quills of feathers and gnawing the epidermis. In doing so, they can spread disease and lower egg production. In Menacanthus stramineus, eggs are incubated for four or five days, each of the three nymphal stages lasts for about three days, and adult life for about twelve days. Females produce as many as four eggs in a day, averaging 1.6 eggs a day, with egg production peaking 5‚Äì6 days after reaching adulthood. On sparrows, Menacanthus lice are particularly common, and are found in many different niches, consuming blood and feathers.

Jebb and Cheek's revision was based on \\"collaborative work by both authors since 1984, largely on herbarium specimens, but including fieldwork in New Guinea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Madagascar\\".Groves, M. 1997.

Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 27(3): 75. Content The authors recognised 82 species, including six described for the first time: N. argentii, N. aristolochioides, N. danseri, N. diatas, N. lamii, and N. murudensis. Additionally, N. macrophylla was raised to a species from infraspecific rank. Jebb and Cheek also included five \\"little known taxa\\": N. deaniana, N. junghuhnii, N. melamphora var. lucida, N. neglecta, and N. smilesii. Three taxa were excluded: N. cincta, N. cristata, and N. lindleyana. Three widespread natural hybrids were also covered. Jebb and Cheek revised several of the taxonomic determinations made in B. H. Danser's influential 1928 monograph, \\"The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies\\". This included the recognition of N. eustachya, N. hispida, N. ramispina, and N. sumatrana as distinct species, whereas previously they had been treated as heterotypic synonyms of N. alata, N. hirsuta, N. gracillima, and N. treubiana, respectively. Jebb and Cheek also reduced Danser's N. carunculata to N. bongso and N. leptochila to N. hirsuta. A number of more recently described species were also sunk in synonymy, including N. faizaliana and N. sandakanensis to synonyms of N. stenophylla, N. longifolia to a synonym of N. sumatrana, N. talangensis to a synonym of N. bongso, N. tenuis to a synonym of N. dubia, and N. xiphioides to a synonym of N. pectinata.Kurata, S. 2002. Proceedings of the 4th International Carnivorous Plant Conference: 111‚Äì116. The authors also lectotypified a number of names. Nepenthes of Borneo by Charles Clarke was published in the same year as Jebb and Cheek's revision. Unlike the latter work, however, it was primarily an ecological monograph and did not attempt to provide an alternative taxonomic interpretation of the Bornean taxa (with the exception of treating N. borneensis in synonymy with N. boschiana and retaining N. faizaliana as a distinct species).Clarke, C.M. 1997. Nepenthes of Borneo. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. However, several of the taxonomic revisions made by Jebb and Cheek were reversed in Clarke's subsequent monograph, Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia, published in 2001.

Schlauer disagreed with Jebb and Cheek's synonymisation of N. talangensis with N. bongso and their interpretation of N. stenophylla, which, according to Schlauer, served to perpetuate \\"Danser's misconception\\". \\"A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae)\\" was also reviewed by Zdenƒõk ≈Ω√°ƒçek in a 1997 issue of Trifid. ≈Ω√°ƒçek, Z. 1997.
