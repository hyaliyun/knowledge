Completed in July 2014, it is used mostly for athletics meets and was the main venue of the 2014 Asian Games. The stadium has been designed with an initial capacity of roughly 60,000 spectators. After the 2014 Asian Games, capacity was reduced to 30,000 spectators. The stadium has an oval running track enclosing a regulation-size soccer field. Outside, there's a tennis court, a subsidiary stadium, and the 1,415.13„é° Yeonhui Cricket Ground.Populous-designed Incheon Asiad Main Stadium to host opening and closing ceremony of the 17th Asian Games The main stadium was used for the opening and closing ceremony and athletics competitions of the 2014 Asian Games and 2014 Asian Para Games. Utilizing the long linear landscape from South to North to actively connect to surrounding parks, and the natural continuity of the rooftops to facilitate the approach by spectators, in order to overcome the difficulty of approaching the long site while emphasizing the potential of the area. It attempts to depict the movements of people with the lines and soft curvatures of dancing in order to link with Seungmu (Buddhist dance), and to express dynamic movement with the tide and wind, which represent the sea of Incheon. Design and Construction On April 17, 2007, Incheon was chosen as the venue for the 16-day Asiad that will be held from September to October 2014. The total number of participants is about 20,000: 13,000 athletes and officials and 7,000 media from 45 National Olympic Committees (NOC). Populous, the global architecture firm that also designed London's Olympic Stadium has designed the stadium in collaboration with Heerim Architects and Planners. The chief feature of the stadium is its sustainability. The design configures the main facilities towards the permanent western side, while the temporary seating spaces towards the eastern side. The temporary seating will be removed after the games. In the beginning of the stadium, the reflections of the traditional Buddhist ritual Seung Moo Dance is seen. It exhibits form and space around active movement. The forces of yin and yang form the nucleus of the architectural design. The stadium was built based on the three concepts of ‚Äúincorporating light,‚Äù ‚Äúbringing in the rising wind,‚Äù and ‚Äúdancing with joy‚Äù to embody the energy of Incheon and the excitement shared by the participating countries through sporting events. The five-story main stadium stretches across a total ground area of 113,620„é° and is designed to seat over 60,000 spectators. Its two huge roofs form delicate undulating curves and its overall shape looks like a spaceship, which blends perfectly with the vast lawn plaza. The surrounding areas of the main stadium were designed in an environment-friendly manner, including the Eco Canal that connects two streams flowing nearby and Biotope, a small-scale ecological habitat. The sculptures throughout the stadium grounds are also noteworthy. After Asian Games come to an end, the main stadium will be re-purposed into a multi-use space for a wider range of cultural eventsVisit Korea: Incheon Asiad Stadium The stadium uses eco- friendly energy, such as solar heat and terrestrial heat, as well as state-of- the-art information technologies (IT). Seven sports facilities such sports as swimming, volleyball, tennis and bowling will get under way. Transport The stadium has a total of 1,977 parking spaces. The stadium is served by 10 different bus stops (Line 1, 7, 13, 17, 17-1, 70, 77, 700, 700-1 and 903) and also 42-1 for 78m that is linked to downtown.

History=Origins The 138th Aero Squadron was organized on 28 September 1917 at Kelly Field, Texas. Prior to this, the men of the squadron had spent several weeks at various recruiting barracks around the country, and were brought to Kelly Field in August, before the formal organization of the unit. While there, they undertook infantry drill and camp duties. The men lived in tents and messed in the open, having to contend with the heat, wind and dust of the late Texas summer. The squadron was ordered to proceed to Post Field, Oklahoma, on 18 October where it was assigned for training by the 3d and 4th Aero Squadrons. At Post Field, the squadron received instruction in transportation, engineering, aero repair, flying field management, hangars, post headquarters and quartermaster supply duties. An outbreak of measles struck the squadron at Post Field, and it extended the amount of time that would normally be spent at the station. On 5 December the squadron began to train with some Curtiss R-4 aircraft, with several aviation cadets taking primary flight training. Finally on 16 February, the men of the squadron were examined for overseas duty and were ordered to prepare for service in France. On 18 February, along with the 137th Aero Squadron, the squadron departed for the Aviation Concentration Center, Mineola Field, Long Island, New York. After receiving equipment, it moved to the Port of Entry, Hoboken, New Jersey, on 5 March and boarded the RMS Cedric, a White Star Liner impressed into troop ship duty. The trans-Atlantic voyage to Liverpool, England, was uneventful, and the squadron arrived on 18 March. It then proceeded by train to the Romsey Rest Camp, Winchester. Training in England At Romsey the squadron was detached to the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) for advanced training. It was sent to RFC Montrose, Scotland, arriving on 26 March, where it was assigned to the RFC's 5th Wing. The training the squadron had received in the United States enabled it to make a valuable contribution to the wing's activities. By the beginning of August the squadron was eager to go to the front, and on the 14th it departed Montrose for Flower Down Rest Camp, Winchester, having been ordered to duty in France. Western Front Arriving on the 17th, transportation was scarce and it did not arrive at Cherbourg, France, until the 19th before moving to the Replacement Concentration Center, AEF, at St. Maixent Replacement Barracks, where it arrived on the 22d. There, the squadron was equipped with steel helmets, firearms and gas masks. It was also designated as a Pursuit Squadron. From St. Maixent, the squadron then proceeded to the Air Service Production Center No. 2, Romorantin Aerodrome, arriving on 29 August. At Romorantin, the squadron was engaged in fatigue and garrison duties. Next, it went to the 1st Air Depot, Colombey-les-Belles Airdrome on 20 September. There, all preparations were made for active service as a Pursuit Squadron, with pilots and an armament officer being assigned. On 5 November, sixteen British Sopwith Camel F.1s were assigned to the squadron. On the 14th, together with the 41st and 638th Aero Squadrons, the 138th traveled from Colombey to its new aerodrome at Lay-Saint-Remy. Post-Armistice activities At Lay-Saint-Remy Aerodrome, the three squadrons constituted the 5th Pursuit Group, Air Service, Second Army. Despite the signing of the Armistice, the squadron continued to engage in flying and undertook proficiency flights, and training in formation flying, patrols and in air combat on schedule each day when the weather permitted, although all flying was performed in friendly territory. Demonstration flying was also performed for various events to thrill crowds and to demonstrate to the other branches of the service the capabilities of the Air Service. The pilots were skilled in aerobatic flying, and no accidents resulted from these exhibitions.Series \\"P\\", Volume 1, History of Headquarters, Third Army Air Service. Gorrell's History of the American Expeditionary Forces Air Service, 1917‚Äì1919, National Archives, Washington, D.C. On 15 April 1919, orders were received that the Second Army Air Service was being demobilized. The entire 5th Pursuit Group was ordered to Coblenz, Germany, to become part of the Third Army Air Service. The squadron prepared for the journey, and their equipment and supplies were moved the 200-odd miles in their own trucks. The enlisted personnel moved by rail and also by truck, while the pilots ferried their aircraft to their new airfield in the Rhineland.Series \\"O\\", Volume 22, Weekly Statistical Reports on progress of Air Service Activities, October 1918 ‚Äì May 1919. Gorrell's History of the American Expeditionary Forces Air Service, 1917‚Äì1919, National Archives, Washington, D.C. The squadron established itself in Fort Kaiser Alexander, which had been built by Wilhelm Hohenzollern's grandfather. The fort commanded a high ridge between the Rhine and Moselle rivers, overlooking the city. At Coblenz, the groups flew their assigned aircraft, and also performed test flights on surrendered German aircraft. Flights of the Fokker D.VII, Pfalz D.XII, Halberstadts, and Rumpler aircraft were made and evaluations made. Demobilization The entire air service of the Third Army, except that of the III Corps Observation Group at Wei√üenthurm Airdrome, were relieved from further duty, on 12 May 1919 and ordered demobilized. Yet, the 138th Aero Squadron seems to have stayed for some time in Koblenz with Third Army Air Service, as it did not reached the 1st Air Depot at Colombey-les-Belles Airdrome, France before 1 July, for subsequent demobilization. The squadron's Sopwith aircraft were delivered to the Air Service American Air Service Acceptance Park No. 1 at Orly Aerodrome to be returned to the British. There practically all of the pilots and observers were detached from the Squadron. Personnel at Colombey were subsequently assigned to the Commanding General, Services of Supply and ordered to report to one of several staging camps in France. There, personnel awaited scheduling to report to one of the Base Ports in France for transport to the United States.Series \\"D\\", Weekly Statistical Reports of Air Service Activities, October 1918 ‚Äì May 1919.

Under Belgian law, no legal bond between an unmarried mother and her child resulted from the mere fact of birth.

The show has earned high ratings by GSN's standards; despite this, it has also received mixed critical reception. The series gives three contestants the chance to win the eye of a prospective date. The contestants each have three suitcases onstage: a small, medium, and large one. Each suitcase contains an embarrassing, gross, unique, or weird proposition the contestant may have. These cases represent the \\"baggage\\" to which they will confess and defend. As the suitcase size increases, so does the level of shame or embarrassment the secret carries. Once the three contestants are pared down to one, the potential dater must admit to a fault of his or her own. Gameplay The game is played by first introducing the central character. Three contestants are then introduced, each accompanied by three pieces of baggage: a small one, a medium one, and a large one, with each one containing a corresponding secret. The central contestant also has a piece of baggage of his or her own, which is only revealed at the end of the show. During the show, three possible secrets about the central contestant are given, one of which is the actual secret contained in their baggage. These secrets can include bad habits, strange relationship preferences, issues with one's past, or strange hobbies. After the three other contestants are introduced, they each open the smallest piece of baggage, and explain the secrets they contain. In the second segment, Springer reveals the second piece of baggage, contained in the medium-sized suitcase. The suitcases are placed in random order, so the central character does not know to whom each belongs. The three contestants are placed on the other side of the stage, along with the central contestant. Only the three contestants know which piece of baggage belongs to whom. The main contestant chooses the piece of baggage which is the \\"deal breaker\\" (i.e., the one secret that they cannot accept). After stating this, the contestants then return to the other side of the stage and reveal which suitcase belongs to them. The person who claims the deal breaker baggage is immediately eliminated, and later backstage reveals the largest piece of baggage that would have been shown in the final round. The central contestant and two remaining contestants discuss the secrets in the medium pieces of baggage; the two contestants then plead their cases as to why they should be the central contestant's choice. Springer then asks the two remaining contestants, one at a time, a few questions (usually five or six each) about their personal lives. The two contestants then open their largest pieces of baggage and reveal the secrets they contain. Each contestant makes one final statement, and the main contestant eliminates a second contestant. The main contestant's own baggage is then opened and the contents revealed to the remaining contestant. If the contestant accepts the secret belonging to the central character, the couple is given an expense-covered evening together. However, if the contestant can not accept the secret, the pair part ways. Production Host Jerry Springer in January 2011 The series was officially announced on March 23, 2010, with Jerry Springer being confirmed as the host. The original series was produced by Comcast Entertainment Group; Jay James and Tim Puntillo served as executive producers. On July 26, 2010, GSN announced plans to renew the show for a second season, which began airing on August 16, 2010. A syndication test run was shown on a select group of Sinclair Broadcast Group's stations January 10, 2011. The series began airing in syndication in the United States in September 2012, becoming the first original program in the network's history to achieve such a feat. A third season began airing on June 6, 2011. During season three, a half-hour special entitled Baggage First Dates aired during a five-hour \\"Best of Baggage Marathon.\\" The special followed a couple who had previously appeared on the show talking to Springer about what happened on their first date following their appearance. A fourth season of the show premiered on March 14, 2012. With GSN‚Äôs Executive Vice President of Programming, Amy Introcaso-Davis, citing that the series continued to remain \\"extremely popular\\" in reruns, GSN announced plans to order twenty episodes of a traveling version of the series. The spin-off, entitled Baggage on the Road, follows an identical format to its predecessor while traveling to tape episodes in various U.S. cities. Prior to the spin- off, a one-hour special entitled Baggage: Most Outrageous Moments aired on January 1, 2015, featuring highlights from the original series' run. The spin- off premiered on January 7, 2015, Wilshire Studios produced the revival with Lisa Tucker serving as executive producer. Reception The show quickly became a ratings success for GSN, becoming the highest-rated weekday series in the network's history. The original series averaged 473,000 viewers during its first season, while the 2015 version saw a season-high of 524,000 viewers for its only season. Despite earning respectable ratings by GSN's standards, Baggage received mixed critical reviews. Carrie Grosvenor of About Entertainment argued that the series \\"isn't exactly must-see TV, but it's entertaining enough to catch an episode here and there.\\" Additionally, Josef Adalian of The Wrap gave a negative pre-review of the show, calling it and Springer \\"GSN's latest bad idea.\\" In 2012, however, Baggage appeared in Entertainment Weekly as a \\"top guilty pleasure,\\" and was also featured in the HBO television series Girls. Writing for Yahoo!, Gabrielle Rice called the series \\"very entertaining,\\" and argued Springer to be \\"the perfect host for the show.\\" June Thomas, writing for Slate, opened her review by calling the series \\"real, and... spectacular.\\" Additionally, Jordan Carr of The Awl titled his review, \\"Jerry Springer's Baggage Is The Greatest TV Show Ever.\\" Carr called the formula of the show \\"brilliant\\" despite it being \\"predictable and not that exciting.\\" The series has also spawned Australian and British versions under the same title.

However, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had issued a STA for the station to operate at 102.9 MHz due to the move-in of a commercial station (KWLZ-FM) licensed to West Linn, Oregon. The station signed on the air February 7, 2009, and was owned by the Western Oregon Radio Club, Inc. (WORC), an amateur radio organization. On January 1, 2012, KQSO-LP undertook an affiliation with the WORC Oldies Network, which syndicates broadcast material to other low-power radio stations interested in amateur radio. Programming included amateur (ham) radio news, educational material, comedy, oldies, and adult standard music. Veteran disc jockey (DJ) \\"The Vegetable Man\\", who was local to Pacific Northwest radio in the 1960s, was also broadcast by the network with periodic shows daily. On December 25, 2014, the station signed permanently off the air due to a FM translator in Portland signing on the air on the same frequency as KQSO-LP. Due to the translator's overpowering signal, KQSO-LP's signal was impeded. A decision was made to cease operation. Early in 2014, the WORC applied to the FCC for another LPFM station in Portland. As such, the FCC granted the WORC a CP for KISN-LP. On May 1, 2015, KISN-LP went on the air and was subsequently licensed by the FCC. See KISN (Portland) for more details.

The city of Tudela in northern Spain, was the oldest and most important Jewish community in the former Kingdom of Navarre.  Organisation under Christian rule  When King Alfonso the Battler captured Tudela from the Muslims in 1119 it contained a large number of Jews. In fact, several of Tudela's better-known Jews were born during the time of Muslim political control, although Benjamin of Tudela was probably born soon after the Christian conquest. The Jews were not content with a fuero (charter) granted in 1121 by the conqueror, and suspecting that their safety was threatened, they decided to emigrate; only at the special request of Alfonso and on his promise that they should be granted municipal rights similar to those of N√°jera, did the Jews consent to remain. Subsequent tensions are suggested by the fact that Sancho VI of Navarre (known as \\"The Wise\\") in 1170 confirmed all the rights which Alfonso had granted them and assigned to them the castle precincts as a Jewish quarter. The king gave them a tax exemption on condition they maintained their section of the fortifications; he permitted them freely to sell their houses located in the former Juder√≠a; and he allowed them to establish a cemetery outside the city. He also showed tolerance in his regulation of their legal status.Meyer Kayserling, Geschichte der Juden in Spanien, i. 197. In the Juder√≠a there was a large synagogue (repaired in 1401) and several smaller ones. The Jewish community had its own magistrates, comprising two presidents and twenty representatives (regidoros), who drew up new statutes, inflicted penalties, excluded from membership in the community, and pronounced the ban. In 1359, the Jews of Tudela petitioned Don Luis, brother and representative of King Charles II, that they might be allowed to punish those Jews who violated their religious regulations. In a statute drawn up in March 1363 by the representatives of the community, it was decided to deal energetically with informers and slanderers. This statute was publicly read in all the synagogues on the Day of Atonement and, in 1400, it was renewed for a period of forty years.The statute is given in Kayserling, l.c. pp. 206 et seq.  Professions and economic activities  The Jews of Tudela followed various occupations. They traded in grain, wool, cloth and even, under Muslim rule, slaves. There were among them tanners, who were obliged to pay 35 sueldos a year to the king for the use of their tannery, which was situated on the river Ebro. Jewish shoemakers and gold- and silver-workers had their shops in a special market-place, for which in the year 1269 they paid 1,365 sueldos to Theobald II. They had also their own motalafla, or gagers' bureau, where their weights and measures were subjected to official inspection. They engaged in money-lending also, while some of them - Don Joseph and Don Ezmel de Ablitas, for example - had large commercial houses. The farming of the taxes likewise was in their hands. Solomon and Jacob Baco and Ezmel Falaquera were tax farmers, and Nathan Gabai was chief farmer of the taxes. Scholars Tudela was the birthplace or residence of a number of Jewish scholars, the most famous of whom were the scholar Judah ha-Levi (c. 1075-1141) and the 12th-century traveller Benjamin of Tudela, the account of whose travels was translated into several languages, and is still a valuable historical source. Chayyim ben Samuel (author of the \\"Tzeror ha-Chayyim\\"), Shem-T'ob ben Isaac Shaprut (philosopher and apologist), and several members of the learned Minir family were born in the city. The cabalist Abraham Abulafia passed his youth in Tudela. Other rabbis of Tudela are known: Joshua ibn Shuaib, author of sermons, kabbalist and student of Rabbi Solomon ibn Aderet who flourished in the 14th century; Joel ibn Shu'aib, author of sermons and Bible commentaries; and Chasdai ben Solomon, who flourished in the 15th century. Sources differ as to whether Rabbi Abraham Ibn Ezra was born in Tudela or Toledo - he is famous as a poet, grammarian, mathematician, and astronomer - he has a lunar crater named after him (Abenezra).  Physicians  Like his grandfather, who had for his body-physicians the Jews Don Joseph and Don Moses Aben Samuel, King Sancho VI also had a Jewish physician, named Solomon, to whom he not only granted baronial rights in the whole kingdom, but also gave farm-land and vineyards in two villages near Tudela. Further, in 1193, a few months before his death, he granted Solomon also proprietary rights in the bath located in front of the Albazares gate. Economic decline The Jews of Tudela, whose 500 families had by 1363 diminished to 270, were greatly oppressed by the taxes imposed on them by the king. These in 1346 and the following years had amounted to 2,000 livres annually, and in 1375 to 3,382 livres. In addition, the Jews had to pay subsidies from time to time. In consequence of the war with Castile and owing to the ravages of the plague in 1379 and 1380, the community continued to decrease in numbers till in 1386 there were scarcely 200 Jewish families in the city, and these were so poor that the taxes could not be collected from them.  Persecution  In February 1235, Tudela was the scene of a rebellion against the government, when many Jews were wounded and several were sacrificed to the rage of the populace. Peace was restored only through a treaty between King Theobald I and the city council.Kayserling, l.c. pp. 200 et seq. The Shepherds' Crusade of 1321 affected Tudela. About 30,000 rapacious murderers fell upon the Jews in Tudela, killing many of them. When, some time later, 500 (or, according to other accounts, 300) made another attempt to surprise the Jews, they were overcome by a knight who lay in wait for them. Out of gratitude to Providence for their escape from this danger, the wealthier Jews endeavored to alleviate the condition of their coreligionists who had suffered from the persecutions. They collected grain and oil in storehouses, and supported poor Jews therefrom for a period of three years. In the great persecution of 1328, during which 6,000 Jews perished in Navarre, those of Tudela did not escape. In 1492, the Jews were expelled from the dominions of Ferdinand and Isabella, sovereigns of Castile and Aragon, by the Alhambra Decree. The Jewish population of Tudela was increased by the arrival of refugees from other parts of Spain. In 1498, King John III of Navarre, under the influence of Ferdinand and Isabella, issued an edict to the effect that all Jews must either be baptized or leave the country. In Tudela, 180 families received baptism. The converts, or conversos, were suspected of being Marranos, or secret Jews. Many of them emigrated a few years later to France. The names of the conversos were published in a great roll called \\"La Manta\\" and exposed in the nave of Tudela's cathedral until the end of the 18th century. Tudela still preserves some Hebrew documents in its archives. Also buildings associated with the Jewish community have survived to the present day.

When series creators/executive producers Cheryl Heuton and Nicolas Falacci learned that the number of episodes airing during the season was reduced, they felt that they needed to finish storylines in case the series was cancelled. To do so, they wrote an open-ended story to serve as either a season finale or a series finale.

Plot summary Drs. Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz) and Amita Ramanujan (Navi Rawat) are married at CalSci. Charlie's father Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch), Charlie's older brother FBI Special Agent Don Eppes (Rob Morrow), and friends FBI Special Agents David Sinclair (Alimi Ballard), Colby Granger (Dylan Bruno), Nikki Betancourt (Sophina Brown), and Assistant United States Attorney Robin Brooks (Michelle Nolden) attend the ceremony. Charlie and Amita's friend and colleague Dr. Larry Fleinhardt (Peter MacNicol) officiates. After receiving a call from FBI Special Agent Liz Warner (Aya Sumika), Don and David leave the reception to arrest Ted Dacosta (Luke Rosen), a man wanted on fraud charges. During the arrest, a man who has just learned that Decosta had swindled him tackles Don and David. The tackle knocks Don's gun away from him. Someone picks the gun up and walks away from the scene. A member of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) questions Don about the incident, and Don completes the required paperwork. Nikki contacts her former colleagues at the LAPD for assistance. At Charlie's house, Alan and Charlie notice that Don is upset about losing his gun. Charlie offers to help his brother locate the gun, but Don refuses, citing Charlie and Amita's upcoming visiting professorships at Cambridge. Don receives a call about two drug dealers who were fatally shot with Don's gun. None of the neighbors appear upset about the dealers' deaths. A tip from LAPD leads the FBI team to the leader of the community crime watch. He insists that he did not have the gun but later confesses to possessing it when presented with contradictory evidence. Don confesses to Robin that he feels that the search for his gun could determine his future with the FBI. Robin replies that the current case should not influence his decision. Meanwhile, FBI technician Matt Li (Matthew Yang King) discovers many references to Don's gun as a vigilante gun on several social networking sites. Charlie, Amita, Larry, and Otto Bahnoff (John Cariani), a plasma physicist who has assisted the FBI on two previous cases, use the small world network to track the gun. While discussing the math, Don and Charlie agree that, although they had spent their lives apart from each other, they want to keep the relationship they have with each other. The team receives another call, this time leading them to the body of a woman who planned to drink and drive without a driver's license. Amita, Charlie, Larry, and Otto find a woman who used her real personal information on a web site which referenced Don's gun. The woman tells the agents that she passed the gun to someone named Jim. Don and David question Jim Mazzolla (David Burke), who claims that his neighbor Michael Hiller (Vyto Ruginis) had been bullying Mazzolla and his family. Both Mazzolla and Hiller deny being in possession of Don's gun. With Charlie's analysis and further investigation, the agents discover that Mazzolla, a criminal, was in the area where Don lost his gun the day of the incident. Don and David return to Mazzolla's house, where they discover Mazzolla's son, Jim Jr., (Bridger Zadina) holding Hiller at gunpoint. Don wrestles the gun from Jim Jr. and arrests Hiller on unspecified charges. FBI Special Agent Ian Edgerton (Lou Diamond Phillips) suddenly appears to escort Hiller. Ian informs Don and David that the team's earlier background check on Hiller, an escaped prisoner from Florida, alerted Ian to Hiller's location. Ian also expresses disappointment about not being able to attend Charlie and Amita's wedding. At the FBI office, Colby, Liz, and Nikki discuss David's new promotion to team leader of an anti-corruption team based from the Washington, DC FBI field office.

Production=Writing Citing a decrease in ratings, CBS reduced Numb3rs' episode order, the number of episodes airing per season, from 22 to 16 on November 4, 2009. Although the series had high ratings for the night, the 18-49 demographic was not as strong. CBS also wanted to air a series during the middle of the season. For the cast and crew, the announcement about the reduction in the episode order came during the production of the eleventh episode of the sixth season. Series creators/executive producers Cheryl Heuton and Nicolas Falacci, who wrote \\"Cause and Effect\\", developed the episode to be a season finale that could also serve as a series finale in case the show was cancelled. They decided to write the episode in a way in which fans would see some kind of resolution of storylines in the event that the series was cancelled. They included some closure to several storylines, especially David's storyline and to one of Don's storylines. To finish the season's storyline, several plot lines had to be modified by removing some individual stories within the season's main storyline or by revising some stories. For example, writers had planned for Charlie and Amita's wedding to be ornate with 200 people and with Amita's parents in attendance. Heuton and Falacci changed it to a small wedding at CalSci with Larry officiating the ceremony. Reception Although network executives originally scheduled the episode to air in May and then in February, they scheduled \\"Cause and Effect\\" to air on March 12, 2010. Over 8.34 million people in the United States watched \\"Cause and Effect\\", making it the 101st most watched series finale of all time. Critically, the television critics focused on the idea of the episode being a series finale, but several critics commented on the episode. Rob Owen, a television critic with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, stated, \\"Kudos to them [the producers of Numb3rs] for rewarding long-time fans by crafting the season finale to also function as a series finale.\\" Matt Roush of TV Guide Magazine's web site was surprised by the amount of closure in the episode. David Johnson, a reviewer for DVD Verdict, felt that the episode was excellent. Cancellation of the series When CBS executives made the announcement about the order cut, CBS executives cautioned that it was too early to know whether Numb3rs would be cancelled. When asked about the fate of Numb3rs, CBS executive Nina Tassler stated that executives cut the order for Numb3rs to air Miami Medical, which was scheduled to air midseason. Television critics expected Numb3rs to end at the end of the 2009-2010 television season. Citing a decline in ratings and a need to debut new series, CBS announced on May 18, 2010, that Numb3rs was cancelled, making \\"Cause and Effect\\" the series finale.

One part of its settlement (Pusztaszentp√©ter) is now extinct. In the area of today's village, to the west of Als√≥cs√∂de, was the village of Szentm√°rton. Traces of the church, which was destroyed in the early 1600s and of the Pauline monastery here, are still visible today and are marked by a plaque.

In the episode, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and mathematicians attempt to determine the cause of a fatal train accident while several agents attempt to rescue survivors. When it was originally scheduled to air as the fourth episode of the season, \\"Thirty-Six Hours\\" occurred in the middle of a story arc launched by the season four season finale. When the real-life Chatsworth train derailment occurred two weeks after filming the episode, the accident forced a revision of the script to include episodic events that occurred after the end of the story arc. To simulate both the crash and the rescue effort, series production designer Bill Eigenbrodt and Numb3rs art department had to build two sets, the inside of a crushed railcar and a tent in which first responders coordinated the rescue effort. Eigenbrodt and his production crew also had to simulate the actual wreckage using real railcars placed along a stretch of open track. Eigenbrodt and the production crew also had to design the robots that appear in the episode. \\"Thirty-Six Hours\\" first aired in the United States on November 21, 2008. Critics gave the episode a positive review. Plot summary A freight train and a passenger train collide with each other. Several people on the passenger train are killed, and others are trapped in the wreckage. Suspecting terrorism, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) calls FBI Special Agents Don Eppes (Rob Morrow), David Sinclair (Alimi Ballard), Colby Granger (Dylan Bruno), and Nikki Betancourt (Sophina Brown) to the scene. Don leaves David and Colby at the scene to rescue survivors while he and Nikki talk to a conductor who had jumped out of the train before it crashed. Nikki attempts to tie the conductor's deceased crew-mate, who stayed on the crashing train trying to apply the breaks and has Syrian origin, to a terrorist plot. Don feels that the wreck was unrelated to terrorist activities. At CalSci, Dr. Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz), Don's younger brother and a FBI math consultant, demonstrates a group of swarmbots, robots which can gather information using infotaxis, the use of information to create a map of the robots' environment, to Don and their father, Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch). Charlie tells Don the swarmbots could map the wreck in order to find survivors. Charlie arrives at the crash site and inserts the swarmbots into the wreckage. At the FBI office, Don calls Dr. Amita Ramanujan (Navi Rawat), Charlie's girlfriend and a fellow FBI consultant, to determine whether mechanical failure caused the crash. Don and Nikki question several other people, including a former member of the mob who is now a legitimate businessman, the freighter train's owner, and a rail master. Back at the crash site, David and Colby pull a woman out alive. She is concerned about her asthmatic son, who was with her at the time of the crash. The mother calls her son's cell phone, and she and David talk to the boy for a while to keep him calm. Amita finds that two switches must be thrown in order for a train to switch tracks. Upon a suggestion from Alan, Amita realizes that someone threw the second switch a few minutes too late. Don calls the rail master back in for questioning. During the interview, Don learns that the rail master has had a lack of sleep and left his post a couple of minutes before the crash to rouse himself. Back at the crash site, David loses contact with the boy. Movement inside the railcar crushes the swarmbots, leaving Charlie without a visual of the inside of the railcar. Impatient with Charlie, David enters the railcar with the boy's inhaler. Don arrives at the scene as Colby enters the wreckage after David. David and Colby find the boy and a rail worker who has been with the boy since the crash alive and rescue them. Charlie realizes that the freight train's momentum should have stopped it. Don learns that the freight train's owner misrepresented the train's weight, and Don and Nikki then arrest the owner. Production=Filming Series production designer Bill Eigenbrodt and the crew found a private track about 30 minutes outside of Los Angeles which contained a bowl. The crew found a place along an open track in which to stage the wreck. Working in a berm, they spent several days planning and setting up the wreck, which consisted of 18 cars. Using a crane, Eigenbrodt and the art crew spent two days arranging the cars to give the appearance of a train wreck. Eigenbrodt and Holcomb used several techniques to convey a sense of urgency. Eigenbrodt and the art department built the tanker in the episode, and Eigenbrodt placed the tanker in the valley. Holcomb also used shots of the city. At the site, smoke from the crash conveyed the sense of danger both at night and during the day. To film the train crash, Numb3rs photography director Ron Garcia used handheld Panasonic P2s and handheld digital cameras. They used a tinted car and a moving camera to create the illusion that the train was moving along the track at night. It took the production crew three nights to film the night scenes. The realistic setup of the wreck upset the cast and the crew. Several of the actors were alarmed by the site of the crash. The site frightened director Rod Holcomb, and he became concerned about the actors' safety inside the cars once filming started. Eigenbrodt built a set on the Numb3rs soundstage at the LA Center Studio for the actors to climb through. He and the art department found and used metal to simulate the inside of the damaged car. Once safety officials deemed the wreckage in the field safe for the actors, Eigenbrodt and Holcomb decided to let the actors climb through the wreckage at the site. Due to time constraints in the production schedule, the crew set up a tent in the field and built a similar set at the studio's soundstage. To maintain a sense of realism, several area firefighters and paramedics assisted with the technical aspects of the rescue. The crew bought the supplies needed at the crash site from emergency suppliers. The art department designed the swarmbots used in the episode. They place electronic circuitry on top of several remote-controlled cars. During filming, six people operated the cars. Later, to simulate the movement of the bots through the crash site, the art department attached candlecams to sticks with wheels. Writing \\"Thirty-Six Hours\\" was originally scheduled to air fourth, placing it in the middle of the storyline about Charlie's security clearance. In the original script, Charlie volunteered at the scene with his friend and fellow FBI consultant Dr. Larry Fleinhardt (Peter MacNicol). Two days before filming, series regular Peter MacNicol had to leave the set due to an emergency, causing writers to rewrite MacNicol's part for Krumholtz. In the script that was filmed, Don expressed doubts about staying with the FBI. Alan suggested that Don was being investigated because he was not interested in office politics. Don then told Alan that he threatened to quit the FBI if Charlie did not get his clearance back. Charlie walked in as Don received the phone call about the train crash. Later at CalSci, Charlie explained to Alan how the college's swarmbots operated. Don, looking for Amita, walked in on Alan and Charlie's conversation. After Alan left to see the swarmbots enter Charlie's office, Charlie confronted Don about Don's avoidance of Charlie. Don tried to pass it off as a national security issue but then tells Charlie about the crash. When the brothers reached Charlie's office, Charlie persuaded Don to allow Charlie's assistance in the investigation by mentioning that many people assisting investigators at the site lacked security clearances. While Amita attempted to discover the cause of the crash, Alan expressed concern about Charlie being punished for helping investigators without a security clearance. Amita reassured Alan that Charlie would not because the wreck was not a national security issue. After the arrest and the cleanup, Don thanked Charlie for helping out with the investigation. Don then told Charlie about Don leaving the FBI if Charlie did not receive his clearance. Charlie decided not to pursue the reinstatement of his clearance any further. Don reminded Charlie of Don's own recent ethical violations and insisted that loyalty to Charlie was the right thing to do. Writer Julie H√©bert built the use of a clock into the script. The use of a clock was rare for Numb3rs. The plot device had been used once before in the episode \\"One Hour\\", written by Ken Sanzel. For \\"One Hour\\", Sanzel felt that using a real-time therapy session would be an interesting way to tell a story. When writing the episode, he structured the case around the therapy session. The description of the train switches came from how airports determine whether a flight is on time. Post-production Two weeks after filming the episode, the Chatsworth train accident occurred. Due to the similarities between the real-life wreck and the crash depicted in the episode, CBS delayed airing the episode. To include the reinstatement of Charlie's clearance in the script, editors had to cut several scenes referring to Charlie volunteering at the scene. For the Numb3rs season five DVDs, the editors created a bonus feature containing the deleted scenes. Feeling that the audience would assume that the episode was written after the Chatsworth crash, the producers added a disclaimer stating that the episode was filmed before the real-life events. Reception Jeffrey Robinson of DVD Talk highlighted \\"Thirty-Six Hours\\" in his list of \\"exciting episodes\\".

Its architecture is of a Late Gothic style, corresponding to the start of construction in the 15th century, with Baroque aspects dating from the 17th century. The building, completed in the 17th century, has been designated by the Spanish government as an Historic-Artistic Monument (Monumento Hist√≥rico-Art√≠stico). It was declared Bien de Inter√©s Cultural in 1856. The Renaissance entryway, designed by Andr√©s de Ribera, is of particular interest, as are the Chapel of Santa Mar√≠a, and the small Gothic cloister designed by Juan Mart√≠nez Monta√±√©s. The choir stalls are by Juan de Oviedo de la Bandera (1565‚Äì1625); they were originally made for the Convento-Iglesia de la Merced in Sanl√∫car de Barrameda and were transferred to the monastery in 1960. The paintings by Juan de la Roelas currently at the monastery also come from that church. Conversely, the Museo de C√°diz preserves numerous paintings by Francisco Zurbar√°n that were originally from the monastery. Nowadays, the Sisters of Bethlehem, of the Assumption of the Virgin, and of Saint Bruno continue the long Roman Catholic monastic and spiritual tradition that had been carried on more than five centuries by the Carthusian fathers.  History  Renaissance entry of the Monastery. The impulse behind the monastery dates back to Alvaro Obertos de Valeto, a knight of Genovese descent, appointed during the Reconquista by Alfonso X of Castile to defend the city shortly Alfonso had conquered it from Muslim rule in 1264. Lacking descendants, he left his fortune to establish a Carthusian monastery in the city. It was not until 1475 that this location near the Guadalete River was chosen, of special significance because in 1368 it has been the site of a victorious battle against invaders; the victory was attributed to intercession by the Virgin Mary, to whom a hermitage had been dedicated on the site, under the name Nuestra Se√±ora de la Defensi√≥n (\\"Our Lady of the Defense\\"), which was adopted also for the monastery. At the entrance of the enclosure stands a wide tetrastyle portico with a semicircular central span which holds, in a smaller span, two heavy sheets of wood studded with bronze. This work, begun in 1571 by Jerezan architect Andr√©s de Ribera, conforms to the purest canons of Andalusian classicism. Conceived as a great triumphal arch, it is composed in a sober manner and decorated with coats of arms, canopies, fretwork windows, and glazed ceramic hemispheres, constituting a superb example of Renaissance architecture. At the beginning of the 17th century, with the original plan almost complete, new works were undertaken, such as the fa√ßade of the church, which was totally renovated in 1667 in a clearly Baroque style, following the plans of Brother Pedro del Pi√±ar, who also placed atop the crests of the church and refectory niche sculptures by Francisco de G√°lvez. Like a veritable stone altarpiece, this fa√ßade is conceived in two orders superposed on Corinthian columns and curved and divided entablatures, supported on a base decorated with coats of arms and floral themes. The ornate decor of pilasters and friezes, the superposition of vases, and the airy top, with a much reduced third rank of imagery make this fa√ßade a singular element of the Andalucian Baroque. Paintings by Francisco Zurbar√°n in the Museo de C√°diz, originally from the monastery.

In 1810, during the Peninsular War, the French invaders used the monastery as a barracks, and damaged or destroyed much of the complex that had been assembled over the prior three centuries. The monks were obligated to seek refuge in C√°diz, and when they returned, it was to a desolate, sacked monastery. Restored and returned to its original use, and now in a good state of conservation, the monastery was designated a Monumento nacional in 1856, one of the first dozen or so places in Spain to be so designated. More recently, it has been designated an Historic-Artistic Monument. It can be reached by the CA-2004, accessed from the Autov√≠a A-381.

The airport located at the end of an unnamed road, one mile (1.6 km) east of CA Route 177 (Desert Center - Rice Road), northeast of San Diego. History=World War II use Desert Center Army Air Field (AAF) was built in the early 1940s was a subbase of Thermal Army Air Field and served as a support base for the Air Technical Service Command near Camp Desert Center. The airfield was located within the Desert Center Division Camp, which encompassed over . Desert Center was one of the areas included in the California Arizona Maneuver Area, used during 1942-44 to train General Patton's armored forces for desert combat prior to it deploying to North Africa. Desert Center AAF was first known as the Desert Center Airdrome. According to a history of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Airdrome Detachments, a detachment of the 475th Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron was the first administrative unit stationed at Desert Center, arriving on 15 January 1943. It was described as having 5,500' runways. The field also had taxiways and a parking apron. More than 40 buildings were constructed at the airfield, including an operations building, power house, Link Trainer building, hangar and various supply buildings. The 74th Reconnaissance Group was the first flying unit at the field, arriving in December 1942 while the facility was under construction. It was variously equipped with O-52s, L-1s, L-4s, B-25s, P-39s and P-40s and trained to provide air support and reconnaissance to the Army ground forces training at the desert combat training facility.00099366 Desert Center AAF was officially opened in April 1943. The 3d Airdrome Detachment was activated on 1 August to maintain the installation and assist in the administration and training of tactical organizations stationed at the airfield for training and maneuvers.USAFHRA Document 00011254 When the training area closed in 1944, the airfield was assigned to the Fourth Air Force, and operational activities decreased greatly. The airfield remained open, however, and was used by B-24 Liberator crews flying training missions from March Field. Civil use In 1946, following the end of World War II, the airfield was turned over to the Army Corps of Engineers, and the buildings were auctioned off to the public. It was listed as \\"Desert Center CAA Site 17\\" in the \\"Aerodromes\\" table on the 1955 San Diego Sectional Aeronautical Chart. It described the field as having two 5,000' bituminous runways. The airfield was listed among active airports in the 1962 AOPA Airport Directory, under the name of \\"FAA Site 17\\". It was described as having two 5,000 ft bituminous runways: 13/31 & 4/22, and the operator was listed as the FAA. It was closed in the mid-1960s, but listed as an emergency airfield. The airport was reopened as a civil airport (owned by Riverside County) at some point between 1966 and 2002. However, as of 2002 it was all but abandoned. There were no aircraft based at the field, and the Airport Facility Directory data listed a mere 150 takeoffs and landings per year. The sole remaining maintained runway is 5/23, which consists of a 4,200 ft asphalt strip which was overlaid over remains of the original military runway. Two buildings were still standing. Recent history Today, there are remains of Patton‚Äôs army all around the airport including foundations from the old buildings and pieces of discarded equipment mixed in with the remains of old agriculture and vandalism. The abandoned Runway 13/31 is barely discernible, covered with sand and bushes. There are no historic buildings left, although there are numerous foundations and a concrete parking ramp. In 2003, the airfield was being used to fly unmanned aircraft. The hangar had been converted to a workshop and an inclined launching ramp was constructed. In 2004 the airfield was again put up for sale by Riverside County and bought by Chuckwalla Valley Associates, LLC, to service the new Chuckwalla Valley Raceway.  Facilities and aircraft  Desert Center Airport covers an area of 1,129 acres (457 ha) at an elevation of 559 feet (170 m) above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 5/23 with an asphalt surface measuring 4,200 by 50 feet (1,280 x 15 m). For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2006, the airport had 150 general aviation aircraft operations.

In the episode, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents track an escaped prisoner who is seeking revenge against one of their own. Written by series writer/executive producer Ken Sanzel, the episode continued two storylines. The first storyline continued one that began with two episodes shown very early in season three. The other was originally launched in the season four season finale \\"When Worlds Collide\\". \\"Arrow of Time\\" first aired in the United States on January 9, 2009. Plot summary While Dr. Charlie Eppes (David Krumholtz), a CalSci math professor/FBI math consultant, rehearses a lecture on entropy and his brother, FBI Special Agent Don Eppes (Rob Morrow), is at temple, federal prisoner Buck Winters (David Gallagher) escapes from prison along with two other prisoners. As Winters and his fellow escapees are federal prisoners, the Los Angeles Police Department calls FBI Special Agents David Sinclair (Alimi Ballard) and Nikki Betancourt (Sophina Brown) to the scene of an abandoned car and hands the FBI agents a rope made from dental floss. David explains to Nikki that, two years prior, Buck's wife, Crystal Hoyle, kidnapped fellow FBI Special Agent Megan Reeves (Diane Farr). Don allowed Buck to be tortured in order to learn Megan and Crystal's location. At a briefing at the FBI office, Don acts as though he is not bothered by the news of Buck's escape. Don's girlfriend, Assistant United States Attorney Robin Brooks (Michelle Nolden), becomes worried about Don as the case should be personal to him. FBI Special Agent Liz Warner (Aya Sumika), who knew only about Megan's kidnapping and had learned about Don's actions from FBI Special Agent Colby Granger (Dylan Bruno), confronts Don about his actions. David and Liz take the rope to CalSci to be analyzed by Charlie and Drs. Amita Ramanujan (Navi Rawat) and Larry Fleinhardt (Peter MacNicol), Charlie's friends and fellow FBI consultants. When Charlie and Larry learn of Buck's escape, Charlie is surprised, as Don had not told Charlie about the escape. Larry is visibly upset as Megan was his girlfriend at the time of her kidnapping. Charlie's calculations reveal that the prison break had been planned for months and that someone outside of the prison had to supply the dental floss. Colby and Nikki bring the girlfriend of one of the prisoners in for questioning. The girlfriend points to a friend of the prisoner's cellmate. David and Colby question the friend, who denies any knowledge of Buck or the floss. Meanwhile, Robin confides to Larry that she wishes that Buck would be found dead, and Larry tells Robin what he was thinking when Megan was kidnapped. Don and Charlie's father, Alan Eppes (Judd Hirsch), confronts Don about his recent behavior. Don confesses that he fears having to kill Buck in a confrontation. Charlie analyzes Buck's movements and realizes that Buck is after Don. At the FBI office, Charlie confronts Don, who is reviewing a tape of the Crystal Hoyle shooting. They discuss the ability to control a situation. Charlie tells Don that Don has to focus on the present since he cannot change the past. As Charlie leaves, Don receives a phone call from Buck. David, Colby, Nikki, and Liz find one of the escaped prisoners dead at a hotel. While discussing the development, they learn that Don had called Buck. Later, David, Colby, Nikki, and Liz arrest the accomplice. As Don and David prepare to arrest Buck, David confronts Don about Don's recent actions. Don gives David two options: report Don or trust him. Unarmed, Don confronts Buck at Don's synagogue. Don learns that Buck, thinking that his arrest disappointed Crystal, wants Don to kill him. Don explains that he had to shoot Crystal and that the decision has haunted him for some time. The team, who has been positioned around the synagogue, arrests Buck without firing a shot. Robin, who has been outside during Buck's arrest, enters the synagogue and finds Don leafing through a copy of the Tanakh. Meanwhile, Alan, Charlie, Amita, and Larry discuss Don's predicament during a discussion about forming a think tank. Charlie realizes that he contradicted himself while at Don's office; Charlie felt that the situation was irreversible. Larry uses Maxwell's Demon as a metaphor for outside circumstances forcing a change in the situation. Production=Writing Earlier in the series, series creators Nicolas Falacci and Cheryl Heuton demonstrated that the Eppes family was Jewish in the episode \\"Provenance\\". They and series regular Rob Morrow wanted to explore the topic of religion. Falacci, Heuton, and other writers felt that discussions about mathematics tend to lead to existential discussions. Morrow felt that a law enforcement officer finding purpose in his work through religion was a rarity on television. During season five, the writers finally felt that CBS would allow them to explore the topic of religion. The writers thought that Don's spiritual journey would be a natural progression in the storyline. Series executive producer Ken Sanzel decided to use the storyline started in \\"When Worlds Collide\\" as the springboard into Don's spiritual search. In the arc, Charlie lost his security clearance when he sent classified information overseas at the end of season four. Season five began with the brothers dealing with the consequences of Charlie's actions. Charlie requested for the FBI to reinstate his clearance. While investigating Charlie, FBI Security Officer Carl McGowan decided to investigate Don. In \\"Jack of All Trades\\", Don worked with FBI Special Agent Roger Bloom (Henry Winkler), an agent who stole $10 million (USD) from various banks in order to catch a petty thief who stole $2000 (USD) from Bloom's sister. Since Don had previously violated policy himself in several previous cases, Don's investigation into Bloom paralleled McGowan's investigation into Don. When the assistant director in charge of the Los Angeles FBI field office refused to accept McGowan's recommendations for disciplinary action against Don, Don felt \\"lost\\". He then decided to explore Judaism. For \\"Arrow of Time\\", Sanzel continued the story arc about Don's spiritual journey. Sanzel wanted to show the audience that Don was considering religion as a source for some answers to his questions. He set the story against the escape of a prisoner, Buck Winters, portrayed by David Gallagher, who was interrogated by Don in \\"Two Daughters\\". In \\"Two Daughters\\", FBI Special Agent Megan Reeves (Diane Farr), one of Don's teammates, was kidnapped by Winters' wife, Crystal Hoyle (Kim Dickens). To learn where Crystal took Megan, Don allowed FBI Special Agent Ian Edgerton (Lou Diamond Phillips) to use violent interrogation tactics during Buck's interrogation. Megan was found alive, and Crystal was later killed. Don's actions during Buck's interrogation affected Don throughout season three. In writing \\"Arrow of Time\\", Sanzel decided to use Don's decision to arrest Buck at the synagogue as a way of showing that Don was contemplating the effects of religion on his life. According to Morrow in the \\"Crunching Numb3rs: Season Five\\" bonus feature, Don's spiritual journey gave Don a new outlook. Reception Over 10.14 million people watched \\"Arrow of Time\\".

It was made by the writers and the producers of the 1984 hit film Revenge of the Nerds. Plot Two dim- witted New York street peddlers, Jake Bateman and Barney Bonar, have grown tired of the frozen cold. They head to a car place where drivers are hired to transport vehicles. When they are denied driving a Cadillac to Palm Beach, Florida, Jake flirts with the car place owner and threatens to eat her goldfish until she agrees. Upon arriving in Palm Beach, the duo find themselves accidentally crashing a party held by a rich elderly couple who lost their dog, Ralph. Barney's attempt at befriending a Navy admiral and his wife doesn't go too well while Jake meets Olivia, an heiress who runs a local orphanage. When Jake and Barney leave to find the Cadillac had been towed, Olivia offers to take them in in exchange for help at the orphanage. Olivia and Jake begin to get a little close when she drops a bomb on Jake. She is to be married to someone her uncle approves. Her uncle will only accept those whom he considers \\"perfect gentlemen\\". If she cannot marry in 30 days, she will lose her orphanage to a real estate developer, Strobe, who just also happens to be Olivia's ex-boyfriend who can't seem to let her go. When Jake offers to marry Olivia, she is convinced that Jake is not going to be good enough for her uncle. Upset, Jake turns to Barney, who suggests they go to a charm school run by Henrietta Phelps, a well known expert in etiquette. Taking the back route to the school, Jake and Barney are joined by the nerdy Eddie Lipschitz, aggressive police officer White, neurotic Shelley, Indian man Roy Rajmataj, and Claudia, the pregnant wife of a Mafia boss. At first, things don't bode well for anyone in the group. One night, Jake and Barney sneak off to a local bar where they find Henrietta's husband Colonel Phelps. The Colonel reveals he is part of a secret society similar to the Illuminati in terms of learning how to be a perfect gentleman. The duo splits their time between the couple, learning proper etiquette from Henrietta while the Colonel has the boys take mock photos with royal figures and government politicians to make themselves established. Having finished both courses, Jake intends to win back Olivia. However, he must deal with the likes of Strobe and his two right hand men, Whitey and Tipper. To impress Olivia's uncle, Judge Sternhill, Barney brings in some of his friends from the charm school to help Jake. For instance, Officer White gives Barney a machine gun to help Jake shoot skeet successfully with Barney actually pulling the trigger. When at a party, Jake manages to make Strobe look foolish, the Judge is disappointed with both men and suggests a game called \\"cross courts\\", the two get Eddie to join in. However, when Eddie unwittingly confesses to Whitey about charm school, the ruse is up and Olivia is forced to marry Strobe. At the wedding ceremony, Jake and Barney sneak in while Claudia comes in as a guest. Officer White distracts the priest and \\"arrests\\" him. Roy disguises himself as the priest with Eddie posing as an altar boy. When Strobe unveils the bride, it is actually Barney in a wig and totally embarrassing Strobe. Jake and Olivia finally get Sternhill's approval and Strobe is arrested by Officer White. Jake and Olivia drive off while Barney meets two women coming out of the church. The finale sees Judge Sternhill finding Colonel Phelps and they both give off the secret sign that they were both members of the \\"secret society\\" that Jake and Barney had become the newest members of.

It is surrounded by medieval buildings, among which are several guild houses, including zur Waag, the former K√§mbel guild house, and the art museum Zunfthaus zur Meisen. This area forms part of the southern extension of the Quaianlagen promenades that were built between 1881 and 1887. M√ºnsterhof is the biggest town square within the former medieval town walls of Z√ºrich. It is part of the historical core of the medieval town of Z√ºrich, previously the Celtic-Roman Turicum.  Transportation  Public transport from this area includes the Z√ºrich tram lines 2, 4 and 15, as well as the Z√ºrichsee- Schifffahrtsgesellschaft (ZSG) and its Limmat river tour boats towards Z√ºrichhorn. Automobile transportation is limited because the area is part of the pedestrian zone of Z√ºrich. It is limited to road transport use between lower Limmatquai and Bellevueplatz, upstream on the Limmat. Since 25 September 2004, the driving of motor vehicles, motorcycles and scooters is restricted, except for goods deliveries, police vehicles, postal delivery services, medical doctors and emergency services.  Sights and activities  The main sights are the Fraum√ºnster church (first mentioned in 853 AD) and art museum Zunfthaus zur Meisen, which houses the porcelain and faience collection of the Swiss National Museum. There are restaurants and caf√©s at M√ºnsterhof, including Zunfthaus zur Waag, Zeughauskeller, and Spr√ºngli at nearby Paradeplatz. Hans Waldmann monument on occasion of the Sechsel√§uten-K√§mbel ceremony 2015 The equestrian monument in front of the Fraum√ºnster church at M√ºnsterbr√ºcke was created by Hermann Haller. It was unveiled on 6 April 1937 by the K√§mbel guild, aiming to rehabilitate Hans Waldmann, mayor of Z√ºrich from 1482 to 1489 and their former dean, who they proposed had been the victim of a judicial murder. The equestrian statue became the subject of controversy for artistic, political and historical reasons. Fraum√ºnster church and its courtyard as seen from the Limmatquai On 14 March 2004, the Katharina von Zimmern memorial was inaugurated at the former cloister of the Fraum√ºnster Abbey, initiated by the Gesellschaft zu Fraum√ºnster. Anna-Maria Bauer, a sculptor from Z√ºrich, created a sculpture that consists of 37 copper blocks that are layered into a compact square. The shape of the sculpture refers to the shape of an altar table or burial and shines in its simplicity as a symbol of timelessness, to remember the last princess Abbess's decision that enabled the peaceful introduction of the Reformation in Z√ºrich on 8 December 1524. On the ground floor of the cloister a banner is engraved: \\"Die Stadt vor Unruhe und Umgemach bewahren und tun, was Z√ºrich lieb und dienlich ist.\\" (English: To preserve the city of riots and misfortune, and to do what is nice and helpful to the city of Z√ºrich.) These were the words of Katharina von Zimmern on occasion of the surrender of the Fraum√ºnster Abbey to the city's magistrates during the Reformation in Z√ºrich. Paul Bodmer's fresco related to the history of the abbey are also a very popular touristic destination situated in the abbey's cloister.

Redesign of the M√ºnsterhof plaza  The city's authorities planned from May 2003 to declare M√ºnsterhof a car-free zone, and evaluations were made to improve public use of the historical urban square for open-air performances and other public events. Construction works of 2014 were scheduled to be completed in 2015, but were delayed to 2016 due to archaeological excavations in the winter of 2014‚Äì15 and from October to November 2015. The redesign includes a distinctive new fountain, in diameter and almost tall, as a central element. A smaller drinking-water fountain is to be connected directly to that central water basin. A new granite stone pavement with contrasting patterns visually divides the plaza into an inner and an outer area. New steel lighting fixtures enable a warm visual atmosphere. Benches are to be added, and more space for outdoor caf√©s and restaurants. All structures are to meet the requirements for barrier-free construction and be accessible to physically disabled people. With this transformation, M√ºnsterhof would no longer be used for parking, which will be restricted to Fraum√ºnstertrasse and Parking Op√©ra. Once work is finished, the plaza is to again be a representative and lively urban square in the heart of historical Z√ºrich, available in its entirety for major events. The focus, however, will be on everyday use. The present (as of October 2015) construction works will result in minimal physical design changes, but the city's authorities claim \\"they will nonetheless enhance the square significantly\\" and create a \\"transformation into a tranquil open space which invites everyone to take a stroll or simply relax.\\"According to the information boards on occasion of the construction works in July 2015.  History  M√ºnsterhof, Fraum√ºnster and the medieval upper Limmat bridge on Hans Leu's view of Z√ºrich, c. 1500 While in prehistoric times the M√ºnsterhof area was a swampy hollow, flooded by the river Sihl, Lindenhof hill was the core of the Helvetii (Oppidum Lindenhof) and Roman (Vicus Turicum) settlement, upon which the modern city has grown, expanding along the easterly Limmat riverbank. Roman buildings were likely built at the site of the Zunfthaus zur Zimmerleuten on the other riverbank, and the Roman settlement may have stretched towards the present M√ºnsterbr√ºcke, crossing the Limmat between Grossm√ºnster (remains of graves) and Wasserkirche, and the present-day M√ºnsterhof plaza. Suggested by historians and recent archaeological evidence uncovered during construction at M√ºnsterbr√ºcke, the present Weinplatz square may have been the site of the civilian harbour of the Celtic-Roman Turicum. Firebed tombs from the 1st century AD were found at Poststrasse, west of the Fraum√ºnster church; northeast of the church, a round pit from the 2nd or 3rd century AD was discovered with numerous pottery shards. The human remains of a large 7th-century cemetery at M√ºnsterhof were secured in October‚ÄìNovember 2015. Probably in the 10th century wooden houses were built by Z√ºrich citizens beside the Fraum√ºnster Abbey, and mansions made of stone may have been built in the early 13th century. First mentioned in 1221 respectively 1303 AD, M√ºnsterhof was for centuries the only proper square within the medieval town walls. From the Middle Ages onwards, it often served as a place to stage important political and cultural events for a larger audience. It is where the German king and his retenue was formally welcomed by the abbess of the Fraum√ºnster abbey. She was also acting princess of the Holy German Empire and, up to the time of the Reformation in Z√ºrich, the formal ruler of Z√ºrich. The plaza probably became an open square around 1300 AD when the monastic graveyard was abandoned (except for the narrow strip beside the abbey). At the same time, the demolition of the adjoining St. James chapel (in German: Jakobskapelle), as well as a number of houses, was probably carried out on the orders of the prince abbess. In medieval times the bailiff's house of the Einsiedeln Abbey was also located at M√ºnsterhof, and the plaza became the preferred domicile of the abbey's associates. 17th-century glass painting showing the \\"Mordnacht von Z√ºrich\\" on 23‚Äì24 February 1350 On 18 July 1336, Rudolf Brun defeated his political opponents in the Rat (council) of Z√ºrich; these banned members found refuge with Count Johann I in Rapperswil. The so- called √Ñusseres Z√ºrich, meaning the banned councilors, declared the feud (German: Fehde) and formed a coalition, and Johann I became the leader of Brun's opposition, among them the ancient councilors family Bilgeri. On 21 September 1337, Z√ºrich troops moved over the Obersee to the Grynau Castle where Johann I was killed. Count Johann I's underaged children ‚Äì Johann II, Rudolf, Gotfrid and Agnes ‚Äì were set under guardianship of Albrecht, Duke of Austria. The feud was continued by Johann II in the late 1340s, and an attempted coup by Brun's opposition was forcefully put down after intensive street fights around M√ºnsterhof plaza on 23‚Äì24 February 1350. Count Johann II was arrested for two years, Rapperswil and its castle were destroyed by the Z√ºrich troops, and Brun's opponents executed or banned. After the intervention of Habsburg-Austria against Z√ºrich, a peace contract was signed in 1352. In 1504 AD, and probably much earlier, the passion play of the city's martyrs Felix and Regula was celebrated in the plaza. On 8 December 1524, on the day of the Immaculate Conception, Katharina von Zimmern, the imperial abbess of Z√ºrich, passed the abbey and all rights to the council of Z√ºrich. Following the Reformation in Z√ºrich, the area was used as a pig market until 1667. In 1676, the town square was renewed and paved with cobblestones. From 1627 to 1835, stalls were situated along the north wall of Fraum√ºnster church. M√ºnsterhof and Neptun fountain (demolished in 1811), drawing by Emil Schulthess, c. 1835 In 1766, the Neptun fountain adorned M√ºnsterhof plaza, but was removed 45 years later. During Z√ºriputsch in September 1839, several thousand putschists stormed the city from the west, and fought the cantonal troops in the alleys between Paradeplatz and M√ºnsterhof. In 1938, the plaza was rebuilt at its south-westerly side towards Poststrasse as it is today,M√ºnsterhof on Gang dur Alt-Z√ºri website now mainly being a parking facility nearby the pedestrian zones at Bahnhofstrasse, Paradeplatz and Limmatquai.  Archaeological excavations  D√∂lf Wild, chief archaeologist of the 2014‚Äì15 excavations, told in an interview: \\"For 700 years, M√ºnsterhof was the stage of large gatherings, and will it soon be again, after a rather sad interlude as [a] parking facility.\\" The archaeological excavations of winter 2014‚Äì15 were concentrated on the plaza and on the Stadthausquai and Poststrasse areas; the remains of the cemetery chapel of the era before 1300 AD have been examined (the chapel had been removed and the cemetery reduced when a new gothic church building was erected). The Z√ºrich archaeologists also secured grave furnishings, which will be presented along with the findings of the excavations in 1977‚Äì78 as part of an \\"archaeological window\\" into the Fraum√ºnster's crypt. The city archaeologists (Amt f√ºr St√§dtebau) recently also identified a special find: a 600-year-old badge of Charlemagne on his horse discovering the graves of the martyrs Felix and Regula. The beautifully cast figure made of non-ferrous metals and measuring just 3.5 centimetres (1.4 in) was probably a pilgrim badge. In addition to the firebed tombs from the 1st century AD at Poststrasse, west of the Fraum√ºnster church, there was discovered northeast of the church a round pit from the 2nd or 3rd century with numerous shards, mainly of drinking cups and bowls. In October 2015, the remains of about 280 buried people were secured from the abandoned 7th century cemetery; they are stored temporarily at the Sihlfeld cemetery for scientific research, while a final resting place is sought for a mass grave.  Trivia  The fictitious 2007 Swiss mystery film Marmorera was filmed among others, at the Burgh√∂lzli sanatory in the Weinegg district, on the Limmat near Technopark Z√ºrich, at the Limmatquai promenade, and on the M√ºnsterbr√ºcke river crossing towards M√ºnsterhof.

Hendricks Monument is a public artwork by American artist Richard Henry Park and is located on the southeast corner of the Indiana Statehouse grounds in Indianapolis, Indiana. The monument is a tribute to Thomas A. Hendricks (September 7, 1819November 25, 1885), the 21st Vice President of the United States (serving with Grover Cleveland). Hendricks was a former U.S. Representative and U.S. Senator from Indiana. He was the 16th Governor of Indiana and led the campaign to build the Indiana Statehouse. The sculpture is a full-length bronze portrait figure of Hendricks in formal attire with a long dress overcoat. The sculpture's pedestal is red Italian granite. Two bronze allegorical sculptures by Park, one on each side of the pedestal, represent \\"Justice\\" and \\"History\\". Description The original design by Richard Henry Park was a single bronze statue of Hendricks, surmounting a granite pedestal, similar in appearance to the final version. (copy) Later, as funds for the monument increased, Park was commissioned to add two seated allegorical statues in bronze representing \\"History\\" and \\"Justice\\"; the granite pedestal was enlarged and modified to receive the new features. The monument stands tall; the base is in length and in width. The heroic, full-length bronze portrait figure of Hendricks is tall.The Smithsonian Institution's Art Inventories database lists the Hendricks sculpture as approximately tall, wide, and long. See It is the largest of the bronze statues on the Indiana Statehouse lawn. Hendricks is depicted in formal, nineteenth-century attire and wears a suit and long dress overcoat. His proper right hand is tucked into a vest across his chest. The figure stands atop a red granite pedestal that has arches, columns, and pilasters. Two full-length bronze female figures, one on each side, flank the pedestal's base. Each figure is seated and wears classical robes. \\"Justice\\", the figure on the proper left, has long, braided hair. Her proper left arm is raised to shoulder height; she holds a sword in her proper right hand. The figure of \\"History\\", on the proper right, holds a tablet on her lap with her proper left hand and a writing tool in her proper right hand. Her hair is knotted at the back of her head. A book rests beneath her proper right foot. The allegorical figures would be approximately tall, if standing. The pedestal rests on a three-stepped platform. It is executed in Baveno granite from quarries at Lake Maggiore, Italy, and was chosen for its structural excellence and color. The granite used in the monument was the first of its kind to be imported into the United States. The pedestal and models of the statues were designed in Richard Henry Park‚Äôs studio in Florence. The monument was erected in Indianapolis under the supervision of Mr. C. B. Canfield, president of the New England Monument Company of New York City.Hendricks Monument Association, pp. 9-10. In the 1990s, to help avoid confusion between Hendricks and his uncle, Indiana's third governor William Hendricks, two plaques were added to the sculpture's base.Gugin and St. Clair, pp. 160, 164. Historical information Thomas A. Hendricks (7 September 1819 - 25 November 1885), an Indiana lawyer and nineteenth-century politician, was active in the Democratic Party at the state and national levels. Hendricks served in the Indiana legislature (1848-1850) and was a delegate to the Indiana Constitutional Convention of 1851. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives (1851-55) and the U.S. Senate (1863-1869). President Franklin Pierce appointed Hendricks commissioner of the General Land Office in 1855. Hendricks resigned in 1859, returned to Indiana, and was elected as the sixteenth governor of Indiana (1873 to 1877). He led the campaign to build the Indiana Statehouse. Hendricks served the last eight months of his life in the President Grover Cleveland administration as the twenty-first vice-president of the United States (1885).Gugin and St. Clair, p. 164. Monument association Following Hendricks's death, an editorial in the Indianapolis Sentinel on December 7, 1885, encouraged the public to establish a permanent monument to Hendricks.Hendricks Monument Association, p. 5. A group of Indianapolis citizens met on December 10, 1885, and appointed a five-member committee to prepare a plan of organization and articles of incorporation for an association to oversee the project. At a public meeting on December 12, 1885, incorporating articles were approved to authorize the association to erect a monument to Hendricks; a twelve-member committee was selected to manage the group's business affairs.Hendricks Monument Association, pp. 6-7. Executive committee members were: Noble C. Butler, Frederick W. Chislett, Francis M. Churchman, Edward Hawkins, John A. Hulman, Oscar B. Hord, Elijah B. Martindayle, Thomas A. Morris, Frederick Rand, James H. Rice, Simon P. Sheerin and Charles Zollinger. Upon the death of Hord, Judge N. B. Taylor was appointed to succeed him. The association's officers were: Frederick Rand, president; Francis M. Churchman, treasurer; John A. Holman, secretary; Frederick W. Chislett, superintendent.Hendricks Monument Association, p. 7. Nearly one-half of the monument's funds had already been secured through the voluntary efforts of the officers, members of the committee, and friends of the monument, when R. C. J. Pendleton, of Indianapolis, was employed to raise the balance of the funds. Several thousand contributions from across the United States were received, with one dollar being the average donation. Many of the contributions were accompanied by an expression of the affection toward Hendricks.Hendricks Monument Association, p. 8. On September 10, 1887, the association called for proposals and designs for a monument. By January 1, 1888, they had received a large number of responses to the published advertisements. Richard H. Park's design was accepted and a contract was executed with him for the erection of the monument. The monument association had legislative permission to select a site and chose the southeast corner of the Indiana Statehouse grounds at Indianapolis.Hendricks Monument Association, p. 12. The monument's foundation was laid during the winter of 1889; erection of the monument began in April 1890, but was delayed for nearly a month when several of the large granite pieces failed to arrive with the rest of the structure. Park arrived in the United States in May 1890 to supervise completion of the monument. Unveiling ceremony An unveiling ceremony was held on Tuesday, July 1, 1890. Three of the association's executive committee members Edward Hawkins, Noble C. Butler, and John A. Holman, served as the Committee of Arrangements; a General Reception Committee was named and consisted of approximately one hundred Indianapolis citizens and two or more from each Indiana county. Indianapolis streets and buildings were decorated with lavish display of flags and bunting.Hendricks Monument Association, pp. 12, 13. A large, canvas- covered amphitheater with a stage, five hundred chairs and a raised pavilion for a large chorus of school children and other spectators was erected across Tennessee Street. The structure was elaborately decorated with bunting; the monument, which stood a few steps away, was covered in flags. Benches in front of the amphitheater supplied ticket-holder seating. Special invitations were sent to President Benjamin Harrison and ex-President Grover Cleveland and their cabinets, senators and congressmen, federal judges, and governors of other states.Hendricks Monument Association, pp. 13, 14 Governors from New York, Ohio, Missouri, and Indiana attended the event.Hendricks Monument Association, pp. 21-22. The ceremonies began with a parade, followed by a program of activities: a call to order by Alvin P. Hovey, governor of Indiana; an invocation by Rev. Joseph S. Jenckes, of St. Paul‚Äôs Church, Indianapolis; music; a historical statement by Frederick Rand, president of the monument association; unveiling of the monument by Eliza C. Hendricks; a nine-round salute from Indianapolis Light Artillery; a dedicatory poem by James Whitcomb Riley of Indiana, read by Rev. Dr. D. W. Fisher, president of Hanover College; and address by David Turpie, U. S. Senator from Indiana; and a benediction from Reverend Francis Silas Chatard, Bishop of Vincennes.Hendricks Monument Association, pp. 18-20. Artist New York sculptor Richard Henry Park (1832-1902) designed the monument‚Äôs heroic bronze sculpture of Hendricks and the two allegorical figures flanking the pedestal.

Biography He was born in the castle of Rotours, and entered the French Navy, 11 June 1791, with which he took part in the expedition of 1793 to Santo Domingo, and assisted in the engagement at Cape Fran√ßais, 21 June, where, although bearing a flag of truce, he was taken prisoner, but afterward released. He went on a United States merchant vessel to Philadelphia, where he was furnished the means of returning to France. He was promoted commander in 1808, and captain in 1814, and 1816-1819 made a successful campaign in the West Indian waters, for which he was created Baron, 25 May 1819. Afterward, he was despatched with a corvette to protect the French fisheries on the coast of Newfoundland, when a difficulty with England threatened to end in war, and was promoted to rear admiral in 1821. Rotours was appointed governor-general of Guadeloupe in 1826, arrived at Basse-Terre on 31 May, and found that the city had been nearly destroyed by the hurricane of 26 July 1825. He immediately began to rebuild it on a more elaborate plan, and, after inquiring into the wants of the colony, proposed to the king a plan to unify the colonial administration, by which the island was allowed partial self-government through delegates that formed a council general. Rotours also provided means to check the return of yellow fever epidemics, established a hospital and a camp for the soldiers on Matouba volcano, at the coolest station in the mountains, drained the marshes that surrounded Pointe-√†-Pitre, executed great works in that harbor, completed the canal named Vatable, and also constructed in Grande-Terre several other canals, which proved of great benefit to the colony. One of these has since received the name of Canal des Rotours. He founded the city of Bordeaux-Bourg, erected schools, churches, and bridges, and opened roads. Under his administration, Guadeloupe attained a high state of prosperity, and when Rotours obtained his recall in May 1830, regret was felt at his departure. His works include M√©moire sur le mode de proc√©dure criminelle en vigueur √† la Guadeloupe (Paris, 1826).

The film stars Akshay Kumar, Bobby Deol, Sonam Kapoor, Suniel Shetty, Rimi Sen, Celina Jaitly and Irrfan Khan in lead roles while Ranjeet, Mukesh Tiwari, Rakhee Tandon, Smita Jaykar and Chahat Khanna are featured in supporting roles with Mallika Sherawat in a special song sequence and Vidya Balan in a special appearance. Released on 8 April 2011, and conceptually similar to Anees Bazmee's No Entry (August 26, 2005), Welcome (December 21, 2007) & Singh Is Kinng (August 8, 2008). Thank You revolves around three married men and best friends at work, Raj Malhotra (Deol), Vikram Chopra (Khan) and Yogi Mathur (Shetty) who engage in philandering behaviour and run a yacht business, trying to have some fun outside their marriage. However, when suspicion plays its cards right on their wives, the naive Sanjana (Kapoor), the sharp-minded but pressured Shivani (Sen) and the rather pissed Maya (Jaitly) who doubt their husbands, enlisted for help arrives private investigator Kishan Khurana (Kumar), a detective who specializes in extra-marital relationships. However, the course of events that follows Kishan's attempts to expose and reform Raj in order to help Sanjana, who he is apparently in love with, takes twists and turns that are hard for him to deal with, and what follows suit forms the rest of the story. Most of the scenes in this film were shot in Vancouver, British Columbia and Toronto, Ontario in Canada. Plot Raj Malhotra, Vikram Chopra and Yogi Mathur are best friends and business partners who are married to Sanjana, Shivani and Maya respectively, and live in Vancouver, Canada. The three of them constantly cheat on their wives with not one or two but many women. However, while Yogi is the only unsuccessful one due to Maya having a secret friend spying on him, Raj and Vikram are able to get away with their flirtatious behaviour by fooling their wives and keeping them under check. One day, when the three wives, who are also friends, meet up, and Maya brings up Sanjana's issue about a free necklace due on Raj when the two met previously that day in a mall, she and Shivani insist on Sanjana having a therapist Kishan Khurana, Maya's \\"friend\\", solve the problem. However, when Maya arranges a meeting between them, things don't seem to work out because Sanjana happens to rubbish away Kishan's accusations against Raj. This compels Kishan to try exposing Raj by calling all his girlfriends to the New Year's Eve party, but Kishan's plan goes haywire when Vikram steps in and saves Raj. Confused to the next day, Raj and Vikram suspect a spy being part of the scandal that was about to occur last night and seek help from friend and Canadian Security Intelligence Service agent KD, who instead suggests hiring a private detective as the matter is too trivial and unprofessional for an intelligence agency to handle. However, as fate would have it, they land up at Kishan's place, and, having recognized him from the party, enlist his help. Kishan, who is apparently crushing on Sanjana, decides to engage Raj and Vikram in a double game, which results in the duo mistakenly assuming Yogi as the informer after Kishan shows them a doctored video of Yogi conversing with Sanjana, and ceasing their friendship with him by exposing him on one of his cheat dates. Later that day, he creates a fracas for Raj by nearly exposing him as a cheater when he is caught in a bathing robe, but Vikram again comes up with an idea, this time about having Raj pose as an undercover cop in the CSIS, who was unintentionally exposed during a \\"mission\\" for KD, who played his boss, and was responsible for killing dreaded don King's brother. Sanjana believes the story and forgives Raj, later snubbing Kishan over the expos√©. Realizing that something is wrong with the deal, Kishan learns from Yogi about the plan and decides to expose them by staging himself as King and having them assemble blindfolded, with Sanjana and Shivani in attendance. When the truth is out, Sanjana tries to commit suicide, but Kishan convinces her otherwise, and comes up with a plan to reform Raj and bring his loving former self back to her life, part of which is a plan to entice Raj into jealousy by having Yogi inform him and Vikram of Sanjana beginning an affair and relationship with a dynamic, handsome man, who would be none other than Kishan himself. Eventually, Kishan's plan of the jealousy game works out well, but trouble brews big time when Shivani, through Kishan's help, has Vikram thrown out of the house upon having obtained ownership of all his property by getting him to unsuspectingly sign \\"bank account\\" papers during the time he was advising a troubled Raj, who made a witness. Helpless and destroyed, the three men turn to Kishan for help again, where they request him to blow the covers of their enemies, and vow to batter their fugitives to death, little knowing that they instead have a common enemy in Kishan, who throws a subtle suggestion about the same which they fail to recognize, and while Sanjana is to keep a fast for Raj, Kishan comes up with his own plan and lures the trio to King's house after they end up with his jacket. Kishan then arranges the trio to meet King's wife Maddy, who too is doubting King's possible affair, but the meeting turns out a disaster when they learn that King is innocent and Maddy starts shooting at King left, right and center for flirting with another girl. While waiting for him at his office to discuss details of the meeting, Raj and Vikram, along with Yogi, finally figure out in a sudden fit of musical epiphany that Kishan was in on the scam, double-crossing the three men while playing for their wives, posing as Sanjana's boyfriend, Shivani's \\"brother\\", and Maya's \\"friend\\", having lured them to King's lair out of intent. Sanjana disrupts a fight about to break between the four after Kishan arrives to find himself exposed. Assuming her to be openly in league and love with Kishan, Raj demands a divorce from Sanjana, and a shocked Kishan, in the next few days, manages to convince a crying Sanjana for marriage. However, while trying to invite the trio, Kishan is mistaken as the groom-to-be, and they, drunk, are arrested for smashing a police officer's head. While in the cell, Raj rues about Sanjana and contemplates deceiving her, when he, Vikram and Yogi are bailed out by an injured King. Raj is in fury and decides to kill Kishan, for which King has his henchman Benny give him a gun. Raj succeeds, but when Sanjana confronts him, it turns out that the assembly of people was for the couple's remarriage. However, Kishan reveals himself to be alive, giving the wives relief, with King and Maddy showing up, as Kishan had arranged for their bail. Seeing his dedication, the wives, and Sanjana's mother and sister, ask Kishan about his reason for helping Sanjana way too personally, something which is unexpected of a professional of his kind. Kishan then reveals that his wife Divya once walked in on him cheating on her and committed suicide by slitting her wrist. Feeling guilty and breaking down, he set off on a mission to help aggrieved ladies of his wife's kind in order to redeem himself. However, it was with Sanjana that he saw a reflection of his wife in her, and decided to help her by any means necessary. Finally, everything patches up with the three couples reuniting, while Kishan leaves Vancouver for his next mission.

The Society aims to bring previously unpublished or under researched material concerning the Crimean War to the attention of a wider audience, together with making it available to present and future historians. It publishes a quarterly journal, The War Correspondent. History Founded in London in 1983, the Society's original members were largely also members of the Victorian Military Society (VMS), who, dissatisfied with the coverage given to the Crimean War by the VMS and its journal, decided to break away and set up a society exclusively dedicated to research into the Crimean War. The founding committee included Glenn Christodoulou (Chairman 1983 - 1995), David Cliff (Secretary 1983- ) and Frank Hippman (Publications). Cliff was the first editor of the Society's journal, The War Correspondent, a position taken over by Rod Robinson from 1984 to 1994, later by Major Colin Robins OBE (1994 - 2005), by author Lawrence W. Crider (2005 to 2011), then by publisher Matthew J. Pizzo (2011 to 2014), and 2014 to the present by Lawrence W.

Each year the Society awards the Canon Lummis Trophy for the most original article in its journal. The Society provides expert advice to projects concerned with the Crimean War; these have included Channel Four's 1997 documentary The Crimean War as well as books and journals. The Society has a three-day annual conference when presentations and original research on the Crimean War are given. In addition, national and international research and study visits are undertaken; these have included trips to the Crimea to visit the original battlefields and memorials of the Crimean War. The Society publishes a wide range of publications and documents of interest to those researching the War, including copies of contemporary maps and books, information sheets on the contents of regimental museums, bibliographies, medal rolls and other books and booklets written by the Society's members.

It is generally prepared as the salt with benzoic acid, emamectin benzoate, which is a white or faintly yellow powder. Emamectin is widely used in the US and Canada as an insecticide because of its chloride channel activation properties. History Emamectin, produced by the bacterium Streptomyces avermitilis, belongs to the avermectin family of compounds all of which exhibit toxicity for nematodes, arthropods, and several other pests. The benzoate salt of emamectin in particular has found widespread use as an insecticide and is approved by the EPA for use in prevention of emerald ash borer in ash trees. Emamectin is derived from avermectin B1, also known as abamectin, a mixture of the natural avermectin B1a and B1b. Emamectin has also shown promising applications in the eradication of fish lice and in fish farming. Emamectin was invented by Regina D. Leseota, Pradip K. Mookerjee, John Misselbrook, and Robert F. Peterson Jr. and patented on September 25, 2001, approved August 22, 2002..‚Äù United States Patent Application: 20020114821A1, United States Patent Office, 22 Aug. 2002 It was developed as a pesticide by Merck & Co. as investigative compound MK-0244 Mistretta, Paul, and Patrick R Durkin. ‚ÄúEmamectin benzoate Human Health and Ecological Risk Assessment FINAL REPORT.‚Äù SESA, USDA Forest Services, 28 Oct. 2010. It was first marketed in 1997 in Israel and Japan. Preparation Emamectin is derived from abamectin by replacement of an epi- amino-methyl (NHCH3) group by a hydroxyl (-OH) group at the 4‚Äù-position. Emamectin, like abamectin, is a mixture of two homologue compounds termed B1a and B1b which differ on the C-25 side-chain by one methylene (CH2) group. B1a contains a sec-butyl group while B1b has an isopropyl group. Emamectin is a mixture, typically consisting of 10% B1b and 90% B1a. Avermectin biosynthesis is classified into three stages: the formation of the polyketide-derived initial aglycone, modification of the initial aglycone to produce avermectin aglycones, and glycosylation of avermectin aglycones to generate avermectins. :740px Uses Emamectin is widely used in controlling lepidopterous pests (order of insects that as larvae are caterpillars and as adults have four broad wings including butterflies, moths, and skippers) in agricultural products in the US, Japan, Canada, and recently Taiwan. The low-application rate of the active ingredient needed (~6 g/acre) and broad-spectrum applicability as an insecticide has gained emamectin significant popularity among farmers. Emamectin has been shown to possess a greater ability to reduce the colonization success of engraver beetles and associated wood borers in loblolly pines (Pinus taeda L).6 A 2006 study regarding bolt-injections of four types of pesticides found emamectin to be the greatest reducer against these species with respect to the amount of larval feeding, length, and number of egg galleries.6 Formation of long vertical lesions in the phloem and xylem surrounding emamectin injection points were found indicating some level of tree-toxicity to the emamectin. A water-soluble preparation of emamectin in polysorbate, acetone, and methanol was shown to prevent the wilting of Japanese black pine trees inoculated with pine-wood nematodes (Bursaphelenchus xylophilus). Previous treatment of B. xylophilus infections involved eradicating the local population of Japanese pine sawyers associated with the spread of the nematode. Emamectin has also been successfully employed by fish farmers in the control of sea lice in Atlantic salmon. The United Kingdom, Chile, Ireland, Iceland, Finland, the Faroe Islands, Spain, and Norway are currently registered to use emamectin in their fish feed. Removal of the afflicting sea louse represents an increase in the integrity of their salmonid product due to the subsequent reduction of bacterial and viral pathogens possibly carried by the sea lice. Emamectin has shown efficacy against all life-cycle stages of Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Salmon louse) and Caligus elongatus (Sea louse), preventing maturation to the reproductive stage. A related dihydroxy avermectin B1 compound, ivermectin, is utilized orally in humans as an acaricide and insecticide for the treatment of strongyloidiasis and onchocerciasis. Veterinarians also employ ivermectin in the treatment of heartworms in dogs and other infestations. Structure and properties Emamectin, like other avermectins, is a hydrophobic 16-membered macrocyclic lactone. Emamectin differs from avermectins B1a and B1b by the presence of a hydroxyl group at the 4‚Äù-epimethylamino group rather than the 4‚Äù-position. Avermectins are pentacyclic polyketide-derived compounds linked to a disaccharide of the methylated deoxysugar oleandrose. The determination of the active-site for avermectins is difficult due to poor solubility and lipophilicity of these compounds. :Avermectins are structurally related to emamectin Toxicology and metabolism Emamectin works as a chloride channel activator by binding gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor and glutamate- gated chloride channels disrupting nerve signals within arthropods. The compound stimulates the release of GABA from the synapses between nerve cells and while additionally increasing GABA‚Äôs affinity for its receptor on the post-junction membrane of muscle cells in insects and arthropods. The stronger binding of GABA increases the cells permeability to chloride ions within the cell due to the hypotonic concentration gradient. Neurotransmission is thereby reduced by subsequent hyperpolarisation and the elimination of signal transduction.

He was subsequently disbarred as an attorney and immigration law practitioner due to numerous complaints involving unethical conduct, non-delivery of service, maladministration of client's funds, as well as his conviction on charges of sexual assault, child pornography and tampering with witnesses.  Attempted class action lawsuit for distress caused by tire recall  In September 2000, he represented a West Hartford woman who sued Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. and the Ford Motor Co., seeking $60 million for the \\"humiliation, mental anguish and emotional distress\\" she had suffered while driving her Ford Explorer, which was equipped with recalled tires. Rhona Baugh-Seawright had been \\"panicky and scared\\" for the two months since she learned of the nationwide recall, according to Kweku J. Hanson, after filing the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Hartford. \\"Her lawsuit does not seek any redress for personal injury due to an accident,\\" he said.  Class action lawsuit against Ocwen Federal FSB  In July 2002, Kweku Hanson initiated a class-action suit against Ocwen Federal FSB of West Palm Beach, Florida, where he was represented by fellow Connecticut attorney Paul Ngobeni. The 123-page lawsuit in Hanson v. Ocwen Federal Bank outlines a six- year running battle over late charges and fees. \\"It is clear that this is a pattern and practice of sheer piracy,\\" Mr. Hanson said in an interview. He was joined in the suit by 57 individuals who claimed to have been injured by Ocwen. The lawsuit sought $1.5 billion in punitive and exemplary damages, but was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.  South African Apartheid litigation  During 2003, he, along with Paul Ngobeni, his associate from the Ocwen class action suit, represented three plaintiffs who claimed to represent \\"all persons who lived in South Africa between 1948 and the present and who suffered damages as a result of apartheid.\\" Punitive and compensatory damages in excess $400 billion were claimed from a \\"slew\\" of multinational corporations (including IBM, Citigroup, GE, DuPont and many others) that did business in apartheid South Africa for violations of international law subject to suit in United States federal district court under the Alien Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 1350 (\\"ATCA\\"), and other jurisdictional provisions. Two other South African anti-apartheid lawsuits‚Äîthe Khulumani et al., vs Barclays Bank et al., lawsuit; and the Ntsebeza vs Daimler Chrysler Corp lawsuit had previously been initiated separately during 2002. The Southern District Court of New York under Judge John E. Sprizzo found for defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint.http://www.nftc.org/default/usa%20engage/NYSD%2002md1499%20Opinion%20from%2011-29-04.pdf That finding was partially vacated by the US Court of Appeal (Second Circuit) in an appeal first lodged in January 2006 and decided in October 2007http://www.amicc.org/docs/Khulumani%20v%20Barclay%20Natl%20Bank.pdf but by then Mr Hanson was no longer representing the claimants. Sexual assault, arrest, and conviction On November 1, 2007, Hanson pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual assault in the second degree; two counts of risk of injury to a minor child; one charge of possession of child pornography in the first degree; and two counts of tampering with a witness. He received a total effective sentence of twenty-five years execution suspended after he served six years incarceration followed by thirty years of probation. Prior to his sentencing Hanson attempted to withdraw his \\"guilty\\" plea, claiming, in part, that he didn't understand the criminal charges lodged against him and the court had failed to adequately apprise him of the sentencing range related to those charges during a process known as plea canvassing. The trial court judge denied his motion orally; later, the Appellate Court officially released a written opinion that upheld the decision.

As a result, hundreds of thousands of people were on the brink of starvation. The Penza Gubernia was critical in providing food to the cities and the government used effective measures, such as prodrazvyorstka (forcible requisitioning), to collect grain from the kulaks. The Central Committee sent Yevgenia Bosch to supervise grain collection. A peasant revolt erupted in the Kuchkino Volost of Penza Uyezd on 5 August 1918, in opposition to requisitioning, and soon spread to neighbouring regions. While Penza Soviet chairman Kurayev opposed the use of military force and argued that propaganda efforts would be sufficient, Bosch insisted on using the military and mass executions. By 8 August 1918, Soviet forces had crushed the revolt, but the situation in the gubernia remained tense, and a revolt led by members of Socialist Revolutionary Party erupted in the town of Chembar on 18 August. Lenin sent several telegrams to Penza demanding harsher measures in fighting these kulak, kulak-supporting peasants and Left SR insurrectionists.Lenin Collected Works, Progress Publishers, 1971, Moscow, Volume 36, page 489. \\"Telegram to Yevgenia Bosch\\"\\"An exchange of letters on the BBC documentary Lenin's Secret Files\\" 11 August 1918 cable One telegram (dated 11 August 1918) instructed the Communists operating in the Penza area to publicly hang at least one hundred kulaks, to publicize their names, to confiscate their grain, and to designate a number of hostages. Whether anyone was actually hanged according to this order remains unknown. Lenin's so-called \\"Hanging Order\\" was discussed during a controversy about the BBC documentary Lenin's Secret Files (1997) based upon Robert Service's findings in Soviet archives. This is an accurate translation of the Russian original: > \\"Comrades! The insurrection of five kulak districts should be pitilessly > suppressed.

The manuscript was given its name by Mayanist William E. Gates due to the frequent mentioning of the Maya deities known as the Bacabs. A printed indulgence on the last pages dates it to 1779. Background The manuscript has been dated at the end of the 18th Century, though this is not certain. The style of writing in the manuscript suggests that much of the information included was copied from older works. The work references many figures in Maya mythology who are for the most part unknown from other works. The manuscript was discovered in the winter of 1914-1915 by Frederic J. Smith through unknown circumstances. William Gates acquired it soon after, and gave it the name by which it is known by today. Athlete Robert Garrett purchased it from Gates in 1930. In 1942, Garrett gave it to Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study. It would later join Garrett's other contributions to the Princeton University Library in 1949, where it remains today. The text was first described by Alfred M. Tozzer in a publication from 1921. The first, and so far only, translation of the work was completed by Ralph L. Roys in 1965. Roys made his translation using photocopies provided by an employee of the Newberry Library of Chicago.Roys 1965: vii-viii Content Ritual of the Bacabs includes some forty-two main incantations, with fragmentary supplements throughout. Most of the manuscript is written in the same hand. In his translation, Roys referred to this main writer as the \\"Bacabs hand.\\"Roys 1965: 175 There are intrusive passages written in a different hand on pages 20, 21, 62, and 63. Page 70 includes a medical prescription in a different hand. Of the last twenty-four pages, eighteen discuss medicine and plant lore (pp. 215‚Äì227, 229‚Äì230, and 236‚Äì237), three include fragmentary incantation (pp. 231, 233, and 235), and three are blank (pp. 228, 232, and 234). These final parts of the text and the first three pages have never been translated. It is unknown if these last twenty-four pages are written in the same hand as the bulk of the manuscript or in another. In translating the work, Roys wrote \\"I do not feel competent to comment on the handwriting.\\"Roys 1965: 175 The incantations make several references to Can Ahau, which is either the day 4 Ahau or an alternate spelling of Caan Ahau (\\"Sky Lord\\"). Other \\"proper names\\" may really be titles. The name Hun-pic-ti-ku (\\"Eight-Thousand Gods\\"), which appears in the eighth incantation, may be derived from the Tahdziu deity Hunpic Dziu (\\"Eight Thousand Cowbirds\\") or the Izamal deity Hunpic Tok (\\"Eight Thousand Flints\\"), or it may be a collective term for all Maya gods. Diseases and the diseased are also personified in the incantations. In the seventeenth incantation, dealing with the \\"snake-pulsation-of-the abodomen,\\" the affliction is described as the son of Ix Hun Tipplah Can (\\"Lady Unique Pulsating Sky\\"). There are a few references to Christianity in the text. Almost every incantation ends with \\"Amen,\\" and the thirty-ninth uses \\"Jesus Mary\\" (Jesuz Maria) as an exclamation. Ritual of the Bacabs is filled with symbolism that has long since lost its significance and meaning. In his Maya History and Religion, J. Eric S.

They are recognized as being one of the best senior hockey teams in Canadian history. The Smoke Eaters won their first Allan Cup in 1938; they won the 1939 World Ice Hockey Championships and the 1961 World Ice Hockey Championships; and they won another Allan Cup in 1962. Intro The Trail Smoke Eaters played out of the small smelting town of Trail in southeastern British Columbia and were subsidised by the smelting company to provide recreation and entertainment for the isolated community. Playing in the West Kootenay League since the 1923-24 season, Trail's hockey team was originally named the Trail Hockey Club, and they won the league and the provincial championship under this name in 1927. They won the province championship, but lost out the final in the 1927 Western Canada Allan Cup Playoffs. The team's name was changed after 1926-27 to the Trail Smoke Eaters, and under this name they won six more consecutive provincial titles. The Smoke Eaters won their first Allan Cup in 1938 and won a trip to the 1939 World Championship. which they won. They won another World Championship in 1961 and another Allan Cup in 1962. They folded on January 29,1987, a victim of the sharp drop in senior hockey popularity. Their colours are now carried by a junior team of the same name. History The 1926-27 season marked the beginning of Trail's rise to hockey fame, for the first time in history the team won the Savage Cup, emblematic of the provincial hockey supremacy of British Columbia. The team was coached by Carl Kendall, a real hockey mastermind. The players wearing the Trail colours that year were: Percy Jackson (Goal); Howard Anderson, Harry Brown, Moynes, Jim Hanson, P.R. McDonald, Olaf Gustafson, George \\"Curly\\" Wheatley, Clarence Reddick, Frank Lauriente, DePasquale, Matovich; and Dick Dimock, general manager. That season Trail defeated Rossland in a two-game total goals series, by winning the first game 2-0, and Rossland fighting back to take the second encounter 3-2. Trail had little trouble in eliminating the Vancouver Towers 5-1 in a similar total goals series. They added the BC- Alberta championship to their list by blasting Canmore 15-4 in a two-game, total goals affair. Trail made short order of Delisle, Saskatchewan, beating them 2-0 and 9-0. The Fort William Thundering Herd proved too much for the Trail team, and knocked them over 8-3 in a series played in the Denman Street Arena in Vancouver before capacity crowds. 1927-28 through 1936-37 The hockey fever caught on in Trail, and they installed artificial ice in their Riverside Arena in 1927-28; and they were packing in 3,000 fans per game from a population base of 7,000 persons. Trail won seven consecutive B.C. championships, before the Kimberley Dynamiters dethroned them in 1933-34. The First Allan Cup Trail's first Allan Cup in 1937-38 conquest was one of the most successful seasons in Allan Cup history. During the 1937-38 season the West Kootenay Hockey League operated on an extended basis, to include two teams from southern Alberta; Lethbridge and Coleman. Kimberley, Nelson, Trail and Rossland completed the league and the clubs played an ambitious schedule of 144 games. Remember, in those days a team only had a roster of ten players. The playoffs were on a sectional basis, with the winners of the Eastern Division playing off with the Western Division champs. Kimberley eliminated the Lethbridge Maple Leafs in the Eastern sectional playoffs, and their triumph over the glittering Maple Leafs, regarded as one of the best ever assembled clubs in Alberta, was considered a real upset. The cagey Dynamiters edged the Leafs 7-5 and 6-4 in a hard fought series, however they proved an easy push over for the smooth Trail Smoke Eaters. The Smokies breezed through the Dynamiters in three straight games, by convincing scores of 6-0, 9-3 and 8-0. Trail had a real battle on their hands to reach the finals by shading the stubborn Nelson Maple Leafs 1-0 and 4-3 in the Western Division finals. The only highlight for the Dynamiters that season was that Ralph Redding, their slick forward, walked away with the league scoring championship, by registering 36 goals and 23 assists for 59 points. His nearest opponent was teammate Red Goble with 44 points. Ab Cronie was right behind Goble with 43 points. The Smokies powerful line of McCreedy, Duchak and Kowcinak were far behind with 36, 36 and 37 points respectively. Trail won the B.C. championship and the Savage Cup that season, when Vancouver defaulted the series to the Smoke Eaters. Goalie Duke Scodellaro was unbeatable in the BC-Alberta championship final, by blanking the Calgary Rangers 5-0 and 7-0 in a best-of- three series. Next came the Flin Flon Bombers, the Saskatchewan champions, with Trail taking the first game with ease, by a 6-0 verdict; but Trail lost the second contest 4-2. The Smoke Eaters made no mistakes in the rubber game, blanking the Bombers 5-0. Edmonton was the scene of the opening game of the Western Canada finals, against the Port Arthur Bear-Cats; and with Trail coming back from a two-goal deficit in the third period to force overtime, and they ended up with a 5-3 victory in two periods of extra time. Trail jumped all over Port Arthur in Calgary in the second game, winning 8-1, and finished the series in three straight games by shellacking the Cats 7-3 in the third game played in Saskatoon. The scene was all set for the finals against the Cornwall Flyers, and the Calgary fans adopted the Smoke Eaters and cheered them on to victory, along with the 500 ardent fans who traveled from Trail by a special train. Trail, a flock of speed merchants moulded into a high geared passing machine by coach Elmer Piper, climaxed the long fight by defeating Cornwall's Flyers three games to one, in a best-of-five championship series. The Smoke Eaters won the opener 6-4 and took the second fixture 8-2. Cornwall won the third game 2-1, with Flyers goalie Floyd Perras turning in a sparkling performance. Trail's netminder, Duke Scodellaro, lost his bid for a shut out in the final contest when the Flyers scored with 45 seconds remaining in the game, and Trail took the match 3-1. Trail rolled up a convincing record in their Allan Cup hunt by scoring 91 goals and allowed 26, in 17 games: and won 15 fixtures--seven by shutouts, and lost only two games. The Smoke Eaters homecoming was the greatest hockey reception ever accorded a team of champions in the west. More than 7,000 fans packed the city's business section and overflowed to the roofs of nearby buildings, to welcome their heroes. The Smoke Eaters arrived home in a special railroad car, and were transferred from the train to a special brightly decorated flat car for the public's admiration, as the train crept down from Tadanac by way of Rossland Avenue. As the train stopped at the depot, the whole city went wild. Mayor E.L. Groutage officially welcomed the team and the players were interviewed by radio station CJAT. After the ceremony the players climbed on a fire truck and toured the downtown. En route home, they were officially welcomed at Nelson, and were placed on a fire truck, and proudly paraded up town to the cheers of thousands at the Lake city. Members of the famous Trail Smoke Eaters, Allan Cup champions, were: Duke Scodellaro (Goal), Buck Buchanan (spare goal); Jimmy Haight, Mel Snowden, Tom Johnston, Ab Cronie, Bunny Dame, Joe Benoit, Dave Duchak, Dick Kowcinak, Johnny McCreedy, Mickey Brennen, Jimmy Morris; and utility forward Bob Marshall. Their coach was Elmer Piper. Players that still resided in Trail were Scodellaro, Morris, Cronie, Brennen, Haight and Johnston -- until their passing on. 1938-39 Trail Smoke Eaters The 1938-39 Trail Smoke Eaters represented Canada at the 1939 World Ice Hockey Championships. The Trail Smoke Eaters on their 1938-39 European tour set in the annuals of international hockey what is likely to stand for a great many years. They were true ambassadors to the world, and displayed a brand of hockey that saw excellent stick-handling, and superb passing; and with very little body contact. Everywhere on the Continent, the Smoke Eaters found themselves surrounded by enthusiastic crowds, who literally mobbed them in autograph- seeking fervor, after every appearance. Easily the most colourful team to ever play abroad, the Canadian champions were immensely popular, and their success with foreign fans was tremendous--and at times amazing. It was generally agreed that their inspiring play did more to promote the game throughout the nine countries they visited, than the efforts of any other single organisation. The Smoke Eaters made only a couple of changes from their Allan Cup team, and made the grueling trip with only 13 players. Coach Elmer Piper left the club for a similar post with the Turner Valley Oilers of the Alberta Senior League, after only spending one season with the Smokies. His position was taken over by Ab Cronie, who doubled as a playing-coach. Captain Dave Duchak also passed up the trip by accepting a job as the playing-coach of the Calgary Stampeders. Art Forrest, a native Trail product, returned after a stint with a hockey team in London, England, and filled in for Duchak. Forrest's trip was short cut, for while the Smoke Eaters were playing a two- game exhibition game series in Lethbridge against the Maple Leafs, on the first leg of their Trans-Canada tour, he was rushed to the hospital for an appendectomy. Benny Hayes, a slick forward with the Lethbridge Maple Leafs, was picked up by the Trail club, and proved himself a valuable member. The Smoke Eaters only managed one exhibition at home, before starting their 15,000 mile trip, and that was an easy 8-1 victory over the newly formed Trail Blazers. Injuries played a big factor in the Smoke Eaters poor showing across Canada, and they only managed to win eight, tied one game, and lost six in the 15 game series--but they came on strong by winning six of their last seven games in Eastern Canada. They outscored the Canadian teams 65 goals to 41. The Smoke Eaters embarked from the City of Halifax on 10 December, 1938, and arriving in Scotland, made their first European showing in Glasgow on 17 December, and won the game 4-2. It marked the beginning of a 55-game schedule, in which they won 53 games, tied one, and lost one. From the time the Smoke Eaters left Trail, until they returned with the World Championship, they played a total of 71 games - they won 62, lost seven and were held to two draws. Trail scored a total of 374 goals, and were scored on 177 times; their average game scored was 5.3 goals scored and the against average 1.5--a remarkable record which will probably never be equaled. The ten-day World Championship Tournament started on February 3, 1939, and was held in Basel and Zurich; two of the greatest little cities perched in the picturesque Swiss Alps. Before the tournament ended on February 12th, the Trail Smoke Eaters had won the hearts of all the Swiss fans, and went about the business of winning the championship in methodical style. Trail sailed through the tournament without a single defeat, and won eight straight games. In fact, they were only scored on once, by Czechoslovakia. The Czechoslovaks proved the toughest team to pass, as the low score indicated. The Smokies met the Czechs in the third round of the tourney, and skated to a convincing 4-1 triumph. Here's the way the Trail Smoke Eaters marked up their victories: First round they beat the Netherlands 8-0 and Poland 4-0. In the second round they shut out Britain 4-0, and defeated Germany 9-0. In the third and final round they shut out Switzerland 7-0, before 16,000 fans, and continued their brilliant play by stopping Czechoslovakia 4-1, and blanking the United States 4-0. In the eight game finals the Smoke Eaters garnered 42 goals, with Bunny Dame pacing the team with nine goals. Bunny was followed by Joe Benoit and Jimmy Morris, seven; Dick Kowcinak, six; Johnny McCreedy four; Ab Cronie, three; Mel Snowden and Mickey Brennen, two each; and Tom Johnston a singleton. Cronie was the leading player in the assist department with nine; followed by McCreedy with seven. Joe Benoit was the overall point leader with 13. Duke Scodellaro received real praise for his outstanding goaltending, and the European fans said, \\"They never saw his equal.\\" Duke had a powerhouse defence playing in front of him: in Jimmy Haight, Tom Johnston and Mel Snowden Joe Benoit, Ab Cronie and Bunny Dame were Trail's number one line; the Smoke Eaters other forward line consisted of McCreedy, Kowcinak and Brennen. Benny Hayes was used as the utility forward; Buck Buchanan (a former North Battleford Beaver) was the backup goalie to Duke Scodellaro. Buchanan turned in a number of sparkling performances. O.H. Nelson, President of the Smoke Eaters, made the overseas tour, and acted a manager - and proved himself a most popular man. The Smoke Eaters certainly advertised the city of Trail. Throughout Europe and by not wearing the customary Canadian white uniform, the club decided to go with their famous, and colourful, orange and black jerseys. Sports writers all over the country were intrigued by the symbols of the Smoke Eater name, and the stacks belching out a stream of smoke, high above the CM&S; (Consolidated Mining & Smelting) Smelter.

Species of Typhula are saprotrophic, mostly decomposing leaves, twigs, and herbaceous material. Basidiocarps (fruit bodies) are club-shaped or narrowly cylindrical and are simple (not branched), often arising from sclerotia. The anamorphic genus Sclerotium is (in its modern sense) a synonym of Typhula. A few species are facultative plant pathogens, causing a number of commercially important crop and turfgrass diseases. Taxonomy The genus was first introduced as a section of Clavaria by South African-born mycologist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1801. He differentiated Typhula from Clavaria on the basis of fruitbody shape (Typhula having a distinct head and stem). The name was taken up at generic level by Elias Magnus Fries in 1818. Fries described four species in the genus, including the type species Typhula phacorrhiza. Subsequent authors described another 150 or so species in Typhula. The genus was revised in 1950 by E. J. H. Corner, who characterized Typhula species as having fruit bodies arising from sclerotia, the genera Pistillaria and Pistillina accommodating similar species lacking sclerotia. A later and more specialist revision by Jacques Berthier (1976) placed both these latter genera in synonymy. No later taxonomic studies have been published, though DNA sequences of the type species have indicated the placement of Typhula within the Agaricales. The genus Sclerotium Sclerotium was introduced by the German mycologist and theologian Heinrich Julius Tode in 1790 to accommodate fungal sclerotia (propagules composed of thick-walled hyphae). Over 400 species were subsequently added to this form genus, comprising sclerotia or sclerotia-like entities from a wide range of fungi within the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. With a move towards a more natural classification of fungi, the genus Sclerotium is now restricted to sclerotial anamorphs of Typhula, since the type species, Sclerotium complanatum, is the anamorph of Typhula setipes. Other species have been transferred elsewhere. Even in its restricted sense, the genus is superfluous since there is no good reason why hyphal propagules should have a separate scientific name from the fungi of which they are part. Description Basidiocarps (fruit bodies) arise singly or severally from a sclerotium or directly from the substrate. Fruit bodies are filiform (hair-like) to club-shaped, typically with a distinct sterile stalk and fertile head, normally white, in some species buff to pink, or with a dark reddish stem. The sclerotia (when present) are spherical to lentil-shaped, hard and horny, yellow-brown to blackish brown. Microscopically, the hyphal system is monomitic, the hyphae with or without clamp connections. The basidia produce 2 to 4 basidiospores that are smooth (lobed in one species), colourless, and amyloid or inamyloid. Habitat and distribution Typhula species mostly occur as saprotrophs on dead herbaceous stems, fern stems, grass stems, fallen leaves, and woody detritus. Some species occur on a wide range of host plants, others‚Äîsuch as Typhula quisquiliaris on bracken‚Äîappear to be host-specific. A few species are or can become facultative (opportunistic) parasites of crops and turfgrass. Most species have been described from the north temperate zone, but little research has been undertaken in the tropics or southern hemisphere, where they are either less common or (as yet) overlooked. Economic importance The psychrophilic species Typhula ishikariensis and Typhula incarnata are the causal agents of grey snow mould (also called speckled snow mould or typhula blight), a disease that can destroy turfgrass when covered for a long period with snow. It is a particular problem on golf courses established in unsuitable areas. More importantly, the same two species can also damage crops of winter wheat, as can Typhula phacorrhiza.

Early life Grace La Rue was born Stella Parsons in Kansas City, Missouri, on April 23, 1882, to Lucy L. Parsons. She began her career as part of the team Burke and La Rue, with her first husband, Charles Burke. One of their numbers was a minstrel piece titled \\"Grace La Rue and her Inky Dinks\\". She soon broke away from the act - and Burke - to appear in musical comedy. Career La Rue performed in a number of productions on Broadway debuting in The Tourists in 1906. She also appeared in The Blue Moon (1906), Molly May (1910), Betsy (1911), and the 1907 and 1908 Ziegfeld Follies. In 1909, she married Byron (The Millionaire Kid) Chandler in Bennington, Vermont.Vermont Marriage Records, 1909-2008 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2010. The marriage broke up in 1914 when La Rue divorced, alleging that Chandler was unfaithful and that he beat her.\\"Chandler in Hands of Sheriff's Men,\\" New York Times, April 8, 1914. La Rue made her debut as a Vaudeville single act in November 1912 at Poli's in Springfield, Missouri. As part of the act she sang an aria from Madame Butterfly, and a duet with a phonograph recording of Enrico Caruso. Variety gave her a good review commenting that the act gave La Rue the \\"opportunity to display her Parisian cultivated voice.\\"Variety, November 24, 1912 La Rue made her debut at the Palace Theatre on August 4, 1913. Her act featured the song \\"You Made Me Love You (I Didn't Want to Do It)\\", from the show Honeymoon Express, a musical she had appeared in with Al Jolson. Later that year, she brought her Vaudeville act to Britain, appearing at the London Palace on August 4, 1913. In 1919, La Rue made her screen debut opposite American stage and film actor Hale Hamilton in the melodrama That's Good. She married Hamilton on May 29, 1920, amid a whirl of controversy surrounding a lawsuit filed by Hamilton's second wife, actress Myrtle Tannehill. In 1922-1923, La Rue appeared in Irving Berlin's second Music Box Revue at the Music Box Theatre in New York. In 1924, she appeared at the Coliseum in London with Hamilton. For the rest of the decade she worked mainly in the United States alternating between Vaudeville and in musical comedies and revues. One of her last big time appearances was in the 1928 Greenwich Village Follies at the Winter Garden Theatre in New York. She appeared in a 1929 Vitaphone short called Grace La Rue: The International Star of Song. By the early 1930s, she had retired to California, where she made a brief appearance in the 1933 Mae West film She Done Him Wrong.

Holyfield, 490 U.S. 30 (1989), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Indian Child Welfare Act governed adoptions of Indian children. It ruled that a tribal court had jurisdiction over a state court, regardless of the location of birth of the child, if the child or the natural parents resided on the reservation.Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, . Background=History of removal From 1850 to about 1960, many American Indian children were forcibly taken from their families and their tribes to go to Indian boarding schools, in what has been described as efforts at forced assimilation as well as education., 108 (2013); , 68 (2000). At the schools, Indian children were expected to speak English and practice Christianity; they were punished for speaking their own languages., at 108. Reformers wanted the Indians to choose \\"assimilation over extinction.\\", , 16 (1995). In 1890 approximately 12,000 Indian children were attending Indian boarding schools., 141 (2013). According to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs: > The general purpose of the Government is the preparation of Indian youth for > assimilation into the national life by such a course in training as will > prepare them for the duties and privileges of American citizenship.\\", at 24. By 1928 assimilation through the boarding schools was no longer popular with the public, and the Meriam Report condemned the practice of forcibly removing Indian children from their families., , 407 (2009); , at 68. This type of removal ended during the 1930s, although Indian boarding schools continued to enroll numerous children. After World War II, the intervention of state social welfare workers into overseeing Indian families resulted in another type of removal. Indian children were removed from their families when social workers judged the conditions were poor for the child, and placed in foster care or for adoption. Often the social workers did not understand tribal culture and the role of extended family members in the care of the child. 205-05 (Clifford E. Trafzer, Jean A. Keller, & Lorene Sisquoc eds., 2006). In many cases, the dominant non-Indian culture justified the removal in order to protect or rescue the children from what they claimed was barbarism on the reservation.Trafzer, at 206-07. Indian children were placed outside the home at a rate five times greater than for non-Indian children. By the 1970s, an estimated 25 to 35% of Indian children were placed in foster care at some point, usually with non-Indian families. Children who were adopted out were overwhelmingly adopted by non-Indian families, cutting them off from their culture, and threatening the survival of the tribes.3 481 (William Damon, Richard M. Lerner, & Nancy Eisenberg eds., 2006). Indian Child Welfare Act Native American tribes increasingly protested against the practice of removing their children and placing them with non-Native families. They organized and lobbied to gain relief from this practice. In 1978, Congress passed the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA).Indian Child Welfare Act, Nov. 8, 1978, , (codified at ). This law was enacted to protect tribes and their children; due to the high rate of Indian children who were being removed from their families and placed with non-Indian families, the children's Indian identities were lost and tribe survival was being threatened., at 2. In many cases, the children were removed even from families who resided on Indian reservations, where the state government did not have legal jurisdiction., at 2. Many parents and children were denied due process, either by the state agency or the state court, leading to a finding by Congress that the states had failed to recognize tribal culture, relations, and standards.25 U.S.C. ¬ß 1901(5); , at 4-5. Congress established both procedural and substantive provisions in the ICWA that are designed to 1) eliminate the need to remove Indian children due to cultural bias; 2) try to ensure that Indian children are placed in foster and adoptive homes that reflect Indian culture; and 3) to promote the use of tribal, rather than state, courts to adjudicate Indian child custody proceedings., at 4-5. The ICWA gives the tribal court exclusive jurisdiction for children who are born or who live on tribal land, and concurrent jurisdiction with state courts in all other cases.; Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield, . Lower courts In 1985, a set of Indian twins were born in Harrison County, Mississippi, 200 miles from the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. The mother had moved to Harrison County for the sole purpose of giving birth off the reservation and for placing the twins with the Holyfields, as she was unable to find a relative or family on the reservation willing to adopt both the children to keep them together. She was unable to raise them herself.Solangel Maldonaldo, \\"Race, Culture, and Adoption: Lessons from Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v. Holyfield,\\" 17 1 (2008). The natural parents, both Choctaw, were not married and already had other children. Both parents executed a consent for adoption in the Harrison County Chancery Court. The Holyfields, a non-Indian couple, adopted the twins as arranged. The state court signed a final decree of adoption in early 1986. Two months later, the tribe moved to vacate the adoption, stating that the tribal court had exclusive jurisdiction. The state trial court denied their motion, noting that the children had never lived on the reservation and were not born there. The tribe appealed to the Mississippi Supreme Court, which affirmed the state trial court's decision.Holyfield, 490 U.S. at ___; In the matter of B.B. and G.B., Minors, . The tribe appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari.Holyfield, 490 U.S. at ___ Opinion of the Court Justice William J. Brennan delivered the opinion of the court. Brennan reviewed the intent of Congress and noted that one in eight Indian children were adopted out and that 90% of those children went to non-Indian homes. He noted that for children born or residing on a reservation, the tribal court has exclusive jurisdiction. In other cases, the tribal courts have concurrent jurisdiction. In those cases, on the motion of a parent or the tribe, the matter is to be transferred to the tribal court with three exceptions - for \\"good cause,\\" objection to the transfer by either parent, or the declination of jurisdiction in the matter by the tribal court.25 U.S.C. ¬ß 1911. He ruled that the Mississippi Supreme Court was in error by emphasizing the non- reservation birth of the children, the fact that they never lived on the reservation, and the voluntary relinquishment by the natural parents.Holyfield, 490 U.S. at ___ Both of the natural parents resided on the reservation. A child's domicile follows that of the parent. The fact that the parents traveled 200 miles to avoid giving birth on the reservation does not serve to eliminate the tribal court's exclusive jurisdiction. It had an interest beyond the parents in preserving Indian children within the tribe. Since the tribal court had such jurisdiction, the state court did not, and had no authority to enter an order of adoption. Reversed and remanded.Holyfield, 490 U.S. at ___ Dissent Justice John P. Stevens, joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Anthony Kennedy, dissented from the majority opinion. Stevens believed that, since the parents consented to the adoption and wanted to use the state court, they should be allowed to do so. Stevens believed that the ICWA was intended to apply primarily to the involuntary removal of Indian children from their families and the tribe, and a voluntary action by parents does not have the same characteristics. Stevens would have affirmed the decision of the state courts.Holyfield, 490 U.S. at ___ Subsequent developments After the remand from the Supreme Court, the tribal court allowed the children to remain with their adoptive family, because \\"it would have been cruel to take them from the only mother they knew.\\" By this time the twins were three and a half years old. In addition, they had had no exposure to the Choctaw language, and eighty percent of the people on the reservation spoke Choctaw. The tribal court feared immersing them in that culture would be like sending them to a foreign country. But the court ordered that the children be enabled to stay in contact with their natural extended family and tribe.Adam Liptak, \\"Case Pits Adoptive Parents Against Tribal Rights\\", , Dec. 25, 2012, at A12. The case has strongly influenced family law involving Indian children, having been cited in more than 1,000 cases since the decision. It has also been extensively referenced in books, ___ (2008); , at ___; , ___ (2005). and journals on Native American law.Diane Allbaugh, Tribal Jurisdiction over Indian Children: Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v.

Although the Supreme Court was clear that the ICWA was to be applied to adoption cases based on the statute and the accompanying House Report, \\"by making sure that Indian child welfare determinations are not based on \\"a white, middle-class standard ...\\"\\",Holyfield, 490 U.S. at ___ state courts created references to an \\"existing Indian family\\".In the Matter of the Adoption of Baby Boy L., (\\"the Act is concerned with the removal of Indian children from an existing Indian family unit and the resultant breakup of the Indian family\\") (emphasis added), overruled by In re A.J.S., . They used this to allow exceptions to the application of the ICWA.Dan Lewerenz & Padraic McCoy, '' The End of the \\"Existing Indian Family\\" Jurisprudence: Holyfield at 20, In the Matter of A.J.S. and the Last Gasps of a Dying Doctrine, 36 684 (2010). In those cases, courts had held that if the child was not part of an existing Indian family, then the ICWA did not apply, but this exception was not included anywhere in the law. At one point, nearly half of the states used the exception to evade tribal jurisdiction.Lewerenz, 36 at ___. But as of 2010, only six states continue to use the exception. The courts appear to have better understood the purpose of the law and consider, appropriately, tribal interests as importantly as the child's interests in these cases.

Life and works Fletcher was born at Oxton, near Tadcaster in Yorkshire, where her father, Miles Dawson, descendant of a race of yeomen, was a land surveyor, and lived on a little family estate. Eliza was the only child of Dawson's marriage with the eldest daughter of William Hill. The mother died ten days after the birth. At eleven years old Eliza, a good-looking, intelligent girl, was sent to the Manor School at York. The mistress (Mrs. Forster) was \\"a very well-disposed, conscientious old gentlewoman\\", but incapable of proper superintendence: \\"Four volumes of the Spectator constituted the whole school library.\\" Eliza gained a profound admiration for the poet William Mason, then a York celebrity, especially on account of his \\"Monody\\" upon his wife's death, but was shocked at seeing him \\"a little fat old man of hard-favoured countenance\\", devoted to whist. When Eliza was 17, accident brought to her father's house a Scottish advocate, Archibald Fletcher, \\"of about forty-three, and of a grave, gentlemanlike, prepossessing appearance.\\" They carried on a literary correspondence for a year, and after another meeting became engaged, though her father opposed the union, preferring a higher suitor, Lord Grantley. Miss Dawson called on a friend, Dr Kilvington, to tell Lord Grantley of her engagement. On 16 July 1791 the lovers were married in Tadcaster Church. Her father did not attend the ceremony, but sent his blessing. For the 37 years before her husband died, \\"there was not a happier couple in the three kingdoms.\\" They had six children.Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements and Isobel Grundy (eds): The Feminist Companion to Literature in English (London: Batsford, 1990), p. 380. Archibald Fletcher's steady adherence to his Whig principles prevented his getting into practice, and they were often reduced to their last guinea. Her sympathy prevented her from ever regretting the sacrifice to principle. Afterwards success in life set steadily in with little interruption. Mrs Fletcher died at Lancrigg, Grasmere, on 5 February 1858. Eliza's blank-verse Elidure and her \\"historical dramatic sketches\\" Edward were written in 1820 and printed privately in 1825. They show the influence of Joanna Baillie, who admired them, as did Anne Grant and Lucy Aikin. Fletcher's Autobiography, of which a few copies had been printed for private circulation in Carlisle in 1874, was published at Edinburgh the following year under the editorship of her surviving child, the widow of Sir John Richardson, the Arctic explorer. The Life also contains a memoir by Mrs Fletcher of her daughter Grace, and another of her son Archibald, by his widow. It is an attractive book about a most lovable woman, who seems, according to her portraits, at 15 and at 80, to prove \\"that there is a beauty for every age.\\" References * External links *Literary Encyclopedia *The English Novel, 1800‚Äì1829: Update 2 *Eliza Fletcher at the Orlando Project * *Margaret F.P.

Examples include 5-MeO-Œ±MT (mimicking serotonin) and Œ±-methyldopa. These chemicals can be accumulated by a neuron or secretory cell, are then packaged in secretory / synaptic vesicles, and then released with other neurotransmitters when an action potential provides the necessary stimulus for release. (downloads) The concept of a false transmitter is credited to Irwin Kopin of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke who determined that the drug tyramine increased blood pressure by being loaded and then released from secretory vesicles of the adrenal chromaffin cells. Tyramine can also be converted into octopamine by the dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH) which itself acts as a false transmitter by displacing noradrenaline from its vesicle but not activating the postsynaptic alpha adrenoreceptor. There is growing evidence that a large number of well known exogenous chemicals work as substitute neurotransmitters, though the distinction between the classical model and the substitute neurotransmitter model only becomes apparent with neurotransmitters central to the signaling in the conscious brain, like dopamine and serotonin (as mentioned above). By extension, drugs that affect the uptake affinity of neurotransmitter transporters directly affect the efficacy of these substitute neurotransmitters, as shown by the interference that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have on serotonergic psychedelic drugs. A family of fluorescent false neurotransmitters have been developed by Dalibor Sames and David Sulzer at Columbia University that act as analogs for dopamine and other monoamines and enable an optical means for video analysis of neurotransmitter uptake and release.

In 1986 and for a half year between 1989 and 1990, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the Chemistry Department at the University of Utah in professor Edward Eyring's lab. Diplomacy He started his diplomatic career almost by chance, without any prior diplomatic experience, by applying for a position in the Foreign Ministry opened at the time by Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski, who was seeking to renew diplomatic services in Poland after the regime change in 1989. In 1991, he was appointed as Skubiszewski's chief of staff. Between 1994 and 1998, he was the Polish ambassador to the Netherlands and, between 1999 and 2004, he was the Polish ambassador to Great Britain. He played a role behind the curtains in the diplomatic events leading to Poland's acceptance to NATO as well as the European Union. He was a part of a new wave of Polish diplomats that emerged along with Poland's new democratic government following the Polish Round Table Agreement. He was Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister and between 2007 and 2010 Deputy Minister of the National Defense. In the Department of Defense he was responsible for foreign affairs and, among other tasks, he negotiated the US missile defense system to be deployed in Poland. The US Ambassador Feinstein said \\"Minister Komorowski was our invaluable partner on bilateral defense issues of vital importance to both countries, including Missile Defense and the upcoming rotation of Patriot Missiles in Poland.

One of his passions was parks and gardens and, for a short time in 1990, he had a small gardening company; with his wife Maria Komorowska they created three gardens before they closed the company. His other passion was French culture; as a student he spent his vacations in France with Dziadulski family.

In 1844 Mr. Haldeman founded the Louisville Courier, a pro- secessionist newspaper both before and during the Civil War. It was shut down by Federal authorities in September 1861, but Haldeman fearing arrest as a traitor, removed to Bowling Green, Ky., where he continued publication. After the war, in 1868, the Courier merged with its cross-town rival -- the pro- Union Louisville Journal -- to form the Louisville Courier-Journal. Mr. Haldeman became president of the new corporation. The combined paper is still in circulation and currently owned by the Gannett Company. As a businessman, Mr. Haldeman is also known as the founder of Naples, Florida and the owner of the Major League Baseball team, the Louisville Grays; a charter member of the National League. His son, John Haldeman, played in one game for the Grays in 1877. Although a force in 19th Century U.S. newspaper business, Mr. Haldeman shied away from the spotlight, as a New York Times article from May 14, 1902 described him as \\"a man of unusual force of character, but remarkably modest, so that he resented any form of publicity about himself\\"; thus providing the spotlight for the Courier-Journal editor, Henry Watterson. Early years Walter N. Haldeman was the son of John Haldeman and Elizabeth Newman, and was born in Maysville, KY where he spent his childhood years. He attended Maysville Academy with future prominent Americans' Ulysses S. Grant, William H. Wadsworth, Thomas H. Nelson, and William \\"Bull\\" Nelson under the tutelage of Professor William A. Richardson. At age 16 Mr. Haldeman moved with his family to Louisville, KY where he worked in a grocery store and commission house. In 1840 Mr. Haldeman started his newspaper career in a clerical position at the Louisville Journal, but within a few years he had opened his own bookstore and print shop.

It is synonymous with Clavaria vermicularis. The fungus is the type species of the genus Clavaria and is a typical member of the clavarioid or club fungi. It produces tubular, unbranched, white basidiocarps (fruit bodies) that typically grow in clusters. The fruit bodies can reach dimensions of tall by thick. Clavaria fragilis is a saprobic species, growing in woodland litter or in old, unimproved grassland. It is widespread throughout temperate regions in the Northern Hemisphere, but has also been reported from Australia and South Africa. The fungus is edible, but insubstantial and flavorless. There are several other small white coral-like fungi with which C. fragilis may be confused. History and taxonomy Clavaria fragilis was originally described from Denmark in 1790 by Danish naturalist and mycologist Theodor Holmskjold, and was sanctioned under this name by Elias Magnus Fries in his 1821 Systema Mycologicum. The Latin epithet fragilis refers to the brittle fruit bodies. The species was redescribed by Swedish mycologist Olof Swartz in 1811, using the name Clavaria vermicularis (the epithet meaning \\"wormlike\\"). Though it is a later synonym‚Äîand thus obsolete according to the principle of priority‚Äîthe latter name is still frequently used today. There are several other names considered to be synonymous with C. fragilis by the online taxonomical database MycoBank (see the taxobox). In North America, the fungus has colloquially been called \\"fairy fingers\\" or \\"white worm coral\\". In the UK its recommended English name is \\"white spindles\\". British naturalist Samuel Frederick Gray called it the \\"worm club-stool\\" in his 1821 A Natural Arrangement of British Plants. Description Fruit bodies usually grow in clusters. The fruit bodies of C. fragilis are irregularly tubular, smooth to furrowed, sometimes compressed, very fragile, white, up to tall by thick, and typically grow in dense clusters. The tip of the fruit body tapers to a point, and may yellow and curve with age. There is no distinct stalk, although it is evident as a short, semitransparent zone of tissue at the base of the club. Microscopically, the hyphae of the flesh are swollen up to 12 ¬µm wide and lack clamp connections. The spores are smooth, colourless, ellipsoid to oblong, measuring 5‚Äì7 by 3‚Äì4 ¬µm. The spores are white in deposit. The basidia (spore bearing cells) measure 40‚Äì50 by 6‚Äì8 ¬µm, and lack clamps at their bases. Edibility Clavaria fragilis is edible, but the fruit bodies are insubstantial and fragile. One field guide says \\"its flesh is tasteless and so delicate that it seems to dissolve in one's mouth.\\" Its odor has been compared to iodine. Distribution and habitat The species occurs throughout the Northern Hemisphere, in Europe, North America, and Asia. In North America, it is more common east of the Rocky Mountains. It has also been recorded from Australia and South Africa. In 2006, it was reported from the Arctic zone of the Ural Mountains, in Russia. The fungus grows in woodland and in grassland on moist soil, and is presumed to be saprobic, rotting fallen leaf litter and dead grass stems. The fruit bodies tend to grow in groups, tufts or clusters. Although they can grow singly, they are typically inconspicuous unless in clusters. Similar species Typical growth habit Similar fungi with simple, white fruit bodies include Clavaria acuta, an equally widespread species that typically grows singly or in small groups rather than in dense clusters and can be distinguished microscopically by its clamped basidia and larger spores; the morphologically similar, but rare C. atkinsoniana, found in the southwestern and central United States, which cannot be distinguished from C. fragilis by field characteristics alone but has larger spores‚Äî8.5‚Äì10 by 4.5‚Äì5 ¬µm; C. rubicundula, another North American species, which is similar in stature but has a reddish tint; and Multiclavula mucida, a widespread lichenized species with smaller fruit bodies that occurs with its associated algae on moist wood. Conservation status In North America, Clavaria fragilis has been called \\"by far our most common Clavaria\\". In northern Europe, it is one of a suite of \\"CHEG\\" fungi (CHEG standing for \\"Clavarioid fungi-Hygrocybe-Entoloma-Geoglossaceae\\") considered to be indicator species of old, unimproved grassland (permanent grassland that has not been cultivated for some years). Though such grasslands are a threatened habitat in Europe, C. fragilis is one of the commoner CHEG species. It is, nonetheless, on the national red list of threatened fungi in the Netherlands and Slovenia.

Writing in The Daily Telegraph, journalist John Preston said, \\"Shaw remains an evasive, almost blurry character who seems to belong in the shadows and who can't bear being stuck in one place for too long.\\" His working practice is mostly negative based, and heavily worked hand printed archival fibre-based black and white or colour prints. He believes in a physical contact between the materials and the photographer that produces them to form a photograph. His subjects range from night life to Landscape.

Lotti & Associati engineering firm. He was born and died in Rome. Biography Lotti graduated from the Roman Institute of Technology at the top of his class. He served in World War II until the ceasefire of September 1943 and then decided to join the liberated southern Italy and became captain. Lotti lectured on ‚ÄúMethodology of hydraulic works‚Äù at the Roman Technical University. His professional career started in 1946 with Cidonio construction company. In 1957 he founded the engineering company bearing his name. Lotti married Marcella Bini MD and had two children. His daughter, Patrizia is the president of the Society and his son, Massimo, is a lawyer. In 1977 Carlo was nominated as a Knight of the Republic by the president of Italy. He founded the association of civil engineers in Italy (OICE) and was the honorary president of the Italian Hydrotechnical Association. Major projects Lotti participated in numerous projects, from 1957 together with his associates and then as a company C. Lotti & Associati SpA. Dams in Africa The first project in Africa on behalf UNDP, concerned the economic feasibility of agricultural production and river transport. In 1973 the European Community entrusted Lotti for the construction of a dam on the Sankarani river, tributary to the Niger, near the town of S√©lingu√©. The 35m high dam was completed under the supervision of the designer in 1980. The electric power generated non only covers the domestic demand but it is also exported to the neighboring countries. Furthermore, the dam controls the flood, and, above all, provides for a rich fishery. The creation of the Bakolori dam in the Northern Nigeria, in collaboration with Nuovo Castoro company, is of great importance. The project includes a large dam equipped with 3MW hydropower plant and the irrigation scheme for 23000 ha. A second project in the area was the Goronyo Dam with a reservoir of one billion m¬≥. River basin planning The complete basin planning requires the participation of experts from several sectors: hydrology, hydraulics, agriculture, economy, engineering and others. A mathematical is capable of handling all factors together. The methodology was developed at the Harvard University. Important project derived from the collaboration between Lotti and the Harvard group for optimal use of water resources. A first project concerned the Sava river, tributary to the Danube. The UNDP project was assigned jointly to Lotti and Hydroject of Prague. The model selected 32 reservoirs out of the 57 examined. The first application of the method within Italy was the Tiber project, under the direction of IRSA. After the disastrous flood in 1966, that severely damaged the historical center of town, it was imperative to examine the possible solution for flood protection. The complexity of the project led to the application of a mathematical model. The result of the model indicates the optimal set of works needed for the use of the waters. The Emilia Region contains several tributaries to the Po river. A complex network of artificial canals connects these rivers. The projects analyzes the resources and the demand for different uses. The company Idroser of the Emilia Region participated in the project and was entrusted for the implementation. The Plan for the Waters of the Sardinia region analyzed all the aspects of the current and potential future uses of the waters. In a first phase data were collected on hydrology and potential water demand. In the next phase the existing and possible future works were studied. The third phase applied the data to a mathematical model for the selection of the optimal solution that can satisfy the future demand and provide protection against flood hazard. Lotti created a research institute, Hydrocontrol, specializing on water resources. The institute trained thirty young researchers. The quality of the waters of the Piracicaba basin in Brazil was studied with a mathematical model. The result indicates the degree of treatment necessary. Messina bridge Lotti participated in the international contest for the design of the bridge across the Messina strait. The area of relevant study regarded a new under water foundation procedure. The solution presented received a price but the final choice for construction is based a single span, which will be the longest in the world. Flood control in China Lotti went to China for the first time in 1971 with the Italian Foreign Commerce Ministry delegation. Successively, a project for flood control management started in 1982. The Italian Technical Cooperation financed the project. The aim of the projects was not only the development of the plan but included the training of the personnel and supply of a pilot measuring network. The study area was the river Han, tributary to Yangtze. A large dam was built for flood control and hydropower. The optimal management of the dam is of great economic and environmental significance. Another, similar project concerned the river Huai. Municipal water network The loss of water in municipal network represents and significant reduction of the available resources. The detection and repair of the losses is a convenient way of finding ‚Äúnew resources‚Äù. Lotti carried out several project with help instruments and mathematical models for the search of losses. In Messina, of pipe was examined and the relevant measuring instruments put in operation. Similar projects were carried in Reggio Calabria, Catania, in Aosta. Also outside of Italy, water networks were monitored, e.g., Bucharest in Romania, Durr√´s in Albania, in Ukraine, in Moldavia, and in Nkayi, Congo.

Founded in 1978, Curacao is headquartered in Los Angeles with retail locations in California, Arizona and Nevada. Services The company is said to be uniquely positioned to serve Hispanic and Latino Americans. The stores feature Spanish-language signs and bilingual salesclerks. Curacao sells most of its merchandise on credit to over two million private label cardholders. The company's services also include Curacao Travel, Curacao Money Transfer, Pasito (Internet service provider) and CuraTel (long-distance calling services). Statues of Aztec warriors at the entrance of La Curacao. History=Founding Jerry Azarkman opened La Curacao, a consumer- product door-to-door sales company, in Burbank, California. It became popular among Hispanic people who did not have access to credit. Salesmen allowed customers to buy their goods by placing a down payment and then returning to the customer's residence to collect payments on a regular basis. This service eventually evolved into Curacao's credi-card business. Azarkman's brother, Ron Azarkman, joined the company in 1980. Expansion  In 1983, La Curacao moved to the Pico-Union district in Los Angeles. By 1984, it had opened its export division, which allowed customers to shop for goods and have them shipped to their families in Mexico and Central America. During the Los Angeles Riots in 1992, the store was burned down and its inventory destroyed. Two weeks later, the business reopened near its previous location. In 1995, La Curacao opened its second store, in the Panorama City district of the San Fernando Valley. Inside the Panorama Mall, the new store featured Mesoamerican style decor and child care. The company also purchased the office tower at 1605 West Olympic Boulevard, now the La Curacao Business Center, where its headquarters are now situated. By 2007, the Curacao stores had ten locations in the Southwestern United States, with nine stores in California and two in Arizona. In 2012, La Curacao was renamed Curacao, with a new logo. Initiatives The retailer has expressed plans to further expand into Nevada and Texas and market toward the English speaking communities as well. Export Export is one of Curacao's services. Customers can purchase a product in the United States and have it delivered to Latin American countries. The company has its own warehouses in Mexico and Central America and operates a home-delivery program.

It is smaller than most other subspecies of red squirrel, and also does not have the white-fringed tail that is common to the species. Its diet consists mainly of mixed seeds, conifer cones and air-dried fungi. It exhibits similar behavior to other squirrels in its species. Description=Physical The Mount Graham red squirrel is a generally tiny squirrel weighing on average around and measuring about in length. The subspecies also has a tail. Unlike most other squirrels in its species, the squirrels do not have a white-fringed tail. Both females and males share similar markings and features and are typically grayish brown in color with rusty yellow or orange markings on their backside. During the winter season the squirrels ears are tufted with fur, and during the summer a black lateral line is observed on the squirrel. The skull of the subspecies is rounded and its teeth are low-crowned. Behavior Mount Graham red squirrels behave in a manner similar to most other subspecies of American red squirrel. They are diurnal and do not hibernate during the winter months, but instead carry out activities in the mid-day sun. Mount Graham squirrels usually eat a diet of mixed seeds, conifer cones and air-dried fungi. Habitat Historically, the Mount Graham red squirrel inhabited about of spruce-fir, mixed-conifer and ecotone zone habitats that were generally at higher elevations throughout the Pinale√±o Mountains. Recent data shows that it occurs more frequently at the ecotone zone than the other habitats. When choosing a potential nesting site, the squirrels typically pick a cool, moist area with an abundance of food sources. Drought, forest fires, and insect infestation have been responsible for a decrease of the squirrel in the spruce-fir habitat. Conservation The Mount Graham subspecies was believed to be extinct in the 1950s, but was \\"rediscovered\\" in the 1970s. After its rediscovery, it was suggested for threatened or endangered species status under the Endangered Species Act in 1982. On May 21, 1986, the subspecies was officially recommended to become an endangered species, and on June 3, 1987, was officially listed as endangered. The Mount Graham International Observatory was controversial when it was built in the squirrel's habitat; the observatory has been required to monitor the community near the observatory to determine if its construction is having any negative effects on the population. Habitat loss is also occurring at high levels for a variety of natural and anthropogenic reasons. In 1988, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service designated most of this area as a refuge, and access to the area is only granted with a special permit. A lightning strike on June 7, 2017, started a fire that might have led to the extinction of this subspecies. In September 2019, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agreed to consider if the squirrel needed further protection. They were petitioned under a procedure of the Endangered Species Act by a group that contends it is necessary to remove the observatory and other private structures.

The gate existed from 1744 up to the 1950s in what is now known as Kota, Jakarta, where it would have stood near the intersection of Jalan Nelayan Timur and Jalan Cengkeh. History Map of the Castle in 1762, showing the removed original wall (E) and the new gate (a, between I and H). The top is south. Amsterdam Poort was first built in the 17th century. During the rule of governor-general Gustaaf Willen Baron van Imhoff between 1743 and 1750, the castle of Batavia was expanded. Among the involved works was the demolition of the fort's original southeast wall. A new southeast wall was built further south along the Amsterdamse Gracht (current day Nelayan Timur street), thereby including the Castle Square within the castle grounds. The newly build gate was changed to Rococo style. The entrance through the new wall was formed by a gatehouse of two storeys high and topped with a dome and clock. Part of this building was used as a prison, in a similar fashion as the Gevangenpoort in The Hague.http://www.atlasofmutualheritage.nl/nl/Gezicht- Amsterdamse-poort-vanuit-Zuiden.4846 Owing to its location at the Amsterdamse Gracht, the gate was called the Amsterdamse Poort. Other names include Pinangpoort (, after the trade in pinang that took place there) and Kasteelpoort (). The gate surrounded by arcades. In 1808, governor-general Daendels commissioned the relocation of the seat of government to Weltevreden. The construction works there were supplied partially by reusing building material from the Castle of Batavia. Most buildings on the castle grounds had been demolished, save for a part of the Amsterdam gate and connected arcades. The arched wing of the gate was connected to the building that formed part of the fort. When Daendels destroyed the castle, only this gate remained. In the 1840s, the gate was rebuilt with Mars and Minerva statues mounted on the left and right sides of the gates like a pair of guards. The gate was then reduced further to its final form, after the arcades were removed around 1870 in order to provide passage to a tramway. This gate existed until the 1950s, when the last remnants were removed. In 2007, a replica of the gate was proposed as part of heritage conservation measures of Kota, Jakarta.The Jakarta Post, retrieved 11 April 2010 Architecture The gate around 1885 The gate was originally part of a baroque gatehouse, large enough to accommodate a small prison. The gatehouse had two storeys and was covered by a dome with a cupola on top. Semi-circular arcades connected the gatehouse to two flanking military buildings. The remains of the gate after the demolitions of Daendels only counted one storey. The gateway had a rounded arch and was decorated with columns. On top of the gate were eight black urns. The south facade had two niches containing statues of Mars and of Minerva. These statues disappeared during the Japanese occupation in World War II.

The work describes the love story between a young couple: Belthandros and Chrysantza. The original version of the work was probably composed in 13th or 14th century, while it bears traces of later remodeling that may belong to the 15th century. The world in which the action takes place coincides loosely with the real political geography of 13th- century Anatolia.Beaton p. 112 Date and text Belthandros and Chrysantza was probably composed in 13thVasiliev p. 557 or early 14th century (1310‚Äì1350)Beaton p. 108 by an anonymous author. The text bears some traces of remodeling and linguistic simplifications, and its final form belongs to the 15th century. The romance consist of 1,348 lines in unrhymed political verse,Beaton p. 105Kazhdan (1991), p. 280 and is written in vernacular language,Beaton p. 3 which is also described as an early form of Modern Greek. The original version of the work is lost, and the text survives in a single manuscript, codex Parisiensis 2909, folios 1‚Äì40, dating at the earliest to the 16th century. Sources A group of scholars believe that the romance was based on a medieval French work, still unknown or lost, due to similarities with the Proven√ßal poetry or some elements like the names of the protagonists, which are hellenized forms of western European names: Belthandros (Bertrant/Bertram), Rhodophilos (Rudolf). On the other hand, Krumbacher and Diehl disagreed with this view and support that the romance was written by a Greek, but in a land which had been familiar for a long time with the Frankish feudal culture and its conventions, like the 13th-century Byzantine world.Vasiliev p. 558 Another historian, J. B. Bury, supports that the work is entirely Greek in its construction, descriptions and ideas without any western influences: Medieval French and Greek romance followed parallel evolution, independent of each other, and both were affected by Hellenistic motives.Vasiliev p. 559 The romance also includes elements typical of the earlier, 12th-century Byzantine romances, such as the use of elaborate ekphraseis of gardens and buildings, or the occurrence of bride shows, which harkens back to earlier Byzantine practice.Kazhdan, pp. 280, 1804 In this mixture of motifs, the work represents the partial absorption of French cultural elements, following the extensive contact and intermingling of Byzantines and Franks during the period of the Crusades, and especially after the Fourth Crusade.Kazhdan, p. 280 Plot summary Belthandros, a Roman (Byzantine) prince and youngest son of king Rhodophilos, quarrels with his father and leaves his home to seek his fortune. After wandering in the hostile lands of Anatolia and dealing with Turkish bandits, he reaches Tarsus in Armenian Cilicia. There he sees a fiery star in the depths of a river (a metaphor for love) and follows it to the north. In this way he finds a castle built of precious gems, which belongs to King Eros (, Erotokastron), and is full of various miracles and magnificent statues and automatons.Schmeling, p. 725Beck, p. 120 Belthandros leaves his escorts outside and enters the castle alone. There he sees an inscription that tells of his predestined love between him and Chrysantza, the daughter of the king of Great Antioch. He is then summoned by the lord of the castle, Eros, who announces to him a beauty contest at which Belthandros must give a wand to the most beautiful among forty princesses. The contest takes place and Belthandros gives the wand to the most beautiful princess, whereupon all that surrounds him suddenly disappears \\"like a dream\\", leaving him alone in the castle. At this point he resolves to go out and seek the princess.Beaton, pp. 112‚Äì113 After a short journey he arrives in Antioch where he meets the king of the city, is accepted as his liegeman, and soon becomes an intimate of the royal household. There he meets his daughter Chrysantza, whom he recognizes as the princess he chose at the Castle of Eros. Although Chrysantza has never seen him before, she too recognizes him, and the two fall in love. Two years and two months however pass before their first love meeting, which takes place secretly at night in the royal garden. The meeting ends suddenly when a jealous courtier discovers them and Belthandros is put in jail. In order to save her lover's life, Chrysantza convinces her faithful chambermaid, Phaidrokaza, to take the blame by declaring that the prince had visited her instead. The king believes the story and a forced marriage between Belthandros and Phaidrokaza takes place.Beck, pp. 120‚Äì121Beaton, p. 113Schmeling, pp. 725‚Äì726 The following days the couple continues to meet secretly, but soon the situation becomes unsatisfactory, and they decide to flee, together with the chambermaid and two retainers. On the way, they cross a flooded river, where Phaidrokaza and the two retainers are drowned, while the two lovers are separated and thrown up on the far bank. Chrysantza comes upon the corpse of one of the retainers, made unrecognizable from the river. Thinking it is Belthandros, she is about to fall on the dead man's sword, when Belthandros himself appears to forestall her. The lovers reach the seacoast where they find a ship sent by king Rhodophilos in search for his son. The romance ends with their return to Constantinople, where a wedding ceremony is performed and Belthandros is proclaimed heir to his father's kingdom.Beck, p. 121Schmeling, p. 726 Contents and style The romance offers various scenes of striking realism, with allegory and imaginative lyricism, while some critics consider it superior in imaginative power to the Niebelungenlied. Moreover, it follows a completely symmetrical plot, which is mainly divided between the realm of the fantastic, i.e. the Castle of Eros, and the real world, i.e. Antioch and the love with Chrysantza.Beaton, p. 121 Additionally, some concepts like the beauty contest resembles the Judgement of Paris from the Epic Cycle, and also reflects the 7th-8th century Byzantine custom to choose the worthiest bride for the Emperor. The castle of king Eros (or castle of love) is probably inspired by the Chateau d' Amour of the Proven√ßal poetry. In comparison to other contemporary Byzantine romances, such as the tale of Kallimachos and Chrysorrhoe or Libistros and Rhodamne, Belthandros and Chrysantza contains fewer \\"fairy-tale\\" elements, but stronger loans from Greek mythology, while Belthandros' travails in Anatolia are largely drawn from the acritic songs. All three however share a heritage from the 12th-century Byzantine romances, whose conventions they follow, as well as a strong and pervading presence of Frankish elements.Kazhdan, p. 1804 ReferencesSources * * * * * * External links * [Belthandros and Chrysantza: vernacular Greek poem from the Middle Ages] (Original text of the romance with German translation).

Barbin was identified in an action at law of August 1748 as having already spent fourteen years as a maker of porcelain in a house in the rue de Charonne, faubourg Saint-Antoine, Paris, where he and his wares had recently been seized and the porcelain sold, as impinging upon the prerogatives of the monopoly for exclusive manufacture of porcelains \\"in the manner of Saxony\\" (that is, Meissen porcelain) granted to the manufacture of porcelain at Vincennes in 1745; he sought protection away from Paris, with his protector the well- connected duc de Villeroy,Fran√ßois Barbin was already a member of the duke's household, and a manufacturer of porcelain in December 1737 (Chavagnac and Golier 1906:98). combining his porcelain manufacture with the already established faience industry at the ch√¢teau de Villeroy and Mennecy.Chavagnac and Grollier 1906:95f.

Alternatively, the rue de Charonne house had only ever housed the decorating section, using fired blanks brought up from Mennecy.Battie, 107 Management of the factory was assumed by Barbin's son, Jean-Baptiste, who bought out his father and his brother-in-law; after the younger Barbin's death shortly after his father, 14 September 1765,Chavagnac and Grolier 1906: the lease was bought from his widow by partners of the porcelain manufactory at Sceaux, the sculptor Charles-Symphorien Jacques and the painter Joseph Jullien, who shifted the factory to Bourg-la-Reine,Jacques and Jullien belatedly registered their factory marks in July 1773, both DV and BR for Bourg-la-Reine (Chavagnac and Grollier 1906; Harriet Wynter, An Introduction to European Porcelain, s.v.

The elite wares of Mennecy were intended to compete with Chantilly porcelain and other small manufactures, which were joined in 1745 by Vincennes porcelain. Besides table wares, Mennecy-Villeroy specialized in small figures, representing the Seasons, commedia dell'arte characters,E.g. a Pantalone at the Cleveland Museum of Art, noted in Helen S. Foote, \\"Mennecy-Villeroy Italian Comedy Figure: 'Pantalone'\\", The Bulletin of the Cleveland Museum of Art 35.9 (November 1948):209-210) and other galanteries. The early wares were similar to those of Saint-Cloud, with the body having a \\"creamy tone with a greenish surface\\". Pieces were mostly small, figures or various types of pots and jars rather than dinner services. As with other French factories, this may have been partly an inhibition created by the monopoly granted to Vincennes in 1745. There is no use of gilding, with rims painted in pink or blue.

It wasn't until 2005 that the two began making music together and the group Debaser was quickly formed the same year. In early 2006, Debaser juggled driving from Eugene to Portland on weekends to record Sandpeople projects with doing shows in the Pacific Northwest & recording their debut album Crown Control, which featured Opio (of Hieroglyphics), Luckyiam (of Living Legends), Grayskul and Sleep (of Oldominion). They began touring as a group regularly throughout the Western United States in 2007. Debaser spent much of 2008 & 2009 working on music with their crew Sandpeople and touring. During that time, Sapient also focused on establishing himself as a producer.

Nielsen was Denmark's greatest male athlete during the 1950s and his ability to draw large crowds meant that he was much in demand by his country's promoters. His hectic schedule eventually took its toll on his health, and, with his times strongly affected by illness and exhaustion, Nielsen announced in September 1956 that he would retire after the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne.

It was a constitutional amendment that effectively transformed California's non-Presidential elections from first- past-the-post to a nonpartisan blanket primary (similar to a two-round system). This had the unforeseen consequence of effectively eliminating third party candidates from the final ballots. The proposition was legislatively referred to voters by the State Legislature and approved by 54% of the voters. It consolidated all primary elections for a particular office into an election with one ballot that would be identical to all voters, regardless of their party preferences. The two candidates with the most votes in the primary election would then be the only candidates who would run in the general election, regardless of their party affiliation. Background Proposition 14 was a proposal to amend Sections 5 and 6 of Article II of the California State Constitution relating to elections. It is officially known as the Top Two Primaries Act. It was authored by State Senator Abel Maldonado, who represented the 15th district, as Senate Constitutional Amendment 4 of the 2009‚Äì2010 Regular Session (Resolution Chapter 2, Statutes of 2009). It was based on a proposal drafted by the Independent Voter Project in 2008. It was passed in the State Senate by a vote of 27 to 12 and in the State Assembly by a vote of 54 to 20. The proposition was publicly backed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, as part of a deal in which Maldonado agreed to support his proposed 2009‚Äì2010 state budget, and was opposed by political parties. Provisions The passage of Proposition 14 changed the way that elections are conducted for all statewide offices in California (including the Governor and other executive positions, members of the State Legislature, and members of the State Board of Equalization), as well as for United States Senators and members of the United States House of Representatives. Proposition 14 does not affect the election of President and Vice-President of the United States, local offices, or non-partisan offices such as judges and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. Instead of allowing each political party to hold a primary election open to just its members (and independent voters, if the party chooses to do so) to determine its candidate for the general election, Proposition 14 proposed to create a single primary ballot that would be identical for all voters. All candidates running in the primary election, regardless of their political party preference (if any), would appear on that ballot. The two candidates with the most votes would then qualify for the general election, regardless of which party they identify with (if any). Proposition 14 specifically prohibits write-in candidates in the second round. ResultsCourt challenge and controversial ruling The constitutionality of the measure was challenged in Field et al. v. Bowen et al. The plaintiffs represented a broad spectrum of the body politic in California: *Mona Field, a professor of political science at Glendale Community College and elected member of the board of trustees of the Los Angeles Community College District *Richard Winger, a Libertarian who publishes Ballot Access News *Stephan A. Chessin, a Democrat who is chair of Californians for Electoral Reform *Jennifer Wozniak, an organizing and field service coordinator for the Laborers' International Union of North America, Local 777 *Jeff Mackler, a 2006 write-in senatorial candidate for Socialist Action (U.S.) *Rodney Martin. On September 19, 2011, an appellate court ruled that the \\"Top Two\\" system was constitutional. The case then returned to the Superior Court of San Francisco County. On August 1, 2012, Judge Curtis Karnow awarded $243,279 in legal fees not to the nominal defendants in the case, which were officials of the State of California represented by the Attorney General, but to independent attorneys supporting Prop 14. The original plaintiffs then asked for reconsideration of this award. On Friday afternoon, September 14, 2012, the date for the reconsideration hearing was advanced to September 17, before the same judge who had awarded the $243,279. Plaintiff Winger called the award and the acceleration of the reconsideration hearing \\"outrageous\\" and \\"punitive.\\" Election-law expert Richard L. Hasen, although an opponent of the suit, agreed, writing that the award was \\" absolutely outrageous.\\" This award has been called a SLAPP (strategic lawsuit against public participation) action, \\"intended to censor, intimidate, and silence critics by burdening them with the cost of a legal defense until they abandon their criticism or opposition.\\" The Motion for Reconsideration was reassigned to Judge Harold E.

It saw service during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War of 1847‚Äì1848, the American Indian Wars, and during the American Civil War, 1861‚Äì1865 (primarily in the more rugged western theaters). The howitzer was a bronze smoothbore 12-pounder weapon, optimized for firing explosive shells as well as spherical case and canister. Its range was at +5¬∞ elevation with a charge of of black powder when firing shell. The original carriage design allowed the piece to be broken down into three loads for pack animal transport: the tube carried on one animal, carriage and wheels by another, and ammunition on the third. The mountain howitzer was designed to be lightweight and highly portable. Because of this, and its ease of disassembly, it did not require roads for transportation making it well suited to Indian fighting and mountain warfare. In addition to the pack carriage, a prairie carriage was also created for traditional draft pulling using only two horses. This versatility permitted their use with mounted forces in areas where roads were little more than paths. These small howitzers provided artillery support for mobile military forces where it would otherwise be unavailable. However, their shorter range made them unsuitable for dueling with other heavier field artillery weapons. The first 13 units of this weapon were manufactured in 1837 at the U.S. Watervliet Arsenal in Troy, New York; one of these was carried on John C. Fr√©mont's Second Expedition to explore and map the Oregon Trail in 1843‚Äì1844. Fr√©mont had to abandon the howitzer in late January 1843 in a canyon on the east side of Sonora Pass, in what is now a part of Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest near Burcham Flat, when exhaustion of the expedition's food supplies forced a risky decision to make a winter crossing of the Sierra Nevada Mountains to reach Sutter's Fort, near Sacramento, California. A few wrought iron parts of Fr√©mont's howitzer, including one of the two axle trunnion assemblies and three iron wheel tires, were found by search teams using metal detectors in the late 1990s and early 2000s. These parts have been authenticated by U.S. Army historian Lieutenant Colonel Paul R. Rosewitz as belonging to a pre-Civil War model M1841, and from the location of the find, could only have come from the Fremont Second Expedition howitzer. It is possible that the barrel was found in 1960 by Francois Uzes, but it was not recovered at that time, and has not been re- located as of 2015 despite several search efforts. The parts that have been recovered are on display at the U.S. Forest Service Ranger office in Bridgeport, California.

In 1885, the store name was shortened to Watt & Shand, and the store was expanded to include space in the building at 6 East King Street. In 1889, the store added a ladies' ready-to-wear department which included coats, suits, dresses, and underwear. In 1905, Watt & Shand acquired three adjoining buildings at 23 Penn Square, eventually absorbing Rohrer's Liquor Store, Shenck's Hotel and Marshall and Rengier's Hardware Store. In January 1959, Watt & Shand acquired Appel & Weber, a jewelry store, and in June 1968, it acquired Hager's Department Store.

Radford, 295 U.S. 555 (1935), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that ruled the Frazier‚ÄìLemke Farm Bankruptcy Act unconstitutional in violation of the Fifth Amendment.. This unanimous decision was one of the Court's many rulings that overturned President Roosevelt's New Deal. Facts In 1922 and 1924, Radford and his wife mortgaged a farm to the Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank in Christian County, Kentucky, comprising , with an appraised value of at least $18,000 at that time (approximately $,000 in dollar). Mortgages were given to secure loans totaling $9,000, to be repaid in installments over 34 years with interest at the rate of 6 per cent. In 1931 and subsequent years, the Radfords defaulted in payment of taxes. In 1932 and 1933, they defaulted in their promise to pay the installments of interest and principal. In 1933, they also defaulted in their covenant to keep the buildings insured. The Bank urged the Radfords to refinance the debt under the provisions of the Emergency Farm Mortgage Act, which they declined to do so. The Bank then declared the entire indebtedness immediately payable, and filed a suit in the circuit court for Christian county in June 1933, against the Radfords and their tenant to foreclose the mortgages. In addition, invoking a covenant in the mortgage expressly providing therefore, the bank sought to appoint a receiver to take possession and control of the premises and to collect the rents and profits. The application for the appointment of a receiver was denied and all proceedings in the suit were suspended, upon request of the Conciliation Commissioner for Christian County appointed under section 75 of the Bankruptcy Act, stating that Radford desired to avail himself of the provisions of that section. Radford filed a petition295 U.S. at 575. asking for an opportunity to submit a composition of his debts, in the federal court for Western Kentucky. The petition was promptly approved and a meeting of the creditors was held, but Radford failed to obtain the acceptance of the requisite majority in number and amount to the composition proposed. Then, the Bank offered to accept a deed of the mortgaged property in full satisfaction of the indebtedness to it and to assume the unpaid taxes. Radford refused to execute the deed; on June 30, 1934, the state court ordered a foreclosure sale. The Frazier‚ÄìLemke Emergency Farm Mortgage Act was passed on June 28, 1934.11 U.S.C. ¬ß 203(s). The act was designed to give aid to debt-ridden farmers, allowing them to reacquire farms they had lost from foreclosure, or to petition the Bankruptcy Court within their district to suspend foreclosure proceedings.McKenna, at 100‚Äì01. The legislation's ultimate goal was to help those farmers scale down their mortgages. On August 6, 1934, and again on November 10, 1934, Radford filed amended petitions for relief thereunder. The second amended petition prayed that Radford be deemed bankrupt; that his property be appraised; and that he have the relief provided for in paragraphs 3 and 7 of subsection(s) of the Frazier-Lemke Amendment.11 U.S.C. ¬ß 203(s)(3, 7). That act provides, among other things, that a farmer who has failed to obtain the consents requisite to a composition under section 75 of the Bankruptcy Act, may, upon being adjudged a bankrupt, acquire alternative options in respect to mortgaged property: #By paragraph 3, the bankrupt may, if the mortgagee assents, purchase the property at its then appraised value, acquiring title as well as immediate possession, by agreeing to make deferred payments as follows: 2¬Ω per cent. within two years; 2¬Ω per cent. within three years; 5 per cent. within four years; 5 per cent. within five years; the balance within six years. All deferred payments to bear interest at the rate of 1 per cent. per annum. #By paragraph 7, the bankrupt may, if the mortgagee refuses the immediate purchase on the above basis, require the bankruptcy court to 'stay all proceedings for a period of five years, during which five years the debtor shall retain possession of all or any part of his property, under the control of the court, provided he pays a reasonable rental annually for that part of the property of which he retains possession; the first payment of such rental to be made within six months of the date of the order staying proceedings, such rental to be distributed among the secured and unsecured creditors, as their interests may appear, under the provisions of this Act (title). At the end of five years, or prior thereto, the debtor may pay into court the appraised price of the property of which he retains possession: Provided, That upon request of any lien holder on real estate the court shall cause a reappraisal of such real estate and the debtor may then pay the reappraised price, if acceptable to the lien holder, into the court, otherwise the original appraisal price shall be paid into court, and thereupon the court shall, by an order, turn over full possession and title of said property to the debtor and he may apply for his discharge as provided for by this Act (title): Provided, however, That the provisions of this Act (subsection) shall apply only to debts existing at the time this Act becomes effective (on June 28, 1934). Answering the amended petition, the Bank claimed that the Frazier-Lemke Act was unconstitutional, and requested that Radford's amended petition be dismissed and that it be allowed to proceed with the foreclosure sale. It rejected the composition and extension proposal offered by Radford, and declined to consent to the proposed sale of that property to Radford at the appraised value or any value on the terms set forth in paragraph 3, and objected to his retaining possession thereof with the privilege of purchasing the same provided by paragraph 7. The federal court overruled the Bank's objections, adjudged Radford a bankrupt within the meaning of the Frazier-Lemke Act, and appointed a referee to take proceedings thereunder. The referee ordered an appraisal of all of Radford's property, which found that 'the fair and reasonable value of the property of the debtor on which Louisville Joint Stock Bank has a mortgage' and also the 'market value of said land' was then $4,445. The referee approved the appraisal, although the Bank offered in open court to pay $9,205.09 in cash for the mortgaged property. Counsel for the bankrupt admitted that since the Bank had a valid lien upon it for the amount offered to be paid, if the Bank's offer to purchase the property were accepted, all the money paid in cash would be immediately returned to it in satisfaction of the mortgage indebtedness. The Bank refused to sell the mortgaged property to Radford at the appraised value as prescribed by paragraph 3 of subsection (s). Thereupon, the referee ordered the suspension of all proceedings for the enforcement of the mortgages for five years, and that the possession of the mortgaged property, subject to liens, remain in Radford, under the control of the court, as provided in paragraph 7 of subsection (s). The referee fixed the rental for the first year at $325, and ordered that for each subsequent year the rental be fixed by the court. All the orders of the referee were, upon a petition for a review, approved by the District Court; and its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals on February 11, 1935. Decision Justice Brandeis wrote for a unanimous Court in invalidating the Frazier-Lemke Act, holding that this act unfairly deprived the bank of private property without just compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The Court cited W.B. Worthen Co. v. Kavanaugh (1935). where the Court had held unconstitutional provisions of state legislation similar to the Frazier-Lemke Act, stating in that case that turning a mortgage into an undesirable investment for the mortgagee is an act of oppression by the government. The Court reversed the Circuit Court's decision, ruling that the Frazier-Lemke Act was unconstitutional in violation of the Fifth Amendment. \\"The Fifth Amendment,\\" Brandeis declared, \\"commands that however great the Nation's need, private property shall not be thus taken over without just compensation.\\" Reaction Along with Humphrey's Executor v. United States. and A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States,. both decided in 1935, this Court decision was a major setback for the Roosevelt administration's New Deal program. Roosevelt became distressed upon learning the unanimity of these three court decisions. However, this would also be one of the few occasions where the court's three liberal judges agreed to overrule some of the New Deal legislation. The worst of Roosevelt's problems from the Supreme Court came from other decisions where Justice Owen Roberts sided with the court four conservative justices to override other New Deal legislation. Roosevelt's setbacks with the Supreme Court eventually led to his attempt to pack the court. See also *A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States (1935) *Humphrey's Executor v.

South is best known for his play online, though he has also made television appearances on Poker After Dark in season 5 of the show. South graduated from Georgetown University with a degree in economics in December 2011. Poker career South started playing poker online in November 2005 at partypoker under the username CTS, depositing $50. He quickly improved as a player and through intensely studying the game he increased his bankroll to over $13,000 by October 2006. In just two years he went from playing small stakes poker, to building up a bankroll of over $2 million and playing in high-stakes online games, winning pots of over half a million dollars. In April 2010, South left the team at the CardRunners website, which he was a partial owner of. During his time there he produced instructional poker videos where he shared his knowledge of the game. His mathematical approach to poker, as well as his pursuit of constant improvement and self-analysis are what makes Cole South stand out as a poker player: Poker is a game based on mathematics (probability and expectation in particular) and should be treated this way. Bets, folds, raises, bluffs, and all poker decisions should be evaluated solely on their expected value, not because a certain action \\"feels right\\" or \\"gives you information\\". As a mathematician this is perfectly clear to me, but it isn't evident to casual players and this is what makes poker profitable. South experienced some large swings in February and March 2010, winning more than $3.5 million in the month of February, and losing $2.6 million in the month of March. Exactly one month after winning $1.1 million in a single day, South lost $1 million to Tom Dwan and Ilari Sahamies which is a clear example of his change in fortune at the online tables. Also in the month of March, South lost $785,000 in a single session over a span of almost 2,400 hands against poker player Isildur1. After starting at $100/$200 PLO they increased their bets to $300/$600 before their match had ended. In December 2009, South was accused of sharing hand histories from his matches against Isildur1 with other professional poker players, Brian Townsend and Brian Hastings, with Hastings going on to win around 4 million from Isildur1. Ultimately it was determined that South did not share his hand histories or violate the Full Tilt Poker rules in any way and he was not penalized. Townsend was ultimately suspended from his 'Red Pro' status for 30 days for downloading hand histories from a widely used subscription service. In March 2010, South entered a heated exchange with fellow professional poker player Ilari Sahamies (Ziigmund). The controversial Sahamies accused South of taking advantage of him being disconnected during an online match and continuing to make bets against him. World Series of Poker Cole South has made an appearance in the World Series of Poker, he finished 162nd in the 2009 WSOP Main Event earning him $40,288. He cashed the following year as well, earning $36,463 for finishing in 365th. Entrepreneurial career While he still plays poker, South has shifted his business focus to start-ups and entrepreneurial endeavors. He has invested and managed a variety of businesses including CardRunners, DraftDay, Expert Insight, Hold'em Manager, Terran Marketing, and a documentary on the online poker boom.

The ICC All-Stars also featured Burl Friddle, a Franklin Wonder Fiver and Twenties pro who had coached DeJernett in high school. Rounding out the ICC AllStars were guards Billy Schaeffer and Harry Spurgeon, both native Hoosiers from Southern Indiana who had played at Indiana Central, and forwards Jack \\"Red\\" Heavenridge, Eugene Gilmore, and Paul Gross. In the 1930s seven-man professional touring squads of former amateur teammates were not uncommon; the New York Renaissance club, for example, was known as the \\"Magnificent Seven\\" and included several players who'd been schoolboy teammates in Philadelphia. Similarly, the Harlem Globetrotters originated amongst teammates at Wendell St Phillips High School in Chicago.

Commonly billed as the \\"Western World's Colored Champions\\" the team's roster over the years featured about a dozen players who also were members of the better-known Harlem Globetrotters and New York Renaissance, both enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame. History=1933-34 season In the 1933-34 season Dick Hudson, who had previously managed the seminal Giles Post Legion and Savoy Big Five squads that had helped birth Abe Saperstein's Globetrotters, converted his Hottentots into the Chicago Crusaders as something of a travelling name for the Savoy Big Five. Players that season included Jackie Bethards, Al Johnson, Big Jack Mann, and Zack Clayton. 1934-35 season In 1934-35 the Crusaders made a highly successful barnstorming tour of the Eastern USA, in contravention of the more- common practice of Eastern Seaboard clubs such as the Original Celtics and Rens touring the cavernous MidWestern gyms. Their record that year was reported to be 112-10, including wins over such clubs back East as the Honey Russell All-Stars and Clarksville Oilers. 1935-37 seasons After a successful 1935-36 campaign, the 1936-37 Crusaders, now managed by Mahlon Roles, adopted the moniker of the Palmer House Indians, competing locally in Chicago's Windy City League. The Indians played their home games at then- brand-new DuSable High School, winning a dozen straight to start the season before dropping a disappointing 53-31 decision to the visiting Rens. In this season the Crusaders notably added David \\"Big Dave\\" DeJernett to their squad, making an early \\"Twin Towers\\" between DeJernett and former schoolboy rival Jack Mann. Bob \\"Red\\" Bolton of Colgate University was another high-profile addition at guard. 1939-40 season In 1939-40 the Crusaders presented perhaps their strongest edition ever, as DeJernett and Al Johnson continued to start along with legendary Rens star Fats Jenkins plus Agis Bray and Hillery Brown, both former Chicago Collegians. Late in the season the Crusaders were reported to have been \\"sidestepped\\" by the promoters of the Chicago World's Pro Tourney, which had been inaugurated the previous Spring & won by the Rens. The Pro Tourney took great pains to seed the Rens and Globetrotters in the same semifinal bracket to ensure that two black clubs would not meet in the Final for the World's title. This may have been a decisive factor in \\"sidestepping\\" the Crusaders' chances to compete in the local tournament. November 1940 In November 1940 the Harlem Globetrotters, who had won the '40 World's title, announced that they had entered a type of player-exchange agreement with the now-redubbed Savoy Big Five. Most of the 1940 Crusaders -- DeJernett, Bray, Johnson, Brown -- were listed as parties to this exchange agreement. Although Abe Saperstein had spoken for years of his \\"farm team\\" this was the first verifiable instance of the Crusaders' taking a subordinate position to the Globetrotter unit. Within a few months Brown and Bray were regularly starting and leading the Trotters' first unit in scoring. The Savoy Big Five by the winter of 1941 was regularly playing games billed as the Harlem Globetrotters -- effectively becoming the Trotters' first official second touring unit. Chicago Monarchs Over the next six years the Crusaders occasionally played with one of their oldtime names such as Bray or Johnson as stars. Crusader-related players such as Brown or Mann also were commonly found to play for Thirties-reminiscent squads called the Chicago Collegians, the Olde-Tymers, or under the new moniker of the Chicago Monarchs.

Norris published two novels, Windchill Summer and Cheap Diamonds, and a memoir, A Ticket to the Circus, which focuses on her nearly thirty-year marriage to Norman Mailer. Early life Barbara Jean Davis grew up in Atkins, Arkansas, where her mother owned the local beauty shop and her grandparents were sharecroppers. As a child, she was severely affected by her mother's bouts of depression and was hospitalized and given electroshock treatments. Davis and her family were simple country people who attended church faithfully. When she was twenty years old, she married her high school sweetheart, Larry Norris, and together they had one son, Matthew. By 1975, at just 25 years old, she had divorced her first husband and had worked several jobs including working in a pickle factory and as a bookkeeper. Shortly after her divorce from Norris, she claimed to have \\"had a fling\\" with future U.S. President Bill Clinton. Norris and her young son moved to Russellville, Arkansas and she explored her love of the arts by working as a high school art teacher; however, everything changed when she met Norman Mailer. Writing Norris was interested in writing and wrote about a hundred pages of a novel loosely based on herself as a young girl growing up in Arkansas. Still in the early days of their relationship, Norris showed her rough draft to Mailer for his opinion, to which he responded, \\"It's not as bad as I thought it would be\\", causing Norris to put her work aside for the next several decades. Years later, amidst a successful career as a Wilhelmina model and accomplished artist, Norris reshaped her rough draft into her first novel, Windchill Summer, which was published in 2000. Windchill Summer illustrates the challenges of a young girl struggling to grow up in Arkansas during the Vietnam War era. In 2007, Norris followed with the sequel, Cheap Diamonds, a story about a young woman leaving her small town home and moving to New York to become a model in the tumultuous 1970s. Church's last work was her own memoir, A Ticket to the Circus, published in 2010, explaining that the title described her life with Mailer, his seven children by his other wives, and her own two children: \\"Well, I bought a ticket to the circus. I don't know why I was surprised to see elephants\\". Life with Norman Mailer Barbara Davis, then a single mother living in Russellville, Arkansas and teaching high-school art, met her soon-to-be second husband, Pulitzer Prize winning author Norman Mailer, at a book signing event. Although Davis was married when she met him, she and her son moved to New York to continue her relationship with Mailer. Davis gave birth to Mailer's son, John Buffalo Mailer, in 1978 and eventually married Mailer in 1980, becoming Mailer's sixth and final wife. She also became stepmother to two stepsons and five stepdaughters, and spent the next three decades juggling successful careers as an artist/actress/writer, managing her home life, and her husband's career demands. She described Norman Mailer as \\"the Henry Higgins to my Eliza Doolittle,\\" and often defended Norman against critics who claimed he was a misogynist; she also asked for his feedback on drafts of her novels, though his response was sometimes negative.  Model, actress, and artist  After moving to New York, Barbara Davis changed her first name to Norris (her first husband's last name), and her middle name to Church as suggested by Mailer, who decided the name suitable because of her faithful attendance of church while growing up. Norris soon began a successful career as a Wilhelmina model. Although Norris Church Mailer dedicated much of her time during the 1980s to caring for her extended family, she had a keen interest in the arts and held several successful one-woman showings of her art and worked as an actress in several films and television. Mailer's work as an actress included Jet Lag (1981), Ragtime (1981), The Executioner's Song (1982), Exposed (1983) and Chinese Coffee (2000). In 2010, Mailer portrayed herself in the documentary, Norman Mailer: The American. She also played in the daytime soap All My Children. Health issues and death In 2000, Norris was diagnosed with a malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumor and was told she would probably only live for two more years. Norris beat the odds and over the next 11 years had six major operations to fight the cancer, while taking care of her ailing husband. Norris died on November 21, 2010, aged 61, at her home in Brooklyn Heights in New York City. Legacy On June 26, 2004, Wilkes University established the Norris Church Mailer Fellowship in Creative Writing. This is a summer workshop program to honor Norris Church Mailer as a writer and a board member. The workshop is an annual opportunity for creative writing students to receive financial assistance.

Bilateral relations were initially established in 1972 but were severed by China in 1997 due to Chad's recognition of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Relations resumed in August 2006 when Chad ended its relationship with Taiwan and pledged adherence to the One China Policy. The ties between the two nations are primarily economic, although there is some cooperation in security. The economic ties are profitable for both countries, with China providing aid and investment in exchange for natural resources to fuel its economic growth.  History of Diplomatic Relationships Between Chad and China = Development of Relations  Chad‚ÄìChina relations have played an important role in the economic development of Chad. The Republic of Chad is a poor, landlocked country in West Africa. A former French colony, it gained independence on August 11, 1960, under President Francois Tombalbaye. Following independence, Chad has oscillated between engaging in foreign relations with either Taiwan or China. Chad had diplomatic relations with Taiwan from 1962 to 1972. By 1965, Tombalbaye's anti-Muslim policies increased opposition to his government and led to an extended civil war, which further damaged the economy. When low-quality crude oil was discovered in the 1960s, investors were hesitant to develop the resource because of the political instability in the region. During this time, The People's Republic of China supported the Chadian National Union (CNU), a revolutionary group opposed to the French-backed government. Despite this, by 1972, France and China had established ambassadorial level diplomatic relations, and, soon after, the Tombalbaye government established diplomatic relations with China. Trade agreements were signed between China and Chad in 1973, along with a US$10 million loan. These funds contributed to many projects to improve Chad's infrastructure, including the National Assembly Building and medical facilities. In 1997, Chad profited by switching its diplomatic relations back to Taiwan as it received financial support in the form of a US$125 million loan, which was used for the construction of infrastructures such as roads and water distributions systems. Taiwan's support allowed Chad to develop its infrastructure and expand its oil industry. In return, Chad acknowledged Taiwan's government and Taiwan gained potential access to markets and resources as they were developed. However, in August 2006, Chad informed Taiwan that it would resume relations with China, and Taiwan's reaction was to break off relations with Chad. Chad professed the One China principle, supporting the goal of creating one China. On a state visit to China in 2007, President Deby voiced his support for reunification. Other analysts emphasized the attraction of trade and investment deals from China in exchange for oil and other raw materials from Chad.  China's Role in the Chad-Sudan Conflict  Chad Sudan Border In 2006, Chadian rebels backed by Sudan almost succeeded in ousting the Deby government. Although the rebels denied that they were linked to China, they carried weapons supplied by China to Sudan. In August 2006, as Chad resumed relations with China, Taiwan publicly stated that Chad reestablished relations with China because of the proxy war with Sudan. Minister of Foreign Affairs James Huang said that President Idriss D√©by of Chad had engaged in secret meetings with China to ask for intervention in the conflict on its border. Upon resuming relations with Chad, China proclaimed that it supported Chad's efforts to safeguard sovereignty and promote economic development. Over time, as Chinese assets increased in Chad, it became more vulnerable to regional instability. In 2008, another coup attempt by rebels backed by Sudan forced the evacuation of over 210 Chinese nationals from the capital. China assumed a diplomatic role to improve Chad-Sudan relations as well as enhancing its military relations with Chad.  Contemporary Relations  China and Chad are working to expand their bilateral cooperation in the development of infrastructure, trade, and investment. More recently, Xi Jinping has offered China's assistance to Chad in strengthening its counter- terrorism efforts to ensure stability. = Impacts of Covid-19 on Sino- Chadian Relations = The COVID-19 Pandemic has introduced tension into the relations between African nations and China. China has been reluctant to support the G-20's decision to suspend payments on debt through the end of the year. During the 1990s, thousands of African Expatriates moved to China, especially to the city of Guangzhou, for better opportunities. Discrimination against their communities has been previously documented. However, the pandemic has raised new concerns. In China, Chadians and other Africans have been evicted from their residences, repeatedly tested for COVID-19, and forced to isolate based on their race. China has downplayed the situation, but multiple African ambassadors and representatives of the African Union, of which Chad is a member, have vocally complained to Beijing after incidents were posted on social media. In response, Zhao Lijian, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson, issued conciliatory remarks calling for unity. The first case of COVID-19 in Chad occurred on March 19, 2020. The head of China's medical team in Chad was invited to help coordinate the response to the epidemic by the Chad National Anti-epidemic Technical Committee. China is donating medical supplies and medical expertise to fight the epidemic in Chad.  Economy  China has an influential role in Africa. Researchers have offered varying views of the phenomena. Some describe China as a rising hegemon that sees Africa as a means of exerting its diplomatic and political influence in the world order. AidData notes that China appears to reward African countries that vote with it at the United Nations. Some critics find parallels to colonialism in China's interactions with African nations. Others emphasize the mutual benefits. Whereas nations like Chad reap clear economic benefits in the form of numerous infrastructure programs funded by Chinese developmental assistance, China acquires much needed natural resources and new markets for its products.  Energy  N'Djamena JV Refinery In the 1990s, Western corporations had renewed interest in the oil deposits in Chad. The IFC, the World Bank, Western investors led by ExxonMobile, and the government of Chad under Idriss Deby, signed onto the Chad Cameroon Pipeline Project that would bring the crude oil from Chad to the Gulf of Guinea in Cameroon. The World Bank provided a loan on the condition that most of the money generated by the pipeline would be used to alleviate poverty among the people of Chad. However, President Deby's government funneled money from the pipeline into the purchases of arms. In 2006, while the World Bank was debating suspending the loans to Chad over violations of money usage, China presented Chad with alternative financing for the loan. Chad took the Chinese offer and thus rejected the World Bank's conditionalized loans. In 2007, China purchased rights to explore for oil in Block H, in the Bongor Basin. China had an interest in obtaining oil from Chad to support its economic growth. In return, China would provide loans and expertise to improve the economy in Chad. Since 2003, Chad had exported crude oil through the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline; however, it had to import the refined product. In September 2007, China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) reached an agreement with Chad to work together on the US$1 billion R√¥nier project. Completed in 2011, the project runs 300 km of pipeline from the oil fields of Chad to the N‚ÄôDjamena JV Refinery outside the capital city of N‚ÄôDjamena. Ownership of the refinery is split 60-40 between China and Chad. The refinery produces 20,000 barrels a day of gasoline, diesel, and fuel oil, and its associated power system supplies electricity to the capital, allowing Chad to become more self-sufficient in energy.  Development Projects  In the mid-1970s before breaking ties with Chad, China provided a US$50 million loan to Chad to build a bridge across the Chari River to open a route to Cameroon. Over US$50 million of additional support was provided in the 1980s under agreements between China and the government of President Hissene Habre. After reestablishing relations in 2006, China deepened engagement in Chad by diversifying from the oil sector. It is making significant investments in high-profile infrastructure projects in Chad. A 25-kilometer square industrial park is being developed by Soluxe International, who has also advanced US$150 million for its construction. Other projects include a cement factory in Baore, which was completed in 2011 and is expected to cut infrastructure costs by manufacturing the product domestically. This project was funded by a preferential loan from the Exim Bank of China. In 2011, Chad also signed a US$919 million deal with the Chinese Engineering Corporation (CAMC) to build a new international airport in Djermaya and the 40 km road to connect it to N‚ÄôDjamena; the project is ongoing. China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) has been building the US$5.6 million Chad railway network since 2012. Other assistance projects in Chad include road development, the construction of mobile telephone networks, the construction and renovation of hospitals, as well as the construction of a 30,000 seat stadium in N'Djamena. All of these projects show the diverse and extensive involvement of China in Chad.  Trade  The trade between China and Chad is not one-directional. Chad's top exports are crude petroleum, insect resins, other oily seeds, and cotton. In 2017, China was the second-largest importer of goods from Chad, at an estimated US$251 million. In the same year, China exported US$114 million worth of goods to Chad, making it the top exporter to Chad. Overall, Chad has a positive trade balance with China since it exports more than it imports.  Humanitarian Efforts  Although China's support for countries in Africa, such as Chad, is met with much skepticism by some, others point out the contributions made to Africa. During the cholera epidemic of 1971, China donated cholera vaccines and US$2.5 million to Chad to fight the outbreak. In 1977, China and Chad signed an agreement to send Chinese medical personal to Chad. Since resuming relations with Chad in 2006, China has renovated the Freedom Hospital of Chad and built housing for Chinese medical personnel and provided needed supplies. In the agricultural sector, China has supplied farm machinery, fertilizers, seed, and technical expertise to help with the production of cotton and food.  Diplomatic Offices  The Chinese embassy is located in N'Djamena. The Chadian embassy is located in Beijing. There are no additional consulates in either country.

The destruction of the Firdos Square statue was an event in the invasion of Iraq in 2003 that marked the symbolic end of the Battle of Baghdad. The event occurred on April 9, 2003. Significance In April 2002, the statue was erected in honor of the 65th birthday of Saddam Hussein. In the afternoon of April 9, 2003, a group of Iraqi civilians began to attack the statue. One such futile attempt by sledgehammer-wielding weightlifter Kadhem Sharif particularly caught media attention. Shortly after, an advance unit of the United States Marine Corps arrived at Firdos Square, secured the area and made contact with the foreign journalists who had been quartered in the Palestine Hotel at the square. After a couple of hours, the US Marines toppled the statue with a M88 armored recovery vehicle.G√∂ttke, F. Toppled, Rotterdam: Post Editions, 2010 According to the book Shooter, the first plan was to attach a cable between the M88 and the statue's torso area. Someone pointed out that if the cable snapped, it might whiplash and kill people. The alternate method chosen was to wrap a chain around the neck. Eventually, the M88 was able to topple the statue which was jumped and stomped upon by Iraqi citizens who then decapitated the statue and dragged it through the streets of the city hitting it with their shoes. The destruction of the statue was shown live on cable news networks as it happened and made the front pages of newspapers and covers of magazines throughout the world ‚Äì symbolizing the fall of Hussein's government. The images of the statue destruction provided a clear refutation of Information Minister Muhammad Saeed al-Sahhaf's reports that Iraq had been winning the war. A green sculpture by Bassem Hamad al-Dawiri, meant to symbolize the unity of Iraq, was installed on the empty plinth in June 2003 and remained there until it was removed and demolished in 2013.http://www.spikeartmagazine.com/articles/downward-spiral-4 Flags Before the statue was toppled, Marine Corporal Edward Chin of 1st Tank Battalion, 1st Marine Division (attached to 3rd Battalion 4th Marines) climbed the ladder and placed a U.S. flag over the statue's face. According to the book \\"Shooter\\", by Coughlin, Kuhlman, and Davis, other Marines of the 3/4 realized the PR disaster unfolding as the formerly cheering crowd became silent, with one woman shouting at the marines to remove the flag. Kuhlman had appropriated an Iraqi flag as a war trophy during a raid earlier in the war, and quickly unfurled it and headed for the statue. The crowd grabbed this flag and then placed it over the statue. Conflicting reports The event was widely publicized, but allegations that it had been staged were soon published. One picture from the event, published in the Evening Standard, was digitally altered to suggest a larger crowd.The Memory Hole > Doctored Photo from London Evening Standard A report by the Los Angeles Times stated it was an unnamed Marine colonel, not Iraqi civilians who had decided to topple the statue; and that a quick-thinking Army psychological operations team then used loudspeakers to encourage Iraqi civilians to assist and made it all appear spontaneous and Iraqi-inspired. According to Tim Brown at Globalsecurity.org: \\"It was not completely stage-managed from Washington, DC but it was not exactly a spontaneous Iraqi operation.\\" The Marines present at the time, 3rd Battalion 4th Marines as well as 1st Tank Battalion, maintain that the scene was not staged other than the assistance they provided.Coughlin, GySgt Jack and Kuhlman, Capt. Casey with Davis, Donald A., Shooter: The Autobiography of the Top-Ranked Marine Sniper, St. Martins, hardback edition ‚Äì 2005, paperback edition ‚Äì 2006. Robert Fisk described the event as \\"the most staged photo opportunity since Iwo Jima.\\" Regrets Kadhim Sharif Hassan Al-Jabbouri said in 2016 that he regrets playing a part in the destruction of the statue and wants it replaced. Kadhim used to repair the motorcycles of deposed Iraqi President Saddam Hussein before falling out of favor and being jailed for a year and a half and says that 14‚Äì15 members of his family were killed by the Ba'athist regime. When the Americans reached the outskirts of Baghdad, he got a sledgehammer to aid in toppling the statue. After the Americans arrived in the square, they put an American flag over the face of the statue, but Kadhim \\"couldn't accept this\\" and insisted they used an Iraqi flag, which he gave them. Khadhim says that after the invasion, \\"[things] started to get worse every year. There was infighting, corruption, killing, looting. Saddam has gone, but now in his place, we have 1,000 Saddams. I feel like Iraq has been stolen from us. Bush and Blair are definitely liars. They destroyed Iraq and took us back to zero and took us back to the Middle Ages or earlier. If I was a criminal I would kill them with my bare hands.\\" He subsequently said \\"when I go past that statue, I feel pain and shame. I ask myself, \\"Why did I topple this statue?\\". I'd like to put it back up, to rebuild it. I'd put it back up but I'm afraid I would be killed.\\" See also *Nick Popaditch ReferencesFurther reading * Category:Iraq War Category:Buildings and structures in Baghdad Category:2000s in Baghdad Category:Destroyed landmarks in Iraq Category:Destroyed sculptures Category:Iconoclasm Category:Monuments and memorials in Iraq Category:Photography in Iraq Category:Sculptures of men Category:Statues of presidents Category:Statues in Iraq Category:Removed statues Category:Vandalized works of art Category:George W.

IRMA can be difficult to distinguish from and is likely a precursor to retinal neovascularization. One way to distinguish IRMA from retinal neovascularization is to perform fluorescein angiography. Since IRMA blood vessels are patent, unlike neovascular vessels, they do not leak, and therefore exhibit hyperfluorescence on fluorescein angiography. IRMA is deeper in the retina than neovascularization, has blurrier edges, is more of a burgundy than a red, does not appear on the optic disc, and is usually seen after a shorter period of poorly controlled diabetes than neovascularization.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1935 to 1971 as a member of the Social Credit Party. He held numerous cabinet portfolios in the government of Ernest Manning from 1943 to 1968. Of the original 1935 Socred caucus, Hooke was the only member to serve continuously in the legislature until the party's defeat in 1971. Early life Alfred John Hooke was born on February 25, 1905, in Whitecroft, Gloucestershire, United Kingdom. His family moved to the province of Alberta in Canada in 1913. At the age of 13 Hooke left school and joined the work force as a hired hand. He returned to school and completed his studies three years later. He became a teacher in 1926 and remained one until his election to the Alberta legislature in 1935. Political career Hooke joined the Social Credit movement at its beginning; he was familiar with William Aberhart through his work as a school teacher and became involved with Aberhart as a speaker on Social Credit theory. Although reluctant at first, he was urged by people in the town of Rocky Mountain House to put his name up for the Social Credit nomination in the Red Deer electoral district. He faced nine other candidates for the nomination and headed the polls on the first ballot, upon which six were eliminated. The other four names went to the Social Credit advisory committee, which chose him to run in the 1935 Alberta general election. Hooke defeated incumbent MLA William Payne and three other candidates with a large majority. Redistribution in 1940 created a separate electoral district for Rocky Mountain House. Hooke ran there in the election held that year and won a clear majority on the first ballot, defeating two other candidates. Premier Ernest Manning appointed Hooke to cabinet as Provincial Secretary on June 1, 1943. Hooke ran for a third term in the 1944 general election and won by a landslide. Hooke briefly held two cabinet portfolios when Manning appointed him Minister of Economic Affairs on April 20, 1945. He ran for a fourth term in the 1948 Alberta general election and was returned to office with another large victory. After the election Manning gave the post of Provincial Secretary to Clarence Gerhart while Hooke kept the Economic Affairs portfolio. Hooke ran for a fifth term and won easily in the 1952 Alberta general election. After the election Hooke became Minister of Public Works. Hooke stood for his sixth term in the 1955 Alberta general election. He defeated two other candidates with a solid majority to return to office. Manning re-appointed Hooke Provincial Secretary and also made him Minister of Municipal Affairs. The 1959 Alberta general election saw Hooke win his seventh term easily. He kept the Municipal Affairs portfolio while the position of Provincial Secretary was assigned to Allen Patrick. Hooke ran for his eighth term in the 1963 Alberta general election. He was returned with another massive majority. In 1966 NDP MLA Garth Turcott and NDP leader Neil Reimer leveled accusations of corruption and misusing public office for personal gain against Edgar Hinman and Hooke. The unproven accusations began attracting nationwide attention and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police were called in to ensure the safety of Hooke and his family. Hooke ran for re- election to his ninth term in the 1967 Alberta general election. Pundits at the time predicted Hooke had very little chance at re-election. He faced two other candidates in the race, including Independent William Sinclair, who had been picked by federal Social Credit leader Robert Thompson to run against Hooke. Hooke won with another massive majority. Manning returned Hooke to cabinet as Minister of Public Welfare to bring the department under control as it became the highest spending department. He held that portfolio for a year, after which he was appointed Minister of Lands and Forests on July 16, 1968. Hooke ran for leadership of the Social Credit party in the 1968 leadership race; he finished last on the first ballot. Harry Strom, the new leader and the new premier, dropped Hooke from the cabinet. Hooke retired from provincial politics at dissolution of the legislature in 1971. He was the only one of the original 1935 caucus to serve continuously until Social Credit was defeated. The closest to him were Manning himself, who resigned as premier and MLA in 1968, and William Tomyn who, though a member of the 1935 intake who stood down in 1971, was defeated in 1952 and did not return until 1959. Late life After leaving office in 1971 Hooke wrote the book 30+5 I Know, I was There about his early life and his political career. In 1980 Hooke wrote \\"Looking Backward to Go Forward about economic activity in the 1930s and how the downfall of the economy is repeating itself in modern times.

There are two categories of AFP tests: tests performed on serum (blood plasma), and tests performed on amniotic fluid. Tests performed on serum are further categorized by the reason for performing the test: maternal serum, adult tumor marker, and pediatric tumor marker. Serum The standard is a quantitative test, reporting a measured concentration of AFP in the sample, but there is also a less expensive qualitative test, reporting only that the concentration is normal or high. The qualitative test is appropriate only in some circumstances. The resulting test report should specify the assay method and equipment used, and the report of a quantitative test should also provide a reference range for the test result. Many laboratories report reference ranges that are based on all other samples tested in that laboratory, necessarily including samples with abnormal AFP concentrations due to disease. Superior reference ranges are produced by research on healthy subjects. AFP test results often are reported as either ng/ml or MoM (multiple of the median, where the median is calculated for an appropriate reference population). Maternal testing for fetal screening Abnormally elevated AFP in the serum of a pregnant woman can have one or more of these sources: * a problem with the fetus * a problem with the placenta * a tumor or liver disease in the woman * a normally elevated AFP in the fetus or woman (some people naturally have very high AFP) Usual follow-up steps include (1) a prenatal ultrasound exam to look for fetal abnormalities and/or (2) measurement of AFP in amniotic fluid obtained via amniocentesis. Maternal serum AFP (MSAFP) varies by orders of magnitude during the course of a normal pregnancy. MSAFP increases rapidly until about 32 weeks gestation, then decreases gradually. After the pregnancy ends it decreases rapidly, with a half-life of about 5 days. Typically, MSAFP is measured in the beginning of the second trimester (14‚Äì16 weeks). It may be measured alone or as part of a package of routine prenatal screening tests, such as a triple test or quad test. Because MSAFP test results must be interpreted according to the gestational age, they often are reported in terms of multiple of the median (MoM). Because the median is calculated from tests of other women's pregnancies at the same gestational age, in effect MoM is independent of gestational age, but depend on accurate gestational dating. A typical normal range is 0.5 to 2.0 or 2.5 MoM. * MSAFP above normal is seen in multiple gestation, when there is placental abruption, as well as in a number of fetal abnormalities, such as neural tube defects including spina bifida and anencephaly, and abdominal wall defects. Other possibility is error in the date of the gestation. Mothers with Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase genetic variant also have more frequent elevated MSAFP. Rarely, high MSAFP is due to endodermal sinus tumor (EST) or another germ cell tumor containing EST. These tumors can occur in the pregnant woman (often as an ovarian tumor) or in the fetus. * MSAFP below normal is associated with a smaller number of conditions, including Down syndrome and Trisomy 18. Diabetic patients also have lower levels. Patients with abnormal MSAFP need to undergo detailed obstetric ultrasonography. The information is then used to decide whether to proceed with amniocentesis. Genetic counseling usually is offered when the screening test result is positive. If a woman is already getting a Quad test for Down Syndrome screening, then the AFP-marker that is part of this test provides the screen result for neural-tube and abdominal wall defects. However, if a woman received a 1st Trimester Combined screen for Down Syndrome, which does not include AFP, then some physicians will specifically order an AFP-only test in the 2nd trimester to screen for neural tube/abdominal wall defects. However, because AFP-based screening only has an 80-85% sensitivity for neural tube and abdominal wall defects, many maternal- fetal medicine specialists and some obstetricians do not bother ordering an AFP test and instead perform detailed \\"Level-II\\" ultrasounds on all of their patients, which, in competent hands, results in a 97% sensitivity for these defects. In fact, these physicians might disregard the AFP-related information on neural tube/abdominal wall defects and do the detailed ultrasound to look for these defects even if the patient has a \\"normal\\" AFP reading. Tumor marker Principal tumors that secrete AFP are endodermal sinus tumor (yolk sac carcinoma), hepatoblastoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In patients with AFP-secreting tumors, serum levels of AFP often correlate with tumor size. Resection is usually associated with a fall in serum levels. Serum levels are useful in assessing response to treatment. Like any elevated tumor marker, elevated AFP by itself is not diagnostic, only suggestive. Tumor markers are used primarily to monitor the result of a treatment (e.g. chemotherapy). If levels of AFP go down after treatment, the tumor is not growing. In the case of babies, after treatment AFP should go down faster than it would normally. A temporary increase in AFP immediately following chemotherapy may indicate not that the tumor is growing but rather that it is shrinking (and releasing AFP as the tumor cells die). = Nonseminomatous germ cell tumor= In the context of evidence-based medicine, AFP is validated at the highest level as a tumor marker for use in patients with nonseminomatous germ cell tumors. There are case reports of elevated AFP associated with teratoma. However, some of these case reports involve infants but do not correct for the normal elevation of AFP in infants, while others ignore the likelihood that teratoma (and other germ cell tumors) may in fact be mixed tumors containing elements of endodermal sinus tumor. AFP is normally elevated in infants, and because teratoma is the single most common kind of tumor in infants, several studies have provided reference ranges for AFP in normal infants. Perhaps the most useful is this equation: log Y = 7.397 - 2.622.log (X + 10), where X = age in days and Y = AFP level in nanograms per milliliter. When neonatal AFP is above normal (after adjustment for age), a low fraction of AFP-L3 is reassuring. =Hepatocellular carcinoma= For hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), AFP cannot be considered to be specifically diagnostic of HCC, levels of AFP may be elevated in serum from patients with chronic disease; for example, research has indicated that AFP is not useful for screening in patients suffering from cirrhosis or Hepatitis C and therefore elevated AFP in these patients may not be indicative, or be only suggestive, of HCC. AFP is considered a useful marker for post-treatment monitoring of HCC patients (e.g. for treatment efficacy or tumor recurrence). The value of such tests may be improved by parallel monitoring of other markers. AFP-L3, an isoform of AFP which binds Lens culinaris agglutinin, can be particularly useful in early identification of aggressive tumors associated with HCC. =Other tumor= Rare AFP- secreting tumor types include carcinoma in a mixed M√ºllerian tumor. The Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor, which itself is rare, rarely secretes AFP. In Wilms tumor AFP is rarely elevated, but when it is elevated it may serve as a marker of disease progression or recurrence. Other Increased serum levels in adults are also seen in acute hepatitis, colitis and ataxia telangiectasia. Increased serum levels of alpha-fetoprotein are sometimes found in Citrullinemia and Argininosuccinate synthetase deficiency.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=gene‚àÇ=citrin  Amniotic fluid AFP in amniotic fluid has one or two sources. The fetus normally excretes AFP into its urine, hence into the amniotic fluid. A fetus with one of three broad categories of defects also releases AFP by other means. These categories are open neural tube defect, open abdominal wall defect, and skin disease or other failure of the interior or exterior body surface. Abnormally elevated AFP in amniotic fluid can have one or more of many different causes: * normal elevation. 75% of AF AFP test results in the range 2.0 to 4.9 MoM are false positives: the baby is normal. * open neural tube defect * open abdominal wall defect * congenital nephrosis * others CSF In normal infants, AFP in CSF is: * median 61 kIU/L (5th-95th centile: 2-889 kIU/L) in infants -69 to 31 days old * median 1.2 kIU/L (5th-95th centile: 0.1-12.5 kIU/L) in infants 32 to 110 days old Levels of AFP in CSF decline with gestational age in proportion to levels of AFP in serum References External links  Category:Abnormal clinical and laboratory findings for blood ","title":"Elevated alpha-fetoprotein"},{"id":"26911394","text":"Charles or Charlie Watts may refer to: Sportspeople * Charlie Watts (footballer) (1870‚Äì1924), English footballer * Charles Watts (cricketer, born 1894) (1894‚Äì1979), English cricketer * Charles Watts (cricketer, born 1905) (1905‚Äì1985), English cricketer  Other people  * Charles Watts (secularist) (1836‚Äì1906), English writer, publisher and secularist * Charles Albert Watts (1858‚Äì1946), his son, English editor, publisher and secularist * C.

Enzyklop√§die des deutschen Ligafu√üballs 7. Vereinslexikon. Kassel: Agon-Sportverlag. . __TOC__ History The club fielded strong lower division teams and won its way through to the Oberliga Berlin-Brandenburg/Staffel B (I) in 1932. The following year German football was reorganized under the Third Reich into 16 top-flight regional divisions and BEWAG was not included as part of the new Gauliga Berlin-Brandenburg which was made up of only 12 teams in a single division, rather than the 20 teams of the Oberliga's two divisions. The team was renamed Sportverein BEWAG Berlin in 1932 and was promoted to Gauliga play in 1936. In 1938, they were again renamed becoming SV Elektra Berlin, and they made an appearance in the opening round of the Tschammerspokal, predecessor of today's DFB-Pokal (German Cup). SV earned mid-table results over the next three seasons before being relegated following an 11th-place finish in 1941. After the end World War II in 1945, most sports and football clubs in Germany were dissolved by occupying Allied authorities. The club was re-established in 1949 as Betriebssportgemeinschaft BEWAG and was renamed BSG Turbine BEWAG in 1950. They made their second appearance in cup play, this time in the opening round of the FDGB-Pokal (East German Cup), and again went out in the opening round. From the late 1950s on into the early 1970s, BEWAG was primarily a third-division side before settling into fourth-tier play as part of the separate football competition that emerged in Soviet-occupied East Germany. In 1974, they took on the name BSG Turbine Berlin and, in 1984, BSG Turbine EKB Treptow. A single nationwide football competition was restored after the reunification of the country in 1990 and the club adopted the name SV Turbine Berlin. After the fall of 1994, Turbine joined Lok Sch√∂neweide ‚Äì established in 1925 as the rail worker's club Reichsbahnsportverein Berlin ‚Äì to form the present day side FC Treptow which was named for the former southeastern city district of Treptow which is home to the club. In 1996, the football section of former East German club NARVA Berlin joined FC and the newly combined side took up the place of NARVA in the Landesliga Berlin (VI) where they remained until being sent down in 2001. Today the team plays in the Kreisliga Berlin (IX).

Born in Canada in 1867, Johnston was commissioned in the British Army in 1888. An artillery instructor, he served in British India and in 1904 was placed on secondment with the New Zealand Military Forces for three years before returning to the United Kingdom. He was serving in New Zealand as Inspector of Artillery when the First World War broke out and joined the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) that was being raised for service abroad. He served at Gallipoli as commander of the artillery of the New Zealand and Australian Division and fulfilled the same role on the Western Front with the New Zealand Division. During the war he received several decorations in recognition of his war service. He briefly commanded the New Zealand Division while it was stationed in Germany on occupation duty after the war before being discharged from the NZEF. He commanded the artillery of the 52nd (Lowland) Division from 1919 to 1924 before he retired from the British Army. He died in Dar es Salaam in what is now Tanzania at the age of 79. Early life George Napier Johnston was born on 20 August 1867 in Quebec, Canada. He entered the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario in 1884 and graduated four years later. After graduating from Kingston, Johnston accepted a commission with the Royal Garrison Artillery of the British Army and for the next ten years served in a variety of postings. In 1898 he was promoted to captain. Johnston had completed a four-year term in India as an artillery instructor when he was seconded to the New Zealand Military Forces in 1904. He served as a staff officer with artillery units for three years before resigning his position to go back to the United Kingdom. He returned to New Zealand in 1911 to serve as Director of Artillery. First World War At the commencement of the First World War, Johnston was a major and Inspector of the Artillery. In response to the outbreak of the war in Europe, the New Zealand government authorised the raising of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) for war service overseas. Johnston was appointed commander of the Field Artillery Brigade and embarked from Wellington with the main body of the NZEF in October 1914. The NZEF was intended for service on the Western Front, but following the entry of Turkey into the war it was diverted to Egypt while in transit. Gallipoli When the New Zealand and Australian Division was formed in 1915, Johnston was appointed commander of its artillery. This only consisted of a single brigade of 16 guns, including four howitzers, much less than the normal divisional complement of artillery. Despite the lack of guns and ammunition, his work with the artillery was highly regarded during the Gallipoli Campaign. In October 1915, prior to the Allied evacuation from Gallipoli, he was made a temporary brigadier-general. Western Front On establishment of the New Zealand Division in 1916 Johnston was appointed commander of its artillery and promoted to lieutenant-colonel while retaining his temporary rank of brigadier-general. The division deployed to France in April 1916 and his artillery spent a period in the Armentieres sector supporting the division's infantry during trench raids. Two months after arriving in France he was appointed to the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for services in the field. In September 1916 the divisional artillery saw extensive action during the Battle of the Somme. It supporting the troops for 56 consecutive days during the Somme battle by providing well coordinated barrages and counter fire which helped the infantry to take the majority of their objectives. This feat owed much to the proficiency of Johnston, who was awarded the Croix de Officier of the L√©gion d'honneur in May 1917. This French award is uncommon to New Zealanders: fewer than 100 awards have been made, and Johnston was one of only 14 members of the New Zealand Military Forces to be decorated with the Legion of Honour during the war. New Zealand artillery in action during the Battle of Broodseinde, 12 October 1917 Johnston's artillery performed well during the Battle of Messines and in the early stages of the Third Battle of Ypres, overcoming difficult conditions during the New Zealand Division's attack at Broodseinde on 4 October 1917. As ground conditions continued to deteriorate in the days leading up to the First Battle of Passchendaele, Johnston warned the commander of the division, Major-General Andrew Russell, that his artillery were not adequately prepared. Mud had affected the positioning of his artillery and prevented sufficient supplies of ammunition getting through to his guns. When the division attacked on 12 October, it failed to fulfil its key objectives. During the Hundred Days' Offensive, which began in August 1918, the nature of the fighting changed from relatively static trench combat to more mobile and open warfare as the Germans retreated in the face of Allied advances. Consequently, Johnston had to alter his tactics and use of artillery. He devised a command structure whereby his artillery batteries were attached to advancing infantry and, under the command of a senior officer at brigade headquarters, would move forward in a staggered fashion to provide continued fire support as the division advanced. The artillery of adjacent British divisions were relatively static in comparison and not as able to support rapid forward movement. By the end of the war, Johnston had been mentioned in despatches eight times and appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. In early 1919 he was promoted to temporary major- general and commanded the New Zealand Division while it was stationed in Germany on occupation duty. He oversaw the disbandment of the division later that year. Discharged from the NZEF, he rejoined the British Army. Later life A portrait of Johnston, painted by George Edmund Butler in 1919 On his return to the British Army, Johnston reverted to his substantive rank of lieutenant-colonel and was appointed Commander Royal Artillery, 52nd (Lowland) Division. Promoted to the rank of colonel in April 1920, he remained with the division until his retirement from the military in 1924 with the honorary rank of brigadier-general. While serving with the 52nd Division he contributed an introduction to the history of the New Zealand Artillery during the First World War, and was also made a Companion of the Order of the Bath. He died on 3 April 1947 in Dar es Salaam in Tanganyika (now Tanzania).

History Upon the annexation of Pegu by the British in 1852‚Äì53, Thayet was a subdivision of Prome district; but in 1870 it was created as a separate jurisdiction and placed under a deputy-commissioner. Prior to 1896 Thayet District was in the Irrawaddy Division of Lower Burma, but it was transferred to Upper Burma for administrative purposes that year. Ecology The principal wild animals have historically been elephants, rhinoceros, tigers, leopards, black bears and wild hogs. Silver pheasants and partridges are found in large numbers, especially in the mountains. Geography The district has an area of 4750 square kilometers; the total rainfall in a sample year was about 40 inches. On the west is the Arakan Yoma range, and on the east the Pegu Yomas; and the face of the country, where it does not rise into mountains, is everywhere broken by low ranges of hills, many of which are barren and lack vegetation. The greater part of the district is wooded, and the mountains to the east and west are covered with forests. The chief river is the Ayeyarwady River, which traverses Thayet from north to south. The drainage finds its way to the Ayeyarwady River by three main streams, the Pwon, Ma-htun and Ma-de on the west, and by two, the Kye-ni and Hput on the east. Thayet has several salt and hot springs; petroleum has been found (three oil-wells were sunk in 1883 at Pedaukpin, but they were found unprofitable and abandoned), and extensive lime quarries exist a few miles south of the town of Thayetmyo. The limestone mining started sometime in the 1960s to supply a cement factory in Thayetmyo. The limestone quarries were rehabilitated in the early 1980s with German help (GTZ) when the aerial ropeway was replaced by trucks as the principal means of limestone transport from the quarry to the factory. Rehabilitation was required because for many years, only limestone was mined and no overburden removed. Economy The chief products are rice, cotton, oil-seeds and tobacco; cutch is also very abundant, as is the manufacture of dye-stuff. In addition to limestone, coal has been found in the district, and a few shallow oil wells are in use. There are 403 square kilometers of reserved forest.

She was daughter and perhaps also wife (sources vary) of Kai Bahman. Rule Bahman becomes ill when Humay is 6 months pregnant, and upon realizing that his death is imminent, appoints Humay as vice-regent until the birth of her child. She ascended to the throne and ruled Iran after the death of Bahman. After her ascension, she gives birth to a son, Kai Darab, whom she keeps hidden for 8 months. Eventually she places Darab in a box and sets it to float down the Euphrates, where he is found by a dyer, who saves Darab and raises him. During Humay's reign, a Roman army assaults the western edges of the Iranian Empire, and Humay sends an army under Rashnwad to fight them. During this conflict, Rashnwad finds Darab, and recognizes him as Humay's child. When they return to the capital after defeating the Romans, Humay retires and hands the throne down to her son after 32 years of rule.

At 18, he started the game against Atl√©tico alongside 36-year-old Mat√≠as Almeyda in midfield. A tough tackling midfielder who is useful on the ball, Cirigliano has been likened to a cross between Xavi and Javier Mascherano. On July 18, 2013, Cirigliano joined the newly promoted Serie A club Hellas Verona on a loan deal. On the first days of July, 2014, Cirigliano returns to River Plate coming back from his loan and attends practice. He refuses to travel to the pre-season in an attempt to negotiate a definitive transfer to Hellas Verona, which subsequently fails. Therefore, coach Marcelo Gallardo separates him from the rest of the squad. On September 10, 2014, after being pardoned by the director, Cirigliano starts practice with River Plate's reserve team in order to re-join the squad and be able to play again. On July 20, 2015, FC Dallas announced the deal has been reached to take the player on-loan from River Plate.

He founded the Edinburgh Festival Chorus in 1965, the Chorus of the Orchestre de Paris in 1975, and the Concertgebouw Orchestra Chorus in Amsterdam in 1979. He also worked with the Scottish Opera Chorus 1966‚Äì74 and directed the London Symphony Chorus 1969‚Äì76. For his work with the LSO Chorus, he won three Grammy Awards. He was also a composer, mainly of religious works, but also a ballet and an opera. Biography Arthur Oldham was born in London in 1926. When he was age 14, his mother committed suicide by gassing herself in an oven, and he was brought up in Wallington, at that time in Surrey.Conrad Wilson, Arthur Oldham, jstor He won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music, where he studied composition under Herbert Howells. He then became Benjamin Britten's only private pupil at Aldeburgh between 1945 and 1951. (He claims that the bar lines on the manuscript of Peter Grimes were his work.) He and Britten came into conflict over their ideas about choral music, but they later worked together in Edinburgh on Britten's Voices for Today, Op. 75, and the War Requiem. Until 1968 the only published vocal score of Britten's The Little Sweep was the piano duet and percussion version prepared by Arthur Oldham. He was appointed musical director of the Ballet Rambert in 1945, aged only 19. His music first came to public notice in 1946, when his ballet Mr Punch was performed by the Ballet Rambert at Sadler's Wells, and was included in the Rambert's 1947‚Äì48 tour of Australia and New Zealand. Several of his own pieces were heard at early Aldeburgh Festivals. He also composed for the Royal Ballet for a time. He arranged Britten's Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge (a work for string orchestra) for full orchestra, for the ballet Le R√™ve de L√©onor, choreographed by Frederick Ashton. This had its first performance on 26 April 1949 at the Prince's Theatre, London, by the Ballet de Paris de Roland Petit. In 1952, after Edmund Rubbra pulled out of the project, Oldham provided a variation for Variations on an Elizabethan Theme, a collaborative work with other contributions by Lennox Berkeley, Britten, Imogen Holst, Humphrey Searle, Michael Tippett and William Walton. That year, his modern treatment of Thomas Arne's pastiche opera Love in a Village was staged by the English Opera Group. Criticism of the work led to a nervous breakdown and his working outside music for some time. He then became a Roman Catholic and was employed as a teacher at Scotus Academy and choirmaster at St Mary's Roman Catholic Cathedral, Edinburgh. He introduced Scottish pre-Reformation music such as Robert Carver's 19-part motet O Bone Jesu. Britten's Missa Brevis had its first performance in Scotland under Oldham's direction. His work at the Cathedral was noticed by people such as Carlo Maria Giulini and Georg Solti. The first performance in Scotland (and one of the earliest in the United Kingdom) of Mahler's Symphony No. 8 \\"Symphony of a Thousand\\" was scheduled for the opening night of the 1965 Edinburgh Festival, with the Scottish National Orchestra, but a suitable choir was lacking. Lord Harewood and Alexander Gibson approached Oldham to create one and train the singers, and the Edinburgh Festival Chorus was born. Under his direction for the next 12 years, the chorus went on to participate in major works such as Verdi's Requiem (under Giulini), Tippett's A Child of Our Time (under Gibson), Bach's Magnificat (under Herbert von Karajan), Prokofiev's Seven, They are Seven (under Gennady Rozhdestvensky], Mahler's \\"Resurrection\\" Symphony (under Leonard Bernstein), Brahms's A German Requiem (under Daniel Barenboim), and Stravinsky's Symphony of Psalms (under Claudio Abbado). He was instrumental in the first Scottish performances of Britten's War Requiem, under Alexander Gibson. He also continued with the St Mary's Cathedral Choir until 1971. Oldham was the recipient of the 1973 St Mungo Prize, awarded to the individual who has done most in the previous three years to improve and promote the city of Glasgow. He also worked with the London Symphony Chorus between 1969 and 1976, winning three Grammy Awards. He left for Paris in 1977 to create the Orchestre de Paris's Chorus at Daniel Barenboim's request.New York Times, 12 May 2003 For his farewell appearance in Edinburgh he wrote Psalms in Time of War, which was performed at the 1977 Edinburgh Festival. His first project with the Paris chorus was Berlioz's Te Deum, under Barenboim, for which he had auditioned 1,700 people to create a chorus of 200 singers. From 1987 to 1994 he commuted weekly between Paris and Edinburgh, working with both choirs. In 1992, the Edinburgh Chorus presented Schoenberg's Moses und Aron. From 1994, he worked with the Orchestre de Paris Chorus exclusively. He celebrated 20 years with the chorus in 1996 with a new work, The Will of Villon. He retired from that chorus in 2002. Arthur Oldham died in Villejuif in 2003, aged 76. Faur√©'s Requiem was performed in his memory. He was married twice, and left 2 sons and 2 daughters. The Arthur Oldham/Michael Lester-Cribb Memorial Fund has been created to honour the joint work of Oldham and Michael Lester-Cribb, the Edinburgh Festival Chorus's pianist.

After months of saying that the distribution rights to the film would be auctioned off immediately after the premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, Smith controversially announced that he was instead going to self-distribute the picture under the SModcast Pictures banner with a traveling show in select cities. On June 28, 2011, Smith announced a one-week run in Quentin Tarantino's New Beverly Cinema (making the film eligible for Academy Award consideration). The film was released via video on demand on September 1, 2011 through Lionsgate, in select theaters for a special one-night-only engagement on September 23, 2011 (via SModcast Pictures), and on home video October 18, 2011. Plot Teenagers Travis, Jarod, and Billy Ray drive to meet a woman named Sarah in response to an invitation for group sex. Along the way, they accidentally sideswipe the parked vehicle of Sheriff Wynan as Wynan is engaged in sex with another man. Wynan returns to the station and tells his deputy Pete to go and look for the vehicle that hit his. Sarah tricks the boys into drinking drugged beer, and they pass out. Jarod wakes up in a covered cage and realizes he is inside Five Points Trinity Church, a fanatically conservative church, after he identifies church leader (and Sarah's father) Abin Cooper. Cooper begins a long, hate- filled sermon. His followers ritually murder a captive gay man and drop him into a crawl space where Travis and Billy Ray are bound together. Cooper begins preparing Jarod to be murdered in the same way, but stops when he notices Pete driving up to the church. Travis and Billy Ray manage to cut themselves free, but are overheard by Sarah's husband, Caleb. Travis fails to escape his binds, so Billy Ray abandons him. Caleb chases Billy Ray into a room stocked with weapons, where the two shoot each other. Pete hears the gunshots and calls Wynan for back-up, but is shot and killed by Cooper's son Mordechai. Cooper blackmails Wynan, telling him to stay away or he will reveal Wynan's homosexuality to his wife. Wynan calls Agent Joseph Keenan of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, who begins setting up outside the church. Travis breaks free, arms himself and plans to shoot the congregation, but witnesses Jarod being held captive in the church. Travis instead flees the church, but is mistaken for a member by Wynan and shot. Keenan tries to reason with the group, but Cooper shoots an ATF agent. A shoot-out erupts and Wynan is killed. The ATF orders Keenan to stage a full military raid on the church to eliminate all witnesses. Keenan passes the order on to ATF Agent Harry, who refuses. During the shoot-out, Sarah's daughter Cheyenne escapes and is captured by an ATF agent. Sarah kills him as he is about to shoot Cheyenne. Cheyenne returns to the house and frees Jarod, begging him to help her hide the congregation's children. He refuses and she attacks him. Sarah attacks Jarod, and Cheyenne accidentally shoots and kills Sarah. Jarod decides to help Cheyenne hide the children. They plead with Keenan to spare the children but are both killed by Harry. The shoot-out is interrupted by a mysterious trumpet blast. The church congregation members lower their weapons and run outside rejoicing, claiming that the Rapture has occurred and taunting the ATF. The film cuts to a government briefing several days later. Keenan reports that he head-butted Cooper and took the rest of the congregation into custody. He explains that the trumpet noises were a prank by a group of local college students irritated with Cooper. Keenan is promoted despite disobeying a direct order from his superiors. They explain that their initial decision to kill the members of the congregation was personal and that they are satisfied with incarcerating the congregation without trials, upsetting Keenan. Cooper is seen pacing around his cell singing and sermonizing until another prisoner tells him to shut up. Original ending During various interactive Q&As; for the film, Smith has stated that the original ending continued with the Rapture happening and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse descending on the scene.

In April 2007, Smith revealed the title of the movie to be Red State and said that it was inspired by infamous pastor Fred Phelps and the Waco siege, or as Smith claimed, \\"very much about that subject matter, that point of view and that position taken to the absolute extreme. It is certainly not Phelps himself but it's very much inspired by a Phelps (like) figure.\\" The first draft was finished in August 2007 with Smith wanting to film it before Zack and Miri Make a Porno. Setting it apart from the majority of his other films, Smith made it clear that Red State was a horror film, stating that there would be no toilet humor in the film. While speaking at a Q&A; event in London on October 13, 2009, Smith stated that funding had been secured for Red State but that he wanted to proceed with Hit Somebody and delay filming Red State for a year. Another reason cited for the delay was that Smith held a superstition about dying after making his tenth movie, and that he did not want to leave an \\"unpleasant, nasty\\" film as his last. In February 2010, he talked about his project with CINSSU, saying that he was working through the project's financial challenges; he considered obtaining funding through investments from his fans but this idea was later dropped. Film producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein, who had been involved in the distribution of all Kevin Smith films with the exception of Mallrats and Cop Out, passed on supporting Red State with necessary funding. The budget was provided from two main private investor groups that raised the $4 million, one based in New York, one in Canada. On July 24, 2010, it was also reported that actor Michael Parks had signed on to the film in a starring role, and on September 5, 2010, Smith confirmed that Matt L. Jones was also cast. On the September 20 edition of his and Ralph Garman's podcast Hollywood Babble-on, Smith announced that John Goodman had joined the cast. Smith edited the film throughout production and showed a first cut at the film's wrap party. In July 2010, Smith stated on his Twitter account that \\"God-willing, Sundance in Jan for RED STATE.\\" On November 8, Smith announced on Twitter that the movie was viewed by Sundance, to determine if it was eligible for entry in the 2011 festival. On December 1, Smith announced on his Plus One podcast that Red State would be screened at the 27th Sundance Film Festival in the non-competition section. In the \\"Commercial\\" episode of Comic Book Men, Smith cited Bryan Johnson's film Vulgar as being an inspiration for Red State. During the post-production process, Smith announced on social media that he was accepting song submissions for the soundtrack of the film. At least one fan-submitted song was used. Marketing and distribution Throughout the months of November and December, teaser posters were released featuring characters from the movie in auctions via his Twitter account with the winning bidder hosting the poster exclusively on their website, while the money raised by the auction went to charity. Smith released a teaser trailer for the film on December 23, 2010. Although Smith had announced plans to auction off the rights to Red State to distributors attending his Sundance screening of the film, he revealed that was merely a ploy and Smith planned to self-distribute as a traveling roadshow beginning March 5 at Radio City Music Hall, and would tour the film across North America before releasing Red State directly to DVD and VOD. Auction controversy Controversy soon erupted after Smith's speech at the film's debut screening at Sundance. Although Smith had decided to self-distribute the film, according to the film's producer Jonathan Gordon the option of self-distributing the movie was not considered at first: > Hiring longtime specialty exec Dinerstein (whose film marketing consultancy > also arranges self-distribution deals), bringing aboard Cinetic Media (which > arranged service deals for sale titles like last year's Banksy doc \\"Exit > Through the Gift Shop\\") with co-seller WME, and slapping the word \\"March\\" at > the end of the teaser trailer has led many to suspect Smith has a self- > distribution backup plan should an attractive offer fail to materialize. But > is self-distribution or a service deal even an option they're considering? > \\"No,\\" says Gordon. \\"We want to have someone who loves the movie, understands > it, knows how to handle it and get the most out of it.\\" The sudden announcement of self-distribution after initially announcing an auction provoked a backlash from the media and accusations of dishonesty, with some analysts commenting that they watched Smith \\"implode\\" and that he had \\"lost cred\\" and one prominent buyer saying, \\"He stole two hours and insulted every one of us ... He was a little like the twisted preacher Michael Parks played in his film. It became life imitating art.\\" Smith joked about the people who had expected to buy the film at his Sundance speech: > Now, we're obviously not selling the movie, so I'm sorry to ... the > distributors in the room. ... Number one: I'm not that sorry. It's a fucking > film festival. Come see a movie. ... no hard feelings. Hopefully you don't > mind. ... Thank you for coming. ... I will say this in my own defense ... a > lot of youse work for studios ... you guys make a lot of trailers - you've > lied to me many times. ... I've seen many trailers where I'm like \\"this is > awesome\\", and I put my money down, and I'm like \\"You fucking lying whores\\". > So ladies and gentleman, as you can see we're up here alienating all our > future work, just burning the bridge as we cross it, and ah, that means > there's probably not going to be much studio help for me and Jon in the > future. According to some writers, the internet community seemed to galvanize in response to the controversy, \\"...it seems Kevin Smith finally has the Internet critical community united on the same side: against him.\\" Smith countered allegations of dishonesty by saying, \\"And I told the truth, in my tweet. I said, 'If I get to Sundance, I intend to pick my distributor in the room, auction-style.' Auction-style‚Äîdid I not do that? ... I stood up there and said that I'm gonna take my movie‚ÄîI'm gonna take it out and try not to spend money doing it.\\" Kim Masters, editor-at-large for The Hollywood Reporter, interviewed associates close to Smith about his alleged career \\"implosion\\" at the Sundance debut of his film and the events leading up to it: > Smith was one of the first in the business to have a website and sell > merchandise ‚Äì pieces of film from his movies and action figures ‚Äì to fans. > But one source who has worked with him thinks Smith might be one of the > first filmmakers to exploit and then be undone by social media, and that > access to social media has eliminated any filter that might have protected > Smith from emotional outbursts that, in this person's view, have undermined > his career. Smith responded to Masters, saying that it was \\"a Jerry Maguire moment. I've got a little fish in a plastic bag and one idealistic secretary on my side, and the Bob Sugars seem to be leaning in doorways, smirking.\\" Indie Film 2.0 Smith described his motivations, strategy, and thought process behind the marketing method at his Sundance appearance and on various podcast shows, Q&As;, and tweets. He described the strategy as carefully planned with his business partners, including Jonathan Gordon, who had recently had an interesting experience as a short-lived executive at Universal. Smith did not take a salary for the film, noting that the plan was to pay investors back first. In his Sundance Q&A;, Smith compared the Indie scene from the 1990s to the present film landscape. He described the traditional film marketing system, in which studios buy films and then spend large amounts of money marketing it (often comparable to the film cost). He noted that it took seven years for his film Clerks to become profitable due to this system (see Hollywood accounting). He also compared selling a film to giving a child away for someone else to raise it. Other telling quotes from his Sundance appearance referenced a sort of rebirth of the notion of independence in show business. > \\"We're starting over ... true independence isn't making a film and selling > it to some jackass. True independence is schlepping that shit to the people > yourself. And that's what I intend to do...\\" > \\"Yes, anybody can make a movie, we know that now ... What we aim to prove is > that anybody can release a movie as well, and it's not enough to just make > it and sell it anymore, I'm sorry. ... Indie film isn't dead people, it just > grew up. It's just indie film 2.0 now, and in indie film 2.0 we don't let > them sell our movie, we sell our movie ourselves.\\"Kevin Smith's Fake Auction > for \\"Red State\\" at Sundance Reveals His Indie Rage, fastcompany.com, Ari > Karpel, 2011 > \\"Root for us if you will, hate us if you must. ... But I can't think of a > more interesting business news story that you're ever gonna hear about this > fucking year, man. We're definitely gonna go out there and try to find a new > distribution model.\\" Smith planned to spend no money on traditional advertising (billboards, TV, print media), instead using the aforementioned in-person theatre tour with accompanying Q&A; show, word-of-mouth, Twitter, social media, podcasts, and other means not traditionally used by the studio system. In April 2011, Smith revealed that Red State had already made its budget back with the film making $1 million on the first leg of the tour, $1.5 million from a handful of foreign sales and $3 million from a domestic distribution deal for VOD. Tour and screenings The Westboro Baptist Church protested the film's release at the Sundance Film Festival because some of the elements of the film were \\"modeled after the founder and members of the Westboro Baptist Church.\\" The tour went well and the experience was described in detail in many of the SModco podcasts.for example, the Plus One podcasts, SModcast.com, see episodes from 2011. On one of the tour stops, two defectors from the Westboro Baptist Church appeared at the public Q&A; to ask Smith questions from the audience. He invited them on stage and proceeded to interview them.Plus One podcast 15, 2011 The film was released to cinemas in Australia on October 13, 2011.Luna Palace Cinemas. Retrieved October 2, 2011.Red State / Hoyts Retrieved: October 2, 2011 Animated version In 2015 filmmaker Dan Costales, who worked with Sound designer of Bobb Barito and animation work from Dennis Fries, made an animated short film based on Red State, which was released in March 2015 in the United States. Reception=Box office At the box office, Red State earned $1,104,682 in the United States. On its opening weekend, it grossed $204,230 in one theater, and it played at five theaters in its widest release. It grossed another $769,778 internationally for a total worldwide gross of $1,874,460. Critical response The film received mixed reviews from critics and has a score of 60% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 91 reviews with an average rating of 6.01/10. The website's critical consensus states \\"Red State is an audacious and brash affair that ultimately fails to provide competent scares or thrills.\\" The film also has a score of 50 out of 100 on Metacritic based on reviews from nine critics indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Edward Douglas of Shock Till You Drop panned the movie saying that, \\"it feels like one of Smith's Twitter rants fleshed out into film with equal portions of bile sprayed at both church and state.\\" Katey Rich of Cinema Blend reporting in her review, \\"Messy, overwritten, visually stylish, but kind of a bore. More like Kevin Smith than it looks because nobody ever stops talking. And it's not a horror movie by any usual definition. More like teen horror movie morphs into Waco disaster. Melissa Leo overacts, Michael Parks is impressive as Fred Phelps figure but the character's meaning and purpose in the narrative (or lack thereof) is fuzzy.\\" Jordan Hoffman in his review for UGO also panned the film, saying, \\"Kevin Smith, a wonderful public speaker and genuinely fun guy, has yet to master the basics of movie making.\\" According to Drew Mcweeny of \\"Motion Captured\\", \\"Kevin Smith's Red State fails onscreen and off at its world premiere ... A shoddy film and a bait-and-switch event fail to satisfy on any level.\\" Raffi Asdourian of The Film Stage wrote that, \\"While there are glimpses of Smith's wry humor scattered throughout, Red State can't help but feel like a B action movie that started off with ambitious ideas but collapses under it's own preachy weight ... it's clear that the smart alec writer still has some things to learn about making a great film.\\" Matt Goldberg of Collider.com wrote that, \\"Red State is a radical departure for Smith and yet he lacks the confidence to properly execute the action-horror-thriller he's devised.\\" James Rocchi writing for indieWire wrote that, \\"...Smith has gotten as far as he has with his comedies because it is a writer's genre more so than it is a director's. Horror is the genre of a director‚Äîpacing, feel, shots, editing‚Äîand Smith's skills are not up to the task ...\\" Amongst the positive reactions to the film, Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter called the movie, \\"A potent cinematic hand grenade tossed to bigots everywhere.\\" Jeff Sneider of TheWrap.com said, \\"The truth is that I didn't really know what to expect from Red State, but regardless, I still had high expectations and am pleased to report that the film lived up to them. ... it brings something new to the genre, and that something is faith.\\" Germain Lussier of /Film also praised the film, saying, \\"This is a maturing, confident Smith who proves, after Cop Out, he still has a unique voice. With Red State, that voice isn't saying anything incredibly groundbreaking, and at times it gets a tad preachy, but the director has expanded out of his comfort zone and given audiences a genuine piece of art.\\" Director Richard Kelly also offered his take on the film and Smith while appearing on Smith's SMovieMakers podcast. He said \\"I have never seen a filmmaker reinvent himself the way you just have. I won't say anything else because I don't want to spoil anything. It's really really exciting ...\\" Smith blogged on his official film website that filmmaker Quentin Tarantino saw the film and gave him positive feedback about it; he also named it as his 8th favorite film of 2011. Former collaborator Ben Affleck also loved the film and ended up casting Goodman, Parks and Bish√© in his film Argo. Accolades In October 2011, Red State won the Best Motion Picture award at the 2011 Sitges Film Festival, while Michael Parks was named Best Actor. Parks' character, Abin Cooper, received a nomination for Villain Of The Year from the Virgin Media Movie Awards.

Biography Born in Christchurch on 21 July 1947, Summers was educated at Linwood High School from 1961 to 1963. Summers began producing public sculptures after finishing a four-year farming apprenticeship in the early 1970, and gave his first exhibition in 1971. Since then he held many one-man shows as well as exhibiting alongside other artists including: Tony Fomison, Fatu Feu‚Äôu, Michael Smither, Tom Mutch, Peter Carson, Roger Hickin, Bing Dawe, and Graham Bennett. He believed it is the role of the artist to challenge: \\"if it's not challenging, then, in some way, it's not new.\\" His interest was primarily in figurative works, and was celebratory of the human form, affirming the beauty of the human body. However, following a formative and revelatory overseas trip his use of religious symbolism developed. It was first manifest through a series of icons and shrines comprising crosses, hearts and lights. Later, it led to a preoccupation with winged forms; most often, but not exclusively, attached to bodies. These angels were an obvious melding of the human and the divine; bringing an explicitly spiritual element to his work and highlighting the important role of morality, and the spiritual dimension of human existence. > What's important to me is to get a balance between the physical and the > spiritual in life. We're given a soul and we're given a body. Sculpture is a > nice balance because works can be made which are deep and meaningful, but > they require your physical body to produce them. Works must have soul, > rather than being merely clever or smart. Summers regularly participated in outdoor sculpture shows such as those held at the Waitakaruru Arboretum and Sculpture Park, the Auckland Botanic Gardens, NZ Sculpture Onshore, Tai Tapu Sculpture Gardens, the NewDowse Gallery, Governors Bay, and Sculpture in Central Otago (Wanaka), as his larger works are ideal for garden and other outdoor settings. His large sculptures can be seen in public spaces in New Zealand, from Kaitaia to Wanaka and many localities in between. His work is held in private collections both within New Zealand and internationally. His sculpture of 14 Stations of the Cross installed at the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament created a controversy due to the depiction of a naked figure of Jesus at his crucifixion. Summers died at his home in the Christchurch suburb of Mount Pleasant on 1 August 2019.

[4th] make sure that the right people are in the right jobs.\\" Supply & Demand Chain Executive also wrote of Natarajan's ideas on supply chain management that, \\"To bring competitive advantage to their enterprises, supply chain executives must also look to hire, train and retain creative problem-solvers, Natarajan adds. The goal is to drive \\"productivity of the mind\\" within the supply chain organization, emphasizing systematic thinking and developing problem-solving skills.\\" Natarajan pointed out in the article that increasing supply chain efficiency is a method of adding coinciding value in other parts of the company as well. In 2013 Natarajan partnered with Ron Hammond to research a series of best practices in the supply chain management industry. Based on that research they created a \\"supply chain maturity\\" model, used to identify a range of corporate behaviors, and places corporations into one of five categories: myopic, sluggish, aware, anticipative, and prescient. He is also a public speaker on the subject of supply chain and executive management. In September 2013 Natarajan was named Vice President of Business Process and Technology, Integrated Supply Chain Management at Disney. Natarajan's delivery systems, typified by the \\"CoolLift\\" technology, reduced the workplace injuries of work floors where they were employed by 97%, reduced the carbon footprint of the system by 50%, and reduced delivery costs by 2.5%. He has also been involved with on the ground delivery logistics, creating urban-specific delivery plans in traffic congested cities like S√£o Paulo, Brazil in order to deal with traffic jams. In Tanzania and Zambia, Natarajan also linked his delivery systems to the delivery of children's medication through the Cola Life program, which distributed medications to delivery locations of Coca-Cola for no additional charge. He later became the Vice President of Last Mile and Emerging Sciences at Walmart,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wal-mart- drones-idUSKCN0YO26M where he worked on projects including the implementation of drone technology into Walmart warehouse infrastructure and delivery systems. Natarajan and his team developed the autonomous drones in collaboration with the Federal Aviation Administration and NASA in an effort to significantly improve the efficiency of inventory checks and improve the safety of Walmart‚Äôs distribution centers. Shekar demonstrated the technology at a distribution center in Arkansas in 2016. In November 2016, he then became the senior vice president of network planning and operational design of Target Corporation.http://m.startribune.com/target-hires-another-supply-chain- executive-this-time-from-wal-mart/400323411/ Board positions Natarajan is a member of the editorial advisory board for Material Handling & Logistics, an industry member of the board for the College Industry Council of Material Handling equipment, on the board for the Material Handling Institute of America, was the co-chairman of the Institute of High Performance Planners, is on the board of Colalife, and an advisory board member of DC Velocity, a supply chain magazine. He is also a member of the Catastrophic Disaster Recovery Plan program headed by the White House. Awards and recognition Natarajan won the Medallion Award from the Institute of Industrial Engineering in 2010. In 2008 the Brazilian government recognized him for his keynote delivery at Movimat 2008. In 2009 Global Supply Chain Review named Natarajan to its list of \\"Top 25 Supply Chain Executives\\". In 2010 he was named one of the top visionaries of the year by Consumer Goods Technology and a 2009 as well as 2010 \\"Rainmaker\\" by DC Velocity. In 2010 he also received an Institute of Industrial Engineers Medallion for \\"outstanding contribution to the field of industrial engineering through leadership and innovation of methodology\\". In addition, he was \\"formally recognized him for the content and insights he provided for developing and managing supply chain processes\\" by the government of Brazil, in response to his keynote address at the 2008 Motimat conference. In 2011 Natarajan was then named a Next-generation Thought-leader by Supply & Demand Chain Executive and again called a thought leader in 2013 by Logistics Insight Asia. In 2013 Natarajan was named one of the \\"Non-Resident Indians of the Year\\" in the Professional Category by Times Now television. Supply Chain Quarterly named Natarajan a \\"Pragmatic Futurist\\" in 2018.

It is classified as one of several non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), to distinguish it from small cell lung cancer which has a different behavior and prognosis. Lung adenocarcinoma is further classified into several subtypes and variants. The signs and symptoms of this specific type of lung cancer are similar to other forms of lung cancer, and patients most commonly complain of persistent cough and shortness of breath. Adenocarcinoma is more common in patients with a history of cigarette smoking, and is the most common form of lung cancer in younger women and Asian populations. The pathophysiology of adenocarcinoma is complicated, but generally follows a histologic progression from cells found in healthy lungs to distinctly dysmorphic, or irregular cells. There are several distinct molecular and genetic pathways that contribute to this progression. Like many lung cancers, adenocarcinoma of the lung is often advanced by the time of diagnosis. Once a lesion or tumor is identified with various imaging modalities, such as computed tomography (CT) or X-ray, a biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment of this lung cancer is based upon the specific subtype and the extent of spread from the primary tumor. Surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy are used in attempt to eradicate the cancerous cells based upon these factors. Signs and symptoms The majority of patients who are diagnosed with lung cancer usually present with locally advanced or metastatic disease. Only about one third of patients have stage I disease when diagnosed. The symptoms that the patient exhibits usually reflect the extent of the cancer's spread. Lung cancers that are discovered early may cause symptoms localized to the respiratory system. However, lung cancer that is advanced will cause patients to experience additional signs and symptoms secondary to the cancer spreading to other organ systems. In order of highest frequency, the most common signs of lung cancer include: * cough that does not go away or gets worse * weight loss *dyspnea (shortness of breath or difficulty breathing) *chest pain, which may be aggravated by deep breathing, coughing, or laughing *hemoptysis (coughing up blood or rust-colored phlegm) * bone pain *clubbing *fever *generally feeling tired or weak *superior vena cava obstruction- facial, neck, upper torso swelling. This is caused by compression of vasculature by the lung tumor that restricts blood return from the upper body. *dysphagia (trouble swallowing or the sensation that something is caught in the throat) and hoarseness * new onset of wheezing without history of asthma Clinicians should have a high level of suspicion for lung cancer, especially in patients with a smoking history. Patients with recurring or unresolving lung infections (e.g. bronchitis and pneumonia) that are unresponsive to antibiotics should also be further evaluated for lung cancer. In nonsmokers, women and East Asians are more likely to present with symptoms of an underlying lung cancer at younger ages. Importantly, many of these signs are commonly due to other causes that are not cancer. A detailed medical history should be obtained from each patient to determine the relevance of further diagnostic workup and management.  Extrapulmonary manifestations  Adenocarcinoma, like other forms of lung cancer, is usually advanced or metastatic at time of diagnosis. Patients may complain of signs or symptoms outside of the respiratory tract that represent a hematologic or metabolic complication of the malignancy without, however, resulting necessarily from obstruction or metastasis. These go under the name of paraneoplastic syndromes, which often indicate advanced disease and worse prognosis. The most common paraneoplastic syndromes associated with adenocarcinoma of the lung are described below: *Hypercalcemia of malignancy is more common in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, but can occur in adenocarcinoma as well. Parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) is produced by tumor cells and functions similarly to parathyroid hormone (PTH). The production of this hormonally active peptide by cancer cells causes increased bone resorption via upregulation of osteoclasts, one of the cells responsible for bone remodeling. When bone is broken down, calcium is released into the bloodstream, resulting in hypercalcemia. The signs and symptoms of elevated calcium in the blood include: thirst, fatigue, constipation, polyuria (increased urination), and nausea. It is important to rule out boney metastases in patients with NSCLC because they also present with hypercalcemia. *Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPO) is fairly rare in adenocarcinoma. Less than 1% of patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung will exhibit this finding, but when it does occur, it is a poor prognostic factor. The exact mechanism of HPO is unknown but it thought to be hormonal or neurogenic in etiology. The triad of HPO includes distal clubbing, arthritis, and bilateral symmetrical periosteal formation.  Causes = Risk factors  According to the Nurses' Health Study, the risk of pulmonary adenocarcinoma increases substantially after a long duration of tobacco smoking: smokers with a previous smoking duration of 30‚Äì40 years are more than twice as likely to develop lung adenocarcinoma compared to never-smokers (relative risk of approximately 2.4); a duration of more than 40 years increases relative risk to 5. This cancer usually is seen peripherally in the lungs, as opposed to small cell lung cancer and squamous cell lung cancer, which both tend to be more centrally located, although it may also occur as central lesions. For unknown reasons, it often arises in relation to peripheral lung scars. The current theory is that the scar probably occurred secondary to the tumor, rather than causing the tumor. The adenocarcinoma has an increased incidence in smokers, and is the most common type of lung cancer seen in non-smokers and women. Deeper inhalation of cigarette smoke results in peripheral lesions that are often the case in adenocarcinomas of the lung. Generally, adenocarcinoma grows more slowly and forms smaller masses than the other subtypes. However, it tends to metastasize at an early stage.  Mechanism = Pathogenesis  Micrograph showing an ALK positive adenocarcinoma of the lung. ALK immunostain. Micrograph showing a ROS1 positive adenocarcinoma of the lung. ROS1 immunostain. Large scale studies such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have systematically characterized recurrent somatic alterations likely driving lung adenocarcinoma initiation and development. = Gene mutations and copy number alterations = Since smoking is a strong mutagenic factor, lung adenocarcinoma is one of the tumor types with the highest number of mutations. Common somatic mutations in lung adenocarcinoma affect many oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, including TP53 (mutated in 46% of cases), EGFR (27%), KRAS (32%), KEAP1, STK11 and NF1. EGFR and KRAS mutations tend to appear in a mutually exclusive fashion. KRAS mutations are associated with smoking habits, whereas EGFR mutations occur more frequently in females, people of Asian ethnicity and never-smokers. Copy number amplifications in oncogenes such as TERT, MDM2, EGFR, MET, and MYC have been reported, as well as deletions of tumor suppressor genes such as CDKN2A. Frequent alterations occur in genes belonging to the receptor tyrosine kinase pathway, of which EGFR is the most prominent example. This pathway is involved in cell proliferation and survival and it is often deregulated in cancer. As a consequence, targeted therapies have been developed to inhibit mutant pathway components. = Chromosomal rearrangements= Three membrane associated tyrosine kinase receptors are recurrently involved in fusions or rearrangements in adenocarcinomas: ALK, ROS1, and RET, and more than eighty other translocations have also been reported in adenocarcinomas of the lung.http://atlasgeneticsoncology.org/Tumors/TranslocLungAdenocarcID6751.html In ALK rearrangements, the most common partner gene is EML4. EML4-ALK fusions tend to occur in tumors that do not carry EGFR or KRAS mutations and have also a lower frequency of TP53 mutations. ALK and ROS fusions offer opportunities for targeted therapies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Pathophysiology  The respiratory tract can be divided into two main components: the conducting airways and the gas exchange airways. The gas exchange airways are made of alveoli, or small microscopic air sacs, that are responsible for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide during normal respiration. Alveoli are composed of two cell types, type I and type II pneumocytes. Type I pneumocytes cover 95% of alveolar surfaces, and are not able to regenerate. Type II pneumocytes are more common, making up 60% of the cells within alveolar epithelium, but constitute only 3% of the alveolar surface. There are several factors that contribute to the transformation of normal alveolar epithelium into dysplastic, or pre-cancerous, lesions. Adenocarcinoma of the lung develops in a step-wise progression as type II pneumocytes undergo consecutive molecular changes that disrupt normal cell regulation and turnover. Atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) is considered a pre-cancerous lesion, and is thought to further progress to adenocarcinoma in situ and invasive adenocarcinoma of the lung. The lesions of AAH are <5 mm, can be single or multiple, and have a ground glass appearance on CT imaging. As more genetic mutations and disregulation of normal cell signaling pathways accumulate, AAH can progress to adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS). AIS lesions are classified as small tumors <3 cm with abnormal type II pneumocyte cell growth that is limited to the alveolar spaces i.e. without invasion into the stroma, pleura, or vasculature. This type of growth is termed \\"lepidic\\" and is characteristic of adenocarcinoma of the lung in its earliest stages.  Diagnosis  A diagnosis of lung cancer may be suspected on the basis of typical symptoms, particularly in a person with smoking history. Symptoms such as coughing up blood and unintentional weight loss may prompt further investigation, such as medical imaging. Classification CT scan- adenocarcinoma of the left lung The majority of lung cancers can be characterized as either small cell lung cancer (SCLC) or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Lung adenocarcinoma is one of the three major subtypes of NSCLC, which also include squamous carcinoma and large cell carcinoma. Historically, there has been much debate in the most accurate method of describing adenocarcinoma of the lung and several revisions of classification systems have been published. Most recently, the International Multidisciplinary Classification of Lung Adenocarcinoma was published in 2011 and represents the consensus of several organizations to more accurately describe this specific type of lung cancer. The current classification system aims to more reliably predict prognosis and determination of therapeutic management. The tumor size, pattern of cell growth, and depth of cell invasion into normal lung tissue are considered in determining classification. The following names represent a step-wise pathologic progression in the natural course of adenocarcinoma development; Adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), Minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), and Invasive adenocarcinoma. Invasive adenocarcinoma of the lung includes a heterogenous mixture of subtypes and variants. The 2011 consensus describes five subtypes of invasive adenocarcinomas based on the cell pattern that is most predominant. These subtypes are described below: Histopathology of lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma. * lepidic predominant * acinar predominant * papillary predominant * micropapillary predominant * solid predominant with mucin production Cell patterns identifying subtypes are associated with prognosis, ranging from favorable (lepidic) to intermediate (acinar and papillary) to poor (micropapillary and solid). Four discrete variants of invasive adenocarcinomas not assignable to these five subtypes are also included in the current classification: * invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma * colloid adenocarcinoma * fetal adenocarcinoma * enteric adenocarcinoma  Imaging  A chest x-ray (radiograph) is often the first imaging test performed when a person presents with cough or chest pain, particularly in the primary care setting. A chest radiograph may detect a lung nodule/mass that is suggestive of cancer, although sensitivity and specificity are limited. CT imaging provides better evaluation of the lungs, with higher sensitivity and specificity for lung cancer compared to chest radiograph (although still significant false positive rate). Computed tomography (CT) that is specifically aimed at evaluating lung cancer includes the chest and the upper abdomen. This allows for evaluation of other relevant anatomic structures such as nearby lymph nodes, adrenal glands, liver, and bones which may show evidence of metastatic spread of disease. Indeed, the US Preventative Services Task Force recommends annual screening with low-dose CT in adults aged 55 to 80 years who have a 30 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years, with certain caveats (see Lung cancer screening). Nuclear medicine imaging, such as PET/CT and bone scan, may also be helpful to diagnose and detect metastatic disease elsewhere in the body. PET/CT uses a metabolically active tracer that allows clinicians to identify areas of the body that are hypermetabolic. Increased uptake of the tracer occurs in malignant cells and areas of inflammation or infection. Integrating the imaging reflective of metabolic activity with normal CT imaging allows for higher sensitivity and specificity compared to PET alone. MRI is reserved for patients with advanced disease where intracranial, or brain, involvement is likely. It is also helpful for evaluating the extent of chest wall, diaphragmatic, brachial plexus (such as in the case of superior sulcus tumors), or spine involvement.  Histopathology  If possible, a biopsy of any suspected lung tumor is performed in order to make a microscopic evaluation of the cells involved and is ultimately required to confirm diagnosis. Biopsy should be attempted in distant lesions first to establish a histologic diagnosis and to simultaneously confirm metastatic staging. The biopsy material is also used to analyze whether the tumor express any specific mutations suitable for tageted therapy (eg. EGFR mutation or ALK mutation). Biopsy can be accomplished via bronchoscopy, transthoracic needle biopsy, and video-assisted thorascopic surgery (VATS). While sputum cytology has been shown to have limited utility, thoracentesis, or aspiration of pleural fluid with an ultrasound-guided needle, should be performed when pleural effusion is present. When malignant cells are identified in the pleural aspirate of patients highly suspect for lung cancer, a definitive diagnosis and staging (stage IV adenocarcinoma of the lung) is established. Adenocarcinoma of the lung tends to stain mucin positive as it is derived from the mucus-producing glands of the lungs. Similar to other adenocarcinoma, if this tumor is well differentiated (low grade) it will resemble the normal glandular structure. Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma will not resemble the normal glands (high grade) and will be detected by seeing that they stain positive for mucin (which the glands produce). Adenocarcinoma can also be distinguished by staining for TTF-1, a cell marker for adenocarcinoma. As discussed previously, the category of adenocarcinoma includes are range of subtypes, and any one tumor tends to be heterogeneous in composition. Several major subtypes are currently recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) / American Thoracic Society (ATS) / European Respiratory Society (ERS): lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma, acinar predominant adenocarcinoma, papillary predominant adenocarcinoma, micropapillary predominant adenocarcinoma, solid predominant adenocarcinoma, and solid predominant with mucin production. In as many as 80% of these tumors, components of more than one subtype will be recognized. Surgically resected tumors should be classified by comprehensive histological subtyping, describing patterns of involvement in increments of 5%. The predominant histologic subtype is then used to classify the tumor overall. The predominant subtype is prognostic for survival after complete resection. To reveal the adenocarcinomatous lineage of the solid variant, demonstration of intracellular mucin production may be performed. Foci of squamous metaplasia and dysplasia may be present in the epithelium proximal to adenocarcinomas, but these are not the precursor lesions for this tumor. Rather, the precursor of peripheral adenocarcinomas has been termed atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH). Microscopically, AAH is a well-demarcated focus of epithelial proliferation, containing cuboidal to low-columnar cells resembling club cells or type II pneumocytes. These demonstrate various degrees of cytologic atypia, including hyperchromasia, pleomorphism, prominent nucleoli. However, the atypia is not to the extent as seen in frank adenocarcinomas. Lesions of AAH are monoclonal, and they share many of the molecular aberrations (like KRAS mutations) that are associated with adenocarcinomas. Signet ring and clear cell adenocarcinoma are no longer histological subtypes, but rather cytological features that can occur in tumour cells of multiple histological subtypes, most often solid adenocarcinoma. Treatment The treatment of adenocarcinoma of the lung depends on several factors including stage, resectability, performance status, histology and genomic alterations acquired by the individual tumor. As in most cancer types, treatment approaches can be broadly divided into 5 categories: surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy.  Surgery  Early stage (I, II and IIIA) lung adenocarcinomas are typically treated surgically to remove the tumor with pneumonectomy or lobectomy, if it is found to be resectable with imaging studies and biopsies and if the patient is considered able to tolerate surgery. Video-assisted thorascopic surgery (VATS) is often adopted, which consists in the insertion of a thorascope inside a small incision made in the chest; a lobe can be removed via the scope through this small incision. thumb160pxIncidence of adenocarcinoma of the lung (in yellow) as compared to other lung cancer types, with fractions of non-smokers versus smokers shown for each type.Smokers defined as current or former smoker of more than 1 year of duration. See image page in Commons for percentages in numbers. Reference: *[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3044470/table/T2/ Table 2] in:  Chemotherapy  For advanced (stage IV) and unresectable lung tumors, the first-line therapy is platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, combining cisplatin or carboplatin with another cytotoxic agent. Regimens strongly depend on each patient performance status and response, and when the risk of adverse events could worsen quality of life significantly, basic supportive care is more recommended. Chemotherapy is also used as an adjuvant therapy following surgery to kill remaining cancer cells in patients with stage IIA, IIB and IIIA NSCLC.  Radiotherapy  Adenocarcinoma is a non-small cell lung carcinoma, and it is not as responsive to radiation therapy compared to small cell lung carcinoma. However, radiotherapy may be used as an adjuvant therapy for patients who have undergone a resection surgery to reduce the risk of lung cancer relapse. It may also benefit inoperable tumors that are localized to the chest and be part of palliative care to improve quality of life in patients not responding to surgery or chemotherapy.  Targeted therapy  Targeted therapy is available for lung adenocarcinomas with certain molecular characteristics. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been developed to target mutant components of the receptor tyrosine kinase pathway such as EGFR, ALK and ROS1, which show frequent alterations in lung adenocarcinomas. First- generation EGFR TKIs, including gefitinib and erlotinib, have been shown to be more effective in treating EGFR-mutated patients with respect to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Second-generation inhibitors such as afatinib and dacomitinib provided a broader scope of application as they are able to target not only the protein EGFR itself but also other members of the EGFR family, such as HER2 and HER4 (also known as ERBB2 and ERBB4), and they have shown improved progression-free survival compared to gefitinib. As the most common cause of acquired resistance to first-generation TKIs is a second EGFR mutation on codon 790, a third-generation EGFR TKI, osimertinib, has been developed to target this new mutation as well. MET amplification is another known mechanism of acquired resistance. ALK inhibitors such as crizotinib showed to be effective against tumors harboring ALK fusions. Most patients previously treated with crizotinib benefited from second-generation ALK inhibitors including ceritinib, alectinib and brigatinib. Resistance to ALK inhibitors can occur with novel acquired ALK mutations or amplifications. Also ROS1-positive tumors have shown high sensitivity to ALK inhibitors due to the high homology between the kinase domains of ROS1 and ALK.  Immunotherapy  Immune response can be prevented via activation of immune checkpoints, which consist in the binding of a ligand protein (e.g. PD-L1) to a receptor (e.g. PD-1) on the immune cell surface. As a consequence, cancer cells expressing PD-L1 can inactivate T cells thus fostering tumor growth. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been developed to restore T cell-mediated antitumor immunity by blocking either the ligand or the receptor. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been approved for NSCLC, including anti-PD-1 nivolumab and pembrolizumab. Anti-PD-1 agents are used for patients with advanced NSCLC whose tumors progress after first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy. Pembrolizumab was established as a new standard of care for patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC with high PD-L1 expression levels, and responses are even more pronounced for tumor with a high mutational burden (i.e. having an elevated number of mutations). Therapeutic approaches combining multiple immune checkpoint inhibitors or one immune checkpoint inhibitors and a cytotoxic agent are undergoing clinical trials as of 2018. The potential role of anti-PD-1 agents as neoadjuvant therapy in resectable NSCLCs is also being investigated. Epidemiology As for other lung cancer subtypes, lung adenocarcinoma incidence is strongly associated with smoking. Incidence of pulmonary adenocarcinoma has been increasing in many developed Western nations in the past few decades, with a share reaching 43.3% of all lung cancers in the US as of 2012, thus replacing squamous cell lung carcinoma as the most common type of lung cancer. This can be largely attributed to the decreasing smoking rates, which favors the adenocarcinoma histology. Indeed, although smoking is still its strongest risk factor, lung adenocarcinoma is by far the most common among lifelong non-smokers (<100 cigarettes in a lifetime).

It is known from a single fragmentary postcranial skeleton (PIN 3386/2), discovered in the Aptian-age Lower Cretaceous H√ºhteeg Formation at H√ºren Dukh, central Mongolia. The type species is I. egloni, which was originally described as a new species of the related choristodere Tchoiria in 1983 by Efimov. Efimov transferred the species to the new genus Irenosaurus in 1988. Evans and Hecht (1993) questioned the separation of the taxon from Tchoiria namsarai from the same locality on the grounds that the differences between the two may not have been greater than those of various species of the choristodere Champsosaurus.

Built to support a military campaign, it saw several years of active fighting. Today, the fort site is a historic site. Establishment Located in present-day Darke County in far western Ohio, the fort was built under the direction of General Arthur St. Clair in October 1791 as an advance post for his campaign from Fort Washington against local Native Americans.Wilson, Frazer. History of Darke County Ohio: From Its Earliest Settlement to the Present Time. Vol. 1. Milford: Hobart, 1914. A square of approximately on each side, the fort was built of wood and intended primarily as a supply depot; accordingly, it was originally named \\"Fort Deposit.\\"Fort Jefferson, Ohio Historical Society, 2010. Accessed 2010-04-10. Before St. Clair's army departed the fort, a court-martial was conducted for an unknown crime; the three soldiers who were convicted and hanged became the first whites to be executed in present-day Darke County. Siege of Fort Jefferson One month later, after St. Clair's army was badly defeated in battle near modern-day Fort Recovery to the north, the scattered remnants of his force reconstituted at Fort Jefferson. Because it was not intended to house many soldiers, and because few supplies were actually stored at the fort, St. Clair found the fort insufficiently large for his men; consequently, he took most of his surviving soldiers and returned to Fort Washington, leaving only a small garrison to guard his many wounded. It is believed that the garrison was under the command of Captain Joseph Shaylor. The defeat of the American army left Fort Jefferson deep in enemy territory. Determined to drive the American soldiers back to the Ohio River, a Native American force (possibly under the command of Simon Girty) raided the fort in the early summer of 1792. This raid began with an attack of one hundred warriors against a party gathering hay for the fort's supplies on June 25; sixteen soldiers were killed or left missing by the fight. It is possible that another raid was conducted a short while later with the intention of capturing or killing Captain Shaylor; if a story told by locals is accurate, Shaylor's love of hunting was exploited by some of the besiegers, who lured Shaylor and his son into the woods by imitating the call of the wild turkey. While Shaylor escaped the ensuing pursuit, his son was killed. The siege continued intermittently for three years, as continued Native American attacks were made to neutralize the fort. Wayne's campaign As the United States Army prepared to return to the offensive in the western Ohio country, Fort Jefferson became more than an isolated location outside of the control of the hostile Miamis: projections were created of using the fort as a base for the protection of local settlers and for raids on nearby Native Americans. When Anthony Wayne and his Legion of the United States, fresh from Legionville, began their expedition to avenge St. Clair in the fall of 1793, they erected a new supply fort at the site of Greenville, north of Fort Jefferson. Nevertheless, they relied heavily on the supplies of Fort Jefferson in their campaign during the following year. After the war After the end of the war, white settlers began to take up residence in the vicinity of the abandoned fort. A blockhouse was built by one nearby resident in 1810; by 1820, more settlers had built houses, a mill, and a school near the fort site. The new community was named \\"Fort Jefferson.\\" In the fall of 1907, the Greenville Historical Society dedicated a memorial on the site of the fort. Fort Jefferson was further recognized in 1970 when it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The area designated as historic encompasses approximately .

The centre collected and promulgated information about war crimes, specific mainly to crimes against the Jewish people as perpetrated by the Nazi Regime in Europe during the Second World War. The centre has been responsible for uncovering more than 1000 Nazi war criminals, including Adolf Eichmann, sometimes referred to as \\"the architect of the Holocaust\\". The office was also interested in the whereabouts of alleged Nazi war criminals who may have escaped justice, including those individuals who escaped through the Nazi ratlines to havens in South America, particularly to Argentina, Paraguay, Brazil, and Chile. This Centre closed in 1954. History Simon Wiesenthal was a Holocaust survivor who was noted for his work as a Nazi hunter who pursued Nazi war criminals. After being liberated from the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp by the U.S. Army, Wiesenthal began gathering and preparing evidence on Nazi atrocities for the War Crimes Section of the United States Army. When his association with the United States Army ended in 1947, Wiesenthal and thirty volunteers opened the Jewish Historical Documentation Centre in Linz, Austria, for the purpose of assembling evidence for future trials. However, as the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union intensified, both sides lost interest in prosecuting Germans, and Wiesenthal's volunteers, succumbing to frustration, drifted away to more ordinary pursuits. In 1954, the office in Linz was closed, and its files were given to the Yad Vashem Archives in Israel, except for the dossier on Adolf Eichmann. Successor In 1959, acting on information provided by Wiesenthal and other Nazi hunters, Eichmann was captured by Mossad agents in Argentina, transported to Israel where he was tried and executed. Encouraged, in 1961, Simon Wiesenthal founded the Documentation Centre of the Association of Jewish Victims of the Nazi Regime (Dokumentationszentrum des Bundes J√ºdischer Verfolgter des Naziregimes) in Vienna, which concentrated exclusively on the hunting of war criminals. The centre in Vienna was housed in a nondescript, sparsely furnished three-room office in Vienna's old Jewish quarter with a staff of four, including Wiesenthal The centre had open files on about 2,000 cases, however, Wiesenthal estimated that about 150,000 Nazis were involved in war crimes and that his office's extensive archives were just \\"the tip of the iceberg\\". According to the centre, about 40,000 Nazis have been tried for war crimes since the end of the war, and most were found guilty. The centre developed a department to track anti-Semitism and right-wing extremism. Since 2003, the association has been indexing its holdings with the aid of an electronic database to increase its availability for users. The Centre is an integral, but independent part of the Vienna Wiesenthal Institute for Holocaust Studies (VWI).

He served in the air services of the United States Army during World War I and World War II, and was credited as a flying ace during the former, with twelve aerial victories. Early life and World War I In 1916 Landis enlisted in the 1st Illinois Cavalry of the National Guard and served as a private along the Mexican border. In 1917 he joined the Aviation Section, U. S. Signal Corps. He finished his training in England and was posted to No. 40 Squadron RAF. Flying the Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a he drove down a Pfalz D.III out of control on 8 May 1918 for his first victory. On 19 May, he destroyed another D.III. Between 14 July and 19 August, he claimed another ten victories. His final tally was an observation balloon and eight enemy airplanes destroyed, and three enemy planes driven 'down out of control'. During the war he flew missions with George McElroy and Stan Dallas. In late August 1918, Landis was transferred to command the 25th Aero Squadron, which never succeeded in getting into combat, only receiving its Austin-built S.E.5as in early November 1918.

During a general engagement west of Douai and south of Vitry on August 8, 1918, Captain Landis attacked and destroyed two enemy planes and one balloon in the course of a single flight. During a general engagement west of Brieve on August 12, 1918, he singled out an enemy plane and shot it down. While on patrol over Lens on August 13, 1918, he engaged four enemy triplanes and one biplane in decisive combat, and, despite the numerical superiority of the enemy, he destroyed two of their planes and forced the others to withdraw. On August 19, 1918, while leading a patrol of five planes he encountered and unhesitatingly attacked eight enemy Fokker scouts, one of which he shot down. During the combat several other enemy planes joined the action from above and observing one of these attacking a member of his patrol, he climbed up under it, and firing at point-blank range shot it down. General Orders No. 8, W.D., 1934 Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. He has carried out offensive patrols with marked determination and dash, and he has on all occasions engaged the enemy with marked skill and an entire disregard of personal danger. On 8 August 1918, he attacked an enemy kite balloon over Vitry-en-Artois. One observer jumped clear with a parachute and the balloon burst into flames and went down. Personally he has accounted for enemy aircraft as follows: On 8 August, during a general engagement west of Douai, he engaged a Fokker biplane and fired a short burst from point blank range. EA went down vertically after emitting a huge cloud of smoke and though the enemy machine was not seen to burst into flames, it was evidently on fire. He then attacked a balloon over Vitry but seeing a DFW below it, he attacked the EA instead. He fired a long burst from above; the enemy machine dived, started to spin and crashed on the southern edge of Vitry-en-Artois village. On 7 August, while on offensive patrol in the vicinity of Carvin, four enemy scouts were engaged. He selected one and fired about 300 rounds closing at short range. EA spiraled steeply, side-slipped at intervals and was seen to crash in the vicinity of Carvin. On 14 July, when on offensive patrol, he fired about 150 rounds into a Pfalz scout from 75 yards range. Enemy machine was observed to crash near Epinoy. In addition to the above, this officer has destroyed one EA and driven on down out of control.

It is known from Lower Cretaceous rocks of Mongolia and Russia. Two species have been named. The type species, K. orlovi, was named in 1984 by Sigogneau‚ÄìRussell and Efimov for the fragmentary postcranial skeleton PIN 3386/3. This specimen was discovered in the Aptian-age Lower Cretaceous H√ºhteeg Svita Formation at H√ºren Dukh, central Mongolia. The lake deposits at this site also contain fossils of the choristoderes Irenosaurus and Tchoiria. Other postcranial bones of K. orlovi have been found at this site as well. Second species K. bajkalensis was named by Efimov in 1996 for PIN 2234/201, consisting of a scapulocoracoid and a rib. These bones were found in the Lower Cretaceous Murtoi Formation at Lake Gusinoye, Buryatia, Russia. The first Russian choristodere, Efimov and Storrs (2000) found it difficult to distinguish from K. orlovi based on the small amount of material. Skutschas (2008) reported on additional material which supported the placement of the Russian taxon within Khurendukhosaurus, but found the species K. bajkalensis to be dubious within the genus.

Eliza Hickox in New Haven; they had a daughter, Clara A. 19th century Puerto Rican diaspora During the 19th century, commerce existed between the ports of the eastern coast of the United States and Puerto Rico. Ship records show that many Puerto Ricans traveled on ships that sailed from and to U.S. and Puerto Rico. Many of them settled in places such as New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts. Upon the outbreak of the American Civil War, many Puerto Ricans joined the ranks of the military armed forces. However, since Puerto Ricans were still Spanish subjects, they were inscribed as Spaniards. 15th Connecticut Regiment On July 23, 1862, Rodr√≠guez volunteered and joined the 15th Connecticut Volunteer Infantry. For unknown reasons his name was misspelled and listed as \\"Augustus Rodereques\\".\\"Record of Service of Connecticut Men, Army and Navy, in the War of the Rebellion\\"; Compiled by Adjutants-General, Hartford, CT: Press of the Case, Lockwood & Brainard Company, 1889.

Sheldon B. Thorpe. Price, Lee and Adkins. New Haven. 1893. pg. 318. The 15th Connecticut was organized on August 25, 1862 in New Haven, and was also known as the \\"Lyon Regiment\\" in honor of Nathaniel Lyon, the first general officer killed in the U.S. Civil War.CVI The Regiment left Connecticut for Washington, D.C. on August 28, and was attached to Casey's Provisional Brigade, Military District of Washington, serving in the defenses of Washington until September 17, 1862.Union Regimental Histories Battles of Fredericksburg and Wyse Fork Pension claim made by Rodriguez In December 1 through 6, the 15th Connecticut Infantry marched to Fredericksburg, Virginia and was assigned to the 2nd Brigade, 3rd Division, IX Corps, Army of the Potomac commanded by Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside. Lieutenant Rodr√≠guez led his men in the Battle of Fredericksburg which was fought against General Robert E. Lee's Confederate Army of Northern Virginia from December 12‚Äì15. The battle resulted in a disastrous defeat for General Burnside and the Union Army.Catton, Bruce, Terrible Swift Sword: The Centennial History of the Civil War, Volume 2, Doubleday, 1963, . Burnside attempted to make an offensive movement on January 20, 1863, in which Lt. Rodr√≠guez and the men of the 15th Connecticut Regiment were involved. However the offensive, which became known as the Mud March, was aborted because of constant rain. In March 1865, Rodr√≠guez and the 15th Connecticut were assigned to the 2nd Brigade, 2nd Division, District of Beaufort, North Carolina, Department of North Carolina. From March 8‚Äì10, Rodr√≠guez once more led his men in combat in the Battle of Wyse Fork, a confrontation against a Confederate army being gathered under Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston and Union troops under the command of Maj. Gen. John M. Schofield. On the first day of the battle, Lieutenant Rodriguez, along with most of the 15th Connecticut, was surrounded and compelled to surrender. Rodriguez and his comrades were paroled on March 26.Thorpe. pg. 318. The final outcome of the battle resulted in a Union victory.Korn, Jerry, and the Editors of Time-Life Books, Pursuit to Appomattox: The Last Battles, Time-Life Books, 1987, . In the closing months of the war, the 15th Connecticut Infantry was assigned to provost duty as part of the garrison upon the occupation of Kinston, North Carolina by Union forces. The regiment remained at Kinston until June 6, when it was ordered to New Bern, North Carolina, to prepare for muster-out.N-SSA Unit Histories Later years The regiment was mustered out on June 27, 1865 and Rodr√≠guez was discharged in New Haven on July 12, 1865. After the war Rodr√≠guez became the proprietor of a cigar store, a bartender and saloon keeper. He was also a firefighter in New Haven. On July 3, 1873, Rodr√≠guez applied for a disability service connected pension. According to Rodr√≠guez, he claimed to have developed Rheumatoid arthritis during his service in the U.S. Army. He was awarded a pension of $2.00 (two dollars) a month.Approved Pension File for Sergeant Augustus Rodriquez, Company I, 15th Connecticut Infantry Regiment (SC-125255) He died in his home in New Haven on March 22, 1880, and was buried under the name of \\"Gustave Rodrique\\" in grave #2 in the Firefighters Pantheon at the Evergreen Cemetery in New Haven.\\"The history of the Fifteenth Connecticut volunteers in the war for the defense of the Union, 1861-1865\\"; By Sheldon B.

He inherited the lordship of Dun and became viscount of Bourges between 1092 and 1095 after marrying Matilda of Sully, whose sister Alice was the daughter-in-law of Stephen, Count of Blois. He may have shared the viscountcy with Matilda's father Gilo. At some point between 1097 and 1101, Odo sold his possessions in Bourges and Dun to King Philip I of France for sixty thousand shillings. This may or may not have been done to finance his crusade. He participated in the Crusade of 1101, probably with Stephen of Blois, and travelled through Constantinople, where he swore a loyalty oath to Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos. Odo was in Jaffa in 1101, Jerusalem in 1102, and fought in the Second Battle of Ramla, where he was captured. He was not executed because of his connection to Emperor Alexius, but was instead imprisoned in Ascalon and later Cairo. Alexius arranged for him to be released. On his way home, Odo visited Pope Paschal II in Rome, and at the Pope's suggestion he became a monk at Cluny, which may have been necessary because had sold all his property before the crusade. He became prior of La Charit√©-sur-Loire around 1107, and added the revenues of numerous other properties to the monastery, including one in Anatolia donated by Emperor Alexius. Odo's capture was incorporated into the Crusade cycle of epic poetry, in the section known as Les Ch√©tifs (\\"the captives\\").

It is a tailed virus with a contractile sheath and is thus classified in the genus Peduovirus (formerly P2likevirus), subfamily Peduovirinae, family Myoviridae within order Caudovirales. This genus of viruses includes many P2-like phages as well as the satellite phage P4. Discovery Bacteriophage P2 was first isolated by G. Bertani from the Lisbonne and Carr√®re strain of E. coli in 1951.Bertani, G., STUDIES ON LYSOGENESIS I.: The Mode of Phage Liberation by Lysogenic Escherichia coli1. Journal of Bacteriology, 1951. 62(3): p. 293. Since that time, a large number of P2-like prophages (e.g. 186, HP1, HK239, and WŒ¶) have been isolated that shared characters such as host range, serological relatedness and inability to recombine with phage Œª, and they seemed to be quite common in E. coli populations as about 30% of the strains in the E. coli reference collection (SABC) contain P2-like prophages .Nilsson, A.S., J.L. Karlsson, and E. Hagg√•rd-Ljungquist, Site-specific recombination links the evolution of P2-like coliphages and pathogenic enterobacteria. Molecular Biology and Evolution, 2004. 21(1): p. 1-13. Of these P2-like prophages is P2 best characterized. The P2 phage was found to be able to multiply in many strains of E. coli, as well as in strains of many other species including Serratia, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Yersinia sp,Hagg√•rd-Ljungquist, E., C. Halling, and R. Calendar, DNA sequences of the tail fiber genes of bacteriophage P2: evidence for horizontal transfer of tail fiber genes among unrelated bacteriophages. Journal of Bacteriology, 1992. 174(5): p. 1462-1477. which suggested that it played an important role in horizontal gene transfer in bacterial evolution. Genome and morphology Phage P2 has a double stranded DNA genome packaged in an icosahedral capsid with a diameter of 60 nanometers that is connected to a 135 nanometer long tail. Presence of phage P4 can cause P2 to form smaller capsids. The tail ends in a baseplate which is the control hub for phage infectivity. The baseplate includes 6 tail fibers which initially bind to receptors on the bacterial cell wall and a tail spike protein that subsequently binds irreversibly to other receptors on the cell wall. The genome of bacteriophage P2 is 33,592 bp of double-stranded, linear DNA with cohesive ends (accession number AF063097). The 42 genes in the genome can be divided in three main categories: (i) genes required for lytic growth, (ii) genes involved in establishing and maintaining lysogeny (such as int and C), and (iii) the nonessential genes (including old, tin, and Z/fun). Furthermore, a number of open reading frames (ORFs) is found in P2 genome, which may encode functional proteins. Life cycle Bacteriophage P2 is a temperate phage, which means that it can propagate lytically (i.e. directing the host cell to produce phage progenies and finally lysing the host when the phage progenies exit), as well as establish lysogeny (i.e. injecting and fusing its genetic material into the genome of the host without lysing the cell) and maintain as a prophage in host genome.  Infection  Adsorption of the virion to the host cell is the key step in phage infection, which is essential for the following phage binding and injection of phage DNA . During the adsorption process, the tail fiber of phage P2 recognizes and binds to the core region of the lipopolysaccharide of E. coli, and then the phage would inject its DNA into the cytoplasm.Hagg√•rd-Ljungquist, E., C. Halling, and R. Calendar, DNA sequences of the tail fiber genes of bacteriophage P2: evidence for horizontal transfer of tail fiber genes among unrelated bacteriophages. Journal of Bacteriology, 1992. 174(5): p. 1462-1477.  Lytic cycle  Early transcription = The gene expression of P2 is regulated over time during the lytic cycle. Early transcription, which is responsible for the expression of the genes required for the following DNA replication, is initiated immediately after infection. The early operon contains 9 genes and transcribes from the lytic promotor Pe. The first gene in the operon, designated cox, encodes the repressor of the lysogenic promoter Pc and prevent the expression of the genes required for establishing lysogeny.Saha, S., E. Hagg√•rd-Ljungquist, and K. Nordstr√∂m, The cox protein of bacteriophage P2 inhibits the formation of the repressor protein and autoregulates the early operon.

Oxford Press, Oxford, 2005: p. 365-390 Then the phage enters the lytic lifecycle and early transcription starts. Only host œÉ70 RNA polymerase is required in the early transcription process. = DNA replication = Besides cox, the early operon contains two other genes which are essential for P2 DNA replication, genes A and B.Lindahl, G., Genetic map of bacteriophage P2. Virology, 1969. 39(4): p. 839-860Lindqvist, B.H., Vegetative DNA of temperate coliphage P2. Molecular and General Genetics, 1971. 110(2): p. 178-196. Replication of P2 genome is initiated by A protein and takes place from a fixed origin (ori) via a modified rolling-circle mechanism that generates double-stranded monomeric circles.Liu, Y. and E. Hagg√•rd-Ljungquist, Studies of bacteriophage P2 DNA replication: localization of the cleavage site of the A protein. Nucleic Acids Research, 1994. 22(24): p. 5204-5210.Odegrip, R. and E.

Journal of Molecular Biology, 2001. 308(2): p. 147-163. The B protein may be required for lagging-strand synthesis, as it can interact with E. coli DnaB and function as a helicase loader.Odegrip, R., et al., The interaction of bacteriophage P2 B protein with Escherichia coli DnaB helicase. Journal of Virology, 2000. 74(9): p. 4057-4063. = Activation of late transcription = Late gene transcription is initiated from four late promoters once DNA replication has started and the transcriptional activator Ogr has been expressed.Wood, L.F., N.Y. Tszine, and G.E. Christie, Activation of P2 late transcription by P2 ogr protein requires a discrete contact site on the C terminus of the Œ± subunit of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase.

The late promoters, PP, PO, PV and PF, are activated by Ogr and direct the transcription of the genes responsible for lytic functions as well as encoding building blocks for phage progenies.Birkeland, N.K. and B.H. Lindqvist, Coliphage P2 late control gene ogr: DNA sequence and product identification.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 1986. 83(10): p. 3238-3242. All the four promoters have a region with a partial dyad symmetry centered around 55 bp downstream from the transcriptional initiation site. Revealed by deletion analysis and base substitutions, this dyad symmetry has been shown to be essential for promoter activity.Grambow, N.J., et al., Deletion analysis of a bacteriophage P2 late promoter. Gene, 1990. 95(1): p. 9-15.Van Bokkelen, G., et al., Mutational analysis of a bacteriophage P4 late promoter. Journal of Bacteriology, 1991. 173(1): p. 37-45. Moreover, the late genes of P2 can also be activated by the Œ¥ proteins of satellite phages P4 and Œ¶R73 directly.Clerch, B., E. Rivera, and M. Llagostera, Bacteriophage PSP3 and phi R73 activator proteins: analysis of promoter specificities. Journal of Bacteriology, 1996. 178(19): p. 5568-5572. = Lysis = During the lytic cycle, similar to other double-stranded phages, bacteriophage P2 applies a holin-endolysin system to lyse the host cell. P2 have two essential lysis genes (gene K and gene Y) and two ancillary lysis genes (lysA and lysB).Ziermann, R., et al., Functions involved in bacteriophage P2-induced host cell lysis and identification of a new tail gene. Journal of Bacteriology, 1994. 176(16): p. 4974-4984. The product of K gene has extensive amino acid sequence similarity to that of gene R in Œª phage, which exhibits endolysin function and attack the glycosidic bond. Gene Y encodes a polypeptide sharing high similarity to the holin protein family, which forms ‚Äòholes‚Äô in the cell membrane and provide a pathway for endolysin escape to the cell wall. The nonessential genes, lysA and lysB, seem to play a role in controlling the correct timing of lysis.Zimecki, M., et al., Bacteriophages provide regulatory signals in mitogen-induced murine splenocyte proliferation. Cell Mol Biol Lett, 2003. 8(3): p. 699-711.  Lysogenic cycle  Prophage integration = During lysogenic cycle, P2 genome is inserted into the host chromosome and maintained as a prophage. The integration involves site-specific recombination between a bacterial attachment site (attB) and a phage attachment site (attP), which generates host-phage junctions, attL and attR. This reaction is controlled by a phage- encoded integrase, and leads to no gain or loss of nucleotides. Another integration host factor, IHF, is also essential in the integration process and serves as an architectural protein that binds and bends DNA.Yu, A. and E. Hagg√•rd-Ljungquist, Characterization of the binding sites of two proteins involved in the bacteriophage P2 site-specific recombination system. Journal of Bacteriology, 1993. 175(5): p. 1239-1249. Thus, the integration mechanism of phage P2 is similar to the well-studied Œª site-specific recombination system, but the phage proteins and their DNA binding sites differ.Landy, A., Dynamic, structural, and regulatory aspects of lambda site-specific recombination. Annual Review of Biochemistry, 1989. 58(1): p. 913-941. = Maintenance of lysogeny = The lysogenic state of P2 is promoted and maintained by the C repressor. It is a 99-amino acids polypeptide and binds to only one operator region which regulates the expression of the early genes: cox, B and possibly A. Research has shown that C repressor can both positively and negatively regulate its own Pc promoter as Pc is up regulated at low C level and down regulated at high levels.Saha, S., B. Lundqvist, and E. Hagg√•rd-Ljungquist, Autoregulation of bacteriophage P2 repressor. The EMBO Journal, 1987. 6(3): p. 809. Since the C repressor is not inactivated by the SOS/RecA system of E. coli, the P2 prophage is non-inducible by ultraviolet irradiation. Furthermore, even if C repressor is inactivated, the P2 prophage is unable to excise, due to lack of int expression.Bertani, L.E., Abortive induction of bacteriophage P2. Virology, 1968. 36(1): p. 87-103. Hence, P2 has been regarded as the prototype for the non-inducible class of temperate phages. The mechanism about how P2 solve the induction-excision paradox still remains unknown.  Control of lytic versus lysogenic growth  As stated before, upon infection, phage P2 can enter into either lytic or lysogenic cycle. The lytic/lysogenic decision upon infection depends on which promoter takes command, the lysogenic promoter Pc or the promoter Pe that controlled genes responsible for lytic cycle. Pc and Pe are located face-to-face, and they are mutually exclusive. The Pe promotor directs transcription of the Cox protein that represses the Pc promoter and thereby prevents lysogenization, and the Pc promoter directs the C repressor transcription which down regulates Pe.Yu, A. and E. Hagg√•rd-Ljungquist, The Cox protein is a modulator of directionality in bacteriophage P2 site-specific recombination. Journal of Bacteriology, 1993. 175(24): p. 7848-7855. Thus, which promotor takes command is thought to be a consequence of the relative concentrations of the Cox protein and the C repressor. If the balance between the C repressor and Cox proteins is shifted towards C repressor after infection, then the phage will enter the lysogenic lifecycle as the Pe promoter will be turned off and vice versa.  Evolution of bacteriophage P2 and other P2-like phages  Plenty of researches have shown that phage genomes are composed of both genes similar to host genes or other phage genes, and novel genes which show little similarity to any known genes.Botstein, D., A THEORY OF MODULAR EVOLUTION FOR BACTERIOPHAGES*. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1980. 354(1): p. 484-491.Hendrix, R.W., et al., Evolutionary relationships among diverse bacteriophages and prophages: all the world‚Äôsa phage. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 1999. 96(5): p. 2192-2197. P2-like phage family are no exception. Their genomes share a lot of similarity but each of them contain unique genes, including some ones which functions remain unknown. Based on the criterion suggested by Ackermann, many phages can be taxonomically classified as P2-like as they share some characters with phage P2,Ackermann, H.-W., Tailed bacteriophages: the order Caudovirales. Advances in Virus Research, 1999. 51: p. P135-P202. but up to now, only 6 complete genomes are available (P2, 186, Œ¶CTX, HP1, HP2 and K139).  Phylogenetic relationship of 6 sequenced P2-like phages  Revealed by whole genome comparison, only nine late genes (corresponding to genes H, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, T in phage P2) and an integrase gene were found to be both genetically similar and present in all the 6 full sequenced genomes. Phylogenetic trees based on the amino acid sequences of the 9 late gene products are constructed separately, and they all show identical topology, which suggests that they may have the same evolutionary history. Furthermore, these 9 late genes are likely to be inherited clonally as there is no indication of major recombination events between them for any pair of phages. However, for remaining genes besides these nine, their phylogenetic relationship is often ambiguous and hard to resolve their evolutionary history.  Homologous and non-homologous recombination  Homologous recombination plays a more important role in nucleotide changes of phage P2 than mutation, which is not surprising as P2-like prophages are prevalent in E. coli population and genetic exchange is found to occur between host genomes.Feil, E.J., et al., Recombination within natural populations of pathogenic bacteria: short-term empirical estimates and long-term phylogenetic consequences. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2001. 98(1): p. 182-187. Sequencing of five late genes from 18 isolates of P2-like phages demonstrated that homologous recombination is extensive and occurs randomly at multiple breakpoints. The genetic variations in the late genes of the 18 close relatives are small, as the greatest difference in any gene was only 3.7%. For there was much more variation in synonymous rather than nonsynonymous third-codon positions, these late genes are likely to be subject to rather strong stabilizing selection.Nilsson, A.S. and E. Hagg√•rd-Ljungquist, Detection of homologous recombination among bacteriophage P2 relatives. Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, 2001. 21(2): p. 259-269. Besides homologous recombination between related phages, non-homologous recombination is also a key mechanism for phage evolution. The high level of similarities in the tail fiber genes of phage P2, P1, Mu, Œª, K3 and T2, which belong to different families, indicates a previously unappreciated level of non-homologous recombination between unrelated phages. As host range of phage is largely determined by tail fiber, this finding suggests that under selective pressures, phages are likely to change their host range by making use of the gene pool available to them.  Contribution to the evolution of its host  Capable of switching between lytic and lysogenic lifecycle is greatly beneficial for the survival of phage. In a large dense population of isogenic hosts, the lytic strategy is preferred, and phage virulence as well as host defense mechanisms will evolve in an arms race manner. On the contrary, lysogeny is favored when the host cell density is not high enough for maintenance of the phage density by repeated cycles of lytic infections.Nilsson, A.S. and E. Hagg√•rd-Ljungquist, Evolution of P2-like phages and their impact on bacterial evolution. Research in Microbiology, 2007. 158(4): p. 311-317. It is well known that phage P2 has the potential to mediate horizontal gene transfer upon infection of different bacteria. During this process, phage P2 can serve as a source of new genes to the hosts, which provides materials for evolution and selection. Compared to evolution through mutation and selection, phage-mediated genetic changes can affect drastic alterations to bacterial metabolism and physiology within a short time, and they may confer fitness to their hosts. For example, Edlin et al. found that the lysogenic E. coli having a Œª, P1, P2, or Mu prophage could grow more rapidly than a non-lysogenic counterpart under nutrient-limited condition.Edlin, G., L. Lin, and R. Kudrna, Œª Lysogens of E. coli reproduce more rapidly than non-lysogens. 1975.Edlin, G., L. Lin, and R. Bitner, Reproductive fitness of P1, P2, and Mu lysogens of Escherichia coli. J Virol, 1977. 21(2): p. 560-564. Furthermore, it was shown that P2 prophage may contribute to the dissemination of cytolethal distending toxins among E. coli O157 strains and facilitate their niche expansion among different animal hosts, which provides new insights into the pathogenesis of E. coli O157.Svab, D., et al., Sequence variability of P2-like prophage genomes carrying the cytolethal distending toxin V operon in Escherichia coli O157.

It was founded in 1798, began breeding Lipizzan horses in 1920, and today is the primary breeding farm that produces the stallions used by the Spanish Riding School, where the best stallions of each generation bred at Piber are brought for training and later public performance.\\"WELCOME TO PIBER\\" Bundesgest√ºt Piber Web site, accessed April 10, 2010 One of Piber‚Äôs major objectives is \\"to uphold a substantial part of Austria‚Äôs cultural heritage and to preserve one of the best and most beautiful horse breeds in its original form.\\" \\"The Lipizzaner stud introduces itself.\\" Bundesgest√ºt Piber Bundesgest√ºt Piber Web site, accessed September 12, 2010 History Piber Castle was formerly the Abbey of St. Lambrecht. The stud was created 1798 for the purpose of breeding military horses. In 1867, it came under the governance of the Austro-Hungarian Imperial Ministry for Agriculture.\\"History.\\" Bundesgest√ºt Piber Web site, accessed April 10, 2010 In 1915, at the beginning of World War I, the Lipizzan horses from the Court Stud at Lipica (today located in Slovenia) were evacuated and placed at Laxenburg and Kladrub. Following the war, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was broken up, with Lipica becoming part of Italy. Thus, the animals were divided up between several different studs in the new postwar nations of Austria, Italy, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslovia. The nation of Austria kept the stallions of the Spanish Riding School and some breeding stock. By 1920, the Austrian breeding stock was consolidated at Piber. During World War II, the high command of Nazi Germany transferred most of Europe's Lipizzan breeding stock to Hostau, Czechoslovakia. The breeding stock was taken from Piber in 1942. By spring of 1945, the horses at Hostau were in danger from the advancing Soviet army, which may have slaughtered the animals for horsemeat had it captured the facility. However, the Third Army's United States Second Cavalry, a tank unit under the command of Colonel Charles Reed, had discovered the horses at Hostau, where there were also 400 Allied prisoners of war, and had occupied it on April 28, 1945. \\"Operation Cowboy,\\" as the rescue was known, resulted in the recovery of 1,200 horses, including 375 Lipizzans, General George S. Patton learned of the raid, and arranged for the director of the Spanish Riding School, Alois Podhajsky to fly to Hostau.Hirshson, General Patton, p. 635 On May 12, American soldiers began riding, trucking and herding the horses 35 miles across the border into Kotztinz, Germany. The Lipizzans were eventually settled in temporary quarters in Wimsbach, until the breeding stock returned to Piber in 1952. Piber, and the Lipizzan breed as a whole, suffered a setback to its population when a viral epidemic hit the Piber Stud in 1983. Forty horses and eight percent of the expected foal crop were lost. Since then, the population at the stud has increased, with 100 mares at the stud as of 1994 and a foal crop of 56 born in 1993. In 1994, the pregnancy rate increased from 27% to 82% as the result of a new veterinary center.Edwards, The Encyclopedia of the Horse, p. 129 Today In 2001, the Spanish Riding School and the Piber Federal Stud were spun off from government support and together became a public company. though the owner is still the federal government of Austria. In 2003, the province of Styria held an Exhibition entitled \\"The Mythical Horse.\\" This resulted in extensive investments in the stud's infrastructure and allowed the stud to become a venue for holding both equestrian and cultural events. The facility has a staff of 52, and hosts approximately 60,000 visitors a year. The Piber stud and Piber castle are marketed together as tourist attractions. Visitors can watch training sessions with the horses in the riding arena, visit the stables, and take part in special programs for children. There are also cultural and musical events in the castle courtyard, which has excellent acoustics. Carriage rides are available, and the baroque buildings on the ground are available for concerts, festivals and weddings.\\"Visitor Information\\" 'Bundesgest√ºt Piber Web site, accessed April 10, 2010 Breeding program Horse at Piber The Piber Federal Stud is 555 hectares in size.

Approximately 40 foals per year are born at Piber. Young horses grow up in a herd and spend their first three summers on alpine pastures. Meticulous records are kept on every horse from the moment of their birth to the completion of their training.\\"Horses for sale\\" Bundesgest√ºt Piber Web site, accessed April 10, 2010 The Piber Federal Stud is the only location containing foundation bloodstock from all 15 classically recognized mare families. The facility includes stables for stallions, but also extensive grazing and pastures. At the age of four, selected stallions come to Vienna, while the others are sold. After several years of training in Vienna, the stallions chosen for breeding purposes come back to Piber. To avoid inbreeding, Piber works in cooperation with other Lipizzan stud farms in Slovenia, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Romania, to periodically exchange breeding stock. To help support the breeding program, Piber offers an \\"adoption\\" program where individuals and corporations can sponsor an individual animal with an annual monetary donation.\\"ADOPTING AT SPANISCHE HOFREITSCHULE - BUNDESGEST√úT PIBER\\" Bundesgest√ºt Piber Web site, accessed April 10, 2010 Future trends The Spanish Riding School also has facilities for a summer retreat for the stallions of the school. Although it was commonly thought the stallions of the school went to Piber for the summer, only the few used in a particular breeding season are taken to Piber. The summer retreat for most stallions of the school was elsewhere. For many years, they went to the Lainzer Tiergarten, where the horses were kept in the stables of the Hermesvilla. Since 2005, the school stallions spend their summer in Heldenberg near Vienna, in Lower Austria. This current summer stable will be expanded into a new year-round facility to provide additional capacity for training more young Lipizzaner stallions in the Haute Ecole of Classical Dressage than has been possible in the past.\\"SUMMER RESIDENCE AND TRAINING FACILITY IN HELDENBERG: AN OUTLOOK ON THE FUTURE\\" Spanish Riding School web site, accessed September 22, 2011.

Background Olambala was bred in Tennessee by John G. Greener. He was sired by the British-born sire Ornus, a son of Bend Or, a two-time leading broodmare sire in Great Britain & Ireland who was imported to stand at stud in the United States. New York Times - August 24, 1910 Olambala's dam was Blue and White, a daughter of the 1885 leading sire in North America, Virgil.

Dominique Catherine de P√©rignon commanded the French army and Domingo Salvator Izquierdo led the Spanish defenders. The siege took place during the War of the Pyrenees which was part of the French Revolutionary Wars. The war ended in July 1795 and Roses was soon restored to Spain. Roses is a coastal city in northeastern Spain, located northeast of Girona, Catalonia. The French inflicted a severe defeat on the Spanish army at the Black Mountain in November 1794. In the aftermath, the French army quickly captured Figueras and its fortress. At the same time, they undertook a formal siege of Roses. P√©rignon and his lieutenant Pierre Fran√ßois Sauret soon realized that an outlying fort was the key to Roses and concentrated their energy on reducing it. A month after the fort fell, the Spanish fleet evacuated the garrison by sea. Background On 17 November 1794, the French Army of the Eastern Pyrenees under General of Division Jacques Fran√ßois Dugommier attacked Lieutenant General Luis Firmin de Carvajal, Conde de la Union's Spanish army in the Battle of the Black Mountain. The French army routed their adversaries in a four-day combat in which both commanding generals were killed. General of Division Dominique Catherine de P√©rignon assumed command of the French army and quickly occupied the city of Figueres. The French general bluffed Brigadier General Jos√© Andr√©s Valdes into surrendering the 9,000-man garrison of Sant Ferran Castle on 28 November. On the same day, General of Division Pierre Fran√ßois Sauret invested the port of Roses.Ostermann-Chandler (1987), 408Smith (1998), 96 Siege=Forces The defenses of Roses consisted of a Vauban-type citadel (Ciutadella de Roses) and the Castell de la Trinitat. These fortifications were ordered by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor in 1543 and completed by 1570. The citadel had a modified pentagonal shape with five bastions and demi-lunes on all sides except the sea side. The Castillo de la Trinidad was a 4-pointed star-shaped work on a height.Goode (2010), Roses The citadel is located just west of the town while the castillo crowns a promontory 2.3 km south-southeast of the citadel.Ostermann-Chandler (1987), 415 map The 300-meter high Mont Puy- Bois dominated the Castillo on the northeast. Lieutenant General Domingo Salvator Izquierdo commanded the 4,800 men of the Spanish garrison. Admiral Federico Carlos Gravina y Napoli's fleet of 13 ships of the line and 45 other vessels lay in the Bay of Roses. These ships provided gunfire and logistic support to the garrison.Ostermann-Chandler (1987), 413 On 28 November the French invested Roses with 13,261 soldiers. While Sauret had immediate command over the besiegers, P√©rignon remained the driving force in prosecuting the siege. Six brigades were subordinated to Sauret for the operation. The brigades were commanded by Generals of Brigade Claude Perrin Victor (2,455 infantry), Joseph Magdelaine Martin (1,747 infantry), Robert Motte (1,799 infantry), Jean-Jacques Causse (1,403 infantry), Th√©odore Chabert (2,118 infantry), and Fran√ßois Gilles Guillot (1,019 infantry and 123 cavalry). General of Division Jean Baptiste Beaufort de Thorigny's 2,586 infantry and 211 cavalry were in support at Castillon.Smith (1998), 102Prats (2007), Le Bluff. Prats placed Abel Joseph Guillot in Sauret's division.Mulli√©, Guillot. This source stated that Fran√ßois Gilles Guillot served in the Eastern Pyrenees and was wounded on 20 November 1794 (that is, at the Battle of the Black Mountain). Action Dominique P√©rignon On 29 November, the first battery opened fire on the fortress and the French began digging siege trenches. By 7 December, six batteries were pounding the defenses. Izquierdo launched several ineffectual sorties at the French as their siege parallels drew closer to the citadel. By this time P√©rignon realized that the Castillo de la Trinidad, whose fire caused serious damage to the besiegers, was the key position. He ordered that heavy guns be installed on Mont Puy-Bois. When the French engineers protested that it could not be done, the commanding general overrode their objections. The French soldiers, whose nickname for the Castillo was le Bouton de Rose (the Pimple), managed to haul three batteries to the summit by 25 December. The batteries on Mont Puy-Bois finally breached the walls of the Castillo and its garrison was taken off in boats on 1 January. From the newly captured position, the French opened fire on the citadel and the fleet. Meanwhile, the army of Lieutenant General Jos√© de Urrutia y de las Casas held a position behind the Rio Fluvi√† to the south of Roses, threatening to advance to its relief. By 25 January, when wintry weather compelled Sauret to suspend siege operations, Urrutia's army had grown menacingly large. Determined to take the fortress, P√©rignon decided to try bluff again. He stormed the Spanish advanced positions on 1 February. The French army commander staged obvious preparations for a full-scale assault, such as the display of scaling ladders in the trenches. This finally broke the morale of the defenders. Izquierdo ordered the surviving members of the garrison to be evacuated by Gravina's squadron on the night of 3 February, leaving a 300-man rear guard behind to cover the operation. The rear guard was supposed to be taken off in small boats in the morning, but they were abandoned by the fleet and became French prisoners.Ostermann-Chandler (1987), 413‚Äì414 Results The Spanish reported 113 killed, 470 wounded, and 1,160 sick during the siege. In addition, 300 soldiers fell into French hands. French losses are unknown but were claimed to be light. Annoyed that P√©rignon was unable to advance beyond the Fluvi√†, the French government replaced him at the end of May 1795 with General of Division Barth√©lemy Louis Joseph Sch√©rer. Urrutia defeated Sch√©rer at the Battle of Bascara on 14 June.

Thomas (ed.), Three Views on the Origins of the Synoptic Gospels, Kregel Academic, p. 10. It is a proposed solution to the synoptic problem, which concerns the pattern of similarities and differences between the three Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. The hypothesis, following an original proposal by Augustine of Hippo and expanded by Johann Jakob Griesbach (it was once called the Griesbach hypothesis), was introduced in its current form by William Farmer in 1964.William Farmer, The Synoptic Problem: A Critical Analysis, New York: Macmillan, 1964. This hypothesis is the most serious alternative to the two-source hypothesis.Black Its main advantages over the two-source hypothesis include the fact that it relies not just on internal evidence, that it does not require lost sources like the Q document, and that it is supported by the view of the early Church. Unlike the two- source hypothesis, the two-gospel hypothesis concludes that the traditional accounts of the gospels (order and date of publication, as well as authorship) are accurate.Beck A further development of the Augustinian and Griesbach hypotheses is found in the hypothesis of Eta Linnemann, followed by F. David Farnell, that the \\"two Gospels\\" were required by the \\"two witnesses\\" rule of Deuteronomy.Robert L. Thomas Three views on the origins of the Synoptic Gospels 2002 p255, and p322 \\"Farnell 's third axiom notes, quoting Linnemann, that the reason for four independent Gospels stems from the legal principle of Deuteronomy 19:15b: \\"[O]n the evidence of two or three witnesses a matter shall be confirmed.\\"\\" Overview Almost all of Mark's content is found in Matthew, and much of Mark is similarly found in Luke. Additionally, Matthew and Luke have a large amount of material in common that is not found in Mark. The hypothesis states that Matthew was written first, while Christianity was still centered in Jerusalem, to calm the hostility between Jews and Christians. After Matthew, as the church expanded beyond the Holy Land, Luke was written as a gospel to the Gentiles. But since neither Luke (nor his patron Paul) were eyewitnesses of Jesus, Peter gave public testimonies that validated Luke's gospel. These public speeches were transcribed into Mark's gospel and distributed immediately thereafter, as recorded by the early Church father Irenaeus. Paul then allowed Luke's gospel to be published.Black The proposal suggests that Matthew was written by the apostle Matthew, probably in the 40s AD. At the time, the church had yet to extend outside of Jerusalem. The primary political problem within the church community was caused by the fact that Jewish authorities were outright hostile to Jesus and his followers. Matthew wrote his account in order to show that Jesus was actually the fulfillment of what Jewish scripture had prophesied. It has been long recognized that Matthew is the most ‚ÄúJewish‚Äù of the gospels. It, for example, heavily references Jewish scripture and Jewish history.Black When Stephen was martyred, as recorded in the Book of Acts, the disciples scattered beyond Jerusalem into Gentile (mostly Greek but also Syriac) towns. There they began preaching, and a large number of Pagans in Antioch quickly became Christians. By the mid 50s, Paul, who converted and claimed the title of \\"Apostle to the Gentiles\\" began to realize the need for a gospel to the Gentiles. This gospel would have to deemphasize the Mosaic Law and recent Jewish history in order to appeal to Greeks and Romans. Paul commissioned his associate, Luke, who used Matthew, as well as other sources. The first verses of Luke's gospel reference the fact that ‚Äúmany have undertaken to draw up an account‚Äù of the testimony of the actual eyewitnesses, and, as such, he has ‚Äúcarefully investigated everything from the beginning‚Äù in order to ‚Äúwrite an orderly account‚Äù. Once the gospel had been written, Paul delayed its publication. He decided that he needed Peter's public testimony as to its accuracy, since neither Paul nor Luke had known Jesus before his death.Black Paul asked Peter, who was the leader of the Apostles, to testify that Luke's account was accurate. According to early church sources, Peter gave a series of speeches to senior Roman army officers. Due to the commonality between Mark and Luke, these speeches would have constituted Peter's public ‚Äúseal of approval‚Äù upon Luke's gospel. These church sources suggest that Peter was ambivalent when Mark asked him if he could write down the words of the speeches. However, since the Roman officers who heard the speeches liked them, they asked for copies, and so Mark made fifty copies of Peter's speeches. These copies began circulating, and became Mark's gospel. Only after the speeches by Peter were made (and Mark's transcriptions began circulating) did Paul feel confident enough to publish Luke's gospel.Beck The two-gospel hypothesis assumes that Peter made sure that his speeches agreed with both Matthew and (the still unpublished) Luke. Since Matthew was the primary source for Luke, and Matthew's gospel (the only published gospel at the time) would have been well known to Peter, he mostly would have preached on the contents of Matthew. Knowing Matthew better than Luke, Peter was more likely to mention details found in Matthew and not Luke than vice versa. This would explain why there are more details found in Mark and Matthew but not Luke than there are details found in Mark and Luke but not Matthew. It also explains why Mark is so much shorter than Matthew and Luke, is more anecdotal and emotional, is less polished, and why only it begins immediately with Jesus‚Äô public ministry. Peter was giving public speeches as to what he saw, and never intended his speeches to become a full gospel. This was directly asserted by the early church historians, and explains why there are so few commentaries on Mark (as opposed to Matthew, Luke and John) until a relatively late date. It appears to have been considered the least important gospel in the early church.Black Internal and external evidence Much of the evidence for the two-gospel hypothesis comes from the gospels themselves (\\"internal evidence\\"), while some of the evidence is found in the testimony of the early church (\\"external evidence\\"). The early church did not just testify as to who wrote the gospels, in what order, and when they wrote them, it also testified on the specific circumstances surrounding the creation of each gospel. For example, early church documents claim that Mark's Gospel was created after Mark made fifty copies of a series of speeches that Peter had given in Rome. The external evidence (mainly the testimony of the early church) is the main difference between the two hypotheses. The two-gospel hypothesis does not dismiss the views of the early church, and makes assumptions based on both the internal and external evidence. The two-source hypothesis, in contrast, is based on the internal evidence for Marcan priority.Beck Contrasted with the two-source hypothesis Approximately 25% of Matthew and 25% of Luke are identical, but are not found in Mark. This has been explained in the two-source hypothesis as coming from the hypothetical Q document, although by the two-gospel hypothesis, this material was copied by Luke from Matthew, but not testified to by Mark because Peter had not seen it. The two-source hypothesis also assumes that the information unique to Matthew (‚ÄúM‚Äù) and Luke (‚ÄúL‚Äù) came from unknown sources. The two-gospel hypothesis, in contrast, assumes ‚ÄúM‚Äù to be mostly Matthew's testimony and ‚ÄúL‚Äù to be the eyewitness accounts mentioned in the first verses of Luke's gospel. In addition, it gives a specific reason for the fact that Mark has more in common with Matthew than it does with Luke. By the 1960s, scholars considered the two-source hypothesis to be the unquestioned solution to the synoptic problem. By the 1990s, however, the consensus had ended, and some scholars claimed that the two-source hypothesis had even been disproven. Subsequently, the two- gospel hypothesis has emerged as the most serious challenger to the two-source hypothesis.Beck The two-gospel theory is more of a conjecture than the two- source hypothesis because, unlike that theory, it depends on the unreliable accounts of the early church. Since the two-source hypothesis does not accept the conjecture of the early church, it follows from internal evidence (such as the shortness of Mark) and logic (e.g. ‚Äòwhy would Mark write a shorter version of a gospel in existence?‚Äô)Black Compared to the Griesbach hypothesis The Griesbach hypothesis also suggests that the Gospel of Matthew was written first. The Gospel of Luke was written using Matthew as a source. Then the Gospel of Mark was written using both Matthew and Luke. The Griesbach hypothesis is similar to the two-gospel hypothesis. However, unlike the two- gospel hypothesis, the Griesbach hypothesis is principally a literary hypothesis. What came to be labeled the Griesbach Hypothesis was already anticipated by the British scholar Henry Owen (1716‚Äì1795), in a piece he published in 1764, and by Friedrich Andreas Stroth (1750‚Äì1785) in an article he published anonymously in 1781. Johann Jakob Griesbach (January 4, 1745 ‚Äì March 24, 1812), to whom this source hypothesis was first accredited, alluded to his conclusion that Matthew wrote the first of the canonical gospels and that Luke, not Mark, made first use of Matthew in composing the second of the canonical gospels in an address celebrating the Easter season at the University of Jena in 1783. Later, for similar Whitsun programs at Jena (1789‚Äì1790), Griesbach published a much more detailed \\"Demonstration that the Whole Gospel of Mark is Excerpted from the Narratives of Matthew & Luke.\\" Griesbach's theory was, therefore, one of direct literary dependence between and among the gospels of Matthew, Luke and Mark, or what German scholars came to call a \\"utilization hypothesis.\\" According to Griesbach, the historical order of the gospels was, first, Matthew; second, Luke, making use of Matthew and other non-Matthaean tradition; and third, Mark, making use of both Matthew and Luke. In proposing this hypothesis, Griesbach maintained Matthaean priority, as had Augustine before him, along with every other scholar in the church prior to the late eighteenth century. Griesbach's main support for his thesis lies in passages where Matthew and Luke agree over and against Mark (e.g. Matthew 26:68; Luke 22:64; Mark 14:65), the so-called Minor Agreements.  Criticism  Many generic arguments in favor of Markan Priority and/or Two- source hypothesis also work as arguments against the two-gospel hypothesis. While it is impossible to list all arguments in favor and against the theory, some notable arguments are as follows. * If Luke had access to the final version of Matthew (as opposed to both drawing independently on other sources), why are there so many significant differences between Luke and Matthew on issues such as Jesus' genealogy, circumstances of birth, and events following resurrection? While Luke and Matthew do share a lot of text which is not present in Mark, almost all of it is confined to teachings and parables. Construction of the gospels in accordance with the two-gospel hypothesis would require Luke to rewrite major parts of Matthew's narrative ‚Äì even though Matthew was presumably an eyewitness who lived in Jerusalem and was surrounded by other eyewitnesses, and Luke was neither. * \\"The argument from omission\\": why would Mark and Peter omit such remarkable and miraculous events as virgin birth of Jesus and particularly his appearance to apostles following resurrection? Both Matthew and Luke explicitly attest that Jesus appeared to the eleven disciples, including Peter, after his resurrection, and it seems incredible that Peter would not testify to that fact in his public speeches. And why is Sermon on the Mount completely omitted? * Many scholars (and particularly most Jewish scholars) hold that the concept of virgin birth in Christianity originated with mistranslation of Isaiah 7:14 into Greek, and therefore that authors of Matthew and Luke were Gentiles. This can be reconciled with the traditional Biblical chronology that dates both gospels no earlier than 75 AD and attributes \\"the Gospel of Matthew\\" to an unknown author, but it's in clear contradiction with the position of the two-gospel hypothesis that Matthew was the Saint Matthew, and, therefore, a Jew.  Variants  A related theory has Luke drawing not directly from Matthew, but from a common source, seen as a proto-Matthew. This was advanced in the nineteenth century by Wilhelm de Wette and Friedrich Bleek, and more recently revived by Powers. Matthaean priority is also a cornerstone of the Augustinian hypothesis, which, however, has Luke drawing from Mark rather than vice versa.

Maximum diameter is about 1 micrometer. Carbon nanocones are conical structures which are made predominantly from carbon and which have at least one dimension of the order one micrometer or smaller. Nanocones have height and base diameter of the same order of magnitude; this distinguishes them from tipped nanowires which are much longer than their diameter. Nanocones occur on the surface of natural graphite. Hollow carbon nanocones can also be produced by decomposing hydrocarbons with a plasma torch. Electron microscopy reveals that the opening angle (apex) of the cones is not arbitrary, but has preferred values of approximately 20¬∞, 40¬∞, and 60¬∞. This observation was explained by a model of the cone wall composed of wrapped graphene sheets, where the geometrical requirement for seamless connection naturally accounted for the semi-discrete character and the absolute values of the cone angle. A related carbon nanoform is the single-walled carbon nanohorn which typically form aggregates 80‚Äì100 nm in size. Free-standing hollow cones=History and synthesis Carbon nanocones are produced in an industrial process that decomposes hydrocarbons into carbon and hydrogen with a plasma torch having a plasma temperature above 2000 ¬∞C. This method is often referred to as Kvaerner Carbon Black & Hydrogen Process (CBH) and it is relatively \\"emission-free\\", i.e., produces rather small amount of air pollutants. At certain, well optimized and patented conditions, the solid carbon output consists of approximately 20% carbon nanocones, 70% flat carbon discs and 10% carbon black. Plasma-assisted decomposition of hydrocarbons has long been known and applied, for example, for production of carbon fullerenes. Even if not optimized, it yields small amounts of carbon nanocones, which had been directly observed with an electron microscope already in 1994, and their atomic structure was theoretically modeled the same year. Atomic model of a cone with the 38.9¬∞ apex angle. Modeling Statistical distribution of the apex values measured over 1700 hollow nanocones. The open carbon cone can be modeled as a wrapped graphene sheet. In order to have strain-free, seamless wrapping, a sector has to be cut out of the sheet. That sector should have an angle of n √ó 60¬∞, where n = 1, ..., 5\\\\. Therefore, the resulting cone angle should have only certain, discrete values Œ± = 2 arcsin(1 ‚àí n/6) = 112.9¬∞, 83.6¬∞, 60.0¬∞, 38.9¬∞, and 19.2¬∞ for n = 1, ..., 5, respectively. The graphene sheet is composed solely of carbon hexagons which can not form a continuous cone cap. As in the fullerenes, pentagons have to be added to form a curved cone tip, and their number is correspondingly n = 1, ..., 5. Observation Electron microscopy observations do confirm the model prediction of discrete cone angles. Two experimental artifacts must be considered though: (i) charging of the poorly conducting carbon samples under electron beam, which blurs the images and (ii) that electron microscopy observations at a fixed sample tilt only yield a two-dimensional projection whereas a 3D shape is required. The first obstacle is overcome by coating the cones with a metal layer of a few nanometers thickness. The second problem is solved through a geometrical shape analysis. Combined with significant statistics on the number of cones, it yields semi-discrete apex angles. Their values deviate from prediction by about 10% due to the limited measurement accuracy and slight variation of the cone thickness along its length. Image of a coffee filter illustrating one of the anomalous structures in the carbon nanocone growth. The absolute value of the cone wall thickness varies between 10 and 30 nm, but can be as large as 80 nm for some nanocones. To elucidate the structure of the cone walls, electron diffraction patterns were recorded at different cone orientations. Their analysis suggests that the walls contain 10‚Äì30% of ordered material covered with amorphous carbon. High-resolution electron microscopy reveals that the ordered phase consists of nearly parallel layers of graphene. The amorphous fraction can be converted into well-ordered graphite by annealing the cones at temperatures about 2700 ¬∞C. The remarkable feature of the open carbon nanocones produced by the CBH process is their almost ideal shape, with straight walls and circular bases. Non-ideal cones are also observed, but these are exceptions. One such deviation was a \\"double\\" cone, which appeared as if a cone started to grow from its tip with a certain apex angle (e.g. 84¬∞), but then abruptly changed the apex angle (e.g. to 39¬∞) in a single point on its surface, thus producing a break in the observed cross- section of the cone. Another anomaly was a cone with the apex extended from a point to a line segment, as in the expanded coffee filter (flat form is shown in the picture). Statistical distribution of the apex values measured over 554 cones grown on natural graphite. Other cones Carbon cones have also been observed, since 1968 or even earlier, on the surface of naturally occurring graphite. Their bases are attached to the graphite and their height varies between less than 1 and 40 micrometers. Their walls are often curved and are less regular than those of the laboratory made nanocones. The distribution of their apex angle also shows a strong feature at 60¬∞, but other expected peaks, at 20¬∞ and 40¬∞, are much weaker and the distribution is somewhat broader for large angles. This difference is attributed to the different wall structure of the natural cones. Those walls are relatively irregular and contain numerous line defects (positive-wedge disclinations). This breaks down the angular requirement for a seamless cone and therefore broadens the angular distribution. Potential applications Sequential electron micrographs showing the process of capping a gold needle with a CBH carbon nanocone (top left) Carbon nanocones have been used to cap ultrafine gold needles. Such needles are widely used in scanning probe microscopy owing to their high chemical stability and electrical conductivity, but their tips are prone to mechanical wear due to the high plasticity of gold. Adding a thin carbon cap mechanically stabilizes the tip without sacrificing its other properties.

He is best remembered as an imprisoned conscientious objector during World War I and as the longtime head of the Federated Press, a left wing news service which supplied content to radical and labor newspapers around the country. Background Carl Haessler was born August 5, 1888 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin of ethnic German parents. His father was a building contractor and his mother was a teacher in the Milwaukee public school system. Carl attended public school in Milwaukee and went on to college at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, from which he graduated in 1911 with a bachelor's degree in Latin.Wayne State University, \\"The Carl Haessler Collection: Papers, 1908-1972,\\" Walter P. Reuther Library, Wayne State University. During his early years, Haessler raised money for his education by working summers as a farm hand.Solon DeLeon with Irma C. Hayssen and Grace Poole (eds.), The American Labor Who's Who. New York: Hanford Press, 1925; pg. 93. From 1911 to 1914, Haessler attended Balliol College of Oxford University in England. There he became interested in the socialist movement and joined the Fabian socialists. Career Upon his return to the United States in 1914, Haessler took a job teaching in the Philosophy Department of Illinois University at Urbana. He also continued work on his Ph.D., which he received upon completion of his dissertation, entitled \\"The Failure of Scottish Realism.\\" Politics Haessler joined the Socialist Party of America in 1914. With American entry into the European conflict early in 1917, the ethnic German pacifist Haessler was dismissed from the university for his political views. He went to work for Victor L. Berger at his socialist daily newspaper, The Milwaukee Leader, remaining their for about a year. During this time he joined the News Writer's Union and the delegate of that organization to the Milwaukee Federated Trades Council. In the spring of 1918, Haessler was drafted into the U.S. Army. He accepted being drafted but refused to put on the uniform in boot camp and was therefore court martialed under military law. Haessler was found guilty and issued a sentence of 12 years of hard labor. Haessler completed just over two years of his prison sentence, served at the stockades of Fort Leavenworth and Alcatraz military prison from June 1918 until his being released in August 1920 by a presidential pardon. During Haessler's time in prison, his wife, Mildred Haessler, obtained a job as a teacher to support herself.Harry Gannes, \\"Yipsels and the Socialist Sedition Trial,\\" The Young Socialists‚Äô Magazine [Chicago], v. 13, no. 3 (March 1919), pp. 10-12, 17. During his time in prison, Haessler was removed for a brief period when he was called as a witness for the prosecution in the federal trial of Congressman Victor Berger. The prosecution attempted to demonstrate that Haessler's position as an imprisoned conscientious objector was a product of Berger's direct influence, thereby providing proof of Berger's criminality with respect to the current conscription law. Haessler would have none of it however, replying when asked if he and Berger had had any talks about the war: > Oh yes, I had lots of talks with Berger about the war. You see, I might say > that I knew Victor Berger before I was born, since he knew my mother and > father. But I don't remember what he said on those talks; I remember > distinctly what I said, but his views did not impress me at all. I was far > more interested in my views anyhow than I was in his. Haessler characterized his views as significantly to the left of those of Berger, whom he called an \\"old fogey\\" that had told him \\"not to be a damned fool\\" and who had considered Haessler too young and rash and impulsive. Federated Press Upon his release, Haessler returned for a time to the employ of Berger's Milwaukee Leader before joining the fledgling Federated Press news service, a press agency which provided news copy to scores of radical and labor newspapers around the country. The Federated Press was initially established by E.J. Costello, former managing editor of The Milwaukee Leader. In 1922, Haessler was named as the managing editor and secretary-treasurer of the Federated Press, positions which he retained until the end of the news service in 1956. Haessler was also named associate editor of The Federated Press Bulletin, the weekly newspaper of the Federated Press issued for subscribers across America.\\"Proceedings of the League Convention,\\" The Federated Press Bulletin, v. 2, no. 19 (Feb. 11, 1922), pg. 2. Cited by Tim Davenport, \\"Federated Press League: Organizational History,\\" Early American Marxism website, Corvallis, OR. In his capacities with the Federated Press, Haessler was a member of the International Typographical Union. In 1937, Haessler went to work for the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) handling the union's public relations from Flint, Michigan during its series of sitdown strikes there. He also served as editor of The United Auto Worker until 1941 and was a longtime editor of Tool and Die Maker's News. Later years Beginning in 1963, Haessler became involved in draft counseling of conscientious objectors to the Vietnam War. Personal life and death Haessler married Lucy Haessler; they lived for many years at 39 Massachusetts Street in the Highland Park area of Detroit, Michigan. His sister, Gertrude Haessler, married William Weinstone, a high ranking-official of the Communist Party. Carl Haessler died age 84 on December 8, 1972.

History  Construction began in 1535, during which the Temple of San Juan de Dios temporarily served as the cathedral church of the diocese. In 1640, the cathedral was installed and the seat of the diocese was transferred to Our Lady of the Assumption. Due to earthquakes in the 16th and 18th centuries, the cathedral had to be reconstructed several times, with the most recent reconstruction beginning in 1702 and finishing in 1733. Structure Its facade is made of green cantera stone commonly found in Oaxaca's buildings, and the interior is in Neoclassical style. The altar features a statue of Our Lady of the Assumption (Nuestra Se√±ora de la Asunci√≥n) which was made in Italy during the Porfirian era, who is represented by a bronze sculpture brought from Europe and made by Tadoini. The towers of the cathedral are not the originals, as they were destroyed in 1931 by an earthquake. In the south there is a clock donated to Oaxaca by King Fernando VII. The Lord of Lightning is in the last chapel on the left, while the second on the right contains the remains of the Cross of Huatulco.

Overview Shortly after its publication, Newsweek called it \\"the best primer around on recent U.S. economic history.\\" In the book Krugman covers the US productivity slowdown that has occurred since the 1970s, changes in the ideology among economists, and offers critiques of both conservative supply side economics and liberal support for government intervention in the form of \\"strategic policy\\".Marc Levinson of Newsweek, Krugman argues the rise of the supply-side economics is produced by the inability of opposing economists to convincingly explain certain economic phenomena, such as the US productivity slowdown.

Liberalism should be more active\\", One of the major themes of the book is that the difference between real economic theory and \\"policy entrepreneurs\\", who peddle politically popular but academically wrong ideas, is as important as the polarization between the political left and right in America.Sylvia Nasar, \\"Economic Snake Oil\\", The New York Times, Books, March 13, 1994, Krugman describes these \\"policy entrepreneurs\\" as non- academics who promote particular intellectual positions and ideological policy prescriptions in areas where a problem is perceived to exist.

History The idea for a ship originated when owner and creator Larry Mahan was in the fourth grade. His dream was to build the biggest ship on Cape Cod. In 1970 at his new house in Marstons Mills, he began construction. Over the next 26 years, the ship was built by over 1,000 volunteers.

The pilot performed an autorotation landing in a forest following the failure of both engines. The helicopter suffered extensive damage and was written off as a total loss, but despite the severity of the crash there were no fatalities. Fourteen of the 15 people on board were injured, including Leszek Miller, who had two of his thoracic vertebrae broken. Aircraft and pilot The helicopter was 26 years old at the time of the crash, and was close to the end of its service. It belonged to the 36th Special Aviation Regiment responsible for transporting Polish government officials. The pilot of the helicopter was major Marek Mi≈Çosz, later promoted to lieutenant colonel. Cause The cause of the engine failure was determined to be icing. Trial On 10 March 2004, Mi≈Çosz was criminally charged with violating flight safety rules and causing the crash. Specifically, the pilot was blamed for not manually turning on the deicing equipment during the flight. The pilot argued that the meteorologic information available to him at the time did not indicate that icing was likely, and hence he was not required to turn on the deicing equipment. He was consulting a thermometer during the flight, but it suffered from a systematic measurement error and hence was unable to warn of icing. In addition, during the flight an unusual thermal inversion occurred; the temperature rose with altitude, which the pilot could not have predicted. In March 2010, the 6-year trial ended with a verdict of not guilty. The judge in the case noted the pilot expertly carried out the difficult autorotation landing and that the passengers survived because of his superb piloting skills. Leszek Miller declared that if he had to fly again in a helicopter in difficult atmospheric conditions, he would choose Mi≈Çosz as his pilot.

It was released on December 20, 2005 by labels Sony BMG in India and Var√®se Sarabande internationally. The songs were composed by A. R.

Rahman with lyrics by Sukhwinder Singh and Raqeeb Alam, except for the song Vaishnava Janatho (which is a famous 15th century bhajan in Gujarati composed and lyricized by Narsinh Mehta). However, A. R. Rahman introduced new orchestration with new singers. The soundtrack was released by international label, Var√®se Sarabande but it is distributed in India by Sony BMG. The Indian release contains only the 6 Hindi songs composed by A.R.Rahman. Rahman has rated this as his only album which he would give a 10/10. The song Aayo Re Sakhi (Chan Chan) was considered for the Best Original Song nomination in the 2007 Academy Awards. The album kicks off with Aayo Re Sakhi, a song composed in Hindustani classical music, uses only rich Indian music instruments and is regarded as a master piece of the composer as well as vocalists Sadhana Sargam and Sukhwinder Singh. The next two tracks sung by Sadhana Sargam are noted especially for the rendition and use of soft instruments. They are soft in temper and is quite off-beat but their strength lie in the somber backdrops of the rhythm. The fourth track Sham Rang Bhar Do, beautifully penned by professional lyricist Raqeeb Alam is a Holi festival song and is beautifully sung by noted classical singer Richa Sharma and other male vocalists. The bhajan Vaishnava Janatho was not composed by A.R. Rahman, but the elements of the chant was completely modified by him. The final track Bhangari Morori is highly inspired by water, one of the five elements. It uses the flow of water in the background at various portions similar to some earlier tracks, in which the composer used many sounds from the nature. The extra tracks in the international release, by Mychael Danna use rich western music instruments which make the film, a perfect blende of Indian classical music and Western Classical Music. Director Deepa Mehta commented about the soundtrack: \\"The music that has been created for Water is simply breath- taking‚Ä¶It has the makings of a phenomenal soundtrack.\\" \\"Water was a wonderful experience.

The fortress-like complex is easily seen from the highway as one travels south from the capital city of Oaxaca on the road leading to Villa de Zaachila, and it is visited by both Mexican and international tourists. The complex is located on a small hill which gives it a view of much of the valley area. It is one of the most extravagant and elaborate colonial era constructions in Oaxaca, but it is often overlooked in favor of churches and monasteries located in the Mexico City area.Taylor, p. 3 Built of green quarried stone and river rocks, it is a quiet place where footsteps can echo in the hallways. The extravagances of the site, including the tall basilica, the elaborate baptismal font, the Gothic cloister and murals remain as national treasures. The decorative work of the monastery, especially its murals, are important because they show a systematic blending of indigenous elements into the Christian framework, done in order to support the evangelization process in the local Mixtec and Zapotec peoples.Taylor, p. iv The single-naved church is used for worship but the roofless basilica and cloister are under the control of INAH, which uses many of the second-floor rooms of the cloister as workshops for restoration projects and runs a small museum with important liturgical items from the 16th century. History Construction of the monastery complex began in the 1550s. The Dominicans came to Oaxaca and established themselves in Cuilapan in 1550, taking charge of evangelization efforts in the central valleys region.Taylor, p. 73 Official license to build the complex was granted in 1555 by viceroy Lu√≠s de Velasco and contained the mandate that the construction be ‚Äúmodest‚Äù.Taylor, p. 75 Construction began in 1556 with Antonio de Barbosa as designer. The complex is a mixture of several architectural styles that were predominant in Europe in the 16th century and includes Gothic, Renaissance, Plateresque and Mud√©jar elements. There are also some indigenous elements to be found in the decorative work. Unlike larger monastic institutions in Mexico City and Puebla, which could have as many as fifty monks, only four friars were stationed there in 1555, Domingo de Agui√±aga, Tom√°s Hurtado, Vicente G√≥mez and Antonio Barbosa. They were also in charge of the regular clergy, who probably built their church in the middle of the old Mixtec town. Abuses of the encomienda system, which reduced native population to near slaves, often led to grandiose projects, violating the mandate for modesty, with documents from the 1560s admonishing friars for their exploitation of native workers.Taylor, pp. 77‚Äì78 Construction of the complex was halted in the 1570s and the precise reason is not known. Possibilities include the lack of funds, or that the complex had become so sumptuous that authorities stopped it. Another very likely reason was a dispute over who should continue paying for the construction. If a monastery was built on encomienda land, then the encomendero (in this case the Cort√©s family) would pay. If built on Crown lands (such as the city of Antequera) then the Crown was responsible. Disputes over the land led to dispute over who needed to pay for the construction of the monastery. Another possibility was the native population declined from about 43,000 in the 1520s to 7,000 in 1600, leaving no workers. The pause was initially meant to be temporary, but it became permanent.Taylor, p. 60Taylor, pp. 79‚Äì80 In 1753, the church and monastery was secularized, meaning control passed from the Dominicans to regular priests. At this time, the monastery had a large collection of ecclesiastical ornaments, painted altarpieces, polychrome sculptures and murals. The complex served as the principal site of interaction between the native populations and the Spaniards and was the center of the political, economic, social and religious life of the town, becoming Cuilapan‚Äôs identifying feature.Taylor, p. 71 However, from this point the wealth and prestige of the institution declined. These secular authorities neglected the maintenance needs of the complex and it deteriorated until it was finally divested of its religious function by the 19th century.Taylor, p. 69 Vicente Guerrero was imprisoned in the small rooms of the lower cloister by political opponents and subsequently executed on 14 February 1831. The basilica and church remained unfinished and mostly unused as late as the 19th century. The single-naved church was roofed in the 19th and early 20th centuries and is the only portion of the complex which is used for worship. The basilica and monasteries are tourist attractions under the control of INAH. The Cristero War forced the closing of the complex altogether in 1926. When it reopened three years later, much of it was converted into a school for local rural children. Ten years later, that school was relocated to San Antonio de Cal and it was declared a national monument by Instituto Nacional de Arqueolog√≠a e Historia (INAH) on 10 July 1937. The main elements of the complex include the atrium, the three-aisled basilica, the single-naved church, the two-story cloister, the porteria (covered porch entrance to the cloister), a pilgrim reception area and a number of small chapels.Taylor, p. 1 Structure thumb Rests of Colonial mural paintings The complex is center on a large walled courtyard or atrium, with small stone chapels in the northeastern and northwestern corners. This rather large atrium had a practical as well as symbolic function. The atrium resembled the extensive courtyards (teocallis) of pre-Hispanic temples, and provided space for the 20,000 people that inhabited the area in the 1560s. With only four friars and a small enclosed church, large services in this open area, especially on Sundays and holidays, became the only practical solutionTaylor, pp. 84‚Äì85 The atrium possessed a large atrium cross similar to those found in Acolman, Alzacoalco, Tepoztl√°n and P√°tzcuaro, but only the base now remains.Taylor, p. 85 The largest structure is a rectangular unroofed basilica with elegant arches decorating its exterior facades.Taylor, p. 17 The facade is Plateresque, with three arched entrances topped by a triangular pediment with a crest over that. In the center of the pediment, there is the coat of arms of the Dominican order with a dog to the side, symbolizing Saint Dominic of Guzman. Flanking the facade are two towers with circular bases topped with peaked cones. The interior divides into three naves by heavy columns with Tuscan capitals, which were meant to support a complex Gothic roof. These arcades of stone columns are mirrored by a series of doorless arched entrances on the eastern and western facades of the building.Taylor, p. 86 This has led some to classify the building as an ‚Äúopen chapel,‚Äù but the purpose of this unusual feature is not truly known. The three nave design is also interesting as this had mostly gone out of fashion in other parts of Mexico in favor of single naved structures. No documents from that time explain why the older design was chosen A plaque located inside has a mixture of Mixtec signs and the date 1555 written in Arabic script One curious aside is a small wall and a large pile of rocks which is located to the side of this basilica. This is the remnants of the first wall, mixed with rock being prepared to build a house for Hern√°n Cort√©s. However, Cort√©s later abandoned this project. While smaller, a more traditional style church is considered to be the main one, and is still used as a religious building. The building is austere with heavy buttresses supporting a semicircular dome In the interior, there is an altarpiece with paintings attributed to Andr√©s de la Concha and a headstone marking the final resting place of Fray Francisco Burgoa. This church has only one nave with a choir and an upper choir area, baptistery and presbytery. At the side of the church is the area for pilgrims which preserves some of its dependencies and vestiges of its murals. The pilgrim area would often house travelers who did not have funds for hotel. The cloister is a two-story building, and much of it underwent restoration work in 1962. INAH occupies many of the second floor with workshops for restoration projects. There are also portraits of priests on the second floor which have been almost entirely lost to time. Vicente Guerrero was imprisoned in the noviate wing of this cloister for three days, with the window of his cell one of the site‚Äôs attractions. To the south of the monastery, there is a monument to the execution. One of the most significant aspects of the complex is its murals and other decorative features. There are both monochromatic and polychromatic murals, with monochromatic dominating. The murals contain Biblical and other religious scenes which show some interesting localized modifications, starting with the use of monochrome paintings.Taylor, p. 14 Elements of imagery and symbols from Mixtec and Zapotec religious and cultural traditions can be found in both the murals and in some of the architectural elements. The purpose of the blend was to juxtapose the spiritual traditions of Mesoamerica and the Iberian Peninsula. The idea was to make conversion easier for the indigenous people by allowing them to recognize similarities and compatibilities between the old and new religions so that there would be gradual conversion and acculturalation.Taylor, pp. 9‚Äì11 The most obvious of this is the large atrium, which mimics a teocalli or sacred precinct. A mural of the crucifixion on the wall of the sacristy of the basilica has scenery with references to the geographical features of Cuilapan. The monochromatic scenes in the processional corridors contain allusion to the religious practices and cosmogonies of the Mixtecs.Taylor, pp. 287 ReferencesBibliography * Category:Churches in Oaxaca Category:Museums in Oaxaca Category:History museums in Mexico Category:15th-century Roman Catholic church buildings Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1570 Category:1570 establishments in Mexico Category:Tourist attractions in Oaxaca Category:Gothic architecture in Mexico Category:Mud√©jar architecture Category:Renaissance architecture in Mexico Category:Neoclassical architecture in Mexico Category:Spanish Colonial architecture in Mexico ","title":"Monastery of Santiago Ap√≥stol, Cuilapan de Guerrero"},{"id":"26913269","text":"Michael C.

Whilst the village of Finmere is in Oxfordshire, the whole of RAF Finmere was located within the north-west corner of Buckinghamshire. It was served by the nearby Finmere railway station. Layout RAF Finmere consisted of three concrete runways, radiating from two adjacent points in the north-west corner of the site,Multimap.com aerial view with twenty-seven hardstandings and two hangars (types B1 and T2). History=Second World War A derelict Nissen hut, formerly used as a communal building Remains of the blast pens Built by the Air Ministry in 1941-42, it was commissioned by the RAF in July 1942 as a satellite to nearby RAF Bicester, which was an all-grass airfield and proved unserviceable during wet winter periods. No. 13 Operational Training Unit RAF moved to Finmere, bringing with them Bristol Blenheim Mk1 (short-nose) and Mk4 (long-nose) bombers. By the time of the arrival in 1943 of the similarly equipped No. 307 Ferry Training Unit RAF (FTU), formed at RAF Bicester in late 1942 to train pilots to ferry aircraft to northwest Africa, No. 13 OTU had moved onto the American A-20 Boston and North American B-25 Mitchell, much heavier aeroplanes with tricycle undercarriage. The arrival of these aircraft meant that Finmere quickly eclipsed its parent station at Bicester in terms of operational importance, as they could not land at Bicester. The arrival of No. 307 FTU also aided its pilots' conversion to the more modern types, as they had the opportunity to fly them back-to-back with their own Blenheims. There were also occasional visits from Supermarine Spitfires and Hawker Tempests from the Fighter Affiliation Flight at Bicester, training bomber crews in retaliation and avoidance of enemy fighters. 1944 saw No. 13 OTU convert to the de Havilland Mosquito: over the next years, Finmere became a major centre for Mosquito aircrew training with almost fifty airframes available, turning out thirty trained crews per month for the war in the Far East. This was pre- empted by the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

From left: the Kommandantenhaus with its staircase tower (Treppenturm), castle chapel (Schlosskapelle) and the Ablagerhaus Gifhorn Castle () is a castle in Gifhorn, Germany, built between 1525 and 1581 in the Weser Renaissance style. The castle was fortified until 1790 with moats, ramparts and bastions and was never captured. In the 16th century it was the Residenz of the Duchy of Gifhorn under Duke Francis of Brunswick-L√ºneburg for just 10 years.  Design  Merian copperplate of the fortified castle around 1654 Plan of the castle in the 18th century This well-fortified castle was built in the shape of a trapezium. It was surrounded by ramparts and a moat up to 50 metres wide. The immediate vicinity could be flooded to create a swamp. Stone bastion towers were built on the four corners of the site. These were linked to the castle by underground rampart passages (Wallg√§nge) in the form of casemates. A 45 metre long section is preserved today that led to the north bastion. Today it is used to house exhibitions for the castle museum. The original entrance to the castle was over a bridge on the narrow side of the castle moat in the southeast, that led to the gatehouse. Today the main entrance is through the old south bastion which has been reconstructed using sections of wall arranged in a circle. The following castle buildings are grouped around the inner courtyard: * The gatehouse (Torhaus) is the oldest building and was completed in 1526, one year after work began on the castle. Due to its oversized dimensions it was probably originally planned as a single building. The roof, with its semi-circular gables is extraordinary and none like it has been preserved anywhere else. Until the 18th century the entrance to the castle was through the gatehouse; after that it was used as a grain store. * The Ablagerhaus is the largest building in the east wing and acted from the 18th century as a residence for senior Gifhorn officials such as the Amtshauptmann. Its name, which means 'visit house', is derived from the fact that the occupants of its rooms had to vacate them when there was a lordly visit (Ablager) e.g. by royal hunting parties. This building contains the Great Hall (Rittersaal). * The castle chapel (Schlosskapelle) was built in 1547 and was the first religious building built for Protestant services in Germany. It contains the sarcophagus of Duke Francis on a gallery (Empore) below a window and a life-size, kneeling statue of the duke. The sarcophagus of his wife, Clara of Lauenburg, is empty, because she died during a trip to her Pomeranian home in Barth. Nevertheless, there is also a statue of her. * The Kommandantenhaus of 1581 was the residence of the Schlosshauptmann or Amtshauptmann. Later in the 19th and 20th century it became the seat of the county court (Amtsgericht) * The staircase tower of 1568, with its spiral staircase, links the gatehouse tower with the Ablagerhaus * The prison (Gefangenenhaus), armoury (Zeughaus) and grain store (Kornmagazin) in the west wing no longer exist. Instead, the prison complex (Justizvollzugsanstalt) was built here in the 19th and 20th centuries.  History = Earlier castle  The fortified predecessor of the castle was a moated castle on a defended, artificial hill built in the angle between the rivers Aller and Ise. According to an investigation around 1900 by the pre-historian, Carl Schuchhardt, the old castle - of which nothing remains today - was built around 1000. It is mentioned for the first time in a deed of 1296 where it is called Castrum Gifhorne. It was besieged, probably during fighting between Duke Albert the Fat and his brother, Henry the Admirable. At the end of the 13th century renovation work was carried out on the castle under the direction of Otto the Strict. As the village of Gifhorn developed, the importance of the castle grew, both for security reasons and as a customs post on a trade route. In the 14th century it was frequently enfeoffed to, amongst others, the lord of Veltheim and the town of Brunswick. In 1396 Duke Frederick transferred the castle to his wife Anna of Saxony as a life annuity. In the 15th century other tenants followed, like the von B√ºlows (1467), von Alvenslebens (1470), von Quitzows (1472) and von Bodendiekes (1477). During the Hildesheim Diocesan Feud the castle and town were destroyed in 1519. Both belonged at the time to the Duchy of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel.  Construction  The gatehouse, the first castle building to be completed (in 1526) The present structure was built from 1525 as a completely new castle, not on the site of its predecessor, but on a hill on what was then the northern edge of the town of Gifhorn. It was commissioned by the Protestant dukes, Ernest the Confessor of Brunswick-L√ºneburg and his brother Otto of Celle. Ernest gave the castle as a wedding present to his wife, Sophie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, on the occasion of their marriage in 1528. It was given to her as an annuity, under which she could use the building and its revenue. In 1539 Duke Ernest gave the castle and its surrounding √Ñmter to his youngest brother Duke Francis, who had returned from the court of the Elector of Saxony and was demanding his share of the inheritance.  Castle history  On taking over the castle in 1539, Duke Francis was able to indulge his noble image of himself and attended to his princely representational duties unfettered. He had Gifhorn Castle expanded as his Residenz and led an ostentatious, courtly life. At the same time he built Fallersleben Castle as a rural aristocratic estate. Life with his more prudent brother, Ernest and the relatively modest standard of living in the small Celle Residenz was not enough for him. Francis engaged the fortress architect, Michael Clare, from Celle. His works dominate the appearance of Gifhorn Castle. Duke Francis in the castle chapel After the death of Duke Francis in 1549 the castle ceased to be a princely Residenz. The Duchy of Gifhorn that had lasted just 10 years from 1539 to 1549 was re- absorbed into the main ducal house in Celle. The widowed duchess, Clara, had to move out of the castle rooms and take up her dowager residence at Fallersleben Castle. Thereafter Gifhorn Castle became the residence of a bailiff (Amtmann). Occasionally it was used as accommodation for the royal hunting parties of the Celle dukes, who came here in order to hunt in the great forests around Gifhorn. Nevertheless the castle was retained as a fortress, because it had a strategically important function for the Celle dukes on the southeastern flank of their dukedom. The castle was run by a castellan (Schlosshauptmann) and, from 1734, a seneschal (Landdrost). He was the fortress commander (Festungskommandant) and, from the 16th century onwards, commanded a force of armourers (Waffenmeister), B√ºchsensch√ºtzen and Landsknechten. From the time it was built the fortress withstood every attack. Enemy troops, like the Swedes, Danes, league (Ligisten) and imperial troops in the Thirty Years War and French armies in the Seven Years' War quartered themselves in the town of Gifhorn but avoided attacking the castle. The last Schlosshauptmann, Ulrich von Veltheim allowed the fortifications to be dismantled between 1770 and 1780, because it was no longer equal to technological advances of that time. The moats were reduced to half-width and entrances were constructed at the northern and southern bastions. The fortified gatehouse was converted into a grain store. From the 18th century, district administrators (Landr√§te) officiated in the castle. A fundamental renovation and redevelopment of the whole castle area took place between 1978 and 1983. Today the castle is home to the following: * Gifhorn district with the district council rooms * Great Hall Event Venue (Veranstaltungsort Rittersaal) * Gifhorn Castle History Museum with 1000 m¬≤ of exhibition area showing the development of Gifhorn from ancient times to the present * The castle restaurant * The prison (Justizvollzugsanstalt)  Sources  * J√ºrgen Conrad (Text): Schlo√ü Gifhorn.

He was born in Cianjur, West Java. In 1938 he attended an adult school in Bandung, and then became a civil servant. After the independence of Indonesia in 1945, he successively worked for National Broadcasting Station and Books Compilation & Translation Bureau. In 1959 he joined the People's Culture Association, and became a member of its central committee. He lived abroad after 1965, mainly in the Soviet Union, taught at Institute of Asian and African Countries at Moscow State University, died and was buried in Moscow. Utuy initially wrote in Sundanese, but under the Japanese rule during World War 2 he started writing in the Indonesian language. He preferred to write plays and short stories, and the protagonists in his works were always poor people. His first play Suling (1948) describes the Indonesian fight for independence. The second play Bunga Rumah Makan (1948) tell a story of a hotel waitress yearning for freedom and not willing to tender mercies. His historical novel Tambera (1948) concerns with the anti- Dutch struggle in the late 16th century and early 17th century. After the transfer of sovereignty, Utuy was quite disappointed with the social reality. His short story collection Orang-orang Sial (1951) mainly expresses tragic fate of the little people and corruption of the officialdom. The play Awal dan Mira (1952) reflected his disillusionment won him the first prize. His other plays comprise Di Langit Ada Bintang (1955), Sang Kuriang: opera dua babak (1955), Si Kabajan: komedi dua babak (1959), Tak Pernah Mendjadi Tua (1963), Manusia Kota: empat buah drama (1961) etc.  References  Bibliography  * Harry Aveling&Utuy; Tatang Sontani.

The concert was preceded by two Dutch interventions against Sweden in the Second Northern War, the first being the relief of Danzig (Gdansk) in 1656 that led to the treaty of Elbing, the second being the relief of Copenhagen in 1658. The thriving force behind the treaty was Dutch Johan De Witt, protecting Dutch interests in the Baltic Sea, and the concert agreed to have the Dutch fleet enact pressure to impose the envisioned peace terms on Denmark and Sweden. England likewise had trade interests in the Baltic Sea and was willing to protect them by force. De Witt's attempts to turn the concert into a formal alliance was only in part successful, as negotiations with France resulted in a Franco-Dutch alliance in 1662 which became important during the Second Anglo-Dutch War, but negotiations with England did not result in an alliance due to disagreements over the freedom of seas.

Description Founded in 1981, the ensemble produces an average of four mainstage productions per year, with a focus on world, West Coast, California and Los Angeles premieres, such as their world premiere of Bertolt Brecht's adaptation of The Duchess of Malfi and the Los Angeles premiere of Tony Kushner's A Bright Room Called Day, as well as Bill Robens' 2009 noir send-up, Kill Me Deadly. NOTE has earned consistent commendation from the Los Angeles press and national acclaim from such publications as American Theatre magazine, as well as many others. Early history NOTE was founded in 1981 by Kevin Carr, along with Kitty Felde, Marc Gordon, Melanie MacQueen, Heather Carr, & Ted Parks as a forum for original one-act plays (N.O.T.E. stood for ‚ÄúNew One-Act Theatre Ensemble‚Äù), and to provide an environment for new playwrights. In 1982, following a season at the Attic Theatre, NOTE opened a black-box theatre in downtown Los Angeles, where productions such as Dennis G. Turner's The White Pages and Kitty Felde's Man With No Shadow were performed. Shurtleff Twice Over, an evening of Michael Shurtleff one-acts, included the actress Anjelica Huston in a role. Extensive renovations to the space were carried out in 1985. In 1986, Janis Hashe became Artistic Director. During her tenure, NOTE produced premieres of Christi Taylor-Jones‚Äô A Horse of a Different Color and Marc Mantell's Apartments. Leaving downtown in 1987, NOTE co-produced Dyeing and Other Comedies with Camelot Productions at the Skylight Theatre in Los Feliz. As part of the 1987 Los Angeles Fringe Festival, NOTE produced Roger Gillis's All Talk and Jeff Sheppard's 2000 Fish at the Powerhouse Theatre in Santa Monica. Also produced at the Powerhouse was DJ Carlile's Carved in the Fog. Ms. Hashe was elected to NOTE's Board of Directors in 1993. Joseph Megel became Artistic Director in 1988, and NOTE co- produced deaf performing artist and mime Peter Cook's The Flying Words Project with Friends and Artists Theatre (FATE) in Los Feliz. A number of other shows were also presented at FATE, including the premiere of Grubb Graebner's Arroyo Repo and also Cheryl Slean's Palmdale, developed at NOTE's Playwright's Workshop. In 1987, Walter Koenig directed his original one-act play The Secret Life of Lily Langtree, with his wife Judy Leavitt directing her two one-acts, #1 Tech Night: Hands on Demo and #3 Encore: Long Distance Lady, all under the umbrella title Public Moments. In 1989, Doug Burch designed NOTE's theatre at 1705 N. Kenmore Avenue in Hollywood. In 1990, NOTE re-organized into an ensemble-managed company, electing a five-member Artistic and Management Boards. Early seasons in the Kenmore Avenue space included the productions of Paul Selig's Moon City, Leon Martell's Feed Them Dogs, Cheryl Slean's Swap Night, and John O‚ÄôKeefe's Mimzibim! Jon Tolins premiered his play Man That Got Away and directed Grubb Graebner's Wanted before taking his Twilight of the Gold‚Äôs to Broadway. NOTE received serious critical acclaim for its ‚Äò91‚Äì92 season, garnering numerous Drama-Logue Awards and LA Weekly Theatre Awards and Award nominations. A new direction One of NOTE's most ambitious pieces was Ken Roht's 1997 musical adaptation and production of Aristophanes' The Birds. Diane Robinson filled the entire theatre with dirt for her direction of Macbeth. Two years later, in 2000, Theatre of N.O.T.E. established a policy change, reflected in the slight alteration made to company's name: dropping the periods so that the name read simply Theatre of NOTE, publicly asserting a change in focus from one-act to full-length plays. After an evening of one- acts by resident playwright Dennis Miles, presented under the banner title For The Curious, Theatre of NOTE offered four full-length productions: Bright Room Called Day, by Tony Kushner, Touch, by Toni Press-Coffman, the eccentric and wildly poetic Monstrosity, written & directed by Christopher Kelley, and a fully orchestrated musical presentation of Peter Weiss' Marat/Sade, directed by Brad Mays, with a completely restored verse text. From there, Theatre of NOTE began offering a mix of original and classical material, all with an eye for the untried and unusual. Shakespeare's Richard III and Moliere's The Learned Ladies were scheduled in between such pieces as Clyt At Home, Fucking Wasps, Just Say No, and Fuckjoy. In 2003 Theatre of NOTE produced the Steve Morgan Haskell play titled Fucking Wasps which followed Kinsey's life from childhood until death. Matt Sesow's paintings adorned the theatre along with David Bickford playing piano live. Written and directed by Steve Morgan Haskell, Fucking Wasps received many accolades, including a Playwriting of the Year nomination from Backstage West. On November 22, 2002, Theatre of NOTE offered its inaugural presentation of the satirical holiday musical A Mulholland Christmas Carol, with book, music and lyrics by Bill Robens, under the direction of Kiff Scholl. The production garnered positive reviews, and became the most financially successful production in the theatre's history (2000's production of Marat/Sade being the previous record-holder). For the next three years NOTE remounted the production, which continued to draw huge and enthusiastic audiences. In 2006 ‚Äì and again in 2008 ‚Äì the company collaborated with Sacred Fools Theater Company, moving the show into a larger space. In 2012, the musical performed at NOTE again for its 10th anniversary production. Young Writer‚Äôs Project The Young Writer's Project is a six- year-old artistic community outreach project produced for Theatre of NOTE by Jonathan Klein. Each year four high schools are chosen to participate in a workshop-based writing experiment that culminates in the staged production of four short plays, one play representing each school. PSC The Production Selection Committee is open to all Theatre of NOTE members. NOTE accepts solicited and unsolicited scripts all year round. Each submitted play is read and receives coverage; chosen plays go on to a voiced reading at a PSC meeting. All plays are discussed and reviewed, and those with a simple majority of support go on to either NOTEworthy (their development workshop where they work with the playwrights) or NOTEwood. NOTEworthy NOTEworthy is Theatre of NOTE's staged reading series, established to foster relationships with playwrights as they develop new works. Playwrights chosen for this series are expected to attend a staged reading of their works-in- progress, read by Theatre of Note members, and participate in feedback with the cast and audience, giving the playwrights opportunities to make revisions based on this feedback. NOTEwood NOTEwood is the annual staged reading series of new plays held at Theatre of NOTE. NOTEwood is the touchstone used by the company in picking its season. All readings are curated by NOTE members, and feature actors from Theatre of NOTE ensemble. The readings are free and open to the public.

The label carries a warning about the potential for hypersensitivity reactions to edaravone, and adverse effects include bruising, gait disturbances, headache, skin inflammation, eczema, problems breathing, excess sugar in urine, and fungal skin infections. The mechanism by which edaravone might be effective is unknown. The drug is known to be an antioxidant, and oxidative stress has been hypothesized to be part of the process that kills neurons in people with ALS. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. Medical uses Edaravone is used to help people recover from stroke in Japan, and is used to treat ALS in the US and Japan. It was approved for ALS in the US in 2017 based on a small randomized controlled clinical trial with people who had early-stage ALS in Japan, who were administered the drug for 6 months; it had failed two earlier trials in people with all stages of ALS. It is given by intravenous infusion. There is no data on whether it is safe for pregnant women to take, and it is unknown if edaravone is secreted in breast milk. Adverse effects The label carries a warning about the potential for hypersensitivity reactions to edaravone. The following adverse effects in at least 2% more people given the drug than were given placebo: bruising, gait disturbances, headache, skin inflammation, eczema, problems breathing, excess sugar in urine, and fungal skin infections. Pharmacology The mechanism by which edaravone might be effective in ALS is unknown. The drug is known to be an antioxidant, and oxidative stress has been hypothesized to be part of the process that kills neurons in people with ALS. The half-life of edaravone is 4.5 to 6 hours and the half-lives of its metabolites are 2 to 3 hours. It is metabolized to a sulfate conjugate and a glucuronide conjugate, neither of which are active. It is primarily excreted in urine as the glucuronide conjugate form. History Researchers first developed the free radical scavenger edaravone in late 1980s as a treatment for stroke. The approach, introduced by Koji Abe, now at Okayama University Hospital in Japan, aimed to prevent the swelling of the brain which may occur after a stroke. It has been marketed in Japan by Mitsubishi Pharma for stroke since 2001 and is now generic. Mitsubishi Tanabe started a phase III clinical trial in ALS in 2011 in Japan and by June 2015, it had been approved for that use in Japan. The company had received Orphan Drug Designation for edaravone from the FDA and EU by 2016. In May 2017, I.V. edaravone was approved by the FDA to treat people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in the United States. The FDA approval was conditioned on Mitsubishi Tanabe completing several additional studies to clarify the risks of cancer and liver disease, among other effects of the drug. Formulation of edaravone by mouth called TW001 (mixture of the edaravone and SBE-HP-Œ≤CD ) has been under development by Treeway for ALS; as of 2015 it had successfully completed Phase I trial and had received orphan status in the US and in Europe. Society and culture The price for the drug when it launched in Japan for stroke in 2001 was set by the Japanese government at 9,931 yen/ampule. When the drug launched in Japan for ALS in 2001, the price was $35,000; the price in Japan in 2017 was $5,000, the US price at launch was around $145,000. In the US the drug was approved for all people with ALS but it was unclear at approval whether insurers would agree to pay for the drug for all people with ALS, or only people in the early stages of the disease. There are three filed trials for edaravone, demonstrating it may work in less than 5% of all ALS population. Brand names include Radicut, „É©„Ç∏„Ç´„ÉÉ„Éà, Radicava, Xavron.

The name is derived from a Latin word tegumentum or tegere, meaning \\"to cover\\". It is characteristic of flatworms including the broad groups of tapeworms and flukes. Once considered to be a non-living component, it is now known to be a dynamic cellular structure. In fact it is a living structure consisting of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and RNA. It forms the protective layer and the host-parasite interface of the worms, serving both secretory and absorptive functions.Cheng TC (1986). General Parasitology, 2nd edn. Academic Press, Division of Hardcourt Brace & Company, USA, pp. 253-2546. Structure and composition The fine structure of tegument is essentially the same in both the cestodes and trematodes. A typical tegument is 7-16 Œºm thick, with distinct layers. It is a syncytium consisting of multinucleated tissues with no distinct cell boundaries. The outer zone of the syncytium, called the \\"distal cytoplasm,\\" is lined with a plasma membrane. This plasma membrane is in turn associated with a layer of carbohydrate-containing macromolecules known as the glycocalyx, that varies in thickness from one species to another. The distal cytoplasm is connected to the inner layer called the \\"proximal cytoplasm\\", which is the \\"cellular region or cyton or perikarya\\" through cytoplasmic tubes that are composed of microtubules. The proximal cytoplasm contains nuclei, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex, mitochondria, ribosomes, glycogen deposits, and numerous vesicles. The internal most layer is bounded by a layer of connective tissue known as the \\"basal lamina\\". The basal lamina is followed by a thick layer of muscle.Bogitsh BJ, Carter CE, Oeltman TN (2005). Human Parasitology, 3rd Edition. Academic Press, pp. 177-179. A large number of important enzymes has been detected in the tegument. Glutathione S-transferase, ATP diphosphorylase, alkaline and acid phosphatases, Œ≤-glucuronidase, amino peptidase, acetylcholine esterase, phosphofructokinase, glucose transporters, serine hydrolases and several glycolytic enzymes have been detected with their biological roles.Mansour TE, mansour JM (2002). Chemotherapeutic Targets in Parasites. Cambridge University Press, UK, pp. 192-297. The external surface of tegument is associated with unique defining structures in cestodes and trematodes. In cestodes the tegument is further covered with highly specialized microvilli, called \\"microtriches\\", projecting from the outer limiting membrane of the tegument. These microtriches are fine hair-like filaments distributed throughout the surface of the body, and give the body surface a smooth and silky appearance. Since cestodes are devoid of any digestive and excretory systems, the tegument with its microtriches constitute the principal site of absorption of nutrients and elimination of waste materials. In fact the tegument highly resembles the gut of animals turned inside out.Smyth JD, McManus DP (1989). The Physiology and Biochemistry of Cestodes. Academic Press, pp. 5-8. In trematodes the tegument contains a number of invaginations or surface pits, and is externally lined with minute tubercles among which are dispersed bristle-like projections called \\"spines\\". Spines are embedded in the basal lamina and the tip is finely pointed to the external surface. They are made up of paracrystalline arrays of actin filaments. Tubercles are numerous, fairly regularly arranged, rounded protuberances. Functions The tegument is the host-parasite interface, and metabolically active body covering performing all the vital activities such as protection, absorption and secretion. The glycocalyx is responsible for inhibition of the host digestive enzymes, absorption of cations and bile salts, and enhancement of the host amylase activity. The acidic glycosaminoglycans of the glycocalyx are specific for inhibiting a number of digestive enzymes of the host. The microtriches in cestodes, and pits and spines in trematodes increase the surface area of the teguments for enhanced absorption of nutrients. In addition, they act as sensory organs for detecting the surrounding environmental cues. The capacity of the tegument to absorb exogenous materials is proportional to the number and extent of pits or microtriches and the number of mitochondria in the distal cytoplasm.Smyth JD, Halton DW (1983).

It was written in 1937 at the request of Boyd Neel, who conducted his orchestra at the premiere of the work at that year's Salzburg Festival. It was the work that brought Britten to international attention.Music Web International Background Benjamin Britten studied with Frank Bridge from 1927. In 1932 he began writing a set of variations on a theme from one of Bridge's works, as a tribute to his teacher, but he was distracted by other matters and the work went nowhere.Classical Archives In May 1937,Linn Records the organisers of the Salzburg Festival invited Boyd Neel and his orchestra to perform three works at that year's Festival, in August, only three months away. One of those works had to be a previously unperformed work by a British composer. Neel knew Britten from having conducted his film score for Love From a Stranger in 1936, so he asked him to write a new work for a string orchestra. Britten accepted the commission and immediately started work on a new set of variations on a theme by Bridge. Britten took as his theme the second of Bridge's Three Idylls for string quartet, Op. 6, No. 2.Naxos Direct The first sketch was completed in 10 days, and the work was fully scored by 12 July. He dedicated the work \\"to F.B. A tribute with affection and admiration\\". Both Bridge and Britten attended rehearsals of the work. The work was given its concert premiere, as planned, on 27 August 1937 in Salzburg. However, its broadcast premiere occurred two days earlier; it was played live on Radio Hilversum on 25 August.Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music Its British premiere took place on 5 October of the same year. Structure The work is structured as follows: * Introduction and Theme * Variation 1: Adagio * Variation 2: March * Variation 3: Romance * Variation 4: Aria Italiana * Variation 5: Bourr√©e classique * Variation 6: Wiener Waltzer * Variation 7: Moto perpetuo * Variation 8: Funeral March * Variation 9: Chant * Variation 10: Fugue and Finale Each variation is a nod to a specific quality in Bridge's personality, but reflected through the prism of Britten's own personality.Oehms Classics The Adagio represented Bridge's integrity; the March was his energy; the Romance his charm; the Aria Italiana his humour; the Bourr√©e his tradition; the Wiener Walzer his enthusiasm; the Moto perpetuo his vitality; the Funeral March his sympathy; the Chant was his reverence; the Fugue was his skill (it contains a number of references to other works by Bridge;Naxos and their mutual affection appears in the Finale. These connections were made explicit on the score Britten presented to Bridge, but they do not appear in the printed score. Britten also imitated the styles of a number of composers such as Gioachino Rossini, Maurice Ravel and Igor Stravinsky. Paul Kildea writes of the piece: > Though the theme is played in the opening section, it is done so rather > whimsically, and it is only at the end of the piece that it is spelled out > with weight and clarity.

He served as vice president and professor of philosophy at Birmingham Theological College from 1873 to 1877 and then professor of divinity at Oscott College from 1877 to 1880. A distinguished ecclesiastic, Barry gave lectures in both Great Britain and the United States during the 1890s. He was also a popular author and novelist at the start of the 20th century, whose books usually dealt with then controversial religious and social questions,Sladen, Douglas, ed. Who's Who, 1907: An Annual Biographical Dictionary. Vol. 59. London: Adam and Charles Black, 1907. (pg. 104) and is credited as the creator of the modern English Catholic novel.Kemp, Sandra, Charlotte Mitchell and David Trotter. Edwardian Fiction: An Oxford Companion. Oxford University Press, 1997. (pg. 21) Biography Oscott College William Francis Barry was born in London, England, to Irish Catholic parents (from Liscarroll, Co. Cork)Cf. Memories and Opinions (1926) on 21 April 1849. He was educated at Hammersmith Training School, Sedgeley Park School and Oscott College prior to attending the English College and the Gregorian University in Rome in 1868. Barry was seventh in honors at his matriculation at London University, and a scholar of the English College de Urbe. He also became exceptionally knowledgeable in French, German, Italian, Spanish, Gaelic, Greek, and Latin languages and literature. He studied under Cardinals Johann Baptist Franzelin, Camillo Tarquini, and Perrone while at the university, received a BC and DD and was present during the First Vatican Council and taking of Rome in 1870. In 1873, he was ordained as a Catholic priest at St. John Lateran and returned to England to teach philosophy and religious history at Birmingham (or Olton) Theological College. He also served as its vice president from 1873 to 1877 before moving on to his old alma mater as a professor of divinity at Oscott College until 1880. Three years later, Barry moved to Dorchester-on-Thames in Oxfordshire where he remained a longtime resident for over 20 years. A year or two after arriving in England, Bary also became a regular contributor to the Dublin Review and later the Contemporary Review, the Edinburgh Review, and the Nineteenth Century; he published around 70 essays in various periodicals during his lifetime. In the 1890s he was a friend of Count Stenbock, Lionel Johnson and Robert Ross. (see W.B. Yeats letters, vol.2). Barry began traveling the country, first going on mission in Wolverhampton in 1883, delivered addresses in the United States in 1893, and lectured at the Royal Institution as well as in many parts of England. In 1897, he delivered a centenary address on Burke in both London and Dublin. By the start of the 20th century, he had also published a number of popular religious and romance novels. In many of these, the themes of these books often touched upon controversial religious and social questions of the period.Fletcher, Ian, ed. The Collected Poems of Lionel Johnson. New York: Garland Publishing, 1982. (pg. 282) His first novel, The New Antigone (1887),Geddie, J. Liddell and J.C. Smith, ed. Chambers's Cyclopaedia of English Literature. Vol. 3. Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott Company, 1938. (pg. 842) included concepts involving socialism, atheism, freethought, sexual openness, and rights for women. In later novels, such as Arden Massiter (1900), a youthful English socialist becomes entangled in Italian revolutionary politics, while The Wizard's Knot (1901) criticised the Celtic Revivalism. His last novel, The Dayspring (1903), depicts a young Irishman who journeys to France to live in the Paris Commune but eventually chooses to leave for America considering it to hold a truer prospect of freedom than life in the Commune. Barry then turned to non-fiction and published a series of books on religion. These included biographies on religious figures such as Cardinal Newman and Ernest Renan, and on Catholicism in general, with his most notable works being The Papal Monarchy (1902) and Heralds of Revolt (1904). His writings about the medieval papacy were censored by his superiors. Barry also wrote a number of articles for the Catholic Encyclopedia.\\"Barry, Very Reverend Canon William Francis\\", The Catholic Encyclopedia and Its Makers, Encyclopedia Press, Incorporated, 1917, p. 10 In 1923, he was created a Notary Apostolic by Pope Pius XI. Barry wrote his autobiography, Memories and Opinions (1926), three years later. After living at Leamington for a time as rector of St. Peter's, he moved back to Oxford in 1928; he died there on 15 December 1930, at the age of 81.

It is charged with caring for the educational, pastoral, social and extracurricular needs of the undergraduate students of the Faculty of Medicine of Imperial College London,ICSMSU Constitution and is a constituent union of Imperial College Union.  History  ICSMSU was formed in 1997 by the mergers of the Students' Unions of St Mary's Hospital Medical School, Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School (formerly Charing Cross Hospital Medical School and Westminster Hospital Medical School) and the Royal Postgraduate Medical School. Rivalry was abundant before and during the years or mergers. The 1954 film Doctor in the House was reportedly based on the behaviour of the St Mary's students. Executive Committee The Union has one full-time sabbatical president, Muntaha Naeem, supported by 20 student volunteers, each covering areas such as clubs & societies, entertainments, academics, welfare, and finance. The president is also the British Medical Association ISC Chair, as well as a delegate to the United Hospitals Medgroup. There are also committee members of the Students' Union responsible for looking after students studying Medical Biosciences, which falls under the School of Medicine. Academics and Welfare The Academic Chair and three MBBS academic officers, along with the respective year representatives, look after the 6-year MBBS/BSc course and all students undertaking BSc courses. The Academic Officer for Medical Biosciences looks after needs specific to those students. ICSMSU runs a highly successful \\"Mums and Dads\\" programme which aims to match up new students with older students on the same course, in order to provide pastoral and social support and a more informal basis. Clubs and Societies There are currently over 60 student-run clubs and societies especially for the members of ICSM. Many of the bigger clubs can trace their history back to the original hospital medical schools.E. A. Heaman, St Marys: The History of a London Teaching Hospital 2003, Most of the clubs compete in the United Hospitals competitions, or send players to the combined teams. Notable clubs and societies include Imperial Medicals Rugby Club, ICSM Boat Club, ICSM Water Polo, Muslim Medics and ICSM Light Opera. Sports ICSM also has a strong sporting ethos inherited from its predecessors. It enjoys frequent success against the other London medical schools in the United Hospitals and National Association of Medics' Sports competitions and in the BUCS league. While medical students may join ICU sports clubs (and non-medical students may join the medical clubs and societies), most prefer to participate in ICSM sports teams which, depending on the sport, may compete against Imperial College or other Imperial faculty teams such as the Royal School of Mines, such as in the annual Varsity competition, which involves teams from ICSM and IC. The competition culminates in the J.P.R. Williams Cup, named after the highly successful Welsh rugby player and doctor J.P.R. Williams, who graduated from St Mary's Hospital, London in 1973, with the 1st XVs of Imperial Medicals Rugby Club and ICU Rugby playing each other in front of a 1,500 strong crowd. Sir Roger Bannister, another St Mary's Hospital Medical School alumnus gives his name to the trophy for the annual varsity athletics meet. =Boat club= ICSMBC was formed in 1997 by merging the Medical School Rowing Clubs from St Mary's Hospital, Charing Cross Hospital and Westminster Boat Club. They row out of the University of London Boat Club boat house which is situated on the River Thames in Chiswick and train at ICBC boathouse in Putney. The current captain of ICSMBC is Killian Watkins. Predominantly the Club participates in United Hospital events, and a constituent club of the United Hospital Boat Club, though they also participate in races organised through British Rowing, such as Head of the River. =Water Polo= Imperial College School of Medicine Water Polo is the water polo team of Imperial College School of Medicine Students' Union. It came about pursuant to a merger of the Charing Cross Hospital, Westminster Hospital, and St Mary's Hospital water polo clubs.  History  The club in its modern form was founded in 1997 following the merger of the St. Mary's Hospital Water Polo Club with the Charing Cross and Westminster Hospitals Water Polo Club. One notable member of the constituent St Mary's Hospital Water Polo club was nobel laureate Sir Alexander Fleming . In 2008 the club agreed a joint venture into the BUCS league with the Imperial College Swimming and Water Polo Club. This brought immediate success with the Imperial College/Medicals side being crowned Tier Two Champions in 2009/10, and thus securing promotion to the Premier Tier for the 2010/11 season. The joint BUCS team performed strongly again in the 2012/13 season finishing third in the Premier Tier.  Competitions  The club focuses its efforts on the London Universities Sports League (LUSL), formerly known as the ULU League, in which it enters a mixed gender team and plays weekly matches against other London universities. The Varsity match against the Imperial College water polo team is played annually in March.  Light Opera  The origin of the medical school's musical theatre society is a 1943 production of Gilbert and Sullivan's Trial by Jury by students at St Mary's. Despite a trend towards more modern musicals, the name was maintained during the 1997 merger to honour the society's history, which includes performances attended by then HRH Princess Elizabeth in 1945, HRH Princess Margaret in 1957, and HRH Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother in 1981. Each year, Light Opera performs its main show in December and a so-called '24-Hour Opera' in April or May, hosts multiple 'Big Chill' open mic nights, and participates in other showcases. The 24-Hour Opera is a musical chosen, planned, and auditioned without revealing the show's identity. It is announced to the cast, crew, and public on one evening and performed the next; all proceeds are donated to charity. The society maintains strong social traditions and also provides academic support for its numerous members. Events ICSMSU runs a full social calendar, including long-standing events and traditions from the original medical schools. This includes Freshers' Fortnight, Shrove Tuesday Final Year Dinner, 'Snow Ball', ICSM Summer Ball, Sports Dinner, Arts Dinner and RAG Week (with associated RAG events across the year as well). Facilities=Charing Cross Campus The main facilities for the medical students of ICSM are found in the Reynolds Building on the Charing Cross Hospital campus. Here you can find the Reynolds Bar, as well as meeting rooms, offices, two gyms, a dance studio and club storage rooms. The Students' Union office is on the ground floor. South Kensington Campus ICSM is housed in the Sir Alexander Fleming Building on the South Kensington Campus. Here ICSMSU has a suite of offices for use of the President and SU and club officers, as well as meeting rooms and a common room. Other Campuses ICSMSU are responsible for the upkeep of the student facilities on all other teaching hospital sites, including Chelsea and Westminster Hospital and St Mary's Hospital, London. Alumni 2004 saw the first set of ICSM doctors graduate, and so the ICSM Alumni Association was founded.About the ICSM Alumni Association Run by ICSMSU, the association aims to provide funding for the clubs and societies of the medical school, as well as offer support to students.

Ko·πü·πüavai (), also spelled Kotravai or Korravai, is the goddess of war and victory in the Tamil traditions. She is the mother of Murugan ‚Äì the god of war, and the wife of Shiva. She is also the mother goddess and the goddess of fertility, agriculture and hunters. In the latter form, she is sometimes referred to by other names and epithets in the Tamil tradition of South India and Sri Lanka, such as Athaaa, Mari, Suli, and Kavuri. She is among the earliest documented goddesses in the Tamil Sangam literature, and also found in later Tamil literature particularly those related to Shaivism and Shaktism. She is mentioned in the many poems in ParipƒÅ·π≠al , though the dedicated poem to her in among those that have been lost to history. She is mentioned in the Pattuppattu anthology ‚Äì the long Tamil poems dated between 300 BCE to 300 CE, including the Ne·π≠unalvƒÅ·π≠ai, Maturaikkanci, Poru·πáarƒÅ·πü·πüuppa·π≠ai, and Pa·π≠·π≠i·πâappƒÅlai.JV Chelliah (1946), Pattupattu - Ten Tamil Idylls (Tamil Verses with Englilsh Translation), Tamil University (1985 print), pp. xv‚Äìxxvi, 1‚Äì12 In the Tamil epic Silappadikaram (c. 2nd-century), she is described as the wife of Shiva, and the sister of Vishnu.\\"Kotravai was perhaps the earliest and the most widely worshipped goddess of the ancient Tamil people.\\" Tiwari (1985). Depending on the context and her fierceness, she is identified with Durga-Mahisasuramardini and Kali goddess avatars of Parvati in other parts of India. This may be the result of a fusion of regional goddesses during the ancient proto-literate era into a unified goddess version over the centuries, in the form of a pan-Hindu deity. Her name is derived from the Tamil word korram, which means \\"victory, success, bravery\\". The earliest references to Kotravai are found in the ancient Tamil grammar Tolkappiyam, considered to be the earliest work of the ancient Sangam literature. She is also seen as a mother goddess, a symbol of fertility and success in agriculture. Traditional rural communities offer the first harvest to her. As war goddess who is blood thirsty, some texts such as the Silappadikaram and Ahamnanuru mention that warrior devotees would, in a frenzy, offer their own head to the goddess. Korravai at the 7th century mandapa, Mahabalipuram. In Tamil Nadu, the blackbuck (Kalaimaan) is considered to be the vehicle of the Hindu goddess Korravai She is sometimes shown as riding a lion, as in the 7th-century Mahishasuramardini mandapa of the Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram, Tamil Nadu. Both the lion and blackbuck is shown with a standing Korravai in a rock- relief panel at the Varaha mandapam of Mahabalipuram.  See also  * Devi  Notes and references  Bibliography  * Mahalakshmi, R.

Impedance scaling for 50 Œ© working, frequency scaling is achieved by setting the line lengths to Œª/8. F. Implementation in microstrip. Commensurate line circuits are electrical circuits composed of transmission lines that are all the same length; commonly one-eighth of a wavelength. Lumped element circuits can be directly converted to distributed- element circuits of this form by the use of Richards' transformation. This transformation has a particularly simple result; inductors are replaced with transmission lines terminated in short-circuits and capacitors are replaced with lines terminated in open-circuits. Commensurate line theory is particularly useful for designing distributed-element filters for use at microwave frequencies. It is usually necessary to carry out a further transformation of the circuit using Kuroda's identities. There are several reasons for applying one of the Kuroda transformations; the principal reason is usually to eliminate series connected components. In some technologies, including the widely used microstrip, series connections are difficult or impossible to implement. The frequency response of commensurate line circuits, like all distributed-element circuits, will periodically repeat, limiting the frequency range over which they are effective. Circuits designed by the methods of Richards and Kuroda are not the most compact. Refinements to the methods of coupling elements together can produce more compact designs. Nevertheless, the commensurate line theory remains the basis for many of these more advanced filter designs. Commensurate lines Commensurate lines are transmission lines that are all the same electrical length, but not necessarily the same characteristic impedance (Z0). A commensurate line circuit is an electrical circuit composed only of commensurate lines terminated with resistors or short- and open-circuits. In 1948, Paul I. Richards published a theory of commensurate line circuits by which a passive lumped element circuit could be transformed into a distributed element circuit with precisely the same characteristics over a certain frequency range.Levy & Cohn, p. 1056 Lengths of lines in distributed-element circuits, for generality, are usually expressed in terms of the circuit's nominal operational wavelength, Œª. Lines of the prescribed length in a commensurate line circuit are called unit elements (UEs). A particularly simple relationship pertains if the UEs are Œª/8. Each element in the lumped circuit is transformed into a corresponding UE. However, Z0 of the lines must be set according to the component value in the analogous lumped circuit and this may result in values of Z0 that are not practical to implement. This is particularly a problem with printed technologies, such as microstrip, when implementing high characteristic impedances. High impedance requires narrow lines and there is a minimum size that can be printed. Very wide lines, on the other hand, allow the possibility of undesirable transverse resonant modes to form. A different length of UE, with a different Z0, may be chosen to overcome these problems.Gardner & Wickert, p. 70 Electrical length can also be expressed as the phase change between the start and the end of the line. Phase is measured in angle units. \\\\theta, the mathematical symbol for an angle variable, is used as the symbol for electrical length when expressed as an angle. In this convention Œª represents 360¬∞, or 2œÄ radians.Weik, p. 270 The advantage of using commensurate lines is that the commensurate line theory allows circuits to be synthesised from a prescribed frequency function. While any circuit using arbitrary transmission line lengths can be analysed to determine its frequency function, that circuit cannot necessarily be easily synthesised starting from the frequency function. The fundamental problem is that using more than one length generally requires more than one frequency variable. Using commensurate lines requires only one frequency variable. A well developed theory exists for synthesising lumped-element circuits from a given frequency function. Any circuit so synthesised can be converted to a commensurate line circuit using Richards' transformation and a new frequency variable.Hunter, p. 137 Richards' transformation Richards' transformation transforms the angular frequency variable, œâ, according to, : \\\\omega \\\\to \\\\tan (k \\\\omega) or, more usefully for further analysis, in terms of the complex frequency variable, s, : s \\\\to \\\\tanh (k s) :where k is an arbitrary constant related to the UE length, Œ∏, and some designer chosen reference frequency, œâc, by : k \\\\omega_c = \\\\theta. :k has units of time and is, in fact, the phase delay inserted by a UE. Comparing this transform with expressions for the driving point impedance of stubs terminated, respectively, with a short circuit and an open circuit, : \\\\begin{align} Z_\\\\mathrm{SC} &= j Z_0 \\\\tan(k \\\\omega) \\\\ Z_\\\\mathrm{OC} &= -j Z_0 \\\\cot (k \\\\omega) \\\\ \\\\end{align} it can be seen that (for Œ∏ < œÄ/2) a short circuit stub has the impedance of a lumped inductance and an open circuit stub has the impedance of a lumped capacitance. Richards' transformation substitutes inductors with short circuited UEs and capacitors with open circuited UEs. When the length is Œª/8 (or Œ∏=œÄ/4), this simplifies to, : \\\\begin{align} Z_\\\\mathrm{SC} &= j Z_0 \\\\ Z_\\\\mathrm{OC} &= -j Z_0 \\\\ \\\\end{align} This is frequently written as, : \\\\begin{align} Z_\\\\mathrm{SC} &= j L \\\\ Z_\\\\mathrm{OC} &= {1 \\\\over j C} \\\\ \\\\end{align} L and C are conventionally the symbols for inductance and capacitance, but here they represent respectively the characteristic impedance of an inductive stub and the characteristic admittance of a capacitive stub. This convention is used by numerous authors, and later in this article. Omega-domain Frequency response of a fifth order Chebyshev filter (top), and the same filter after applying Richards' transformation Richards' transformation can be viewed as transforming from a s-domain representation to a new domain called the Œ©-domain where, : \\\\Omega = \\\\tan ( k \\\\omega ) If Œ© is normalised so that Œ©=1 when œâ=œâc, then it is required that, : k \\\\omega_c = \\\\theta = {\\\\pi \\\\over 4} and the length in distance units becomes, : \\\\ell = {\\\\lambda \\\\over 8} Any circuit composed of discrete, linear, lumped components will have a transfer function H(s) that is a rational function in s. A circuit composed of transmission line UEs derived from the lumped circuit by Richards' transformation will have a transfer function H(jŒ©) that is a rational function of precisely the same form as H(s). That is, the shape of the frequency response of the lumped circuit against the s frequency variable will be precisely the same as the shape of the frequency response of the transmission line circuit against the jŒ© frequency variable and the circuit will be functionally the same. However, infinity in the Œ© domain is transformed to œâ=œÄ/4k in the s domain. The entire frequency response is squeezed down to this finite interval. Above this frequency, the same response is repeated in the same intervals, alternately in reverse. This is a consequence of the periodic nature of the tangent function. This multiple passband result is a general feature of all distributed-element circuits, not just those arrived at through Richards' transformation.Hunter, p. 140 Cascade element A UE connected in cascade is a two-port network that has no exactly corresponding circuit in lumped elements. It is functionally a fixed delay. There are lumped-element circuits that can approximate a fixed delay such as the Bessel filter, but they only work within a prescribed passband, even with ideal components. Alternatively, lumped-element all-pass filters can be constructed that pass all frequencies (with ideal components), but they have constant delay only within a narrow band of frequencies. Examples are the lattice phase equaliser and bridged T delay equaliser.Helszajn, p. 124 There is consequently no lumped circuit that Richard's transformation can transform into a cascade-connected line, and there is no reverse transformation for this element. Commensurate line theory thus introduces a new element of delay, or length. Two or more UEs connected in cascade with the same Z0 are equivalent to a single, longer, transmission line. Thus, lines of length nŒ∏ for integer n are allowable in commensurate circuits. Some circuits can be implemented entirely as a cascade of UEs: impedance matching networks, for instance, can be done this way, as can most filters. Kuroda's identities Kuroda's identities Kuroda's identities are a set of four equivalent circuits that overcome certain difficulties with applying Richards' transformations directly. The four basic transformations are shown in the figure. Here the symbols for capacitors and inductors are used to represent open-circuit and short-circuit stubs. Likewise, the symbols C and L here represent respectively the susceptance of an open circuit stub and the reactance of a short circuit stub, which, for Œ∏=Œª/8, are respectively equal to the characteristic admittance and characteristic impedance of the stub line. The boxes with thick lines represent cascade connected commensurate lengths of line with the marked characteristic impedance. The first difficulty solved is that all the UEs are required to be connected together at the same point. This arises because the lumped-element model assumes that all the elements take up zero space (or no significant space) and that there is no delay in signals between the elements. Applying Richards' transformation to convert the lumped circuit into a distributed circuit allows the element to now occupy a finite space (its length) but does not remove the requirement for zero distance between the interconnections. By repeatedly applying the first two Kuroda identities, UE lengths of the lines feeding into the ports of the circuit can be moved between the circuit components to physically separate them. A second difficulty that Kuroda's identities can overcome is that series connected lines are not always practical. While series connection of lines can easily be done in, for instance, coaxial technology, it is not possible in the widely used microstrip technology and other planar technologies. Filter circuits frequently use a ladder topology with alternating series and shunt elements. Such circuits can be converted to all shunt components in the same step used to space the components with the first two identities. The third and fourth identities allow characteristic impedances to be scaled down or up respectively. These can be useful for transforming impedances that are impractical to implement. However, they have the disadvantage of requiring the addition of an ideal transformer with a turns ratio equal to the scaling factor.Sisodia, p. 5.27 History In the decade after Richards' publication, advances in the theory of distributed circuits took place mostly in Japan. K. Kuroda published these identities in 1955 in his Ph.D thesis.Wen, p. 256 However, they did not appear in English until 1958 in a paper by Ozaki and Ishii on stripline filters.Levy & Cohn, p. 1057 Further refinements One of the major applications of commensurate line theory is to design distributed-element filters. Such filters constructed directly by Richards' and Kuroda's method are not very compact. This can be an important design consideration, especially in mobile devices. The stubs stick out to the side of the main line and the space between them is not doing anything useful. Ideally, the stubs should project on alternate sidesLee, p. 789 to prevent them coupling with each other, taking up further space, although this is not always done for space considerations. More than that, the cascade connected elements that couple together the stubs contribute nothing to the frequency function, they are only there to transform the stubs into the required impedance. Putting it another way, the order of the frequency function is determined solely by the number of stubs, not by the total number of UEs (generally speaking, the higher the order, the better the filter). More complex synthesis techniques can produce filters in which all elements are contributing. The cascade connected Œª/8 sections of the Kuroda circuits are an example of impedance transformers, the archetypical example of such circuits is the Œª/4 impedance transformer. Although this is double the length of the Œª/8 line it has the useful property that it can be transformed from a low-pass filter to a high-pass filter by replacing the open circuit stubs with short circuit stubs. The two filters are exactly matched with the same cut-off frequency and mirror-symmetrical responses. It is therefore ideal for use in diplexers.Levy & Cohn, p. 1059 The Œª/4 transformer has this property of being invariant under a low-pass to high-pass transformation because it is not just an impedance transformer, but a special case of transformer, an impedance inverter. That is, it transforms any impedance network at one port, to the inverse impedance, or dual impedance, at the other port. However, a single length of transmission line can only be precisely Œª/4 long at its resonant frequency and there is consequently a limit to the bandwidth over which it will work. There are more complex kinds of inverter circuit that more accurately invert impedances. There are two classes of inverter, the J-inverter, which transforms a shunt admittance into a series impedance, and the K-inverter which does the reverse transformation. The coefficients J and K are respectively the scaling admittance and impedance of the converter.Du & Swamy, p. 403 Stubs may be lengthened in order to change from an open circuit to a short circuit stub and vice versa.Matthaei et al., pp. 605‚Äì614 Low-pass filters usually consist of series inductors and shunt capacitors. Applying Kuroda's identities will convert these to all shunt capacitors, which are open circuit stubs. Open circuit stubs are preferred in printed technologies because they are easier to implement, and this is the technology likely to be found in consumer products. However, this is not the case in other technologies such as coaxial line, or twin-lead where the short circuit may actually be helpful for mechanical support of the structure. Short circuits also have a small advantage in that they are generally have a more precise position than open circuits. If the circuit is to be further transformed into the waveguide medium then open circuits are out of the question because there would be radiation out of the aperture so formed. For a high-pass filter the inverse applies, applying Kuroda will naturally result in short circuit stubs and it may be desirable for a printed design to convert to open circuits. As an example, a Œª/8 open circuit stub can be replaced with a 3Œª/8 short circuit stub of the same characteristic impedance without changing the circuit functionally.Poole & Darwazeh, pp. 315‚Äì316 Coupling elements together with impedance transformer lines is not the most compact design. Other methods of coupling have been developed, especially for band-pass filters that are far more compact. These include parallel lines filters, interdigital filters, hairpin filters, and the semi-lumped design combline filters.

As of 2014, its population was 4,931. Geography The municipality borders with Ablitas (in Navarre) Ag√≥n, Ainz√≥n, Alberite de San Juan, Albeta, Ambel, Bulbuente, El Buste, Fr√©scano, Magall√≥n, Malej√°n, Mall√©n, Tabuenca, Tarazona, and Vera de Moncayo. It is the administrative seat of the comarca of Campo de Borja. History The town's origins date back to the fifth century BC, because this is when a Celtiberian settlement known as Bursau or Bursao had existed near the current ruins of the castle. After the Roman conquest (first century BC) also the slopes of the hill were populated, though the town started to expand significantly only after the Muslim conquest in the eighth century AD. In the twelfth century it was conquered by the Christians from the north, and in the fifteenth/16th centuries it was converted into a military fortress against the Castillan invasions, but at the same time received much of its historical architectural heritage, with numerous churches and palaces. It received the title of \\"city\\" by King Alfonso V of Aragon in 1438. During the reign of the Catholic Monarchs, the Jews, forming an important part of the Borjan community, were expelled. The House of Borgia, which rose to prominence during the Italian Renaissance, originated in Borja and their name was a variant of the town's name. However, since at the time when they lived in Borja they were not yet especially prominent, their earlier history remains largely unknown. Borja existed through a period of recession and plagues in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It recovered economically starting from the nineteenth century, when a railway connecting the city to Cortes de Navarra was inaugurated. In the twentieth century agriculture, traditionally the mainstay of Borja's economy, started to lose its importance, and, without a consistent industrial base, the city lost economical and political importance in the area: much of the population therefore emigrated to other more developed areas. The industrial sector is intended to be boosted by businesses being attracted to the ongoing development \\"Pol√≠gono Industrial Barbalanca\\", the Barbalanca Industrial Estate.

From the latter road, here (on the northern edge of the inner part of the village), the 7528 road, which leads to the main road 74 through the Magyarszerdahely, branches off . It can also be reached by train on the Szombathely ‚Äì Nagykanizsa railway line ; √öjudvar railway station is almost 2 km from the settlement, not far from the Korpav√°r part of Nagykanizsa (on the same line the stop of Magyarszerdahely is a little closer, about 1.5 km).  History  The settlement was first mentioned in 1193 from is from Ojvduor As III. In B√©la's diploma, when compiling the estates of the Crusaders of Feh√©rv√°r. Presumably Queen Eufrozina, II. King G√©za's wife could donate to the St. Stephen's Monastery Church in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. In 1256 its name appeared in the form of Nova Curia, and in 1377 the village was named Wyoduar. According to a charter dated 1236, Johannite knights arrived in the village, where a convent was soon established. In 1325 a palatine assembly was also held in the village, the church of which was later consecrated in honor of St. John the Baptist; It was mentioned in 1350. The settlement was also a fair place, in 1329 a fair was mentioned in a diploma, until 1381 it also served as a place of authenticity. In 1382, Ujudv√°r was pledged to the sons of J√°nos Kanizsai by the Johannites , and later remained their property, although in 1453 the Vr√°na slash against the Kanizsais began a pawn change, his successor continued under King Matthias , but to no avail . Although Kanizsai family Kanizsai Francis died in 1532, the estates Kanizsai Kanizsai Orsolya fi√∫s√≠t√°ssal through the N√°dasdyakra stopovers. In a 1693 census, the village was listed as a former N√°dasdy estate, but by 1693 it became the property of the treasury. At that time the number of inhabited houses was 10, to which 60 acres of arable land and meadow belonged. The village was destroyed in Turkish times , rebuilt a little to the east during the post-destruction reconstruction. It was a serf village from the founding of √öjudvar. Most of its population was engaged in agriculture. Until 1945, he had several smallholders.
