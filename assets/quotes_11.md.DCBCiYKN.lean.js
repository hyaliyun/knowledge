It is a ‘comic account of one man’s search for meaning, identity, and a suitable response to the burden of history’. My Failed Novel Winkler was the subject of a Sky Arts documentary entitled My Failed Novel which featured Jeffrey Archer, Hanif Kureishi and various other authors. The documentary was a broader meditation on the subject of failure but focused on the novel itself, which garnered a £30,000 advance yet only sold 771 copies in hardback and 1400 in paperback. In the documentary the genesis of the novel was considered by a range of people. A contemporary critic of the book, Stephen Bayley, said the novel had a certain ‘lavatorial awfulness’ and ‘an overwhelming obsession with bums.’ Bad Sex in Fiction Award The book won a 2005 Bad Sex in Fiction Award from the Literary Review. In the words of The Guardian, “Coren beat off heavyweight competition for the prize with an unpunctuated 138-word description of coitus, followed by the two-word sentence, ‘like Zorro’.” ShortList magazine named it ‘one of the absolute worst ‘Bad Sex Awards’ entries ever. Reception  The Spectator wrote, ‘there is an infectious glee with which Coren pillories politically correct nostra and the scabrous humour and farce make him a worthy heir of Tom Sharpe’. A review by The Independent’s Michael Bywater was written with the byline, ‘Bright Spark dowsed in a swamp of disgust.’ Bywater describes the protagonist of Winkler as ‘too morally exhausted to attempt the construction of meaning for those around him. Winkler's default interaction is contempt or abuse, his disgust with the physical world - flopping flesh, sad food, corridor smells - boundless.’ He added, ‘wrapped inside Winkler's nihilism is a serious mediation on deeper matters: identity, wandering, return, and two questions which still cast the longest of shadows. What of the Holocaust, and what does it mean to be a Jew?’ The book was considered in a chapter of Ruth Gilbert’s textbook Writing Jewish: Contemporary British-Jewish Literature.

King, Earl Forest, Willie Nix, and Rosco Gordon. Initially, they weren't a formal band, but they played at the same venues and backed each other during recording sessions.  History  By 1949, Beale Street in Memphis, Tennessee, was bustling with merging blues musicians. Collectively they were referred to as the Beale Streeters. They weren't an official group, but sometimes one musician was the leader and the rest the sideman. When B.B. King performed live broadcasts at WDIA, he was backed by John Alexander (piano), and Adolph \\"Billy\\" Duncan (saxophone), and Earl Forest (drums). \\"I guess you can say this was the first little bitty B.B. King band,\\" King recalled in his autobiography. By the end of 1949, Bobby \\"Blue\\" Bland had joined the group as the vocalist and singer/guitarist/drummer Willie Nix. They performed with the house bands at local nightclubs and competed in amateur night contests at the Palace Theatre. Members of the Beale Streeters often lodged at Mitchell Hotel, owned by Sunbeam Mitchell. In 1951, Ike Turner, who was a talent scout and producer for the Bihari brothers at Modern Records, arranged for the Beale Streets to record for Modern at the local YMCA. They appeared on many of King's recordings for RPM Records, subsidiary of Modern, often Turner substituting for Alexander on piano. King's No. 1 record \\"3 O’Clock Blues,\\" led to his national tour in 1952 and Ace took over leadership of the band. Soon, Bland also left and Alexander took over vocal duties. By 1952, Alexander began recording as Johnny Ace with David James Mattis of WDIA, who was also the co-founder of Duke Records. The Beale Streeters occasionally included singer/harpist Junior Parker and vocalist/pianist Rosco Gordon. They appeared on records credited to one of its members such as Bland's \\"I.O.U. Blues\\" (1952). They also appeared on records under The Beale Streeters on Duke. Members of the Beale Streeters went on to have successful solo careers. Ace's single \\"My Song\\" topped the R&B; chart (Best Selling Retail) in 1952. Earl Forest's \\"Whoopin' And Hollerin'\\" reached No. 7 on the Billboard's R&B; chart (Most Played in Juke Boxes) in April 1953. To capitalize off of their success, the Bihari brothers issued a split single from a session in 1951. Ace's \\"Mid Night Hours Journey\\" and Forest's \\"Trouble And Me\\" was released on the subsidiary Flair Records. Ace had eight hit records in a row following \\"My Song\\" before he died in December 1954 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound while playing Russian roulette. King and Bland later toured together and released a joint albums, Together for the First Time... Live (1974) and Bobby Bland and B. B. King Together Again...Live (1976).

Helen Randall, an elderly well-to-do Southern spinster, is described sitting at her home and conversing with her niece Edith, a young woman who is engaged and soon to be married. Curious about her aunt's past, Edith asks her why she never married. Helen is visibly disheartened by the question but shows her niece a photograph of a young soldier, a keepsake she displays on the fireplace mantle in her living room. The scene then transitioned back in time to just before the war, when Helen is a teenager and is attending a women's seminary located near West Point, New York. While a student there she meets and falls in love with Charles Dalton, a cadet at the United States Military Academy. The couple's plans to marry are soon interrupted by the outbreak of war between the North and South. Helen, obeying her father, returns home while Charles remains in New York, where he is commissioned as a captain of a cavalry unit in the Union army. Meanwhile, Helen's father joins the opposing Confederate army to serve as a colonel. As the war intensifies and drags on, Helen loses touch with Charles. Her father, who is now away from their home serving at the front, is ordered by General Robert E. Lee to deliver an urgent, secret message to General \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, information that may prevent the fall of Richmond, Virginia, the Confederacy's capital, to Union forces. While skirting \\"Yankee\\" lines, Colonel Randall is seen by Union soldiers, who chase him. The desperate colonel's home happens to be nearby, so Randall rushes there with the enemy in hot pursuit. Helen and her older brother Harry are at the stately residence and are startled when their father appears. Frantic to protect him, she, unlike her cowardly brother, helps to defend him and to safeguard the message he is carrying when a unit of Union cavalry arrives.

Loyalty prevails, and she shoots and kills Charles. She then faints amid the chaos, but upon awakening she finds that Confederate soldiers had arrived to chase off the remaining Yankee troopers. Although she is hailed as a Southern heroine, Helen grieves and remains devastated by the death of the man she once planned to wed, a casualty of war that she inflicted.

He owned various establishments on the Chitlin' Circuit. Mitchell ran nightclubs for 40 years until selling off his holdings in the 1980s. In the 1940s, post- war Memphis became a hot spot for blues music. African American musicians began moving to Memphis, and established entertainers would perform and record here. During segregation, there were few venues where African Americans could perform, and fewer hotels where they could stay. In 1944, Sunbeam Mitchell opened the Mitchell Hotel which lodged well-known musicians, and soon he began operating nightclubs.  Life and career  Born in Memphis, Tennessee on November 6, 1906, Mitchell grew up on Beale Street. His father was a drayman. Mitchell worked in a factory in Detroit during World War II. In 1944, Mitchell and his wife Ernestine Mitchell (nee McKinney) leased two floors above Abe Plough's Pantaze Drug Store on Beale Street in Memphis, Tennessee. He opened the Mitchell Hotel in 1944, and shortly thereafter created his first nightclub, the Domino Lounge. In the book The Chitlin' Circuit, author Preston Lauterbach wrote, \\"Sunbeam laid the cornerstone of what came to be known as the Memphis sound.\\" In addition to his nightclubs, hotel, and grill, Mitchell operated Mitchell Amusement Enterprises in the 1950s, booking dates for musicians Little Milton and Lowell Fulson. He later created a record label, Paradise Records. Mitchell also sponsored dances at venues such as Ellis Auditorium, where Ray Charles performed in 1961. Mitchell continued running club and other establishments for forty tears. He died in August 1989..  Mitchell Hotel  Musicians who performed at his nightclub weren't allowed to stay at the whites-only hotels, so the Mitchell Hotel opened in 1944 and was billed as \\"Memphis' Leading Color Hotel.\\" His wife Ernestine, of Ernestine and Hazel's, managed the hotel which had thirty rooms, \\"gas head and modern baths.\\" Mitchell Hotel attracted famous musicians on the Chitlin' Circuit such as Nat \\"King\\" Cole, Count Bassie, Muddy Waters, and B.B. King. Mitchell and his wife Ernestine, earned a reputation among traveling musicians for their generosity. They often provided struggling musicians with food and shelter. In a 1981 interview with the Memphis Press-Scimitar, Mitchell stated, \\"All of them knew they could come to Memphis and be taken care of in those days.\\" Little Richard stayed at the Mitchell Hotel for weeks when he didn't have any money. B.B. King said, \\"Anytime you didn't have any money, or anything, you could always go get a room and a bowl of chili.\\" Singer Johnny Ace was a frequent resident. When he died in 1954, the Mitchells were left with his clothes and belongings.  Club Handy  In 1945, Mitchel opened the Domino Lounge at 195 Hernando Street. After a few years he changed the name to Club Handy. the venue was named for W.C. Handy, \\"the father of the blues.\\" It was locate on the second-floor lounge of his hotel. At Club Handy, Mitchell employed dancing girls called the Mitchellettes and a house band. The house band for Club Handy was led by Bill Harvey. Little Junior Parker, Bobby Bland, and B.B. King performed regularly at Club Handy. Elvis Presley saw Lowell fulsom perform at Club Handy in 1954. Acts such as the Five Royales, Jimmy McCracklin, Arthur Prysock stopped in for one-nighters in the late 1950s. The Ike & Tina Turner Revue performed at Club Handy in the 1960s. Photographer Ernest Withers took some of his iconic images of Memphis nightlife at Club Handy.  Club Ebony  Club Handy was originally a roller skating rink called The Hippodrome. In 1955, Mitchell purchased the venue and renamed it Club Ebony, an R&B; club located at 500 Beale Street. The club was later owned by Johnnie Currie and renamed The Hippodrome again.  Club Paradise  Mitchell operated Club Paradise from 1962 until 1985, which was the largest nightclub in Memphis. The 3,200-seat capacity venue was located at 645 E. Georgia Avenue. Bobby \\"Blue\\" Bland performed on the opening night, March 21, 1965. In 1966, the Memphis City Commission attempted to purchase the club with federal funds and convert it into a recreation center. Mitchell entered lease-to-own agreement and eventually purchased the venue. In the 1960s and 1970s, soul and funk musicians Funkadelic, Sam & Dave, O.V. Wright, Ike & Tina Turner and the Delfonics performed at Club Paradise. Mitchell also rented the club out to fraternities.

From their formal organisation as Trained Bands in 1558 until their final service as a Special Reserve unit of the Devonshire Regiment in World War I, the Militia regiments of Devonshire served in home defence in all of Britain's major wars. Devonshire Trained Bands The universal obligation to military service in the Shire levy or Posse comitatus was long established in England and its legal basis was updated by two Acts of 1557, covering musters and the maintenance of horses and armour. The county militia was now placed under the Lord Lieutenant, assisted by the Deputy Lieutenants and Justices of the Peace. The entry into force of these Acts in 1558 is seen as the starting date for the organised county militia in England. Although the militia obligation was universal, it was clearly impractical to train and equip every able-bodied man, so after 1572 the practice was to select a proportion of men for the Trained Bands, who were mustered for regular training. The men from the Hundreds of Devonshire were organised in four groups for the defence of the harbours on the north and south coasts of the county, each with a nominated officer in command, supported by 'Assistants' and 'Petty Captains'.Beckett, p. 20.Cruickshank, p. 17.Hay, pp. 11–17, 25–6, 88.Maitland, pp. 234–5, 278.Walrond, pp. 1–10. By 1577 the Devon Trained Bands were divided into three 'Divisions' (East, North and South), each with two Colonels and a number of Captains.Walrond, pp. 10–5. Later in the reign of Elizabeth I the threat of Spanish invasion led to emphasis being placed on the 17 'maritime' counties most vulnerable to invasion, and in 1584 the Devonshire Trained Bands fielded more men than any other county: assessed at 1200 'shot' (men with firearms), 800 bowmen, and 1000 'corslets' (armoured men), the county actually provided more than was required in each category, a total of 3178 men.Boynton, Appendix I. In the Armada year of 1588 the three Devonshire Divisions (each of two or three large companies, totalling 3661 men) were instructed to join the army forming to defend the South Coast of England, while 1650 able-bodied untrained men remained to defend the county.Hay, p. 91.Hay, pp. 269–71.Walrond, pp. 15–7. By 1633 the seven companies were each regarded as a regiment and, together with the companies in the main towns, amounted to almost 6750 trained men, one- third armed with pikes and two-thirds with muskets.Walrond, pp. 18–21. Although control of the militia was one of the areas of dispute between King Charles I and Parliament that led to the First English Civil War, most of the county Trained Bands played little part in the fighting. An attempt by the Royalists to call out the posse comitatus of Devonshire in 1642 was a failure (compared with their success in raising the Trained Bands in neighbouring Cornwall) and it was quickly dispersed by Parliamentarian forces.Burne & Young, p. 38. The following year the Devonshire Trained Bands loyal to Parliament refused to invade Cornwall.Becket, p. 43. Once Parliament had established full control in 1648 it passed legislation to reorganise the militia in various counties, including an Ordinance to settle the Militia of Devon on 7 June (after which the term 'Trained Band' began to disappear in most counties). Under the Commonwealth and Protectorate the militia received pay when called out, and operated alongside the New Model Army to control the country.Hay, pp. 99–104.Scott.Walrond, p. 23. After the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 the militia of Devon were called out on a number of occasions when the appearance of hostile fleets caused alarm. For example, on 15 July 1667 the Dutch fleet anchored in Plymouth Sound and all the militia of Devon and Cornwall were assembled.Walrond, p. 24. Monmouth's Rebellion Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle, Lord Lieutenant of Devon and commander of the Devon Militia 1675–85. When the Duke of Monmouth landed in Dorset to launch his Rebellion in 1685, the Lord Lieutenant of neighbouring Devon was the Duke of Albemarle. Albemarle was known to emphasise the training of his militia, which consisted of six regiments of infantry and one of cavalry; the cities of Exeter and Plymouth also had a regiment each.Walrond, pp. 25–7. Albemarle mustered the regiments at Exeter and then marched towards Dorset even before orders arrived from London to do so. Confronting the rebels at Axminster, his cavalry probed forwards. Macaulay asserted that the Devonshire men were ready to go over to Monmouth, and this caused Albemarle to retreat, which turned into a rout, the countryside strewn with abandoned weapons and uniforms.Macaulay, pp. 282–3. Macaulay has been followed uncritically by many authors, but modern historians find no evidence of this rout (although the Somerset Militia were also present at Axminster and performed poorly; some may even have deserted and joined the rebel duke). Albemarle only had orders to shadow the rebels, not to bring on a major action. He fell back to secure the west and his force's presence prevented Monmouth from accessing recruits and supplies from that direction. He then followed the rebels, re-occupying towns and garrisoning the small ports to prevent foreign aid reaching them. After the Battle of Sedgemoor the Devon Militia were active in rounding up fugitive rebels.Chandler, pp. 21, 119, 124, 175.Watson, pp. 218–9.Western, p. 56. Despite their service against Monmouth, James II stood the militia down within days of the rebellion's defeat, intending to use the local militia taxes to pay for his expanding Regular Army, which he felt he could rely upon, unlike the locally-commanded militia. The Devon Militia was ordered not to muster for training in 1687, and was not embodied when William of Orange made his landing in the West Country in 1688 (the Glorious Revolution). In July 1690 the French fleet anchored off Teignmouth after the Battle of Beachy Head, and sent a landing party to raid the town. The Devon Militia mustered, but the raiding party had re- embarked.Walrond, p. 25. The Devon Militia continued to be mustered for training during the reign of William III, notably in 1697, when the eight infantry regiments and four troops of horse in Devonshire (Six 'county' regiments and three troops, together with the Exeter and Plymouth regiments and the independent Dartmouth Company of Horse) mustered 6163 men under the command of the Earl of Stamford as Lord Lieutenant.Hay, pp. 116–7. But after the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 the militia was allowed to dwindle.Western, p. 73.Walrond, p. 27. Devon Militia 1758 Under threat of French invasion during the Seven Years' War a series of Militia Acts from 1757 re-established county militia regiments, the men being conscripted by means of parish ballots (paid substitutes were permitted) to serve for three years. Front-line Devonshire was given a quota of 1600 men to raise. There was a property qualification for officers, who were commissioned by the Lord Lieutenant. The size of the militia was increased as the war continued.Fortescue, Vol II, pp. 288, 299, 301–2, 521.Hay, pp. 136–44.Holmes, pp. 94–100.'Militia and Volunteer Lists' at Devon – Military History.Walrond, pp. 28–31.Western, Appendices A & B.Western, p. 251. Once again, the maritime counties were to the fore: the first issue of arms to the Devon Militia was made on 5 December 1758, and they were embodied on 23 June 1759. Two, later four (Exeter, North, East and South), battalions were formed in Devon under the command of the Duke of Bedford as Lord Lieutenant. They served in the West Country for the whole of their service; the duties included guarding French prisoners of war and assisting Revenue Officers in suppressing smuggling. In December 1762 the battalions were disembodied and the following year were reorganised into three peacetime regiments. The Exeter and East battalions combined to form a single regiment, the 1st or East Devon Militia, with its headquarters (HQ) at Exeter and the Duke of Bedford as its Colonel.Frederick, p. 86.H.G. Parkyn, 'English Militia Regiments 1757–1935: Their Badges and Buttons', Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, Vol 15, No 60 (Winter 1936), pp. 216–248.Walrond, pp. 31–59.Walrond, Appendix A.Western, p. 124. Sir John Prideaux, 6th Baronet, Colonel of the East Devon regiment, took legal action against the Duke of Bedford and the Deputy lieutenants for the loss of his command, and refused to give up the regimental arms and accoutrements in his care until 1764.Walrond, pp. 55–8, Appendix B. 1st or East Devon Militia The militiamen's peacetime obligation was for 28 days' annual training. This was widely neglected, but the Devonshire regiments do appear to have completed their training each year. =War of American Independence= After the outbreak of the War of American Independence in 1775 a controversial Act of Parliament was passed to 'Enable His Majesty to call out and assemble the Militia in all cases of Rebellion in any part of the Dominion belonging to the Crown of Great Britain'. In the event the militia was called out in its traditional role when Britain was threatened with invasion by the Americans' allies, France and Spain. The regiment was embodied at Exeter on 20 April 1778 and served in the West Country and Southern England. It spent the summer of 1779 at Coxheath Camp near Maidstone in Kent, which was the army's largest training camp, where the Militia were exercised as part of a division alongside Regular troops while providing a reserve in case of French invasion of South East England. In the summer of 1780 the regiment was camped at Playden Heights in Sussex, while the summers of 1781 and 1782 were spent in Devon at Roborough Camp near Plymouth, where all three Devon regiments were gathered. The Light Companies of the regiments at Roborough were formed into a composite Light Battalion, which trained separately. The Militia also had to find guards for the American prisoners of war lodged in Mill Prison in Plymouth and Stapleton Prison in Bristol. American independence was recognised in November 1782, so the East Devons were ordered to march to Exeter and disembodied on 24 March 1783.Fortescue, Vol III, pp. 173–4.Brig Charles Herbert, 'Coxheath Camp, 1778–1779', Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, Vol 45, No 183 (Autumn 1967), pp. 129–48.Walrond, pp. 59–109. =French Revolutionary War= From 1784 to 1793 the Devon Militia regiments were assembled for their annual 28 days' training, but to save money only two-thirds of the men were mustered each year. In view of the worsening international situation the Devonshire Militia was embodied for service on 22 December 1792, even though Revolutionary France did not declare war on Britain until 1 February 1793. The duty was much as before, guarding French prisoners at Bristol or Plymouth, with summer training camps or autumn manoeuvres at Roborough. In March 1798 the standing militia regiments were reinforced by men from the newly-raised Supplementary Militia, the remainder forming new regiments (such as the 4th Devon Militia formed at Exeter). However, in November 1799 the Militia was partially disembodied, together with the whole of the Supplementary Militia; the hope was that the men dismissed would join the Regular Army. In March 1801 the regiment was involved in suppressing bread riots and looting in Plymouth and the men who had been disembodied were recalled to the colours. However, a peace treaty having been agreed (the Treaty of Amiens), the 1st Devon was disembodied on 20 April.Hay, pp. 149–54.Walrond, pp. 110–203.G.H. Hennessy, 'Order Books of the 1st Devon Regiment in 1793', Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, Vol 47, No 192 (Winter 1969), pp. 215–21. =Napoleonic Wars= The Peace of Amiens did not last long, and the Militia were soon called out again. The warrant to embody the Devon and Exeter Militia was sent to the Lord Lieutenant (Earl Fortescue) on 11 March 1803, and the 1st Devon of eight companies was practically complete by 5 April.It marched to Plymouth Dock, where the garrison include all three Devon Militia regiments. The duties once again included guarding French prisoners and working on fortifications. In June the Supplementary Militia was also embodied, and the 1st Devon Militia was increased to 10 companies.Walrond, pp. 204–26. In 1805 there was a drive to induce militiamen to volunteer for the Regular Army (or the Royal Marines, in the case of men from Devon and Cornwall). The regiment served in the Portsmouth garrison and the Brighton brigade before returning to the West Country in late 1806. Another recruitment drive for men to transfer to the Line regiments was accompanied by balloting to bring the Militia up to strength, together with recruits obtained 'by beat of drum' (as in the Line) and from the Local Militia.Knight, pp. 78–80, 111.Walrond, pp. 229–57. In 1810–12 the regiment moved around Southern England. In 1812 there was an outbreak of Luddite machine-breaking and the regiment spent much of the year constantly on the move round the industrial Midlands before returning to Plymouth in 1813. The war was ended by the Treaty of Fontainebleau in 1814 and on 16 June the warrant for disembodying the Devon Militia was signed.Walrond, pp. 257–301. =Ireland= Napoleon's escape from Elba and return to power in France in 1815 meant that the Militia had to be called out once more. The regiments began recruiting for volunteers 'by beat of drum' from 25 April and the warrant for embodying the Devonshire Militia was issued on 16 June, with the 1st Devon to be embodied at Exeter on 24 July. By then the decisive Battle of Waterloo had already been fought, but the process of embodiment went on while the Regulars were away in the Army of Occupation in France. The 1st Devons served in Ireland from November to April 1816, when they returned to Plymouth and were disembodied.Walrond, pp. 301–7. =Long Peace= In 1817 an Act was passed that allowed the annual training of the Militia to be dispensed with, so although officers continued to be commissioned into the regiment and the ballot was regularly held, the selected men were rarely mustered for drill. The Devon regiments assembled for 28 days' drill in 1820, and for 21 days the following year. Training was held again in 1825 and 1831, but not again before 1852. The permanent staffs of the regiments were progressively reduced so that by 1835 each had only the adjutant, sergeant- major and six sergeants, while the long-serving men were pensioned off. In 1847 the permanent staff and pensioners of the 1st Devons were called out to assist special constables to put down food riots in Exeter.Hart's.Walrond, pp. 311–28. 2nd or North Devon Militia The regiment's HQ was at Barnstaple. Its service history was similar to the East Devons: it was embodied in May 1778 for service during War of American Independence, all of which was carried out in the southern counties of England, as was its service in the French Revolutionary War. In 1794 it was in Kent, then spent several years at Plymouth and at Roborough Camp. When the Militia was partially disembodied in 1799 the regiment provided a large contingent to the Regulars, but the colonel, Earl Fortescue, resigned in protest. Afterwards the regiment served at Portsmouth and Weymouth Camp in Dorset. In November 1801 it moved back to Plymouth and it was disembodied 19 April 1802.Walrond, Appendix C. When the Peace of Amiens broke down the regiment was re-embodied on 31 March 1803 and sent to Plymouth. It remained in the West Country until it joined the East Devons in Portsmouth in 1805, where it stayed for two years. This was followed by service in Bristol and Weymouth, then three more years in the Plymouth garrison. From 1811 to 1814 the regiment was in Gosport, and was disembodied on 30 July 1814. It served in the Plymouth garrison again during the 1815–16 embodiment, and then like the rest of the militia became moribund during the Long Peace. 3rd or South Devon Militia The regiment's HQ was at Plymouth and its service history was similar to the East Devons. It served with the other Devon regiments at Plymouth and Roborough during the War of American Independence and again in the French Revolutionary War. However, the South Devon regiment volunteered for service in Ireland and was stationed there during the Rebellion of 1798–99. During the Napoleonic Wars it mainly served in the southern and western counties, but during the Luddite disturbances of 1812 it was quartered in the Nottingham area. As with the other regiments it was disembodied in August 1814 and re-embodied during the Waterloo campaign from 17 July 1815 to 8 February 1816. 4th Devon Militia As the French invasion threat grew in 1797 the Militia was doubled in size: each county was given an additional quota of men to raise for the Supplementary Militia. In Devonshire some of these were distributed among the existing regiments while the others were formed in March 1798 into the 4th Devon Militia at Exeter under the command of Sir Bourchier Wrey, 7th Baronet. However, the whole of the Supplementary Militia was disembodied in November 1799.Walrond, pp. 153–5, 174–7. Precedence Because there was no established order of precedence among Militia regiments, they traditionally drew lots for precedence when brigaded together in camp; this became an annual ballot between the counties. The Devons had their own order of precedence, which was several times re- asserted. Then in 1833 all the individual Militia regiments were balloted for a permanent order of precedence and the Devon regiments were assigned the following numbers: * East Devon – 41 * North Devon – 15 * South Devon – 25 Normally this only affected matters such as positions on the parade ground, but it would have ramifications for the Devonshire regiments later in the century.W.Y. Baldry, 'Order of Precedence of Militia Regiments', Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, Vol 15, No 57 (Spring 1936), pp. 5–16.Walrond, pp. 119, 156, 322. Reform 1852 The Militia of the United Kingdom was reformed by the Militia Act of 1852, enacted during a period of international tension. As before, units were raised and administered on a county basis, and filled by voluntary enlistment (although conscription by means of the Militia Ballot might be used if the counties failed to meet their quotas). Training was for 56 days on enlistment, then for 21–28 days per year, during which the men received full army pay. The permanent staff was increased. Under the Act, Militia units could be embodied by Royal Proclamation for full-time home defence service in three circumstances:Dunlop, pp. 42–5.Grierson, pp. 12, 27–8.Hay, pp. 155–6.Litchfield, pp. 1–7.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 91–2, 162–3.Walrond, pp. 329–30. * 1. 'Whenever a state of war exists between Her Majesty and any foreign power'. * 2. 'In all cases of invasion or upon imminent danger thereof'. * 3. 'In all cases of rebellion or insurrection'. Under the Act, the militia establishment for Devon was fixed at two regiments of infantry and one of artillery; the North Devon regiment was converted to artillery and its HQ moved to Plymouth, while the South Devons became the 2nd Devon Militia.Army List, various dates.Walrond, pp. 331–3. 1st Devon Militia War having broken out with Russia in 1854 and an expeditionary force sent to the Crimea, the Militia were called out. The 1st Devon Militia was embodied on 18 December and served in Wales and Ireland before returning to England in June 1856 to be disembodied.Walrond, pp. 336–58. From 1858 the regiment regularly held its annual peacetime training, the recruits and non-commissioned officers having previously assembled for basic training. In November 1867 the permanent staff of the regiment were called out to help deal with bread riots in Exeter, and during the Fenian scare in 1867 the regiment posted guards over the military stores at Exeter. That year the Militia Reserve Act came into force, whereby in exchange for a bounty the militiamen could sign up for service with the Regulars in time of war. The Militia Reserve was called out in the summer of 1878 during the international crisis preceding the Congress of Berlin, the men of the 1st Devons being attached to the 1st Battalion 11th Foot at Devonport.Walrond, pp. 380–1. From 1871 the Militia were permitted to camp for their annual training, and the following year the 1st Devons carried out its first camp since 1813, and the following year took part in division-scale manoeuvres at Roborough Down. However, the unpopularity of camps led to a falling-off in recruitment and the Devon Militia regiments were each reduced by two companies in 1876.Walrond, pp. 359–79. 2nd or South Devon Militia The 2nd Devon Militia was embodied from 31 May 1854 to 10 June 1856 during the Crimean War. Unlike the other Devon units, the regiment was also embodied from 9 November 1857 to 14 May 1858 during the Indian mutiny. Thereafter the regiment carried out its annual training regularly. Devon Artillery Militia The North Devon Militia was converted into the Devon Artillery Militia in May 1853. Most of the officers transferred to the new corps, together with volunteers of sufficient physique; deficiencies in men of the correct height were made up by exchanges with the two infantry regiments. The new regiment established its HQ at Devonport.Hay, p. 201.Litchfield, p. 66.Walrond, pp. 332–4. The unit was embodied for full-time duty in home defence from January 1855 to June 1856 during the Crimean War. It volunteered for overseas service but was not accepted. Under the mobilisation scheme that appeared from 1875, the Devon Artillery's war station was in the Fortifications of Plymouth. The Artillery Militia was reorganised into 11 territorial divisions of garrison artillery on 1 April 1882, the regiments formally becoming 'brigades' of the Royal Artillery. The Devon unit became the 3rd Brigade, Western Division, RA .Spiers, Late Victorian Army, pp. 63–4. It was embodied on 9 March 1885 when an international crisis arose over the Panjdeh incident while much of the Regular Army was simultaneously engaged on the Nile Expedition, but it was stood down on 30 September 1885. The garrison artillery divisions were reduced to just three from 1 July 1889, and county titles were adopted once more, with the Plymouth unit becoming The Devon Artillery (Western Division, RA). The RA abandoned its divisional structure in 1902 and the Militia Artillery became part of the Royal Garrison Artillery, the Devonport unit becoming the Devon RGA (Militia). Devonshire Regiment The badge of the East Devon Militia, adopted by the whole of the Devonshire Regiment in 1883. Under the 'Localisation of the Forces' scheme introduced by the Cardwell Reforms of 1872, Militia infantry regiments were grouped into county brigades with their local Regular and Volunteer battalions. For the 1st and 2nd Devons this was Brigade No 34 (County of Devon) in Western District alongside the 11th Foot and the Devonshire Volunteers] The Militia were now controlled by the War Office rather than their county Lord Lieutenant, and officers' commissions were signed by the Queen.Hay, pp. 27, 158.Spiers, pp. 195–6. Army & Society, pp. 195–6.Spiers, Late Victorian Army, pp. 4, 15, 19.Walrond, p. 372. A mobilisation scheme began to appear in the Army List from December 1875. This assigned places in an order of battle to Militia units serving with Regular units in an 'Active Army' and a 'Garrison Army'. The 1st and 2nd Devon Militia were both assigned to the Garrison Army in the Plymouth defences. The Childers Reforms of 1881 took Cardwell's reforms further, and the Militia infantry regiments became integral parts of their Regular county regiment. The 11th Foot became the Devonshire Regiment of two battalions and the two Devon Militia regiments becoming the 3rd and 4th battalions. This caused some confusion: the 1833 order of precedence had been confirmed for infantry militia units in 1855, which meant that 1st Devons ranked as No 41, the 2nd Devons as No 25. The 2nd or South Devons therefore became the 3rd Battalion, Devonshire Regiment by virtue of their higher precedence, and the 1st Devons became the 4th Battalion'. However, the whole Devonshire Regiment did adopt the old East Devon Militia's cap badge and motto.Walrond, p. 384. The 4th Battalion volunteered for garrison service during the Anglo-Egyptian War of 1882, but none of the Militia were embodied. The 4th Battalion was also offered for garrison duty during the Panjdeh crisis, but was politely declined. The Devonshire Militia battalions were further reduced in 1890, to an establishment of six companies each.Walrond, pp. 377–406. Second Boer War With the bulk of the Regular Army serving in South Africa during the Second Boer War, the Militia were called out. The 4th Battalion was embodied from 11 May 1900 to 16 July 1901, serving in the garrison of the Channel Isles. The Devon Artillery Militia was also embodied from 1 May to 17 October 1900.Hay, p. 201. Special Reserve After the Boer War, the future of the Militia was called into question. There were moves to reform the Auxiliary Forces (Militia, Yeomanry and Volunteers) to take their place in the six Army Corps proposed by St John Brodrick as Secretary of State for War. However, little of Brodrick's scheme was carried out.Dunlop, pp. 131–40, 158-62.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 243–2, 254. Under the sweeping Haldane Reforms of 1908, the Militia was replaced by the Special Reserve, a semi-professional force whose role was to provide reinforcement drafts for Regular units serving overseas in wartimeDunlop, pp. 270–2.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 275–7. Under these changes, the 3rd (2nd Devon Militia) Battalion was disbanded, and the 4th (1st Devon Militia) became the 3rd (Reserve) Battalion, Devonshire Regiment on 1 April 1908. Although the Devon RGA (M) was due to transfer to the Special Reserve Royal Field Artillery it was disbanded in March 1909.Dunlop, pp. 270–2.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 275–7.Litchfield, Appendix 8. World War I and after When World War I broke out on 4 August 1914 the Special Reserve battalion was embodied at Exeter and moved to its war station at Plymouth on 8 August. It returned to Exeter on 28 August to fulfil its role of organising drafts of Special Reservists and returning Regular reservists for the 1st Battalion serving with the British Expeditionary Force. The battalion was soon overwhelmed by returning reservists and recruits flocking to enlist, and by the end of September 1914 it was three times its establishment strength. In May 1915 it moved to Devonport where it formed part of the Plymouth Garrison for the rest of the war.Conrad, 1914.James, p. 54.3rd (Special Reserve) Bn in WWI at The Keep Military Museum. Although the Supplementary Reserve (renamed Militia again in 1921) remained in existence after 1919 and a small number of officers were commissioned, the infantry militia dwindled away: by the outbreak of World War II 3rd Bn Devonshires had no officers listed. The Militia was formally disbanded in April 1953. Insignia The first pairs of Colours issued to the Devonshire Militia battalions in 1758 consisted of the Union flag for the King's Colour, and one bearing the Duke of Bedford's coat of arms for the Regimental Colour.Walrond, p. 33. The regimental badge of the 1st or East Devon Militia from the date of its formation was a heraldic castle (representing Exeter Castle) with the motto Semper fidelis (Ever faithful), allegedly to commemorate the defence of the city by the Trained Bands during the English Civil War. This badge was officially authorised by the Lord Lieutenant in 1860, and was adopted by the whole Devonshire Regiment in 1883. The badge of the North Devon Militia was a crowned garter (of the Order of the Garter) carrying the unit title and enclosing the Union Flag of 1707–1801; by 1812 the outmoded flag was replaced by a crown within the garter. The South Devon Militia used a lion rampant (derived from the coat of arms of the early Earls of Devon) within a garter inscribed with the regimental title.Walrond, pp. 362, 385–7.

His father was the Western Mail leader writer and founder member of the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), James Atkinson Walker (1878-1954).\\"Fleet Street Annual\\", 1954. Page 38, https://books.google.co.za/books?id=mTZaAAAAYAAJ&source;=gbs_navlinks_s Biography Walker started his journalistic career in the UK, living in Cardiff, London and Bristol, before emigrating to South Africa in 1937. He worked briefly for Schlesinger's Daily Express in Johannesburg, and wrote about this period in his autobiographical novel Wanton City (1949). In 1944 he was seconded to the Native Affairs Department in Pretoria, where he was assigned \\"a war-time propaganda job for the State Bureau of Information\\". After travelling extensively in South Africa accompanied by a Department official and submitting a lengthy report he heard no more of his account, probably because it was highly critical of the work of the department and government policy. Instead, he published his findings in his colourful and excoriating book \\"Kaffirs Are Lively: Being Some Backstage Impressions of the South African Democracy\\" (1949) which was well received and published in several editions.Walker Oliver. \\"Kaffirs Are Lively: Being Some Backstage Impressions of the South African Democracy\\" (London: Victor Gollancz, 1949) This was followed by a sequel \\"Kaffirs Are Livelier, White Man Boss\\" published shortly before Walker's death, in 1964. Walker continued working in journalism, joining The Star as a sub-editor and later a critic. During this period he produced his well-researched biographical account of John Dunn, \\"Proud Zulu\\" (1949), which he reconfigured in his later work \\"Zulu Royal Feather\\" (1961). Walker was fascinated with John Dunn and his final work was a biography of Dunn's son Tom, \\"The Hippo Poacher\\", published posthumously in 1967. Walker died in South Africa on Christmas Day, 1965 leaving his widow Elfreda Mary Walker (née Miller).

Background Love and Money formed in 1985 and quickly signed to Phonogram's Mercury Records. In 1986, the band released their debut single \\"Candybar Express\\" which was then followed with the album All You Need Is... Although \\"Candybar Express\\" gained some attention and reached No. 56 on the UK Singles Chart in May 1986, the album was not a commercial success. A further two singles from the album made chart entries in the UK during 1987; \\"River of People\\" reached No. 82 in February 1987 and \\"Love and Money\\" reached No. 68 in April 1987. Speaking of the album to Brian Hogg, Grant recalled in 1993: \\"I can't listen to our first record. I just don't think its very good.\\" Critical reception On its release, Billboard praised the group for its \\"strong songwriting ability and the chops to get it across\\". They added that Grant, as the group's \\"focal point\\", \\"is capable of impressing even the most casual listener\\". Bill Henderson of the Orlando Sentinel wrote: \\"The combinations of hard, punchy rhythms, psychedelic blues guitar and a '60s soul sound recall the best of that era without regurgitating it.

Unusually for a Tom and Jerry cartoon, Jerry \\"speaks\\" lengthy lines, through an inner monologue. Plot synopsis Tom is seen sitting on the train tracks, waiting for an incoming train to come and run him over, while Jerry laments at his friend's state and recalls how he ended up there. Jerry narrates that he and Tom are usually best friends, before Tom falls for a beautiful white cat named Toodles Galore, who, at first, seems to return his feelings, essentially manipulating him to her whims, before leaving him for Butch (who, unlike in other cartoons, is extremely rich), which reveals herself to be a gold digger as Jerry has had earlier suspected. Despite Jerry's protests, Tom desperately tries to buy back his love, but is continually outdone by Butch, like when he tries to present her with a flower she has had already received a beautiful horseshoe garland of roses from Butch saying \\"Love from Butch\\". Then he squanders all of his life's savings to buy a diamond ring, and when he presents it to her, she uses a giant magnifying glass to see the extremely tiny diamond on it and reveals that Butch has had already gifted her a ring with a large diamond so shiny that she and Tom don welding shields, just to see it, much to Tom's terrible shock. Tom then sells himself into slavery just to buy her an extremely old, outdated and rickety automobile, which is a car, while Butch arrives with his train like red limo, runs over and flattens Tom and his car. Tom starts drinking (milk) uncontrollably, completely ignores Jerry's pleas, and eventually nearly goes down the literal gutter, but is saved just in time by Jerry, and gets even more depressed when Butch and Toodles drive in the same limo by with a \\"JUST MARRIED\\" sign on the back, much to his and Jerry's nasty surprise. As the flashback ends, Jerry kisses a picture of his girlfriend before she drives past, having married to a rich mouse; heartbroken, Jerry meets Tom, and joins him on the tracks, just as the train whistle becomes audible as the cartoon fades out.

Reception=Critical response In Cartoon Carnival: A Critical Guide to Best Cartoons, writer Michael Samerdyke said \\"Blue Cat Blues is deeply indebted to Tex Avery for its gags.\\" Video Movie Guide: 1995 called the short (in a review for the aforementioned Festival of Fun VHS) said \\"among the worst Tom & Jerry outings\\". Legacy The short is often considered the darkest Tom and Jerry cartoon due to its subject matter and ending. Additionally, it is often confused to be the final short of the series; this is untrue, however, the final short produced at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was Tot Watchers and the final short overall was Purr-Chance to Dream (produced by Chuck Jones at Sib Tower 12).

The concept of stability for principal bundles was introduced by Annamalai Ramanathan for the purpose of defining the moduli space of G-principal bundles over a Riemann surface, a generalisation of earlier work by David Mumford and others on the moduli spaces of vector bundles.Ramanathan, A., 1975. Stable principal bundles on a compact Riemann surface. Mathematische Annalen, 213(2), pp.129-152.Ramanathan, A., 1996, August. Moduli for principal bundles over algebraic curves: I. In Proceedings of the Indian Academy of Sciences-Mathematical Sciences (Vol. 106, No. 3, pp. 301-328). Springer India.Ramanathan, A., 1996, November. Moduli for principal bundles over algebraic curves: II. In Proceedings of the Indian Academy of Sciences-Mathematical Sciences (Vol. 106, No. 4, pp. 421-449). Springer India. Many statements about the stability of vector bundles can be translated into the language of stable principal bundles. For example, the analogue of the Kobayashi–Hitchin correspondence for principal bundles, that a holomorphic principal bundle over a compact Kähler manifold admits a Hermite–Einstein connection if and only if it is polystable, was shown to be true by Boudjemâa Anchouche and Indranil Biswas.Anchouche, B. and Biswas, I., 2001. Einstein-Hermitian connections on polystable principal bundles over a compact Kähler manifold. American Journal of Mathematics, 123(2), pp.207-228. Definition The essential definition of stability for principal bundles was made by Ramanathan, but applies only to the case of Riemann surfaces. In this section we state the definition as appearing in the work of Anchouche and Biswas which is valid over any Kähler manifold, and indeed makes sense more generally for algebraic varieties. This reduces to Ramanathan's definition in the case the manifold is a Riemann surface. Let G be a connected reductive algebraic group over the complex numbers \\\\mathbb{C}. Let (X,\\\\omega) be a compact Kähler manifold of complex dimension n. Suppose P\\\\to X is a holomorphic principal G-bundle over X. Holomorphic here means that the transition functions for P vary holomorphically, which makes sense as the structure group is a complex Lie group. The principal bundle P is called stable (resp. semi-stable) if for every reduction of structure group \\\\sigma: U \\\\to P/Q for Q\\\\subset G a maximal parabolic subgroup where U\\\\subset X is some open subset with the codimension \\\\operatorname{codim}(X\\\\backslash U) \\\\ge 2, we have : \\\\deg \\\\sigma^* T_{\\\\operatorname{rel}} P/Q > 0 \\\\quad (\\\\text{resp. }\\\\ge 0). Here T_{\\\\operatorname{rel}} P/Q is the relative tangent bundle of the fibre bundle \\\\left.P/Q\\\\right_U \\\\to U otherwise known as the vertical bundle of T (\\\\left.P/Q\\\\right_U). Recall that the degree of a vector bundle (or coherent sheaf) F\\\\to X is defined to be : \\\\operatorname{deg}(F) := \\\\int_X c_1(F) \\\\wedge \\\\omega^{n-1}, where c_1(F) is the first Chern class of F. In the above setting the degree is computed for a bundle defined over U inside X, but since the codimension of the complement of U is bigger than two, the value of the integral will agree with that over all of X. Notice that in the case where \\\\dim X = 1, that is where X is a Riemann surface, by assumption on the codimension of U we must have that U=X, so it is enough to consider reductions of structure group over the entirety of X, \\\\sigma: X \\\\to P/Q. Relation to stability of vector bundles Given a principal G-bundle for a complex Lie group G there are several natural vector bundles one may associate to it. Firstly if G=\\\\operatorname{GL}(n,\\\\mathbb{C}), the general linear group, then the standard representation of \\\\operatorname{GL}(n,\\\\mathbb{C}) on \\\\mathbb{C}^n allows one to construct the associated bundle E = P \\\\times_{\\\\operatorname{GL}(n,\\\\mathbb{C})} \\\\mathbb{C}^n. This is a holomorphic vector bundle over X, and the above definition of stability of the principal bundle is equivalent to slope stability of E. The essential point is that a maximal parabolic subgroup Q\\\\subset \\\\operatorname{GL}(n,\\\\mathbb{C}) corresponds to a choice of flag 0 \\\\subset W \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{C}^n, where W is invariant under the subgroup Q. Since the structure group of P has been reduced to Q, and Q preserves the vector subspace W\\\\subset \\\\mathbb{C}^n, one may take the associated bundle F = P\\\\times_Q W, which is a sub-bundle of E over the subset U\\\\subset X on which the reduction of structure group is defined, and therefore a subsheaf of E over all of X. It can then be computed that : \\\\deg \\\\sigma^* T_{\\\\operatorname{rel}} P/Q = \\\\mu (E) - \\\\mu(F) where \\\\mu denotes the slope of the vector bundles. When the structure group is not G=\\\\operatorname{GL}(n, \\\\mathbb{C}) there is still a natural associated vector bundle to P, the adjoint bundle \\\\operatorname{ad} P, with fibre given by the Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g} of G. The principal bundle P is semistable if and only if the adjoint bundle \\\\operatorname{ad} P is slope semistable, and furthermore if P is stable, then \\\\operatorname{ad} P is slope polystable. Again the key point here is that for a parabolic subgroup Q\\\\subset G, one obtains a parabolic subalgebra \\\\mathfrak{q} \\\\subset \\\\mathfrak{g} and can take the associated subbundle. In this case more care must be taken because the adjoint representation of G on \\\\mathfrak{g} is not always faithful or irreducible, the latter condition hinting at why stability of the principal bundle only leads to polystability of the adjoint bundle (because a representation that splits as a direct sum would lead to the associated bundle splitting as a direct sum). Generalisations Just as one can generalise a vector bundle to the notion of a Higgs bundle, it is possible to formulate a definition of a principal G-Higgs bundle. The above definition of stability for principal bundles generalises to these objects by requiring the reductions of structure group are compatible with the Higgs field of the principal Higgs bundle. It was shown by Anchouche and Biswas that the analogue of the nonabelian Hodge correspondence for Higgs vector bundles is true for principal G-Higgs bundles in the case where the base manifold (X,\\\\omega) is a complex projective variety.

He belonged to the family of O'Donnell, chiefs in Tyrconnel. Biography O'Donnell was a descendant of Hugh the Dark or Aedh Dubh, called \\"the Achilles of the Gaels of Erin\\", an elder brother of Manus O'Donnell lord of Tyrconnel. His father, Terence or Turlough O'Donnell, and his mother, Johanna, also an O'Donnell, were both of the county Donegal. O'Donnell was born in 1666, and was appointed a captain of foot in King James's army 7 December 1688, and in 1689 was acting colonel. Passing into the service of France after the treaty of Limerick, he could only obtain the rank of captain in the marine regiment of the Irish Brigade. This regiment had been raised in Ireland for King James in 1689, and was commanded by Henry FitzJames, grand prior of England, a natural son of the king and brother of the Duke of Berwick. O'Donnell, whose commission was dated 4 February 1692, served with this regiment on the coast of Normandy during the projected invasion of England, which was averted by Edward Russell's victory at the naval Battle of La Hogue, and afterwards in Germany in the campaigns of 1693–1695. O'Donnell's regiment was reformed in that of Albemarle in 1698, and his commission as captain redated 27 April 1698. He served in Germany in 1701, and afterwards in five campaigns in Italy, where he was present at Luzzara, the reduction of Borgoforte, Nago, Arco, Vercelli, Ivrea, Verrua, and Chivasso, and the Battle of Cassano, and was lieutenant-colonel of the regiment at the siege and Battle of Turin. Transferred to the Low Countries in 1707, he fought against the Duke of Marlborough at the Battle of Oudenarde in 1708, succeeded Nicholas FitzGerald as colonel of a regiment 7 August 1708, and commanded the regiment of O'Donnell of the brigade in the campaigns of 1709–1712, including the Battle of Malplaquet and the defence of the Lines of Arleux, of Denain, Douai, Bouchain, and Quesnoy. He then served under Marshal Villars in Germany, at the sieges of Landau and Freiberg, and the forcing of General Vaubonne's entrenchments, which led to the peace of Rastatt between Germany and France in March 1714. In accordance with an order of 6 February 1715, the regiment of O'Donnell was reformed, one half being transferred to Colonel Francis Lee's regiment, the other half to that of Major-general Murrough O'Brien, to which O'Donnell was attached as a \\"reformed\\" or supplementary colonel. He became a brigadier-general on 1 February 1719, and retired to St. Germain-en-Laye, where he died without issue on 7 July 1735. Cathach of Columb-Cille A jewelled casket containing a Latin psalter said to have been written by the hand of St. Columba , and known as the \\"Cathach of Columb-Cille\\", belonged to Brigadier O'Donnell, and was regarded by him, in accordance with its traditional history, as a talisman of victory if carried into battle by any of the Cinel Conaill.

The blocks stand between the Oval cricket ground and the Oval Gasholders. After being occupied by one hundred squatters from 1983 until 2000 (notable residents including Ian Dury and Gillian Wearing), the buildings were sold off by Lambeth Council in the early 2000s.  Construction  The eight blocks of the Oval Mansions were built as tenement housing in the 1890s. The original inhabitants were nurses and employees at the nearby gasworks. Some of four-storey blocks overlook the Oval cricket ground, and it is possible to watch cricket from the roof. The blocks were closed in 1979 by order of the new owner, Lambeth Council, since they were becoming unsafe; they had wooden stairs and no fire escapes. The council had bought the mainly uninhabited site from the Greater London Council.  Squatted  Most of empty buildings were squatted from January 1983 onwards. Blocks 1, 3 and 4 were occupied in 1983, blocks 2 and 7 in 1984 and blocks 6 and 8 in 1985. The council having forgotten about them, the squatters renovated and repaired the apartments, living there in a community of approximately 100 people. Notable residents included the singer Ian Dury, artist Gillian Wearing and musicians Pan Sonic. Between 1988 and 1998, squatters set up and ran the City Racing art gallery in a former betting shop on the ground floor. The gallery exhibited the work of Young British Artists such as Sarah Lucas and Gillian Wearing, selling three Lucas artworks to Charles Saatchi. The community also ran a film club and tended shared gardens.  Eviction  By the late 1990s, Lambeth Council had realised the increasing monetary value of the apartments and issued eviction proceedings in 1997. The squatters were offered social housing elsewhere, which some took, but others contested the eviction process, arguing that they were entitled to adverse possession since they had lived there as a community for over twelve years. Thirty-two squatters made their case in court, and six apartments successfully gained ownership. Judge Cooke decided that another fifty-three squats had not proven their case, with one extra still in dispute. The squatters took their case to the Court of Appeal, claiming that they had acquired title by virtue of joint possession. The appeal was rejected in December 2000. By 2003, Lambeth Council had sold the majority of the Oval Mansions for million. As of 2015, a penthouse apartment could be rented for per week and in 2017, a two- bed apartment sold for .

She is also currently leading an interdisciplinary program through the University of Nairobi School of Medicine to educate physician-researchers to best implement HIV treatment and prevention methods backed by research. The program was funded by the Fogarty Training Grant which is a part of the PEPFAR funds the country of Kenya received.  Early career and education  Originally from a rural part of Kenya, Nduati has stated that her interest in medicine began at an early age when a visiting Czech doctor helped cure her case of recurring eczema after many other doctors had given up. She later went on to complete secondary school and to become a part of the first group of women at the University of Nairobi School of Medicine, which she has stated was in part due to the newly independent Kenyan government’s policy changes. She holds a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery along with a Masters in Public Health. Nduati is recognized for her work identifying and preventing mother- to-child-transmission (PMTCT) of HIV/AIDS through breastfeeding. From September 1991 to October 1994, Nduati traveled to the University of Washington to complete her Masters in Public Health in the Department of Epidemiology. The Master’s degree program was funded by the Fogarty AIDS International Training Program.  Work against HIV/AIDS  In 1994, Nduati published a case-study in collaboration with the University of Washington on one of the first identified instances of HIV transmission to an infant via ingestion of pooled breast milk or via wet-nurses, underscoring the need to screen breast milk to prevent HIV transmission.Nduati RW, John GC, Kreiss J. Postnatal transmission of HIV-1 through pooled breast milk. Lancet 1994;344:1432. Dr. Nduati continued on this path of research to publish research on the prevalence of HIV-1 infected cells in breast milk in collaboration with the University of Washington and the University of Manitoba. This 1995 research provided insight into the high level of HIV-1 infected cells and HIV-1 DNA that infants may ingest through breast milk. In 1997, she co-authored “Communicating with Adolescents about AIDS: Experience from Eastern and Southern Africa” with Wambui Kiai where she considers the impact of culture in developing and implementing effective prevention programs. Specifically, the book addresses Eastern and Southern Africa’s efforts to influence the sexual behaviors of the youth by diving into multiple factors and nuances of HIV transmission prevention programs, their successes and their shortcomings. In 2000, Nduati conducted a randomized clinical trial, testing the mortality rate and transmission rate of HIV-1 from breastfeeding versus formula feeding. The results showed that there was a significant decrease in HIV-1 mother-to-child-transmission (MTCT) in the first few months. Nduati published a follow-up research article that showed that there was a significant increase in the mortality rate of both mother and infant of the breastfeeding arm as compared to the formula feeding arm. The results published in the study contradicted against the statements made by the WHO and UNICEF in 1992 and 1997 that encouraged breastfeeding over formulas and artificial feeding.World Health Organization. \\"Global Programme on AIDS: Consensus statement from the WHO/UNICEF Consultation on HIV Transmission and Breast-feeding.\\" Weekly Epidemiological Record= Relevé épidémiologique hebdomadaire 67.24 (1992): 177-179. The 2000 and 2001 article published by Nduati had numerous implications in public policy in Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2004, Carey Farquhar and Nduati along with other researchers co-authored a research article that showed an increase in adherence to voluntary HIV-1 counseling, testing, and methods to prevent transmission of HIV-1 with partner participation in antenatal couples counseling. At the time, the presented research was in conflict with the decision to not disclose a patient’s HIV status due to patient privacy issues.Stephen Inrig, Ph.D., The African AIDS Epidemic: A History, Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences, Volume 66, Issue 1, January 2011, Pages 141–143, https://doi.org/10.1093/jhmas/jrq047 In June 2006, Nduati attended a Conference on Childhood and AIDS hosted by UNICEF in Paris, France, where she stated that a larger, united program is needed to address educational, nutritional, and psychological problems affecting children orphaned by HIV/AIDS. Dr. Nduati states, “We’re still spending a lot of time describing their status, describing what’s happening to them, and very little efforts into programs that really work… on the grand public health scale”. Later that same year in August, Nduati spoke at the XVI International AIDS Conference in Toronto, Canada, discussing the lack of adequate access to HIV treatment and care targeted towards children in Sub-Saharan Africa. Many of her research projects were utilized to supplement an internationally published report about the known information of HIV transmission through breastfeeding published in 2004 with the collaboration of UNICEF, UNAIDS, WHO, and UNFPA. Nduati has also contributed her knowledge in prevention of mother-to-child-transmission (PMTCT) of HIV by co-authoring multiple books and manuals to aid doctors in providing HIV treatment and care through organizations like UNICEF and ANECCA.Nduati, R., Laving, A., Hooker, H., & Gwatu, P.(2010).

USAID. 2006.  Current work  Nduati teaches at the University of Nairobi as a senior lecturer while also serving as an External Advisory Board member for the University of Washington’s Department of Global Health. She also currently works as the Secretary of the Network of AIDS Researchers in Eastern and Southern African (NARESA), which was funded by PEPFAR, in addition to being a member of the Scientific Secretariat of the Ghent International Working Group on Mother to Child Transmission of HIV-1. Nduati is also working to address the low rate of condom usage and its impact on HIV transmissions in teenagers, citing younger individuals’ not fully formed decision-making portions of the brain to explain the low safe-sex behaviors in this population. In the COVID-19 pandemic, Nduati is currently working as a volunteer physician at the Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi, Kenya, advocating for proper hand washing and for wearing masks to limit community spread of the COVID-19 virus.

His most well known creation is the character Ot el bruixot.  Biography  Picanyol in 2006. His professional career began during the 60s under the direction of Josep Toutain, editor-in- chief of Barcelona S.I. Artists, an agency in part responsible for the resurgence of the comic industry in Catalonia and the introduction of the Franco-Belgian school in Spain. Early in his career, Picanyol strived towards a realistic style, writing Western and adventure comics, his attempts were largely unsuccessful as he struggled to find any publisher. It was in the early 70s when he changed to a more humorous style, which would accompany him during the rest of his career. In his own words writing humor allowed him to use a more genuine, relatable and personal work. Shortly after, he began working for different magazines such as Mata Ratos and L'Infantil (later Tretzevents) generally drawing comic strips while experimenting with characters, style and tone. As his popularity grew during the 80s, he began working for more widely distributed magazines such as Lecturas in 1981 and Mussol in 1982, the later belonging to Norma Editorial. In collaboration with Editorial Barcanova and Editorial Galera he also created several children's books such as Picajocs in 1991, La Rata Sàvia series starting in 1996, L'aligot savi in 2000 and El gripau saberut in 2003. Picanyol also worked briefly on television, collaborating with the Catalan circuit of TVE2 between 1983 and 1986. His most well known partnership was with the magazine Cavall Fort, which saw the first appearance of Ot (double issue 215/216-year 1971). For more than 42 years, Ot became a staple of Cavall Fort with an uninterrupted presence for 1,500 issues until Picanyol's retirement in 2014. From the second half of 2005 until 2006 Picanyol suffered a creative crisis which made him refocus his career and begin writing an autobiography. The text was later published by Editorial Barcanova under the title Històries d'una pensió. Preus barats i plats plens. The book focuses on his experience living in his mother's pension during the 50s. In 2010 he participated in a TV3 program to provide illustrations to a videoclip for the song Puff, el drac màgic by Falsterbo. Beginning in 2019, Edicions del Pirata collected Picanyol's books for children reediting them in the series Memòria d'Elefant, from which 6 volumes have published since. During the 2010s Picanyol became interested in the Gospel and, in collaboration of writer Toni Matas, began working on La Bíblia dels nens, a comic about the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth aimed specially at children. The book was published by Barcelona Multimèdia in 2011 and quickly would proved highly successful being edited in Italy, the United States of America, Poland, France, Germany, Norway, Brazil, Portugal, Greece, Croatia, India, Australia, Netherlands, Slovenia and Russia. Consequently, it was expanded into a series and a multiplatform project involving Mobile apps. To this day five more books have been published about the Parables, Francis of Assisi, Ignatius of Loyola and the Psalms. His maturity made him focus his career on ludo-didactic content and has lead to the creation of several books such as El gran llibre de les set diferències in 2016, similar in concept to Where is Wally? with a tale attached to each drawing, and Ot el bruixot i les dites dels mesos in 2017, to teach Catalan Sayings to children. In addition, several of his early comics have been reedited in bilingual Catalan-English editions. Some examples are Ot the Wizard and the dragon, Ot the Wizard and the magic cloak and Ot the Wizard reads a story.  Characters  Statue of Ot el bruixot in Moià. In addition to Ot el Bruixot, Picanyol is credited with creating several characters across different publications and platforms. Some examples are: * Nuria y su familia i Miss Lucy (Catalan for Nuria her family and Miss Lucy), included in the magazine Lecturas. * La família Moixó (Catalan for the Moixó family), included in the magazine Catalunya Cristiana. * Les Filles del Joglar (Catalan for The Mistrel's Daughters), for the magazine Barbie. * Sopars de duro (Catalan for Nickel Suppers), for Cavall Fort. * Els mims (Catalan for The mimes). * El trobador (Catalan for The troubadour). * Alabí. * La Noemí i el pilot (Catalan for Noemi and the pilot). * L'illa perduda (Catalan for The lost island). * El doctor Pots i els seus ajudants (Catalan for The doctor Pots and his assistants). Beginning in 1996, the software company Barcelona Multimèdia created several Video games involving Ot and Noemí i el pilot, they were distributed in several CD-ROM commonly calles \\"Otijocs\\" (a Catalan portmanteau for Ot-and-games). More recently, in 2014 several of those games were ported to mobile devices along with additional educational games involving the New Testament. Also, some of his characters have been used to promote reading among children in the program Llegir per Sentir of Vilafranca del Penedès and the Book Fair of Valencia.

He is believed to be the only formerly enslaved individual to graduate from Cornell. Early years Fields was the child of Washington Fields and Martha Ann Berkley, two enslaved individuals in Virginia, and grew up on a plantation in Hanover Courthouse, Virginia. During an American Civil War skirmish in July 1863, Fields and his family escaped the plantation to Fort Monroe. Over the next decade, he intermittently pursued a public education while working various jobs as an oyster culler, hack driver, and steamboat waiter. He graduated from the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute in 1878 and headed north for full-time employment. Legal education and career Following several jobs as a waiter at resorts and servant for prominent families, Fields became employed as a butler for Alonzo B. Cornell, who served as Governor of New York from 1880 to 1882. Continuing to educate himself, Fields began reading law in preparation for a legal career. Although intending to study at Yale Law School, Cornell convinced him to enroll at Cornell University, founded by Cornell's father Ezra Cornell. In 1887, Fields enrolled in the inaugural class of Cornell Law School, graduating in 1890 and having authored a thesis titled Trial by Jury. George returned to Hampton, Virginia to practice law with his older brother. He served in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1889 to 1890 and was admitted to the Virginia State Bar in 1891. Although he lost his sight in 1896, he became a leading lawyer in the area with a large law practice of both white and Black clients, and he was active in several community organizations. Fields died at the Dixie Hospital in Hampton in 1932. Family and personal life Fields married Sarah \\"Sallie\\" Haws Baker on November 28, 1892, with whom he had two children. Their son died in infancy, but their daughter, Inez C. Fields, became the second Black woman admitted to the Massachusetts Bar and worked for William H. Lewis.

Savčić served as Minister of Construction, Mayor of Belgrade, advisor, and manager of numerous economic facilities in the Kingdom of Serbia and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. He is considered to be one of the most influential Serbs of his time. Early life and education He was born in Svilajnac, in Resava, on 26 July 1865 (Old Style) to Teodor and Jelena Savčić.Свилајнац: Добротвора заборавили али уживају („Вечерње новости“, 17. март 2016) His father was a well-to-do merchant. In his hometown, he finished both elementary school and high school, and in Belgrade, in 1885 he graduated with a B.Sc. from Grandes écoles. For his post-graduate studies, he went to Germany and enrolled at the Technical University of Munich. In 1889 he graduated from the master's program in Civil Engineering. His professor was Carl von Linde. Engineer in Munich After completing his studies, at the invitation of one of his professors, who taught roads and railways at the polytechnical institute, he remained in Germany for two more years, working on the construction of the Royal Bavarian State Railway. As a young Serbian engineer, such a job was a rare opportunity to gain a solid practice. However, as a foreign citizen, he could not become a civil servant, he could only work as a contractual employee. He first worked on the expansion of the train station in Munich. In the beginning, he was engaged in surveying the terrain, based on his recordings, other engineers made a study, then marking all the buildings and curves, and when the construction of facilities began: sewers, intersections with trams, electrical plants and a 30 km long railway, he worked as supervising engineer on the construction of one of the bridges, on which reinforced concrete arches were made for the first time. Upon completion of the work, his task was to review the entire study, which had previously been prepared by his colleagues. After that, they hired him to make an extensive and detailed study, because of which he travelled all over Bavaria, and he had assistants in the business, to whom he showed the recording and tracing of the terrain. This job brought him a lot of success and recognition. Although he was a young engineer, he worked as a senior engineer, with twice the salary, which was the reason why some of his fellow senior engineers looked down on him with envy. For a while, he worked in the department for switches, on the method of centralizing switches, according to the \\"block system\\". Return to Serbia In 1891, owing to his mother's death, he decided to leave his job at the Royal Bavarian State Railway and go back to Serbia. At that time, he was supposed to move to Paris and work for Gustave Eiffel, who gained world fame after the construction of the famous Eiffel Tower. Since the job was supposed to start in May next year, in order to use his free time, he went to serve his military service, which by law should have lasted five months or less, in case he passed the officer's exam earlier. However, he failed the practical part of the exam, where he was given the task of marking a triangle on the field, and since he solved the task in an engineering-tracer way, instead of according to military rules. As a result, he had to extend his military service and cancel his contract with Gustave Eiffel. After completing his military service, in 1893 he got a job in the Municipality of Belgrade. After a year, he decided, with the financial help of his father, uncle and brother, to start his own business, opening the Engineering and Architecture Office in Belgrade, together with a friend from Munich, the architect Gaspar Becker, in 1893. At that time, opening his own design company was a completely new initiative, which caused skepticism among family and friends. Also, the state did not have enough funds for major technical works, such as roads, railways, sewers, bridges, therefore, his firm initially devoted itself to making housing projects. In addition, private deals were concluded without complicated procedures, without fees, certificates, or cadastral plans. Larger contracts were made by ordinary letter, while smaller ones were based on oral agreements and a handshake. He was hired for his first job by Luka Ćelović, who asked him to make a plan for a private house in Karađorđeva Street in Belgrade. He was hired by rich merchants Jovan Jovanović Šapčanin and Milan Pavlović, and cassation judge Milutin Marković, all for the purpose of building private family homes. After Becker's death in 1896, he collaborated with architects Danilo Vladisavljević and Milan Kapetanović. Construction of a slaughterhouse in Belgrade One of the biggest problems in Serbia at the time was the closure of the Hungarian border for the export of live pigs, under the pretext that the pigs were allegedly infected or suspected of being infected by the disease of some sort. During 1895 alone, the border was closed three times, and a similar situation was repeated in the following years, forcing the Serbian government to begin the struggle for economic liberation from Austria-Hungary. A slaughterhouse in Belgrade of the Serbian Joint-Stock Company for Slaughter and Processing of Livestock (1906) was built according to the project of Miloš Savčić. All this was done in the fight for economic independence during the Customs War imposed on Serbia by Austria-Hungary. Everything had to be done to expedite the products in the most efficient manner. Sausages longer than a meter and thicker than a muscle, raised and clenched fists and knives, united citizens, butchers, peasants, guardsmen, workers, and in the background special wagons of the Serbian state railways transported meat in ice to their destination as quickly and efficiently as possible. The first solution was to export meat products instead of pigs, which could be exported to other countries as well as Austria-Hungary, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, etc., without the risk of spoiling the meat. For that reason, the Serbian government passed the Law on State Aid to Slaughterhouse Companies in 1895, and the newly established Serbian Joint- Stock Company for Slaughter and Processing of Livestock in Belgrade decided to hire Savčić to study the organization of slaughterhouses in Austria and Germany. During 1896, he submitted a recalculation and the following year received the right to build a slaughterhouse, which became one of the most important state projects. The opposition, led by the president of the Association of Engineers of Serbia, Todor Selešković, opposed the favouring of Savčić and his company, demanding that more experts be sent abroad. However, the slaughterhouse (later named \\"BIM Slavija\\") was built in 1898, along with the buildings for the stock exchange, post office, telegraph office, workers' apartments, smokehouses, cold storage, barns, etc., with a layout that provided for all possible extensions. which led the public to conclude that Savčić had done the job very successfully. In addition, the entire complex played a significant role in the struggle for economic independence during the Customs War, when Serbia emerged the winner. After the construction of the slaughterhouse, his public reputation and trust in his work jumped. Due to his acquired reputation, conscientious work and initiative, Savčić was considered by many institutions as an advisor, associate or direct contractor. A year later, he invested the capital acquired from this company in the shares of Belgrade Transport Bank and was elected a member of its Supervisory Board, and then the Board of Directors. The Steam-powered Sawmill Working at the slaughterhouse, he quickly became aware of Serbia's economic dependence on foreign countries, especially the import of timber construction materials from Austria-Hungary. For that reason, he considered it necessary to build a lathe (tool and dye operation), which would lower the price of this material on the domestic market. His intention was for the Belgrade Transport Bank to provide money for the construction of the lathe, but he initially encountered great resistance from the bank's Board of Directors. In 1901, he persuaded the board to allow his associates to construct Belgrade's first steam-powered sawmill. The management finally approved his proposal on the condition that Savčić accepts personal liability for any losses.Two years later, the first major steam-powered turner in the Kingdom of Serbia was built on the banks of the Danube, which was constantly expanding its capacity until the outbreak of the First World War. One of the biggest problems of the sawmill was the question of procurement cheap timber because lumber initially arrived from abroad or procured together material on the domestic market. In 1902, the bank received from the state the right to exploit the forests on Tara near the rivers Derventa, Crni Vhr and Zvijezda, and the material was brought by rafts on the Drina, Sava and Danube, to the canal that had a turner (strugar) in Belgrade. The canal in Belgrade was built to make the material easier to pull out of the rafts because, in the beginning, ox power was used to pull it out. Initially, the cutting was done manually, but later motorized machines began to be used, and over time, the machining plant was enlarged.Since the forest on Tara lay on a wasteland, on very steep slopes, intersected by gorges and gorges, it was not possible to transport the material to the Drina, Savčić, with the help of German colleagues, designed a special cable car. The cable car was built in two stages. The first stage, 6,010 m long, with a drop of 800 m, and passing through two tunnels in the rocks, 56 and 26 m long, was built in 1908. Tunnelling is done in winter, and construction materials for the building lift are transported from Belgrade by wagon, sled and on foot. There is a distance of 400 m between the small and the large tunnel above the Drina valley. The second stage, 3,860 m long, was a 380 m ascent. The speed of the load moving by the cable car was regulated by a hydraulic brake regulator, and the load was moving due to its own weight without driving force. Section for the exploitation of forests in the Tara and the way the material was brought cited as an example of rational overcoming natural obstacles. The Turning operation in Belgrade became one of the most successful wood processing companies in the country and employed between 120 and 280 workers. [19] Thanks to it, Serbia became an exporter of timber instead of an importer of timber. Insurance company \\"Serbia\\" In 1903, he became vice-president of the Belgrade Transport Bank, and two years later the bank changed its name to Prometna Banka. There Savčić urged the board members of the bank to create its own construction department. Once established (1906), it had acquired a small fleet of river dredges by 1909. They provided sand and gravel for the construction industry.One of the bank's shareholders became King Peter I Karađorđević. At the idea of King Peter I, in 1905, through the Board of Directors of Prometna Banka, \\"'Serbia', the first Serbian insurance company\\" was opened, ie the first insurance company in Serbia (except for the insurance department of the Belgrade Cooperative, which already existed). Shares with the ordinal number from 1 to 300 were also bought by King Peter I, which helped the idea of realizing such a society. From the very beginning, Savčić was in the management of that company and actively managed its affairs. In a very short period of time, the company gained a large response from citizens from all walks of life, so that at the end of the first balance the company could already write off excise costs and make an immediate profit. Since 1908, the so-called national insurance, for small sums, so that it was accessible to everyone, even the poorest citizens. Even before the Balkan Wars}}, the company had a contract with the State Railways. Despite all the difficulties, the insurance company managed to survive by paying regular and war damages. After the Balkan Wars, the company expanded its activities to Southern Serbia, and after the First World War to the whole of Yugoslavia, opening offices throughout the country, where there was a greater response, branching out into all types of insurance. Vračar Savings Bank In 1904, the shareholders of Vračarska štedionica elected him a member of the Management Board. Shortly after that, the savings bank received the right from the state to exploit Rbarska Spa (Ribarska Banja), for which Savčić prepared a situation, levelling and regulation plan. The spa was completely modernized. All works in the spa were done according to his instructions.In the same year, the villa \\"Srbija\\" was built, in which King Peter I was a frequent guest in the summer. The following year, the villa \\"Bosna\\" was built, with 39 rooms on the first floor, while the offices of the spa administration and the doctor's office were located on the ground floor, along with a pharmacy, post office, and various shops. In the same year, 1905, villas \\"Herzegovina\\", \\"Dalmatia\\", \\"Slavonia\\", \\"Old Serbia\\" were built, and in 1907, villa \\"Montenegro\\". In addition to these villas, there was a building with 10 rooms for lower class accommodation, as well as a building with 20 rooms for free accommodation for the poor. The spa became one of the most beautiful spas and resorts of that time. Other pre- war projects Thanks to Savčić's skilful management, in 1909 the bank expanded its business to include shipping and river transport of sand and gravel, which were in great demand in the construction industry. First, two wooden boats were procured, and later ships, trucks, tugboats, an excavator and an elevator, which were used to transport and unload sand, gravel, as well as timber, which arrived from Tara. In the same year, the Glass Factory in Kostolac was founded. In that period, Savčić also became the vice-president of the Board of Directors of the Privileged Export Bank, which in 1911 founded the Company for Technical Enterprises with Prometna bank, during which time Savčević became its technical director. At the public auction, the company was entrusted with the construction of the Niš-Knjaževac railway in a length of 60 km, with 39 tunnels and 20 bridges. Construction was interrupted during the Balkan Wars, and continued in 1915 at a forced pace, due to its strategic importance, in order to connect Niš with the Danube. Due to the importance of the railway, the works were visited by various politicians, including Prince Regent Alexander. Some 1200 m of the Gramad tunnel was breached, and about 5-6 thousand prisoners of war took part in the works. About 90% of the planned works were completed that year alone. During the construction of the railway, rich deposits of coal were found at the foot of Mount Tresibaba. From 1909 to 1915, only tests were carried out, and in 1915 Savčić received a privilege from the state to exploit 150 ore fields in that territory, which had to be postponed due to the war and the undeveloped railway. During the occupation, mine Tresibaba was exploited by the Bulgarians, and later the Germans. Until the construction of the railway, coal was transported by bullock carts. World War I Before the First World War, during the prosecution of the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum, he was in Munich. On the eve of the declaration of war, he moved from Germany to Switzerland, so as not to be detained or interned. From there, he returned to Serbia and immediately placed himself at the disposal of the army, which instructed him to complete the construction of the Niš-Knjaževac railway. {sfnСпоменица1939p=102}} He was one of the thousands who in late 1915 joined the Serbian retreat through Albanian mountains together with the entire Serbian army, including King Peter I and his cabinet. In 1916, he found himself in Geneva, where together with Jovan Cvijić and professor Tihomir Đorđević the Central Committee for Serbian Reconstruction was established,aimed to collect donations among Serbian allies and friends of the Serbian people as first aid at the time of liberation. He also participated in the founding of the League of Nations. He is the author of several professional papers. Together with Milić Radovanović and Ljubomir Jovanović, he wrote the following works during the war : * \\"Wealth of Serbia\\" * \\"War damage and reparations\\" * \\"Future economic program of Serbia\\" * \\"Serbia in terms of the property before, during and after the world war 1914-1918\\" Post-war period During the war, the installations and inventory on Tara were looted and taken away. The steam turner in Belgrade was destroyed in the fire, and the fleet and ships were partly destroyed by enemy artillery from the monitor, while the other part was taken to the upper course of the Danube. The glass factory in Kostolac was destroyed by the enemy so that no foundations remained. The new Privredna bank building was significantly damaged by enemy artillery. After the war and the deaths of Mihailo Popović and Nikola Spasić, Savčić became the President of the Board of Directors of Prometna Banka, from which, with the help of the bank's director Mihailo Dragičević, he created one of the most successful commercial banks in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. He invested maximum efforts in the reconstruction so that the bank and all business companies could continue with normal work after only a year. The lathe operations in Belgrade were expanded, and a three- storey house for workers' apartments was built next to it, as well as a connecting railway track to the railway of the social railway for loading wagons. It was done in two or three shifts. The turner operation employed about 300 workers and 20 clerks. Considering that after the war, during the payment of war damages, the allies did nothing to return the vessels that the enemy stole and took away from the fleet in Belgrade, new ships, excavators, elevators, etc. were procured and a new workshop was built on the Sava River coast. In 1921, the Association of Banks was founded on the premises of Prometna Banka. One of the main goals of this association was the joint appearance of Serbian banks during the nationalization of the Beocin Cement Factory and the Sartid Society (founded in 1913) through the purchase of a number of shares, as well as the establishment of new banks in the liberated territories. He was vice-president and a member of the Board of Directors of the Beocin Cement Factory and the Sartid Company, as well as many other companies. After the First World War, two banks, Izvozna and Prometna, formed a joint bank in Skopje called Izvozna i prometna banka a.d., in order to expand the joint scope of work on the territory of Old Serbia. Fuel Exploitation Company In 1920, the management of Prometna Banka founded the Fuel Exploitation Society. After the completion of the Niš-Knjaževac railway in 1921, the exploitation of ore fields in that territory, found before the war, began. In 1930, Prometna Banka took over from Đorđe Vajfert the privilege over the mines Podvis (north of Timok and Tresibaba) and Blagovesti, in which over 800 miners and officials worked. The Tresibab and Podvis mines had their own power plant, with three locomotives of 125, 205 and 325 horsepower, with three corresponding 380 V generators. Modern machine cranes of 100 hp each were installed above the mine shafts. Ventilation in the mines was artificial, with separate air shafts, over which fans were placed to pump \\"spoiled\\" air. Air compacted by compressors under a pressure of six atmospheres was used to operate pneumatic hammers - drills. The mines also had the necessary workshops: blacksmith, locksmith, carpenter, electrician. More than 40 engines of various heights were installed at the entire mine plant. Special attention was paid to providing the best possible working conditions. A large colony for free housing for workers and their families was built to house staff and workers. Other workers were recruited from surrounding villages. Families and workers had the right to free heating, electricity, they had at their disposal a warehouse with groceries, in which they bought below market prices. There was an ambulance with a pharmacy run by a local doctor. In addition to the apartments, the workers also had some land for gardens. The children at the Podvis mine attended a state primary school, the construction of which was financed by the Fuel Exploitation Society with all the necessary inverters.There was a football club at the Podvis mine, as well as a 15-member music orchestra. In 1938, a large building for a mining home was built on Tresibaba, which housed a canteen. In the same building, the Sokol Society also had its premises: large falconry with a stage and equipment for rehearsals and performances, a locker room with showers with hot and cold water, a department for the theatre section, a reading room and a library. The members of the Sokol Society were almost all the employees of the mine. Sound recording equipment was installed in the home. The mines had a modern rescue station, with 10 Dreger apparatus and 40 very well-trained members. In 1921, a consortium was established, which bought mining fields from Petar Vujan for the exploitation of the Kosovo ore basin, and research began on the right bank of the Sitnica, near Crkvena Vodice. The following year, the Mining and Industrial Joint-Stock Company \\"Kosovo\\" was founded in Kosovska Mitrovica and exploitation began, and in 1923, works for more economical exploitation and easier transport from the lignite mine \\"Kosovo\\" to the railway station in Obilić began. Savčić, who performed the function of the president of the joint-stock company, had the greatest merits for the progress in the development of the \\"Kosovo\\" mine. In the first years, exploitation was small, due to the very poorly developed industry in Southern Serbia. After the joint- stock company passed into the hands of Prometna Banka, the mine began to prosper, and production and consumption increased, especially with the development of industry in Skopje. After the opening of the Trepča mine in 1930, the Kosovo mine gained a permanent consumer,because the Trepča power plants used lignite from the Kosovo mine. A primitive cable car was built, with one rope, 2,925 m long and a drop of 25 m, with a loading station in the mine, and unloading at the railway station. The cable car could carry wagons of 500 kilograms. A power plant with locomotives was built and a special machine for extracting coal from the mine was constructed. Due to the increase in the number of staff, a workers' colony of 10 buildings were built in the period 1936-1938, as well as 9 new office buildings and a busy building. The buildings had electric lighting and plumbing. A workshop for repairing machines and other inventory was opened, and due to increased coal exports, another mining shaft called \\"Alexander\\" was opened in 1938. Thanks to the investments of Privredna Banka, in the period 1930-1938, the \\"Kosovo\\" mine quadrupled its production, which enabled the electrification of Southern Serbia. Turner in Bosanska Jagodina In 1927, a lathe was opened in Jagodina, near Višegrad, after Prometna Banka bought a forest in Zaovljanske Kosi from private individuals in 1921 and 1922. The detailed project, with all the side installations for the turner, was made by Savčić himself, although at that time he already had sons, engineers, and dozens of experts, cartoonists and engineers who worked for the companies he founded. For the needs of transporting wood, the same as on Tara, a wire railway was built, 8,200 m long and with a drop of 360 m. Material from the dismantled cable car on Tara was partly used for its construction. The planed timber was transported to Belgrade by rafts across the Rzava, the Drina, Sava and Danube. Strugara (as Serbs call turner) started operating in 1928 and was the only place of employment for poor peasants in the region. Career in Politics In 1905, Savčić was one of the founders of the new Independent Radical Party. In the period 1905-1911, and in 1923 he was a People's Deputy, as a member of the glavni odbor (Main Board) of the Independent Democratic Party,Милош Савчић, инжињер, кандидат Самосталне демократске странке and in the period 1908-1909. Minister of Construction.name=poreklo The function of the President of the Belgrade municipality performed in the period 1929-1930. At that time, the Municipal Savings Bank and the power plant were established.name=poreklo After the enforcement of the Sixth of January dictatorship (1929), the king dissolved the municipal administration by decree in 1926 and appointed Miloš Savčić mayor of Belgrade.Savčić was a supporter of King Alexander \\"with whom he had close relations in the past\\" during his reconstruction project days. As the mayor has significantly increased the efficiency of the utilities of the city. He compiled travel books for hotels. Under his administration, the Statute was adopted, which regulated the issue of municipal officials. He also worked on the already started modern paving of Belgrade, for which he prepared a program and all the necessary studies. A new way of charging for electric lighting and water has been introduced, which has enabled municipal self- financing. The Savings Bank of the Municipality of the City of Belgrade was also established with the aim of receiving revenues and paying the costs of the municipality. As the executor of Nikola Spasić's will, the construction of the City Hospital in Belgrade began. A new, modern elementary school \\"King Alexander I\\" was built in Dečanska Street. His greatest merit in the function of the mayor is having liberated the city of unfavourable short-term loan, which is due to penalty interest threatened to quell the capital. The problem is solved by taking a new loan from Swiss banks, which the previous loan fully paid, and there is also a new power station in Belgrade. Because of this endeavour, he was severely attacked, \\"Време\\", 12. јул 1936 and even sued in court on suspicion of financially damaging the Belgrade municipality, but the court found that the entire procedure for the construction of the power plant was done according to the law. The intertwining of political and economic functions was not uncommon at the time, but in the case of Miloš Savčić it aroused the suspicion of the Serbian public. The next municipal administration in Belgrade, headed by Milan Nešić, was also appointed by decree on 23 May 1930. Wagon factory At a public auction, Privredna Banka bought the Wagon and Iron Structures Factory in Kruševac (later \\"October 14\\" ), of which it was previously a creditor, and which immediately before that went bankrupt. The factory was fundamentally reconstructed and modernized within a year, and jobs were provided for it at the State Railways, in the production of new wagons and iron railway bridges. This investment was the only one in which the money invested was not recouped, and the factory operated at a loss until World War II. He made a plan for the railway bridge on the Morava. Under his supervision, concrete pillars were erected in the riverbed and a metal structure was made, which the Germans delivered to Svilajnac before the war, and then taken away by the Bulgarians during the Great War. Other projects He is mentioned as the director of the State Railways in 1920-1921. He successfully designed industrial and residential-commercial buildings, mostly designed in the style of academism, with elements of Art Nouveau. He also distinguished himself as a constructor of corner palaces, the Class Lottery (projects together with Milan Kapetanović), on the corner of Vasa Čarapića and Kneginja Ljubica streets (1898—1899) , the House of Vračar Savings Bank, according to the project of architect Danilo Vladisavljević, on the corner of Kneza Miloša Street and Kralj Milan (1906) and two houses of his own. According to his project, Prometna Banka also founded its last interwar company, the sheet metal rolling mill in Zemun. When it was built in 1938, it was a very lucrative business venture and the crowning achievement of Prometna banka and the Serbian economy. Acknowledgments He is the holder of the Order of Saint Sava I degree, the Yugoslav Crown II degree, the White Eagle IV degree and the Cross of the Red Cross Society in Geneva. Recognition for the entire activity in the field of economy and construction was given to him at the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of his work, held on 21 October 1939, in the House of the Transport Bank. On the occasion of the celebration, a monument entitled \\"50 years of work of engineer Miloš Savčić 1889-1939\\" was published. The celebrant received a silver plaque with his portrait, the work of sculptor Dragomir Arambašić, and copies of the plaque were cast in bronze and placed on marble slabs at the House and buildings of the banking companies. He died on 9 March 1941, after a long illness, just before the start of World War II. He was buried the next day in the Novo Groblje (New Cemetery) in Belgrade. A good part of what was built was destroyed during the war and after the war, all companies that established the Traffic Bank were transferred to state ownership by the communists who came into power, thanks to the Superpowers. On the eve of his death, he bequeathed his valuable property, three hectares of land and a share in two mills, to the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Nicholas in Svilajnac, of which, together with his wife, he was one of the largest donors. The material on his activity is partially catalogued in the Archives of Serbia and in the Historical Archives of Belgrade, and his professional opus was researched in detail in the 1990s when a radical reaffirmation of his creative personality was initiated. In 2004, a street in the municipality of Savski Venac was named after him. Family He had a brother Jakov and a sister Ljubica. He was married to Katinka, born Leve in Munich in 1874, whom he met while studying. They had sons: architects Milenko (1901–1954) and Svetozar (1903), engineers Ljubiša and Vladeta (1899) and a daughter Jelica (–1936), married to civil engineer Aleksandar Acović. He had his office in a residential and business multi- storey building at Topličin venac 14 Street. During that upgrade, he was the first in Serbia to apply the Herbst (1921) mezzanine prefabricated reinforced concrete structural system on that building. The system consisted of concrete girders in the form of shorter or longer flat beams (post), which are brought to the building ready-made and laid at a distance of 33 cm upright. Through them are uniformly and continuously concreted svodići to plating of tin plate. He renamed his office the Technical Company \\"Labor\\", which was taken over by his son Vladeta and son-in-law Aleksandar Acović. His family was among the largest shareholders of Agrarna, Vračarska and Izvozna Banka. Prometna Banka had consolidated all the family property. They bought vineyards and turned them into a prestigious residential area in Dedinje. The construction of the luxury villa complex was started by Miloš Savčić, and continued by his son-in- law Aleksandar Acović. At the beginning of the 1920s, he decided to build the largest and most representative habitat in the prestigious city location, in which he lived for the rest of his life. The building was built from 1924 to 1926, on the corner of Kralj Milan Street and Andrićev venac (then Dobrinjska Street). He determined the spatial organization and dimensions of his own building by applying a system with Herbst girders for mezzanine structures, and the façade assembly, composed of three unequal segments, was designed by Evgenije Gulin, a Russian civil engineer living in exile in Serbia. During the German occupation, Katinka's wife, although of German origin, refused to cooperate with the Germans, so she was thrown out of the family palace in the city center together with the children and their families. They welcomed the end of the war in vineyard cottages in Dedinje. After the liberation, they were expelled from Dedinje as representatives of the defeated bourgeoisie and their entire property was confiscated. One of Miloš Savčić's great- grandchildren is Vladimir Lešić, a famous musician. The house at Užička 15, where his daughter Jelica lived, later became the residence of Josip Broz Tito and then Slobodan Milošević, and a House of Flowers was built nearby on their former estate.Нећемо Кућу цвећа у свом дворишту („Вечерње новости“, 27 May 2013) All this added insult to injury for the surviving family of Miloš Savčić.

On September 22, 2020 the bill passed the House by 406-3 vote. Background=Xinjiang Between 2014 and 2018, the cotton industry in Xinjiang saw a massive increase in output and employment. =Allegations of forced labor= Xinjiang Genocide Products! Also don't attack our Chinese neighbors. Just say no to xenophobia and racism!\\" According to an August 2019 book by Han Lianchao, Vice President of Citizen Power Initiatives for China, forced labor is so commonplace in Xinjiang that it is difficult to separate the forced labor economy from the regular economy. Han estimates that there are 500,000 to 800,000 people held in the more than seventy prisons in Xinjiang and that these prisoners are used for forced labor in numerous industries. Han further suspects that the million Uyghurs in the Xinjiang re-education camps are likely also used for forced labor in a similar manner. Han says that because Xinjiang supplies nearly 84 percent of China's cotton, any cotton, textile or garment products from China are likely tainted with forced labor. Han's study concludes that products of this forced labor system have entered into international commerce, including the US and Europe, and that governments, companies and consumers should assume that any cotton products sourced from China are the product of forced labor in Xinjiang (XUAR). The report recommended banning certain imports from Xinjiang to the United States. In September 2019, Nury Turkel, an Uyghur American lawyer and human rights advocate, testified to Congress that Uyghurs were being swept into a vast system of forced labor. Turkel said persons in the Xinjiang re-education camps are often moved to factories and recommended bans on cotton and textile products from Xinjiang until internment policies are abolished and conditions for due diligence are established. In November 2019, Nathan Ruser, researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute said, \\"You can't be sure that you don't have coerced labour in your supply chain if you do cotton business in China ... Xinjiang labour and what is almost certainly coerced labour is very deeply entrenched into the supply chain that exists in Xinjiang.\\" According to an August 2020 piece in The New York Times, it was estimated that roughly one in five cotton garments sold globally contains cotton or yarn from Xinjiang. It also reported that investigations by The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Axios found evidence connecting the detention of Uyghurs to supply chains of major fashion retailers. On September 17, 2020, China's State Council Information Office rejected claims of forced labor in Xinjiang, saying that ideologically biased international forces have applied double standards to Xinjiang and denied recognition of local efforts to protect human rights. Existing legislation and bans Since 1930, all goods made with forced labor have been banned in the United States under the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act. Under current rules, goods are banned if there is reasonable evidence of forced labor in the creation of the goods. On September 14, 2020, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security blocked imports of products from four entities in Xinjiang: all products made with labor from the Lop County No. 4 Vocational Skills Education and Training Center; hair products made in the Lop County Hair Product Industrial Park; apparel produced by Yili Zhuowan Garment Manufacturing Co., Ltd. and Baoding LYSZD Trade and Business Co., Ltd; and cotton produced and processed by Xinjiang Junggar Cotton and Linen Co., Ltd. Legislative history On September 22, 2020 the bill passed the House by a 406–3 vote, with Republicans Thomas Massie, Warren Davidson and Libertarian Justin Amash voting against. Proposed legislation The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act would make it U.S. policy to assume (a \\"rebuttable presumption\\") that all goods manufactured in Xinjiang are made with forced labor, unless the commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection certifies that certain goods are known to not have been made with forced labor. The bill also calls for the President of the United States to impose sanctions on \\"any foreign person who 'knowingly engages'\\" in forced labor using minority Muslims. The bill would further require firms to disclose their dealings with Xinjiang. A list of Chinese companies that have relied on forced labor would be compiled. Reactions=Domestic United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) commissioners Gary Bauer, James W. Carr, and Nury Turkel have called on Congress to pass the act. The AFL-CIO and Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention have supported the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. Sophie Richardson, the China director of Human Rights Watch, said in April 2020 that the bill was unprecedented and could put pressure on companies seen as having some sway with Chinese authorities. The president of the American Apparel & Footwear Association said that blanket import bans on cotton or other products from Xinjiang from such legislation would \\"wreak havoc\\" on legitimate supply chains in the apparel industry because Xinjiang cotton exports are often intermingled with cotton from other countries and there is no available origin-tracing technology for cotton fibers.

The statue is a life-size bronze of Robert Baden-Powell by sculptor David Annand. It portrays Baden-Powell in his scout uniform, seated on a log as if for a campfire, with a pair of log seats either side which \\"allow easy access for photo opportunities\\". History The memorial was unveiled on 13 August 2008, facing Brownsea Island. The island was the site of Baden-Powell's first camp in 1907 which is seen as the start of the Scout and Guide movement. Robert Baden-Powell has been criticised over alleged events during his army career and his comments of support concerning Adolf Hitler and Mein Kampf. His biographer, Tim Jeal, said that any admiration was limited to his and Hitler's shared ideas for boys' education and liking Mein Kampf's references to character training. In June 2020, the memorial appeared on a list of targets by anti racism protesters. Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council planned to move it into storage pending discussion about its future, but council workers failed to remove the statue on 11 June 2020 as planned because the foundations were deeper than they had realised. A group of local people then surrounded the statue to prevent its removal and protect it from both council workers and activists. The council announced that it would arrange 24 hour security for the statue until either the statue had been removed or the threat had passed. On 12 June the statue was boarded up by the council for its protection. In response to the controversy, Bear Grylls, current Chief Scout, and successor to Baden-Powell, said, \\"... we also recognise that Baden-Powell is part of our history, and history is nothing if we do not learn from it ... Baden-Powell may have taken the first step in creating Scouting, but the journey continues today without him ... We know where we came from but we are not going back.\\" Grylls also said that he hoped Scouting statues remain in place \\"to remind us all of one thing - the huge positive influence that Scouting continues to bring to so many young people worldwide.\\" See also *Actions against memorials in the United Kingdom during the George Floyd protests ReferencesExternal links * * Category:2008 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:2008 sculptures Category:Bronze sculptures in the United Kingdom Category:Buildings and structures in Poole Category:George Floyd protests in the United Kingdom Category:Monuments and memorials in the United Kingdom Category:Outdoor sculptures in the United Kingdom Category:Sculptures of men in the United Kingdom Category:Statues in England ","title":"Statue of Robert Baden-Powell, Poole"},{"id":"64246239","text":"Peter Hill (July 19, 1767 – December 1820) was an American clockmaker.

Biography  Peter Hill was born into slavery on July 19, 1767 and lived on the land owned by a Quaker and clockmaker, Joseph Hollinshead Jr in Burlington Township, New Jersey. Hill worked as an apprentice to Hollinshead, starting at age 14. Hollingshead helped Hill set up a clockmaking business of his own prior to freeing him.

They were developed between 1200 and 1438, before the kingdoms disappeared due to the military conquest of the Inca Empire. But the current Aymara population is estimated at two million located in the countries of Bolivia, Peru, Chile and Argentina. They used the Aymara and Puquina languages.  Origin  During pre-colonial times these peoples were not known as Aymara, but were distinguished by the name of their own societies. The European chroniclers were the first to call these societies Aymara, but this name was not produced immediately because of the clear distinction between Aymara-speaking peoples. Aymara lordships were descendants of the Tiwanaku Empire. There were also Aymara descendant peoples in Lima, towards the end of the Wari Empire's heyday. A migration of Aymara peoples took place, one that contributed to the disarticulation of the imperial dominance of the region and, shortly after its disappearance, a number of Aymara-speaking, independent and rival kingdoms emerged. Some Aymara groups took advantage of the weakening of the Wari and settled on the central coast. The Kingdoms and Lordships There were 12 major Aymara Kingdoms:https://web.archive.org/web/20130924111838/http://www.indigenas.bioetica/. org / base / base2.htm # Canchis (Cusco) # Canas (Cusco) # Collas (Puno) # Lupacas (Puno) # Pacajes (La Paz) # Carangas (Oruro) # Soras (Oruro) # Charcas (Chuquisaca) # Quillacas (Potosí) # Cara-caras (Potosí) # Chuis (Sucre) # Chichas (Potosí-Tarija) There were also the following Aymara lordships: # Kallawaya (La Paz-Puno) # Yamparas (Sucre) # Tarija (Tarija) These kingdoms named, Urcosuyu (Urco: male, fire) on the western side of Lake Titicaca and Umasuyu (Uma: female, water) on the eastern side, geographically dominated a large number of territories in areas of lower altitude, both in the valleys of the Pacific and in the Amazon basin; they had discontinuous territories between the colonies in low areas like islands in various parts of the same valley, sharing the valley with other ethnic groups that could be local as well as other peoples of the highlands - a geopolitical phenomenon that John Murra calls \\"vertical archipelagos\\" - and although during the reign of the Inca Empire they kept both their lands in Qullaw and their colonies in the inter-Andean valleys; This domain of territory was respected until the first years of the Spanish conquest when its territorial and political dismemberment began. In all these societies, duality prevailed as a form of government - there were two leaders for each society. Most of these kingdoms buried their leaders in a mausoleum in the shape of a tower called a \\"chullpa\\"; the design of these towers was different in each of the societies. The Incan conquest There were intense rivalries between the Aymara kurakas of Chucuito, from the Lupaca Kingdom, and Hatunqulla, from the Colla Kingdom. These confrontations were known to the Incas and the Viracocha Inca was the first to try to take advantage of these rivalries, promising aid to both sides but secretly agreeing with the Lupacas of Chucuito. This treason was discovered by Cari, the Colla leader, who attacked the Lupacas near Paucarcolla before the Inca army arrived to help them. With this victory the collas became the dominant kingdom in all of Qullaw, annexing land along the Pacific. Later Pachacuti defeated the Collas. The kuraka of the Collas at that time was called Chuqui Capac, he was taken prisoner by the Incas after a long battle near Hatunqulla. At the time of the conquest of the Collas, its territory spanned from the Pacific coast, passing through the Qullaw plateau, to Mojeños mountains in the east. After the capture of Chuqui Capac, all the collas were subdued by the Incas, some by force and others peacefully; the towns that were destroyed were populated by mitmakunas and the other Aymara kingdoms ended up accepting the dominion of Cusco as did the Lupacas, Pacajes, Azangaros and others. After the expansion of the Inca empire into the land of the Aymara kingdoms, the Incas named all Aymara kingdoms \\"Collas\\", without distinction, and their territory became part of Collasuyo.

Mason had previously been released after completing a five-year sentence for tax fraud and cast a provisional ballot after arriving at her polling place to find her name stripped from the sign-in sheets. After voting she was convicted three months later for voter fraud and sentenced to five years imprisonment.  Background  Mason had been charged with tax fraud, for inflating returns for her clients as a tax preparer a crime which she pled guilty to in 2012. She had been released early in 2015, and decided to vote in the 2016 election after being encouraged by her mother. Per a statement by the Tarrant County Criminal District Attorney Office, a letter detailing her inability to vote was sent shortly after her incarceration for tax fraud. Mason claims she never received the letter, as she was already incarcerated. The state prohibits convicted felons from voting while they serve their sentence, while on parole or while probation or under supervision. Shortly before entering the White House, Donald Trump raised claims that 3 million illegal ballots had been cast in the 2016 election. In 2016, about 40,000 people in Texas cast provisional ballots that were later rejected. Additionally, in Tarrant County where she voted, more than 12,000 people have voted using a provisional ballot since 2014 with seven out of eight ballots rejected, and Mason seems to be the only voter who used this method to be charged with illegal voting.  Voter fraud  On November 8, 2016, Mason drove to her polling place in Rendon, Texas. When she attempted to sign in, the volunteer could not find her name on the sheets and gave her a provisional ballot that would be counted if her credential were valid. Written on the ballot is a statement that cautions individuals and explains that a person cannot vote if he or she is on supervised release as Mason was. Mason did not see the statement on the ballot, as an election worker was helping her.  Legal  She was convicted in 2018 for trying to vote in the 2016 election while on supervised release from her prior tax fraud felony conviction. During her initial trial, a probation official stated that he never told Mason that she could not vote, while Mason stated that she signed an affidavit that claimed she was an eligible voter. Mason was represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, the ACLU Voting Rights Project, the Texas Civil Rights Project, and two personal attorneys. In her appeal for the voter fraud conviction, Mason's defense team argued that it was unclear if Mason was truly ineligible to vote, or if she even voted since the provisional ballot was rejected and not tallied in the count. In March 2020, three Texas judges rejected her appeal. Judge Wade Birdwell wrote the decision for the three judge panel, stating that the fact that Mason did not know she was legally ineligible to vote was irrelevant to her prosecution and that the state only needed to prove that she voted while knowing that she was under supervision and therefore ineligible. Tarrant County District Attorney Sharen Wilson, offered Mason and her attorneys the option of probation instead of a jail sentence or a continued legal battle but Mason refused.  Response  Supporters of Mason and voter rights activists, have pointed out the discrepancy between Mason's sentencing and the sentencing of Terri Lynn Rote, who tried to vote for Donald Trump twice, and Justice of the Peace Russ Casey, who admitted to forging signatures to get on the primary ballot. Both Rote and Casey received two and five years probation instead of Mason's five year sentence to jail. Demonstrators protested against her sentencing on Labor Day in 2020, along with protesting the perceived lack of transparency about voting rights for convicted felons.

Protests in Minneapolis, also referred to as the Minneapolis riotsAizuramay, A. \\"A Mask and A Target Cart: Minneapolis Riots\\", The New Inquiry, 30 May 2020. or Minneapolis uprising, began as a response to the killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man who died on May 25 the day after an arrest after Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis Police Department officer, knelt on Floyd's neck for nearly eight minutes as three other officers assisted in the arrest. Unrest spilled over into Saint Paul, other locations in the Twin Cities metropolitan region, and throughout the U.S. state of Minnesota. Floyd's death and local unrest inspired a global protest movement against police brutality and racial inequality. The vast majority of protests in Minneapolis–Saint Paul were peaceful.Stockman, Farah (4 July 2020). \\"‘They have lost control’: How Minneapolis leaders failed to stop their city from burning\\" New York Times. However, over a three-night period from May 27 to May 29, Minneapolis sustained extraordinary damage from rioting and looting—largely along a stretch of Lake Street south of the city's downtown—including the demise of the city's third police precinct, which was overran and set on fire by demonstrators after police forces retreated. Neighboring Saint Paul suffered damages that totaled $82 million and affected 330 buildings, including 37 that were heavily damaged or entirely destroyed, mostly along the city's University Avenue business corridor. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz activated the state's National Guard in response to the riots, resulting in the largest deployment of its troops since World War II. By June 19, the violence in the Twin Cities had resulted in at least 2 deaths, 619 arrests, and upwards of $500 million in damage to 1,500 properties, the second-most destructive period of local unrest in United States history, after the 1992 Los Angeles riots.Braxton, Grey (16 June 2020). \\"They documented the ’92 L.A. uprising.

The Guardian. Although the community responded with an outpouring of donations, food drives, volunteer cleanup efforts, and public art installments during the protests, the initial period of riots worsened local economic conditions and disproportionately impacted people of color and the cities' most vulnerable residents, whom were already impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in Minnesota. By August 2020, many small business owners were unable to recover losses and rebuild as available recovery funds were quickly exhausted, which had officials in Minneapolis and Saint Paul seeking state and federal support for recovery efforts.  Background = Killing of George Floyd  A memorial at the site of George Floyd's death, May 26, 2020 George Floyd was an unarmed African-American man who died while he was being detained by police in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020, shortly after 8:00 p.m. CDT, near the Cup Foods grocery store at the intersection of East 38th Street and Chicago Avenue. According to a video recorded by a bystander, a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, knelt on Floyd's neck for approximately eight minutes, while other officers J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane, and Tou Thao assisted with the arrest and held concerned onlookers back. (video @ YouTube ) Floyd can be heard repeatedly on a bystander's video saying: \\"I can't breathe\\", \\"Please\\", and \\"Mama\\". He appeared unconscious at the scene, and was pronounced dead at 9:25 p.m. after being transported by an ambulance to the Hennepin County Medical Center emergency room.  Causes and conditions  Racial disparities in Minnesota = The conditions that led to the uprising in Minneapolis were said to be the result of years of disinvestment and abandonment of the area around Lake Street in Minneapolis and city officials ignoring the needs of the community's black residents.Ellis, Justin (9 June 2020). \\"Minneapolis Had This Coming: My hometown faces not just a rebuilding but a reckoning\\". The Atlantic. Retrieved 9 June 2020. By the beginning of the 21st century, Minneapolis was home to some of the largest racial disparities in the United States. The city's population of people of color and Indigenous people fared worse than the city's white population for many measures of well being, such as health outcomes, academic achievement, income, and home ownership. The result of discriminatory policies and racism over the course of the city's history, racial disparities was described as the most significant issue facing Minneapolis in the first decades of the 2000s. By 2015, homeownership rates in the Twin Cities were 75 percent for white families, but only 23 percent for black families, one of the largest disparities in the nation. By 2018, unemployment for blacks in Minnesota had reached a historic low of 6.9 percent, but it was still three times higher than the rate for whites.Ellis, Justin (9 June 2020). \\"Minneapolis Had This Coming: My hometown faces not just a rebuilding but a reckoning\\".

Star Tribune. Retrieved 7 July 2020. By the 2020s, generations of the city's black residents had not experienced the same levels of comforts and asset accumulation as the white residents. = Recent shootings of residents by police = George Floyd's death was viewed as just the latest instance of police violence in Minneapolis where 11 people had been killed by police officers since 2010. In 2015, the shooting of Jamar Clark, a black man, by a Minneapolis police officer led to controversy and protests; it was later determined by prosecutors that the officers had acted in self defense and no charges were filed. In 2016, the shooting of Philando Castile, a black man, in nearby Falcon Heights resulted in several weeks of protests and unrest, and the criminal case ended with a jury acquittal for the involved officer after a 10-month process. In 2017, the shooting of Justine Damond, a white women, led to a 12-year prison sentence for the police officer, a black man, who shot her. In many instances where Minneapolis officers justified the use of aggressive force against civilians, the police department developed a pattern of releasing officer statements that were later contradicted by video and other evidence, leading to several civil rights and wrongful death lawsuits. Some felt that the judicial system was inconsistent and that it did not hold white police officers who killed black men accountable for their actions, and the video of Floyd begging for relief while being pinned by Chauvin generated further concern and anger for both white and black residents in the city.Bunn, Curtis and Charles, Nick (30 May 2020). \\"Black men in Minneapolis outraged over Floyd killing, distrustful of judicial system\\".

Floyd's death was also the third in a string of highly reported and publicized incidents where unarmed black Americans were killed in 2020, Ahmaud Arbery in Atlanta on February 23 and Breonna Taylor in Louisville on March 13. It was unclear if demonstrators were angered only by the graphic video of Floyd's death or by the culmination of recent incidents in the United States. = Distrust of the Minneapolis police force = In Minneapolis, by 2020, the relationship between the community, particularly among city's black residents, and the Minneapolis Police Department had deteriorated after several killings of residents by police officers and by what some considered displays of racial insensitivity by police leaders. In the city's Powderhorn Park neighborhood, where Floyd was killed, some argued there was a persisting distrust between the police and black community. The head of the police union representing Minneapolis officers, Bob Kroll, was a continuing source of controversy, having called Black Lives Matter a \\"terrorist organization\\" in 2016 after the officers involved in Clark's death were cleared of wrongdoing. His appearance at a political rally for Donald Trump's presidential campaign in 2019 generated controversy for some when Kroll said that Trump would “let cops do their job, put the handcuffs on the criminals instead of [on] us”. Along with a \\"ghetto\\" Christmas tree that officers put up at the fourth police precinct station in 2018, the police relationship had eroded with the community, particularly for its black residents.Reeves, Mel (12 November 2019) \\"Trust level plunges after Kroll embraces Trump\\".

As thousands of people flooded the same intersection, organizers emphasized keeping the protest peaceful. By the middle of the afternoon, Arradondo had fired the city's four officers at the scene of Floyd's arrest and death, a move supported by Frey. However, protesters and Floyd's family called for murder charges for all four officers involved and swift judicial consequences, as the FBI and Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension opened investigations of the incident. Bob Kroll, president of the Minneapolis police officer's union, said the firing of the officers occurred without due process and offered \\"full support of the officers\\" during the investigations. Just before dusk, the protest rally at the location of Floyd's death became a march to the Minneapolis Police Department's third precinct police station where the four officers involved were believed to work.Caputo, Angela, Craft, Will and Gilbert, Curtis (30 June 30). \\"‘The precinct is on fire’: What happened at Minneapolis’ 3rd Precinct — and what it means\\".

The main protest group disbanded later in the evening, however a rowdier group broke away and began stray- painting graffiti on the precinct building and smashing windows of an empty police vehicle while some protesters urged them to stop. Newly-elected city council member Jeremiah Ellison, who had participated in prior protests against the police after the killing of black men, advised the mayor to not interfere with those vandalizing police property, hoping to spare the surrounding neighborhood. The situation escalated when some demonstrators breached the station's gated parking lot, and Arradondo ordered the police to move in with tear gas and rubber bullets to push them back, a move he later told reporters was because some officers kept weapons in their vehicles that could be taken. In response, demonstrators threw rocks, water bottles, and anything they could get their hands on towards the officers. The unruly crowd clashing with the police was measured in the hundreds, and noted as a contrast from the peaceful group at the start of the protest. Many protesters viewed the police response as an overreaction that only made the crowd angrier. A separate group of protesters gathered outside the Oakdale home of Derek Chauvin that night.  The riots and uprising  Wednesday, May 27 = Police and protesters stand off outside the third precinct station in Minneapolis, May 27, 2020 Under-construction apartment complex on fire in Minneapolis, May 27, 2020 Protests in Minneapolis continued on Wednesday, May 27, at several locations throughout the city. At the location where Floyd died, protesters were led through prayer and a series of chants. By late morning, a group of protesters blocked the nearby intersection as they repeated, \\"Whose streets? Our streets.\\" Some protesters left memorials by the Cup Foods store, while some spray painted the words \\"Justice for Floyd\\" and \\"Black Lives Matter\\" on the street surface. No police were present and the scene was described as peaceful. The tone of protests shifted that afternoon when a crowd gathered at the third precinct station from the spot were Floyd died. The rally was initially peaceful, but police later fired rubber bullets and chemical irritants as some protesters began breaking the precinct's windows; some activists again tried to stop people from vandalizing it further. As police forcefully advanced with tear gas, protesters scattered throughout the area. At an AutoZone store on East Lake Street, adjacent to the third police precinct station, a masked man carrying an umbrella and sledgehammer was recorded on video breaking windows and spray painting graffiti encouraging looting. Some protesters confronted him and asked him to stop. Later in the evening, the same AutoZone store was set on fire.Jany, Libor (28 July 2020). \\"Police: 'Umbrella Man' was a white supremacist trying to incite George Floyd rioting\\". Star Tribune.

Minneapolis City Council member Andrew Johnson, who represented the area, blamed the police for the unfolding destruction, saying \\"It looked like they were defending the Alamo and letting the community burn\\". Council member Jeremiah Ellison said in a media interview that night that the police should \\"sacrifice\\" the station, while council member Linea Palmisano expressed privately to a city official that such a move would result in \\"ultimate chaos\\". Violence continued overnight as rioters ignited fires and looted stores across the city. from the main protest site, Calvin Horton Jr., a 43-year-old man from Minneapolis, was fatally shot by a pawnshop owner who believed he was burglarizing his business. In a chaotic scene inside and around the pawn shop, some bystanders threw objects at police officers who tried to render first aid to Horton, Jr. and investigate what happened, leading the officers to flee the scene.Collins, John (21 July 2020). \\"Family demands charges in shooting during Floyd protests\\". MPR News. Dozens of other buildings were looted or destroyed along the city's busy north- and south-side business corridors, but most incidents occurred in the vicinity of the third precinct station. Among the losses was Midtown Corner, an under-construction, $30 million redevelopment project for 189 units of affordable housing, which was destroyed by fire after being torched.Jim Buchta, Minneapolis vandalism targets include 189-unit affordable housing development, Star Tribune (May 28, 2020). The response from firefighters in the area was delayed as crews required police escorts for protection from rioters. That night, Frey reached out to Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and requested the help of the Minnesota National Guard, but the city government seemed unaware of the timeline and logistics of troop deployment, and relegated tactical coordination to the police force. However, knowing that it would take some time for the National Guard to mobilize, Frey and city leaders began discussing ways to deescalate the situation. = Thursday, May 28 = Protest march in downtown Minneapolis, May 28, 2020 Scenes of protests and looting in Minneapolis, May 28, 2020 State of emergency By the morning of May 28, more than 30 businesses in Minneapolis had been damaged or destroyed by rioters. Chief Arradondo remarked that, in his view, the majority of protests the previous day were peaceful, but were \\"hijacked\\" by some who were looting and vandalizing businesses. Minneapolis city officials hoped that the worst had already passed. To quell riotous behavior, Mayor Frey declared a state of emergency to allow for more flexibility in the city's response. Frey and Arradondo also began quietly preparing for the contingency of surrendering the third precinct station in Minneapolis if violence escalated. Few people knew of the plan outside of some officers stationed there and nearby business owners that had heard rumors and noticed the station's parking lot being emptied. Businesses throughout the Twin Cities spent the day boarding up windows and doors to prevent looting. Among them, the Target Corporation announced closures for all of its area stores. Saint Paul police officers armed with batons and gas masks patrolled the city's busiest commercial corridor and kept looters out of a Target store while other business windows were smashed. Minneapolis preemptively shut down its light-rail system and bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns. Officials pleaded with metro area residents to stay home that night to prevent further property destruction. African American Saint Paul mayor Melvin Carter said, \\"Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again.\\" At 4 p.m. CDT, Governor Walz formally activated 500 National Guard troops and deployed them to the Twin Cities area, at the request of city leaders. Walz commented, \\"George Floyd's death should lead to justice and systemic change, not more death and destruction.\\" Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan added, \\"the demonstration last night became incredibly unsafe for all involved. The purpose of the National Guard is to protect people, to protect people safely demonstrating, and to protect small business owners.\\" Walz also said it would take guard troops a few days to fully mobilize. Case against the officers delayed State and federal prosecutors held a press conference in the late afternoon at a regional FBI office in Brooklyn Center, a Minneapolis suburb, in what was anticipated to be a major development to the case against the officers who were at the scene of Floyd's death.\\"Ex- Minneapolis police officer Chauvin was in talks to plead guilty before arrest\\" FOX 9.

Freeman, the local official with jurisdiction to bring forth criminal charges for police misconduct, said his office needed more time to investigate. In explaining the anticipation of the media briefing and its two-hour delayed start, U.S. Attorney Erica MacDonald said, \\"I thought we would have another development to talk to you about, but we don’t\\". Weeks later, on June 9, it was revealed that state and federal prosecutors were negotiating a plea deal with former officer Derek Chauvin at the time that would have included state murder charges and federal civil rights charges, but the deal fell apart for reasons that were not fully explained. From calm to chaos Several stores set ablaze on East Lake Street in Minneapolis, May 28, 2020 Thousands of peaceful protesters again marched the streets and called for justice for George Floyd during the day. Hundreds of demonstrators in Minneapolis also returned to the area near the third precinct police station, where Frey and Arradondo had deliberately reduced the street presence of the police. By the evening, police reports said the crowd was \\"engaged in peaceful activity\\" as some were said to be grilling, listening to music, and socializing. It was not until after dark the crowd grew more restless, when looting of a nearby Target store resumed and a vehicle and building were set on fire. Multiple large, mobile crowds and chaos were reported across the city by nightfall. A crowd of 1,500 protesters were marching through a downtown shopping district in Minneapolis where there were 400 state troopers present. Another large crowd advanced on the city's first police precinct station near Hennepin Avenue and 5th Street and smaller crowds gathered elsewhere. “We were defending an entire city with 600 officers against thousands and thousands of protestors,” said Frey of the events later.Lyden, Tom (19 July 2020). \\"Fall of the Third Precinct: A minute-by-minute account\\".

The intensity of demonstrations increased as dozens of businesses were looted and set on fire on East Lake Street in Minneapolis near the city's third police precinct station. Looters broke into a liquor store across the street from the station and passed out bottles to the crowd, and then set the store on fire. The nearby Max It Pawn store was set on fire as it was being looted. Bystanders discovered that a person was trapped inside the building, but were unable to help guide them out after frantically removing some plywood from windows and shining flashlights inside. Fire crews that arrived later found the building too unstable for a rescue operation into the structure.Roper, Eric (22 July 2020). \\"'There's somebody in there!'

The body of the victim, the second death during the unrest, was not recovered until nearly two months later on July 20, 2020.  Loss of the third precinct station  Demonstrators surround the Minneapolis police third precinct station as it is engulfed in flames, May 28, 2020 Late that night the focus of demonstrators shifted to the police station building itself. Some threw objects at officers who responded by firing rubber bullets. Demonstrators eventually tore down fencing surrounding the precinct station and police responded with tear gas. As tensions and fires in the area mounted, Frey gave the order to evacuate the station, a tactic he later said was to deescalate the situation and prevent further loss of life. The building was then overrun by protesters and set on fire. Despite the evacuation order there were still at least 13 police officers in the building with some reportedly sending texts to loved ones in fear of their lives. Officers retreating from the building in squad vehicles had to crash through the parking lot gate as it been padlocked at some point by protesters. Demonstrators then moved in and threw bottles and debris at the fleeing officers who eventually made their way to a rendezvous site three blocks away. At 10:13p.m. CDT, chief Arradondo announced over police radio, “City wide tone right now, for the loss of the Third Precinct”. After that moment, there were no police, fire, or emergency medical services presence in the area where the riots occurred as live television news broadcast scenes of escalating destruction. Surrounded by an unruly crowd, the station burned until the early morning hours of May 29 when firefighting crews reached the area and eventually extinguished fires. The several-hundred contingent of state patrol and National Guard troops on the ground in Minneapolis that night largely escorted fire trucks around and protected a Federal Reserve building and areas of downtown Minneapolis. Walz later remarked that the city had not given directions on where to deploy troops as the violence escalated on East Lake Street. State officials also remarked that the city's decision to abandon the precinct station was a misjudgment, allowing demonstrators to create a situation of \\"absolute chaos\\", in the words of Walz.  Saint Paul and elsewhere  In neighboring Saint Paul, which had been spared from widespread property destruction on Wednesday night, 170 businesses were damaged or looted and dozens of fires had been started, with the largest ones near Snelling and University avenues, but no major injuries were reported. The Midway Shopping Center and Sun Ray Shopping Center in Saint Paul and the Rosedale Center stores in a nearby suburb were looted. = Friday, May 29 = Minnesota State Patrol officers stand wearing riot gear in Minneapolis, May 29, 2020 Scenes of fires and destruction in Minneapolis, May 29, 2020 Mayor Frey addressed the media at 1:30 a.m. CDT as the city was battling multiple fires and violence. Frey acknowledged the anger in the community over Floyd's death, but condemned the actions of rioters and looters. In defense of his decision to have police withdraw from the third precinct station, he said, \\"Brick and mortar is not as important as life\\". That day, Governor Walz imposed a state curfew for the cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul that would run from 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. on Friday, May 29 and Saturday, May 30. The order prohibited travel in streets or gathering at public places. Frey also issued an overlapping local curfew in Minneapolis. Meanwhile, the Target Corporation expanded its closure of stores to 73 in Minnesota. In the late afternoon, Hennepin County Attorney Michael O. Freeman charged Derek Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck as he died, with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, but new charges for officers Lane, Kueng, and Thao, who were at the scene of Floyd's death, remained pending. Protesters, who had demanded immediate murder charges against all four officers, were disappointed after waiting four days since Floyd's death and made the criminal charges a big part of their message that day. The de-escalation strategy of abandoning the third precinct station the previous night was said to have little affect on quelling unrest on Friday. Despite the announcement of the charges against the officers involved in Floyd's death and the new curfew, riots broke out again on Friday night and continued into early Saturday morning, with much of the action taking place adjacent to the Minneapolis police fifth precinct station near Lake Street and Nicollet Avenue; 75 fires were reported in Minneapolis from Friday night into Saturday. Law enforcement presence was reportedly \\"undetectable\\" as violence in Minneapolis quickly grew until just before midnight, when police officers, state troopers, and members of the National Guard began confronting rioters with tear gas and mass force. Officials later said that the 350 police officers at the site of rioting near the Minneapolis fifth precinct station were vastly outnumbered by the crowds. Walz explained that the scope of the chaos, the time it takes to mobilize guard troops, and the mobile nature of the crowds made it difficult to direct response forces. Minnesota Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said that protests were active at several sites through the city and that there were not enough officers to safely and successfully undertake multiple missions.Brown, Kyle (30 May 2020). \\"Gov. Walz calls for full mobilization of the Minnesota National Guard; says many protesters from out of state\\". KSTP. Retrieved on 30 May 2020.

Violent unrest subsides  Saturday, May 30 = Volunteers with brooms pose for a photo in Minneapolis, May 30, 2020 Smoke and the sound of helicopters filled the sky in Minneapolis through the night as multiple fires burned near the fifth police precinct in south Minneapolis. A United States Post Office on Nicollet, a Wells Fargo Bank branch, and several gas stations, among other businesses, blazed. Several businesses also burned on West Broadway in north Minneapolis, including a barbershop that was destroyed by fire. Officials were unable to immediately attend to major fires, citing security concerns at the sites, but later reached them when they could be accompanied by patrols. For the second time in as many nights, officials held a press conference at 1:30 a.m. CDT, but this time in Saint Paul and led by the governor and state officials. Some officials speculated that much of the destruction was being caused by people from outside the state, a claim that was later contradicted by arrest records of protesters and that officials rescinded. It was reported that mayor Frey and governor Walz appeared visibly exhausted as they made emotional pleas to the public about Floyd's death and the escalation of violence. \\"The absolute chaos — this is not grieving, and this is not making a statement [about an injustice] that we fully acknowledge needs to be fixed — this is dangerous,\\" Walz said. \\"You need to go home.\\" Walz also took responsibility for underestimating the size of the crowds causing destruction earlier in the night. Officials mobilized guard troops throughout Saturday expecting even larger crowds. Groups of people continued to gather at the makeshift memorial at the site of Floyd's arrest and subsequent death. Minneapolis police reported that another group of protesters near Hiawatha Avenue and Lake Street were attacking police by throwing nondescript objects, and deployed more units to the area. That night after curfew, police fired tear gas at a group of protesters who were attempting to march from Minneapolis to Saint Paul via the Lake Street bridge. By the night of May 30, the Minnesota National Guard neared full deployment levels. Street violence began to subside as protests returned to being largely peaceful events.

A semi-truck tanker, unaware the road was closed, drove through the crowd as they parted ways to avoid being run down. After the driver came to a halt, he was pulled from his cab and beaten by the surrounding crowd. He suffered minor injuries, as some of the protesters attempted to protect him. Bystanders delivered the driver to the police, who then pepper-sprayed the crowd. The truck driver was taken to Hennepin County Medical Center then released into the custody of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which initially charged him with assault.

Hacked police intelligence documents as part of the BlueLeaks data release revealed that federal and state officials were monitoring social media and online message groups for extremist activity related to the protests. Local law enforcement were on high alert for suspicious behavior and attacks on officers, possibly leading to confrontational tactics with demonstrators, such as firing less-lethal munitions and tear gas.

Built in 1985, the third precinct station in south Minneapolis was overrun by protesters and officially lost on Thursday, May 28, 2020. It is a matter of debate whether the decision by city officials to abandon it helped save lives or inspired more violence. Arradondo, Frey, and other city leaders prepared as early as Wednesday, May 27 for the possibility of surrendering the station, which had been the location of tense protests beginning the evening of Tuesday, May 26, a day after Floyd's arrest and death.Tangel, Andrew, Barrett, Joe Barrett, and Ailworth, Erin (2 July 2020). \\"We’re Just Going to Walk Away From This?’ How Minneapolis Left a Police Station to Rioters\\". Wall Street Journal. Retrieved on 5 July 2020. According to Frey, after the precinct building was breached the city faced the choice of hand-to-hand combat with demonstrators that could result in more death, or forces could make a hasty departure and leave the building to the crowd, the latter of which happened in dramatic fashion as it was captured on live video. The image of an abandoned police station being set on fire by demonstrators was said to symbolize the collapse of order in Minneapolis and the failure of the police's relationship with the community. The precinct had a reputation over the preceding years for what the community considered aggressive policing by officers.Otárola, Miguel and Van Berkel, Jessie (15 July 2020). \\"Rebuilding Third Precinct station will cost $10 million, Minneapolis estimates show\\".

Community actions  Cleanup of property damage = People clean sidewalks of debris in Minneapolis, May 30, 2020 Each morning, hundreds of residents, some with snow shovels and brooms, went to areas affected by overnight rioting to clean up trash, graffiti, broken glass, and the remnants of damaged buildings. Some residents participating in the clean up were devastated by the damage, but shared the sense of anger and solidarity over Floyd's death. Other participants said that cleaning up helped calm intense emotions about the events. Organizers of clean up events said they were partially motivated by a worry that the protests would only be defined only by looting and vandalism and not messages about justice.Barry, Ellen (1 June 2020). In Cities Battered by Protest, the Cleaning Crews Come Out”. New York Times. Retrieved on 2 June 2020. = Food drives = Residents took action to support the needs of people for food and goods who were affected by the riots. In the areas of heavy rioting, many local stores were closed after being looted and burned, and food pantries were overwhelmed. A small food drive at a middle school in Minneapolis aimed to fill 85 bags of food to help families, but organizers ended up with a line of vehicles stretching 14 city blocks and 20,000 bags of bread, fruit, and other items. A food drive in the Little Earth community resulted in enough packages of food and diapers to serve 1,000 residents and 7,500 people from the nearby neighborhoods. Many organizations, overwhelmed by the volume of donations, had to turn them away. = Public art installments = Murals in Minneapolis of George Floyd, Tony McDade, and Breonna Taylor by artist Leslie Barlow, June 15, 2020 Vibrant works of arts appeared all over the Twin Cities that honored George Floyd's memory and showed community solidarity. Boarded-up buildings were described as canvasses for artists, and so were walls, sidewalks, and public property. In a grassy field near the location where Floyd died, artists erected a symbolic cemetery with 100 gravestone markers of African-Americans, including of Floyd, who were killed by police. A mural of George Floyd on the side of the Cup Foods grocery store became one of the most recognizable images of the global protest movement that was sparked by his death, and a digital rendering of it served as a backdrop to his casket at his funeral in Houston, Texas. The work, created by white artists, drew some criticism for being created without the input of people of color and the nearby community, and it started a discussion about representation in the artist response to Floyd's death.Allston, Alexis (8 July 2020). \\"Mural raises concerns about representation in art responding to George Floyd's killing\\".

A group of local artists using the name Creatives After Curfew, who were predominately Black, Indigenous, and People of Color painted murals on boarded-up business through the Twin Cities after raising money for paint supplies through several campaigns, and their works featured messages calling for justice and expressing pride for minority-owned businesses. = Safety patrols = Residents awoke many mornings during the heaviest rioting to find nearby restaurants, liquor stores, and other businesses had been set on fire. In Minneapolis, the Longfellow, Powderhorn, and Phillips communities were heavily affected by the events. Reports and videos of residents confronting the people causing damage circulated, as did rumors about who might be responsible for the violence. Some residents felt the city and law enforcement had abandoned them, so they carried bats and sticks to protect their homes and businesses. On Saturday, May 30, Minneapolis city counselors hosted community meetings in public parks and helped residents initiate block-by-block plans to monitor disruptive activity. The American Indian Movement and local business owners organized group patrols around the Little Earth community of up to 100 volunteers each night of the larger protests, which was credited with saving more than 20 businesses on Franklin Avenue. Many small business owners and organization leaders stood guard at their buildings overnight during the heaviest rioting. Some intervened to dissuade rioters from destroying property while others carried fire arms. Several establishments near Lake Street posted signs that the business or organization was minority or black owned, or that it served American Indian youth. Some businesses were spared from destruction, such as a Nepalese restaurant on East Lake Street in Minneapolis that posted such signs, but others were destroyed by fire despite similar notices, such as a nearby Indian restaurant and barbershop. One business owner of a distillery near the Minneapolis third precinct station credited \\"black owned\\" signs for preventing fires at part of his business complex.

Calvin Horton Jr., a 43-year-old man from Minneapolis, was fatally shot by the owner of the Cadillac Pawn & Jewelry shop who believed he was burglarizing his business. The incident took place on East Lake Street about from the main protest site on the evening of May 27. The owner of the shop was a 59-year-old man from Galesville, Wisconsin. The scene in and around the store was described as chaotic with many people inside the store. When police officers arrived in response to the shooting, bystanders threw objectors at the officers as they administered aid to Horton, Jr. and attempted to investigate the scene, leading the officers abort the investigation. The shop owner was arrested the night of the shooting and held in Hennepin County Jail for several days, but he was released pending further investigation. Only one witness came forward and authorities could not find any surveillance video that showed what happened. There were no new developments in the case by July 21, 2020, when family and supporters of Horton, Jr. protested outside the store and demanded the owner be charged with murder. Federal and state authorities recovered a body at the Max It Pawn store on July 20, 2020, that appeared to have suffered thermal injuries. The pawn shop, located a few blocks east of the third precinct station, was destroyed by fire during rioting on May 28. A 25-year-old man from Rochester, Minnesota was federally charged in June with arson for the particular fire. The identity of the adult male victim was not initially released by officials who said they were investigating the death as a homicide.Carlisle, Madeleine (21 July 2020). \\"Body Found In Building Burned During Minneapolis Protests Over George Floyd's Murder\\".

Thousands of visitors protested and grieved at the site, which was described as like a \\"shrine\\". Many visitors left behind flowers by the murals and sculptures created by activists to symbolize the Black Lives Matter movement. The Minneapolis police said in June that they would not alter or decommission the memorial site or remove artifacts. Police officers largely avoided the area in the months after Floyd's death. However, violent crime and drug overdoses by night, and the disruption to public transit and business activity by day, had city officials looking for ways in late July to create a permanent memorial while also opening the intersection back up.Tim Arango, Tim and Furber, Matt (29 July 2020). \\"Where George Floyd Was Killed: Solemn by Day, Violent by Night\\". New York Times. Retrieved on 30 July 2020. The Minneapolis Planning Commission recommend to the city council that the length of Chicago Avenue between 37th and 39th streets be named as “George Perry Floyd Jr Place”. The city also allocated $4.7 million to establish a permanent memorial at the site. By late August, the city was unable to reach agreement with community organizations who had presented officials with a list of demands before opening the intersection back up. In early August, the re-opening of the Cup Foods convenience store, which a 9-1-1 call from an employee led to the fatal encounter between Floyd and Minneapolis police, generated controversy. Some protesters demanded that the store remain closed for continued mourning and confronted store owners who vowed to keep the store open anyway.Otárola, Miguel (4 August 2020). \\"Cup Foods, site where George Floyd was killed, reopens in south Minneapolis\\". Star Tribune. The store, owned by a Palestinian-American family, had been a fixture in the neighborhood for three decades. The area around it had also been the location of violent crime, illicit drug dealing, loitering, and undercover police surveillance since the 1990s.Bogel-Burroughs, Nicholas and Healy, Jack (15 June 2020). \\"Cup Foods, a Minneapolis Corner Store Forever Tied to the Death of George Floyd\\".

Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder. For many of its customers, the store provided fresh produce and commodities such as cigarettes and pre- paid cellphone minutes. Though Floyd lived 20 minutes away in the nearby suburb of St. Louis Park, he was a frequent costumer at the store. Floyd's death led to further scrutiny of the store and its relationship with the Minneapolis police and its off-duty police officers who were known to provide paid security services. Among public conversation about how to evolve the space into a permanent memorial, some activists circulated petitions to permanently close the store.  Law enforcement reform  State and city policies = The widespread protests and a significant public scrutiny of its law enforcement policies led to reforms of policing in Minneapolis and the U.S. state of Minnesota. The Minneapolis City Council and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights agreed to a temporary restraining order requiring Minneapolis to update its procedures to ban chokeholds and other neck restraints by police, such as the one an officer used in the incident when George Floyd was killed. Many organizations quickly distanced themselves from the Minneapolis police force by ending formal policing relationships, led by city's school district and park board and the University of Minnesota. The park board also announced changes to the park police uniforms and vehicles to distinguish them from Minneapolis police. On July 21, 2020, the Minnesota state legislature passed major police reform legislation that banned chokeholds, established an independent commission to review police-related deaths, and required deescalation training for officers. = Minneapolis police union = Bob Kroll, head of the Minneapolis police officers union, was the subject of several protests. After offering support for the officers at Floyd's death and a full investigative process, he made few substantial statements during the initial course of events. But after several days of clashes with the police and protesters, he sent a controversial email to Minneapolis rank-and-file police officers. The message criticized Frey and Walz for not containing the riots and commending the work of responding officers, and he characterized the protests as a \\"terrorist movement\\", a claim he also made about the Black Lives Matter movement in 2016. Several local officials were quick to condemn Kroll's email statement, including city council president Lisa Bender who described Kroll as \\"a barrier to change\\" of the Minneapolis police force. Several labor union leaders called for Kroll's removal, with one saying he perpetuated \\"a culture of violence\\" against the black community. In June, Arradondo announced the police department would withdraw from union contract negotiations as a first step towards police reforms. = \\"Defund the police\\" movement = A \\"defund police\\" sign and stage before a rally at Powderhorn Park in Minneapolis, June 7, 2020 Floyd's death and the resulting unrest advanced the \\"defund the police\\" movement in Minneapolis. At a Powderhorn Park rally organized by black-led social justice organizations on June 7, 2020, nine of the 13 members of the Minneapolis city council vowed to dismantle the city's police department, despite opposition from Frey. The pledge did not actually disband the police force and details about the next steps in the process were not defined by the council members at the time. Some activists wanted to consider the idea of unarmed crisis response personnel and re-purposing the police department's $193 million annual budget for education, food, housing, and health care. At the Little Earth community, where residents had organized nightly safety patrols during the heaviest nights of rioting, the community paid for lights at a park and trained community members in de-escalation tactics, efforts some hoped would serve as a new model for policing in the city.Burks, Megan Burks and Martinez, Kathryn Styer (27 July 2020). \\"Little Earth patrols might be a preview of a new style of policing\\". MPR News. The city council voted unanimously in June to revise the city's charter to permit dismantling of the police department, a step towards possibly replacing the police department with a civilian-led Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention, and with goal of putting the issue before voters on the ballot in November. The council's move drew opposition from some black leaders and activists who felt that the council was \\"pandering\\", in the words of a local pastor. Others felt that the council had not adequately included voices from the black community in the process and expressed the need to address public safety concerns as black residents were disproportionately victims of crime and witnesses of crime in the city, just as they were disproportionately victims of excessive police force.Rao, Maya (2 July 2020). \\"Some Minneapolis Black leaders speak out against City Council's moves to defund police\\".

Economic impact  Property damage = Ruins of a factory destroyed by May 27 riots in Minneapolis, June 13, 2020 During the riots, National Guard forces and law enforcement focused on protecting large institutions such as the Federal Reserve, power plants, and state capitol building. Officials acknowledged the emphasis came at the expense of family- and minority-owned business, many of which were burned or plundered by looters. Nearly 1,500 property locations in the Twin Cities were damaged by vandalism, fire, and/or looting, with some buildings reduced to rubble and dozens of others completely destroyed by fire. The heaviest damage occurred in Minneapolis along a stretch on Lake Street between the city's third and fifth police precincts and in Saint Paul along a stretch of University Avenue in the Midway area.

Saint Paul officials also established a $3 million relief fund, but it was quickly depleted and officials looked to state and federal relief options by August 2020. Many small business owners in the Twin Cities who were affected by the riots and looting found they had to pay for repairs and rebuilding out of their own pockets as insurance payments fell well short of amounts needed.Meitrodt, Jeffrey (6 June 2020). \\"For riot- damaged Twin Cities businesses, rebuilding begins with donations, pressure on government\\".

Retrieved on 11 July 2020  Public health impact  COVID-19 pandemic = protective masks in Minneapolis, May 26, 2020 Civic unrest after Floyd's death came in the middle of the global COVID-19 pandemic caused by the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infection. People wearing protective masks became a common sight at protests, but social distancing proved difficult. Many protesters had to weigh the risk of being infected with the virus against the desire to call for police accountability and structural change in Minneapolis. Health officials in Minnesota warned that mass protests could exacerbate the spread of the virus in Minnesota and trigger a surge in the outbreak that has a disproportionate impact on minority communities. In early June, the state's health department stood up free testing clinics with the help of community organizations and encouraged people who participated in protests to get tested. By June 18, of the 3,200 people tested at four popup sites in the metropolitan region, 1.8 percent tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, while testing by private health care provider HealthPartners had a 0.99 percent positive rate among the 8,500 people it tested who said they attended a mass gathering. Kristen Ehresmann, infectious disease director for the state health department, remarked about the data, \\"it appears there was very little transmission at protest events”.  Removal of statues  An American Indian Movement group tore down a statue of Christopher Columbus outside the state capitol building in Saint Paul on June 10 as the global protest movement turned towards removing monuments and memorials with controversial legacies. Demonstrators, including Dakota and Ojibwe community members, looped a rope around the statue and pulled it off its granite pedestal. Minnesota State Troopers were present, but did not intervene. The statute was hauled away and placed in storage. The Minnesota Twins removed the statute of former owner Calvin Griffith outside the team's Target Field baseball stadium in Minneapolis on June 19. In a statement, the team said the \\"statue reflects an ignorance on our part of systemic racism present in 1978, 2010 and today\\". Griffith's legacy was tarnished after racist comments he made in a 1978 speech at the Waseca Lions Club, but a statute of him was placed in the stadium's plaza when it opened in 2010.  Social impact  Crime and safety = Rising crime following the unrest created debate about the role of the police and safety of residents. Gun violence rates increased in Minneapolis and Saint Paul in the weeks following the rioting. Incidents where residents reported shots fired and the number of people shot were several times higher than for a similar period the prior year and for five-year averages. Law enforcement officials blamed increased gang activity and emboldend youth to hide their identity as some of the reasons.Jany, Libor and Sawyer, Liz (27 June 2020). \\"Gun violence soars amid crises of health, public trust, officer reluctance\\". Star Tribune. Retrieved on 7 July 2020.

Police activity in June through August of 2020 fell by 30% compared the prior year, despite a considerable jump in gunfire reports, homicides, and violent crimes. = Homelessness = The riots in late May also had impact on people experiencing homelessness and led to changes in city policies on homeless camps. Some who were displaced by the unrest sought refuge in a vacant Sheraton hotel in the city's Midtown neighborhood.

The team began as an experimental project for children classed as having little sporting talent, who were never selected for the starting squads of the teams that represented their sport schools. In 2019 Phoenix qualified for the final part of the Futsal Championship of Ukraine, where it took fourth place, and earned a name for itself in the national sporting community. In 2020 Phoenix won the Under 14s Cup of Ukraine.  Creation of the team  The Phoenix experiment began on the 8th November 2015 in Kharkiv. It took a different approach from the one normally taken in schools, where players are chosen on the basis of a thorough selection process, because Phoenix was created by parents whose children didn’t make the starting squads of their teams. Using a new methodology, and with the support of the company Plarium Ukraine, the children were offered training from professional coaches who were experts in track-and-field athletics, gymnastics, and swimming. The former futsal players Serhii Hrytsenko and Yurii Vashchenko () became lead coaches — their work with Phoenix was the first time either of them had taken on a coaching role. The project was unique in Ukraine. It aimed to find out what children from the subs bench could actually achieve if they were given proper training and development opportunities. The ‘unpromising children’ of Phoenix suffered big defeats in their first few games. Despite this, the coaches were tasked with training them to get good results, and they were told they couldn’t bringing in reinforcements from anywhere else. A psychologist was also brought in to work with the young players, separately from the coaches. The people behind the Phoenix project were trying to model it on a professional sports club, but building it around children who had dropped out of normal children’s sport. They came up with the motto ‘Anyone can be a Hero’. Just a year and a half later, Phoenix gained its first prize at regional level — the Kharkiv Cup. Two weeks before that game, the team won a tournament dedicated to the memory of the famous sports journalist Boris Lanevskyi. The following season, the children won the ‘Plarium League’ futsal tournament in Kharkiv. Meanwhile their coaches, Serhii Hrytsenko and Yurii Vashchenko, who had had no coaching experience before their work with Phoenix, qualified as category ‘C’ futsal coaches, and received diplomas from the Football Federation of Ukraine — Ukrainian Association of Football. In 2018, Phoenix took part in local matches, and also in a friendly tournament in Nuremberg in Germany, where they finished in third place. With this result, the team was invited to take part in the international Raiffeisen Cup in Nuremberg.  Championship and the Cup of Ukraine = 2018/19  Phoenix qualified for the final stage of the Futsal Championship of Ukraine in futsal, in the U-13 category, in the 2018/19 season. The team took first place in the regional qualifier and in the play- offs, and despite losing its first game, it won against Olimpiya-Dnipro, led by Olexander Yuzik, on aggregate for both games. Deciding matches, played by the eight best teams, took place in Kherson in March 2019. Phoenix met squads from Ternopil, Odessa and Cherkasy at the group stage. Thanks to a goal scored four seconds before the end of the match against Chorne More, Phoenix qualified for the semi-finals. It lost the semi-final game, and the play-off for third place, but it was a major success for Phoenix to be one of the four best teams in the country. It had performed so well that six of its players were invited to join the combined East Ukraine U-13 squad for the Conference Cup, which took place in the ‘Yunist’ (Zaporizhia) Palace of Sport in April 2019.  2019/20  In the 2019/20 season Phoenix won two friendly tournaments, and received gold medals from the Top League of the Futsal Fair in Lutsk. It also won the international friendly tournament in Hamburg. This team of children born in 2006 finished in third place in the qualifying tournament for the Championship of Ukraine, and fought its way to the final stages of the U-15 Championship that took place in Kherson, where it was placed just seventh in the overall ranking. Phoenix took part in the futsal Cup of Ukraine for children born in 2006, which took place from the 9th to the 12th March 2020 in Slobozhanske in the Dnipropetrovsk region. The team finished in first place in the group stage after scoring 10 points in 5 games. In the final, Phoenix met their peers from the Olimpiya-Dnipro team. The score at full time was 1:1, but Phoenix won the penalty shootout 3:1. The Phoenix player Ivan Konkov was named best player of the tournament.. File:Fc- phoenix-2.jpg File:Fc-phoenix-3.jpg File:Fc-phoenix-4.jpg File:Fc- phoenix-5.jpg File:Fc-phoenix-6.jpg  Public organisation  There’s been much interest in Kharkiv and beyond in the Phoenix phenomenon - the successful futsal team made up of “unpromising” children. Channel 9 in Dnipro produced a story on the history of the project. Phoenix players, coaches and parents were also interviewed in the studios of the “UA:Kharkiv” TV channel. The Ukrainian football newspaper “Goal!” reviewed the team’s performance at the Championship of Ukraine. Soon after that the Ukraine-wide TV channel STB aired the story “Never Give Up”, about Phoenix. In just five years since its creation, Phoenix has gone from a team of total amateurs to a futsal club good enough to win the Cup of Ukraine. As well as the team of children born in 2006, Phoenix now has a separate group of young players born in 2013. The public company “Phoenix Centre for Social Youth Innovation” was registered in March 2020..

Produced by Tommy Allsup primarily at Jack Clement Studios in Nashville, Tennessee, it was released in August 1975 as the group's first album on Capitol Nashville. The album was the band's first commercial success, charting on the US Billboard 200 and reaching the top ten of the Top Country Albums chart. Lead single \\"The Letter That Johnny Walker Read\\" also reached the Hot Country Songs top ten. For the third consecutive album, Asleep at the Wheel changed record labels for Texas Gold. After former label Epic Records (which issued Asleep at the Wheel in 1974) rejected three demo recordings, the group signed with Columbia Records in June 1975. Recording took place that month, primarily (for all but two songs) at Jack Clement Studios. Texas Gold was the band's first album to feature fiddler Danny Levin and drummer Scott Hennige, and the only release with saxophonist Ed Vizard. Texas Gold was a critical and commercial success. The band's first album to chart domestically, it peaked at number 7 on the Billboard Top Country Albums Chart and number 136 on the Billboard 200. All three of the record's singles reached the Hot Country Songs top 40, including \\"The Letter That Johnny Walker Read\\" which peaked at number 10. The album was praised by critics and received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. Background Following the release of the band's 1974 self-titled second album, Asleep at the Wheel underwent a number of lineup changes – vocalist and drummer LeRoy Preston switched to a role of third guitarist, Scott Hennige took his place on drums, and Danny Levin (with whom the band had played occasionally in its early years) joined on fiddle. The group also added its first official saxophonist in Ed Vizard, who performed alongside guest contributors David Poe, Billy Briggs and Mike O'Dowd. In early 1975, Asleep at the Wheel recorded demo versions of three new original songs, including \\"The Letter That Johnny Walker Read\\" and \\"Bump Bounce Boogie\\", at a local Austin, Texas studio called PSG run by Pedro Gutierrez. However, the tracks were rejected by the band's label Epic Records, who frontman Ray Benson recalled dismissed the tracks as \\"terrible\\" and \\"awful\\". This led to the group signing a deal with its third label in three years, Capitol Records, in June 1975. Capitol allowed Asleep at the Wheel to work again with Tommy Allsup, who had previously produced the band's 1973 debut Comin' Right at Ya. After recording \\"Fat Boy Rag\\" and \\"Roll 'Em Floyd\\" at KAFM Studios in Dallas, Texas with engineer Roger Harris, tracking for the rest of the album took place at Jack Clement Studios in Nashville, Tennessee with Billy Sherrill. The album was named after Acapulco Gold, a strain of cannabis the band smoked and referred to as \\"Texas Gold\\". Shortly after Texas Gold was completed, Asleep at the Wheel released \\"The Letter That Johnny Walker Read\\" as its first single for Capitol. Commentators praised the song and predicted that it would be a commercial success. It was the group's first song to register on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart, peaking at number 10, and also the first on the Canadian RPM Country Singles chart, peaking at number 32. Texas Gold was released in August, followed by singles \\"Bump Bounce Boogie\\" in November and \\"Nothin' Takes the Place of You\\" in March 1976. \\"Bump Bounce Boogie\\" and \\"Nothin' Takes the Place of You\\" also reached the top 40 of the Hot Country Singles chart – the former at number 31, and the latter number 35. Reception=Commercial Texas Gold entered the US Billboard Top Country Albums chart at number 36 on September 13, 1975. The following week, it also entered the Billboard 200 at number 187. By November, the album had peaked at number 7 on the country chart and number 136 on the main albums chart. Outside of the Billboard charts, Texas Gold reached number 158 on the Cash Box albums chart and number 4 on the publication's country albums chart, as well number 143 on the Record World albums chart and number 6 on the magazine's country albums chart. Critical Upon its release, Texas Gold received largely positive reviews from critics. Billboard magazine praised the album for having \\"Much more emphasis on original material with a wider variety of music than [the band has] tackled in the past,\\" concluding that the release was \\"Way above previous LPs in variety [and] skill\\". Particular merit was afford to Chris O'Connell's \\"excellent\\" vocal performances. Similarly, a review published in Cash Box dubbed the album \\"a variety of sound that can't miss\\". Reviewing the album retrospectively for music website AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine credited Texas Gold for \\"setting [Asleep at the Wheel's] career into high gear\\", thanks in part to the success of lead single \\"The Letter That Johnny Walker Read\\". He praised many elements of the record, including song choice and the band's performances, before concluding his 4.5-star review by stating: \\"Texas Gold [was] the best record Asleep at the Wheel had made to date. Arguably, it's the best, most consistent album they ever did.\\" Independent critic Robert Christgau awarded the album a B+ rating, higher than Asleep at the Wheel but lower than Comin' Right at Ya. Accolades Following the commercial and critical success of Texas Gold, Asleep at the Wheel was nominated for several industry awards. In September 1975, the group received a nomination for Vocal Group of the Year at the Country Music Association Awards. The band also received its first Grammy Award nominations at the 18th Annual Grammy Awards held in February 1976, where Texas Gold was nominated for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and the recording of Bob Wills' \\"Fat Boy Rag\\" was shortlisted in the category of Best Country Instrumental Performance.

Records date back to the 1840s of women living on the Curragh nearby the army camp. Many of the women were orphans because of the Great Famine, resulting in them using prostitution to provide for themselves. The women developed a lifestyle in which money, homes, belongings, food, and childcare were shared. The community of women was originally covered by Charles Dickens in his journal, later being covered in novels, a poem, music, a podcast, and art.  Etymology  The Wrens of Curragh were a community who lived on the Curragh (plains) of Kildare. The women were called \\"wrens\\" because they slept in hollows in the ground which were half in banks or ditches, covered in furze bushes, like the nests that birds in the wren family make.  History  Records of women living on the Curragh, close to the army camp, date back to the 1840s. The Curragh Camp became permanent in 1856, which meant that the women's presence became continuous. The last records of their presence extend to the 1880s. Many of these women were orphaned during the Great Famine and used prostitution as a means to provide for themselves. Some of the women lived on the plains seasonally, with up to 60 women there in the summer months. Outside of harvest-time, unemployed agricultural workers may have raised the number.  Lifestyle  The women developed a lifestyle in which money, homes, belongings, food, and childcare were shared. There was no formal leader. Whilst the women were ostracised from the community in town, they also avoided contact where possible, for example, in terms of medical care the women administered remedies they made or bought. Whilst the women were mainly dependent on the soldiers for money, they also knitted garments which they sold at markets to gain some financial independence. Still, it was the Army which supplied them with fresh water and allowed them to buy goods at the camp market two to three times a week. This network of mutual aid may have been even stronger in some ways than the more traditional support networks in the surrounding areas. The women were unpopular locally and in 1855 one rate-payer complained that not only did the women cause moral corruption, they were paid for by rate-payer's taxes. In 1857 the Presbyterian chaplain of the camp wrote to The Times complaining about their presence around the camp. Charles Dickens also wrote about the women in his journal, All the Year Round, in 1864.  Journalistic attention  In 1867 the journalist James Greenwood of the Pall Mall Gazette visited the Wrens and recorded their lifestyle. Prior to his visit, in the same year, the situation of the \\"Wrens\\" and the soldiers was discussed in the British Medical Journal; in the article, some of the women are portrayed as thieves. Greenwood noted their poverty and the prostitution which funded their lives. In a later pamphlet, Greenwood stated that not all of the women were prostitutes. Some of the women were in common-law marriages with soldiers at the camp, but due to army regulations could not live with the men.  Impact of public attention  The Medical Times & Gazette featured a response to Greenwood's article, who focused on the moral debasement of the wrens, as well as discussing the lack of sanitation and the effects on public health. The impact of Greenwood's visit and the publication of his articles led to public discussion and the introduction of the Curragh of Kildare Act (1868). This introduced a \\"lock hospital\\" to treat the women for sexually transmitted diseases. Treatment was poor and they were often blamed for incidents of sexually transmitted diseases amongst the soldiers.  Popular culture  The lives of the \\"Wrens of the Curragh\\" have inspired a range of creative responses:  Novels  In 1873, they are mentioned in a short story, \\"The Humby Election\\", by George Fraser. In 2010, author Martin Mallone wrote the novel The Only Glow of the Day about life on the Curragh. Likewise, Rose Doyle wrote the novel Friends Indeed in 2011. In 2018, novelist Orla McAlinden published The Flight of the Wren, which re-imagined the lives of the women.  Poetry  In 2007, the poet Mebh McGuckian featured the Wrens in her volume The Currach Requires No Harbour.  Music  The singer Jane McNamee composed a song, \\"The Curragh Wrens\\". Likewise, Ollie Kennedy wrote the song \\"The Curragh Wrens\\" from the perspective of a soldier at the camp; despite the title, the lyrics of the song do not directly refer to the women at all. Lankum's song \\"Hunting the Wren\\" alludes to the Wrens of the Curragh.  Podcasts  In 2019, the first episode of the podcast Historical Whores discussed the Curragh Wrens.  Visual arts  In 2020, the artist Amanda Coogan continued her work on a project about the women.

The memorial is slated for removal, as of June 2020. Description and history Zebulon Baird Vance was Governor of North Carolina during the American Civil War and a United States Senator from 1880 until 1894, when he died. He also lived in Asheville. Construction of the obelisk began December 22, 1897, with a band playing \\"Dixie\\" as the cornerstone was laid. The location is present-day Pack Square, on land owned by the city. The inscription on the plaque reads: Controversy Vance owned slaves and during the Reconstruction era opposed allowing African Americans to have rights that others had. Historian Sasha Mitchell claims Vance was grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan. In January 2014, the African American Heritage Commission began, with the job of creating a monument for African Americans to provide balance for the Vance Monument. As of 2020, this has not been done. Mitchell, the commission's former chair, believed regulations and lack of staff support got in the way. After the city made plans in 2015 to restore the monument, a petition for a marker honoring black people in Buncombe County received 2000 signatures, but no action was taken. The Unite the Right rally in 2017 led to the city creating a subcommittee to study what to do with Confederate markers and monuments. Mitchell wanted a series of small markers to tell the story of African Americans, including the fact that slaves were sold in the area. Again, nothing has been done. During the 2020 George Floyd protests, the monument was tagged with spray paint. In June 2020, the Asheville City Council voted for a resolution that included having a task force determine if the monument should be removed or repurposed. A 2015 North Carolina law would not permit this action unless the monument is privately owned, and city attorney Brad Branham said it was not clear who owned the monument and additional research was needed. The United Daughters of the Confederacy paid for the monument but did not own the land. City Council member Keith Young, who is African-American, said he believed that those who erected the monument were saying to black people, \\"We still have power. We still have control. And this is your place in our society.\\" N.C. Senator Jim Davis, primary sponsor of the 2015 law, said he believed history needed to be preserved and trying to rewrite history and removing monuments would not \\"alleviate the fact that slavery was\\". Another option suggested was that the monument remain but Vance's name be removed. On July 8, workers began the process of covering the monument \\"in order to reduce its impact on the community and to reduce the risk of harm it presents in its current state.\\" This action resulted from a joint resolution passed by the city and county which calls for a task force to study alternatives. The resolution also resulted in the removal of two other monuments, a Robert E. Lee monument in Pack Square and one honoring the 60th Regiment and the Battle of Chickamauga at the courthouse, in July. The city council appointed six members and two alternates to the task force on July 28. On July 29, the Vance Monument was one of the stops on a tour in which an image of Floyd appeared on a monument, \\"replacing\\" the monument temporarily.

The Soviet leader Stalin was accused for betrayal of the October Revolution and the sociopolitical work of his regime, especially the secret police NKVD, was compared with the ones organized by German Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and the Italian Fascism leader Benito Mussolini, who at this time made active political struggle against Communism in their countries and were both ideological and political enemies of the Soviet Union. In making the opposition against Stalinism, the leaflet had made use of purely socialist ideas. In particular, it had used as the title the communist ideological slogan \\"Workers of the world, unite\\" borrowed from The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels which laid the ideological foundations of Stalin's All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks). Creation of the leaflet was greatly motivated by the UPTI affair, which resulted in a serial liquidation of then leading Soviet scientists. Its propagation was planned on the International Workers' Day 1 May 1938, but did not come into the effect because was discovered by the NKVD which arrested the authors. The investigation, which included then usually applied brutal hearings, showed that the leaflet was compiled by Korets and edited by Landau. Some historians have supposed that its creation was a result of the wide provocation action performed among the Jewish scientists by the NKVD, which aimed at a many-year imprisonment at the Gulag concentration camps system for the forced labor in the Soviet military industry. Korets pointed out that the Jewish poet Pavel Kogan was the NKVD's instigator for the leaflet. Together with Landau and Korets also the Soviet physicist Yuri Rumer was arrested. Landau was released thanks to Pyotr Kapitsa's support, but both Korets and Rumer were imprisoned for the forced labor.  Original text  English translation  Workers of the world, unite Comrades! Great work of the October Revolution is badly betrayed. Country is flooded with river of blood and dirt. Millions of innocent people are thrown into prisons, no one knows when his turn will come. Economy is falling apart. Hunger is going on. Don not you see, Comrades, that Stalin's clique made a fascist coup. Socialism remained only on pages of totally lying press. In his furious hatred against true socialism, Stalin became equal to Hitler and Mussolini. Devastating country to keep his power, Stalin makes it an easy prey of inhuman German fascism. The only way out for the working class and all the workers of our country is a decisive struggle against Stalin's and Hitler's fascism, the struggle for socialism. Comrades, organize! Do not fear executioners from NKVD. They can only beat defenseless prisoners, catch unsuspecting innocent people, plunder national wealth and invent ridiculous trials against nonexistent conspiracies. Comrades, join the Antifascist Workers Party. Get in touch with its Moscow Committee. Organize at meetings of AWP groups. Set up underground technique. By agitation and propaganda prepare mass movement towards socialism. Stalin's fascism is based on our disorder.

Lanzetta engages with a variety of mediums including painting, silkscreen, digital photography, and ceramics. Lanzetta’s works are represented in the public collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London; the Yale University Art Gallery; the Harvard Art Museums; the New York Public Library Print Collection; and the Hallmark Art Collection.  Education  Lanzetta was born in Waterbury, Connecticut in 1957 and received a BA in Fine Arts in 1979 from the College of the Holy Cross. In 1981 she attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine. Lanzetta received an MFA in 1989 from the School of Visual Arts, New York. In 1989–90 Lanzetta received a Fulbright-Hays Award to study at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf in the class of Tony Cragg. Lanzetta has cited Ronald Bladen, Ursula von Rydingsvard, and Judy Pfaff as important influences.  Career  \\"Lanzetta’s work embodies an innovative marriage of digital technology\\" with traditional painting and printmaking. Manipulated, fragmented patterns, \\"often rendered in industrial or printer’s saturated colors\\" are silkscreened or hand stenciled on canvas or textiles. In mixed media, textile-based paintings, such as Light in Wartime, Lanzetta “examines ideas of ethnicity, non-ethnicity, migration, designs and cross culture…sourcing saris and fabrics and reassembling them in aesthetic combinations.” Light in Wartime, Acrylic and crystal mica on rayon, satin, and sari fabric With this fragmentation, Lanzetta \\"undermines the sense of order and decorum normally associated with decorative and architectural patterns\\"; her paintings \\"transform the decorative into something far removed from paradise.\\" The fragmentation of nature, as symbol, inspiration, and eclipser of culture is also a persistent theme in Lanzetta’s work. In the painting Opposite Temperature Zones, the “splintered sakura [Japanese cherry blossoms] of the painting also bring to mind larger issues of genetic piracy, the dangers of invasive species and environmental degradation that threaten these and all other harbingers of future springs.” Lanzetta’s physically insistent painting processes are rooted in her early sculptural work with wrapped and woven industrial rubber: \\"Thinking of [Lanzetta’s] works in terms of sculpture makes sense because her paintings and prints never really offer an invitation into an illusionistic space.\\" Lanzetta’s \\"deceptively fluid and painterly works\\" mirror a politically hybridized world and \\"re-emerge as new, patched together 'wholes' that much more reflect a global cacophony of cultures and religions.\\" Opposite Temperature Zones, Oil and acrylic on canvas With reference to Minimalism's edge to edge compositions and \\"steeped in an insistent, physical repetition,\\" Lanzetta’s all-over designs and mantra-like painting practice reflect her immersion in Eastern religions. The concept of place and culture is critical to understanding Lanzetta’s practice. Similar to Pattern and Decoration artists, Lanzetta draws inspiration from outside the United States. While New York-based, Lanzetta has lived and worked as an artist in India, Syria, Japan, Italy, and various countries in Southeast Asia and North Africa. As a result, global and spiritual influences of Buddhism, textiles, world politics, and 'details of Indian architecture, motifs from historic Mughal carpets and plant forms,\\" are persistent sources of inspiration. Each new country becomes a site for artistic investigation, as \\"one of the artist’s preoccupations is how to read and understand a constantly changing, visually insistent, multitudinous world.\\" \\"As Lanzetta has fed her increasingly omnivorous appetite from an ever-widening field of visual cultures…she has also dug deeper into these sources’ histories, exploring how form speaks to notions of aesthetics, power, and beauty.\\"  Exhibitions and Commissions  Margaret Lanzetta’s work has been exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art and the Queens Museum, New York; the Bangkok National Museum (pop up exhibition); the Weatherspoon Art Museum, North Carolina; and the Nicolaysen Art Museum, Wyoming. The New York MTA Arts & Design commissioned Lanzetta's first public, permanent work, Culture Swirl, a series of seven faceted glass-paneled windscreens, for the Norwood Avenue subway station in 2007. In 2020 Norte Maar commissioned new work by Lanzetta for CounterPointe 8, in collaboration with choreographer Mari Meade. Lanzetta silkscreened on harlequin print rayon, silver brocade, and magenta Thai silk to create swirling textile panels incorporated into the dance. The collaboration, entitled Strategy Royale, premiered to Alessio Natalizia’s \\"24\\" by Not Waving. In 2010, a twenty-year survey exhibition, titled Pet The Pretty Tiger, was mounted at the Cantor Gallery in Worcester, Massachusetts. Lanzetta’s work has been exhibited in numerous galleries in New York, and international venues in Tokyo, London, Dusseldorf, Rome, Singapore and Rabat (Morocco). Lanzetta’s work was included in the 2016 Kochi-Muziris International Biennale Collateral Projects, India.  Fellowships and Awards  Lanzetta was an inaugural recipient of a Fulbright Global Scholar Award to India, Singapore, and Thailand, from 2016–2019. Earlier awards include a MESA Fulbright Scholar Award to Syria and India in 2007, and an Abbey Fellowship in Painting in 2003 for residency at the British School at Rome. Lanzetta has been awarded fellowships and residencies from the MacDowell Colony, the Ucross Foundation, Greenwich House Pottery, and Dieu Donné. Lanzetta has taught at Parsons School of Design, Western Carolina University, and held visiting artist appointments at Mount Holyoke College and the University of Southern Maine.

She is well-known as a key political and military figure during the Abyssinian–Adal war, as well as the reigns of her sons and grandson. Name Seble Wongel is frequently confused with her 20th-century desendent, Sabla Wangel Hailu. To differentiate the two famous women, people sometimes refer to the earlier empress as Seble Wongel 'Teleq' (the great) or 'Kedamawit' (the first), while the modern figure is referred to with the suffixes 'Hailu', derived from her father's name, 'Dagmawit' (the second), or 'Tinishi' (the little). Life Seble Wongel's origins are obscure. Chronicles written in the 16th century imply that she was neither a member of the traditional nobility nor any group integrated with the Christian kingdom under the authority of the Ethiopian Emperor, meaning that her marriage was a major dynastic and political alliance. By contrast with previous emperors, Seble Wongel was the only wife, which won Lebna Dengel praise from contemporary Christian writers. Popular tradition from the 18th century onwards holds that she came from Gojjam, though this association with the region may stem from the fact that she later settled there. The 20th-century record The Goggam Chronicle by Aleqa Tekle Iyesus suggests that Seble Wongel was a descendant of Ğara Šum from Enemay. While it is not clear if Seble Wongel actually came from Gojjam, it has been suggested that these later claims do not contradict 16th-century chronicles that record Seble Wongel as coming from outside the Ethiopian realm of direct control, as Gojjam enjoyed a high degree of autonomay at the time, and possibly not all of the area was Christian. Abyssinian–Adal War The reign of Lebna Dengel and his successor Gelawdewos were marked by wars between the Ethiopian Empire and the muslim Adal Sultanate. From 1529 to 1543, the Adal swept through Ethiopian lands, leading almost to the destruction of the state. In 1539, Seble Wongel's mother was killed when the Adal attacked the region, and the eldest of Seble Wongel's sons was captured and killed by the warlord Garad Utman. The same year, another son, Menas was captured by Imam Ahmed. In 1542, Ethiopian and Portuguese forces fought the army of Imam Ahmed of the Adal Sultanate at Wofla. The Adal were victorious, and 120 Portuguese soldiers fled with Seble Wongel to the region of Semen. Gelawdewos originally left Semen, but rejoined his mother in October 1542, pursued by Imam Ahmed. On 17 November 1542, Gelawdewos' forces and the Portuguese defeated the Adal, killing key leaders before returning to Shawada. After this, the Ethiopian-Portuguese army won several decisive battles, concluding with the death of Imam Ahmed and subsequent route of the army at Wayna Daga on 21 February 1543. Imam Ahmed's wife, Bati del Wambara, escaped with 40 Turkish soldiers and 300 horsemen. The eldest son of Bati del Wambara and Imam Ahmed was captured at Wayna Daga, and Seble Wongel used him to barter for the life of her son Menas, who had been held captive by the Adal for 5 years. Through her influence, as well as that of Bati del Wambara, a prisoner exchange was conducted, and Menas was returned to Ethiopia. Menas' reign Menas established the kingdom's base in the region of Mengiste Semayat, and Seble Wongel left with him in 1559. By 1563, Seble Wongel had made her official residence in this region at Kidane Mehret church.

It is a treatise on the science of governance, structured towards upholding the morals through implementing theories of political science. The code is authored by Shukracharya also known as Usanas and claimed to be originated during Vedic period. However, modern historians claim, the composition dating as early as the 4th century AD Gupta period and some have even claimed it to be a forgery from as recent as a 19th- century. The term Niti is derived from the Sanskrit word which, in English translates to To Lead implying proper guidance. ShukraNiti focuses on morality, which it stresses is necessary for the overall well being of the people and the state (Rajya). Thus, attempts to regulate the economic, social, and political aspects of human activity. According to ShukraNiti, the main responsibilities of the king should be towards the protection of his subjects and punishment of the offenders, and such actions cannot be enacted without a guideline (Niti). According to Shukracharya: a person can live without grammar, logic, and Vedanta but cannot do in absence of Niti, and describes it as an essential aspect required for maintaining social order in the society.. History=Claims of much later period of origin Lallanji Gopal cites many authorities and disputes the origin of ShukraNiti to the Vedic period and claims the work to be originated at a much later date. The claims of this theory is based on the mention of guns, gunpowder, and cannons in the work. Modern historians argue, though some incendiary arrows were used in ancient India, and there is no mention of fire-arms using gunpowder in those texts. Since guns were introduced to India by the Portuguese in the early 16th century and later used in the first Battle of Panipat. Hence, according to them, the origin of the ShukraNiti is attributed to the 16th century AD. Similarly, J C. Ray places the origin to 11th century AD based on the use of the word Yavana and Mleccha in the ShukraNiti. According to him, the term Yavana or Mleccha's is referred to Greeks and Muslims respectively during the 11th century, by this time Mlecchas had spread in most parts of India, he concludes relating them to Yemini Turks, that is to Mahmud of Ghazni. Some historians, based on the reference made to various classifications of punishment meted out to the offenders and on other regulations mentioned in the ShukraNiti, conclude that the work was modern in approach, hence a nineteenth-century composition. Claims of origin from Vedic preiod Dr. Gustav Oppert, who was the first to compile and edit the original work of Shukracharya's ShukraNiti in Sanskrit and placed the origin of the work to the Vedic period. According to some scholarly interpretations, the ShukraNiti is frequently mentioned in Hindu epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata and was originally written by Bramha in a voluminous 100,000 chapters, which later was reduced to a readable one thousand chapters by Shukracharya. Dr. Oppert in his other work on ancient India further elaborates on the much contentious issue on the mention of the use of firearms in ShukraNiti. He provides archaeological evidences from the ancient temple carvings in India, where soldiers are depicted carrying or in some cases firing the firearms. Thus, proving his claim on the use of firearms in ShukraNiti as authentic and establishing the use of firearms, gunpowder was known in India since the ancient Vedic period. This theory is further supported by some modern historians, in which the use of gunpowder, firearms, and cannons are described as weapons used in warfare in some Vedic literature. On the issue of antiquity, R. G Pradhan observes, as the more recent work Kamandaka Nitisara praises and quotes extensively from the ShukraNiti and he further asserts, the age of the ShukraNiti should be much earlier than the former. Similarly, other historians, on the basis that Kautilyas Arthashastra opens with salutations to Shukracharya and Brhaspati, in accordance with that, Shama Shastri concludes that the ShukraNiti has to be older than the Arthashastra and placed the origin of Shukracharya's work to be of 4th-century BC. Overview The ShukraNiti as a comprehensive codebook lays out guidelines in both political and non-political aspects required in maintaining social order in the state. The political part of the book deals with guidelines relating to a king, the council of ministers, the justice system, and international laws. Whereas, the non-political part deals with morals, economics, architecture, other social, and religious laws. These laws are elaborately enshrined into five chapters in this epic. :*The first chapter deals with the duties and functions of the king. :*The second elaborates on the duties of the crown prince and other administrators of the state. :*The third chapter puts forth the general rules of morality. :*The fourth is the largest chapter in the work, which is divided into seven parts. ::*The first subsection describes the maintenance of the treasure. ::*The second on social customs and institutions in the kingdom. ::*The third subsection details about the arts and sciences. ::*The fourth lays out the guidelines for the characteristics required in the friends of the king. ::*The fifth subsection describes the functions and duties of the king. ::*The sixth on maintenance and security of forts. ::*The seventh subsection lays out the functions and composition of the army. :*The concluding chapter seven deals with miscellaneous and supplementary rules on morality as laid down in Shastras to promote the overall welfare of the people and the state. Relevance Though the book has centuries of history attached to it, the contents of it are still relevant in current-day politics, especially in the Indian context. Shukracharya lays out the virtues and qualities required in the king and crown prince, which would make a liberal and democratic leader. Most of the verses of chapter I and II are considered relevant in current day administrations of any democratic state in the world. For example, in chapter 2 the codebook says, the king should not take any policy decisions unilaterally without consulting his council of ministers and a ruler who arbitrarily makes the decision, shall be alienated from his kingdom and the people. Similarly, the ShukraNiti places people as the ultimate source of the power. In chapter-I it states; the ruler is placed as the servant to the people. One of the most discussed topics relevant to current times is the stress given on Karma in ShukraNiti. Shukracharya states, one does not become a Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya or a Shudra by his Jati or by mere birth, but he asserts these are derived from much fundamental concepts like ones character (Guna) and deeds (Karma). Thus, dismissing the general view that caste is derived by birth, and equating it to the merit and qualities in a person. The book further advises the king to appoint his subordinates in any post irrespective of his caste.

She born in Dillingen an der Donau, and lived most of her life in Vienna. Early life Antonia was the daughter of the music educator and church musician Joseph Anton Laucher, and his second wife Maria Kunigunda Laucher. She had her early musical training with her father, before studying under Johann Baptist Lasser (1751–1805) in Munich. Lasser wrote a book for the teaching of female singers which still survives, giving an insight into the kind of lessons Laucher would have likely received. Career After brief involvement in the opera scene in Munich, Laucher moved to Vienna with her younger sister Cäcilia, where they were both employed as singers by the Vienna Court Opera. Because their careers were intertwined, the sisters usually went by their first names Antonia and Cäcilia, and the were also referred to in the press as 'Laucher the elder' and 'Laucher the younger' respectively. In his memoirs, Johann Gänsbacher reported on a charity concert on November 15, 1804, in the Vienna Redoutensaal , in which Antonia Laucher participated, and claimed to have taught Antonia Laucher singing for two years. Frequent newspaper reports in Vienna document the success of Laucher's career from the beginning of her Vienna career, and also mention her sister frequently. Between 1805 and 1808 Antonia and Cäcilia Laucher worked together in Salzburg. Antonia appeared in Joseph Haydn's oratorios and Cäcilia in Johann Nepomuk Hummel's cantata Endimione e Diana. After her death, it was said that the Emperor Napoleon saw a performance of the opera L'arbore di Diana by Vicente Martín y Soler , at the Schönbrunn Palace Theater in October 1809. Laucher played the role of Cupid, and reportedly spoke at length to Napoleon after the performance. Napoleon was in Vienna for negotiations after the War of the Fifth Coalition, and the Treaty of Schönbrunn was signed just a few days before this performance. In 1813 she sang in Brno, in Gyrowetz's Agnes Sorel and Der Augenarzt and in Mozart's Don Giovanni. Her last known attempt at artistic activity is a brief attempt to establish herself as an actress with theatre appearances in 1822, and after this it is presumed that she was inactive. Personal life Laucher is believed to have had illegitimate children, and it is known her sister had at least one illegitimate daughter, . The sisters were described to have three children between them in 1825, years before Antonia married. On February 16, 1832, the 45-year-old Antonia Laucher married Gabriel Edlen von Nespern, who was 13 years her junior. According to the marriage register, the couple lived at 966 in Himmelpfortgasse. Her husband died in 1839, and she began a long widowhood with a modest pension. Death She died in obscurity at the age of 85 in August 1871, having lived since her husband's death in the Hietzing district of Vienna.

The mound and village area were constructed during the prehistoric Mississippian culture period. The site features include a village with a central plaza area, a rectangular platform mound, the borrow pit where the fill for the mound was quarried, and a surrounding wooden palisade. The pottery of the Big Eddy phase (1450 - 1560) is related to the pottery of the Moundville III phase (1450-1550 CE) of the large paramount chiefdom at the Moundville Site located to the northwest of Tuskigi on the Black Warrior River. Moundville was being abandoned during this period and the Big Eddy phase people are thought to be intrusive to the Coosa River area, and had originated at Moundville. The Big Eddy phase has been tentatively identified as the protohistoric Province of Tuskaloosa encountered by the Hernando de Soto expedition in 1540, located downriver from the Coosa province. The site was occupied in the historic period by the Alabama and Muscogee (Creek) villages, named respectively Pakana and Taskigi, from which the site takes its name.

The subject matter is that of the everyday: vehicles, plastic water bottles, car engines, dogs, bears, and other animals that come from different areas of interest: technology, industry, and the natural world. “He cleverly manipulates prevailing contemporary ideology to grand effect, making aesthetically pleasing art with socially critical impact.”  Content and media  Packer’s process includes distinct and different, but all inter-related, media, beginning with an enormous collection of photographic images, both analog and digital. As he notes, “My process now is much more image based, in terms of what I will see in an object, if I find an object with resonance, with a depth of meaning.” The resonance, that informs the content of all the work, regardless of media, may include “industry, corporations, how the land is being used, how corporations are taking stuff from the land.” Large scale, serial works on paper, including mixed media collages, drawings, and highly detailed plans are “patiently and methodically constructed with mechanical precision” and “beautifully conceived and meticulously drawn.” These drawings are crucial to the design and construction of the ensuing sculptures as well as functioning at the same time as independent works of art. The artist books that Packer has made, some unique, some collaged, and some limited edition, parallel the work on paper. As a sculptor, Packer works primarily in ceramics, and has been described “as a master practitioner of architectural and technical ceramics”; however, he also has used found lumber and discarded industrial metal, highlighting his “investigation of the visual qualities of old and new technologies,” often with “redundant technology imaging redundant industry.” The themes that are important to the artist—industry, technology, nature and humankind’s relationship to these issues—find full form in the sculptures that include rusty metal trucks, dancing bears, Vietnam-era helicopters, and malarial mosquitoes. Bears that Dance, Ceramic, 44 x 34 x 28\\", 2010 Even though “illuminating ecological conditions is no mean accomplishment,” Packer’s work has a strong element of warning, like other “future-conscious artists and creative thinkers”—an awareness of the existence of the “post-industrial moment, a post-industrial vacuum, where not even the cleaners are working.” The ceramic sculpture Bears that Dance is a direct example of warning, with two white polar bears linked together in some ill-defined and strange symbiotic human like relationship. Ultimately Packer “allows his work to become that which it calls into question: namely the rational over the natural.”  Exhibitions and residencies  Since 1983, Packer has exhibited both nationally and internationally, with over 15 one-person shows and over 50 group shows. Two notable exhibitions in New York City are a one person show at Garth Clark Gallery in 2002, where he also had three other group shows, and participation in the group show, Exit Biennial II, Traffic, at Exit Art, 2005, curated by Papo Colo and Jeanette Ingberman. In 2006, a three-month residency at the Kohler Arts/Industry program allowed the artist to realize a significant and ambitious project: full-size cast ceramic sculptures of V8 car engines. This work, called The Last of the V8s, was both more complex and more ambitious than anything he had tried before. In Packer’s own words: “I never thought how appropriate it would be to manufacture a quintessentially American industrial object in a factory setting.” These sculptures were also included in the show The Moment at Hand at the John Michael Kohler Arts Center, as well as subsequently in galleries in New York, Chicago, and Seattle. The predominant use of industrial imagery in such projects and “the never-ending, osmotic flow that underwrites cultural exchange” creates in Packer’s work “a 21st Century elegy for American industrial might” where “the dominant note becomes poignancy.” The Last of the V8s, Cast Ceramic with Auto Paint, 21 x 40 x 28\\" each, 2006 Described as an artist “not unaccustomed to functioning outside of his element,” Packer has also shown overseas, often as part of an extended stay at an international residency. This includes three one person shows in Morocco, two in 2012, in Rabat at LeCube Independent Art Room and in Fez as part of the Fez Sacred Music Festival, and in 2019 at Jardin Anima, Marrakech. He has also shown in Tokyo, during a residency at Youkobu Artist in Residence, as well as in Vallauris, France, with a show called Pèlerinage. Other residencies include MacDowell, Yaddo, and Virginia Center for the Creative Arts.  Collections and curating  Packer’s work is included in the public collections of the Carnegie Museum of Art, the John Michael Kohler Arts Center, and the Museum of Art and Design. Private collections include those of Sonny Kamm, Kate Shepherd, Nawal Slaoui, and Jack Zipes. Between 2015 and 2018, Packer curated three exhibitions at Spring/Break Art Show.  Travel and other projects  Traveling, both for its own sake or as an artist, is an important part of Packer’s practice. He has visited four continents: some countries visited include Australia, Belgium, Cambodia, France, Greece, India, Mexico, Spain, Syria, and Thailand. The first time Packer was a Fulbright Scholar to Morocco, in Fez in 2011, after three exhibitions of his own work there, he wrote a book on the diversity of Moroccan ceramics. The Earth has Three Colors: a celebration of Moroccan ceramics is the first full-length publication to provide a comprehensive overview of the ceramics of Morocco; this hardbound edition, with 280 pages and ten chapters, written in English with a French translation, was published in 2019 by Mazda Publishers. That same year, he received a Core Fulbright Scholar award to Morocco to continue research and promote his book. Since the book was published, including a successful crowdfunding campaign, Packer has given numerous lectures, including Greenwich House Pottery in the United States, and the American Legation, Tangier and the Villa des Arts, Rabat in Morocco.  Biography, education, and teaching  Packer was born in Amersham, England in 1960 and has lived in the United States since 1983, including Washington DC, Miami, Tallahassee and, since 1994, New York City. He is a dual British and American citizen and currently maintains a studio in Long Island City. Art school in the United Kingdom included Buckinghamshire College of Further Education (1979-80) and Bristol School of Art (1980-83) where Packer received a BFA in ceramics. He finished his formal education in the United States at Florida State University, graduating with an MFA in Studio Art in 1994. Packer has taught ceramics, including tile making and wheel throwing, drawing, and computer art: schools include Greenwich House Pottery, the Crafts Students League, both in New York City, and Western Carolina University, including the graduate program. Packer met his wife, artist Margaret Lanzetta, at Exit Art in 1995.

History The band was created in 1969with the following formation: Helio Santisteban (keyboard), Paulo Fernandes (drums), Oswaldo Malagutti (bass) and Wagner \\"Bitão\\" Benatti (guitar), with the four taking turns on vocals. They started doing covers for bands from the United States and England and started composing in English. His first LP, \\"Dead Faces\\", released in 1973 by RCA, contained only songs in English. A simple compact extracted from this album, with the song \\"My Mistake\\" (only apparently simplistic: it tells the story of a passionate murder, but resuming the primitive blues tradition of using everyday tragedies to reflect on the meaning of life); compact that reached the top of the charts, selling 400,000 copies in just three months. Then, other songs were released in compacts, such as \\"She Made Me Cry\\", \\"I Never Did Before\\" and \\"Forever\\", all reaching sales exceeding 300 thousand copies. In 1975, the debut album was released on the Hispanic market under the title \\"Hojas\\", giving the group another Gold Record. In 1977 the group changed its orientation, releasing the LP \\"O Som das Discotheques\\", with covers of the main hits of the genre, and reaching 150 thousand copies sold. Shortly thereafter, Hélio Santisteban decided to pursue a solo career and Marinho Testoni, ex-Casa das Máquinas, took his place. This led to another change in the group, which released a progressive rock album, and for the first time with lyrics in Portuguese. The album sold much less than the previous ones, but it became cult for a segment of public. In 1978 it was Oswaldo Malagutti who left the band, being replaced by bassist João Alberto, also ex-\\"Casa das Máquinas\\". Malagutti created with Santisteban the MOSH Studio (acronym of their names) and even today works with production and mastering of musical CDs and DVDs. In 1980 Hélio Santisteban returned to the group, which resumed the tradition of singing and composing in English, then releasing the LP \\"Memories\\". A few months later, with Marinho's departure, Pholhas reached the following formation: Bitão (guitar), Paulo Fernandes (drums), Hélio Santisteban (keyboards) and João Alberto (bass). At the end of 2007 Hélio Santisteban leaves the band definitively, from then on, Bitão, Paulinho and João Alberto decide not to have a fixed keyboardist anymore, but a keyboardist specially invited for each performance. This formula worked so well that it became an attraction more of the shows. Still on the road after 42 years, the band PHOLHAS continues to present shows all over Brazil and abroad, with recreations of hits from English and American rock, especially from Bee Gees, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Elvis Presley, Rolling Stones and Beatles. On August 26, 2018, its keyboardist and vocalist Helio Santisteban dies at 69 years of age.

Biography  He was born on December 6, 1933 in Lethbridge, Alberta, Dennis Burton won a scholarship to Pickering College in Newmarket, and then attended the Ontario College of Art, studying with Jock Macdonald and Fred Hagan. He worked as a graphic designer for the Canadian Broadcasting Company until 1960 when he began painting full-time. An exhibition in 1955 of Painters Eleven at Toronto's Hart House (today the Justina M. Barnicke Gallery, Art Museum at the University of Toronto) which he visited with his friend, artist Gordon Rayner, turned him towards abstraction. Under the influence of the neo-Dada movement current in Toronto in the late 1950s and first half of the 1960s, Burton began to create sculpture using scrap metal and found materials welded together. He showed his work with Toronto's Isaacs Gallery (1961, 1962, 1965). For this reason, he has been called part of the Isaacs Group of artists, which include, among others, Michael Snow, Joyce Wieland, John Meredith and Graham Coughtry. Rayner had a number of public commissions, among them a mural for the Edmonton Airport in 1963. He is best known for the Garterbeltmania works of females in their underwear which he showed with the Robert McLaughlin Gallery in Oshawa in his retrospective in 1977. With artists such as Joyce Wieland, he explored the erotic theme in Canadian art. These works made politician John Diefenbaker denounce Dennis Burton in the House of Commons, coining the term \\"garter belt-maniac\\". But both before and after these works, he created large abstractions that might involve using different creative strategies involving language, colour and form. Burton\`s papers are in the Dennis Burton fonds, Edward P. Taylor Library & Archives, Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, CA ON00012 SC100. On July 8, 2013, Dennis Burton died at age 79.

The band consists of founding members Brady Keehn (vocals, guitar, electronics) and Melissa Scaduto (drums, electronics). The band takes its name from the aspect of the same name in astrology. History Sextile was formed in 2015 by Keehn and Scaduto, after the duo relocated from Brooklyn, New York to Los Angeles. They were soon joined by bassist Kenny Elkin and multi-instrumentalist Eddie Wuebben. Signing to Felte Records after supporting Ritual Howls at local gigs, the band released its debut album, A Thousand Hands in the same year. Its follow-up, Albeit Living, was released in 2017; by the time of its release, Elkin was replaced by bassist Cameron Michel. In 2018, Sextile released the single \\"Current Affair,\\" with the band reduced to its two founding members for their EP, 3, later in the year. Sextile entered a hiatus in 2019, with Keehn and Scaduto pursuing other projects, Panther Modern and S. Product, respectively. The band's former guitarist, Eddie Wuebben, died in 2019. Musical style Sextile's sound has been described as post-punk and electronic rock. Their debut album featured an \\"occult-inspired post-punk style\\" that blended industrial, surf-punk, psychobilly and ambient music; the band drew influences from Christian Death, Coil, Brian Eno, The Cramps and The Haxan Cloak during this period. AllMusic critic Heather Phares thought that the record \\"gave death rock some new life\\" while featuring \\"descending riffs, martial beats, and outbursts that light up the darkness like flares.\\" Their second album, Albeit Living, marked a change in style with a synth-punk sound that was likened to the works of Circle X, D.A.F. and Chrome. Michael Toland of The Austin Chronicle wrote that the record collects \\"post-punk's angular chords, synth-pop's buzzing colors, No Wave's brash indifference, and goth's pessimistic glower.\\" Its follow-up, 2018's 3 EP, showcased further embracement of electronics while introducing elements from EBM and darkwave.

Published by Harbour Publishing, the book is an adaptation of a Pacific Northwest Indigenous story. Orca's Song is a pourquoi story about a black orca who falls in love with an osprey; the two mate to create a baby orca with the black and white patterning found on the whales. While some reviewers appreciated the art and text of the story, it received criticism from Indigenous authors and scholars who disputed Cameron's claim of sole authorship and copyright for the story. Consequently, reprints of the book began to attribute the storyteller Klopinum for the story's inspiration although Cameron retained sole authorship credit and copyright. The story has also been noted as an early example of a lesbian relationship (between Orca and Osprey) in picturebook literature and one of the few such picturebooks published before 2000 to lack a moralising tone. Plot A pourquoi story, Orca's Song explains the origins of the black and white patterning of the orca. In the story, Orca is an all-black whale who begins to pine for Osprey and begins to help her catch salmon. Osprey in turn explains the experience of flight to Orca and begins to bring her gifts from land. The two fall in love but struggle to reconcile their disparate origins. One day, Orca leaps from the sea and Osprey swoops towards the waves and their bodies come into contact. They birth a baby orca with black and white coloration who can leap higher from the water than its whale mother but cannot fly. Twice annually, in the spring and fall, women on Vancouver Island play music on the western coast and orcas go there and sway to their tunes and sing their own songs. Ospreys attend this gathering and sing along uniting the sky, land, and earth. The story ends by noting that luck is bestowed upon anyone whom a whale splashes. Writing and publication Orca's Song was written by European Canadian lesbian author Anne Cameron of British Columbia. Cameron liked adapting First Nations stories into picturebooks and had previously published the children's book How the Loon Lost Her Voice in 1985. She credited a storyteller named Klopinum whom she knew from her youth on Vancouver Island for the story on which Orca's Song was based and said that Klopinum had given Cameron permission to share the story, although this credit was not presented alongside the text of Orca's Song until reprints of the work in 1993. The work was illustrated by Nelle Olsen who used black and white line drawings for the interior images of the story and a Northwest Coast artistic style for the cover. Harbour Publishing released the 25-page book in 1987. Marlene R. Atleo, reviewing the book in 2006, wrote that it was intended for readers of second grade and above. Reception Orca's Song has received criticism from Indigenous scholars and authors. Atleo of the Ahousaht First Nation wrote that Orca's Song was a \\"very 'New Age' rendering of this story [which], even with West Coast symbols, obscures any semblance of the story it might be based on.\\" Cameron was confronted by a group of Indigenous female writers at the 1988 International Women's Book Fair regarding her claim of sole authorship and copyright for Orca's Song and other children's books adapted from First Nations stories. Printings of the book from 1993 onward credited Klopinum but Cameron retained sole authorship, copyright, and royalties for the works. Other reviewers have responded positively to the story. Writing in CM: A Reviewing Journal of Canadian Materials for Young People, Gerri Young described the work as having \\"the flavour of the country of origin, [being] easily understood by the present-day audience, and the feeling of the oral telling\\", ultimately describing Orca's Song as \\"a particularly poignant story\\". In Canadian Children's Literature, Kevin McCabe called Olsen's illustrations \\"creative and finished designs\\" that supported Cameron's text. Orca's Song was included in researcher Jeff Sapp's 2010 list of children's books with lesbian or gay (LG) characters. Sapp described the book as stunning and wrote that it was among the few stories with LG characters (Orca and Osprey) \\"that contains no overt moralising so often found\\" in children's books with LG characters published before 2000. Atleo said that while transformation was present as a theme throughout Pacific Northwest Indigenous cultures, the ability of members of the same sex to reproduce was not, leading to \\"an underlying dissonance that Cameron cannot calm\\".

The baths date back to Roman times and were the basis for developing Buxton as a Georgian and Victorian spa town. The present buildings of the Thermal Baths and the Natural Mineral Baths were opened in the 1850s. They are positioned either side of the Buxton Crescent at the foot of The Slopes in the town's Central Conservation Area. They are both Grade-II listed buildings designed by Henry Currey, architect for the 7th Duke of Devonshire.  Geothermal spring  The geothermal spring that feeds the baths rises from about 1km below ground and about a million litres of water flow out per day. The mineral water emerges at a steady 27°C. Analysis of the water has indicated that it has a high magnesium content and that it originates from rainfall around 5,000 years ago (based upon its tritium content). The source of the natural spring lies beneath the Old Hall Hotel.  Natural Mineral Baths  Natural Mineral Baths in 2020 The warm spring emerges in two main locations, which are where the 'Great Bath' (Gentlemen's Public Bath) was built in the 1600s behind the Old Hall Hotel. It was housed in the stately Arch Room which was 10 yards long by over 5 yards wide. In 1696 Cornelius White built an outer bath for the poor. The bath house was rebuilt in 1712 by John Barker. The splendid Georgian Crescent was built in the 1780s next to the baths. There were seven baths by 1793 for gentlemen and for ladies, both public and private, a charity bath for the poor, a cool bath and a 'Matlock' bath (where warm and cool waters were mixed to replicate the 19.8°C temperature of the fashionable spring at Matlock). Natural Mineral Baths in the 1850s The present Natural Mineral Baths building was designed by Henry Currey and built in ashlar gritstone from 1851 to 1852. The building included a public bath, a charity bath, two private ladies' baths and two private gentleman's baths. The building originally had a fountain in each of the three arched niches of its facade. Currey also designed the new drinking fountain of St Ann's Well in 1852, opposite the Natural Baths. In 1894 the Pump Room, also designed by Currey, was opened opposite the Crescent in order to extend the facilities where people could drink the spring water and socialise. It was built in response to overcrowding of the drinking well at the Natural Baths by both paying and charity patients. Following World War I, the baths were also used to help injured soldiers with their recovery. The building was altered in the 1920s to move the covered side entrance to the open front of the building. In 1924 the Borough Council used a loan from the Ministry of Health to upgrade the Natural Baths with a multitude of the latest electro-water treatments and Italian mud treatment. In the 1960s the Natural Baths was converted into a public swimming pool but it closed in 1972 when a new swimming pool complex was opened in the Pavilion Gardens. The Natural Mineral Baths building has now been renovated into a modern spa for the newly-restored Crescent Hotel. It incorporates the original warm spring water pool as well as an indoor and outdoor swimming pool, sauna, steam room and spa treatments.  Thermal Baths  Thermal Baths in the 1850s The Duke of Devonshire's agent Phillip Heacock lobbied for establishing coal-fired hot baths in the town in the early 1800s. The modest flat-roofed Hot Baths, designed by Charles Sylvester, were built in 1817 next to the east wing of The Crescent. In 1837 the Hot Baths were expanded, with two ladies' baths and two gentlemen's baths as well as the addition of a vapour and shower bath. These were all replaced in 1853 with the grand Thermal Baths iron and glass building designed by Henry Currey in the style of The Crystal Palace. Various hydrotherapy treatments were provided for the guests. There was a cold swimming pool at the side, which became a billiard room in the 1860s. A new water tower, waiting room and shops were added in the 1880s. The building was remodelled by William Radford Bryden in 1900 with the removal of the glass and iron colonnades and a new ashlar gritstone facade. There were separate entrances for ladies and gentlemen. A memorial to Samuel Turner (an activist in town improvements and public welfare) stands outside the Hot Baths. Designed by Robert Rippon Duke, it was erected in 1879 and has a drinking fountain on each side. After World War II, the use of the baths declined, with no funding by the new National Health Service for medical water treatments. The Hot Baths closed in 1963. The building was converted in 1986 by Derek Latham architects into specialist shops and opened as the Cavendish Arcade. The design has a modern stained- glass roof by Brian Clarke but has kept the original structure of the building, its Victorian tiling and two of the small baths.  Water medicine  The claimed health-giving properties of the chalybeate (mineral-bearing) spring water was behind the popularity of the Buxton Baths. This reputation went back for centuries. In the 1460s antiquarian William Worcester wrote of the Buxton spring waters in his book Itinerarium: \\"Memorandum that Holywell ... makes many miracles, making the infirm healthy, and in winter it is warm, even as honeyed milk.\\" Mary Queen of Scots visited St Ann's Well in Buxton most years from 1573 to 1584 to ‘take the cure’ for her rheumatism. During the Victorian era the reputation of Buxton's curative waters was given scientific credibility by Sir Charles Scudamore. In 1820 he published his analysis of the water's chemistry and its effectiveness for treating gout. Hydrotherapy became an established treatment for a variety of medical conditions. Dr William Henry Robertson moved to Buxton in 1835 and he also studied the effects of the local mineral waters on disease. He promoted their benefits in the treatment of gout, rheumatism, sciatica, etc. His Guide To The Use Of The Buxton Waters ran to twenty-four editions. By the turn of the century, over 75,000 baths were being taken each year.  Buxton Bath Charity  The Buxton Bath Charity was founded in 1779 to pay for poor people to have access to the Buxton waters. All visitors to Buxton's hotels and lodging houses were expected to contribute one shilling to the charity and sign the subscription book. In 1822 there were nearly 800 patients admitted through the charity, which paid for board and lodging, medicines and water treatments for up to five weeks. By the 1850s the numbers exceeded 1000 and half of the Great Stables was converted to a hospital for the charity. Henry Currey designed the conversion to the Devonshire Hospital which opened in 1859 with 120 beds for the poor. The charity became The Devonshire Hospital and Buxton Bath Charity. The stables on the ground floor were converted into hospital rooms between 1879 and 1882 and a great dome was added (the building is now called the Devonshire Dome). 300 hospital beds \\"for the relief of the poor\\" were now accommodated in Robert Rippon Duke's design. Sir Charles Scudamore and Dr Robertson were both honorary physicians for the charity and in 1865 Dr Robertson became chairman of The Devonshire Hospital and Buxton Bath Charity. King Edward VII (a friend of the 8th Duke of Devonshire) and Queen Alexandra came to Buxton in 1905 to tour the Devonshire Hospital and Buxton Bath Charity. The royals also visited the Thermal and Natural Baths, the Pump Room and the Pavilion Gardens. The hospital became known as the Devonshire Royal Hospital in 1934.  Roman baths  Aquae Arnemetiae (Roman Buxton) and Aquae Sulis (modern town of Bath in Somerset) were the only two Roman bath towns in Britain. The Romans built a bath at the location of the main thermal spring. In the late 17th-century Cornelius White operated bathing facilities at the hot spring at the site of the Buxton Old Hall. In 1695 he discovered an ancient smooth stone bath (20m long by 7m wide) as well as a lead cistern (2m square) on an oak timber frame. When the Crescent hotel was built on the site in 1780, a Roman bath was identified and described as ‘a leaden cistern'. The bath is now buried beneath the Crescent, next to the Natural Mineral Baths building that was constructed next to the hotel. Near to the site of the main spring, excavations in 2005 revealed the entry passage and doorways to the Roman baths. Between 2009 and 2012 further underground cisterns and a large iron cauldron were revealed. The main spring was excavated in the 1970s and a hoard of 232 Roman coins was found, spanning 300 years of the Roman occupation of Britain. Coins would have been thrown into the sacred waters to seek the favour of the Gods. The coins and pieces of bronze jewellery found with them are on display in the Buxton Museum.

Between 1681 and 1693 she served as the Abbess at Gandersheim. She was also a Princess of the Empire (Reichsfürstin).  Life  Adolf Frederick of Mecklenburg (1588 - 1658) is known to have been the father of at least sixteen legitimate children from his two marriages. Sources differ as to Christina's chronological ranking in the list of her father's children, because not all of them list all the children who died in infancy. According to one source she was her father's eleventh child, and the third by his second marriage. Her mother was Marie Katharina (1616–1665), a daughter of the Duke of Brunswick. At her mother's request, and through the mediation of her second cousin, Anton Ulric of Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel, from 1665 she acquired a benefice (income) through her appointment as the then youngest canoness of Gandersheim Abbey. Despite her relative youth, on 3 October 1665 Christina was elected deaconess at the abbey, on the recommendation of Augustus, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, who was the younger of her mother's surviving uncles. Being deaconess lined her up as deputy and likely successor to the Abbess Dorothea Hedwig, another kinswoman. However, the Abbess Dorothea Hedwig retired from the post sooner than had been anticipated. In 1677 she attended a Roman Catholic Mass and met with Jesuits while on a visit to Hamburg. Shortly after that she converted to Roman Catholicism. Gandersheim Abbey had by now become a Lutheran foundation. Duke Rudolph Augustus therefore persuaded her to resign as abbess: her resignation took place on 14 July 1678, at a time when Christina, Duchess of Mecklenburg was not yet 40. At this point it was not Christina who took over as abbess but the duke's own young daughter, Christine Sophie. She, however, remained in post only for three years: she left in order to marry a near cousin and adoptive brother, Augustus William, [subsequently - from 1714] Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, on 29 June 1681. This time, on 9 August 1681, Christina of Mecklenburg-Schwerin was elected to succeed Christine Sophie as abbess. Her installation followed on 11 October 1681, following her \\"capitulatio caesarea\\" (formal conditional acceptance of the position). Her investiture by the emperor with the appropriate regalia followed on 13 April 1683. Christina, Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Abbess of Gandersheim, died of injury or illness on 30 June 1693. Her successor as Abbess at Gandersheim was her twelve year old cousin, Henriette Christine of Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel. (Henriette Christine's own tenure as abbess came to an end in 1712 after she gave birth.)  Celebration  While still alive Christina of Mecklenburg-Schwerin took the precaution of having an elaborate baroque tomb created in the lady chapel of the abbey-church at Gandersheim jointly for herself and her sister Marie Elisabeth.Friedrich Schlie: *Die Kunst- und Geschichts-Denkmäler des Grossherzogthums Mecklenburg-Schwerin. V. Band: Die Amtsgerichtsbezirke Teterow, Malchin, Stavenhagen, Penzlin, Waren, Malchow und Röbel. Schwerin, 1902 (Digitalisat im Internet Archive, p. 613) The inscriptions are alexandrines which deal with themes of death and things past: they have been attributed to Pastor Arnold Gottfried Ballenstedt (1660–1722). Her sarcophagus placed in the tomb on 3 August 1693. That of her younger sister followed on the other side of the constriction approximately twenty years later. The tomb was extensively restored at the direction of Grand Duke Frederick Francis III in 1892.

Organized on January 16, 1862, the regiment first saw major action at the Battle of Pea Ridge on March 7 and 8, 1862. After Pea Ridge, the regiment was transferred across the Mississippi River, fighting in the Battle of Farmington, Mississippi on May 9. The unit missed the Battle of Iuka in September, but was heavily engaged at the Second Battle of Corinth on October 3 and 4. The regiment helped drive in a Union position on October 3. On October 4, the 2nd Missouri Infantry, along with the rest of Colonel Elijah Gates' brigade, captured a fortification known as Battery Powell, but were forced to retreat by Union reinforcements. On May 16, 1863, the regiment was part of a major attack at the Battle of Champion Hill. The attack was repulsed, and the regiment was routed at the Battle of Big Black River Bridge the next day. During the Siege of Vicksburg, the regiment helped repulse Union assaults on May 19 and May 22. On July 1, a mine was detonated under the regiment's position; the regiment's commander was killed during the ensuing fighting. After the Confederate garrison of Vicksburg surrendered on July 4, the men of the 2nd Missouri Infantry were paroled and exchanged. On October 1, 1863, the regiment was combined with the 6th Missouri Infantry Regiment to form the 2nd and 6th Missouri Infantry Regiment (Consolidated). The new regiment saw action during the Atlanta campaign and the Battle of Allatoona in 1864. On November 30, 1864, the combined regiment suffered devastating losses at the Battle of Franklin. The 2nd and 6th Missouri Infantry (Consolidated) surrendered at the Battle of Fort Blakely on April 9, 1865. Organization Wartime photograph of Francis M. Cockrell The 2nd Missouri Infantry Regiment was organized and joined the Confederate States Army on January 16, 1862, while stationed at Springfield, Missouri. Many of the men in the regiment had seen prior service in the secessionist Missouri State Guard. When the regiment was first organized, it was given the designation of 1st Missouri Infantry Regiment, but this was changed to 2nd Missouri Infantry Regiment, as the another regiment had precedence to the former name. At the time of organization, the regiment was commanded by Colonel John Quincy Burbridge. Edward B. Hull was the regiment's first lieutenant colonel, and Robert D. A. Dwyer was the regiment's first major. At the time of organization, the regiment contained ten companies, designated with the letters A–I and K, all of which contained men from Missouri. Service history=1862Pea Ridge= Less than a month after the regiment was organized, the Confederates abandoned Springfield. During the ensuing retreat into Arkansas, the 2nd Missouri Infantry served as a rear guard unit. At the Battle of Pea Ridge on March 7 and 8, the regiment was part of Colonel Lewis Henry Little's First Missouri Brigade, along with the 3rd Missouri Infantry Regiment, 1st Missouri Cavalry Regiment, Wade's Missouri Battery, and Clark's Missouri Battery. In the early stages of the battle, the 2nd Missouri Infantry was deployed in a ravine when Major General Sterling Price's Confederate division, of which Little's brigade was a part, encountered Union forces along the approach to a local landmark named Elkhorn Tavern. The 2nd Missouri Infantry was later engaged in a Confederate attack against a Union line arrayed around the tavern. The charge eventually broke the Union line, and the 2nd Missouri Infantry helped capture a portion of the 3rd Iowa Battery, despite taking heavy casualties from canister fire. However, the Confederate ranks quickly became disorganized, hindering their ability to follow up on gains from the assault. On March 8, the regiment was initially positioned in an open field, but heavy Union artillery fire forced the regiment to retreat to the cover of some woods. Union troops then pressed a counterattack, forcing the 2nd Missouri Infantry, as well as the rest of Price's division, to retreat. Three companies of the regiment became separated from the rest of the unit in the retreat, and along with Good's Texas Battery and Guibor's Missouri Battery, helped to repulse a small Union cavalry charge, ending the Battle of Pea Ridge, which was a Confederate defeat. Specific casualty returns reported that the regiment lost 46 men killed, 49 wounded, and 15 missing, for a total of 110, although an overall return for the regiment reported 150 losses. =Second Corinth= Confederate dead on the field at Second Corinth After the defeat at Pea Ridge, the regiment retreated to the vicinity of Van Buren, Arkansas and was then ordered to Des Arc, Arkansas, on the other side of the state. On April 10, the regiment crossed the Mississippi River, moved to Memphis, Tennessee, and then reported to Corinth, Mississippi on April 28. A muster conducted in Corinth in early May found 923 men officially listed on the regiment's rolls, but only 590 of them were reported as present for duty. On May 9, the regiment participated in the Battle of Farmington, and left Corinth along with the rest of the Confederate army at the end of May. The 2nd Missouri Infantry then spent much of the rest of the summer stationed in northern Mississippi. Burbridge resigned on June 29 and was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Francis M. Cockrell as commander of the regiment. On September 19, the regiment arrived on the field of the Battle of Iuka after the fighting ended. At the Second Battle of Corinth on October 3 and 4, the 2nd Missouri Infantry was in Colonel Elijah Gates' brigade, along with the 16th Arkansas Infantry Regiment, 3rd Missouri Infantry Regiment, 5th Missouri Infantry Regiment, 1st Missouri Cavalry Regiment, and Wade's Missouri Battery. On October 3, the 2nd Missouri Infantry reinforced the brigade of Brigadier General Martin E. Green, and helped Green's brigade defeat a stubborn Union defensive position by enfilading the 11th Missouri Infantry Regiment. The next day, Gates' brigade, including the 2nd Missouri Infantry, charged the Union interior line. The attack was aimed for a fortification known as Battery Powell. The Confederate charge hit the division of Brigadier General Thomas A. Davies, breaking the Union line. The Confederate charge was also able to drive the Union artillerymen defending Battery Powell out of the fortification. The 2nd Missouri Infantry charged the 6th Wisconsin Battery, driving the battery's crews from the guns and taking the pieces. The Confederate charge had broken a large hole in the Union line. However, reinforcements were not sent to follow up the breakthrough, and a Union counterattack drove the 2nd Missouri Infantry and the rest of Gates' brigade from the ground they had won. At Second Corinth, the regiment lost 47 men killed, 107 wounded, and 91 missing, for a total of 245. The regiment then spent the next several months in camp. 1863Champion Hill= Battle of Champion Hill In March 1863, the regiment was transferred to Grand Gulf, Mississippi, where the regiment built fortifications. The next month, the regiment was part of an observation force sent across the Mississippi River into Louisiana. After returning from Louisiana, the regiment was stationed at Grand Gulf, and did not participate in the Battle of Port Gibson on May 1. On May 3, the regiment was part of a rear guard that protected the Confederate retreat from Grand Gulf. At the Battle of Champion Hill on May 16, the 2nd Missouri Infantry, along with the rest of the First Missouri Brigade (now commanded by Cockrell) plugged a gap in the Confederate line. Later in the afternoon, Cockrell's brigade responded with a counterattack, driving Union troops back and recapturing the cannons of Waddell's Alabama Battery, which had been captured earlier in the fighting. The attackers suffered heavy casualties in the charge, one member of Cockrell's brigade later wrote that \\"blood ran in a stream, as water would have done.\\" The charge gained momentum, eventually reaching the top of Champion Hill, a prominent landmark on the battlefield. Eventually, Union reinforcements arrived, blunting the Confederate charge and forcing the attackers to retreat. At Champion Hill, the 2nd Missouri Infantry suffered casualties of 10 men killed, 35 wounded, and 38 missing, for a total of 83. =Siege of Vicksburg= On May 17, the 2nd Missouri Infantry was part of a rear guard holding the crossing of the Big Black River in Mississippi. A Union attack broke through the Confederate line, forcing the 2nd Missouri Infantry and the rest of Cockrell's brigade to break for the rear. The 2nd Missouri Infantry routed, as did most of the Confederate regiments on the field. Cockrell's brigade then entered the defenses surrounding Vicksburg, Mississippi. During the Siege of Vicksburg, elements of the brigade were initially held as a reserve, but were eventually sent to various weak points in the line. On May 19, Union troops made a determined assault against the Confederate lines, and the 2nd Missouri Infantry was sent to a position known as the 27th Louisiana Lunette. The 2nd Missouri Infantry and the 27th Louisiana Infantry Regiment fought off Union attempts to carry the position. Later that day, a small group from the regiment burned a house lying between the lines to prevent Union troops from using it as cover. On May 22, the regiment again helped repulse a Union charge; several of the regiments the 2nd Missouri Infantry fought against on the 22nd were composed of Missourians fighting for the Union. The routine siege action also took a toll on the regiment; two men of the 2nd Missouri were killed by Union shellfire on June 26. A mine was detonated beneath the 2nd Missouri Infantry's position on July 1, inflicting multiple casualties. Cockrell led the regiment to the gap blown in the lines, shouting \\"Come on, Old Bloody Second Missouri; you have died once, and can die again!\\" The explosion was not followed with an infantry assault, although Union artillery did fire into the gap in the line. Lieutenant Colonel Pembroke Senteny had been commanding the regiment on July 1, and was fatally shot through the head. The 2nd Missouri Infantry suffered a total of 38 casualties on July 1. On July 4, the Confederate garrison of Vicksburg surrendered. The men of the regiment were paroled, ordered to Demopolis, Alabama, and officially exchanged on September 12. By the July 4, only 356 men remained in the regiment. On October 1, regiment was combined with the 6th Missouri Infantry Regiment to form the 2nd and 6th Missouri Infantry Regiment (Consolidated); the 2nd Missouri Infantry ceased to exist as a separate unit. Commanders Three men served as colonel of the 2nd Missouri Infantry: Burbridge, Cockrell, and Peter C. Flournoy, who was promoted to colonel on July 20. The regiment's lieutenant colonels were Hull, who resigned on May 8, 1862; Cockrell; Dwyer, who died on March 21, 1863; Senteny, and Thomas M. Carter. Dwyer, Senteny, Thomas M. Carter, and William F. Carter served as the regiment's majors. Legacy The 2nd and 6th Missouri Infantry (Consolidated) was commanded by Colonel Flournoy, formerly of the 2nd Missouri Infantry. Companies A, E, F, G, I, and K of the 2nd and 6th Missouri (Consolidated) were from the 2nd Missouri Infantry, and Companies B, C, D, and H were from the 6th Missouri. The new regiment fought in the Atlanta campaign in 1864, including at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain on June 27. On October 5, the regiment was part of a Confederate force that assaulted a Union outpost at the Battle of Allatoona. The regiment then fought at the Battle of Franklin on November 30, where the regiment lost its flag to capture and suffered over 60 percent casualties. After missing the Battle of Nashville in mid-December, the regiment was transferred to Mississippi in January 1865. After being sent to Mobile, Alabama in March, the regiment was captured at the Battle of Fort Blakely on April 9, ending the regiment's fighting tenure.

Early in his career, in 1950, he was expelled from Czechoslovakia as part of the young Communist government's campaign to exercise control over the Church. Biography Ottavio De Liva was born on 10 June 1911 in the town of Sevegliano, Bagnaria Arsa, Province of Udine, Italy, the sixth of seven children. He was ordained a priest of the Diocese of Udine on 8 July 1934. To prepare for a diplomatic career he entered the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy in 1939. In 1950, during a period of intense conflict between the Church and the government of Czechoslovakia, De Liva, though only the secretary, was the last Vatican diplomat remaining in the nunciature. He therefore acted on behalf of the nunciature there for eight months as the government delayed approving a visa to allow the newly appointed chargé d’affaires to enter the country. The government launched a campaign of press denunciations against him in late February. On 16 March, the government ordered him to leave the country within three days; it accused him of \\"subversive, anti-state activity\\", staging phony miracles, interfering in internal affairs, and \\"misusing his official position\\". He had visited Prague Archbishop Josef Beran, under house arrest, repeatedly over several months and made another visit immediately upon receiving the order to quit the country. At the time, the New York Times described De Liva as \\"a 39-year-old rotund, mild-mannered Italian from Udine\\". In a demonstration of support, much of the diplomatic corps in Prague saw him off at the airport. From 1950 to 1954 he worked in the Nunciature to Germany. He was the Permanent Delegate of the Holy See to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna from 1960 to 1962. On 18 April 1962, Pope John XXIII appointed him Apostolic Internuncio to Indonesia and titular archbishop of Heliopolis in Phoenicia. He received his episcopal consecration from Cardinal Franz König on 27 May 1962. In Indonesia he at times negotiated directly with President Sukarno.

When required the NMP would be assisted by the Colony’s volunteer regiments including the Natal Carbineers. It enlisted European officers, NCOs and natives and men of the NMP fought and died in the Battle of Isandlwana and at Rorke's Drift during the Zulu War of 1879. Natal Mounted Police 1873-1894 Major-General Sir J. G. Dartnell The Natal legislature established the Natal Mounted Police in 1874 following an rebellion by Chief Langalibalele.Colonel W. T. Clarke, 'Natal Mounted Police' - The Police Journal: Theory, Practice and Principles, 1 July 1931 However, the Natal legislature were slow to appropriate funds for the organization. The first commandant was Major John George Dartnell (1838-1913) formerly of the 86th (Royal County Down) Regiment of Foot while the first enrolled trooper was Edward Babington of Londonderry in 1874.Natal Mounted Police and Natal Police /Nominal roll - The Campbell Collections of the University of KwaZulu-Natal Dartnell later described his recruits as the: > ...flotsam and jetsam of the colony, and a very rough lot they proved to be, > being principally old soldiers and sailors, transport riders, and social > failures from home, etc. They were, however, a very fine, hardy lot of men, > ready to go anywhere and do anything, and very willing and cheerful if a > little troublesome in town; but in the country, away from temptation, they > were excellent men who grumbled occasionally, of course, but were more > inclined to laugh at and make like of discomfort and hardship. In its early days the Natal Mounted Police mustered 50 whites and 150 Africans; it was seriously under-manned and poorly equipped yet nevertheless managed to gain an enviable reputation for camaraderie and efficient policing. The first headquarters were at Fort Napier in Pietermaritzburg. In 1877 twenty-five men of the Natal Mounted Police provided the protective escort for Sir Theophilus Shepstone, the Special Commissioner, when he went to Pretoria to issue a proclamation announcing the establishment of British authority over the Transvaal. No overt opposition was made to the annexation Zulu War The Natal Mounted Police make their way to the front under darkness - The Illustrated London News (1879) The Natal Mounted Police saw little action until the Zulu War of 1879 when it was attached to the British Army as part of the Colonial mounted force and entered into the Zulu Kingdom with the Central Column under the command of Lord Chelmsford. One detachment of 97 men of the NMP led by Major Dartnell was sent to find the location of the Zulu army of Cetshwayo kaMpande while the second detachment of 34 men fought in the Battle of Isandlwana on 22 January 1879. Of this second detachment 25 were killed in the battle with 21 killed fighting alongside 19 Natal Carbineers in a 'last stand' defending Lieutenant-Colonel Anthony Durnford. Three men of the NMP escaped from Isandlwana and made their way to Rorke's Drift where they fought in the Battle of Rorke's Drift, where one of them, Sidney Hunter, was killed in action.Kenneth Darwin (ed), Familia 1991: Ulster Geneological Review, Number 7- Google Books p. 44UK, Military Campaign Medal and Award Rolls, 1793-1949: Africa, South Africa 1877-1879, Colonial Corps - Ancestry.com The first detachment of the NMP under Dartnell returned to Isandlwana on the evening of the battle where they spent the night among the ruins of the camp and the bodies of their colleagues before accompanying Lord Chelmsford's relief column on its advance to Rorke’s Drift early the next morning. When Sir Garnet Wolseley arrived in Durban in July 1879 to supersede Lord Chelmsford as commander of the forces in the Zulu War and as Governor of Natal and the Transvaal and the High Commissioner of Southern Africa the Natal Mounted Police provided his escort during his visit to Zululand in the final days of the War. Rebellions Men of the Natal Mounted Police Natal Mounted Policemen later served in the Basuto Gun War (1880-81), where they defended the passes of the Drakensberg against attack from the Basuto, and the Transvaal Rebellion (also known as the First Anglo-Boer War) (1880-81) when the NMP was used to form a mounted military force on the border with the Transvaal. When after these Rebellions normal policing duties were resumed men of the NMP provided an escort for the Empress Eugénie in 1880 when she came to Natal to see where her son, Napoléon the Prince Imperial, had been killed the previous year during the Zulu War. The only campaign medals ever awarded to men of the Natal Mounted Police were earned during this period. These were 257 awards of the South Africa Medal (1877-79) for service during the Zulu War and the Cape of Good Hope General Service Medal for service during the Basutoland Rebellion. After 1881 police out-stations were set up across Natal with policing often consisting of long patrols in remote locations.Natal Mounted Police - Anglo-Boer War database By 1885 the roll-call of the NMP was 300 white officers and 25 Africans. Natal Police 1894-1913 Cigarette card of an officer of the Natal Police - 'Police of the World' (1910) In 1894 the Natal Mounted Police was merged with the Colony of Natal's various police and prison services to create the Natal Police (NP), the name it was known by until it was disbanded in 1913. Commandant John Dartnell was appointed the first Chief Commissioner of Police of the new force. Innovations in policing The Natal Police were the first to introduce finger-printing in Africa for use in forensic identification. The scheme was launched by Sub- Inspector W. J. Clarke of the Natal Police's Criminal Investigation Department (CID) who was impressed by the effective use of finger-printing for solving crime in Calcutta in 1897 and who tried to introduce the system in Natal in 1898. His superiors in the Natal Police did not share his enthusiasm for this new forensic innovation so Clarke launched the system at his own expense. Once it had proved its worth by leading to more arrests and crime-solving finger- printing became part of normal police procedure in Natal. So effective was the system that by 1910 the Natal Police's CID had more sets of finger-prints in its records than Scotland Yard had in its. Clarke was to succeed Dartnell as Chief Commissioner on his retirement in 1903 Boer War 1899-1902 Officers of the Natal Police in 1899 When in September 1899 war with the Boer Republic looked likely the men of the Natal Police were put on alert and used to watch the borders. When war was eventually declared in October 1899 the first casualties were a Natal Police picket at De Jager's Drift who were captured by the Boers. Consequently all the men of the Natal Police in northern Natal were sent to Dundee where they fought in the Battle of Talana Hill on 20 October 1899. The British forces including 90 men of the Natal Police under the command of Colonel Dartnell then retired to Ladysmith where they became besieged during the Siege of Ladysmith. The Natal Police came under fire at Lombard's Kop on 30 October 1899. At Ladysmith the Natal Police had one man killed and three wounded while a further three died of disease. On 7 December 1899 during the Siege the Natal Volunteers and the Imperial Light Horse launched a night attack from Ladysmith on Gun Hill with the Natal Police guarding the left flank during the action. The Imperial Light Horse and Natal Carbineers with a team from the Royal Engineers caught the Boers off-guard and forced them to withdraw and abandon their guns. The Royal Engineers placed explosives on a howitzer artillery piece and a Long Tom, taking the breechblock from the Long Tom and removing a Maxim gun back to Ladysmith. Being on the other side of a hill the Natal Police did not hear the bugle call \\"retire\\" and were late returning to Ladysmith. The NP saw further action during the evening of 5 January 1900 when a picket near Caesar's Camp (named after Caesar's Camp, an ancient feature near Aldershot which it resembled) were fired on during a major assault by the Boers on the British at Wagon Hill. Early next morning the Boers shot the horses of the NP forcing them to make their own way back by foot at the same time enduring withering rifle fire. After a British counterattack the Boers withdrew. The Siege of Ladysmith ended on 28 February 1900 when an advance party of the Composite Regiment of the Mounted Brigade reached Ladysmith which including 15 members of the Natal Police. Those men of the Natal Police who were not at Ladysmith when it was besieged were excused police duties and instead served in a military role with the Natal Police Field Force (NPFF). One section was the bodyguard for General Sir Redvers Buller VC when he was appointed to the Command of the British forces in Natal.

Its police officers were reassigned to military units including the 2nd and 3rd Regiments of the South African Mounted Riflemen or into the South African Police or the South African Prisons Service.McCracken, Donal P.

After 2000 the latter area of his work became one of the speleology hotspots as it includes the Boybuloq, the deepest cave in Central and East Asia, and one of the deepest caves in the world.  Early Life, Education and Career  He was born into the family of Sergej Pantelejmonovič Višnevskij, a military civil engineer and builder of Kolcovo airfield in Sverdlovsk and of Marija Georgievna Višnevskaja, a chemist. After elementary and middle school in Sverdlovsk Višnevskij graduated, in 1978, at the Faculty of Geography and Biology of the Ural State Pedagogical University, also in Sverdlovsk. After graduation he followed the compulsory state assignment to teach geography at a school for troubled teenagers in Polunočnoe [Midnight Place], in the north of Sverdlovsk region. In February 1981 he was reassigned to a middle school in the village Novoalekseevskoe, close to Sverdlovsk, in the same capacity. In 1984 he returned to Sverdlovsk, to work at the School of Advanced Studies in Tourism, from 1991 in the Speleocenter travel agency, until he opened Al'pur, sports and recreation store, in 1995.  Speleology  In high school Višnevskij got interested in caves and speleology. In 1973, as a student of geography, he traveled a lot in the Urals with SGS (Sverdlovsk city speleosection), to which he was accepted as a member in 1974. After graduation in 1978, during his years as a teacher of geography he organized speleology courses and educated several generations of young speleologists. In 1984 he returned to his hometown and began to participate in the activities of tourist and speleological organizations of the USSR. He was one of the founders of the ASU (Association of Speleologists of the Urals, established in 1989), and its first president. He also became a senior member of the Russian Geographical Society. In 1999 he served as the vicepresident of the Russian Union of Speleologists. Višnevskij participated in several scientific projects, he was involved in the development and application of new speleological equipment, such as single-rope technique. He organized, headed or supervised regional and all-Soviet Union speleological expeditions and training events: in 1976 two speleo camps in Western Caucasus, in Fisht massif and in Alek massif, in 1977 an expedition to Optymistychna Cave in Ukraine and all-Union speleo camp in Alek massif, in 1978 7th conference on the speleotourism issues in Perm, speleo camps in Gubaha, Western Urals and at Lake Bajkal, in 1979 all-Union gathering of caving instructors in Western Caucasus, Alek massif, in 1980 speleo camp at the same location, in 1981 4th speleotechnics meeting of the cities of the Urals in Sverdlovsk, speleo camp on the Kirk Tau plateau and a cave search expedition to Čak-Čar, southwestern Gissar range, both in Uzbekistan, in 1983 another search expedition to Gissar range, an educational training trip to Alek massif, 7th speleotechnics meeting in Šihan near Čeljabinsk, exploration trip to Kujbiševskaja cave on Arabika massif, speleo camp in the Northern Urals, in 1985 an educational camp on Bzyb range and an expedition to Iljuhin cave on Arabika, both in Western Caucasus. During the difficult years for the Russian speleology, after the collapse of the USSR in 1991 his organizational skills and financial support helped SGS and Sverdlovsk-Ekaterinburg caving preserve the legacy of previous years. In the following years he led expeditions and field trips mainly to Central Asia, but also to other destinations such as Italy, Nepal and Norway. Chul-Bair mountain ridge, Uzbekistan, with entrance to the cave, named after Višnevskij  Uzbekistan Caves  After the discovery of Kiev Cave on the Kirk Tau plateau in Uzbekistan in 1972, 2340 m a. s. l., which was in the subsequent years explored to the depth of 990 m and was in the years 1977-1978 the deepest cave in the USSR, SGS cavers in the late 1970s started to search for new deep caves in the wider area. In May 1981 they discovered the Zindan cave, 3100 m a. s. l., in the Ketmen'-Čapta ridge. Its spring at the elevation of 1300 m indicated the possibility of a very deep cave. After the death of Sergej Zenkov, who fell into a pit during the summer expedition, the cave was renamed to Urals-Zenkov (Zindan) Cave. Next expedition in the following winter, co-led by Višnevskij, managed to dig through the siphon at -300 m and until January 1983 the final depth of 565 m was reached, in the siphon too narrow to dive. Several search expeditions in the summer 1983 were fruitless, and SGS decided to refocus on Arabika massif in Abkhazia, participating in expeditions of other speleological organizations. All in all Višnevskij was heading over 10 expeditions to Uzbekistan, mostly to Boybuloq cave.  Boyboluq  Entrance of the Boybuloq Cave, Uzbekistan, with Elena Ljubavina In 1985 they resumed the Uzbekistan campaign, to explore caves the entrances of which were discovered in 1984 by a token SGS expedition to Khodja-Gur-Gur-Ata massif. A group of five expedition members was sent to Surkhan-Tau ridge to scout its surface for new caves. On the way, in the village Kurgancha, 1455 m a. s. l., they were told of a cave higher in the mountain, called Boybuloq where a villager from the highest settlement in Uzbekistan, the village Dehibolo (boy buloq = rich spring in Uzbek language and the language of the people from the village, the Tajiki), went in 1971 and never returned. They followed the stream bed, discovered the cave, at an elevation of 2650 m, and followed its narrow meander which slowly ascended 600 meters in straight direction, at a height of 90 meters, where it turned down. Soon a 27 meter pit was reached and they discovered human bones at its bottom. Later it turned out that the man was Mustafaqul Zakirov, a teacher from Dehibolo who visited the cave, four hours away on foot, several times before. In May 1971, in time of severe drought, he departed to the cave with his son and pack donkeys to fetch water. He entered the cave, and after a crawl of about one hour, he reached the point close to the first pit, where his kerosene lamp went out. In the darkness he missed the direction towards outside and fell into the abyss. Not only Boybuloq cave but most other caves in the area are a long sequence of tight passages which are difficult to pass, and where possibilities for help or rescue operation are very limited, as described by Sergej Kuklev, a member of Višnevskij's team: In the following years further expeditions took place: in 1986 the cave was deepened to -400 m, in 1987 to -500 m and the remains of Zakirov were returned to his family, in 1988 a siphon at -600 m was free-dived and also the barrier on the other side lowered so that the lake could be waded through, and a new branch of the cave was discovered - it continued to -900 m. In 1989 a combined Soviet-Italian team reached the terminal siphon at -1154 m, and managed to climb upwards to the point at an elevation of +156 m which gave the total cave depth of 1310 m. In 1990 a Soviet-British team managed to extend the New branch in the cave upwards to +222 m (total depth 1376 m), in 1991 lower levels of the New branch were discovered, and in 1992 an additional chimney upwards was climbed, to +257 m which gave the final cave depth of 1415 m. In the next years the turmoil which followed the dissolution of the Soviet Union was unfavorable for caving expeditions and there were just a few. In 1994 the breakup of the majority of caving kit bags brought the misson to a premature end, in 1995 a major collapse in the cave was dug through and in 1998 the diving of the siphon at -560 m was unsuccessful, and the spring Holtan-Čašma, where the water from the terminal cave siphon comes to light, was also dived. The spring is situated 130 m below the terminal cave siphon while the horizontal distance is 7 km, and so the connecting passages are most likely submerged. SGS cavers returned to Uzbekistan in 2007, to Boy-Bulok, led again by Višnevskij and expeditions followed almost every year. New passages in Boybuloq were discovered and explored, yet the cave depth remained the same. Diving in the Holtan-Čašma spring was resumed in 2014, 2015 and 2016, when, at a horizontal distance of 170 m and depth of 18 m, a lenticular grotto was reached with narrow, downwards extending slots, too narrow to pass.  Death  Višnevskij never married, he lived alone. Yet he was always surrounded by friends and like-minded people, his life was filled with cave exploration, extreme sports and travel. In the last years his health started to deteriorate, but his premature death was caused by a nosocomial infection during the hospitalization after a domestic head injury. Polnolunie [Full Moon] hall in Ice, with Anastasija Buharova; Dark Star cave, Uzbekistan  Legacy  Legacy of his work is manifold, especially notable are achievements of his home speleological institutions, the SGS and ASU, in the Chul-Bair mountain ridge, initiated by Višnevskij. In the year of his death, 2015, as part of the SGS and ASU expedition, a search team led by Vasilij Samsonov from Orenburg discovered a cave just below the cliff top, above the Boybuloq, which they marked as ČB-15, and explored it 400 meters far and 70 meters deep. In 2016 the cave was deepened to 260 m and prolonged to 1500 m. The main branch of the cave, now named Višnevskij cave, steadily descended in the direction of Boybuloq. Explorations continued in the following years and in 2019 the SGS and ASU team with the participation of Moscow and Irkutsk cavers bypassed the siphon at -735 m. They continued to a depth of 1131 m where they ended the exploration above the next pit because of lack of equipment and time. The connection of the two caves (in 2019 the closest point reached in Višnevskij cave was 50 m vertically and 250 m horizontally apart from Boybuloq) would achieve the cumulative depth of over 2000 m. The perspectives this achievement opened led to further initiatives of speleological exploration in the wider region. Višnevskij's work reflected in movies about the expeditions in Uzbekistan, in books and travelogues.

An early African-American barnstormer in the 1910s, Headen would go on to be an inventor and found an engineering firm in the United Kingdom.  Biography  Headen was born in 1879 in Carthage, North Carolina. He had an aptitude for mechanics, and worked for most of his early life as a railroad porter. In 1910, he invented a stabilizer allowing for aircraft to remain level in flight after banking, though he never filed a patent. In 1911, he first took up flying lessons in Long Island, eventually joining the Aeronautic Society of New York. After learning to fly, Headen embarked on a barnstorming tour of the American Midwest, performing a number of exhibition flights. He attempted to join the Aero Club of Illinois, but was rejected due to his race. In 1914, Headen ended his barnstorming career, moving to Chicago to work for a patent lawyer. He continued his work as an inventor, designing a system of mirrors to help protect ships from U-boat activity during World War I. Headen's system was turned down by the United States Navy, and the war ended before the Royal Navy (which had expressed interest in his invention) could implement his system. In the postwar years, Headen shifted his attention to racing cars, designing a number of race cars and engines. Headen emigrated to the United Kingdom in 1931, where he founded an engineering firm. In Britain, he patented a method of de-icing plane engines, tested fuel combustibility, and designed a gasket that allowed engines to be protected from unburned fuel. During World War II, Headen joined the Surrey Home Guard’s 1st Battalion. Headen would eventually settle in the village of Frimley Green, dying of a heart attack in 1957.

She participated in the Naval Battle of Campeche in 1843. She was one of the first iron hulled warships ever built and the one of the first to see action in a naval battle. Background of the Mexican Navy The Mexican Navy has its origins in the creation of the Ministry of War in 1821. From that year until 1939 it existed jointly with the Mexican Army in the organic ministry. Since its declaration of independence from Spain in September 1810, through the mid decades of the 19th century, Mexico found itself in a constant state of war, mostly against Spain which had not recognized its independence. Therefore, its priority was to purchase its first fleet from the U.S. in order to displace the last remaining Spanish forces from its coasts. Construction of the Guadalupe The Guadalupe, probably named after the city of Guadalupe, was built in the Liverpool shipyard of Jonathan Laird of Birkenhead, England in 1842. Guadalupe was referred to as a steam paddle frigate and had a full brig rig. Guadalupe was 183 feet in length with a displacement of 878 tons. She was the biggest iron warship in the world when built. Due to diplomatic action by the Republic of Texas she was delivered unarmed as a merchant ship with her guns in her hold. \\"In May 1842, William Kennedy, Republic of Texas consul general in London, and Ashbel Smith, minister to England, protested the building of the vessels for Mexican use against Texas and urged the English government to detain them. Lord Aberdeen of the British Foreign Office decided that arms might be placed on the vessels so long as they were not mounted in English ports, and the Guadaloupe sailed in June despite Republic of Texas protests. Aberdeen insisted that the English would maintain strict neutrality in the struggle between Texas and Mexico and that no English commissioned officer would be allowed to serve in the Mexican nation against Texas.\\" When she arrived in Mexico she was equipped with two 68-pounder guns that fired explosive shells, two 32-pounder guns and two 24-pounder long guns. A feature that was unusual for the period was her construction with watertight compartmentation throughout her hull a feature that impressed famous French naval architect Henri Dupuy de Lôme. She carried a crew that included many British nationals lead by her captain Edward Phillip Charlwood Commander RN who started while she was building in 1841 and who remained her captain until 1843. * * Hand- coloured lithograph of the Mexican 2-gun paddlewheel frigate ‘Guadalupe’ under steam and sail in a stiff breeze, with vessels to her right and left.

HMS Sidon 68 pounder pivot gun 1855 LOC 05685u Career=Naval Battle of Campeche 30 April 1843 and 16 May 1843 The Mexican fleet now possessed the paddle steam frigates Guadalupe and Montezuma. About 40 of the crew of the Guadalupe were sick with yellow fever. The Texas Navy commander Moore hoped to encounter the Guadalupe separate from her escort Montezuma.* Austin and Wharton made for the Yucatán coast and encountered the Mexican squadron on 30 April 1843 between Lerma and Campeche. Montezuma and Guadalupe, along with four smaller vessels, comprised the Mexican fleet. The Texans were augmented by two Yucatecan ships and five small gunboats, but were clearly the smaller fleet. The Mexican shooting at first fell short and then went over the Texas ships. During the two-hour running battle the Austin was struck once in the fighting and lost some of her mizzen rigging and the Guadalupe had 7 dead and the Montezuma 13 dead. After a few hours, the Mexican sailing ships departed and only the two steamers remained. The result was that the Mexican blockade of the port of Campeche was lifted and the Texan ships put into the port for repairs. This first attack was a draw and the fleets separated. The next event on 16 May 1843 was orchestrated by Commodore Moore and his \\"Texians\\" who lured the Mexican Forces into a narrow roadstead, and hounded the Mexican ships away from the harbour firing most of Austin's ammunition as Wharton was not able to engage. The battle toll came out as; \\"Austin\\" 3 dead, \\"Wharton\\" 2 dead, \\"Montezuma\\" 40 dead including her captain and \\"Guadalupe\\" 47 dead. The Mexican Fleet was effectively incapacitated. This battle would represent the only time that steam-driven warships would be defeated by sail powered ships. * There were numerous falsehoods circulated about Moore’s battle with Guadalupe. These seem to be largely the confections of the press, egged on by politicians, and are not to be taken seriously. They include claims to have sunk her. Her Captain Commander Edward P Charlwood RN had his own description of the action. He noted that compared to a wooden ship her damage from shot was much less in part to the action being in warm waters. During the 4 to 5 weeks of the Yucatan campaign she was hit a total of 6 times by 18 or 24 pounder solid shot. He described Guadalupe as a good gun platform and felt that they had hit the Texan sloop-of-war Austin about 12 times with 68 pounder shells causing her to withdraw from the action of 16 May 1843. * After Campeche Guadalupe remained in the Armada de Mexico until 1847, by which time the fate of Yucatan had been decided, when she and Montezuma were sold to raise money for the continuing land hostilities with the United States. Her new owners are described by the Armada de Mexico as ‘The Spaniards in Havana’. The Spanish Navy Wikipedia entry states that \\"The first new steam-driven vessels were purchased from Mexico in 1846. These included two frigates, the Guadalupe and the Moctezuma, acquired from the UK in 1842, and a third vessel delivered in 1843. They were sold to Spanish authorities in Cuba by General Antonio López de Santa Anna, in order to raise funds for Mexico's defense from the U.S. invasion in 1846-1848. The Spanish christened the vessels Castilla for Montezuma and León for Guadelupe\\" Referenced the Wikipedia entry Spanish ship Castilla. In 1849 the Castilla and León were used with two other Spanish steam ships to intervene in Italy along with French forces during the suppressing of the Roman Republic (1849). The steam ships transported 9,000 troops to Italy and provided logistical support for them for months. The resulting recognition from the Pope, Sardinia, Prussia and Austria strengthened the Spanish government versus its rival Carlist faction.

Built about 1796, it is one of Somerset's oldest surviving houses, and a rare local example of Georgian/Federal residential architecture. It was built by John Brayton on land purchased by his grandfather, and remained in the family into the 20th century. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2020. Description and history The Brayton Homestead stands in the village of South Somerset, on the west side of Brayton Avenue south of its junction with McArthur Avenue. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The roof is pierced by symmetrically placed brick chimneys. The main facade is also symmetrical, with sash windows arranged around the central entrance. The entrance is flanked by fluted pilasters and topped by a five- light transom window, entablature, and cornice. A two-story ell extends to the rear. The interior retains many original mid-to-late 19th century features, including wall paneling and central staircase. The house sits in a very small parcel of land, a surviving remnant of more than purchased by Preserved Brayton in the 1710s, when the area was part of Swansea. This house was built by his grandson John around 1796, a few years after he inherited the property following the death of his father Israel. The Braytons were a prominent local family, engaged in many different business ventures. The house was owned by several generations of Braytons, and then a family foundation, until its sale in 1946.

She is famous for her coverage of World War II, during which she followed the Women's Auxiliary Army Corps and reported on major battles for the Associated Press.  Early life  Ruth Cowan Nash was born in Salt Lake City, Utah on June 15, 1901, the only child of parents William Henry and Ida (Baldwin) Cowan.Ruth Cowan Nash Papers, ca.1905-1990: A Finding Aid. MC 417. Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. Retrieved June 11, 2020. Her father was a mining prospector who died in 1911, at which point Cowan's mother, Ida, bought a homestead in Florida.Ruth Cowan Nash, interview by Margot H. Knight, 29 March 1990 in Harper’s Ferry, West Virginia, transcript. Washington Press Club Foundation Oral History Collection. They were required by the government to live on the property in order to retain their homestead status, and they lived there for about two years trying to raise grapefruit and orange trees. At the end of that time, Nash and her mother returned to Salt Like City, where Nash attended St. Mary's Academy, a convent school, despite the fact that Nash's family was not Catholic. Ida Cowan had previously been a teacher, and felt that private schools provided a better education, so Nash completed seventh and eighth grade there. Ida Cowan disliked the cold weather in Salt Lake City, and used the money that she saved from the sale of their homestead to move to San Antonio, Texas. Ida began traveling to find a job, but Nash requested to stay put. Her mother agreed, and found boarding her for at Ursuline Academy, a boarding school. Nash never again returned to living with her mother. Instead, she supported herself with odd jobs while living in San Antonio and attending two other schools, St. Michael's Academy and Main Avenue High School. She worked as a clerk, a librarian, and in the book section of a department store while in high school.\\"Go to War I Did, and at Considerable Trouble\\" Ramirez, Maria. Nieman Reports, Nieman Foundation at Harvard. When she enrolled in the Main Avenue High School, they found her to be an advanced student and allowed her to graduate high school in two years. During her time there, however, Nash met Elva Cunningham, the president of the San Antonio Parent Teacher Association. Because Nash's mother never lived anywhere consistently, Cunnginham invited Nash to live with the Cunningham family, which consisted of Elva and her husband, John, their sons, and Elva's sister, Mary Carter. Nash enrolled in the University of Texas at Austin in 1919, and moved out of the Cunningham home in order to do so, but they remained like a second family to her. While there, Newman lived in a Catholic dormitory, Newman Hall. While there, she continued to work odd jobs to support herself. It was during this time that she gave herself the middle name Barbara, but she changed it to Baldwin, her mother's maiden name, shortly thereafter to please her. When Nash graduated in 1923, she became an algebra teacher at Main Avenue High School, the same high school that she had attended herself. While teaching, she lived with the Cunninghams once again. Journalism career Nash's journalism career began in 1924, when she began writing part-time as a movie reviewer for the San Antonio Evening News. She got the job through Mary Carter, sister of Elva Cunningham, who knew the managing editor of the paper and worked in the news room. In 1926 they hired her for a full-time position at the Evening News. Nash recalled in an oral history interview that she particularly liked getting \\"night assignments... because they didn't think I should have them.\\" She also started offering her services as a free-lance journalist, and wrote for other papers, such as the Houston Chronicle, under the name Baldwin Cowan in order to disguise her gender.Pioneering War Correspondent Ruth Cowan Dies at 91. 5 February 1993. AP News. While working doing work for the Houston Chronicle, Nash met Oveta Culp Hobby and they became fast friends. She continued to work at the San Antonio Evening News until 1929, during which time she covered the 1928 Democratic National Convention in Houston, Texas. While there, she interviewed Franklin D. Roosevelt. Impressed with her work there, which she had written under her pen name of Baldwin Cowan, United Press offered her a job in January 1929, which she accepted. Not long after, an executive from United Press came to the newsroom looking to praise the work of Baldwin Cowan — when it became clear that there was no such man, only Ruth Cowan Nash, she was fired. Meanwhile, Kent Cooper at the Associated Press had begun the practice of hiring women during his tenure as general manager beginning in 1925. Upon being fired from United Press for her sex, Nash wrote a letter to Cooper that began: \\"Dear Mr. Cooper. First, I am a girl. Sight unseen I pass for a man. But notwithstanding my femininity, I need a job, want one with the AP, and can hold it.\\" Cooper promptly hired Nash, and she would go on to work for the Associated Press for the next 27 years as a reporter, writing about many important historical events, although she was often pressured by her superiors to cover the news from the \\"woman's angle.\\" She was initially assigned to Chicago, Illinois where she covered Al Capone's trial. While covering the case, she recalled having a \\"feature instinct,\\" a result of Mr. Capone limping down the courtroom aisle. Nash asked, \\"New shoes. They hurt, don't they?\\" to which Mr. Capone responded, \\"Yes,\\" which Nash used as the hook for her report. She was later assigned to Washington D.C., where she covered social life, human interest stories, and Eleanor Roosevelt's press conferences. Nash would eventually become friendly with the then-First Lady, and correspond with each other often. While in Washington, Nash spent May 1942 covering the introduction and eventual passage of the bill that established the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, later the Women's Army Corps (WACs). World War II journalism After covering the establishment of WACs, Nash requested to follow their first contingent overseas. Her request was approved by her long-time friend, Oveta Culp Hobby, who was then the director of the WACs. Shortly after, AP also approved her request, and Nash left for North Africa, where she would report on WACs, hospitals, and military operations.Ruth B. Cowan, 91, A.P. Correspondent During World War II 6 February 1993. The New York Times. She was accompanied by one other woman reporter, Inez Robb from the International News Service. Together they were the first women to ever be accredited as United States Army War Correspondents. It is possible that Robb and Nash were utilized as tools to recruit more women for WACs, or garner more support for the war from American women. While reporting, Nash was required to wear the same uniform as the WAC women, and was required to adhere to all the regulations of a member of the Armed Forces. While deployed in Algeria, beginning January 1943, Nash was met with considerable resistance both from within the U.S. Army and her coworkers at the Associated Press. She suspected that Wes Gallagher, manager of the AP office in North Africa who would go on to become president and General Manager of AP, was hostile to her work, even going so far as to put her in a position that he knew would be bombed. However, not all were hostile to her work. Shortly after her arrival in Algeria, Nash met General George Patton. He reportedly asked her what the first rule of war was, to which Nash responded: \\"You kill him before he kills you.\\" Patton afterwards stated, \\"She stays.\\" In May 1943 Nash was assigned to England, where she covered the arrival of WACs there and the preparations for the European invasion. Then, in September 1944, Nash moved to France and was present for the liberation of Paris.Journalist Ruth Nash Dies. 1993. The Washington Post. She also covered the Battle of the Bulge. Nash covered the war without a break from 1943 to 1945, mixing hair dye in her helmet to keep her blonde hair neat. Many of her stories were about women and the war effort, but she also wrote about wounded soldiers, new medical treatments, and the effects of war on civilians. Return to America and retirement In April 1945, Nash was reassigned to AP's Washington Bureau, and after the war she covered the Pentagon, the House Armed Services Committee, and general military news until 1956. In 1956, she was forced to retire from AP, whose policy stated that women could not work after their 55th birthday. The compulsory retirement age for men at that time was 65. Early into her forced retirement, Nash married Bradley De Lamater Nash, a Harvard University graduate and expert in government operations who had worked as the Deputy Undersecretary of Commerce. They moved together to Harper's Ferry, West Virginia, where they owned High Acres Farm. Nash used her retirement to continue writing, this time working on her memoir about her experiences during the war. Her manuscript, titled Why Go to War?, was rejected by the publishing company she sent it to in 1946 due to the market's over-saturation with war books. Ruth Nash was also an active member of the Republican Party, and from May 1957 to August 1958 she served as a public relations consultant for the Republican National Committee's women's division. Beginning in September 1958, Nash served as the confidential administrative assistant to Bertha Adkins, the Under Secretary of the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (now the Department of Health and Human Services). Also in 1958, Nash became a member of the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services (DACOWITS). Both Nash and her husband Bradley Nash were active in their retirement, and Bradley Nash was the mayor of Harper's Ferry, West Virginia for many years. They donated portions of their land to the National Park Service in 1984 to create a wildlife preserve. Death and legacy Ruth Cowan Nash died on February 5, 1993, of respiratory arrest in her sleep. She was 91 years old. She had no children. Her papers are currently held at Schlesinger Library at Harvard University, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

History of the artwork  The art project was initiated by the local association for promotion of tourism in 2003 and was approved in a council meeting under the working title \\"Toilet Drama and Feudalism\\". Contrary to what was reported in the media, the artwork was not funded by the municipality with taxpayers' money. Instead the association of Kunstfreunde Bodman-Ludwigshafen e.V. contributed to the costs of creating the artwork, which are estimated between €30,000 and €35,000 (according to minutes of the municipal council); the community contributed €1,500 towards the artwork. According to Lenk, only the middle section of the triptych was transferred to the art association. The two side sections initially remained in Lenk's possession and were offered for sale to the municipality in 2010. The July 2010 the municipal council decided to buy the two side sections for €40,000, and in November the art association decided to transfer the middle section to the municipality. In return, the municipality undertook to keep the triptych in its entirety and make it publicly available.

A founder of the Illinois Federal Savings and Loan, a mortgager for black residents of Chicago's South Side, Taylor was the first black member of the Chicago Housing Authority and later its chairman. The Robert Taylor Homes, a public housing project completed in 1962, was named for Taylor. Taylor was born in 1899 in Tuskegee, Alabama. Taylor was the son of Robert Robinson Taylor, an architect and professor at the Tuskegee Institute, and Beatrice Francis Taylor. He studied architecture at Howard University, then completed his bachelor's degree in business at the University of Illinois in 1925. First practicing as an architect in Chicago, Taylor began financing real estate projects. In addition to building many single family homes on the South Side, Taylor managed the Michigan Boulevard Garden Apartments, among the first subsidized rental apartments meant to house black residents. The project was financially backed by Sears Roebuck president Julius Rosenwald. In 1934, Taylor became general manager of the Illinois Federal Savings and Loan to support mortgage lending to black Chicagoans. Taylor's successes as a housing financier led to his appointment to the Chicago Housing Authority board in 1938 by Mayor Edward Kelly, who was prodded to do so by economist Robert C. Weaver. Taylor was appointed chairman in 1941 and served until 1950. Working with CHA director Elizabeth Wood, Taylor presided as chair during a period in which more than 92% of new CHA housing units were occupied by black Chicagoans, a marked shift the housing projects of the 1930s built exclusively for whites. He was a strong proponent of scattered-site public housing and desegregation of white Chicago neighborhoods to support black economic mobility. Taylor resigned after his ideas met resistance from the Chicago City Council. After Taylor's death, the Housing Authority named the South Side's Robert Taylor Homes in his memory, at the time the largest single-site housing project ever built. Taylor married Laura Dorothy Vaughan Jennings, with whom he had two daughters, Lauretta and Barbara. He died March 1, 1957 in Chicago.

Early life and activism  The Lee sisters (Ernestine, Ruth Elaine, Sandra, Brenda, Peggy Jane, Joan and Susan) are the seven daughters of Robert and Alversa Williams Lee. Their mother's father, Dennis Williams, was born into slavery in Lauderdale County, Tennessee. At the time, Memphis was segregated, and young people were losing. The eldest sister, Ernestine, attended LeMoyne–Owen College, and became involved with social justice whilst still a junior at high school. She was first arrested in 1960, when she joined friends from college to visit white- only libraries. For the following six years, the Lee sisters became more involved with the civil rights movement. Ernestine and the other Lee sisters organised several sit-ins in white-only libraries, lunch-counters and theatres. It has been said that their dedication inspired the desegregation movement in Memphis, Tennessee. They attended several marches, including the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, the Selma to Montgomery marches and the March Against Fear. In 1965, Jet magazine reported that members of the Lee family had been arrested seventeen times in the fight for racial justice; making them America's most arrested family. That year they were honoured by the NAACP. Elaine also studied at LeMoyne–Owen College, and after graduating in 1966 became a teacher. She became concerned that African-American children growing up in Memphis were not aware of their Elaine and Joan established Heritage Tours in 1983, an organisation who arrange tours centred on the history of the civil rights movement. Heritage Tours was the first African- American owned tour company in Tennessee. Together Elaine and Joan erected a monument to the African slaves who died between1852 and 1865. They founded the Slave Haven Underground Railroad Museum, which teaches people in Memphis about Black history. They were involved with establishing the Ida B. Wells Society. Peggy Jane trained in law and worked as an attorney in Memphis.  Recognition and honours  In 2017 the African American Museum of Memphis erected a historical marker to honour the efforts of the Lee sisters. When asked about her involvement, Elaine said “I felt that we had a certain amount of power because we were on the side of right,”. The sisters were included the Memphis Women's Legacy Trail. The Lee sisters are the aunts of Danielle N. Lee, a biology professor and science communicator at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.

Early life Heli Susi was born in Tallinn as the youngest child and only daughter of lawyer Arnold Susi, who was the Estonian Minister of Education during Acting Prime Minister Otto Tief's last Government of Estonia before the Soviet troops occupied Estonia during the Second World War in September 1944, and Ella Adelgunde Roost, who was a teacher. Her older brothers were Heino Susi, a writer and a biochemist, and Arno Susi, an economist. She attended the Elfriede Lender Private Gymnasium and Tallinn Secondary School No. 8. Following the reoccupation of Estonia by the Soviet Union, her father was arrested and placed into the gulag camp-system in 1945. In March 1949, Heli, along with her mother, brother Arno, and grandmother, were forcibly deported by Soviet authorities to Ordzhonikidzevsky District, Khakassia in Siberia during Operation Priboi where they were forced to work as laborers. The family was reunited with Arnold Susi in 1954. During exile in Siberia, she met and married fellow Estonian deportee, artist Olev Subbi. The couple had a son, Juhan, who would become a physicist. After the death of Joseph Stalin and the Khrushchev Thaw, the family were released and permitted to return to Estonia in 1958. Career and association with Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn After her return to Estonia, Susi enrolled at the University of Tartu, studying the German language. She later worked as a translator and taught German at the Tallinn Conservatory. Soviet authorities did not permit the family to settle in the larger cities, so the family lived in Kopli-Märdi, near the village of Vasula in Tartu County. Heli's father Arnold, had been incarcerated in Lubyanka prison with Russian author and dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. After the publication of Solzhenitsyn's One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, the two men reconnected outside of the gulag system. In September 1965, when the KGB seized a significant part of Solzhenitsyn’s literary archive, the unfinished manuscript of The Gulag Archipelago was secretly given to Arnold Susi. Over two winters, between 1965 and 1967, The Gulag Archipelago was completed by Solzhenitsyn in Estonia. In order to maintain secrecy from authorities, members of the Susi family told their neighbors that Solzhenitsyn was a Moscow professor who was temporarily living at the farm to complete a dissertation. Heli Susi acted as custodian of the manuscripts, hiding them in various places throughout Estonia: the banks of the Ahja river, in the linen closet of a family friend, and the basement of a house in Tartu. Solzhenitsyn included Heli Susi among the 257 \\"witnesses of the Archipelago,\\" \\"whose stories, letters, memoirs, and corrections were used to create this book.\\" He ended the afterword to the book with the words “A complete list of those without whom this book would not have been written, transmitted, not preserved — has not yet come to entrust the paper.

Synopsis  The game is set a few years after the events of Resident Evil 7: Biohazard. During the reveal Capcom's Kellen Haney said about the story: \\"Ethan's world suddenly comes crashing down once again when Chris Redfield, an unexpected yet familiar face makes an appearance, setting off a chain of events that sees a distraught Ethan seeking answers to Chris's shocking actions, and ultimately finding him in a mysterious village.\\" Events will take place in Europe. Just like Resident Evil 7, the game was developed on the RE Engine and will be played from a first-person perspective. Development Development of Resident Evil Village started in early 2017. While Resident Evil Village is recognized by Capcom as the tenth main game in the series, and its logo stylized to include the roman numeral \\"VIII\\" for 8, the game producers Tsuyoshi Kanda and Peter Fabiano stated in a Famitsu interview that the title choice was they considered the village to be another character in the game and \\"because we would like players to understand that\\" they reflected that in the title stylization.

A broodmare's place in racing history A 1946 Daily Racing Form article lamented the fact that when a sire of one or more outstanding runners dies there will be much written about that stallion in country's all over the world. Conversely, when a mare who has produced similar such successful offspring, scant little will be reported on her accomplishment. That same article recounted a story by the sports Editor of the Atlanta Journal about his visit to Claiborne Farm and the gravesite of Marguerite. The Daily Racing Form commented that Arthur Hancock telling the reporter he was saving a space next to her for Sir Gallahad III was \\"one of the most romantic stories in the annals of the world's turf\\". Breeding Marguerite was purchased as a yearling by William Woodward at a 1921 Saratoga sale. Her sire was Celt, winner of the 1907 Junior Champion Stakes and the 1908 Brooklyn Handicap who would be the Leading sire in North America in 1921. Celt was a son of the great Commando, an American Horse of the Year and U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee. Commando also sired Hall of Fame champions Colin and Peter Pan. Marguerite's dam was the English mare Fairy Ray, a daughter of Radium who was a successful runner for Leopold de Rothschild. Dam Fairy Ray also produced the multiple stakes winning colt Cloudland (1922) by Wrack. Marguerite's best: Three of Marguerite's best progeny were sired by Sir Gallahad III, a French- bred stallion that had been bought in 1926 by an American syndicate when standing at stud for owner Jefferson Davis Cohn at his Haras du Bois-Roussel near Alençon in Normandy, France. The syndicate was made up of Robert A. Fairbairn, William Woodward Sr., Marshall Field III, and Arthur B. Hancock. * Petee-Wrack (1925) by Wrack - bred by Belair Stud but foaled at Arthur Hancock's Ellerslie Stud in Albemarle County, Virginia, he was purchased and raced by John R. Macomber. Marguerite was moved to Hancock's Claiborne Farm in Kentucky where all her future foals were born. Among Petee-Wrack's race wins were the 1928 Travers Stakes in which he defeated Reigh Count, the 1929 Twin City, Merchants and Citizens and Metropolitan Handicaps, and the 1930 Suburban Handicap. ::Petee-Wrack's offspring included Widener Challenge Cup winner Columbiana, Grand National winner Brother Jones, and Maryland Hunt Cup winners Peterski and Pine Rep. * Gallant Fox (1927) by Sir Gallahad III - 1930 Triple Crown winner and U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee. ::Among his progeny were 1935 Triple Crown winner Omaha. Through 2019 Gallant Fox remains the only U.S. Triple Crown winner to sire another U. S. Triple Crown winner. As well, Gallant Fox was the sire of Granville, the 1936 American Horse of the Year and a Hall of Fame inductee. Gallant Fox also sired Omaha's full brother Flares, who in 1936 had won the Newmarket Stakes sand in 1938 became only the second American-bred to ever win England's Ascot Gold Cup. * Fighting Fox (1935) by Sir Gallahad III - wins included the Grand Union Hotel Stakes, the Wood Memorial Stakes, Carter Handicap, Jamaica Handicap, and the Fleetwing Handicap in which he broke an Empire City track record that had stood for twenty-one years. Four days later he won the Massachusetts Handicap. ::Fighting Fox was the sire of Crafty Admiral, a 1952 Champion and the 1978 Leading broodmare sire in North America. * Foxbrough (1936) by Sir Gallahad III - sent to England as a yearling where he was that country's Two Year Old Champion. At age five in the United States he won the Yonkers and Butler Memorial Handicaps. ::Foxbrough was not successful as a sire.

The Marguerite Stakes In 1942 the Maryland Jockey Club announced there would be a new race to be inaugurated in 1945 for two-year-old fillies that would be named in honor of Marguerite. The race was created as a companion event to the Pimlico Futurity and declared to be one of the richest of its kind in the United States.

Text was copied from this source which is © European Medicines Agency. Reproduction is authorized provided the source is acknowledged. It contains brinzolamide and brimonidine tartrate. It is used as an eye drop. The most common side effects include ocular hyperaemia (red eye), allergic reactions in the eye, and dysgeusia (taste disturbances). Open-angle glaucoma (a condition where the aqueous humour, the watery fluid inside the eyeball, cannot drain away properly) and other causes of high pressure in the eye increase the risk of damage to the retina and the optic nerve (the nerve that sends signals from the eye to the brain). This can result in serious vision loss and even blindness. The active substances, brinzolamide and brimonidine tartrate, help to reduce intra-ocular pressure by reducing the production of aqueous humour. Brinzolamide works by blocking an enzyme called carbonic anhydrase, which produces bicarbonate needed for the production of the aqueous humour, while brimonidine tartrate blocks another enzyme known as adenylate cyclase, which is also involved in the production of the aqueous humour. Brimonidine also increases the drainage of aqueous humour from the front of the eye. Brinzolamide/brimonidine was approved for medical use in the United States in April 2013, and in the European Union in July 2014.  Medical uses  Brinzolamide/brimonidine is indicated to decrease of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in adults with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension for whom monotherapy provides insufficient IOP reduction.

In the game, players explore a mysterious island and attempt to find and capture the eponymous half-bug-half-snack creatures. The game was unveiled via an announcement trailer shown during Sony's PlayStation 5 livestreamed reveal event on June 11, 2020. British indie pop band Kero Kero Bonito performed the game's theme song, which was featured in the announcement trailer. The game is currently set for release on November 12, 2020 for the PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Microsoft Windows, and macOS. Plot Players control a newspaper reporter, who one day receives a film strip in the mail from Elizabert Megafig, a disgraced explorer. Megafig details the mysterious Snaktooth Island, inhabited by creatures called Bugsnax who are \\"half bug and half snack\\", and encourages the reporter to come to the island and document them for the world to see. Intrigued, the reporter make their way onto the island, only to discover from the native Grumpuses that Megafig has gone missing. Gameplay Bugsnax is a first-person adventure game, in which players traverse Snaktooth Island trying to find and capture different species of Bugsnax using various contraptions. Over 100 Bugsnak species are available for capture. Once captured, the Bugsnax can be fed to the local Grumpuses, which transforms their bodies based on the properties of whatever Bugsnak they eat. Development Young Horses took about six years to develop the game in order \\"not to burn out\\", as well as \\"to figure out what the game was.\\" The initial idea was when the company's creative director Kevin Zuhn drew a sketch of a \\"Wafflepillar\\"—a caterpillar made out of waffles. Initially the gameplay was inspired heavily by Pokémon Snap, but over time the gameplay evolved into \\"a weird amalgamation of all of these different game ideas.\\"' In addition to Pokémon Snap, the final game also takes inspiration from Ape Escape, Dark Cloud and Viva Piñata. The game was first revealed via an announcement trailer during Sony's Future Revealed PlayStation 5 event on June 11, 2020. The trailer featured the game's theme song \\"It's Bugsnax!\\", performed by British indie pop band Kero Kero Bonito. The song became popular in its own right, with GamesRadar calling it \\"the internet's new favorite meme ingredient\\", also writing \\"even if you haven't heard of Bugsnax, the game, there's a good chance you've probably heard Bugsnax, the theme tune.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Official website *Official reveal trailer Category:Upcoming video games scheduled for 2020 Category:Adventure games Category:Indie video games Category:PlayStation 5 games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Windows games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:macOS games Category:Single-player video games ","title":"Bugsnax"},{"id":"64249659","text":"Confederate Home 35 Coming Street Charles Drayton House George LaGrange Cook (1849–1919) was a photographer in Charleston, South Carolina.

Based in Montreal, it’s established as the first meal kit company in Canada. Cook it’s subscription service includes the delivery of boxes consisting of ingredient bags and recipe cards for breakfast and dinners and also offers ready-to-eat meals and complementary products such as beverages, snacks and lunch items. In December 2019, Cook it acquired the competing company Missfresh, and counts 30,000 subscribers to its service. Following a significant sales growth resulting in a wave of hirings, Cook it counts more than 500 employees and quits the status of SME in May 2020.  History = Cook it’s Foundation  Cook it was founded by Judith Fetzer, Patrick Chamberland and Thomas Dubrana in 2014. It was then the first meal kit company in Canada. Since its creation, the company's mission has focused on families and the idea of simplifying meal preparation for parents and young professionals. In June 2014, Judith and Patrick presented the company on the show Dans l'oeil du dragon, the Quebec version of Dragon’s Den. In 2016, Judith Fetzer presents once again Cook it on television, this time on the Canadian version of Dragon's Den. This time, she receives offers from four “dragons” (investors), and concludes a partnership with Arlene Dickinson. The same year, the registration of Judith Fetzer in the Adopte Inc. program, dedicated to supporting young entrepreneurs, led to her \\"adoption\\" by Alain Bouchard, who then became a mentor for Cook it’s development.  Acquisitions  In April 2017, 5 months after the arrival of Alain Bouchard as a mentor for the company, Cook it acquires Kuisto, a competing company, and merges its activities. Cook it makes a second competing business acquisition on December 9, 2019 with the purchase of MissFresh from the Metro supermarket chain. This operation doubles the size of Cook it, which therefore has 260 employees and 30,000 subscribers to its services.  Diversification and growth  In 2017, Cook it launched the first of its three À table avec Cook it magazines. In 2018, the company added a “pantry” shop to its offer, offering its customers the possibility to add various complementary food products to their box, such as snacks, lunch items and ready-to-eat meals. In November 2018, Cook it launches its “Sustainable Kit” as a pilot project, with the aim of making its service more eco-friendly and reducing packaging and waste. The sustainable Cook it Kit, then available in certain areas of Montreal, is delivered by bicycle with a cooler bag and reusable containers reclaimed with the next delivery. In April 2020, Cook it is expands its meal offer with “Brunch” recipes, decadent breakfasts suitable for different times of the day. This novelty follows the craze of Canadians for lunches, which the company observed with its “pantry” shop sales. In the spring of 2020, the containment situation linked to COVID-19 in Canada leads to a high increase in sales as the result of being classified as an essential service and delivering food to homes. This rapid growth leads to a massive hiring wave of around 200 new employees, Cook it then counts more than 500 employees.

It connected Burlington, Iowa with branches to Washington and Oskaloosa, Iowa. Incorporated in 1875 as the Burlington and Northwestern Narrow Gauge Railway Company, it began carrying traffic in 1876, when it also dropped 'narrow gauge' from its corporate name. The line reached Washington in 1880, operating over of track. In 1881, the Burlington and Western Railway Company, a subsidiary of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB&Q;) was formed to connect the line to Oskaloosa, completed in 1883. For two decades, both lines were operated as a single system, until on June 20, 1902, the system was widened to standard gauge and the B&NW; was adsorbed by the B&W.; Later that year, the system was leased to the CB&Q;, and in 1903, the entire system was deeded to the CB&Q.;W.

By 1892, the number of trestles had been reduced to 22 with an aggregate length of . The longest trestle was long. One bridge was installed, but the remainder of the reduction in trestles must have been the result of adding fill.Report of the Burlington & Northwestern Railway Company for the year ending June 30, 1892, Board of Railroad Commissioners Annual Report, 1892; pages 673-686. The B&NW; tracks ran north along Front Street in Burlington, Iowa, starting at the corner of Market and Front Streets, paralleling the BCR&N; tracks to a yard, turntable and roundhouse just north of Burlington. The B&NW; initially had a small storefront on Front Street, very near the south end of the line, but later used the BCR&N; depot. This was a double storefront on the corner of Jefferson and Front Streets, directly across Front Street from the Diamond Jo Line offices and steamboat docks.Sanborn Fire Insurance Map from Burlington, Des Moines County, Iowa, Sanborn Map Company, 1888; see map pages 4, 2, 10 (listed South to North).Henry Wellge, 1889 perspective map of the city of Burlington, Ia., American Publishing Co., Milwaukee, 1889; Library of Congress Map. Collection. Note: the label O marking the depot is on the wrong building. Later, the B&NW; tracks were apparently extended south into the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy yard to that line's freight house.Sanborn Fire Insurance Map from Burlington, Des Moines County, Iowa, Sanborn Map Company, 1900; see map pages 10, 4, 3, 40, 47, 48, 54, 58 (listed South to North). Note: The track layouts on maps 10 and 4 do not reconcile, so the evidence to track to the CB&Q; freight house is not solid. The B&NW; used the BCR&N; tracks for north of their Burlington yards. Since the latter was a standard-gauge line, 3-rail dual-gauge track was used.Burlington and North-western, Railway World, vol. 7, no. 29 (July 16, 1881); page 689. The line served the BCR&N; stations at Sperry and Mediapolis along this stretch. The climb from the Mississippi River at Burlington up to Sperry involved a long 1.15 percent grade following Dry Branch Creek; this appears to have been the ruling grade for the entire system. Just north of Mediapolis, the B&NW; turned west on its own right-of- way, passing through Yarmouth, on the way to Winfield. The route continued through Crawfordsville before reaching Washington, where tracks entered town street running north on 2nd St. (renamed 6th Ave. by 1902).Ben H. Wilson, Widening the Narrow Guage, The Palimpsest, vol. 13, no. 4 (1932); pages 154-165, see map, page 158. The line ended at a Wye just south of the Rock Island depot. The B&NW; Washington depot was inside the south end of the wye.Sanborn Fire Insurance Map from Washington, Washington County, Iowa, 1892; see detail map, page 2.Sanborn Fire Insurance Map from Washington, Washington County, Iowa, 1902; see map pages 7 and 6.  Burlington and Western  The Burlington and Western main-line was long, in addition to operating rights over of Burlington and Northwestern and Burlington, Cedar Rapids and Northern track into Burlington.

The B&W; line was constructed west from Winfield at the same time that the Iowa Central Railway was being built. The Iowa Central crossed the Burlington and Northwestern at Winfield, and the lines paralleled each other, crossing three times on the way to Oskaloosa. Battles for right-of-way between these two lines included confrontations where crews from both lines vandalized the work of their competitors.David Lotz and Charles Franzen, Rails to a County Seat, The Print Shop, Washington Iowa, 1989; pages 39-41 discuss the \\"Brighton Railroad Wars,\\" page 43 discusses the Mason Bogie. The B&W; route passed through Noble and Coppock on the way to Brighton, where it crossed the Iowa Central. Crooked Creek flows into the Skunk River just south of Coppock; both the B&W; and the Iowa Central had to build substantial bridges over both of these to reach the village. The bridge over the Skunk River, between Coppock and Brighton, was the site of some of the most intense battles between the B&NW; and Iowa Central. The two lines crossed again at Brighton. From Brighton, the line passed through Packwood and Pekin; between these two, it crossed the Milwaukee Road. From Pekin, it continued through Martinsburg to Hedrik where it crossed another branch of the Milwaukee. There were crossings of the Iowa Central both east and west of Hedrick. The line continued from Hedrick through Fremont and Cedar before entering Oskaloosa from the southeast. The Chicago and Northwestern branch to Muchakinock, Iowa, completed in 1884, crossed the line between Cedar and Oskaloosa.Annual Report of the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company for the Twenty-Sixth Fiscal Year Ending May 31, 1885 Initially, there was no station at this crossing, but in late 1886, citizens of the area petitioned for a station house, noting that as many as 30 passengers a day were transferring there, and a building was erected at the crossing.Citizens of Harrison Tp. v. Chicago & Northwestern and Burlington & Western, Ninth Annual Report of the Board of Railroad Commissioners, State of Iowa, Geo. Roberts, Des Moines, 1886; pages 607-608. Timetables list the new station as Stark. The B&W; crossed the Iowa Central again just inside the Oskaloosa city limits.Herald map of Mahaska County, Iowa, The Oskaloosa Herald, 1884; Library of Congress. The Oskaloosa depot was a block east of the Iowa Central depot. To get there, the B&W; had to cross the Rock Island tracks twice.Sanborn Fire Insurance Map from Oskaloosa, Mahaska County, Iowa; see map pages 3, 4, 16 and 9.  Traffic  Despite the fact that both ends of the Burlington and Northwestern were well served by standard-gauge railroads, it was reasonably profitable at first. For the fiscal year ending 1880, the balance sheet shows a profit of $13,394.44 and a return on investment of 6%. Passenger traffic earned $9,345.36, almost all local, with only 12 passengers ticketed onward to connecting lines. Local freight earned $24,554,61 and through freight, originating or ending on other lines, earned $11,966.84. By tonnage, 56% of the freight was grain, 16 percent was livestock, and 13 percent was lumber. No other category made up more than 4% of the freight.Report of the Burlington & Northwestern Railway Co. for the year ending June 30, 1880, Board of Railroad Commissioners Annual Report, 1880; pages 522-529. Between 1883 and 1889, however, the line paid no dividends and managed to eke out a profit of under $13,000, from which it paid the property taxes of the Burlington and Western, which ran at a net loss during that period.John T. Gerry, letter to W. W. Ainsworth, Twelfth Annual Report of the Board of Railroad Commissioners for the year ending June 30, 1889, State of Iowa, Ragsdale, Des Moines, 1889; page 805. By 1893, the line had returned to a modestly profitable condition.Burlington and Northwestern Railway,Poor's Manual of Railroads, 1894, page 733. The Burlington and Western with a route that closely paralleled by the Iowa Central, was not initially profitable. Passenger earnings for 1894 were 11,016.58, and freight earnings were $38,860.80.Burlington and Western Railroad, Poor's Manual of Railroads, 1894, page 733-734. Over the first 6 years of operation, it ran up a deficit of just over $43,000. The B&NW; and B&W; both owned railway post office cars. Post office reports indicated that these cars made 6 trips a week out and back. In 1884, the B&W; carried an average of 78 pounds of mail daily at an average speed of 12.75 MPH, including station stops along the route.Annual Report of the Postmaster-General of the United States for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1882, GPO, 1882; page 112, 210.Annual Report of the Postmaster-General of the United States for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1884, GPO, 1884; page 216. Just about every station on both lines had a local grain elevator for outgoing grain, but the Harrison Elevator in Burlington, Iowa handled all grain destined beyond the system. This elevator handled 4,000,000 bushels in 1882.The Harrison Elevator, Commercial and Statistical Review of the City of Burlington Iowa, J.L. Spalding & Co., 1882; page 120. The Elevator was a frame building located on the corner of Front and Court streets and had a capacity of 150,000 bushels, powered by a 60 horse-power steam engine.Sanborn Fire Insurance Map from Burlington, Des Moines County, Iowa, Oct. 1888; see map page 10. The elevator had a pair of bridges across the tracks evidently used for loading and unloading grain.Henry Wellge, 1889 perspective map of the city of Burlington, Ia., American Publishing Co., Milwaukee, 1889; Library of Congress Map Collection. After 1890, Coal was a major commodity handled by the Burlington and Western. Oskaloosa was a major coal producer in the late 19th century, and the Burlington and Western served at least two mines in the area. Thomas Long & Brothers opened a shaft deep in 1890 on the Iowa Central tracks near the west city limits of Oskaloosa. 10 to 20 miners could produce 100 tons per day. To reach this mine, the B&W; built a track west along 7th avenue in Oskaloosa, just south of the Rock Island tracks, crossing the Iowa Central wye and then paralleling the Iowa Central tracks to the mine.H. Foster Bain, Geology of Mahaska County; page 357 mentions the Long Brother's Mine.Ira J. Stoddard, Springer's Outline Map of Oskaloosa iowa, 1890, William Penn University, Wilcox Library, Mahaska County Collection; note, the 1910 map shows this spur relocated, perhaps after the mine closed in 1899.Sanborn Fire Insurance Map from Oskaloosa, Mahaska County, Iowa, 1910, Library of Congress Map Collection; note, the difference from the 1890 map may reflect changes made after the mine closed in 1899. The Long Brothers mine closed in 1899.Mine Site Information, Long Brothers, Garfield Township, Mahaska County, Iowa Coal Mines, Iowa Department of Natural Resources Coal Mine GIS. Lost Creek Fuel Company shaft number 1 in 1896. The Lost Creek Fuel Company had several mines about south of Oskaloosa. These mines were served by both the B&W; and the Iowa Central.Mahaska County, Second District, Report of the State Mine Inspectors, Legislative Documents, 26th General Assembly, State of Iowa, vol. III, H Murphy, Des Moines, 1896; page 50.James H. Lees, Chapter III History of Coal Mining in Iowa -- Mahaska County, in Iowa Geological Survey Annual Report, Des Moines, 1909; page 560.

Shaft 3 opened in 1904.Eddyville, The Ottumwa Courrier, Sept. 6, 1904; page 7, column 4, top. The siding serving these mines was built in 1895 and chartered as the Lost Creek Railway in 1896. It left the B&W; and Chicago and Northwestern mainlines at Stark where they crossed, and also connected with the Iowa Central before running south and west.Map of Mahaska County, Iowa, 1895, E. H. Gibbs, 1895; Library of Congress. The tracks are marked \\"Coal Road\\" on the map. The line is not listed as owning any locomotives or rolling stock.Lost Creek Ry, Poor's Manual of Railroads, 1897, page 848. The 1896 photograph of the pit head and tipple clearly shows at least 4 lines of dual-gauge track at the tipple, suggesting that the entire short line was dual gauge. Lost Creek Shaft number two was the site of Iowa's worst mine disaster in 1902.Phil Hoffmann, The Lost Creek Disaster, The Palimpsest, vol. 26, no. 1 (Jan. 1945); pages 21-27.Edward Sweeney, Accidents, Second District, Report of the State Mine Inspectors, Legislative Documents, 30th General Assembly, State of Iowa, vol. V, H Murphy, Des Moines, 1904; pages 47-50. Around 1900, the Chicago and North Western began operating over the north half of the Lost Creek Railway as they began constructing their branch to Buxton, Iowa, opened in 1901; it is unknown whether dual-gauge operations continued after this point.C&NW; Ry Will Soon be Histor, Pella chronicle, Dec. 17, 1936; page 4. Copy on the Chicago and North Western Historical Society web site, 2020.Harrison County, Atlas of Mahaska County, Iowa, 1905, Midland Map Co.; page 16. In Burlington, the BCR&N; and the B&NW; both had connections to what must have been a dual-gauge siding that went up to the foot of the bluff behind the BCR&N; Freight House to deliver coal to fuel the massive pumps of the Burlington Water Company and the coal bins of the adjacent gas works.Sanborn Fire Insurance Map from Burlington, Des Moines County, Iowa, Sanborn Map Company, 1900; see map pages 40, 47, 48.  Equipment  The Burlington and North Western had a small roster. Mixed trains were the rule; in 1881, the average train had 7 freight cars and 2 passenger cars. As of 1880, the B&NW; owned 3 locomotives (one newly purchased), 3 passenger cars, 2 mail/baggage combines, 39 boxcars and 11 flatcars. The heaviest locomotive weighed only 20.35 tons, and the heaviest passenger car weighed 10.25 tons. By 1884, the count of boxcars (including stock cars) had increased to 52 and the number of flatcars (including coal cars) had increased to 21. The line also had 2 cabooses, a necessity because none of the equipment was equipped with automatic brakes. All passenger equipment was equipped with Miller Platforms and couplers. By 1892, the line had 2 passenger, 2 freight, and 1 switch engine, 3 first-class passenger cars, 3 combines, 1 baggage/express car, 101 box cars, 6 stock cars, and 8 flat cars. Link and pin coupleres were still in use, but air brakes were in use. The Burlington and Western's roster was equally modest. In 1884, it had 3 locomotives, the heaviest weighing 22 tons, 2 passenger cars, 2 baggage cars (including mail cars), 70 boxcars, 20 stock cars, 15 flatcars and 15 coal cars. As with the B&NW;, no automatic brakes were in use, and passenger equipment used Miller Platforms. By 1892, the line had 2 passenger and 2 freight locomotives, 2 first-class passenger cars, 2 combines, 2 baggage/express cars, 115 boxcars, 22 stock cars, 74 flat cars and 55 coal cars. Coupling and braking systems matched those of the B&NW.; In February 1885, the B&NW; engine house burned, destroying engine number 1. The B&NW; purchased a replacement from the Denver, Utah and Pacific, a 2-8-6T Mason Bogie built in 1882. This became the new number 1 on the line, renumbered 11 in 1889.Burlington & Western, B&NW; Narrow Gauge Branch Lines, Burlington Bulletin No. 30, Burlington Route Historical Society, 1994; page 6. This was the largest locomotive used on these lines. A northbound B&W; train crossing Dry Branch Creek on the BCR&N; mainline circa 1898. Two standard- gauge cars riding on narrow-gauge trucks head the train. The problem of interchanging freight across the break of gauge to standard gauge lines was eventually solved by truck exchange. Incoming standard gauge cars were lifted off of their trucks using hydraulic jacks so that narrow gauge trucks could be rolled in. The reverse procedure was used for outgoing freight, so long as it was on cars that were compatible with standard gauge requirements.Minnier v. Sedalia, Warsaw and Southwestern Ry. Co., Supreme Court of Missouri, Vol 167, E. W. Stephens, 1902; page 112. Truck exchange was not confined to freight cars; for example, the general manager's business car was transferred to standard gauge trucks for his return home after the gauge was widened.Law at Winfield, Ottumwa (Semi-)Weekly Courrier, July 1, 1902; Page 4, column 3, top. Gauge Widening The possibility of widening the B&NW;/B&W; system to standard gauge was investigated as early as 1884, but serious examination of the problem only began in 1894, and work began in 1900. Preliminary work, done over two summers, involved replacing all of the 30 and 35 pound rail with 48 pound rail (on the B&NW;) and 65 pound rail (on the B&W;) and replacing over 85,000 railroad ties with ties long enough for standard gauge track. Another preliminary job involved planing seats in the ties spaced for standard gauge rails. This was done with a custom-made steam-powered planer mounted on a flatcar, essentially a pair of dado sets mounted on a shaft so that one dado set cut a new rail seat on each side of the tie. The final preparatory step was to drive all of the outside spikes needed to hold the standard-gauge rail and to pull as many inside spikes as was safe. The railroad encouraged press coverage of these preparations.Will Change the Track, Marshalltown Times Republican, June 14, 1902; page 3, column 4, top. With these preliminary jobs done, the actual gauge change was done on Sunday, June 29, 1902. Traffic was suspended for just 9 hours, with the last narrow-gauge trains used to drop off work crews and the first standard-gauge trains picking up the crews. 28 crews of 16 men each did the work of pulling the last spikes on the inside of each rail, shifting both rails outward, and driving new spikes. Several crews managed to work at sustained rates of one mile per hour when there were no complications, despite the heavy rains that fell that day.The Burlington & Western and Burlington & Northwestern, The Railway Age, vol. XXXIV, no. 1 (July 4, 1902); page 21.Converting Narrow to Broad Gauge, The Railway Magazine, Sept. 1902; page 249. Coffee and barrels of water were set out along the line for the crews, and each worker was provided with 15 sandwiches and a dozen hard-boiled eggs to fuel the day's work.Rebuild Iowa Railroad Within Very Few Hours, Ottumwa (Semi-)Weekly Courrier, July 1, 1902; Page 1, left top, continued on page 4, left top. Legacy The former B&W; line to Oskaloosa was abandoned in 1934, with segments sold to the Minneapolis and St. Louis (M&StL;), the successor of the Iowa Central. In effect, the M&StL; was finally able to undo awkward route choices that had been forced on the Iowa Central when these lines were built.Frank P. Donovan, The Minneapolis & St. Louis Railway, Iowa Railroads, H. Roger Grant, Ed, University of Iowa Press, 2000; page 41. The last train on the line to Washington was in 1979, and the line was abandoned after a wreck destroyed one of the bridges north of Burlington. The Rock Island, successor of the Burlington, Cedar Rapids and Northern owned that bridge and could not afford to repair it. The only remaining segment of the line is the trackage up Front Street in Burlington to the industrial area just south of Flint Creek, now the Burlington Junction Railway.

Ludwig is a pioneer of and innovator in the field of Baubotanik, the architectural realm of living plant construction.  Academic career and research areas  Ludwig began as an architecture student and graduated from the University of Stuttgart in 2012 with a dissertation titled “The Botanical Fundamentals of Baubotanik and their Application in Design”. In 2007, he co- founded the research group “Baubotanik” at the University of Stuttgart’s Institute of Architectural Theory and Design (IGMA) and served as a head research associate until 2017. Along with Daniel Schönle in 2010, Ludwig created “ludwig.schönle: Baubotanik - Architecture - Urbanism”, a collaborative office centering on incorporating the baubotanik approach in urban planning and architectural design. Ludwig has designed and created numerous Baubotanik projects around Germany, such as the Plane-Tree-Cube in Nagold in 2012, a Baubotanik Tower in 2009, and a Baubotanik Footbridge in 2005. The central focus of Ludwig’s research concerns integrating the growth processes of living plants into architectural design and construction. Merging living plants with architectural construction allows for the exploration of the creative and functional uses of plants in the context of building engineering. “Ferdinand Ludwig Builds Hybrids of Living Nature and Technology.” Designboom, 10 Nov. 2016, www.designboom.com/architecture/egger- ferdinand-ludwig-baubotanik-nature-11-10-2016/.The concept of Baubotanik is not only relevant in the fields of architecture and landscape architecture, but has increasingly been recognized as an adaptation method to climate change. Ludwig’s work additionally centers on the technical challenges that arise in Baubotanik, thereby broadening architectural knowledge by confronting aspects of growth and decay, and probability and chance in architectural design.

She studied piano under Alphonse Duvernoy at the Conservatoire de Paris, with composer Bernhard Stavenhagen in Münich, and with Leonid Kreutzer in Berlin.  Career = Solo career  When Drewett played a Beethoven piano concerto at London's Crystal Palace in 1905, a reviewer described the performance as \\"neat in execution and intelligent in conception\\". \\"Miss Drewett has intelligence, vigour, and expressive power in a high degree,\\" noted another reviewer that year, \\"in addition to which she has that which cannot be taught – genuine and infectious pleasure in her own playing.\\" She played in Belfast, Vienna, and Berlin in 1908. She visited with writer Ossip Schubin during a stay in Germany in 1908. She played at the Proms in 1913. In 1922, Drewett wrote about the music scene in Berlin for Fanfare, a London-based periodical. In Canada, she played in a piano ensemble performance, with four male pianists (Ernest Seitz, Viggo Kihl, Reginald Stewart, and Alberto Guerrero) in Edmonton in 1927. She also played at the debut performance of the Conservatory String Quartet in 1929.  With Géza de Kresz  Drewett was perhaps best known for her long professional association with her husband, Hungarian violinist Géza de Kresz.

At around 11 a.m. on 27 February 2020, two Russian Sukhoi Su-34 and two Syrian Su-22 fighter jets started intensive bombing raids of Turkish-backed rebel forces in the southern countryside of Syria's Idlib province. According to Russian sources, after 1 p.m., Turkish troops conducted more than 15 MANPADS attacks against the Russian and Syrian jets, with some Russian aircraft allegedly suffering damage while evading the fire. At around 5 p.m., a 400-man Turkish mechanized infantry battalion traveling in a convoy was targeted by an airstrike on the road between al-Bara and Balyun, around five kilometers north of Kafr Nabl. A light airstrike by a Su-22s halted the convoy, after which more intense bombing forced the Turkish soldiers to take shelter in the nearby buildings. The Russian jets then reportedly dropped KAB-1500L laser-guided bombs on the Turkish positions, collapsing two buildings and leaving a number of soldiers under the rubble. Russia denied it carried out airstrikes in the area and stated it made attempts to ensure the Syrian military ceased firing to allow the evacuation of the Turkish troops, but noted the Turkish forces should not have been in the area, where \\"counter- terror operations\\" were taking place, and that Turkey failed to notify it about the soldiers' presence in advance. On 28 February, the Defense Ministry of Turkey stated that a day after 33 of their soldiers were killed in the air strike, artillery fire was launched by Syrian forces in northwest Idlib province of Syria, which led to the killing of one Turkish soldier and two others injured. The Turkish military also continued to attack Syrian Government targets in the region as well, according to the defense ministry. Turkey said it retaliated for Balyun strikes by striking 200 Syrian government targets and 309 soldiers. NATO and the US expressed support for Turkey and urged Russia to engage with UN ceasefire efforts, while the UN expressed concern at developments. Northeastern Syria On 12 February, government supporters blocked and pelted a US military convoy passing through Qamishli town in northeastern Syria, which led to a clash with US troops, killing one civilian and injuring another. There is no certainty as to whether the civilian that got killed was armed or not, a monitoring group stated. Local sources and US officials said that pro-Syrian militia fighters were also part of the stand off. According to the coalition spokesman Col. Myles Caggins, the coalition troops were compelled to exchange fire in an act of self-defense and that the incident is under investigation. On 16 February, at least 55 vehicles of the US military convoy had been spotted entering Al-Hasakah province in northeastern Syria from Iraq, according to pro-Damascus sources. March 2020 After the attack in northwest Idlib on 27 February, which caused the death of dozens of Turkish soldiers, Turkey declared on 1 March, that it was starting a major counteroffensive against Bashar al-Assad’s government. The announcement was made by Turkey’s defense minister Hulusi Akar, after which he described the decision as an attempt to prevent the Syrian government from launching dangerous attacks against Syrians, as well as to ensure the establishment of an extensive ceasefire in the region. Two Syrian fighter jets were reported to have been shot down in Idlib province by a Turkish F-16, as the offensive against Syrian forces intensifies. The pilots managed to eject from the jets and land safely at the clash site between Syrian forces and Turkish troops in Idlib province, the BBC added. Also, the Syrian media confirmed that there were no casualties in the northwestern Idlib attack. The defense minister of Turkey maintained that in addition to the shooting down of the two Syrian military aircraft in the offensive known as Operation Spring Shield, he disclosed that Turkey had killed over 2,000 Syrian government troops. On 1 March, the 2020 Daraa clashes began. On 5 March, a meeting was held between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan, after which both parties agreed to a military ceasefire in Idlib province of northwestern Syria.

Despite fears of a spill over from Syria affecting neighbouring Lebanon, it was conversely the collapse of the Lebanese pound that plunged Syria deeper into its economic quagmire.

Yevimov: Syria and Russia will not be defeated by economic terrorism SANA,13th June 2020. Russia stepped in to provide mediation between Turkish and Syrian forces, to avert conflict between the two countries on the ground in Syria. Russian forces also carried out joint patrols with Turkish forces, creating a commonality of interest between the Syrian and Turkish governments. Why do Russia’s patrols in Syria keep running into trouble? According to reports, there were tensions on June 2 when a Russian vehicle tried to enter some areas near Derik in eastern Syria. By SETH J. FRANTZMAN JUNE 4, 2020. The SDF still nominally controls much of eastern Syria. But an uneasy and bizarre peace reigns: Russia and Turkey do joint patrols in one area, while the US, supposedly a Turkish ally, patrols in another area. Turkey claims the SDF are terrorists, even though the SDF defeated ISIS. Russia also ended up doing patrols in Idlib because the Russian-backed Syrian regime launched an offensive in February that clashed with Turkish troops in Idlib. Russia stepped in to enforce a ceasefire. Russia is a sort of referee in Syria. But like all referees, it can’t be all things to everyone. Kurds are disappointed Russia didn’t do more to support them, and Syrian rebels despise Russia for aiding the Assad regime. The US doesn’t like the Russians. Only Turkey and Russia seem to get along well. After the June 2 incident near Derik, another incident developed on Thursday. Long lines of civilian cars were backed up as US and Russian soldiers squared off. Reports indicated the US stopped the Russians from entering Derik, and the Russians had to go back to Qamishli. Something else may be afoot. The Russians may be seeking to expand their presence and build a base near Qasir Dib, a village near Derik, according to Sirwan Kajjo of VOA news. The US may not want Russia expanding its footprint even more. The full details of what caused the standoff are still unclear. Meanwhile, Russian and Turkish soldiers carried out their 15th joint patrol near Idlib. Russia and the United States continuously argued publicly over the role played by each country in Syrian politics. Russia noted that its military presence had the approval of Syria's government.
