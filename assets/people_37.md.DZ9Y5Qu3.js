Among his most outstanding results he has been awarded a total of 12 medals at Pan American Championships in several different age categories, making him the top Argentinian medalist in wrestling history. He also received the Revelation Sports Clar√≠n Award in 2004, winner of the Jorge Newbery award in 2005 as the best athlete of the City of Buenos Aires in this field, and was nominated many times for the best Argentinian athlete award.  Biography  Born in Corrientes, Argentina, in a humble neighborhood of the Corrientes capital (Laguna seca). At the age of six he moved to Buenos Aires with his family because of his father's work. In his early years of sport activity he performed various sports such as swimming and gymnastics, but at the age of seven he became more interested in Olympic Wrestling. He competed locally with good results from the beginning, and that motivated his commitment to the sport. His first appearance in international events representing his country was in 2001 in the neighboring country of Chile, where he won the gold medal in the International Tournament Barros Arana. And since then, his name has not stopped appearing in international competitions at a Pan-American and global level. Despite his young age he has won multiple international titles representing his country professionally. Among the most outstanding results are a total of 12 medals at the Pan American Championships in various age categories, making it the largest Argentinian medalist in his discipline in the history. He was also the first Argentinian medalist at the Pan American Games of XVI Pan American Games Guadalajara 2011 after 20 years of Argentina not obtaining a medal in the event. Yuri ha's won several awards over the course of the years, such as the Sports Ministry of the Province of Corrientes to outstanding athletes in this province, the Revelation Sports Clar√≠n Award in 2004, the Jorge Newbery Award in 2005 for the best athlete of the City of Buenos Aires and was nominated several times to the Olympia awards for best Argentinian athlete in the category of wrestling. Nowadays he belongs to the KAV Mansfelder Land E.V. Club for whom he wrestles in the Ringen Bundesliga (German League of Wrestling). Olympic Wrestling is not a popular sport in Argentina so Yuri has had to cross the borders of his native country since the beginning of his career, to stand out and get better training. He spent several seasons training in countries such as Cuba, America, Germany and Russia. Because of this, he had to spend long periods away from home. To get the results he is aiming for he needs to be moved to the city of Vladikavkaz, Russia in 2012 in order to prepare for the Olympic Games of Rio de Janeiro 2016. Yuri Olimpia won the Silver award 2013 as best fighter of the year.

It is endemic to Florida in the United States, where it occurs only on the Lake Wales Ridge along with many other rare plants. It is threatened by the loss and degradation of its habitat, and it is federally listed as an endangered species. This is a perennial herb growing 30 centimeters to one meter in height from a cylindrical corm. The glandular leaves are linear in shape and the longest near the base of the plant may reach 15 centimeters long. The inflorescence is a flower head containing up to 30 disc florets. It is lined with purple-edged green phyllaries and contains tubular lavender corollas. This plant grows in Florida scrub habitat on the Lake Wales Ridge of Central Florida. It grows on rosemary balds in areas of sand pine scrub, open areas where sunlight reaches through the canopy of taller vegetation. It also grows in the ecotone between open sunny areas and shaded understory, showing some preference for shade.Liatris ohlingerae. Center for Plant Conservation. It often grows beneath Florida rosemary (Ceratiola ericoides) bushes, and is apparently resistant to the allelopathic compounds the rosemary produces.USFWS. Liatris ohlingerae Five-year Review. August 2010. It is pollinated by butterflies. This relationship is necessary for the plant's reproduction, because it is self-incompatible, unable to fertilize itself. The plant is relatively long-lived, often living over nine years. Herbivory often impacts the plant. Its flower production is reduced as the plants are \\"topped\\" by browsing vertebrates, particularly white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Up to 30% of flower buds are consumed by boring insects. After the seeds are dispersed they are heavily predated by insects and vertebrates. As of 2009 there were 91 occurrences of the plant. Some are on protected land, so their habitat will not be lost to development or agriculture. However, even protected land is often improperly managed. It lacks the natural fire regime on which the Florida scrub ecosystem depends. When fire burns the habitat, this plant can resprout from its corm.

The building is an early example of Functionalist architecture in Denmark. History Hotel Astoria in 1935 The building was designed as a station hotel for the Danish State Railways by Ole Falkentorp, who had started his career in the State Railways' design office before forming his own practice. The hotel was built from 1934 to 1935 as the first luxury hotel in Copenhagen.\\"Astoria\\", HotelBoard. Retrieved 6 May 2011. In 2007, Hotel Astoria was taken over by DGI-byen. The new owner commissioned GUBI to redesign the interior while preserving many of the original features. The revolving doors, the first in Denmark, are still present at the main entrance, and one of the luxury rooms has been maintained exactly as it was in 1935. Relying on black and white set off by tones of deep purple and greyish blue, a new colour scheme has been selected and the building has been fitted out with artistically designed, custom-made furniture. On 1 July 2011 the hotel was taken over by Zleep Hotels.\\"Zleep Hotels handlede hurtigt og overtager Hotel Astoria\\", takeoff.dk, 13 July 2011, . Retrieved 13 July 2011. On 1 January 2014, Br√∏chner Hotels took over management of the hotel. Architecture Hotel Astoria The hotel consists of a long slender wing forming a barrier between the courtyard in front of the main entrance to the Central Station, which partly opens to the underground rail lines, and Reventlowsgade, the street on the Vesterbro side of the station. An example of architecture parlante, the building is intended to resemble a steam locomotive, with its connotations of travel and movement encapsulating the essence of the site, and as an expression of the fascination with progress and technology which was typical of the time. It consists of an expressive constellation of cubist volumes, culminating in the narrow facade looking out over Vesterbrogade which is topped by a \\"hood ornament\\" in the shape of a winged wheel bearing a crown, a sculptural representation of the old logo of the Danish State Railways. The vertical, exterior hotel sign is in the full height of the building. At the other end of the building, there is a cylindrical staircase tower with a helical window. Great care was taken by E. Schmidt, the technical designer, in drawing up the detailed specifications for a building which was to be constructed using Asger Skovgaard Ostenfeld's recently developed deformation technique for reinforced concrete structures. The finish on the four-inch- thick walls with metal-framed windows was achieved by manual bush hammering.\\"Proceedings, American Concrete Institute, Volume 33\\", 1937, p. 530.Karl-Eugen Kurrer, \\"The history of the theory of structures: from arch analysis to computational mechanics\\", Ernst & Sohn, 2008, p.755.

Because of the group's alleged tactics and targeting of perceivably-vulnerable minorities, the group has gained infamy from many critics who label the organization as a \\"hate group\\" or a \\"Christian\\" analogy for the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah (lit. \\"Army of God\\"). They have also been likened to a cult, and compared widely with Westboro Baptist Church. The group was led by former Department of Energy security guard and self-designated \\"pastor\\" David Grisham. Activities Among the number of notable actions and campaigns taken by the group include protests against supposed swingers, LGBT people, abortion clinics, Muslims, Buddhists, Wiccans, Episcopalians, Methodists, Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholics, and a myriad of other groups. Boycott against Houston, Texas In January 2010, the group launched a boycott campaign against the city of Houston, Texas, due to the election of openly gay mayor Annise Parker and the construction of an abortion clinic in the city. Theological controversy Within Christian circles, the group has become a source of debate for apologeticists, many of whom disagree or reject the doctrine of spiritual mapping and territorial spirits, among other doctrinal issues. Amarillo Citizens against Repent Amarillo Amarillo Citizens against Repent Amarillo also known by the acronym ACARA is the counter-movement to Repent Amarillo. They are protesters made up of Christians, Muslims, Jews, Buddhists and atheists who gathered at Sam Houston Park in order to challenge the plan of David Grisham of activist group Repent Amarillo, to burn the Quran on a grill (the book had been doused with kerosene). While Grisham was arguing with a group of women that placed their hands on the grill asking if he'd burn them too, it was when Grisham lit his lighter anyway that a 23-year-old skateboarding member named Jacob Isom snuck up from behind him, grabbed the Quran from Grisham's hands, and ran off after saying, \\"Dude, you have no Quran\\"; afterwards, Isom handed the book to a religious leader from the Islamic Center of Amarillo. Isom was presented with a \\"Medal of Reasonableness\\" at the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear for his action. He immediately threw the medal into the crowd. Of notable mention is the wide range of classes ACARA has within its ranks. Two well known members ran for Mayor of Amarillo, contesting David Grisham every step of the way.

Two Union gunboats tried to prevent the Confederates from installing a battery on the Potomac at Mathias Point in King George County, Virginia. A landing party prepared to install their own battery, but were beaten back before they could unload their guns from the . Cannon fire from this vessel kept the Confederates temporarily at bay, and Commander James H. Ward ordered another landing. This was also repulsed, and Ward was killed, becoming the first Union Navy officer to be killed in the war. The Confederates held this position until March 1862. Background On April 15, 1861, the day after the small U.S. Army garrison surrendered Fort Sumter in the harbor Charleston, South Carolina to Confederate forces, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers to reclaim federal property and to suppress the rebellion begun by the seven Deep South slave states which had formed the Confederate States of America. Four Upper South states which also permitted slavery, including Virginia, refused to furnish troops for this purpose and began the process of secession from the Union.Hansen, Harry. The Civil War: A History. New York: Bonanza Books, 1961. . p. 48 On April 17, 1861, a convention in Richmond, Virginia, immediately passed an ordinance providing for Virginia's secession from the Union and authorized the governor to call for volunteers to join the military forces of Virginia to defend the state against Federal military action.Scharf, John Thomas.

On April 27, 1861, he extended the blockade of the Southern states that he had declared on April 19, 1861, to include the ports of Virginia and North Carolina.Long, E. B. and Barbara Long.

Ward, commander of the Union Potomac Flotilla, learned that the Confederates were installing a battery on a wooded promontory at Mathias Point in King George County, Virginia, that would effectively control traffic on the Potomac River at that point. This not only could prevent men and supplies from moving to and from Washington, D.C. via the Potomac River but would permit communication between Confederate forces and Confederate sympathizers in southern Maryland across the river or even permit a Confederate raid into Maryland.

Lt. Chaplin evacuated his party to their small boats after the initial Confederate approach in force. The cannon fire from the Thomas Freeborn beat back the counterattack. Ward ordered Chaplin to land again and throw up sand bag breastworks when the firing from the Thomas Freeborn temporarily quieted the Confederate force. After coming under fire from the Thomas Freeborn, Colonel Ruggles ordered that his men, under the immediate command of Colonel J. M. Brockenbrough, approach through the forest where the Union force was at work in order not to expose the men to fire over an open field. This delayed their further counterattack. Meanwhile, Chaplin and his small force hastily completed the construction of the small breastwork and after trying to hide the exact location of the work with branches, again began to withdraw from the shore about 5:00 p.m. in order to retrieve their artillery. At this time, the Confederates, further supported by four companies of men under the command of Major R. M.

In the meantime, after the gunner on the Thomas Freeborn was wounded, Commander Ward was shot through the abdomen by a rifle shot while trying to sight the ship's gun and died after about 45 minutes. His mortal wounding unsettled the crew of the Thomas Freeborn and they fired no more rounds in support of Chaplin's force even though they had not fully withdrawn to the Thomas Freeborn and the Reliance. Ward was the only member of the Union force killed at the battle, although four others were badly wounded.Ruggles, 1881, pp. 499-500.

Aftermath The Confederates continued to hold their position and operate the battery on Mathias Point, which they completed placing on the point on the day after the battle. They were not attacked by land forces and did not abandon the location and nearby batteries until Confederate forces withdrew from Manassas and other northern Virginia locations on March 9, 1862 in order to protect Richmond from Union forces which were being deployed for the Peninsula Campaign.Parker, William H.

Map of Salt Creek Watershed History In the 1936 centennial history of Liberty Township, the nineteenth century Salt Creek watershed is described: \\"As the years passed the land has been drained by various ditch projects and the forests have bowed before the axes of the pioneers and their descendants. These two factors have contributed to a gradual shrinking of the size of the streams and lakes. Any one doubting this has but to observe the difference between the banks of our creeks and the present streams or study old maps of the township showing the great millponds which have disappeared. Such maps published as late as 1876 show a great expanse of water in the northwest, spreading over acres of land which are now the fertile fields of August Hockelberg, Daly Brothers and Julius Turk. Anyone looking at Salt Creek, now even in time of flood, can hardly realize that there was once a project for boats to steam down Salt Creek to convey grain and lumber to Chicago by way of the Calumet river.\\" The Salt Creek watershed was criss- crossed historically by important Indian trails. The \\"Pottawatomie Trail\\" was the north end of a major path from the Wabash River to Lake Michigan and after entering Porter County, and passing east of what is now Valparaiso, this trail followed the crest of the moraine between Coffee Creek and Salt Creek and ended at the beach. Watershed and course The Salt Creek watershed covers 19% of Porter County and , including the communities of Valparaiso, South Haven, Portage and Burns Harbor, Indiana. The watershed begins in the physiographic unit known as the Valparaiso Morainal Area. The Valparaiso Moraine, located south of the Lacustrine Plain, is an arc-shaped moraine complex that parallels the southern shore of Lake Michigan. The moraine divides LaPorte and Porter County into northern and southern drainage areas. The area north drains into Lake Michigan; south of the moraine water drains to the Kankakee River. Numerous kettle lakes sit on the moraine. Ecology Many rare species in the Salt Creek watershed are found in Samuelson Fen and related habitats at Imagination Glen Park in Portage. Surveys of the 33 acre (13 hectare) fen have found 201 species of plants, the vast majority being native species, including state threatened great Saint John‚Äôs-wort (Hypericum pyramidatum) and smaller forget-me-not (Myosotis laxa), and more than 400 insect species, including the Indiana rare Baltimore checkerspot butterfly (Euphydryas phaeton) and sedge skipper butterfly (Euphyes dion) and state threatened big broad-winged skipper butterfly (Poanes viator viator) and starry campion moth (Hadena ectypa). A threatened species is a species that is likely to become endangered in the near future. Wetlands, including a fen, in the Salt Creek headwaters should also be investigated further since the uncommon bog species tamarack (Larix laricina) has been observed there. The state threatened small cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccos) has been found at another wetland in the Salt Creek headwaters. Although they are no longer on the Indiana list of endangered species, both the American badger (Taxidea taxus) and bobcat (Lynx rufus) have been found within the Salt Creek watershed in recent years. These two species were on Indiana‚Äôs original endangered species list established in 1969, but have since improved their populations statewide and were removed from the list in July 2005. They are now protected as nongame species that cannot be hunted or trapped intentionally. Beaver (Castor canadensis) were hunted for their fur since the era of the French trappers only to be extirpated from Indiana by 1900. 1935 re-introductions of Wisconsin and Michigan beaver into Indiana were successful and the aquatic herbivorous mammal was spotted in the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore beginning in 1968. Whitaker reported a beaver colony in Salt Creek in 1994 as well as beaver sign in the lower portions of the Little Calumet River. Beaver create wetlands which remove sediment and pathogens and increase trout and salmon abundance as their ponds make ideal fish-rearing habitat. Research in the western United States, found that extensive loss of beaver ponds resulted in an 89% reduction in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) smolt summer production and an almost equally detrimental 86% reduction in critical winter habitat carrying capacity. Contrary to popular myth, most beaver dams do not pose barriers to trout and salmon migration, although they may be restricted seasonally during periods of low stream flows. Pollution and conservation Portions of lower Salt Creek are now protected by Indiana Dunes National Park. In the uppermost watershed, the Save the Dunes non-profit environmental organization won a $607,000 United States Environmental Protection Agency grant to naturalize the Thorgren detention basin, a joint project with the city of Valparaiso, that will improve local streams, provide wildlife habitat and ultimately protect Lake Michigan waters. The grass and cement lined 2-acre detention basin will be restored with wetland plants which filter sediment, pollutants, fertilizer and bacteria so that it not only catches flood waters but also improves water quality. From there the water drains into Smith Ditch, then makes its way into Sager‚Äôs Lake, Salt Creek, Little Calumet River, and then Lake Michigan. Recreation Salt Creek, along with the Little Calumet River and Trail Creek, is stocked by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources with steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), and coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). These fish are non-native potamodromous salmonids from the West Coast which run up from Lake Michigan to the creeks where they were stocked in an attempt to spawn, although Indiana's creeks are too warm for significant salmonid reproduction, requiring regular re-stocking.

History The SPR-2 was publicly shown in 2007 to visitors, including Vice President Jusuf Kalla.https://www.angkasareview.com/2018/07/08/mengenal-pindad-spr-2-senapan- antimaterial-karya-anak-bangsa/ The SPR-4 was unveiled by Pindad in October 2017 when the company announced it alongside the production of a new ammunition facility with a loan granted by Penyertaan Modal Negara or State Capital Participation to VIPs, including President Jokowi.https://news.detik.com/berita-jawa-timur/d-3676979/ini-dia-senapan- khusus-penembak-jitu-buatan-pt-pindad It is being marketed to India in cooperation with Bhukhanvala Industries to market it for future contracts to the Indian military and law enforcement agencies.https://web.archive.org/web/20180607105148/https://www.janes.com/article/80549/pt- pindad-expands-co-operation-with-indian-firms Variants= SPR-1  The SPR-1 is a single-shot sniper rifle chambered for the 7.62√ó51mm NATO cartridge. Referred to as a \\"Precision Tactical Rifle\\" by Pindad, the SPR-1 is in fact essentially a well-made version of a locally-available hunting rifle (probably based on the Remington 700), brought to military/police sniper standards. Changes from the original rifle include the addition of a Harris- type bipod adjustable for height and cant, the addition of an adjustable cheekpiece for the standard thumbhole stock, and a rail for the mounting of various scope rings. The barrel also has what Pindad refers to as a \\"muzzle brake,\\" but this merely consists of a pair of angled cuts near the front of the muzzle, and is therefore just a form of porting. Feed is from an internal magazine, with a hinged floorplate for reloading and unloading the weapon. The stock is of laminated, weatherproofed wood, and the metalwork of high-grade steel with a corrosion-resistant finish. SPR-2 The SPR-2 is a .50 BMG anti-materiel rifle which is fed from a 5-round box magazine. It has a range of 2,000 meters (2 kilometers) and it can be equipped with a suppressor. The SPR-2 can be used to penetrate steel plating for up to 2 centimeters. The weapon has a foldable carry handle, which is used to carry it in case of short distance. The SPR-2 has a picatinny rail on the upper receiver to allow the easy installation of any optics with a foldable monopod on the stock. Its design appears to be based on the Zastava M93.http://weaponsystems.net/weaponsystem/AA05%20-%20SPR-2.html SPR-3 The SPR-3 is a magazine-fed variant of the SPR-1, chambered in 7.62x51mm NATO ammo. It was developed to replace the SPR-1 in Indonesian service.http://weaponsystems.net/weaponsystem/AA05%20-%20SPR-3.html The weapon is designed with a skeleton stock that has a foldable monopod with a free- floating barrel and a large multi-slot muzzle broke. Its design was based on the SPR-2. With a suppressor installed, the SPR-3 can be fired from up to 500 meters if subsonic ammunition is used. SPR-4 The SPR-4 is a .338 Lapua Magnum magazine-fed sniper rifle. It has an effective range of 1500 meters, which serve to fulfill firepower gaps between the SPR-1/SPR-3 and SPR-2.https://www.pindad.com/senjata-spr-4-buatan-pindad-punya-daya- tembak-15-kilometer It has a capacity of five rounds.https://www.wartaekonomi.co.id/read157176/penuhi-kebutuhan-tni-pindad- rilis-senapan-spr-4.html Users * : Exported SPR-2s to Fiji.https://finance.detik.com/industri/d-2716193/orang-as-dan-australia-tak- percaya-ri-bisa-buat-senjata-canggih-ini * : SPR-2s/3s used by the TNI. 150 SPR-2s known to be used by Kopassus forces.https://news.okezone.com/read/2016/02/22/337/1318110/senjata-canggih- milik-kopassus-yang-bikin-mata-dunia-terbelalak?page=2 Future * : Laos has expressed an interest to acquire SPR-2s in a potential contract in a meeting between Pindad representatives and Laotian officials on September 21, 2017.http://www.en.netralnews.com/news/business/read/11808/lao.ministry.of.defense.expresses.interest.to.repurchase.weapons.from.pt.pindadhttps://www.armyrecognition.com/september_2017_global_defense_security_news_industry/laos_show_interest_to_buy_small_weapons_from_pt_pindad_of_indonesia.html  References External Links * Official Pindad SPR-2 page * Official Pindad SPR-3 page Category:.50 BMG sniper rifles Category:7.62√ó51mm NATO rifles Category:Sniper rifles Category:Firearms of Indonesia Category:Firearms articles needing expert attention Category:Post‚ÄìCold War military equipment of Indonesia Category:Bolt-action rifles Category:Sniper rifles of Indonesia ","title":"Pindad SPR"},{"id":"31672752","title":"Oakville (provincial electoral district)"},{"id":"31672783","text":"Glyceryl behenate is a fat used in cosmetics, foods, and oral pharmaceutical formulations.

It is a selected form of Thryptomene saxicola, a species from Western Australia. Description Thryptomene 'F.C. Payne' is an open, evergreen shrub with a slightly weeping habit, growing to 1 metre high. It produces masses of long- stalked small pale pink flowers starting in winter and continuing through spring that are attractive to various insects including butterflies. The aromatic leaves are small, about 6 or 7 mm long, and narrow towards the stem. Origin In his Handbook of trees and shrubs for the Southern Hemisphere published in 1959, Richmond E. Harrison noted that the cultivar Thryptomene paynei, then newly introduced to New Zealand was \\"raised by FC Payne of Adelaide\\". F.C. Payne was the owner of \\"The Sanctuary\\" plant nursery in Ashton, South Australia on the outskirts of Adelaide who promoted the use of Australian native plants in local gardens. By 1967 the cultivar had become a \\"garden favorite\\" in Australia and was featured in a gardening guide for native plants in The Australian Women's Weekly. The cultivar has variously been referred to as var. paynei, 'Paynei', 'Paynes', 'Payne's Hybrid' and 'Payne's Selection' Cultivation Plants may be grown as a low informal hedge or for cut flowers. They are adaptable to most situations, but prefer well drained soil in a sunny or partly shaded position. The cultivar is widely available in most parts of Australia through plant nurseries. It requires propagation through cuttings to be true to the parent plant. References Category:Cultivars of Australian plants Category:Garden plants of Australia F.C. Payne ","title":"Thryptomene 'F.C.

Vessels arrive over time and the terminal operator needs to assign them to berths to be served (loading and unloading containers) as soon as possible. Different factors affect the berth and time assignment of each vessel. Among models found in the literature, there are four most frequently observed cases: # discrete vs. continuous berthing space, # static vs. dynamic vessel arrivals, # static vs. dynamic vessel handling times, and # variable vessel arrivals. In the discrete problem, the quay is viewed as a finite set of berths. In the continuous problem, vessels can berth anywhere along the quay and the majority of research deals with the former case. In the static arrival problem all vessels are already at the port whereas in the dynamic only a portion of the vessels to be scheduled are present. The majority of the published research in berth scheduling considers the latter case. In the static handling time problem, vessel handling times are considered as input, whereas in the dynamic they are decision variables. Finally, in the last case, the vessel arrival times are considered as variables and are optimized. Technical restrictions such as berthing draft and inter-vessel and end-berth clearance distance are further assumptions that have been adopted in some of the studies dealing with the berth allocation problem, bringing the problem formulation closer to real world conditions. Introducing technical restrictions to existing berth allocation models is rather straightforward and it may increase the complexity of the problem but simplify the use of metaheuristics (decrease in the feasible space). Some of the most notable objectives addressed in the literature are: # Minimization of vessel total service times (waiting and handling times), # Minimization of early and delayed departures, # Optimization of vessel arrival times, # Optimization of emissions and fuel consumption. Problems have been formulated as single and multi-objective as well as single and bi-level.

The Stella d'Italia (\\"Star of Italy\\"), popularly known as Stellone d'Italia (\\"Great Star of Italy\\"), is a five-pointed white star symbolizing Italy for many centuries. It is the oldest national symbol of Italy, since it dates back to ancient Greece when Venus, associated with the West as an evening star, was adopted to identify the Italian peninsula. From an allegorical point of view, the Stella d'Italia metaphorically represents the shining destiny of Italy. In the early 16th century it began to be frequently associated with Italia turrita, the national personification of the Italian peninsula. The Stella d'Italia was adopted as part of the emblem of Italy in 1947, where it is superimposed on a steel cogwheel, all surrounded by an oak branch and an olive branch. Symbolic value Emblem of Italy, with the central Stella d'Italia. From an allegorical point of view, the Star of Italy metaphorically represents the shining destiny of Italy. Its unifying value is equal to that of the flag of Italy. In 1947 the Stella d'Italia was inserted at the center of the emblem of Italy, which was designed by Paolo Paschetto and which is the iconic symbol identifying the Italian State. The Italian Star is also recalled by some honors. The Italian Star is recalled by the Colonial Order of the Star of Italy, decoration of the Kingdom of Italy which was intended to celebrate the Italian Empire, as well as by the Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity, the first decoration established by Republican Italy, which was replaced in 2011 by the Order of the Star of Italy, second civil honorary title in importance of the Italian State. The Star of Italy is also recalled by the stars worn on the collars of Italian military uniforms and appears on the figurehead of the Italian Navy. In the civil sphere, the Italian Star is the central symbol of the emblem of the Club Alpino Italiano.  History =From ancient Greece to the Roman era The Stella d'Italia on the first coins of a united Italy The symbolism that sees a star associated with Italy was born in ancient Greece, and this is why it is the oldest national symbol of Italy and originated from the combination of Venus, as an evening star, with the West and therefore with the Italian peninsula, one of which denominations it was Esperia, or \\"land of Hesperus, the star of the Evening consecrated to Venus\\". This symbolism is already attested in archaic Greek literature: in the 6th century BC, the poet Stesichorus, in the poem Iliupersis (Fall of Troy), in creating the legend of Aeneas, described his return to the land of his ancestors (the Italy) after the defeat of Troy, under the leadership of Venus. The story of Aeneas' journey to the Italian coast from the maternal star of Venus is then resumed in Roman times by Pliny the Elder, by Marcus Terentius Varro and by Virgil, giving rise to a double tradition: the political tradition of Caesaris Astrum, the star of Julius Caesar which originated from the appearance of a comet star shortly after his death and which was also recalled by Augustus as an auspicious sign and as a prefiguration of the Pax Romana, and the toponymy and literary tradition of Greek origin of Italy called Esperia, the \\"land on which the evening star sets\\", that is Venus. The merger of the two traditions associated the star with Italy, the center of the Roman Empire and never considered a province, having a special administrative status, being divided into the Augustan regions. The first association between the star (the Stella Veneris) and the mural crown (the Corona muralis) of Italia turrita, from which the so-called Italia turrita e stellata, is also from the Roman era and dates back to the time of Augustus. From the Middle Ages to the unification of Italy The stars of the uniforms of the Italian Armed Forces, which have their origin in the Stella d'Italia After the disappearance due to the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the oblivion of the Middle Ages, the Star of Italy was rediscovered in the Renaissance. Indeed, the symbolic identification of Caesar's star in the precious tricolor star-shaped jewel, studded with green emeralds, white pearls and red rubies, which is preserved in the Castelvecchio Museum in Verona and dates back to the fourteenth century, is therefore still uncertain. medieval era: it would have been built for the condottiere Cangrande I della Scala, lord of Verona in which Dante Alighieri saw the new Caesar capable of unifying Italy. However it is also probable that the star referred to Sirius, under whose beneficial influence Cangrande would be born, with the green, white and red colors associated with the three theological virtues. In 1603, in the second edition of his treatise Iconologia, Cesare Ripa associated the symbol with the Italia turrita, and creates a modern version of Italy's allegorical personification: woman with a star on top of a towered crown, therefore supplied with the Corona muralis and the Stella Veneris. Ripa's treatise inspired many artists like Canova, Bisson, Maccari, Balla, Sironi, until the 1920s. The allegorical image of the towered and star- topped Italy became popular during the unification of Italy, spreading through a large iconography of statues, friezes and decorative objects, tourist-guide covers, postcards, prints and magazines' illustrations. During the unification of Italy, evoking Aeneas' journey toward the Italian coasts, patriot Giuseppe Mazzini mentioned again the national star's myth that afterwards was recovered by Cavour and the new Savoyard kings of Italy. The reigning house even tried to get possession of it, suggesting that it was the Stella Sabauda (\\"Savoys' star\\"), a family heraldic pattern that is not mentioned in any historical document preceding the unification of Italy. From the unification of Italy to republican Italy The Stella d'Italia that metaphorically assists the Italian soldier in the trenches in a postcard of the First World War After the unification of Italy, the presence of enormous symbolic stars on the honor stage of the official ceremonies in which King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy participated led the Italians more and more to define it, in an affective way, as the \\"star\\" that protects the Italy. On the Italian metallic coinage the Stella d'Italia is present on all copper emissions already from 1861 until 1907, as well as on all the coins of King Umberto I of Italy. The Stella d'Italia is also recalled by the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Italy used from 1870 to 1890. In 1871, thanks to the royal decree n. 571 of December 13, 1871 signed by the minister Cesare Ricotti-Magnani, the Stella d'Italia became one of the distinctive signs of the Italian Armed Forces, the so-called \\"stars\\". The Stella d'Italia is also mentioned in the patriotic music piece Tripoli bel suol d'amore, which was written in 1911 just before the start of the Italo-Turkish War, a military campaign forming part of the Italian colonial wars, to propagate the imminent war of the Kingdom of Italy against the Ottoman Empire, which was aimed at the conquest of Libya. The Stella d'Italia was one of the symbols of the journey by train on the Aquileia-Rome line towards the capital of Italy of the body of the Italian Unknown Soldier. The coffin was placed on a gun carriage and placed on a goods wagon designed for the occasion by Guido Cirilli. The ceremony had its epilogue in Rome with the solemn burial at the Altare della Patria on 4 November 1921 on the occasion of National Unity and Armed Forces Day. A bronze Stella d'Italia was placed on one of the two locomotives that pulled the railway hearse, while a second one was represented on the main building of the Roma Tiburtina railway station, which received the convoy in the final destination and which was known at the time as \\"Portonaccio station\\". The protective or providential meaning of the star was then taken up by Italian Fascism and the Italian resistance movement, which placed it on the flag of the National Liberation Committee, as well as by the republicans and the monarchists on the occasion of the institutional referendum of 2 June 1946, which took place according to World War II ended. In 1947, the Stella d'Italia was included in the centre of the official Emblem of Italy, drawn by the designer Paolo Paschetto. From an allegorical point of view, the Stella d'Italia metaphorically represents the shining destiny of Italy.

Life  He was born Ieronymos Kotsonis (ŒôŒµœÅœéŒΩœÖŒºŒøœÇ ŒöŒøœÑœÉœéŒΩŒ∑œÇ) to a poor family in the village of Ysternia, the island of Tinos. His father died three months before his birth, and his mother was soon forced to go to Athens and work as a cook to sustain her family. Thus Ieronymos grew up with relatives until the age of 2, when he went to Athens. He studied at the Rizareios Ecclesiastical School and continued his studies at the Theological Faculty of the University of Athens. After graduation, he went for further studies to Germany (in Munich, Berlin and Bonn) and Britain. Through his spiritual father, the archimandrite Seraphim Papakostas, he became a prot√©g√© of the then-Archbishop of Athens, Chrysanthus. He became a monk and, on 4 January 1939, a deacon. He rose quickly in the ecclesiastical hierarchy, being appointed second secretary of the Holy Synod, becoming presbyter and archimandrite on 23 June 1940. As a close associate of Chrysanthus, he was dismissed from his secretary to the Holy Synod by the collaborationist government during the Axis Occupation of Greece, and spent the Occupation as chaplain of the Evangelismos Hospital. After the occupation, he submitted a dissertation for a position of lecturer at the Theological Faculty, but later withdrew it after quarrelling with his teachers. On 29 September 1949 he was appointed head priest of the Royal Palace. In 1959 finally he was elected as Professor of Canon Law in the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. Ieronymos was elected as Archbishop of Athens on 14 May 1967 after the forced resignation of his predecessor, Chrysostomos II, following the military coup d'√©tat of 21 April 1967. Due to his well-known staunchly conservative and anti-communist views, he was widely seen as nominee of the junta's leadership, many of whom had ties to para-religious organizations. He continued to serve under the junta until his resignation on 15 December 1973. His, and by extension the whole Church of Greece's close cooperation with the junta during his primacy continues to be a subject of controversy. Following his resignation, he retired to his birthplace. He died on 15 November 1988.

Open to influences from Normandy, Drouais, Beauce and Perche, it is a transition zone like the Drouais. A former country of Perche under the Merovingian dynasty, it took its name from its allegiance to Theodemer, prince of the Merovingian family. Thymerais is also associated with the barony of Ch√¢teauneuf-en-Thymerais whose territory included in the thirteenth century the north-west of the Eure-et-Loir and some villages in Drouais, Eure and Orne, and overflowed the present townships of Courville-sur- Eure and La Loupe. The name Thymerais was taken in 2003 to designate the district of Thymerais municipalities made of communes belonging to the canton of Ch√¢teauneuf-en-Thymerais. Ch√¢teauneuf-en-Thymerais and Thimert-G√¢telles are the historic centers of this district. Geography Open to influences from the √éle-de-France, the Pays chartrain (Chartres region), Normandy and Perche, Thymerais consists of plateaus and valleys cleared in the Middle ages, forests and ponds. It is a transition zone bounded roughly in the north by the River Avre, which separates the department of Eure, in the south and east by the river Eure, and in the west by the Orne department. The region, mainly agricultural, is a plateau but has a hilly area covered with forests south and west. These forests, especially those of Ch√¢teauneuf-en-Thymerais and Senonches alone represent more than half the area of forest in the Eure-et- Loir. The massive Senonches belongs to the Parc naturel r√©gional du Perche. Its soil is composed of flint suitable for growing grain. The region is also known for its iron. Origin Region seems to have long been linked to the natural region of PercheMusset, Ren√©, Le Perche in Annales de G√©ographie, Ann√©e 1919, Volume 28, Num√©ro 155 p. 354 in the sense that a forest area designated Perche known before the sixth century and not to be confused with the political constituencies established on the ancient silva pertica. This error continues to be transmitted since Gilles Bry de la Clergery published his Histoire des pays et comt√© du PercheBry de la Clergerie, Gilles, Histoire des pays et comt√© du Perche, Paris, 1620 in 1620, in which he divided the Perche into four parts: * The Great Perche, or proper Perche; * The Perche- Gouet, which merged with the Little Perche; * The Thimerais, or \\"Land dismembered\\"; * The French Lands, so called because they followed the customs of France and not that of Normandy, district which, according to Bry Clergerie, included the Tour grise de Verneuil and was connected to Thimerais. The Thimerais would then have been born in the Perche as a result of its progressive deforestation for agricultural purposes.Musset, Ren√©, Le Perche in Annales de G√©ographie, Ann√©e 1919, Volume 28, Num√©ro 155, p. 356 The name Thimerais designated the area around the castle Thimert (near Ch√¢teauneuf-en- Thymerais). In the Middle Ages, it became part of the barony of Ch√¢teauneuf;. It was called \\"Land dismembered\\" because, after being joined to the Kingdom of France, it was separated from its royal domain and not, as is often believed, from the province of Perche. In the 16th century, it was parted in favor of Henri de Bourbon (the future Henry IV) and Louis Gonzaga, Duke of Nevers. This corner of earth, as the entire extent between Avre and Eure, was part of silva pertica (in Latin \\"Perche forest\\"). The villages of the region have gradually lost their suffix Perche. Ch√¢teauneuf adopted the suffix Thymerais to distinguish a city namesake and Verneuil-en-PercheLef√®vre-Pontalis, Germain, √âpisodes de l'invasion anglaise. La guerre de partisans dans la Haute- Normandie, 1424-1429, Biblioth√®que de l'√âcole des chartes, Ann√©e 1895, volume 56, num√©ro 56, p. 441 became Verneuil-sur-Avre. Only one village kept the word Perche in its name, providing evidence of the decline in Perche. It is Louvilliers (Canton Brezolles). Named Lovillare in Pertico in an ecclesiastical register (pouill√©) in around 1250 and in another in the late 15th century. This village ceased to be registered inside the Perche, and took the name Louvilliers-l√®s-Perche. History The origin of Thymerais goes back to the 7th century, when king Thierry III gave this territory to Theodemer, prince of the Merovingian family. The country was then called Theodemerensis (literally \\"Theodemer Territory\\") in his honor, then abbreviated to Themerensis and gallicized to Thymerais or Thimerais. The country was attached to the Kingdom of France in the 12th and 13th centuries. According to the vicomte de Romanet,Romanet (vicomte), G√©ographie du Perche et chronologie de ses comtes, chapitre IIIRomanet (vicomte), Chartes servant de pi√®ces justificatives √† la g√©ographie du Perche the Thymerais territory that was originally part of the counties of Chartres and Dreux, was occupied by powerful independent lords who owed allegiance only to the King of France. On the religious side, the Thymerais belonged to the diocese of Chartres, on its north-west. It was composed of 14 parishes. In 1058, Albert Ribaud, lord of Thymerais, took a stand against William the Conqueror, Duke of Normandy and king of England, who seized Thimert and then installed there a governor. The following year, Henry I, King of the Franks, retook the castle and razed it. Not very far, in a clearing in the woods, Gaston, brother of Albert Ribaud, built a fort named Chastel-neuf, which soon was surrounded by a village of the same name, and which became the capital of Thymerais. From a feudal standpoint, the Thymerais formed in 1200 one great fief with Ch√¢teauneuf-en- Thymerais at its center. This fief was divided into two parts, both dependencies of the Crown of France. On one side Ch√¢teauneuf, and on the other Senonches and Brezolles, erected later into Senonches county. In the 18th century, La Fert√©-Vidame was distracted from the barony of Ch√¢teauneuf-en- Thymerais and attached to the Crown of France, as were those of Maillebois and Bl√©vy; thus, until the late 18th century, the barony of Ch√¢teauneuf-en- Thymerais was far from having the same extent it had in the 13th century. Also, instead of being a single fief, the Thymerais was composed of four: the barony of Ch√¢teauneuf, the county of Senonches, the marquisat of Maillebois and the county of La Fert√©-Vidame. In financial and administrative terms, the Thimerais was part of Verneuil-sur-Avre, included in the G√©n√©ralit√© of Alen√ßon, and divided into four subdivisions (Thimerais addition, still included eight parishes in the province of Perche since the abolition of the election Longny-au-Perche in 1080 and a number of the Norman parishes). In military terms, the Thimerais was part of the government of the √éle de France and there was in Ch√¢teauneuf a constabulary and archers.

The prominent Rishis of the valley include Resh Mir S√†eb and Nund Rishi, also known as Sheikh Noor-ud-din Wali. The Rishi order has made an important contribution to Kashmiriyat, the ethnic, national, social and cultural consciousness of the Kashmiri people, as well as a distinctive contribution to global Islam. Shrine of Sufi Nund Rishi The 17th-century poet Baba Nasib sums up the impact of the Rishi order thus: \\"The candle of religion is lit by the Rishis, they are the pioneers of the path of belief. The heart- warming quality of humble souls emanates from the inner purity of the hearts of the Rishis. This vale of Kashmir, that you call a paradise, owes a lot of its charm to the traditions set in vogue by the Rishis.\\" Overview The original Rishi Sufis were focused on seclusion and emphasis on meditation.They were the ascetics involving in the abstinence from worldy pleasure. In his memoirs, Jahangir says that \\"they possess simplicity and are without pretence. They abuse no one. They restrain the tongue of desire and the foot of seeking. They eat no flesh, they have no wives and always plant fruit bearing trees in the fields so that men may benefit by them, themselves desiring no advantage. There are about 2,000 of these people.\\" In recent years, the history of the Rishi order has attracted interest from scholars such as Mohammad Ishaq Khan. Relationship with Hinduism Nund Rishi and Lal Ded clearly rejects the idol worshipping, caste system and the orthodox Brahmin practices this had paved the way for the Hindus to accept their more tolerant Sufi ideologies leading to their conversion to Islam. Kashmiris use the traditional Indian epithets Rishi or Baba to describe these Sufi saints. The Shaivite yogini Lal Ded was a key influence on Nund Rishi, and is said to have suckled him at her breast when he was an infant. Sufi Rishis were certainly aware of yogic practices, as evidenced by the poet Shams Faqir's praise of Lal Ded: \\"Lalla achieved the fusion of her vital air and ether, and thus realized God.\\"  References  FURTHER READING: * \\"The Rise, Growth and Decline of Indo-Persian Literature\\" by R.

In 2010-11, the exhibit toured six cities in the U.S.: Cleveland, St. Paul, St. Petersburg, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, and Fort Lauderdale, and continued to S√£o Paulo, Brazil. The exhibit includes armor, art, sculptures, relics of the saints, and papal objects. Penn Bullock wrote in the Miami New Times, \\"next year marks the 500th anniversary of Michelangelo's ascent to the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, where he painted the world's most celebrated fresco. It's also the anniversary of the Catholic Church's Swiss Guard, the Vatican museums, and St. Peter's Basilica. To commemorate the occasion of its total institutional domination of Europe's art and culture, the Vatican will display many of its relics and valuables in a traveling exhibition.\\" St Peters Basilica, Vatican City Vatican Splendors is an exhibit of armor, art from master artists, sculptures, relics of the saints, and papal belongings. As explained on its website, Vatican Splendors allows one to experience two thousand years of Vatican art and history through two hundred featured items. The exhibit is divided into ten galleries, taking viewers on a visual and auditory journey \\"through the ages of artistic expression and religious iconography.\\" These galleries consist of Early Christian Dialogue Between Faith and Art; The rise of Christian Rome; The Early Renaissance; Michelangelo; The Renaissance Basilica; Art in the Service of Faith; The Art of the Liturgy; Dialogue with the World; The successors of Peter‚ÄîPapal Portraiture; and Art and the Contemporary Papacy. The Vatican Splendors' website recognizes this exhibit as \\"one of the largest collections to ever tour North America.\\" Many of these artifacts were loaned by the Vatican Museums and have never been viewed by the public in or outside the Vatican. Viewers traverse Vatican Splendors on a self-guided tour beginning with an introductory video before entering the first gallery, which holds some historical pieces from Saint Peter's tomb. Moving onwards, viewers will encounter many historical artifacts including paintings from the masters, and the tools that they actually used during their life. In the Miami New Times, Bullock describes the display as follows. \\"[T]hree institutions that will be graced with the church's 700-year-old Giotto paintings and Gian Lorenzo Bernini baroque sculptures. The only thing better than this collection would be a tour of the Vatican vaults. Among the 200-plus priceless artifacts ‚Äì many never exhibited before ‚Äì are papal jewels; bone fragments belonging to Saint Peter and Saint Paul; personal effects of Pope John Paul II; and swords, armor, and uniforms of the papal Swiss Guard. Most stunningly, however, is the inclusion of the compass and tools Michelangelo used at the Sistine Chapel.\\"  Michelangelo  At the entrance of the fourth gallery is The Creation of Adam, a replica from the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. It is displayed in a walkway that contains a dome shaped roof immediately above the viewers' heads. Gazing upwards, people are placed momentarily back into Michelangelo's world when he initially painted it. \\"Originally commissioned to paint the Twelve Apostles against a starry sky, [Michelangelo] lobbied for a different and more complex scheme.\\" He received his wish. Upon completion, the intricate masterpiece possessed over three hundred figures and nine stories from the Book of Genesis at its center. Michelangelo, however, is not the only master on display. The Madonna of Sassoferrato is also present, and although its image is present on many holiday cards, it has never been exhibited outside of Rome. Complementing this is Guercino's 1622 Portrait of Christ with Crown of Thorns, a painting that has never been shown outside or inside the Vatican. Amidst these paintings are numerous sculptures highlighted by a life size replica Piet√†, also completed by Michelangelo at age twenty-four. The exhibit also displays Michelangelo's original architectural drawings, journal entries, and sketches.  Papal history  Further into the exhibit viewers see the personal belongings of popes, including Pope John Paul II's chalice and paten. Upon nearing this presentation, viewers can stand close enough to see his thumb print on the artifacts. Along with these are John Paul II's staff, which he was often seen on television with, and Benedict XVI's fisherman's ring, and many other richly adorned possessions and religious items used by previous popes in the past. \\"'This is just a taste of all the wealth of art and its beauty the Vatican owns,' said Monsignor Roberto Zagnoli, one of three curators of the Vatican Museums.\\" The most unusual papal artifact there is the bronze sculpture of John Paul II's hands. It is special because it is the only item people are allowed to touch. The papal display is completed with many portraits and busts of the popes as well as a chronological presentation of all the bishops of Rome beginning with Saint Peter and ending with Benedict XVI.  Rare viewing  The Vatican Splendors provides the United States with an exclusive look into the history of the Catholic Church and the inside of the Vatican. Numerous people desire to see these works of art in Rome as well as the rest of the world, as Jaweed Kaleem explains in his article. \\"Each day, 20,000 visitors line up for hours to catch these masterpieces by names synonymous with beauty -- Michelangelo, Bernini and Guercino, to name a few -- and to get a glimpse into the history of faith and aesthetics.\\" Furthermore, several of the artifacts arranged in the Vatican Splendors would not be shown in Rome. According to Peter Radestsky, \\"'Even if you go to Rome, you won't see some of these things. They're just not displayed.\\" This statement is reiterated in Kaleem's article. \\"'There are many objects that have not been on tour before,' says Mark Greenberg, president of Evergreen Exhibitions, a San Antonio company that also put together the prior Vatian exhibit in Fort Lauderdale. 'If you had a chance to go to Rome, you would not see the reliquary with the bones of Sts. Peter and Paul because it is kept in a private chapel in the College of St. Urban,' he says. 'The statues of Sts. Peter, Paul, John and Andrew are new, as is the Guercino painting.'\\"  Limited North American tour  Although the exhibit was popular it was short- lived due to the Italian law which requires, \\"that historic art pieces may not leave the state for more than 12 months at a time.\\" This knowledge may have led to the positive reception the exhibition received in the United States. Many people came to view the exhibit. In Pittsburgh it broke attendance records at the Senator John Heinz History Center, and in the Missouri History Museum it came close, attracting 100,000 visitors. The Vatican Splendors exhibit ended its North American tour in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in April 2011 and returned to Rome. Between September 2012 and March 2013 it showed in the \\"Oca\\" of Ibirapuera Park, S√£o Paulo, Brazil.

In 2011, Pen-y-Lan Hall was the subject of a Channel 4 television documentary presented by hotelier Ruth Watson as part of her Country House Rescue series. It is routinely visited by ghost hunting groups; on one visit in 2012 a recording over six hours of a visit included children's voices, music being played, and footsteps. Howard Hughes of the Spirit Quest UK group in Wrexham, described the property as being one of the most haunted places in Britain. Description Pen-y-Lan Hall is a two-storey, stuccoed and castellated Tudor-Gothic Revival-style building. The front of the house has an attic behind a parapet with symmetrical castellated chimney stacks at the ends of the building. The crenellated two-storey front porch projects from the facade and is two bays wide. The rear side of the hall is much the same as the front, albeit four bays wide with three castellated chimney stacks.

Early life Rice was born in County Kerry, Ireland, into an Old English Roman Catholic family with large estates in Munster. He was a younger son of James Rice of Dingle, County Kerry, by Phillis Fanning of Limerick. Before the death of Charles II, Rice had acquired a large practice at the Irish bar, and was known as the leading counsel in revenue matters. Judge under James II In April 1686 James II appointed him Baron of the Exchequer, by the peremptory dismissal of Sir Standish Hartstonge, 1st Baronet. Rice was made a privy councillor in May along with Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, Thomas Nugent, Sir Richard Nagle, Justin MacCarthy, and Richard Hamilton. He first sat as a judge at the beginning of June, being dispensed from taking the Oath of Supremacy, and afterwards went to the Leinster circuit. The Court of Exchequer (Ireland) was the only Irish court from which a writ of error did not lie in England; as a result, it was crowded with suitors. Rice supported the resolve of Tyrconnell and his supporters to change the Caroline settlement. He opposed the suggestion of a commission of grace, by which money might be raised and the position of existing landowners might at the same time be respected. In August 1686, Rice said 'a commission would only serve to confirm those estates which ought not to be confirmed.' He declined to say what should be done to those whose titles were doubtful and declared that nothing could be done without a parliament. In November, Rice took steps to prevent the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland), where John Keating presided, from interfering in disputes between revenue officers and merchants. In April 1687 he was made Chief Baron, displacing Henry Hene, and was knighted. After Tyrconnell succeeded Henry Hyde, 2nd Earl of Clarendon in the government (February 1687), Protestants were dismissed from civil and military employment. The charters of nearly all the corporations, about one hundred in number, were brought into the exchequer by writs of quo warranto and declared void. The next step was the forfeiture of leases made by corporations. Rice declared that in this and other matters the Protestants should have the strict letter of the law. He was one of the privy councillors who on 8 March 1686‚Äì7 signed Tyrconnell's proclamation promising that \\"His Majesty's subjects of whatever persuasion should be protected in their just rights and properties due to them by law.\\" The Corporation of Dublin was required to plead the validity of its charter at short notice, and this led to a clerical error in the pleadings. The Chief Baron refused leave to amend the irregularity, and declared the charter forfeited. Protestant mayors and sheriffs were generally expelled, and at Limerick Rice refused to hold the assizes until Tyrconnell's nominees were admitted. Rice himself became one of the forty-two burgesses under James's new charter. In August 1687, Rice was with Tyrconnell and Nagle at Chester, where he dined with the bishop Thomas Cartwright, and conferred with the king. Rice, accompanied by Chief-Justice Nugent, was sent to London early in 1688 to procure James's consent to Irish legislation. On 25 April, Clarendon noted in his diary that the two Irish judges that day began their homeward journey ‚Äòwith very little satisfaction, for I am told the king did not approve the proposals they brought him for calling a parliament.‚Äô After the Glorious Revolution After James II's flight, Tyrconnell sent Rice to France with William Stewart, 1st Viscount Mountjoy, and they left Dublin on 10 January 1689. Mountjoy's instructions were to say that any attempt on Ireland would be hopeless, but he was sent to the Bastille as soon as he reached Paris. Rice urged an immediate invasion, and returned to Ireland with James in the following March. He became a commissioner of the Jacobite treasury, and was in Limerick during the first siege of the town in 1690. After William III's repulse there in August 1690, he went again to France, and returned with Tyrconnell. They brought some money, and landed at Galway in January 1691. However, following the Battle of the Boyne in July 1690, it had become clear that the Jacobite cause was ruined. A patent which would have made Rice a baron was found in Dublin, waiting to be signed by the now-exiled James II. The Crown adjudged Rice to be within the Articles of Limerick, and he remained in Ireland in possession of his estate. He does not seem to have returned to his practice as a barrister, but on 22 February 1703 he appeared without a gown at the bar of the Irish House of Commons, and on the 28 at that of the Lords, to argue against the Act to prevent the further growth of popery, and in favour of the articles of Limerick. He was accompanied by Sir Toby Butler, James's Solicitor General for Ireland, who made a memorable speech denouncing the Popery Act as being \\"against the laws of God and man\\". Rice died on 16 February 1715, aged 78. Family Rice married Mary, the daughter of Thomas Fitzgerald of County Limerick, and had several children. His eldest son, Edward, converted from Catholicism to the Anglican Church of Ireland, in order to save his estate from passing in gavelkind. Edward's nephew, Stephen, married a daughter of the Spring family, and their eldest son, Thomas Spring Rice, became Baron Monteagle of Brandon, the title that James II had intended to confer upon Rice before his deposing.Joseph Jackson Howard, ‚ÄòSpring‚Äô, ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Visitation of Suffolk‚Äô‚Äô ( Whittaker and Co, 1866), 165‚Äì206.

Taylor is currently based on the island of Lanzarote, Spain, working on a major new underwater museum for the Atlantic Ocean.  Early life  The only son of an English father and Guyanese mother, Taylor was educated in Kent with further studies at Camberwell College of Arts Institute of London, where he graduated in 1998 with a B.A Honours degree in Sculpture and Ceramics.Voigts, Dr Jessie, ‚Ä≥Jason deCaires Taylor & Museo Subauatico de Arte(MUSA)‚Ä≥ ‚Ä≥Wandering Educators‚Ä≥, 19 June 2010 Scuba diving from the age of 18, he became a fully qualified scuba instructor in 2002.  Career  Taylor's early work includes Vicissitudes, Grace Reef, The Lost Correspondent and The Unstill Life. All are located in the world¬¥s first public underwater sculpture park in the Caribbean Sea in Molinere Bay, Grenada, West Indies, and situated in a section of coastline that was badly damaged by Hurricane Ivan in 2004.Voigts, Dr Jessie, ‚Ä≥Jason deCaires Taylor & Museo Subauatico de Arte(MUSA)‚Ä≥ ‚Ä≥Wandering Educators‚Ä≥, 19 June 2010 Taylor's works create haunting, enigmatic underwater scenes, often depicting the mundaneness of life on dry land transported into an alchemic new environment. Instead of the entropic process typically associated with the ocean's corrosive tendencies, Taylor's pieces encourage organisms to grow and affect the surfaces of his creation. They are often commentaries on humanity's relationship with the natural world and the need for conservation, decay and rebirth. The majority of his sculptures are based on living people who are life cast and whose phenotypical qualities alter over time as they slowly evolve from inert concrete to living artificial reefs.Vickers, Dave ‚ÄòWet behind the Ears‚Äô, Modern Design, Architecture and Art, p.95, London, June 2008. Taylor considers that he is \\"trying to portray how human intervention or interaction with nature can be positive and sustainable, an icon of how we can live in a symbiotic relationship with nature.\\" In 2009 Taylor relocated his practice to Mexico, where he achieved another milestone: the creation of the world‚Äôs first underwater museum. The Canc√∫n Underwater Museum (Museo Subacu√°tico de Arte, known as MUSA) holds more than 485 of Taylor‚Äôs submerged sculptures and 30 land-based pieces. It is located off the coast of Canc√∫n and the western coast of Isla Mujeres.Lauren Meir, ‚Ä≥Underwater Wonderland-The- Deep-Sea-Art‚Ä≥ ‚Ä≥Mutual Art‚Ä≥, 3 November 2010. The project was supported and commissioned in 2008 by CONANP, National Commission of Mexican Protected Natural Areas (Comisi√≥n Nacional de √Åreas Naturales Protegidas) and The Canc√∫n Nautical Association, officially opening in November 2010. Works in the museum include individual installations implanted with live coral cuttings rescued from areas of damaged reef.

It was installed in MUSA in November 2010 and consists of 450 life-size cement people standing side by side on a barren patch of sand. While the appearance of the collection underwater is of a crowd of people, from a distance it take the shape of an eye. The collection occupies over 420 square metres of ocean floor; the location was chosen to redirect visitors away from nearby natural reefs, providing these with the opportunity to regenerate. MUSA is referenced as one of the largest and most ambitious projects underwater in the world. By the end of 2013, Taylor had placed nearly 700 sculptures around the globe. Works completed in 2014 include Ocean Atlas, located in the Bahamas, the largest single underwater sculpture in the world at 5 metres tall and weighing 60 tons. In 2015 Taylor installed his first London commission, The Rising Tide. \\"I quite like the idea that the piece sits in the eye line of the place where many politicians and so many people who are involved in climate change all work and make these damaging deals and policies, yet who are in this state of mad denial,\\" he said. In 2016, Taylor was based in Lanzarote, Spain, working on a new underwater museum, Museo Atl√°ntico, which offshore. The museum consists of about 300 statues, some simply standing upright, others in situations such as a man lying on a funeral pyre or a group of refugees in a boat. The museum opened on 10 January 2017 and is open to scuba divers who are accompanied by museum guides. In 2017, Taylor started scoping for the Australian Museum of Underwater Art, Great Barrier Reef, Townsville  Conservation  Taylor has gained worldwide recognition as one of the first artists to integrate contemporary art with the conservation of marine life. These underwater artificial coral reefs installations divert tourists away from natural coral reefs that are already suffering effects from marine pollution, global warming, hurricane damage and overfishing, thus providing the opportunity for the natural reefs‚Äô rehabilitation. Working alongside marine biologists, Taylor uses resilient, stable and environmentally responsive materials. He integrates a coral promoting neutral pH cement and propagates damaged coral fragments found in the ocean into preset keys in his figures. The structures also incorporate habitat spaces for marine life that will promote an increase in biomass of local ecosystems. The sculptures are positioned in precise locations on the sea bed to avoid contact from strong currents and tidal patterns and are installed at the correct time for coral spawning to maximize their potential influence to the oceanic ecosystem. Art writer, Dr David De Russo, writes that \\"the sculptures are a living evolutionary exhibition as nature colonizes, and the sea and tidal movement deform their appearance developing a platform which will promote the re-generation of marine life. They are a means of conveying hope and environmental awareness\\"De Russo, David. \\"Natures Cultivates Creativity in an Underwater World\\", Symposium Magazine,p.44, February 2008.

The band was founded in 2006 in Kidal, Mali. They mix traditional African music with Western rock and pop influences and sing in Tamashek. The main songwriter and leader of the band is Ousmane Ag Mossa. Their music is characterized by electric guitars and vocals, youyous, bass, drums, djemb√© and other percussion instruments.  Band History  Tamikrest at Weltmusikfestival Horizonte, Koblenz, 2013 Tamikrest Tamikrest When Tamikrest was founded in 2006, the musicians were all in their early twenties. They originate from the region around Kidal, a city in northern Mali. All of them visited the Les enfants de l'Adrar school in Tinzawaten, a small oasis in the middle of the desert, which was funded by European foundations. It was there that the future members of Tamikrest got their basic musical training. Their youth was shaped by the civil war that took place between 1990 and 1995. Many family members and friends died while the Tuareg fought for their autonomy. When new riots broke out in 2006, Ousmane Ag Mossa and his friend Cheick Ag Tiglia decided not to fight with weapons, but to call attention to the Tuareg's cause with musical means. In their youth they played the traditional music of the Kel Tamasheq (as the Tuareg call themselves) and the songs of the Tuareg band Tinariwen, who already mixed African traditional music with western rock music in the eighties. Through the internet and mp3 culture, the Tamikrest members got to know bands and musicians like Jimi Hendrix, Bob Marley, Pink Floyd and Mark Knopfler who influenced the shaping of the special Tamikrest sound as well. A chance meeting with the American- Australian band Dirtmusic at the Festival au D√©sert in 2008, which took place in Essakane (about 50 miles west of Timbuktu), led to a friendship and musical cooperation. When Dirtmusic recorded their second album, BKO, in a studio in Bamako (the capital of Mali) in 2010, Tamikrest were invited to play on that album. Chris Eckman (member of Dirtmusic and The Walkabouts) also produced Adagh, Tamikrest's first album. In 2010, both bands toured Europe together and played festivals like Sziget and Orange Blossom Special, the latter organized by their label Glitterhouse Records. In October 2010, Chris Eckman produced Tamikrest's second album Toumastin, which was released in April 2011.

Premise For 26 minutes, in public, comedians have to produce a scene identical to that in a theatre, while improvising their text based on a situation evolving from the characteristics of their characters (which were determined prior to the sketch). To do this, each comedian wears an earpiece, connected live to the microphone of the show's presenter (in this case Benjamin Castaldi, in France).

He was notably adventurous, travelling through Borneo, collecting for the Industrial Museum of Scotland, in Edinburgh (today's National Museum of Scotland), and serving on scientific expeditions to China. He was president of the British Balneological and Climatological Society in 1900. Life Murray was born in Lasswade south of Edinburgh in 1824, the son of John Muray WS. He went to school at the Lyc√©e Saint Louis, Paris, France, and then returned to Scotland to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh. He became a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (LRCSE). Although he had won a commission as an army surgeon, as a prize in the military surgery class, there was no job available, so he travelled out to Canton, China, where he ran the hospital during a period of civil unrest in 1846. Murray moved to Shanghai, China, where he ran a large practice with another pioneering physician, George Rogers Hall of Rhode Island. Together, Murray and Hall opened a seamen's hospital with beds for twelve patients in Shanghai in 1852. Hall was as adventurous as Murray: Hall went on to collect the first-ever shipment of Japanese plants to be sent to New England in 1861.The First Japanese Plants for New England, Stephen A. Spongberg, Arnoldia, Vol 50, No 3, 1990, pages 2‚Äì11 Murray sent a large number of specimens that same year to the Museum of Economic Botany in Edinburgh, including Murray then moved to Hong Kong. In 1852 he paid for the first hospital for Europeans in Hong Kong. In 1854, on the outbreak of the Crimean War, he travelled directly to Sebastopol to work as a surgeon. He went on to assist in running the General Hospital at Balaclava. After travelling in Egypt, he returned to Scotland in 1856 to take his M.D. degree at Edinburgh, and became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (FRCSE). In 1857 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being Andrew Douglas Maclagan. He was a notably effective colonial surgeonPeter Laurie, Irregular Correspondence, Hong Kong, 14 January 1860 in Hong Kong from 1858 to 1872. During his time the death rate among the European population in Hong Kong fell from the alarmingly high rate of 7.52% (at which rate, half the population would die within 9 years) to 2.92% per year: the recorded reason is improved sanitation, though improved surgery and medicine may also have contributed. From 1868 he also served as inspector of hospitals. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1867. Murray returned to Britain in 1872, intending to retire. However \\"owing to pecuniary losses\\" he had to start working again, and in 1875 moved to the seaside town of Scarborough, England, where he practised for fifteen years, retiring in 1890. He was a founder member and then president of the British Balneological and Climatological Society, which advocated the health benefits of bathing.British Medical Journal, An Address on the Hill Stations of India as Health Resorts, Sir Joseph Fayrer, 9 June 1900, pages 1393‚Äì1387 He died on 24 July 1903 at Addison Mansions in London.

Like a number of vehicles of this type, it was built using an existing chassis, that of the M18 Hellcat. History The M39 was originally designed as a prime mover for the 3-inch Gun M5. Approximately 650 (640 utility/APC variants, 10 command and reconnaissance) were modified from M18 chassis between October 1944 and March 1945. They saw service in Europe during the last months of World War II and were widely used during the Korean War, where they were employed in variety of roles, including as troop transports, medevac ambulances, and ammunition carriers for 155mm M41 Gorilla self- propelled howitzers. M39s played a vital role in supplying and ferrying troops to isolated outposts during the later defensive phase of the Korean War, though their thin armor and open tops meant the crew were vulnerable to enemy fire, and the fully enclosed M75 armored personnel carrier would eventually replace it in this role. The M39 was withdrawn from U.S. service in 1957. Ambush in the Battle of Imjin River M39s were employed as ammunition carriers in the African American 999th Armored Field Artillery Battalion, which fought in the Battle of the Imjin River, where it provided artillery support for the 1st Republic of Korea Infantry Division. During the battle, Battery B was forced to evacuate its position after neighboring units withdrew. Because the M39s carriers had .50 caliber machine guns, unlike the unit's M41 self-propelled howitzers, they led the retreating column. During the retreat, it was ambushed by Chinese forces; in the battle, the unit lost 7 killed in action, 2 M39 Armored Utility Vehicles and had two M41s damaged and 31 wounded. However, the unit broke through the ambush, inflicting an estimated 100 casualties on the ambushing forces, and promptly resumed providing artillery support afterwards.  Use in the Bundeswehr  In 1956 the United States offered 100 M39s to the West German Bundeswehr. Only 32 were put into service and they were assigned to the Panzergrenadier-Lehrbataillon in Munster. After four years of service they were replaced in 1960 by the Sch√ºtzenpanzer Lang HS.30 due to a shortage of spare parts.

Early life He was the second son of Richard Nugent, 2nd Earl of Westmeath, by his wife Mary, daughter of Sir Thomas Nugent, 1st Baronet, of Moyrath, and widow of Christopher Plunkett. He was brought up to the law, and after the accession of James II he was made King's Counsel in September 1685, although his enemies said that he was \\"no lawyer\\". During the following winter he was in communication with the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, Henry Hyde, 2nd Earl of Clarendon, who treated him as a representative of the Irish Catholics. Nugent made his residence at Pallas, County Galway, an estate that his grandfather had acquired in 1621. He married in 1680 to Marianna Barnewall, daughter of Henry Barnewall (died 1688), 2nd Viscount Barnewall of Kingsland and Hon. Mary Netterville. Their children were: * Hyacinth Richard Nugent, 2nd Baron Nugent of Riverston, born after 1684, died 5 Mar 1737/38 * William Nugent, 3rd Baron Nugent of Riverston, died 11 May 1756 * Mary Nugent His title of Baron Nugent of Riverston, though disputed in law, was borne by his descendants until it merged in the earldom of Westmeath (1839). There was a full-length portrait of him in his robes by Peter Lely, in the hall at Pallas Castle, County Galway. Pallas Castle, County Galway, Nugent's family home Professional life In March 1686 he was made a judge of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland). In May he was admitted to the Privy Council of Ireland, and in October 1687 became Lord Chief Justice. His court was occupied in reversing outlawries of Catholics. One of his first acts was to present the Lord-Lieutenant with a list of new sheriffs: Clarendon regarded most of them as being clearly unfit for any public office, even those who were Protestants. An act of Henry VII, forbidding the keeping of guns without license of government, was revived and interpreted so as to deprive Protestants of their arms. Nugent said it was treason to possess weapons, though a fine of ¬£20 was the highest penalty prescribed by the act. Clarendon records some instances of judicial partiality in Nugent, but he showed humanity in Ashton's case. He was often criticized for his undignified manner on the Bench, and was inclined to squabble with colleagues, notably Sir John Lyndon, over who had precedence. Early in 1688 Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell sent Nugent to England with the Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer, Stephen Rice, to concert measures for the repeal of the Act of Settlement 1662. They returned to Ireland in April without having been able to persuade James to let Tyrconnell hold a Parliament. Nugent was holding the assizes at Cork when James landed at Kinsale in March 1689. After the Capture of Bandon he ordered the people of Bandon who had declared for William III to be indicted for high treason. Nugent was for severity, but General Justin MacCarthy overawed him into respecting the capitulation and join in persuading James to issue a general pardon to the defeated townspeople. Nugent was consulted by James at his landing, the Comte d'Avaux and John Drummond, 1st Earl of Melfort being present. In the Patriot Parliament which met on 7 May 1689 Nugent, being called by writ on the opening day to the barony of Nugent of Riverston, sat as a peer, and on the 13th introduced a bill for the repeal of the Acts of Settlement and Explanation. He took an active part in the House of Lords, and frequently presided. In July he was made a commissioner of the empty Irish treasury, and the commission was renewed in 1690, a few days before the Battle of the Boyne. Nugent was at Limerick during or soon after William's initial siege, and acted as secretary in Sir Richard Nagle's absence from September till the following January. He was accused by the Irish of holding secret communication with the Williamites, and of a plot to surrender Limerick. At the capitulation he had a pass from Ginkell to go home to Pallas. Nugent was outlawed as a rebel, but his lands remained in the family. He died in 1715.

Between 1966 and 1977, he was the longest serving director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). From 1981 to 1986, he was Commissioner of Health of the City of New York. Personal life and education Sencer was born on November 10, 1924, in Grand Rapids, Michigan. His father, who specialized in furniture, died in Sencer's early life, so his mother, Helen Furness, raised him. After receiving scholarships to Cranbrook School and Wesleyan University, he left Wesleyan before graduating to join the Navy. Subsequently, the Navy \\"sent him to medical school at the University of Mississippi. He completed his medical degree at the University of Michigan [(U-M)].\\" During his stint at U-M, tuberculosis consigned him to the hospital for a year and a half. This incident motivated him to study public health. Sencer later attained a Master's degree in public health at Harvard University. In 2009, he was awarded an honorary B.A. degree from Wesleyan. In 1951, Sencer married Jane Blood Sencer, with whom he had three children‚ÄîSusan, a pediatric oncologist; Ann, an oncology nurse practitioner; and Stephen, general counsel for Emory University. U.S. Public Health Service career Sencer points to a depiction of Triatomine sp., which transmits Chagas disease. In 1955, Sencer joined the US Public Health Service. In 1960, Sencer became the assistant director of the CDC, and in 1966, the director. In this capacity he played a major role in 1974 in establishing Emory University's public health department, which later became the Rollins School of Public Health. During Sencer's administration, the CDC grew considerably, addressing for the first time malaria, nutrition, tobacco control, as well as family planning, health education, and occupational safety and health. Additionally, Sencer prepared instructions for the quarantine of astronauts returning from the moon, which was suspected to harbor extraterrestrial pathogens. During This time Sencer also hid The Tuskegee Study from the public and refused to put a stop to it. The agency's most successful undertaking was a smallpox- prevention project in Central Africa and later in the rest of the world. This was among the CDC's first significant dealings with international public health, which the CDC presently directs. At the forefront of the effort was William H. Foege, who said: \\"I never asked [Sencer] for anything that he didn't deliver...He said you couldn‚Äôt protect U.S. citizens from smallpox without getting rid of it in the world, and that was a new approach. People in the field got all the praise, but he was the unsung hero. He just kept providing what we needed.\\" After the swine flu outbreak of 1976, in which over 200 recruits in Fort Dix, New Jersey were infected, Sencer resolved that all US citizens should be immunized. Precipitated both by his apprehensions of a recurrence of the 1918‚Äì1919 flu plague and by President Gerald Ford's incitement, the decision was later criticized as \\"rash and wasteful\\". It led the United States Public Health Service to request up to 200 million doses of vaccine. However, the anticipated pandemic did not emerge, and \\"rising percentages\\" of the 45 million vaccinated were afflicted with Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome, which provoked over 24 deaths. Sencer was both condemned and supported. Having worked with Sencer at CDC, the dean of Emory's Rollins School, James W. Curran, explained, \\"Dave Sencer made a hard choice, and he did it for the right reason ‚Äî to protect the American public... He was trying to protect Americans had there been [a swine flu epidemic], and absent one, there was bound to be criticism.\\" In 2006, Sencer wrote a report on the swine flu program: \\"When lives are at stake, it is better to err on the side of overreaction than underreaction... In 1976, the federal government wisely opted to put protection of the public first\\". That year, Legionnaires' disease, then unidentified, killed 29 attendees of a Philadelphia American Legion conference. Sencer sent 20 epidemiologists there to investigate, and months later they attributed the disease to a type of bacteria in the air- conditioning system in the hotel where the conference was held. When Jimmy Carter's presidency began, Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Joseph A. Califano Jr. dismissed Sencer as \\"part of the normal turnover of staff when administrations change\\".  Later career  After a short stint in the private sector, Sencer, in 1982, during the development of the AIDS epidemic in New York City, rejoined the public sector as the health commissioner of the city, whose mayor was Edward I. Koch. Although some appreciated his arrangement of weekly information-swapping sessions between doctors and public health officials, others, particularly those in the gay community, reprehended him for \\"dragging his feet\\". AIDS activist Larry Kramer contended, \\"He and his reign accounted for one of the most disastrous experiences of public health anywhere in the world... What did he do? He didn't do anything. He had a mayor who said, 'I don't want to know,' and Sencer fell into line.\\" James Colgrove, however, acknowledged Sencer's \\"amending the city's codes so that AIDS cases were treated confidentially, defending the right of children with AIDS to attend public schools, and being an early advocate for a city-sponsored needle-exchange program\\". Colgrove agreed with critics that Sencer was a poor public educator. He neglected to disseminate information regarding sexual risk reduction for gay and bisexual men, and initially did not publicize that \\"casual contact\\" did not spread AIDS. Sencer also supported \\"free clean needles for addicts and fought to keep gay bathhouses open, believing they were an ideal place to teach safe sex\\". Sencer (second from left) in 2008 Former CDC director Thomas Frieden called Sencer \\"a public health giant... And until the end he continued to be a thoughtful and vibrant member of the public health community. At the height of the H1N1 pandemic of 2009, he was here full time, and I said, 'Can I pay you?' He said, 'No, this is a labor of love.'\\" Death Sencer died from pneumonia on May 2, 2011, at the age of 86, in his hometown of Atlanta, Georgia. He is the namesake of the David J. Sencer CDC Museum.

History The hospital, which was designed by Alfred Williams as a workhouse infirmary and built by John T. Chappell, was completed in 1871. It included a chapel dedicated to St Elizabeth: the foundation stone was laid on 17 April 1875, by Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll. The hospital became the Kensington Infirmary in 1912 and St Mary Abbot's Hospital in 1923. The hospital was badly bombed during the Blitz in 1940; four people were killed and one of the blocks was destroyed, leaving an open bomb site within the hospital grounds. In 1944, a V-1 flying bomb scored a direct hit. The south end of the main block (established in 1847), Stone Hall, and the infirmary (which dated back to 1871) were destroyed. Five nurses, six children and seven adult patients died, while 33 additional casualties were transferred to St George's Hospital on Hyde Park Corner, with all remaining patients evacuated. The hospital gradually recovered, and repairs were still being carried out when it was incorporated into the National Health Service in 1948. The Metropolitan Ear, Nose and Throat Hospital move to the site in 1953. American musician Jimi Hendrix died at the hospital on 18 September 1970.Moskowitz 2010, p. 82 Its remaining services were moved to the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in Fulham Road in 1992.

Early life Sopoaga was born in Wellington, New Zealand. His family comes from Samoa and the Cook Islands. Sopoaga is the oldest among six siblings. His younger brother, Tupou Sopoaga, played for the Penrith Panthers in the NRL but switched codes and played alongside Lima at the Highlanders for a time. In his high school days, Lima Sopoaga attended Wellington College and won four local championships with the 1st XV. He captained the school's side in 2009 and was selected for the NZ Secondary Schools team. Club career=Provincial RugbyWellington Lions= At the age of 19, Sopoaga played for Wellington in the 2010 ITM Cup, making his debut against Manawatu.Lima Sopoaga . thehighlanders.co.nz His strong performances established himself as the squad's starting number 10. He finished the season with 88 points in 9 appearances to help Wellington to reach the final of the competition, where he scored 21 points despite losing to Canterbury. =Southland Stags= In late May 2014, Sopoaga announced that he will be joining the Southland Stags for the 2014 and 2015 seasons. The transfer from the Wellington Lions to the Stags keeps Sopoaga in Highlanders territory. Playing for Southland, Lima joins another current Highlander in Elliot Dixon. Sopoaga, excited by the move as reported by Rugby Southland; \\"The opportunity came up and it is a good fit to stay in the Highlander franchise and represent the region in the Super 15 and ITM Cup. I‚Äôm really starting to feel at home in the south now and proud to be part of the region. The Stags boys in the Highlanders have nothing but good things to say about the Stags and the Southland province and I‚Äôm looking forward to getting to Southland and giving my all for my new team.\\" Super Rugby Sopoaga followed his former Wellington coach Jamie Joseph south, signing on with the Highlanders for the 2011 Super Rugby season. Expected to back up Colin Slade, he ended up starting the opening game of the season against the Hurricanes due to Slade being injured. He responded in fine fashion by scoring a try and kicking two penalties in a 14‚Äì9 victory. However, in his second start of the season he suffered a shoulder injury which ruled him out of the team until the late stages of the season. In 2015 he helped guide the Highlanders to their first super rugby title by defeating the 1st place Hurricanes 21‚Äì14. Sopoaga scored the most points of any Super Rugby player in 2015, scoring 191 points that season. The Highlanders failed to make the finals in 2016, losing 42‚Äì30 against the Lions in the semi-final. Sopoaga was one of the few Highlanders to shine in the 2016 semi-final, scoring a try and kicking accurately, ending his 2016 Super Rugby season with 186 points. Sopoaga was pulled from the field in a 16‚Äì12 win over the Blues on 11 March 2017 after suffering a hamstring injury when he performed a try-saving tackle on All Blacks team-mate and Blues midfielder George Moala. Sopoaga made his return from injury to replace Marty Banks off the bench in a 55‚Äì6 win over the Western Force on 20 May 2017. The departing Banks scored more points in the 2017 Super Rugby season than Sopoaga due to Sopoaga spending two months out injured. Sopoaga scored 54 points in the 2017 season, failing to score any in the quarter-final against the Crusaders where the Highlanders lost 17‚Äì0. Sopoaga started for the Highlanders against the touring British and Irish Lions side on 13 June 2017, contributing eight points to the Highlanders' narrow 23‚Äì22 win over the Lions before being replaced by Banks in the 54th minute. Wasps On 15 January 2018, Sopoaga confirmed to be leaving the Highlanders and New Zealand to join top English side Wasps in the Gallagher Premiership from the 2018‚Äì19 season. Sopoaga made his Wasps debut on 8 September 2018 in a 31‚Äì42 defeat to Exeter Chiefs, he came on as a substitute in the second half and scored a conversion from a try scored by Dan Robson. He made his full starting debut the following game week, on 16 September, scoring 18 points (three conversions and four penalties) in a high scoring, 41‚Äì35 win over the Leicester Tigers. International career After an injury to Chiefs captain Aaron Cruden, Sopoaga's Super Rugby efforts in 2015 saw him gaining selection for New Zealand. Sopoaga was named in the All Blacks' 41-man squad for the 2015 Rugby Championship, making his international debut against South Africa in Johannesburg on 25 July 2015, debuting alongside lock James Broadhurst. Sopoaga started the match and was not subbed off, with replacement Beauden Barrett replacing Israel Dagg off the bench instead of Sopoaga who scored 12 points on debut, guiding the All Blacks to a 27‚Äì20 win. Sopoaga narrowly missed out on selection for the 2015 Rugby World Cup, with selectors preferring 100-plus test veteran Dan Carter and the versatility of Colin Slade and Barrett. Sopoaga was re-selected for the All Blacks in the Steinlager series against Wales in 2016. After Cruden was injured again, Sopoaga made his second test appearance in the third test against Wales on 25 June 2016 which was a 46‚Äì6 win at Sopoaga'a home crowd in Dunedin. Sopoaga replaced Ryan Crotty off the bench in the 55th minute, covering inside centre for the rest of the test. Sopoaga made four more appearances in the black jersey in 2016, scoring 10 points that year. Following the departure of Aaron Cruden to France and the inexperienced Damian McKenzie being used at fullback, Sopoaga carried a far heavier workload for the All Blacks in the 2017 season. Sopoaga replaced Beauden Barrett in the 59th minute of a 78‚Äì0 win over Samoa, converting two tries. Sopoaga also went across for what would have been his first try that match, but it was disallowed after he received a forward pass from replacement scrum-half TJ Perenara. Following the win over Samoa, Sopoaga made another 11 appearances for the All Blacks that year. Sopoaga scored his first test try on 16 September 2017 in a 57-0 demolishing of South Africa after replacing man-of- the match Nehe Milner-Skudder in the 53rd minute. Concussion to Barrett saw Sopoaga step up in the second test against South Africa in 2017, replacing Barrett only 33 minutes into the game. Sopoaga scored 7 points that day, converting tries by McKenzie and winger Rieko Ioane. Sopoaga also attempted a drop goal in the 76th minute but missed. Springbok replacement back Damian de Allende attempted to charge down the kick but was controversially red-carded for a late hit on Sopoaga. The Springboks were further punished by De Allende's mistake because of Sopoaga turning the penalty given into 3 points, the deciding factor in the All Blacks' 25‚Äì24 win that day. Barrett's continued concussion symptoms saw Sopoaga named to start for only the second time in his international career, starting against the Wallabies for 2017's third Bledisloe Cup test on 22 October 2017. An attempted pass from Sopoaga to midfielder Sonny Bill Williams went wrong in the 6th minute of the test, with Wallabies winger Reece Hodge intercepting to score a try. Sopoaga recovered well to score 8 points but was subbed off in the 60th minute for David Havili, with McKenzie moving into first-five. The Wallabies went on to win 23‚Äì18. Sopoaga made an appearance in every All Blacks fixture on the 2017 end-of- season tour, replacing Havili and McKenzie against the Barbarians and France. Sopoaga earned a mid-week start against a French XV on 14 November 2017 where Sopoaga did not miss a kick at goal. He was replaced by debutant Richie Mo'unga in the 53rd minute. Sopoaga followed up the performance against the French XV by replacing Waisake Naholo off the bench against Scotland and Wales.

Both Chandradas and Annie aren‚Äôt happy about the decision ‚Äì it‚Äôs clearly a desperate solution to their financial needs. At first Annie just wants to get over with the 9-month pregnancy period, hand over the baby and move on with life. The usually rash and immature Rajiv is now a changed man, reading up books on pregnancy, childbirth and making sure that Annie stays in an atmosphere that is cheerful, beautiful and is taken care of by nurses, provided with the best diet and so on to ensure the birth of a healthy and happy baby. He is completely taken up by the thought of having a child, the thought of finally having someone he can call his own. But by the time of the child‚Äôs birth Annie gets emotionally attached to the life that is taking shape in her womb and refuses to part with the baby. Finally Rajiv hands over the child to Annie. In the climax, Rajiv asks the maid Maggie (Sukumari), whether every mother has an attachment to her child like Annie has. Rajiv asks Maggie if she can love him as if she would her own son. Maggie is dumbfounded while Rajiv walks off emotionally distraught and in tears without waiting for an answer.

Early life Dimitri was born in Detroit, Michigan to a politically leftist Greek American family. Dimitri began writing and also using drugs at a very early age. While still a teenager, Dimitri began writing poetry and songs and formed a band with Glenn Johnson called Mr. Unique and The Leisure Suits, later Leisure Class. The band experimented with a very wide range of styles, from punk rock to rock opera to \\"Weimar oompah,\\" often inciting rage in their audience. In 1983, the band moved to New York City. Dimitri's heroin use grew along with the band. He became involved with some members of the Beat scene, notably Herbert Huncke and Gregory Corso. The Beats were a major influence on him, in terms of both his performance style and his drug use. Dimitri supported himself by working as a bike messenger and dishwasher. Ibogaine The musician Adam Nodelman was the first to tell Dimitri about ibogaine, a hallucinogen that is the central sacrament in the Central African religion Bwiti, and that can interrupt dependence on opiates without withdrawal. Dimitri also met Allan Clear, who worked to pass out clean syringes and provide other harm reduction services to drug users during the early years of the AIDS epidemic. In the 1990s, Dimitri's common law wife died of drug-related causes while pregnant. By 2002, Dimitri had a daily habit of $150‚Äì$200 worth of heroin, plus cocaine and $100 worth of methadone. In an effort to cease his drug use, he traveled to the Netherlands for ibogaine treatment (ibogaine is illegal in the United States). During his ibogaine-induced hallucinations, Dimitri says that he saw his Greek ancestors, his own future, and Papa Andre, the Gabonese shaman he would work with later. He then traveled to Icaria, his ancestral homeland on the Aegean Sea. He has not used methadone, heroin or cocaine since his treatment. Life after drugs Inspired to help others with ibogaine, Dimitri made plans to become an underground ibogaine provider, focusing on detoxing hardcore addicts. Howard Lotsof, father of the American ibogaine movement and discoverer of its anti-addiction properties, became his mentor and friend. In 2005, having already completed hundreds of ibogaine treatments, Dimitri was approached by Michel Negroponte, director of Methadonia, who wanted to document his work with addicts. In 2007, Negroponte followed Dimitri on his first journey to Gabon to film his initiation into Bwiti, and showed how Dimitri incorporated the spiritual practices of Bwiti into his detox treatments. Dimitri has advocated for the human rights of drug users on the international level, speaking at numerous international conferences. He has also continued writing, and had a joint poetry reading with John Sinclair at the Yippie Museum on Bleecker Street in 2009. \\"Parent's Night at the Leper Colony,\\" a best-of collection for the Leisure Class, was released in 2010. Dimitri is currently N'ganga-in-residence for drug users at New York Harm Reduction Educators (NYHRE), a New York needle exchange working with homeless, formerly incarcerated, and HIV-positive people in East Harlem and The Bronx. In 2011 Dimitri and two others were arrested by a DEA task force while on their way to pray at a tree. They retained the services of a famous religious rights lawyer. They are awaiting sentencing. Dimitri is one of a group of Bwitists living in the US who are in the process of making Bwiti a recognized religion. Media interest Dimitri's story and work have been featured in countless media outlets including the New York Times, Village Voice, Rolling Stone, NPR, VICE News, and The Psychedelic Times, and he was the subject of the 2009 documentary ‚ÄúDangerous with Love by Michel Negroponte. I'm Dangerous With Love, ran the festival circuit in 2009-2010 and was released on DVD in April 2011. Dimitri is featured in Season 2, Episode 9 of the Crimetown podcast by Gimlet Media.

It is located on a hill on the right bank of the River Aude, in the south-east part of the city proper. History Founded during the Gallo-Roman period, the citadel derives its reputation from its long double surrounding walls interspersed by 52 towers.Les lieux remarquables de la Cit√© , Site Officiel de la ville de Carcassonne. Retrieved 12 May 2011 The town has about 2,500 years of history and has been occupied in different ages by Romans, Visigoths, and Crusaders. At the beginning of its history it was a Gaulish settlement then in the 3rd century A.D., the Romans decided to transform it into a fortified town.Jean- Pierre Panouill√©, Carcassonne: histoire et architecture, Rennes: Ouest-France, 1999, , p. 7 The Roman defences were in place by 333 AD, when the town is described as a castellum. The original walls were supported by between 34 and 40 towers, spaced from 18 to 30 metres apart along the curtain wall. Each tower was semicircular in plan and about 14 metres tall. There were probably 40 main entrances to the town. The Gallo-Roman walls were rebuilt during the town's occupation by the Visigoths in the 5th and 6th centuries, but the original structure remained in place. Bernard Aton IV Trencavel, vicomte of Albi, N√Æmes, and B√©ziers, introduced a period of prosperity for the city with numerous construction projects. During this period, a new sect known as Catharism sprang up in Languedoc. In 1096, the vicomte of Trencavel authorized the construction of the basilica of Saint-Nazaire with the blessing of Pope Urban II. In 1107, the citizens rejected his sovereignty and called on Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona to remove him. However, with the help of Bertrand, Count of Toulouse, Bernard Aton regained control of the Cit√©. In 1120, there was a second revolt, but Bernard Aton re-established order a few years later. In 1130, he started construction of a palace for himself and restoration of the Gallo-Roman fortifications. The Cit√© of Carcassonne was surrounded by a complete fortification for the first time.. At this time, the city had a large population of three to four thousand, including the residents of the two settlements below the walls of the Cit√©: the bourg Saint-Vincent on the north, and the bourg Saint-Michel south of the Narbon gate. In 1208, Pope Innocent III called on the barons of the north to mount a crusade against the Cathars, beginning with the Albigensian Crusade. The Count of Toulouse, accused of heresy, and his principal vassal, the Vicomte of Trencavel, were the main target of this attack. On 1 August 1209, the Cit√© was besieged by the crusaders. Raimond-Roger Trencavel surrendered quickly on the 15th of August in exchange for the lives of the citizens. The town around the Cit√© was destroyed, and the citizens driven out. The vicomte died of dysentery in his own chateau on 10 November 1209. His lands were given to Simon de Montfort, the leader of the crusaders. When he died in 1218 at the siege of Toulouse, his son, Amaury de Montfort, took possession of the Cit√©, but was unable to maintain it. He ceded it to Louis VIII of France, but Raymond VII of Toulouse and the counts of Foix allied themselves against him. In 1224, Raimond II Trencavel retook the Cit√©. However, Louis VIII launched another crusade in 1226. From that time forth, the Cit√© became a royal domain. A period of terror ensued, with numerous massacres and the Inquisition. After 1226, an additional line of fortifications was added outside of the Roman walls. The town was finally annexed to the kingdom of France in 1247 A.D. It provided a strong French frontier between France and the Crown of Aragon. During this period, the inner, Roman walls were largely demolished and replaced, while the new outer walls were reinforced and extended to the south. The new towers built during this work were mainly circular, but two were square. Construction continued into the reign of King Philip IV in the early 14th century.Cowper, Marcus (2006), Cathar Castles: Fortresses of the Albigensian Crusade 1209-1300. Osprey Publishing, (pp. 20-21) In 1659, after the Treaty of the Pyrenees, the province of Roussillon became a part of France, and the town lost its military significance.Fran√ßois de Lannoy, La Cit√© de Carcassonne, Bayeux: Heimdal, 2004, , p. 11 Fortifications were abandoned and the town became one of the economic centres of France, concentrating on the woolen textile industry. In 1849 the French government decided that the city fortifications should be demolished. This decision was strongly opposed by the local people. Jean-Pierre Cros-Mayrevieille and Prosper M√©rim√©e, an eminent archaeologist and historian, led a campaign to preserve the fortress as a historical monument. The government later reversed its decision and in 1853 restoration work began. The architect Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc was charged with renovating the fortress.Joseph Poux, La Cit√© de Carcassonne, pr√©cis historique, arch√©ologique et descriptif, Toulouse: Privat, 1923, p. 50 Viollet-le-Duc's work was criticised during his lifetime as inappropriate to the climate and traditions of the region. After his death in 1879, the restoration work was continued by his pupil, Paul Boeswillwald, and later by the architect Nodet.Carcassonne, A61 world heritage fortified city ‚Äì Abelard Public Education Site.

Panorama The legend of Lady Carcas  Lady Carcas is a legendary character from the city of Carcassonne. According to the legend, she is the wife of Ballak, the Muslim prince of Carcassonne, who was killed in action against Charlemagne. The latter, following the death of her husband, allegedly took charge of the city's defence against the Frankish army and repelled it. Princess Carcas first used a trick consisting of making fake soldiers, which she had manufactured and placed in each tower of the City. The siege lasted 5 years. But by the beginning of the sixth year, food and water were becoming increasingly scarce. Lady Carcas wanted to make an inventory of all the reserves left. The city being Saracen, a part of the population being Muslim does not consume pork. The villagers brought him a pig and a bag of wheat. She then had the idea of feeding the pig with the sack of wheat and then rushing it from the highest tower of the City at the foot of the outer ramparts. Charlemagne and his men, believing that the city was still overflowing with soldiers and food to the point of wasting a wheat-fed pig, raised the siege. Seeing Charlemagne's army leaving the plain in front of the City, Lady Carcas was filled with joy at the victory of her ploy and decided to ring all the city's bells. One of Charlemagne's men then shouted: \\"Carcas is ringing! \\", in french \\"Carcas Sonne\\" thus creating the name of the city.

It is the only national level non-profit organization representing the independent motor vehicle industry. It is headquartered in Arlington, Texas. History In 1946, the National Used Car Dealers Association (NUCDA) was founded in Chicago, Illinois to lobby for the repeal of the rationing of tires and automotive parts following the end of World War II. After success in Washington in 1947, the NUCDA published a used car dealer \\"code of ethics.\\" The following year, the headquarters was moved to Detroit, Michigan. In 1950, suppliers and vendors were invited and featured at the annual NUCDA convention. The NUCDA changed its name to the National Independent Automobile Dealers Association (NIADA) in 1955. During this name change, the NIADA had roughly 2000 members, but continued to grow in size, boasting 7000 members in 1977. In 1975, the NIADA once again moved its headquarters to Raleigh, North Carolina. Lobbying efforts were again strengthened in 1979 when members of the NIADA donated $55,000 to fight against trade rule legislation. By the 2000s, the NIADA had grown to over 20,000 members. Mission The NIADA states that its mission is to advance both the independent motor vehicle dealer and the consumer by providing relevant information about the motor vehicle industry. In addition, the NIADA aids regulatory and lawmaking bodies by informing of possible consequences of proposed legislation to both the motor vehicle industry and its respective consumers. The NIADA also helps and collaborates with state level independent motor vehicle dealer associations; joining a state level independent automobile dealers association automatically includes membership in the NIADA. Educational services The NIADA provides a range of training programs designed to advance independent dealers via publications, online resources, and NIADA.tv, the official automotive dealer television network of the NIADA. Since 1999, the NIADA has released an annual used car industry report that details statistics such as dealer lot size, method of acquiring wholesale cars, and method of selling wholesale cars. The NIADA collects this information from a group of dealers known as Certified Master Dealers. The NIADA also releases its magazine, Used Car Dealer, on a monthly basis.

In 1913 land was set aside for a townsite and was gazetted in 1914. Very little development ever took place at the town. The name of the town is Aboriginal in origin and is taken for a nearby well.

He was acting chief executive of the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation from 1946 to 1948. Early life and education Tvedt was born in Lier to the teacher and organist Elias Tvedt (1874‚Äì1956) and his wife Kristine Margrethe Odberg (1875‚Äì1948). He grew up in Drammen and took examen artium there in 1925. In 1930, he graduated from university with a cand.jur. degree. Career After graduating he worked as a lawyer in Sandefjord, Drammen and Kristiansand before being employed as secretary by the Ministry of Labour for four years. In 1932, he was employed as a consultant by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK), in which corporation he remained in different positions for almost twenty-five years. His only interruption from the corporation was during the Second World War, when he maintained his own law firm in Oslo. Tvedt married Rannveig Marie Heen (1913‚Äì2008) on 11 November 1941. After the war, Tvedt became chief secretary for NRK, and in 1946 he was appointed acting chief executive (later director-general) of the same corporation. In 1948, Kaare Fostervoll became director-general of NRK, and Tvedt was appointed financial manager. Tvedt also had many other positions in boards of state enterprises in Norway, among them Norsk Tipping and Norsk Spisevognselskap. He was also a board member of Filharmonisk Selskap and Aschehoug. When Fostervoll retired in 1962, Tvedt applied for the director- general position. Hans Jacob Ustvedt applied for the same position. The board of NRK supported Tvedt, whilst the Broadcasting Council supported Ustvedt. In January 1962, the Government decided to appoint Ustvedt to director-general. The right-wing press criticised the appointment, arguing that it was done on political grounds. Tvedt then left the NRK, and tried to make success as a barrister in Oslo. He also became juridical consultant of the music copyright company TONO, and, in 1965, the company's chief executive. He stayed in the company until his retirement in 1977. Tvedt died on 30 September 1989 in Oslo, and was cremated at Vestre gravlund on 9 October. Honours In 1960, Tvedt was decorated as a Knight, First Class of the Order of St. Olav. He was also decorated as a Knight of the Danish Order of Dannebrog and the Swedish Order of Vasa. In 1973, Tvedt was upgraded from a Knight to a Commander of the Order of St. Olav. Four years later, he was decorated with the St. Hallvard's Medal. He was also appointed honorary member of the Norwegian Society of Composers and the Norwegian Union for Stage Directors.

It is part of the Public Protection Arrangements Northern Ireland (PPANI). The Board has 13 members drawn from across the community to oversee the work of the Probation Service. It employs around 430 people, around half of whom are probation officers, based in 31 offices throughout Northern Ireland. The Board requires probation officers to hold professional qualifications in social work. Other employees are community service supervisors, probation services officers, and corporate services staff. The work of the Board involves assessing convicted offenders, preparing pre-sentence reports for the courts, reports for parole commissioners and other justice-related bodies. The Board supervises over 4,000 court orders at any given time. The Board also provides a number of behavioural change programmes such as sex offending, domestic violence, drug/alcohol-related offending, anger management and violence. History of probation in Northern Ireland In 1908, the first official probation Officers started work in Belfast, following the implementation of the Probation of Offenders Act 1907. Under this Act, magistrates were able to appoint probation officers to supervise defendants through a probation order for the first time. Some of the first appointed probation officers in Belfast came from Belfast City Mission and St Vincent de Paul. The magistracy had responsibility for probation services. In 1921, when Northern Ireland came into being, the authority for justice was devolved to the new Northern Ireland Parliament and rested with the Ministry of Home Affairs. It was not until 1928 that the Ministry began issuing probation rules (the first set of standards for the Probation Service). In 1935, following developments in England, the Committee on the Protection and Welfare of the Young and the Treatment of Young Offenders (known as the Lynn Committee) was established. At this time, England and Wales used probation services much more than Northern Ireland. In 1936, appointing probation officers became the responsibility of the Ministry of Home Affairs and was funded through the Dog Licence Fund. In 1936, the cost of the probation service was ¬£312. The Lynn Committee published its report in 1938The Report of the Committee on the Protection and Welfare of the Young and the Treatment of Young Offenders' (Command 187). The report examined a number of issues that were believed to be contributory factors to offending behaviour in young people such as unemployment, inadequate housing, cinemas, dance halls and street trading. Any implementation of recommendations were stalled due to the outbreak of World War Two (1939‚Äì1945). The first senior probation officer (head of probation) was James McAdam in 1946, though during his tenure (1946‚Äì1948) his role was more of a co-ordinating and instructor type role. In 1950, the Northern Ireland Parliament passed the Probation Act (NI) which was influenced by another report endorsing the Lynn Committee Report of 1938. From then, the Ministry of Home Affairs had responsibility for the Probation Service including appointments and funding (staff were now civil servants with salaries and pensions to reflect the change). The legislation also meant that probation officers would now have to enquire into the circumstances of any accused to write a report to aid the court's determining the most suitable sentence. In addition, the Children and Young Persons (NI) Act also made it necessary for probation officers to be notified when young persons came before the courts to prepare a similar report. The Prison Act 1953 gave probation officers new responsibilities in the after care of sentenced offenders through post release supervision. The Children and Young Persons (NI) Act 1968 set the age of criminal responsibility at 10 and set out the court's powers in relation to the care and protection of young persons aged 14 and over. This continued the involvement of the Probation Service in the area of young offenders. Also during this time, the Probation Service recruited its first university graduates. By 1976, there were 45 probation officers with 7 support staff. There were also 23 trainees. This was the beginning of the Probation Service progressing towards a more professional organisation with opportunities to develop skills and experience. The period of the Troubles in Northern Ireland saw much of the after care aspect of the probation officer's role put on ice as emergency legislation introduced in 1970 brought in to deal with aspects of the unrest made a large number of new prisoners eligible for the after care. This would have put probation officers at the centre supervising a different type of released prisoner not envisaged in the original 1953 Act. As such, the Probation Service did not have to supervise politically motivated offenders. In 1979, a review group published a report after being formed by the Department of Health and Social Services and the Northern Ireland Office to look at the future of the Probation Service. The group was headed by Sir Harold Black. It recommended that the Probation Service remain as a separate service focusing on dealing with offenders and serving the courts. It also recommended that the Probation Service should be administered by a board drawn from the whole community and that a written code of practice should be drawn up for approval by the courts and the Secretary of State. In 1982, the Probation Board Order (NI) was enacted establishing the Probation Board for Northern Ireland (PBNI) as a non-departmental public body with a chair, deputy chair and between 10 and 18 other members to be appointed by the Secretary of State for a three-year term. Jim Grew was the first Chair. Staffing The current Chief Executive is Cheryl Lamont. The current Chair of the Board is Dale Ashford QFSM.

It was designed by Bartosz Zoltak, presented in 2004 at the Fast Software Encryption conference. VMPC is a modification of the RC4 cipher. (originally presented at FSE 2006 confernece) The core of the cipher is the VMPC function, a transformation of n-element permutations defined as: for x from 0 to n-1: g(x) = VMPC(f)(x) = f(f(f(x))+1) The function was designed such that inverting it, i.e. obtaining from , would be a complex problem. According to computer simulations the average number of operations required to recover from for a 16-element permutation is about 211; for 64-element permutation, about 253; and for a 256-element permutation, about 2260. In 2006 at Cambridge University, Kamil Kulesza investigated the problem of inverting VMPC and concluded \\"results indicate that VMPC is not a good candidate for a cryptographic one-way function\\". The VMPC function is used in an encryption algorithm ‚Äì the VMPC stream cipher.

They were located at the east end of the Gallowgate, Glasgow, Scotland, and occupied in the year they were built. Construction The barracks, often referred to as Glasgow Barracks, were built in 1795 at a cost of ¬£15,000, and could accommodate up to 1,000 men. Before their construction, soldiers had been billeted with the town's inhabitants. The buildings were erected on the site of the city butts, where the burghers of medieval Glasgow had practised archery and were required to gather at the time of the wapinshaws (weapon shows), to present their arms and armour for inspection. The newly opened Barrack Street was its eastern boundary. It is unclear as to whether the land had been owned by the 'Town and University' and was sold to the Government for a token payment, or if the military were only allowed the use of the land, not sold it, and that it should have been returned to the original owners after it was no longer required. Historians noted that people were suspicious of the Government's motives for establishing military barracks throughout the country. This was a time of great concern for the Government. Social unrest throughout Europe had culminated in the French Revolution of 1789 and the ensuing war with France and there had been riots in the area during the Weavers Strike of 1787. Occupation=18th century The first regiment to be stationed at the barracks were the Argyleshire Fencibles, soon followed the Sutherland FenciblesTrue Briton (1793) (London, England), Friday, 3 June 1796 and The Gordon Highlanders.Sun (London, England), Friday, 14 October 1796 In 1796/7, in response to threats of a general uprising in Scotland and the establishment of a Scottish Republic, mainly due to the Militia Act in which the government had passed a law conscripting able bodied Scots males, between nineteen and twenty-three years old, for military service, the barracks played a central role in accommodating troops. Riots were breaking out in Kirkintilloch, Freuchie, Strathaven, Galston, Dalry and throughout Aberdeen.The United Scotsmen and the Insurrection of 1797, By Peter Berresford Ellis The North Fencibles,Telegraph (London, England), Saturday, 11 March 1797 and a party of artillery with two field-pieces, marched from Glasgow Barracks for Greenock to be replaced by a detachment of thirty artillerymen, with two field-pieces, from Leith Battery. In October 1797, the 21st Regiment of FootTrue Briton (1793) (London, England), Saturday, 7 October 1797 marched from Glasgow Barracks for Dundee, and the 8th Regiment for Dumfries, Kirkcudbright and Stranraer. They were replaced by the Cheshire Militia,True Briton (1793) (London, England), Thursday, 19 October 1797 who were then dispatched to Dumbarton. In July 1798, The West Lowland FenciblesBell's Weekly Messenger (London, England), Sunday, 1 July 1798 arrived in Glasgow Barracks. Soldiers of the York and Cheshire regiments were also in the Barracks that year. A year later, nearly 300 men of the Nottinghamshire Militia,Courier and Evening Gazette (London, England), Friday, 26 July 1799 quartered in Glasgow Barracks, volunteered their services into Regiments of the Line, for European service. 19th century The return of the 100th Regiment to the United Kingdom occurred on 31 October 1868, with 51 sergeants, 34 corporals, 15 drummers, 431 privates and 26 officers. The next home for the Regiment was Scotland where they arrived in Glasgow on 12 November. They were quartered at Gallowgate Barracks with detachments at Paisley and Ayr. There they stayed until 9 September 1869 whence they departed for Manchester, England and Salford Barracks. Detachments were sent to Ashton, Bury and Burnley. In 1869, the 90th RegimentThe Douglas Archives returned from India to Gallowgate Barracks, and then in 1878, sailed for South Africa.Delavoye, p. 223 Decline By the mid-19th century, the buildings were in a dire condition. Such was the spread of disease due to soldiers sleeping with the \\"sporting ladies\\" of the town that certain wards of the Glasgow Royal Infirmary were used only to treat the military.The Glasgow Herald, 30 Aug 1999 This, and the \\"exceptional depravity\\" of the area, was given as one of the reasons for the re-location of the barracks, but the University had already moved from the area because the Gallowgate was an unhealthy place to live. In 1872 new barracks were opened on Maryhill Road. Dereliction and sale The Gallowgate Barracks fell into dereliction after new quarters were built in Maryhill. Despite hopes that the War Office would hand back the barracks to the city to be utilised as an open garden space, they were sold to a railway company in 1889 for use as a railway goods yard. The site today A rifle range consisting of a series of brick walls/foundations with sand pits dug out of the concrete floor behind the walls was located in the South Tunnel. The rifle range in the tunnel was in use throughout the seventies and eighties by a civilian rifle and pistol club and was entered through a small door in the perimeter wall in Barrack Street.

He appears to have been a stray when was found on 19 February 1942, under the ruins of a mess hut at RAAF Darwin, following the first Japanese air raid on Darwin.

Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) Radio Darwin. Retrieved 2011-04-22 After being informed that the patient's name was \\"Gunner\\" and his number was \\"0000\\", the doctor set and plastered Gunner's leg.Hill, Anthony (2005, pp. 99 - 107). Animal heroes. Published by Penguin, Camberwell, Vic. . At that point, Gunner officially entered the records of the RAAF. Leading Aircraftman Percy Westcott, one of those who had found Gunner, assumed ownership of him and became his master and handler. The young dog was badly shaken by his experiences, but quickly responded to the attention of Westcott and other personnel from 2 Squadron. About a week later, Gunner first demonstrated his remarkable hearing skills. As the RAAF personnel went about their daily routine at the airfield, Gunner became agitated and started to whine and jump. Not long afterwards, the sound of approaching aircraft engines was heard by the airmen. A few minutes later, a formation of Japanese raiders appeared above Darwin and began bombing and strafing the town. Two days later, Gunner again began whimpering and jumping, and not long afterwards came another air attack. This pattern was repeated over the weeks that followed. Long before the sirens sounded, Gunner would become agitated and head for shelter. Gunner's hearing was so acute he was able to warn RAAF personnel of approaching Japanese aircraft, up to 20 minutes before they arrived and before they were detected by the rudimentary radar systems available at the time. Gunner did not behave the same way when he heard Allied planes approaching; he could differentiate between the sounds of the engines used by Allied and Japanese aircraft. Gunner was so reliable that the commanding officer of 2 Squadron, Wing Commander Tich McFarlane, gave approval for Westcott to sound a portable air raid siren whenever Gunner's whining or jumping alerted him. Later, when a number of stray dogs were roaming the base and becoming a nuisance, McFarlane ordered that all dogs other than Gunner were to be shot.Cranston, Frank (15 August 1981). A man's very best friend in a nasty situation. The Canberra Times, page 2. Gunner became such a part of the air force that he slept under Westcott's bunk, showered with the men in the shower block, sat with the men at the outdoor movie pictures, and went up with the pilots during practice take-off and landings. When Westcott was posted to Melbourne 18 months later, Gunner stayed in Darwin, looked after by the RAAF butcher. Gunner's fate is undocumented.

It was released by Rykodisc in the US on September 22, 2008, and featured the single \\"The Father, The Son and The Harlot's Ghost\\". History Duke had recorded the album Winter Child on the student-run record label Mad Dragon at Drexel University when Rykodisc started to work with Mad Dragon and other student-run record labels across the country to distribute their albums with Ryko Distribution. It was from this union that Rykodisc became aware of Matt Duke and had asked him to sign with Ryko after the release of Winter Child. With Duke now signed to Ryko, Ryko played a demo of the song \\"I've Got Atrophy on the Brain\\" to producer Marshall Altman to see if he'd have interest in handling production for Duke's next record. Altman agreed to spend a few days with Duke in Los Angeles to see if they'd be able to work together. After the meeting in Los Angeles, both Duke and Altman agreed to work together for the next album. Duke flew back home and began writing and compiling songs to record for the new album over the next few months. With the songs written, Duke flew to Burbank, California to spend the next four weeks recording the songs at The Galt Line recording studio. Songs were recorded with the acoustic guitar while Duke and Altman worked with engineer Eric Robinson. A live band was brought in to play over the acoustic guitar tracks for the final tracks. The lead-off single for the record was \\"The Father, The Son and The Harlot's Ghost\\" but no music video was recorded. The follow-up single would have been \\"Sex & Reruns\\" but it was never followed through. Months after the release, Ryko asked Duke to record a supplemental EP of acoustic versions of songs from Kingdom Underground, which ultimately became Acoustic Kingdom Underground. Theme and lyrical content Duke as an artist uses themes and lyrics that can focus on literary references and his religious Irish Catholic upbringing. The song \\"Rabbit\\" is based on the John Updike Rabbit series of novels, \\"The Father, The Son and The Harlot's Ghost\\" is based on the novel Trinity by Leon Uris, while \\"Ash Like Snow\\" is based on Ayn Rand's We the Living. \\"Kingdom Underground,\\" the hidden title track on the album, is a song based on the Creation and Adam & Eve from Satan's perspective. The album Kingdom Underground was to be a concept album based on the John Milton poem Paradise Lost, before being abandoned to become a standard album.

Thereafter he served in the Freikorps under the command of Franz Ritter von Epp. Schultze had been involved in the Nazi Party since its founding in 1919. He was involved in the Munich Beer Hall Putsch in 1923, organising the getaway car. He was appointed head SA doctor in 1923. Later, Schultze moved into politics, serving as a deputy of the Bavarian parliament between 1926 and 1931. In November 1933, Schultze became Director of the Bavarian Ministry of Justice and head of the Public Health Department of the Ministry of the Interior. Two years later, Schultze began the role for which he was best known, as Reich Leader of University Teachers. During his tenure, Schultze played a key part in implementing Nazi racial policies, asserting that the success of German universities depended on having \\"the type of the combat- ready political, National Socialist fighters who regard their 'Volk' as the supreme good\\". Schultze was Reichsdozentenf√ºhrer until 1943. Schultze was also involved in the T-4 Euthanasia Program. At least 380 cases of aiding and abetting the killing of disabled people were traced to him. In 1960, he was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. Schultze died on 16 August 1979 in Krailling, near Munich. ReferencesBibliography *Zenter, Christian and Bed√ºrftig, Friedemann (1991).

The episode originally aired on May 2, 2011 on Syfy in the United States. The episode was directed by longtime director and producer of the Stargate franchise Andy Mikita. It was written by Linda McGibney. In this episode, the drones set up blockades at various stars at which the Destiny wishes to recharge. Unable to engage in another battle with the drones, Eli (David Blue) comes up with the idea to recharge in a blue supergiant. However, because of the intense heat that a blue supergiant puts out, it is extremely dangerous and requires both Eli and Dr. Rush (Robert Carlyle) to stay behind to pilot the ship. The rest of the crew are forced to gate to a planet where their descendants once lived and scavenge for supplies as they await the fate of the Destiny. Plot In a standard power-braking maneuver, Destiny skirts a gas giant before a routine power recharge, but when they emerge from the shadow of the planet the crew discovers that their approach to the star is blocked by a Command ship, which immediately launches drones to attack Destiny. Fortunately, the power-brake maneuver leaves them far enough away from the ship to initiate a jump to FTL, with only minimal damage to Destiny, but having drained its critical power supplies. Col. Young suggests another star, but having Destiny drop far enough away to assess the region first. Young's caution pays off as another Command ship awaits them at the star, and Destiny jumps back into FTL to escape. The crew suspects that Command ships will await them at every red dwarf star that Destiny normally uses for energy, creating a blockade. Eli proposes using a blue supergiant to recharge instead; Destiny would be able tolerate the higher temperatures though the interior of the ship would become impossible to live in. Instead, leaving a few personnel aboard in the space suits that can withstand the temperatures, the rest of the crew would use the Stargate to safety stay on a nearby planet until the fueling process is complete. Young reports to Col. Telford on Earth on the plan; Telford insists on bringing expert pilots aboard via the communication stones to handle the maneuver, but Dr. Rush assures that he and Eli are the most experienced pilots for Destiny. The crew begins to gather as many perishable goods as possible prior to evacuation, particular as many plants from the hydroponics dome and putting them into refrigerated storage. Dr. Park convinces Young to let her stay aboard, using the third suit, to continue to collect and save as many of the plants as possible before Destiny enters the star. Destiny drops out of FTL sooner than anticipated, and the crew race to evacuate the ship as it draws closer to the star, finding themselves in an apparently-abandoned Earth-like city. Eli and Dr. Rush initiate the approach to the star. Just as Dr. Park is ready to leave the dome, the doors seal shut, and cannot be overridden; Dr. Rush suspects that Destiny knows the dome will not survive the extreme temperatures and already shut off the section, despite his attempts to abort their path towards the star. Knowing that he needs Eli's attention on the flight controls, Dr. Rush advises Dr. Park to submerge and secure herself in the water collection pool to survive the heat for as long as possible. As the ship skims the star and collects energy, the dome ruptures, igniting the plants and pulling the remains into the void of space. Dr. Park barely hangs on through the maneuver. Eventually, once the ship is cleared, Eli is able to override the door seals and frees Dr. Park. Though she is safe, she has suffered from flash blindness. On the planet, Young organizes teams to search the remains for any supplies. They come to learn that the planet was attacked by drones in the past, with most of the population fleeing through the Stargate. The recon teams encounter one of the drones and are able to subdue it. However, a civilian, realizing there are still drones around, panics and tries to open the Stargate, alerting the drones to their presence. The recon teams race back to protect the crew just as a command ship lands on the surface. Young orders the Stargate opened back to the ship ten minutes early. Though the ship is still cooling down, the crew is safely recovered with the meager supplies, and TJ races to provide medical support to Dr. Park. While the ship has been recharged, the crew recognize that blue supergiants are even more rare than red dwarfs, and they will not likely be able to use the same ruse again against the Command ships. Reception \\"Blockade\\" was viewed by 0.993 million live viewers, resulting in a 0.7 Household rating, a 0.3 among adults 18‚Äì49. Meredith Woerner from io9 was mainly positive about the episode praising the dynamic between Eli and Rush. She says \\"Eli and Rush battle it out on the deck over what to do... It's a hard moment for Eli, but for the first time he had to make the hard decision for the greater good. It will be interesting to see how this changes his character (even if it's for only one more episode).\\" However she was much more critical of the rest of the episode, referring to the off-world situation calling it \\"very stereotypical Stargate\\" and was extremely disapproving of Morrison claiming it to be a \\"faceless jerk who freaks out and ruins things for everyone.\\" Mike Moody from TVSquad praised the episode saying that \\"Impressive episodes like \\"Blockade\\" are making this cancellation business really hard to swallow.\\" He echoed similar sentiments shared by Woerner stating that \\"One of the most joyous things about \\"Blockade\\" was watching Eli step up and take charge of what was arguably Destiny most dangerous mission ever. I also loved seeing Rush slyly push Eli to stand up and believe in himself.\\" Moody also gave insight into Rush's personality saying he has \\"come a long way from the uncaring lone wolf we met in the series pilot. Rush is the guy who can bury his emotions and make the hard decisions -- like potentially sacrificing someone to save the ship and the lives of its crew.\\" John M. Guilfoil from Blast Magazine was also positive about the episode but was reminded that \\"after the action-packed Blockade episode, that left one crew member blind in another emotional performance, there's only one left before Universe goes away for good.\\" Guilfoil praised the whole episodic arc saying that the \\"episodes \\"Common Descent\\" and \\"Epilogue\\" stack up with anything else on SyFy and did the \\"time travel\\" angle better than SG-1 and Atlantis ever did... In some weird loop of time, a copy of the Destiny arrived later and found \\"their people\\". The resulting interaction was the best piece of television the Stargate franchise has put out in years.\\"  References  External links  * \\"Blockade\\" at Stargate wikia Category:Stargate Universe episodes Category:2011 American television episodes Category:Drones in fiction ","title":"Blockade (Stargate Universe)"},{"id":"31674154","text":"Gavin Andrew Collins (born 31 December 1966)Who's Who 2012 ‚Äì COLLINS, Gavin Andrew is the Archdeacon of The Meon.‚ÄùPompey Chimes‚Äù (Diocese of Portsmouth newspaper) May 2011Portsmouth Cathedral ‚Äì September 2011 Brief biography Collins was educated at Trinity Hall, Cambridge and blu blu blu blu blu blu ordained in 1998.

The founder of Stolt-Nielsen Limited, he is widely credited as the creator of the parcel tanker concept. He also pioneered and built successful businesses in tank containers, offshore oilfield services and aquaculture. He served as a director on the board of Stolt-Nielsen Limited, where his son, Niels Gregers Stolt-Nielsen, is chief executive officer. Biography After a few years as shipping trainee, Jacob, worked as a shipbroker in New York. There, he was briefly associated with Charles Steuber Sr., at whose house he was married in 1957, and the two conceived of the idea for a new pump and pipeline system for tank ships which would permit a tanker to safely segregate multiple grades of dangerous chemicals, after first converting the m/t Freddy. The brief business association between the two was short-lived because of divergent priorities. Based on the new design, Jacob jnr. started his own company, Parcel Tankers Inc, Liberia, in 1959. His ships were called parcel tankers and the trade became known as the Parcel Trade. The company grew very fast and is still today the largest owner and operator of parcel tankers in the world, now operating a fleet of about 150 ships ranging in size from 450 to 45,000 dwt. The business is to run parcel tankers in regular, scheduled liner service, transporting as many as 20/25 parcels of different liquid chemicals on each ship. The company operates such services all over the world. In 1972, Stolt-Nielsen started Sea Farm A/S in Norway for the production of salmon smolt. The company was subsequently renamed Stolt Sea Farm Ltd. (SSF) and grew to become the third largest salmon producer in the world. The salmon business was sold in 2006, with SSF retaining the turbot, caviar and sturgeon businesses. SSF has since also added sole to the menu. Jacob expanded into another new business in 1974, when he created Stolt- Nielsen Seaway A/S to provide sub-sea construction services for offshore petroleum exploration and production in the North Sea. After the acquisition of Comex Services S.A., the company was renamed Stolt Comex Seaway S.A. In 1999 and 2000 the company acquired Ceanic Inc. and the French sub-sea contractor E.T.P.M., and was renamed Stolt Offshore S.A. The company was sold in 2006, renamed Acergy, and is now part of Subsea 7. Stolt-Nielsen had also set his sight on the terminal business as a natural complement to the tanker business. He acquired his first storage terminal in the 1970s. Today, Stolthaven Terminals operates four owned and five joint-venture terminals, providing storage for chemicals and other speciality products in key markets worldwide with a total capacity of 4 million m3 when present construction completed. In 1982, another industry caught Jacob‚Äôs attention. Stolt Tank Containers was established after the purchase of United Tank Containers. Starting out with only 400 tank containers, STC is today the world‚Äôs largest provider of door-to-door transportation services for bulk-liquid chemicals and food-grade products, with the total count of containers approaching 30,000. In 2000, after 41 years as head of the company, Jacob retired as chief executive officer and handed over the reins as CEO to his son, Niels Gregers, who continues as CEO of Stolt-Nielsen Limited today. Jacob Stolt-Nielsen is known for his long history of friendship with Filipino seafarers. His relationship with Capt. Gregorio Oca led to the creation of the Philippines‚Äô biggest union of seafarers and the extensive training of Filipino seafarers in chemical tankers owned by Stolt-Nielsen. Classrooms and medical/hospital facilities were donated by Stolt-Nielsen for Filipino seafarers and their families. In January 2003, Solt-Nielsen S.A. voluntarily entered The United States Department of Justice amnesty program, amid claims of anticompetitive activity and industry collusion. After penalties were handed down to two competitors, the DOJ then rescinded Stolt-Nielsen‚Äôs amnesty and notified Niels G. Stolt- Nielsen and Jacob Stolt-Nielsen that they were targets of his action. A trial in 2005 ruled unanimously in favour of Stolt-Nielsen and its executives. In December 2007, the DOJ announced that it would not appeal the decision. ‚ÄúThus ended the worst episode in the history of Stolt-Nielsen,‚Äù wrote Jacob in the company‚Äôs 2007 annual report. ‚ÄúThe struggle took a great toll. The cost in money ‚Äì more than $150 million ‚Äì was bad. The cost in grey hair and stress was worse‚Ä¶ We proved the hard way that justice can be had in the U.S. if you have deep pockets and the nerve to fight. I am glad it is over.‚Äù On 15 December 2009, the 50th anniversary of the founding of the company, Jacob Stolt-Nielsen stepped down as chairman of the board. He remains a director of the company. Writing in the company‚Äôs 2009 annual report, he said: ‚ÄúThis is my last Chairman‚Äôs Statement for the annual report. After 50 years in the chair it is time to leave the tiller to someone else‚Ä¶ As I now take my place among the other directors, I do so with utmost confidence in Christer Olsson (Chairman), Niels Stolt-Nielsen, our Chief Executive Officer, and the outstanding management and personnel of Stolt-Nielsen S.A. worldwide.‚Äù In 2011, Stolt- Nielsen suggested that captured pirates should be executed and their boats sunk, the historical response to piracy, as an effective solution to the problem of piracy off the Horn of Africa. He was criticised by Norway's Foreign Ministry's state secretary, who said that \\"human rights\\" apply even to pirates.http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9LE1OE03.htm Family Jacob Stolt-Nielsen and his wife of more than 50 years, Nadia, have four children: Siri, Lise, Jacob B. and Niels. Jacob B. Stolt-Nielsen currently serves as a director of Stolt-Nielsen Limited, having previously held a number of management positions in the company.

He also represented the Highlanders in the Super Rugby competition. Playing career=Provincial Rugby Saunders' first-class rugby career started with a bang as he debuted for North Otago aged only 17 in a Ranfurly Shield contest against Waikato in 2000. After three seasons with North Otago, he transferred to the Otago Rugby Union in 2002. He made his provincial debut for Otago in 2003 and quickly established himself as a player of substantial promise. After injury ruled him out of the 2004 provincial season, he returned in fine form in 2005 in a year that was highlighted by his selection for a match against the touring British and Irish Lions. However, another injury forced him to miss most of the 2006 Air New Zealand Cup, and a disappointing 2007 season saw him released from both Otago and the Highlanders. With his career at a crossroads, Saunders signed with Southland for the 2008 Air New Zealand Cup and began to work on rebuilding his career. With Southland, he proved to be a reliable performer on the wing, and helped the province to a historic Ranfurly Shield triumph in 2009. His strong performances in the 2010 ITM Cup saw him brought back into the Highlanders squad for the 2011 Super Rugby season. Super Rugby Saunders' performances for Otago saw him selected to the Highlanders squad for the 2004 Super 12 season, and given the chance to start 3 games late in the season responded with a series of outstanding performances. He carried that momentum into the 2005 Super 12 season, where he started 9 of the team's 11 games and was one of their most reliable backfield performers. However, his career would lose substantial momentum with a shoulder injury suffered during the 2006 preseason that forced him to miss the entire Super 14 campaign and most of the following provincial season. On his return for the 2007 Super 14 season, he appeared in every match for the Highlanders but struggled for form and was not as effective as before his injury. Left off the Highlanders squad for the 2008 Super 14 season, Saunders was eventually called back into the squad as injury cover and made a further 5 appearances. However, these would be his last Super Rugby appearances for a further three years. After three seasons of consistent (and consistently healthy) play for Southland, Saunders was again included in the Highlanders squad for the 2011 Super Rugby season, although his season was interrupted by the death of his father while the team was in South Africa. He made his season debut against the Blues on 29 April. After receiving limited game action for most of the season, he finished the year on a high note with two tries against the Blues on 17 June.

A church order explains precisely what a document is, in a clinical and matter of fact tone, without conveying the spiritual nature of the document. The authority of a Church Order The authority of a church order is very closely linked to its relationship to Scriptures and the confessional texts of a church. The fact that a church order provision is supported directly or indirectly by the Scriptures will to some degree, though not essentially, affect its authority. Evolution of Church Order The British biblical scholar, B. H. Streeter identifies the Johannine epistles as the culmination of the New Testament understanding of church order with the author of Third Epistle of John confronting a serious matter as an official with recognized authority and experience who calls himself an 'Elder' yet functions more like an Archbishop of later development.Streeter, B.H.

After the resignation of Jim Prentice, Rempel was encouraged to run for his old seat of Calgary Centre-North by members of the Calgary business community and the Conservative party, but only decided to do so after talking with Rona Ambrose. Rempel was acclaimed as the Conservative Party of Canada candidate in Calgary Centre-North on December 17, 2010, in anticipation of a by-election to replace Prentice.

Rempel sponsored Petition E-1310 that garnered nearly 25,000 signatures. Rempel tabled a bill amending Canada's bestiality laws in December 2017, which stalled at first reading.

The subject Joseph Jenckes became a freeman in Providence in 1681, and ten years later began an extensive career of civil service to the colony. For 12 years from 1691 to 1708 he was a Deputy from Providence, and for four of those years he was the Speaker of the House of Deputies. From 1707 to 1712 he was assigned as Major for the towns of Providence and Warwick, and was also the Assistant from Providence during those years. In 1715 he was elected as the deputy governor of the colony, and held this position every year but one until 1727 when he was elected as governor, which position he held for five consecutive one-year terms. One of the major issues concerning Rhode Island during Jenckes' terms of leadership was the boundary-line controversy with the neighboring Colony of Connecticut, and between his two terms as Deputy Governor Jenckes was in England with Richard Partridge to obtain royal intervention in this dispute. Connecticut refused to observe the boundary between the two colonies that had been established by commissioners from both colonies who met at Stonington, Connecticut in 1703. The Rhode Island colony was also having boundary line issues with Massachusetts, and Jenckes and his partner were able to get satisfaction from the crown, so that the Rhode Island colony \\"may not hereafter be molested, as they have hitherto been to their very great prejudice.\\" Several years later, in 1726, Jenckes was one of four commissioners from Rhode Island who met with Connecticut commissioners to settle the line of partition between the two colonies. The following year he wrote a letter on behalf of the General Assembly to King George II thanking him for his protection of Rhode Island's \\"charter privileges\\". Jenckes' first wife was Martha, the daughter of John and Mary (Holmes) Brown, with whom he had nine children and at least 68 grandchildren. Following her death, Jenckes married in 1727 Alice Dexter, the widow of John Dexter who was the son of Gregory Dexter, an early President of Providence and Warwick. Alice was the daughter of John and Sarah (Whipple) Smith. Jenckes died in 1740, \\"deemed to die intestate by reason of his insanity of mind,\\" and his son Nathaniel was appointed as administrator. Austin wrote that he is buried in the North Burial Ground in Providence, but this is incorrect. The family cemetery in Pawtucket where he was buried is now defunct, with no trace of its existence remaining.

He was elected to the House of Commons of Canada for the federal Conservative Party of Canada in the 2011 election, representing the electoral districts of Lethbridge and Medicine Hat‚ÄîCardston‚ÄîWarner until his death. Early life and education Hillyer was born on 8 July 1974 in Lethbridge, Alberta, and was a native of nearby Stirling. Hillyer earned a master's degree in political economy from George Wythe University (a non-accredited university) in Cedar City, Utah, and took PhD courses in constitutional law. Hillyer and his wife Livi had four children and resided in Raymond, Alberta. Prior to his marriage, Hillyer was a missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Quebec. Political career Hillyer won a nomination to run in a Saskatchewan provincial election under the Saskatchewan Party banner in a Regina electoral district. He decided to drop out after he was diagnosed with leukemia. He made a political comeback running for a seat to the House of Commons of Canada in the 2011 Canadian federal election. He contested the electoral district of Lethbridge as a Conservative candidate and held for his party with a large majority. His decision to not attend any candidate forums after his first was a controversial topic in the riding. Hillyer's absence prompted a local Lethbridge newspaper to dub Hillyer \\"The Man Who Wasn't There\\". He was also accused of inflating his credentials in campaign literature by emphasizing his graduate education but not mentioning that the institution where he studied‚ÄîGeorge Wythe University‚Äîis non-accredited. In December 2011, Hillyer stated in the House of Commons that he intended no offence when he made gunshot gestures with his hands as he voted to scrap the Canadian Firearms Registry. In promising not to make hand gestures in the Commons in the future, Hillyer suggested that \\"if people were offended they should blame whoever posted the six-week-old video [on YouTube] on the anniversary\\" of the √âcole Polytechnique massacre. In March 2012, Hillyer was caught on camera \\"rolling his eyes dramatically\\" in the House of Commons during a speech by NDP MP Pat Martin. 2015 election Between the 2011 and 2015 federal elections, the electoral boundaries in southern Alberta were changed. Raymond, where Hillyer lived, was moved from the Lethbridge riding to Medicine Hat, which was expanded and renamed Medicine Hat‚ÄîCardston‚ÄîWarner for the 2015 election. In 2014, upon learning that Medicine Hat MP LaVar Payne would not be running for reelection, Hillyer decided to seek the Conservative nomination for Medicine Hat‚ÄîCardston‚ÄîWarner rather than seek re-nomination for Lethbridge. In July 2014, Payne announced that he would not be endorsing Hillyer for the 2015 federal election, citing Hillyer's poor service of his constituents: \\"I have no problem saying that I won‚Äôt be endorsing Jim [Hillyer] just because of the fact that I know he hasn't served his own riding, and I don‚Äôt want that to happen here .... I know that he has not serviced his riding very well. I've had people from Lethbridge, Cardston area and Warner area talk to me about the whole thing, so I certainly won‚Äôt be endorsing Jim.\\" However, Hillyer still won by a nearly 4-to-1 margin over his nearest opponent.  Health and death  Hillyer had survived leukemia after receiving a bone marrow transplant in 2003. In February 2016, Hillyer underwent surgery for a serious leg bone infection, the latest in a series of complications resulting from breaking his leg while skiing three years previously. Hillyer returned to Ottawa after recovering from surgery to vote on the 2016 Canadian federal budget. After complaining of feeling unwell the previous day, Hillyer, aged 41, was found dead in his Ottawa office on 23 March 2016. An autopsy confirmed the cause of death to be cardiomyopathy which may have been caused by either a pre-existing heart condition or caused by chemotherapy he underwent a decade before.

Test cricket was not filmed except for highlights and the notion of Test umpires using slow-motion replays or other modern techniques would have been considered absurd. Instead the umpires had to make judgements based on what they saw in a split-second, and honest mistakes were accepted as part and parcel of the game. However, touring teams sometimes felt that there was a natural bias towards the home team which led to some acrimony if important decisions always went against them. The Australian Ray Robinson wrote in The Cricketer: > Usually debatable decisions work out fairly evenly over a Test rubber, but > weight of evidence suggests that the umpires were mistaken in giving Bradman > not out caught for 28 in the First Test, Edrich out leg-before-wicket for 89 > in the Third Test, and Washbrook out caught behind the wicket for 39 in the > Fourth Test.

Only two umpires were used in the five Tests as there had been no opportunity for new umpires to come to the fore. They were George Borwick, who had been an umpire in the infamous Bodyline series of 1932-33 and John Scott, famous in Australia for cracking down on the same hostile fast bowling he used to serve up as a young man in the Sheffield Shield.pp44-45, Cary They had been umpires in the \\"Goodwill Tour\\" of 1936-37 when there had been no problems and had the confidence of both teams. After the First Test the England captain Wally Hammond and his manager Major Rupert Howard tactfully suggested that other umpires might be added to the panel, but this proposal was rejected by the Australian Board of Control which included the Australian captain Don Bradman. It may simply have been the case that the ABC had no other umpire that it could use. Hammond had been asked by the MCC to promote sportsmanship and avoid disruption even at the cost of the series and therefore had limited options. He could have taken his concerns to the MCC so that they could make representations with greater authority or gone to the press to raise a public outcry and so force the ABC's hand, but he did neither. Even so, the English press corps in Australia (and some Australian journalists like Clif Cary) queried the competence of the umpires (their honesty was never questioned). As Australia won the first two Tests this was seen as 'squealing' by the Australia newspapers who were supported by journalists back in London who said that umpiring decisions must never be questioned. The furore was enough for Umpire Scott to resign after the Fifth Test, he told his critics that they had \\"pilloried and lampooned him for doing his duty fearlessly...I gave no decision I regret, nor did I feel afterwards that I would have liked to have withdrawn any decision I made\\".p38, Cary Umpire Borwick made a statement that he thought Ray Lindwall did not bowl bumpers in the series - contradicting Lindwall, who said he was ordered to bowl them by Bradman - and retired after the Indian tour of Australia in 1947-48.pp37-38 and p51 Cary Catches and Stumpings > Bradman had only made 28, when he played Bill Voce into the slips.

The most contentious decision of the series was when Don Bradman was not given out when he was on 28 in the First Test. Bradman was returning to bat after the war and a serious illness had struggled for an hour even on a good batting strip. Australia were 72/2 when Bill Voce bowled a ball that \\"flew from the blade of the bat to Ikin\\".p23, Miller Clif Cary was watching Bradman with Zeiss glasses while commentating on the radio and reported \\"The next ball from Voce rises as it goes away and Bradman is out...Bradman out, caught Ikin at second slip, bowled by Voce, for 28\\".p29, Cary Ikin made the mistake of not appealing immediately as it was assumed that a batsman will walk when he is so obviously out, but \\"Bradman stood there as if he had never hit the ball\\" \\"The fieldsmen stared as Bradman stood his ground, then appealed for a catch. In believing that he had jammed the ball on to the ground before it rose, Don was in a minority of the nearest witnesses on the field but that minority included the umpire\\".p292, Robinson and Coward As one player said afterwards \\"cricket is coming to a pretty pass if a side has to appeal for everything; when that happens it will mean the end of all those things for which cricket is supposed to stand\\". Cary wrote \\"there was not doubt of the legality of the catch\\", Jack Fingleton called it \\"one of the most unfortunate decisions in the history of the Tests.\\"p77, Jack Fingleton, Brown and Company, The Tour in Australia, Collins, 1951 and most English pressmen shared their view. However, E.W. Swanton reported \\"The Don waited for the decision, confident that it was a bump ball, and the umpire Borwick, ruled 'not out'\\".p60, Swanton In the Australian dressing rooms the players were divided as to whether he was out or not.p39, Lindwall When Bradman returned at the end of the session he said he had played down on a yorker and to Ray Lindwall there was no doubt as to his sincerity.p39 Lindwall In the end the batsman was given the benefit of the doubt, but it had repercussions. Bradman recovered his form and hit 159 runs in 160 minutes before he was out for 187, which set up Australia's victory in the First Test by an innings and 332 runs. This was a morale-booster for a young team with eight debutants, but if Bradman had been out the Australian total would have been less, England would have batted on a flat wicket and the thunderstorm that wrecked the wicket would have caught Australia in their second innings.p30, Cary 'As he walked past Bradman at the end of the over Hammond glared at Bradman and said tensely, \\"That's a fine way to start a Test series\\"'. The England captain was furious that Bradman had not walked in what was supposed to be a post-war goodwill tour and refused to talk to him for the rest of the series except to call the toss.p48, Willis and Murphy To the press he was more diplomatic \\"I thought it was a catch but the umpire may have been right and I may have been wrong\\" Bradman, 38 years old and suffering from fibrositis, had been advised not to play by his doctor and a cheap dismissal might have made him retire, especially if he had been caught on a sticky wicket in the second innings.p22 Jack Fingleton, Brightly Fades the Don, Pavilion Library, 1949 Keith Miller later wrote \\"that decision was subsequently admitted in nearly every quarter to have been erroneous\\".Keith Miller, Cricket From the Grandstand, Oldbourne, 1959 A similar incident occurred in the Second Test, though it might not have been seen as a problem if it had not followed the events of the first. Bradman was on 22 when he appeared to snick another catch to Ikin at short leg, but \\"this time there may have been some cause for doubt; it was an appeal that could have gone either way\\".p31, Cary Bradman was given not out and made 234, so in his first two innings he made 421 runs, but if he had he been given out he would have made only 50. In the Fourth Test at Adelaide Cyril Washbrook was given out to Ray Lindwall to a ball that Don Tallon scooped off the ground. Washbrook \\"stood there transfixed. Even some of the Australian leg-side fielders expressed amazement\\".p36, Cary Tallon was known for his impetuous appealing - \\"he was often roaring before he had studied facts and it was his over-eagerness that brought about the shocking decision\\"p215, Cary \\\\- and Bradman asked him if he still wanted to appeal. Tallon said he did and Bradman stood by the decision. It was later suggested that Tallon told Bradman that it was not a clean catch and Clif Cary thought if Bradman had gone into the matter further he would have recalled Washbrook as had happened in other such cases. The Australian reporter Ray Robinson wrote \\"I believe nearby fieldsmen were impetuous in appealing as the wicket-keeper scooped up the ball, and that the hesitant umpire would have been wiser to have asked his square-leg colleague whether it carried to the gloves or was gathered on the half- volley\\". Hammond tried to locate a press photograph of the ball touching the ground to show the ABC, who demanded proof of the incompetence of the umpires before they were willing to change them, but no photo was found.p37, p110 and p215, Cary The only complaint from the Australian side about the umpiring was that Ray Lindwall thought Denis Compton should have been stumped in both innings of the Fourth Test before he reached either of his centuries. In the first innings the glare from the sun (it was 105¬∞F/40¬∞C) was so bright that the white paint of the crease could not be seen clearly, and the same may have applied in the second innings, but little fuss was made of this.p43, Lindwall Bad Light > We could have played on, but it was a Test match and we just had to win. I > realised something drastic had to be done or three wickets might be lost. So > I appealed after every second ball. I complained of the people moving about, > the light, and, in fact, anything, in an effort to get the appeal > upheld.p32, Cary :Sid Barnes Sid Barnes repeatedly appealed for bad light in the Second Test at Sydney and having succeeded went on to make his highest Test score of 234. After tea on the second day of the Second Test at Sydney Australia were 24/1 after Arthur Morris was bowled by Bill Edrich on a wet wicket suited to the England bowling attack. \\"On a stormy Saturday Barnes and Johnson angered the crowd by making made 8 appeals against the light in 11 minutes...This stalling saved Australia losing more than Morris's wicket and the granting of the last appeal enabled Bradman to rest a strained leg for Monday\\". The umpires gave in to the constant appealing and the batsmen were allowed to retire an hour before stumps.pp32-33, CaryWisden - ENGLAND v AUSTRALIA 1946-47 Clif Cary opined in his radio commentary that the light was bright enough to play by and the umpires had been pressured into a decision by the Australian batsmen, as did the English pressmen. They were labelled \\"biased, unsportsmanlike squealers\\" and that Barnes and his captain Bradman would never used such underhand tactics. When the batsmen returned next day Barnes survived the early bad wicket and went on the make 234, his highest Test score, adding 405 with Bradman in what still is the highest Test partnership in Australia.The Home of CricketArchive Bradman had received permission from Hammond to use a substitute fielder earlier in the day because of a pulled leg muscle and as a result did not have to come out to bat on a wet wicket. He was able to rest on the Sunday and when play resumed on the Monday he lowered himself down the batting order and came out in the afternoon, when \\"He limped as if in extreme pain, and several times lay on the ground as if ill\\",p19, Cary On the Tuesday he gave \\"an amazing exhibition in amassing 234 runs - that is, amazing for one who was supposed to be a cripple. He played all the shots, pulled leg muscle and all, and often ran between the wickets with the speed of an Olympic sprinter\\". After the series ended Barnes gave a radio interview and freely admitted that he had \\"kept on appealing until the umpires answered me\\" simply because he thought the wicket was bad.p32 and 35, Cary In the Third Test Barnes appealed for light at the end of the second day, which was rejected, but he saw out the day with Morris. In the final half hour of the Test Norman Yardley and Godfrey Evans batted on when Australia wanted three wickets for their third victory of the series \\"even though the light was atrocious and rain was falling heavily\\".p85, Cary Hammond had been dismissed earlier, but refused to let his team appeal against the light, either to make a point about the Barnes appeal or simply due to sportsmanship. Bill O'Reilly said \\"I could not understand why the English batsman seemed loath to appeal against the weather, even when the rain was coming down solidly. There are no praises for gallant gestures in Tests matches\\". In the Fifth Test the new England captain Norman Yardley appealed against the light in a low scoring match where every run was vital. He had his appeal turned down and he and Jack Ikin lost their wickets in light so bad that the Australian cameramen were unable to take clear photographs.p35, Cary They were carrying light meters (not available to umpires for nearly 40 years) and stated that the light was much worse than when Barnes and Johnson were allowed off the field.

Wright, I believe was very keen to secure such a verdict over > Bradman, who only once has been dismissed l.b.w. during his Anglo-Australian > Test career, and that was in his maiden game when Tate found him in front. > This is a Bradman record of which no mention is made on the statistical > pages, but it reveals not only he marvellous eye, but also his splendid > footwork...p63, Cary :Clif Cary Leg before wicket decisions are notoriously difficult to judge and only the umpire is in the correct position to judge the line of the ball and its height when its hits the batsmen. The lbw laws of the time meant that a batsman could not be lbw to a ball that pitched outside the off-stump unless he was also outside the off-stump. Though this was meant to encourage off-side strokeplay and prevent batsmen from padding away balls it resulted in batsmen padding-up to off-side balls while in front of the wicket and encouraged inswing bowlers such as Alec Bedser who normally hit the batsmen in front of the leg-stump. In the Third Test at Melbourne Bill Edrich was given out lbw to Ray Lindwall by Umpire Scott after he hit the ball onto his pads with his bat. The bowler wrote \\"Bill genuinely thought he hit the ball onto his pad...I saw no deviation of the ball after it pitched and I heard no click\\".p42, Lindwall A few minutes later he gave Denis Compton out lbw to Ernie Toshack when padding up of a ball that landed outside the stumps, causing the Middlesex player to stare at him in disbelief before his walked off. Lindwall wrote that Compton \\"made no stroke at a ball he thought had pitched outside his leg-stump, but which umpire and bowler declared pitched on the line of the leg stump\\", which would make Compton out. Wally Hammond came on and, annoyed at the two dismissals, gave a simple caught-and-bowled to Bruce Dooland. Cyril Washbrook was out soon after and England collapsed from 155/1 to 179/5. Scott was angry with the English pressmen who accused him of making the wrong decisions, saying Edrich had not hit the ball with his bat and Washbrook had thought Compton was out (though Washbrook was several yards to the right of the umpire and so unable to judge the line of the ball). Conversely the England leg- spinner Doug Wright was considered to be the unluckiest bowler in the world;p59, Caryp63, Swanton \\"He continually rapped the pads with his straight one, and when the decision went against him, his face clouded with puzzled dismay.\\" In the Third Test he caught Bradman with a straight ball that he to hit to leg, but missed and the ball hit him on the top of his pads plumb in front of the stumps. Wright and Evans appealed, but Bradman was given not out. However, a cameraman took a series of photographs of the delivery and \\"the camera appears to give a different verdict\\".p1, Cary No Balls > Lindwall's drag of his right foot has often brought him under the fire of > those who claimed that he was over the line before he released the ball...As > a matter of fact Ray's right foot is well behind the crease when he starts > to bring his arm over, but he releases the ball later in his swing than any > other bowler I have seen.p140, Moyes :Johnnie Moyes An umpire checks Lindwall's feet for a no-ball. In modern cricket the bowler is no-balled if he bowls without some part of the front foot (either grounded or raised) behind the popping crease when it lands (it is still a legal ball if it slides over the line) and if his back foot is not wholly inside the return crease. In the 1940s the front foot rule had not been written, so the requirement was that one foot be behind the bowling crease and fast bowlers tended to drag the toe of their rear foot over the bowling crease to decrease the distance between them and the batsmen when they released the ball. If they timed it well the delivery was made when the toe was still behind the crease, but they could drag it over the line and they would be no-balled. This proved to be a particular problem in the 1950s. As you can see on this old cine film of Ray Lindwall dragging his foot over the bowling crease. See Film on Youtube. It should have been called as a no-ball as his rear foot was past the crease when he delivered the ball, easy to see in a slow motion replay, but difficult for the umpire. Lindwall's action was a text book model, but he was known for his heavy drag.p112, Swanton, 1977 Alan Kippax said that he watched Lindwall for 45 minutes in the Fourth Test at Adelaide without once seeing him bowl a legal delivery and sometimes his foot dragged 18 inches over the crease.p37, Cary However, the fast bowler was only called for no-balling twice in the series, which Clif Cary thought was a disservice to Lindwall as the English umpires would call him in 1948 if he did not correct his action in time (this proved not to be a problem). Lindwall himself wrote that if the no- ball law was enforced strictly almost every bowler would be no-balled and ‚Äúthe spirit of the law demanded that the bowler should land behind the bowling crease and as long as I did that I was playing the game‚Äù.p48, Lindwall The New South Wales Cricket Association asked him to bowl a yard back from his present delivery, but Bill O'Reilly advised him not to change until no-balled by an umpire and as a result Lindwall kept his action unchanged.p47-48, Lindwall This was the opposite of what happened to the English leg-spinner Doug Wright, a notorious no-baller with a \\"long, springy run and windmill action\\" that saw him overstep the line too many times.p152, Moyes Bill O'Reilly wrote \\"He waves his arms widely, and rocks on his legs like a small ship pitching and tossing in a fairly heavy sea. Whenever he bowls in Australia there are people who whistle and cat-call as he goes through his strange approach to the stumps.\\"p28, Bill O'Reilly, Cricket Task-Force, The Story of the 1950-1951 Australian Tour, Werner Laurie, 1951 Jack Fingleton called the no-ball \\"Wright's curse...He's probably bowled more of these than any other spinner in history\\",p67, Jack Fingleton, Brown and Company, The Tour of Australia, Collins, 1951 It was easier for the umpires to call Wright for no-balling as be bowled at a slow-medium pace and Lindwall‚Äôs fast bowling was more difficult to judge, but they should have called them equally if their feet were over the line.pp37-38 and pp117-118, Cary Incidentally, Wright had a habit of licking his hand before bowling each ball which the umpires forbade in the 1950-51 Ashes series and upset his rhythm, but was allowed by Scott and Bowick in 1946-47.p143, Miller Hostile Bowling > I must say when I bowled at Len I felt a sense of personal grudge I have > never known against any other batsman.

After the Bodyline series of 1932-33 hostile fast bowling was discouraged in Australia. In 1936-37 Umpires Scott and Borwick even gave the two teams a lecture on short pitched bowling. In the Goodwill Tour Gubby Allen, Bill Voce and Ernie McCormick bowled to a good length and the batsmen enjoyed making runs.pp43-44, Cary After Len Hutton's 364 at the Oval in 1938 the Australian team reckoned fast bowling should return to normal as they thought Hutton had a weakness against fast bowling. Jack Fingleton reckoned he would have received a warm reception on the next tour of Australia. When Test cricket resumed with the 1946-47 Ashes series Australia found that they had two quality fast bowlers in Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller and since England only had the medium pace of Alec Bedser and an aging Bill Voce they could bowl as many bouncers as they liked without fear of retaliation. Their particular target was Hutton, who was given an \\"opening blitz\\" at the start of the innings, but Hammond and Edrich also suffered.p48, Cary In the First Test Keith Miller dug the ball in short and \\"nearly every ball from Lindwall rose head high\\".Wisden - ENGLAND v AUSTRALIA 1946-47 ‚ÄúEdrich batted for 105 minutes. He suffered more than 40 body blows with a nonchalant contempt for danger and seemed content to be battered black and blue rather than lose his wicket. It was grim concentration and unflinching courage of the type rarely seen in Australia, and he was undaunted even after a terrific sickener under the ribs from Miller\\".p92, Cary Lindwall wrote that Hammond and Edrich \\"were hit on the body repeatedly\\".p38, Lindwall Miller used a limited leg-trap some of the time, but he quickly slowed his pace as on the rain-affected pitch the ball leapt so much that it could hit the batsman, but not get them out. One English pressman wrote that this was Bodyline, to the anger of Vic Richardson, Alan Kippax and Clarrie Grimmett who had seen the real thing. Clif Cary wrote that \\"the placements were sufficient to cause the batsmen worry, although they did not justify one journalist describing the attack as \\"bodyline\\" to lend colour and expression to his cable\\".p49, Cary The England bowler Bill Voce and the reporter Bill Bowes did not comment on the matter, but Harold Larwood said that Bodyline was less dangerous as the batsman knew what to expect - bouncers on the leg-stump - but here they could get anything. After the Ashes had been retained Fingleton wrote that it would be sporting if the Fast bowlers stopped bouncing Hutton, whose left arm had been badly broken in the war - it had required 46 stitches to repair his arm, which was left two inches (5 cm) shorter and another injury could end his career.p47, Cary It was also thought unsportsmanlike to bowl them at Paul Gibb who wore glasses. It was noted that though Bradman did not tell Lindwall and Miller to stop bowling bouncers in general as a good captain he did not allow them to bowl short at Cyril Washbrook. As well as being a resolute batsman Washbrook had a weakness for cutting the ball outside the off-stump, so that is where Bradman directed his bowlers and he received fewer short balls as a result. Denis Compton and Norman Yardley had weaknesses against the spinners, so Bradman would bring on Ian Johnson and Colin McCool to bowl to them. \\"So it was that bumpers were not wanted. They were generally kept for those who had a real hatred for them, while a few additional slammers were indiscriminately thrown in for good measure against all and sundry\\".p50, Cary Further reading * Playfair Cricket Annual 1947 * Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 1948 * * Ashley Brown, The Pictorial History of Cricket, Bison Books, 1988 * Bill Frindall, The Wisden Book of Test Cricket 1877-1978, Wisden, 1979 * David Frith, Pageant of Cricket, The MacMillan Company of Australia, 1987 * David Frith, England Versus Australia: An Illustrated History of Every Test Match Since 1877, Viking, 2007 * Ray Robinson, On Top Down Under, Cassell, 1975 * Bob Willis and Patrick Murphy, Starting with Grace, Stanley Paul, 1986 ReferencesSources * Clif Cary, Cricket Controversy, Test matches in Australia 1946-47, T.

Castles, a Tasmanian, spent two seasons with Port Melbourne after arriving on the mainland. In both those years, 1940 and 1941, Port Melbourne were Victorian Football Association (VFA) premiers but Castles was only a member of the 1940 grand final winning team. Although he still turned out in the VFA, Castles was enlisted in the Australian Army in 1941, as a sapper. He was discharged at the end of the year and transferred to VFL club South Melbourne. Mostly used at half forward and as a rover, Castles was a consistent source of goals for South Melbourne, finishing runner up in their goal-kicking on four occasions.AFL Tables: Vic Castles His best effort in a season came in 1945 when he kicked 38 goals and was particularly strong in the finals series. He kicked four goals in South Melbourne's 11 point semi final win over Collingwood, which qualified them for the 1945 VFL Grand Final. In the premiership decider, where no less than six of Castles teammates were reported, he lined up on a half forward flank and kicked a club high three goals, in a losing side. After appearing in all 17 games in 1946, Castles applied for a clearance to Burnie, but South Melbourne refused. Another season at South Melbourne meant he was able to bring up his 100th league game, in the final round of the year. He was granted a clearance at the end of the season and returned to Tasmania, taking up the position of playing coach for Burnie in the North West Football Union.Hobart Mercury,\\"Vic Castles To Coach Burnie\\", 13 February 1948, p. 9 He was in charge of Burnie from 1948 to 1950 and his on field performances were rewarded with selection in the Tasmanian team which competed at the 1950 Brisbane Carnival.Hobart Mercury,\\"Southern Men Dominate Representation In Carnival Team\\", 13 June 1950, p. 24 In 1951 he switched to Wynyard, the club he had played for prior to joining Port Melbourne. His first season at Wynyard was spent as their coach and then in 1952, when he was a member of their premiership team, he contributed just as a player. Back in Victoria, Castles was appointed coach of Wimmera Football League club Murtoa in 1953. He left them after just one year and joined Jung for the 1954 Horsham & District Football League season.The Argus,\\"Castles chosen to coach Jung\\", 2 April 1954, p. 9 ReferencesExternal links * Category:1918 births Category:1993 deaths Category:Australian rules footballers from Tasmania Category:Sydney Swans players Category:Port Melbourne Football Club players Category:Wynyard Football Club players Category:Burnie Football Club players Category:Murtoa Football Club players Category:Australian military personnel of World War II Category:Tasmanian Football Hall of Fame inductees ","title":"Vic Castles"},{"id":"31674707","text":"Issidae is a family of planthoppers described by Spinola in 1839, belonging to the order Hemiptera, suborder Auchenorrhyncha superfamily Fulgoroidea.

Description Issid nymph Issidae are small insects generally with a stocky body, as the wings mainly develop in width. Basic body coloration is not striking, usually shows brownish colors. The head has two ocelli. The forewings have strong pronounced ribs. They wrap the abdomen when the insect is at rest. The family originally included approximately 1000 species with 215 genera, but the systematics of Issidae remains uncertain, with many of the subfamilies having been recently removed to separate families, including Caliscelidae. Nogodinidae, and Tropiduchidae.

Its exhibits include Jean-Baptiste Wicar's The French Republic (the first known representation of the French Republic) and William James Grant's La cocarde (The Cockade), representing Josephine de Beauharnais with her daughter Hortense. The museum was opened on 13 July 1984 in the presence of Louis Mermaz, president of the National Assembly of France.thearttribune.com, Acquisitions by the Mus√©e de la R√©volution Fran√ßaise in Vizille : the 19th century.

The museum also organizes international symposiums about the French Revolution. Castle history Claude Perier, owner of the castle in 1788. Located 15 km south of Grenoble on the Route Napol√©on, the Ch√¢teau de Vizille (Castle Lesdigui√®res) is the former home of the Dukes of Lesdigui√®res. The founder of the dynasty, Fran√ßois de Bonne de Lesdigui√®res, completed his castle in 1619. King Louis XIII, who made him Constable of France, visited it on 3 December 1622. In 1716, the building was transferred to the Dukes of Villeroy. The Perier family owned it from 5 June 1780 to 23 December 1895.gallica.bnf.fr, Inventory of the archives of the Ch√¢teau de Vizille and the Perier family, p. 20. (French) The castle was the summer residence of the presidents of the French Republic from 1924 to 1972. France ceded the castle and its domain to the General Council of Is√®re, which was entrusted with giving it a prestigious cultural role, in 1973. On 21 July 1788, during the presidency of the count of Morges,pagella.bm-grenoble.fr The count of Morges, President of Assembly of Vizille. the Assembly of Vizille met in the castle's jeu de paume room after the 7 June Day of the Tiles in Grenoble. Pope Pius VI spent a night in the castle at the invitation of owner Claude Perier on 5 July 1799, and Napoleon stopped there during his return from the island of Elba on 7 March 1815. Used as a factory, the castle experienced a fire in the night of 9‚Äì10 November 1825 which spread to part of the city. In 1828, Adolphe Perier (son of owner Augustin Perier and grandson of Claude) married Nathalie de La Fayette (daughter of Georges Washington de La Fayette and granddaughter of the Marquis de La Fayette) in the castle. Absent from the ceremony, the Marquis de La Fayette was a guest on 19 August 1829 during a visit with Nathalie.Itin√©raire du g√©n√©ral LaFayette, De Grenoble √† Lyon : Pr√©c√©d√© d'une notice historique, 1829 (General Lafayette's itinerary). (French) Adolphe Perier, after the death of his father in December 1833, continued restoring the castle. In 1862, after Adolphe's bankruptcy, the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts classified the castle as a monument historique and Henry Fontenilliat (step-father of Auguste Casimir-Perier) became the new owner. Two years later, Henri Fontenilliat died; his daughter, Camille (Auguste's wife), inherited the castle. Henri Ding, La Libert√©, also called Marianne (1888). The lessons of the 1825 fire were not learned; on 17 February 1865, a second fire destroyed an L-shaped wing containing the jeu de paume room and a battle gallery built in 1615 by Lesdigui√®res. They were never rebuilt. Activity in the castle's printing factory halted. Auguste Casimir- Perier and his wife, Camille, received Philippe d'Orl√©ans (count of Paris) in 1872 and Adolphe Thiers in 1874. For the centenary of the Assembly of Vizille on 21 July 1888, President Sadi Carnot dedicated a statue of Liberty (also called Marianne) in front of the castle. Sculpted by Henri Ding, its pedestal is engraved with sentences from the assembly and the names of representatives of the province of Dauphin√©. Two months after France purchased the castle, La D√©p√™che dauphinoise mentioned the possibility of a museum. The newspaper mentioned it again on 6 March 1932, specifying a museum of the French Revolution. With the opening that summer of the nearby Napoleon Road, a room was devoted to the history of the castle. After the 1981 election of Fran√ßois Mitterrand, the 2 March 1982 decentralization law permitted a museum dedicated to the French Revolution far from Paris. At its 10 June 1983 meeting, the general council of Is√®re created a museum of the French Revolution in the castle of Vizille. Two people contributed to the museum's founding: Departmental Archives of Is√®re director Vital Chomel and historian Robert Chagny, curator of its first temporary exhibition. Others who participated in the collection of the first works were Jacqueline Mongellaz (1984‚Äì1990) and Alain Chevalier (since 1988). The first rooms of the museum were set up at the beginning of 1984, and its first director (from 1984 to 1996) was art historian Philippe Bordes.Philippe Bordes and Alain Chevalier, ¬´ Catalogue des peintures, sculptures et dessins ¬ª, in Annales historiques de la R√©volution fran√ßaise, 311, 1998. pp. 179-180.

In November 1987, work began on the Hall of Columns (later called the Republic Room) two large staircases ascending from the current entrance, and elevator access to all levels of the museum. Two new halls were dedicated on 21 July 1988, but financing difficulties delayed the completion of 600 square metres (6,458 square feet) of the Hall of Columns. When it opened in March 1992, the museum contained twenty rooms on five levels. Since 2010, the site of the former jeu de paume hall (removed in 1865) is indicated by a hedge to the right of the museum entrance. Collections The museum's themes, in addition to the revolution, are contemporary movements such as Lumi√®res and Romanticism. It features works of art and historical objects from, before and after the revolutionary era. Chateau de Vizille, home of the museum. The museum is an historical museum based on works of art. These works, more than historical illustrations, are keys to a better understanding of the upheavals and historical context. The paintings and sculptures of the revolutionary era span a variety of styles and genres. The paintings are allegories, historical events, portraits, ancient (or tragic) scenes, and landscapes. Of the statues, several busts are faithful representations of Antoine Barnave, Bailly, Mirabeau, Louis XVII, Robespierre, Danton and his wife Antoinette, and General Lafayette.The Art Tribune, 2012, Recent Acquisitions at the Mus√©e de la R√©volution fran√ßaise in Vizille. Statues in a variety of materials include Madame Roland, Saint-Just, and Jean- Jacques Rousseau. Decorative arts illustrate everyday life: furniture, porcelain, and French, English and Dutch faience. Unique objects are stones from the Bastille, swords from the National Guard, and musical instruments.

The Albert Soboul Library and Documentation Centre provides researchers and students with an important resource of often-rare documentation of the art and history of the French Revolution. Created in June 1982 (shortly before the museum opened), it has occupied two levels of the museum's north wing since 2001. In addition to busts and paintings of revolutionary-era figures, it contains documentation of various aspects of the French Revolution, including its artistic and cultural impacts. The 27,000-title collection, including in history, in art history and works published between 1750 and 1810, is largely made up of legacies and donations from libraries of French Revolution historians.Leaflet of the Documentation Center Albert-Soboul (2013). Acquisitions continue to be made worldwide, and a reserve of prints dating to before 1805 is kept at a constant temperature and protected from light. The library was named in June 2005 for historian Albert Soboul, the foremost French authority on the revolutionary era (who bequeathed his collection of books on the revolution to the museum before his death in 1982). The library was expanded with the libraries of historians Jacques Godechot, Jean-Ren√© Suratteau and Roger Barny, which were donated by their families.

Building  Built between 1652 and 1681 for Etienne Lantin, councillor in the Accounts Chamber, the townhouse became the property of the Magnin family in the 19th century when Jean-Hugues Magnin (1791-1856) bought it in 1829. Without altering its historic flavor, the townhouse was redesigned in the 1930s by the Parisian architect Auguste Perret, to house the collection that Maurice Magnin, a year after the death of his sister Jeanne, willed to the State in 1938. This choice followed donations to the Mus√©e Jacquemart-Andr√© in 1912 and the Mus√©e Bonnat in 1922. In accordance with the donor's wishes, the museum has retained its characters as an amateur's cabinet and private dwelling, and can neither lend nor expand the collection.

The likelihood component of the equation also increases in terms of there being more value on the coast so a higher chance of hazardous situation occurring. Fundamentally humans create hazards with their presence. In a coastal example, erosion is a process that happens naturally on the Canterbury Bight as a part of the coastal geomorphology of the area and strong long shore currents. This process becomes a hazard when humans interact with that coastal environment by developing it and creating value in that area. In Burton 1978 ‚ÄòThe Environment as Hazard‚Äô a natural hazard is defined as the release of energy or materials that threaten humans or what they value. In a coastal context these hazards vary temporally and spatially from a rare, sudden, massive release of energy and materials such as a major storm event or tsunami, to the continual chronic release of energy and materials such long- term coastal erosion or sea-level rise. It is this type coastal hazard, specifically around erosion and attributes surrounding erosion that this article will focus on.  Coastal population growth and development on coasts  Globally, the number of people living on the coast is increasing. It has been stated that there has been over a 35% increase in the population of people living on the coasts since 1995. The average density of people in coastal regions is 3 times higher than the global average density. Historically, city development, especially large cities, was based on coasts due to the economic benefits of the ports. In 1950, there were only 2 megacities (cities with greater than 8 million people) in the coastal zone, London and New York City. By the mid-nineties, there were 13. Although coastal areas have globally shown population growth and increases in density, very few in-depth quantitative global studies of population have been carried out, especially in terms of distribution across specific environs, like coasts. The spatial distribution and accuracy of global data must be significantly improved before realistic quantitative assessments of the global impacts of coastal hazards can be made, as currently much of the data is collected and analysed in the aftermath of disasters. On the heavily developed East Coast of USA, a strong correlation exists between human development, determined by satellite imagery, and reduced rates of erosion, even when studied at regional scales. A combination of the relative permanence of urban infrastructure and coastal defense efforts made to protect such infrastructure is likely the cause of such a relationship. Even after destructive storm events, evidence suggest that US East and Gulf Coast communities tend to rebuild homes and structures that are larger than before the event. Historical studies have put estimates of the number of deaths due to cyclones over the last 200 years around the Bay of Bengal exceeding 1.3 million. However, in developed countries, as can be expected, the death toll is significantly lower but the economic losses due to coastal hazards are increasing. The US for example had major losses through Hurricane Andrew, which hit Florida and Louisiana in 1992. This rushing to the coast is exhibited in property value. A study by Bourassa et al. (2004) found that in Auckland, New Zealand, wide sea views contributed on average an additional 59% to the value of a waterfront property. This effect diminished rapidly the further the property was from the coast. In another study, it was found that moving 150 m away from the Gulf of Mexico lowered property values by 36%. Insurance premiums in coastal hazard areas are an inconsequential determinant of property values, given the significant amenity values provided by the coast in terms of views and local recreation. Sea-level rise, coastal erosion, and the exacerbating interaction between these two natural phenomena are likely to pose a significant threat for the loss of capital assets in coastal areas in the future. It is hard to say if the vulnerability to coastal hazards by those residing there is perceived, yet dominated by the amenity value of coasts, or simply ignored.  Coastal erosion hazards  Coastal erosion is one of the most significant hazards associated with the coast. Not in terms of a rare massive release of energy or material resulting in loss of life, as is associated with tsunami and cyclones, but in terms of a continual chronic release that forms a threat to infrastructure, capital assets and property.  Beach erosion process  Storm induced large erosion events are a part of the natural evolutionary process of fine sediment, gently sloping beaches. Increased wave energy in storms leads to the removal of foreshore, berm and dune sediments. These displaced sediments are then deposited as near shore sand bars and act to dampen the wave energy lessoning the amount of sediment that is being eroded from the coast. When wave energies decrease post storm events, the sediments from these newly deposited near shore bars are returned to the upper beach, rebuilding the berm. This self-correcting cycle is an active balance between wave energies and fine sediment deposition. This store of sediment being available for erosion in storms and re-depositing when the event has subsided is an important natural buffer mechanism against protecting the mainland from erosion and minimising coastal retreat.  Dune destruction  Sand dunes are very dynamic fragile structures that act as stores of sediment used to carry out the coastal processes mentioned above. This removal of the upper beach sediments is important from a hazard perspective as this is the area of the coast that is often utilised for property development due to the high prices sea front properties with a view can achieve. In Pegasus Bay, New Zealand, storm events in 1978 and 2001 caused significant erosion of the New Brighton and Waimairi sand beaches. In the 1978 storm event houses on the seaward side of the New Brighton Spit suffered from undercutting as the dune sediment in which they were built on was eroded by high wave energy. This same storm event caused similar erosion damage to houses built on the upper dunes in Raumati Beach, on the west coast of the North Island, New Zealand. Bulldozing and bulk removal of sand from protective coastal dunes is therefore an extremely hazardous activity, and one that has been widely carried out in New Zealand in order to form a surface on which to build on to obtain sea views.  Canterbury bight  In Kirk (2001) coastal erosion on the Canterbury bight, South Canterbury was said to have reached up to 8 m per year. This coastal process could be measured in more ways than one, the afore mentioned distance of coastal retreat or the decreased dollar value of developed assets, land and infrastructure that are at risk. To date, erosion on the Canterbury Bight has led to the loss of agricultural land, threatened valuable infrastructure including holiday settlements, and reduced coastal lagoons and wetlands. Historically, erosion on the Canterbury Bight was a natural process, but has now been exacerbated by human intervention. The Waitaki River was the dominant source of sediments for the beaches between Oamaru and Timaru. Since the damming of the Waitaki River in 1935 erosion of the coastal cliffs has become the primary source of sediment in the north flowing current moving up the coast of South Canterbury.  Erosion mitigation = Engineered structures  This destruction of sand dunes is often then mitigated with construction of seawalls, revetments and groynes in often futile attempts to prevent storm erosion hazards to unsuitably located assets and infrastructure on coasts. These engineered methods are commonly ineffective and frequently actually magnify the hazard or just move the hazard down coast. In Porthcawl, South Wales, a seawall constructed to stop erosion in 1887 was replaced in 1906, 1934 and finally in 1984 when the beach was paved as each prior structure was undermined by further erosion. The loss of aesthetics due to the lack of a sand beach resulted in tourists utilising alternative beaches. Therefore, incurring an even greater economic loss on top of the cost of the engineering.  Restorative dune planting  The alternative to hard engineering measures is sand dune conservation. This involves protecting the sand dunes and allowing the natural buffering processes to occur. Dune protection and conservation can be facilitated in a number of ways, actively with dune planting and sand fencing, or with better planning by developing away from or well behind the dune structures not on them. On the New Brighton Spit the spread of marram grass (Ammophila arenaria) has resulted in effective dune stabilisation in areas. However this invasive exotic species has mostly replaced indigenous species like pingao (Desmoschoenus spiralis) meaning that although the stability of the coastal area has gained, the historic, native cultural values of the area have suffered.  Beach nourishment  A further soft-engineering method for protecting the shoreline is beach nourishment. The presence of beach nourishment has been correlated with increases in number of homes and home size along the coast of Florida, US, which ultimately leads to an increase in exposure to coastal hazards. Due to the cost of beach nourishment, this is a solution that has been used primarily for the benefit of the tourism industry. For example, erosion Miami Beach had almost no stored sediment left by the mid 1970s, consequently, visitor numbers declined and development of the area decreased. A beach nourishment program was set up resulting in an influx of development and infrastructure in the late 1970s. Miami Beach was rejuvenated to such an extent that annual revenue from foreign tourists alone is $2.4 billion, compared to the $52 million cost of the 20-year nourishment project. Tax revenue from tourists who visit Miami Beach alone more than covers the cost of beach nourishment projects across the nation. Using the capitalised annual cost of the project, for every $1 that has been invested annually on the nourishment, Miami Beach has received almost $500 annually in foreign exchange.

Of uncertain attribution, it has been assigned to one between Domenico Ghirlandaio, Biagio d'Antonio or Cosimo Rosselli. History On 27 October 1480 several Florentine painters left for Rome, where they had been called as part of the reconciliation project between Lorenzo de' Medici, the de facto ruler of Florence, and Pope Sixtus IV. The Florentines started to work in the Sistine Chapel as early as the Spring of 1481, along with Pietro Perugino, who was already there. Detail of the storm. The theme of the decoration was a parallel between the Stories of Moses and those of Christ, as a sign of continuity between the Old and the New Testament. A continuity also between the divine law of the Tables and the message of Jesus, who, in turn, chose Peter (the first alleged bishop of Rome) as his successor: this would finally result in a legitimation of the latter's successors, the popes of Rome. Among the several fresco in the cycle, that of the Passage of the Red Sea was the one with the most problematic attribution. Although the name of Ghirlandaio was made by several authorities, the work's style is more reminiscent of that of Cosimo Rosselli or Biagio d'Antonio. Description Detail. The scene is part of the chapel's Stories of Moses cycle, and, like other frescoes there, shows several scenes at the same time. The sequence begins from the right background, where Moses and Aaron are begging the pharaoh to free the Israelites. On the right are the Egyptian soldiers, shown in typical Italian Renaissance military garments, armor and weapons, who are drowning after the Red Sea waters, which had miraculously opened to allow the Israelites to cross them, close around them. The pharaoh is portrayed in a frantic scream, while other figures try to return to the Egyptian shore by swimming. Before the army is a column hovering over the waters: this is a representation of the fire pillar sent by Yahweh to scare the Egyptians. In the upper central area is a hail storm, sent by God to punish the Egyptians. Also depicted are some sunrays and, more to the left, a rainbow, symbols of the upcoming liberation for the Israelite people. Similar representation of meteorological phenomena were not uncommon in the 15th- century Italian art: other examples are Fra Angelico's Martyrdom of St. Mark on the Tabernacle of the Linaioli, and several Paolo Uccello's St. George and the Drake. On the left are the Israelites, led by a young Moses with the typical yellow garment and green cloak, and a command baton, after they have just crossed the sea. Their safeness is testified by the presence of recreational activities, such as the prophetess Miriam playing a chordophone in the foreground. They continue their trip in procession, disappearing on the left, in a naturalistic landscape. Details include a pet dog in the foreground, reminiscent of Benozzo Gozzoli's paintings in the Magi Chapel.

Life Fielding was the fifth child and only son of Henry Fielding of Myerscough House, near Garstang, Lancashire. Being of a delicate constitution he was shut out from adopting a profession, but devoted himself to the study of plants and the formation of a rich herbarium, which his ample means permitted. In 1836 he bought the herbarium of Dr. Steudel, and the next year the Prescott collection, consisting of twenty-eight thousand plants. He was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1838. In 1842 he removed to a more airy house at Lancaster, where he died 21 November 1851 of a sudden attack of an inflammation of the lungs. Fielding bequeathed the whole of his herbarium, with such of his books as were wanting in the Garden Library, to the University of Oxford. His herbarium was combined with George Claridge Druce's herbarium to create the Fielding-Druce Herbarium. Works In 1844 Fielding published Sertum Plantarum, with figures and descriptions of 75 new or rare plants. The figures were drawn by his wife Mary, and the descriptions were written by Dr. George Gardner, who at one time had charge of the Fielding herbarium. References *Henry B. Fielding, Esq.

Life Benvenuto was born and died in Siena. Learning the basics of art under his father's watchful supervision and trained in the traditional Sienese style of painting (he was a contemporary of Giacomo Pacchiarotti, Bernardino Fungai and Pinturicchio), he worked on several frescoes and altarpieces undertaken by his father's studio. His first independent work, The Assumption of Mary of 1498 for the city of Montalcino (whose museum still holds it), Girolamo shows several differences to his father's style, with more elongated figures with more pronounced expressions. His most notable work, signed and dated to 1508, is his Madonna of the Snow, now in the Pinacoteca in Siena. It echoes two female portraits painted by him at about the same time (one in the National Gallery of Art, Washington). Surviving documents and works show he mainly produced religious works, but also created paintings on secular themes for domestic settings and cassoni - the latter include his Judgement of Paris tondo (intended for a bedroom and now in the Louvre). A second work, of similar subject matter to the above work, is located in the National Gallery of Victoria, Australia. This work incorporates two medieval themes, and has been heralded as one of his finest works on display outside of Europe. The Gallery paid an undisclosed amount for this painting which was said to be in the tens of millions of dollars. Sources *Diana Norman. Painting in Late Medieval and Renaissance Siena.

The advantages of SEPTIC are the specificity and speed (needs only a few minutes) offered by the characteristics of phage infection, the sensitivity due to fluctuation-enhanced sensing, and durability originating from the robustness of phages. An idealistic SEPTIC device may be as small as a pen and maybe able to identify a library of different bacteria within a few minutes measurement window. The mechanism SEPTIC utilizes bacteriophages as indicators to trigger an ionic response by the bacteria during phage infection. Microscopic metal electrodes detect the random fluctuations of the electrochemical potential due to the stochastic fluctuations of the ionic concentration gradient caused by the phage infection of bacteria. The electrode pair in the electrolyte with different local ion concentrations at the vicinity of electrodes form an electrochemical cell that produces a voltage depending on the instantaneous ratio of local concentrations. While the concentrations are fluctuating, an alternating random voltage difference will appear between the electrodes. According to the experimental studies, whenever there is an ongoing phage infection, the power density spectrum of the measured electronic noise will have a noise spectrum while, without phage infection, it is a 1/f noise spectrum. In order to have a high sensitivity, a DC electrical field attracts the infected bacteria (which are charged due to ion imbalance) to the electrode with the relevant polarization. Advantages The advantages of SEPTIC are the specificity and speed (needs only a few minutes) offered by the characteristics of phage infection, the sensitivity due to fluctuation-enhanced sensing, and durability originating from the robustness of phages. An idealistic SEPTIC device may be as small as a pen and maybe able to identify a library of different bacteria within a few minutes measurement window. History The SEPTIC concept was first conceived by Laszlo B. Kish and Maria Dobozi-King in 2004, and developed and demonstrated at the Electrical and Computer Engineering department of Texas A&M; University in collaboration with Mosong Cheng, Ry Young, Sergey M. Bezrukov (NIH), and Bob Biard. A new, related scheme, BIPIF, that has recently been conceived and analyzed by Laszlo B. Kish and Gabor Schmera (SPAWAR, United States Navy) utilizes the AC impedance fluctuations at related arrangements, and it promises higher sensitivity and less dependence on the electrodes.

Eastern and Western Fathers of the Church alike express the doctrinal message that goes back to Apostolic times and which constituted the universal teaching of the Early Church: the doctrine of Mary's necessary participation in the redemption of humanity as the New Eve. Early Church Fathers The Early Fathers looked to Paul's Letter of the Galatians 4: 4-5: \\"But when the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to ransom those under the law, so that we might receive adoption.\\" and related this to the woman spoken of in the Protevangelium of Genesis 3:15: \\"I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; They will strike at your head, while you strike at their heel.\\" Irenaeus of Lyons in his Against Heresies (5.21.1), followed by several other Fathers of the Church, interpreted the verse as referring to Christ.NAB, note to Genesis 3:15 Justin Martyr was among the first to draw a parallel between Eve and Mary. This derives from his comparison of Adam and Jesus. In his Dialogue with Trypho, written sometime between 155-167, he explains: > He became man by the Virgin, in order that the disobedience which proceeded > from the serpent might receive its destruction in the same manner in which > it derived its origin. For Eve, who was a virgin and undefiled, having > conceived the word of the serpent, brought forth disobedience and death. But > the Virgin Mary received faith and joy, when the angel Gabriel announced the > good tidings to her that the Spirit of the Lord would come upon her, and the > power of the Highest would overshadow her: wherefore also the Holy Thing > begotten of her is the Son of God; and she replied, 'Be it unto me according > to thy word.\\" And by her has He been born, to whom we have proved so many > scriptures refer, and by whom God destroys both the serpent and those angels > and men who are like him; but works deliverance from death to those who > repent of their wickedness and believe upon Him. Ireneaus, bishop of Lugdunum, also takes this up, in Against Heresies, written about the year 182:Schaff, Philip. \\"Introductory Note to Iren√¶us Against Heresies\\", The Apostolic Fathers with Justin Martyr and Irenaeus, (Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson, eds.) 1885 > In accordance with this design, Mary the Virgin is found obedient, saying, > ‚ÄúBehold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to your word.‚Äù > Luke 1:38 But Eve was disobedient; for she did not obey when as yet she was > a virgin. ... having become disobedient, was made the cause of death, both > to herself and to the entire human race; so also did Mary, having a man > betrothed [to her], and being nevertheless a virgin, by yielding obedience, > become the cause of salvation, both to herself and the whole human race. And > on this account does the law term a woman betrothed to a man, the wife of > him who had betrothed her, although she was as yet a virgin; thus indicating > the back-reference from Mary to Eve,...For the Lord, having been born ‚Äúthe > First-begotten of the dead,‚Äù Revelation 1:5 and receiving into His bosom the > ancient fathers, has regenerated them into the life of God, He having been > made Himself the beginning of those that live, as Adam became the beginning > of those who die. 1 Corinthians 15:20-22 Wherefore also Luke, commencing the > genealogy with the Lord, carried it back to Adam, indicating that it was He > who regenerated them into the Gospel of life, and not they Him. And thus > also it was that the knot of Eve's disobedience was loosed by the obedience > of Mary. For what the virgin Eve had bound fast through unbelief, this did > the virgin Mary set free through faith.Irenaeus. \\"Against Heresies\\", (Book > III, Chapter 22), Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol. 1., (Alexander Roberts and > William Rambaut, trans.), (Alexander Roberts, James Donaldson, and A. > Cleveland Coxe eds.)Buffalo, NY: Christian Literature Publishing Co., 1885 Medieval period The early Medieval period reflected an increased devotion to Mary after the Council of Ephesus which declared Mary Theotokos, which in the West was rendered \\"Mother of God\\". The rise of monasticism preserved the works of the Early Fathers. According to Luigi Gambero, sermons tended to follow a standard form: \\"...the sin of our first parents, the Eve-Mary parallel, the angel's Annunciation to Mary and the Incarnation of the Son of God, the birth of Christ...\\"Gambero, Luigi. \\"Medieval Mary\\", Ignatius Insight Modern In the 1854 apostolic constitution, Ineffabilis Deus, promulgating the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, Pope Pius IX referred to the opinion of the Fathers: > Hence, to demonstrate the original innocence and sanctity of the Mother of > God, not only did they frequently compare her to Eve while yet a virgin, > while yet innocence, while yet incorrupt, while not yet deceived by the > deadly snares of the most treacherous serpent; but they have also exalted > her above Eve with a wonderful variety of expressions. Eve listened to the > serpent with lamentable consequences; she fell from original innocence and > became his slave. The most Blessed Virgin, on the contrary, ever increased > her original gift, and not only never lent an ear to the serpent, but by > divinely given power she utterly destroyed the force and dominion of the > evil one.Pope Pius IX. \\"Mary compared with Eve\\", Ineffabilis Deus, December > 8, 1854 In the 1974 Apostolic Exhortation Marialis Cultus, Pope Paul VI saw Mary as the second Eve standing alongside and subordinated to Christ, the second Adam. As the second Eve, she is the new woman, the definitive expression of what it is to be human. In Mary we see what God intends for his people as a whole. \\"She is given to us as a pledge and guarantee that God's plan in Christ has already been realized in a creature.\\"The christian faith in the doctrinal documents of the Catholic Church, Neuner, T. and Dupuis, J. (eds): (London, 1983), p 211 The Roman Breviary contains a Mass in which Mary is described, \\"Mary, the New Eve, is the First Disciple of the New Law.\\"\\"Masses of the BVM: 20 Mary, the New Eve\\", iBreviary She appears in this way as the Coredemptrix, ‚Äúwith the Redeemer.‚Äù Within Church teaching lies the doctrine of Mary as Coredemptrix, as she who was the instrument with which mankind was redeemed. Drawing upon the Old Testament the Church finds Eve to be co-peccatrix, ‚Äúwith the Sinner,‚Äù because it was Eve who freely gave the ‚Äúinstrument‚Äù of the Fall. It is Eve who gave the ‚Äúforbidden fruit‚Äù to Adam, the Peccator, ‚Äúthe Sinner,‚Äù whose sin as father of the human race led to the loss of grace for the human race. This makes Mary Coredemptrix because she freely gave the instrument of the Redemption in her Fiat, in giving her body to bear Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. St. Ephraem called Mary ‚Äúthe price of the redemption of captives,‚Äù and it is in this way that the Church looks to her as ‚ÄúMother of the Living.‚Äù Through her obedience and faith, Mary became the New Eve as the Coredemptrix. (St. Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica) Further Quotes and Poetry on the Nova Eva: ‚ÄúA virgin, a bit of wood, and now death symbolize our defeat. See now how these three things have become for us a principle of life. For Eve there is Mary; for the tree of the knowledge of good and evil there is the wood of the Cross; for the death of Adam there is the death of Christ. Do you see the demon prostrated by the very weapons which had rendered him victorious?‚Äù Amphilochius of Iconium, On Christmas ...O Mary, O Mary, the Maker of all things was your firstborn Son! O humanity, who became the bodily substance of the Word and for that reason became more honorable than the spiritual virtues of heaven! For Christ did not want to clothe himself in the form of archangels or in the form of the immaterial figures of the principalities, virtues, and powers; rather, through you, he clothed himself in your form, which had fallen and become like that of the brute animals. ...but where now is that hostile and bewildered dragon? Where is that cursed and execrable dragon, who had claimed that this throne would be raised to the heights of heaven? Caelius Sedulius (d. ca. 440-450) Because of one man, all his descendents perished; And all are saved because of one man. Because of one woman, the deadly door opened; And life returned, because of one woman. (Elegia) We are the blind offspring of the children of pitiful Eve, Bringing with us the shadows born of an age-old error. But when God deigned to assume the mortal form Of a human nature, then came forth from the Virgin A world of salvation...

The stages following the sensor in a FES system typically contain filters and preamplifier(s) to extract and amplify the stochastic signal components, which are usually microscopic temporal fluctuations that are orders of magnitude weaker than the sensor signal. Then selected statistical properties of the amplified noise are analyzed, and a corresponding pattern is generated as the stochastic fingerprint of the sensed agent. Often the power density spectrum of the stochastic signal is used as output pattern however FES has been proven effective with more advanced methods, too, such as higher- order statistics. History During the 1990s, several authors (for example, Bruno Neri and coworkers, Peter Gottwald and Bela Szentpali) had proposed using the spectrum of measured noise to obtain information about ambient chemical conditions. However, the first systematic proposal for a generic electronic nose utilizing chemical sensors in FES mode, and the related mathematical analysis with experimental demonstration, were carried out only in 1999 by Laszlo B. Kish, Robert Vajtai and C.G. Granqvist at Uppsala University. The name \\"fluctuation-enhanced sensing\\" was created by John Audia (United States Navy), in 2001, after learning about the published scheme. During the years, FES has been developed and demonstrated in many studies with various types of sensors and agents in chemical and biological systems. Bacteria have also been detected and identified by FES, either by their odor in air, or by the \\"SEPTIC\\" method in liquid phase. In the period of 2006‚Äì2009 Signal Processing Inc (Chiman Kwan) developed a portable FES device in collaboration with Texas A&M; University (Laszlo B. Kish) and University of Szeged (Zoltan Gingl and Peter Heszler). Efforts to explore higher-order statistics for FES purposes were led by Janusz Smulko. SPAWAR (United States Navy) related FES projects were led by Gabor Schmera (see the US Navy patent site below).

The Ch√¢teau de Vizille is a castle in the French town of Vizille near Grenoble. It is one of the most prestigious and important castles of the Dauphin√© Region. Traditionally since the 14th century the Dauphin√© was the homeland of the inheritor of the French throne. Today the Ch√¢teau de Vizille houses the Mus√©e de la R√©volution fran√ßaise. History Fran√ßois de Bonne, Duke of Lesdigui√®res The former castle was held during the French Wars of Religion by the Catholics. With the peace settlement in 1593, the property was bought by the leader of the Protestant Army, Fran√ßois de Bonne, duc de Lesdigui√®res. From 1604 till 1619 the Duke, who became a Peer and the last Grand Constable of France, had his castle built to highlight his important role in the French court. The castle is surrounded by a wall of seven kilometers in length.  The Ch√¢teau in the French Revolution  Claude Perier In 1780 the Duke of Villeroy, Gabriel Louis de Neufville, sold the Chateau de Vizille and areas around it to Claude Perier for approximately 1,0254,000 livres. About a decade later, Claude had over 400 workers at the Ch√¢teau creating printed cotton. This building would end up playing an important role in the beginning of the French Revolution. May 1788 King Louis XVI decided to set a boundary on the amount of power of the Parliament of Dauphin√© in Grenoble. The Parliament openly expressed how dissatisfied they were with this decision and on June 7, 1788 they were not allowed to meet together. In return, the inhabitants of Grenoble threw tiles from the roofs onto the King's Guard. This event is known as \\"Tile Day\\" or \\"Day of the Tiles\\" in Grenoble. In July, Claude Perier, inspired by all of the Liberal ideas around him, invited delegates from the Clergy, the Nobility and the Third- Estate, to assemble the meeting, which had been previously prohibited in Grenoble, in the room of the Jeu de Paume of the castle. Almost 500 men gathered that day at the banquet hosted by Claude P√©rier. In attendance there were many \\"notables\\" including churchmen, businessmen, doctors, notaries, municipal officials, lawyers, and landed nobility. This event is known as the Assembly of Vizille. Demanded at this meeting: the Convocation in Paris of the Estates-General, where the Third Estate has double representation and where votes are by head, not by order. This meeting marked the first portion of the French Revolution. It also allowed Claude P√©rier and most of his family to live through the tough periods of the French Revolution without harm.  The Ch√¢teau as a Monument  One of the owners Adolphe-Joseph-Scipion Perier, son of Augustin Perier was married to a granddaughter of General Lafayette.http://www.domaine-vizille.fr/1924-le-domaine-propriete-des-perier- au-xixe-siecle.htm The Perier family owned it until 1895, during which time the castle itself was made a monument historique in 1862. In 1924 the castle became the property of the French State and in 1973 the castle was given by the French government to the Community Council of Isere. The Park Panorama with parc The castle park has a total of 320 acres of space, and is the most popular site in the Is√®re department with visitors in 2008.Summary of visitors of Sites and Museum in the Is√®re Region (french) The park was classified as a historic monument on 23 August 1991.

Trained in engineering and systematic theology, he based his office in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where, up until 2011, he ministered to students, faculty, and staff at the University of Michigan. He has authored and co-authored more than a dozen books. He has spoken around the world at events for youth, students, and young professionals. He helped begin and has sat on the Board of Directors for the Generation of Youth for Christ organization (GYC), a revival movement of Seventh-day Adventist youth in North America. He resigned his ministerial credentials in May 2011 and requested to be disciplined according to church protocol. He was disfellowshipped by his local church on June 15, 2011. Biography Pipim was born in Ghana, West Africa. He holds a degree in engineering from the University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana, where he subsequently served as a research and teaching assistant. Having been a leader in a non-denominational, charismatic movement, Pipim later became a Seventh-day Adventist. After accepting the call to the gospel ministry, he worked in the Central Ghana conference as its Coordinator of Campus Ministries. He later went to the United States to pursue a ministerial training at Andrews University where in 1998 he received a PhD in systematic theology, specializing in biblical authority, interpretation and ecclesiology. His doctoral dissertation, The Role of the Holy Spirit in Biblical Interpretation: A Study in the Writings of James I. Packer, was under the supervision of Raoul Dederen, with Clark H. Pinnock as the external examiner.‚ÄúThe Role of the Holy Spirit in Biblical Interpretation: A Study in the Writings of James Innel Packer‚Äù . In 1998, his church leadership in Michigan appointed him to direct its newly created department of Public Campus Ministries to cater for the spiritual needs of students on secular university campuses. Since that time, Pipim's theological ideas and philosophy has had a significant effect on students and young adults the world over.Shirley Burton, for example, has chronicled how Pipim inspired public university students to mobilize as a spiritual army that could positively impact the church.

In a work on ‚ÄúAdventist Views on Biblical and Prophetic Inspiration,‚Äù a colleague of Pipim's judged Receiving the Word as ‚Äúone of the most influential landmarks in that debate‚Äù and one of ‚Äúthe two main conflicting poles around which gravitate[d] the contemporary discussions on [the Bible's] inspiration‚Äù during the second half of the 1990s.Timm, Alberto R. ‚ÄúA History of Seventh-day Adventist Views on Biblical and Prophetic Inspiration (1844‚Äì2000),‚Äù Journal of the Adventist Theological Society, 10/1-2 (1999), pp. 534-535. In addition to challenging the method of moderate liberalism, Pipim's book also worked to make a strong case for his church's 1986 ‚ÄúMethods of Bible Study‚Äù statement, which ‚Äúurge[ed] Adventist Bible students to avoid relying on the use of the presuppositions and the resultant deductions associated with the historical- critical method.‚Äù‚ÄúMethods of Bible Study: Presuppositions, Principles, and Methods,‚Äù available on the General Conference and Biblical Research Institute websites (http://biblicalresearch.gc.adventist.org/documents/Methods%20Bible%20Study.htm).

Receiving the Word also claimed the use of contemporary higher criticism (the historical- critical method) was undermining key Seventh-day Adventist beliefs and practices. The book generated considerable reaction‚Äîboth for and against. Some took exception to the book, dismissing it as a \\"fundamentalist\\" view.Alden Thompson, En Route to a \`Plain Reading' of Scripture, \\" Spectrum 26:4 (January 1998), pp. 50‚Äì52. George R.

Scholars who embraced the church's historical positions, however, were more supportive of the book.Besides the favorable review of the book by the Director of the Biblical Research Institute of the General Conference, George W.

Gulley, Paul Gordon, Raoul Dederen, Clifford Goldstein, Alberto R. Timm, William H. Shea, Keith Burton, C. Raymond Holmes, Artur A. Stele, and Randall W. Younker. Their endorsements appear at the back of the book, where Raoul Dederen sums up their evaluation of the book: \\"An amazingly clear and competent presentation which will supply Seventh-day Adventists with a reasoned statement of their own position and challenge liberals to reexamine their fundamental presuppositions. I wish it the widest circulation.\\" Pipim contributed to the Biblical Research Institute's book Interpreting Scripture, published in 2010, a work which attempted to provide answers to questions often raised concerning the Bible.See: Pfandl Gerhard, ed., Interpreting Scripture: Bible Questions and Answers (Silver Springs, MD: Biblical Research Institute Studies, 2010).

Pipim has also spoken in many African Universities giving a lecture series, dubbed the \\"Why\\" lecture series which largely consists of him asking a series of ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù questions intended to illustrate his points.For example, during his March 2010 lecture at Ashesi University College in Ghana, Pipim outlined the following steps or principles to aid Africans in their quest to improve conditions on the continent: 1. Know and understand the problem; 2. Grow people to think outside the box; 3. Pursue excellence; and 4. Don't underestimate the power of one person. See, ‚ÄúDr. Samuel Koranteng Pipim Speaks about Making a Difference‚Äù, accessed March 18, 2011. Pipim has authored a number of books including Must We Be Silent? and Here We Stand. Youth ministry Between 1999 and 2011 Pipim served as the director of CAMPUS (Center for Adventist Ministry to Public University Students), a division of Michigan Conference Public Campus Ministries department. It is located near the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. CAMPUS was the department through which the Michigan Conference birthed, sponsored and directed the beginnings of Generation of Youth for Christ, then known as the General Youth Conference or GYC. Pipim has also been active in the Adventist Church's young adule ministry in other parts of the world. One of the ways he has done this is through an organization in Africa, ALIVE (Africans Living In View of Eternity). ALIVE is sponsored by CAMPUS and is a movement that intends to ‚Äúchange the face of Africa,‚Äù by mobilizing ‚Äúcommitted and dedicated young people with the courage to do ordinary things extraordinarily well.‚Äù In the words of a leader of ALIVE, this new breed of Africans are responding to the call ‚Äúto lead by principle and conviction . . . [and to] to cease settling for mediocrity and become an agent of positive change.‚ÄùKaremera, Valmy Stephen. ‚ÄúPresident's Welcome,‚Äù http://www.africansalive.org, Accessed March 22, 2011. Generation of Youth for Christ Writing about the history of GYC, a retired communication director of the General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventists, states the leaders of GYC were attracted to Pipim's ‚Äúcan-do, tell-it-like-it-is, traditional Adventism‚Äù and his ‚Äú‚Äòhigher than the highest‚Äô philosophy: of excellence that he advocated through CAMPUS.Shirley Burton, also a retired communication director of ASI, writes this in the Inside ASI magazine, the official publication of the International ASI organization: ‚ÄúThey were enrolled at some of the nation's most well known schools: Harvard, Brandeis, Wellesley, Brown, Princeton, Rutgers, Boston University, Eastern Michigan University, and the University of Michigan. All were Seventh-day Adventist youth trying to maintain their religious roots on secular campuses... All wanted something more from their religion than ‚Äòanecdotes and entertainment.‚Äô And then they heard about CAMPUS at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor... The message of CAMPUS and its mentor Samuel Pipim reached these students. Dr. Pipim's challenge for spiritual and academic excellence fell on willing ears and hearts. Students liked his can-do, tell-it-like-it-is, traditional Adventism. Committed to Dr. Pipim's ‚Äòhigher than the highest‚Äô philosophy of excellence, these scattered students began dreaming what they called the great experiment in 1999.‚Äù (Shirley Burton, ‚ÄúWith Such An Army ,‚Äù Inside ASI Magazine, Spring 2008, p. 14), accessed April 19, 2011. Empowered by Pipim's conservative theology and ideals, ‚Äúthese scattered students began dreaming what they called the great experiment in 1999.‚Äù Critics however, saw GYC as nothing more than another manifestation of reactionary, Historic Adventism. Until his resignation in 2011, Pipim continued to play a large role in shaping the direction of the youth movement through sitting on GYC's board of directors and being a regular presenter at GYC's annual conventions. During the 2008 convention, GYC stated that Pipim had \\"developed a reputation for his bold messages and commitment to the ultimate authority of God's Word.‚Äù2008 GYC programming booklet, p. 16. The same description is found in the 2009 and 2010 GYC programming booklets. Resignation, rape allegations, and re-baptism On May 31, 2011, Dr. Pipim resigned from his employment with the Michigan Conference of Seventh-day Adventists and canceled all his speaking appointments due to what he termed a \\"moral fall\\" while traveling overseas. The purported victim was a 20-year-old woman, who claimed through her counselor that she was raped by Pipim. The counselor involved was Jennifer Jill Schwirzer, a Christian recording musician, published author, counselor, and seminar presenter.https://www.jenniferjill.net In response to these claims, Pipim prepared a document titled, 'An Answer to Everyone: A Response To False Accusations', which he presented to the Ann Arbour Seventh-day Adventist Church on May 29, 2012, before disseminating for wider publication on June 3, 2012. Pipim was scheduled to be re-baptized into the worldwide Seventh-day Adventist Church on June 9, 2012, as part of the Ann Arbor Seventh-Day Adventist Church. However, his re-baptism was cancelled due to revelation of information about a separate \\"moral situation\\" that he and his wife had been in possession of for two years. With both the affirmation and disapproval of members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Dr. Pipim was finally re-baptized on June 20, 2014 at the Columbus Ghanaian Seventh-day Adventist Church in Columbus, Ohio.

Lean, originally developed at the Toyota Motor Corporation, is a management philosophy that emphasizes \\"respect for people\\" and \\"continuous improvement\\" as core tenets. Lean encourages employees at all organizational levels to re-imagine services from a customer's point of view, removing process steps that do not add value and emphasizing steps that add the most value. While the concept of \\"customers\\" and \\"products\\" is controversial in higher education settings, there are certainly diverse stakeholders who are interested in the success of colleges and universities, the most common of which are students, faculty, administrators, potential employers and various levels of government. Lean in higher education has been applied both to administrative and academic services. Balzer Lean Higher Education: Increasing the Value and Performance of University Processes (2010) described such initiatives within university settings, including the critical factors for success and ways to measure progress. He noted that LHE can be effective to respond to higher education's heightened expectations, reducing expenses in an era of rising costs, meeting demands of public accountability, and leveraging institutional resources to fulfill the educational, scholarship, and outreach missions of higher education. A comprehensive literature review examining Lean's impact on higher education has been published.Balzer, W.K., Francis, D., Krehbiel, T. & Shea, N. (2016). A review and perspective on Lean in higher education. Quality Assurance in Education. 24(4). http://hdl.handle.net/2374.MIA/5995 The authors reported that Lean has a significant and measurable impact when used to improve academic and administrative operations. Such improvements are effective at the department/unit level or throughout an entire institution. However, the authors noted that implementing Lean is a serious undertaking that is most impactful if it involves long-term, strategic planning. Though the application of Lean management in higher education is more prevalent in administrative processes (e.g., admissions, registration, HR, and procurement) it also has been applied to academic processes (e.g., course design and teaching,M.L. \\"Bob\\" Emiliani (2004) \\"Improving Business School Courses by Applying Lean Principles and Practices,\\" improving degree programs,M.L. \\"Bob\\" Emiliani (2005) \\"Using Kaizen to Improve Graduate Business School Degree Programs,\\" student feedback,Edinburgh Napier University \\"SUSTAINABLE FUTURES BRIEFING: RAPID IMPROVEMENT EVENT (RIE) ‚Äì Student Feedback (Business School)\\" and handling of assignments) in an increasing number of cases. Pioneering academic institutions who have implemented Lean include: Cardiff University (Wales), Edinburgh Napier University (Scotland), Michigan Technological University (USA), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (USA), University of Aberdeen (Scotland), University of Central Oklahoma (USA), University of St. Andrews (Scotland), Winona State University (USA) and others. A group of universities in the U.K. formed the LeanHEHub in 2012/2013. In 2016 the network was restructured due to growth, and is now known as Lean HE - the Lean in Higher Education Network. The Lean HE network has three continental divisions (Lean HE Americas, Lean HE Europe and Lean HE AsiaPacific). In Scotland, the Scottish Higher Education Improvement Network (SHEIN) is a collaborative network of HE professionals working within the area of continuous improvement. SHEIN exists to encourage the sharing of resources and best practice, online and face-to-face. In 2020 SHEIN became Lean HE Scotland, a sub-group of Lean HE Europe. Lean Principles Of great importance in the application of Lean management in any organization is the recognition and daily practice of the Lean principles: \\"Continuous Improvement\\" and \\"Respect for People.\\" The \\"Respect for People\\" principle is challenging for management to implement, because most managers have risen to their level of responsibility based on their superior \\"fire-fighting\\" skills. With Lean, managers are coaches who guide their employees through a problem solving process. The employee learns how to ask themselves the questions that enable them to solve problems on their own, with the same or better quality that the manager would have achieved. Problems occur when managers cannot relinquish control, resulting in zero-sum (win-lose) outcomes for people and inferior results. In other words, one party gains at another party's expense, and the losers are much less willing to participate in continuous improvement. This outcome impedes teamwork and information flows, and discourages daily efforts by administration, faculty, and staff to improve processes. In order to function properly, Lean management must be understood and practiced in a plus-sum (win- win) manner. The \\"Respect for People\\" principle is required in order to sustain continuous improvement . Lean Practices The origins of Lean practices date from late 19th- and early 20th-century industrial engineering. Lean practices have evolved over the decades since then to become much easier for non-specialists to understand and use. It is now common for people with backgrounds and interests far from industrial engineering to become highly competent Lean management practitioners. Therefore, the Lean management system has the benefit that everyone in an organization can apply the practices without the need for specialists. Seminal work in the application of Lean to academic processes was done by Prof. M.L. \\"Bob\\" EmilianiProf. M.L. \\"Bob\\" Emiliani's faculty home page when he was at Rensselaer Polytechnic University in the early 2000s and is described in two papers: M.L. \\"Bob\\" Emiliani (2004) \\"Improving Business School Courses by Applying Lean Principles and Practices,\\"M.L. \\"Bob\\" Emiliani (2004) \\"Improving Business School Courses by Applying Lean Principles and Practices\\" and M.L. \\"Bob\\" Emiliani (2005) \\"Using Kaizen to Improve Graduate Business School Degree Programs,\\".M.L. \\"Bob\\" Emiliani (2005) \\"Using Kaizen to Improve Graduate Business School Degree Programs\\" The former paper describes what individual faculty can do to improve their courses and delivery using Lean principles and practices. The latter paper describes what teams of faculty, staff, administrators, students, alumni, and employers can do to improve their courses using kaizen (literal translation: \\"change for the better\\"). Prof. Emiliani also produced a Kaizen Team Leader's Manual for improving academic courses and programs based on his work.Bob Emiliani, \\"Improving Higher Education\\" (2009), unpublished work The use of Lean practices in academic processes are described in two papers written by Prof. Emiliani cited above (Refs. 2,3), and in the book Lean Higher Education: Increasing the Value and Performance of University Processes. Lean Higher Education: Increasing the Value and Performance of University Processes Differences Between Lean in Higher Education and Lean in Other Sectors Lean in HE follows the same principles and practices of Lean management as applied in service, manufacturing, or government sectors. Lean management readily takes into account the unique governance structures of higher education institutions.Alisa Salewski (2009) \\"How to Launch Lean in a University\\", ASQ Lean management is responsive to the needs of multiple stakeholders in a non-zero-sum fashion and is therefore well-suited for the governance and ongoing improvement of HEIs. The business of teaching in, or the back office administration of, Higher Education Institutions (HEI's) is similar to Lean management practiced in other service sectors because teaching and administration consist of repeatable transactional processes, in whole or part. Guidance for Lean implementation in HE administration, and, to a lesser extent in teaching, is presented in the book Lean Higher Education, Increasing the Value and Performance of University Processes.William K. Balzer (2010) Lean Higher Education, Increasing the Value and Performance of University Processes, Productivity Press Impact of Lean in Higher Education The impact of Lean in HE (namely in academic activities), have been studied and found to be potentially beneficial. The benefits include lead-time reduction, increase in throughput, lower cost, increased student satisfaction scores, etc. Reports analyzing Lean in higher education indicate that Lean principles are being successfully applied. Tobias Langer(2011) \\"The Application of Lean thinking for Improving Processes in Higher Education Institutions; Evidence from three UK case studies\\", Queens University BelfastY.R. Parasmal, (2009) \\"Application of Lean Thinking in Higher Education\\", Strategum Consulting, India Zoe Radnor & Giovanni Bucci (2011) \\"Analysis of Lean Implementation in UK Business Schools and Universities\\", Association of Business Schools Various HE stakeholders will likely perceive their organization to be substantially different or possess unique characteristics compared to other service organizations or businesses using Lean management. These reports, as well as a wide range of empirical results, show such perceptions to be erroneous. Criticisms of Lean Management The principal criticisms of Lean management are well known, relatively few in number, and have been constant over time.Emiliani (2014) \\"Same Six Criticisms of Lean\\" Workers may view Lean management as undesirable if it is incorrectly implemented, because it could make them work harder, they might have less time to spend with customers, and, ultimately, they could lose their jobs. These criticisms, which will surely be voiced by faculty and staff in HE, are predictable Emiliani (2013) \\"Lean Must Do No Harm\\" and the result of zero-sum (win-lose) application of Lean management by senior managers. Supporters of Lean might assert that Lean management can be conducted in a non-zero-sum (win-win) manner‚Äîthe criticism is simply a result of misapplication of the central concepts.

The group formed in the late 1980s in Albany, New York, touring extensively, and releasing at least nine different 45 rpm records, LP records, and CD recordings. The band had a full-page narrative dedicated to them in Timothy Gassen's book The Knights of Fuzz, about the garage rock and psychedelic music phenomenon of 1980-1995. Of thousands of bands covered in the book, Gassen listed 1313 Mockingbird Lane on his \\"all time Hot 100\\" list, which also included The Chesterfield Kings and the Flamin' Groovies. History The music of 1313 Mockingbird Lane was said to keep to the basics of fuzz guitar, Farfisa organ, and screaming. The original line-up featured Haunted Hausmann (guitar, vocals), Kim13 (organ), Jay \\"Robin Graves\\" Howlett (bass, vocals), and Steve E. Luv (drums). The first of several \\"must have 45s\\" was a debut single produced on Scarab Records in 1989, titled Hornets Nest b/w My Hearse Is Double Parked. With later songs like \\"Dig Her Up\\" and an anti- Beatles tune called \\"I Don't Wanna Hold Your Hand\\", the prominent lyrical themes of gloom and doom presented by the band were combined with a healthy dose of tongue-in-cheek garage humor. Drummer Steve E. Luv quickly departed and was replaced by former Link Wray Live In '85 drummer Marty Feier. The band's second release, the four-song EP The Second Coming Of 1313 Mockingbird Lane (Scarab Records 1989) was voted by both Schenectady Gazette and Albany's Metroland as one of the \\"top local recordings of 1989\\" and was distributed internationally. Shortly after the release of that EP, the band signed with Sundazed Records. Sundazed Records releases rare and previously unreleased tracks by different garage rock and surf music bands including The Knickerbockers and The Five Americans. The band's first full-length LP Have Hearse Will Travel was released by Sundazed in 1990. The vinyl was pressed in a distinct slime green color. The liner notes for the 13-song album were written by Blotto lead singer, Sergeant Blotto. From this point, the band line-up changed again with the eventual departure of both bassist Robin Graves and drummer Marty Feier, who was replaced by Rusty \\"Krusty\\" Nales, then by drummer OP, and replaced again by Dave Pollack. As organist Kim commented, \\"We go through more drummers than Spinal Tap. Feier departed the band for a full time touring gig in The Cast of Beatlemania, which starred members of the Broadway show Beatlemania. 1313 Mockingbird Lane would perform multiple double bills with Boston-based garage rock legends, Lyres. In early 1994, the band caught some media attention by issuing a simultaneous triple release of their new recordings. In September 1994, Brian Goodman of Rochester, New York band The Projectiles replaced drummer Dave Pollack for the final two singles, released in 1996. The band split up in 1996, playing the last show at Pauly's Hotel in their hometown of Albany. That night, Susan Yasinski from Susan and the Surftones was in the crowd and recruited Brian Goodman to join her band, with Kim13 soon to follow. The band recently successfully completed a PledgeMusic campaignPledgeMusic: 1313 Mockingbird Lane which resulted in the April 2015 Cacaphone Records re-release of the debut LP on vinyl, CD, and cassette, remastered with bonus tracks.

Early life and education Fisher was the son of Payne Fisher, one of the captains in the royal life guard while Charles I was in Oxfordshire, and grandson of Sir William Fisher, knight. He was born at Warnford, Hampshire, in the house of his maternal grandfather, Sir Thomas Neale. He matriculated at Hart Hall, Oxford, in Michaelmas term, 1634; three years later he moved to Magdalene College, Cambridge. While at Cambridge he first developed 'a rambling head' and a turn for verse-making.Wood, Athen√¶, Bliss, iv. 377 He left the university suddenly, around 1638, and entered the army in the Netherlands. There he fought in the defence of Boduc. Returning to England before long, he enlisted as an ensign in the army raised (1639) by Charles I for the Bishops' War, and during this campaign made acquaintance with the cavalier poet Richard Lovelace. Subsequently, Fisher took service in Ireland, where he rose to the rank of captain, and, returning about 1644, was made, by Lord Chichester's influence, sergeant-major of a foot regiment in the royalist army. By Prince Rupert's command he marched at the head of three hundred men to relieve York. Fisher was present at Battle of Marston Moor, but found himself on the losing side. He deserted the royalist cause after the battle, and went to London, where he lived as best he could by his pen. Later life Fisher's character was too notorious for him to gain favour by his flatteries, and he lived poor and out of favour after the Restoration. Fisher died in poverty in a coffee-house in the Old Bailey 2 April 1693, and was buried 6 April in a yard belonging to the church of St. Sepulchre's. William Winstanley summed up Fisher's character in the following words: 'A notable undertaker in Latin verse, and had well deserved of his country, had not lucre of gain and private ambition overswayed his pen to favour successful rebellion.' Winstanley adds that he had intended to 'commit to memory the monuments in the churches in London and Westminster, but death hindered him'.Lives of the Poets, pp. 192, 193 Works Fisher's first poem, published in 1650, celebrating the parliamentary victory of Marston Moor, was entitled 'Marston Moor, Eboracense carmen; cum quibusdam miscellaneis opera studioque Pagani Piscatoris, . . .' London, 1650. He always wrote under this name, or that of Fitzpaganus Fisher. By his turn for Latin verse and his adulatory arts, or, as Anthony Wood termed it, by his ability 'to shark money from those who delighted to see their names in print,' Fisher soon became the fashionable poet of his day. He was made poet-laureate, or in his own words after the Restoration, 'scribbler' to Oliver Cromwell. He wrote not only Latin panegyrics and congratulatory odes on the Protector, dedicating his works to John Bradshaw and the most important of the parliamentary magnates, but also composed elegies and epitaphs on the deaths of their generals. Thus the 'Irenodia Gratulatoria, sive illus. amplissimique Oliveri Cromwellii . . . Epinicion,' London, 1652, was dedicated to the president (Bradshaw) and the council of state, and concluded with odes on the funerals of Edmund Ludlow and Edward Popham (London, 1652). To another, 'Veni vidi, vici, the Triumphs of the most Excellent and Illustrious Oliver Cromwell . . . set forth in a panegyric, written in Latin, and faithfully done into English verse by T. Manly' (London, 1652, 8vo), was added an elegy upon the death of Henry Ireton, lord deputy of Ireland. The 'Inauguratio Oliveriana, with other poems' (Lond. 1654), was followed the next year by 'Oratio Anniversaria in die Inaugurations . . . Olivari . . .' (London, 1655, fol.), and again other panegyrics on the second anniversary of 'his highness's' inauguration (the 'Oratio . . .' and 'Paean Triumphalis,' both London, 1657). To the 'Paean' was added an epitaph on Admiral Robert Blake, which, like most of Fisher's odes and elegies, was also published separately as a 'broadsheet' (see list in Wood, ed. Bliss, Athen√¶ Oxon. iv. 377, &c.;) He celebrated the victory of Dunkirk in an 'Epinicion vel elogium . . . Ludovici XIIII . . . pro nuperis victoriis in Flandria, praecipue pro desideratissima reductione Dunkirk√¶ captaa . . . sub conf≈ìderatis auspiciis Franco-Britannorum' (London ? 1655 ?). The book has a portrait of the French king in the beginning, and French verses in praise of the author at the end. Fisher afterwards presented Samuel Pepys with a copy of this work 'with his arms, and dedicated to me very handsome'. It was a usual habit of the poet's to put different dedications to such of his works as might court the favour of the rich and powerful. He once attempted to recite a Latin elegy on Archbishop Ussher in Christ Church Hall, Oxford (17 April 1656), the undergraduates made such a tumult that he never attempted another recitation at the university. He printed \\"what he had done\\" in the Mercurius Politicus (1658), which called forth some satire doggerel from Samuel Woodford in Naps upon Parnassus (1658) (see Wood). It was not till 1681 that the elegy on Ussher was separately issued, and then an epitaph on the Earl of Ossory was printed with it. With the return of the Stuarts the time- server turned his coat, and his verses were now as extravagant in praise of the king as they had been of the Protector. At the Restoration there was a pamphlet entitled 'The Speeches of Oliver Cromwell, Henry Ireton, and John John Bradshaw, intended to have been spoken at their execution at Tyburne 30 June 1660, but for many weightie reasons omitted, published by Marchamont Nedham and Pagan Fisher, servants, poets, and pamphleteers to his Infernal Highness,' 1660, (Bodl.) He spent several years in the Fleet Prison, and while there he published two works on the monuments in the city churches, written before or just after the Great Fire of London. The first of these compilations is 'A Catalogue of most of the Memorable Tombs, &c.;, in the Demolisht or yet extant Churches of London from St. Katherine's beyond the Tower to Temple Barre,' written 1666, published 1668, 'two years after the great fire,' London. The second is 'The Tombs, Monuments, and Sepulchral Inscriptions lately visible in St. Paul's Cathedral . . . by Major P. F., student in antiquity, grandchild to the late Sir William Fisher and that most memorable knight, Sir Thomas Neale, by his wife, Elizabeth, sister to that so publick- spirited patriot, the late Sir Thomas Freke' of Shroton, Dorset; from the Fleet, with dedication to Charles II, after the fire, London, 1684. Several editions were published of both these catalogues, including that revised and edited by G. B. Morgan, entitled 'Catalogue of the Tombs in the Churches of the City of London,' 1885. Besides the works above, and a quantity of other odes and epitaphs, Fisher edited poems on several choice and various subjects, occasionally imparted by an eminent author (i. e. James Howell); collected and published by Sergeant-major P. F., London, 1663; the second edition, giving the author's name, is entitled 'Mr. Howel's Poems upon divers emergent occasions,' and dedicated to Dr. Henry King, bishop of Chichester, with a preface by Fisher about Howell, whom he describes as having 'asserted the royal rights in divers learned tracts,' London, 1664. Fisher also published: * 'Deus et Rex, Rex et Episcopus,' London, 1675. * 'Elogia Sepulchralia,' London, 1675, a collection of some of Fisher's many elegies. * 'A Book of Heraldry,' London, 1682. * 'The Anniversary of his Sacred Majesty's Inauguration, in Latin and English; from the Fleet, under the generous jurisdiction of R. Manlove, warden thereof,' London, 1685.

R. Prabhu. The film features Karthi and Pranitha in the lead roles, while Santhanam, Prakash Raj, Kota Srinivasa Rao, Raadhika, and Nassar appear in supporting roles. Dubbed versions of the film were released in Telugu and Hindi as Shakuni (2012) and Rowdy Leader (2016) respectively. The film was declared an average hit. Plot The film starts with the demise of CM (Satyamoorthy), a political plot produced by R. K. Boopathi (Prakash Raj). Then, we are introduced to Kamalakannan (Karthi), who tells his story to auto driver Rajini Appadurai (Santhanam). Rajini assumes that Kamal is rich and drives him around the city to be profited for him. Kamal is actually a country boy who is working in a small company. He has come to the city to meet concerned politicians and plead them to halt a subway project, by which he could lose his property in his village. He is the son of a humble person who serves unlimited food to the guests and passersby every day. Under this background, he has come to Chennai to settle the matter as the forefather's property is living heaven for the family. Kamal stays in his aunt Rani's (Roja) house, and love blossoms between him and her daughter Sridevi (Pranitha Subhash). Their love affair breaks up as it is not accepted by Rani. Kamal meets Boopathi, who once visited their village during the election campaign and had promised to do good needs when required. Kamal comes to know that Boopathi is the one behind the project. Kamal disillusioned with the system becomes a shrewd political analyst and campaigner and makes Ramani (Raadhika) the Mayor of Chennai by helping in her campaigns. He later, in a jail, gets the contact of Perumal (Kota Srinivasa Rao), who has an infamous political party. Meanwhile, he joins Perumal's party and makes him win the election, making him the CM of Tamil Nadu. Boopathi is finally arrested for being the reason behind for Sathyamoorthy's suicide with his family. Kamal, at last, saves his property with his intelligence and unites with Sridevi.

Karthi confirmed the news and revealed he would feature in a new get-up for the film, although expressing that the script was still in development. Veteran actress Raadhika signed on to play a supporting role in May 2011, whilst Roja signed on to play a doctor in the film and Mumtaj was selected to play a role making her comeback after 3 years. Kannada actress Pranitha who made her debut in Tamil with Udhayan, was confirmed for the lead female role after much speculation that Shriya Saran would form a part of the cast. Kota Srinivasa Rao and Salim Ghouse were selected to play politicians in the film, while Nassar was roped in to play a godman. However, in a turn of events, it was announced that the makers were unimpressed with Ghouse's performance and replaced him with Prakash Raj. Subsequently, combination scenes shot with Ghouse and Mumtaj, including those which appeared in the original trailer, were removed and reshot with Prakash Raj and Kiran Rathod. Anushka Shetty shot for a cameo role, that of a funny police officer within one day, while Andrea Jeremiah also appeared in a single scene. The first look of the film was duly released through a series of promotional posters in early 2011, with the makers suggesting a potential release to coincide with Diwali 2011. Some scenes were shot in and around Chennai including the Napier bridge, while the climax was shot in Hyderabad. The songs were choreographed by Bobby Antony, Baba Baskar, Prem Rakshith and Raju; one of which was shot in Poland. There were rumours that the film was based on Neera Radia but makers quickly denied it. The team shot a scene at the famous shopping complex near Ashok Nagar in Chennai. The director and his crew were happy to complete the shoot before the place got uncontrollably crowded. Soundtrack The soundtrack, composed by G. V. Prakash Kumar, consists of 5 tracks. The track \\"Manasellam Mazhaiye\\" was reused from the hit song \\"Chalisuva Cheluve\\" also sung by Sonu Nigam and Saindhavi, from the Kannada film Ullasa Utsaha, which featured music composed by Prakash Kumar. The audio launch was to be held on 11 May, but postponed to 2 June. The Telugu version released on 5 June. Two songs along with the videos were launched on 25 May, Karthi's birthday. The song \\"Kandha Kaaravadai\\" has been downloaded 75,000 times. Other songs like \\"Manasellam Mazhaiye\\" and \\"Vella Bambaram\\" also topped the charts . Eventually the album became successful among masses. Review Rediff wrote that it was \\"run-of-the-mill and has nothing new to offer\\". Behindwoods wrote: \\"The songs have all been composed with the sole intention of entertaining the audience. Save the melody, the rest all play to the gallery all the way. Good 'mass' album\\". Release The distribution rights were bought by Studio Green and Vendhar Movies for . The satellite rights of the film were secured by Sun TV. The film was given a \\"U\\" certificate by the Indian Censor Board and Telugu version was given a \\"U/A\\" certificate. It was slated to release in April initially, but failed to meet the deadline and would be released on 22 June eventually. Makers have planned to release the films in more than 1,100 screens across the globe. Andhra will see the film being released in 450 screens. Telugu rights were bought by Bellamkonda Suresh for .Saguni Telugu rights were sold for 8 crore The producers have spent more than 120 million for the promotion of the film. The film Shakuni opened in 85 screens in Kerala by Beebah Creations & Sayujyam Cine Release. Reception Saguni received mixed to positive reviews upon release. Behindwoods quoted that Saguni was a fairly engaging political game giving main credits to Karthi and Santhanam.

It was founded in 1968. Following their 1‚Äì15 to 3‚Äì11 victory in the 2014 Limerick Intermediate Football Championship over St Senan's, Na Piarsaigh are one of three dual senior club in hurling and Gaelic football in Limerick. The club currently field five adult teams three in hurling (senior, Intermediate & Junior) and two in football (Senior & Junior), the most of any club in Limerick. In 2011, Na Piarsaigh won their first ever Munster Senior Club Hurling Championship. In November 2015, Na Piarsaigh won their third Munster Senior Club Hurling Championship after a 2‚Äì18 to 2‚Äì11 win against Ballygunner in the final. On St Patrick's Day, 2016 Na Piarsaigh won their first ever All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship beating Ruair√≠ √ìg, Cushendall 2‚Äì25 to 2‚Äì14 in Croke Park, becoming the first ever Limerick club to do so. In November 2016 Na Piarsaigh won the Limerick Junior 'A' County Hurling Championship beating fellow city club St Patrick's 1‚Äì16 to 1‚Äì12, earning promotion to the Limerick Intermediate Hurling Championship for 2017 and becoming the only club in Limerick to field teams in both the Senior & Intermediate County Hurling Championships.  Club Formation  The formation of Na Piarsaigh GAA Club was initiated in the industrial boom time of the 1960s and the inaugural meeting was held in the Ardh√∫ House Hotel on Tuesday 16 January 1968 when the attendance included Rev.Fr.J.Browne C.C and three officials of the Limerick County Board ‚Äì Jackie O'Connell, Chairman; Tom Boland, Secretary and Mick O'Brien, Treasurer. Opening the meeting, Mr. Noel Drumgoole said that the fine attendance was most heartening and an indication of the interest in the formation of the GAA club in the parish. He paid tribute to Treaty Sarsfields for their work in promoting Gaelic games on the north side of the city, but stressed that in view of the considerable housing development in areas such as Greystones, Highfield, Mayorstone, Clareview and Caherdavin a new club, which initially would cater solely for underage players, was a very definite necessity. Many children were not given the opportunity of playing Gaelic games or any other games in fact, due to the deplorable lack of playing pitches and open spaces in the area. Mr. Jackie O'Connell expressed his delight at the formation of the club and promised the full support of the county board. He outlined details of the various grants which would be forthcoming for the purchase and development of a playing field and mentioned that particular consideration is given by the Central Council of the GAA, by way of additional grants to clubs in city areas. Fr. Browne spoke at length on the importance of providing recreational facilities for the youth of the parish. After many suggestions were made it was unanimously agreed that the club would be called \\"Cumann Na Piarsaigh\\". It was agreed that for 1968 Na Piarsaigh would enter teams in the City Bord na n√ìg competitions in the under 14, 15 and 16 grades in both hurling and football. Street leagues and challenge games were also arranged to ensure that the boys interested in Gaelic games would be afforded the chance to do so. Pending the purchase of land, the club decided to avail of the offer of a fine playing pitch in Caherdavin. In accordance with top level GAA policy the meeting decided that Na Piarsaigh would place particular emphasis on social activities for the members and towards this end it was envisaged that a pavilion and Pitch and Putt course would be included in their proposed pitch and complex. The following officers were elected to guide the destiny of Na Piarsaigh in their initial year. President; Rev.Fr.Browne, C.C Holy Rosary Parish. Chairman; Mr. Noel Drumgoole, Greystones Vice-Chairman; Mr. Eddie O'Connor, Highfield. Secretary; Mr.Tom McInerney,Caherdavin. Treasurer; Mr.Mossy O'Grady, Mayorstone. Committee: Messrs.Michael Cotter, Greystones; Donal Curtin, Mayorstone; Jimmy Custy, Clareview; Oliver Moran, Clareview; Frank Cleary, Caherdavin; Jim Beary, O'Callaghan Strand; Michael O'Brien, Shelbourne Road; Paddy O'Malley, Shelbourne Park; Flan O'Neill, Greystones; Jack Ryan, Greystones; John Rowsome, Shelbourne Park.  Underage Development  Na Piarsaigh has traditionally well-developed juvenile structures which is reflected by the success of the underage teams at both divisional and county level. The pinnacle of this success was the U14 All Ireland F√©ile na nGeal Hurling Championship winning team of 1984. As with most GAA clubs, underage development is complemented by well-established links with the local schools. Most of Na Piarsaigh's younger players attend Scoil Chr√≠ost R√≠ Caherdavin or John F. Kennedy memorial school. There is also a strong link to local secondary school, Ardscoil R√≠s, with Na Piarsaigh players making significant contributions to the very successful Dr. Harty Cup panels of 2010, 2011 and 2014.

History On 27 October 1480 a group of Florentine painters left for Rome, where he had been called as part of the reconciliation project between Lorenzo de' Medici, the de facto ruler of Florence, and Pope Sixtus IV. The Florentines started to work in the Sistine Chapel as early as the Spring of 1481, along with Pietro Perugino, who was already there. Neither Bartolomeo della Gatta nor Luca Signorelli (who was thirty at the time) appear in the official contracts signed between the Papal court and the painters, but they were most likely among the assistants of Perugino, who was the general superintendent of the works. Signorelli is mentioned in the Sistine Chapel after his master left in 1482, as the author of the Disputation over Moses' Body on the entrance wall (repainted by Matteo da Lecce in 1574 due to its poor state). Detail of the fresco. It has been supposed that Perugino provided at least the layout of the fresco, while its realization, basing on a comment by Giorgio Vasari, had been assigned traditionally to Signorelli. Studies by art historians such as Mario Salmi, reduced Signorelli's presence in the work, and attributed most of the painting to Bartolomeo della Gatta, a painter influenced by the purity of Piero della Francesca and the early Perugino. The theme of the decoration was a parallel between the Stories of Moses and those of Christ, as a sign of continuity between the Old and the New Testament. A continuity also between the divine law of the Tables and the message of Jesus, who, in turn, chose Peter (the first alleged bishop of Rome) as his successor: this would finally result in a legitimation of the latter's successors, the popes of Rome. Description The fresco portrays the last episode in Moses' life, in two sectors: a foreground one including two scenes, and a background one, with three further scenes and, on the right, a landscape. Moses is always recognizable through his yellow garments and the green cloak, as in the rest of the cycle. The artist made an extensive use of gold painting. On the background Moses, on the Mount Nebo, receives by an angel the command baton, which gives him the authority to lead the Israelites towards the Promised Land. Below, Moses descends from the mountain with the baton in his hand, similarly to Cosimo Rosselli's Descent from Mount Sinai nearby. In the foreground, on the right, is a 120-year-old Moses speaking at the crowd while holding the baton and a Holy Book: rays of light stem from his head. At his feet is the Ark of the Covenant, opened to show the Twelve Tables and the vase of the Manna. In the center, the procession includes a woman holding a child on her shoulders, wearing silk, an elegant youth portrayed from behind and a naked man sitting. The latter two characters are attributed to Luca Signorelli, as well as the man with a stick next the throne of Moses. On the left is the appointment of Joshua as Moses' successor; the former kneels to receive the command baton, while the prophet has his cloak opened, showing a red-lined interior. Finally, on the left background, is the corpse of Moses on a shroud, surrounded by the dismayed Israelites.

In engineering and physics, a spring system or spring network is a model of physics described as a graph with a position at each vertex and a spring of given stiffness and length along each edge. This generalizes Hooke's law to higher dimensions. This simple model can be used to solve the pose of static systems from crystal lattice to springs. A spring system can be thought of as the simplest case of the finite element method for solving problems in statics. Assuming linear springs and small deformation (or restricting to one-dimensional motion) a spring system can be cast as a (possibly overdetermined) system of linear equations or equivalently as an energy minimization problem.  Known spring lengths  If the nominal lengths, L, of the springs are known to be 1 and 2 units respectively, then the system can be solved as followed: Consider the simple case of three nodes connected by two springs. Then the stretching of the two springs is given as a function of the positions of the nodes by : \\\\Delta \\\\mathbf{L} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}1 & -1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 & -1\\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{x} - L Let A be that \\"connectivity matrix\\", relating each degree of freedom to the direction each spring pulls on it. So the forces on the springs is :F_\\\\text{springs} = -K\\\\Delta L = -K (A \\\\mathbf{x} - L) = -K A \\\\mathbf{x} + KL where K is a diagonal matrix giving the stiffnesses of all of the springs. Then the force on the nodes is given by left multiplying by A^\\\\top, which we set to zero to find equilibrium: : F_\\\\text{nodes} = -A^\\\\top K A \\\\mathbf{x} + A^\\\\top K L = 0 which gives the linear equation: : A^\\\\top K A \\\\mathbf{x} = A^\\\\top K L. Now, A^\\\\top K A is singular, because all solutions are equivalent up to rigid-body translation. Let us prescribe a Dirichlet boundary condition, e.g., x_1 = 2. Suppose K is the identity and so :A^\\\\top K A = \\\\begin{bmatrix}1 & -1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 1\\\\end{bmatrix}. If we plug in x_1 = 2 we have :A^\\\\top K A \\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}1 & -1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 1\\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\begin{bmatrix}2 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3\\\\end{bmatrix} = A^\\\\top K L = \\\\begin{bmatrix}-1-1\\\\2\\\\end{bmatrix}. Incorporating the 2 to the left-hand side gives :\\\\begin{bmatrix}2-2\\\\0\\\\end{bmatrix} + \\\\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1\\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\begin{bmatrix}x_2 \\\\ x_3\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}-1-1\\\\2\\\\end{bmatrix}. and removing rows of the system that we already know, and simplifying, leaves us with :\\\\begin{bmatrix}-2\\\\0\\\\end{bmatrix} + \\\\begin{bmatrix}2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1\\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\begin{bmatrix}x_2 \\\\ x_3\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}-1\\\\2\\\\end{bmatrix}. : \\\\begin{bmatrix}2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1\\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\begin{bmatrix}x_2 \\\\ x_3\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\2\\\\end{bmatrix}. so we can then solve :\\\\begin{bmatrix}x_2 \\\\ x_3\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1\\\\end{bmatrix}^{-1} \\\\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\2\\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}3\\\\5\\\\end{bmatrix}. That is, x_1=2, as prescribed, and x_2=3, leaving the first spring slack, and x_3=5, leaving the second spring slack.

He was later, somewhat reluctantly, in the company of the rebels at the Battle of New Ross. After the battle, and the royalists had regained the town, he fled with his wife and Bagenal Harvey to the Greater Saltee Island, from whence they planned to escape to republican France. They were betrayed under torture by a local farmer, arrested, and brought to Wexford town to be court-martialled. Found guilty, they were hanged on Wexford bridge on 28 June 1798, their heads afterwards put on spikes and their bodies thrown into the River Slaney. Colclough's body was recovered by his supporters during the night and buried in St. Patrick's burying ground, Wexford.

Since its opening in 2010 the structure has become an important pedestrian crossing in the city, as well as a significant tourist attraction and one of the most well-recognized landmarks of the capital. History The bridge which stretches over the Kura River was ordered by the City Hall of Tbilisi to create a contemporary design feature connecting Old Tbilisi with the new district. The official opening took place on May 6, 2010. The bridge stretches over Kura River providing a view of the Metekhi Church, statue of the city's founder Vakhtang Gorgasali, and the Narikala Fortress on one side, and Baratashvili Bridge and Presidential Office on the other. Design left The bridge was designed by the Italian architect Michele De Lucchi, who had also designed the buildings of the Presidential Administration of Georgia and Ministry of Internal Affairs in Tbilisi; the lighting design was created by the French lighting designer Philippe Martinaud. The structure of the bridge was built in Italy and transported to Tbilisi in 200 trucks while the lighting was installed on site during the assembly of the structures. The bridge, a design of which reminds of a marine animal, has a curvy steel and glass canopy top which shimmers with an interactive light display at night, generated by thousands of white LEDs. The roof is fitted with 1,208 custom LED fixtures. The handrail glass panels which run along the whole length of the walkway are equipped with embedded linear low-power LED arrays. The lighting which is live from 90 minutes before sunset until 90 minutes after sunrise, features four different lighting programs that run on the canopy every hour. At times, the bridge lights up in waves from one side of the river to the other. At other times, the pattern begins with a band of light at either end, continuing from either direction until the light meets in the middle, and fading to black before starting over. The third program starts by lighting the outer fixtures on the roofline, then briefly illuminates the entire canopy before going entirely dark. The fourth program makes the roof twinkle like stars as different groups of fixtures light and dim across the entire bridge length. Within the bridge walkway, the low-power linear LED arrays embedded in the glass railings are triggered by 240 motion sensors as the pedestrians pass, giving an impression that the bridge lights come on for each person setting foot on the bridge. Additionally, a message in Morse code that renders the periodic table of elements goes across two parapets every hour. The lights designer Martinaud considers this communication celebration of \\"life and peace between people\\". Criticism The construction of a new steel and glass bridge in the historical district of Tbilisi was controversial. Several opposition politicians, architects, and urban planners unleashed criticism, complaining that the bridge unduly dominated the historical old town and obscured the area's old architectural landmarks. The bridge has been nicknamed the \\"Always Ultra\\" bridge for its perceived resemblance to a ladies' maxi- pad.Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Lonely Planet, p.122Flashy Bridge Symptomatic of Georgia's Malaise, IWPRIn Tbilisi, Georgia, Bold New Buildings Rise From the Ruins of Dead Empires, New York Times Magazine, November 1, 2013 See also * Architecture of Georgia References External links  Category:Deck arch bridges Category:Through arch bridges Category:Covered bridges Category:Footbridges Category:Bridges completed in 2010 Category:Buildings and structures in Tbilisi Category:Bridges in Georgia (country) Category:Tourist attractions in Tbilisi ","title":"Bridge of Peace"},{"id":"31675602","text":"This is a list of surviving North American P-51 Mustangs, including airworthy planes and planes on display.

They are a class of co-comparability graphs that contain interval graphs and permutation graphs as subclasses. A graph is a trapezoid graph if there exists a set of trapezoids corresponding to the vertices of the graph such that two vertices are joined by an edge if and only if the corresponding trapezoids intersect. Trapezoid graphs were introduced by Dagan, Golumbic, and Pinter in 1988. There exists {O}(n\\\\log n) algorithms for chromatic number, weighted independent set, clique cover, and maximum weighted clique. Figure 1: Trapezoid representation of graph G.  Definitions and characterizations  Given a channel, a pair of two horizontal lines, a trapezoid between these lines is defined by two points on the top and two points on the bottom line. A graph is a trapezoid graph if there exists a set of trapezoids corresponding to the vertices of the graph such that two vertices are joined by an edge if and only if the corresponding trapezoids intersect. The interval order dimension of a partially ordered set, P=(X, <), is the minimum number d of interval orders P1 ‚Ä¶ Pd such that P = P1‚à©‚Ä¶‚à©Pd. The incomparability graph of a partially ordered set P=(X, <) is the undirected graph G=(X, E) where x is adjacent to y in G if and only if x and y are incomparable in P. An undirected graph is a trapezoid graph if and only if it is the incomparability graph of a partial order having interval order dimension at most 2.Ido Dagan, Martin Charles Golumbic, and Ron Yair Pinter. Trapezoid graphs and their coloring. Discrete Appl. Math., 35‚Äì46, 1988.  Applications  The problems of finding maximum cliques and of coloring trapezoid graphs are connected to channel routing problems in VLSI design. Given some labeled terminals on the upper and lower side of a two-sided channel, terminals with the same label will be connected in a common net. This net can be represented by a trapezoid containing the rightmost terminals and leftmost terminals with the same label. Nets may be routed without intersection if and only if the corresponding trapezoids do not intersect. Therefore, the number of layers needed to route the nets without intersection is equal to the graph‚Äôs chromatic number.  Equivalent representations = Trapezoid representation  Trapezoids can be used to represent a trapezoid graph by using the definition of trapezoid graph. A trapezoid graph's trapezoid representation can be seen in Figure 1.  Box representation  Dominating rectangles, or box representation, maps the points on the lower of the two lines of the trapezoid representation as lying on the x-axis and that of the upper line as lying on the y-axis of the Euclidean plane. Each trapezoid then corresponds to an axis-parallel box in the plane. Using the notion of a dominance order (In RK, x is said to be dominated by y, denoted x < y, if xi is less than yi for i = 1, ‚Ä¶, k), we say that a box b dominates a box b‚Äô if the lower corner of b dominates the upper corner of b‚Äô. Furthermore, if one of two boxes dominates the other we say that they are comparable. Otherwise, they are incomparable. Thus, two trapezoids are disjoint exactly if their corresponding boxes are comparable. The box representation is useful because the associated dominance order allows sweep line algorithms to be used.Stefan Felsner, Rudolf Muller, and Lorenz Wernisch. Trapezoid graphs and generalizations, geometry and algorithms. In Algorithm theory‚ÄîSWAT ‚Äô94 (Aarhus, 1994), volume 824 of Lecture Notes in Comput. Sci., pages 143‚Äì154. Springer, Berlin, 1994.  Bitolerance graphs  Bitolerance graphs are incomparability graphs of a bitolerance order. An order is a bitolerance order if and only if there are intervals Ix and real numbers t1(x) and tr(x) assigned to each vertex x in such a way that x < y if and only if the overlap of Ix and Iy is less than both tr(x) and t1(y) and the center of Ix is less than the center of Iy.Kenneth P. Bogart, Garth Isaak. Proper and unit bitolerance orders and graphs. Discrete Mathematics 181(1‚Äì3): 37‚Äì51 (1998). In 1993, Langley showed that the bounded bitolerance graphs are equivalent to the class of trapezoid graphs.Martin Charles Golumbic and Irith B.-A. Hartman, eds., Graph Theory, Combinatorics and Algorithms: Interdisciplinary Applications, Springer-Verlag, New York, 2005  Relation to other families of graphs  The class of trapezoid graphs properly contains the union of interval and permutation graphs and is equivalent to the incomparability graphs of partially ordered sets having interval order dimension at most two. Permutation graphs can be seen as the special case of trapezoid graphs when every trapezoid has zero area. This occurs when both of the trapezoid‚Äôs points on the upper channel are in the same position and both points on the lower channel are in the same position. Like all incomparability graphs, trapezoid graphs are perfect.  Circle trapezoid graphs  Circle trapezoid graphs are a class of graphs proposed by Felsner et al. in 1993. They are a superclass of the trapezoid graph class, and also contain circle graphs and circular-arc graphs. A circle trapezoid is the region in a circle that lies between two non-crossing chords and a circle trapezoid graph is the intersection graph of families of circle trapezoids on a common circle. There is an O(n^2) algorithm for maximum weighted independent set problem and an {O}(n^2 \\\\log n) algorithm for the maximum weighted clique problem.  k-Trapezoid graphs  k-Trapezoid graphs are an extension of trapezoid graphs to higher dimension orders. They were first proposed by Felsner, and they rely on the definition of dominating boxes carrying over to higher dimensions in which a point x is represented by a vector ( x_1, \\\\ldots , x_k ). Using (k ‚àí 1)-dimensional range trees to store and query coordinates, Felsner‚Äôs algorithms for chromatic number, maximum clique, and maximum independent set can be applied to k-trapezoid graphs in {O}(n \\\\log^{k-1}n) time.  Algorithms  Algorithms for trapezoid graphs should be compared with algorithms for general co-comparability graphs. For this larger class of graphs, the maximum independent set and the minimum clique cover problem can be solved in {O}(n^2\\\\log n) time.R. McConnel and J. Spinrad, Linear-time modular decomposition and efficient transitive orientation of undirected graphs, Proc. 5. Ann. Symp. on Discr. Alg. (1994). Dagan et al. first proposed an {O}(nk) algorithm for coloring trapezoid graphs, where n is the number of nodes and k is the chromatic number of the graph. Later, using the box representation of trapezoid graphs, Felsner published {O}(n\\\\log n) algorithms for chromatic number, weighted independent set, clique cover, and maximum weighted clique. These algorithms all require {O}(n) space. These algorithms rely on the associated dominance in the box representation that allows sweeping line algorithms to be used. Felsner proposes using balanced trees that can do insert, delete, and query operations in {O}(\\\\log n) time, which results in {O}(n\\\\log n) algorithms.  Recognition  To determine if a graph {G} is a trapezoid graph, search for a transitive orientation {F} on the complement of {G}. Since trapezoid graphs are a subset of co-comparability graphs, if {G} is a trapezoid graph, its complement {G'} must be a comparability graph. If a transitive orientation {F} of the complement {G'} does not exist, {G} is not a trapezoid graph. If {F} does exist, test to see if the order given by {F} is a trapezoid order. The fastest algorithm for trapezoid order recognition was proposed by McConnell and Spinrad in 1994, with a running time of O(n^2). The process reduces the interval dimension 2 question to a problem of covering an associated bipartite graph by chain graphs (graphs with no induced 2K2).Golumbic, Martin Charles, and Ann N. Trenk. Tolerance Graphs. Cambridge [u.a.: Cambridge Univ., 2004. Using vertex splitting, the recognition problem for trapezoid graphs was shown by Mertzios and Corneil to succeed in O(n(n+m)) time, where m denotes the number of edges. This process involves augmenting a given graph {G}, and then transforming the augmented graph by replacing each of the original graph‚Äôs vertices by a pair of new vertices. This ‚Äúsplit graph‚Äù is a permutation graph with special properties if an only if {G} is a trapezoid graph.G. B. Mertzios and D. G. Corneil.

He was elected to the Senate for Borno South, Borno State, Nigeria in April 2011 running on the People's Democratic Party (PDP) ticket. He is currently a member of All Progressive Congress (APC). Early life and education Senator Mohammed Ali Ndume was born in Gwoza Town of Borno State. He attended Gadamayo Primary School in Gwoza and completed in 1972. He proceeded to Comprehensive Secondary School Mubi in then Gongola, now Adamawa State from 1973 to 1978 where he obtained his Secondary School Certificate and WASC. He was cut out early in life for Leadership position as he was appointed Junior House Captain and promoted to House Captain in his final year Secondary School. His exceptional superlative brilliance saw him emerging in constant First position in class at Comprehensive Secondary School Mubi. On completion of Secondary School he went on to Kaduna Polytechnic to study Marketing in 1978. He completed his Ordinary National Diploma (OND) in 1980 and Higher National Diploma (HND) in Marketing in 1982 with Upper Credit level. He proceeded to Federal Polytechnic Ilaro in Ogun State between 1982 ‚Äì 1983 for his compulsory National Youth Service Corps (NYSC). He joined the famous Ramat Polytechnic Maiduguri as a lecturer in 1983 rising to the rank of a Senior Lecturer. In 1988, he was awarded the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Post-Graduate Scholarship to study Business and Computer Education at the University of Toledo, Ohio, United States of America and graduated with a B.Ed and M.Ed in 1990 and was awarded Magna Cum Laude academic honour. He was also admitted into the Phi Kappa Phi academic society for outstanding performance. On graduation, he returned to Nigeria and continued with his teaching career with the Ramat Polytechnic Maiduguri, Borno State until 2003, when he fully involved in politics. ANPP politician In 2003, Ndume was elected to represent his people of Chibok/Damboa/Gwoza Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives on the platform of All Nigeria People Party (ANPP): a position he occupied from 2003 ‚Äì 2011. On the inauguration of the sixth (6th) Assembly in 2007, he was unanimously elected as the Minority Leader and served creditably. PDP politician In December 2010 barely 100 days to 2011 elections Ndume decamped to the PDP, citing the injustices going on in the party as his reason for leaving the ANPP. He said the people from the grassroots of Southern Borno were solidly behind him. He said that he was not being given a level playing ground in the competition with other ANPP aspirants for candidature in the Senate election. Apparently he had fallen out with Governor Ali Modu Sheriff. Ndume's defection to the PDP was seen as a major blow to the ANPP. He was said to have been the major financer and the back-bone of ANPP in the Borno-South senatorial zone, and was considered one of the most dynamic of the lawmakers from the northeast zone. Following Ndume's defection, the PDP re-opened the sale of nomination forms. Alhaji Sanda Garba, who had been the only aspirant for the South Borno Senate seat, stepped down to make way for Ndume as the PDP candidate. In the election, Ndume won 146,403 votes, ahead of Dr. Asaba Vilita Bashir of the ANPP with 133,734 votes and Alhaji Unaru Ibrahim of the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) with 20,414 votes. Ndume served as the Chairman of the Senate Committee on MDGs in the 7th Senate and remained vibrant and active in the political landscape. Senato. Ndume was removed from his position due to his closeness to the Presidency and support for Economic and Financial Crimes Commission [EFCC] Chairman nominee, Ibrahim magu. The leadership of the 8th Senate led by Bukola Saraki was in conflict with the executive arm throughout the 8th assembly. Senator Mohammed Ali Ndume is married to Justice Aisha and Hajia Maryam and blessed with 10 children. Achievements Senator Ndume has moved several Motions and sponsored many Bills in the Parliament, the Constituencies Development Fund Bill and Electoral Act Amendment Bill that enabled Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) voted in 2015 elections. Political alignments and re- alignments saw him forming PDP with 20 of his colleagues which eventually coalesced into APC, the present ruling party. He was re-elected in the 2015 Senatorial elections and became the Leader of the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in the 8th Assembly until 2017 when he was replaced with Ahmad Lawan.

The film stars Nassar, Revathi, Urvashi and Rohini. It revolves around three women deciding to gang up against their lecherous office boss who constantly harasses them. Haasan wrote a story inspired by the American film 9 to 5 (1980) which Mohan then expanded into the screenplay of Magalir Mattum. The film was Thirunavukarasu's first as an independent cinematographer, P. N. Satish worked as the editor, and the music was composed by Ilaiyaraaja while the lyrics were written by Vaali. Magalir Mattum was released on 25 February 1994 and became a commercial success, running for over 175 days in theatres. For her performance, Urvashi won the Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize for Best Actress. The film became a milestone in Tamil cinema for the topics it addresses such as workplace harassment and male gaze, and is regarded as an early example of the Me Too movement in India.  Plot  Janaki and Pappamma are two women employed at a fashion export company. Janaki works as a typist to support herself, her husband and their child as her husband lost his job in a factory. Pappamma is a housekeeper who lives with her drunkard rickshaw- puller husband and earns for both their living and her husband's drinking expense. Sathya, a computer graduate and designer, joins the fashion company as a fashion designer. All the women in the company face a common threat in the form of manager G. K. Pandian, a womaniser. He harasses his female employees in one way or another, but the women tolerate his torture due to their family circumstances. Pandian tries to move close with Sathya and unaware of Pandian's intention, Sathya at first dines with him. This isolates her from other employees. Pandian tries to impress her by presenting a silk saree, but Sathya rebukes him by saying what he has done is harassive. This gains her the friendship of Janaki and Pappamma and Sathya understands about Pandian. Due to Sathya's friendship, Janaki becomes bold enough to face her supervisor Madhavi and insults her in front of everyone. Hence, Madhavi takes revenge by hiding an important file which is under Janaki's custody. But Pappamma helps her by revealing the truth to Pandian. The three women are frustrated by Pandian's attitude and seek to end his misdeeds towards them. Janaki unknowingly mixes rat poison in Pandian's coffee instead of sugar and gives it to him. Pandian falls from his chair and becomes unconscious. Sathya finds and admits him in hospital. Janaki realises that she mixed rat poison in the coffee, thinks Pandian drank it and reveals this to her friends. All three rush to the hospital and hear that a patient is dead due to strong dosage of poison, not knowing that it is a terrorist who died by drinking cyanide, that Pandian actually fainted due to a minor injury and has recovered. They kidnap the covered corpse and take it to Sathya's room only to find that they have kidnapped the terrorist's corpse. Hence they decide to return it to the hospital; the police recover the corpse and the trio leave silently. Pandian returns to work; on learning of what happened, he blackmails the trio into spending each night with him in his house, or else he will report them to the police. The trio appear to assent, but once there, they trap him. Sathya takes charge of acting manager and with the help of Janaki, Pappamma and other employees, brings many changes in the office. Sathya soon receives information from the head office about the boss's visit and gets tensed as Pandian is kidnapped. The trio decide to confess about what happened in the office and rush to the airport to receive the boss who they have never seen. Madhavi overhears them and rescues Pandian. Once at the airport, the trio miss the boss, who leaves with Pandian. The trio chase them to the office. In the office, the boss finds differences and Pandian says that he is not responsible for them, only the trio are. But the boss reveals he is aware of the happenings there (thanks to his informer who was pretending to be deaf) and appreciates the trio for their innovative ideas. He decides to leave charge of the office to them and transfers Pandian to Andaman, gives remedy for Janaki's husband's job in his friend's factory and Pappamma's husband's job as watchman in their school. When he inquires about Sathya's marriage, Janaki says that she has a dream boy drawn in the computer. Sathya shows her dream boy to him and all are surprised that Sathya's dream boy is their boss. The boss asks Sathya to marry him, and she accepts his proposal.  Cast  * Nassar as G. K.

Vasanthakumari as the bus driver * Kamal Haasan as the office boss * Renuka as Pandian's wife (uncredited)  Production = Development  After being inspired by the American film 9 to 5 (1980), Kamal Haasan wrote a story, narrated it to Crazy Mohan and asked him to develop it into a screenplay. Haasan was not sure \\"if we could turn it into a two-hour film\\", so a subplot featuring a terrorist's corpse was one of the things Mohan included to expand the screenplay. This subplot was inspired by a play of Mohan's, in which his troupe member Ramesh acted as a dead body, and a real incident when a body washed ashore at a coastal area in Andhra Pradesh where Haasan was filming for Swathi Muthyam (1988). Mohan's wife wrote the screenplay while he was explaining every scene. The title Magalir Mattum, which translates to \\"Ladies Only\\" had been suggested by Mohan because buses carrying this text \\"were quite popular then and people would instantly connect to the subject of the film.\\" Singeetam Srinivasa Rao was hired to direct, while Haasan produced the film under his banner Raaj Kamal Films International. Haasan wanted P. C. Sreeram to be the cinematographer, but since he was busy with Thiruda Thiruda (1993), his assistant Thirunavukarasu, who later became known as Tirru, was recruited instead. The film was Thirunavukarasu's first as an independent cinematographer; he previously assisted Sreeram in Haasan's Thevar Magan (1992). Thirunavukarasu has stated that Rao \\"almost summarily dismissed\\" him because he did not generally work with novices, \\"but I was able to prove my technical worth in the opening shots, with a lot of help from Kamal, who had immense faith in my capabilities\\". Velraj worked as an assistant cinematographer in the film. P. N. Satish worked as the editor, and Haasan's then-wife Sarika designed the costumes.  Casting  For the three female leads, Rao wanted actresses who were good friends in real life, so he cast Revathi, Urvashi, and Rohini. He also noted \\"When we were doing their combination scenes there was so much life in it because they were friends.\\" Nassar was chosen to portray G. K. Pandian, his first humour oriented character. Mohan was initially apprehensive about casting Nassar in a comical role as he was known mainly for serious negative roles, but Haasan remained adamant. Rohini was offered to play the role of Pappamma, a de-glamorised servant; she recalled that she agreed to do it \\"without a second thought\\" and since she grew up in Chennai, she \\"didn't have to work on the slang\\". Urvashi recalled that Haasan asked her to \\"choose the one you'd be interested\\"; she liked Pappamma due to \\"rawness that stems from her family situation\\", but chose to act as Janaki because \\"she's a character that audiences relate to\\". Revathi was cast as Sathya; as with Rohini and Urvashi, she agreed to act in the film without second thoughts. Director Bharathiraja and poet Vairamuthu were initially approached for the character of office supervisor Thamizhavan; however producer Kalaipuli S. Thanu appeared in that role, and Magalir Mattum was his only film as an actor. Haasan cast Nagesh as the corpse of the terrorist, and he himself appeared in a cameo as the office boss towards the climax. Though the character was originally written as a woman, the cast wanted Haasan in that role.  Filming  Magalir Mattum was launched in the first half of 1993. It was one of the few films launched during a period of a ban imposed on film production in Tamil Nadu by distributors' associations. The set of the office was established on the second floor of a building that was being constructed at the then Vauhini Studios. While filming the scene where the corpse is being carried by the protagonists, Nagesh was asked by Rao to keep a smirk on his face throughout the sequence. Rao told him to let his body go totally limp; this proved difficult for both him and the three female leads, as they had to carry his entire weight. The stunt scene involving Nagesh was filmed on a set erected at Campa Cola. The team waited for three months to film the song \\"Karavai Maadu\\" as all three lead actresses had to be in it. It was ultimately decided to film the portions separately with Nassar depending upon the availability of actress on that day. Raghuram, who choreographed the song, completed it in such a way that \\"the shots could later be edited and made to look like they all shot together\\". The final length of the film was .  Themes  Magalir Mattum revolves around workplace harassment and male gaze. Writing for Sify, Sowmya Rajendran said the film addresses many issues that women employees face, such as \\"feminization of poverty, the problems of a middle-class, new mother who has to get back to work to make a living\\" and the \\"anger of a single, talented woman who has to keep her temper in check if she‚Äôs to retain her job\\". The protagonists ‚Äì Sathya, Janaki and Pappamma ‚Äì are representatives of three different classes of society. Urvashi has stated that the film's idea was to show that \\"women, irrespective of class difference, face the same problems in a patriarchal society.\\" She described Janaki as exhibiting \\"a typical middle-class mentality\\", Pappamma as her opposite who \\"carries a bold and brazen attitude\\", and Sathya as \\"an independent woman who's very precise about things\\".  Soundtrack  The soundtrack was composed by Ilaiyaraaja, while the lyrics for all the songs were written by Vaali. It was released under the label AVM Audio in December 1993. Ilaiyaraaja, using the technique of M. B. Sreenivasan, composed the title track as a choir song. Urvashi was initially displeased with \\"Karavai Maadu\\" because it contained lyrics she considered were degrading, but after Vaali explained to her why he wrote those words, she was convinced.  Release  Magalir Mattum was released on 25 February 1994. No distributor was willing to buy the film since it featured no romance or a hero; as a result, Haasan had to distribute it himself. Despite this, the film was a commercial success, running for over 175 days in theatres, and becoming a silver jubilee film. Urvashi attributed the film's success to the fact that it \\"told the sufferings through comedy\\", and may have been rejected by audiences if it was a serious film. For her performance, she won the Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize for Best Actress.  Reception  On 25 February 1994, Malini Mannath of The Indian Express called the film \\"a welcome breath of fresh air\\". She went on to praise Nassar's performance, saying that \\"his expressions are a treat to watch [..] he can do comedy too with ease\\". She also praised the performances of Revathi and Rohini and complimented Urvashi \\"with her sense of comedy who come out the best the humour and punchlines coming naturally\\". The review board of Ananda Vikatan said the filmmakers must be appreciated for presenting a high-class comedy entertainer without any vulgarity or double entendre dialogues and becoming a benchmark for humour. They said that among the three female leads, Urvashi had lived through the character of a Brahmin girl and made them laugh throughout the film. The review board praised the cinematography and wrote that the filmmakers certainly moved a few steps ahead in their effort to present a neat and entertaining comedy film, and gave Magalir Mattum a rating of 44 marks out of 100. On 12 March, K. Vijiyan of New Straits Times praised Haasan and Mohan's writing, the performances of the lead actors, and concluded, \\"Ladies, Kamalhassan has made this movie just for you. Make that man in your life tak you away for this one and he will probably also enjoy it too\\".  Other versions  Magalir Mattum was dubbed in Malayalam as Ladies Only, and in Telugu as Adavallaku Matrame. The film was remade in Hindi as Ladies Only in 1997 by Dinesh Shailendra. Seema Biswas, Shilpa Shirodkar and Heera Rajagopal were cast as the female leads and Randhir Kapoor was selected to reprise Nassar's character. Haasan produced the film and appeared as the corpse. Though the film was completed, it failed to have a theatrical release.  Legacy  Magalir Mattum attained cult status, and became a milestone in Tamil cinema for the topics it addresses, being regarded as an early example of the Me Too movement in India. Nassar's character of Pandian attained iconic status, and later became \\"the face of all memes and posts related to harassment at the workplace.\\"  References  Bibliography  * *  External links  * Category:1990s buddy comedy films Category:1990s satirical films Category:1990s Tamil-language films Category:1994 comedy films Category:1994 films Category:Films about sexual harassment Category:Films about women in India Category:Films directed by Singeetam Srinivasa Rao Category:Films with screenplays by Crazy Mohan Category:Indian buddy comedy films Category:Indian female buddy films Category:Indian feminist films Category:Indian films Category:Indian remakes of American films Category:Indian satirical films Category:Tamil film scores by Ilaiyaraaja Category:Tamil films remade in other languages Category:Workplace comedies ","title":"Magalir Mattum (1994 film)"},{"id":"31675642","text":"Peniel is a small village in Carmarthenshire, Wales.

This non- profit organization supports filmmakers through seed grants with fiscal sponsorship. The foundation is located in Westport, CT and has a staff of two and board of eleven members.  Background  Hartley Film Foundation, incorporated in 1971, was the vision of founder Elda E. Hartley. She had a long career in filmmaking. Elda married filmmaker Irving Hartley, with whom she partnered to make newsreels and travel films from the 1930s through the 1960s. Some of the images that now illustrate American history were shot by Irving Hartley, including the explosion of the Hindenburg zeppelin in 1937. He and Elda also produced a series of Pan Am travelogues, a prototype for travel shows on television today. Elda worked as North Carolina State‚Äôs Director of Visual Education and, in the 1930s, she helped found the Documentary Film Association, which exhibited at the first New York World's Fair. Elda's vision of the future foundation began in 1965, while on a vacation tour to Japan with Alan Watts. She decided to make a film on Zen and Alan Watts volunteered to narrate the film. At the age of fifty-six, Elda Hartley was on her way to producing documentary films on world religions and spirituality ‚Äìthe beginning of her third career. She completed films about the world's spiritual and religious traditions (including documentaries such as Requiem for a Faith and The Sufi Way),and collaborated with Margaret Mead, Joseph Campbell, Edgar Mitchell, Jean Houston, Ram Dass, Alan Watts, Huston Smith and Larry Dossey, among others. Hartley often said that the goal of her work was greater than simply making films, and so she founded the Hartley Film Foundation. She died on her 90th birthday, March 6, 2001. Hartley Film Foundation continues to honor her legacy through its support of established filmmakers who travel the world to document stories that further global and interfaith understanding. The Foundation strives to reach the widest possible audience with films such as Hiding and Seeking, A Jihad for Love, Love Free or Die, God's Next Army, Praying with Lior, Taking Root and Little White Lies. The non-profit foundation sells on its Web site those documentaries that fulfill Hartley's mission and message. Hartley sponsors the Full Frame Inspiration Award annually at the Full Frame Documentary Film Festival in Durham, NC. The foundation also provides audience outreach consultation support to its fiscal sponsees through Active Voice, communications specialists who use media as a catalyst for social change.

Keenan later escaped Claridge and lived on the streets, and at one point attempted suicide. Keenan later participated in an investigation into Claridge with journalist Sarah Macdonald. Macdonald stated that Keenan had \\"sent an explicit and disgusting tape recording of her father talking about abusing children to the police and social services - they did nothing.\\" For the investigation Keenan was sent into Claridge's house in an attempt to get him to talk about the sexual abuse.

It was a time during which literature and theatre flourished. During this era many new theatres and theatre schools were built. It was also during her reign when political reforms came into practice which led to the openness of theatre and literature. Theatre openly displayed and played dramas relating to social problems. Generally it was a period which brought prosperity to the middle class of England, and started to challenge the old hierarchical order of the country. A theatre in Victorian England The Victorian era is the era of the reign of Queen Victoria. During this period of time, theatre flourished. According to Allardyce Nicoll, author of History of Late Nineteenth Century Drama, during this time theatres became very popular with masses. Theatrical atmosphere was not particularly restricted to certain classes of the society. One of the main reasons of masses attending the theatre was the improvement in the transportation system. The streets became safer for travelling at night time, Nicoll observes, which prolonged timing for the theatre. Plays could run for a longer time now. This all led to greater profits and an increase in the number of theatres. With an increase in theatre resulting from the increase in the number of spectators, production of stage plays and drama proceeded to surpass the quantity of dramas produced in the past periods. According to Nicoll ‚ÄúWhen rail and omnibus became popular the whole of the area north, south and west of London was brought into the association with theatre‚Äù. As a result, the number of ticket buyers increased many fold. Typical audiences in those days were mostly the citizens from the lower section of the society, with some representation from the aristocracy. The great alteration, however, didn't come until the middle of the Victorian era. The greatest work done to improve theatre‚Äôs perception was done by none other than Queen Victoria. The Queen‚Äôs encouragements of the theatre not only pumped fresh air into the London theatre, but theatre was also understood as ‚Äúsomething destined to yield a rich harvest in the future‚Äù. The theatre The new audiences demanded new theatres to be built in both the metropolitan and provincial areas. It was also the need of the time to remodel the old theatres. ‚ÄúBetween 1860 to 1870 the Royalty, The Gaiety, The Charing Cross, The Globe, The Holborn, The Queen‚Äôs were remodelled. Later in the following decade of 1870 to 1880 The Court, The Opera Comique and The Imperial were built.‚Äù This brief list is proof of steadily increasing interest of the common public in the theatre. According to Allardyce, ‚Äúthere were nineteen theatres in London during the summer of 1851. Nearly half a century later, in 1899, London boasts sixty one theatres, thirty eight in the west end twenty-three in the nearby suburban districts.‚Äù Their significance as centers of entertainment was enormous. The stage of these theatres had a picture frame. The picture frame had a realistic feeling. With this picture frame effect, far more could be achieved scenically than had ever been dreamed of before. The old conventional devices clung tenaciously to the boards of the stage and blocked the development of new ideas for the theatre. In the eighties there was a definite improvement in the scenic design, and second the definite change in orientation from conventionalism to more naturalistic. It was also during this period stage managers were introduced. They were the modern directors and producers. Before, things related to theatre were very chaotic. There was a lot of confusion when it came to coordinating. Some managers tried to supervise but there was no serious attempt to establish proper coordination among so many workers working on stage and back stage. But now stage managers definitely had full control of the stage and all workers respected his authority. ‚Äú Murray Edinburgh was considered peculiar because he insisted upon every member of his company acting at the rehearsal exactly as they intended to do at night. He demanded decency and order and an ideal was set up for a unified realism in stage presentation.‚Äù audiences would be sectioned off, lower class in the front, upper class in the back and middle class in the middle Playwrights in the Victorian era Oscar Wilde is one of the most prominent playwrights of the Victorian era. ‚ÄúWilde‚Äôs easy wit insured an immediate success for the brilliant series of dramas that he wrote in the early nineties. In early 1892 Lady Windermere's Fan appeared at the St James' Theatre and was at once popular. The same year Wilde also wrote Salome. It was followed the next year by A Woman of No Importance. An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest, both filled with wit and brilliant paradoxes, appeared in 1895. They were the last things that Oscar Wilde was to write, before he developed meningitis, and suffered his untimely death.‚Äù Other plays include Vera; or, The Nihilists (1880), The Duchess of Padua (1883), A Florentine Tragedy (La Sainte Courtisane 1893). Wilde's work has inspired many other fellow writers. His work has been translated into many languages, and has been on the stage over and over again. Other important writers include John Millington Synge, whose plays include Riders to the Sea and The Playboy of the Western World (1907).. George Bernard Shaw was another famous playwright of the Victorian era. He wrote more than sixty plays. His plays were mostly about social problems such as education, religion, marriage, and class privileges. Arms and the Man and You Can Never Tell are his famous plays. Dion Boucicault was another famous playwright of the Victorian era. His famous plays include The Colleen Bawn, and The Shaughraun. See also *J. M.

Early life He was son of a tailor and army clothier in Cork Street, London, and originally from Kelso, and was born on 23 December 1797. He went to school at a private academy near London, and when sixteen years old at his own request was apprenticed to Savory & Moore, the chemists and druggists, in which he later purchased a partnership. He became a pupil at St George's Hospital, and entered the University of Edinburgh with the intention of becoming a doctor. His health failing, however, he went to Naples in the autumn of 1827. From Naples he went through Styria and Carniola to Vienna, made an excursion through Poland and Russia, and returned home by way of Hamburg. Traveller Davidson went to Egypt at the end of 1829, visited the Pyramids, and passed overland to Cosseir, where he embarked for India on his way to China and Persia. An attack of cholera, however, drove him back to Cosseir. He made an excursion through Arabia, and visited Palestine, Syria, the Greek Isles, Athens, and Constantinople. He collected geographical information, which he later communicated to in papers read to the Royal Society and the Royal Institution of London. In 1831 he went to America, visiting Niagara and the Canadas, New York, New Orleans, Tampico, and Mexico. He visited the Pyramids of Choluteca and took their measurement. Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1832 he settled down for a time to the study of Egyptology. On 13 July 1833 he delivered an address on embalming at the Royal Institution, when he unrolled a mummy for an audience. He undertook to head an African expedition, at his own expense, and proposed to proceed by way of Fez to T√¢fil√™lt, and then via the southern slope of Mount Atlas, to Nigritia, across the Sahara. He quit England in August 1835, bound for Timbuctoo. Going to Gibraltar he crossed into Morocco. His medical knowledge was appreciated by officials, and he had difficulty getting permission to depart. He started for the great desert at the end of November 1836, but while stopping at a watering-place called Swekeza he was robbed and murdered on 18 December 1836 by the tribe El Harib. After Davidson's death his brother printed privately a book, ‚ÄòNotes taken during Travels in Africa,‚Äô 1839, printed by J. L. Cox. The account of unrolling the mummy at the Royal Institution in 1833 was also published in pamphlet form. Many of his letters from Africa were addressed to the Duke of Sussex (Geog. Soc. Journ. vii. 151).

Sold into merchant service in 1946, she capsized and sank on 2 August following an explosion and fire at Haifa, Palestine. Description Empire Cross was built in 1945 by Sir J Laing & Sons Ltd, Sunderland. She was Yard Number 765. The ship was long, with a beam of . She was assessed at . The ship was propelled by a triple expansion steam engine. History Empire Cross was built for the MoWT. She was launched on 28 June 1945 and completed in November. The United Kingdom Official Number 181112 and Code Letters GKLF were allocated. She was operated under the management of the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Co Ltd, London. Empire Cross was completed in November 1945, by which time the MoWT had become the Ministry of Transport. She was sold in 1946 to the Anglo Saxon Petroleum Co, who intended to rename her Balea. On 2 August, Empire Cross exploded and caught fire while discharging aviation fuel in Haifa Roads, Palestine. and assisted in the rescue. The Admiralty discounted a theory that the explosion was caused by a depth charge dropped by a British destroyer in an anti-terrorist measure to prevent the fixing of limpet mines to ships. Captain John Banks, in charge of the Empire Cross at the time, was on the bridge and observed the activity on the two naval vessels indicating personnel were aware of frogmen in the water around them, which indeed was probably the Haganah attempting to attach limpet mines, and he noted the sound of depth charges being dropped into the harbour around the vessels. Twenty one of her crew of 56 were reported to be missing following the incident. Four other people were reported to have been killed. At the inquest, the page from the day's activities was missing from the log book of the suspect naval vessel, Virago. The crew were buried in Haifa. Captain Banks signalled to abandon ship when he saw the line go, and dived overboard, swimming under the flames until he lost consciousness, and was rescued by members of the Haganah. Empire Cross was scrapped in 1952. The noted correspondent Clare Hollingworth, at the time reporting from Palestine to the News of the World, asserted that the Empire Cross was indeed blown up by the Haganah. A few days later a spokesperson for the Haganah phoned the paper and hotly denied the charge, accusing Hollingworth of being \\"biased and motivated by hatred\\".Quoted in \\"The Prison Letters of Moshe Sharet\\" (in Hebrew) [ http://www.sharett.org.il/info/books/ayalon.pdf].

These patients can become lost for many reasons. Without properly informing the investigator associated with the clinical trial, they may have opted to withdraw from the clinical trial, moved away from the particular study site during the clinical trial, became ill and unable to communicate, are missing or are deceased.  Adverse effects  Patients who become lost to follow-up during a clinical research trial result in many negative effects on the outcome of the trial and on the pharmaceutical company sponsoring the clinical research trial. Patients who are lost-to-follow-up lead to incomplete study results, which in turn can put a bias on the result of the study as well as a bias on the investigational study medication. A lack of complete results leads to intensified FDA scrutiny of the particular study drug, as well as the pharmaceutical company sponsoring the clinical research study. Biased study outcomes also lead to issues of HIPAA standards and compliance. Aside from partial study data and regulatory issues, patients that are not retained due to being lost-to-follow-up can lead to problems with the progression of any clinical research study. Low rates of retention and high rates of patient‚Äôs lost-to-follow-up have many side- effects, including longer clinical research trial periods and more monetary expenditures because extra resources may need to be dedicated to the recruitment efforts.  Solutions  Currently there are no standards or guidelines that express the process or methods that can be used to attempt to reach patients who have become lost to follow-up. Only recently have government institutions like the FDA taken action over the recovery of or communication with patients lost-to-follow-up. Section 4.3.4 of the ICH E-6 Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guidance reads, \\"Although a subject is not obliged to give his/her reason(s) for withdrawing prematurely from a trial, the investigator should make a reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s), while fully respecting the subject's rights.\\" This excerpt expresses the need for physicians associated with clinical research trials to make a first-hand effort to contact patients who are lost-to-follow-up. In doing so pharmaceutical companies not only look out for the best interest of the patients who enroll in their clinical research trials, but also protect the data outcome of their clinical trials. It is important for patients, physicians associated with the study and regulatory departments, like the FDA, that more information is provided to the appropriate people whenever possible. The information should be provided by the patient but when that is not feasible it should be provided by the investigator. Proper ways of obtaining information from and about the patients must be developed and proper processes as to the handling of this information must be implemented in order to protect the patients and the integrity of the study outcome.

His first experience in fieldwork was an excavation of Gatecliff Rockshelter, a prehistoric site in central Nevada.Thomas, David & Kelly, Robert. \\"Archaeology\\" 4th Edition. 2006 Thompson Wadsworth. Since then, Kelly has been involved with archaeology and has dedicated the majority of his work to the ethnology, ethnography, and archaeology of foraging peoples, which include research on lithic technology, initial colonization of the New World, evolutionary ecology of hunter-gatherers, and archaeological method and theory. He has been involved in research projects throughout the United States and in Chile, where he studied the remains of the Inca as well as coastal shell middens, and Madagascar, where in order to learn about farmer-forager society, Kelly has participated in ethnoarchaeological research.2000 Lin Poyer and R.L. Kelly. Mystification of the Mikea: Constructions of Foraging Identity in Southwest Madagascar. Journal of Anthropological Research 56: 163-185 A majority of his work has been carried out in the Great Basin, but after moving to Wyoming in 1997 he has shifted his research to the rockshelters in the southwest Wyoming and the Bighorn Mountains. Outside of his research in archaeology, Bob Kelly also promotes tourism to historic and archaeological sites in Wyoming. In doing so, he has given many lectures around Wyoming and helped create a website to promote Wyoming‚Äôs heritage. The website, funded by the Wyoming Cultural Trust Fund and maintained by the University of Wyoming Department of Anthropology, acts as a directory for information about Wyoming Prehistoric and Historic Sites.http://www.wyomingheritage.org/index.html Kelly also served as an Amicus Curiae in the Kennewick case.. He has served as President of the Society for American Archaeology from 2001 to 2003. He is running a major research project in Glacier National Park to examine the effects of climate change.  Personal information  Kelly was born on March 16, 1957 in Connecticut. From a very young age, he wanted to move west. Kelly has two sons, Dycus and Matthew. Kelly enjoys skiing, playing piano, and traveling when time permits. When teaching, his goal is to show the students the process of archaeology and how much scraps of bone or broken stone tools can teach us.  Background  Kelly attended Cornell University where he received his BA in Anthropology in 1978. After graduating from Cornell, he moved west to continue his studies at the University of New Mexico where he received his MA in 1980. Much of his work and research was centered on the Great Basin and he spent over a decade working on sites and projects in Nevada. In 1985, he earned his doctorate from the University of Michigan with a dissertation on mobility and sedentism of hunter- gatherers.http://www.uwyo.edu/anthropology/_files/docs/VITA%20RLKELLY_June2010.pdf His fieldwork has been conducted in the Great Basin, the Southwestern United States, Chile, and Madagascar. He has authored over 100 publications. He and David Hurst Thomas have written an introductory textbook titled Archaeology that is widely used in many colleges and universities. Kelly‚Äôs book The Foraging Spectrum: Diversity in Hunter-Gatherer Lifeways, published in 1995, is considered to be a landmark in anthropology. In the book, Kelly points out that lifeways among foraging societies were quite diverse.  Employment history  After receiving his PhD from the University of Michigan in 1985, Kelly became a lecturer at Colby College in Maine. From 1986 to 1997, he was the coordinator of the Archaeology program at the University of Louisville in Kentucky. During his tenure there, Kelly served as head of the Anthropology Department from 1992 to 1997, as well as Chair of the College or Arts and Sciences Social Science Division from 1996 to 1997. From 1997 to present, Kelly has been a professor in anthropology at the University of Wyoming, where he served as head from 2005 to 2008. Kelly served as secretary for the Archaeology Division of the American Anthropological Association from 1996 to 1998. From 1998 to 2001, he acted as secretary for the Great Basin Anthropological Association. In 2001, Kelly was elected president of the Society for American Archaeology (SAA). He also serves on the editorial boards for the journals American Antiquity,http://www.saa.org/AbouttheSociety/Publications/AmericanAntiquity/tabid/124/Default.aspx Research Handbooks in Archaeology of the World Archaeological Congress, and the on-line journal Before Farming.  Awards and honors  In 1988 Kelly received the Weatherhead Fellow Award at the School of American Research in Santa Fe, New Mexico. In the same year, he received the President‚Äôs Young Investigator Award for Excellence in Research and Scholarship at the University of Louisville. In 1993, he received the Metrouniversity Outstanding Adult Educator of the Year Award and the Faculty Award for teaching effectiveness from the Latin American Student Association. He has been invited to speak at many universities all over the world, and was the William Lipe Visiting Scholar at Washington State University in 2007.  Key excavations  Kelly has led or assisted in numerous field projects and site excavations. These projects include assisting Robert Bettinger survey in the central Sierra Nevada in 1978; supervising the excavation at Triple-T Rockshelter, Nevada directed by David H. Thomas in 1976; directing the Carson-Stillwater Archaeological Project in Nevada from 1980‚Äì1981, 1986, and 1987‚Äìpresent; co- directing with Margaret Nelson at the Black Range Archaeological Project, Southwest New Mexico in 1988-1989; leading the test excavation of Mustang Rockshelter, Nevada in 1990; leading the Pine Springs reinvestigation of Southwestern Wyoming in 1998 and 2000; leading the investigation of Early Holocene/Late Pleistocene geology and archaeology of the Bighorn Mountains from 2001 to the present; and leading a research and excavation project in Glacier National Park in attempt to collect archaeological and paleoecological data related climate change.  Research emphasis  Kelly has shaped and contributed much to our understanding of hunter-gatherer societies. He has a deep interest in Western North American archaeology, especially in the Great Basin area. Current understanding of hunter-gatherer mobility and foraging patterns are also influenced strongly by his research, fieldwork, and ethnology. By examining the Pleistocene colonization of the Americas by examining artifacts and lithic technology, Kelly reconstructs past life-ways and compares them to current foraging societies, and examines human adaptation to climate change during different periods in the past. Kelly is also interested in improving and fine-tuning archaeological practice.. He has successfully challenged the preconceived notions of what it means to be hunter-gatherer through his research with the ethnographic record. Kelly is also interested in preserving the rights of indigenous peoples as affected by legislation like NAGPRA. Kelly‚Äôs research is focused on the Pleistocene colonization of the Americas as well as the effects of climate change to human cultural and behavioral adaptations. Kelly is also conducting fieldwork and research on why so few fluted points are found in caves and rockshelters.  Selected books and monographs  *Doing Archaeology (Robert L. Kelly and David H.

Surfline.com is now ranked 1,180 in the US and 5,784 in the world in terms of popularity compared to other websites and is now the largest provider of streaming HD coastal cams. Since 2003 it has taken on buoyweather.com and fishtrack.com (2012), on average the family of websites receives 175,000 visitors per day. The site includes streaming video, surf reports and forecasts. Surfline.com offers streaming cameras at 150 surf breaks, and is one of the larger surf cam websites.Corey Kilgannon, New York Times, 01/27/2008, \\"Cameras Show if Surf Is Good, but Surfers Are Getting in Way \\", Retrieved 05/04/2011 Surfline currently has approximately 50 employees.Apple Business Profiles, 2010, \\"Surfline: Catching waves in the palm of the hand.\\", Retrieved 05/04/2011  History  Surfline was founded in 1985 as a pay-per- call telephone surf report by Southern California surfer Jerry Arnold in partnership with David Wilk and Craig Masuoka, who had founded the Pro Beach Volleyball Tour. Over 50 surfers were employed to relay dawn surf conditions from their local surf breaks to a central office in Huntington Beach, California, where a special phone system made the reports available to callers for 50 cents each. The telephone number, 976-SURF, became well known in the surfing world. The company received 6,000 calls per day in its first month and grew from there. Surfline's offerings expanded throughout Southern California to Northern California and then into Florida and Texas. A key feature of Surfline's offerings was a daily surf forecast prepared by Sean Collins, a young surfer and sailor who pioneered the art of surf forecasting. Collins' ability to correctly predict the arrival of new swells made a significant impact on surfing. In 1991 Collins bought out Wilk and Masuoka to become a full partner in Surfline and two years later he bought out Arnold to own it outright. Collins interest in surf forecasting developed out of his own desire for more accurate long-range surf forecasts for Southern California and the Baja California peninsula.Damien Hobgood, ESPN, 08/13/2009, \\"The Man Behind The Weather Map\\", Retrieved 05/04/2011 The company started as a call-in service, which provided verbal condition reports for various surf breaks around Southern California.Marc Lacey, Los Angeles Times, 12/26/1991, \\"Riding a Wave of Success\\", Retrieved 05/04/2011 In 1995 Surfline became an online service, offering live video streams of surf breaks in addition to written surf reports.Joe Haakenson, Costa Mesa Daily Pilot, 04/20/2011, \\"Before There was Surfline, There were Landlines\\", Retrieved 05/04/2011 Surfline.com was bought up by Swell, Hardcloud and Bluetorch with the hopes of being a ‚Äúcategory killer.‚Äù They went to Surfer and Surfing magazines to seek out editors, designers, photographers and management. More surfers were becoming more comfortable with going online and Surfline.com was taking advantage of their success by gaining large amounts of money from venture capitalist. The company used that money to improve their data gathering and processing along with surf cams. Impacts on Surf Culture The introduction of Surfline.com and the increase in reliance on the real time footage has changed surfers' lifestyles. With the advances in the technologies and ability to predict the surfing conditions at various spots it has given surfers the ability to make future plans and make decisions about where to surf or if its worth it to go anywhere. It used to be that surfers relied on word of mouth, seasonal tendencies or tides to know what the surf was going to be like. Some would take days off from work based on this unreliable information and then be disappointed when there were no waves that day or there would be days where the surf was ideal and surfers would miss it altogether. Surfer magazine‚Äôs editor Brendon Thomas has said in response to this shift, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying that‚Äôs necessarily a good thing, but it‚Äôs true.‚Äù Another aspect of Surf Culture that is seeing some controversy is dealing with new crowds. There is a strong ‚ÄúLocals Only‚Äù mentality in different surf spots around the world. Surfers have blamed Surfline.com and live surf reporting as a contributor to the increase of crowds at surf breaks. The locals were so upset that there was suspicion that some of the surfers in New Jersey even planned to get back by hiding and/or breaking the camera.

Much like Time-Life's other series chronicling popular music, volumes in the \\"Guitar Rock\\" series covered a specific time period, including two-year spans in some volumes and different parts of the decade (for instance, the early 1970s) in others. Each volume was issued on a compact disc or cassette. Except for two prototype volumes that preceded the series proper (where two CDs or two cassettes were issued in those particular volumes), individual volumes generally contained 18 tracks (this varied by one or two tracks per album), and represented the highlighted time period's most popular and noteworthy tracks. Also included was a booklet, containing liner notes written by some of the most respected historians of the genre, photographs of the artists, and information on the songs (writers, performers and peak position on Billboard magazine's Hot 100 and/or Album Rock Tracks charts). History \\"Guitar Rock\\" was first issued in 1993, although two \\"prototype\\" volumes that are considered to be part of the series were issued beforehand. Those albums were titled Guitar Rock (issued as a two-CD set in 1990) and Guitar Rock Monsters (1992, also as a two-CD set). The original Guitar Rock volume was the only one known to be available as a vinyl album. The first volume in the series proper was issued in the summer of 1993 and titled Guitar Rock: 1974-1975. As was the case with Time-Life's other series, \\"Guitar Rock\\" was advertised in television and magazine advertisements. The series was available by subscription (by calling a 1-800 number); those who purchased the series in that fashion received a new volume roughly every other month (on the format of their choice), and had the option of keeping the volumes they wanted. Each volume was also offered for individual sale. When the series was fully issued, a customer could purchase the entire series at once (or a group of albums, as packaged by Time-Life as part of a promotion), often at a discounted price. New volumes continued to be issued through 1996, the final one being a volume covering rock from the first half of the 1990s. Two additional volumes, spotlighting power ballads and edgier pop music of the 1980s, were released in 1999. Time-Life continued to offer \\"Guitar Rock\\" through the mid-2000s (decade), after which it was replaced by other series. The series As with many of Time-Life Records' multi-volume releases, the volumes were not issued in a logical, sequential order by date or era of the subject; that is, issuing volumes covering the 1960s before progressing to the 1970s. In the track information section, the volumes will be listed sequentially by era; the following list is the order in which the volumes were released. 1993 * Guitar Rock: 1974-1975 #\\"The Loco-Motion\\" - Grand Funk Railroad #\\"Slow Ride\\" - Foghat #\\"You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet\\" - Bachman‚ÄìTurner Overdrive #\\"Radar Love\\" - Golden Earring #\\"Love Hurts\\" - Nazareth #\\"I'm on Fire\\" - Dwight Twilley Band #\\"Must of Got Lost\\" - The J.

While the aqueduct is of Roman origin, the present structure built by the Ottomans in the 16th century. A Byzantine barrier wall of the early 14th century, built as part of the fortifications on the Acropolis of Kavala, probably also functioned as an aqueduct. If so, it would have been a rare example of a Byzantine aqueduct, since Byzantine cities more typically used wells and cisterns rather than either maintaining existing Roman aqueducts or building new ones. The barrier wall was replaced with the present arched aqueduct during Suleiman the Magnificent's repair and improvement of the Byzantine fortifications. Some authors date that construction to the time of the 1522 Siege of Rhodes, but a more likely date is between 1530 and 1536. As late as 1911, it was still being used to supply the city with drinking water from Mount Pangaeus.

It lies on the south bank of the River Wye, which here forms the border between Wales and England. Through the village runs the B4350 which is the main road. The civil parish also includes the hamlets of Priory Wood and Hardwicke. There has been a fluctuation in population, the graph shows that the population was higher in the 2001 census, stating there was a population of 530.ONS: Neighbourhood Statistics 2001 Newton Tump is the remains of a motte and bailey castle 3 miles southeast of the village. In the 1870s, Clifford was described as: :\\"The village stands on the river Wye, adjacent to the Hereford and Brecon railway, 2 miles NNE of Hay; and has a post office under Hereford. The parish includes also part of Vowmine township. Acres, 6, 522. Real property, ¬£6, 209. Pop., 895. Houses, 207. A castle was built here by W. Fitzosborne; became the seat of the Cliffords of Ugbrooke; and was the birthplace of Jane de Clifford, \\"Fair Rosamond, \\" the favourite of Henry II.\\" The Village has a parish church which is dedicated to St. Mary. The church is made up of an ancient structure in a Norman style, and there are several monuments within the church. Adventure and romance novelist Rafael Sabatini, whose works include Captain Blood, The Sea Hawk and Scaramouche, several of which were adapted to movies, lived in Clifford from 1931.  Population  A graph to show the total population change in Clifford between 1801‚Äì2011 as reported by the Census of population. The population graph shows an increase in population up until 1840 when the population of Clifford began to decrease. The movement of people away from rural areas in the early 19th century was due to technical advances and socio-economic changes leading to urban areas becoming more densely populated. The technical advances meant that fewer people were needed in the agricultural industry, and this allowed people to move into towns and cities and begin to work for the labour industry. Therefore, this continuous decrease in population resulted in an overall net decrease from 1801 to 2011. Neighbourhood statistics show that from 2001 and 2011 there has been an overall decrease in population from 530 to 511 people, although statistics show that there has been an increase in the ageing population from 287 people aged over 45 in 2001 to 296 people aged over 45 in 2011.  Clifford castle  Clifford Castle The ruins of the Norman castle of Clifford Castle are in the village. Clifford Castle is a \\"traditional motte and bailey castle\\" which stands next to the River Wye on the border between England and Wales, it \\"covers an area in excess of 4 acres\\". The castle was founded by Earl William Fitz Osbern between the time of his being made Earl of Heredford in 1066 and his death in 1071. \\"Clifford Castle is one of five castles mentioned in the Domesday Survey of 1086\\". The castle is situated alongside a steep drop to the River Wye close by to a ford, therefore \\"this gave the site its later name, the cliff by the ford or Clifford\\". Originally the castle was built to protect a settlement which was to be built around the same time as the castle, housing up to 200 families. This settlement was the village of Clifford although it is now only a small village.  Clifford primary school  Primary School in Clifford Clifford Primary School is a community school built in 1837 and situated in the rural area of Herefordshire, only 3 miles away from Hay-on-Wye as well as being close to the Black Mountains. The school's Ofsted report from 2012 states that there are 71 children in attendance of the school from the age of 4 years old to 11 years old (Year R to Year 6); this report was carried out on 10 October and received a 'good' status. The school is interested in being eco-friendly, and due to a large amount of recycling and re-using the school has been given the Eco Schools Green Flag Award.  Occupation  Occupation data classified into the 24 1881 'Orders', plus sex, A Vision of Britain through Time 1881 occupations The 1881 occupations graph shows that males dominated the workforce with the agricultural industry as well as many other types of jobs including 'workers in house, furniture and decorations' and 'workers in dress'. Although women are perceived not to have a working life, they still dominated the 'domestic services or offices' working sector with a small minority of women appearing in the general/local government and professional line of works. Occupations in Clifford, 2011 2011 occupations The 2011 Occupations graph shows a contrast in the types of jobs the villagers have. There is a significant increase in the number of professional and office based jobs that are distributed around the villagers. There is a significant lower number of agricultural jobs, which may be due to the introduction of farming machinery meaning that there is less space for a large number of agricultural farmers. The traditional building skills company The company focuses on providing high quality training to individuals as well as construction companies in working with historic structures. The company works with \\"The Construction Industry Training Board, The Stone Federation, The Institute of Carpenters and The National Heritage Training Group\\" to help to provide the most high quality set of skills. The company offers a wide range of courses including stone-carving and woodcarving and the company has been running these courses now for three years.

Definition An employee's 401(k) plan is a retirement savings plan. The option of an employer matching program varies from company to company. It is not mandatory for a company to offer a contribution to their 401(k) plans. Many companies add to an employee's charity contribution. Through a corporate matching gift program, a company can double or even triple an employee's contribution toward a charity. This should not be confused with an employer matching program. \\"100% of the first 6%\\" As of 2013, the most common matching program increased to 100% of the first 6%. This program states that once the employee contributes 6% of their gross pay, the employer's contributions stop until the following year. If the employee contributes less than 6% of their gross income, the employee foregoes additional compensation from the employer available to them had they contributed up to the 6% limit. For example, an employee whose annual gross pay is $50,000 contributes $3,000 (6% of gross pay) would receive a $3,000 employer contribution. If the employee contributed more than $3,000 the employee would not receive additional employer contributions. If the employee only contributed $2,000 (4% of gross pay), they would only receive a $2,000 employer contribution leaving $1,000 of potential employer contribution on the table. Functions In a 401(k) plan, the contributions are funded by the employee and are often matched by contributions from the employer. The contributions to an employee's 401(k) plan are made from the employee's salary before taxes. These funds grow tax-free until they are withdrawn; at that point the contributions can be converted into an Individual Retirement Account. The funds may also be switched if one changes employers. An employer's matching program is situational and depends on if a workplace offers one. According to the Profit Sharing/401k Council of America, an industry trade group, about 78% of 401(k) plans include some kind of employer match for employee contributions. In an employer matching program, an employee will typically only receive a contribution from an employer if an employee makes a contribution of their own (e.g., an employer will only match contributions if the employee makes some contribution). Employer matches vary from company to company. The general contribution from an employer is usually 3% to 6% of an employee's pay. For employees to receive a contribution from their employer, the employee must contribute a specified percentage into a 401(k) plan. The employer will then match that contribution to the retirement plan being offered. The money that is put into the retirement plan is free. Investing in a 401(k) plan is a great way to increase retirement savings and increase the money earned. In a traditional retirement account, the amount one contributes is taken before taxes. On the other hand, a Roth retirement account allows employees to contribute after taxes, with the benefits being withdrawn tax-free in retirement. Usually, employers will specify a vesting period, which is the minimum amount of time an employee must work to claim the employer-matched contributions. Regardless of how or when an employee stops employment, the money that an employee invests in their 401(k) plan is retained by the employee. The contributions made by an employer may or may not be retained based on the vesting program. To understand this better, a vested employee is one that has worked in a company for a specified amount of time. The employer determines the length of time required to become vested; this is usually a one- to five-year span. A vested employee then becomes eligible to retain all retirement contributions made by an employer. After an employee is fully vested, the employee is eligible to retain the entire amount contributed by their employer, even if they leave the company before retirement. Under federal law an employer can take back all or part of the matching money they put into an employee's account if the worker fails to stay on the job for the vesting period. Employer matching programs would not exist without 401(k) plans. The Revenue Act of 1978 included a provision that became Internal Revenue Code. Under this act the employees are not taxed on the portion of income they agree to receive as deferred compensation rather than direct cash payment. A 401(k) plan is a long-term money management plan. Nearly two-thirds of plans provide employer matching contributions today. Most common is a dollar-for-dollar up to a specific agreed percentage of pay which is commonly up to 6% of yearly income. The employer matching program is any potential additional payment to an employee's 401(k) plan. The employer is not responsible to contribute any specific amount to the employee; each agreement is situational according to the workplace. Since the start of a credit crisis and the 2008 recession, companies are either stopping matching programs or making the match available to employees based on whether or not the company makes money. In this stage of the economy, with many companies rethinking matching programs. If an employee is lucky enough to establish an employer contribution toward their 401(k) plan, this employer match (or free money) is the biggest benefit of a 401(k) plan given that the future of the economy is unpredictable. Cons of 401(k) plan * The lack of diversity in investment choices offered by many 401(k) providers * lack of security of employee's contributions * high expenses due to the expenses built into a 401(k) plan These are all concerning issues in a 401(k) plan. Lawmakers failed to structure laws around financial institutions that support them, so that the 401(k) is a secure retirement. Pros of 401(k) plan and employer matching program The employer matching program and the tax deduction are great advantages to a 401(k) plan; these two alone keep many employees invested. Economically 401(k) plans are good because it incentivizes Americans to invest in anything they want and build their wealth with certain tax breaks. The contribution limits of the 2020 401(k) stated that the contribution limit is $19,500. If an employee reached the age of 50 by December 31, 2020, they could save an additional $6,500 in their 401(k), for a total savings of $26,000.

He was the son of the architect and sculptor Nicol√°s de Vergara el Viejo and Catalina de Colonia, and brother of Juan de Vergara. He was also the nephew of the master glassmakers Arnao de Vergara and Arnao de Flandes and grandson of Arnao of Flanders the Elder.  Works in the cathedral of Toledo  Still in his father's life, the council of the Toledo Cathedral of Toledo named him his sculptor in the year 1573. Together with his father, he performed the two bronze lecterns of the choir of the Cathedral, and when his father died two years later, he worked with his brother Juan de Vergara , to finish the stained glass windows of the cathedral, works that ended in 1580 . He was appointed twice as the master of the Cathedral, the second time in 1587, remaining in office until his death. He then began the works of the Chapel of the Tabernacle in Herrerian style and was responsible for the traces of the architectural complex of the Chapel of the Tabernacle, Reliquary, Sacristy and courtyard and house of the treasurer. He also made the window of the rosette of the door of the Lions and on the interior facade of the clock door the medallion of the Virgin of the Annunciation.

In addition, he wrote poetry and proverbs. Basic Biography Carlos Esparza was born in September 1828 of Pedro Esparza and Felicidad Villereal in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico, a town that was often involved in violence between the United States and Mexico during the Texas Revolution and the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Carlos Esparza was one of eight children, and was tutored at home, primarily by the family priest. Carlos Esparza was wed to Francisca Garcia on January 30, 1850. Francesca became his aid in his job as a ‚Äústrategist and spy‚Äù for Juan Cortina. After a life of activity as a member of Juan Cortina's guerrilla forces, and later as a local political leader, he died on September 28, 1885. Military career Carlos Esparza was a longtime friend and collaborator of Juan Cortina. With him, Esparza fought in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Fort Texas stood just across the Rio Grande from Matamoros. After months of preparations by both armies, during which the relations between the two sides were almost friendly, a siege was attempted by the Mexican Army in Matamoros on the American fort across the river. However, the siege was broken by American troops and the resulting battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de las Palmas, which Carlos Esparza fought in. Both battles were Mexican losses, and the Texas side of the Rio Grande was not reconquered. Carlos Esparza retired from the Mexican Army in 1848. However, when the revolutionary Jose Maria Jesus Carabajal sought to found his own country in Esparza's region of Mexico, with American troops, Esparza took up arms alongside Juan Cortina to defend the area. The forces met in Matamoras, Mexico in twelve days of guerilla warfare. Eventually Carabajal was forced across the border into Texas. Carlos Esparza also led forces to defend the region from Native American raids during the 1850s. (Carlos, 19). Native Americans remained a threat to settlers in the area through the 1870s. Esparza patronized Cortina by supplying arms, money and food to his army from 1860 to 1876, even after Esparza himself retired from fighting, and despite the fact that he and Cortina did not always agree on how to achieve their goals. Also, Esparza participated in Cortina's spying system. In 1859, Cortina made Esparza the head of his spy ring, despite the wishes of Esparza himself, who preferred the less active efforts of giving money and food to the cause. Esparza used the fashion of long hoop skirts for women to the advantage of the network, using female messengers to carry documents in their layers of hoops and petticoats. Cortina's armed efforts to gain political sway in southern Texas did not stop during the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865). In fact, the war was seen as an opportunity to take advantage of vulnerability. Esparza used the opportunity of the war for economic gain, selling foodstuffs across the border at high profits, possibly earning as high as $200 a day. Political career In 1873 Esparza was appointed special deputy inspector of hides and animals in Cameron County. His political power was originally given by Cortina to give Esparza access to the city's resources. Esparza used his semi-official status as a government member to further his social projects. Esparza believed in social reform and worked particularly to improve public health. On his farm all water was boiled and stored in clay jars so that the clay would absorb impurities. Esparza recommended swamps be drained to prevent mosquito breeding in an effort to circumvent malaria. At the time, the exact cause of the disease was unsure, but Esparza did prove correct. Esparza grew gardens of herbs for medical use to supply local hospitals. Carlos Esparza pushed for the removal of the children in his community from dangerous jobs, such as stocking the furnaces of steamboats, where many children were known to have suffocated or burned to death. He was successful in part due to the fact that if employers refused to reform, Esparza had Cortina's soldiers at his back to use as enforcers for his reform policies. Esparza also paid for an orphanage to be built under the care of the Oblate Fathers. Esparza wished to abolish prostitution, blaming it for the widespread venereal disease in the region. However, that was not possible, since ‚ÄúCortina depended on prostitution for tax revenues and for his capable spying system‚Äù. Cortina fell from power when he was captured by the troops of the new Mexican dictator Jos√© Diaz in 1876. At that time, Esparza became a local sheriff and began the work of keeping proper public records, which up until that time had been neglected. He fired corrupt officials and paid for the construction of a new courthouse. Later Years and Death Near the end of his life, dissolusioned with the world and in danger of being punished for his political and military activities under Cortina, Esparza became reclusive. He designed his farm so that it could be largely self-sufficient, able to supply the essentials of life by growing both food crops and cotton for clothing. After 1873, Esparza became partly paralytic, ‚Äúwithout full control of his arms‚Äù, due to an old war wound. Esparza died of a liver disease on September 28, 1885. Literary Works and Philosophy While Esparza did cooperate with local religious in matters of social reform, Esparza's personal philosophy was against organized religion. With the group who frequented his salons, Esparza believed in individualism that grew into social reform, focusing on the individual instead of Mexico's established Roman Catholicism. Esparza hosted salons at his home to encourage intellectual and cultural growth. Esparza wrote poetry, often about his own life experiences as a soldier. His poems reveal an aversion to violence that he felt even during his military and political career. In addition, Carlos Esparza was known for a writing number of proverbs. They include: ‚ÄúIf we were as industrious as the devil, we would be far ahead‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat is good literature today may be rubbish tomorrow‚Äù, and ‚ÄúMen and hurricanes are hard to predict,‚Äù.

Scribes has almost 2,700 members, including state and federal judges, practicing lawyers, law-school deans and professors, and legal editors. Since 2017, its executive office has been located in Chicago, Illinois at UIC John Marshall Law School (Chicago). From 2015 to 2017, it was located in Lubbock, Texas at Texas Tech University, and before that, it was located in Michigan at Western Michigan University Cooley Law School. The executive director is Philip Johnson.  Origin  Scribes was formed in 1951 by Arthur T. Vanderbilt, Chief Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court. That year he invited several like-minded lawyers to join him in creating an organization to assist those who would write about the law as well as to promote better legal writing. Membership was initially limited to members of the legal profession who had published at least one book or three articles on legal subjects; new members were required to be nominated by an existing member. Later, the eligibility requirement was reduced to one book or two articles, and nominations are no longer necessary.  Goals  As written in its Constitution, Scribes's goals are: # to foster a feeling of fraternity among those who write about the law, and especially among its members; # to create an interest in writing about the history, philosophy, and language of the law and about those who make, interpret, and enforce it; # to help and encourage people who write about the law; and # above all, to promote a clear, succinct, and forceful style in legal writing.

Garner  Book Award  Since 1961, Scribes has presented its annual Book Award for the best legal work published during the previous year. The Scribes Book-Award Committee reviews up to 40 submissions each year, and the award is presented at Scribes' annual meeting or CLE where the author usually speaks and signs copies of the book. A list of winners of the Scribes Book Award is posted on the Scribes website.http://www.scribes.org/#!book- award/ycdfw  Law-Review Award  Since 1987, Scribes has presented its annual Law-Review Award for the best student-written article published in a law review or law journal. Each year, the editors of every law review and law journal are encouraged to submit their best student-written note or comment. Volunteer legal-writing professors and attorneys review the submissions and nominate the finalists to the Scribes selection committee. The committee selects a winner, and the award is presented during the annual meeting of the National Conference of Law Reviews.  Brief-Writing Award  In 1996, Scribes began an annual Brief-Writing Award for the best student-written brief. Each year, any law student who won best brief in a regional or national moot-court competition may submit the brief to Scribes, which then honors the best of the best. As with the Law-Review Award, volunteer legal-writing professors review the articles and decide on the finalists. The Scribes committee selects a winner, who receives the award at Scribes's annual meeting or CLE.  National Order of Scribes  In 2007, Scribes created the National Order of Scribes to honor graduating law students who excel in legal writing. Each year, every law school that is an institutional member of Scribes may nominate law students to be inducted into the National Order of Scribes. As with other Scribes awards, a list of all honorees, past and present, appear on the Scribes website.  Programs & CLEs  Scribes has on several occasions participated in legal-writing programs at the American Bar Association's annual meetings. In 2007, Scribes participated in the annual meeting of the Association of American Law Schools in Washington, D.C., where it presented a panel discussion on \\"Jury Instructions in Plain English.\\" In 2008, Scribes teamed up with the New York City Bar Association's Legal History Committee to cosponsor a symposium on Abraham Lincoln's legal writing. Recently, Scribes has also made a point of speaking directly to law students about legal writing. Since 2006, institutional-member law schools have hosted Scribes's annual board meetings. In return, Scribes conducts legal-writing programs for the school's students. In 2016, Scribes began hosting annual CLEs for legal professionals. The first CLE was hosting at The John Marshall Law School in Chicago, Illinois. The second CLE was hosted in Houston, Texas.  Membership  Scribes had 41 members at its first meeting in the early 1950s. Today, membership has grown to almost 2,700 members, including state and federal judges, practicing lawyers, law-school deans and professors, and legal editors. Any member of the legal profession is eligible to join. In 1990, President Roy M. Mersky helped develop a new category of membership for law schools: institutional membership. Since then, 37 law schools have become institutional members. Once a law school becomes an institutional member, professors at those schools automatically become a Scribes member if they meet the other eligibility requirements. In the mid-2000s, institutional membership expanded to include appellate courts; once an appellate court becomes an institutional member, the judges on that court automatically become members of Scribes as well.

It is fairly large, averaging 14 to 22 mm in length. It is of the subfamily Gomphocerinae in the family Acrididae, the predominant family of grasshoppers. This species is present in most of Europe, in the eastern Palearctic realm, and in the Near East. It can be encountered from late July through mid- December, usually in dry or slightly moist habitats. The environments in which it typically resides include dry grassland on calcareous soils, sheltered valleys with scrub, and the open borders of forests. It feeds on grasses and various herbaceous plants. It is known for its distinctive courtship song and accompanying display. Physical characteristics Males range from 14 to 16 mm, while females range from 17 to 22 mm. The coloration is usually shades of brown, but features some grey, yellow, and red. The mature male has an abdomen tipped with orange-red. The female has similar coloration, but it is much less pronounced than in males. Some females are reddish purple. The club on the antenna is distinct, flattened, expanded, and apical, or at the tip. The pronotum features a central seam. The wings are present in both sexes. The forewings are longer in the males, where they reach just beyond the primary joint of the hind legs, than in the females, where they fall short of this joint. Habitat The rufous grasshopper is usually found in open land, particularly terrain such as meadows, pastures, and forest edges that feature tall grass. More specifically, it can often be found in chalk grassland. It has been found on southern slopes of the Alps up to approximately 8100 feet. It prefers warm environments of moisture levels ranging from dry to moist. Very common locations include regions of Europe, including Germany, Sweden, France, and the United Kingdom. In fact, it can be found across almost all of Europe and Asia, ranging from France to parts of Siberia and from Scandinavia to northern Germany. These adept climbers prefer to avoid remaining on the ground, and instead perch on plants in sunny, elevated areas. As such they tend to live near herbaceous, taller plants and only by short plants infrequently. One situation that illustrates this preference well was the outbreak of the myxomatosis virus in rabbits in Britain in the 1950s. The rabbit population became severely depleted. As rabbits have the effect of cropping grass short to eat it, this decrease in the population led to less cropped grass. Some wildlife, such as the large blue butterfly, suffered immensely because of their dependence on short grass, but other organisms, like the rufous grasshopper, prospered because the lack of rabbits led to an increase in long grass. Predators includes bats such as the greater mouse- eared bat. Diet Grasshoppers in general, including this species, are herbivorous and subsist mainly on grasses. Scientists have gained knowledge of the diet of G. rufus through the use of feces as a source of DNA. It has been documented to eat plants of the genus Bromus, the species Holcus lanatus, and the subfamily Pooideae, all within the family Poaceae. Poaceae is a family of flowering monocots whose members are referred to as true grasses. Pooideae includes lawn grasses and cereals such as wheat and barley. Bromus is composed of grasses called brome grasses or cheat grasses. Holcus lanatus, more commonly known as Yorkshire fog or velvet grass, is a species of perennial pasture grass noted for its hairy texture. The rufous grasshopper has also been known to sparingly eat other plants such as rushes. Life cycle Nymph Females lay eggs, usually five per egg packet, in semi-arid soil in the roots of grasses around autumn and winter. Nymphs hatch around late May, and adults appear beginning in late July. Development depends greatly on the temperature. Most are fully developed by the end of August. When autumn conditions are not too harsh, they are relatively tolerant of cold weather and adults may survive until early December. Despite this tolerance, they prefer warm weather and more individuals tend to survive through hotter summers than cooler summers. Courtship and mating=The song The process of courtship consists of identical ‚Äúcourtship units‚Äù, each of which end in sound and are repeated without cessation. A sequence of such units is termed a ‚Äúcourtship song‚Äù. A song usually consists of three subunits. The male begins by orienting himself close to his target female, and continues with a set of rhythmic movements of various body parts, including swiveling of the head, trembling of the palps, and other movement of the antennae and hind legs. The entire process may last up to 15 continuous minutes. The first subunit is composed of head-rolling of various speeds, and the second and the third subunits contain different types of leg stridulation. If the female is willing to copulate, she will respond with sound and permit him to mate. Other than the sound produced at the end of each courtship unit, this grasshopper produces sound when no female is present, and when a female is moving away from him. The song produced when no female is present, the ‚Äúordinary song‚Äù, is similar to that of the sound within the courtship song. All sound is produced via movement of the legs. When in the active state, the female may even be induced to sing and permit copulation by even the male's ordinary song. Also, this grasshopper may make ‚Äúpursuit sounds‚Äù if a female becomes near and then moves further away. Sound can be elicited via electrical stimulation. A study in which freely moving or partially restrained males were stimulated with sharpened wires and semi- microelectrodes caused the males to create the courtship song and the ordinary song, with most of the expected locomotion. This study found that the supraesophageal ganglion, or brain, controls songtype, and the sequence and coordination of courtship subunits. When induced by a stimulus, this stimulus overrode other behaviors, such as feeding or copulation. Rufous grasshopper males perform an unusually long courtship. Their song has a reductive effect on locomotor activity within passive-state females. The exact mechanisms are not known, although scientists hypothesize that it somehow causes a hormonal change within the females. The result is advantageous, as this lack of movement ensures that the female will remain nearby. The resultant improved chances of copulation allow mating and fertilization to occur approximately one to two days earlier than it would without such an enduring display. Ultimately, the female will lay one or two more sets of eggs during that mating period, since it is the first egg deposition that determines when the following eggs are deposited. Additionally, the male can ensure that the female does not mate with another male during this period, since she is always nearby, although this is not always preventable. He also is capable of attracting active-state females with his long courtship song. This technique likely changed from the more typical search strategy, in which male grasshoppers travel while making songs and responding to females. Searching males are at a disadvantage since males who display long courtship guard the passive females they have sung to, and the females return to a defensive state, in which they do not permit mating, after copulation, so there are fewer available females. The existence of females whose locomotor activity was reduced by the songs precipitated the evolution of the long courtship technique. The stages of female behavior: overview and pre-mating Female behavior toward males is composed of three stages, beginning after the imaginal molt, through which the grasshopper reaches the adult phase. Which courtship stage a female is in is affected by age and whether she has mated in the past. First, there is rejection of the males, which lasts approximately four days. In this stage, the males can do nothing to induce copulation. Second, there is the two-day phase of passive acceptance without singing. Third, the female actively attracts the male by singing, and those in this state, which lasts several days, permit immediate copulation after a short courtship or without it. It is hypothesized that this active state exists as a method for individuals in populations of low densities to have a chance to copulate. It may be difficult in these populations to encounter other individuals by chance, and sounds produced by the males and females makes it easier for them to find one another. After successful copulation, she returns to a defensive state and lays eggs. After egg-laying, she once again reaches a state of passive acceptance. If she fails to mate during this stage, she will lay eggs fertilized by the previous male and return to active attraction. The cycle continues as it did at the first time entering the active phase, and follows this sequence for the rest of the adult life. Pre-mating behaviors and the growth and development of the ovaries are controlled by the juvenile hormone-III, which is produced in the corpus allata. The production of this juvenile hormone fluctuates. Patterns of behavior are correlated with the increasing or decreasing rate of the concentration of this hormone. It is possible that the production by the corpus allata may be affected by nervous stimulation or inhibition of the glands. The hormone concentration within the hemolymph may be affected by esterases. Corpus allata activity is also affected by external factors, as it tends to be greater when mating and egg- laying are occurring, but much lower when they are prevented. When activity is lower, egg production is lower. Secondary defense Remating shortly after copulation is impossible for these grasshoppers. The act of copulation prompts a physiological and behavioral response in females termed ‚Äúsecondary defense‚Äù. During secondary defense, the female will respond to male attempts at copulation with strong, directed kicks of the hindlegs, which will deter the males and make forced mating impossible since the female may be almost twice as large as the male. This is advantageous for the male, as it protects his sperm from competition with other males before the pair's eggs are laid. This stage may last 3 to 4 days. This defense is usually induced through contact of the proteins of the liquid white secretions of the white secretory tubule 1 of a male's accessory glands with the female's spermathecal duct (the process of which forms a spermatophore). More specifically, this is caused by a pheromone which is spurred by one of these proteins, of size less than 90 kDa. It can also be triggered by eggs exerting pressure against the walls of the oviduct on the pathway to oviposition. It is hypothesized that the secretion stimulates a bristle field of contact chemoreceptors where the spermathecal duct enters the endbulb. In other words, this defensive behavior is caused by both chemical and mechanical means. In terms of the four different stages of female behavior toward males, after copulation the female returns to a defensive state in which she rejects all male advances. There are additional reasons for the inability to remate. The spermatophore actually blocks the spermathecal duct so that another spermatophore cannot physiologically be planted. Additionally, after mating is completed, the genitalia of the pair hook firmly together for 40 to 90 minutes due to the clasping reflex, which prevents other males from mating with the female before she reaches the defensive state. Other than the loss of sexual receptivity after a copulation, refusal to mate occurs during the juvenile stage, when the insect is not yet fully sexually mature. Female grasshoppers who have not yet copulated with a male and are in the defensive state are exhibiting ‚Äúprimary defense‚Äù. During this phase, the females also respond to males with strong kicks of the hindlegs, but more heavily rely on escaping and evading the male. Post- copulation After finishing the defensive state (which usually occurs after laying eggs if having previously copulated), the female enters the state of passive acceptance. This willingness appears to be due to ablation of a bristle field of contact receptors in the duck or denervation, or loss of nerve supply, to the spermatheca, or alternatively it is due to the severance of the ventral nerve cord. Sperm not used in fertilization of the eggs can be maintained in the spermathecal bulb, which connects to the duct. This creates sperm competition between the sperm of previous mates and more recent ones. Newly obtained sperm enters the bulb, pushing older sperm to the back, and remains near the exit. So newer sperm is used before the older sperm. So, the outcome of this sperm competition is essentially determined by the shape of the bulb.

His doctoral dissertation, supervised by Brian Stock, studied the transmission of a nexus of cosmological metaphors, first articulated by Greek Stoic philosophers, to classical and late antique Latin poets, and ultimately to Medieval Latin philosophers and poets of the twelfth century. After completing course-work in Toronto, he went to Cambridge in 1969 to have better access to manuscript depositories while completing his dissertation. The Ph.D. was awarded in 1971. Following a period as a Research Fellow in Cambridge supported by a Killam Senior Research Fellowship, he was appointed Lecturer in the Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic, University of Cambridge in 1974, thereafter progressing to be Reader in Insular Latin Literature (1988) and then, in 1991, Elrington and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon, a chair which he held until 1998.

Early life and service Wilfred Ernest Young was born in Bournemouth, England on 28 December 1891.Shores, et al., p. 391. He began his military service as a second lieutenant in the 3rd Battalion, Dorsetshire Regiment, on 30 June 1915. On 15 December, he was posted to No. 6 Squadron RAF.  World War I aerial service =First tour of duty On 13 June 1916, Young was seconded from the Dorsetshires to the Royal Flying Corps as an aerial observer flying officer. He was returned to Home Establishment in England on 12 August 1916. On 1 January 1917, Young was rewarded with a probationary promotion from second lieutenant to temporary captain when he was appointed a Flight Commander. This first tour of combat duty began on 5 June 1917 as a Spad pilot with 19 Squadron. He was credited with three victories during June and July 1917, sharing one with William Cairnes and two other pilots. On 1 July 1917, he was promoted from second lieutenant to lieutenant. On 22 July 1917, he was wounded in action. He would not return to duty until March 1918, when he was appointed Flight Commander in No. 74 Squadron RAF. Second tour of duty Young's second tour of combat duty, as a Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a pilot, was with \\"Mick\\" Mannock's 74 Squadron. Young would share a brace of victories with the highly esteemed Mannock during the former's run of eight wins with the squadron. Young's first win for 74 Squadron-his fourth overall-came on 12 April 1918 when he destroyed an enemy Albatros D.III west of Armenti√®res, France. By 9 July 1918, when he shared his last victory over Merris with his flight, he had totaled 11 wins. He had burned two Pfalz D.IIIs into ruins; he had also destroyed seven others, including two that were shared with Mannock, Andrew Kiddie, Harris George Clements, and five other pilots. Young had also shared in driving down two enemy reconnaissance planes down out of control. On 2 July 1918, just before his last victory, Young was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, which was gazetted on 3 August 1918. On 4 August 1918, Captain Young was appointed a temporary major while he was so employed. He was appointed to command No. 1 Squadron RAF. Post World War I On 1 April 1920, he relinquished his commission, keeping his honorary rank of lieutenant.

The formal name of the club is Skutsk√§rs IF/Bandyklubb. The team colours are green and yellow. History The club was formally founded in 1989, when the former Skutsk√§rs IF of 1915 was split in two, one club for bandy and one for association football. In the first year of bandy league system in Sweden, 1930‚Äì31, Skutsk√§r entered in Division 1 Norra together with AIK, Hammarby IF, IF Vesta, IFK R√§ttvik, IK Sirius, SK Tirfing, and V√§ster√•s SK and finished 3rd. Skutsk√§rs IF has become Swedish champions of bandy twice for men, in 1944 and in 1959, and once for women, in 2018. They still hold the attendance records for an outdoor final. In February 2000, the club was promoted to the Swedish top division, after being related in 1980. The club played in Allsvenskan, the second-level bandy league in Sweden, until 2012, when it was relegated to Division 1. It has managed to get promoted to Allsvenskan again in 2014, and will play there in the 2014‚Äì2015 season. However they're currently in the last place with zero points through 10 games. Some notable former players are Anders √ñstling and Magnus Muhr√©n.

Career Growing up in a small Houston suburb of Katy, Texas, Coon began her career in fashion as a model, after being approached by a model scout in a local shopping mall.

There, she studied Haute Couture Sewing and Tailoring. She furthered her education with an apprenticeship with designer Camilla St√¶rk. Coon launched her own line in the spring of 2010, which was noted for its ‚Äúinnovative geometric designs‚Äù, and with its play on ‚Äúmasculine/feminine duality.‚Äù Vogue Magazine described her work as ‚Äúpunk-with-a-hint-of-romance.‚Äù In 2011, Coon was chosen as a winner of the Ecco Domani Fashion Award in the Women's Design category. She was also honored in February 2011 by the W Hotel as one of \\"Fashion's Next Hits,\\" alongside other designers Frank Tell, Mara Hoffman, Michael Angel, and Tess Giberson.

On February 9, 1946, Sveshnikov, then a nineteen-year-old art school student at the Moscow Institute of Applied and Decorative Arts, went to buy kerosene in a nearby shop. On the way, he was arrested for participating in a terrorist group preparing an assassination attempt on Josef Stalin. One of the participants in this fabricated MGB accusation was the artist Lev Kropyvnytsky, with whom Sveshnikov studied at the Institute. Before his so- called trial, Sveshnikov spent a year in prison. Subjected to endless night interrogations, trips from the basements of Lubyanka to Lefortovo Prison and back, sleep deprivation, and jail overcrowding, inevitably brought Sveshnikov to the brink of physical and nervous exhaustion. After a year, he was sentenced to eight-years in maximum security labor camps.  Life  The way from Moscow to Ukhtizhemlag (in the Ukhta-Izhvesk region)‚Äîthrough many transit prisons‚Äîlasted more than a month. In the crowded Stolypin wagons, Sveshnikov met with officers of the Vlasov army, Soviet prisoners of war, bandits and other criminals, members of forbidden religious sects, as well as political prisoners, who like Sveshnikov were branded ‚Äúterrorists.‚Äù In Camp 15, one of many camps in the Gulag Archipelago, Sveshnikov spent about two and a half years. The prisoners at the camp were forced to work for ten to twelve hours a day in digging and laying gas pipelines, regardless of the freezing temperatures in winter which reached -40¬∞C (-40¬∞F) and regardless of the clouds of blood-sucking biting midges. He lasted about two years, after which he collapsed from extreme exhaustion and was written off as a \\"waste of production\\" in the camp hospital along with other \\"goners\\" doomed to die. Fortunateley, a friend of his family, geologist Nikolai Nikolaevich Tikhonovich, who had been in the camp in 1937, and at one time supervised the geological work in the Ukhtizhemlag system, retained some professional ties there and intervened on Sveshnikov‚Äôs behalf.http://index.org.ru/nb/2000/sveshnik.html Sometime in the fall of 1948, he was transferred to the Vetlosyan camp for \\"invalids\\" and was appointed night watchman at a woodworking factory. The nature of this position gave him an opportunity to produce a number of drawings in pencil and ink on paper that today comprise an important part of his oevre. In the night watchman's closet, secretly, at night, Sveshnikov began to paint. His proximity to a nearby painting workshop where three prisoners served the \\"aesthetic needs\\" of the camp, i.e., preparation of banners, poster design, and painting portraits of Stalin, allowed him to obtain some art materials. Sometimes ‚Äúclients‚Äù came to him, and on small pieces of paper he painted their portraits, which the prisoners then sent in letters to their relatives. In 1954 Sveshnikov was released. Following his release, Sveshnikov continued to work in the fantastic realism style that he had developed in the Siberian labor camps. Oddly and perhaps sarcastically, Sveshnikov recalled the camp years as a period of ‚Äúabsolute free creativity.‚Äù ‚ÄúI got my ration of bread and painted what I wanted. Nobody supervised me. Nobody showed any interest in me.‚Äù Despite the injustices done to him by the government and despite the fact that Sveshnikov is considered a powerful exponent of Soviet nonconformist art, the artist never perceived himself as a dissident. On the contrary, Sveshnikov‚Äôs work is largely personal and apolitical. As the artist once stated, ‚ÄúWhat I painted at home I did for myself... All of my works are dedicated to the grave.‚Äù Boris Sveshnikov's paintings have been exhibited at the Galerie Moscou-Petersburg in Paris (1979), The Mus√©e Russe in Exil in Montgeron, France (1979), the Museum of Soviet Unofficial Art in Exile in Jersey City (1981), the Cannon and Russell Rotundas on Capitol Hill (1983), the Meerbuscher Culture Center in Meerbusch, Germany (1984), the National Museum of Modern Art in Paris (1988), and Mimi Ferzt Gallery in New York City (1999). Some of Boris Sveshnikov's most important works are found in the Norton and Nancy Dodge Collection of Nonconformist Art from the Soviet Union, currently housed in the Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University.

The 1878 St. Croix labor riot, locally also known as Fireburn, was a labor riot on Saint Croix, one of the Virgin Islands, then part of the Danish West Indies. The revolt started on October 1, 1878 and was suppressed after several days of looting and burning. Among the leaders were several women ‚Äì \\"Queen Mary\\" Thomas, \\"Queen Agnes\\" Salomon, and \\"Queen Mathilda\\" McBean ‚Äì who became known as \\"Queens of the Fireburn\\". Events leading up to the riot In July 1848, the slaves of Danish West Indies staged a protest and gained their freedom. This freedom would be short-lived, as plantation owners quickly began devising new regulations. The now free laborers were forced, by law, to sign contracts which bound them and their families to the plantations on which they worked. By signing these contracts, the laborers became slaves again, in all but name. Contract Day In October 1878, laborers gathered in Frederiksted to demand higher wages and better working conditions. Although it was initially a peaceful gathering, the crowd began to become violent after rumors circulated, including a rumor that a laborer had been hospitalized, but was mistreated and died in police custody. The rioters threw stones and the Danish soldiers retaliated with gunfire. As violence escalated, the soldiers barricaded themselves inside a fort. Unable to scale the gates to access the fort, the rioters turned their focus on the town and began looting the town, using torches to burn many buildings and plantations. On October 4, British, French, and American warships arrived and offered to help stop the riot. However, Governor Garde was confident he and his men had the situation under control, and turned the ships away, though some soldiers borrowed guns from the British ships. The next day, the Governor ordered all laborers to return to their plantations or be declared \\"rebels\\". Laborers were forbidden from leaving their plantations without written permission from the plantation owner. By mid-October, the riot had died down and peace was returning to the islands. Queens of the Fireburn Among the prominent leaders of the riot were three women, Mary \\"Queen Mary\\" Thomas, \\"Queen Agnes\\", and \\"Queen Mathilda.\\" The three women were sentenced to jail, and served their terms in Denmark. A folk song from the 1880s, entitled \\"Queen Mary\\", was written about Mary's role in the riot. In 2004, historian Wayne James uncovered Danish documents, including photographs of the prison where the women served their sentences, a storybook they wrote, and \\"a host of other historically significant documents and photos.\\" According to him, these documents reveal the existence of a fourth \\"queen,\\" Susanna Abramsen, who was known as \\"Bottom Belly.\\" Aftermath The riots caused great destruction to property on the islands. 879 acres were burned, and the damage caused was estimated at hundreds of thousands of dollars. Direct casualties of the riot include the deaths of 60 black laborers and two soldiers, and 14 women who died in an explosion. In addition, 12 laborers were condemned to death and hanged on October 5 1878. One year after the events of Fireburn, in October 1879, new contracts were written which would supposedly increase wages for laborers. However, these contracts were weighted in favor of the plantation owners, and thus resulted in little to no improvement in the laborers' lives. Legacy In 2018 artists Jeannette Ehlers and La Vaughn Belle unveiled a 7 meters (23 ft)-tall statue of Mary Thomas, seated on a throne with a cane knife and torch. Its installation in Copenhagen made the statue Denmark's first public monument to a black woman.

Ethnic, social and linguistic differences become each day more and more present and marked all over the world. Time, history and continuous population intermingling across boundaries led to create cosmopolitan beings, that is to say world citizens who, in spite of their singularity, manage to bring themselves together in order to create a unique and single nation. Among the nations most affected by this cross-fertilization is notably found Mauritius. The social and linguistic diversity of this country makes it unique and contribute to its wealth. It arouses curiosity, urges us to deepen our knowledge on the subject and is, to this extent, worth being studied.  History and linguistic consequences = Discovery of the island  Mauritius was first discovered by Arab sailors during the 5th century. The island was rediscovered by the Portuguese during the 16th century. At the same time, the latter also noticed the existence of other territories located in the Pacific Ocean, near Madagascar. Nevertheless, this new territorial awareness did not urge the Portuguese to settle in the newly discovered islands so that this geographical area will only be exploited later on to become a series of international centres where different ethnic groups will meet and therefore create a new heterogeneous culture. In the 17th century, the Dutch and the French began to develop an interest for these new territories. This interest was motivated by strategic and commercial reasons though they failed in their attempt to colonize the previously mentioned area. Indeed, the Dutch left the island in 1710 after having honoured their Prince, Maurice of Nassau, by naming the island Mauritius. With the arrival of the French, this denomination will be replaced by √éle de France.  The island as a French colony  The first French colonists arrived in Mauritius in 1721 and decided to settle for strategic reasons. Indeed, they used the island as a military and commercial cornerstone because, at this time of the history, the French had in mind to conquer India and expand the spice trade. Mauritius was therefore useful as a port of call since it gave the French the opportunity to obtain fresh supplies and rest from their long journey. Gradually, the French will call in slaves mainly coming from Africa, Madagascar, Mozambique, and India in order to build a large harbour in Mauritius. This interaction between French and African people will then lead to the creation of a pidgin, that is to say, a language that is only used by populations of distinct origins as a means of communication. A pidgin, by definition, isn't the mother tongue of any community but rather emerges from the interaction of each language spoken by each distinct community. When a pidgin becomes further used by new generations as a mother tongue, it loses its name of pidgin and begins to be called Creole. As the consequence of the French colonization, the Creole still spoken nowadays in Mauritius has French roots. Moreover, from this time on, the country will remain well influenced by the French culture, its language and its religion. A great number of Indians will incidentally convert to Christianity. The Indo-Mauritians who adopted a French culture at this point of the history will be considered as Creoles,The term Creole designates here the former African slaves and their descendants. as opposed to the Indo- Mauritians who will settle in the island much later.  The island as a British colony  In 1810, the island becomes British. The new colonizers will give it back its former name of Mauritius and will carry out various important changes even though they will allow Creoles to keep their culture, religion (mostly Christianity), laws, and property. First, they will develop the exploitation of sugar cane, what will better the economic status of the island. Then, the island will know a big improvement in the field of human rights with abolition of slavery in 1835. As a consequence of this important change, a noticeable number of Indians and Chinese will emigrate to the island and become indentured labourersIndentured labourers are foreigners contracted to work for a determined period of time or shopkeepers. The emergence of new ethnic communities will enhance the Mauritian culture in so far as it will increase the number of languages spoken throughout the territory. Among these new languages are Bhojpuri (spoken by Indians coming from Bihar), Hindi, Urdu, Tamil, Telugu (languages spoken by Indians coming from Madras), Marathi (spoken by populations coming from Bombay), Hakka Chinese and Cantonese (varieties of Chinese). Moreover, at this time, the English language is used in the administration at the expense of the French one. Nevertheless, the English people settled in the island tended to adopt the French culture and the Franco-Mauritians‚Äô language and will only try to promote their own language during the 19th century.  The island as an independent state  Politics and economy = In 1968, Mauritius becomes an independent state even though it still belongs to the Commonwealth of Nations. The island only becomes a Republic in 1992. The economy of the land is no more limited to the exploitation of sugar cane and one begins to rely on new resources such as industry, tourism, capital market. In 2001, the island counts 1 185 000 inhabitants. This population is composed of 68% of Indians Among these Indians, 58% of them are Hindus and 16% Muslims (Tamils, Telugus, Marathis), 30% of General Population (28% of Creoles and 2% of Whites) and 2% of Chinese. These heterogeneous communities cohabit rather pacifically although discrimination and racism towards some cultures still exist today There is a conflict on one side between Creoles and Franco-Mauritians and on the other hand between Franco-Mauritians and Indo-Mauritians. This can easily be explained by the fact that, at first, Franco-Mauritians belonged to the higher social class contrarily to Creoles and Indo-Mauritians who were slaves or indentured workers. = Linguistic communities = In Mauritius, the political organization is divided into four linguistic communities among which are Hindus, Muslims, Sino-Mauritians, and the General Population. Contrarily to the two other communities, Hindu and Muslim communities differ from the others because of their belonging to a religious ‚Äì and not ethnic ‚Äì group. Indo-Mauritians Hindus and Muslims belong to the Indo-Mauritian group since they both are communities coming from India. Some Indians only speak Bhojpuri and know only little Hindi and Urdu in spite of the fact that its knowledge could be an important asset in international trade, these two languages being respectively the official languages of India and Pakistan. Hindus It is the community that is composed of Bhojpuris, Marathis, Telugus, Tamils, Gujaratis, and Sindhis. Muslims Among Muslims there are Biharis, Gujaratis, and Kutchis. Sino-Mauritians Hakka Chinese and Cantonese belong to the Sino-Mauritian community. They mainly come from Guandgong (formerly Cantonese), from the South of China, from Singapore and Penang. The general population The General Population is made out of White people, Franco-Mauritians (descendant of colonizers), and Creoles. Nevertheless, the denomination Creole still has a pejorative connotation and still carries the idea of lower social class. It is the reason why some people prefer to use the terminology Persons of Color to designate the General Population. Interactions between communities Most people belonging to a same ethnic group, a same social class and having a same origin tend to live in a same area, which is not problematic since the roads are well developed in the whole island. Therefore, it is easy to move from one to the other extreme of the Mauritian territory. Thanks to the important development of roads, little villages are as well accessible as bigger cities. Most Hindus prefer to live in the country whereas other Indo-Mauritians ‚Äì Muslims ‚Äì prefer more urbanized areas. The population found in the capital and in urbanized zones is mostly the Sino-Mauritian population and the General Population. Religions practiced in each community Each community is different from another from its particularities, culture, language and religion. It is the reason why so many distinct religions are spoken throughout the island. The four most developed religions are Hinduism, Islam, Catholicism and Buddhism. They are mostly practiced respectively by Hindus, Muslims, the General Population and Sino-Mauritians. Languages in use=Languages of worship At first, Mauritius was an empty island where little by little, people settled. As they did so, everyone came in with their culture, language and religious identity. This is what explains the multicultural status of island and the existence of so many worships in such a small territory. Each religion brought by each community is still practiced in the language spoken by this community or at least in the original language in which this particular religion was practiced. Hindus use Hindi, Telugu,Tamil, and Marathi in their worship. Most here Telugu is used as third language here over 30000 Telugu people are living with their unforgettable traditions. Even though Bhojpuri is a language well used by Hindus in their daily life, it is not used as a language of worship because of its spoken status which confer it its unworthiness. Muslims read the Koran in Arabic but the imam communicates with his congregation in Urdu or in Gujarati. As far as Buddhists are concerned, the language used in the practice of their worship is the Chinese. Finally, the Catholics mainly use the French language in their cult since Creole as the same kind of negative connotation as Bhojpuri which is considered as an unworthy language. Therefore, Creole is only used by clergymen when directly addressing to the audience (when telling sermons for instance). Official language The only official language of Mauritius is English, which is consequently the language of administration. Nevertheless, French is spoken at the Assembly and by the deputies of the General Population. It is also necessary to mention the difference between oral and written use of the language. Official documents are redacted in English whereas French and Creole are accepted when addressing the population. Indeed, by using the Creole language, the members of the administration make sure that everyone understands what is being said. It is incidentally used during the elections. Indian and Chinese languages are not really used by the state except when a politician directly targets a specific community. In this case, Hindi and Bhojpuri could for example be used. Languages of the media French is the language most used in the media even though it is rather frequent to come across English headlines in the newspapers. Moreover, English can also be found in British or American press as well as in government communications although comments and conclusions raised at the legislative Assembly are usually translated into French. Creole also appears in the media, more specifically in humorous or parodic quotes and in left-wing press. In this field, the least represented languages are the Indian and Chinese languages even though Hindustani ‚Äì a word referring to Hindi and Urdu as spoken languages ‚Äì is quite used in the Indian and Pakistani cinema.  Publishing languages Contrarily to many countries in which most books are written and published in the official language of the specific territory, Mauritius works differently. First, it is important to differentiate the different types of books existing. Literature is often written in French whereas one usually deals with scientific and technical works in English since English is the language used in academic education and research studies. As far as Indo- Mauritians are concerned, only books of religious or didactical nature are written. At the present time, few works are redacted in Creole, Bhojpuri and Hindi despite the fact that there is a rising number of published documents written in English and Hindi. Languages in the advertisement As far as advertising is concerned, the three languages most used are French, English and Creole. The choice of one language rather than another depends on the commercialized product and on the public targeted. Moreover, a frequent diglossia is noticeable, on the one hand between French and English and on the other hand between French and Creole. It is the reason why it sometimes happens that a catch-phrase should begin in a language and end in another one. Languages of the education In Mauritius, there is a specific tutorial system. Usually, children first go to primary school and it is compulsory. The latter consists of six years of study after which children should take and pass their ‚ÄúSchool Certificate‚Äù to have access to secondary school. Five years later, children are supposed to receive their ‚ÄúCambridge Higher School Certificate‚Äù (HSC) and if they want to go on with their studies they then go to college where seven years of study are needed to obtain a master's degree. From their first year of primary school on, children learn both English and French which is compulsory. English and French are two compulsory languages which are taught up to the level of Cambridge School Certificate (SC). Since 1955, Chinese and Indian students attend classes dedicated to the learning of their culture and ancestral language so that they learn a third language in addition to the two other languages mentioned above. Meanwhile, Catholic Creoles go to their catechism class. Chinese children don't learn, contrarily to what one could think, Hakka or Cantonese which are their mother tongue or at least the mother tongue of their ancestors but rather Mandarin which is the most spoken language in China. The knowledge of this language is a major asset since it is an international language pretty useful in international trading. (Cantonese is also pretty useful in international trade.) As for the Indians, they have the opportunity to choose to learn one Indian language according to their origins. Most primarily school propose to teach Hindi, Tamil, Urdu, Telegu and Marathi. All these languages have a same Indian origin but are nevertheless very different from one another and some of them incidentally use different alphabet in their writing. For instance, Hindi uses the Devanagari alphabet whereas the writing of Urdu requests an Arab alphabet even though both languages are quite similar orally. They only acquired their respective particularities because of cultural and religious differences in which each of them was independently used. Indeed, Hindi is the language of Hindus whereas Urdu is the language of Muslims. The only Indian language not proposed in primary school is Bhojpuri. The reason for that is the fact that only few students are interested in learning it. Moreover, Bhojpuri is considered as a spoken language and is only used on paper in traditional and popular poetry because of its negative connotation compared to Hindu or Urdu which are a lot more prestigious. This prestige probably comes from the international status of these two languages, contrarily to Bhojpuri which is only used locally since Mauritian Bhojpuri is quite different from the one currently spoken in India. Effectively, Indians coming from Calcutta used different dialects which, as time went by, became unified to form Mauritian Bhojpuri. Considering this whole point, we can conclude that the Indians and the Chinese are then dedicated to becoming cosmopolitan beings. Since 1944, the language of education is officially English - at the expense of French ‚Äì excepted in languages classes in which lessons are given in the language being learnt. Nevertheless, Creole is still used by some teachers as an understanding tool. The use of the Mauritians‚Äô mother tongue allows the latter to diminish the number of potential confusions and misunderstandings of the material being taught. To make sure that everyone understand perfectly what a specific lesson deals with, many teachers answer to questions in Creole and repeat a same piece of information twice: once in English and once in Creole. Conclusion Mauritius, this island located in the Indian Ocean and eastward from Africa, is a multiethnic and multilingual country in which a great number of languages are known and spoken. The Mauritians are strongly interested in international languages in order to favour international trade and to crave out its niche in the world. It is incidentally one of the developing nation whose evolution is the most remarkable and impressive. Despite its desire of international interactions, Mauritius still remains strongly attached to its roots and wants to keep its cultural patrimony at all costs. The diversity of the island can however sometimes cause tensions and incomprehension between members of different communities but nonetheless it allows to international relations and contributes above all to the wealth and the maintaining of the Mauritian culture.

Often, materials for construction and museum contexts (including artefact conservation) are evaluated for safety. However, though materials may be safe for building purposes, they may emit trace amounts of chemicals that can harm art objects over time. Acids, formaldehyde, and other fumes can damage and even destroy delicate artifacts if placed too close. Procedure This test calls for a sample of the material in question to be placed in an airtight container with three coupons of different metals‚Äîsilver, lead, and copper‚Äîthat are not touching each other or the sample of the material.Schiro,Mara \\"Oddy Test Protocols\\" http://www.conservation- wiki.com/index.php?title=Oddy_Test_Protocols&oldid;=4830 Accessed February 6, 2012. The container is sealed with a small amount of de-ionized water to maintain a high humidity, then heated at 60 degrees Celsius for 28 days. An identical container with three metal coupons acts as a control. If the metal coupons show no signs of corrosion, then the material is deemed suitable to be placed in and around art objects. The Oddy test is not a contact test, but is for testing off-gassing. A basic layout of a three-in-one Oddy Test Each metal detects a different set of corrosive agents. The silver is for detecting reduced sulfur compounds and carbonyl sulfides. The lead is for detecting organic acids, aldehyde, and acidic gases. The copper is for detecting chloride, oxide, and sulfur compounds. There are many types of materials testing for other purposes, including chemical testing and physical testing. Development The Oddy test has gone through many changes and refinements over time. Whereas Andrew Oddy proposed to place each metal coupon in a separate glass container with the material to be tested, Bamberger et al.Studies in Conservation, Vol. 44, No. 2 (1999), pp. 86-90. proposed a \\"three-in-one\\" test, where all three metal coupons shared one container, simplifying the procedure. Robinett and Thickett (2003)Studies in Conservation, Vol. 48, No. 4 (2003), pp. 263-268. refined the \\"three-in-one\\" test by stabilizing the metal coupons. One of the main issues with the Oddy test is that there is some subjectivity to the interpretation of the results,http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation- journal/issue-43/standard-materials-for-corrosiveness-testing/ since it is primarily a visual determination. Oddy-tests 0823b Institutions that use the Oddy test in their research are mainly art museums such as The J. Paul Getty Museum, The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Image by Black Forest Cherry Photography Varuna, The National Writers‚Äô House is Australia's national residential writers' house in the former home of writers Eleanor Dark and Dr Eric Dark. In 1989 their son Mick Dark gifted their home to the Australian public through The Eleanor Dark Foundation. Due to this extraordinary act of philanthropy, Varuna has become Australia's most eminent residential program for writers. Since 1989 Varuna the National Writers' House has inspired the creation of new Australian writing and provided support for a thriving writing community and growing Alumni. Along with its Residential Program, Varuna also has a lively literary program, including the Varuna & Sydney Writers Festival, Varuna Open Day and various workshops and consultations. Located in Katoomba two hours from Sydney, in the Blue Mountains, New South Wales Australia, Varuna is a short walk from the centre of town, and a short walk from the edge of the escarpment looking down into the magnificent Jamison Valley.  Programming  The Varuna Residential Program supports intensive work, conversation and community for writers at all levels of experience and across a wide range of writing practice. The program runs continuously throughout the year with up to five writers, each with an identified project, invited to be in residence at Varuna at any one time. Each year Varuna hosts almost 200 writers‚Äô residencies. The five streams of the Varuna Residential Program are Fellowships, Publisher Introduction Program, Guided Programs, Invitation by Request Residencies and Residential Partnerships. Varuna is also works within the broader community through its community engagement programs. It has an active Varuna Alumni program, the annual Varuna & Sydney Writers Festival, Varuna Open Day and various writer development workshops, consultations and events.  History  Varuna, named after the ancient Indian god of the heavens and the waters, a powerful deity indeed, was the home built, or rather rebuilt, on two acres of land by Eleanor Dark and Eric Dark in 1939. A bright and roomy house with modernist stucco exterior, certainly larger than any other house in the neighbourhood, it has been described by Eleanor's biographer Barbara Brooks as 'a bit of a monument.' The studio, added later, still boasts Eleanor's sprawling desk scored with cigarette burns and a custom built cabinet with a separate drawer for each developing chapter. In days gone by it has served as a focus for the local community of writers by playing host to book readings, launches, forums, festival events and, not least, some raucous and rambunctious curry nights; Dorothy Hewett holding court in the lounge room, while her husband Merv Lilley dispensed mulled wine from the tureen in the boot of his car outside. These sumptuous communal feasts allowed Varuna to play a galvanising role for visiting and local writers, something that Mick Dark loved. They brought a focus to a common ideal, namely a shared understanding of the value of writing and of writers in a local, national, and international context. Indeed, many friendships and writerly liaisons have been formed there. It was at one of these curry nights, with children full of chocolate biscuits sliding up and down the staircase, that Mick Dark told the story of why the fireplace in Dr Dark's GP's office did not draw properly and had a tendency to fill the room with smoke whenever it was lit. As a boy, when the builders were constructing the chimney, young Michael climbed onto the roof to see what the bricklayers had been up to. Peering down he dislodged a new brick, still wet with an icing of fresh cement, and knocked it down the chimney. Where it stuck. A secret he kept for many years. It sounds like the sort of mischievous exploit of Tony Griffiths, the wonderful character from Eleanor's story 'Sweet and Low' in Lantana Lane, might get up to. A reminder that apart from its standing as a cultural icon it is also a living, breathing home, where Eleanor's grandson Rod Dark still tends the garden, and the roving family of writers moves through the doors in a shimmering wealth of words adding steadily to the cumulative sense of community and purpose.  The Dark Family  Eleanor Dark was one of Australia's finest writers of the 20th century, and Varuna owes its existence today to Eleanor, her husband Dr Eric Dark and their family. Eleanor was born in 1901 in Sydney, Australia. She was the second of three children born to the poet, writer and parliamentarian, Dowell Philip O‚ÄôReilly and Eleanor McCulloch O'Reilly. On finishing school and unable to enter university, having failed mathematics, Eleanor learnt typing and took a secretarial job. In 1922 she married Dr Eric Payten Dark, and in January 1923 the couple moved to Katoomba, where Eleanor wrote eight of her 10 novels, as well as short stories and articles. Her best known novel was the best-selling The Timeless Land (1941), the first part of a trilogy, with Storm of Time (1948) and No Barrier (1953). Dr Eric Payten Dark (1889‚Äì1987), Eleanor's husband, was a general practitioner who wrote books, articles and pamphlets on politics and medicine. Eric Dark was born in Mittagong, New South Wales and qualified as a medical practitioner at Sydney University in 1914, qualifying a year early because of the war. He was among the first hundred Australian doctors who sailed to England to join the Royal Army Medical Corps. Dr Dark, who was recommended for the Military Cross after the battle of the Somme, was eventually awarded the Military Cross for his service at Passchendaele. Dr Dark later became an active member of the Labor left in NSW, was involved in contemporary political debate and was a committed socialist, although, contrary to local rumour, was never a member of the Communist Party. His books include The World Against Russia and Who are the Reds. Michael (Mick) Dark is the son of Eleanor and Dr Eric Dark, and it was he who decided that Varuna, their family home, should become a gift to Australian literature in memory of his parents. Mick spent his childhood and youth living at Varuna. After the death of his parents, for environmental and personal reasons, he did not want to sell Varuna and in November 1987 he eagerly responded to a suggestion that it could become a residential writers' centre. In 1989 the Eleanor Dark Foundation was formed and Mick gifted the property to the Foundation. Like his parents before him, Mick was a committed environmentalist. In the 60s and 70s he was a member of the Colong Committee (now Colong Foundation for Wilderness). He was also past President of the Lower and of the Upper Blue Mountains Conservation Societies, now combined as Blue Mountains Conservation Society, of which he was an Honorary Life member. He was also a member of Greenpeace and the Australian Conservation Foundation. He was the Life President of the Eleanor Dark Foundation Board, taking an active role in the life of Varuna until his death in 2015.

The invasion of the kingdom of the Vandals was one of the largest amphibious operations in antiquity, with 1,113 ships and over 50,000 personnel. While attempting to land near Carthage at the Cape of Mercury (; Greek: ·ºôœÅŒºŒ±ŒØŒ± ·ºåŒ∫œÅŒ±; now Cape Bon or, in French, '), the Roman fleet was thrown into disorder by a Vandal fireship attack. The Vandal fleet followed up on the action and sunk over 100 Roman ships. Some 10,000 Roman soldiers and sailors died in the battle. The Roman expedition was now too scattered to land its troops, leading to its complete failure. The battle is considered to have ended the Western Roman Empire's chances of survival. Without access to the resources of the former Roman province of Africa, the west could not sustain an army powerful enough to defeat its numerous enemies. Background By 435, the Vandals under their king Gaiseric, had established the Vandal kingdom of Africa. In 455, Gaiseric sacked Rome, the former capital of the Western Roman Empire, and the Empress Licinia Eudoxia (widow of Emperor Valentinian III) and her daughters had been taken as hostages. The plan was concerted between Eastern Emperor Leo, Western Emperor Anthemius, and General Marcellinus, who enjoyed independence in Illyricum. Basiliscus was ordered to sail directly to Carthage, while Marcellinus attacked and took Sardinia, and a third army, commanded by Heraclius of Edessa, landed on the Libyan coast east of Carthage, making rapid progress. It appears that the combined forces met in Sicily, whence the three fleets moved at different periods. Procopius records that Basiliscus, brother-in-law to Emperor Leo, had been selected as general by the emperor in hope he would balance the growing influence of the Alan Magister militum Aspar who sought to control Leo; however, Basiliscus sought the friendship of Aspar to further his own designs on the throne, and Aspar \\"repeatedly urged upon Basiliscus that he should spare the Vandals and Genseric\\".Procopius, De Bello III.6.4; translated by H.B. Dewing, Procopius (Cambridge: Loeb Classical Library, 1979), vol. 2 pp. 55f. Ancient and modern historians provided different estimates for the number of ships and troops commanded by Basiliscus, as well as for the expenses of the expedition, although both were enormous sums. According to the text of Priscus, 100,000 ships were assembled, although modern scholars have emended this to 1100, which is closer to Cedrenus's figure of 1,113 vessels.Priscus, fragment 42; translated by Colin D. Gordon, The Age of Attila: Fifth Century Byzantium and the Barbarians (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1966), p. 120f. See Gordon's note 11 on the emendation. Peter Heather estimates a strength of 30,000 soldiers for the expedition and 50,000 total, when including sailors and the additional forces of Marcellinus and Heraclius. The figures for the money spent on this expedition ranges from the 1,300 centaria of gold reported by Priscus and Procopius (130,000 Roman pounds), to the 64,000 pounds of gold and 700,000 pounds of silver by John Lydus and to 65,000 of gold and 700,000 of silver by Candidus.Procopius, De Bello III.6.2; translated by Dewing, Procopius, vol. 2 p. 55. Candidus, fragment 2; translated by Gordon, p. 121 Battle Lucas d'Heere in the 2nd half of the 16th century. Preserved in the Ghent University Library. Sardinia and Libya were already conquered by Marcellinus and Heraclius, when Basiliscus cast anchor off Cape Bon, opposite Sicily, about forty miles from Carthage. Gaiseric asked Basiliscus to allow him five days to draw up conditions for a peace.Procopius suggests that Gaiseric supported his request for a truce with a bribe. (De Bello III.6.12-16; translated by Dewing, Procopius, vol. 2 p. 59f) During the negotiations, Gaiseric gathered his ships and suddenly attacked the Roman fleet. The Vandals had filled many vessels with combustible materials. During the night, these fire ships were propelled against the unguarded and unsuspecting Roman fleet. The Byzantine commanders tried to rescue some ships from destruction, but these manoeuvres were blocked by the attack of other Vandal vessels. Basiliscus fled in the heat of the battle. One act of heroism stands forth from this naval defeat. Despite the situation, Basiliscus' lieutenant, Joannes, bravely fought the Vandal onslaught; Procopius describes him as \\"standing on the deck\\" and \\"turning from side to side kept killing very great numbers of the enemy\\". Upon seeing that his ship was about to be captured, he refused to surrender to Genso, the son of Gaiseric, instead leaped overboard in heavy armor and drowned himself. His last words were that he \\"would never come under the hands of dogs\\".Procopius, De Bello III.6.22-24; translated by Dewing, Procopius, vol. 2 p. 63 Aftermath One half of the Roman fleet was burned, sunk, or captured, and the other half followed the fugitive Basiliscus. The whole expedition had failed. Heraclius effected his retreat through the desert into Tripolitania, holding the position for two years until recalled; Marcellinus retired to Sicily, where he was reached by Basiliscus; the general was, however, assassinated, perhaps at the instigation of Ricimer, by one of his own captains; and the king of the Vandals expressed his surprise and satisfaction, that the Romans themselves would remove from the world his most formidable antagonists. After returning to Constantinople, Basiliscus hid in the church of Hagia Sophia to escape the wrath of the people and the revenge of the Emperor. By the mediation of Verina, Basiliscus obtained the Imperial pardon, and was punished merely with banishment to Heraclea Sintica, in Thrace.J.B. Bury, History of the Later Roman Empire (Macmillan, 1923), vol. 1 pp. 336f The treasuries of the Eastern Roman Empire were now empty.

It is based on Don Winslow's novel of the same name. The screenplay was written by Shane Salerno, Stone, and Winslow. The film was released on July 6, 2012 to mixed reviews, and stars Taylor Kitsch, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Benicio del Toro, Demi√°n Bichir, Salma Hayek, John Travolta, Emile Hirsch and Blake Lively. Plot Best friends Chon (Taylor Kitsch) and Ben (Aaron Taylor- Johnson) are marijuana growers in Laguna Beach, California. Chon, a former Navy SEAL, smuggled the seeds for the plants out of Afghanistan. Ben, a University of California, Berkeley graduate in business and botany, cultivates the marijuana. The seeds yield a particularly potent strain, which develops a wide customer base. Chon and Ben become wealthy, and Ben devotes time and money to charity work in Africa and Asia. They are both openly in a relationship with Ophelia Sage (Blake Lively). The trio receives a video from Mexican drug-cartel enforcer Miguel \\"Lado\\" Arroyo (Benicio del Toro) of severed heads and a chainsaw, and Arroyo demands a meeting at which the cartel offers a partnership. Although Chon and Ben offer to hand over their network and get out of the business, the cartel wants their expertise and insists on a partnership. Chon and Ben make plans with Ophelia to go to Indonesia for a year, not telling her that they are fleeing the cartel. They speak to corrupt DEA agent Dennis Cain (John Travolta), who is on the take from them and who urges them to join the cartel. Ophelia is kidnapped by Lado's gang; Chon and Ben are notified of the kidnapping by a video call from cartel leader Elena S√°nchez (Salma Hayek), who threatens to harm Ophelia if they decline the partnership. They discuss the situation with Dennis, who tells them that Elena is facing the loss of her political connections in Mexico (foiling her efforts to move into the US). Since she has already lost most of her family, Dennis says that he has nothing on her that can help them. Chon stabs Dennis in the hand and demands DEA intelligence so they can attack Elena. With help from Chon's Navy SEAL friends, he and Ben attack a cartel money convoy and kill seven of Elena's men. Ophelia, held in horrible conditions, demands to speak to whoever is in charge. Lado drugs and rapes her in retaliation for going over his head. Elena, traveling to the US to visit her daughter and deal with the escalating situation, has Ophelia brought with her. Chon and Ben frame high-ranking cartel member Alex (Demi√°n Bichir) as an agent of Elena's rival, El Azul. With Dennis' help, they falsify evidence and give it to Lado. Lado tortures Alex to force a confession. After Alex confesses, Lado covers him with petrol and forces Ben to ignite the petrol; Ophelia is forced to watch. Lado double-crosses Elena and begins working with El Azul. Ben and Chon pay Dennis $3 million for information about Elena's daughter, Magda (Sandra Echeverria), and the name of his informant in Elena's cartel. They kidnap Magda and video-call Elena to establish that they are now in control. With Elena at their mercy, they arrange a desert meeting to exchange Ophelia and Magda at which snipers from both sides are in position. Elena asks who revealed her daughter's location, and Chon tells her it was Lado. She tries to kill Lado, but he shoots her first; a firefight erupts, and Chon is shot several times. Lado is shot in the back by Ben, but shoots him in the neck before Ophelia kills him. Ben is mortally wounded, and Chon injects him, Ophelia and himself with a fatal overdose so they can die together. Ophelia wakes from a nightmare. At the meeting, Lado steals Elena's car and escapes as Dennis leads DEA agents to the scene. Everyone but Lado and Magda are arrested. Because Ben has incriminating information about Dennis, Dennis identifies Ben and Chon as his informants in the cartel and they are released. Elena is sentenced to thirty years in prison, and El Azul and Lado create a new cartel called the Azulados. Ben, Chon and Ophelia leave the country and live in a beachside hut, possibly in Indonesia. Ophelia tells us that they are living like savages.

Universal told us to use fakes.\\" The sex scenes were filmed during the first three days. The film entered post-production in October 2011. Casting Jennifer Lawrence was originally cast as Ophelia but dropped out due to scheduling conflicts. Other actresses considered to replace Lawrence included Amber Heard, Olivia Wilde, Lindsay Lohan, Teresa Palmer, and Abbie Cornish. In April 2011, it was reported that Blake Lively had been cast as Ophelia. Before casting Taylor Kitsch in the film, Oliver Stone asked director Peter Berg to show him 30 minutes of Kitsch's work in Battleship to see how he was as a leading man, and after seeing that footage, he cast him. Trevor Donovan originally auditioned for a role that was cut but after seeing Donovan's tape, Stone specifically wrote him a part that was not in the book. Uma Thurman played Ophelia's mother, Paqu, but her scenes were cut due to time constraints. Release The film was released on July 6, 2012. On its opening weekend, the film ranked fourth at the box-office, earning $16.2 million. As of April 3, 2013, it has grossed $47,382,068 in North America and $35,584,084 in other countries, for a worldwide total of $82,966,152.

Savages received mixed reviews from critics. Based on 190 reviews collected by aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, the film scored a 51% approval rating, with an average rating of 5.71/10. The site's critical consensus is, \\"It's undeniably messy, but Savages finds Oliver Stone returning to dark, fearlessly lurid form.\\" Metacritic, another review aggregator which assigns a weighted mean rating in the 0‚Äì100 range based on reviews from top mainstream critics, calculated an average score of 59, based on 41 reviews, which indicates \\"Mixed or average reviews\\". The film was somewhat better received in Europe. UK film and music journalist Dylan B Jones praised it, claiming director Oliver Stone had found \\"a magic strain of sultry sex, frantically emotional turmoil and glossily savvy action sequences\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three and a half stars (out of four) and praised Oliver Stone's direction, saying, \\"Much of the fascination of 'Savages' comes through Stone's treatment of the negotiations, which involve percentages, sliding scales over three years, an ultimate payout, and other financial details that drugs have in common with big business. It's spellbinding to watch the two sides trying to outthink each other.\\" HitFix's film critic Drew McWeeny gave the film an A- and called it \\"one of the most complete pleasures for me this summer\\". He was in general positive of the actors' performances; he described Lively's work as \\"smart and sad precisely because she plays O as such a broken, needy little soul\\" and praised the bond between Kitsch and Taylor-Johnson which \\"seems not only credible but lived in and authentic throughout the film.\\" In comparison, MovieFix's film critic Connor Jason gave the film 2/5, noting that \\"Savages is a hot mess ‚Äì beautiful actors and locations mixed with a plot that starts strong but ultimately turns into a snooze-fest. With a lead villain seemingly ripped from the cover of Cosmo magazine, Stone's latest flick savagely disappoints.\\" The film was nominated at the 2012 ALMA Awards in four categories including \\"Favorite Movie Actor\\", \\"Favorite Movie Actress‚ÄîDrama/Adventure\\", \\"Favorite Movie Actor‚ÄîSupporting Role\\", and \\"Favorite Movie Actress‚ÄîSupporting Role\\" for Benicio Del Toro, Salma Hayek, Demi√°n Bichir and Mia Maestro, respectively. According to InSight Crime, the assertions used to promote the movie \\"are not only false, but promote a dangerously misleading view of the country's criminal groups.\\" According to the article, in a televised interview Oliver Stone made a series of unfounded and false assertions to justify his opposition to the War on Drugs, fueling a \\"dystopian narrative of Mexico\\" and feeding on the belief that the Mexican criminals are \\"invincible supermen.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * * * * Soundtrack-movie.com Savages soundtrack link Category:2012 films Category:2012 action thriller films Category:2012 crime thriller films Category:American action drama films Category:American action thriller films Category:American crime action films Category:American crime drama films Category:American crime thriller films Category:American films Category:American films about cannabis Category:English-language films Category:Films about kidnapping Category:Films about Mexican drug cartels Category:Films about rape Category:Films based on American crime novels Category:Films directed by Oliver Stone Category:Films set in California Category:Films set in Mexico Category:Films shot in Indonesia Category:Films with screenplays by Oliver Stone Category:Relativity Media films Category:Stoner crime films ","title":"Savages (2012 film)"},{"id":"31676811","text":"Koron may refer to: * Karun, Hormozgan, Iran * Koroni, Greece * Koron (music) * Koron (Cappadocia), now in Turkey ","title":"Koron"},{"id":"31676812","text":"Suznanie (Consciousness) was a Bulgarian language weekly newspaper published in the United States between December 1923 and 1937.

Plot Amateur sleuth Tom Lawrence (Tom Conway) known as \\"The Falcon,\\" is approached by Mia Bruger (Rita Corday) to help in finding her brother, who had gone missing. When Tom goes to a cocktail bar, he is attacked and knocked unconscious. When he revives, he finds himself in his car on a country road. A motorcycle police officer stops him and arrests him, because Police Inspector Timothy Donovan (Cliff Clark) has put out a \\"all-points\\" bulletin for his arrest in the case of a murdered bank official and the theft of $250,000 in war bonds. Although the Falcon has an alibi with his fianc√©e, reporter Marcia Brooks (Jane Randolph) and assistant, \\"Goldie\\" Locke (Cliff Edwards) supporting him, Donovan is skeptical and attempts to incarcerate Tom, who makes his escape. Returning to the bar, it is now the headquarters of a woman's knitting society, run by Geraldine Lipton (Wynne Gibson). When the trio of sleuths head off to Lipton's resort hotel, they find a number of suspicious individuals, hotel manager Gwynne Gregory (Harriet Hilliard), former criminal Rickey Davis (Erford Gage), a nurse to invalid Bruno Steffen (Andr√© Charlot) and Mia. When Tom approaches Mia, she pretends that she doesn't know him and dives into the pool but as she hits the water, she is killed by a gunshot. Looking for the killer, Tom runs into puppeteer Smiley Dugan (Edgar Kennedy), who alerts Donovan that the Falcon is at the hotel. Picking up a cigarette case that might be a clue to the murderer, Tom has to work quickly before Donovan arrives. Marcia reports that the fingerprints on the cigarette case belong to a notorious thief known as \\"the Duchess\\". Tom phones his houseboy, Jerry (Richard Loo), telling him to pose as the Chinese Trade Commissioner wanting to buy war bonds. After Steffen confides to Jerry that he plans to buy war bonds from Gwynne, Tom exposes Mrs. Lipton as the Duchess, and accuses her of stealing the bonds, but Donovan, with a warrant for murder, arrests Tom, Marcia, Goldie and Jerry instead. Finding a way to escape once again, Tom returns to the hotel, and confronts Mrs. Lipton, who was being blackmailed by Rickey into selling the war bonds. When Rickey is killed, a terrified Gwynne confesses that she was involved because Rickey was her husband. When he is trapped in an elevator with Gwynne, Tom realizes that the killer is still in the hotel. Finding a way out, Tom rushes to Mrs. Lipton's room to find the puppeteer threatening the hotel owner. When Tom tries to apprehend him, Dugan falls to his death. Donovan, now convinced in Tom's innocence, arrives to arrest Mrs. Lipton for the theft of the war bonds.

As the range of currently used operating systems expands, and the use of multiple devices by workers to perform their jobs escalates, user virtualization can support the creation of a \\"follow-me\\" identity that will allow access to a workspace without being tied into only a single device or a single location.  User virtualization for virtual desktops  For virtualized desktop environments, user virtualization represents a fundamental change in the way the corporate desktop is constructed, delivered and managed. The user‚Äôs personality is decoupled from the operating system and applications, managed independently and applied into a desktop as needed without scripting, group policies or use of user profiles ‚Äì regardless of how the desktop is being delivered (physical, virtual, cloud, etc.). User virtualization for terminal servers  For server based computing environments, user virtualization enables IT to have more control over the shared environment, optimize infrastructure needs and ensure an optimal experience for their users. With application entitlement, unauthorized applications are blocked without the need for complex scripts or high- maintenance lists, providing protection from unknown executables and ensuring compliance with Microsoft licensing.  User personality  User personality is a combination of corporate policy and user personalization. Policy is used to set up and maintain a user desktop session. Policy also ensures a user session remains compliant by controlling application access, locking down or removing operating system and application functions, as well as self-healing essential files, folders, processes, services and registry settings. Personalization constitutes any change a user makes to his or her desktop.  User persona  User persona is another term used interchangeably with user personality or user personalization.

She served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for the electoral district of Winnipeg South Centre from 2011 to 2015. Early and personal life Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba Bateman was involved in the musical community. After training four summers at the Banff School of Fine Arts, she went to study at the University of Western Ontario under Ralph Aldrich. She put herself through university there by playing viola in the London Symphony Orchestra and received her HBA from the Ivey School of Business. After attending business school, Bateman articled with Price Waterhouse in Winnipeg and has worked and lived in Winnipeg ever since. She met Darrell Hancock while at Price Waterhouse. Hancock and Bateman are married and have two children. Joyce Bateman is a Chartered Accountant. Prior to her election to Parliament, Bateman was a trustee on the Winnipeg School Board. First elected to the Winnipeg School Board in 2001, she served two terms as chairperson, and one term as vice- chairperson.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/winnipeg-south-centre-1.866198#c1 She was formerly a member of the federal Liberal party, although her party membership lapsed in 2009. In 2011, she said that she opted to run as a Conservative due to misgivings over the fiscal policies of the Liberal Party, which she described as \\"reckless.\\" \\"Liberal fiscal plan 'reckless': Bateman\\". Winnipeg Free Press, April 2, 2011.\\"Longtime Liberal jumping to Conservatives\\". CBC News, April 1, 2011. Federal politics Joyce Bateman successfully ran for School Trustee in 2001. As Chair of the Board of Trustees, her fiscal prudence enabled the full reinstatement of the Nursery Program in 2005 for the Winnipeg School Division. It had been cut by the Board in 1998 before Bateman was elected. Bateman successfully ran for School Trustee with no political affiliation. In late 2003, she purchased a membership, under the Paul Martin push, in the Liberal Party of Canada. She left that party in 2009. In 2011, given her four-time successful electoral record (2001, 2002, 2006 and 2010), Bateman was sought out by the Conservative Party of Canada to run in Winnipeg South Centre. She was successful. While serving in Parliament there was a serious problem with a rail crossing in her riding. As a result, she introduced a Private Members‚Äô Bill on Rail Safety which makes every rail crossing throughout Canada safer. During the 2015 federal election, Bateman participated in a debate on the economy held by Jewish advocate group B'nai Brith and was booed when she read off a list of Liberal candidates who had allegedly made statements contrary to the interests of the State of Israel. The list included Andrew Leslie, a retired Lieutenant General who led Canadian troops in Afghanistan. Bateman refused to apologize afterwards, saying that she was \\"proud to be part of a party that stands firmly with Israel.\\" Bateman was heavily defeated in 2015 by former Liberal provincial MLA Jim Carr, falling to 28 percent of the vote. She re-contested her previous riding in a rematch against Carr in the 2019 federal election but lost.

The film recounts his life and legacy, not only as a great entertainer, but as an important activist in the Civil Rights Movement. This inspirational biographical film begins with Belafonte's birth into poverty in Harlem in 1927, and childhood years in Jamaica, sent there by his immigrant mother. Director Susanne Rostock takes the viewer through his discovery of theater and training as an actor as a young man, and on to his career and success as a singer. The film shows not only Belafonte's remarkable success as a singer and actor, but also his true passion for social change. The film outlines some highlights of his entertainment career, but is more focused on how he helped change the world in other ways: marching with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in the civil-rights era; working against apartheid in South Africa; fighting hunger through his instrumental work with USA for Africa; and, most recently, working to combat gang violence through programs with inner-city youth.* In an interview about the film, Belafonte discussed his activism from Civil Rights to poverty in Africa. The film won an award in section \\"American Docs\\" on the 2. American Film Festival. At the 2011 Vancouver International Film Festival, Sing Your Song won the Most Popular Nonfiction Film Award, which is based on ballots cast by audiences at the festival.

Life She was born in Athens, the daughter of Eleni (n√©e Stamati) from Patras and Yannis Anghelakis from Asia Minor. Her godfather was the Cretan writer Nikos Kazantzakis, a close friend of her parents. She married Rodney Rooke in 1963. While a very young child she contracted a bacterial infection that ate affected her bones and left her with a severe limp and a stunted arm. She attended primary and secondary school in Athens. She followed courses at the Universities of Athens and Nice, completing her studies with a degree in translation and interpretation at the University of Geneva. As well as working as a translator, she produced pistachio nuts at her orchard on the island of Aegina, where her parents had bought an old house in the 1920s and planted pistachio trees. She spent most of her time in a rented flat in Athens, but it was in Aegina that she felt most at home. She published her first poem in the magazine ŒöŒ±ŒπŒΩŒøœçœÅŒ≥ŒπŒ± ŒµœÄŒøœáŒÆ in 1956. The themes of her poetry include the close relation between the human being and the natural world; a constant meditation on death; the experience of being a woman in a society that has traditionally circumscribed women‚Äôs activities; the indispensable contribution of sex and passionate love to the fulfilment of the self; the often tragic but at times triumphant dependency of the self on the body; and the aspiration to transcend the limitations of the body by means of the body itself. A deeply philosophical as well as a sensual poet, two of her last books consist of self-analyses in the form of monologues and dialogues between different aspects of herself. She became one of the best known and best loved poets in Greece. In 1985 she received the second State Poetry Prize, in 2000 the Kostas and Eleni Ourani Prize from the Academy of Athens, and in 2014 she was awarded the Grand State Prize for Literature for the totality of her work. Her poetry has been published in at least eleven languages. Her literary translations were done chiefly from English (her husband‚Äôs language) and from Russian (the language she learned in her earliest years from her Russian nanny). The authors she translated from English include Saul Bellow, Joseph Brodsky, Seamus Heaney, Sylvia Plath, Dylan Thomas (Under Milk Wood), Derek Walcott.

It was built between by Giovanni Maria Bernardoni who perfected the original design of J√≥zef Britius. It is the biggest of the historic Churches of Krak√≥w in terms of seating capacity. Since 1842 it serves the Catholic All Saints parish.  History  The Church of Saints Peter and Paul is the first structure in Krak√≥w designed entirely in the Baroque style, and perhaps the first Baroque building in present-day Poland. It was funded by the King Sigismund III Vasa (Zygmunt III) for the Jesuit order. The plan of the church as a cruciform basilica was drafted by an Italian architect Giovanni de Rossi. His design was carried out by J√≥zef Britius at first (from 1597), and then modified by Giovanni Maria Bernardoni. The final shape of the present day fa√ßade, the dome and its Baroque interior belongs to Giovanni Battista Trevano, who completed them in the years . The Church was ceremonially consecrated on 8 July 1635. In the years , at the time of the Partitions of Poland, the place of worship served as an Orthodox church. Since 1842 until now, it belongs to the Roman Catholic All Saints parish. In 1960 the church was raised to the rank of the Smaller Basilica.  Architectural form  The facade of Saints Peter and Paul Basilica was constructed with dolomite. It resembles that of the Church of Santa Susanna in Rome by Carlo Maderno, but also, it contains similarities with the facade of the main Jesuit church of Il Ges√π. In its niches are statues of Jesuit saints: Ignatius of Loyola, Francis Xavier, Aloysius Gonzaga, and Stanis≈Çaw Kostka made by Dawid Heel. Above the main portal, there's the emblem of the order of Jesuits with saints Sigismund of Burgundy and Ladislaus I of Hungary. The very top of the facade is adorned with the coat of arms of the Vasa dynasty since king Sigismund III Vasa was the founder of the church. The church interior has a broad, single-nave with two aisles consisting of chapels, as well as the transept with a dome at the intersection, and a short rectangular chancel around the altar, with semicircular apse covered with a hemispherical vault. In front of the Church-grounds there are several plinths with raised sculptures of apostles designed by Kacper Ba≈ºanka. They were made with Pi≈Ñcz√≥w limestone, and completed in 1722 by Dawid Heel. Today, in place of the original 18th century statues, which were very much damaged by acid rain, there are contemporary copies made of the same material by Kazimierz Jƒôczmyk.  Interior design  Stucco decorations of the interior, mainly on overhead vaults, belong to Giovanni Battista Falconi of Milan who spent most of his adult life working in Poland. In the apse of the presbytery, there are also his scenes from the life and death of Saints Peter and Paul, and the statues of patrons of Poland ‚Äì Saint Wojciech and Saint Stanis≈Çaw. In the aisles, his artwork becomes much more joyous and include figures of angelic putti woven into ornamental compositions and plafonds. Late Baroque high altar from 1735 with the image of J√≥zef Brodowski \\"giving keys to St. Peter\\" was designed by Kacper Ba≈ºanka. Among the accessories in the interior, a sarcophagus of the Bishop Andrzej Trzebicki from late 17th century stands out prominently, as well as the receptacles of Branicki family (from 1720‚Äì1725) and Brzechffs, from 1716 by Ba≈ºanka. The interior lighting is subordinate to the Baroque dramatization of liturgy and focussed on the priest celebrating Holy Mass. The side pillars supporting the dome were supposed to create the impression of the theatre stage inside. In 1638 the Jesuits formed a musical ensemble there, the biggest in contemporary Poland. It featured around 80 to 100 singers. In the basement beneath the floor of the church Rev. Piotr Skarga is buried. Most recently, beginning January 2010, works proceeded on creating the National Pantheon in the Church's vaults.

Named after the French physicist L√©on Foucault, the experimental apparatus consists of a tall pendulum free to swing in any vertical plane. The actual path of the swing appears to rotate; while in fact the plane is fixed in space, but the Earth rotates under the pendulum once a sidereal day. It is a simple and easy-to-see proof of the Earth's movement. Foucault‚Äôs Pendulum at ITOTD.com November 8, 2004.\\"Le pendule de Foucault perd la boule.\\" Lexpress.fr The pendulum weights 25 kg and is fitted with the red laser marking a clock face at the floor. It takes about an hour to notice a significant difference in its path, and the explanation is provided in Polish. The history of the pendulum at the Church is several decades long. For the first time, it was hung in 1949 on the initiative of professors Kordylewski and Horbacki. It was put on display again in 1991 on the anniversary of the arrival of Miko≈Çaj Kopernik in the city. However, the renovations two years later required that the pendulum be taken down. In 2000, said Dr Henryk Brancewicz, astronomer at the Jagiellonian University, a local daredevil clambered from the outside and again hung the string in the telescope of the dome. Notable people buried at the Saints Peter and Paul Church The Church of Saint Peter and Paul hosts one of Poland's National Pantheons (Panteon Narodowy) alongside the Wawel Cathedral, St. John's Archcathedral and the Church of St Michael the Archangel and St Stanislaus the Bishop and Martyr, a burial place of the most distinguished Poles representing the fields of the arts, culture and science. The work on the construction of the pantheon began in October 2010 and the official opening of the first part of the complex took place in 2012 on the 400th anniversary of Piotr Skarga's death whose remains were kept in one of the church's crypts.

The other four parts were not passed, but are still on the agenda of the California Department of Toxic Substances Control green ribbon science panel discussions. The two parts of the California Green Chemistry Initiative that were passed are known as AB 1879 (Chapter 559, Statutes of 2008): Hazardous Materials and Toxic Substances Evaluation and Regulation and SB 509 (Chapter 560, Statutes of 2008): Toxic Information Clearinghouse. Implementation of CGCI has been delayed indefinitely beyond the January 1, 2011.  Purpose  Green chemistry is the design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use and generation of hazardous substances. Green chemistry is based upon twelve principles, identified in ‚ÄúGreen Chemistry: Theory and Practice‚Äù and adopted by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It is an innovative technology which encourages the design of safer chemicals and products and minimizes the impact of wastes through increased energy efficiency, the design of chemical products that degrade after use and the use of renewable resources (instead of non-renewable fossil fuel such as petroleum, gas and coal). The Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics (OPPT), created under the United States Pollution Prevention Act of 1990, promotes the use of chemistry for pollution prevention through voluntary, non-regulatory ' partnerships with academia, industry, other government agencies, and non-governmental organizations. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promotes green chemistry as overseen by the OPPT. The California Green Chemistry Initiative moves beyond voluntary partnerships and voluntary information disclosure to require industry reporting and public disclosure.  Overview  The United States Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs most important law to regulate the production, use and disposal of chemicals is the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 (TSCA). Over the years, TSCA has fallen behind the industry it is supposed to regulate and is an inadequate tool for providing the protection against today‚Äôs chemical risks. Green chemistry represents a major paradigm shift in industrial manufacturing as it is a proactive ‚Äúcradle-to-cradle‚Äù approach that focuses environmental protection at the design stage of production processes. In 2008, California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed two joined bills, AB 1879 and SB 507, which created California‚Äôs Green Chemistry Initiative (CGCI). AB 1879 increases regulatory authority over chemicals in consumer products. The law established an advisory panel of scientists, known as the green ribbon science panel, to guide research in chemical policy, create regulations for assessing alternatives, and set up an internet database of research on toxins. SB 509 was designed to ensure that information regarding the hazard traits, toxicological and environmental endpoints, and other vital data is available to the public, to businesses, and to regulators in a Toxics Information Clearinghouse. This legislation marks the biggest leap forward in California chemicals policy in nearly two decades and is intended to improve the health and safety of all Californians by providing the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) with the authority to control toxic substances in consumer products. The bills were scheduled to go into regulatory affect January 1, 2011 with the adoption of the Green Chemistry Initiative. California has postponed the initiative, indefinitely, due to concerns raised by stakeholders and more specifically, controversial last minute changes in the final draft. The final or third draft contains substantial revisions, including scaled back manufacturer and retailer compliance requirements that were not well received by the environmental community. Assemblyman Mike Feur and several authors of AB 1879, assert that last minute changes by the California DTSC have drastically weakened the Green Chemistry Initiative and limited its scope. They are most concerned with the change to require the state to prove that a chemical is harmful before being regulated, mirroring what is currently required at the Federal level by TSCA. The original draft advocated a precautionary principle, or ‚Äúcradle-to-cradle‚Äù approach. Environmentalists fear that CGCI will not remove chemicals off the shelves, but instead will create ‚Äúparalysis by analysis‚Äù as companies litigate against the DTSC over unfavorable decisions.  Physical and social causes = Traditional methods of dealing with wastes  Society historically managed its industrial and municipal wastes by disposal or incineration. Chemical regulation occurs only after a product is identified as hazardous. This problem-specific approach has led to the release of thousands of potentially harmful chemicals in our environment. Chemical regulation is a continuous game of catch up, in which banned chemicals are replaced with new chemicals that may be just as or more toxic. Many environmental laws are still based on the industrial production model of cradle-to-grave. The term ‚Äúcradle-to-grave‚Äù is used to describe and assess the life-cycle of products, from raw material extraction through materials processing, manufacture, distribution, use and disposal. This traditional approach to chemicals management has serious environmental drawbacks because it does not consider what happens to a product after it is disposed of. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976, exemplifies a cradle- to-grave management approach of hazardous waste. RCRA has been largely ineffective because its emphasis is on dealing with waste after it has been created; meanwhile emphasis on waste reduction is minimal. Waste does not disappear, it is simply transported elsewhere. Costly and burdensome hazardous waste disposal in the US has encouraged the exportation of hazardous waste to poor counties and developing nations willing to accept the waste for a fee. The Green Chemistry initiative instead employs a cradle-to-cradle approach, representing a major paradigm shift in environmental policy and provides a proactive solution to toxic waste. The Earth‚Äôs capacity to accept toxic waste is practically nonexistent. The disposal of hazardous wastes is not the root problem but rather, the root symptom. The critical issue is the creation of toxic wastes. Requiring manufacturers to consider chemical exposure during manufacturing, throughout product use and after disposal, encourages the production of safer products.  Consumption and wastes  By the time we find a product on a market shelf, 90% of the resources used to create that product was regarded as waste.Presentation at SFSU by Crisitine Lueng, Natural Resource Defense Council, March 2011 This accounts for about 136 pounds of resources a week consumed by the average American and 2,000 pounds of waste support that consumption. As the population grows and the economy expands more and more products will be created, consumed, and disposed. Many negative externalities are related to the environmental consequences of production and use, including air pollution, anthropogenic climate change and water pollution. Under the current cycle of production, toxic chemical byproducts will continue to be produced and unleashed on our environment. It is important to carefully consider how toxic wastes are created in order to forgo the possibility of a world that is unsuitable for human life.  Transparency issues  One of the biggest failures in market transactions is the imbalance of information that is provided to consumer via producer. ‚ÄúInformation asymmetry‚Äù is an economic concept that is used to explain this failure: it deals with the study of decisions in transactions where one party has more or better information than the other. Due to a lack of information transparency, the public may lack vital information about the health and safety of products found on supermarket shelves. This lack of information may have led to a reversed purchasing decision. Yet without such labeling, consumers must make assumptions based on things like price or expertise. For example, one apple juice brand may be assumed healthier because it cost more and because the brand is advertised as ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù and ‚Äúrecommended by mothers‚Äù. Further, it may be assumed that the product is safe for consumption if it is sitting on a grocery store shelf and probably would not be approved by the government if it contained harmful chemicals. Assumptions such as these could inform a typical purchasing decision, despite their inaccuracy. Perhaps given more information, the same brand of apple juice would be less desirable if information on unhealthy preservatives, additives or pesticide residues was easily obtained. To make market transactions more efficient, the government could force more accurate labeling about products, laws could require companies to be more transparent, and the government could require that advertising be less persuasive and more informative. The Green Chemistry Initiative of California would address transparency issues by creating a public chemical inventory and requiring more stringent regulation of chemicals that may be toxic. The CGCI Draft Report suggests a green labeling system to identify consumer products with ingredients harmful to human health and the environment.  Stakeholder involvement  The United States is the world leader in chemicals manufacturing. As a multibillion-dollar industry, the chemical industry has a leading role in the US economy and because of this, a high level of influence in federal decision-making. Central to the modern world economy, it converts raw materials (oil, natural gas, air, water, metals, and minerals) into more than 70,000 different products. The chemical industry‚Äîproducers of chemicals, household cleansers, plastics, rubber, paints and explosives, keeps a watchful eye on issues including environmental and health policy, taxes and trade. The industry is often the target of environmental groups, which charge that chemicals and chemical waste are polluting the air and water supply. And like most industries with pollution problems, chemical manufacturers oppose meddlesome government regulations that make it more difficult and expensive for them to do business. So do most Republicans, which is why this industry gives nearly three-fourths of its campaign contributions to the GOP. In addition to campaign contributions to elected officials and candidates, companies, labor unions, and other organizations spend billions of dollars each year to lobby Congress and federal agencies. Some special interests retain lobbying firms, many of them located along Washington's legendary K Street; others have lobbyists working in-house. According to website Opensecrets, the total number of clients lobbying for the chemical industry in 2010 was 143, which is the highest number in history. The first group on this list, American Chemistry Council spent $8,130,000 lobbying last year and Crop America, which comes second, spent $2,291,859 lobbying last year, FMC Corporation spent $1,230,000 and Koch Industries spent $8,070,000. The Chemical Industry wants limited testing of chemicals, more lengthy and costly studies of chemicals already proven to be dangerous, and an assumption that we are only exposed to one chemical at a time, and from one source at a time. According to Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families, a broad coalition of groups, including major environmental organizations like the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Defense Fund, health organizations like the Learning Disabilities Association, Breast Cancer Fund, and the Autism Society of America, health professionals and providers like the American Nurses Association, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, and the Mt. Sinai Children's Environmental Health Center, and concerned parents groups like MomsRising: there is growing national momentum and pressure to change the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), our federal system for overseeing chemical safety, which has not been updated in thirty-five years. Polling data indicates overwhelming support for chemical regulation nationwide. According to polling data conducted by the Mellman Group, 84% say that \\"tightening controls\\" on chemical regulation is important, with 50% of those calling it \\"very important.‚Äù Public Health Advocates want public disclosure of safety information for all chemicals in use, prompt action to phase out or reduce the most dangerous chemicals, deciding safety based on real world exposure to all sources of toxic chemicals.  History  In 2008, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger signed two state bills authorizing the state to identify toxic chemicals in industry and consumer products and analyze alternatives. AB 1879, written by Assemblyman Mike Feur, a Los Angeles Democrat, requires the state Department of Toxic Substances Control to assess chemicals and prioritize the most toxic for possible restrictions or bans. The environmental policy council, made up of heads of all state environmental protection agency boards and departments will oversee the program. SB 509, by Senator Joe Simitian, a Palo Alto Democrat, creates an online toxics information clearinghouse with information about the hazards of thousands of chemicals used in California. These bills are intended to put an end to chemical-by-chemical bans and remove harmful products at the design stage. The regulations are expected to motivate manufacturers of consumer products containing chemicals of concern to seek safer alternatives. Supporters of the bill include the California Association of Professional Scientists, the Chemical Industry Council of California, DuPont, BIOCOM, Grocery Manufacturers Association, the Breast Cancer Fund, Catholic Healthcare West, in addition to a broad array of environmental groups such as the Coalition for Clean Air, the Environmental Defense Fund, the Natural Resources Defense Council. The American Electronics Association (AEA) and Ford spoke in opposition to the bill, each requesting an exemption from its provisions. Also opposing were environmental justice advocates who indicated the bill did not go far enough. Meanwhile, large trade associations such as Consumer Specialty Products Association, Western States Petroleum Association, American Chemistry Council, CA Manufacturers and Technology Association, and CA Chamber of Commerce officially withdrew opposition to the measures. Due to outdated and inefficient or otherwise voluntary chemical regulation at the Federal level, the State of California has decided to take regulation into its own hands and develop stricter, environmentally-informed methodologies for dealing with the production of toxic wastes. California's economy is the largest of any state in the US, and is the eighth largest economy in the world. This position gives California an advantage when it comes to environmental standards: the impact of chemical regulation statewide can have a broader impact nationwide if manufacturers desire to stay competitive in California‚Äôs market. The Green Chemistry Initiative forces statewide industries to comply with greener standards of production, which may spark innovation on a wider basis. The Green Chemistry initiative aims to regulate the creation and use of materials hazardous to human health and the environment by encouraging innovative design and manufacturing, and ultimately safer consumer product alternatives. To develop the regulatory framework, DTSC held a number of stakeholder and public workshops and invited direct public participation in the drafting of regulations on a wiki website. DTSC reportedly received over 57,000 comments and over 800 regulatory suggestions. Regulatory suggestions included industry assessments of risk and safety, alternative chemicals and life-cycle assessments and mandatory industry reporting, full public disclosure of substances contained in products, a green labelling program that would inform consumers of the potential health and environmental impacts of the chemicals contained in products and a mandated surcharge on chemicals and products to support a fund to address environmental problems. In December 2008, DTSC announced six policy recommendations for the Green Chemistry Initiative. In brief, those recommendations are: # expand pollution prevention # develop green chemistry workforce education and training, research and development, technology transfer # online product ingredient network # online toxics clearing house # accelerate the quest for safer products # move toward cradle to cradle economy Two of the six recommendations from this report were adopted: AB 1879 requires the DTSC to implement regulations to identify and prioritize chemicals of concern, evaluate alternatives, and specify regulatory responses where chemicals are found in products. SB 509 requires an online, public toxics information clearinghouse that includes science-based information on the toxicity and hazard traits of chemicals used in daily life. Essentially the recommended policy methods include authority tools that would regulate the approval on new chemicals in a more cautious manner as well as mandate the decimation of information, as provided by manufacturers to the public; innovation would be encouraged under this paradigm to replace harmful chemicals with greener alternatives and the California government would fund programs to help industries produce greener chemicals. Secondly, capacity or learning tools would be provided to the public in the form of the online database, giving the tools so that they have better ability to make market decisions that reflect their interests.  Criticism  Environmentalists say the amended regulations won't remove toxic products from the shelves and will create \\"paralysis by analysis,\\" as industries can litigate against DTSC over unfavorable department decisions. Activists say California was poised to lead the way on toxics regulation but now is faced with potentially one of the weakest chemical- regulatory mechanisms in the nation. According to CHANGE (Californians for a Healthy & Green Economy), the revised regulation is a betrayal of the Green Chemistry promise and ignores two years of public input, while caving to backroom industry lobbying. Furthermore, it is a betrayal to public interest groups, businesses, and residents of California and legislators who supported the intent of this bill, to protect Californians and spur a healthy, innovative green economy. Environmentalists say the toxics department gutted the initiative at the behest of the chemical industry, and then put out the changes for public comment during a 15-day period just before Thanksgiving. This was a violation of the law requiring a 45-day public comment period when a substantial reworking of state regulations is proposed. The new Director of California's Department of Toxic Substance Control, Debbie Raphael, announced that mid-October 2011 is the new target date for new draft regulations to implement California's Green Chemistry Law and new draft guidelines were issued October 31, 2011. The public comment period for the latest version of the draft regulations ends December 30, 2011. Implementation of CGCI has been delayed indefinitely beyond the January 1, 2011 deadline due to issues that arose after public review of the third draft. The third draft, which was made public December 2010, contains substantial revisions, including scaled back manufacturer and retailer compliance requirements that were not well received by the environmental community. DTSCs newest draft has made the following changes: * All references of nanotechnology are excluded (nano referring to materials with dimensions of 1,000 nanometers or smaller); this change is significant because it would have been considered the most significant attempt to regulate nanomaterials based on environmental or health impacts. * The new draft redefines ‚Äúresponsible entities,‚Äù which originally referred to the entire business chain of consumer products distribution, including manufacturers, brand name owners, importers, distributors, and retailers, ‚Äúresponsible entities is now limited to manufacturers and retailers . * DTSC prioritizes Children‚Äôs products, personal care products and household products until 2016, after that point all consumer products. * The new proposed regulations also eliminate the requirement that the DTSC develop a list of chemicals of consideration and products under consideration. * New timeline for implementation of regulations  References  Category:Green chemistry Category:Pollution in the United States ","title":"California Green Chemistry Initiative"},{"id":"31677002","text":"James Weldon Demmel Jr. (born October 19, 1955) is an American mathematician and computer scientist, the Dr. Richard Carl Dehmel Distinguished Professor of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley.

In 1825 he was commissioned as an ensign in the 16th Infantry regiment stationed in D√ºsseldorf. Between 1843 and 1857 Fransecky served in the Historical division of the Prussian general staff. He fought in the war against Denmark in 1848, serving in Schleswig. In 1860 von Fransecky was attached to Oldenburg where he commanded an Oldenburgian infantry regiment. In November 1864 he was promoted to major-general and later to lieutenant-general. He was given command of the 7th Division stationed in Magdeburg. In the Austro-Prussian War he distinguished himself at M√ºnchengr√§tz and K√∂niggr√§tz, for which he was given the Pour le M√©rite. Between 1867 and 1869 von Fransecky served as inspector of the Saxon army. In 1870 von Fransecky became the commanding general of the Prussian 2nd Corps. During the Franco-Prussian War the Prussian 2nd Corps was part of the German 2nd army commanded by Prince Friedrich Karl. Fransecky distinguished himself at Gravelotte, where he reached the battlefield after a 16-hour forced march. After Gravelotte, 2nd Corps was part of the troops besieging Metz. After the fall of Metz Fransecky and 2nd Corps were sent to Paris. During the Siege of Paris Fransecky was given command of the troops between Seine and Marne. On 2 December 1870 Ducrot tried to break through the German ring at Villiers but the sortie was stopped by troops under Fransecky. In January 1871 2nd Corps was detached from the siege and placed under command of Edwin von Manteuffel's newly formed Army of the South. Under Manteuffel's command Fransecky took part in the operations in the C√¥te-d'Or and Jura against Bourbaki's Arm√©e de l'Est. After Bourbaki's forces were defeated at Pontarlier and forced over the Swiss border, Fransecky was given command of 14th Corps in Strassbourg and awarded the Oak Leaves to his Pour le M√©rite on 5 February 1871. After the war he was given a dotation of 150.000 thaler. In 1879 he was made governor of Berlin. He resigned as governor due to health reasons in 1882. Eduard von Francecky died in 1890 in Wiesbaden.

History=Gentleman farmer, legal and aristocratic links Captain William Middleton (died 1940) and his brother Richard Noel Middleton (died 1951) both married at Mill Hill Chapel, Mrs. William Middleton being the first cousin of Albert Kitson, 2nd Baron Airedale whose wife, Baroness Airedale, was the second cousin of Mrs Noel Middleton. By the late Georgian era, the Middleton family were established in the West Riding of Yorkshire as cultural and civic figures, particularly in the legal profession. The law firm, Messrs Middleton and Sons, was founded in Leeds in 1834 by gentleman farmer and solicitor William Middleton Esq. of Gledhow Grange Estate (died 1884). A grandson of William Middleton was Oxford University graduate and solicitor Henry Dubs Middleton who was chairman of the Leeds General Infirmary. Henry's son was Cecil Middleton who played first-class cricket for Oxford University Cricket Club in 1933. Cecil Middleton's grandfather was Sir Henry Hanson Berney, 9th Baronet.England and Wales Birth Registration Index, 1837‚Äì2005, September 1911, Middleton, Cecil, mother's maiden name Berney, Leeds district, vol 9b, p. 514Burke's Peerage 2003 Volume 1, p. 358. William Middleton's descendants also include his grandson Richard Noel Middleton, a solicitor who was one of the founders of the Yorkshire Symphony Orchestra. Richard Noel's son was Captain Peter Middleton, who was Prince Philip's co-pilot on a tour of South America. Peter Middleton's son is entrepreneur Michael Francis Middleton whose children are: Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, socialite and columnist Pippa Middleton and businessman James Middleton. Members of the Middleton family were described as \\"aristocracy\\" and \\"friends of British royalty\\" to whom, in their civic capacity, they \\"played host as long ago as 1926\\". The great-grandfather of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Richard Noel Middleton, and his elder brother William Middleton reportedly wed their fianc√©es in Leeds at Mill Hill Chapel in the years before the First World War. \\"Mrs William Middleton\\" was the niece of James Kitson, 1st Baron Airedale, who led the chapel's congregation at this time and \\"Mrs Noel Middleton\\" was the second cousin of Florence, 2nd Baroness Airedale. John William Middleton, Esq. (1839‚Äì1887) President of the Leeds Law Society (1882‚Äì1883) Family law and woollen manufacturing firms The relatives of Michael Middleton (born 1949, father of the Duchess of Cambridge) were solicitors in the Leeds-based family firm, Messrs Middleton and Sons. His grandfather Richard Noel Middleton, great- grandfather John William Middleton, Esq. (1839‚Äì1887), and great-great- grandfather William Middleton were solicitors. The family law firm which William Middleton established in 1834 existed for over 150 years, closing in 1985. Richard Noel Middleton was also one of the founders of the Yorkshire Symphony Orchestra and a director of William Lupton and Co., the textile manufacturing firm his wife, Olive, had inherited in 1921. Michael Middleton's niece, Lucy Middleton, is a solicitor and a godparent of Prince Louis.  Political connections  Michael Middleton's great-grandfather, politician Francis Martineau Lupton, was the first cousin of Sir Thomas Martineau, whose nephew was Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. The Martineaus came from a Huguenot immigrant background, and were noted in the medical, intellectual and business fields. At a political event hosted by members of the Leeds and County (Liberal) Unionist Club at Leeds Town Hall on 27 September 1894, Liberal Unionist Francis Martineau Lupton entertained his relative Joseph Chamberlain who would be Secretary of State for the Colonies within a few months. Francis Martineau's cousin, politician and mayor of Birmingham, Sir Thomas Martineau, was Joseph Chamberlain's brother-in-law. Michael Francis Middleton Michael Middleton, the father of the Duchess of Cambridge, was born in 1949 into a wealthy family with ties to the British aristocracy. His family had entertained members of the British royal family in Leeds from the 1920s. Shortly before his daughter married Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, in April 2011, he was granted a coat of arms as the armigerous head of the family. Michael Middleton was born on 23 June 1949 in Leeds, where he spent his early years in Moortown. His father, Captain Peter Middleton (1920‚Äì2010), was a pilot who flew alongside Prince Philip as co-pilot on a two-month flying tour of South America in 1962. British Path√© newsreel film shows Middleton alongside the prince during the tour. Michael Middleton has an older brother, Richard, whose son Adam Middleton is godfather to Catherine's daughter, Princess Charlotte. Michael has two younger brothers, Nicholas and Simon.  Education and early career  Clifton College the boarding school for generations of Middleton men Like his father, Peter, and grandfather Noel, Michael Middleton was educated at Clifton College, the public school in Bristol. At Clifton, all three generations of Middleton men boarded at Brown's House. The archives at Clifton record that Michael Middleton was a praepostor, the title for a college prefect. Middleton represented Clifton at rugby in the 1st XV and also gained his tennis colours. Middleton alma mater, Oxford University, New College, Hall Following Clifton, Michael Middleton attended the University of Surrey who conferred the degree of B.Sc (Hons) on him in 1973 according to the entry in the Clifton College Register 1962‚Äì1978, published by Clifton College Council in October 1979 with an introduction by then Headmaster and academic historian, Stuart M. Andrews. Middleton then commenced studies for six months at British European Airways' flight school to become a pilot before switching to ground crew where he graduated from the company's own internal course. He then worked for BA as a flight dispatcher.  Marriage and family  Michael Middleton's wife, Carole, was born Carole Elizabeth Goldsmith on 31 January 1955 at Perivale Maternity Hospital in Ealing. The daughter of a builder, Ronald Goldsmith (1931‚Äì2003), and Dorothy Harrison (1935‚Äì2006), she was raised in Southall, and attended local state schools. The Middletons met when they worked for British Airways (BA) as ground crew. By 1979, Michael was promoted to aircraft dispatcher, one of British Airways' Red Caps, at London Heathrow Airport. They married on 21 June 1980 at St James's Parish Church in Dorney, Buckinghamshire. They bought a Victorian house in Bradfield Southend near Reading, Berkshire. The Middletons have three children, two daughters and a son. Following the birth of Catherine Elizabeth (born 1982) and Philippa Charlotte (born 1983), the family moved to Amman, Jordan, where Michael worked as a manager for BA from 1984 to 1987. Their youngest child, James William, was born in 1987 by which time Catherine and Pippa attended St Andrew's School, Pangbourne. Carole Middleton established Party Pieces, a company making party bags in 1987. It branched into party supplies and decorations by mail order and by 1995 was managed by both Middletons and had moved into farm buildings at Ashampstead Common. At this time the Middletons purchased Oak Acre, a Tudor-style manor house in Bucklebury, Berkshire. In 2002, the Middletons bought a flat in Chelsea, in which their children lived. Carole and Michael Middleton are also the owners of a racehorse. By 2012, the Middletons had moved to Bucklebury Manor, a Georgian mansion with an 18-acre estate where their grandson Prince George spent his first few weeks.Party Pieces Princess in News of the World (21 November 2010), p. 4 The Middletons' business was successful, and along with trust funds inherited by Michael Middleton, enabled the family to send their children to independent schools. All three children were sent to St Andrew's School, Pangbourne and both daughters were sent to Downe House, a girls' boarding school in Cold Ash and Marlborough College, Wiltshire. James also attended Marlborough. Shortly before his elder daughter's marriage, Michael Middleton was granted a coat of arms featuring three acorn sprigs, one for each of his children. The oak represents England and strength as well as the family's home district of West Berkshire. The white chevronels symbolise peaks and mountains, said to represent the family's love of the Lake District and skiing, and the gold chevron represents Carole Middleton's maiden name of Goldsmith. The British press created the term Upper Middleton Class to describe the family's social position; other reports refer to the family as being \\"minted ... with a smattering of blue-blooded antecedents\\". Children of Michael and Carole Middleton=Catherine The Middletons' first daughter, Catherine, now the Duchess of Cambridge, was born on 9 January 1982. A boarder at St Andrew's School, Pangbourne and Marlborough College, she graduated from the University of St Andrews. It was here, while living at St Salvator's Hall, that she met Prince William. After a long relationship and a six-month engagement, she married Prince William at Westminster Abbey on 29 April 2011. In December 2012, it was announced that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were expecting their first child. Catherine gave birth to a son, Prince George of Cambridge, on 22 July 2013, who is third in line to the throne. Her second pregnancy was announced on 8 September 2014, and she gave birth to a daughter, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, on 2 May 2015, who is fourth in line to the throne. Her third pregnancy was announced on 4 September 2017, and she gave birth to her second son, Prince Louis of Cambridge on 23 April 2018, who is fifth in line to the throne. Philippa Pippa Middleton in 2013 The Middletons' second daughter, Philippa \\"Pippa\\", born on 6 September 1983, attended the same schools as her siblings and studied English literature at the University of Edinburgh. There she shared a house with Lord Ted Innes- Ker, a son of the Duke of Roxburghe, and George Percy. Following graduation in 2008 she took an events management / marketing job with Table Talk, a London- based events catering company.Welcome to the Firm at channel4.com. Retrieved 4 January 2011 She has written for The Spectator, Waitrose Magazine, the Daily Telegraph, Vanity Fair and The Party Times, an online magazine which is an offshoot of her parents' company. In July 2016, she became engaged to hedge fund manager and former racing driver James Matthews, eldest son of David Matthews, the Laird of Glen Affric. If he inherits his father's lairdship, Pippa will be accorded the courtesy title, Lady Glen Affric. Pippa Middleton and James Matthews were married on 20 May 2017, at St Mark's Church, at Englefield Estate, Berkshire, near Bucklebury Manor, the Middleton family home. In June 2018, Pippa announced she was pregnant with her first child. Her son Arthur Michael William Matthews was born on 15 October 2018. James James, the Middletons' youngest child and only son, was born on 15 April 1987. He was educated from age four at St Andrew's School, Pangbourne, and at Marlborough College. He started a degree in Environmental Resources Management at the University of Edinburgh but left in 2006 after a year to start a cake- making business. His company Boomf employed over 100 people at peak periods in 2016. In September 2018, James was reportedly hosting deer stalking parties at the 10,000 acre Scottish estate of James Matthews, Laird of Glen Affric, James's brother-in-law. Pippa was a bridesmaid and James read the lesson at their sister's wedding. Parents of Michael Middleton Michael Middleton's father was commercial pilot and RAF officer Capt. Peter Francis Middleton (1920‚Äì2010). His boyhood in Leeds saw Peter Middleton share a governess with his second cousins, brothers Arthur Ralph Ransome Lupton and Dr Francis Hugh Lupton , both nephews of Arthur Ransome. Dr Francis Lupton's 2001 book, The Next Generation: A Sequel to The Lupton Family in Leeds by C.A. Lupton contains Middleton's memoirs. Middleton boarded at Clifton College and then studied English at New College, Oxford. After leaving in 1940 Middleton served as a RAF fighter pilot during the Second World War. Commissioned as a pilot officer (on probation) in the RAFVR on 9 March 1941, he was confirmed in his rank and promoted to flying officer (war-substantive) on 9 March 1942. In May 1942, he was posted to No 37 Service Flying School in Calgary, Canada where he spent two-and-a-half years as an instructor, training Spitfire, Hurricane and Lancaster pilots, receiving a promotion to flight lieutenant (war-substantive) on 9 March 1943. After joining the reservist 605 Squadron at Manston, near Ramsgate in Kent, in August 1944, Middleton flew a de Havilland Mosquito fighter bomber, nudging the wings of unmanned German V1 flying aircraft to divert them from hitting London. After the war, Middleton joined British European Airways as a pilot, but remained in the reconstituted RAFVR, receiving a reserve commission as a flying officer on 12 August 1949. Promoted to flight lieutenant on 1 March 1951, he relinquished his reserve commission on 12 August 1959. On a two-month tour of South America in 1962, Prince Philip piloted 49 of the tour's 62 flights with Peter Middleton as his co-pilot. He sent Middleton a letter of thanks and a pair of gold cufflinks. British Pathe newsreel captured Middleton and Prince Philip during the tour. Middleton met his granddaughter's fianc√©, Prince William, on his 90th birthday and William attended Middleton's funeral in November 2010. A memorial at Bletchley Park commemorates Valerie Middleton's work there as a code-breaker. Michael's mother, Valerie Glassborow (1924‚Äì2006) was the daughter of bank manager Frederick Glassborow and Constance Robinson. She had a twin sister, Mary. Both sisters were born in Marseille and grew up in France. They were bilingual. Valerie attended an English boarding school and later studied at a private secretarial college. Valerie Middleton served as a VAD nurse during the Second World War and in August 2020, in commemoration of the British Red Cross, her granddaughter, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, shared a \\"personal family photo\\" of her grandmother wearing her British Red Cross uniform. Valerie Middleton worked at the Second World War Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS;) in Bletchley Park where a memorial commemorates her work as a code- breaker. Codebreaking penetrated the secret communications of the Axis Powersmost importantly the German Enigma and Lorenz ciphers and is the birthplace of the world's first programmable, digital, electronic computer: Colossus. Her Bletchley Park colleague and friend, Lady Body (n√©e Marion Graham), recalled in 2014 that she had shared a \\"rather special moment\\" with Valerie: \\"Our superior officer, Commander Williams, came into the room smiling and he said, 'Well done, girls. A signal has been intercepted from Tokyo to Geneva and it's the signal that the Japanese are surrendering'. He told us that a message has gone to the King and the Prime Minister but that it could not be announced until Geneva has sent on the message to London.\\" Newsreports from December 1947 record that Peter and Valerie Middleton were amongst the invited guests to the christening in Leeds of their niece, Matita Glassborow whose great-greataunt, Dame Ellen Terry \\"was born a century ago in 1847\\". Grandparents of Michael Middleton Heiress Olive Christiana Middleton Michael Middleton's grandmother Trust funds had been established from the fortunes of Michael Middleton's grandmother heiress Olive Middleton (1881‚Äì1936), a member of the Lupton family. Olive was a boarder at Roedean and was accepted to study at Cambridge University. Olive's husband was Richard Noel Middleton (1878‚Äì1951), a solicitor who had \\"met and married the aristocrat\\" at the Mill Hill Chapel in Leeds in 1914. In 1919, Middleton retired as a solicitor from the legal practice in Leeds he shared with partner Sir William Henry Clarke who was a City of Leeds councillor alongside Olive's father. In 1921, Richard Noel Middleton became a director of the company his wife had inherited from her father. Members of the Lupton family owned the Newton Park and Beechwood estates in Leeds, the latter being the family seat where, for decades, the \\"whole family would gather\\". The Lupton family are described in the Leeds City Council's photographic archive as \\"woollen manufacturers and landed gentry a political and business dynasty\\"; Olive's cousin, Baroness von Schunck (n√©e Kate Lupton) had been invited to the coronation of King George V in 1911. Olive Middleton's cousin Baroness Airedale at the coronation of George V; the two cousins worked together for the war effort during the Great War Olive Middleton's family had contributed to the political life of both the UK and to the civic life of Leeds, especially in the areas of education, housing, and public health, for several generations. Olive Middleton's father was a landowner and also a lead magistrate; addressed as Sir, Francis Martineau Lupton dealt with probate matters for the Leeds and West Riding Court. The 1899 House of Commons Parliamentary Papers record Lupton as being instrumental in establishing a Parliamentary inquiry into the Religious Education for Dissenting Protestants. A \\"society beauty\\", in June 1914, Olive - \\"Mrs Middleton\\" - and her sister Anne were reported as guests at the Trinity College, Cambridge First and Third Boat Club Ball during Cambridge University's May Week. Newsreports from 1935 record that \\"Mrs Noel Middleton\\", her husband, their sons, Christopher and Tony Middleton and their Kitson family relatives arrived as \\"the Kitson party\\" when attending the Leeds Arts Ball. Olive Middleton was reportedly a guest at the 1931 Leeds Lady Mayoress First Civic \\"At Home\\" which she attended with Lady Clarke, wife of her husband's former legal partner. Both Sir William and Lady Clarke were presidents of the Leeds Conservative Association, the political party which invited Olive's uncle Hugh to become Lord Mayor in 1926. Olive Middleton's family the Luptons were prominent Unitarians and worshipped at Leeds' Mill Hill Chapel where they are commemorated in stained glass windows.Mill Hill Chapel History on the church website.Mill Hill Chapel History Nurse Olive Middleton, back row far right, in 1915 at Gledhow Hall, the estate of her cousin Baroness AiredaleDuring the First World War, Olive Middleton worked for the war effort at Gledhow Hall, the home of her second cousin, Florence, Baroness Airedale which was used as a VAD hospital, with Olive's cousin, The Hon. Doris Kitson and sister-in-law, Gertrude Middleton, as volunteer nurses. Olive remained involved with the VAD cause for many years; \\"Mr. and Mrs. Noel Middleton\\" and Lady Moynihan were amongst the guests reported at a garden party held in 1934 in aid of VAD nurses raising funds for the Leeds General Infirmary. The party was hosted by Olive Middleton's relatives, former Leeds Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress Mr. and Mrs. F.J. Kitson whose home, Gledhow Grove later became Chapel Allerton Hospital. Olive Middleton's brother, Lionel Lupton attended Trinity College, Cambridge, at the same time as Diana, Princess of Wales's grandfather Albert Spencer, 7th Earl Spencer, where both men studied the same subject. The two men joined up together to fight in the Great War which saw Lionel and his two brothers killed. In April 1917, King George V \\"commanded\\" that a letter be written to the brothers' father in which the King recognised the exceptional loss of \\"your gallant\\" sons. Newton Park and Beechwood Estates Potternewton Hall Estate near Leeds was a family seat for generations of Michael Middleton's ancestors, including his grandmother, Olive Middleton (n√©e Lupton) Beechwood Estate, RoundhayOlive Middleton's father, Francis Martineau Lupton, was the eldest son and heir of Francis Lupton and grew up initially on the family's Newton Park Estate and then their Georgian Beechwood Estate, in Roundhay. Whereas the family eventually sub-divided Newton Park, the Beechwood estate was entailed to Olive's eldest brother, Francis Ashford Lupton who lacked a male heir. His death on 26 February 1917 followed the deaths of his two brothers all First World War casualties. Their father's death occurred in 1921. Their sisters Anne Lupton and Olive Middleton were prohibited from inheriting Beechwood and the estate succeeded to their father's brother, Arthur G. Lupton. Arthur's only son, Major Arthur Michael Lupton, tragically died in 1929 following an accident on his horse the previous year whilst fox hunting on the Bramham Moor Hunt and Beechwood passed to his only son, Tom Lupton. As Tom was only nine at the time of his father's death, his aunts, Elinor and Elizabeth (Bessie) Lupton \\"The Misses Lupton\\" were granted a life interest in Beechwood and continued to live there, occasionally opening their gardens to the public. After their deaths, (Elizabeth in 1977, Elinor in 1979), their nephew, Tom, inherited Beechwood and in 2016, Tom's children retain some of the Beechwood Estate. City of Leeds dignitaries On 2 September 1914, Leeds Lord Mayor Lord Brotherton announced that the Leeds City Council would be raising a new battalion; the Leeds Pals. His committee was composed of \\"City dignitaries\\" including Olive Middleton's father, Alderman Francis Martineau Lupton and his brother Arthur G. Lupton. The following year, they were filmed inspecting the Pals troops alongside their brother Leeds Lord Mayor Sir Charles Lupton. Olive Middleton's first cousin, Leeds Lady Mayoress Elinor Lupton, played host to the Princess Royal which included attending a music concert together in Leeds on 27 May 1943. Elinor shared great- grandparents with Beatrix Potter who had given Elinor her own hand-drawn watercolour Christmas cards. Both Elinor and her sister died as spinsters. Two of Olive Middleton's uncles were Lord Mayors of Leeds: Hugh Lupton and Sir Charles Lupton who was Deputy Lieutenant of Yorkshire County (West Riding) when Princess Mary's father-in-law, Henry Lascelles, 5th Earl of Harewood, was his Lord Lieutenant. In 2018, Olive Middleton's great-granddaughter, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, stated that her patronage of the Nursing Now campaign meant a lot to her personally as both her great-grandmother, Olive Middleton, and grandmother, Valerie Middleton, were volunteer nurses. Ancestry of Michael Middleton Francis W. Lupton, Esq. (died 1884) great great grandfather of Michael MiddletonMichael Middleton's great grandfather politician Francis Martineau Lupton was the son of Francis Lupton, Esq., whose marriage to Frances Greenhow on 1 July 1847 is listed in The Patrician John Burke's supplement to Burke's Peerage. Frances Lupton was a pioneer of girls' education who co-founded Leeds Girls' High School. Her maternal family was the Martineau family of Norwich and later, Birmingham; her aunt, the sociologist Harriet Martineau was especially close to her. London's National Portrait Gallery, holds nearly 20 portraits of Middleton's ancestors; siblings Harriet and Dr James Martineau, a friend of Queen Victoria. The Rev. Thomas Davis, a Church of England hymn-writer is Michael Middleton's paternal ancestor. Michael Middleton's family tree is linked, via his Leeds-born cousin, Lady Bullock (n√©e Barbara Lupton), to William Petty-FitzMaurice, 1st Marquess of Lansdowne, Prime Minister of Great Britain in 1782‚Äì1783. Through his direct ancestor, Dame Anne Fairfax (n√©e Gascoigne), Michael Middleton has several descents from King Edward III. According to genealogists Patrick Cracroft- Brennan and Anthony Adolph, Michael Middleton's children descend, via their mother, from Elizabeth Plantagenet, King Edward IV's illegitimate daughter by Elizabeth Lucy, via Sir Thomas Blakiston Conyers, 9th Bt. of Horden, Durham. Catherine and Prince William's closest common ancestors are Sir William Blakiston of Gibside and his wife Jane Lambton, making them eleventh cousins once removed, These findings echo Christopher Challender Child's research, published in 2011. The Blakiston-Bowes Cabinet, held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, provided proof that Catherine shared ancestry with Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. Catherine and the Queen Mother share a common ancestor, County Durham's Sir William Blakiston, whose great granddaughter, Elizabeth Blakiston, married into the Bowes-Lyon family who were ancestors of the Queen Mother, n√©e Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. Reports suggest that Catherine and the Queen Mother's blood cousinship was the reason Catherine wore the Queen Mother's tiara when she wed Prince William.

Working principle  A Belt dryer / Belt cooler is a device designed for the particularly gentle thermal treatment of product. The wet product is continuously and evenly applied through an infeed chamber onto a perforated belt. The belt, predominantly in horizontal position, carries the product through the drying area which is divided into several sections. In these cells drying gas flows through or over the wet product and dries it. Each cell can be equipped with a ventilating fan and a heat exchanger. This modular design allows the drying and cooling temperatures to be controlled separately in the different sections. Thus, each dryer cell can be individually controlled and the drying / cooling air flow can be varied in each cell. In addition, the speed of the conveyor belt can be varied what gives an additional parameter for setting of drying time. The cells can be heated or cooled directly or indirectly, and all heating media, such as oil, steam, hot water or hot gas can be used. Belt dryers are ideally suited to drying almost any non-flowing product or more granular products that require a lower throughput capacity.  Design features  Belt dryers / Belt coolers are designed in modular system. Each belt dryer consists of infeed hopper, conveyor belt and discharge end. Different kinds of dryers are possible to construct, e.g. * Single-belt dryer * Multi-stage dryer * Multi-level dryer * Multi-belt dryer  Ventilation options  In general there are two ways of gas flow pattern. The drying air can flow, according to the treatment process, either through or over the product.Thier, Bernd: Apparate: Technik ‚Äì Bau ‚Äì Anwendung. 2.Ausg.

The scenario was based on a novel of Henry Dupuis-Mazuel \\"Le miracle des loups\\", published in 1924.Le Miracle des loups (1924) at the Films de France Numerous scenes were filmed at the Cit√© de Carcassonne with thousands of participants. It was also filmed in Ch√¢teau de Pierrefonds, Col de Porte, Is√®re, Le Sappey-en-Chartreuse, and in studio. Raymond Bernard was a director, screenwriter, and actor. It was a debut for Marie Glory (uncredited).  Plot  The narrative takes place in the 15th century, when Louis XI was at odds with Charles of Burgundy. The king's forces are attacked by the Burgundian troops and Beauvais must be defended until reinforcements can arrive. The defence of the city is led by Jeanne Hachette. There are realistic scenes in which wolves attack some of the opponents of Louis XI.  Production and distribution  The film was produced by the Soci√©t√© des Films Historiques (Henri Dupuy-Mazuel) and distributed by the Soci√©t√© des Etablissements L. Gaumont. The premi√®re was at the Paris Op√©ra and was attended by the President of France, the Premier and many other distinguished persons. In the USA it was distributed under the title The Miracle of the Wolves and in Germany under the title Das Wunder der W√∂lfe. In Spain it was known as El milagro de los lobos, and in Italy as Il Miracolo dei lupi. In 1930 a sound version was produced. In 1961 another film was produced with the same scenario and the same title (directed by Andr√© Hunebelle).  Reception  The film was recognised as a French equivalent of the American The Birth of a Nation (1915). The film turned its eye on a moment of French glory, the late 15th century, when a sense of national unity had yet to be forged. In France it was the most popular film of 1924. It was highly praised by the intelligentsia in France, for its realism, but it was derisively treated by American critics.Review Summary, Later it was claimed as a spectacular production. It has a reputation as one of the highpoints of French silent cinema. It belongs to the best French tradition.

Life He was the son of Henry Peckwell of Chichester. About 1764 he entered the house of an Italian silk merchant in London, with the intention of representing the firm in Italy. But he spent more of his time at George Whitefield's Tabernacle than in the counting-house, and before his term was finished he gave up his position and matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, on 17 May 1770. Peckwell attracted the notice of Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon, who made him one of her chaplains. In April 1774 the chapel in Prince's Street, Westminster, was repaired by her and opened for him. In the same year he preached the anniversary sermon at Lady Huntingdon's College at Trevecca, and later visited many places in England, preaching for the Connexion. Subsequently he was presented by Lord Robert Manners to the rectory of Bloxholm-cum-Digby in Lincolnshire, which he retained till his death. He visited Dublin around 1783, and drew large congregations in the city. Through the influence of Elizabeth Rawdon, Countess of Moira, Lady Huntingdon's eldest daughter, he was permitted to preach in the chapel of the Magdalen Institution, founded by Lady Arabella Denny, a fashionable congregation. Here he spoke out too plainly, and complaints were made. The aftermath created a breach between Lady Arabella and the Countess of Moira, and application was made to the Archbishop of Dublin to use his influence to arrest the spread of Methodism. Residing in London, he founded in 1784 an institution called ‚ÄòThe Sick Man's Friend,‚Äô for the purpose of relieving the sick poor of all denominations, as well as supplying instruction. To render himself of greater service to the work, he studied medicine. He died from the effects of a wound in his hand, inflicted upon himself while making a post- mortem examination, on 18 August 1787, at his house in St James's, Westminster. He was buried in the family vault at Chichester. In its obituary, The Times described the infection which caused his death: :\\"When the body was to be sewed up, Doctor Peckwell held the parts together, the surgeon ran the needle into his hand, which introduced some of the virus matter, or, in other words, inoculated him with putridity.\\"The Times, 23 August 1787, pg. 2 (In those days, a virus was not yet determined. The word meant poison or other noxious liquids) Peckwell published, besides sermons, A Collection of Psalms and Hymns, London, 1760? Family His daughter Selina by Thomas Lawrence (1793) Peckwell married, on 23 February 1773, Bella Blossed or Blosset of County Meath. By her he had a son, Robert Henry, and a daughter, Selina Mary (named after her godmother, the Countess of Huntingdon). Robert Henry adopted the surname Blosset and became Chief Justice of Bengal. Selina, in 1793, married George Grote, the banker, and became the mother of George Grote and Arthur Grote. His widow died in her house in Wilmot Street, Brunswick Square, on 28 November 1816.

The biblical accounts suggest that Ishmael ben Nethaniah‚Äôs actions were a key factor in the subsequent flight of the people of Judah to Egypt, something Jeremiah counsels strongly against (Jeremiah 42 - 43). Nonetheless, the people, led by Johanan son of Kareah, ignore his advice and depart for Egypt (Jeremiah 43:6). Ishmael‚Äôs origins Ishmael ben Nethaniah is described in 2 Kings 25:25 as the son of Nethaniah, ‚Äòson of Elishama of the royal family‚Äô. Jeremiah describes him as one of the chief officers of the (former) king Jehoiakim (Jeremiah 41:1). The assassination of Gedaliah Ishmael was a soldier, described as a ‚Äòcaptain of the forces‚Äô (2 Kings 25:23; and Jeremiah 41:3). Together with a number of other such captains, Ishmael emerges from the surrounding open country (Jeremiah 40:7) and makes his way to Mizpah, a city in Benjamin, after Gedaliah is appointed governor. Although the forces were likely to have been those dispersed by the Babylonian army after the fall of Jerusalem (2 Kings 25:5), it is possible that these ‚Äòcaptains‚Äô had become local warlords of heads of semi-autonomous militia during the intervening period. In Jeremiah‚Äôs account, Johanan son of Kareah learns of the plot, and tries to warn Gedaliah. When his warning is ignored, he urges Gedaliah, in ‚Äòprivate talks‚Äô (Jeremiah 40:15-16), to let him kill Ishmael - a request the governor refuses, believing the rumours to be a lie.

Leicester: IVP, 651 Gedaliah‚Äôs lack of political acumen in the face of the looming threat, despite his seeming desire to do the best for his beleaguered people (Jeremiah 40:9). Ishmael is described as approaching Gedaliah with ten men, and striking him down while a feast is in progress (2 Kings 25:25) ‚Äì a gross offence against prevailing customs of hospitality at the time.Harrison.

Leicester: IVP, 161 Judeans and Chaldeans with him (whether the latter are officials or soldiers is unclear ‚Äì the II Kings and Jeremiah accounts differ on this point) are also slaughtered. Jeremiah suggests Ishmael‚Äôs offence is further compounded by his slaughter of another group of men, pilgrims who arrive shortly afterwards from towns in the centre of the former kingdom of Israel, and are apparently in mourning (Jeremiah 41:7), possibly for the destruction of the Temple.Harrison.

London: Xpress Reprints (SCM Ltd), 233 All but ten of them are slaughtered and thrown into a cistern, the ten being spared because they have access to otherwise scarce food supplies (Jeremiah 41:8). After this fresh slaughter, Ishmael and his band make their way towards Ammon, with hostages from Mizpah. But before they get there, they are engaged in battle by Johanan son of Kareah at Gibeon, a place which in the time of Jeremiah already resonated with previous acts of treachery for the Israelites.Alexander, Pat and David (2002) Lion Handbook to the Bible (3rd edition). Oxford: Lion, 452. See also 2 Samuel 2:12-16 Ishmael‚Äôs band releases the hostages, but he himself escapes with eight of his men (Jeremiah 41:15). At this point he disappears from the biblical narrative. Dating Commentators are uncertain when the assassination took place, but it can be argued as happening within a year or two of Gedaliah‚Äôs appointment. It is suspected that they spared the 10 hostages because they offer access to a secret food store suggests that the rural economy has still not recovered following the Babylonian invasion, which would tend to confirm an early date. However, Robert Carroll draws attention to the feasting at Mizpah, arguing that this suggests that a degree of productivity remained ‚Äì confirmation, perhaps, that Babylon‚Äôs objective in invading Judah was removal of the king rather than devastation of the land.Carroll, Robert (1996) From Chaos to Covenant: Use of Prophecy in the Book of Jeremiah. London: Xpress Reprints (SCM Ltd), 231. See also Jeremiah 40:7-12 For other reasons (see below), he suggests a date for the assassination some five or six years after Gedaliah‚Äôs appointment.Carroll, Robert (1996) From Chaos to Covenant: Use of Prophecy in the Book of Jeremiah. London: Xpress Reprints (SCM Ltd), 232 Aftermath of the assassination The effect of Gedaliah‚Äôs assassination is to reduce the people to a state of fear ‚Äì probably out of concern at the revenge that Nebuchadnezzar would wreak for the attack (Jeremiah 41:17), though any such revenge is not clearly described in the biblical accounts. Robert Carroll has suggested that the third deportation of Judahites recorded in Jeremiah 52:6-30, probably occurring in 583/2 BC, should be tied to the assassination.Carroll, Robert (1996) From Chaos to Covenant: Use of Prophecy in the Book of Jeremiah. London: Xpress Reprints (SCM Ltd), 231 It is possible that Jeremiah himself was part of the group taken captive by Ishmael, as they are camped near Bethlehem following the rescue.Harrison. R.K. (1973) Jeremiah and Lamentations: An Introduction and Commentary. Leicester: IVP, 161 However, Robert Carroll‚Äôs study of Jeremiah sees the accounts in 40:7 ‚Äì 41:18 and chapters 42 - 43 as distinct from each other, and argues that the Deuteronomist editor of Jeremiah has woven two independent strands together to highlight the chaos that ensues when the community is without access to a prophet,Carroll, Robert (1996) From Chaos to Covenant: Use of Prophecy in the Book of Jeremiah. London: Xpress Reprints (SCM Ltd), 234-5 or, as in chapters 42 - 3, ignores his advice.Carroll, Robert (1996) From Chaos to Covenant: Use of Prophecy in the Book of Jeremiah. London: Xpress Reprints (SCM Ltd), 231, 234 The assassination may or may not have been the reason for the later commemorative fast referred to in Zechariah 7:5 and Zechariah 8:19 ‚Äì the so-called Fast of Gedalia.see also Harrison. R.K. (1973) Jeremiah and Lamentations: An Introduction and Commentary. Leicester: IVP, 161 Possible motives Some commentators have suggestedCawley, F. and A.R.Millard (1970) Article Jeremiah in New Bible Commentary (3rd Edition). Leicester: IVP, 650 ‚Äì 651; and Harrison. R.K. (1973) Jeremiah and Lamentations: An Introduction and Commentary. Leicester: IVP, 161 that Ishmael acts out of a sense of having been slighted when passed over for the governorship himself, despite being eligible by virtue of his royal familial connections. This is one possible interpretation of the statement that Ishmael slew Gedaliah ‚Äòbecause Nebuchadnezzar had appointed him governor‚Äô (Jeremiah 41:2). He may also have found Gedaliah‚Äôs confident statement that ‚Äòall will be well‚Äô under Nebuchadnezzar (Jeremiah 40:9) tantamount to treason,Cawley, F. and A.R.Millard (1970) Article Jeremiah in New Bible Commentary (3rd Edition). Leicester: IVP, 651 especially given Babylon‚Äôs earlier treatment of the royal household (Jeremiah 39:6). Robert Carroll describes the assassination as ‚Äòarmed revolt against Babylonian authority and the execution of a collaborationist‚Äô,Carroll, Robert (1996) From Chaos to Covenant: Use of Prophecy in the Book of Jeremiah. London: Xpress Reprints (SCM Ltd), 232 noting also, however, that the tale hints at a residual factionalism that had bedevilled Judah in the period before the Babylonian invasion.Carroll, Robert (1996) From Chaos to Covenant: Use of Prophecy in the Book of Jeremiah. London: Xpress Reprints (SCM Ltd), 233 However, wider political machinations also seem to have played a part. Jeremiah (though not II Kings) makes clear that Ishmael has been sent by Harrison. R.K. (1973) Jeremiah and Lamentations: An Introduction and Commentary. Leicester: IVP, 161 king Baalis of the neighbouring kingdom of Ammon to kill Gedaliah. The full name of the Ammonite king Baalis (Ba‚Äòalyi≈°a‚Äò, ‚ÄòBaal is salvation‚Äô) has been attested for the first time on a seal impression to be dated ca. 600 BC (see L. G. Herr, BA 48 [1985] 169-72Couturier, 1990, p. 293). Baalis may have seen an opportunity to grab power for himself in the power vacuum. The writer of Jeremiah clearly crafts the account to portray this as a significant motive for Ishmael‚Äôs attack, though Carroll argues that it is not Ishamel‚Äôs own reason for acting.Carroll, Robert (1996) From Chaos to Covenant: Use of Prophecy in the Book of Jeremiah.

I'm letting her know 'you're the best thing I got, but I had to go f--- around to figure it out.' It's one of those you don't know what you got till it's gone kind of things. With me, I go through this s--- every day. I'm married one day, then I'm not, but I am.\\" Music video RATT's video for ‚ÄúBest Of Me‚Äù was premiered worldwide March 22, 2010, on AOL. The video is a visual ode about today's 21st century mass media and information age overload mixed with unabridged live performance. The video also points to a bigger issue here: younger kids on the outside looking in, trying to be a part of the Ratt pack, and the overarching idea that infectious hooks can permeate all aspects of daily life. There's also family cameos, proving that not all relationships suffer because of rock 'n' roll. The video was released on March 29, 2010 on Metal Mania on VH1 Classic. The video directed by Andrew Bennett.

History=1976 Festival of Friends was started in 1976 by artist Bill Powell Jr. as an independent folk festival in Hamilton's Gage Park. Performers at the inaugural festival included Willie P. Bennett, Ray Materick, Brent Titcomb, Shirley Eikhard, Marc Jordan, Noel Harrison, Sylvia Tyson, Stan Rogers, The Good Brothers, Jesse Winchester, Ian Tamblyn, Beverly Glenn-Copeland, Raffi, Ben Mink, Jackie Washingtonhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-8eCjqWRec and Colleen Petersonhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w8kXMF6SDE. In its first year, the Festival also partnered with the neighbouring Delta Theatre, which hosted free screenings of Canadian films, as well as marathon concerts that ran from midnight until daybreak. The three-day festival was captured in a documentary film.https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/films-emc 1977-2010 Over the next 35 years, the festival continued annually in Gage Park, and evolved into a showcase for arts and music featuring musicians, crafters, and food from across the globe. Over the years Canadian singer- songwriters such as Bruce Cockburn, Ken Whiteley, Burton Cummings, Scott Merritt, Valdy, Bob Snider, Tom Wilson, Randy Bachman, Fred Eaglesmith, Jane Siberry, Ron Sexsmith and Gord Downie appeared in the bandshell. In 2007, the festival's sole focus on Canadian musicians was eased and international musical acts were added to the line-ups, such as Don McLean, Canned Heat, John Sebastian, Leon Redbone, Eric Burdon, Dr. John, Steve Earle, Richie Havens and Buckwheat Zydeco.https://festivaloffriends.ca/festival_archive.pdf After 25 years as director, Powell retired in 2000. Doug MacArthur, and Powell\`s wife Lynne directed the event until Loren Lieberman became its director in 2002, serving until his retirement in late 2016. 2011-2016 In January 2011, the Festival of Friends announced that it would be moving from its historic home in Gage Park to the Ancaster Fairgrounds. At the time, Lieberman and city councillor Bernie Morelli stated that the festival had simply outgrown the park. The exodus from Gage Park was sharply criticized by founder Powell, as well as a chorus of the festival's regular local musicians. The first year at the new location was marred by parking headaches and traffic gridlock, and the 2012 festival was hit with three days of heavy rain, but Lieberman insisted there were no plans to move the festival back to Gage Park as this would force a substantial reduction in size. \\"The location was no longer working, but the music still is,\\" he remarked in 2015. 2017-Present In October 2016, organizers announced that the festival would move back to Gage Park starting in 2017. In a statement, organizers explained that \\"the Festival of Friends was forced to move to Ancaster for a myriad of reasons ‚Äì including unresponsive leadership at city hall, as well as issues of access in Gage Park. In the past few months, changes at city hall have made it possible for the Festival of Friends to negotiate solutions to many of the concerns that necessitated our exit.\\" Many festival-goers welcomed the return and felt the Ancaster location was too out-of-the way. For his part, Lieberman admitted that Ancaster was \\"never where the festival was supposed to be.\\" The event The Festival of Friends weekend includes 25-30 musical acts on two stages. A main stage runs until 11:00pm daily. A second stage runs 12:00pm ‚Äì 6:00pm Saturday & Sunday. The event also features craft and food vendors, a beer garden, midway rides, a haunted house, an escape room and pony rides.https://www.chch.com/festival-of-friends-reveals-lineup-for-3-day-music- festival/ File:Guinness Book of Records \\"Make it 1803\\" Guitar Record Breaking Attempt.jpgGuinness World Records Attempt at Festival of Friends File:Finger 11 Performs on The Festival of Friends Stage 2009.jpgThe Festival of Friends Mainstage at Night References Category:Festivals in Hamilton, Ontario Category:Summer festivals Category:Recurring events established in 1976 Category:Music festivals in Ontario ","title":"Festival of Friends"},{"id":"31677376","text":"State Route 179 (SR 179) is a long north-south state highway in the central portion of the U.S. state of Ohio.

Sel gris (pl. sels gris, \\"gray salt\\" in French) is a coarse granular sea salt popularized by the French. Sel gris comes from the same solar evaporation salt pans as fleur de sel but is harvested differently; it is allowed to come into contact with the bottom of the salt pan before being raked, hence its gray color. Sel gris is coarser than fleur de sel but is also a moist salt, typically containing 13 percent residual moisture. Harvesting The bottom of the salt pan (French oeillet) may be composed of clay lined pools , basalt, sand, concrete, or even tile. This keeps the salt from coming into contact with the silt beneath and becoming dirty. Every few days or even daily, the harvester (French paludier) pushes or pulls the salt with a long wooden rake. This must be done carefully as the depth of the brine may be as little as ¬º inch and the clay bottom must not be penetrated at the risk of contaminating the salt. The salt is raked toward the sides of the pan where it is then shoveled into a pile and left to dry slightly before storing. 90 to 165 pounds of sel gris can be harvested in one day, whereas for fleurs de sel the daily yield is only 4.5 to 6.6 pounds. Use Because of its mineral complexity and coarse grain size, sel gris can be used both as a cooking salt and a finishing salt. Being much denser than table and kosher salt, there is a lot more salt in an equivalent volume of sel gris. Because it is a moist salt, it does not suck all the moisture out of food when used as a finishing salt, unlike kosher salt (which is designed to absorb blood and other fluids from meat). Selmeliers tend to pair sels gris with heartier foods like steak and root vegetables due to their mineral complexity. Examples Most producers of fleur de sel also produce sel gris. *Sel gris de Guerande *Sel gris de l‚Äô√éle de R√© *Sel gris de l‚ÄôIle de Noirmoutier *Grigio di Cervia *Alcochete sal grosso See also *List of edible salts References Category:Chemical oceanography Category:Edible salt Category:French cuisine ","title":"Sel gris"},{"id":"31677432","text":"In mathematics, the Vogel plane is a method of parameterizing simple Lie algebras by eigenvalues Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥ of the Casimir operator on the symmetric square of the Lie algebra, which gives a point (Œ±: Œ≤: Œ≥) of P2/S3, the projective plane P2 divided out by the symmetric group S3 of permutations of coordinates.
