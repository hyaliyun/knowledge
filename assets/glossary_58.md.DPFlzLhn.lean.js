It was screened in the main competition section of the 65th Berlin International Film Festival where it won the Silver Bear for Best Script. It won the Lumi√®res Award for Best Documentary at the 21st Lumi√®res Awards. The filmmaker has described the work as part of a triptych with Nostalgia for the Light and potentially a third film focusing on the Andes. It explores familiar Guzm√°n themes such as memory and the historical past, particularly that of history's losers rather than victors, recording some of the last surviving members of the original Alacalufe and Yaghan tribes. A departure for Guzm√°n is that it does not focus solely on Chile's past under Augusto Pinochet, as the title was partly inspired by a shirt button discovered during a 2004 investigation by Chilean judge Juan Guzm√°n on a length of rail used to weigh the bodies of Pinochet's victims dumped in the sea and partly by the button after which the Yaghan native Jemmy Button was named when taken aboard in 1830. Summary A meditation in vision and sound on the geography and history of Chile, structured around the water which permeates the country and gives life to its inhabitants, looking in particular at the fate of two persecuted groups: the indigenous people and the victims of Pinochet. Topics covered include: the far north of Chile, the most waterless place on earth, where radio telescopes in the desert discover more about the cosmos each day; a schoolfriend washed away by the sea; the genocide of the native tribes in the far south and how their way of life was destroyed; the story of Jemmy Button, taken from Tierra del Fuego to England; the efforts under Allende to rehabilitate the surviving tribespeople; the concentration camps set up under Pinochet; how inmates were tortured and how their bodies, weighted with lengths of rail, were dropped from helicopters into the Pacific; how one corpse was washed ashore; and finally how one of the lengths of rail recovered from the sea had a mother-of-pearl shirt button encrusted to it.

It was designed by architect Thomas Blair Moncrieff Wightman and built by Cheesman & Bull. It is also known as Kilroe's Flats and Morella, Carinyah, Lumtah and Neerim. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 30 March 2001.  History  Victoria Flats are understood to have been known initially as Kilroe's Flats, erected for Mrs Fanny (Frances) Kilroe. Designed by influential Brisbane architect Thomas Blair Moncrieff Wightman, they were amongst the first purpose-designed flats constructed in Brisbane. This part of Spring Hill had been surveyed into 2 acre suburban allotments in 1860. Allotment 253, which ran between Gregory Terrace (which at the time formed the town boundary) and Water Street, and included the site of the later flats, was purchased in May 1860 by William Gray of Brisbane for the sum of ¬£62. In 1863 Gray subdivided the land into 12 smaller residential subdivisions and William (later Kinross) Street. Most of the blocks lower down the hill in Spring Hollow sold quickly, but Gray retained the blocks fronting Gregory Terrace (subs 1-3 of allotment 253 -1 rood 37.6 perches). This land remained vacant until Frances Kilroe, wife of Joseph Kilroe, acquired title in September 1918. The Kilroes erected a residence, Mirrunya, on subdivision 2, and were listed as resident there in the 1919‚Äì20 Post Office Directory. Joseph Kilroe was associated with the drapery and haberdashery firm of Finney Isles & Co., and had married Fanny Elliott in Brisbane in 1895. In 1922, Mrs Kilroe made application to the Brisbane Municipal Council to erect a block of flats on Gregory Terrace, with the plans approved in November. The architect was listed as T.B.M. Wightman, and the contractors as Cheesman & Bull of Charlotte Street. The flats were erected on subdivision 1 of allotment 253, adjacent to Mirrunya, with frontages to Gregory Terrace and Kinross Street. Plans published in the Architectural and Building Journal of Queensland in June 1923 show a two- storeyed block of four flats (2 on each level), each with separate entrance, front verandah, vestibule, living room, dining room, kitchen, 2 bedrooms, rear sleeping verandah, bathroom, laundry and toilet. Details of the street fencing were also included. The flats were completed by mid-1924, and were known initially as Kilroe's Flats. Each of the four flats also had an individual name: Morella, Carinyah, Lumtah and Neerim. The name Victoria Flats may be a later descriptor. The purpose-designed flat or apartment building emerged as a new form of residential accommodation in Brisbane during the 1920s, and Kilroe's Flats on Gregory Terrace were amongst the earliest purpose-designed flats erected in the city, and certainly the first on Gregory Terrace, which became a popular location for blocks of flats in the later 1920s and 1930s. Brisbane, in comparison to Sydney where flat buildings were being erected from the early 1900s, was relatively slow to adopt this new form of domestic dwelling. Like most of Brisbane's purpose-designed flats, and similar to Melbourne rather than Sydney flats, Kilroe's Flats on Gregory Terrace were essentially suburban in nature: domestic in scale and design and located within a garden setting. They were unusual in that each flat had an entrance directly accessible from the street, rather than accessed from a common stairwell. Three main types of purpose-designed flats evolved in Brisbane in the interwar period: moderate-rental blocks; prestigious and luxury flats or apartments; and the bachelor flat. Sometimes these were combined with professional chambers or shops. Kilroe's Flats, with their attractive street facades, private entrances, generously proportioned rooms, and up-to-date facilities (including built-in cupboards in the entrance, kitchen and bathroom), were clearly aimed at the higher-income, long-term rental market. The location was prestigious - situated on the high land along Gregory Terrace overlooking Victoria Park ‚Äîand convenient to the Brisbane central business district. The bulk of purpose-designed blocks of flats erected in Brisbane in the interwar period were intended as rental investments, rather than for immediate re-sale, as strata title was not available. Investors favoured centrally located positions, close to workplaces, shopping facilities, entertainment and schools, with easy access to public transport. Corner positions, which permitted plenty of opportunity to ensure flats were well lit and ventilated, were also favoured. Kilroe's Flats are early and important evidence of these considerations. The designer of Kilroe's Flats, Scottish- trained architect Thomas Blair Moncrieff Wightman, arrived in Brisbane at the age of 26. He first lectured in architecture at the Brisbane Central Technical College, then was employed by architects Atkinson and McLay in 1912, and was in private practice in Brisbane by 1913 - firstly on his own, then as Wightman and Phillips from 1914 to 1918. From 1919 he practised alone until his retirement and subsequent early death . He was a fellow of the Royal British Institute of Architects, and a councillor of the Queensland Institute of Architects (President in 1923-24, about the time he designed Kilroe's Flats). Wightman's work was well received in Brisbane, and his residential work is considered to be important in the development of interwar domestic architecture in Queensland. He established a substantial residential practice, and attracted prestigious commissions which permitted design experimentation in adapting the traditional Queensland timber house to meet changing social and functional requirements. Kilroe's Flats are the only purpose-built flats in Brisbane identified to date as designed by Wightman. In these flats, Wightman employed elements of domestic bungalow style in the tradition of the Queensland high-set house. The verandah spaces in particular are illustrative of changing lifestyles in Brisbane during the interwar period, when verandah widths and designs were being experimented with to permit their use as outdoor living and sleeping \\"rooms\\". The Kilroes did not reside in their Gregory Terrace flats, and by had left Mirrunya, which from March 1928 they let to Lillian Leitch as a private hospital. By 1942 Mrs Kilroe had been widowed. In that year she sold Mirrunya, but retained the flats on an enlarged subdivision (resub 2 of subs 1-3 of allotment 253 - 1 rood 4.2 perches). Following Fanny Kilroe's death in 1948, the flats (building and land) were sold to Edward and Bridie Lynch in 1949. They remain with descendants of the Lynch family, and unlike many of Brisbane's interwar flats which have since been converted to strata title, are retained on a single title.  Description  Victoria Flats, 2000 Victoria Flats are situated at the corner of Gregory Terrace and Kinross Street, Spring Hill, on the highest part of the ridge overlooking Victoria Park to the north and west. The principal elevation is to Gregory Terrace, to which the flats make a prominent streetscape contribution. The building is domestic in scale and form. It is a two-storeyed brick building with 2 flats on each floor, each with a frontage to Gregory Terrace, and a sub-floor at the rear where the land slopes away toward Water Street The whole has a single, bungalow-style roof clad in terracotta tiles, with a short ridge and gablets at the apex, reminiscent of early 1900s houses, which unifies the building. Each flat has a separate front and rear entrance. Two symmetrically positioned, gable-roofed, external brick staircases at the front of the building give access to the two upper floor flats. At the rear, two separate external staircases also give access to the top two flats, but the original staircases have been replace with steel framing and concrete treads. The exterior walls are finished in stucco with decorative brickwork to the window sills. Windows on the ground floor have window hoods clad with terracotta tiles. Each flat has a separate wrought-iron entrance gate on Gregory Terrace, with individual name plate in the gate: Morella, Carinyah, Lumtah and Neerim. Internally, each flat is identical in arrangement, other than that the two flats on each floor are mirrored in plan. Although the two upper floor flats were initially designed with a different floor plan to the lower floor flats, all have been constructed to the ground floor pattern. In each flat, a small entrance hall leads into the public spaces - a living room and dining room with windows along the side of the building, and separated by a timber arch. A bedroom opens off each of these rooms on the party-wall side. The front bedroom has a small enclosed front balcony, and off the rear bedroom, through wide French doors, is a larger enclosed sleeping verandah. Originally the kitchen was located at the front of each flat, beside the front entrance hall, and accessed from what is now the living room (formerly the dining room). At an early date, in each flat, the kitchen has been converted to a bathroom, and the bathroom, which opened off the sleeping verandah at the back, was converted to a kitchen. The present \\"kitchens\\" retain the original wall and floor tiling associated with their former function as bathrooms: black and white patterned mosaic tiles on the floor and rectangular, white ceramic tiles finished with similar listello tiles, on the walls. Next to the original bathroom (now kitchen) and also accessed from the sleeping verandah is a toilet. In each flat, a rear door opens from the sleeping verandah onto a landing, off which is a separate, externally accessed laundry. The floors are of extremely narrow timber boards, possibly japanned originally. The public rooms have early timber panelling, and plate and picture rails with decorative timber brackets, all of which has been painted. The ceilings retain their original fibrous-cement sheeting and timber battening arranged in decorative patterns. In at least one flat, the timber battening on the ceiling retains its dark staining, but most ceilings have been repainted. In each flat, there is a small triangular coat-cupboard in the entrance hall, and early built-in cupboards in the bathroom and kitchen. There is also an early, but not original, serving hatch between what is now the dining room (formerly the living room) and what is now the kitchen (formerly the bathroom)]. Windows throughout are timber-framed casements, most retaining their original patterned, opaque glass. The front door to each flat has a decorative oval leadlight window. The front garden is enclosed along Gregory Terrace by the original fence of rendered brick, but the retaining wall and fence along Kinross Street has been replaced (late 1990s) with a cement block and picket fence. In the backyard is a mature Jacaranda tree and a set of three timber- framed, weatherboard-clad garages with a skillion roof, recently reclad. These are accessed from Kinross Street.  Heritage listing  Victoria Flats was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 30 March 2001 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Victoria Flats (Kilroe's Flats), erected , is important in demonstrating the pattern of residential development in Brisbane during the interwar years, being among the earliest purpose-designed suburban flats constructed in Brisbane. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. As early surviving purpose-designed flats in Brisbane, the place is rare, and important in illustrating changing community attitudes to desirable and acceptable forms of housing. The incorporation of separate street entrances for each flat also is comparatively rare among Brisbane interwar flats. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The place remains highly intact externally and substantially intact internally, and is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of early, purpose-designed, middle-class flats in Brisbane - including the domestic scale, design and layout; the garden setting; the inclusion of separate entrances and separate laundries; and the attention to aesthetic detail (including leadlights in the front entrance doors, decorative timber brackets to the internal picture and plate rails in the living and dining rooms, and early decorative wall and floor tiling to the original bathrooms). In addition, the location is illustrative of many of the principal concerns of investors in up-market flats, including: accessibility to public transport, workplaces, shops, schools and entertainment; aesthetics; and good light and ventilation. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The place has aesthetic value, and makes an important contribution to the Gregory Terrace streetscape. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The place has an important association with the work of Brisbane architect TBM Wightman, who was influential in the development of domestic architecture in Brisbane during the interwar years, and is the only purpose- designed block of flats identified to date as having been designed by him.

There, after working in the laboratory of Emil Fischer and Robert Pschorr and distinguishing himself as a student, he earned a doctorate in 1901.Li»õu, p.345 The same year, having returned to Ia»ôi, he was named head of the city's chemistry institute, under the Health Ministry. He would remain there for eleven years. Meanwhile, in November 1907, he was named associate professor in the medical chemistry and biology department of the Ia»ôi Medical Faculty, and was promoted to full professor in July 1913. Subsequently, he led the department until his death. As director of a medical and biochemical laboratory, »òumuleanu shaped a school of young chemists. His lectures were usually accompanied by demonstrations and were known for their clear and thorough presentation. His published work focused on organic chemistry. One article that appeared at Berlin in 1901 dealt with the synthesis of dimethylmorpholine and aminoaniline. Together with his assistants, he performed a series of analyses on domestic mineral water, at BƒÉl»õƒÉte»ôti, Budachi, Covasna and SlƒÉnic-Moldova.Li»õu, p.345-46 He also devised several micro-analytic methods applied to Romanian wine.Li»õu, p.346 He became active in politics in 1910, when he joined the Democratic Nationalist Party (PND) founded by Nicolae Iorga and A. C. Cuza. Together with Ion Zelea Codreanu, he belonged to the party's radical nationalist wing.Heinen, p.89 He briefly gained notoriety in 1919, when, as vice president of the Romanian Senate, he read the decrees proclaiming the union of Transylvania, Bukovina and Bessarabia with Romania.NastasƒÉ, p.219 When Cuza announced his definitive break with Iorga in March 1920, »òumuleanu followed him into Alexandru Averescu's People's Party.BozdoghinƒÉ, p.73 In early 1922, Cuza founded the National Christian Union, together with Nicolae Paulescu, Codreanu and »òumuleanu. This organization evolved into the National-Christian Defense League the following March.Heinen, p.111-12 Also in 1922, student protests demanding a Jewish quota began at the Ia»ôi Medical Faculty; these were inspired by Cuza, »òumuleanu and Ion GƒÉvƒÉnescul.Ciucanu, p.66 He later became a leading member of the Iron Guard, whose leader Corneliu Zelea Codreanu would recall this trio as the only professors at Ia»ôi who did not espouse \\"anti- Romanian ideas\\".Petreu, p.45 »òumuleanu ran for and won a seat in the Assembly of Deputies in 1937, but died five days before the vote took place.Sandache, p.318 Notes References * Teohari Antonescu (ed.

She had been reported missing at the beginning of the month. Maintenance workers at the hotel discovered the body when investigating guest complaints of problems with the water supply. Her disappearance had been widely reported; interest had increased five days prior to her body's discovery when the Los Angeles Police Department released a video of the last time she was known to have been seen, on the day of her disappearance, by an elevator security camera. In the footage, Lam is seen exiting and re-entering the elevator, talking and gesturing in the hallway outside, and sometimes seeming to hide within the elevator, which itself appears to be malfunctioning. The video went viral on the Internet, with many viewers reporting that they found it unsettling. Explanations ranged from claims of paranormal involvement to bipolar disorder, from which Lam suffered; it has also been argued that the video was altered prior to release. The circumstances of Lam's death, once she was found, also raised questions, especially in light of the Cecil's history in relation to other notable deaths and murders. Her body was naked with most of her clothes and personal effects floating in the water near her. It took the Los Angeles County Coroner's office four months, after repeated delays, to release the autopsy report, which reports no evidence of physical trauma and states that the manner of death was accidental.Autopsy report, 15. Guests at the Cecil, now re-branded as Stay on Main, sued the hotel over the incident, and Lam's parents filed a separate suit later that year; the latter was dismissed in 2015. Some of the early Internet interest noted what were considered to be unusual similarities between Lam's death and the 2005 horror film Dark Water. The case has since been referenced in international popular culture. Background Lam, the daughter of emigrants from Hong Kong who opened a restaurant in Burnaby, just outside Vancouver, Canada, was a student at the University of British Columbia although she was not registered at the beginning of 2013. alt=The lower five stories of a tan brick building in a city. Its lower windows have awnings; there is a fire escape on the right. At the street there is a large shelter over the entrance with \\"Hotel Cecil\\" on it in black type on a yellow background. A small truck and car, both white, are parked on the street in front. For her trip to California, Lam traveled alone on Amtrak and intercity buses. She visited the San Diego Zoo and posted photos taken there on social media. On January 26, she arrived in Los Angeles. After two days, she checked into the Cecil Hotel, near downtown's Skid Row. Lam was initially assigned a shared room on the hotel's fifth floor; however, her roommates complained about what the hotel's lawyer would later describe as \\"certain odd behavior,\\" and she was moved to a room of her own after two days. Built as a business hotel in the 1920s, the Cecil fell on hard times during the Great Depression of the 1930s and never recaptured its original market as downtown decayed around it in the late 20th century. Several of Los Angeles's more notable murders have happened at or have connections to the hotel: in 1964, Goldie Osgood, the \\"Pigeon Lady of Pershing Square,\\" was raped and murdered in her room at the Cecil, a crime that has never been solved. Serial killers Jack Unterweger and Richard Ramirez both resided at the Cecil while active. There have also been suicides, one of which also killed a pedestrian outside the front entrance of the hotel. After recent renovations, it has tried to market itself as a boutique hotel, but the reputation lingers. \\"The Cecil will reveal to you whatever it is you're a fugitive from,\\" says Steve Erickson, a journalist who spent a night in the hotel after Lam's death. Lam had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and depression. She had been prescribed four medications‚ÄîWellbutrin, Lamictal, SeroquelAutopsy report, 20. and EffexorAutopsy report, 22‚Äîto treat her disorders. According to her family, who supposedly kept her history of mental illness a secret, Lam had no history of suicidal ideations or attempts, although one report claimed she had previously gone missing for a brief period. In mid-2010, Lam began a blog named Ether Fields on Blogspot. Over the next two years, she posted pictures of models in fashionable clothing and accounts of her life, particularly her struggle with mental illness. In a January 2012 blog post, Lam lamented that a \\"relapse\\" at the start of the current school term had forced her to drop several classes, leaving her feeling \\"so utterly directionless and lost.\\" She titled her post, \\"You're always haunted by the idea you're wasting your life\\" after a quotation from novelist Chuck Palahniuk. She used that quote as an epigraph for her blog. Lam worried that her transcript would look suspicious with so many withdrawals and that it would result in her being unable to continue her studies and attend graduate school. A little over two years after Lam had started blogging, she announced she would be abandoning her blog for another she had started on Tumblr, \\"Nouvelle-Nouveau\\". Its content mostly consisted of found fashion photos and quotes and a few posts in Lam's own words. The same Palahniuk quote was used as an epigraph. Disappearance Lam contacted her parents in British Columbia every day while traveling. On January 31, 2013, the day she was scheduled to check out of the Cecil and leave for Santa Cruz, they did not hear from her and called the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD); her family flew to Los Angeles to help with the search. Hotel staff who saw Lam that day said she was alone. Outside the hotel, Katie Orphan, manager of a nearby bookstore, was the only person who recalled seeing her that day. \\"She was outgoing, very lively, very friendly,\\" while getting gifts to take home to her family, Orphan told CNN. \\"[She was] talking about what book she was getting and whether or not what she was getting would be too heavy for her to carry around as she traveled,\\" Orphan added. Police searched the hotel to the extent that they legally could. They searched Lam's room and had dogs go through the building, including the rooftop, but the canines were unsuccessful in detecting her scent. \\"But we didn't search every room,\\" Sgt. Rudy Lopez said later, \\"we could only do that if we had probable cause\\" to believe a crime had been committed. On February 6, a week after Lam had last been seen, the LAPD decided more help was needed. Flyers with her image were posted in the neighborhood and online. It brought the case to the public's attention through the media. =Elevator video= On February 15, after another week with no sign of Lam, the LAPD released a video of the last known sighting of her taken in one of the Cecil's elevators by a video surveillance camera on February 1. The video drew worldwide interest in the case due to Lam's strange behavior, and has been extensively analyzed and discussed. In the clip, the camera at one of the elevator cab's rear corners looks down from the ceiling, offering a view not just of its interior but the hallway outside as well. It is somewhat grainy, and the timestamp at the bottom is obscured. At some points Lam's mouth is pixelized. At the start, Lam enters, clad in a red zippered hooded sweatshirt over a gray T-shirt, with black shorts and sandals. She enters from the left and goes to the control panel, appears to select several floors and then steps back to the corner. After a few seconds during which the door fails to close, she steps up to it, leans forward so her head is through the door, looks in both directions, and then quickly steps back in, backing up to the wall and then into the corner near the control panel. The door remains open.\\"Detectives\\", 0:00‚Äì0:36 She walks to it again and stands in the doorway, leaning on the side. Suddenly she steps out into the hall, then to her side, back in, looking to the side, then back out. She then steps sideways again, and for a few seconds she is mostly invisible behind the wall she has her back to just outside. The door remains open.\\"Detectives\\", 0:37‚Äì1:05 Her right arm can be seen going up to her head, and then she turns to re-enter the cab, putting both hands on the side of the door. She then goes to the control panel, presses many more buttons, some more than once, and then returns to the wall she had come into the elevator from, putting both hands over her ears again briefly as she walks back to the section of wall she had been standing against before. The door remains open.\\"Detectives\\", 1:06‚Äì1:54 She turns to her right and begins rubbing her forearms together, then waves her hands out to her sides with palms flat and fingers outstretched, while bowing forward slightly and rocking gently. This can all be seen through the door, which remains open. After she backs to the wall again and walks away to the left, it finally closes.\\"Detectives\\", 1:55‚Äì2:37 The video was reposted widely, including on the Chinese video-sharing site Youku, where it got 3 million views and 40,000 comments in its first 10 days. Many of the commentators found it unsettling to watch. Several theories evolved to explain her actions. One was that Lam was trying to get the elevator car to move in order to escape from someone who was pursuing her. Others suggested that she might be under the influence of ecstasy or some other party drug, but none was detected in her body. When her bipolar disorder became known, the theory that she was having a psychotic episode also emerged. Other viewers argued that the video had been tampered with before being made public. Besides the obscuring of the timestamp, they claimed, parts had been slowed down, and nearly a minute of footage had been discreetly removed. This could have been done simply to protect the identity of someone who otherwise would be in the video but had little or nothing to do with the case, or to conceal evidence if Lam's disappearance and death had been the result of a criminal act. Discovery of body During the search for Lam, guests at the hotel began complaining about low water pressure. Some later claimed their water was colored black, and had an unusual taste. On the morning of February 19, Lam's body was found in one of four 1,000-gallon (3,785 L) tanks providing water to guest rooms, a kitchen, and a coffee shop. The tank was drained and cut open since its maintenance hatch was too small to accommodate equipment needed to remove Lam's body. On February 21, the Los Angeles coroner's office issued a finding of accidental drowning, with bipolar disorder as a significant factor.Autopsy report, 1‚Äì10. The full coroner's report, released in June, stated that Lam's body had been found naked; clothing similar to that she was wearing in the elevator video was floating in the water, coated with a \\"sand-like particulate\\". Her watch and room key were also found with her. Lam's body was moderately decomposed and bloated. It was mostly greenish, with some marbling evident on the abdomen and skin separation evident. There was no evidence of physical trauma, sexual assault,Autopsy report, 13 or suicide. Toxicology testsincomplete because not enough of her blood was preservedshowed traces consistent with prescription medication found among her belongings, plus nonprescription drugs such as Sinutab and ibuprofen.Autopsy report, 22‚Äì25 A very small quantity of alcohol (about 0.02 g%) was present, but no other recreational drugs.Autopsy report, 26 Unresolved issues The investigation had determined how Lam died, but did not offer an explanation as to how she got into the tank in the first place. Doors and stairs that access the hotel's roof are locked, with only staff having the passcodes and keys, and any attempt to force them would supposedly have triggered an alarm. However, the hotel's fire escape could have allowed her to bypass those security measures, if she (or someone who might have accompanied her there) had known. A video made by a Chinese user after Lam's death and posted to the Internet showed that the hotel's roof was easily accessible via the fire escape and that two of the lids of the water tanks were open. Apart from the question of how she got on the roof, others asked if she could have gotten into the tank by herself. All four tanks are cylinders propped up on concrete blocks; there is no fixed access to them and hotel workers had to use a ladder to look at the water. They are protected by heavy lids that would be difficult to replace from within. Police dogs that searched through the hotel for Lam, even on the roof, shortly after her disappearance was noted, did not find any trace of her (although they had not searched the area near the water tanks). Theories about Lam's behavior in the elevator video did not stop with her death. Some argued that she was attempting to hide from a pursuer, perhaps someone ultimately responsible for her death, while others said she was merely frustrated with the elevator's apparent malfunction. Some proponents of the theory that she was under the influence of illicit drugs are not dissuaded by their absence from the toxicology screen, suggesting that they might have broken down during the period of time her body decomposed in the tank, or that she might have taken rare cocktails of such drugs that a normal screen would not detect. The autopsy report and its conclusions have also been questioned. For instance, it does not say what the results of the rape kit and fingernail kit were, or even if they were processed. It also records subcutaneous pooling of blood in Lam's anal area, which some observers suggested was a sign of sexual abuse; however one pathologist has noted it could also have resulted from bloating in the course of the body's decomposition, and her rectum was also prolapsed.Autopsy report, 12. Even the coroner's pathologists appeared to be ambivalent about their conclusion that Lam's death was accidental. Since her death, her Tumblr blog was updated, presumably through Tumblr's Queue option which allows posts to automatically publish themselves when the user is away. Her phone was not found either with her body or in her hotel room; it has been assumed to have been stolen at some time around her death. Whether the continued updates to her blog were facilitated by the theft of her phone, the work of a hacker, or through the Queue, is not known; nor is it known whether the updates are related to her death. Litigation In September, Lam's parents filed a wrongful death suit, claiming the hotel failed to \\"inspect and seek out hazards in the hotel that presented an unreasonable risk of danger to (Lam) and other hotel guests\\" and seeking unspecified damages and burial costs. The hotel argued it could not have reasonably foreseen that Lam might have entered the water tanks, and that since it remained unknown how Lam got to the water tank no liability could be assigned for failing to prevent that. In 2015, the suit was dismissed. In popular culture The circumstances of Lam's death have been compared to plot elements in the 2005 horror film Dark Water. In that film, an American remake of an earlier Japanese film of the same name based on a 1996 short story by Koji Suzuki, a mother and daughter move into a rundown apartment building. A dysfunctional elevator and discolored water gushing from the building's faucets eventually lead them to the building's rooftop water tank, where they discover the body of a girl who had been reported missing from the building a year earlier. As life had imitated art with Dark Water, the creators of films and television shows used the Lam case as inspiration for their own works. In May 2013, the episode \\"Watershed\\" aired as that year's season finale of the ABC series Castle, in which a New York police detective and the title character, a mystery novelist, investigate crimes. In \\"Watershed\\", the duo pursue leads in the death of a young woman found dead in the rooftop water tank of the \\"Cedric Hotel\\" in Manhattan; among the evidence is a surveillance video of the woman taken in an elevator. Ultimately she is found to have been posing as a prostitute in order to investigate another guest at the hotel. Another ABC series, How to Get Away with Murder, had a similar story line. Over a series of flashbacks spread out across the first season, which began airing in 2014, it is revealed that a sorority girl missing at the start of the season was murdered and that her body has been hidden in the water tank on the roof of the sorority house. Similarly, her body is only discovered when a maintenance worker is called to the house to address a water pressure issue. In Hong Kong, from which Lam's family had emigrated to Vancouver, filmmakers were also inspired by the case. Nick Cheung, an accomplished actor in Hong Kong films, made his directorial debut in 2014 with Hungry Ghost Ritual, a horror thriller that includes a scene in which a ghost terrorizes a young woman in an elevator, shot to look like security-camera footage and believed to have been inspired by the Cecil's Lam footage. In mainland China, director Liu Hao announced a year after Lam's death that he would be making a film based on it; he went to Los Angeles himself and stayed for a few days at the Cecil doing research. Chinese media have reported that actress Gao Yuanyuan may be interested in playing Lam. In March 2014, a little over a year after Lam's death, brothers Brandon and Philip Murphy sold a horror script, The Bringing, that uses the investigation into it as a backstory for a fictional investigating detective's slowly unraveling sanity. They were widely criticized for doing this so soon after the death. Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn was originally slated to direct the film, but in August it was announced that Jeremy Lovering would direct the film for Sony Pictures whenever production began. The 2014 video for Vancouver pop duo The Zolas' \\"Ancient Mars\\" is meant to be an idealized representation of Lam's last day, showing a young woman exploring Los Angeles and taking in simple pleasures. \\"It bugged me how tidily people explained away her disappearance with drugs or mental illness,\\" said singer Zach Gray, who attended UBC around the same time and had a friend who knew Lam. \\"Though it's mostly fiction we wanted people to see it and feel like she was a real girl and a familiar girl and not just a police report.\\" Later that year, the American post-hardcore band Hail the Sun wrote \\"Disappearing Syndrome\\", also inspired by Lam's story. \\"It's such a chilling and eerie case,\\" said the band's guitarist, Aric Garcia, in a Reddit Ask Me Anything. In 2015, the media speculated that the fifth season of American Horror Story was inspired by Lam's death. In late spring creator Ryan Murphy said the next season would be set in a hotel in present-day Los Angeles. He was inspired, he added, by a surveillance video of a young woman who \\"got into an elevator at a downtown hotel ... [and] was never seen again.\\" He did not use her name but it was believed he was talking about Lam. In 2017, Sun Kil Moon released the songs \\"Window Sash Weights\\" and \\"Stranger Than Paradise\\" as part of their album Common as Light and Love Are Red Valleys of Blood (2017); the songs specifically reference the event and promote the idea that it was a hoax. Band member Mark Kozelek said in an interview \\"I've come to the conclusion that nobody died in the water tank. There‚Äôs no way to identify the girl on the elevator, as her face is pixelated.\\" In 2019, the studio ACKK, creators of the video game YIIK: A Postmodern RPG, had cited her death as an inspiration stating \\"Her suffering was influential in the development in the game\\"https://i.imgur.com/Gcm4SGu.jpg on a Reddit AMA. The comment was deleted after a wave of controversy and accusations of exploitation by both mediahttps://n4g.com/news/2234765/yiik-a-postmodern-rpg-criticized-for-using- elisa-lams-tragic-death?info=true and consumershttps://steamcommunity.com/app/459080/discussions/0/1742232339922921323/ alike. She is depicted in the game as a character known either as Semmi Pak and/or Sammy Park dependent on whichever character is speaking of her. Reviewers have taken issue with how she is treated as little more than a throw-away love interest for the main character which is rewarded to the protagonist at the end of the game.

He has created a number of large scale multiple element sculptures, and over 170 works of public art. He currently lives in Belgrade, Montana. He has created works in steel, copper and brass. Dolan grew up near Livermore, California, and came from a ranching background. He first came to Montana in 1966, moving from California to attend Montana State University, where he graduated in 1970 and ultimately obtained a master's degree in agriculture. He took a welding class at the college and that was when he began to create metal sculptures, starting with nails and other small bits of metal. He petitioned the college to be granted in-state tuition, arguing that he intended to live in Montana permanently and be an asset to the state. Over the course of his career, he has donated four sculptures to Montana State University, and Bleu Horses, which he built over 15 months and with his own money, is dedicated to the people of Montana. His work at MSU includes a statue of Walt Whitman placed near Wilson Hall, the campus's liberal arts building, and near the Museum of the Rockies is \\"Rusty,\\" a draft horse. However, a significant number of his public art sculptures are installed in the eastern United States. Dolan's career as a full-time artist took off after he finished a commission in 1979 to place a flock of geese inside the terminal of Bozeman Yellowstone International Airport. His most recent large-scale installation is Bleu Horses, a set of 39 horse sculptures made primarily of steel and permanently installed on a hillside off highway 287 just north of Three Forks, Montana. Dolan has created other complex outdoor sculptures in Montana, including a herd of elk placed upon the lawn of a bank in Bozeman, and a fly fisherman sculpture in Ennis. A whimsical work, Albert Einstein Between Theorems, was a 2012 ArtPrize entry, and is now permanently installed at Western Michigan University. A sculpture of a golden eagle, with a wingspan, is in Osaka, Japan. His work often contains whimsical elements, such as a Frisbee-throwing statue of Albert Einstein, said to be \\"taking a moment for lighthearted joy amidst his important work,\\" or one of the Bleu Horses which is \\"pooping\\"‚Äîevidenced by a small pile of round stones placed on the ground beneath the animal's raised tail.

Background  In August 1918, the Czechoslovak legion, under the leadership of Gajda, fought the Red Army for control of the mountain passes around Lake Baikal which were well defended. Gajda was troubled by the fact that Baikal was completely under the control of the Red Army's ships, which threatened the Czechoslovak units with landing units to the legion's rear. While occupying various ports on the shores of the Baikal, the Czechoslovak legionaries managed to capture two enemy steamships, the \\"Sibirjak\\" and the \\"Fedosia\\". These were later refitted with a pair of howitzers each.  Battle  SS Baikal was armed and used by the Red Army during the battle. On August 15, the Czechoslovak fleet sailed out of Listvyanka. By noon on August 16, the ships were about 8 km from the port in Mysovsk in heavy fog. After a few minutes, the fog started dissipating and the ships spotted Babushkin. The Red Army forces defending the town were under the impression that the approaching ships were friendly vessels bringing in supplies. This allowed the ships to approach the harbor to a distance of approximately 4 km. By the time the defenders of Babushkin realized their error, it was too late. The icebreaker Bajkal tried to initiate fire upon the Czechoslovak ships but they were faster. They began to fire, both at the Bajkal and at the harbor. The Bajkal was sunk and general confusion erupted in Babushkin. The train station was in flames. An armored train arrived after half an hour of Czechoslovak bombardment. Guns were offloaded from it and began to return fire upon the Czechoslovak ships. Since the main mission of destroying the harbor and train station were completed, the legionaries left the battle. On the return journey they met the enemy ship Angara which decided to evade battle. The rest of the journey was uneventful and they returned to Listvyanka without any further incidents. Aftermath News of the Czechoslovak Legion's campaign in Siberia during the summer of 1918 was welcomed by Allied statesmen in Great Britain and France, who saw the operation as a means to reconstitute an eastern front against Germany. U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, who had resisted earlier Allied proposals to intervene in Russia, gave in to domestic and foreign pressure to support the legionaries' evacuation from Siberia. In early July 1918, he published an aide-m√©moire calling for a limited intervention in Siberia by the U.S. and Japan to rescue the Czechoslovak troops, who had been blocked by Bolshevik forces in Transbaikal. However, the Czechoslovakians had already fought their way through. By the time most American and Japanese units landed in Vladivostok, the Czechoslovakians were already there to welcome them. The Allied intervention in Siberia continued so that by autumn of 1918, there were 70,000 Japanese, 829 British, 1,400 Italian, 5,002 American and 107 French colonial (Vietnamese) troops in the region. Many of these contingents supported anti-Bolshevik Russians and Cossack warlords who had established regional governments in the wake of the Czechoslovak seizure of the Trans- Siberian Railway. The Czechoslovak Legion's campaign in Siberia impressed Allied statesmen and attracted them to the idea of an independent Czechoslovak state. As the legionaries cruised from one victory to another that summer, the Czechoslovak National Council began receiving official statements of recognition from various Allied governments.

The title of the film is drawn from the fact that Elser's bomb detonated in a venue that Hitler had left just 13 minutes before. It was screened out of competition at the 65th Berlin International Film Festival. It was one of eight films shortlisted by Germany to be their submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 88th Academy Awards, but it lost out to Labyrinth of Lies. Plot In November 1939, after planting a home-made bomb inside a column of a Munich Bierkeller, Georg Elser (Christian Friedel) attempts to cross into neutral Switzerland but is caught at the border. His bomb detonates but misses killing German leader Adolf Hitler by just 13 minutes. The German security services find incriminating evidence on Elser and link him to the assassination attempt. They believe Elser must have been working with a group of conspirators and proceed to torture Elser. They also round up members of his family from his home village, including Else H√§rlen (Katharina Sch√ºttler), a married woman Elser has been seeing. When Else is brought before Elser, he fears for her life and tells Kripo police chief Arthur Nebe (Burghart Klau√üner) and Gestapo head Heinrich M√ºller (Johann von B√ºlow) that he acted alone, procuring detonators from a steel factory and stealing dynamite from a nearby quarry. He outlines the two clockwork mechanisms he built to time the explosion and hopefully kill Hitler as he made a speech. Still not believed to have attempted the assassination alone, Elser is once more tortured using drugs (Pervitin), but with the same result as before‚Äîhe insists that he acted alone. Through flashbacks it is learned that Elser came to despise the Nazis and saw that Hitler needed to be removed to save Germany. Following his arrest, Elser was kept in concentration camps for five years and was shot a few days before American forces liberated Dachau concentration camp, a few weeks before the war ended. Elser is now regarded as a German resistance hero of the Second World War.

The review in The Guardian newspaper noted the film as \\"...a heartfelt study of a man who tried to kill Hitler\\" The newspaper was also very complimentary about Christian Friedel's performance as Elser. However, the entertainment magazine Variety were less impressed, saying \\"... the absence of subtlety combined with predictable dollops of sentimentalism once again trivialize events in the name of making them understandable\\". In the Daily Telegraph review, the reviewer noted the film as having an \\"...overbearing sentimentalism and lacquered, Oscar-hungry sheen\\".

A number of his works are now heritage-listed. Early life Thomas Blair Moncrieff Wightman was born in Glasgow, Scotland in 1884, the son of Robert Anderson Wightman and his wife Jeanie Greenless (n√©e Dunsmore). He trained in Scotland as an architect and arrived in Brisbane at the age of 26. He married Hannah Matkin in 1910 in the All Saints Anglican Church in Spring Hill, Brisbane. The couple had one daughter, Jean, born 1911.  Career as an architect On arrival in Brisbane, he first lectured in architecture at the Brisbane Central Technical College, then was employed by architects Atkinson and McLay in 1912, and was in private practice in Brisbane by 1913 ‚Äì firstly on his own, then as Wightman and Phillips from 1914 to 1918. From 1919 he practised alone until his retirement . He was a councillor of the Queensland Institute of Architects and its president in 1923-24. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1927. Wightman's work was well received in Brisbane, and his residential work is considered to be important in the development of interwar domestic architecture in Queensland. He established a substantial residential practice, and attracted prestigious commissions which permitted design experimentation in adapting the traditional Queensland timber house to meet changing social and functional requirements. Works Victoria Flats in Spring Hill (known as Kilroe's Flats at the time of their construction ) are the only purpose-built flats in Brisbane identified as designed by Wightman. In these flats, Wightman employed elements of domestic bungalow style in the tradition of the Queensland high-set house. The verandah spaces in particular are illustrative of changing lifestyles in Brisbane during the interwar period, when verandah widths and designs were being experimented with to permit their use as outdoor living and sleeping \\"rooms\\". The flats are listed on the Queensland Heritage Register. Wightman also designed the former Masonic Temple at 149 Brunswick Street, Fortitude Valley , which is now listed on the Brisbane Heritage Register. Later life In April 1932, Thomas Wightman was convicted of income tax evasion for the financial year 1925-1926, having understated his income and deducted a number of fictitious expenses. He was fined ¬£100 and ordered to pay double income tax as penalty, with the alternative of six months in prison. His wife died unexpectedly on 7 August 1932 in a private hospital in Toowong. He travelled worldwide during 1933‚Äî1935, including Japan (where he was concerned about the political situation), South Africa (where he was concerned about the plague of grasshoppers). He also noted a growing preference for buses over trams as a means of public transport in both the United Kingdom and South Africa.

The film stars Vera Gordon, Dore Davidson, Miriam Battista, Vivienne Osborne, William Collier, Jr., John Roche, and Ora Jones. The film was released on April 2, 1922, by Paramount Pictures. It is not known whether the film currently survives. Plot As described in a film magazine, Julius Binswanger (Davidson) has at last managed to save enough to send for his wife Becky (Gordon) and two children Pearl (Battista as a child, Osborne when grown) and Izzy (Collier) who have spent their time since leaving their hovel in Russia in a place little better, the swarming tenants in the East Side of New York City. He meets them at the tiny train station in a little town about forty five minutes from the city, and they are overwhelmed by the home he has bought as a surprise, a rickety old home at the edge of the village, but still their very own home. Over the next few years Julius prospers. Within ten years the traveling peddler's wagon of his has been replaced by a neat store on Main Street, and the home has been repaired and has an air of comfort and prosperity. Pearl has grown into womanhood and has a prospective lover in Max Teitlebaum (Roche), while Izzy is an up-to-date youth eager to have \\"his chance.\\" He and his sister want to move back to New York City, but their father refuses. The mother is torn between her love for her husband and her desire to give their children \\"their chance.\\" At last the old man, much against his will, yields and they move back into the city, renting their home. This move proves to be ruinous to the father, and he ends up bankrupt with his family knowing this truth. Pearl knows Max is planning to propose to her, but she demurs for her family. Julius feels he must make any sacrifice for those he loves. He has not been sleeping well, and takes the maximum dosage of two pills to assist in this. Becky discovers her husband just as he is about to take six of these pills, and this causes a readjustment for everyone.

Coat of Arms of the Republic of Guatemala between 1858 and 1871. A replica was carved on the front side of the theater before it was remodeled in 1892. An enthusiastic fan of Opera, and following his mistress -Josefa Silva's advice-, president for life of Guatemala Rafael Carrera started the construction of a massive National Theater that was called \\"Carrera Theater\\" in his honor, and was located in the old Central Square. The Old Central Square was located to the northeast side of Guatemala City -then not larger than a tiny village- and in 1776 was used to place the first block of the new Nueva Guatemala de la Asunci√≥n after the 1773 earthquakes destroy Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala. The place had been chosen as the new city Central Square, saving the surroundings for the new Cathedral, Palace and houses for the richest families of the time, the Aycinena family, given that the family leader, Ferm√≠n de Aycinena, had contributed considerably to the move of the city from its old place. However, the design approved by the Spanish crown had the Central Square in a different location, and this one became the Old Central Square. Years later it became a commercial site and on 6 August 1832, then State of Guatemala Governor, Dr. Mariano Galvez, issued a decree to build a theater in the Old Central Square site. However, political climate was very tense in the country and when the civil war between liberal and conservative parties escalated, Galvez was overthrown and the theater could not be built. The project was revisited in 1852, when Juan Matheu and Manuel Francisco Pav√≥n Aycinena present Rafael Carrera with a new plan. Once approved, Carrera commissioned Matheu himself and Miguel Ruiz de Santisteban to build the theater. Initially it was in charge of engineer Miguel Rivera Maestre, but he quit after a few months and was replaced by German expert Jos√© Beckers, who built the Greek fa√ßades and added a lobby. This was the first monumental building ever built in the Republican era of Guatemala, given that in the 1850s the country finally was enjoying some peace and prosperity.  Remodel and name change  Col√≥n Theater after its remodeling in 1892. Col√≥n Theater stage. Painting from 1890. Appleton's Guide to M√©xico and Guatemala of 1884 describes the theater as follows: ¬´In the middle of the square is the Theater, similar in size and elegance to any of the rest of Spanish America. Lines of orange trees and other nice trees of brilliant flowers and delicious fragrances surround the bilduing while the statues and fountains placed at certain intervals enhance even more the beauty of the place. After the Liberal reform from 1871, the theater was called National Theater. In 1892, it was refurbished, removing the conservative Coat of Arms from its fa√ßade and substituting it with a sculpture and inscriptions. The orange trees, fountains and sculptures were removed, and in their place modern gardens were planted and a bust of Jos√© Batres Mont√∫far was erected. During the government of general Manuel Lisandro Barillas Berci√°n, the theater was remodeled to celebrate the Discovery of America fourth centennial anniversary; the Italian community in Guatemala donated a statue of Christopher Columbus -Crist√≥bal Col√≥n, in Spanish- which was placed next to the theater. Since then, the place was called \\"Col√≥n Theater\\".  Destruction  Carrera Theater after the 1917‚Äì1918 earthquakes. It was demolished in 1923. The Col√≥n Theater was destroyed by the 1917‚Äì18 earthquakes and remained in ruins until 1923; it was not demolished, due to the government of Manuel Estrada Cabrera incompetence to deal with the disaster, and then because of the Revolution of 1920 to depose Estrada Cabrera. Later on, the instability of the country lead to a coup de etat by general Jos√© Mar√≠a Orellana in 1921, who overthrew then president Carlos Herrera. In place of the theater a street market was built.The new street market was called simply \\"Col√≥n\\" and remained in that place until 1948, when -after several years of lobbying- a new formal market was built across the street.

She was the daughter of Alexander Laidlaw who was a merchant of Scottish descent and his Irish wife Ann Keddy. Her father's family knew Sir Walter Scott and she was sent to Edinburgh to study the piano with Robert M√ºller. She continued her studies in K√∂nigsberg and later to London where she studied under Henri Herz. In 1834 she played for William IV and the ageing Paganini before returning two years later to play in Warsaw, St Petersburg, Dresden, and Vienna and the following year in Leipzig. There she met Robert Schumann who created eight pieces for piano named Fantasiest√ºcke, in her honour, the same year of 1837. It is not clear how close their relationship was, but Laidlaw is presumed to be the reason he started to compose again after a break of four months. It was Schumann's idea to reverse her first two names so that it was Anna Robena Laidlaw who was appointed court pianist to the queen of Hanover in 1840.

The term \\"hip hop studies\\" began circulating in the mid-2000s, and though it is not clear who first coined the term to label the field, the field of hip hop studies is often cited as having been crystallized by the publication of That's the Joint!: The Hip Hop Studies Reader in 2003. That's the Joint! includes approximately 25 years of scholarship, criticism, and journalism. The publication of this anthology was unprecedented, and highlights the evolving and continuous influence of \\"one of the most creative and contested elements of global popular culture since its advent in the late 1970s.\\" The publication of the first edition of That's the Joint! marked a consolidating moment for the field of hip hop studies because it brought together key writings on hip hop from a diversity of hip hop authorities. Hip hop culture, rooted in the 1970s post-industrial South Bronx, is polyvocal and is represented in five cultural modes: rap music (oral), turntablism or \\"DJing\\" (aural), breaking (physical), graffiti art (visual), and knowledge (mental). Hip hop has, and continues to produce a remarkable array of thinkers who embody complex ideological makeups exemplified through their performances as writers, artists, poets, and scholars. In Hip Hop Matters (2005), professor and media scholar S. Craig Watkins labels the increasing interdisciplinary cohort of hip hop academics and scholars as the \\"hip-hop intelligentsia,\\" and suggests that while this group of individuals may not often been discussed as an entity in and of itself, their existence is, without question, one of the greatest achievements of the hip hop movement. Watkins writes: > \\"The growing array of hip-hop intellectuals is a spectacular indication of > the movement's multifaceted demeanor and ceaseless energy...What has emerged > is a body of thinkers who articulate a wide range of ideas that, in their > unique way, map out the contradictory currents, ideas, and worldview that > percolate throughout the phenomenal world of hip hop. From spoken-word > artists to academic scholars hip-hop intellectuals are translating the > movement into a vast mix of critical commentary and artistic expression. The > results both energize and expand the image and imagination of the hip-hop > intelligentsia.\\" Hip hop studies is part of the larger hip hop movement. The research and teaching in this interdisciplinary field includes analyses of technology, pop culture, linguistics, globalization, geography, race, electoral politics, and a variety of aspects related to contemporary culture, as scholars attempt to critically assess hip hop as a movement. Scholarship in hip hop studies is rooted in the foundational, Afro-diasporic call-and-response mechanism within hip hop culture.  Methodologies  Hip hop studies' methodologies, or methods of systematic inquiry and analysis, are drawn from a range of academic disciplines including anthropology, sociology, political science, history, linguistics, economics, performance studies, media and communicative studies, American studies, musicology, English and literature, women's and gender studies, and black studies. Greg Dimitriadis, formerly a professor in the Graduate School of Education at the University of Buffalo, was an academic who critically examined, amongst other topics, hip hop methodologies; writing \\"Questions of method are, at heart, questions about how one can best understand the world.\\" In hip hop studies, this \\"world\\" encompasses the complexities of political, social, and economic exploitation of marginalized peoples, and hip hop practitioners' resultant forms of resistant expression, thus the frames of analysis used by scholars are equally complex and consider factors such as race, class, gender, gender identity, sexuality, location, and performance and performativity. The use of ethnography is popular and preferred in hip hop studies because it is a mode of inquiry that enables a scholar to include a multiplicity of voices, and showcases the experiential knowledges of hip hop doers and consumers; ideally this method highlights the dual authority of practitioners' and academics' knowledges.  Foundational texts  Hip Hop studies has been growing as an academic discipline since the mid-1990s; two decades after its genesis. By the millennium and in the early 2000s, scholars such as Tricia Rose, Michael Eric Dyson, Cornel West, Anthony B. Pinn, Jeff Chang, Nelson George, Bakari Kitwana, Mark Anthony Neal, and Murray Forman, began engage Hip Hop's history, messages of resistance, social cognizance, personal awareness, political activism, pleasure and power, and community engagement in scholarly works that gave Hip Hop academic legitimacy. Works by these authors are considered foundational texts in the field of Hip Hop studies because their research and publication served to legitimize Hip Hop as serious academic discipline. Since 2002 scholarly content centralizing around Hip Hop culture has multiplied exponentially; exemplified by the inception of the Hip Hop Archive & Research Institute at Harvard in 2002, and the publication of the second edition of That's the Joint!: The Hip Hop Studies Reader in 2011. = Tricia Rose's Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America (1994) = Discussions of scholarly writing on hip hop in the academia often begin with Tricia Rose's Black Noise: Rap Music and Black Culture in Contemporary America, published in 1994. This book is categorized within hip hop studies as being among the most important early full-length texts on rap and hip hop culture, which helped to establish hip hop studies as a legitimate field of scholarly inquiry. Rose's book gives a comprehensive account of the evolutionary history of hip hop culture. In Rose's words, Black Noise \\"examines the complex and contradictory relationships between forces of racial and sexual domination, black cultural priorities, and popular resistance in contemporary rap music,\\" while it outlines the social context of rap's existence. To achieve this analysis, Rose's includes a range of voices and perspectives by using an ethnographic approach; conducting interviews with hip hop performers and practitioners, as well as hip hop listeners and consumers. Rose's interviews were conducted throughout the United States, as well as in Hong Kong, China, and Japan. Rose's groundbreaking work continues to be referenced as a foundational text by contemporary scholars because its detailed documentation of hip hop culture's revolution employs ethnography, cultural theory, urban history and historiography, as well as black feminist thought; culminating in an extensive bibliography. = Jeff Chang's Can't Stop, Won't Stop: A History of the Hip- Hop Generation (2005) = Jeff Chang's comprehensive examination of hip hop, Can't Stop, Won't Stop: A History of the Hip-Hop Generation, received the American Book Award after its publication in 2005 and is often cited by hip hop cultural critics, hip hop journalists, popular-culture scholars, and hip hop academics. Chang situates hip hop as \\"forged in the fires of the Bronx and Kingston, Jamaica,\\" and suggests that \\"hip-hop has been a generation-defining global movement,\\" shaped by the deindustrialization and globalization of the post-civil rights era. Chang's method of inquiry and analysis hybrids statistical, historical, and ehtnographical data with a casual writing style that includes Chang's opinions, sections of extended dialogue, and interviews. Chang's central themes in this text are race, and the intersections of race in hip hop agendas/politics.  College/university programs and degrees  Howard University, a historically black college, was the first to offer a Hip Hop- specific class to students in 1991. In the proceeding two decades, colleges across the United States have begun to offer a variety of courses specifically about Hip Hop culture; these include top-ranked universities, such as Harvard, Penn State, USC, UCLA, Stanford, Rice, Duke, Princeton, and NYU. Additionally, in 2012, the University of Arizona announced the implementation of a Hip Hop studies minor; the first of its kind in the country. While the University of Arizona's minor is the first interdisciplinary Hip Hop studies concentration of its kind, since 2009 at McNally Smith College of Music in St. Paul, Minnesota students can acquire a diploma in Hip Hop studies that focuses on Hip Hop music technique, music and audio production, and music industry economics and marketing. In 2013 Tiffin University in Ohio began offering a music performance degree for students with primary focus in emceeing and beatmaking. Apart from classes and degree programs, development in the field has also been marked by the proliferation of conferences (domestically and internationally), symposiums, the development of readers and anthological texts, the establishment of the Hip Hop Archive and Research Institute at Harvard‚Äîeach characteristic of a growing interest in and engagement with Hip Hop culture in academic discourse. In 2017, the top three universities to study Hip Hop at were McNally Smith College of Music, North Carolina Central University, and University of Arizona.  Critiques and critics  Hip Hop studies has not grown without critics, both within and outside the field. Davey D. (also known as: David Cook), a Bronx native and Hip Hop journalist, historian, adjunct professor, and community activist, has written and verbalized critiques of academic Hip Hop claiming that the narrow standards that define legitimate scholarly inquiry exclude individuals who do Hip Hop, in favor of published academics who may or may not have any lived or tangible connection to Hip Hop culture at all. In an article published by the San Francisco Globe in March 2007, Davey D. is quoted as saying: \\"You have an interesting phenomenon, where the 'hip-hop experts,' with university appointments attached to their name, have no credibility whatsoever in hip-hop circles. That, coupled with the fact that academia in a lot of places has always kept a distinct separation between what goes on in community and what happens on campus, is a source of tension.\\" Hip hop's complex foundations have fostered a divergence of opinion amongst scholars regarding how writing on hip hop culture should be done. Namely, this debate is centralized around questions of language, and for what audience(s) scholars should be writing to address: the academic and/or scholar, the dilettante, or the fan and/or self- self-proccalimed \\"hip hop head.\\" Since approximately 1988, three categories of writing on hip hop culture have emerged: works by academics, works by journalists and cultural critics, and works by hip-hop devotees; critiques of hip hop studies include questions of which kind of writing is considered authentic or legitimate within the field, and the accessibility that outsiders, or non-academics, would have to those texts, both physically and comprehensively. Other critics, such as Alex Beam a columnist for The Boston Globe, have claimed that the study of Hip Hop is unsuitable for critical academic study, citing the \\"celebration of ignorance, gangster-ism...and violence against women,\\" in mainstream rap and Hip Hop. Despite the critiques previously mentioned, not all critics of Hip Hop studies are trying to point out the perceived flaws as ways to invalidate its place in academia. Hip Hop feminists and feminism offer critics of Hip Hop studies from a perspective which adds another facet to Hip Hop studies, one that not only involves but gives a platform and amplifies the voice of Black and Latinx women and the LGBTQ+ community as they face the most erasure in the world of Hip Hop studies, even though they were there from the very start. Published books such as Home Girls Make Some Noise: Hip Hop Feminism Anthology, is an anthology that features journals, poetry, and articles by both women of color and LGBTQ+ community which depict where Hip Hop began and the direction in which it very well may go.

There is also the emergence of the mami video vixen, who is the glamorized, hyper-sexualized version of an attractive Latina woman that is seen in rap videos. The image of mami that is the most popular in rap culture is the butta pecan mami, a term coined by Raquel Z. Rivera, which refers to a Latina woman who has light golden colored skin and \\"good\\" (European-type) hair. The mami shares qualities with the hyper- sexualized black woman, but her skin color and hair type put her in a higher position in the Eurocentric desired hierarchy. The mami that appears in mainstream rappers videos are specifically referred to by origin, which was generally Puerto Rican (but now also refers to women of Dominican descent), when the mami fetish of the 1990s took off. The term is not only used in hip hop but in general conversation by the general population. The dictionary maintained by the Academy of Puerto Rican Spanish () states that the term is used to refer to one's mother, one's girlfriend or concubine, a beautiful woman, or even to a young girl.  Emergence of the mami figure in rap music  In the late 1990s, there was an emergence of a romanticization of Latino stereotypes (gangster and drug dealers) and usage of Spanish language in American rap music. From this trend came the view of Latinos, in particular women, as exotic version of the black counterparts, with a much more sexualized way of being. The use of the term mami in songs such as Diddy's song \\"Senorita\\" brought attention to the term as well as who it would represent in the media. There was also an awareness made to different types of mamis. The two distinct mami identities that emerged from these applications of stereotypes and Spanish language are the tropicalized mami and the butta pecan mami. The tropicalized mami is one that is an exotic, lighter-skinned version of black womanhood. The butta pecan mami is more in reference to a specific skin color (e.g. skin the color of butter pecan flavored desserts).  Critique of mami figure in hip hop Within hip hop, women who are involved are portrayed as objects or only as good as how they work the sexual aspect of their identity, both of which lead to hyper-sexualization. There has been a history of, in the last fifteen years, women who have been elevated to a higher status within hip hop, through the usage of sexuality and sexualization of themselves. In regards to Latinas in the hip hop community, the objectification of body parts through song lyrics, such as referring to a woman's \\"chocha\\", or vagina or vulva or pussy in \\"It's All About The Benjamins\\" by Puff Daddy, as well as the focus on the butt of Latinas, as referenced in \\"The Motto\\" by Drake has been a part of exposing mainstream media to the mami figure in hip hop. The women that are representing this image, such as Jennifer Lopez, also represent successes in the Latin community. The identities of the \\"successful\\" Latina and the mami Latina are ones that have been presented together, and have been critiqued for having been shown that way. This representation of Latina women as the mami figure is not broad enough and does not show the full spectrum of Latina women. Thus, it confines Latina women to one stereotypical and unachievable beauty standard. Recently, there has been a call to take a critical look at how the Latin community, in particular Latinas, are represented in mainstream media via their communities and public figures.  Popular mami figures in mainstream media  In mainstream media, some of the women who fall under the category of mami are Jennifer Lopez and Angie Martinez. While Martinez transgresses different categories across Latina and Black representations of women in rap, she is credited to be the original butta pecan mami. Jennifer Lopez also falls into the mami category due to her light golden skin and European-type hair. Twin singing duo Nina Sky also fits under the category of mami, in their appearance and in how they are represented through music collaborations, such as with artist N.O.R.E. in the music video for \\"Oye Mi Canto\\". =Angie Martinez= Angie Martinez is called the \\"Butta Pecan Rican\\". or the original butta pecan mami She was a female M.C. that received a large amount of media attention through her music, but primarily through her position as a radio host on New York City's Hot 97 radio station. =Jennifer Lopez= Jennifer Lopez at Pop Music Festival in S√£o Paulo, Brazil Jennifer Lopez, when she came to the height of her career in the late 1990s, was the highest paid Latina actress in Hollywood, as well as an icon of Latina womanhood. As her career progressed and she entered the music industry, there was a focus on her figure that was notable in her songs (Ex: \\"On The Floor\\", \\"Booty\\", \\"Dance Again\\"). One specific aspect of the mami identity that gets focused on in mainstream media are the bodies of mamis, in particular the \\"booty\\". Jennifer Lopez is well known in the hip hop community for her exceptional figure. Because of her \\"black\\" body, \\"good\\" hair and lighter skin, her Latina identity and figure is desired by many. Male rap artists, such as Diddy, have referred to Lopez's butt in part of their lyrics. For example, in the song \\"Big Ole Butt\\", Diddy (at the time, Puff Daddy) raps > She had the kind of booty that I'd like to get in ... I scooped this beauty, > like a big game hunter ... I put her big booty on the zebra skin rug Recently, this is most visible in the music video for her song \\"Booty\\". The conversation and fixation on the \\"booty\\" is one that is very much associated with the mami identity in contemporary times, which further dehumanizes women associated with the mami identity. For example, when Lopez appears in public, the fixation on her butt becomes the sole focus of attention, due to its difference from white-identified bodies, as it is a \\"stereotypical Latina butt\\" that is eroticized and fetishized.

She also served as the executive director of the Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity (METCO, Inc.) since 1973 . She grew up in Massachusetts and lived in Washington, D.C. during the 1930s and 1940s, when schools were mostly segregated and unequal. Early life and achievements Jean McGuire became the fourth Executive Director of METCO (1973). In this position, she has helped provide educational opportunities to numerous urban school children. This achievement was made possible by the fact that the METCO program provides direct and easier access to quality education.Danns, D. (2011). Northern Desegregation: A Tale of Two Cities.

She held the position on the School Committee for ten years up to the point when the committee was disbanded. Additionally, she has served as a board member on various associations including: The Children's Museum, Community Change, Inc., Encampment for Citizenship, Massachusetts Women's Political Caucus and the Black Educators Alliance of MA (BEAM).Angrist, J., & Lang, K. (2002). How Important Are Classroom Peer Effects? Evidence from Boston's METCO Program. Working Paper Series. In 2004, Jean McGuire won the humanitarian award of the year, on behalf of working for equal education opportunities among children. Furthermore, in 2012, McGuire became the recipient of the Community Change‚Äôs 2012 Lifetime Achievement Award for her work in the education system and segregated communities. Activist for equal education and quality teachers (1968-1973) Jean McGuire struggled during the '60s with the education system. She fought for more well-trained and, preferably, black teachers for the black community. She pointed out that the State College at Boston had a very low number of black students, despite the fact that it is located in Roxbury and had very reasonable tuition.Brown, K. (2005). Race, law, and education in the post-desegregation era. Durham, N.C.: Carolina Academic Press. A dedicated activist, in 1973, McGuire initiated and became head of METCO, one of the largest and oldest segregation/desegregation non-profit organizations in Massachusetts. McGuire increased awareness of the importance of giving children the best education possible despite their circumstances. She is a believer in the idea that children are the leaders of tomorrow, and it is this leadership that needs to be nurtured carefully and with education.Rossell, C., Armor, D., & Walberg, H. (2002). School desegregation in the 21st century. Westport, Conn.: Praeger The METCO program The METCO program began as a grass-roots program in 1966 with funding from the Carnegie Foundation. The program enabled more than 3,300 African American children from Boston and Springfield to attend suburban schools in such towns as Arlington, Braintree, Brookline, Lexington, Lincoln, Newton and Wellesley. METCO's goals included improving instructive opportunities for urban students, decreasing the racial separation of suburban schools, and diminishing isolation and de facto segregation of schools. The program had its beginnings in 1963 and 1964 when some African American parents began boycotting Boston schools for failing to integrate. In April 1965, the Advisory Committee on Racial Imbalance and Education appointed by the Massachusetts State Education Coordinator released a report detailing racial division in Boston's public schools. Among its findings: over half of the city's African American students attended 28 schools which were at least 80% black. To address this issue of de facto segregation of Boston public schools, the report recommended that African American students be bused from the city into surrounding suburbs that were predominantly white. Though the Boston School Committee rejected the report, the Massachusetts Racial Imbalance Act was passed in 1965. During that period, a group of African-American parents launched ‚ÄúOperation Exodus,‚Äù to transport their children from overcrowded schools to better-resourced city schools School Desegregation records, Boston City Archives After it incorporation in 1966, METCO became a vehicle for meeting the goals of the Massachusetts Racial Imbalance Act, which promotes racial and ethnic diversity in public schools.Angrist, J. D., & Lang, K. (2004). Does school integration generate peer effects? Evidence from Boston's Metco Program. American Economic Review, 1613-1634. It did not take long for the program to grow in popularity as the state began to provide grants to participating suburban districts. While METCO enjoyed early success as a peaceful, voluntary approach to desegregating Boston's public schools, it has been largely overshadowed by the violent busing struggle that occurred in Boston in the mid-1970s. As METCO has grown, the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education regulates the METCO award program. The department's essential part is to guarantee that the METCO salary is regulated effectively and that school areas get financing. The department likewise gives general oversight regarding strategy issues. Some of these approaches include admission and position, specialized curriculum, and scholarly and disciplinary desires. The department serves as the essential conductor of data with respect to the project to the board of education, the legislature, the media, and people in general.Fife, B. (1994).

The foundation sponsored four other influential projects: OutWrite, Off the Page, Queer Progressive Organizing School, and the Prison Project.Archives and Special Collections Finding Aids. (November 2012.) \\"The Bromfield Street Educational Foundation: Prison Newsletter Collection (1972‚Äì1996)\\". History The Gay Community News published its first newsletter in the Charles Street Meeting House in Boston on June 17, 1973. Established by eight members of the LBGTQ community, the publication started off as a local, community-based newsletter with the intent to create a voice for the gay and lesbian community. In less than one year, the Gay Community News upgraded from a two-page newsletter to a sixteen-page weekly newspaper. The office relocated to 22 Bromfield Street. On March 8, 1975, the publication became a voice in the gay community in the Northeast. Three years later, in the summer of 1978, members of the Gay Community News voted to become a national newspaper. The publication touched upon topics such as feminism, antiracism, multiracialism, class issues, AIDS, and sexual liberation. In 1979, the foundation fought to be recognized as a non-profit organization. It was believed that the newspaper would not receive the non-profit status without removing the word \\"gay\\" from the title. On July 1, 1982, The Gay Community News changed its name to the Bromfield Street Educational Foundation. The foundation was organized into three different categories: the board of directors, the paid staff, and the membership, which consisted of the board, staff, and volunteers. Six days later, the Bromfield Street office was destroyed in a fire. After much investigation, the fire was linked with arson. The foundation moved its office in 1982 to the fifth floor of 167 Tremont Street. In the 1990s, the foundation sponsored projects such as OutWrite and the Queer Progressive Organizing School that were beneficial to the gay community. In the last decade of operation, it moved from Tremont Street to Berkeley Street to 25 West Street and finally to 29 Stanhope Street. Funded projects The foundation funded projects that were progressive and beneficial to the gay and lesbian community. OutWrite was an annual conference between 1990 and 1999 for gay and lesbian writers. Between 1993 and 1995, Off-the-Page was a monthly readings series in Boston of gay and lesbian authors. Lastly, the Queer Progressive Organizing School was a forum in 1997 to organize progressive gay activists. The Prison Project From 1975 to 1999, the Prison Project supported gays and lesbians in prison. The project began when a staff member of the Gay Community News, Mike Riegle, responded to prisoners' letters. In return, he granted the prisoners a free subscription to the newspaper. The foundation helped fund the sending of books, legal assistance, and publishing the letters written by the prisoners. In 1977, both the foundation and the National Gay Task Force sued the federal prison for the right to gay publications in jail. For years, the foundation made it its goal to fight for the prisoners rights to receive copies of the Gay Community News as well as other gay and lesbian publications.

The rye India pale ale is a beer style that uses malted rye grains in the mash ingredients. The addition of rye adds a tangy or spicy character to the beer. Its use has recently grown in popularity among American Craft Brewers but has been a traditional brewing grain for many eastern European breweries for many years. History India pale ales have their own distinct history in the world of beer and brewing. Rye began to be used in the making of this style of beer because it was used popularly in other staples of food and drink. It falls under the Rye Beer style of brewing and is often called a \\"RyePA\\" in reference its sister brew, the already mentioned IPA. In America, rye has traditionally been used in baking for such things as pumpernickel bread as well as in rye whiskey. It was not a popular ingredient until the early 2000s. Popularity Overall, craft beer is growing in popularity worldwide. Within the craft beer market, IPAs are the most popular overall style, having a 47% increase in sale volume as of 2014. Because they are considered to be part of the IPA category, Rye IPAs are growing in popularity because of the different taste profiles they bring to the category. It has become a staple brew with many breweries who are known for their IPAs to increase the variety of styles of IPA they brew. The growing popularity of the use of rye has been coined the \\"rye spike\\" and can be seen in the increase in popularity of rye whiskey as well. Brewing with rye Rye is a grain and is used in addition to the other malted grain, normally barley, in the ingredients during the mashing process. Rye is known to be difficult to brew with because of its high beta-glucan content. This makes the filtration of the wort more difficult than normal. Rye is normally added to beer for its complex, crisp and distinctive, spicy flavor and sometimes adds a reddish color to the beer as well.

Earth's inner structure can be described both chemically (crust, mantle, and core) and mechanically. The lithosphere‚Äìasthenosphere boundary lies between Earth's cooler, rigid lithosphere and the warmer, ductile asthenosphere. The actual depth of the boundary is still a topic of debate and study, although it is known to vary according to the environment. Definition The LAB is determined from the differences in the lithosphere and asthenosphere including, but not limited to, differences in grain size, chemical composition, thermal properties, and extent of partial melt; these are factors that affect the rheological differences in the lithosphere and asthenosphere 12\\\\. Fjeldskaar, W., 1994. Viscosity and thickness of the asthenosphere detected from the Fennoscandian uplift. Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 126, 4 399-410.. = Mechanical boundary layer (MBL) = The LAB separates the mechanically strong lithosphere from the weak asthenosphere. The depth to the LAB can be estimated from the amount of flexure the lithosphere has undergone due to an applied load at the surface (such as the flexure from a volcano). Flexure is one observation of strength, but earthquakes can also be used to define the boundary between \\"strong\\" and \\"weak\\" rocks. Earthquakes are primarily constrained to occur within the old, cold, lithosphere to temperatures of up to ~650¬∞C. This criterion works particularly well in oceanic lithosphere, where it is reasonably simple to estimate the temperature at depth based upon the age of the rocks. The LAB is most shallow when using this definition. The MBL is rarely equated to the lithosphere, as in some tectonically active regions (e.g. the Basin and Range Province) the MBL is thinner than the crust and the LAB would be above the Mohoroviƒçiƒá discontinuity. = Thermal boundary layer (TBL) = The definition of the LAB as a thermal boundary layer (TBL) comes not from temperature, but instead from the dominant mechanism of heat transport. The lithosphere is unable to support convection cells because it is strong, but the convecting mantle beneath is much weaker. In this framework, the LAB separates the two heat transport regimes [conduction vs. convection]. However, the transition from a domain that transports heat primarily through convection in the asthenosphere to the conducting lithosphere is not necessarily abrupt and instead encompasses a broad zone of mixed or temporally variable heat transport. The top of the thermal boundary layer is the maximum depth at which heat is transported only by conduction. The bottom of the TBL is the shallowest depth at which heat is transported only by convection. At depths internal to the TBL, heat is transported by a combination of both conduction and convection. = Rheological boundary layer (RBL) = The LAB is a rheological boundary layer (RBL). Colder temperatures at Earth's shallower depths affect the viscosity and strength of the lithosphere. Colder material in the lithosphere resists flow while the \\"warmer\\" material in the asthenosphere contributes to its lower viscosity. The increase in temperature with increasing depth is known as the geothermal gradient and is gradual within the rheological boundary layer. In practice, the RBL is defined by the depth at which the viscosity of the mantle rocks drops below ~10^{21} Pa\\\\cdot s.. However, mantle material is a non-Newtonian fluid, i.e. its viscosity depends also on the rate of deformation. It means that LAB can change its position as a result changes of the stresses. = Compositional boundary layer (CBL) = Another definition of the LAB involves differences in composition of the mantle at depth. Lithospheric mantle is ultramafic and has lost most of its volatile constituents, such as water, calcium, and aluminum. Knowledge of this depletion is based upon the composition of mantle xenoliths. The depth to the base of the CBL can be determined from the amount of forsterite within samples of olivine extracted from the mantle. This is because partial melting of primitive or asthenospheric mantle leaves behind a composition that is enriched in magnesium, with the depth at which the concentration of magnesium matches that of the primitive mantle being the base of the CBL.  Measuring the LAB depth  = Seismic observations = The seismic LAB (i.e. measured using seismological observations) is defined by the observation that there exists seismically fast lithosphere (or a lithospheric lid) above a low- velocity zone (LVZ). Seismic tomographic studies suggests that the LAB is not purely thermal, but rather is affected by partial melt. The cause of the LVZ could be explained by a variety of mechanisms. One way to determine if the LVZ is generated by partial melt is to measure the electrical conductivity of the Earth as a function of depth using magnetotelluric (MT) methods. Partial melt tends to increase conductivity, in which case the LAB can be defined as a boundary between the resistive lithosphere and conductive asthenosphere. Because mantle flow induces the alignment of minerals (such as olivine) to generate observable anisotropy in seismic waves, another definition of the seismic LAB is the boundary between the anisotropic asthenosphere and the isotropic (or a different pattern of anisotropy) lithosphere. The seismic LVZ was first recognized by Beno Gutenberg, whose name is sometimes used to refer to the base of the seismic LAB beneath oceanic lithosphere. The Gutenberg discontinuity coincides with the expected LAB depth in many studies and has also been found to become deeper under older crust, thus supporting the suggestion that the discontinuity is closely interrelated to the LAB. Evidence from converted seismic phases indicates a sharp decrease in shear-wave velocity 90‚Äì110 km below continental crust. Recent seismological studies indicate a 5 to 10 percent reduction in shear-wave velocity in the depth range of 50 to 140 km beneath ocean basins. = Beneath oceanic lithosphere = Age of oceanic lithosphere. Beneath oceanic crust, the LAB ranges anywhere from 50 to 140 km in depth, except close to mid-ocean ridges where the LAB is no deeper than the depth of the new crust being created. Seismic evidence shows that oceanic plates do thicken with age. This suggests that the LAB underneath oceanic lithosphere also deepens with plate age. Data from ocean seismometers indicate a sharp age-dependent LAB beneath the Pacific and Philippine plates and has been interpreted as evidence for a thermal control of oceanic- lithosphere thickness. = Beneath continental lithosphere = The continental lithosphere contains ancient, stable parts known as cratons. The LAB is particularly difficult to study in these regions, with evidence suggesting that the lithosphere within this old part of the continent is at it thickest and even appears to exhibit large variations in thickness beneath the cratons, thus supporting the theory that lithosphere thickness and LAB depth are age- dependent. The LAB beneath these regions (composed of shields and platforms) is estimated to be between 200 and 250 km deep. Beneath Phanerozoic continental crust, the LAB is roughly 100 km deep.

In his younger years, he lived in Safed, Palestine, and traveled to Jewish communities in the Middle East and North Africa as a shadar (rabbinical emissary) to raise funds for the Safed community. He returned to Safed a few years before his death and was buried there. He published several halakhic works and also recorded the local minhagim (customs) of Tripoli and Safed, providing a valuable resource for scholars and historians. Biography Abraham Hayyim Adadi was born in Tripoli to Mas'ud Hai Adadi, the son of Hakham Nathan Adadi. Nathan Adadi was originally from Palestine; he came to Tripoli as a shadar (rabbinical emissary) and stayed to learn under Hakham Mas'ud Hai Rakkah, one of the leading rabbis of Libyan Jewry in the 18th century. He married his teacher's daughter and had one son, Mas'ud Hai Adadi. Abraham Hayyim was orphaned of both his parents at a young age and was raised by his grandfather. In 1818 Adadi accompanied his grandfather to Palestine, where they settled in Safed. His grandfather died that same year. The 18-year- old Abraham Hayyim enrolled in the yeshiva of Rabbi Yosef Karo, received rabbinic ordination, and studied to become a dayan (rabbinical court judge). In 1830 he was appointed as a shadar to raise funds on behalf of the Safed Jewish community. He traveled to Jewish communities in Syria, Iraq, Persia, Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, and Livorno, Italy. He was in Livorno at the time of the devastating Safed earthquake of 1837, and decided to return to his native Tripoli. He served the Tripoli Jewish community as a rav, dayan, av beit din, and rosh yeshiva over the next 30 years. He was regarded as the senior rabbi in Tripoli. Adadi paid special attention to the education of children of Torah scholars and children of the poor. Together with other rabbis, he signed a takkanah calling for each member of the community to contribute 3/1,000th of their income toward youth education. He also appointed a special overseer for the needs of the poor, and levied a 5 percent tax on local merchants to pay for teachers for poor children. In 1862 Adadi published the second volume of his great-grandfather Mas'ud Hai Rakka·∏•'s halakhic work, Ma'aseh Rokea·∏•. His cousin and contemporary, Hakham Jacob Rakkah, a great-great-grandson of Mas'ud Hai Rakka·∏•, published the third volume of Ma'aseh Rokea·∏• in 1863. In 1870, at the age of 70, Adadi returned to Safed with his wife, while his son, Saul, remained in Tripoli. Adadi died in Safed on Shabbat, June 13, 1874 (28 Sivan 5634), and was buried in the rabbinical section of the Safed cemetery. Works Title page of Vayikra Avraham (1865) Adadi was recognized as an expert in Talmud study, displaying an understanding of both the text and the historical differences between the writings of the Tannaim and Amoraim. He also recorded the history and minhagim (customs) of the Jewish communities of Tripoli and Safed in his books, providing a valuable resource for scholars and historians. In his first work, HaShomer Emet (1849), he included a poem that he had written in praise of the city of Safed. His main works are: *HaShomer Emet (The True Guardian), on the laws and customs of writing a Torah scroll. Published 1849 in Livorno, reprinted together with Vayikra Avraham in 1992 in Brooklyn, New York. *Vayikra Avraham (And Abraham Called), responsa on the four sections of the Shulchan Aruch. Published 1865 in Livorno, reprinted 1983 in Jerusalem. Appendices in this work include Sdeh Migrash on divorce and Yosef Amar, a description of Libyan Jewish customs.

They were the first foreign journalists killed after the 2001 invasion in the War in Afghanistan  Personal  Karen Fischer was from Stuttgart, Germany. She attended Northeastern University in the United States and earned her Masters in Journalism in 2000. She and Struwe were a couple (Lebensgef√§hrte), and they had met in Kabul in 2004. Fischer was buried in Leonberg, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, which is close to Stuttgart.  Career  Both Karen Fischer and Christian Struwe worked for Deutsche Welle, which is a German news service. DW was moving its Afghan radio service from Germany to Afghanistan. Struwe, a radio engineer and journalist, worked for DW for five years. He had just completed launching an international news office at Afghanistan's Radio Television Afghanistan (RTA), where he had also trained Afghan journalists. Karen Fischer had been with DW for 3 years, completing her internship there from 2002-2003. She had reported on parliamentary elections in Afghanistan. Before that she had been a reporter for DW in the Middle East and Lebanon. Both of the reporters were considered experienced foreign journalists and had traveled to Afghanistan multiple times in the past for personal or business reasons.  Death  Karen Fischer and Christian Struwe were on a private research trip in Afghanistan, on the way to the historic site of the Buddha statues of Bamiyan, where the Taliban blew up the cultural heritage site in March 2001. The two journalists had pitched a tent off to the side of the road to sleep for the night. Around 1:30 a.m., from four to six armed men with AK-47 rifles approached their tent and shot them. Their rented car also was shot. Afterward, the attackers escaped on foot. There didn't seem to be any sign that they were robbed. The bodies were found by villagers, who had heard the gunshots, a few minutes later. Police arrested six men and interrogated them shortly afterward. Investigation After solving the case of another German national, known as Christine M., who had been kidnapped at a restaurant in Afghanistan, authorities there announced that one of the four detained suspects was a possible \\"mastermind\\" behind the murder of Karen Fischer and Christian Struwe. Christine M. was pregnant at the time and she was working for the Christian aid Ora International organization. The detained group was described by police as criminals and not part of the Taliban.  Context  The area around Baghlan, where they were killed, was more secure than some of the country, but the area was not very well protected by the government. There were Germans in Afghanistan who questioned their decisions to backpack and tent instead of stay in a safe location and to not take a driver who knew the language and country along with their car. In addition, they may not have known enough about the customs in the rural area.  Impact  The killings happened on the fifth anniversary of the U.S. troops invading Afghanistan. Fischer and Struwe were also the first foreign reporters killed in Afghanistan since late 2001. Eight journalists in all died in 2001. After the event, officials from Afghanistan condemned the attack and expressed concerns about the safety of journalists in Afghanistan. Monika Harms, who is the Attorney General of Germany, opened a federal case and recalled the bodies for an autopsy in Germany. The bodies were from Baghlan to Kabul and handed over transferred to German authorities at the embassy there.  Reactions  The Taliban denied any involvement. Ko√Øchiro Matsuura, director-general of UNESCO, released an official statement: \\"I condemn the murder of Karen Fischer and Christian Struwe. It is essential that journalists, whether Afghan or foreign, be able to carry out their professional activities safely. Their ability to exercise their basic human right of freedom of expression is essential to the establishment of democracy and rule of law in Afghanistan.\\" German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier also condemned the murders, \\"This heinous crime must be solved and the perpetrators brought before justice.\\" The two journalists happened to be killed on the same day as Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, which remains a high-profile international case of a journalist killed for her reporting.

Most of his remarks were made towards the mayor's administration about the quality of governance in Palawan. He had many supporters, but he angered many with his commentaries. He was eventually assassinated and shot six times by men on motorcycles while he was driving, just weeks after grenades were found in his home.  Personal  Fernando Batul was born on May 24, 1969 in Puerto Princesa, Palawan. Batul attended Palawan State University where he graduated with a political science degree. He put his degree to use when he jumped right into serving in the government after college. He was killed two days before his 37th birthday.  Career  Fernando Batul began his work in the media in the 1990s when he was just a clerk in Crocodile Farm Inc. He was later given his own program, \\"Kulog at Kidlat\\", in 1997 in dySP. Batul became popular and gained many listeners because he showed them that he was just like them. Through his program he established the Kulog at Kidlat Foundation, which was geared towards helping poor people with the cost of medical emergencies and needs. As he became more popular, he decided to run for vice mayor of Puerto Princesa City in 2001 and won. However, when he ran for a second time, he lost to Lucilo Bayron due to an election protest against him. After his defeat for vice mayor, he continued in radio with a program called \\"Bastonero\\" at DYPR, which was owned by the Palawan Broadcasting Corporation. Batul was known to report on alleged government corruption and nepotism as he was highly critical of the city government.  Death  Fernando Batul was shot six times by men on motorcycles just 200 meters away from the radio station on May 22, 2006. Just a few weeks before that on April 24, 2006, Batul found two grenades on his property with a threat in the form of a letter pinned to his gate. The letter warned him to \\"hold his tongue or else his family would suffer harsh consequences.\\" More than ten members of Batul's family were inside his house when they found the grenades. Police were able to detonate them without any harm. His death may have been contributed to his commentaries, which could have sometimes offended local officials. Mayor Edward Hagedorn, one of the officials Batul would talk about, denied involvement with the murder right away and even offered a 2 million peso reward for anyone who could capture his killers. Four witnesses were able to identify Galifardo, a police officer, as one of Batul's killers and he was taken in as a suspect days after Batul's killing. Investigators have been trying to build a case against him since, as he is the prime suspect. Although he tested negative for gunpowder burns, a whole 72 hours had passed since the killing and Galifardo could have been to many places before he had to be tested. Not five hours after Batul's death, Galifardo was listed in a passenger seat leaving Puerto Princesa and going to Manila. Philippine National Police Chief Director, General Arturo Lomibao, to ensure an alright case against Galifardo, while trying to track down the other suspect who was allegedly driving the getaway motorcycle. However, in April 2011, the courts acquitted Galifardo of the crime. Evidence supported that he had left the day of the killing to attend a child support hearing in Camp Crame. With Galifardo having his innocence, the case of the killing of Batul is still left wide open.  Context  Before Batul was murdered, according to the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, 78 reporters were listed that were killed since democracy in the country was restored in 1986. Safety of journalists in the Philippines was becoming more of a concern as the Brussels-based International Federation of Journalists said the situation \\"has gone from bad to worse\\" after a tabloid photographer was murdered and hours later another journalist was beaten. A total of 120 journalists have been killed in the Philippines in line of duty since 1986 and Batul was the 67th. That means 66 journalists had been murdered before Batul in the Philippines before him in just 20 years. The month before the murder of Batul, he and his sister found grenades in his residence, but police were able to safely detonate them in the yard to prevent any harm. Two other journalists, who were friends, received threats prior to Batul's killing and they fled Palawan because they were worried about their safety. Also, the station where Batul worked, DYPR, once had to hire a security guard to keep angry listeners from attacking a different radio commentator.  Impact  Batul's death has impacted people and the society in many ways, from keeping people in hiding and trying to convince their innocence, to people fleeing and striking fear into other journalists. Letty Batul, Fernando Batul's sister, has described that since her brother's killing, many campaign journalists have fled the area. She also pointed out that the murder of her brother and another popular journalist, Gerry Ortega, had silenced serious whistleblowing journalism in the area. Batul's murder is still somewhat of a mystery as people are still questioning who really was behind the murder today. In 2013, Edward Hagedorn was still trying to convince people that he had no connection in the murders of Batul and Ortega. He compared his own situation as someone who has not gone into hiding with others who had fled, like the Reyes brothers who were still in hiding since evidence connected them to the murder of Ortega.  Reactions  On May 29, 2006, Ko√Øchiro Matsuura, director-general of UNESCO, condemned the murder of Fernando \\"Dong\\" Batul. In his statement, Matsuura demanded authorities bring the culprits to justice. He said, \\"It is completely unacceptable that murder be used to silence opinions. Such violence targets not only its individual victims but society as a whole, because open debate and the basic human right of freedom of expression are indispensable fundamental components of democracy and rule of law.\\" as said by Mr. Matsuura while giving his speech on the condemnation of Batul. Bishop Pedro Arigo of Puerto Princesa dedicated World Communications Day, May 28, to Batul who was active in Church movements. Father Eugene Elivera, who was the director of the local Church's Social Action and Special Concerns office, said on May 26 that all masses that Sunday would be dedicated to the slain Batul.

Personal  Anatoly Klyan was from Russia, and he was 68 years old when his death occurred. He was interned at the Troyekurovskoye Cemetery in Moscow with several colleagues who also died in Ukraine in 2014 while reporting. The other journalists buried there are Andrey Stenin, Igor Kornelyuk, and Anton Voloshin.  Career  Anotoly Klyan was an experienced cameraman as he covered many conflicts in areas such as Nicaragua, Yugoslavia, Angola, Mongolia, and Chechnya. His career in journalism lasted 40 years before his death. Klyan worked for the Pervy Kanal (Channel One Russia) broadcaster.  Death  Anatoly Klyan was fatally wounded while he was riding in a bus that was filled with different soldiers' mothers. The bus was trying to get to a Ukrainian military base in Donetsk, Ukraine. As soon as the bus approached the village called Avdiivka, which is near Donetsk, the bus was suddenly fired upon. The shooting was coming from the Ukrainian forces. Klyan took bullet wounds to his abdomen, but he continued to film on the bus until he told his colleagues that he could no longer carry the camera. Klyan was then placed in a car and taken to the hospital. He later died from his wounds in the local hospital. Klyan had been covering dangerous jobs for his whole career.  Context  The pro-Russian separatists of the War in Donbass were the organizers of this trip. There has been conflict between Kiev forces and pro-Russian separatists in the eastern regions in Ukraine, such as Donetsk and Luhansk. This conflict has caused bloodshed. At the time of Klyan's death, Ukraine was divided between pro- Russians and Ukrainian government supporters. According to a BBC News analysis by Stephen Ennis Klyan's employer has in its reports about Ukraine \\"sought to further demonise and dehumanise the Ukrainian army\\".How Russian TV uses psychology over Ukraine, BBC News (4 February 2015)  Impact  Klyan's death was part of a series of journalist deaths in Ukraine. He was the fifth journalist that was killed in the region in 2014. VGTRK lost two journalists and a technician in another incident in Luhansk on June 17. Klyan's death, along with other journalists in Ukraine, has caused anger in Moscow, as Moscow has condemned the attacks on it journalists there. Klyan's death also was part of a violation of a ceasefire agreement. Ukrainian soldiers were blamed by the Russian foreign ministry for the attack that occurred. The Russian foreign ministry demanded an investigation into the assault and attack. They demanded a punishment for the ones responsible for everything that happened.  Reactions  Irina Bokova, director-general of UNESCO, said, \\"I condemn the murder of Anatoly Klyan. I call on the authorities to conduct an investigation into the murder and bring to account those responsible. Journalists covering events in Ukraine must have an opportunity to fulfill their professional duty, which is to provide citizens with unbiased information and promote news-based discussions without any fear for their own lives.\\" Moscow was starting to protest. They were expressing their concern about ceasefire.

In November 1881, a line arrived from Terowie and the south, in 1882 it was extended north to Quorn. In 1888, a line was built eastwards to Broken Hill.Peterborough National Railway Museum Thus Petersburg became a four-way junction station (all narrow gauge) and the town was the headquarters for the South Australian Railways narrow gauge network, with an extensive locomotive depot. A roundhouse was added in 1927.Peterborough Railway Roundhouse & Turntable Aussie Heritage The roundhouse and turntable are listed on the South Australian Heritage Register. The station along with the town, was renamed Peterborough in 1917. As part of the standardisation project, the line between Port Augusta and Broken Hill was converted to standard gauge in 1970, thus Peterborough became a break of gauge station. As part of the project, the narrow gauge from Terowie was converted to broad gauge to match the rest of the line to Terowie from Adelaide resulting in Peterborough having all three South Australian track gauges. Following the conversion of the Adelaide to Crystal Brook line to standard gauge in 1982, Peterborough's importance diminished. By 1988, both the narrow gauge line to the north and broad gauge line to the south had closed. Today the former roundhouse is home to the Steamtown Heritage Rail Centre.

There is an ongoing struggle among sporting leagues, governments, and viewers to address the increasing number of domestic violence incidents committed by athletes that come to the sporting public's attention. The NFL, National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), National Basketball Association (NBA), and the sport of boxing employ and promote athletes who have committed domestic violence, which presents a dilemma when their offending becomes public knowledge. Most prominent are instances of domestic violence that are reported as being perpetrated by members of the NFL, due largely to the immense popularity of the sport in the United States and the role models the sport's participants are expected to be. Background Domestic violence among athletes specifically occurs off the field and is most often perpetrated by collegiate and professional athletes. Women are most often the victims during these perpetrations of violence. Football, a high contact sport, is played and watched by millions of Americans, and is at the center of the discussion surrounding domestic violence and major athletes. Scholars have worked on this phenomenon considering many variables when attempting to correlate the nature of athletes to domestic violence. Scholars (discussed below) have suggested that the violent behavior inherent in the football environment can be a potential accelerator or stimulator of domestic violence. Major sports franchises are increasingly criticized for their lack of action in regard to domestic violence. American football \\"Domestic abuse among professional athletes is not a new problem, but it became a nationally recognized issue when Baltimore Ravens football player Ray Rice assaulted his then-fiancee, now wife, [in 2014] and was only suspended from two NFL games.\\" The incident took place in an elevator in a hotel, in which Rice knocks out his wife- the video was released by TMZ. Prior to the incident, the NFL‚Äôs conduct policy stated that players would be disciplined for domestic abuse offense, but gave no specifics, so the league was left scrambling to come up with an appropriate punishment for Rice. After receiving a great deal of criticism for the light suspension, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell created new rules for players who abuse a partner, saying the first offense would lead to a six-game suspension without pay and a second offense would lead to being kicked out of the league for at least a year. The criminal behavior of football players has been studied more than that of other players in other sports. Because of the sport's intrinsically violent nature, one might suppose that football players are particularly prone to off-the-field violence. One of the NFL's biggest problems off the field is domestic violence, according to Jon Shuppe from NBC News over the last 14 years there have been 87 arrests involving 80 football players. A survey of 252 nationally-reported criminal cases in one year that involved athletes found that about 14% (49) of the athletes involved were professional football players. This compared to about 7% (25) professional baseball players and about 6% (twenty-one) of professional basketball and hockey players. While this does not draw any specific causation of the violence, the survey is at least suggestive that professional athletes who play other sports besides football also break the law in significant numbers, amounting to perhaps dozens of high-profile incidents each year. A contributing factor to domestic violence among football players may be that they are desensitized to physical conduct because it is a part of what they do all the time. Stanley Teitelbaum, a Ph.D Clinical Psychologist and author of \\"Sports Heroes, Fallen Idols and Illusions and Disillusions\\" agrees with the previous statement by Mitch Abrams, saying, \\"They're (elite football players) trained to be very aggressive and somewhat violent on the field, that's the nature of the game and that‚Äôs how they become important players. And sometimes it's difficult for athletes to turn that off when they go back to their regular lives.\\" Some players are raised in an environment where violence is used to resolve conflict. As one is raised in an environment that welcomes violence, their propensity to repeat what they've seen, or what has been done to them may increase. Adrian Peterson has said that he disciplined his son the way he was disciplined as a child, then went on to say that he will, \\"Never use a switch again\\" (in reference to accusations of disciplining his 4-year old with a whip.) In almost every case, the domestic violence involves male athletes who play violent sports physically abusing wives or girlfriends. In 2010, starting running back Steve Jackson of the St. Louis Rams was accused of beating up his girlfriend while she was nine months pregnant with his child. His former girlfriend, Supriya Harris, said that Jackson ‚Äúforcibly grabbed my arm, flung me against the door and repeatedly pushed me to the ground.‚Äù Jackson took Harris to the hospital and told her to tell the doctors she had fallen in the shower. Ten days later, she delivered their child, but the couple separated four months later after he threatened her again. Yet it is not clear that athletes are any more involved in serious crime than the general population is. In a follow-up study, Blumstein and Benedict (1999) showed that 23% of the males in cities with a population of 250,000 or more are arrested for a serious crime at some point in their life. That compares with the 21.4% of NFL football players who had been arrested for something more serious than a minor crime as reported in Benedict‚Äôs earlier study (Benedict and Yaeger 1998). In fact, when Blumstein and Benedict compared NFL players with young men from similar racial backgrounds, they discovered that the arrest rates for NFL players were less than half that of the other group for crimes of domestic violence and nondomestic assaults. Woods brings attention to issue of male entitlement, a topic that Benedict and Yaeger also shed light on. Some athletes develop a sense of entitlement as their fame grows. Whatever city they‚Äôre in, male athletes are surrounded by female groupies. The athletes often treat these women with disdain and yet are still tempted by their offers of sex. Wilt Chamberlain, a former great NBA player, boasted in his autobiography that he had slept with over 20,000 women, which, if true, shows a definite degree of deviance. NCAA A sensitive topic for many athletes is the apparent rise in violence against women among male athletes. Most men would be quick to say that they respect women and certainly don‚Äôt intend women harm. Here are some statistics from the National Coalition Against Violent Athletes on its website at ncava.org: A three-year study showed that while male student-athletes make up 3% of the population on college campuses, they account for 20% of sexual assaults and 35% of domestic assaults on college campuses. Athletes commit one in three college sexual assaults. The general population has a conviction rate of 80% for sexual assaults, while the rate for athletes is only 38%. These statistics were gathered from 107 cases of sexual assault reported at 30 Division I schools between 1991 and 1993. Critics of this study say the sample size was relatively small and was not controlled for the use of alcohol, the use of tobacco, and the man‚Äôs attitude toward women. Those three factors are the main predictors of a male‚Äôs inclination toward gender violence. More recent studies have corroborated the study by Crosset and colleagues, and one researcher concluded that ‚Äúa disproportionate number of campus gang rapes involve fraternities or athlete groups.‚Äù Due to the rising accounts of sexual assault on college campuses, the ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs On Us‚Äù campaign was launched in 2014 by President Barack Obama. The campaigns goal is to raise awareness of sexual assault by inspiring people to realize that it is everyone‚Äôs responsibility to do something, no matter how big or small. Over 200 universities have partnered with the ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs On Us‚Äù campaign along with sports organizations such as the N.C.A.A. According to an article from the New York Times [Tracy, M. (2015, April 4). College Teams Add Assault Prevention to the Basic Drills. New York Times, p. D1(L). Retrieved from http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA408139956&v;=2.1&u;=uiuc_uc‚Å¢=r&p;=AONE&sw;=w&asid;=995314d1760c4f8469e83b5843a303ab] \\"The Big East Conference, which like the N.C.A.A. was a charter partner of It's on Us, had its lawyers brief the presidents of its 10 universities on developments in law and policy over the summer. At several universities, athletes produced public service announcements; DePaul enlisted the Chicago Police Department's Sexual Assault Task Force for athlete training, according to the conference.\\" National Basketball Association In wake of the September media craze regarding the NFL's domestic violence issue, NBA commissioner Adam Silver said that his league will \\"take a fresh look\\" at its domestic violence procedures in the wake of the NFL's rash of incidents. Underscoring to the NBA Players Association ways to further educate players and provide programs to them and their families. \\"We learn from other leagues' experiences,\\" Silver said. \\"We're studying everything that's been happening in the NFL. We're working with our players' association. We've been talking for several weeks and we're going to take a fresh look at everything we do.\\" The NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell has been criticized for punishments that were too slow or lenient for Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson and other players involved in issues of domestic violence brought to light in September 2014. Goodell aimed to implement new personal conduct policies by the Super Bowl. The NBA's collective bargaining agreement calls for a minimum 10-game suspension for a first offense of a player convicted of a violent felony, however nothing regarding misdemeanor domestic violence charges. Silver says that the NBA has in place, the appropriate mechanisms for discipline, but also acknowledged that it is his wish to continually revise and revisit the policy if need be. Silver also mentioned that \\"most importantly, it's education, and it's not just the players, but it's the players' families. That's what we're learning, too. We have to take these programs directly to the players' spouses, directly to their partners so that they're aware of places they can go to express concerns, whether they're anonymous hotlines, team executives, league executives. And we're consulting experts. There's a lot to be learned here. It's a societal problem; it's not one that's unique to sports.\\" This proactive approach by Silver is surely helping the issue, but it does not diminish the fact that from 2010 to present, the NFL had an average arrest rate (for a population of 100,000) of approximately 2,466, followed by the NBA‚Äôs 2,157. Comparatively, professional baseball and hockey players clocked average arrest rates of 553 and 175, respectively, over the same period. Boxing/Floyd Mayweather Neither the World Boxing Federation or the Nevada Athletics Commission have rules forbidding boxers to commit domestic violence or sexual assault. Floyd Mayweather, Jr, the world's highest-paid athlete is arguably the face of the sport. Floyd had been charged with domestic violence on more than one occasion, but rarely are they spoken of. Recently during the Floyd Mayweather, Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao fight ESPN and HBO‚Äôs Michelle Beadle and CNN reporter Rachel Nichols, both of whom have covered Mayweather‚Äôs history of domestic violence, tweeted that Mayweather‚Äôs camp had ‚Äúbanned‚Äù them from the MGM Grand Arena, preventing them from covering there for the respective media outlets. The first documented claim of domestic violence occurred in 2001. After Mayweather and Melissa Brim, the mother of his daughter Ayanna, got into an argument over child support, according to court documents, Mayweather swung open a car door that slammed her in the head, then he punched her three times in the face, leaving bruises. In 2003, Mayweather was at a nightclub at the Luxor in Las Vegas when he spotted two friends of Josie Harris, who was the mother of three of his children. According to the testimony , Mayweather hit them both announced after following them outside the club, then. Outside, he allegedly picked up and shook a female security guard; police issued him a citation. A month after beating Arturo Gatti Mayweather went to trial on a felony battery charge. The previous year, Josie Harris had angrily confronted Mayweather about another woman. In response, Harris told police, he repeatedly punched her, kicked her, and dragged her by her hair, cutting her face. ‚ÄúMy babies‚Äô father just beat me up,‚Äù she said when she called 911. According to Lauren Holters article, Mayweather then, in 2010 got into another argument with mother of his children, Josie Harris, in which: punched her on the top of and in the back of the head. He allegedly kicked her, pulled her hair, and tried to break her left arm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to get someone to pour acid on you,‚Äù he also said, according to the police report. Zion, their 9-year-old son, gave police a voluntary statement about what he saw: ‚ÄúHe was punching her and kicking her. He was punching her in the head and he was stomping on her sholder [sic].‚Äù When Harris yelled for the children to call the police, Mayweather threatened them with violence if they did, and a friend who had come with him blocked the way, according to police. But Zion‚Äôs brother Koraun escaped, ‚Äújumped the fence,‚Äù and made his way to the main security gate, where he told the guard to call the police and an ambulance. A doctor‚Äôs examination of Harris afterward showed bruises and a concussion. Floyd Mayweather, who just made roughly 180 million dollars from the Floyd Mayweather, Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao, his domestic abuse charges however, remain a quieter issue in comparison to his money or his 48-0, undefeated record. Socio-Economics The statistics do show that the NFL‚Äôs arrest rate for domestic violence is only half of the national average arrest rate. However, the socio-economic factor needs to be considered. While no arrest data broken down by income, BJS survey provided breakdowns for victimization rates. Benjamin Morris, the researcher and writer of FiveThirtyEight, found that the domestic violence victimization rate for people from households making $75,000 or more was 39% of the overall domestic violence victimization rate, and for women ages 20 to 34 it was less than 20%. Although it is impossible to compare directly to the relative NFL arrest rate with precision, at least it gives some benchmark to show that people with higher income levels generally tend to have lower rates of arrest for domestic violence. The rate of domestic violence among NFL players is higher than expected for their income level, which could suggest that these athletes are indeed more prone to domestic violence.

Hearst Corporation (2d Cir. 2015) was a defamation case in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit protecting online news sources from having to remove or modify a story chronicling a person's arrest if that arrest is later erased from the record by the government using a criminal erasure statute. The Second Circuit found that when a news source reports on an arrest, and the government subsequently erases the arrest using a criminal erasure statute, the news stories do not become defamatory, because the historical fact of the arrest remains true. The ruling protected Hearst Corporation's news outlets from having to modify or remove their online articles after plaintiff Lorraine Martin's arrest for drug possession was erased for legal purposes using Connecticut's criminal erasure statute (an expungement law). The case is seen by some as evidence that United States law cannot accommodate a right to be forgotten like the one established in the European Union in May 2014. Background In August 2010, Lorraine Martin and her two sons were arrested in their home and charged with various drug possession offenses. Connecticut news outlets, including some owned by Hearst Corporation, posted accurate news articles online about the arrest. In January 2012, the state dropped its case against Martin and erased her arrest from official records using Connecticut's criminal records erasure statute. Martin then asked Hearst and the other defendants to remove the articles from their websites. They refused, and she sued, claiming that the articles had become false and defamatory because the erasure statute declares someone in her position to be \\"deemed to have never been arrested.\\" The United States District Court for the District of Connecticut held for Hearst Corporation, and Martin appealed to the Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit..\\" Court case The Second Circuit held that the news accounts of the arrest did not become false and defamatory after the arrest was erased, so the articles could remain online and defendants did not owe damages. According to the court, Martin \\"misunderst[ood] the effect of the Erasure Statute\\", which were intended to affect legal status but \\"cannot undo historical facts\\"; for example, the statute \\"bars the government from relying on [the erased record] in a later trial\\" and \\"entitles a defendant to swear under oath that he has never been arrested.\\" But \\"the reports of [Martin's] arrest were true at the time they were published,\\" and \\"[n]either the Erasure Statute nor any amount of wishing can undo that historical truth.\\" Judge Wesley, who authored the opinion, cited the Rub√°iy√°t of Omar Khayy√°m: \\"the Moving Finger has written and moved on.\\" The court also rejected Martin's defamation-by-implication claim. Martin claimed that even if the statements of her arrest were technically not false, the articles were defamatory by implication because \\"they only tell part of the story\\" and leave out the later erasure of the arrest, effectively asking that news outlets be required to update stories with information about the erasures. The court acknowledged the validity of the defamation-by-implication tort in general, noting that \\"even a technically true statement can be so constructed as to carry a false and defamatory meaning by implication or innuendo.\\" However, this was not the case here, according to the court. Wesley stated that \\"[r]eporting on Martin's arrest without an update may not be as complete a story as Martin would like, but it implies nothing false about her.\\" The court also rejected claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress (\\"because there is nothing negligent about publishing a true and newsworthy article\\"), invasion of privacy by appropriation (\\"because a newspaper does not improperly appropriate an individual's name or likeness merely by publishing an article that brings the individual's activities before the public\\") and false light (\\"because the articles do not contain falsehoods\\"). Despite the holding, the court also acknowledged that the \\"consequences of a criminal arrest are wide-ranging and long-lasting, even where an individual is subsequently found not guilty or the charges against him are dismissed.\\" Commentary Legal scholars noted the ruling's significance in relation to the right to be forgotten and the First Amendment. =Right to be forgotten= Internet law scholar Eric Goldman noted that Martin's suit was an attempt to work around the fact that there is not a right to be forgotten in the United States. He suggested that while the same result may occur under European law as applied to these news outlets, the U.S. and Europe could diverge when it came to search engines. Specifically, the Second Circuit's ruling would also protect \\"by extension any search engines indexing such coverage,\\" while European law would treat search engines differently and \\"force them to remove content that other publishers can publish.\\" =First Amendment= Law professor Eugene Volokh supported the District Court holding (which the Second Circuit upheld here), agreeing that if the statute had been interpreted to enable defamation liability, the law would violate the First Amendment. Similarly, Goldman noted that while the Second Circuit opinion did not mention the First Amendment, \\"if Connecticut or anyone else tried to extend [an] erasure law to cover third party publishers, the law would unquestionably violate the First Amendment.\\" See also * Defamation * Expungement * Right to be forgotten References Category:2015 in United States case law Category:United States defamation case law Category:Internet privacy case law Category:United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit cases Category:United States privacy case law Category:United States Free Speech Clause case law Category:Hearst Communications Category:Expungement Category:United States lawsuits ","title":"Martin v.

It uses the act of creating and sharing user-generated content as a way of connecting with and understanding people. Social media therapy combines different expressive therapy aspects of talk therapy, art therapy, writing therapy, and drama therapy and applies them to the web domain. Within social media therapy, synchronous or asynchronous dialogue occurs through exchanges of audio, text or visual information. The digital content is published online to serve as a form of therapy. Background Time spent online via email, websites, instant messaging and social media has increased: since 1999, more than 2,554 million people have become internet users. This alters the way people communicate with each other, and alters the connotation of certain words. The concepts of \\"identity\\", \\"friend\\", \\"like\\" and \\"connected\\" have adapted alongside technology. People are influenced by data sharing, social marketing, and technological tools. The devices that keep us connected have changed societal expectations and social norms. Therapists recognize the ways in which this affects clients' personal interactions. At least some therapists also understand the ethical implications of their own professional use of social media, as ethical codes have been adjusted to include the new media. There are multiple therapeutic services offered through the internet. Mental Health professionals can extend their services via email and video conferencing. E-therapy, online counseling, cyber therapy, and social media therapy are similar in that each utilizes the internet in order to provide therapy for patients. Controversy There are pros and cons when it comes to the subject of online therapy. Criticism of providing therapy through online methods comes from concerns over the lack of physical contact. There are important features of therapy created through face-to-face therapy such as transference and countertransference that can not be created through online therapy. Patricia R. Recupero and Samara E. Rainey stated in their article \\"Informed Consent to E-Therapy\\" of American Journal of Psychotherapy that the lack of face-to-face interaction increased the risk of misdiagnosis and misunderstanding between the E-therapist and patient, thereby increasing the risk of uncertainty for the clinician. There are also concerns over the internet creating a distraction from the therapy itself. Confidentiality and privacy concerns have been raised as well. Counter criticisms state that the physical distance does not matter.

Ikalto was known as one of the most significant cultural-scholastic centers of medieval Georgia, which is asserted by the ruins of some civil building preserved at the site of the Ikalto monastery. History According to sources, the first academy in this area was founded in the 9th century, but during the Arab invasions it was entirely devastated. During the Georgian Renaissance, the tutor of David IV of Georgia, scholar and philosopher Arsen of Ikalto initiated the idea of refounding academy at Ikalto. The first rector of the academy was Arsen who seems to moved here from the Gelati Academy. Most of Arsen's work consists of translations of major doctrinal and polemical work, which he compiled as his massive Dogmatikon, \\"a book of teachings\\", influenced by Aristotelianism. The most complete surviving manuscript of this work (S-1463) dates to the 12th-13th century and includes sixteen key authors, such as Anastasius Sinaita, John of Damascus, Theodore Abucara, Michael Psellos, Cyril of Alexandria, Nikitas Stithatos, Pope Leo the Great and others.Rayfield, Donald (2000), The Literature of Georgia: A History, pp. 40, 90.

Political institutions such as politicians, political parties, foundations, institutions, and political think tanks are all using social media platforms, like Facebook and Twitter, to communicate with and engage voters. Regular individuals, politicians, \\"pundits\\" and thought leaders alike are able to voice their opinions, engage with a wide network, and connect with other likeminded individuals. The active participation of social media users has been an increasingly important element in political communication, especially during political elections in the 2000s.Eli Skogerb√∏ & Arne H. Krumsvik, \\"Newspapers, Facebook and Twitter: Intermedial agenda setting in local election campaigns,\\" Journalism Practice (2015) 9#3 DOI:10.1080/17512786.2014.950471 From 2010 to 2014, there was a 15% increase in the number of Americans who use their cellphones to follow political campaigns and/or campaign coverage and that number continues to grow today. Social media is changing the nature of political communication because they are tools that can be used to inform and mobilize users in new ways. Users are able to connect directly to politicians and campaign managers and engage in political activities in new ways. Each social media platform is programmed in code by developers, creating a unique digital architecture that influences how politicians and citizens can use the platform for political ends. For example, by simply pressing the \\"like button\\" on Facebook or by following someone on Twitter, users have the ability to connect with others and express their views in new ways. The option for users to share, like, or retweet political messages instantly has opened up a new avenue for politicians to reach out to voters. At the same time, social media campaigns can carry risks that are not present on traditional platforms, such as TV or newspaper ads. Whereas the political party controls all of the messaging on a TV or newspaper ad, in a social media campaign, critics and opposing party supporters can post negative comments immediately below campaign messages. Politicians have a platform to communicate with that is different from the mainstream media. Politicians have the ability to raise large amounts of money in relatively short periods of time through social media campaigns. One in five adult Twitter users in the United States follow President Trump‚Äôs Twitter account. President Obama has 26% of adult Twitter accounts following him. In 2012 President Obama raised over a billion dollars for his campaign, which broke the fundraising record. Around $690 million was raised through online donations including social media, email, and website donations and more money was raised from small donors than ever before. Influence on elections Social Media platforms used in politics =Early history= Democrat Howard Dean is credited with being the first politician to use the Internet for political purposes. Dean served as the Governor of Vermont from 1991 to 2003 and decided to run for president for the 2004 election. Dean is credited with organizing the first campaign website, acting as a virtual headquarters for fundraising and volunteer recruitment.Hindman, Matthew. ‚ÄúThe Real Lessons of Howard Dean: Reflections on the First Digital Campaign.‚Äù Perspectives on Politics, 2005, p.121-128.

July 1, 2014. http://time.com/2946448/howard- dean-scream-obama-president/ Dean‚Äôs supporters hosted house parties and invited individuals to learn about Dean‚Äôs campaign. Dean also encouraged use of the website Meetup for his upstart presidential campaign in 2002, making it easy for people \\"with a common interest to find each other and arrange to meet, face to face\\". Individuals would attend face-to-face meetings to learn more about his campaign.Cornfield, Michael. ‚ÄúThe Internet and Campaign: A Look Back at the Campaigners‚Äù. Pew Research Center, 2005, p. 2 The number of people coming out to Dean's Meetups in 600 location across the country ultimately reached about 143,000. About 75,000 individuals attended these meet-ups and more than 96% of respondents reported that they wished to become actively involved in Dean's campaign. The engagement in face-to-face local groups \\"dramatically affected how involved volunteers got with the campaign. The more Meetups people attended, the higher their average donation to the campaign\\". Dean won a \\"digital\\" primary election that was held on MoveOn.org with 44% of the votes. His success in the primary generated positive coverage by the news media. This early victory was important to the momentum of the campaign. Dean's campaign was able to raise large amounts of money in small increments. In January 2004, his campaign had raised $41 million from supporters mostly online. A total of 318,884 individuals contributed to his campaign, with over 61% of the contributions under $200. Less than 1% of individuals gave $2,000, which was the federal limit. Dean's fundraising behavior was opposite of his rivals. George Bush raised $130.8 million in 2003 and 68% of his donations were the maximum donation limit.Justice, Glen. ‚ÄúCampaign Fund-Raising; Financial Firms are Bush‚Äôs Biggest Donors, Study Reports.‚ÄùThe New York Times. January 9, 2004. https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/09/us/2004-campaign-fund- raising-financial-firms-are-bush-s-biggest-donors-study.html =Political Origins of Facebook= Facebook is a place where people can freely interact with each other. \\"This means, for example, on Facebook, an individual creates multimedia content like a video on the cognitive level\\", which allows for mass interaction between hundreds of people. This free interaction between people on Facebook allowed the use of social media by political figures to help promote their own ideals. The creator of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, served as a field organizer for Democrat John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election.Slotnick, Allison. ‚ÄúFriend the President‚Äù. 2008. Zuckerberg was responsible for Get out the vote and mobilization efforts. Facebook was launched the same year. The Facebook Platform relies on group formation and constant communication, both of which are goals for any political campaign. Chris Hughes, a founding member and developer at Facebook, left the company to work as an adviser for President Barack Obama. While working at Facebook, Hughes designed a Facebook profile for the then presidential candidate. Following his departure, Hughes worked on Obama's Facebook page and utilized his knowledge of content management and new developments to outpace other candidates in relation to their online presence.McGirt, Ellen. ‚ÄúHow Chris Hughes helped launch Facebook and the Barack Obama Campaign.‚Äù Fast Company Magazine. April 2009. http://www.fastcompany.com/1207594/how-chris-hughes- helped-launch-facebook-and-barack-obama-campaign Hughes created the website MyBarak0bama.com which had a similar layout and concept as Facebook. In the 2008 elections Facebook was used by candidates. The main user during this election was former president Obama. The other user Mitt Romney used Facebook as well for his campaign, but not as much as Obama had. It is reported that well over 1,000 groups on Facebook were created supporting one of the two sides. In recent years, political figures have been using Twitter more often, but Facebook still remains to be a much used social media platform. = 2008 Presidential Election = The 2008 presidential election was the first election in which candidates utilized the Internet and social media as a tool for their campaigns. Nearly three quarters of internet users went online to learn about the candidates in the election; this equates to 55% of the entire adult population. Then President-elect Barack Obama was the first to use the Internet to organize supporters, advertise, and communicate with individuals in a way that had been impossible in previous elections. Obama utilized sites like YouTube to advertise through videos. The videos posted on YouTube by Obama were viewed for 14.5 million hours. Obama led McCain voters in all categories of online political activism, which is considered by some to be a major factor in his victory. Young voters are much more active in online politics. 30% of all those who posted political content online were under the age of 25. 66% of that same demographic voted for Obama while 33% voted for McCain, showing that Obama's prominence in online politics greatly increased his chances of winning. In the aggregate, the Democratic websites got more views than the Republican websites (at least in the primaries). This was due in part to the younger voters being more inclined to be in favor of the Democratic candidate as well as being more likely to go on the internet and research or show support for a candidate. =2012 Presidential Election= By the 2012 election more candidates were utilizing a wider array of social media platforms.Fouhy, Beth. ‚ÄúElections 2012: The Social Network, Presidential Campaign Edition.‚Äù Huffington Post. April 17, 2011 http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/17/elections-2012-social- media_n_850172.html Politicians were now on social networking sites like Twitter, Instagram, YouTube and other new social media tools and mobile apps. Some of the candidates used social media sites to announce their candidacy. Barack Obama emailed a video to 13 million when he announced his intention to run for re-election and Mitt Romney sent out a tweet. Obama produced a seventeen-minute long video, composed of video clips and interviews that documented Obama's first term in the office. This video was published on YouTube, allowing the audience to contribute to the campaign by donating without having to leave the website. This efficiency and convenience was the key point to further extend his fundraising target. This target would not have been achieved without the existence of YouTube, as sharing the link would have been more challenging. The campaign also heavily relied on social media sharing the video that included the donation link aiding in the fundraising. Other candidates posted on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to announce their candidacy. Each candidate ran their campaigns with more of an emphasis on the internet. Obama and Romney each hired third party companies to pull, track, and analyze data from their websites. This data drove them each to spend nearly $100,000 on online advertisements (Obama spent $93,400 and Romney spent $82,200). Though these numbers are close, in the aggregate, Obama spent more than Romney did on digital campaigns by a factor of ten. Romney spent $4.7 million and Obama spent $47 million. There is a clear difference between the Obama and Romney campaign's presence on social media throughout the 2012 campaign. In October 2012, President Obama had over 20 million followers on Twitter and Romney had 1.2 million. On Facebook Obama had over 29 million likes on his page and Romney had 7.9 million. On Instagram Obama had 1.4 million followers and Romney had 38,000 followers. President Obama had higher followers on all of his other social media accounts including Spotify, Pinterest, and YouTube,Wortham, Jenna. ‚ÄúThe Presidential Campaign on Social Media.‚Äù The New York Times. October 8, 2012. https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/08/technology/campaign-social- media.html?_r=0 though research suggests merely following Obama or Romney on social media sites such as Facebook may have had little influence on voter behaviors. President Obama also utilized his social media accounts more than any other candidate online.‚ÄúHow the Presidential Candidates Use the Web and Social Media: Obama Leads but Neither Candidate Engages in Much Dialogue with Voters.‚Äù Pew Research Center Journalism & Media.

President Obama's campaign thrived on online donations in both 2008 and 2012. In 2008 3.95 million people donated to president Obama's campaign.Scherer, Michael. ‚ÄúExclusive: Obama‚Äôs 2012 Digital Fundraising Outperformed 2008.‚Äù Time.

The total online donation also rose from $500 million in 2008 to $690 million in 2012. Political figures can use social media to accomplish tasks such as raising donations for their campaign. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie tweeted his support for Barack Obama in the 2012 election. He, at the time, boasted an 80% approval rating which led voters who were on the fence to support President Obama. =2016 Presidential campaign= The presidential elections of 2016 saw heavy use of social media across all candidates. The main three candidates were Donald Trump (Republican), Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton (Democrats). Research reports that, \\" In January 2016, 44% of U.S. adults reported having learned about the 2016 presidential election.\\" At this point, social media was being heavily used across all platforms including YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, etc. Specifically in the 2016 elections, Twitter was the main source which Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the 2 potential presidents, used to convey various things. Several reports and statistics show that several people received information about the election via social media. Roughly, \\"24% say they have turned to the social media posts\\" for information regarding the election. All presidential candidates used social media in a different way. While Trump's posts focused on links to news sources, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders focused on \\"highlighting official campaign communities.\\" During the campaigns of these main 3 candidates, Trump had a lot more response from users compared to the two democratic candidates. This is most likely due to the fact that Trump already had more followers at the beginning of the campaign. This election showed that several strategies could be used with social media. This is reflected in Trump's, Clinton's, and Sanders' use of social media. On Twitter, Trump mainly retweeted tweets from the general public, and Clinton and Sanders mainly retweeted tweets about their own campaign. The main two rivals of the campaign, Trump and Clinton, made several tweets directly talking about each other, Clinton used the @ feature of Twitter linking users to Trump's page. Trump referred to Hillary Clinton several times, but he almost never used the @ feature. You can see that Trump's main focus in his campaign on Twitter was the media such as Fox news or New York Times. On the other hand, Clinton and Sanders mainly focused on their own campaign. Another part of the strategy used by the Democratic side, Clinton and Sanders, is that some of their posts in Spanish. These two candidates had a focus on reaching out to the minority community which is reflected in these posts in Spanish. Donald Trump did not make any posts in Spanish. The use of videos on Twitter were used in different ways in the 2016 election. Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders mostly posted videos sponsoring their own campaign while Donald Trump posted videos related to news media (a very common theme in the candidates' strategies). Overall, Donald Trump (Republican) focused his strategy in social media in news media. Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton (Democrats) focused their social media strategy on promoting themselves. Social media such as Twitter continues being used by politicians today, and continues to grow more popularity in American politics. =Limitations and constraints= Social media has been used in political campaigns ranging from small local elections to larger-scale presidential elections. According to Wael Ghonim, social media can reinforce pre-existing beliefs rather than promote new ones. While social media can be used to raise donations, several candidates focused on using it to promote their own campaign. Politicians cannot control the conversation in social media. According to a study by Miguel del Fresno Garc√≠a, Alan J. Daly, and Sagrario Segado S√°nchez-Cabezudo, regular friends and followers hold high levels of influence on social media, instead of blogs and campaign pages. Users with the most influence over social media fall into three different categories: users who disseminate knowledge, those who engage other people, and those who lead conversations. These three types of users are the ones who others tend to follow and listen to through social media. Therefore, for political campaigns to truly reach as many people as possible, political groups first need to get those three users talking about their campaigns on social media. However, despite the many ways that social media can be utilized in political campaigns, many U.S. social media users claim that they are drained by the influx of political content in their feed. People worry that too much use of social media might cause less policy making in government. Instead of doing things such as making new laws, presidents might focys too much attention on social media to try to win over more supporters. Scandals Scandals have been a part of the American political system since its inception (see List of federal political scandals in the United States). Political scandals are events that capture a lot of attention and eventually disappear over and are the source of intense public communication. The media has been heavily involved in reporting the scandals that have happened in the past. In recent decades there have been an increased number of scandals relating to the Internet and social media.Arsenault, Amelia. ‚ÄúScandal Politics in the New Media Environment‚Äù Analytical Note: Scandal Politics Review. 2008. The first political scandal related to social media has been the demise of Congressman Anthony Weiner in 2011. Weiner, a Democrat from New York, sent a link of a suggestive photograph to a woman on his public Twitter account. The tweet and picture were then sent to Andrew Breitbart , a conservative blogger, who posted them to his website before Weiner had a chance to take the tweet down.Altman, Alex. ‚ÄúWeinergate: Anatomy of Social Media Scandal‚Äù Time. May 31, 2011. http://swampland.time.com/2011/05/31/weinergate-anatomy-of-a-social- media-scandal/ Within days the Anthony Weiner incident became national news. The scandal, nicknamed Weinergate, is considered to be the first sex scandal on social media involving a politician.Bradley, William. ‚ÄúWeinergate‚Äôs Lasting Impact: The First Big Social Media Political Sex Scandal.‚Äù Huffington Post. June 7, 2011. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/william-bradley/weinergates- lasting-impac_b_872585.html Other political scandals have emerged as a result of social media. Joe Miller a Senate candidate from Alaska tweeted about decorating his office prior to any announcement that he had won the race. Miller deleted the tweets, but not before a blogger was able to screen shot them. Miller eventually lost the election.Bosker, Bianca. ‚ÄúThe Most Embarrassing Politician Twitter Scandals.‚Äù The Huffington Post. August 3, 2011. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/03/politicians-top-twitter- s_n_870967.html Meg Whitman a Republican candidate in California was embarrassed following a tweet sent out by her press secretary that included a YouTube video of a cross-dressed musician. Whitman lost the election to Jerry Brown. Pete Hoekstra, a Michigan Congressman, got into trouble after tweeting throughout a trip to Iraq, in which he breached security by posting confidential details about the visit. Politicians have become more vulnerable to scandals due to their lives becoming more public on social media.Lunt and Livingstone. Media and Communications Regulation & The Public Interest. Sage Publication. April 4, 2011 http://www.uk.sagepub.com/upm- data/45145_Lunt_and_Livingstone.pdf Political scandals are shifting from illegal or corrupt activities towards personal missteps no longer about illegal or corrupt activities. On October 26, 2018 social network Facebook announced that it has deleted 82 accounts created in Iran that included posts advocating harsh issues such as race, immigration, and U.S. President Donald Trump, just before U.S. congressional elections on November 6. One of the political scandals of Trump's presidency was the Russian interference in the election through social media. There is broad agreement that Russians working for the Internet Research Agency used a variety of social media platforms to try and have an influence on the elections. The impacts of the social media scandals can be seen in the polarization of the country on this issue. 90% of Democrats were reported to have no confidence in Trump being able to handle the investigation of Russia effectively, whereas only 23% of Republicans were reported to have no confidence in Trump being able to do so. On the other hand, 36% of Republicans said that the Mueller investigation is important whereas 87% of Democrats said that it is important.

Category:Politics of the United States Category:Political communication Political communication in the United States, social media and Category:E-government in the United States ","title":"Social media and political communication in the United States"},{"id":"45241516","text":"In feminist theory, the principle of male-as-norm holds that \\"language referring to females, such as the suffix -ess (as in actress), the use of man to mean \\"human\\", and other such devices, strengthens the perceptions that the male category is the norm and that the corresponding female category is a derivation and thus less important. The idea was first clearly expressed by 19th-century thinkers who began deconstructing the English language to expose the products and footings of patriarchy. The principle of male-as-norm and the relation between gendered grammar and the way in which its respective speakers conceptualize their world has received attention in varying fields from philosophy to psychology and anthropology, and has fueled debates over linguistic determinism and gender inequality. The underlying message of this principle is that women speak a less legitimate language that both sustains and is defined by the subordination of the female gender as secondary to the accepted male-biased normative language. By regarding women's language as deficient in relation to that of men it has been assumed that something is wrong with women's language. Subsequently research in the social sciences, particularly in discourse analysis, has maintained and qualified systemic male bias. In practice, grammatical gender exhibits a systematic structural bias that has made masculine forms the default for generic, non-gender-specific contexts. According to the male-as-norm principle the male linguistic bias works to exclude and ignore women, diminish the female experience, and rule that all that is not male is deviant and unfit to represent many social categories.  Historical development  = Shift from sexual hierarchy to sexual binary (1800s) = In the eighteenth-century there was a radical reinterpretation of the female body in relation to the male. Prior to this change in thinking, men and women were qualified by their degree of metaphysical perfection whereas by the late eighteenth century there was a new model established on ideas of radical dimorphism and biological divergence. Biologists used developments in the study of anatomy and physiology to change the understanding of sexual difference into that of kind rather than degree. This metaphysical shift in the understanding of sex and gender, as well as the interplay of these redefined social categories, solidified many of the existing beliefs in the inherent disparities of men and women. This allowed scientists, policy makers, and others of cultural influence to promulgate a belief in the gender binary under a veil of positivism and scientific enlightenment. Since the eighteenth century, the dominant view of sexual difference has been that of two stable, incommensurable, and opposite sexes on which the political, economic, and cultural lives of men and women are based and social order is sustained. Contrary to modern day, \\"the dominant discourse construed the male and female bodies as hierarchically, vertically, ordered versions of one sex\\" rather than as \\"horizontally ordered opposites, as incommensurable.\\" In fact, it wasn't until the second half of the eighteenth century that the idea of two distinct sexes was established and, through the politics of the day, generated new ways of understanding people and social reality. The recognition and discussion of this transition by protofeminists around the 19th century established the foundation upon which feminists would later scrutinize gendered language, challenge the gender binary and its inherent prejudices, and develop the male as norm principle. = Mid-20th century =  Simone De Beauvoir  In 1949, French existentialist Simone De Beauvoir described in her book The Second Sex two concepts that would later be developed in the fields of linguistics and psychology and become the basis for the male-as-norm principle in second-wave feminism. Beauvoir writes that man is regarded as \\"both the positive and the neutral,\\" foreshadowing the study of markedness, or the linguistic distinction between the \\"marked\\" and \\"unmarked\\" terms of an opposition. Specifically, \\"the notion that the typical contrast between opposites‚Ä¶ is not symmetric.\\" Rather, the contrast between oppositions is often asymmetric meaning \\"the positive, or unmarked, term can be neutralized in meaning to denote the scale as a whole rather than just the positive end; but the negative, or marked, term can denote just the negative end\\". Unaffixed masculine or singular forms are taken to be unmarked in contrast to affixed feminine or plural forms. Beauvoir goes on to write that \\"there is an absolute human type, the masculine... Thus humanity is male,\\" and the neutralizing of man to include woman is no longer her subject, rather the masculinizing of the whole human species to exclude woman‚Äìor at least to otherize her. Thus, introducing her second concept and foreshadowing the psychological concept of prototypicality and the development of the prototype theory in the 1970s. \\"The prototype theory is a model of graded categorizations, where some members of a category are more central than others. A prototype helps to explain the meaning of a word by resembling to the clearest exemplar\\". \\"All members of a category do not have equal status in the mind of the human perceiver; some members are instead perceived as more equal‚Äìor more prototypical‚Äìthan other members‚Ä¶ Like the prototypical member of any category, the male is taken to be the cognitive reference point, the standard, for the category of human being; and like the non-prototypical members of any category, the female is taken to be a variation on that prototype, a less representative example of the human species\\".  Luce Irigaray  Just as Simone de Beauvoir had done in recent decades, French feminist and literary scholar Luce Irigaray centered her ideas regarding the male as norm principle around the idea that women as a whole are otherized by systematic gender inequality, particularly through gendered language and how female experience and subjectivity are defined by variation from a male norm; through opposition in a phallocentric system where language is deliberately employed as a method of protecting the interests of the phallus and subliminally affirming his position as norm. Irigaray affirms that the designation of woman as an inferior version of men, an aberrant variation from the male norm, is reflected throughout Western history and philosophy. Notably, Freud made similar sense of gender dynamics in his designation of women as 'little men'. In this tradition of inequality women are measured against a male standard, seen in comparison ‚Äì as lack, complementary or the same. She asserts that any perception of difference between the two genders is an illusion. \\"Where women are not the same as men, they fail to exist altogether.\\"  Dale Spender  Dale Spender is one of the most cited feminist scholars to work with the male-as-norm principle. She claims that \\"patriarchy is a frame of reference, a particular way of classifying and organizing the objects and events of the world\\" With language we classify and organize the world and through which we have the ability to manipulate reality. In this way, if our language is systematically flawed and/or rests on an understructure of invalid rules then we are misled and deceived at a fundamental perceptual level. The rules by which we make meaning, ones intrinsically associated with language, had to be invented and defined. These linguistic rules establish our frame of reference, order, and the grounds from which we interpret and comprehend reality. Spender explains that these rules become self-validating and self-perpetuating with the passing of time, regardless of the validity of the beliefs and/or interpretations on which they were founded. Spender claims that the semantic rule of male as norm may appear to be ineffectual in producing the purported significant social impact concluded by many feminists however this is in fact part of why the rule is so pervasive and superlatively harmful in the construction of our perceptions of gender. As long as this rule remains central to gendered languages users of these languages will continue to classify the world on the premise that males are the standard, normal being and that those who are not male will be considered deviant. Speakers will continue to divide humanity into two unfairly biased parts. \\"By arranging the objects and events of the world according to these rules we set up the rationale, and the vindication, for male supremacy.\\"  Gerda Lerner  Over the course of feminist historian Gerda Lerner's career, Lerner focuses her studies on patriarchal power and the history of the subordination of women. By examining gender stratification in various societies throughout human history in accordance with language, Lerner provides an in-depth look into the historical and modern significance of the male as norm principle. She was one of the founders of the field of women's history and played a key role in the development of women's history curricula. In Lerner's book The Creation of Patriarchy (1986), she addresses how men have in history appropriated the major symbols of female power, constructed religions around \\"the counterfactual metaphor of male procreativity,\\" and have \\"redefined female existence in a narrow and sexually dependent way.\\" She explains that the metaphors for gender, created and promoted by men, have \\"expressed the male as norm and the female as deviant; the male as whole and powerful, the female as unfinished, mutilated, and lacking in autonomy.\\" According to Lerner, men have constructed, explained, and defined the world in their own terms and have placed themselves at the center of discourse. Lerner goes on to explain how men, by establishing male- centered language and discourse as the norm, have in turn demanded an androcentric perspective and necessitated the conceptualization of women as less than men and have distorted the definition of woman to the degree that their experiences, autonomy, and viewpoints have been lost to modern consideration. In turn, men have come to believe that their experiences, viewpoint, and ideas represent all of human experience and thought. She concludes that as long as men are unable to recognize the female perspective and as long as they believe they have the only legitimatize human experience they will be unable to accurately define and understand reality.  Modern perspectives  = Sue Wilkinson = In 1997 Sue Wilkinson, a professor of Feminist and Health Studies from Loughborough University, wrote that there are distinct theoretical traditions in feminism that assert women's inferiority, two of which are rooted in the idea of male-as-norm. First, psychology has mismeasured women throughout its history by taking a male-as-norm perspective which categorizes females as deviant; or, in other words of Simone De Beauvoir, the science of psychology has systematically \\"otherized\\" women. Another way which Wilkinson sees women's inferiority asserted is through psychologists seeking a different perspective, the female perspective, by listening to women's voices and drawing on, and feeding back into, preconceived ideas regarding female moral and cognitive processes as they differ from those of males. Wilkinson writes that we should reconstruct the question of sex differences and that we need to dismantle maleness and femaleness as fundamental categories. = Jeannine Hill Fletcher = In her book Motherhood as Metaphor: Engendering Interreligious Dialogue, professor of theology Jeannine Hill Fletcher of Fordham University notes that scripture and Christians theological writings have presented theological anthropology from a male-as-norm perspective due to a history of predominantly male theologians and philosophers. She notes that this has had disastrous effects on the lives of women and the valuation of the female perspective and consequently the history of Christian theology has missed opportunities for opening new understandings of what it means to be human.

By 1942, Nazi Germany occupied much of continental Europe. The widespread German occupation saw the fall of public media systems in Northern France, Belgium, Poland, Norway, Czechoslovakia, Northern Greece, and the Netherlands. All press systems were put under the ultimate control of Joseph Goebbels, the German Minister of Propaganda. Without control of the media, occupied populations began to create and publish their own uncensored newspapers, books and political pamphlets. The underground press played a \\"crucial role\\" in informing and motivating resistance across the continent and building solidarity. They also created an \\"intellectual battlefield\\" in which ideas like post-war reconstruction could be discussed. Underground forms of media allowed for information sharing among the oppressed, helping them build solidarity, strengthen morale and, in some cases, stage uprisings. By country =Belgium= Examples of mimeograph machines used by the Belgian resistance to produce illegal newspapers and publications An important underground press emerged from the Belgian Resistance in German-occupied Belgium soon after the defeat in May 1940. Eight underground newspapers had appeared by October 1940 alone. Much of the resistance's press focused around producing newspapers in both French and Dutch languages as alternatives to censored or pro-collaborationist newspapers. At its peak, the clandestine newspaper La Libre Belgique, a title which had first appeared under German occupation in World War I, was relaying news within five to six days; faster than the BBC's French-language radio broadcasts, whose coverage lagged several months behind events. Copies of the underground newspapers were distributed anonymously, with some pushed into letterboxes or sent by post. Faux Soir was a one-edition satirical issue of the German-controlled Le Soir newspaper Since they were usually free, the costs of printing were financed by donations from sympathisers. The papers achieved considerable circulation, with reaching a regular circulation of 40,000 by January 1942 and peaking at 70,000, while the Communist paper, , reached 30,000. Dozens of different newspapers existed, often affiliated with different resistance groups or differentiated by political stance, ranging from nationalist, Communist, Liberal or even Feminist. The number of Belgians involved in the underground press is estimated at anywhere up to 40,000 people. In total, 567 separate titles are known from the period of occupation. The resistance also printed humorous publications and material as propaganda. In November 1943, on the anniversary of the German surrender in the First World War, the group published a spoof edition of the censored newspaper , satirizing the Axis propaganda and biased information permitted by the censors. The new newspaper was then distributed to newsstands across Brussels and deliberately mixed with ordinary official newspapers to be sold to the public. 50,000 copies of the spoof publication, dubbed the \\"Faux Soir\\" (literally, the \\"Fake Le Soir\\"), were sold. In 2012, the Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary Society (Cegesoma) launched a project to digitally archive all surviving Belgian clandestine publications from both World War I and II. =Channel Islands= The Channel Islands were occupied by Germany in June 1940 and were the only part of the United Kingdom invaded during the war. Although little active resistance occurred, a number of underground publications existed. The most notable was the Guernsey Underground News Sheet, or GUNS, on Guernsey. The newspaper, directed by Frank Falla and published between 1942 and 1944, reproduced material from BBC news bulletins. Its workers were denounced in February 1944 and deported to concentration camps. =Czechoslovakia= An underground press emerged rapidly in Czechoslovakia after the German annexation and invasion of 1938-39. One of the first was the newspaper V boj (To Fight) published by Josef Skalda in Prague. Although it achieved a circulation of 10,000, Skalda was arrested in November 1939 and the publication ceased. Later newspapers included the Voice of the People and National Liberation. In 1941, during German occupation of Czechoslovakia, the Czech Resistance was in radio contact with the exiled Czech government in London. These radios were strategically airdropped by Allied forces, and by October 1941, all resistance radios had been discovered by the Gestapo. There were multiple airdrops in 1942 that led to new radio contact between January and June 1942. These secret radio stations were not only used with the sole purpose of communicating with London, but could also reach the Czech people. These secret radio stations would broadcast military intelligence and reports of both Nazi movements and Allied movements. These reports varied, some were true, some were false and served only to raise national morale. Many consider these clandestine radios to be a failure for their lack of reporting on the state of the Jewish population in Czechoslovakia, under Nazi rule. The Czechoslovak resistance groups were also known to send anti-Nazi pamphlets into Germany, in hopes that anti-fascist Germans would rise up against the Nazi regime. They would hide the small books and other pieces of anti-Nazi literature in tea pouches, shampoo, plant seed packaging, and German tourist pamphlets etc. One of the better known pamphlets was inside the German tourism brochure Lernen Sie Das Shone Deutschland Kennen (Learn About Beautiful Germany) which included a map of the Nazi death camps. =Denmark= Following their invasion of Denmark in 1940, the Germans did not confiscate the population's radios, removing much of the need for underground media. Only with the 1941 banning of the Communist Party of Denmark did a significant underground press emerge, with the illegal continued publishing of the Communist Party's paper Land og Folk. At its height, Land og Folk reached a circulation of 130,000, and was the largest underground newspaper in Denmark throughout the German occupation. In respectively December 1941 and April 1942 the major bipartisan papers De Frie Danske and Frit Danmark followed. In all some 600 different underground papers were published in Denmark. With the population having access to news from the United Kingdom and Sweden through radio, the underground press in Denmark focussed on opinion pieces until 1943, when relations being Danish authorities and the Germans deteriorated. The only paper established in wartime Denmark that is still being published is Information. =France= France was invaded and occupied after a disastrous military campaign in May‚ÄìJune 1940. Under the armistice agreement, the country was divided into two zones: an area in the northern half of the country (including Paris) under direct German military occupation and a \\"Free Zone\\" in the South ruled by the semi-independent (lit.: \\"French State\\") under Marshal Philippe P√©tain. Frustration and unrest in both parts led to the emergence of the French Resistance which, by 1942, had become a mass movement. The D√©fense de la France, a French underground newspaper, for 14 July 1943 The first French underground newspapers emerged in opposition to German and Vichy control over of French radio and newspapers. In the German-occupied zone, the first underground titles to emerge were Pantagruel and Libre France, which both began in Paris in October 1940. In Vichy France, the first title to emerge was Libert√© in November 1940. Few produced issues for both German and Vichy zones, though Lib√©ration was an early exception. In early newspaper issues, individuals often wrote under a number of pseudonyms in the same issue to convey the impression that a team of individuals was working on a newspaper. Initially underground newspapers represented a wide range of political opinions but, by 1944, had generally converged in support of Gaullist Free French in the United Kingdom. The four major clandestine newspapers during the German occupation were D√©fense de la France, R√©sistance, Combat and Lib√©ration. D√©fense de la France was founded by a group of parisian students in the summer of 1941. After the invasion of the Soviet Union, these were joined by a number of communist publications including L'Humanit√© and Verit√©. These newspapers were anti-Nazi propaganda, but practiced propaganda themselves by misreporting events, and glorifying and enlarging Allied victories. The reporting in these newspapers was often subjective, as they aimed to capture and shape public opinion rather than accurately represent it. The extent to which underground newspapers actually affected French popular opinion under the occupation is disputed by historians. A small number of underground presses were also active in printing illegal books and works of literature. The most notable example of this was Le Silence de la mer by Jean Bruller published illegally in Paris in 1942. Its publisher, \\"Les √âditions de Minuit\\", became a successful commercial literary publisher in post-war France. The Biblioth√®que nationale de France (BnF) began a project in 2012 to digitise surviving French underground newspapers. By 2015, 1,350 titles had been uploaded on its Gallica platform. =Greece= Greece was invaded by Italy in October 1940, but not occupied until after the German invasion in April 1941. Greece was occupied and divided into German, Italian and Bulgarian zones and a Greek puppet government was created. Greek Resistance emerged rapidly. The left-leaning National Liberation Front (Ethniko Apeleftherotiko Metopo, or EAM) published the country's first underground newspaper, Forward (Embros), in January 1942. A group of former army officers, organized into the Army of Enslaved Victors (Stratia Sklavomenon Nikiton) began publishing a newspaper called Great Greece (Megali Ellas). The Panhellenic Union of Fighting Youths (Panell√≠nios √ânosis Agoniz√≥menon N√©on, or PEAN) published an alternative newspaper called Glory (Doxa) in both German-occupied Athens and the Bulgarian-occupied Macedonia. The pre-war newspaper The Radical (Rizospastis), produced by the Communist Party of Greece, was produced as an underground publication. Other newspaper included Fighting Greece (Mahomeni Ellas). =Luxembourg= Luxembourg was invaded by Nazi Germany in May 1940 and was conquered in less than a day. The German occupation authority considered Luxembourgers, although largely bilingual in French and German, to be a Germanic people and thus suitable for annexation into Germany itself by 1942. A resistance emerged with the foundation of the L√´tzeburger Patriote Liga (LPL) in August 1940 and soon grew. The first underground newspaper, Ons H√©mecht (Our Homeland), was published by the LPL but soon ceased publication after its directors were arrested. The main newspaper of the occupation period was the De Freie L√∂tzeburger (The Free Luxembourger), also printed by the LPL and based on La Libre Belgique. It was printed in Belgium. Ons H√©mecht was restarted by the De Freie L√∂tzeburger late in the war. =Netherlands= Fearing that Dutch exposure to Allied radio programming would turn the Dutch against them, the Nazis called for the confiscation of all radio transmitters soon after the country was occupied in May 1940. By May 1943, they had confiscated nearly 80 percent of Dutch radios, amounting to just over one million sets. With the Nazi grip on the media tightening, many Dutch households hid their radios, receiving illegal broadcasts from the BBC and Radio Oranje (Radio Orange) that kept them up to date on Allied forces and their accomplishments on the war front ‚Äì and in some cases messages that helped them resist Nazi rule. Allied radio broadcasts were so important to the Dutch people that many people began building crystal radios. Crystal radios were fairly easy to build and could be made quickly in large quantities. Their main advantage was that they required no batteries and could only be heard by those operating them but were very hard to control or tune.Graef, Robert. Bicycling to Amersfoort: A World War II Memoir. Lincoln: IUniverse, 2005. Print. During the Dutch famine (Hongerwinter) of 1944, many people smuggled crystal radios to farmers in exchange for fresh produce. De Vonk, preserved at the Verzetsmuseum in Amsterdam There were a number of underground Dutch newspapers, the first and most notable, however, was Het Parool. Het Parool was founded in February 1941 by Frans Goedhart, who went by the pseudonym \\"Pieter 't Hoen\\" (Peter the Chicken). The first issue of Het Parool (August 1941) saw a circulation of 6,000, a number that never significantly rose due to security issues. In 1943, Frans Goedhart was captured by Nazi officials and tried in a German court. To conceal his secret identity as Pieter 't Hoen, writers at Het Parool periodically published articles under his pseudonym. In August 1943, Goedhart was sentenced to death. He escaped three days before his execution, with the help of Dutch officials. Upon his escape, Goedhart returned to his position of editor at the newspaper Het Parool. Het Parool's main objective was to raise national moral and organize the Dutch people against Nazi rule. After the Germans began their occupation, working on an illegal newspaper was punishable by immediate jail time, and in the latter years of the war, death. Before the end of the war, four editors at Het Parool were sentenced to death, while two escaped to ally countries. Altogether, as many as 1,200 separate newspaper titles were produced by the Dutch resistance during the war. Collectively, the underground press provided a space for free debate about political and religious issues, as well as for planning for after the liberation. =Norway= Alt for Norge, a minor newssheet produced by the Communist Party of Norway, from 1944 The first underground newspapers in occupied Norway were published by the nascent Norwegian resistance movement in the summer of 1940, soon after the conclusion of the Norwegian Campaign. The main purpose of the underground newspapers was to distribute news from BBC Radio, as well as messages and appeals from the Norwegian government in exile. Some 300 underground newspapers were published in Norway during the war, the biggest of which was London-Nytt, and 12,000 to 15,000 people were involved in their distribution. From the autumn of 1941, the Norwegian communists joined the underground press, publishing newspapers such as Friheten. In October 1942, the German authorities in Norway made it a capital crime to read underground newspapers. Of the people involved in the underground press in Norway, 3,000 to 4,000 were arrested by the Germans, of whom 62 were executed and a further 150 died as a consequence of their captivity. =Poland= There were over 1,000 underground newspapers; among the most important were the Biuletyn Informacyjny of Armia Krajowa and Rzeczpospolita of the Government Delegation for Poland. In addition to publication of news (from intercepted Western radio transmissions), there were hundreds of underground publications dedicated to politics, economics, education, and literature (for example, Sztuka i Nar√≥d). The highest recorded publication volume was an issue of Biuletyn Informacyjny printed in 43,000 copies; average volume of larger publication was 1,000‚Äì5,000 copies. The Polish underground also published booklets and leaflets from imaginary anti-Nazi German organizations aimed at spreading disinformation and lowering morale among the Germans. Books were also sometimes printed. Other items were also printed, such as patriotic posters or fake German administration posters, ordering the Germans to evacuate Poland or telling Poles to register household cats. The two largest underground publishers were the Bureau of Information and Propaganda of Armia Krajowa and the Government Delegation for Poland. Tajne Wojskowe Zak≈Çady Wydawnicze (Secret Military Publishing House) of Jerzy Rutkowski (subordinated to the Armia Krajowa) was probably the largest underground publisher in the world. Tajne Wojskowe Zak≈Çady Wydawnicze in WIEM Encyklopedia. Retrieved on June 15, 2008 In addition to Polish titles, Armia Krajowa also printed false German newspapers designed to decrease morale of the occupying German forces (as part of Action N). The majority of Polish underground presses were located in occupied Warsaw; until the Warsaw Uprising in the summer of 1944 the Germans found over 16 underground printing presses (whose crews were usually executed or sent to concentration camps). The second largest center for Polish underground publishing was Krak√≥w. There, writers and editors faced similar dangers: for example, almost the entire editorial staff of the underground satirical paper Na Ucho was arrested, and its chief editors were executed in Krak√≥w on 27 May 1944. (Na Ucho was the longest published Polish underground paper devoted to satire; 20 issues were published starting in October 1943.) The underground press was supported by a large number of activists; in addition to the crews manning the printing presses, scores of underground couriers distributed the publications. According to some statistics, these couriers were among the underground members most frequently arrested by the Germans.

Google, 676 F.3d 144 (4th Cir. 2012), was a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit that challenged the legality of Google's AdWords program. The Court overturned a grant of summary judgment for Google that had held Google AdWords was not a violation of trademark law (see federal Lanham Act,(1)). Though other cases had addressed trademark infringement in the context of online keyword advertising (see Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Netscape Communications Corp., Google, Inc. v. American Blind & Wallpaper Factory, Inc.) Rosetta Stone v. Google is considered the last serious American challenge to Google's AdWords program. Although Rosetta Stone 'won' an overturn of summary judgment, the subsequent settlement between the two parties led commentators to declare that Google had won the keyword advertising trademark fight. Background Google has used a version of keyword advertising, now known as Google Ads and previously knowm as Google AdWords, since October 2000. Google places paid ads at the top and bottom of its search results page. Every time someone enters a search, Google runs an auction to determine which ads to show. The auction takes into account the relevancy of the ad as well as the monetary bid that has been made for that keyword by each advertiser. Most advertisers with Google pay on a cost per click basis. In 2004, Google changed its policy and began allowing advertisers to bid on trademarked words. In 2009, Google further changed its AdWord policy now allowing use of trademarks both in advertising text and as advertisement keywords. As a result of the policy change, more than twenty lawsuits were filed against Google alleging trademark infringement. In response to the changed AdWord policy, Rosetta Stone, the maker of popular foreign language learning software, filed suit against Google for violating the Lanham Act, claiming Google was \\"helping third parties to mislead consumers and misappropriate the Rosetta Stone Marks by using them as \\"keyword\\" triggers for paid advertisements and by using them within the text or title of paid advertisements\\". Rosetta Stone sued specifically for: direct trademark infringement, contributory trademark infringement, vicarious trademark infringement, and trademark dilution. Rosetta Stone also sued for unjust enrichment under Virginia state law. The district court granted Google's motion for summary judgment on all Lanham Act claims finding there had been no consumer confusion, Google's use of the trademarked keywords was functional, and the use of the trademarked keywords was either nominative fair use or contributed to an increase in Rosetta Stone's brand recognition. The district court also granted Google's motion to dismiss Rosetta Stone's unjust enrichment claim. Rosetta Stone appealed to the Fourth Circuit on all claims, which reviewed the case de novo. Holding of the Court The Fourth Circuit reversed the district court's grant of summary judgment for the direct trademark infringement, contributory trademark infringement and trademark dilution. The Court affirmed the grant of summary judgment for the vicarious trademark infringement claim and upheld the motion to dismiss for unjust enrichment on a different reasoning than the district court. Analysis =Direct trademark infringement= To prevail on a direct trademark infringement under the Lanham Act a plaintiff must prove: # That they own the valid mark # Defendant used the mark in commerce and without the Plaintiff's authorization # Defendant used the mark (or an imitation of it) \\"in connection with the sale, distribution, or advertising\\" of goods or services; and # Defendant's use of the mark is likely to confuse consumers On appeal only the 'likelihood of confusion' prong was in dispute. In the Fourth Circuit, the likelihood of confusion is determined by looking at nine factors: (1) the strength or distinctiveness of the plaintiff's mark as actually used in the marketplace; (2) the similarity of the two marks to consumers; (3) the similarity of the goods or services that the marks identify; (4) the similarity of the facilities used by the markholders; (5) the similarity of advertising used by the markholders; (6) the defendant's intent; (7) actual confusion; (8) the quality of the defendant's product; and (9) the sophistication of the consuming public. The Court first affirmed the district court's limited factor analysis. The district court had only looked at the intent, actual confusion, and sophistication of the consuming public factors. However, the Court faulted the district court's reasoning on all the three factors. The Court pointed to Google's change of the AdWord trademark policy, and Google's expectation of trademark lawsuits as a result of that change, to find that there was a genuine issue of fact as to Google's intent and overruled the district court's grant of summary judgment. As to actual consumer confusion, the Court held that the district court had failed to properly take into account sponsorship confusion. The Lanham Act allows for consumer confusion as to the source of where goods originate, or confusion on whether a good is sponsored by a trademark holder. Therefore, the Court found the district court's viewing of actual consumer confusion evidence to be flawed. Viewing that evidence itself, the Court found that the depositions of actual consumers testifying to confusion and the number of complaints to Rosetta Stone's customer care center, raised a genuine issue of fact as to whether there was actual confusion and overruled the district court's grant of summary judgment. Finally, the Court found the sophistication of the consuming public was too fact determinative to be decided on a motion for summary judgment. =Functionality= The functionality doctrine in trademark law prohibits trademark rights in functional features of a product or its packaging.((e)(5)) Functional is defined as a product feature that is essential to the use or purpose of the article or if that feature affects the cost or quality of the article. The district court had found that even if Rosetta Stone could make a case for consumer confusion, it would grant summary judgment on the direct trademark claim, based on the functionality doctrine. The district court found that the keywords had an essential indexing function by allowing Google to readily identify information in its databases. The district court also found the keywords serve an advertising function for consumers, allowing them to locate particular information, goods, or services, and to compare price. The Court completely rejected application of the functionality doctrine under these circumstances. The Court ruled that the proper place to analyze functionality is in relation to how the trademark relates to the functionality of the actual product not whether it makes Google's computer program function better. =Contributory infringement= Contributory infringement occurs when a manufacturer or distributor intentionally induces another to infringe a trademark, or if it continues to supply its product to one whom it knows or has reason to know is engaging in trademark infringement. Under these situations, the manufacturer or distributor is contributorily responsible for any harm done as a result of the deceit. General knowledge is not enough; the defendant must supply its product or services to \\"identified individuals\\" that it knows or has reason to know are engaging in trademark infringement. The district court relied on Tiffany Inc. v. eBay, Inc., where the Second Circuit rejected a contributory trademark infringement claim against eBay by Tiffany's, to rule against Rosetta Stone's contributory infringement claim. In that case, the Second Circuit had ruled that the receipt of thousands of notices of counterfeit Tiffany jewelry did not amount to \\"knows or has reason to know\\" on the behalf of eBay. The district court found Rosetta Stone's delivery of around 200 notices of sponsored links advertising counterfeit Rosetta Stone software was insufficient to prove that Google knew or had reason to know that the sites were engaging in trademark infringement. The Court reversed, finding that the district court's evaluation of the evidence found Rosetta Stone did not meet its burden for summary judgment. However, the question was whether Google had met its burden for summary judgment and given the evidence to support Rosetta Stone's claim, and that Tiffany Inc. v. eBay, Inc. was decided after a trial and hence of limited application here, the Court overruled the district court's grant of summary judgment. =Unjust enrichment= The district court held that Rosetta Stone had failed to allege an implicit promise to pay, thus granting Google's motion to dismiss. The Court found this a misreading of the unjust enrichment standard, but upheld the motion to dismiss on the ground that Rosetta Stone failed to allege facts showing that it conferred a benefit on Google, for which Google should reasonably be expected to repay. =Trademark dilution= In 1996, Congress enacted The Federal Trademark Dilution Act (Amended in 2006 with the passage of the Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006) that established a federal claim for trademark dilution. To state a prima facie dilution claim the plaintiff must plead that: # She owns a famous mark that is distinctive # The defendant has commenced using a mark in commerce that allegedly is diluting the famous mark # That a similarity between the Defendant's mark and the famous mark gives rise to an association between the marks; and # That the association is likely to impair the distinctiveness of the famous mark or likely to harm the reputation of the famous mark Trademark dilution does not rely on consumer confusion, instead dilution is concerned with the whittling away of the established trademark's selling power and value through its unauthorized use by others. The district court had granted Google's motion for summary judgment as to the dilution claim for two reasons. First, Google's use of Rosetta Stone's mark was not to identify its own goods and services and therefore the Lanham Act's nominative fair use provisions shielded Google from Rosetta Stone's claim. Second, Rosetta Stone's trademark was not diluted because Rosetta Stone had failed to establish that Google's use was likely to impair the distinctiveness of the famous mark or likely to harm the reputation of the famous mark. In ruling against dilution, the district court primarily relied on an increase of Rosetta Stone brand awareness since the introduction of Google's new AdWord trademark policy . With regards to fair use, the Court found that the nominative fair use provisions were a defense, putting the burden on Google not Rosetta Stone to prove. Furthermore, the district court had failed to analyze whether Google had acted in good faith, a requirement for fair use. With regard to the second reason, the Court found that likelihood of dilution is a six factored analysis, in which a court should look at: * The degree of similarity between the mark or trade name and the famous mark * The degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of the famous mark * The extent to which the owner of the famous mark is engaging in substantially exclusive use of the mark * The degree of recognition of the famous mark * Whether the user of the mark or trade name intended to create an association with the famous mark * Any actual association between the mark or trade name and the famous mark The district court only analyzed one factor, the degree of recognition of Rosetta Stone's mark. The Court remanded so that the lower court could address additional factors that may apply. Subsequent Development Before a new trial could commence, Rosetta Stone and Google agreed to settle all claims. On October 31, 2012, the two companies released a joint statement through Reuters stating, \\"Rosetta Stone Inc and Google have agreed to dismiss the three-year- old trademark infringement lawsuit between them and to meaningfully collaborate to combat online ads for counterfeit goods and prevent the misuse and abuse of trademarks on the Internet.\\" The terms of the settlement were not disclosed. Implications Google relies on AdWord as a primary revenue generator for its $60 billion business. Though it is unknown how much of that revenue is trademark related, a negative ruling could have significantly affected Google's revenue. After the Second Circuit's decision in Rescuecom Corp. v. Google Inc. it has become fairly settled that keyword advertising satisfies the 'use in commerce' prong of direct trademark infringement. That decision shifted the question of whether a company had a valid trademark claim against Google's AdWord to whether a trademark owner could prove a likelihood of confusion. The Rosetta Stone v. Google court's finding that there were genuine material issue of fact as to the question of Google's intent, whether there was actual customer confusion, and the consuming public's sophistication, was initially viewed as giving trademark owners an opportunity to prove likelihood of confusion in direct trademark suits against Google and other keyword advertisers. The settlement of the parties, however, took away the chance to prove that theory and essentially resolved the last significant challenge to Google's new trademark policy. Currently, with Google's multiple wins in suits alleging trademark infringement in the United States, along with the recent win by Google in European Court of Justice, commenters are beginning to declare search engines' keyword advertising programs safe from trademark infringement suits.

Male bias  Misogyny can be defined as dislike of, contempt for, or ingrained prejudice against women.‚ÄúMisogyny.‚Äù Merriam-Webster, Merriam-Webster, www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/misogyny. It can be manifested in many ways, including hostility, sex discrimination, social exclusion, and disparity in media coverage. Nineteenth century views of women's involvement in sports gave the impression they were absent altogether. Most of the discussion was centered around middle- and upper-class white women and their health concerns to the exclusion of all other groups.Daniels, Dayna B. You Throw Like a Girl: Sport and Misogyny on the Silver Screen Film & History (2005): n. pag. Web. 2 March 2015. Women's participation in sports during the next century grew across the board but there remains an undertone that women do not belong, including calling into question their sexuality or femininity. The sexism experienced by women in sports also tends to be more overt than sexism in other workplaces and organizational settings. For example, in more recent years, champion tennis player Serena Williams has been verbally attacked for her appearance while wrestler Ronda Rousey has been constantly questioned about her sexuality. Sexist remarks made in many workplaces have been discouraged by displays of social disapproval and the potential threat of organizational reprimand. This has forced misogynistic views to be more subtle in these settings, taking the form of microaggressions or remarks in the form of benevolent sexism. In the sports industry, in comparison, overt sexist remarks are still commonplace and tend to result in less public backlash than similar statements given in other settings. In 1967, Kathrine Switzer was the first woman to run the Boston Marathon. She was physically attacked by race official Jock Semple who tried to remove her from the race, yelling ‚ÄúGet the hell out of my race.\\" More recently, prominent sportswomen Serena Williams and Ronda Rousey, as well as Women's World Cup soccer players, have spoken out about misogyny in sport. Female sportswriters have also become more involved in the discussion, some to their peril. Journalist Julie Dicaro was personally attacked after she reported on rape allegations against Patrick Kane, the Chicago Blackhawks star player. =Demeaning language= A 1993 study, conducted by Michael Messner, found that women were described with words like \\"girls\\" and \\"young women\\", while men were described with words like \\"young man\\" and \\"men\\", but never as \\"boys.\\"Messner, Michael. \\"Reflections on Communication and Sport.\\" Reflections on Communication and Sport. Sage Journals, 30 December 2012. Web. 12 March 2015. Male dominating sport culture is continuously reinforced from a young age. Starting in little leagues and continuing up until the professional leagues, boys and young men are taught how they should behave on the field. Coaches and popular culture constantly deliver messages that emphasize hypermasculinity. They use aggressive language towards their players, telling them to \\"man up\\" or to stop ‚Äúplaying like pussies‚Äù, or telling them that they throw/run/play like a girl. The worst thing to be called or compared to in sports is a woman, and it is the quickest way to cut someone down. In an interview with sports journalist Julie Dicaro, a man said ‚Äúno offense, but sports is where I go to get away from women‚Äù. Demeaning statements like this about women only reinforce that the sports world is no place for a woman.Bryant, Howard. \\"Sports' Male Problem.\\" ESPN. ESPN Internet Ventures, 18 April 2013.

Gender gap =Coverage in media= The popularity of sports across the globe has not eliminated misogyny in sports coverage. Women's sports still suffer from lack of exposure. Sports media is male dominant: 90.1% of editors and 87.4% of reporters are male.Musto, Michela, et al. ‚Äú‚ÄòFrom Fizzle to Sizzle!‚Äô Televised Sports News and the Production of Gender-Bland Sexism.‚Äù Gender & Society, vol. 31, no. 5, 2017, pp. 573‚Äì596., doi:10.1177/0891243217726056. In televised media, approximately 95% of anchors and co-anchors are male. Women's sports have been underrepresented in comparison to men in their respective sports. The NBA pays its players roughly 50% of the league's revenue, this includes media coverage, ticket sales, how profitable the brand is, and the revenue that comes from the sport itself which is split between all the teams. The WNBA pays its players less than 25%, specifically 22.8%, of the league's revenue. This revenue comes from coverage and game attendance. Game attendance has gone up in 2017 reaching its highest-grossing year with an average of 7,716 fans per game. The WNBA is in its 21st season and similarly in the NBA's 21st season (1996-67) had an average of 6,631 fans per game, roughly 1,000 less than the WNBA.Gender & Society. ‚ÄúGender Bland Sexism in Sport.‚Äù Gender & Society, 3 Nov. 2017, gendersociety.wordpress.com/2017/10/05/gender-bland-sexism-in-sport/. Despite having an increase in fans the WNBA is not getting the same coverage as the NBA which adversely affects their salaries.In 2014 ESPN paid the WNBA $17 million for broadcast rights but yet only 2% of airtime on Sports Center, their flagship show, was allocated to women sports with an even smaller percentage being given to the WNBA. The WNBA was forced to broadcast a livestream of 17 games in order to reach fan bases and garner media attention. Roughly 95% of sports content in media is focused on men, despite women making up 40% of all sports participants. The quality of the stories and coverage themselves is also significantly lower than the men, including gag stories involving sexual dialogue or emphasizing the female bodies. Regarding the games themselves, the women have lower quality, editing mistakes, and fewer camera angles with less commentators. A longitudinal study conducted by researchers from Purdue University and University of Southern California of media coverage in sports and the differences found between males and females. Since the start of the 1980s, women's sports have had lower production quality while broadcasting, according to the study's author Toni Bruce.Bruce Toni. 2015. Assessing the sociology of sport: On media and representations of sportswomen. International Review for the Sociology of Sport 50:380-84. This was done by using lower sound quality, lower graphic quality, and fewer camera angles which presents women's sports a less dramatic and less entertaining. As well as low quality broadcasting in almost every story of a male team or male player there is an interview or analysis done by a professional athlete or commentator as compared to 1/3 of the stories on female athletes or teams include interviews. Another study found that, between 1989-2000 sexist language was often used to describe female athletes and teams, sexualizing them and focusing on their families. From about the mid-2000s, language turned \\"gender bland\\", promoting a sexist slant by means of unenthusiastic recitals of performance, lending a lackluster patina to them as compared to men's. The researchers suggest that gender bland sexism elevates men with more entertaining language so that they garner more followers and media attention, taking the spotlight off female sports. The dominant language which plays a major role in media coverage of men's sports is largely absent in female sports coverage. Commentators talk more about statistics which, according to the study, was uninteresting. A lot of stories about women are also what audiences consider gag stories. In one example, SportsCenter ran a 13-second story on a \\"weightlifting granny\\". The researchers suggest that the prevalence of such stories undermines the standing of women sports. = Pay gap = Serena Williams, the highest-paid woman in sports in 2017 The pay gap can be defined as the relative difference in the average gross hourly earnings of women and men within the economy as a whole.‚ÄúPAY GAP  Definition in the Cambridge English Dictionary.‚Äù PAY GAP  Definition in the Cambridge English Dictionary, dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/pay-gap. Of the Forbes 100 most paid athletes only one is a female, which is Serena Williams who lands at number 51. Serena Williams however is the highest paid female athlete according to data based in the year 2017. Within the sport of tennis, according to the New York Times, women make an average of 80 cents for every dollar a man makes. This pay gap matches the current pay gap in the workplace throughout America as well. This difference means that roughly the 15th best male player makes almost $120,500 more than a female with the same ranking.Flake, Collin R, et al. ‚ÄúAdvantage Men: The Sex Pay Gap in Professional Tennis.‚Äù International Review for the Sociology of Sport, vol. 48, no. 3, 2012, pp. 366‚Äì376., doi:10.1177/1012690212442166. In 2018, according to the Guardian, 71% of the world's top men earn more in prize money than females who have their same ranking. Between 2010-2014 the US Women's Open final drew a larger audience than the men. The 2007 Wimbledon Championships was the first tournament that offered equal prize money for male and female athletes. This may be the case during televised events and the grand slams, women are still not receiving as much in middle- and low- tier events; the most popular rationalization being that men play longer. The pay gap does not only happen while they are playing but occurs after when they make appearances on television as a tennis expert. In 2017 BBC had to disclose their pay salaries and it was found that Navratilova was paid roughly $15,000 for her assignment whereas her male counterpart, an equally as good tennis player, received between $150,000-$200,000 for a similar assignment. The pay gap also spans to endorsements in tennis with Maria Sharapova grossing $23 million in endorsements and Roger Federer grossing $65 which is nearly triple.https://opendorse.com/blog/top-10-athlete-endorsement-earners-by- gender/ Males earn more in endorsements while getting paid more than females which shows a bias based on gender within the sport. Tennis remains as the one sport that has the most comparable and fair pay between men and women. Tennis receives the most female media coverage out of any other sport and is growing rapidly in popularity. According to Forbes, eight of the top ten best paid women athletes are tennis players. Soccer in the United States and across the globe has high pay disparity between males and females. Based on data from 2015 from the World Cup provided by the US Soccer Federation, male athletes on the roster made $76,000 whereas women made $15,000.Pilon, Mary. ‚ÄúThe World Cup Pay Gap.‚Äù POLITICO, POLITICO, 12 July 2015, www.politico.eu/article/world-cup- women-pay-gap-gender-equality/. If the men were to win the World Cup they would receive $9.3 million as compared to the women who would win $1.8 million. This means the men earn roughly 5.5 times more than the women do. In 2015 the US women's soccer team won the World Cup and broke the record for largest television audience for a soccer game but earned $2 million less than the US male team that finished 11th. In terms of dollar breakdown this means that a woman earns a $1 for $17.50 dollars a man earns in the World Cup. In the United States both the men and women national team are required to play 20 exhibition matches with other countries across the world. If the men win all 20 games they make $263,000 while the women make $93,000. On average every year the US women's soccer team is paid only 40% of their male counterparts. This pay gap in women and male soccer is not just in the United States but also in Europe. Premier League players, an elite league in the UK, would earn $772 per minute if they were to play every minute of the regular season. The same calculation would leave the women's premier team, the FA's Women Super League, with $16.7 per minute.‚ÄúSport and the Gender Pay-Gap.‚Äù Sports Think Tank, www.sportsthinktank.com/blog/2019/02/sport-and-the-gender-pay-gap. Athletes are not the only ones experiencing the gender pay gap however, it is also sport managers, sport designers, coaches, and operations manager. Based on the PayScale Survey marketing managers earn 82 cents for every dollar a man earns. An event coordinator earns 92 cents for every dollar a man earns and an athletic trainer earns 95 cents for every dollar a man earns. Many studies have been conducted to discover the emergence of the pay gap in sports.‚ÄúIs There a Gender Pay Gap in Sports? - Compensation Research.‚Äù PayScale, 7 Jan. 2019, www.payscale.com/data/gender-pay-gap-sports. Coaches, specifically head coaches at Division 1 programs, suffer a wider pay gap. If we look at the University of Florida, a Division One team, the male head coach gets paid roughly nine times what the female head coach gets paid.Traugutt, Alex; Sellars, Nicole; and Morse, Alan L. (2018) \\"Salary Disparities Between Male and Female Head Coaches: An Investigation of the NCAA Power Five Conferences,\\" The Journal of SPORT: Vol. 6 : Iss. 1 , Article 4. Amanda Butler, the women's head coach, has a win percentage of .603 and gets paid $429,007. Mike White, the male head coach, has a win percentage of .696 and is paid $3,967,385. Despite both of their win averages being very similar the pay disparity between the two is high. Based on a study done by Alex Traugutt and other researchers from the University of Northern Colorado a pay gap is clearly highlighted. Through a sample of 72 head coaches in Division One Basketball teams across the nation, a male coach earns an average of $2,716,191 million whereas a woman coach earns an average of $689,879. The study then focuses on the disparity in pay between in male and female coaches in Division One Women's Basketball. On average a male coaching a D1 women's basketball team earns $821,959 whereas the female earns $631,763, which is about $200,000 less.  FIFA World Cup  2014 World Cup Final between Germany and Argentina US Women's Team celebrating their World Cup win in 2015. The F√©d√©ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) hosts an international soccer tournament every four years for both men and women. The next Women's World Cup is scheduled in 2019 hosted by France. In the Men's World Cup in 2014 in Brazil, the US Men's National Soccer Team made it to the knockout round of the World Cup where they lost to Belgium, 2‚Äì1. After this loss, the USA men were able to collect $8 million for the team. In 2014 alone, $576 million was set aside for Men's World Cup rewards. That year, in the final match, the German men's team triumphed over Argentina, 1‚Äì0, and brought home $35 million. The 2015 Women's World Cup Final was the second most watched soccer game in the history of the United States, trailing the 2014 Men's World Cup Final by less than half a million viewers. The winning team, the US, brought home $2 million as a reward. The 2015 Women's World Cup was also the first (and only) World Cup to be played on artificial turf. Players from all over the world took issue with this because of the increased likelihood of injury. US player Abby Wambach recalled that it was \\"like playing indoor soccer versus outdoor soccer. You don‚Äôt realize it, but the subconscious mind doesn‚Äôt allow you to play as physical.‚Äù Michelle Heyman, forward on the Australian National Team, compared the fields to \\"hot coals\\". During the tournament opener between China and Canada the turf temperature was recorded at 120 degrees. A group of women's players from around the world, including Nadine Angerer of Germany, Veronica Boquete of France, and led by Abby Wambach of the United States, went to court over the issue of turf fields, claiming that the use of turf only in the Women's World Cup was gender discrimination. They dropped the claim after FIFA refused to make a change, saying that it was within the requirements of Canada's bid for hosting the Cup. Coaches from around the world have said that complaining is useless because every team has the same conditions, and American defender Ali Krieger agrees, saying that \\"you have to adapt. This is what was given to us and we're going to do the best we can with it, and adapt and find a way to be successful, no matter what surface we're playing on.\\" The FIFA World cup has been under fire for a long time and misogyny is one of the reasons. FIFA President Sepp Blatter, who announced his resignation in 2015 in the wake of criminal charges, suggested that women should ‚Äúwear sexier uniforms to boost ratings‚Äù.Isidore, Chris. ‚ÄúWomen World Cup Champs Win Waaay Less Money than Men.‚Äù In general, with a few exceptions, women's soccer does not have the same viewership as men's. According to FIFA, they are working hard to bring more attention to this half of the sport, saying that there are \\"untapped opportunities\\" that can be capitalized on. In the United States = Title IX = Title IX Harassment and Assault Awareness Ribbon Girls and women have been discriminated and denied sports opportunities for centuries. Common arguments opposing the participation of women in sports included the argument that \\"menstruation and reproduction were so exhausting that women could not (and should not) participate in physical exercise\\" as well as that participation in sports makes women appear unnaturally masculine. For years,\\"Efforts to limit women's sport activity [which] continued as they became more involved in competitive sports‚Äù prevented many women from expressing their interests in sports, but through time different organizations and feminists have come up with strategies to uplift the participation rates of women and girls in sports. Title IX for example is a legislation that was passed in 1972 to that provided different provisions that protected the rights of equality in sports for women and girls. It is a law that requires all educational programs receiving federal funding to provide equity for both boys and girls. Over the years, the law has been subject to over 20 proposed amendments, reviews, and Supreme Court cases. The law has acted as a way of motivating women and girls to participate more in sports. The participation of girls and women in sports has brought about numerous immediate and long-term benefits that have a lasting impact on both the female gender and the society at large.Guest, Andrew M., and Anne Luijten. \\"Fan culture and motivation in the context of successful women‚Äôs professional team sports: a mixed-methods case study of Portland Thorns fandom.\\" Sport in Society (2017): 1‚Äì18. Some of the different provisions of the ‚ÄòTitle IX‚Äô include equality in the different sports fields for both sexes. Essentially, as described on the U.S. Department of Education's website, this provision ‚Äúprotects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs or activities that receive Federal financial assistance‚Äù. Title IX's goal was to bolster sports programs and opportunities in order to ensure that more people could become active in sports; and ‚Äúcontrary to the myth, Title IX has not starved men‚Äôs athletic programs. Since Title IX was enacted, the number of men's and women's teams has grown and the number of men and women playing sports has risen\\". However, it is important that such provisions do not necessarily imply that equal amounts are spent on sports activities and matters for both sexes and athletic opportunities for boys and men to be reduced but simply means that both women and girls should not be discouraged and denied any sports opportunities. But there are still thousands of schools across the county are not in compliance with Title IX.\\"Title IX.\\" TitleIX.info. Title IX, n.d. Web. 30 March 2015. The law covers all educational activities that receive public funding, so even though sports receive little public funding, they are still subject to Title IX, and are the most well-known application of the law. Opponents of the law say that has led to a break down of men's sports, pointing to the number of schools and institutions that have dropped sports since the enactment of Title IX, such as wrestling and cross-country.Shelton, Donald E. (2001). \\"Equally Bad is Not Good: Allowing Title IX \\"Compliance\\" by the Elimination of Men's Collegiate Sports\\". University of Michigan Journal of Law Reform\\"College Wrestling Scholarships.\\" College Wrestling Scholarships. N.p., n.d. Web. 4 May 2015 Prior to the law, only 295,000 girls participated in high school sports and they received only 2% of the athletic budget. In 2016‚Äì2017, that number had risen to 3.4 million girls playing high school sports across the country.\\"The Next Generation of Title IX.\\" Title IX 40 Years and Counting (2012): n. pag.

Various studies have found that those who participate in high school athletics have higher wages, educational attainment, and educational aspirations later on in life. The rise in opportunities to participate in sports has led to a similar rise in labor force participation, which leads to more women with positive earnings.Betsey Stevenson, 2010. \\"Beyond the Classroom: Using Title IX to Measure the Return to High School Sports,\\" The Review of Economics and Statistics, MIT Press, vol. 92(2), pages 284‚Äì301, 08 Since the enactment of Title IX, women have made strides in college athletics for years. Other factors such as body shaping and fan culture are some of the motivation strategies that concerned individuals in the society are taking up to increase women and girl's participation in sports. However, more enforcement strategies need to be put in place to increase women and girl participation in sports since women discrimination in sports has not been completely eradicated since in some cases, women and girl's participation in sports is not approved.Kissane, Rebecca Joyce, and Sarah Winslow. \\"‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Underestimating Me and You Shouldn‚Äôt‚Äù Women‚Äôs Agency in Fantasy Sports.\\" Gender & Society 30.5 (2016): 819‚Äì841. Additionally, it was thought that the creation of Title IX would translate into having more leadership positions in sports being filled by women but this effect has not been seen. In fact, \\"in the most visible and arguably most important positions in sport‚Äîhead coaches, athletic administrators, and sports editors‚Äîwomen remain so marginalized they‚Äôre essentially statistical tokens‚Äîthat is, they represent less than 15 percent of the workforce population.\\"  Scholarships  Before the Title IX, Equal Opportunity Law was established, not a single sports scholarship was given women in college sports in the United States. Since then, the number of scholarships given to women has increased each year to almost 85,000 scholarships in 2012, based on the ‚ÄúNumber of Available College Athletic Scholarships‚Äù Compared to the 92,000 Scholarships available for men in that year. The Title IX legislation was passed in 1972 and required schools that received federal funding to provide equality for boys and girls. Or having the same number of male sports teams as women. Because of that, many schools or universities have dropped specific sports teams such as wrestling and men's soccer. Before the law, less than 300,000 girls participated in high school sports, receiving 2% of the sports budget. Since then, that number has increased to over 3.4 million girls playing high school sports across the United States. = Women's opportunities and their leadership roles = As of 2013, female athletes received an average of 63,000 fewer opportunities than men at National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) institutions.\\"Women's Sports Foundation.\\" Women's Sports Foundation. Women's Sports Foundation, 18 March 2013. Web. 12 March 2015. Although Title IX encouraged more women to participate in sports at an NCAA level, the number of women in leadership roles has drastically decreased. Women in senior decision making roles has devolved to a number of 18% and women in athletic director positions hold only 17% in the year 2000. Although major strides have been taken by people in all realms of the sports industry to create more opportunities for women, women are still underrepresented in the industry as a whole. According to the NCAA, only 8.3% of Division I athletics directors are women. Only 21% of college women's athletic programs are headed by women, and women fill only 33% of all administrative jobs in women's programs. In high school, less than 20% of athletic directors are women, and less than 40% of directors of physical education are women. An American Society of New Editors (ASNE) newsroom census report in 1991 showed 63.1% of newsroom were men and 36.9% were women. In 2012, the percentages had not changed. By 2013, the statistics are slightly worse, showing 63.7% are men and 36.3% are women. Issues that still remain in terms of gender inequality in sport include the pay gap discrepancies, lack of opportunities for women in a male dominant industry, and lack of media coverage for women athletes. While there are women who enter top management positions in this industry, men typically receive a greater number of opportunities. Hegemony is described as a state of a ‚Äúruling class‚Äù referring to men at the forefront of society. This concept reaffirms the status quo that men demand authority in a society from imposition, manipulation, and even consent from certain groups. Due to this restricting concept, women find it much harder to advance in leadership roles simply due to what has already been set in motion by previous generations and previous cultures. A study conducted by Alice Eagly and Steven Karau, two professors of psychology and management, explores the social role theory and role congruity theory in relation to how women and men assume different career and social roles based on societal expectations. Through the role congruity theory, Eagly and Karau explain similarities between gender roles and leadership roles, which suggest prejudice toward female leaders and potential leaders take two forms. \\"The first form show[s] a less favorable evaluation of women's potential for leadership because leadership ability is more stereotypical of men than women. The second form show[s] a less favorable evaluation of the actual leadership behavior of women than men because such behavior is perceived less desirable in women than men.\\" This research establishes view points and supportive information on why there are fewer women in leadership roles than men throughout the sport industry. The past two decades have granted a lot of changes in women's involvement within the sports industry due to three prominent factors: ‚Äúthe emergence of societal sensitivity to the activities of women, the impact of the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW), and such governmental legislation as Title IX‚Äù. Despite the fact that there is an apparent increase in women participation in intercollegiate athletics, there is a decline in leadership roles and opportunities for women in assistant and associate director positions. In a study conducted by the Sports Management Review twenty assistant and associate athletic directors were interviewed in order to identify factors that may be influential to women's career development sports administration. The results concluded that personal and contextual factors affected career development such as interpersonal relationships with supervisors and professional development activities access helped the individual's career development achievement. Additionally, perceptions of gender and professional value ultimately affected women's career choices and thus their opportunities for advancement within the workplace. Decrease in athletic administrative and coaching positions is even greater for women of color. External barriers encounter by women include: ‚Äúsocietal views, sex role stereotypes, negative attitudes towards female competence, and the prevalence of the ‚Äúmale managerial‚Äù model‚Äù. Additionally, internal barriers that prevent occupational ambitions include: ‚Äúfear of failure, low self-esteem, role conflict, fear of success, and the perceived consequences of occupational advancement and incentive value associated with such expectations‚Äù. However, women of color in sport administration experience all of the above plus ‚Äúracial discrimination, ‚Äúwomanism‚Äù, systemic oppression, biased counseling at the pre-collegiate and collegiate levels, and a lack of minority women as role models and mentors‚Äù. Although all women are facing some degree of inequality within the sports administrative work place, barriers are more severe for black women in the industry. Jeanie Marie Buss is one example of a woman holding a powerful position in the sports industry. According to Forbes in 2011, Jeanie Buss ‚Äúis one of few powerful women in sports management‚Äù. Jeanie is the standing CEO and owner of the Los Angeles Lakers. Her responsibilities include running the entire Lakers organization, in addition to overseeing all business and basketball operation pertaining to the team while working closely with Tim Harris, the President of Business Operations. Adding on to her list of authoritative roles, Buss represents the Lakers on the NBA's Board of Governors. ESPN has gone on to note that Jeanie Buss is ‚Äúone of the most powerful women in the NBA‚Äù. = Sexual harassment in the sports workplace = According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) \\"working women face higher risks than men from job- related stress, and one of the most noxious stressors sexual harassment.\\" The International Olympic Committee Consensus Statement defines sexual harassment as \\"any unwanted and unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, whether verbal, non-verbal or physical.\\" This form of harassment is a common fear among female athletes. Sexual harassment takes place within all different sport groups and may be perpetrated by a number of different people within the sports world. ‚ÄúThe perpetrators of sexual harassment include trainers/coaches, spectators, teammates, sports managers, masseurs, and male peer athletes.‚Äù (The forbidden acts) A study conducted by Sandra L. Kirby and Lorraine Greaves on 1200 female, Canadian national team athletes concluded that the majority of reported acts of sexual harassment involved coaches. However, other figures including ‚Äúmedical doctors or personnel, physiotherapists, strangers, national team committee members, or site managers‚Äù were also involved in reported accounts of sexual harassment, just on a lower scale. The same study also concluded that ‚Äúwhile some athletes related personal accounts of harassment and abuse, many reported the ongoing nature of these activities. They happened in a number of places (on team trips, during training or in private locations like the home or vehicle of a coach or older athlete) rather than restricted to a single and predictable site.‚Äù The ongoing occurrences of sexual harassment may happen over a short or long period of time and almost always happen in private. There are a number of factors that contribute to the existence of sexual harassment of female athletes. Two of the most prominent factors are the lack of awareness of sexual harassment in the sports industry and the lack of knowledge on how to both seek and provide help. A study done in 2011 in Quebec called ‚ÄúDisclosure of Sexual Abuse in Sport Organizations: A Case Study‚Äù points to the many problems in sports organizations. Most instances point to women rarely, if ever, reporting assault or harassment in the sports business. Most coaches, athletes, and administrators were not even aware of existing protocols of sexual harassment. When questioned about this concerning issue, the administrators resorted back to their lawyers; assuming that the issue was far too complicated to tackle. ‚ÄúHarms caused by harassment and abuse still represent a blind spot for many sport organisations, either through fear of reputational damage or through ignorance, silence and collusion.‚Äù Female athletes and sports industry employees need more education on what acts of sexual harassment look like, how to seek help, and who they can trust to speak out to. ‚ÄúAll forms of harassment and abuse breach human rights and may constitute a criminal offence. Therefore, there is a legal and moral duty of care incumbent on those who organise sport, to ensure that risks of non-accidental violence are identified and mitigated.‚Äù Another factor that contributes to the existence of sexual harassment of female athletes is the male-dominated power dynamic between men and women in the world of sports. ‚ÄúSexual harassment and abuse in sport stem from abuses of power relations facilitated by an organisational culture that ignores, denies, fails to prevent or even tacitly accepts such problems.‚Äù Women in powerful positions, such as successful athletes, are often viewed as too assertive, thus receiving harassment for challenging the preconceived notion of a hierarchy. Targets of sexual harassment are more likely to be female because they may have masculine tendencies, and men feel the need to reassure their ‚Äúmasculine dominance‚Äù. In addition, the male-dominated power dynamic also affects non athlete women of the sports world. One occupation that frequently experiences sexual harassment in the sport industry are female sport media print professionals. Female sport media print professionals are typically sports editors, sportswriters, sports columnists, and sports reporters. As reported by the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport at the University of Central Florida in 2012, 90% of sports editors and 88% of sports reporters are men. The disproportion between men and women in this position may discourage female sport media print professionals from reporting such incidents of sexual harassment according to an article published by Christina Coleburn. In reference to the toll that sexual harassment takes on women, Boland states that \\"victims suffer physical, mental, emotional, and financial losses that can be devastating\\". It is for this reason that many female athletes choose to stay silent about their sexual harassment. Discussed in the article Sports Journalism Has A Major Sexual Harassment Problem, women working in the sport industry infrequently report incidents where they have experienced sexual harassment and inappropriate comments throughout their careers due to fear or losing their job. ‚ÄúThe impact of sexual harassment is often measured such as somatic, physical and psychological/emotional health, wellbeing, work variables and career development. Psychological and somatic outcomes include negative effects on self-esteem and life satisfaction, low sense of self-confidence, negative effects on women‚Äôs relationships with other men, anger, fear, anxiety, depression, feelings of humiliation and alienation, a sense of helpless and vulnerability, headache, sleep disturbance, weight loss or gain, gastrointestinal disturbances and nausea.‚Äù In addition, ongoing occurrences of sexual harassment affect victims by manipulating them to believe nothing is wrong and driving them to silence, which may ultimately prolong the sexual harassment. The USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal that occurred over the course of several years, but came to light in the latter months of 2017 and early 2018 involved former doctor Larry Nassar. More than 250 young women accused Nassar of sexual harassment and abuse. Many of these women were seen and treated by Nassar as a gymnast. Because of his role as the USA gymnastics team doctor, Nassar was able to be alone with hundreds of young women and girls over the course of nearly two decades. Aly Raisman, a USA Gymnast, explained how the abuse from Nassar had occurred from such a young age, that despite strange thoughts about his treatment methods, she was taught to trust him which is why it took so long to figure out what was happening to her and many other gymnasts and come forward about it. The formerly discussed study, conducted by Sandra L. Kirby and Lorraine Greaves, states that some women admit becoming ‚Äúdesensitized‚Äù to verbal sexual harassment from coaches. It was not until the coaches were legally charged that the female victims realized the reality of what had happened to them.

This shift occurred because it is no longer cost effective to have a full staff or studio for every signal on the air. Background of corporate consolidation =Deregulation= The 1996 Telecommunications Act removed all national and local restrictions on national ownership that specified the number of stations one company could own in a set market. Before 1996, a company was prohibited from owning more than 40 stations, and from owning more than two AM and two FM stations in one market. The bill covered a wide range of formats and was the first time the Internet was included in broadcasting and spectrum allotment. The federal government has regulated the extent of ownership for radio stations since the 1934 Communications Act. The policy was based on the notion that the airwaves were accessible to the public and therefore had an accompanying public trust. However, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) began to relax these limitations. Lydia Polgreen's research indicates that the 1996 Telecommunications Act was one of the most lobbied bills in history. Media interests spent $34 million on campaign contributions for the 1995‚Äì96 election cycle ‚Äì nearly 40% more than the previous election. Martin Scherzinger claims the public was mostly uninformed of potential consequences, as \\"the media covered the Telecommunications Act as a business technicality instead of a public policy story,\\" assuring deregulation would increase competition and generate high-paying jobs. There was no discernible public debate. Since deregulation in 1996, more than a third of all US radio stations have been bought and sold. Polgreen indicates that in the year following the legislation alone, 2045 radio stations were sold ‚Äì a net value of $13.6 billion. Of the 4992 total stations across 268 set radio markets, almost half are now owned by a company owning three or more stations in the same market. The Future of Music Coalition reported the number of stations owned by the ten largest companies increased by roughly fifteen times between 1985 and 2005. Robert F. X. Sillerman, Chairman of SFX Broadcasting, noted that consolidation also helps spread overhead costs around, and even adding a second station can cut costs. Consolidation doesn't necessarily mean less stations, merely less owners. =Clear Channel= Two companies in particular, Clear Channel and the Infinity Broadcasting unit of Viacom, own roughly half the nation's airwaves. Clear Channel grew from 40 stations to 1,240 stations in seven years (30 times more than congressional regulation previously allowed) . Their aggressive acquisitions have gained them enemies as well as supporters, but their ownership of 247 of the nation's 250 largest radio markets and their domination of the Top 40 format makes them undeniably a significant player in the music industry. After 42 years, the country's largest radio broadcaster switched its name to iHeartRadio Inc. Though most of their revenue still comes from advertising on its airwaves, iHeartRadio only accounts for 10% of total listening for the company. Clear Channel has built the iHeartRadio brand beyond the Internet (see: iHeartRadio Festival, Jingle Ball, Pool Party, iHeartRadio Music Awards). After the company's concert promotion division spun off in 2005, it ditched the Clear Channel name in favor of Live Nation. This follows a general trend of Consolidation of Media Ownership, where corporate interests take precedence over the artistic integrity of the content. An analysis of a wide range of music professionals by Frontline illustrates this is especially true of the music industry. =Recorded music= According to Martin Scherzinger, \\"recorded music is the most concentrated global media market today.\\" When he wrote this in 2005, six leading firms ‚Äì PolyGram, EMI, Warner Music Group (a unit of AOL Time Warner), Sony Music Entertainment, BMG (a unit of Bertelsmann), and Universal Music Group (a unit of Vivendi) ‚Äì were estimated to control between 80% to 90% of the global market. As of July 2013, the industry has consolidated even further. A series of mergers has reduced the big six to just three large corporations: Universal Music Group (now part of EMI's recorded music division), Sony Music Entertainment (EMI Publishing was absorbed into Sony/ATV Music Publishing), and Warner Music Group (which absorbed EMI's Parlophone and EMI/Virgin Classic labels). Most of these companies are part of larger conglomerates. Vertical concentration and horizontal integration allow cross pollination to promote products across multiple mediums. For instance, AOL Time Warner owns magazines, book publishing houses, film studios, television networks, cable channels, retail stores, libraries, sports teams etc., and can thus promote one through the utilization of another. Effects =Programming= Scherzinger states that cross-ownership tends to reduce competition, lower risk, and increase profits. He argues this \\"has forced musical production to succumb to the advertising, marketing, styling, and engineering techniques of increasingly uniform and narrow profit-driven criteria.\\" In the name of efficiency, new technology has allowed a station's technician to cut and paste news, weather and host chatter into pre-recorded programming. Companies have greatly benefited from Top 40, national news, and sports programming shows that can be purchased at the national level. News programming in particular is often produced and recorded at a remote location, as the practice streamlines the number of personalities needed on the air, and emulates a similar feel for the listener. This process of regionalized programming is referred to as voice tracking. Cost-sharing is now common practice. For radio broadcasters, the more homogeneity between different services held in common ownership (or the more elements within a program schedule which can be shared between 'different' stations), the greater the opportunity to gain profits. This increase of cost-efficiency, an application of economies of scale, also results in cutting staff and centralizing programming decisions on what should be broadcast. The music- loving DJ playing whatever they feel fits the mood is largely fictional at any major station at this point in time. Billboard Magazine reported that the mainstream press has accused several large radio conglomerates of playing less new music since the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Consolidation has made it even less likely that one will hear something new, different, or unique. =Musical diversity= The number of formats provided by radio stations increased in all markets between 1996 and 2000. However, an in-depth case study from the Future of Music Coalition shows that a quantitative focus on formats obscures their interconnections. Despite different names, formats extensively overlap and have similar playlists. For example, alternative, Top 40, rock, and hot adult contemporary are all likely to play songs by similar bands, even though their formats are not the same. The Future of Music Coalition reports an analysis of charts in Radio and Records and Billboard's Airplay Monitor revealed considerable playlist overlap ‚Äì as much as 76% ‚Äì between supposedly distinct formats. This overlap may enhance the homogenization of the airwaves. FMC's study concludes that allowing unlimited national consolidation has resulted in less competition, fewer viewpoints, and a decrease in diversity in radio programming ‚Äì a trend in the opposite direction of Congress's stated goals for the FCC's media policy. The report, titled False Premises, False Promises: A Quantitative History of Ownership Consolidation in the Radio Industry, also says that radio consolidation has no added benefits for DJ's, programmers and musicians working in the music industry. Polgreen says that for listeners, the most readily apparent result of consolidation is the rise of cookie-cutter playlists. Teams of market research er strategically compile playlists to be as widely appealing as possible rather than base the song choices on merit. For example, on an oldies show, probably the most heavily researched and systematized format in radio, classic hits will be played almost every day, while critically acclaimed songs by the same bands get little or no play. What one hears has been carefully crafted to appeal to targeted demographic groups for that station. Indeed, format competition and subsequent adaption of similar formats has become a major facet of modern radio. As companies seek to extend their demographic reach, they tend to promote music with \\"general\\" appeal. While the general appeal may seem relatively neutral at first glance, Scherzinger juxtaposes a best-case scenario (tunes that are genuinely popular) with a worst-case scenario (bland content). Music under these conditions is subject to highly restrictive aesthetic codes and cultural judgments of those in positions of authority. He asserts that music with standardized ingredients is played on stations whose ownership is the most consolidated. Scherzinger continues, that \\"far from reflecting a neutral and general taste in music, this stabilized aesthetic tends to mediate the tastes of a highly particular demographic, namely, the social sector with disposable income: predominantly white, middle- class, heterosexual, 18-to-45-year-old males.\\" When economic criteria drive programming decisions, it follows that radio play, media coverage, and sales will be directed toward the most lucrative demographics. Trade publication Variety observed, \\"A huge wave of consolidation has turned music stations into cash cows that focus on narrow playlists aimed at squeezing the most revenue from the richest demographics... Truth be told, in this era of megamergers, there has never been a greater need for a little diversity on the dial.\\" In a recent survey of how much new music is added to Top 40 stations each week, Billboard/Airplay Monitor discovered that smaller groups and individually owned stations add and play more new songs each week. But there are also some prominent exceptions and a wide variance within certain groups. In general, the trend is towards more conservative, less aggressive releases of new material. =National advertising model= Radio tends to get a majority of their revenue from advertising. Polgreen claims that from the 1996 Telecom Act, commercial radio broadcasters sought to form national media companies that could transition radio to a national advertising model. Media companies could then pitch their stations to both local and national advertisers. A company with multiple stations now allows marketing firms to approach the parent company, who can then provide them with the desired target audience through a specific station and time slot. Expanded to a national level, this advertising model generates many more leads for marketers at a fraction of the time and energy that going to individual stations previously required. A study on the impact of ownership rules following the 1996 Telecom Act found that the biggest area of change following the first few years of unrestrained consolidation was the negotiation of advertising rates. Indeed, revenue more than doubled in a decade, from $8.4 billion in 1990 to more than $17 billion by 2000. Scherzinger argues that marketing branches of music companies no longer are purely administrative. Instead, he contends that \\"through intricate applications of management theory ‚Äì supervising and measuring data ‚Äì marketers settle priorities, make aesthetic judgments, and select musical forms.\\" Marketers are increasingly who decide what music gets attention. Radio has always had to balance listeners' desires with the need to deliver a predictable audience to advertisers. In the past, if listeners felt a song was too monotonous or repetitive, they could tune to a different station. Now, however, there is less choice available, and that song might be playing on a nearby station. The radio spectrum is a limited and publicly owned commodity. Since there is a definite amount of space on the radio spectrum, big companies have an incentive to dominate as much of it as they can. =Declining local ownership= Concentration of corporate ownership in the vast majority of local markets, at the expense of local ownership, has increased dramatically. The Local Ownership Index, created by Future of Music Coalition, shows that the localness of radio ownership has declined from an average of 97.1% to an average of 69.9%, a 28% percent drop. Polgreen asserts that the buying frenzy following the Telecom Act drove up station prices beyond the reach of the typical entrepreneur, making it difficult for smaller station owners to resist the financial pressures to sell. As a result, only dedicated local owners have survived. Alternatives Concentration of radio ownership translates to concentration of radio listenership. According to the FMC, the top four firms received 48% of the listeners in 2005. Yet across 155 markets, radio listenership has declined over the past fourteen years that data is available for, a 22% drop since its peak in 1989. It is plausible that the decline in radio listenership is due to consumers finding alternatives more attractive than homogenized radio. =Satellite radio= The two competing satellite radio services, Sirius and XM, merged to form Sirius XM Radio in 2009 and now has a government-regulated monopoly on the format. The merger combined more than 18.5 million subscribers for both companies based on their existing subscribers on the date they merged. =Low-power FM stations= One of these alternative formats, LPFMs (low-power FM stations) is a promising alternative to nationalized radio stations. By broadcasting at well under 100 watts (the minimum for commercial stations is set at 100 watts), these independently run stations have been viewed as a possible antidote to radio consolidation, as they are local stations dealing with local issues. The Federal Communications Commission seems to be sympathetic to single station owners, and its former chairman, William Kennard, has taken steps to encourage further diversity in ownership by proposing the creation of three new classes of licenses for LPFMs. =Other media= Other less homogenized formats can be found through individual libraries, as well as internet radio formats like podcasts. Other streaming services like Pandora and Spotify are becoming increasingly popular. However, a 2014 Nielsen report indicates that radio still remains the most popular platform for music consumption, as 59% of listeners use a combination of AM/FM or online radio streams to hear their favorite artists. Paradigm shift Artists that experienced success in the industry prior to the 1996 Telecommunications Act, such as David Crosby of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and Don Henley of The Eagles, have brought to light what they believe are contributing to the nationwide homogenization of music. Crosby tells PBS in an interview, \\"When it all started, record companies ‚Äì and there were many of them, and this was a good thing ‚Äì were run by people who loved records, people like Ahmet Ertegun, who ran Atlantic Records, who were record collectors. They got in it because they loved music.... Now record companies are run by lawyers and accountants.\\" This view highlights a common theme that creativity and passion have been subverted by the financial incentives of corporatized media companies. Chief executives of large record labels often have no musical or cultural background. A head of Universal Vivendi, Jean Ren√© Fourtou, was previously in pharmaceuticals. Gunter Thielen, the former head of Bertelsmann, previously managed the company's printing and industrial operations. Music journalist Ernesto Aguilar expressed the sentiment that \\"media consolidation means not only does corporate radio control who gets played, but also which artists get recognition, who is perceived as a voice in a music's history and who is erased from that history.\\" See also *Audience measurement *Concentration of media ownership *Future of Music Coalition *National Public Radio *Prometheus Radio Project *iHeartMedia References Category:Concentration of media ownership Category:Radio broadcasting ","title":"Radio homogenization"},{"id":"45241540","text":"Lysychnyky () is a village (selo) in the Zalischyky Raion of the Ternopil Oblast, of Western Ukraine.

This was also the first war in which the government systematically produced propaganda as a way to target the public and alter their opinion. According to Eberhard Demm and Christopher H. Sterling: :Propaganda could be used to arouse hatred of the foe, warn of the consequences of defeat, and idealize one's own war aims in order to mobilize a nation, maintain its morale, and make it fight to the end. It could explain setbacks by blaming scapegoats such as war profiteers, hoarders, defeatists, dissenters, pacifists, left-wing socialists, spies, shirkers, strikers, and sometimes enemy aliens so that the public would not question the war itself or the existing social and political system.Eberhard Demm and Christopher H. Sterling, \\"Propaganda\\" in Spencer C. Tucker and Priscilla Roberts, eds. The Encyclopedia of World War I : A Political, Social, and Military History (ABC- CLIO 2005) 3:941. British propaganda stamp Propaganda worked on a variety of ideological underpinnings such as atrocity propaganda, propaganda dedicated to nationalism and patriotism, and propaganda focused on women. Media and censorship The media was expected to take sides, not to remain neutral, in World War I. When Wilhelm II declared a state of war in Germany on July 31, the commanders of the army corps () took control of the administration, including implementing a policy of press censorship, which was carried out under Walter Nicolai. Censorship regulations were put in place in Berlin, with the War Press Office fully controlled by the Army High Command. Journalists were allowed to report from the front only if they were experienced officers who had \\"recognized patriotic views\\". Briefings to the press created a high degree of uniformity in wartime reporting. Contact between journalists and fighting troops was prohibited, and journalists spoke only to high-ranking officers and commanders. Both sides initially prohibited any photography or filming. The primary visual representation relied on war painting though the Germans used some filmed newsreels that were heavily censored. The French preferred painting over photography, but some parties used photographs to document the aftermath of damage that had been inflicted on cities by artillery. However, photographs of battle scenes were reenactments by necessity. When World War I started, the United States had become a leader in the art of filmmaking and the new profession of commercial advertising. Such newly-discovered technologies played an instrumental role in the shaping of the American mind and the altering of public opinion into supporting the war. Every country used careful edited newsreels to combine straight news reports and propaganda.Laurent V√©ray, \\"1914‚Äì1918, the first media war of the twentieth century: The example of French newsreels.\\" Film History: An International Journal 22.4 (2010): 408-425 online.

British Propaganda American propaganda The most influential man behind the propaganda in the United States was President Woodrow Wilson. In his famous January 1918 declaration, he outlined the \\"Fourteen Points,\\" which he said that the United States would fight to defend. Aside from the restoration of freedom in Europe in countries that were suppressed by the power of Germany, Wilson's Fourteen Points called for transparency regarding discussion of diplomatic matters, the free navigation of the seas in peace and in war, and equal trade conditions among all nations. The Fourteen Points became very popular across Europe, and motivated German Socialists especially.John L. Snell, \\"Wilson's Peace Program and German Socialism, January-March 1918.\\" Mississippi Valley Historical Review 38.2 (1951): 187-214 online. It served as a blueprint for world peace to be used for peace negotiations after the war. Wilson's points inspired audiences around the world and greatly strengthened the belief that Britain, France, and America were fighting for noble goals. =Committee on Public Information= In 1917 Wilson created the Committee on Public Information]. It reported directly to President Wilson and was essentially a massive generator of propaganda. The Committee on Public Information was responsible for producing films, commissioning posters, publishing numerous books and pamphlets, purchasing advertisements in major newspapers, and recruiting businessmen, preachers and professors to serve as public speakers in charge of altering public opinion at the communal level. The committee, headed by former investigative journalist George Creel, emphasized the message that America's involvement in the war was entirely necessary for achieving the salvation of Europe from the German and enemy forces. In his book titled How we Advertised America, Creel states that the committee was called into existence to make World War I a fight that would be a \\"verdict for mankind.\\" He called the committee a voice that was created to plead the justice of America's cause before the jury of public opinion. Creel also refers to the committee as a \\"vast enterprise in salesmanship\\" and \\"the world's greatest adventure in advertising.\\" The committee's message resonated deep within every American community and served as an organization that was responsible for carrying the full message of American ideals to every corner of the civilized globe. Creel and his committee used every possible mode to get their message across, including printed word, spoken word, the motion picture, the telegraph, the poster, and the signboard. All forms of communication were put to use to justify the causes that compelled America to take arms. Creel set out systematically to reach every person in the United States multiple times with patriotic information about how the individual could contribute to the war effort.Stephen Vaughn, Holding Fast the Inner Lines: Democracy, Nationalism, and the Committee on Public Information (1980). online The CPI also worked with the post office to censor seditious counterpropaganda. Creel set up divisions in his new agency to produce and to distribute innumerable copies of pamphlets, newspaper releases, magazine advertisements, films, school campaigns, and the speeches of the Four Minute Men. The CPI created colourful posters that appeared in every store window to catch the attention of passers- by for a few seconds.Katherine H. Adams, Progressive Politics and the Training of America‚Äôs Persuaders (1999) Cinemas were widely attended, and the CPI trained thousands of volunteer speakers to make patriotic appeals during four- minute breaks, which were needed to change reels. They also spoke at churches, lodges, fraternal organizations, labour unions, and even logging camps. Creel boasted that in 18 months, his 75,000 volunteers had delivered over 7.5 million four-minute orations to over 300 million listeners in a nation of 103 million people. The speakers attended training sessions through local universities and were given pamphlets and speaking tips on a wide variety of topics, such as buying Liberty bonds, registering for the draft, rationing food, recruiting unskilled workers for munitions jobs, and supporting Red Cross programs.Lisa Mastrangelo, \\"World War I, public intellectuals, and the Four Minute Men: Convergent ideals of public speaking and civic participation.\\" Rhetoric & Public Affairs 12#4 (2009): 607-633. Historians were assigned to write pamphlets and in-depth histories of the causes of the European war.George T.

Thus, propaganda become a weapon which influence countries. Self-justification and assigning blame UK National Archives As their armies began to clash, the opposing governments engaged in a media battle attempting to avoid blame for causing the war, and casting blame on other countries, through the publication of carefully selected documents, basically consisting of diplomatic exchanges. The Germans were first, and other major participants followed within days. = Color books = A color book is a collection of diplomatic correspondence and other official documents published by a government for educational or political reasons, and to promote the government position on current or past events. In wartime or times of crisis, they have especially been used as a propaganda vehicle, to justify governmental action, or to assign blame to foreign actors. The choice of what documents to include, how to present themm, and even what order to list them, can make them tantamount to government-issued propaganda. In the early 17th century, blue books first came into use in England as a means of publishing diplomatic correspondence and reports. They were so named, because of their blue cover. During the time of the Napoleonic Wars in the early 19th century, they were being published regularly. By the second half of the century, Turkey began publishing its own version in red, and the concept of color books spread to other countries in Europe, with each country using one color: Germany using white; France: yellow; red: Austria-Hungary (Spain also used red later, as did the Soviet Union); green: Italy; gray: Belgium; orange: Netherlands (and Tsarist Russia). This concept spread to the Americas as well, with the United States using red, Mexico: orange, and various countries in Central and South America using other colors; it even spread as far as China (yellow) and Japan (gray). Poster, c. 1918 by Maurice Neumont The German White Book appeared on 4 August 1914, and was the first such book to come out. It contains 36 documents. Within a week, most other combatant countries had published their own book, each named with a different color name. France held off until 1 December 1914, when they finally published their Yellow Book. Other combatants in the war published similar books: the Blue Book of Britain, the Orange Book of Russia, the Yellow Book of France, and the Austro-Hungarian Red Book, the Belgian Grey Book, and the Serbian Blue Book. The French Yellow Book (), completed after three months of work, contained 164 documents. These works of propaganda aimed to convince public opinion of the validity of their rights. Unlike the others which were limited to the weeks before the start of the war, the Yellow Book included some documents from 1913, putting Germany in a bad light by shedding light on their mobilization for a European war. Some of the documents in the Yellow Book were challenged by Germany as not genuine, but their objections were mostly ignored, and the Yellow Book was widely cited as a resource in the July crisis of 1914. It turned out after the war was over, that the Yellow Book wasn't complete, or entirely accurate. Historians who gained access to previously unpublished French material were able to use it in their report to the Senate entitled \\"Origins and responsibilities for the Great War\\" as did ex-President Raymond Poincar√©. The conclusion set forth in the report of the 1919 French Peace Commission is illustrative of the two-pronged goals of blaming their opponents while justifying their own actions, as laid out in two sentences: Later, publication of complete archives from the period of the July crisis by Germany, Britain, and Austria, as well as some from Soviet archives, revealed some truths that the Yellow Book conveniently left out. In particular, was Yellow Book document #118, which showed a Russian mobilization in response to Austrian mobilization the day before on 30 July, but in fact, the order of mobilization was reversed; Russian mobilized first. After a contorted explanation by Quai d'Orsay, confidence in the Yellow Book was ruined, and historians avoided using it. In her essay for the April 1937 issue of Foreign Affairs, Bernadotte E. Schmitt examined recently published diplomatic correspondence in the and compared it to the documents in the French Yellow Book published in 1914, concluding that the Yellow Book \\"was neither complete nor entirely reliable\\" and went into some detail in examining documents either missing from the Yellow Book, or presented out of order to confuse or mislead the sequence in which events occurred. He concluded, In the German White Book, anything that could benefit the Russian position was redacted. = Internecine recriminations = German propagandists called the Yellow Book a vast \\"collection of falsifications\\". France was accused of having given its unconditional support to Russia. Germany tried to show that it was forced into general mobilization by that of Russia, which in turn, blamed Austria-Hungary. The Allied documents on the circumstances of the declaration of war, as well as the war crimes committed by the German army, constituted the basis on which the Allies would rely in 1919 to formulate Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles assigning the exclusive responsibility for the outbreak of the war to Germany and Austria-Hungary. A report to parliament by German jurist Hermann Kantorowicz after the war investigating the causes of World War I found that Germany had a large share of responsibility in triggering World War I, and cited the White Book as one example, in which about 75 percent of the documents presented in it were falsified. Atrocity propaganda Anti-German atrocity propaganda Atrocity propaganda exploiting sensational stories of rape, mutilation, and wanton murder of prisoners by the Germans filled the Allied press.Nicoletta F. Gullace, \\"Sexual violence and family honor: British propaganda and international law during the First World War,\\" American Historical Review (1997) 102#3 714‚Äì747. The Germans and Austro-Hungarian soldiers were depicted as inhumane savages, and their barbarity was emphasized as a way to provide justification for the war. In 1914, prominent forensic scientist, R.A. Reiss was commissioned by the Serbian prime minister to conduct an investigation on war crimes. It was done as a way to depict the multiple acts of violence that had been committed against civilians by the occupying Austro-Hungarian forces in Serbia in 1914. The reports were written in vivid detail and described individual acts of violence against civilians, soldiers, and prisoners of war. Some of the actions included the use of forbidden weapons, the demolition of ancient libraries and cathedrals, and the rape and torture of civilians. Graphic illustrations, accompanied by first- hand testimonies that described the crimes as savagely unjust, were compelling reminders to justify the war. Other forms of atrocity propaganda depicted the alternative to war to involve German occupation and domination, which was regarded as unacceptable across the political spectrum. As the Socialist Pioneer of Northampton put it in 1916, there could \\"be no peace while the frightful menace of world domination by force of German armed might looms about and above us\\". Propaganda was used in the war, like any other war, with the truth suffering. Propaganda ensured that the people learned only what their governments wanted them to know. The lengths to which governments would go to, to try to blacken the enemy's name, reached a new level during the war. To ensure that everybody thought as the government wanted, all forms of information were controlled. Newspapers were expected to print what governments wanted readers to read. That would appear to be a form of censorship, but the newspapers of Britain, which were effectively controlled by the media barons of the time, were happy to follow and printed headlines that were designed to stir up emotions, regardless of whether they were accurate or not. The most infamous headlines included \\"Belgium child's hands cut off by Germans\\" and \\"Germans crucify Canadian officer\\". Use of patriotism and nationalism Patriotism and nationalism were two of the most important themes of propaganda. In 1914, the British army was made up of not only professional soldiers but also volunteers and so the government relied heavily on propaganda as a tool to justify the war to the public eye. It was used to promote recruitment into the armed forces and to convince civilians that if they joined, their sacrifices would be rewarded. One of the most impressionable images of the war was the \\"Your Country Needs You\\" poster, a distinctive recruitment poster of Lord Kitchener (similar to the later Uncle Sam poster) pointing at his British audience to convince it to join the war effort. Another message that was deeply embedded in national sentiment the religious symbolism of St George, who was shown slaying a dragon, which represented the German forces. Images of enthusiastic patriotism seemed to encapsulate the tragedy of the European and imperial populations. Such images were able to conjure up feelings of required patriotism and activism among those who were influenced. The German Kaiser often appeared in Allied propaganda. His pre-1898 image of a gallant Victorian gentleman was long gone, replaced by a dangerous troublemaker in the pre-1914 era. During the war he became the personified image of German aggression; by 1919 the British press was demanding his execution. He died in exile in 1941, by which time his former enemies had moderated their criticism and instead turned the hatred against Hitler.Lothar Reinermann, \\"Fleet Street and the Kaiser: British public opinion and Wilhelm II.\\" German History 26.4 (2008): 469-485. Use as weapon Patriotic, pictorial map of the British Isles (c. 1914) The major foreign ministries prepared propaganda designed to reach public opinion and elite opinion in other countries, especially the neutral powers. For example the British were especially effective in turning American opinion against Germany before 1917.M. L. Sanders, \\"Wellington House and British propaganda during the First World War\\", The Historical Journal (1975) 18#1: 119‚Äì146.Cedric C. Cummins, Indiana Public Opinion and the World War 1914-1917 (1945) pp 22‚Äì24. Propaganda thus became an integral part of the diplomatic history of World War I and was designed to build support for the cause or to undermine support for the enemy. Eberhard Demm and Christopher H. Sterling, state: :Propaganda could also win over neutral states by encouraging friendly elements and local warmongers, or, at a minimum, keep neutrals out of the war by fostering non-intervention or pacifist views....It could help retain allies, break up enemy alliances, and prepare exhausted or dissatisfied nations to defect or make a separate piece.Demm and Sterling in The Encyclopedia of World War I (2005) 3:941. Nonmilitary propaganda into neutral countries war was designed to build support for the cause or to undermine support for the enemy.Edward Corse, A battle for neutral Europe: British cultural propaganda during the Second World War (London: A&C; Black, 2012). Wartime diplomacy focused on five issues: propaganda campaigns to shape news reports and commentary; defining and redefining the war goals, which became harsher as the war went on; luring neutral nations (Italy, Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, and Romania) into the coalition by offering slices of enemy territory; and encouragement by the Allies of nationalistic minority movements within the Central Powers, especially among Czechs, Poles, and Arabs. In addition, multiple peace proposals came from neutrals and from both sides although none of them progressed very far. Some were neutral efforts to end the horrors. Others were propaganda ploys to show one side as being reasonable and the other as obstinate.See Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Official Statements of War Aims and Peace Proposals: December 1916 to November 1918, edited by James Brown Scott. (1921) 515 pp.online free As soon as the war began, Britain cut Germany's undersea communication cables as a way to ensure that the Allies had a monopoly on the most expedient means of transmitting news from Europe to press outlets in the United States. That as a way to influence reporting of the war around the world and to gain sympathy and support from the other nations. In 1914, a secret British organization, by the name of Wellington House, was set up and called for journalists and newspaper editors to write articles that sympathized with Britain as a way to counter statements that were made by the enemy. Wellington House implemented the action not only through favourable reports in the press of neutral countries but also by publishing its own newspapers, which were circulated around the globe. Wellington House was so secret that much of Parliament was in the dark. Wellington House had a staff of 54 people, which made it the largest British foreign propaganda organization. From the Wellington House came to the publication The War Pictorial, which, by December 1916, reached a circulation of 500,000, covering 11 languages. The War Pictorial was deemed to have such a powerful effect on different masses that it could turn countries like China against Germany. Women British propaganda poster that depicts women as bravely seeing their men off to war. Propaganda and its ideological impacts on women and family life in the era differed by country. British propaganda often promoted the idea that women and their families were threatened by the enemy, particularly the German army. British propaganda played on the fears of the country's citizens by depicting the German army as a ravenous force that horrified the towns and cities it passed through, raped women, and tore families apart. The terror ensued by the gendered propaganda influenced Britain's war policies, and violence against the domestic sphere in wartime became seen as an inexcusable war crime. In the Ottoman Empire, the United States, and in other countries, women were encouraged to enter the workforce since the number of men kept shrinking during the war. The Ottoman government already had a system that incorporated the participation of women in governmental committees that had established in 1912 and 1913. Thus, when the war began, the government was able to spread patriotic propaganda to women all over the empire through the women's committees. Propaganda encouraged women to enter the workforce, both to support the Empire and to become self- sufficient by state-sanctioned work that was specified for women. American war propaganda often featured images of women but typically reflected traditional gender norms. While there was increasingly a call to employ women to replace the men who were at war, American propaganda also emphasized sexual morality. Women's clubs often produced attitudes against gambling and prostitution.

It is said that advertisers often utilize already existing deep-seated ideologies in society and base their commercials on them. Stereotypes have been used in advertisement as long as they have been around, and different ads over time have been thought by some to be more racist than others. Racial stereotypes are used frequently in advertising. They are mental ideologies that the viewer assigns meaning to based on their membership in a social category in order to process information \\"as such, stereotyping does not by definition carry negative or positive values\\". Because of this, we see many different outcomes; racial stereotyping can be positive for the advertiser as well as the viewer in instances where specific demographics are being targeted. However, it can also be perceived negatively in instances where the stereotyping begins causing offence. \\"Marketers should be aware of the potential to cause serious or widespread offence when referring to different races, cultures, nationalities or ethnic groups\\". Defining racism in advertising There is not an agreed-upon way to define racism and its use in advertisement because there is no standard idea of what racism is. The use of racial tropes is a common way to target specific demographics, and this is not inherently negative, though racism is. This causes a great deal of debate when discussing whether it is ethical to use stereotypes in advertisement. Some people regard the use of archetypes to point to specific groups of people as racist, because it is a generalization. It could be offensive to some members of a group when their media representations are disproportionately distributed across a narrow type of appearance, and advertising is arguably the most prevalent medium available. However, some may think that as long as the depictions do not cause harm, and they are successful in targeting a specific demographic, then they are not racist and are fair game for advertising. Stereotypes are defined as the inferred belief that roles, attributes and positions in society are assigned to different groups of people based on race, religion, sexual orientation or gender. Stereotyping in advertising can be used in ways that are useful in providing orientation with which an audience can relate to, but often are oversimplified representations of any group in society which can contribute to misleading information. Reasons for stereotyping in advertising have long been discussed, and often boil down to the \\"mirror\\" vs the \\"mold\\" argument coined by Pollay in 1986. On the one hand, it can be argued that advertising mirrors society, and is not presenting any stereotypes not already held. Advertising merely reflects our lifestyles, and uses repetition and insistence that this is what life already is to drive consumer engagement and purchase. Conversely, the \\"mold\\" argument insists that advertising influences society, and thus encourages stereotypes that are shaped by media. Sales are driven by society attempting to conform to the stereotypes and ideas communicated in advertising, as it shapes their own values and beliefs. Essentially, stereotyping in advertising is the use of caricatures, be they based on truth or perception, to portray an idea in a short amount of time. With these quick-fire caricatures, there is no need for a thirty-second commercial to include a back story to the featured idea, as audiences fill in the gaps based on preconceived notions of what that person or situation represents. This facilitates a relationship between audiences and the advertisement in which audiences can understand a simplified situation with little to no information, and thus make purchasing decisions, however can be damaging towards the affected groups.  Positive effects: targeting specific demographics  Racial stereotyping creates positive results in situations where the advertisement is being targeted to a specific demographic, (for example, a specific race). Audiences automatically install a perceptual bias toward people or characters similar to themselves. This is called an in-group. An in-group consists of people that individuals socially identify themselves with, such as similarities in age, race, gender, religion and so on. Studies have shown that \\"the enhancement of in-group bias is more related to increased favoritism toward in-group members than to increased hostility toward out-group members\\". Advertisers use this knowledge when targeting a product or service to a particular market and might use demographics to aid their information. For example, different countries and cultures inhibit different languages, different interpretation of symbols and cultural barriers that can limit the effectiveness of advertisements. This is where advertisers take into consideration the in-group bias theory. Viewers are more likely to cast favouritism toward people that they can socially identify with. Therefore, if an advertiser is advertising in Japan, they would use Japanese models, characters and language so that the viewers could identify with the advertisement. Whereas if they were advertising in Italy, these features would not reach the target audience effectively unless they altered the advertisement to align with the specific demographics of the Italian audience. Edward T. Hall explains to us that context is an element in communication that must never be overlooked. Context is what gives meaning to words, if they are not in the correct context they are meaningless. Targeting specific demographics is a form of racial stereotyping; however, it is seen to create positive results for both the advertiser and the viewer. The advertiser reaches the targeted audience effectively while the audience views advertisements that applies to them and that they can relate with. Many questions are constantly arising regarding the ethical use of racial stereotyping in advertising. This form of racial stereotyping, where a specific demographic is being targeted for a product or service particular to them, is seen as commonplace for advertising stereotypes. This technique is deemed ethical so long no offence has occurred.  Negative effects: causing offence  Negative effects of racial stereotyping come into play when we start to see people taking offence. It is very common for advertisements to be misinterpreted due to the increased number of factors contributing to noise along the communication process. Srividya Ramasubramanian talks about the way that stereotypes turn from being harmless into something that can be deeply offensive. She states that there are two stages of the stereotyping process \\"stereotype activation that is more automatic, and stereotype application that is more deliberate. In other words, stereotypical thoughts about out-groups are readily activated at the implicit level even though they are not applied consciously at the explicit level.\\" It is when we see these stereotypical thoughts activated explicitly through the use of advertisements that offence takes place. It is the conscious thought that is being communicated that offends people. As discussed earlier, people naturally identify themselves socially, they assign qualities to themselves that they can also associate with other people. This is also known as an in-group. When people have close ties to a specific group, it is common to see group members take offence to something impacting another member. \\"Stereotyping a group has significant impact on the way the individuals within the group self-identify\\". So when advertisers use racial stereotypes in a negative form, generally we see two different outcomes, one; being that a person takes offence and hostility toward the advertiser arises, and two; people question themselves and the groups they belong to and can lead to a form of self oppression. \\"Social stereotypes that surround us, further shape our self-identity and consequently, the decisions we make\\". Both of which outcomes cause damage to both the advertiser and the viewer and can be seen as unethical advertising.  Beauty whitewash  Beauty whitewash is a term that is used in the advertising industry that refers to the harmful ideal that beauty can be defined by skin and hair colour. The term applies particularly to photographs where the skin and hair colour of the model is manipulated to be lighter. In a TEDx talk, Jean Kilbourne stated that \\"women of colour who are considered beautiful only in so far as they resemble the white ideal, light skin, straight hair, Caucasian features, round eyes.\\" Whitewashing is a technique used by advertisers usually in an attempt to target a specific demographic, as discussed earlier. However, advertisers sometimes attempt to change who a person is rather than use a different person or model. For example, in 2008, L'Oreal Paris was accused of whitewashing the singer Beyonc√©'s skin and hair colour for their advertising campaign. Her skin and hair colour became significantly lighter. This advertising campaign received tremendous amounts backlash due to the racial offence caused. Kilbourne stated that the image advertisers create \\"isn't real, it's artificial, it's constructed, it's impossible\\". The black community felt offense as they believed that a mockery was made of the black race. This advertisement was seen to send conflicting messages to the young fan base that Beyonc√© maintains. Though this issue generally involves lightening a person's skin colour, the opposite can also occur. For example, in 2001, Nike digitally manipulated the skin colour of Jason Williams, a basketball player, from white to black for an advertising campaign. This received backlash for racially abusing Asian fans and Nike was fined. A similar incident occurred with Ford Motor, where they darkened the face of a stunt driver in a TV advertisement. Ford was later forced to remove all new commercials featuring the modification. Ford stated that the alteration was made to make the driver less noticeable; however, they still received allegations of racism. These ‚Äì along with many other similar cases of celebrity whitewashing ‚Äì are examples of racial stereotyping being used negatively in advertising. According to Frith and Mueller, \\"Ads are not just messages about goods and services, but, ... ads are social and cultural texts about ourselves and others\\". These advertisements use racial stereotypes in a context that has the capability of creating long term negative effects. These can include hate-crimes, self-discrimination and the creation of moral panic in society. Why use stereotyping Other scholars believe advertisers should do what works in order to invoke identification with the product and that simply because sold commodities are connected to certain cultures and people, there is no harm in emphasizing these connections. There is often very little time in TV commercials to get a point across, so advertisers set up a back- story by the use of caricatures ‚Äì as Stuart Hall has argued, the reading of a particular image depends not only on the messages contained in it, but in the messages surrounding it and the situational, societal, and historical context. There has been discussion about the issues with using archetypal representations of minorities in advertising in unrealistic and distorted ways. For example, Sut Jhally argues that the representation of African Americans in the media is hypersexualized. According to Stuart Hall, representation is largely how people form their identities, which becomes problematic when the representations are not empowering. It has also been said that stereotypes cannot benefit the people they reference, because even if the stereotype is perceived as positive, normalizing one stereotype may reinforce other, less positive stereotypes. For example, people who hear a stereotype about African Americans being good at athletics actually have stronger negative perspectives on black people than did those who heard negative stereotypes. This may be because while many people will identify and dismiss a harmful-sounding stereotype, they may accept a positive one without noticing it, and this may subsequently reinforce their acceptance of other stereotypes. Examples of racial stereotyping and affected groups Negative advertising stereotypes can take on many forms, such as portraying people of colour in animal skin clothing in wilderness settings, recurring images of white male- Asian female couples, and Caucasian middle-aged women in domestic scenes as caretakers or housewives. The spread of cultures, ethnicities and genders that advertisers are attempting to target gives rise to the spread of groups affected by stereotyping in advertising, as shown by the following examples. Asian Americans are often represented as affluent, well-educated individuals with a high work ethic, and tend to feature more often in advertising that promotes technology and business than African American or Latino models. Asian Americans were shown in the workplace in 50% of the print ads that they featured in, whilst African Americans and Latinos were more diversely featured in a variety of activities such as outdoor and sporting pursuits or at leisure. Ads that feature Asian American men often perpetuate a stereotype of success and sacrifice to achieve financial rewards, such Paek and Shah's (2003) example of a print ad, in which an Asian man talking to his wife tells her he will have to work late tonight. The ad suggests that the man is already at work and ready to make his company's goals a reality, whilst being prepared for his personal life to come as a secondary commitment. Many may argue that the stereotype of hard work and affluence may be a positive one and does not appear to be problematic. To be wealthy and successful is surely a benefit in American society, however passive viewing of television and print advertising goes a long way towards shaping viewers' perceptions of minorities, and this representation of Asian Americans in the media can be damaging in so far as presenting an inaccurate picture of Asia as a whole, and an incorrect defining point for each individual within that culture. African Americans are another example of a minority stereotypically featured in advertising, where it is common to see African American males featured in advertisements promoting hip hop music. They are often seen as a large representation of the hip hop culture, despite the fact that 80% of consumers of hip hop culture are not African American. African American males are also often featured displaying physical and sporting prowess, such as a young man playing basketball in a Kellogg's commercial, or the variety of athletes in EA Sport's advertisements for basketball and soccer video games. Bristor et al. (1995) suggest that this limited view of African Americans in non occupational and often leisurely roles may be damaging in that it suggests to youth that they have little else to work towards except for a future in hip-hop or sports. They conclude that African Americans should be shown in a wider variety of roles to truly reflect society's shifting perceptions, with a greater percentage needing to be shown in management or leadership positions. It has often observed that Latinos are a drastically underrepresented minority in the media, being featured with speaking roles in only 1% of television ads and in only 4.7% of television ads overall. In a study done by Mastro and Stern (2003) examining frequencies of different races in commercials, Latinos were shown to advertise soap or hygiene products in 43% of ads they are featured in, closely followed by other non-occupational roles advertising clothing or footwear. Ads also frequently show Latino populations more scantily clad than their Caucasian co-models and involved in sexualised behaviour; Mastro and Stern suggest this may teach to younger populations to identify those aspects as the most important defining factors of self. Paek and Shah also found Latinos to be underrepresented (2003), and the occupations the Latino models are shown to hold are most often employment positions, closely followed by blue collar labour roles. Since underrepresentation can lead to society holding false notions about the position minorities hold in society, and can skew how the minorities perceive themselves, Bang and Taylor argue that stereotypes such as lack of education or motivation can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy. Members of the community assume themselves to occupy a certain position in society and thus work towards that position, which would be detrimental to any culture or community if they believed themselves to be uneducated or unworthy or higher employment positions, via Pollay's aforementioned \\"mold\\" effect.  Reducing racial stereotypes  The world is becoming increasingly diverse; we no longer live in a world where we can easily define a target market by their demographics. The advertising world is in need of a reboot in order to understand that racial stereotyping is hurting business more than it is helping business. \\"By 2010, black consumers will spend some $920 billion annually, Latinos nearly $1 trillion and Asians some $525 billion.\\" Roksana Alavi states: \\"We should be color-blind. Most of us are not, physically or rhetorically\\". When racial stereotyping in advertising causes offence, this type of advertising is not ethical. The advertising world is beginning to see more research into racial stereotyping come to light along with the appearance of opinion blogs and columns that include criticism toward the issue. \\"We have a choice to learn more and have a clearer understanding about a certain ethnic group instead of believing everything that the media report states them to be.\\" Srividya Ramasubramanian discusses two ways in which we can approach the issue and hopefully reduce the use of racial stereotypes or at least bring awareness to it. She discusses that we can use an audience-centred approach in which the audience is instructed to be critical of media advertising; or we can apply a message-centred approach in which the media is used to dis-conform typical racial stereotypes. An example of the message-centred approach is the Dove 'Real Beauty' campaign. Dove runs their Real Beauty campaign and a movement for self-esteem to fulfil \\"the need for a wider definition of beauty\\". According to the company, they have \\"employed various communications vehicles to challenge beauty stereotypes\\"; by running these campaigns, they explore forms of beauty that are not defined by race or racial body features, and put forth the perspective that beauty can come in all forms, shapes and colours. Issues such as beauty whitewashing is addressed where Dove states that audiences are \\"bombarded with unrealistic, unattainable images and images of beauty that impact their self-esteem\\". The audience-centred approach to reduce racial stereotypes is something that must take place at the implicit stage of stereotyping. Consumers must be provided with the knowledge of these stereotypes in order to look past them. \\"Suppressing the application of stereotypes in interpersonal situations\\" is a start to this process. Changing how people interact with others on a day-to-day basis is the first step, but the way people interact with the media must also be changed in this approach. Ramasubramanian talks about how people need to \\"expend conscious effort to reduce stereotype accessibility while viewing biased media materials\\". She also discusses how teaching media literacy would help audiences to critically analyze the way that the media portrays the social norms surrounding race. She states that \\"The assumption is that when media consumers become more conscious of the role of media in actively shaping social reality, they will be less likely to be influenced by the biased, unidimensional portrayals of racial groups in the media.\\" See also *Gender advertisement References Category:Racism Category:Social impact of advertising Category:Stereotypes ","title":"Racial stereotyping in advertising"},{"id":"45241573","text":"Parsloes Manor was a manor house in what is now known as Parsloes Park in Dagenham in the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham.

DIOS is considered the first surface-based surface-assisted laser desorption/ionization (SALDI- MS) approach. Prior approaches were accomplished using nanoparticles in a matrix of glycerol, while DIOS is a matrix-free technique in which a sample is deposited on a nanostructured (porous silicon) surface and the sample desorbed directly from the nanostructured surface through the adsorption of laser light energy. DIOS has been used to analyze organic molecules, metabolites, biomolecules and peptides, and, ultimately, to image tissues and cells. Background Soft laser desorption is a soft ionization technique which desorbs and ionizes molecules from surfaces with minimal fragmentation. This is useful for a broad range of small and large molecules and molecules that fragment easily. The first soft laser desorption techniques included Matrix- assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) nanoparticles in glycerol. In MALDI, the analyte is first mixed with a matrix solution. The matrix absorbs energy from the laser pulse and transfers it to the analyte, causing desorption and ionization of the sample. MALDI generates [M+H]+ ions. DIOS was first reported by Gary Siuzdak, Jing Wei and Jillian M. Buriak in 1999. It was developed as a matrix-free alternative to MALDI for smaller molecules. Because MALDI uses a matrix, background ions are introduced due to ionization of the matrix. These ions reduce the usefulness of MALDI for small molecules. In contrast, DIOS uses a porous silicon surface to trap the analyte. This surface is not ionized by the laser, therefore creating minimal background ionization and thus allowing for the analysis of small molecules. Applications DIOS has been shown to be an ultra-sensitive means of generating and detecting molecules at the yoctomole level, both for DIOS nanostructured surfaces modified with fluorocarbons, and a subsequent related technology known as Nanostructure-Initiator Mass Spectrometry and/or Nanostructure Imaging Mass Spectrometry (NIMS). DIOS has been shown to detect peptides, natural products, small organic molecules, and polymers with little fragmentation. DIOS can be used for proteomics. It has been reported as a useful method protein identification. Because it is matrix free, it can be used to identify smaller biomolecules than MALDI. In addition, it can be used to monitor reactions on a single surface through repeated MS analyses. Reaction monitoring can be used to screen enzyme inhibitors. Atmospheric pressure DIOS was shown to be an effective tool for quantitative analysis of drugs with high proton affinity. The use of DIOS to image small molecules has been demonstrated. Lin He and coworkers imaged small molecules on mouse liver cells. They also used marker molecules to image HEK 293 cancer cells.

Life and career  After a two-year stay in Europe, Victor Pilon enrolled in visual arts at the University of Ottawa. In 1983, after receiving his bachelor's degree with a specialization in photography, he moved to Montreal. With Michel Lemieux, he founded the company Lemieux Pilon 4D Art in 1990. Since then, they have worked together to create a plethora of multimedia productions, including La Belle et la B√™te (2011), NORMAN (2007), La Temp√™te (2005) and Anima (2002), all of which have toured internationally. In 2003, Pilon and Lemieux did the visual design for the T.V. show The Planets, based on the music of Gustav Holst, presented on both the French and English networks of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). They also created many large-scale events such as Harmony 2000, a show created to celebrate the beginning of the new millennium, and Soleil de Minuit, the closing performance of Montreal International Jazz Festival 2004 (MIJF), commemorating, respectively, the 20th and 25th anniversaries of Cirque du Soleil and the MIJF. They were also behind Cirque du Soleil's DELIRIUM. With over fifty artists onstage, this multimedia production revisited the music of Cirque du Soleil's past productions. In 2008, they directed Starmania, the famous show by Luc Plamondon and Michel Berger. It was the first time this musical was produced as an opera. As official photographer for the British royal family when in Canada, Pilon has covered more than 30 of their visits.

Regulations of the European Union (\\"EU Seal Regime\\") generally prohibiting the importation and placing on the market of seal products, with certain exceptions, including for seal products derived from hunts conducted by Inuit or indigenous communities (IC exception) and hunts conducted for marine resource management purposes (MRM exception). Canada and Norway filed a complaint before the WTO seeking to overturn the ban, but the ban was upheld. Seal hunting Seal hunting occurs in various parts of the world for commercial, subsistence and cultural reasons. Seal hunting is also carried out in some areas for the sustainable management of marine resources. At least 15 seal species are currently hunted, but the majority of hunted animals belong to five species: harp seals, ringed seals, grey seals, hooded seals and cape fur seals. The seal populations that are hunted for commercial purposes ‚Äì an estimated 15 million animals ‚Äì are generally not endangered. Some 900,000 seals are hunted each year around the globe, with the commercial hunt in Canada, Greenland and Namibia accounting for some 60% of the seals killed each year. Hunting for commercial purposes also takes place in Russia and Norway. Around one third of the world trade in seal products either passes through or ends up in the EU market. Seal hunts around the world are governed by different rules and regulations. In some countries comprehensive systems are in place, while in others the seal hunt is regulated to a lesser degree. Within the EU, certain methods and means of capture and killing are prohibited in areas protected under EU nature law (i.e. the Habitats Directive). Conflict As a result of the ban, Canada and Norway filed a complaint with the Dispute Settlement Body of the WTO against the European Communities claiming that the European Communities were being discriminatory against their producers of seal products. Both Canada and Norway are insistent on the fact that the seals are killed in an ethical manner and argued that ruling would potentially set a dangerous precedent going forward because it was based on morality and not science. Canada also argued that the Canadian government places strict regulation on their seal hunt industry, enforcing a quota to not allow any more than 400,000 seals be hunted in a given year. It is believed that only approximately 55,000 seals have been hunted through 2014. =Product at issue= Products that are either processed or unprocessed, deriving or obtained from seals. =Ruling and reaction= The WTO ruled in favour of the EU Seal regime and Canada and Norway filed for an appeal. The Dispute Settlement Body appellate committee upheld the initial ruling issued. The decision reached by the WTO appellate will only spark more debates as to determine how such a controversial ban can be implemented when it had upheld some of its prior rulings while overturning others. They upheld the initial findings of the committee that the EU Seal Regime was in violation of the most-favored nation status of the GATT agreement. This is because the Seal Regime did not immediately allow access to the same market advantage to Canada and Norway as it did with Greenland. The appellate body upheld the panel's findings that the EU Seal Regime was \\"necessary to protect public morals\\" . Ross Lord reported that the WTO had found that despite the fact that the ban had been discriminatory towards Canadian and Norway as compared to the European seal hunting producers yet it had fulfilled the objective of addressing the EU's public moral concerns on seal welfare. The IFAW was very happy with the ruling, stating that it was a \\"great day for seals\\". Sheryl Fink, IFAW's wildlife campaigns director, blasted what she called \\"the desperate, last-ditch effort\\" to have the ban overturned. \\"The ruling confirms yet again that animal welfare concerns are a legitimate reason for WTO members to regulate trade, and that the EU is justified in banning the importation and sale of products from cruel commercial hunting of seals,\\" Fink said.

In 1642 it was recorded that an art dealer named Emanuel Burck sold art pieces signed with the name \\"Judith Molenaer\\" and \\"Judith Leyster\\". Molenaer was her married name from her husband Jan Miense Molenaer. It is possible that Emanuel Burck personally knew Leyster and used her married name instead of her maiden name on purpose. Another name that she went by on legal documents was \\"Juffrow Molenaer\\". When her husband, Jan Miense Molenaer, died, the inventory of paintings in their home were not listed by the name of Judith Leyster but instead by the name of: \\"Juffrow Molenaer\\", 'His wife\\", \\"Wife of the deceased\\", and \\"Judith Molenaer\\". In 1903 it was documented that the British dealer and auction house Sir George Donaldson, exhibited The Last Drop and Leyster's Merry Trio together. The Last Drop and the Merry Trio were then exhibited together in the 1904 Guildhall exhibition, Painters of the Dutch School, where they were listed under both Judith Leyster and Frans Hals. The Last Drop and Merry Trio may be pendants as they were then reported to have the same measurements. At this time, Cornelis Hofstede de Groot recognized Leyster's signature on the Carousing Couple, which had previously been credited to Frans Hals. After recognizing Leyster's signature on the Carousing Couple, Groot then identified six more of Judith Leyster's paintings. The Guildhall exhibit presented a biography for Frans Hals, but not for Judith Leyster. The organizers of the exhibit did not want to surrender Frans Hals's label. It is often mistaken that Leyster was a pupil of Frans Hals, although there is no sufficient proof that this was the case. There is a slight resemblance between Leyster's work and Frans Hals's artistic style, but this is not enough to prove that she was his student. In 1904, organizers of that same Guildhall exhibition also attributed the painting Young Women at Her Toilet to the name of Leyster, but wrote about Leyster's art in a negative way. = Restoration = Juliane Harms documented The Last Drop in 1908. At that time, the moralizing figure of the skeleton had been painted out and a lamp stood in its place. The skeleton of The Last Drop was only known because of a studio copy. In the 1990s, the canvas was put under the examination of raking light and X-ray photography. The painting has since been restored, removing the painted lamp and revealing the skeleton. The now unconcealed skeleton demonstrates that later generations were not beholden to the image of death in the middle of the painting. This moral representation was despised enough for someone to commit the act of overpainting the skeleton.  Interpretation  In reference to the skeleton and the party scene in The Last Drop, one underlying meaning for this art piece focuses on the loss of self-respect and dissipated state of drunkenness. Both men appear to be unconcerned about the actions they are committing as the skeleton is in their presence. The skeleton's facial expression and stance show that it is enjoying itself just as much as the drunken men. Skeletons were familiar figures in seventeenth-century art, representing the unavoidable nature of death. The figures of the two men appear to be similar to the figures in the scene of the Merry Trio, also painted by Judith Leyster in 1629. The Merry Trio and The Last Drop accompany each other representing night and day. Merry Trio illustrates the first stage of drinking, typically in the evening as the sun is setting. The Last Drop is the later stage of the party after drinking has continued; it is now dark and then men are blinded by the effects of drink. The night scene is represented by the use of the candle between the men and the skeleton. At this point in the night, both men are very drunk and unaware of the skeleton among them. = Frima Fox Hofrichter = King from Han's Holbein's Dance of Death According to Hofrichter, the scene shows a common vanitas theme with an inverted tankard and a smoking pipe to show that the party is over. The skeleton holds up an hourglass to emphasize that time is running out on the party, but also on the lives of those present. This is similar to Hans Holbein's Dance of Death series, which also shows a skeleton hanging around those who are intoxicated and giving an individual more to drink. This seems to be the original meaning of the painting before the table was painted over the skeleton. Judith Leyster used a candle to light up the activities that were taking place and establish the nighttime setting. In contrast, the daylight scene of The Merry Trio serves to show that true gaiety can be found in moderation. When Hofrichter offered this interpretation of The Last Drop, she only knew of the concealed skeleton from x-ray images. = Recent interpretation = In the Philadelphia Museum of Art online catalog for The Last Drop, the artwork is described as a scene of vastenavond. Vastenavond is also known as Shrove Tuesday. This is an annual celebration honored by Christian denominations. This celebration occurs in the seventh week before Easter and the day before Ash Wednesday. The catalog explains that The Last Drop as a representation of young men binging on alcohol before the fasting and restraining of the consumption of alcohol of Lent, based on the actions the individuals are performing and the items they are holding. The skeleton is a representation of the consequences of their overindulgence. The figure of death holds both a skull and an hourglass in front of the men, yet they are unaware due to their mental state.

Life  Igor Kaczurowskyj was born on 1 September 1918 in Nizhyn (Ukraine) in a family of graduated of the Kyiv University. His father practised law, afterwards specialized in economy as well, for some time the held the rank of a state secretary assistant in the Central Council of Ukraine (Ukrainian: –¶–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞ –†–∞–¥–∞). Until the age of 12, Kaczurowskyj lived in Kruty, a small village (presently in the Nizhyn district of the Chernihiv Oblast). In 1932 the family, in order to avoid repressions, set off for Kursk (Russia). Kaczurowskyj studied, till 1941, in the Kursk \\"pedagogical institute\\" (an establishment of higher education in the Soviet Union), where Boris Jarkho (Jarcho),http://homepage.univie.ac.at/emmerich.kelih/wp- content/uploads/p2007_jarcho_bio_glottometrics.pdf Petro Odarchenko were professors; in 1942 he returned to Ukraine, in 1943 he moved westward; from 1945 on he lived in Austria. Kaczurowskyj started to publish his writings in 1946, winning the next year a literary prize for his short story ‚ÄúThe Passport‚Äù; at the same time he began to co-operate with the staff of the magazine ‚ÄúLitavry‚Äù (‚ÄúKettle-drums‚Äù). He was one of the founding members of the Union of Ukrainian Scholars, Writers and Artists in Salzburg. In 1948 he emigrated to Argentina and settled near Buenos Aires. Working as a port labourer, he at the same time edited the magazine ‚ÄúPorohy‚Äù (‚ÄúDnipro- Waterfalls‚Äù), wrote for the periodicals ‚ÄúOvyd‚Äù (‚ÄúOutlook‚Äù), ‚ÄúMitla‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Broom‚Äù), ‚ÄúNovi Dni‚Äù (‚ÄúNew Days‚Äù).

In 1969 he moved to Munich (German Federal Republic), remaining nevertheless a citizen of Argentina. In the 1970‚Äì80s he wrote and broadcast over two-thousand scripts, as a literary commentator (program specialist) at the ‚ÄúUkrainian Desk‚Äù of the broadcasting service Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. At the Ukrainian Free University (Munich), he obtained his PhD degree for his thesis ‚ÄúOld Slavic beliefs and their connections with Indo-Iranian religions‚Äù; from 1973 on he lectured at the UFU, from 1982 as an ordinary professor; at the Faculty of Philosophy he held lectures on Metre (poetry)versification, stylistics, theory of literary genres, history of the Ukrainian literature of the 1920‚Äì30s, History of Medieval European literature.–Ü–≥–æ—Ä –ö–∞—á—É—Ä–æ–≤—Å—å–∫–∏–π // –í—ñ—Ç—á–∏–∑–Ω–∞. ‚Äî 2007. ‚Äî ‚Ññ 1‚Äî2. He was a member of the Association of Ukrainian Writers in Exile ‚ÄúSlovo‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Word‚Äù), the Union of Argentine Writers SADE (Sociedad Argentina de Escritores), National Union of Writers of Ukraine (since 1992). In accordance with his own wish, uttered repeatedly in conversations and letters to acquaintances, his ashes were buried in his home village Kruty, the solemn event having taken place 22 November 2013.  Poetry  Igor Kaczurowskyj is the author of the following books of verse: ‚ÄúNad Svitlym Dzherelom‚Äù (‚ÄúAt The Luminous Fountain), Salzburg 1948; ‚ÄúV Dalekiy Havani‚Äù (‚ÄúIn The Far Harbor‚Äù), Buenos Aires 1956; ‚ÄúPisnya Pro Bilyi Parus‚Äù (‚ÄúWhite Sail Song‚Äù), Munich 1971; ‚ÄúSvichada Vichnosty‚Äù (‚ÄúMirrors of Eternity‚Äù), Munich 1990; ‚ÄúOsinni Piznyotsvity‚Äù (‚ÄúAutumn Crocuses‚Äù), Kyiv 2000, 2001). The last was published in one volume, along with the poem ‚ÄúSelo‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Village‚Äù; 1st edition: Neu-Ulm 1960; 4th edition with the title ‚ÄúSelo v Bezodni‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Village in an Abyss‚Äù; Kyiv 2006). The final collection of selected poems named ‚ÄúLiryka‚Äù was published in Lviv (2013). As a poet Kaczurowskyj was a follower of the Kyiv neoclassicists, a literary disciple of Mykhailo Orest (along with Orest, he is supposed to be one of the representatives of the post-neoclassical movement, or younger neoclassicists). Similar to Mykola Zerov and the poets of his literary school, Kaczurowskyj was a master in ‚Äúpoetry of the second degree‚Äù (in his own terminology ‚Äútranspositive poetry‚Äù) such a ‚Äúpoetry of culture‚Äù which is considered by Dmytro Nalyvayko as one of the major attributes of classicism as a type of artistic thought (section ‚ÄúStara Evropa‚Äù (‚ÄúAncient Europe‚Äù) in the book ‚ÄúSvichada vichnosty‚Äù). At the same time Kaczurowskyj composed refined love poems (section ‚ÄúPisnya pro bilyi parus‚Äù in the book of verse of the same title), and poetry of nature (section ‚ÄúHrybna mistyka‚Äù (‚ÄúMushroom mysticism‚Äù) in ‚ÄúSvichada vichnosty‚Äù). In general, Kaczurowskyj's poetry is marked by a painful disharmony between spiritualized beauty embodied in primeval nature, the masterworks of art of the past ages and the spiritual decay of modern civilization, between high human feelings and contrasts of social reality. His long poem ‚ÄúSelo‚Äù was the first great epic in Ukrainian literature depicting the tragedy of Ukrainian Holodomor (Famine-Genocide) of 1932‚Äì3. The main characteristics of his poetical style, are a neoclassical clarity, achieved by open metaphors, a refined lexis, a select poetical language, free of every coarsness or vulgarism, the strict adherence to the accentual-syllabic (classic) verse meter, and the perfect dominion of canons ruling the poems' stanzas (mostly of Roman origin). Kaczurowskyj's poetical parodies, epigrams, jests, and other humorous writings, used to be published, abroad and in Ukraine, under the pseudonym Khvedosiy Chichka. As a writer for children, Kaczurowskyj is the author of the long poem \\"Pan Kotskyi\\" (\\"Mister Kotskyi\\"; the first edition, Kyiv 1992; the second edition, Kyiv 2016, under the patronage of the German Embassy in Kyiv, with a German adaptation, in verse, by Wilhelm Steinb√ºchler), and the book \\"U svynyachomu tsarstvi\\" (\\"In The Wild Boars' Kingdom\\", Munich 1997). Prose His prose writings comprise the novel \\"Shlyakh nevidomoho\\" (\\"The Way of an Unknown\\"), Munich 1956, which later was translated into English by Yuriy Tkach (\\"Because Deserters Are Immortal\\", Doncaster, Australia 1979) and into German by Lidia Kriukow (\\"Der Weg eines Unbekannten: Geschichte eines ukrainischen Deserteurs\\", Frankfurt am Main 2018); the novel \\"Dim nad krucheyu\\" (\\"House on a Cliff\\"), Munich 1966; these books consist of episodes, relating the adventures of a young Ukrainian intellectual during the Second World War, between two demoniac forces, the Soviets, and Hitler's nationalists, some reviewers, such as Caroline Egerton of \\"The Age\\", Melbourne,Egerton Caroline: Travels of Terryfying Futility: Because Deserters are Immortal, by Igor Kaczurowskyj, translated by Yuriy Tkach (Bayda Books).

Translations Igor Kaczurowskyj's translations of poetry had primarily appeared as parts of his aforementioned books of verse. Also, separate books of translations were published, such as: Francesco Petrarca \\"Vybrane\\" (\\"Selected Poems)\\", Munich 1982; \\"Zolota haluzka\\" (\\"Golden Branch\\"), being a collection of Iberian and Ibero-American poetry, from Spanish, Portuguese, and Catalan languages, Buenos Aires‚ÄìMunich 1991; \\"Okno v ukrainskuyu poeziyu\\" (\\"A Window To Ukrainian Poetry\\"), Ukrainian poems in Russian translations, Munich‚ÄìKharkiv‚ÄìNizhyn 1997; \\"Stezhka kriz' bezmir\\" (\\"A Path Through The Immens\\"), 100 German poems, 750‚Äì1950, Paris‚ÄìLviv‚ÄìZwickau 2000; \\"Pisnya pro Rolanda\\" (\\"Song of Roland\\"), from Old French, maintaining the original syllabic metre, Lviv 2008; \\"Choven bez rybalky\\" by Alejandro Casona, a theatrical piece, translated from Spanish (\\"Boat Without Fisherman\\"), Buenos Aires 2000; \\"Nobelivs'ka lektsiya z literatury\\" (\\"Nobel Literature Lesson\\") by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Neu Ulm 1973. The compilatory volume of his translations, \\"Kruh ponadzemnyi\\" (\\"The Super-Terrestrial Circle\\"), Kyiv 2007 (526 pages) comprises approximately 670 poems and fragments of over 350 authors, translated from 23 old and modern languages, first of all from Spanish (fragments of \\"Cantar de mio Cid\\", works of Jos√© Asunci√≥n Silva, Rub√©n Dar√≠o, Amado Nervo, Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez, Alfonsina Storni, Gabriela Mistral, Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, Jorge Luis Borges, etc.), from Italian (the early sonnet writers: Petrarch, Michelangelo, etc., Portuguese (Olavo Bilac, etc.), from German (the Minnesingers, Friedrich H√∂lderlin, Ludwig Uhland, Joseph von Eichendorff, Friedrich R√ºckert, Annette von Droste-H√ºlshoff, etc.), from English (ballads, Alfred Tennyson, etc.), from French (Jos√© Maria de Heredia, Paul Verlaine, Arthur Rimbaud, etc.), Polish (Julian Tuwim, etc.), Russian (Fedor Tyutchev, Aleksey Tolstoy, Fedor Sologub, Ivan Bunin, Maksimilian Voloshin, Nikolay Gumilyov, Anna Akhmatova, Osip Mandel'shtam, Sergey Yesenin, Leonid Kiselyov, etc.), and also from Ukrainian into Russian (Maksym Ryls'kyi, Mykola Zerov, Yuriy Klen, Volodymyr Svidzyns'kyi, Yevhen Pluzhnyk, Mykhaylo Orest, Oleh Ol'zhych, Lina Kostenko, etc.). Igor Kaczurowskyj considered himself a follower of Mykola Zerov's translating school, that is the translation of each verse with a maximum approach to the original, not only as regards the contents, but the metrical, and stylistic particularities as well. Sometimes, he recurred to prose interlinear translations made by Lidia Kriukow, who is familiar with many European languages. Scientific work In literary theory, Kaczurowskyj's major aim was the development of the principles put forward by Boris Yarkho and Volodymyr Derzhavyn. He is the author of several textbooks of theory of literature, which was the main subject ‚Äî along with History of Literature ‚Äî of his lectures and scientific papers. They are: * \\"Novela yak zhanr\\" (\\"The Short Story as a Genre\\"), Buenos Aires 1958; * \\"Strofika\\" (\\"A Study of Stanzas\\"), Munich 1967; * \\"Fonika\\" (\\"Phonic\\"), Munich 1984; * \\"Narys komparatyvnoyi metryky\\" (\\"An Outline on Comparative Meters\\").

A synthesis of Kaczurowskyj's research work as a historian of Ukrainian literature, may be found in his book \\"Promenysti syl'vety\\" (\\"Shining Silhouettes\\") ‚Äì lectures, papers, articles, essays, treatises, the main purpose of this work being to recall to mind the wrongly forgotten gifted authors of Ukrainian literature, especially those of the Second World War generation, and to relieve the minds of readers and researchers from the stereotype concepts regarding famous representatives of Ukrainian literature (Taras Shevchenko, Ivan Franko, Lesya Ukrayinka). Selected broadcasting scripts on arts and literature from \\"Radio Liberty\\" were compiled in a volume: \\"150 vikon u svit\\" (\\"150 Windows to The World\\"), Kyiv 2008. Due to the aesthetic concepts and canons featured in his textbooks and other writings, Kaczurowskyj may be considered an outstanding advocate of the theories of Ukrainian neoclassicism (along with Volodymyr Derzhavyn). He participates in the conviction that Beauty \\"is the greatest welfare, as a definite artistic synthesis of Goodness and Truth\\" (Derzhavyn), he advocates the autonomy of art, which, in his opinion, \\"is completely independent of social, political, climatic or any other circumstances\\", he defends the long duration of the traditions of artistic creativity, as a contrast and in opposition to the so-called post-modernism and its negation of past times artistic achievements. Kaczurowskyj is the editor, together with Sviatoslav Hordynsky and Lidia Kriukow, as well as author of the \\"Forewords\\" (\\"Introductions\\") of the volumes: \\"Khrestomatiya ukrayins'koyi relihiynoyi literatury.

It provides legal assistance to individuals charged with a crime in state court who are financially unable to retain private counsel. The office consists of the Primary Public Defender, the Alternate Public Defender, the Office of Assigned Counsel & the Multiple Conflicts Office. Mental health and juvenile court matters are handled by special units within the divisions. Courts within their jurisdiction include the San Diego Superior Court, the California Court of Appeal for the Fourth District, and the California Supreme Court. The San Diego County District Attorney and the San Diego City Attorney prosecute alleged felony and misdemeanor violations of California state law that occur within the jurisdiction of San Diego County. Alleged federal law violations by indigent defendants are defended by the Federal Defenders of San Diego Inc. History The San Diego County Public Defender's Office was established in 1988 by a San Diego County resolution. The Alternate Public Defender was established by the Board of Supervisors in 1990. In 2005, the Multiple Conflicts Office - Major Cases (MCO) was created to represent people who are charged with complicated and serious cases throughout San Diego County and who are financially unable to retain private counsel. In 2009, the County of San Diego consolidated separate indigent defense offices‚ÄîPublic Defender, Alternate Public Defender, Office of Assigned Counsel, Juvenile Delinquency & Multiple Conflict Office‚Äîinto one office. The office formed a Public Defender Community Outreach Program that strives to connect with partners in San Diego communities to enrich the lives of those less fortunate and assist in securing equal access to justice. In 1994, San Diego County Public Defenders Kathleen Coyne and Susan Clemens were awarded Public Defender of the Year by the California Public Defender's Association for their work defending Dale Akiki in the Faith Chapel Church ritual abuse case. Several San Diego County Public Defenders have gone on to become judges in California Superior Court. In 2014, the office filed over 5,000 petitions‚Äîafter Proposition 47 (2014)‚Äîto have felony convictions and sentences reduced. Primary Public Defender The San Diego County Primary Public Defender (PPD) provides the majority of indigent defense services in San Diego County. The Primary Public Defender has five offices in the County: downtown San Diego, Vista (North County), Chula Vista (South Bay), El Cajon (East County), and a Juvenile Office. Alternate Public Defender The APD is responsible for defending those cases where the Primary Public Defender has a conflict of interest or is unable to defend the individual for various reasons. The Office of the Alternate Public Defender has two divisions. The Adult Criminal Division‚Äîoperating out of all APD locations‚Äîrepresents indigent persons accused of a crime. The Juvenile Delinquency Division‚Äîout of Kearny Mesa‚Äîrepresents minors accused of truancy or criminal offenses. The Alternate Public Defender maintains offices in downtown San Diego, El Cajon, South Bay, Vista, and Kearny Mesa. Multiple Conflicts Office - Major Cases The Multiple Conflicts Office - Major Cases (MCO) accepts court appointments that the Public Defender and the Alternate Public Defender are unable to accept due to a conflict of interest or other order of the court. MCO represents people who are charged with only the most complicated and serious cases throughout San Diego County. MCO attorneys possess many years of experience and training for the most serious types of criminal cases. The MCO is an independent and ethically separate division of the Department of the Public Defender and does not share client information or otherwise interact with attorneys from other divisions on the same case. Office of Assigned Counsel If a court finds that the PPD and APD have a conflict of interest, then Office of Assigned Counsel (OAC) will provide the indigent defendant with a private practitioner who has been pre-screened and placed on a panel managed by the OAC.

It stars Lindsey Haun, Blake Berris, RJ Mitte, Randy Schulman, Diane Dalton, and Micah Nelson. House sitters (Haun, Berris) discover that an unhappily married couple (Schulman, Dalton) may have left them in a haunted house.  Plot  Unhappily married couple Alan and Sarah reunite when she is released from a mental hospital. Alan, a classical music critic, announces that he has bought tickets to Italy for them both and introduces Kelly, whom he has hired to house sit for them. Although reluctant to leave for a foreign country so soon after her release, Sarah eventually agrees. Later flashbacks reveal that Alan and Kelly have been having an affair, and Alan intends to stress Sarah to the breaking point, so that she will again attempt to commit suicide. Meanwhile, Jesse, Kelly's petty criminal boyfriend, pushes her to allow him to stay in the house with her. Kelly refuses, and, upset that she allows her disabled brother Tim to move in, Jesse storms off. Jesse later steals Alan's car and prepares to sell it to a friend, but he reconsiders his actions when he finds Adam, a child who has been abandoned at a local supermarket. Taking Adam back to the house, Jesse proposes that they ransom him. Shocked by the suggestion, Kelly attempts to return Adam to his parents but can not get any information from the child, who seems comfortable staying with them. Panicking over what to do next, Kelly listens to the radio and television broadcasts, but none of them mention a missing boy. Kelly becomes suspicious that something is wrong, but Jesse dismisses her concerns. Tim sees visions in the house, and his behavior becomes erratic. When one of the visions reveals to Tim that Kelly and Alan plan to run away together, he tells Jesse, who reacts nonchalantly. In Italy, Alan and Sarah argue over whether they should return to the United States early, and both become stressed from visions and flashbacks, one of which reveals that Adam is their dead child. Drunk and responding to a haunting flashback, Alan becomes defensive about Adam's death. While Sarah is driving their car, Alan says he covered up the fact that he accidentally killed Adam while playing golf in the back yard, and Sarah becomes distraught. As her driving becomes erratic, Alan insists that she pull over, and they become involved in a fatal car accident. Kelly, Jesse, Tim, and Adam hear the accident broadcast over the entertainment center's speakers in the house. As time goes on, Kelly's and Jesse's personalities shift to become more like Alan and Sarah. Jesse becomes interested in golf and classic music, dressing well, and starting a family. He urges Tim to stop cursing and get a job, and asks Adam to call him \\"dad\\". After an initial period of sickness, Kelly begins baking pies and acting as a mother to Adam. Confused by the changes in Kelly's and Jesse's personalities, Tim becomes alienated and ultimately commits suicide. When Kelly locates a photo book full of pictures of Adam, the two of them bond, and a breeze blows out the candles on a birthday cake for Adam.  Cast  * Lindsey Haun as Kelly * Blake Berris as Jesse * RJ Mitte as Tim * Randy Schulman as Alan * Diane Dalton as Sarah * Micah Nelson as Adam * Michele Mariana as Rose Pepper  Production  The film was shot in Portland, Oregon.  Release  House of Last Things premiered at the Festival international du film fantastique de G√©rardmer. Revolver Entertainment purchased distribution rights in the U.S. and Canada after the 2014 Cannes Film Festival.  Reception  Ben Umstead of Twitch Film wrote, \\"Though the film is at times still quite creepy, and always persistently strange, Bartlett's story is refreshingly absent of evil and any real terror, gruesome or otherwise. For as much as it is a ghost story House Of Last Things is also a love story.\\" Scott Hallam of Dread Central rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"Instead of being a traditional haunting tale, it's an ambitious take on a ghost story which at times works very well and at others becomes muddy.\\" Mark L.

General Phoumi Nosavan established himself as the strongman running Laos in a bloodless coup on 25 December 1959. He would be himself overthrown on 10 August 1960 by the young paratrooper captain who had backed him in the 1959 coup. When Captain Kong Le impressed the American officials underwriting Laos as a potential communist, they backed Phoumi's return to power in November and December 1960. In turn, the Soviets backed Kong Le as their proxy in this Cold War standoff. After the Battle of Vientiane ended in his defeat, Kong Le withdrew northward to the strategic Plain of Jars on 16 December 1960. Having taken an independent stance in the Laotian Civil War, Kong Le and his Forces Armee Neutraliste would remain an unpredictable influence upon the war until 1974. Overview and background Beginning on 23 December 1950, the United States began military aid to the French administration of the Kingdom of Laos as they fought the First Indochina War. U.S. support would increase to the point of underwriting the Lao budget in its entirety. The rationale behind the support was that it was in American interests to combat the communist insurrectionists in Laos as part of the Cold War. Banned by treaty from stationing an overt Military Assistance Advisory Group in Laos, in December 1955 the U.S instead chose to establish a \\"civilian\\" military aid office within the U.S. embassy in Vientiane. The Programs Evaluation Office was charged with channeling war material to the Lao military.Castle, pp. 9‚Äì20. Of the 68 ethnic minorities that comprised the Lao population, the Lao Loum numerically predominated. They dwelt along the Mekong River Valley along the southern border with the Kingdom of Thailand. The King of Laos and most of the ruling class of Laos were Lao Loum. About 20 of these influential lowland Lao families actually controlled Laos.Castle, pp. 5, 20, 141. With the PEO confined to office work, distribution of military goods took place without PEO followup. From 1955 to 1958, the U.S. would sink $202 million into Laos. This aid led to corruption as it was siphoned off by recipients.Anthony & Sexton, pp. 15, 19‚Äì20, 28‚Äì29. As Bernard Fall noted from personal observation, the support of the Lao military was for political reasons, and not necessarily for self-defense. The Lao soldiers were among the most highly paid in the world. They cost an average of about $1,000 apiece annually; the global average for a soldier's pay was $848 per capita. Many Lao soldiers were fictional recruits, with their pay being siphoned off by Lao officers. Junior Lao officers afforded expensive villas. More disheartening to PEO, there were thievish Americans in the program.Fall, pp. 163‚Äì166. The basic Lao economy was so underdeveloped that an artificial economy developed. U.S. dollars funded imports that were sold commercially on the open market. The resultant Lao kips went to underwrite the Lao military. These payments were also subsequently turned over into foreign goods. With no controls on the imports, the quality and utility of provisions were often ignored. Fall summarized the result by quoting a pro-American Lao officer, Sisouk na Champassak: \\"Black market deals in American aid dollars reached such proportions that the Pathet Lao needed no propaganda to turn the rural people against the townspeople.\\"Fall, p. 165. This rampant boodling would provoke the ire of young Royal Lao Army Captain Kong Le. The coups =Phoumi Nosavan's rise to power= On 29 July 1959, under command of General Amkha Soukhavong, Captain Kong Le led Bataillon Parachutistes 2 (Parachute Battalion 2) to reinforce other Royalist troops engaged with the Pathet Lao communists in armed disputes over Royalist outposts in Xam Neua Province. Accompanied by two Filipino advisers, the battalion patrolled for three days without contact with any enemy. When the captain drove to Xam Neua City to report to General Amkha, he was outraged to find the city had been abandoned by the general, as well as by its military and civil administration.Conboy & Morrison, p. 21. Kong Le was further disgruntled by the RLA's failure to pay his men while they were on the combat sweep. By December 1959, Kong Le and his paratroop battalion were bivouacked at Wattay Airfield outside the Lao capital of Vientiane. Camp Sikhay offered the paras a choice of battered wooden shacks or decaying French colonial housing on the banks of the Mekong River. Kong Le made connections with the Project Hotfoot Special Forces who were building a ranger training course nearby.Conboy & Morrison, p. 31. As a result, BP 2 would run through the ranger training in 200 man increments.Conboy & Morrison, pp. 31‚Äì32. While the commanding officer of BP 2 was in the United States, leaving Kong Le in charge of the battalion, he was approached by his uncle-in-law, General Ouane Rattikone.Conboy & Morrison, p. 25. Note: Kong Le's third wife was Ouane's niece. On 25 December 1959, the term of the National Assembly expired. However, elections for its replacement were not scheduled until April. As Kong Le led the only crack troops in town, his help was essential in helping Ouane and General Phoumi Nosavan install the latter in power to fill the political vacuum. The paras secured their airfield, captured the city's radio station, the national bank, municipal power plant, and various ministries without firing a single shot.Conboy & Morrison, p. 25. Prime Minister Phoui Sananikone had been decisively deposed. Phoumi thus succeeded to the dictatorship of Laos because of Kong Le's decisive actions. =Kong Le's coup= On 7 January 1960, a 67-year-old moderate politician named Kou Abhay was appointed as Prime Minister of Laos. His mandate was to serve until elections in April.Fall, p. 176. The April elections were fraudulently fixed by the Royal Lao Army, aided by the Central Intelligence Agency. The Pathet Lao lost to such unfair tactics as gerrymandered election districts, payoffs, and stuffed ballot boxes. Prince Somsanith Vongkotrattana was named Prime Minister.Conboy, Morrison, pp. 25-26.Castle, p. 19. At 0300 hours 10 August 1960, Kong Le launched the Second Paratroop Battalion in a coup. The same crucial points were seized as in the 1959 coup, with the addition of the seizure of Vientiane's docks at Tha Deua and the arrest of General Sounthone Pathammavong, the army commander in chief.Conboy & Morrison, p. 32. By 0700 hours, Kong Le controlled the capital. Only six people were killed during the takeover. Any possible opposition was stranded in Luang Prabang.Conboy & Morrison, p. 33. Thao Ma flew to Luang Prabang to relate news of the coup to Phoumi Nosavan.Conboy, Morrison, p. 156. Kong Le's ascension to power had lifted him from obscurity to the world's notice. Both sides of the proxy war, the Americans and the Russians, began to shape their moves to influence him.Anthony & Sexton, p. 29. Within a day, the Pathet Lao pledged their cooperation with Kong Le. =Tussle for spoils= Once in power, Kong Le denounced foreign intervention in Laos. In a series of public speeches on 10 and 11 August, the new head of state spoke out for the need for national neutrality. He saw little reason for Lao to fight Lao, as the Pathet Lao and the Royalists were doing. He resented undue influence by the wealthy ruling families.Anthony & Sexton, pp. 12, 29. In a blunt broadcast, he claimed: > What leads us to carry out this revolution is our desire to stop the bloody > civil war; eliminate grasping public servants and military > commanders...whose property amounts to much more than their monthly salaries > can afford.... It is the Americans who have brought government officials and > army commanders, and caused war and dissension in our country.Fall, p. 187. Of all the displaced government officials, only Phoumi Nosavan, holding the post of Minister of Defense, resisted being overthrown. On 10 August, Phoumi was flown by Thao Ma to Bangkok to solicit support from his first cousin, Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat, the dictator of the Kingdom of Thailand.Conboy & Morrison, p. 37. On 13 August, the National Assembly met under the guns of the mutineers; under duress, they dismissed the cabinet members stranded in Luang Prabang. At the same time, Kong Le demanded Souvanna Phouma assume the post of Prime Minister.Conboy & Morrison, pp. 33, 37. Meanwhile, Phoumi was flown by Thao Ma to Savannakhet to establish a headquarters there to pull together a resistance movement. On 14 August, 21 members of the deposed administration joined him there. On 16 August, pro-Phoumi propaganda leaflets were airdropped on Vientiane, promising Phoumi's return.Conboy & Morrison, p. 34. However, in Vientiane on 17 August, the National Assembly, while held captive by Kong Le's forces, formed a new Royal Lao Government, naming Souvanna Phouma as Prime Minister.Conboy & Morrison, pp. 33‚Äì34. Souvanna subsequently appointed General Ouane as commander in chief of the RLA.Conboy & Morrison, pp. 13, 37. Official American reactions to the situation were mixed. In Vientiane, American officials, the Project Hotfoot teams, and the Programs Evaluation Office did not choose a side. However, a shadow PEO of about 40 Americans was formed in Savannakhet to support Phoumi because he was an avowed anti-communist. He began broadcasting anti-Kong Le radio messages on 18 August. Also on 18 August 1960, a Voice of America broadcast announced that it would support the King of Laos in his choice. The next day, Radio Pathet Lao began broadcasting anti- Kong Le propaganda.Castle, p. 22. Kong Le had his own leaflets airdropped over Savannakhet on 19 August.Conboy & Morrison, p. 45. Meanwhile, Field Marshal Sarit established the secretive Kaw Taw unit to channel support to Phoumi.Conboy & Morrison, p. 35. On 23 August, U.S. officials assured Phoumi of their backing.Ahern, pp. 13‚Äì14. That same day, Kong Le handed out 3,000 weapons for self-defense to villagers on the outskirts of Vientiane; most of these guns ended up in Pathet Lao hands. When Thai Border Patrol Police commandos from Phoumi's side shelled Vientiane on both 1 and 4 September, Kong Le's troops drove them off. The U.S. suspected Kong Le was leaning toward becoming an independent communist like Fidel Castro. There was political turmoil and sporadic combat within Laos as both Kong Le and Phoumi solicited support from Lao senior officers. Kong Le had not only the support of his own BP 2 in Military Region 5, but also that of the co-located BP 3. The staff at Military Region 1 in Luang Prabang plumped for him, as did Lieutenant Colonel Khamouane Boupha and his troops in farflung Phongsaly Province. Internationally, he drew tepid support, mostly by communist-bloc nations. The French military mission delivered vague promises and fresh French uniforms. Lao commanding officers such as Generals Amkha Soukhavong, Kouprasith Abhay, Ouane Rattikone, Oudone Sananikone, and Sing Rattanasamy backed him with various levels of enthusiasm. On 10 September 1960, Phoumi and Prince Boun Oum formed a Revolutionary Committee to oppose Souvanna Phouma's rule.Anthony & Sexton, p. 14. Phoumi used his influence with the Thai dictator to have an embargo placed on overland shipments into Laos; 10,000 tons of Vientiane-bound U.S. military materiel accumulated on Thai loading docks.Fall, p. 191. During the second week in September 1960, the CIA supplied Phoumi with a $1,000,000 bankroll to finance his coup.Warner, p. 29. On 16 September, the Pathet Lao ordered their troops to forgo attacking Kong Le's neutralist forces in favor of attacking Royalist units. The following day, the 2nd Pathet Lao Parachute Battalion attacked a Royalist garrison of 1,500 troops in Xam Neua. The Americans, who had been indecisive, now plumped for aerial resupply of besieged Xam Neua; they stressed that the action was purely defensive.Anthony & Sexton, p. 30.Ahern, p. 14. The Royal Lao Army lacking its own airlift capacity, Air America was contracted to use its two C-46s and two C-47s to resupply the RLA from 17 to 27 September. Meanwhile, on 22 September 1960, elements of BP 2 evicted pro-Phoumi troops from Pakxan, 120 kilometers from Vientiane.Anthony & Sexton, p. 15. In the far north, in the Pathet Lao occupied territory of Xam Neua, Kong Le's paratroopers parachuted in on 28 September. Two plus battalions of pro-Phoumi troops fled the city on 29 September, leaving it under control of Kong Le and the Pathet Lao. To the south of them, an airborne assault on Vientiane by Phoumi's paratroopers was scheduled for 29 September, then cancelled.Conboy & Morrison, pp. 35‚Äì36. On 6 October, American ambassador Winthrop G. Brown, in ongoing attempts at mending the national split, asked King Sisavang Vatthana to form a caretaker government that would include both sides.Ahern, p. 15. Former ambassador and serving Assistant Secretary of State J. Graham Parsons flew in to pressure Souvanna Phouma into breaking contact with the Soviets. On 17 October, his companion, John N. Irwin II, flew south to Ubon to assure Phoumi of U.S. support.Ahern, p. 19. Also in early October, the U.S. suspended aid to Laos. Vang Pao declared that Military Region 2's forces backed Phoumi. After internecine struggle, by 10 November, Military Region 1 remained in Phoumi's control. On 9 November, after agreeing to accept Soviet aid, Souvanna named his new cabinet. It included Quinim Pholsena and a couple of Pathet Lao officials. This solidified American support for Phoumi.Anthony & Sexton, p. 31. Moreover, on 16 November, General Ouane changed sides; he flew to Savannakhet to join Phoumi.Conboy & Morrison, pp. 36‚Äì37. =Phoumi's counter- coup= With Central Intelligence Agency financial backing, and aided by CIA- trained commandos, at 0800 hours on 21 November 1960 Phoumi's troops launched their counter-coup to reclaim Vientiane.Warner, pp. 26‚Äì29. The northward movement to Vientiane would take nearly a month, but by 7 December, they were approaching Paksan, and poised for an attack on the capital. Kong Le ordered most of his paratroopers from Vientiane to reinforce his forward garrison at Paksan. On 10 December, General Southone tried to confer with Colonel Kouprasith Abhay in Vientiane; however, Abhay had sneaked off to Tha Deua to confer with Phoumi, who had helicoptered in for a planning meeting. Kouprasith Abhay's counter-coup attempt At this juncture, on 8 December, Colonel Kouprasith Abhay ventured forth from lurking in Camp Chinaimo to co-opt an air drop of paratroopers incoming from Luang Prabang. He gathered a scratch force of two companies of airborne soldiers and 150 military clerks and moved them in to displace the few Kong Le paras left in the capital. Kouprasith's men seized the radio station and various strategic points in the town. He announced his allegiance to Souvanna Phouma, and his opposition to Kong Le. Kouprasith doubted Phoumi's ability to solve the ongoing crisis; his name went unmentioned in the proclamations.Conboy & Morrison, pp. 38‚Äì39. Kong Le promptly recalled his reinforcements, and airborne soldiers returning from Paksan wearing scarlet armbands displaced Kouprasith's troops wearing white ones. Paksan fell to Phoumi on 8 December. Thus Kouprasith's counter-coup within the counter-coup was ended by the paratroopers responsible for the ongoing coup. Battle of Vientiane Suspicious of Kouprasith's ambitions, Phoumi appointed Brigadier General Bounleut Sanichanh as commander-in-chief of the counter-coup forces. On 9 December, Souvanna Phouma appointed General Southone to head the nation, then fled to Phnom Penh, Cambodia.Conboy & Morrison, p. 39. At 1030 hours on 10 December 1960, representatives of Kong Le departed for Hanoi to formalize a pact beginning a Soviet-backed airlift. Meanwhile, a scratch force of Phoumists launched a flanking movement from Savannakhet through Thailand to Chinimao.Conboy & Morrison, pp. 32‚Äì38. Kong Le spent 11 and 12 December trying to whip up the Vientiane citizenry's support for FAN. Phoumi's forces had pushed through Paksan and were crossing the Nam Ngum (Ngum River) only 50 kilometers from Vientiane.Conboy & Morrison, pp. 40‚Äì43. Meanwhile, in Luang Prabang, a quorum of the National Assembly, having been flown in by U.S. Operations Mission aircraft, voted \\"no confidence\\" in Souvanna Phouma's regime, and endorsed Phoumi and his Revolutionary Committee. By Lao law, the vote of \\"no confidence\\" left the country without a legal government until the king pronounced an ordinance establishing a new one. Royal Ordinance 282 promptly followed, in favor of Phoumi.Ahern, pp. 22-23. The battle for Vientiane began at 1320 hours on 13 December 1960 as Phoumi's forces attacked. The following four days' fighting would severely damage Vientiane. The central district was left in ruins; fallen trees and loose electrical wires littered the streets. The devastated city had suffered at least 600 houses destroyed, about an equal number of citizens killed, and 7,000 were left homeless. Military casualties were minor.Anthony & Sexton, p. 34. One source reported paratrooper casualties as three killed, ten wounded; another gives a figure of 17 killed.Savada, pp. 51‚Äì52 On 16 December, Kong Le loaded his troops onto vehicles and retreated northwards toward the Plain of Jars, leaving Phoumi's forces in control of the capital and country. Aftermath On 27 December 1960, Phoumi lodged a protest with the United Nations because the Soviet Union was airlifting supplies to Kong Le's troops. Once he did that, he was supplied with ten T-6 Harvards from Royal Thai Air Force stocks to build up the Royal Lao Air Force.Anthony, Sexton, p. 35. As the battle wound down, 40 National Assembly members were flown from Luang Prabang to Savannakhet via Air America. Once they passed a vote of no confidence, the King appointed Prince Boun Oum to head an interim government, although Souvanna had yet to resign as Prime Minister. Both Thailand and the United States immediately recognized the new government. Kong Le and his newly formed Forces Armee Neutraliste (Neutralist Armed Force) succeeded in withdrawing northward to the strategic 500 square mile Plain of Jars.Ahern, p. 27. Once there, they were supported by a Soviet airlift supply operation. Once established there, FAN would pursue an erratic course. It would ally with, fight against, or coexist with, either Vietnamese, Pathet Lao, or Royalist forces through 1974.Castle, pp. 55‚Äì56, 63, 67, 73‚Äì74. Endnotes References * Ahern, Thomas L.

Foam concrete, also known as Lightweight Cellular Concrete (LCC), Low Density Cellular Concrete (LDCC), and other terms is defined as a cement-based slurry, with a minimum of 20% (per volume) foam entrained into the plastic mortar.Foamed Concrete leaflet The Concrete Institute, Midrand, 2013 As mostly no coarse aggregate is used for production of foam concrete the correct term would be called mortar instead of concrete; it may be called \\"foamed cement\\" as well. The density of foam concrete usually varies from 400 kg/m to 1600 kg/m. The density is normally controlled by substituting fully or part of the fine aggregate with foam. Terminology It is also called aircrete, foamed concrete, foamcrete, cellular lightweight concrete or reduced density concrete. History The 1930s-era Smithy bridge used foamed concrete for infilling. The history of foam concrete dates back to the early 1920s and the production of autoclaved aerated concrete, which was used mainly as insulation.Sach J and Seifert H (1999). Foamed concrete technology: possibilities for thermal insulation at high temperatures. CFI Forum of Technology, DKG 76, No. 9, pp 23‚Äì30. A detailed study concerning the composition, physical properties and production of foamed concrete was first carried out in the 1950s and 60s.Valore RC. (1954). Cellular concrete part 1 composition and methods of production, ACI j ;50:773-96.Valore RC. (1954). Cellular RC, Cellular concrete part 2 physical properties. ACI J;50:817-36.Rudnai G. (1963). Lightweight concretes. Budapest, Akademikiado Following this research, new admixtures were developed in the late 1970s and early 80s, which led to the commercial use of foamed concrete in construction projects. Initially, it was used in the Netherlands for filling voids and for ground stabilisation. Further research carried out in the Netherlands helped bring about the more widespread use of foam concrete as a building material.Van Deijk. Foam concrete. Concrete, July/August 1991, pp 49‚Äì54. More recently, foam concrete is being made with a continuous foam generator. The foam is produced by agitating a foaming agent with compressed air to make \\"aircrete\\" or \\"foamcrete\\". This material is fireproof, insect proof, and waterproof. It offers significant thermal and acoustic insulation and can be cut, carved, drilled and shaped with wood-working tools. This construction material can be used to make foundations, subfloors, building blocks, walls, domes, or even arches that can be reinforced with a construction fabric. Manufacturing Foamed concrete typically consists of a slurry of cement or fly ash and sand and water, although some suppliers recommend pure cement and water with the foaming agent for very lightweight mixes. This slurry is further mixed with a synthetic aerated foam in a concrete mixing plant.British Cement Association, Foamed Concrete Composition and Properties, British Cement Association, 1994. The foam is created using a foaming agent, mixed with water and air from a generator. The foaming agent used must be able to produce air bubbles with a high level of stability, resistant to the physical and chemical processes of mixing, placing and hardening. Foamed concrete mixture may be poured or pumped into moulds, or directly into structural elements. The foam enables the slurry to flow freely due to the thixotropic behaviour of the foam bubbles, allowing it to be easily poured into the chosen form or mould. The viscous material requires up to 24 hours to solidify (or as little as two hours if steam cured with temperatures up to 70 ¬∞C to accelerate the process.LithoPore Foamed Concrete Luca Industries International GmbH, Retrieved on 22 January 2015), depending on variables including ambient temperature and humidity. Once solidified, the formed produce may be released from its mold. New application in foam concrete manufacturing is to cut the big size concrete cakes into blocks of different sizes by a cutting machine using special steel wires. The cutting action takes place when concrete is still soft. Properties A sample of foamed concrete used for measurement. Foam concrete is a versatile building material with a simple production method that is relatively inexpensive compared to autoclave aerated concrete. Foam concrete compounds utilising fly ash in the slurry mix is cheaper still, and has less environmental impact. Foam concrete is produced in a variety of densities from 200 kg/m to 1,600 kg/m depending on the application. Lighter density products may be cut into different sizes. While the product is considered a form of concrete (with air bubbles replacing aggregate), its high thermal and acoustical insulating qualities make it a very different application than conventional concrete. Applications Foamed concrete can be produced with dry densities of 400 to 1600 kg/m (25 lb/ft to 100 lb/ft), with 7-day strengths of approximately 1 to 10 N/mm (145 to 1450 psi) respectively. Foam concrete is fire resistant, and its thermal and acoustical insulation properties make it ideal for a wide range of purposes, from insulating floors and roofs, to void filling. It is also particularly useful for trench reinstatement. A few of the applications of foam concrete are: * bridge approaches / embankments * pipeline Abandonment / annular fill * trench backfill * precast blocks * precast wall elements / panels * cast-in-situ / cast-in-place walls * insulating compensation laying * insulation floor screeds * insulation roof screeds * sunken portion filling * trench reinstatement * sub-base in highways * filling of hollow blocks * prefabricated insulation boardsLithoPore‚Ñ¢ Foam Concrete 75 ‚Äì 150 Kg/m Luca Industries International GmbH, Retrieved on 29 March 2016 Trends and development Until the mid-1990s, foam concrete was regarded as weak and non- durable with high shrinkage characteristics. This is due to the unstable foam bubbles resulted in foam concrete having properties unsuitable for producing very low density (Less than 300 kg/m dry density) as well as load bearing structural applications. It is therefore important to ensure that the air entrained into the foamed concrete is contained in stable, very tiny, uniform bubbles that remain intact and isolated, and do not thus increase the permeability of the cement paste between the voids. The development of synthetic-enzyme based foaming agents, foam stability enhancing admixtures and specialised foam generating, mixing and pumping equipment has improved the stability of the foam and hence foam concrete, making it possible to manufacture as light as 75 kg/m density, a density that is just 7.5% of water. The enzyme consists of highly active proteins of biotechnological origin not based on protein hydrolysis.LithoPore‚Ñ¢ True Technology Luca Industries International GmbH, Retrieved on 29 March 2016 In recent years foamed concrete has been used extensively in highways, commercial buildings, disaster rehabilitation buildings, schools, apartments and housing developments in countries such as Germany, USA, Brazil, Singapore, India, Malaysia, Kuwait, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Botswana, Mexico, Indonesia, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Iraq, Egypt and Vietnam. Shock-absorption Foamed concrete has been investigated for use as a bullet trap in high intensity US military firearm training ranges. This work resulted in the product SACON being fielded by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which when worn out, can be shipped directly to metal recycling facilities without requiring the separation of the trapped bullets, as the calcium carbonate in the concrete acts as a flux. The energy absorption capacity of foamed concrete was approximated from drop testing and found to vary from 4 to 15 MJ/m depending on its density. With optimum absorption estimated from a 1000 kg/m moderate density mix at water to cement (w/c) ratios from 0¬∑6 to 0¬∑7.

History Established in 1903, Walberg and Auge started as a drum manufacturing company and a musical instrument repair shop in Worcester Massachusetts. Originally named Taylor & Auge, Bernard Eric \\"Barney\\" Walberg bought a half-interest in the company which until then was a sole proprietorship of A.L. Auge. After Walberg joined Auge on Oct. 3, 1903, they began the manufacture of drums and other musical instruments.Nutt, Charles. (1919). History of Worcester and Its People, Vol. 4. Lewis Historical Publishing Company. p. 677. Google Book Search. Retrieved Jan. 28, 2015. The firm eventually started innovating, designing, and manufacturing drum hardware for W&A; drum sets and other drum companies such as Gretsch, Ludwig, Rogers, Slingerland, Leedy, Camco, and Kent. In 1920, 'The Music Trade Review' blamed Bernard Walberg for his inventions used in the 'Advent of Jazz'. At the time, Mr. Walberg's inventions included the first cow bell holder for the trap kit, first traps table, first CarryAll bass drum, first folding bass drum pedal and many other musical creations necessary for playing the new radical music of jazz. Shortly after this accusation, Walberg and Auge invented and manufactured the first hi-hat stand (based from the low boy/sock cymbal stand W&A; was already making), first triangle holder, first cymbal stand with rubber feet, first tom mount, first drummer's throne, first clamping basket snare stand (Buck Rogers snare stand), first telescopic wire brushes and much more. Walberg & Auge Drums W&A; also made high quality 'Perfection' snare drums and drum sets, mostly using shells supplied by Gretsch and Keller with a variety of Gretsch, Rogers, Ludwig hoops and lugs they received from hardware trades and barters. Brand Reboot In 2014, Walberg and Auge was reestablished as a not-for-profit public-benefit corporation for historical and educational purposes. A website and Facebook page have been launched in addition to the compiling of a comprehensive history of Walberg and Auge which will be available as a book.

Playing career After starting his career in local football with Sheffield YMCA, Bannister signed for Sheffield Wednesday as a 14-year-old schoolboy in 1937. He graduated to amateur status by 1941 but was then called up for World War II service as an 18-year-old. He served in the Royal Air Force for five years until 1946, despite this he did manage to appear as a guest for York City in the Wartime League, making 24 appearances in 1943. Bannister turned professional with Sheffield Wednesday at the start of February 1945 making his debut in a Wartime League game away at Lincoln City that same month. On the resumption of official football for the 1946‚Äì47 season, Bannister found himself out of the first team making only two appearances that season (making his full League debut on Christmas Day 1946 in a 2‚Äì4 away defeat at Bury) and none in the 1947‚Äì48 season as Wednesday struggled to make an impact in Division Two. A switch in positions from left half to left back allowed Bannister to force his way into the first team in the 1949‚Äì50 season. However a bad injury at Newcastle in February 1951 sidelined him until October when he returned to the side as captain to be ever present for the rest of the 1951‚Äì52 season, making 31 League appearances as Wednesday lifted the Division Two championship. The following season in Division One Bannister made only one appearance against Charlton in September 1952 before losing his place to Vin Kenny, that proved to be his final appearance for The Owls and he was transferred to Chesterfield in June 1953 for a fee of ¬£750. Bannister made 17 appearances during his one season with Chesterfield before dropping down to Non-League football in the summer of 1954 to spend four seasons with King's Lynn . At the end of his time with King's Lynn, Bannister was awarded a benefit match in April 1958 against his old club Sheffield Wednesday. Bannister's final two seasons in football were with Cheshire County League side Macclesfield Town, captaining the side to Cheshire Senior Cup success in 1960. After playing Bannister went into insurance after retiring from football in 1960, but in 1961 he returned to football when he was invited to be a coach of Sheffield Wednesday's youth side. He remained a coach a Hillsborough until 1967 when he moved into scouting for new players for the club. When Jack Charlton was appointed Wednesday manager in October 1977, Bannister was appointed as a match analyser and in 1983 he was appointed Sports and Recreation Manager, holding that post until his retirement in 1989. During his retirement he continued to watch Wednesday. He died on 13 March 2012.\\"The Wednesday Boys\\", Jason Dickinson & John Brodie, Pickard Communication, , pages 199, Gives general biography.

It was designed by architect James Birrell and built in 1959. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 November 1996.  History  The Centenary Pool complex was constructed in 1959 by the Brisbane City Council, as its principal contribution to the celebrations marking the centenary of local government in Brisbane, proclaimed a City in October 1859, and the proclamation of the separation of Queensland from New South Wales in December 1859. The complex was designed by Brisbane City Architect James Birrell and his staff, who commenced work on the design in 1957, and was completed in November 1959 at a cost of approximately . The contractor was Brisbane Master Builder, Cyril Porter Hornick. The project was Brisbane's first Olympic standard pool and diving pool complex and, until the construction of the Sleeman Sports Complex at Chandler in 1980, remained Brisbane's principal aquatic sports centre. The inclusion of an up-market restaurant was an innovative concept which raised the status of the complex above that of simply a sports facility. The City Council's choice of a pool complex of Olympic standard, reflected the intense public interest in competitive swimming which had been generated by Australian successes at the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games. Not only was Australia the proud host nation; at the Melbourne Olympics, Australia produced its best performance ever, winning 13 gold medals - 8 in swimming events. Throughout Australia, the popularity of competitive swimming surged, and in the ten years following the Olympics, the Brisbane City Council built seven new public swimming pools. Of these, the Centenary complex was the only one to incorporate diving facilities. The BCC was keen to include a wading pool in the Centenary complex, one of its principal objectives being to provide facilities for children of an early age to be taught to swim. Centenary Pool was the first public pool complex to be designed by the City Architect rather than by the City Engineers. The Langlands Park pool, the first public swimming pool built by the Council since the early 1930s, was completed in 1958 with some involvement from James Birrell, but had been started by the Engineering Department. On a national level, Centenary Pool was an Olympic-size pool similar to the Melbourne and Canberra Olympic Pools constructed in 1955. As a type, all three are significant as constructed either for, or as a direct result of, the Melbourne Olympic Games. James Birrell, Brisbane's City Architect from 1955 to 1961, produced a substantial body of civic work for the Brisbane City Council, including the Wickham Terrace Car Park, the former Toowong Municipal Library Building, Toowong Pool, and various suburban libraries. Of his civic work, the Centenary Pool Complex and the Wickham Terrace Carpark are his most important designs. From 1961 to 1966, Birrell was appointed Architect to the University of Queensland, overseeing the university's second major phase of construction development. His most notable buildings from this period include Union College, the JD Story Administration Building, Staff House and the Agriculture and Entomology Building (the Hartley Teakle building). In 1966 he entered private practice. Birrell had a talent for exploring new and exciting architectural trends, and of translating these to the Brisbane context. This is demonstrated in the design of the Centenary Pool Complex, which is unlike any of Birrell's other work, and is not in the mainstream of modern international style architecture that was being practised in Australia in the 1950s. It is more closely related to the work of Oscar Niemeyer, (one of the principal designers of Brazil's new capital, Brasilia, in the 1950s and 1960s. Like Niemeyer, Birrell attempted to create in the Centenary Pool design a work of art rather than a purely functionalist structure. Like many architects of the 1950s, Birrell experimented with using familiar materials and technology in unfamiliar ways. The most innovative use of material in the Centenary Pool complex was in the structural steel in the restaurant and diving tower. Birrell utilised the skills of Brisbane shipbuilders Evans Deakin and Company to shape the top and bottom beams of the restaurant, and of local steel fabricators Sargeants to bend the steel core of the diving tower. The complex was designed to fit into the slope of the hill overlooking Victoria Park, and little excavation was required. On technical aspects of the pool's construction, such as the size and positioning of the filtration equipment, Birrell worked closely with the Brisbane City Council's Chief Health Officer, James Douglas Mabbett. Underwater floodlighting and observation windows were included in the design, to permit coaches to view their pupils in action from below the surface. These features were highlighted at the official opening of the pool on the evening of 25 November 1959, when the Governor of Queensland, Sir Henry Abel Smith, was treated to an underwater diving display, viewed through the observation window to the diving pool. The initial design of the complex included a landscaped entrance road and carpark to the south of the pool. Queensland subtropical landscape designer Harry Oakman, who was then manager of the BCC's Parks Department, is understood to have been responsible for the landscape design. In 1960 the Centenary Pool complex was selected by the editors of the Melbourne publication Architecture and Arts as one of the top ten buildings in Australia. It was also the sole Queensland entry in the 1961 publication New Buildings in the Commonwealth, Australian material for which was compiled by Robin Boyd. By 2009, the restaurant had been replaced by a gym and medical suites.  Description  The Centenary Pool complex comprises pools (a swimming pool, diving pool with diving boards and wading pool), a grandstand, a single storeyed bath house, and a two-storeyed restaurant and kiosk. These structures sit on a podium which is set into the north-eastern slope of Victoria Park. Constructed in concrete, steel, brick and glass, the elements of the pool form a loose composition of geometric and plastic forms. The complex is modernist- influenced in both design conception and detailing; in particular the buildings are related to the plastic expressionism of modernist architects and artists such as Oscar Niemeyer and Hans Arp. The design of the pool complex was described by the architect in a brochure celebrating the opening of the pool: \\"The pools are arranged in a random manner so the festive air is developed. Pools in line become too regimented for a park setting....The general aesthetic scheme is that of a free form shape pierced with geometric incisions, that is the concourse with the pools in it. ...hovering above this is another free form volume with geometric shapes placed in it, that is the restaurant with access stairs, ceiling lights and the roof terrace\\". (Birrell, 1959) The boundaries of the complex form a fluid rhomboid shape. Within this boundary the pools and buildings relate to a bisecting north-south axis which extends through the park and finishes at the facade of the University of Queensland Mayne Medical School. The axis locates the central concourse. To the east of this concourse is the swimming pool, measuring , whose eastern edge is lined by a stepped concrete grandstand (designed to seat 1200). The diving pool, measuring , is located in the north west corner of the site and has a four-level diving tower to its western end, and single level boards at each end. A round wading pool is located in the south west corner of the site. The bath house comprises a long curved building which hugs the edge of the slope, and is entered via a ramp leading down to a central ticket office. The restaurant, a raised pavilion with curvilinear walls, also sits on axis and overhangs the swimming pool. The restaurant building contains a kiosk at ground level, and is entered via a concrete ramp which arches over the roof of the dressing sheds. The buildings exhibit a combination of sculptural and technical inventiveness in their design and detailing. The curvilinear walls of the restaurant are formed with faceted glazed panels set in circular steel columns. The building has a curved off-centre service core containing open- riser concrete stairs spiralling around a concrete riser duct. The service core merges through the roof of the buildings to give access to a roof terrace via oval-shaped doors. The terrace is encircled by a steel balustrade with continuous horizontal rails. The service core is clad with glazed tiles with diamond motifs. The kiosk at ground level is rendered concrete, and has strip windows, a service counter, and T&G; boarding running under counter height. Internally, the restaurant is a fluid, transparent space, with the kitchen at the centre encircled by a curved wall clad in T&G; boarding. The northern end of the restaurant has a raised round lit floor which has translucent glass panes set in a steel frame. The bath house comprises a series of externally expressed steel portal frames, with a concave rendered concrete masonry wall to the south with obscured glass louvres at high level, a convex brick wall to the north with steel louvres, and a metal deck roof. It contains female dressing areas to the west, male dressing areas to the east, and administration, storage and ticketing areas in the centre, flanked by corridors giving access to the pools. The administration and ticketing areas are timber-lined. The change rooms have ceramic tiled floors, and rows of large concrete benches. The female change room has blue terrazzo partitions, while its male counterpart has grey terrazzo and blue glazed ceramic tiled partitions. Externally the brickwork is left unstruck, to express the plasticity of the material (Kennedy, 1993). The pools and podium area also exhibit considered technical, decorative and sculptural detailing. The main pool has ceramic tiled rounded edging, a scupper channel to absorb waves, and hexagonal ceramic tiled patterns at the ends of the lanes on the floor of the pool. The wading pool is tiled in fluid abstract patterns. The diving boards are supported on splayed concrete columns, from which spring splayed cantilevered platforms, and steel balustrades and stairs with central steel stringers; the diving tower has curved stairs clinging to its northern face. The podium is paved with hexagonal concrete pavers flecked with exposed aggregate, and has raised seating and planting areas with hexagonal concrete edging. The diving pool and main pool have portholes which are accessed via a \\"clubroom\\" below podium level. The complex has complementary \\"modern tropical\\" landscaping around its boundaries. The eastern and southern edges of the complex have domestically-scaled tracts of brightly coloured tropical plantings (for example Acalyphas, Hibiscus, Travellers palms, Aloes). A substantial amount of this landscaping is original. Centenary Pool is sophisticated in its design conception, and inventive in its sculptural and decorative detailing. The original plantings complement the buildings.  Heritage listing  Centenary Pool Complex was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 November 1996 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Centenary Pool complex is historically significant as the Brisbane City Council's principal contribution to the Brisbane and Queensland 1959 centenary celebrations. Its construction also reflects the enormous popularity of competitive swimming in Australia following the successful 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It demonstrates the details, materials, and construction methods of a sculptural variant of Post-War International style. Nationally, Centenary Pool is a significant example of a 1950s Olympic-standard pool and diving pool complex, and can be ranked in importance with the Melbourne and Canberra Olympic pools. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It is sophisticated in its design conception, and inventive in its sculptural and decorative detailing. The original plantings complement the buildings. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. It is sophisticated in its design conception, and inventive in its sculptural and decorative detailing. The original plantings complement the buildings. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Its social significance lies in its contribution to the development of competitive swimming in Brisbane, having been the city's principal aquatic sports centre from 1959 to 1980. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The complex is important as one of the major civic works designed by prominent Queensland architect James Birrell.

It alludes to the Parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins, found in the Gospel of Matthew at 25:1-13, and also to a verse in the Gospel of Luke, at 12:35. The song has been attributed to Blind Willie Johnson, who recorded it in 1928; to Reverend Gary Davis, who recorded it in 1956; and to Mississippi Fred McDowell, who recorded it in 1959. The song has been included in several hymnals.  Lyrics  The song is in call-and-response format. As is common with traditional songs, lyrics vary between performersin this instance, often very widely. A usual first verse is: \\"The world\\" and \\"the time\\" relate to the apocalyptic prophecies of the New Testament. \\"The work\\" can do so also, but suggests that the song may derive from an African-American work song.

During this period he made three lengthy trips to Italy; the last on the occasion of his appointment to the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia. Despite his association with the Bonapartes, he was a staunch Legitimist, resigning all of his offices following the advent of the July Monarchy in 1830 and returning to private life. He continued to exhibit, however, including a show at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1832. Three years later, he published Souvenirs du vieux Paris, exemples d'architecture de temps et de styles divers. He continued to advocate for the Bourbons until his death. He was also known as an avid art collector and promoted many contemporary artists through purchases of their works. Among them were Blondel, Granet and Ingres. His collection included antiquities as well, which he donated to the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts d'Angers. From December 2006 to April 2007, the museum presented a major retrospective of his works, in an effort to make his name known again.

When Danish king Eric opened the Baltic trade routes for Dutch ships and introduced a new toll for all foreign ships passing the √òresund (Sound Dues), six Hanseatic cities (Hamburg, L√ºbeck, L√ºneburg, Rostock, Stralsund, Wismar) declared war, put a naval blockade on Scandinavian harbours and allied with Eric's enemy Henry IV, count of Holstein. Therefore the war was intensively linked with the Dutch‚ÄìHanseatic War (1422/38‚Äì1441), the Kalmar War with Holstein (1409/22‚Äì1435) and the Swedish revolt (1434‚Äì1436). After years of changing fortune in warfare Rostock and Stralsund signed a separate peace agreement in 1430. L√ºbeck, Hamburg, Wismar and L√ºneburg, however, continued the war and assisted Holstein to conquer Flensburg in 1431. Thereafter they agreed an armistice in 1432 and started peace negotiations. Meanwhile an anti-Danish revolt broke out in Sweden (Engelbrekt rebellion). In 1434 Eric had to agree an armistice with the Swedes, too. In April 1435 he signed the peace of Vordingborg with the Hanseatic League and Holstein, followed by the peace of Stockholm with Sweden a few months later the same year. The Hanseatic cities were excepted from the Sound Dues but they had to accept Dutch competition in the Baltic trade. The Danish Duchy of Schleswig was ceded to the count of Holstein. Sweden's autonomous rights and privileges were extended. These peace agreements weakened Eric's position dramatically, and in 1439 he got dethroned by Danish, Swedish and Norwegian Privy Councils.

UK garage gave rise to subgenres such as speed garage and 2-step, and was then largely subsumed into other styles of music and production in the mid-2000s, including bassline, grime and dubstep. The decline of UK garage during the mid-2000s saw the birth of UK funky, which is closely related. Origins The evolution of house music in the United Kingdom in the early to mid-1990s led to the term, as previously coined by the Paradise Garage DJs, being applied to a new form of music known as speed garage. In the early '90s, American DJ Todd Edwards, a pioneer of the speed garage sound, began remixing more soulful house records and incorporating more time-shifts and vocal samples than normal house records, whilst still living in the US. However, it was not until DJ EZ, the North London DJ, acquired one of Edwards' tracks and played it at a faster tempo in a nightclub in Greenwich, that the music genre really took off. In the late '90s, the term \\"UK garage\\" was settled upon by the scene. This style is now frequently combined with other forms of music like soul, rap, reggae, ragga and R&B;, all broadly filed under the description of urban music. The pronunciation of UK garage uses , rather than . Artists such as Craig David, Grant Nelson, MJ Cole, Artful Dodger, Jaimeson, So Solid Crew, Heartless Crew, the Streets, Shanks & Bigfoot, DJ Luck & MC Neat, Sunship (Ceri Evans), Oxide & Neutrino and numerous others have made garage music mainstream in the UK, whilst Dizzee Rascal, Wiley and Kano's arrival raised the profile of grime, an offshoot of garage. Cole once stated, \\"London is a multicultural city... it's like a melting pot of young people, and that's reflected in the music of UK garage.\\" Notable female singers who have had the genre incorporated into their songs include Lisa Maffia, Ms. Dynamite, Kele Le Roc, Shola Ama, Sweet Female Attitude and Mis-Teeq. History =Relationship with jungle= In the United Kingdom, where jungle was very popular at the time, garage was played in a second room at jungle events. After jungle's peak in cultural significance, it had turned towards a harsher, more techstep influenced sound, driving away dancers, predominantly women. Escaping the 170bpm jungle basslines, the garage rooms had a much more sensual and soulful sound at 130bpm. DJs started to speed up garage tracks to make them more suitable for the jungle audience in the UK. The media started to call this tempo-altered type of garage music \\"speed garage\\", 4x4 and 2-step's predecessor. DJs would usually play dub versions (arrangements without vocals) of garage tracks, because pitch-shifting vocals could sometimes render the music unrecognizable (although sped up and time-stretched vocals were an important part of the early jungle sound, and later played a key role in speed garage). The absence of vocals left space in the music for MCs, who started rhyming to the records. =Role of MCs= Since then, MCs have become one of the vital aspects of speed and UK garage parties and records. Early promoters of speed garage included the Dreem Teem and Tuff Jam, and pirate radio stations such as London Underground, Magic FM, Upfront FM, and Freek FM. During its initial phase, the speed garage scene was also known as \\"the Sunday Scene\\", as initially speed garage promoters could only hire venues on Sunday evenings (venue owners preferred to save Friday and Saturday nights for more popular musical styles). Labels whose outputs would become synonymous with the emerging speed garage sound included Confetti, Public Demand, 500 Rekords, Spread Love and VIP. =Speed garage= Speed garage already incorporated many aspects of today's UK garage sound like sub-bass lines, ragga vocals, spin backs and reversed drums. What changed over time, until the so-called 2-step sound emerged, was the addition of further funky elements like contemporary R&B; styled vocals, more shuffled beats and a different drum pattern. The most radical change from speed garage to 2-step was the removal of the 2nd and 4th bass kick from each bar. Although tracks with only two kick drum beats to a bar are perceived as being slower than the traditional four-to-the-floor beat, the listener's interest is maintained by the introduction of syncopating bass lines and the percussive use of other instruments such as pads and strings. Speed garage tracks were characterised by a sped-up house-style beat, complemented by the rolling snares and reverse- warped basslines that were popular with drum and bass producers of the time. Among those credited with honing the speed garage sound, Todd Edwards is often cited as a seminal influence on the UK garage sound. The producer from New Jersey introduced a new way of working with vocals. Instead of having full verses and choruses, he picked out vocal phrases and played them like an instrument, using sampling technology. Often, individual syllables were reversed or pitch-shifted. This type of vocal treatment is still a key characteristic of the UK garage style. Armand Van Helden's speed garage remix of Sneaker Pimps' \\"Spin Spin Sugar\\" in 1997 further popularized the genre which is sometimes credited with breaking speed garage into the mainstream. Huge club hits in 1997 came from speed garage duos Double 99, 187 Lockdown and Industry Standard. The former two both scored UK top 20 hits in 1997 and 1998; Double 99's \\"RipGroove\\" reached #14 in its second release and 187 Lockdown's \\"Gunman\\" and \\"Kung-Fu\\" reached #16 and #9, respectively. Industry Standard scored a top 40 hit with \\"Vol. 1 (What You Want What You Need)\\" peaking at #34 in January 1998, and the 1997 XL Recordings release of Somore featuring Damon Trueitt's \\"I Refuse (What You Want)\\" reached #21 also in January 1998, containing mixes by Industry Standard, Ramsey & Fen, R.I.P. Productions and Serious Danger. The UK's counterpart to Todd Edwards was MJ Cole, a classically trained oboe and piano player, who had a string of chart and underground hits in the late 1990s and early 2000s, most notably with \\"Sincere\\" and \\"Crazy Love\\". MJ Cole has also won a BBC \\"Young Musician of the Year\\" award. =Two-step (1997‚Äì1999)= Arguably one of the earliest examples of a 2-step track is the 1997 Kelly G remix of \\"Never Gonna Let You Go\\" by Tina Moore, which peaked at #7 on the UK chart. Roy Davis Jr. was also influential in the UK garage scene, with the huge club hit \\"Gabriel\\" featuring Peven Everett, released in 1997 on XL Recordings and reaching #22 on the UK chart. Lovestation released their version of \\"Teardrops\\" which reached #14 in 1998. Doolally, the former name of Shanks & Bigfoot, scored a #20 hit in 1998 with \\"Straight from the Heart\\". A re-release of this song the following year fared even better, peaking at #9, due to the success of their #1 single \\"Sweet Like Chocolate\\". Jess Jackson was responsible for many garage records but one which stood out was \\"Hobson's Choice\\". The B-side of this record changed the UK garage scene from funky and soulful to dark and bassy. Another example of the evolution in 2-step was the release of \\"Troublesome\\" in 1999 by Shy Cookie and DJ Luck, in which non-sampled 2-step beats were merged with a full ragga vocal (performed by ragga artist Troublesome). American influences Timbaland, a popular contemporary R&B; producer in America, was the major innovator behind contemporary R&B; at the time, from which UK rave culture borrowed heavily. The use of rhythmic patterns as melodic hooks is shared by both contemporary R&B; and jungle, making it very appealing to the significantly ex-junglist UK garage scene. This style of Timbaland's R&B; possesses a breakbeat aesthetic: breakup of the flow of four-to-the-floor rhythm, hesitations into the groove, and teasing and tantalizing gaps. As much as these R&B; influences can be heard in early UK garage, the genre offered more complex drum beats, with heavy syncopation (swing) and a more energetic feel due to a higher tempo (normally between 130 and 138 BPM). However, in tracks like \\"Twentyfourseven\\" by Artful Dodger, a slower and simpler R&B; infused drum pattern can be heard. This was to allow for these tracks to be aimed at a more commercial scene rather than for the dance floor. Garage producers then proceeded to churn out UK versions of US contemporary R&B; hits, notably with Brandy and Monica's \\"The Boy Is Mine\\". The Architechs sped up the vocals through time-stretching and added sound effects to increase the competitive nature. \\"B&M; Remix\\" eventually sold twenty thousand copies as a bootleg. Also borrowed from US contemporary R&B; is the use of \\"vocal science\\", the technique of digitally altering vocal samples with devices such as the Autotuner. What results is a posthuman mix between person and technology. =1999‚Äì2000: Role of pirate radio, UK chart success= With the continued support of pirate radio stations such as Rinse FM, Ice FM, Deja Vu, and Flex FM, the soaring popularity of UK garage saw 1999 take the genre into the mainstream, breaking into the music charts. Production duos Shanks & Bigfoot and Artful Dodger were very successful with the tracks \\"Sweet Like Chocolate\\" and \\"Re-Rewind\\", respectively. After the platinum-selling success of \\"Sweet Like Chocolate\\", the floodgates had opened. Although \\"Re-Rewind\\" was denied a #1 position by Cliff Richard and his song \\"The Millennium Prayer\\", it was also a platinum seller, one of the garage scene's first and last. They became anthems for the 2-step scene, and got onto BBC's Top of the Pops. Other huge hits in 1999 include the #1 house/garage anthem \\"You Don't Know Me\\" by Armand Van Helden. Although not UK garage, Mr. Oizo's #1 single \\"Flat Beat\\" received extensive airplay on pirate radio stations upon release, thus leading to numerous UK garage/2-step remixes of the track. Da Click (Pied Piper, MC Creed, PSG, Unknown MC and singer Valerie M) had a #14 hit with \\"Good Rhymes\\". Garage trio the Dreem Teem had a #15 hit with \\"Buddy X 99\\", a garage remix of Neneh Cherry's 1992 song \\"Buddy X\\". DJ Luck & MC Neat also had a chart hit with \\"A Little Bit of Luck\\" in late 1999 into early 2000. Many more UK garage acts followed into the new millennium by releasing commercially successful singles, thus making UK garage and 2-step a stable fixture on the UK charts for the next couple of years. Debut singles of various UK garage artists were hitting the number one spot on the UK charts. Craig David's debut solo single \\"Fill Me In\\", a mix of R&B; and 2-step, with single formats containing various garage remixes of the track, hit #1 in April 2000. A month later, Oxide & Neutrino's \\"Bound 4 Da Reload (Casualty)\\" reached the top of the charts. Other top 10 hits in 2000 include Artful Dodger's \\"Movin' Too Fast\\" (#2), \\"Woman Trouble\\" (#6) and \\"Please Don't Turn Me On\\" (#4), Sweet Female Attitude's \\"Flowers\\" (#2), True Steppers' \\"Buggin\\" (#6) and \\"Out of Your Mind\\" (#2), B-15 Project's \\"Girls Like Us\\" (#7), DJ Luck & MC Neat's \\"Masterblaster 2000\\" (#5) and \\"Ain't No Stoppin' Us\\" (#8), MJ Cole's \\"Crazy Love\\" (#10), Wookie's \\"Battle\\" (#10), Lonyo's \\"Summer of Love\\" (#8), Architechs' \\"Body Groove\\" (#3) and Oxide & Neutrino's \\"No Good 4 Me\\" (#6). Another huge hit in 2000 was the Timo Maas remix of the song \\"Dooms Night\\" (#8) by German producer Azzido Da Bass, which was heavily associated with UK garage at the time, having become a major club hit and appearing on several UK garage compilations. It was also remixed by garage duo Stanton Warriors. =2001 hits= 2001 gave DJ Pied Piper and the Masters of Ceremonies their one and only number one hit record with \\"Do You Really Like It?\\". Two months later in August 2001, South London collective So Solid Crew hit the top spot with their second single \\"21 Seconds\\". The end of 2001 saw yet another 2-step anthem reach the top of the UK charts for Daniel Bedingfield, with his debut single \\"Gotta Get Thru This\\". Other top 10 hits in 2001 include the Sunship mixes of Mis-Teeq's \\"Why\\" (#8), \\"All I Want\\" (#2) and \\"One Night Stand\\" (#5), Artful Dodger's \\"TwentyFourSeven\\" (#6), Liberty's \\"Thinking It Over\\" (#5), Oxide & Neutrino's \\"Up Middle Finger\\" (#7) and So Solid Crew's \\"They Don't Know\\" (#3). =2002: 2-step and grime= 2002 saw an evolution as 2-step moved away from its funky and soul-oriented sound into a darker direction called \\"grime\\", now a genre in its own right. During this period, traditional UK garage was pushed back underground amongst the bad publicity emanating from the tougher side of the genre, and publicised violence surrounding members of the So Solid Crew. Nonetheless, several UK garage songs did appear on the charts from 2002 to 2004, including Heartless Crew's \\"The Heartless Theme\\" (#21), Distant Soundz' version of \\"Time After Time\\" (#20), So Solid Crew's \\"Ride wid Us\\" (#19) and \\"Haters\\" (#8), Ladies First's version of \\"I Can't Wait\\" (#19), Pay As U Go's \\"Champagne Dance\\" (#13), Mr Reds vs DJ Skribble's \\"Everybody Come On (Can U Feel It)\\" (#13), Mis-Teeq's \\"B with Me\\" (#5), Jaimeson's \\"True\\" (#4) and 3 of a Kind's \\"Baby Cakes\\" which was a number one hit in August 2004. Notable early grime artists around 2001‚Äì03 include Ruff Sqwad, More Fire Crew, Dizzee Rascal (who released his debut album Boy in da Corner in 2003), Roll Deep and Wiley. During this time, there was also a strong division of class in UK garage. In the heyday of garage, the late 1990s, it was a highly aspirational genre. When people went to the club to hear garage, they dressed stylish and smart. Clubs like Twice as Nice enforced a dress code. Having a formal dress code took the importance placed on nice clothes from a style to exclusionary. The dress code in clubs like Twice as Nice were meant to \\"encourage people to make an effort\\" and \\"keep trouble out.\\" But when the dress code of no tennis shoes, jeans, or baseball caps only kept white college students out, the club installed a metal detector, because \\"gangstas like to dress expensive,\\" but theoretically could still carry a gun. Eventually, when groups like So Solid Crew attracted more urban, lower-class audiences to raves because of their lyrics over the garage tracks, garage began to transition to grime because previous audiences were less likely to listen, so radios and clubs stopped giving garage opportunities. =2007: Garage revival= In 2007, several DJs helped promote and revive UK garage's popularity, with producers creating new UK garage, also known as \\"new skool\\" UK garage or \\"bassline\\". The end of 2007 saw \\"new skool\\" UK garage push to the mainstream again with notable tracks such as T2's \\"Heartbroken\\" and H \\"Two\\" O's \\"What's It Gonna Be\\" both reaching the mainstream charts. The revival was galvanised by DJ EZ releasing Pure Garage Rewind: Back to the Old Skool, which contained three CDs of \\"old skool\\" UK garage and a fourth CD with fresh \\"new skool\\" UK garage. =2010s resurgence= Early 2011 saw the start of a gradual resurgence of 2-step garage. Producers such as Wookie, MJ Cole, Zed Bias and Mark Hill (formerly one half of Artful Dodger) made a return to the scene, by producing tracks with more of a 2-step feel. Electronic music duos Disclosure and AlunaGeorge, both successful throughout 2012 and 2013, often use elements of UK garage in their music, and arguably, some of their biggest hits including \\"You & Me\\" and \\"We Are Chosen\\" respectively, are entirely 2-step with an updated cleaner sound. Shortly following this, \\"original\\" style garage had made a return in a big way, with producers such as Moony, DJD and Tuff Culture paving the way. One of the genre's pioneering labels, Ice Cream Records, responsible for anthems such as \\"RipGroove\\", True Steppers' \\"Out of Your Mind\\", Kele Le Roc's \\"My Love\\" and more, opened up their permanent roster for the first time to include DJs outside of the legendary trio that launched the label. AJ Tracey's song \\"Ladbroke Grove\\" initially debuted at number 48 on the UK Singles Chart in February 2019, then eventually peaked at number three in October 2019 following its release as a single. In September 2019, the British Phonographic Industry certified the song as Platinum for exceeding chart sales of 600,000. It was one of the best-selling songs of 2019. Other hits in the 2010s include Toddla T's \\"Take It Back\\", All About She's \\"Higher (Free)\\", Naughty Boy's \\"La La La\\", Shift K3Y's \\"Touch\\", Chase & Status' \\"Blk & Blu\\", M.O's \\"Dance On My Own\\", Disclosure's \\"Omen\\" and Craig David's \\"When the Bassline Drops\\" and \\"One More Time\\". Genres evolved from garage =Dubstep= The dark garage sound that was being produced by the likes of Wookie, Zed Bias, Shy Cookie, El-B and Artwork (of DND) in the late 1990s would set the groundwork for both grime and dubstep. Developing in parallel to grime, dubstep would take a mostly instrumental stripped down form of dark garage and with it bring in production values and influences from dub reggae. =UK funky= Some UK garage/dubstep/grime/bassline producers have moved to a different sound called UK funky, which takes production values from many different shades of soulful house music with elements of UK garage and blends them at a standard house music tempo, and soca with tribal style percussion from afrobeat. =Future garage= A contemporary offshoot of dubstep heavily influenced by UK garage is future garage.

Angel. Music. Baby. (2004). It was released on November 12, 2004, along with the rest of the aforementioned album by Interscope Records. The track was written by Stefani and her No Doubt bandmate, Tony Kanal. The latter also produced the song with Mark \\"Spike\\" Stent, who Stefani and Kanal previously worked with on No Doubt's fifth studio album, Rock Steady (2001). \\"Serious\\" is a synth-pop song with lyrics pertaining to a strong romantic interest in a significant other. \\"Serious\\" received generally positive reviews from music critics upon release and was frequently compared to the works of both early Madonna and Kylie Minogue, particularly Minogue's track, \\"Fever\\". The song was also received well for its mirror production to '80s songs, with additional praise for being \\"catchy\\". An accompanying music video for the recording was filmed in Los Angeles but never released; however, a low-quality clip of the video surfaced on YouTube in 2006. Stefani performed the track on her 2005 Harajuku Lovers Tour during the encore of the show, where she danced with the Harajuku Girls in nurse costumes.  Background and composition  \\"Serious\\" was compared to songs by Madonna from the early 1980s. In early 2003, Stefani began embarking on recording sessions for her debut album. After listening to songs recommended to her by No Doubt bassist and former boyfriend Tony Kanal, she considered recording material that \\"modernized 1980s music\\". After writing a series of several songs, including \\"Serious\\", \\"Crash\\", and \\"Luxurious\\", the pair gave up after Stefani didn't find anything worth recording from the sessions. When asked about the aforementioned collaborations, Stefani expressed her doubts of whether or not her newly recorded material would be any good: \\"If I were to write the chorus of 'Yesterday' by the Beatles, and that's all I wrote, that would be good enough to be part of that history.\\" Due to Stefani's doubts, the project began a six- month hiatus, which resulted in the singer deciding to collaborate with various new musicians instead. Stefani's change of heart also ensured her work with Kanal would end up on Love. Angel. Music. Baby.. \\"Serious\\" takes influence from the \\"'80s style\\" and dance music genres, which in turn drew frequent comparisons to the works of Madonna and Club Nouveau. It contains a string melody alongside a synthpop rhythm. Opening with \\"an orchestral [...] before diving into a Prince-ready bumping drum beat and ambient synth\\", Stefani sings: \\"I think I'm coming down with something / I think I'm gonna need your medicine\\" in a provocative tone. The use of cri de coeur is also present. Hazel Cills from Vice found the aforementioned lyric reminiscent of Carol Douglas' 1974 cover of \\"Doctor's Orders\\". In between different exclamations \\"centered around Stefani's manic love\\", she also announces \\"breathy, vaudeville 'Oohs' and 'Yeahs'\\". Theon Weber of Spin described the composition: \\"'Serious' carved out a bittersweet niche that applied loping ska upstrokes to new-wave synth washes and blurred warm feelings about lovers into warm feelings about the synth-pop era.\\"  Critical reception  Upon release, the song received generally positive reviews from music critics. Many reviewers noted similarities to works of early Madonna and Kylie Minogue, with the song being compared to several of the singers' songs. Jason Damas from PopMatters praised the track for being \\"a sure contender for future single release\\", in addition to calling it his \\"favorite song on the album\\". He further added: \\"No Doubt fans who always secretly suspected that Stefani may someday move to become a Madonna-like dance diva will find their proof in this cut, which plagiarizes Kylie Minogue's \\"Fever\\" but makes the song even bigger and catchier.\\" Winnie McCroy of The Villager claimed that \\"Serious\\" has staying power; he continued: \\"Despite your best attempts to shake it, you will find yourself humming the chorus\\", later comparing the track to Madonna's 1992 single \\"Erotica\\", and Falco's 1985 single \\"Rock Me Amadeus\\". Also in a highly positive review, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine favored \\"Serious\\" for \\"flawlessly recreat[ing] the throwaway lyrics, vocal phrasing and background vocals, and synth sounds of the '80s\\". A critic from Sputnikmusic awarded the recording five out of a five stars, calling it \\"one of the better songs on the album\\". The reviewer noted Kanal's role in the song's production: \\"this song wouldn't be that wonderful without him\\". Another highly positive review came from Marcus Floyd from Renowned for Sound; in his review of the parent record, he called it \\"another catchy melody and addictive arrangement from the platinum blonde star\\". Lisa Haines, a music editor and columnist for BBC, was less favorable in her review, opining that \\"the cheeky upstart charm Madonna sported in the 80s is embraced to shrewd effect\\" for the track's duration.  Promotion  = Music video = A music video was produced for the song, but it was never officially released. Stefani's long time collaborator, Sophie Muller, directed the music video during Gwen's first concert tour entitled Harajuku Lovers Tour. A minute long clip of the video surfaced on YouTube on October 13, 2006. At the beginning of the clip, Stefani and her dance troupe, the Harajuku Girls, are shown dancing on various rooftops in a city. The women also appear in front of a yellow building advertisement that reads \\"Cash Loan\\" in a red font, followed by \\"Buy ¬∑ Sell ¬∑ Trade\\" in a green font below. The ladies sport \\"'80s hairstyles\\", to which a critic from Spin predicted was in an attempt \\"to rival some of the best videos from two decades ago\\". Other parts of the video display the dancers wearing jumpsuits or camouflage outfits; Stefani also wears a denim skirt or a pair of white shorts with a matching tank top. The clip was featured in a list compiled by VH1's Christopher Rosa, titled \\"8 Amazing Unreleased Music Videos That We Really Need To See\\". Rosa noted that the video \\"is now virtually unfindable on the Web\\", and was disappointed by stating: \\"We wanted some Madonna realness, Gwen!\\" = Live performances = Stefani included the song on the setlist for her 2005 concert tour entitled Harajuku Lovers Tour. The track was performed as a finale/encore alongside \\"Bubble Pop Electric\\" during the original setlist of the show, but was performed earlier in later shows as \\"Hollaback Girl\\" became the new encore, preceded by \\"Serious\\" and the aforementioned song. Archived at Jam! on November 17, 2005. In the performance, Stefani was carried out in a stretcher by the Harajuku Girls, dressed up as nurses.

He is most famous for his mosaic of the New South Wales Contingent produced in 1885 which represents the soldiers returned from the war in Sudan. Personal life Wombat Hill, Daylesford, 1855, by B.C.Boake, albumen silver stereograph Barcroft was born in Dublin, Ireland on 12 November 1838. Boake migrated after seeking advice from his cousin, a Rev. at Holy Trinity Church, Balaclava, Victoria. He moved to Melbourne, Victoria in the 1850s, and then moved on to live in Sydney in 1858. He arrived with some experience and knowledge of photography and worked at Freeman's studio in Sydney for many years. While in Sydney he married Florence Eva Clark in 1865. He settled in Sydney working in his own photographic studio at 330 George St, Sydney up until 1866, when he then declared bankruptcy and moved to Daylesford, Vic. He spent the rest of his life there until his death at the age of 83, February 1921. Although struggling with personal life tragedies and economic worries he was one of the most successful and popular professional photographers of the latter half of the 19th century. He did however spend the last 30 years of his life in obscurity. B.C.Boake fathered a son in 1866, Barcroft Henry Thomas Boake was born in Balmain, Sydney, on 26 March. Boake Junior was born the year B.C.Boake left Freeman's studio. He was a talented poet that left home at the age of 17, struggling with bouts of depression. In 1892, during the year of the bank crisis, Barcrot Boake junior was found dead. He had returned home to his father, who was bankrupt. At this stage not much was left to salvage in B.C.Boake's life. His wife had died a number of years prior, now his son. He had daughters that were now married and living away from his home that had been sold. Also his studio and all other possessions were now lost, sold to creditors due to his bankruptcy. This is when he decided to live his life in a quiet and small town, Daylesford, Victoria. He opened a small one man studio and worked their for many years. His life ended in an accident, while smoking a pipe he fell asleep and his beard caught on fire, and he burned to death. Photography career Untitled, 1867-1877, by B.C.Boake, carte de visiteUntitled, 1867-1877, by B.C.Boake, carte de visite After migrating to Australia, Barcroft Capel Boake spent majority of his working life in Sydney. He had a hugely successful business. Owning and running his own studio on George St, where he explored the streets and buildings of Sydney through his wet plate work. These outdoor prints would be sold as whole albums. His most successful works are of his male subjects. However his images of women and children were collected in albums, as the small delicately coloured prints are considered the best of that period and time of portrait photography. The highly persevered state of his prints suggest that people of the time went to Boake for charming miniatures. He volunteered as a captain in the 7th Battery of New South Wales Voluntary Artillery. Here Boake made his most famous work, the mosaic of the returning New South Wales contingent that fought in the Sudan campaign of 1890. Capel practiced in many different photographic printing and developing techniques. The heliograph and the instantaneous process were ways Boake was able to maintain the fine art quality of his execution. The competitors from other local studios moved to larger prints, while Boake maintained his artistic reputation, working on finer photographs. Barcroft was also often seen using, a carte de visite, which is 10 x 6.4 cm stiff card, with a paper photograph attached, invented in 1854 by Andr√©- Adolphe-Eug√®ne Disderi. New South Wales Contingent mosaic N.S.W Contingent Mosaic, 1885 In 1885, the greatest mosaic of the nineteenth century was made by Barcroft Capel Boake. The mosaic was made during the return from war in Sudan, of the New South Wales Contingent. Portraits of the men of war were placed and stuck onto a black and gilt banner. The photographs of the men were arranged in a swirl around the main expedition leaders. Some say they resemble the rings of Saturn. The mosaic measured 175 centimetres tall by 200 centimetres wide. This was the finest hour in Boake's career as a photographer. The portraits and group portraits were created at the return of the New South Wales, Australian Contingent. Soon after they arrived home Boake began his work with the soldiers, the Colonial and Indian Exhibition featured the photographic portraits and work. Many hundreds of copies were sold as keepsakes and art. Recently a canvas banner was rediscovered with a giant version of the print on it. It was rediscovered at the Australian War Memorial. The existence of this copy and slightly different versions of the photographic mosaic, suggest another banner might be in existence somewhere waiting to be discovered. An article was published in the Sydney Morning Herald, in the \\"News of the Day\\" header. The mosaic was planned to be used to preserve the memory of the members of the New South Wales Contingent.

The government of Victoria engaged him to photograph the Yan Yean Waterworks for the Colonial and Indian Exhibition in London. Kruger gained commissions from house owners to photograph their homes, most famous of which was from Lady Loch, the wife of the Governor. Kruger made three visits to the Queenscliff region in 1881, 1882 and 1885, capturing views to include the buildings of the settlement and its marine setting.

Large holdings of his work have been showcased at the National Gallery of Victoria. Projects and exhibitions Kruger's work has been showcased all over the world. One of his most famous pieces of work was the very first group photo of the Aboriginal cricket team, this piece of work was named \\"Aboriginal Cricketers of Coranderrk\\", taken in 1866. He had also taken portraits at his studio of the three managers of the Aboriginal cricket team. Kruger concentrated on landscape photographs, a comprehensive exhibition of which, Fred Kruger: Intimate Landscapes, was held at the Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia from 4 February to 8 July 2012, featuring over 100 prints of towns, buildings and streets familiar to present-day Victorians; the Esplanade at Queenscliff, Point Lonsdale and the You Yangs, amongst other locations around Victoria. Kruger's expansive but richly detailed views provide visual data on the social and political standards of Victoria in the mid to late 1800s. This collection of images displays how the Europeans changed the environment in imposing their culture while also preserving a sense of the natural picturesque.

She began her career in Sydney, and later made her way to London. She was a set designer, and also made backgrounds and portraits. Early life Her father was a cartoonist by the name of William John (Will) Donald. When Margot was thirteen, she received her first Brownie camera from her father, and she quickly developed an interest in photography. The work produced by the Hobberts studios had been described by Sydney Ure Smith, editor of the Home and Art in Australia, as chic and smart advertising... typical of the rapid growth and sophistication of commercial photography studios at the time. Career =1939‚Äì1946= She began work in 1939 as a junior colourist in the Russell Roberts Advertising Studio, Sydney. She moved to Falk Studios (founded by Walter Barnett) in 1942. =1947‚Äì1949= In 1940s returning servicemen reclaimed many of the traditional male roles within the workforce, although Donald kept her place at Russell Roberts until 1949. Whilst she was there she gained exposure and recognition for her commercial photography work. Her work can be seen in Australian Photography (1947), Photograms of the Year (1947) and Contemporary Photography (1949). In the 1940s Donald traveled to England, where she was employed at American Lintas Advertising Studios.

He was an Australian photographer but also created drawings, portraits and visual art. He is best known for his photographic portraits of the five surviving Oyster Cove Aboriginal people taken in August 1866 and exhibited at the Intercolonial Exhibition of Australasia colonial exhibition in Melbourne the same year.  Life  Woolley and his elder brother were the sons of Joseph William Woolley (1797‚Äì1880) and Frances n√©e Facy. Joseph was a cabinetmaker who worked in a studio next to his father's upholstery and carpet warehouse. The studio was on 42 Macquarie Street. Charles Woolley was married twice. The first of his two marriages took place on 19 July 1866 to Ada, the eldest daughter of C. H. Huxtable of Elphinstone Road, Hobart Town. Woolley's second marriage came almost a decade later on 13 July 1876 to Harriett Elizabeth the second daughter of George Burn of Hobart Town. He died in 1922 in Hobart Town.  Works  From 1859 to 1870, he worked in a studio in Macquarie Street in Hobart generating various portraits as well as In his early work he used wet-plate to photograph Hobart and surrounding areas producing stereotypes. When Woolley travelled he did not take a darkroom tent with him to the forests. Instead he scavenged caravans and travelled regularly to produce wet-plate landscapes. One of his typical photographs was a Tasmanian shot \\"Rocking Stone, on Mount Wellington\\" (1859) a stereograph which was printed in sepia on an 8in. X 7in. (71mm. X 68mm.) stereo card, was included in Alfred Abbott's Album of views of Hobart, Launceston and Victoria. A Woolley photo, Rocking Stone on Mt. WellingtonAnother wet-plate image, \\"The Old Theological Institute\\" was taken around the 1860s in Hobart Town, and can be found in the Archives Office of Tasmania. A woodcut made from his picture \\"Government House, Hobart Town\\" appeared in the Illustrated Melbourne Post in 1864. Woolley, like most photographers of the day, took primarily portrait photographs. Numerous examples are extant including some overpainted with watercolours. According to Henry Button, Henry Dowling 's portrait of Sir Richard Dry, in the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery, Launceston, Tasmania, was painted in England from a Woolley photograph. Less typical examples of his work include the seven published photographs Woolley took of four tableaux vivants designed and produced by Louisa Anne Meredith at Government House, Hobart Town, on 18 January 1866. A Thomas Wingate also took a photograph and all eight were published later that year as an album: Souvenir of the Masques of Christmas, and of the Old and New Year. He also worked with Louisa Anne Meredith on the \\"First Tableau, left group\\" 1866. In his work \\"Second Tableau ‚Äì Right Group\\" four men and a woman represent Australian industry: a gold-digger, vine-grower, reaper, and a shearer and gleaner. While most of Woolley‚Äôs photographs illustrate aspects of the festive season in the antipodes, he was one of the photographers appointed to photograph the Duke of Edinburgh's visit to Hobart Town in 1868. In August 1866, Woolley took photographic portraits in his studio of the five surviving Oyster Cove Aboriginal people which became his best known work. These were exhibited at the Intercolonial Exhibition of Australasia colonial exhibition in Melbourne later that year. Two of the portraits were of Truganini, a female, and William Lanne, also known as King Billy. William Lanne These works are now exhibited in the National Library, and the State Libraries of New South Wales, Tasmania and Victoria. James Bonwick's publication The Last of the Tasmanians (1870) included several of the photographs and shortly after engravings started to appear. Woolley exhibited the prints again in 1875 at the Victorian Intercolonial Exhibition. A few of the original sets survive, mainly in English collections, as well as copies that J. W. Beattie made. After Lanne‚Äôs death in 1869, his grave was desecrated and his body mutilated and a full sized bust was produced by an artist named Francisco Sant√©. The Evening Mail advertised that it could be seen for a \\"small fee\\". Though Woolley was not known as a sculptor, the Hobart Town Examiner reported that \\"numerous\\" busts he had produced were at Walch and Sons and Birchall‚Äôs bookshops. As Charles Woolley photographed Aboriginal people of differenet nations he highlighted the details of how each was different, mainly anatomically. Woolley's \\"Trugannini\\" was produced as an engraving in the Atlas, the vignette form it took provided a visual metaphor for the fading out of the Tasmanian Aboriginal people.

Life Brancaccio was born in Naples around 1560. In 1584 he renounced his inheritance and joined the Order of Malta. In 1589 he entered Spanish Habsburg service as captain of an infantry company. Apart from a brief stint as sergeant major of a regiment of Italian infantry in the Long Turkish War, he served the Habsburgs for the rest of his life. In 1602 he joined the Army of Flanders, as Maestre de Campo of an infantry regiment he had raised. Taking ship from Flanders for Spain to convoy Spanish infantry, he was captured en route by an English naval squadron. He was released and returned to Naples in 1603. By 1604 he was back in Flanders, and was appointed to the Council of War in Brussels. After the signing of the Twelve Years' Truce between the Habsburgs and the Dutch Republic, he returned to Naples and became a member of the Collateral Council. He wrote a military treatise, I Carichi militari, dedicated to Albert VII, Archduke of Austria, which was first printed in Antwerp by Joachim Trognaesius (1610), and went through further editions in Milan (1620) and Venice (1641). Brancaccio became an inspector of fortifications for the Viceroy of Naples, the Duke of Osuna. With the recommencement of war in Flanders in 1621, Brancaccio returned there. In 1623, in recognition of his services to the Spanish monarchy, Philip IV of Spain created him Marquess of Montesilvano. In 1626 he became maestro di campo generale of the Genoese forces in their conflict with Savoy over the Marquisate of Zuccarello. From 1627 to 1630 he was in Spain as an adviser to the Council of War in Madrid. He returned to Italy in 1630 to command forces in the War of the Mantuan Succession, and when that war was settled by treaty in 1631 he travelled to Flanders for a fourth time. He commanded the garrison defending Maastricht during the siege of 1632. In that year or the following Philip IV named him a councillor of state. In 1633 he travelled via Lombardy to Barcelona. Given command of the army of Roussillon (then part of the Crown of Aragon), he died at Perpignan in December 1637.

She has been an exhibiting artist since the 1980s, is a part of many collections, and has won multiple awards for her work. Phillips resides in Sydney and is a senior lecturer at The College of Fine Arts, University of New South Wales. Biography Debra Phillips was born in Melbourne, Australia, in 1958. In 1977, Phillips relocated to Sydney, Australia, to start a Dip. Art at Sydney College of the Art, University of Sydney, NSW. Starting in the 1980s, her works have been a part of many solo and group exhibitions across Australia, totalling in 54 exhibitions. Still residing in Sydney today, Phillips is a senior lecturer at The College of Fine Arts, University of New South Wales. Work and publications Debra Phillips was one of the women artists of the 1980s and early 1990s. Her work encapsulates her personal interests in questioning different forms of representation histories and identity. Recurring themes throughout her work include disappearance and obsolesce, contemporary life and utilising photography as a structure of representation and how it supposedly shows a true perception of the real world. Her work represents a collapse of time into the present. It is self- consciously aesthetic, this allows the viewer to think if the images resist becoming just surface appearances and if they invite fear of depth/deeper meanings. Phillips is represented in private, national, and international collections. Her work has been published in numerous places including: Twelve Australian Photo Artists (Blair French and Daniel Palmer, Sydney: Piper Press, 2009) and in Look: Contemporary Australian Photography Since 1980 (Anne Marsh, Melbourne: MacMillan Art Publishing, 2010).

Each photograph in the series features a large X that crosses the image.

She is best known for her photo compositions. Her 1991 series Patterns of Connection is widely recognised and has been exhibited both in Australia and overseas. King-Smith‚Äôs work was exhibited in ‚ÄòThe Thousand Mile Stare: A Photographic Exhibition‚Äôhttps://www.accaonline.org.au/exhibition/thousand- mile-stare at the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art, Melbourne. Her early work mainly explored the ideas of identity and how it can shift throughout time.  Early life  King-Smith was born in Gympie, Queensland. Having an indigenous mother and a white father stirred an interest in King-Smith to explore in her photography issues concerning cultural discord.  Education  In 1986, King-Smith completed a Bachelor of Fine Arts, majoring in Photography, at Victoria College in Melbourne. King-Smith went on to complete a Master of Arts by research at the Queensland University of Technology in 2001King-Smith, Leah (2001) Reading the reading : an exegesis on \\"traces... vestiges... energies... a relic... landmark... stage: New Farm Powerhouse Project\\".

PhD thesis, Queensland University of Technology. https://eprints.qut.edu.au/16321/  Photography career  King-Smith began exhibiting in 1985, while studying for her undergraduate degree, and has continued to exhibit regularly. In 1988 her work was exhibited in group exhibition The Thousand Mile Stare: A Photographic Exhibition at the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art, Melbourne in 1988. King-Smith's Patterns of Connection (1991) was exhibited at the Victorian Centre of Photography,http://trove.nla.gov.au/people/499560?c=people Melbourne and the Australian Centre of Photography, Sydney in 1992. King-Smith is most well known for this series, Patterns of Connection, which began when she was presented with two grants by the Stegley Foundation.http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/ark:/99166/w6v49cd9 The grant was given through the Koori Oral History Program for King-Smith to make a picture book of hundred photographs for the nineteenth-century Aboriginal people, which were taken by European photographers. However, the project took a different turn as King-Smith felt so moved by the portraits, she felt the need to make it more personally engaging. King-Smith decided to go about this by creating 'photo-compositions', which are artworks that combine the photographs from the nineteenth century with her own photographs in colour of the Victorian landscape and paint. This new turn in the project repositioned Aboriginal people to be seen in a more positive light and in a spiritual and living domain. Landscape and figure were brought together in these works to showcase how important landscape is to the Aboriginal people, in addition to removing the negative connotations of confinement and control presented in the original photographs. Duncan King-Smith (King-Smith's partner) is a sound designer who accompanied the works with a soundscape recording of the Australian bush, which was used to create a more engaging experience. The series was widely exhibited and toured with various exhibitions not only around Australia, but internationally to places such as the United Kingdom and North America. In 1998, King-Smith was selected for inclusion in the exhibition In the Realm of Phantoms ‚Äì Photographs of the Invisible at the Museum Abteiberg, M√∂nchengladbach, Germany. In 1997 and 1999 she was also selected for inclusion in the exhibitions Metamorphosis and Beyond Myth - Oltre il Mito, part of the Venice Biennales. She has created several visual artworkshttps://eprints.qut.edu.au/view/person/King- Smith,_Leah.html#group_creative=5Fwork as part of her practice-led research, and has been regularly exhibiting in solo and group exhibitions since 1985. In the lead-up to the 2006 Commonwealth Games (held in Melbourne), King-Smith was given a commission by the National Portrait Gallery to create four portraits. These portraits were to be of indigenous athletesKing-Smith, Leah (2006) Athletes series.

Her work is held across Australia in collections including the National Gallery of Victoria, National Gallery of Australia, the State Library of Victoria, Art Gallery of New South Wales and other public galleries. Her artworks are also in private collections, as well as in some international collections.  Academic career  King-Smith's focus is particularly driven by change for equity and cultural competence in teaching and learning, as well as the encouragement of cultural perspectives in practice-led research. King-Smith has an extensive career as a photo and digital media artist, encompassing solo, collaborative and group exhibitions, community engagement, dance performances, theatre productions, international cultural exchanges, book covers, story illustration and experimental film & video work. Her current practice includes 3D animation technologies within a trans-disciplinary collaborative praxis.

From 1964 to 1985 he was a guitarist and singer for The Cats, and since 1968 the lead singer for all the singles of this band. He released a first solo album in 1975 but started his solo career definitely in 1987 after The Cats broke up for the last time. During his career, Veerman received more than thirty gold records.  Biography  Veerman was born in the fishing village of Volendam. His father played many instruments, like recorder, harmonica, guitar, banjo and sitar, and taught his son to play music. His mother was a painter and taught her son to paint. At an age of twelve the young Piet obtained his first guitar. At that time he didn't know if he wanted to choose art or music.Michel Veerman en Johan Tol, One way wind: de geschiedenis van de palingsound, 1999, , pages 74-81 Together with his cousin Jaap Schilder, they performed as the Everly Kosters. This name was formed by De Koster, the nickname of their family, with a reference to The Everly Brothers who were immensely popular during their youth. However, the greatest influence for them came from The Hi- Lo's.Jip Golsteijn, De Cats, een Hollands succesverhaal, October 1973, reprint in 2008, A dance teacher and promoter of local music groups at that time was Jan Buijs, nickname Spruit, not to be confused with the later artist manager of The Cats with the same name, nicknamed Tuf. Due to Spruit the duo was introduced to Arnold M√ºhren and Cees Veerman, that were members of his band Electric Johnny & The Skyriders. = The Cats = The Cats on Schiphol before their departure to Indonesia, 1971 Shortly afterwards they formed The Mystic Four, which was renamed to The Blue Cats and subsequently to The Cats. From the release of the single Times Were When (1968) Piet Veerman became the lead singer for basically all the singles of The Cats. Up to 1974 it was the most popular Dutch band in the country. They became popular in Belgium, Germany, Indonesia and Suriname as well. In 1974 the band broke up for the first time.Dutch Pop Institute, Music Encyclopedia, The Cats - biography In 1975, The Cats reunited but record company EMI gave them the opportunity to record their own solo albums. Piet Veerman recorded an album and a single, both called Rollin' On A River. The single landed on number 9 of the Dutch Top 40.Dutch Pop Institute, Music Encyclopedia, Piet Veerman - biography The Cats were also successful again, although not as big as several years earlier. Piet Veerman continued to be their lead singer until the band broke up for the second time in 1980. He again released a solo album, called Back To You, and the single Living To Love You. In 1981 he wrote the guitar intro of a song called Mooi Volendam of the band Canyon, which became a classic song in the course of years. In 1983 The Cats reunited for the third time, until they split definitely in 1985. = Solo career = Piet Veerman at the presentation of his biography, 2008 Veerman took up a solo career and in 1987 he released his single \\"Sailin' Home\\". The single became a major success, charting number 1 in the Netherlands and Belgium and number 4 in Austria.Dutch Charts, Sailin' home In the Netherlands it was the biggest selling single of the year of 1987. The same year he achieved a number 7 hit with \\"Walking Together\\"Dutch Top 40, Piet Veerman - Walking Together and in the following years ten more singles reached the Dutch charts.Dutch Charts, Piet Veerman He continued releasing singles until 1993. More than ten albums reached the charts and several received a gold status. Further on in his career he experimented with reggae and soul music, including some covers of Willy DeVille such as his single Heaven Stood Still. His successes weren't as great as at the beginning of his solo career though. Later he recorded singles and albums that were partly in Spanish and that were influenced by Latin pop and Tex Mex. He also co-operated with other musicians from Volendam. In 1993 he recorded a duet with Anny Schilder, the former vocalist of BZN. Together with Jan Smit and George Baker in 2002 he recorded an album in German, called Die Goldenen Stimmen (The Golden Voices). He also played as a guest musician on albums, such as in 2006 on A Wink At The Moon of guitarist and singer-songwriter Specs Hildebrand. In 2014 he recorded the single Lovin' Arms with vocalist Mell (ful name; Mellanie Jonk), granddaughter and contester on Voice of Holland .Groot Waterland, Mell & Piet Veerman ‚ÄúLovin‚Äô Arms‚Äù, 29 August 2014 He continued to support Mell who has since become the frontlady of Mell & Vintage Future; for health reasons he has limited performing to special occasions. = Awards = In his career, Veerman received more than thirty gold records. He is an honorary citizen of California (1974), Aruba (2004) and Edam-Volendam (2004). In 2006 he and the other former members of The Cats were decorated members of the Order of Orange-Nassau.

Uses =Marketing= In-product marketing is an additional channel in the digital marketing toolkit, which includes email marketing, search engine marketing (SEM), social media marketing, and many forms of display advertising, and mobile advertising. =Support= It can also refer to the strategy used by a company to reach specific segments of their customer base to provide in-product customer service and support, supply training materials, and initiate orders of replacement parts and consumables. =Feedback= In- product communication can also be a valuable way for businesses to gather user intelligence and feedback on their customer base, as the success of email requests for such information continues to decline. =Data Capture= Because in-product communications are delivered directly to the device of a user, many in-product communication platforms can auto-capture device information, like serial number, model number, operating system, version number, location, and potentially any additional metadata available from, and agreed-upon by the user. Variations In-product communication is an umbrella term to describe several types of direct communication. It may also refer to in-device communication, in-app communication, in-device messaging, or in-app messaging. =In-Device Communication= In-device communication or in-device messaging is generally accepted as messaging communications directly to a user's device screen, without running through a software application. For example, communications directly to the screen on an internet-connected printer, the screen on the handheld controller of a UAV or drone, or the screen of an internet-connected television, would all be considered in-device. In-device communication relies on a communication platform integrated directly into the operating system of the internet-connected device, allowing the manufacturer to feed messages, gather feedback, and engage with users from directly on the device display. Saturday, 15 December 2018 =In-App Communication= In-app communication or in-app messaging is the act of messaging, gathering feedback, or otherwise communicating with users through a software application, either on a mobile phone or tablet device, or through software on a PC. In this mode of communication, a communication platform is embedded as a software module in the application, generally resulting in much faster deployments of the technology, as compared to the integration timeline of in-device communication platforms. =Direct-to-Desktop Communication= Direct-to-desktop communication, or on-desktop messaging is the act of messaging, gathering feedback, or otherwise communicating with users through a software application or embedded peripheral driver on a desktop personal computer. Users interact with messages on the screen of the desktop computer, and the device manufacturer serves messaging dynamically from the back end. Effectiveness In-product marketing content is often very similar to that of email marketing campaigns, but the segmentation and delivery is more targeted. Because email is historically one of the most effective channels in the digital marketing toolkit, the email channel is becoming more overcrowded and overused, leading to much lower open rates, lower engagement rates, lower click-through rates (CTR), and lower conversion rates. The rise of internet-connected (IOT) devices is enabling a growing number of consumer products manufacturers to take advantage of this channel of marketing communications, to supplement other digital marketing channels. Because messages and communications are more targeted, and delivered directly to the user's device, engagement rates are often much higher than email marketing.

He described over 80 Australian orchid species, three from New Zealand and 30 from New Guinea as well as three new genera including one from New Zealand. He was a consulting physician at the Adelaide Hospital and a member of its board. He may have been the first to practise hypnotism during surgery, allowing him to remove a cyst from a woman's breast without anaesthetics \\"while she was still awake and talking to assistants and witnesses standing nearby.\\" Biography Rogers was the son of Joseph Rogers and his wife Ann Childers Rogers (n√©e Williams) and was one of their nine children. He was educated at Pulteney Street School, now Pulteney Grammar School and the University of Adelaide, graduating B.A. with first class honours in 1881. He taught at Prince Alfred College, Adelaide before earning a scholarship to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh where he graduated M.D. in 1887. In that year he also married Jean Scott Patterson in Edinburgh before returning to Australia and starting to practise medicine as a general practitioner. During the First World War Rogers directed the Keswick Base Hospital, a military hospital in Adelaide, with the rank of lieutenant- colonel. He was appointed to the boards of the Public Library, Museum and Art Gallery (1929‚Äì31) and the Justices' Association (1914‚Äì15). He was also a member of the South Australian Literary Societies' Union, and its president from 1909 to 1911. Contributions to medicine Rogers was a consulting physician at the Royal Adelaide Hospital from 1897 until his death, a member of its board and of the South Australian Medical Board and a member of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. He was superintendent of Enfield Receiving House (a psychiatric hospital) and Northfield Mental Hospital and consulting psychiatrist to all State mental institutions. As well as developing an interest in hypnotism and sometimes using it in his medical practice to improve patient well-being, he was the first doctor in South Australia to import and use an X-ray machine and to encourage others to use it in medical diagnosis and surgery. He was appointed Lecturer in Forensic Medicine at the University of Adelaide in 1919, a position he held until his retirement at the age of 78 in December 1939. Contributions to science In his spare time, Rogers studied orchids and became a world authority on Australasian species. In spite of having no formal training in botany, he published 25 papers on the subject between 1906 and 1932, collected more than 5,200 specimens, built his own herbarium and corresponded with orchid experts in England, Holland and America. He was assisted for nearly 30 years by the Adelaide artist, Rosa Fiveash in the drawing of the many species of orchid that he located and identified. In 1905 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of South Australia and served as its Vice President (1914) and President (1920) and in 1924 was elected a fellow of the Linnaean Society. Rogers corresponded with other orchidologist such as Herman Rupp, William Nicholls, Cyril Wright and Rudolf Schlechter and the descriptions of many species, named by others, were influenced by him. Two orchids have been named for him (Pterostylis rogersii E.Coleman and Prasophyllum rogersii Rupp). Some of the many orchids described and named by Rogers include: * Caladenia pectinata R.S Rogers * Caladenia radialis R.S.Rogers * Prasophyllum constrictum R.S.Rogers * Thelymitra azurea R.S.Rogers * Pterostylis alpina R.S.Rogers References External sources Category:Australian botanists Category:Australian military doctors Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Category:1861 births Category:1942 deaths Category:Australian psychiatrists ","title":"Richard Sanders Rogers"},{"id":"45243606","text":"The Litterbug is a 1961 animated short subject produced by Walt Disney Productions and featuring Donald Duck.

She originally trained as a painter before moving to the medium of photography. Laing has taught art at the University of New South Wales, College of Fine Arts. With over 100 exhibitions, Laing is widely known for her leading role in the concept-based photography field. Since her start in the photography field, Laing has explored conceptual photography, with most of her works being a part of a series in order to convey her concepts. Background Information =Education and training= Originally trained as a painter, from 1976 to 1979 Laing completed a Diploma of Art Education at the Brisbane College of Advanced Education in Queensland. She then went on to get her Diploma of Art in 1982 from the University of Tasmania in Hobart. Eight years later, from 1990 to 1991, Laing gained a Post Graduate Diploma from the Sydney College of the Arts in Sydney. And then, from 1992 to 1996 she completed a Master of Fine Arts in Honours Class 1, from the College of Fine Arts, New South Wales. =Early career= Laing originally used photography as reference material. She gained a job as an exhibition consultant in 1988, for the Australian Bicentennial Exhibition. This proved a step forward for Laing and her career. Editing work from some of the top photographers from around the country enabled her to see how they decided to represent the country. In 2000 Laing had her real breakthrough with the series Flight research. Development of photographic practice =Well known artworks= Some of Laing's most noteworthy series include Bulletproof glass and Groundspeed. Bulletproof glass is a series of images shot on location in the Blue Mountains, featuring women dressed in vintage wedding dresses with gunshot wounds to the chest whilst 'floating' in the sky. Some specific negative ideas that fed into this series include the unsuccessful Republican referendum in Australia, and the blatant refusal by the Government to apologise to the Aboriginal peoples of Australia. The series Groundspeed is a mix between an installation piece and photography. Laing visited the eucalyptus forests in South Australia and laid down carpet on the forest floor. With assistance Laing was able to produce multiple landscape images of the scene. \\"Flight sits in our consciousness as a kind of fantasy or dream. It is a metaphorical notion. Children dream of flying. It is a very escapist notion to be able to fly. Superheroes fly. Then you‚Äôve got Yves Klein‚Äôs Leap into the void. I was interested in unfettering the body from the mechanics of flight\\" -Rosemary Laing =Impact of significant historical events= Much of Laing's work is influenced by issues at the time, which becomes apparent in particular photographic series. Such influences include the unsuccessful Republican referendum in Australia, and the refusal by the Government to apologise to the Aboriginal peoples of Australia, which influenced her Groundspeed series. The effect that natural disasters had on the Australian landscape and the lives of those they affected influenced Laing to explore the ideas related to this through documentary photography. The series that arose from this exploration was titled one dozen unnatural disasters in the Australian landscape. Concepts A vast majority of Laing's artworks relate strongly to cultural and historical places throughout Australia. With staged sceneries, Laing involves the politics of particular locations as well as elements of current and modern culture. Laing became interested in flight in 1994, when she moved to a studio in Leichardt, Sydney which was directly under the flight path. Her growing annoyance with the sounds from planes passing overhead fueled her interest in the ideas of air travel, which in turn was the inspiration for her Flight Research series. Throughout her photography career, and the multiple series she produced, many of the concepts she explored surrounded landscape photography, both the cultural and historical aspects of this. Photographic techniques Since 1996, Laing has generally avoided digitally manipulating any of her images, which is what makes the subject matter in some of her images so surreal. An example of this is her series Flight research where the figure seems to be floating in the air, which most would assume was digitally manipulated. Laing uses the method of installation for many of her artworks, an example of this is the series Groundspeed in which she laid down industrially produced carpet onto a forest floor and then photographed it.

A home funeral may occur entirely within the family home or not. It is differentiated from the institutional funeral by its emphasis on minimal, noninvasive care and preparation of the body, on its reliance on the family‚Äôs own social networks for assistance and support, and on the relative or total absence of commercial funeral providers in its proceedings. The benefits of a home funeral are environmental, financial, therapeutic, and spiritual. Families who choose to care for their own report a sense of completion, a feeling of having done their best for those they love, and a stronger connection to their friends and family and community. Having something meaningful to do to help others through a crisis or sorrowful time is usually empowering for all involved. A home funeral gives family and friends more time with the departed, which may help in the often difficult, highly intimate grieving process. Overview During a home funeral, families take responsibility for: * planning and carrying out after-death rituals or ceremonies * preparing the body for burial or cremation by bathing, dressing and laying out for visitation * keeping the body cool with noninvasive techniques, such as ice * filing the death certificate and obtaining transport and burial permits * transporting the deceased to the place of burial or cremation * facilitating the final disposition, such as digging the grave in natural burial * hiring professionals for specific services Reasons for Choosing  * Home funerals are a loving way to say goodbye. A home funeral allows more time for closure; family and friends can gather for two or more days to prepare, memorialize, celebrate, grieve, and finally transport the body. * Home funerals provide control over decisions. Home funerals are often more personalized than the funeral or memorial service conducted away from home by a funeral director or service provider. Arrangements for keeping the body and/or transporting the body for cremation or burial can be challenging and should be planned ahead of time whenever possible. * Home funerals save money. By circumventing the potentially costly accoutrements of funeral home-arranged services, families can save thousands of dollars in what they might feel are unnecessary products and services. * Home funerals can facilitate bonding, as friends and family gather and cooperate in conducting the preparations and the event, supporting one another. * Home funerals reinforce the cycle of life. Surrounding the bereaved in the everyday life of the deceased can help to highlight this person's true nature, their accomplishments, and their loved ones' hopes. * Home funerals promote healing and closure. A home funeral provides a comfortable place to discuss life and death, to express grief and loss.  History  Until the American Civil War, home funerals were the norm. When a loved one died, families washed and dressed them, combed their hair, laid them out, and lamented. While neighbors built the coffin or wound the shroud, others dug the grave, made a meal, or sat with the body to say their goodbyes. Family and friends cared for the body and kept it laid out at home for as many days as it took to build, dig, and in some cases, wait for signs of decomposition to ensure the person was not being buried alive (a popular fear for many years). Economic resources, immigrant status, and religion all influenced what people did during the viewing, but holding a vigil was common. Death care was a personal, handcrafted endeavor, and involvement in the process was a demonstration of compassion and emotional investment in town, village or prairie life. During the Civil War, soldiers died on battlefields far from home, and families wanted their dead children returned to them. The bodies shipped by train, and the long, slow, journeys, especially in the summer, were sometimes gruesome affair of decaying bodies and unpleasant scenes. The desire to slow decomposition in an era before refrigeration promoted the development of embalming. Soldiers were sometimes embalmed right on the battlefields, shipped via train, then brought to their mother‚Äôs door by the local livery driver. Furniture builders and cabinetmakers started making coffins. The first mass-marketed coffins were being produced to meet the demand created by the war, and the trade of Undertaking slowly came into being. The embalmed body of assassinated President Lincoln was put on display before thousands of Americans, giving embalming its first major marketing moment. By the end of the 19th Century, the job of Undertaker was a trade which was regularly seen on census records, even in rural areas. By 1955, the US had more than 700 casket makers, and embalming and certain caskets and grave liners were aggressively marketed as preventing decomposition (a false claim). Undertakers had successfully transformed their public image from tradesman to moral arbiter of death practices and necessary expert in the mysterious world of death care. A perception grew that there was a legal requirement to hire professionals after a death, contributing to the false narrative that it is illegal to touch a dead body, that it must be embalmed, and that families no longer had the right to care for their own dead. In the early 1990s, home funeral educators began teaching old skills and promoting family-conceived and family-led home-based care to inform the public and to empower families to take back the responsibility and privilege of again bathing, dressing, and mourning loved ones in the privacy of their own homes. Home funerals are often associated with green burials. More individuals, families, and care communities are rising up in the face of exorbitant professional costs, spiritually disaffected procedures, and environmental concerns in search of affordable, meaningful and authentic funerals. The National Home Funeral Alliance was founded in 2010 to further support families in keeping this deeply human and truly traditional practice available and accessible to all.  Legal Requirements  Keeping or bringing a loved one home from an institution after death is legal in every state for bathing, dressing, private viewing, and ceremony as the family chooses. Every state recognizes the next- of-kin‚Äôs custody and control of the body that allows the opportunity to hold a home vigil. Religious observations, family gatherings, memorials, and private events are not under the jurisdiction of the State or professionals in the funeral industry, who have no medico-legal authority unless it is transferred to them when they are paid for service. Some states do require the involvement of a licensed funeral director for some portion of the process. Alabama, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Nebraska, New Jersey and New York have various restrictions concerning a family‚Äôs right to after-death care, home funerals and burials. This does not affect family rights to bring/keep the body at home, but a funeral director will need to be involved in the process. Families who hold a home funeral must still contact the authorities in order to file a death certificate and other documents.  Involvement of Home Funeral Guides  Using a home funeral guide (or end-of- life doula/midwife) is not legally required, although if a family is looking for help and advice through the death, they may choose seek out advice from a guide. Home funeral guides do not conduct after-death care as do licensed funeral directors. Guides teach, demonstrate, advise and support families and friends who then conduct their own care and make their own informed decisions.

He is a sculptor, an installation artist, and a performance artist‚Äîconceptualizing in the notion of \\"anti-concept\\" or \\"anti-art\\" in the Korean art scene. As one of the first generation pioneers of experimental art in Korea, Lee is known for his \\"non- sculptural\\" artworks that include \\"display of pieces in stone, rope and newsprint.\\" Lee mainly worked independently and created works that deviated from the dominant artistic concepts in Korea. \\"Unfettered by the demands of crude nationalism or from chasing the so-called international art world,\\" Lee's work came to be seen as \\"starting point for a different kind of avant- garde lineage.\\" He has strived to investigate new ways of creating art by experimenting with non-material objects. In 2009, Lee was the first recipient to be awarded Nam June Paik Art Center Prize.  Career  Born in Kowon, Hamgyeong Province in North Korea, Seung-taek Lee has had a wide range of interest since childhood. He used his talent for art to escape from North Korea during the Korean War. He made a living by drawing portraits for American soldiers during and after the Korean War. As a student, Lee became fascinated by Nietzsche's philosophy, which led him to pursue experimental art of the metaphysical. With his ambition to \\"leave a footprint as an artist in Korean modern art history\\", he decided to become an artist of his own world by thinking inversely about the world and freely expressing himself and his ideas. According to the art critic Oh Sang-ghil, Lee was downgraded to a non- mainstream level in the Korean modern art world, since most artists and art critics \\"unwaveringly followed western art trends and believed that it was the only way to survive\\". Lee considered that those artists and critics were unaware of their own identity and began to experiment with trials and errors of imitation in order to understand the true nature of Korean modern art. He was often regarded as a \\"heretical and rebellious character\\" amongst the artists and critics in Korea; however, he continued his journey of pursuing his own art in a then-conventionalized world of Korean art. Beginning with his non-figurative installation art, History and Time, at the 1958 Undergraduate Exhibition for the Department of Sculpture at Hongik University, he departed from the conventions of the Korean modern art. While at an exhibition to receive the Nam June Paik Art Center International Art Award, the chief curator of the Nam June Paik Art Center, Tobias Berger, mentioned that \\"Seung- taek Lee's artwork surpasses the main centers of traditional western modern art history\\". In 2008, Lee was Adviser of Korea Performance Art Spirit (KoPAS). In 1988, he served as Vice-president of Korean Fine Arts Association, and has worked as its Adviser since 1989. He became Representative Commissioner of various committees, such as Recycling through Art of National Theater of Korea in 2007, Le Biennale di Venezia in 1990, and the Exchange Exhibition of Modern Art between Korea and Japan in 1985. From 1970 to 1987, he lectured on modern art history in University of Seoul and Graduate School for nine years and in Mokwon University and Graduate School for nine years.  Works  = Earliest work: late 1950s = In the late 1950s, Seung-taek Lee was inspired by a small photo of a sculpture by Giacometti. The image depicted a female body composed of bare bones, without any flesh or muscle. Lee questioned himself whether he can even negate the bones, the remainder, and moved on to creating works without solid forms; he became interested in immateriality. He was then inspired by smoke coming out of Saudi Arabia's oil- burning furnace, which was broadcast on the news. He realized that smoke, wind, and fire are the only elements that can be expressed without a solid form. After the Korean War came to a provisional end in 1953, Lee went to Hongik University in Seoul to major Sculpture. He made a large sculpture named History and Time in 1958 for his university graduation show. The work consists of a U-shaped piece of plaster, which is wrapped with barbed wire and smeared colors of red and blue. According to the artist, the red represents Communism and the blue represents Democracy. He wanted to express the \\"tragedy of weak countries caught between warring Cold War superpowers\\" during the Korean War. In 1957, Lee was commissioned by his teacher and sculptor Kim Kyong-sung to help create a bronze statue of the U.S. general Douglas MacArthur, who was then respected by Koreans for his amphibious landing in September 1950 that turned the Korean War in favor of the United Nations and South Korean forces. During that year, Lee also produced one of his Godret stone pieces called Godret Stone (1957). Godret stone refers to a stone that is used for tying knots when plaiting handcrafted mats in Korea. His interest in fundamental changes in physical materiality led to the production of the Godret stone series. Although Lee's shaped Godret stones seem soft and shapeable, they are hard and solid in essence. In 2004, Lee further explained his thinking behind the piece in Kim Yung-hee's essay Following the Godret Stone: Entangled Energy/Spiritual World with Modernity. The work's visual impact comes from the \\"tension between the wooden bar, precariously hung from two thin cords, and the clusters of bifurcated stones that effectively conjure a sense of gravitational pressure\\". = 1960s = In the beginning of the 1960s, Lee traveled throughout Korea to find new subject matters for his art. He found them in nature‚Äîseas, beaches, fields and agricultural products‚Äîin artificial environments‚Äîstone walls in Jeju Island as well as manufactured architectural items‚Äîand in unfamiliar areas such as seaweed farms. In 1964, he created an installation work called The Wind Fence in the Han River on Nanji Island. The work was inspired by color rope fences around garlic fields in the countryside. The Wind Fence (1964) is composed of wood sticks and fabric. The wood sticks are firmly embedded to the ground in a circular orientation. The fabrics are tied to every stick and they horizontally connect each wood stick to another, forming four zig-zagged circles. Overall, they form a shape of a fence. Lee considers finding new subject matters significant for inventing new concept and method for his art. In the same year, he did some performance art such as The Burning Canvas Floating on the River (1964). He burned his old paintings and let them drift away in the Han River to demonstrate his defiant drive to \\"escape from the bonds of the past\\". In 1961, Lee began the first of his onggi, or oji, the \\"dark semi-porous earthenware traditionally used in Korea for storing and fermenting various condiments\\", works. In the second exhibition of the Original Form Association (Wonhyonghoe), he publicly unveiled his onggi-based works. He joined the group for their second exhibition in November 1964 at the Central Information Center next to Toksu Palace in Seoul, Korea. Lee also created works out of hair in the 1960s. In 1963, he produced the first of two 1963 works made with hair called My Hair. This work inspired a series of two-dimensional and installation works made with hair. In 1967, he created a huge installation work that was made from Lee's accidental experiment, which occurred when he went to a military camp near the DMZ to draw a portrait for a division commander. He obtained bags full of hair of new recruits and used them to create the installation work in a then-newly-built church. In order to capture his large-scale experimental and performance artworks, Lee used photography since the early 1960s. Because the size of his work was not clear in photographs, he took pictures of himself with his art in order to clarify the scale of the works. The photos showing the artist and his process of field work have become a trademark of Seung-taek Lee. = 1970s = Seung-Taek Lee, Drawing, 1974, cord Along with the Godret Stone series, Lee created the Tied Stone series starting in the late 50s. Many of his works surrounding the idea of 'tying' were produced in the 70s, such as Tied Stone (1972) and other Tied Stone series and Tied Book (1972). In order to defy the laws of nature, he changed the property of stone from hardness to tenderness through his works. Lee created other related pieces made with cords and ropes with porcelain and installation works, such as White Porcelain (1972) and Drawing (1974). In addition, he produced works that are made by nature. The unpredictability of his subjects, such as wind, fire, and smoke, played a significant role in the making of his non-materiality works. Paper Tree (1970) and Wind-Folk Amusement (1971) are Lee's signature works from the wind series. The artist used everyday materials, such as cloth and paper, to visualize the direction and force of the wind. At the MOT International exhibition in London, the Paper Tree installation and the photographic documentation of Wind-Folk Amusement give the form to the \\"transience of nature\\" and capture the energetic movement of the wind. Moreover, Lee's concept of non-materialization is revealed in the Fire series such as Burning Buddha Statue (1965‚Äì1971), in which he sets fire to a sacred icon. Such act is often overlooked as blasphemy against Buddha; however, according to the artist, it is an act of \\"purification\\" that recalls the ancient history of Buddhism. Natural landscape and elements act as an artistic medium, as well as a backdrop to Lee's performances and outdoor installations. In the 1960s, poverty and aftermath of the Korean War resulted in economic development and modernization throughout society. A movement of planting trees on mountains began and Lee's awareness of the crisis of pollution developed. The green movement became another form of his experimental art. As he painted huge waterfalls on places around Bukhan Mountain, his other related works also became more eco-friendly and promoted the importance in saving nature damaged by civilization. Such ideas are portrayed in works such as Artist Planting Moss (1975) and Green Campaign (1975). Lee created a green landscape in Green Campaign Installation (1976), which resembles a green river, by pouring a mix of fertilizer, moss, and water on a rock in order to create a more natural design. = 1980s = In the 1980s, Lee continued producing works that contributed to the green movement. The series included Green (1983) and Green Campaign (1985), a performance at road repairing site. Many of his works had different forms of and interactions with the earth model. One of his performances is called Earth Play (1989), which was titled so because of the work's physical interaction with participants. He also created other earth pieces that intended to bring a sense of guilt to those who harm nature. In addition, Lee expressed his pleasure for working on his art in isolation, such as in the deep mountains or fields without concerning other people's attention. He oftentimes conducts experimental performances for himself or for a small number of people in the art field. He declared for the Self-Burning Performance Art Festival in 1989 that he would make one or two artworks in various types each day of the exhibition period, and later burn the works. He conducted Self-Burning Performance in 1989 and Burning Modern Sculpture in 1984 to demonstrate such ideas. Moreover, Lee presented his 'thinking inversely' philosophy by questioning the necessity of frames and their role for aesthetic presentation of paintings. He therefore produced works throughout the 70s and the 80s . Many of them were wooden frames with the corners and edges bound by colorful cords. His idea of 'thinking inversely' is also reflected on his works surrounding the topic of sex. He considers sex as the \\"foundation of human history\\" and that it has played a significant role for the societal evolution. Because sex and art are inseparable entities, many artists, including Seung-taek Lee, use sex as a motif. Through his object works like Sexual Organs on TV (1987), he satirized roles of television. On the other hand, Lee created his visual commentary on ethicality issues of sex. He placed genital-shaped objects on trees, liquor bottles, boots, and other objects in order to challenge the common notion of abashment about sexual images. = 1990s and onward = Lee has continued producing works related to the topics he has investigated for more than fifty years. He created more sculpture works surrounding environmental issues, such as Energyless Earth and Discouraged Earth in 1992. He also conducted several performances like Earth Performance (1990) and Wind Performance at a Back Hill (2009) at Nam June Paik Art Centre. Along with massive, painterly abstractions, Lee used watercolor, moss, and other materials to transform the land into a canvas. At the Gwangju Art Biennale, Lee exhibited a monumental, double self-portrait The Artist to be Out of Breath (1991). The work consists of \\"bales of old clothes bound together into spindly, multi-limbed armatures that sprout two massive, scowling heads\\". As if suffering from exhaustion, the twisted, body-like arrangements are laid out on the floor. Black and white patterned, wooden beams connect those arrangements. In a larger context, the work deals with the division of Korea and the allegory of a state torn apart by war, along with ideological differences from the Cold War. Furthermore, Lee created A Bridge Not Able to Cross in 1990 to portray the issues of the divided nation. With fervent ardor, Seung-taek Lee has \\"cultivated his own art world\\" for more than sixty years. His constant questioning of \\"can even this be art?\\" has further motivated him to investigate new non-material objects and art. He has continued having performances and exhibitions around the globe and produces works in Seoul, Korea.

Biography Tilbrook was born in Llandudno, Wales, in 1848 and sailed to South Australia on the Albermarle with his parents when he was about six years old. He worked for a short time as a typesetter at the Register in Adelaide, as well as working as a lamb minder for a short time. Enticed by the gold rush at the time, Tilbrook moved to New Zealand to try to make a living prospecting. After having no luck with gold, he moved on to work for the Grey River Argus in Greymouth. Shortly after returning from New Zealand, Tilbrook founded the Northern Argus newspaper in Clare. On 19 February 1869, when he was 21, the first edition was published. On 1 January 1870 he married Marianne Clode in Noah, Adelaide. Marianne Clode was the daughter of Richard and Charlotte Clode from Windsor in England. Tilbrook died on 9 September 1937 in St Peters. Photography H. H. Tilbrook - Corset Rock - Google Art Project In 1870, Tilbrook took up photography. He practiced the dry plate method. When he retired to East Adelaide in 1891 photography had become his full-time focus. Tilbrook was a keen believer in photography as an accurate and clear way to record images, and was always concerned with the quality and composition of his works. Tilbrook disliked the photography of the then new South Australian Photographic Society, especially artists like John Kauffmann and Frederick Joyner, whose pictorialist photographs would usually be blurred and \\"fuzzy\\". While speaking of one of his own photographs which during exposure had been affected by wind, Tilbrook said \\"in fact it was of the fuzzy order of photography - a thing to be avoided and shunned, even banned.‚Äô\\" He believed that to truly portray the beauty of the Australian landscape, his images needed to be sharp and focused. Photographic excursions During retirement, Tilbrook went on various photographic trips between 1894 and 1905 throughout the Australian outback to document the landscape. Travelling mainly around the Mount Gambier and Flinders Ranges areas, he also ventured to many other smaller towns and regions. Tilbrook never made any commercial gains from the photographs he took on his trips; however, some of his prints were supplied to the railway department in 1901 to decorate the walls of train carriages. Henry Tilbrook's Panorama of Elder Range, 1894Whilst photography was Tilbrook's main goal for the trips, he was also a keen hunter; and most of his early trips were primarily for hunting. These hunting trips gave Tilbrook the inspiration to take his camera along to future excursions. In his diary, he speaks of his 1894 trip to the Flinders Ranges: \\"although I took my combined hammerless gun and rifle with me, I decided as my main objective to obtain photographic records of the scenes of our explorations.\\" While on his photographic excursions, he would often spend time on his own - or solus, as he would call it \\\\- with his camera, which usually meant carrying around very heavy packs of camera gear. \\"On this day I shouldered my thirty-eight pounds‚Äô weight of photographic apparatus and marching two and a half miles onward and to and through the town took six more views of Mount Gambier and the volcanic lakes.\\" 14 March 1898. Not only was the equipment heavy and cumbersome, but the processing was also difficult whilst on his trips. In the evenings, he would change his plates in a tent with his upper body inside a crude substitute for a darkroom: a dark bag made by his wife with a ruby glass window, which would only allow in light that wouldn't affect his plates. In 1905 at age 57, Tilbrook went on his last trip, which took him again to Mt. Gambier and also into Victoria. By this stage in his life he was starting to suffer quite serious health problems, which never hindered his desire to travel and continue photography. He writes in his diary that while trudging through a boggy track carrying his nearly twenty kilograms of equipment, he suddenly recalled the warning from his doctor to not \\"take violent exercise, or even go up steps, or carry heavy weights, or go up hills.\\" Limestone Ridge caves, Mumbannar, Victoria 1905 On this last trip, he visited several cave formations near Mumbannar, Victoria. Whilst in these dark limestone caves he used a very early form of flash photography, burning magnesium ribbon during long exposures of up to forty minutes, which created a detailed view of the interior of the dark caves. Tilbrook was able to innovate to create his photographs. Not only was he an early adaptor of artificial lighting, but he also had a clever approach to including himself in his photos. Using a reel of thread, he attached one end to the shutter and ran the other end through a series of metal pegs to wherever he was standing in the photograph. Once tightened, the thread would activate the shutter mechanism. To avoid camera shake, he used a bullet shell which would fall to the ground after setting off the shutter. Botanic Park, Adelaide (Tilbrook standing on bridge) c1900 It is by using this method that Tilbrook was able to be in most of his well-known photographs, as well as including himself in many group photos from his trips. It is something he was to be known for after his self-portrait works began to be used on passenger trains around Adelaide. In his diary he recalls hearing a story of a lady who, after travelling on the train, remarked \\"I came up in a carriage with Mr Henry Tilbrook.\\" When asked where he was going, the lady replied that she did not know, and that she \\"left him in the train. He was sitting on a rock ‚Äì in a picture\\" Legacy As well as leaving behind his photographs, which provide a detailed insight into life in the late 19th century in South Australia, Tilbrook's main contribution was the founding of his newspaper, the Northern Argus. It stayed in the Tilbrook family until 1996 when it was bought out by Rural Press. It continues to provide daily news for the people of Clare and the surrounding region. As of 2015, its historic archives are kept by the Clare History Group. References External links * Collection of works by H. H.

He was found shot and beaten to death in his apartment in 1996, along with his longtime friend, Timwanika Lumpkins. Barnes was a six-foot, 220-pound linebacker who played second string for the Hurricanes. Barnes and Ray Lewis who played for the Baltimore Ravens were roommates at The University of Miami. Murder On the morning of April 13, 1996, Barnes' body was discovered when his roommate, Earl Little, came home to pick up the keys to his truck. Little found that someone had slashed two of the tires on his truck, and when he attempted to open the door to the apartment, he noticed that there was something obstructing the door. When Earl looked through an opening in the door, he saw the body of his roommate and friend, Marlin Barnes, slumped against the door with a pool of blood surrounding him. Barnes was severely injured and had nearly lost his entire face in what appeared to be a brutal beating, and was close to death when Little found him. By the time the police arrived, Barnes was already dead. It was discovered that Barnes had been beaten to death with a blunt object. After a thorough search of the rest of the apartment, police found the beaten and broken, yet alive, body of Barnes‚Äô girlfriend, Timwanika Lumpkins, pinned between the bed and the wall. She later died in the hospital. Investigation After seventeen days of investigation, it was concluded that Lumpkins‚Äô ex-boyfriend, Labrant Dennis, had entered the apartment after slashing the tires on Little's car. After entering the apartment, Dennis proceeded to beat Barnes twenty-two times with the butt of a shotgun. When he was done with Barnes, he turned on Lumpkins, doing the same to her as he did to Barnes. Dennis was sentenced to the death penalty and was still on death row.Labrant Dennis Aftermath In December 1996 The University of Miami agreed to a financial settlement with the families of Barnes and Lumpkins, due to the murders having occurred in an on-campus apartment. All parties agreed to keep the details of the settlement private. But the Miami Herald, under unnamed sources, reported that each family received more than $1 million.

In the absence of cognate input molecules, scRNAs are engineered to coexist metastably or stably without interacting. Detection of the cognate inputs initiates downstream conformational changes of one or more scRNAs leading to generation of the desired output signal. The output signal may be intended to read out the state of endogenous biological circuitry (e.g., mapping gene expression for biological research or medical diagnosis),H.M.T. Choi, J.Y. Chang, L.A. Trinh, J.E. Padilla, S.E. Fraser, and N.A. Pierce. or to regulate the state of endogenous biological circuitry (e.g., perturbing gene expression for biological research or medical treatment). scRNA sequences can be programmed to recognize different inputs or to activate different outputs, achieving even single-nucleotide sequence selectivity. scRNA signal transduction exploits principles from the emerging disciplines of dynamic RNA nanotechnology, molecular programming, and synthetic biology. Figure 1. Fluorescent signal amplification using small conditional RNAs. Metastable fluorescent scRNAs self-assemble into fluorescent amplification polymers upon detection of a cognate RNA initiator. Initiator I nucleates with hairpin H1 via base pairing to single-stranded toehold '1', mediating a 3-way branch migration that opens the hairpin to form complex I¬∑H1 containing single-stranded segment '3*-2*'. This complex nucleates with hairpin H2 by means of base pairing to toehold '3', mediating a branch migration that opens the hairpin to form complex I¬∑H1¬∑H2 containing single-stranded segment '2*-1*'. Thus, the initiator sequence is regenerated, providing the basis for a chain reaction of alternating H1 and H2 polymerization steps. Red stars denote fluorophores. Image from Choi et al. 2010; used with permission of the Nature Publishing Group.  Examples of scRNA signal transduction  Fluorophore-labeled scRNAs have been engineered to transduce between detection of mRNA targets and generation of bright fluorescent amplification polymers in situ (Figure 1). In this context, scRNA signal transduction enables multiplexed mapping of mRNA expression within intact vertebrate embryos (Figure 2). scRNAs have been engineered to perform shape and sequence transduction to conditionally produce a Dicer substrate targeting 'silencing target' mRNA Y upon detection of an independent 'detection target' mRNA X, with subsequent Dicer processing yielding a small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting mRNA Y for destruction (Figure 3). In this context, scRNA signal transduction provides a step towards implementing conditional RNA interference (Figure 4). Figure 2. Simultaneous mapping of five different target mRNAs within an intact zebrafish embryo using scRNA signal amplification and confocal microscopy. RNA probes complementary to mRNA targets trigger chain reactions in which fluorophore- labeled scRNAs self-assemble into tethered fluorescent amplification polymers. The programmability and sequence selectivity of these amplification cascades enable five scRNA amplifiers to operate independently at the same time in the same sample, each staining for expression of one of the five target mRNAs. Scale bar: 50 Œºm. Image from Choi et al. 2010; used with permission of the Nature Publishing Group. Figure 3. Conditional Dicer substrate formation via shape and sequence transduction with small conditional RNAs. scRNA A¬∑B detects mRNA detection target X (containing subsequence 'a-b-c'), leading to production of Dicer substrate B¬∑C targeting mRNA silencing target Y (containing independent subsequence 'w-x-y-z'). scRNAs A¬∑B and C are stable in the absence of X. A swaps B for X (step 1) via toehold-mediated 3-way branch migration and spontaneous dissociation. B assembles with C (step 2) via loop/toehold nucleation and 3-way branch migration to form Dicer substrate B¬∑C. Chemical modifications (2'OMe-RNA) prevent degradation: A and part of C (dashed backbone). Image from Hochrein et al. 2013; used with permission of the American Chemical Society. Figure 4. Conditional RNAi (if gene X is transcribed, silence independent gene Y) provides a conceptual framework for exerting spatiotemporal control over gene knockdown. Toward this end, small conditional RNAs (scRNAs) interact and change conformation to transduce between binding of mRNA 'detection target' X and production of a Dicer substrate targeting independent mRNA 'silencing target' Y.

Design elements  scRNAs can be engineered to exploit diverse design elements: *scRNA reactants may be metastable or stable *scRNA signal transduction cascades can be catalytic or non-catalytic *scRNAs can nucleate with each other or with input or output molecules via toehold/toehold nucleation, loop/toehold nucleation, or template/toehold nucleation *scRNAs can dissociate with each other or with input or output molecules via 3-way branch migration, 4-way branch migration, or spontaneous dissociation *scRNA reactants can be monomers, dimers, or other multimers  References  Category:Molecular genetics Category:Non-coding RNA ","title":"Small conditional RNA"},{"id":"45243925","text":"Aristides Baltas (; born 9 February 1943) is a philosopher of science and physicist who served as the Minister of Culture and Sports of Greece and as the Minister of Culture, Education and Religious Affairs in the cabinet of Alexis Tsipras from 27 January 2015 to 4 November 2016.

Career In 1991, Zhang and Stephen Tyerman studied sodium azide and concluded that by combining it with oxygen and using both on the hydraulic conductivity of the cell cortex will increase volumes of pressure relaxation. In 1999 he and Tyerman studied Triticum aestivum and how mercuric chloride effects on hydraulic conductivity in that plant. During the experiment it was revealed that the inhibition of Lp and depolarization of Vm which is caused by HgCl2 was similar to hypoxia. In 2001 he, Tyerman, and Peter Ryan have studied the same species again and how malic acid which is found on the tip or extreme end of a root is tolerant against aluminum. During the same study he also discovered that when Al3+ is activated its permeability is higher than malate2‚àí and contained anion channel antagonists such as niflumate and diphenylamine-2-carboxylic acid. In 2009 he along with Chinese colleagues studied nitric oxide in combination with nitrate reductase in both cold and freezing temperature on a plant species called Arabidopsis thaliana. He discovered that when combining this with both nia1nia2 and nitric oxide associated leaves the cold doesn't bother the plants as much, but it does bother its seedings. He also discovered proline in wild plants and used nitrate reductase inhibitor with nitric oxide scavenger and donor to prove that there is positive correlation between them when it comes to freezing temperature. In June 2010 he along with American and Japanese colleagues had studied acid soils and discovered that certain species of crop plants are resistant to soluble aluminum. The way how they do, he explained, is that the genes of ALMT and MATE families encode membrane proteins which produce anion efflux called TaALMT1 across the cell membrane.

The character is an original character to the television series, created by Greg Berlanti, Marc Guggenheim and Andrew Kreisberg, but incorporates character and plot elements of the DC Comics character Black Canary. Sara Lance was originally portrayed by Jacqueline MacInnes Wood in the pilot episode, and has since been continually portrayed by Caity Lotz. Sara initially goes by the moniker of The Canary', a translation of her Arabic League of Assassins name ('), which translates to \\"Whistling Bird\\". She later adopts the code name of White Canary before joining the Legends of Tomorrow. Lotz has appeared as Sara Lance and her superhero persona in crossovers on the television series Arrow, The Flash, Legends of Tomorrow, Supergirl and Batwoman, all set within the Arrowverse. The character has also appeared in a digital comic book series.  Appearances  = Arrow = Sara Lance first appears in the pilot episode of Arrow as the younger sister of Laurel Lance. It's shown that five years prior to the beginning of the series, she was having a secret affair with her sister's boyfriend Oliver Queen and was with him on his family yacht when it shipwrecked. Everyone on board was presumed dead but flashbacks in season two reveal that, like Oliver, Sara actually survived the experience. She was rescued by a research boat, the Amazo, and when Oliver was captured by the ship's crew, Sara helped him escape. Together, along with Oliver's friend Slade Wilson, they attacked the ship. Due to Slade's love for Shado, an ally who was killed indirectly because of Oliver who was being forced to choose who to live between Sara and Shado, Slade betrayed Oliver and took over both the ship and Oliver as his prisoner. Oliver and Sara confronted him on the freighter and Sara was swept away in the current, causing Oliver to believe that she died once again. However, Sara was found by Nyssa al Ghul who took her to Nanda Parbat. She and Nyssa became lovers, and Sara became a deadly fighter with the League of Assassins under the name Ta-er al-Sahfer, roughly translated to \\"Yellow Bird\\" or \\"Canary\\" from Arabic. In season two, Sara returns to Starling City after a six-year absence as \\"The Canary\\" to protect her family. In keeping with a promise, she also befriends wayward teenager Sin and watches over her. Oliver manages to capture and unmask The Canary, revealing Sara to be alive. She eventually informs her father, SCPD Detective Quentin Lance, and looks after him and Laurel (who also later discovers she's alive and is a vigilante). Sara joins Team Arrow and revisits a brief relationship with Oliver. She aids him and his colleagues Felicity Smoak, John Diggle, and Roy Harper in taking down a drug-enhanced Slade Wilson, with help from the League of Assassins, which requires Sara to return to Nanda Parbat. In season three, Sara is killed on a rooftop with three arrows to the chest. Some time later, it is revealed that Thea Queen killed Sara after being drugged by her father Malcolm Merlyn/Dark Archer as part of a plot to pit Oliver against Ra's al Ghul. Meanwhile, Laurel takes up Sara's mantle to fight crime as the Black Canary. In season four, Laurel resurrects Sara using the League's mystical Lazarus Pit. The process is successful, but Sara is brought back to life without a soul, making her feral and dangerous. Oliver calls his old friend John Constantine to assist them in restoring Sara's soul. Days later, Sara aids in rescuing Ray Palmer/The Atom from the hands of Damien Darhk, before leaving town to find herself, eventually joining the Legends along with Ray. During her time away with the Legends, Laurel is killed by Darhk and Sara is later made aware of it by Quentin when she briefly returns to present-day Star City at the end of season one of Legends of Tomorrow, where she and Quentin mourn Laurel together. Sara, along with Ray and the rest of the Legends, return for the season five crossover \\"Invasion!\\" when Barry Allen/The Flash and his team contact her, informing her and the Legends that they and the rest of the heroes in the present day need help fighting an invasion from an alien race known as the Dominators. The Legends arrive and meet up with Team Flash and Team Arrow, then introduce themselves to Barry's friend from Earth-38 Kara Danvers/Supergirl, whom he had brought over to help combat the Dominators. After Oliver appoints Barry leader of the group, they all spar with Kara to practice fighting aliens, and are repeatedly defeated. Meanwhile, Sara develops a small friendship with Kara. When Barry is forced to reveal that he had gone back in time to save his mother and then reversed the decision, which has now altered some of the group's lives a bit, Sara scolds him and everyone except Oliver and a few others lose faith in Barry. Kara leads Sara and the others, while Barry and Oliver stay behind to rescue the president from the Dominators. This ends with the president being killed and the Dominators using a device to mind-control the entire group. Sara returns with the rest of the mind-controlled heroes and attacks Barry and Oliver, until Barry tricks Kara into destroying the device, freeing them. They regroup and after they reaffirm their faith in Barry, five of them (Sara, Oliver, Ray, Thea, and Diggle) are abducted by the Dominators and placed in pods that put them in a shared dream world, where Sara, Oliver, and Oliver's father never got on the Queen's Gambit and all of Oliver fallen friends, including Laurel, are still alive. In this dream world, Oliver and Laurel are engaged, and while Sara helps Laurel get ready for their wedding, she begins having memory flashes of her actual life. Sara later saves Oliver and Diggle from a manifestation of Deathstroke, and the three realize that the world they're in isn't real. They later rally Ray and Thea and attempt to leave, but are forced to fight manifestations of Malcolm, Slade, Darhk, and their mercenaries before killing all of them. Sara and Oliver share a heartbreaking goodbye with Laurel. They wake up on the Dominator ship in the real world and escape in a pod before being rescued by the Legends‚Äô timeship Waverider. They conclude that the dream world was a distraction meant to keep them busy while the Dominators probed their minds for information on metahumans. They return to earth, and as some of the Legends‚Äîalong with Felicity and Cisco Ramon‚Äîhead to the past and attempt to abduct a dominator, Sara, Barry, Oliver, and Ray confront a group of secret service agents who attempt to kill them. They defeat the agents, whose leader informs them that the Dominators are after metahumans because they are aware that Barry has changed the timeline. The Dominators now perceive them as a threat. Barry attempts to surrender himself to the Dominators in exchange for their leaving earth, but Sara and the rest of the heroes persuade him not to. She pilots the Waverider with Cisco to hold the Dominator's freefalling metabomb in place with a tractor beam while Jefferson Jackson/Firestorm transforms it into harmless water and the heroes on the ground use a pain-inflicting device to force the Dominators to flee. Sara and the other heroes are honored by the new President later that night and they celebrate, before sharing a hug with Oliver and returning to the Waverider with the rest of the Legends. Sara briefly returns in season six when she receives a call from her sister's doppelg√§nger, the recently reformed criminal from Earth-2 Laurel Lance / Black Siren, who informs her that Quentin had been seriously injured in the battle against Ricardo Diaz and is in the hospital. Sara arrives and meets her deceased sister's doppelg√§nger, who had developed a genuine father-daughter relationship with Quentin; they refer to each other as such. Sara thanks Earth-2 Laurel for calling her; Laurel thanks her for coming. Laurel tells her that the doctors are optimistic that Quentin will make it and asks Sara if it's weird seeing her. Sara replies that it is, a little. Sara asks if she is like her Laurel, and Laurel replies that she hardly is at all, clearly disappointed with herself. The two witness Oliver being arrested for being the Green Arrow per the condition of his agreement with the FBI, in exchange for their help in the fight against Diaz and his allies. The doctor comes and informs everyone present that Quentin has died from lack of oxygen to his brain during surgery, leaving Sara, Laurel, Oliver, and the rest of Team Arrow devastated. Later, as Oliver (under the direction of the FBI) announces to the world on live TV that he is the Green Arrow, before being taken to prison, Sara and Laurel mourn together over Quentin's body. = Legends of Tomorrow = In the spin-off series, Legends of Tomorrow, Sara is recruited by Rip Hunter to a time travelling team of rejects aimed at defeating the immortal villain Vandal Savage. Before she departs, Laurel gives Sara the White Canary name and outfit to signify her new start. Over the course of the first season, Sara continues her battle with blood-lust; sets in motion the events that will lead to her own rescue by Nyssa; romances many women throughout history; and develops a flirtatious relationship with Leonard Snart, with the two sharing a kiss in an episode near the end of the season where Snart sacrifices himself for the team. The Legends return to 2016 a few months after they left and Sara is devastated to learn of Laurel's murder. Sara wants to go back and save her sister but Rip tells her that would only get herself and her father killed. In season two, Sara becomes captain of the timeship Waverider and leader of the Legends following Rip's disappearance. She mercilessly hunts her sister's killer, Damien Darhk, throughout history before accepting that she cannot bring Laurel back due to the delicacy of time. In the \\"Invasion!\\" crossover event, Sara and the Legends return to 2016 to aid Team Arrow, Team Flash, and Earth-38's Supergirl in repelling the Dominators' alien invasion. In the second-season finale, Sara is forced to use the Spear of Destiny to save reality from the Legion of Doom. While tempted to rewrite her own tragic history, the Spear briefly reunites Sara with a projection of Laurel, who encourages Sara to do what's right and make peace with her death. Sara then chooses to render the Spear itself inert, foiling the evil plans of Eobard Thawne/Reverse Flash and allowing him to be killed by the Black Flash, who has been hunting him all season. In season three of Legends, Sara continues to lead the Waverider crew as they track down and repair anachronisms throughout time, working in an antagonistic partnership with Rip Hunter's new bureaucratic organization, the Time Bureau. In the four- part crossover \\"Crisis on Earth-X,\\" Sara travels to 2017 to attend the wedding of Barry Allen and Iris West, where she has a one-night stand with Supergirl's adoptive sister Alex Danvers.The assembled heroes work together to repel an invading Nazi army from the alternate world of Earth-X. While confronting the demonic entity Mallus alongside her old friend John Constantine, Sara and Constantine hook up, despite her ongoing romantic tension with Time Bureau agent Ava Sharpe. Ava and Sara begin dating in subsequent episodes, but break up after Sara is temporarily possessed by Mallus through the death totem and reasons that, given her history with death and destruction, she poses a danger to Ava. Despite this setback, they soon get back together, with the two shown to be in a stable relationship by the time of the Legends removing Paul Revere from the height of Beatlemania. Season four of Legends focuses on Sara leading the team to track down magical \\"fugitives\\" of mythology from around the timestream, with the support of Ava and the Time Bureau.  Creation and development  Jacqueline MacInnes Wood was cast as Sara Lance in March 2012. Caity Lotz was announced to be playing Arrow's version of Black Canary during July 2013. During the same month it was revealed that her character is Sara, who had survived the Queen's Gambit shipwreck. According to Arrow producer Andrew Kreisberg, Sara was originally meant to be Ravager but they decided to give that role to Summer Glau's character Isabel Rochev instead. After the switch was made, Sara was made into the Canary. After the character's death during the shows third season, it was announced in February 2015 that Caity Lotz would become a cast member on Legends of Tomorrow, though it was not until May that they revealed she would continue to play Sara instead of a new character. Originally known for her martial arts prowess, in July 2019 it was announced that Sara would develop a superpower during the fifth season of Legends of Tomorrow, later revealed to be precognition.  Multiverse  *An alternate version of Sara is mentioned on Earth-X where the Nazis won World War II and proceed to conquer the rest of their world. Like her Earth-1 counterpart she was bisexual; when her father, an SS Sturmbannf√ºhrer, discovered this he killed her. *In the episode \\"Starling City\\", it is referred that Earth-2's Laurel Lance has a sister. It is unclear whether this is actually Sara's doppelganger, though Laurel does mention that like Sara she slept with her world's Oliver. *In the crossover \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\", on Earth-16 (a world like Earth-1, but with no fantastical elements), Oliver Queen became the Green Arrow, but Sara Lance actually did die on the Queen's Gambit and thus never became the White Canary.  Reception  The revelation in the season two episode, \\"Heir to the Demon\\", that Sara is bisexual and has been in a relationship with Nyssa al Ghul was positively received by critics as it made her the first character from either Marvel or DC to be explicitly shown as queer in either the movies or TV shows. IGN's Jesse Schedeen praised the relationship between Sara and Wentworth Miller's character Leonard Snart, as well as the chemistry between Lotz and Miller, calling their \\"faint romantic tension that existed between [them] since the first episode\\" containing more weight than many of the other relationships on the show.  In other media  * Sara Lance also features in the tie-in novel Arrow: Fatal Legacies which was released in January 2018. The novel focuses on events between the fifth-season finale and sixth-season premiere of Arrow and is co- authored by Arrow executive producer Marc Guggenheim and author James R. Tuck. * White Canary is a playable character in the mobile-exclusive edition of Injustice 2, with her Legends of Tomorrow attire available as an alternate skin for Black Canary.

It is now out of print. The historical photographs were edited by Thomas Edward Curran III, a museum researcher at the Oakland Museum of California. The contemporary photographs were by Peter Menzel. Pre-human history Comprising seven chapters, the book begins with a look at the geology from the Mesozoic, Cretaceous, Cenozoic, Oligocene, Miocene and Pleistocene epochs that created Oakland's signature geologic formations: Mount Diablo to the East, the unique redwood forests, and the San Andreas and Hayward faults that bracket the San Francisco Bay. Next, the book describes the Ohlone or Huchiun Indians who populated \\"the eastern shores of San Francisco Bay for at least 3,500 years before the coming of the first white man.\\"Oakland, Hub of the West, p. 12 This was a territory ideal for human societies from the first Indians to today's ethnically diverse cultural and technological hub.Oakland, Hub of the West, pp. 12-13 According to Weber, the historical record of early Indian civilization shows that Oakland was always well-suited for civilization: \\"Careful excavation of the two largest of over 400 Ohlone shell mounds inventoried along the perimeter of San Francisco Bay in 1908 revealed a people who early recognized the tremendous natural bounty offered them in Oakland's hills, canyons and lush salt marshes.\\"Oakland, Hub of the West, p. 19 1770s to 1850 Chapter two covers the period from sparse Spanish mission rule starting in 1776 in neighboring San Francisco and San Jose, through the Gold Rush, to California statehood in 1850. Chapter three covers the nascent city of Oakland and its first mayor, Horace Walpole Carpentier, then continues through the Civil War and the western transcontinental railhead: \\"For years, ever since the first mayor's inaugural address, Oakland's civic yearnings had focused on the state capital and the western transcontinental railhead. But when airy talk of a continent-spanning track suddenly crystallized in 1863 with organization by Governor Staford and his three partners of the Central Pacific Railroad, Oakland started lobbying hard lest dream number two also whisk through municipal fingers.\\"Oakland, Hub of the West, p. 61 1870s Chapter four describes Oakland's growth into a bucolic yet cultured alternative to San Francisco: \\"'The Athens of the Pacific' was a civic motto often repeated. The state university was the coeducational Parthenon, but scarcely inferior in esteem were the Reverend C.T. Mills' fashionable Seminary for Young Ladies, relocated to East Oakland from Benicia in 1871, and the three-story Convent of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart on the Sisters of the Holy Name (who originally opened the secondary school in 1868). Young men donned the cadet gray of the California Military Academy out on Telegraph Avenue or attended any of a number of private secondary schools. The new Oakland High School was excellent -- and, in violation of state law, it was even open to black youths. (The state constitution still excluded 'colored' pupils, along with Chinese and Indiean children, from white classrooms).\\"Oakland, Hub of the West, p. 68 1880s to 1930s Chapter five covers the period from the first Oakland cable cars in 1886 to U.S. Air Secretary Charles McCracken's prediction of \\"real aviation passenger service\\" in 1927 and the purchases of land that would become the Oakland International Airport. That year or thereabouts, Louise Thaden became one of the first Oakland women to fly. It continues through the Art Deco stylings and Great Depression of the 1930s. City planning and subdivisions Chapter six, \\"Busts and Booms,\\" covers the economic vicissitudes and racial tensions that Oakland faced as the city grew. Post-WWII to 1980 Chapter seven closes the book with a look at the post-war period until 1981, when the book was published: \\"World War II was a hormone shot, an artificial stimulus that produced wild new blossoms but sucked at the marrow and should ultimately debilitate,\\" writes Weber at the launch of chapter six. Following the great migration of Southern African-American workers to Oakland's war effort, the city's demographics changed once again, from 12 percent black in 1950 to nearly double that in 1960. \\"Meanwhile, they were enriching the East Bay's cultural life in distinctive ways. In music, a particular raw-edged, down-home style known as the Oakland blues was evolving at backstreet night clubs like the Rumboogie, the Three Sisters, Slim Jenkins, the Manhattan and Esther's Orbit Room.\\"Oakland, Hub of the West, p. 156 Notable Oaklanders Among the famous figures mentioned in the book are the following: *Jun√≠pero Serra, founder of Alta California's earliest Spanish missions *Joaquin Miller, poet and frontiersman *Jack London, writer *Samuel Merritt, mayor of Oakland *Isadora Duncan, dancer *Gertrude Stein, writer *John Handy, jazz saxophonist *Pharoah Sanders, jazz saxophonist *Sonny Simmons, jazz saxophonist *Earl \\"Fatha\\" Hines, jazz pianist buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Oakland *The Pointer Sisters, R&B; singing group *The Whispers, gospel singing group *Lionel Wilson, first African-American mayor, serving three terms from 1977 to 1991 *Jim Hines, African-American sprinter from McClymonds High School who won (and accepted) two gold medals in the 1968 Mexico City Olympics at the height of the Black Power movement Corporate histories Sponsored by the Oakland Chamber of Commerce, the book was also supported by 43 corporate sponsors, each of whom had a brief corporate history published within the book starting on page 175. These were a cross-section of the types of businesses that built Oakland into a West Coast transportation and commerce hub: American President Lines, the Port of Oakland, The Grotto, Emporium Capwell, The Clorox Company, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Chevron, California College of Arts and Crafts, Trader Vic's, Peerless Coffee, The Oakland Tribune, The Oakland Symphony, and The Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Complex, among others. Two railroad sponsors were profiled, Southern Pacific Company and Western Pacific Railroad; the latter was acquired in 1983, just two years after the book's publication, by Union Pacific Railroad. Reviews and citations \\"...according to historian David Weber in his book Oakland, Hub of the West, [Oakland] Mayor [Horace] Carpentier had arranged that everyone had to pay him tribute to enter or leave Oakland. Needless to say, he became the most hated man in Oakland and was chased out of town on at least two occasions by gathering mobs who also stoned his house.\\"http://liveoak61.org/Home/History References Category:1981 non-fiction books Category:20th-century history books Category:History books about cities ","title":"Oakland, Hub of the West"},{"id":"45244160","text":"Amalia Gonz√°lez Caballero de Castillo Led√≥n (1898 - 1986) was a diplomat, cabinet minister, minister plenipotentiary, writer, and the first female member of a presidential cabinet.

Eventually, however, there is a price to be paid. Plot The guests at an isolated hotel cut off by an avalanche are surprised when Roland Brissot, a man missing his left hand, shows up, carrying only a small casket. He asks the innkeeper if there is a cemetery adjoining the ruins of a nearby abbey and is disappointed when the answer is no. Then two shots ring out. The police arrive, looking for a little man carrying a coffin. The news frightens Brissot. While he is called to the telephone, his casket is stolen during a temporary blackout. Disconsolate, he gives in to the curiosity of the other guests and tells his story. A flashback ensues. Brissot is a struggling, untalented painter in Paris. He persuades Ir√®ne, an attractive glove shop saleswoman, to pose for him. One night, frustrated with his lack of drive, she breaks up with him at a cafe. M√©lisse, the chef, comes over and offers him a solution for all his woes: a talisman that will give him everything he wants, for the price of one sou (penny). Ange (Angel) warns him not to buy it, and the chef reveals that he must sell it at a loss before he dies or he will be condemned to Hell forever. The talisman turns out to be a severed left hand, which amazingly obeys the chef's commands. Despite all this, Brissot does not believe the supernatural aspects and buys it. As soon as the bargain is concluded, the chef loses his left hand. The talisman works. Exactly one year later, Brissot has a wildly successful exhibition at Galerie Gabelin and is married to Ir√®ne. For some reason he himself does not understand, he paints with his left hand only and signs his works \\"Maximum Leo\\". At the exhibition, he spots a little man he has seen before. He chases after him, but then notices in a florist shop window a wreath with the sash that says \\"In Memoriam Maximum Leo\\". Inside, he learns that a little man ordered it. Later the little man comes to his office and admits Brissot has \\"the Devil to pay\\". Even though Brissot cannot sell the hand at a loss, the little man offers to buy it back for a sou. Brissot accepts, but then takes it back after Ir√®ne is cold to him. The little man tells him that his offer still holds, but the price doubles every day. Brissot dithers until the 23rd day, but when he tries to pay the current price, he does not have quite enough money. Later, Ir√®ne telephones, telling him she has the money he needs, but is murdered before he can get to her. Ange tells him to try a roulette system at the casino in Monte Carlo, but the little man shows up, and his lucky streak ends just before he can win the sum he needs. When he returns to his hotel, he is met by all the previous owners of the hand: a royal musketeer, a cutpurse, a juggler, an illusionist, a surgeon, his assistant (who became a boxer), and finally the chef. They tell him their tales. The little man appears, followed by the man to whom the hand belongs. Maximus Leo was born in 1422. His hand was supremely gifted, but he chose to become a monk. The little man was only able to obtain the hand by stealing it from the monk's tomb. Therefore, as Maximus Leo states, all the bargains are invalid, since the little man cannot sell what does not rightfully belong to him. After the defeated little man leaves, Maximus Leo asks Brissot to return the hand to his tomb. Returning to the present, Brissot spots the little man outside and gives chase. They fight atop the ruins of the abbey, and Brissot is sent tumbling to his death. He lands on top of a tomb. The casket is found empty nearby, and the tomb's inscription reads \\"Maximus Leo\\".

It was built in the early 1860s for Alexander Raff. It is also known as Grange Hill and St Teresa's Church Discalced Carmelite Priory & Retreat Centre. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 September 1995.  History  Alexander Raff Grangehill is a substantial stone house which was constructed in the early 1860s, as the family home of Alexander Raff, a prominent member of Brisbane society and a later Member of the Queensland Legislative Council. Alexander Raff was born in Forres, Elginshire, Scotland in July 1820, as the third son of James and Margaret Raff. Alexander arrived in New South Wales in 1845, following his eldest brother, George who had arrived in 1841. After first settling in Victoria pursuing pastoral interests, Alexander arrived in Brisbane, aboard the Souvenir schooner on April 9, 1851. Alexander Raff was an active member of various organisations and societies, including the Brisbane School of Arts, where he was elected Treasurer in January 1854; the Pilot's Board; the Queensland Horticultural and Agricultural Society and the Queensland Philosophical Society, in both of which he acted as Treasurer during the 1860s. Raff was the first president of the Young Men's Christian Association in Queensland. Other organisations of which he was a member include the Queensland Steam Navigation Company; the Board of National Education pending the passing of the Education Act in 1860; and, later, the men's steering committee for the Brisbane Children's Hospital established in 1878. Alexander was a director of the Scottish Mutual Land and Mortgage Company; the Agricultural Company; the Brisbane Gas Company and National Mutual Life Association. Alexander continued his pastoral interests in Queensland, on his property, Logie Plains on the Darling Downs. For many years from the 1880s Alexander Raff was a partner of Smellie and Co, looking after the financial interests of the company. Raff was an elder in the Presbyterian Church. In 1865 Alexander was appointed to the position of Official Assignee of Insolvent Estates and in 1868 he was promoted to the position of Curator of Intestate Estates. The Official Assignee was responsible for collecting the assets of an insolvent debtor and distributing them among the creditors; the Curator of Intestate Estates administered the estate of deceased persons, thought to have died intestate. In August 1884 Alexander Raff was appointed to the Queensland Legislative Council, a position he held until his resignation in June, 1910. Raff married Elizabeth Millar Patterson, the elder daughter of a prominent Scottish medical family, in Sydney on June 5, 1862. The newly weds arrived in Brisbane aboard the Balclutha on June 13, 1862. Alexander Raff purchased two blocks of land on what was to become Gregory Terrace on May 14, 1860 for . A third adjacent block was subsequently bought by Raff in 1864 from the original 1860 purchaser, John Frederick McDougall. The first mention of Raff's occupation of Grangehill, is upon the birth of their first child, Jessie Watson, on the 18 April 1863, where Grangehill is nominated as the family home. It is presumed that Raff built the house after the purchase of land in 1860. Although the architect is unknown, a possible candidate would be James Cowlishaw, who designed a store for Alexander's brother's company, George Raff and Co in 1862 and later, in 1864, additions to Raff's Wharf in Brisbane. Cowlishaw is also thought to have been a personal friend of the Raffs. During the late 1860s and early 1870s, Raff sold land on the Warry Street side of the block, and re-purchased it by 1874. In 1879 both John Petrie and Augustus Gregory built substantial family homes on property on Gregory Terrace previously purchased by them in the sale of 1860. By 1883 Warry Street had been extended north to Gregory Terrace, onto Raff's allotment 258. Alexander and Elizabeth Raff had seven children, six of whom survived to adulthood. In August 1893, one of the daughters, Margaret Cumming Raff, married Mr T.C. Woolnough, in a ceremony held at Grangehill. It is thought that during the 1880s or 1890s a verandah was added to both stories of three sides of the house, and that bay windows were added to four of the principal entrance elevation. On Alexander's death on January 26, 1914, the house was left in trust to his eldest son, James, who enabled the Red Cross to use it after the First World War as a convalescent home. In 1924 Brisbane architects, Chambers and Ford, designed additions to Grangehill, converting the house into two flats, one of which James Raff moved into for a short time. These additions included a wing on the north west which housed a kitchen and laundry, and the closing of sections of the verandah for use as bathrooms. A new entrance to Grangehill was planned from Gregory Terrace, through the new wing. By 1929, the Grangehill property was subdivided, when a Dr Henry Joseph Windsor is listed as living on the Warry Street corner of the property, in a timber house also designed by Chambers and Ford. On the Brunswick Street side of the property is a block of six flats which survive in 1995. From 1929, the two flats at Grangehill were let to a Mr Edward Kivas Tully and a PJ Teeley, who remained there until Mrs Adele Magnum is listed as running a boarding house from Grangehill for about two years from 1939. According to family history, Grangehill was then used by American soldiers in the Second World War. James Raff died in 1939, leaving the house in trust to his nephew, James Cluny Raff. In 1949 the property was offered for sale by James Cluny Raff, and passed out of the family who had owned it since 1860. The auction notice for this sale notes a substantial wooden cottage on the block, no longer extant. The Discalced Carmelite Fathers purchased Grangehill in March 1950, and it has remained their headquarters and retreat centre until 1995. The Fathers made alterations to the house between 1965 and 1970. These included the demolition of the 1924 kitchen wing, and its replacement with another wing, the removal of the first floor bay windows, and the addition of some interior arch screens. A later addition saw the erection of a retreat centre abutting the south east side of the house. Subsequently, the Carmelite community in Brisbane met at a number of temporary locations until the Carmelite nuns at Ormiston built a meeting place called Avila on their grounds.  Description  Grangehill, a two-storeyed Brisbane tuff and sandstone residence with a hipped corrugated iron roof, is located on an elevated position above Gregory Terrace to the northwest and has views over the surrounding suburbs of Fortitude Valley, Bowen Hills and Herston. The roof, consisting of U-shaped hips with a central box gutter, has a raised central skylight and two rendered chimney stacks with cornice detailing. The building has verandahs to the northeast and southeast, with the ground floor of the southeast verandah having been removed during 1960s extensions (retreat centre), and northwest verandah having been removed for the 1950s extensions. The verandahs have cast iron balustrade panels with timber rails, chamfered timber verandah posts, and a rendered masonry base. The ground floor has an arched boarded timber valance with timber lattice panels above, which have been covered over with weatherboard, and the second floor has a raked ceiling lined with hardboard sheets with timber cover strips. The first floor of the southeast verandah has been enclosed with glass louvres. The central entry projects slightly from the verandah and has paired corner posts, a timber arch to the ground floor, and sandstone steps, and was originally surmounted by a pediment which is no longer extant. The ground floor verandah walls are of coursed Brisbane tuff with dressed hammer-faced sandstone quoining to the main entry. The central entry, which has a panelled timber door with glass sidelights and fanlight assembly with the name GRANGEHILL in the fanlight, is surrounded by vermiculated sandstone quoining and is flanked by bay windows to either side which projects from the face of the wall. These bays have tall sash windows, with the southern bay incorporating a multi-paned glass door. The first floor verandah walls are finished in scribed render, and had similar early bays which have been removed, but evidence of their form can be seen in the verandah floor boards and ceiling sheeting. The southern bay has been replaced with a sliding aluminium framed glass door, and the northern bay has been replaced with a pair of timber framed French doors. The rear of the building has mostly coursed hammer-faced sandstone with quoining to the corners and an expressed band at first floor level. Windows are multi-paned sashes, with a tall arched sash window at mid-floor level to the stair landing. Striped metal awnings and a brick rear entry lean-to have been added recently. The two- storeyed northwest extension replaced the original two-storeyed verandah and attached kitchen, and consists of a rendered masonry structure with a corrugated iron gable roof and a large crucifix in relief on the northwest wall. Windows are metal framed casements, and a crucifix is affixed to the gable apex. The southeast extension (retreat centre) consists of a two- storeyed U-shaped brick structure with a flat ribbed sheet metal roof. One side of the U-shaped structure replaced the southeast ground floor verandah, with the central section spanning over a driveway, and the southern side incorporating a sub-floor level. Internally, the building has plastered masonry walls, ceilings, cornices and picture rails, and cedar joinery (some of which is painted) including panelled doors, architraves, corniced panels above doorheads, skirtings and staircase. The ground floor of the building has a central entrance hall with a large room to either side. The entrance hall has an arch, leading to a wider rear hall, with plastered extrados and imposts and a glass panel with the word CLOISTER. The northern room has an ornate plaster ceiling pendant and pendant light fitting, and a marble fireplace surround with tile inserts and cast iron screen. The southern room has a plaster ceiling pendant and a wide arch dividing the room in two, with two side doorways (originally with French doors opening to a verandah) which have painted glass fanlights each consisting of landscape scenes in sepia tones. The room originally had a white marble fireplace surround which has been removed. The rear hall has two rooms opening to either side, with the northwest room having undergone a number of changes and now has timber framed glass doors within an original archway, and a partition wall of arches forming a central hallway. The rear hall has a painted half-turn with landings staircase with turned balustrade and square newel posts. The first floor has a central hall with an arch, which has plastered extrados and imposts, opening to three front rooms. The northern room has been partitioned to create two rooms with a corridor at the rear accessing the northwest extension. A bathroom, which has been recently refitted, is located centrally and is lit by a skylight. An early storage cupboard adjacent to the bathroom retains the only section of pressed metal ceiling to the first floor. The northwest extension has a kitchen, laundry and bathroom to the ground floor, with a staircase accessing the first floor which houses bathrooms and bedrooms. The southeast extension (retreat centre) has a chapel, confessionals, seminar room and bedrooms to the first floor, bedrooms and garages to the ground floor, and bedrooms to the sub-floor level. The building is accessed off Gregory Terrace via a curved driveway with turning circle. The grounds include two large Fig trees to the east of the driveway, and several substantial Umbrella and Camphor Laurel trees. A stone embankment wall is located along the Gregory Terrace alignment.  Heritage listing  Grangehill was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 September 1995 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Grangehill is illustrative of the residential development of Spring Hill during the nineteenth century. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The house is one of the earliest surviving in Brisbane and as such a rare extant example of a substantial 1860s stone residence. Internal fittings which are early and rare include the lower floor ceiling roses, the lower floor ceiling with associated cornice, the painted glass transom windows and timber joinery. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Though it was extended at various times, the building retains a substantial amount of original fabric and is representative of a large early Victorian era residence. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Located on an elevated position, the building and grounds, including the driveway, landscaped grounds and stone embankment wall, make a substantial contribution to the amenity of the Gregory Terrace streetscape and Spring Hill townscape. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Grangehill, a two storied stone residence constructed in Spring Hill in the early 1860s by prominent Brisbane businessman and pastoralist, Alexander Raff, has associations with the Raff family, who were instrumental in establishing various Brisbane businesses and institutions. Grangehill was purchased by the Discalced Carmelite Fathers in 1950, and retains important associations with the order as their Queensland headquarters and Retreat Centre.

The Germans had threatened strict reprisals on the populace for any attacks on their troops: 40 citizens for every officer and 20 for every soldier.

They were shot against a wall located at the site of the Mausoleum. Those killed included individuals of all ages, both sexes, and diverse lines of work. The Mausoleum was erected in 1949, with commission given to Pietro Porcinai (1910-1986). The original plan was a simple and sober mausoleum circumscribed by 40 slender cypress trees.

The deposit was found in the mid-1950s by the then Geological Survey of Tanganyika (now Tanzania). Niobium ore occurs largely in pyrochlore bearing sovite (carbonatite composed largely of calcite) and dolmite-rich carbonatite. The deposit also contains lesser phosphate mineralisation associated with apatite.  History  Panda Hill was first developed for niobium in the late 1950s and early 1960s by the then N. V. Billiton. A pilot mill and small open pit mine operated from 1957 to 1960 that produced concentrate that was then shipped to the Netherlands for further processing. The deposit is currently under development by Cradle Resources to mine niobium by open pit mining methods. The project has reported resources of 96 million tonnes of mineralisation at an average grade of 0.52% Nb2O5. If successful the Panda Hill niobium deposit will be the first niobium mine in Africa.

Early life Osifekunde was from Epe, Ijebu Ode but was born in Makun, a suburb of Sagamu in about 1795. His father was Adde Sonlou, an Ijebu warrior who fled Makun as a result of a skirmish resulting in the death of another warrior. In addition to time in Epe as a result of his father Sonlou's asylum, Osifekunde spent time in the Kingdom of Benin. Osifekunde's grandfather was Ochi-Wo who held the office of Ladeke. Victim of the Trans Atlantic Slave Trade Osifekunde was about 20 years old (approximately 1810) when Ijaw pirates captured him in the Niger Delta lagoon and sold him to Brazilian slave merchants. Meeting with Pascal d'Avezac-Macaya in Paris About 20 years after Osifekunde was forcibly transferred to Brazil, he accompanied his master (one Mr. Navarre) to Paris where he was employed as a servant and went by the names 'Joaquim' and 'Joseph'. In Paris he happened upon Pascal d'Avezac-Macaya, an ethnographer and vice-president of the Soci√©t√© Ethnologique de Paris, who had a keen interest in Africa. Pascal d'Avesac-Macaya interviewed Osifekunde (in pidgin Portuguese since Osifekunde spoke little or no French at the time) for weeks and Osifekunde's recollection of Ijebu Ode and Lagos (published by Pascal d'Avezac-Macay in 1845) became an important addition to European knowledge of the Guinea Coast. Pascal d'Avesac-Macaya arranged for Osifekunde to move to Sierra Leone (then a British colony established as a home for captives liberated by the West Africa Squadron) but Osifekunde didn't take the offer and according to P.C. Lloyd \\"preferred servitude under his former master in Brazil, where he could be with his own son\\". There are no accounts of Osifekunde after his chance encounter with Pascal d'Avezac-Macaya. Seemingly frustrated by the transient nature of his encounter with Osifekunde, Pascal d'Avezac-Macay wrote: > Let me bring these disconnected pages to a close, a hasty collection of > incomplete data drawn from an unexpected source [Osifekunde] and one that > too soon became silent.

Robison was one of the earliest female vocalists of a rock band, and she was involved in other acts after the group's disbandment, including the musical Hair.Liner notes of The Great Conspiracy Biography =Beginnings= Barbara \\"Sandi\\" Robison was born October 14, 1945 as Barbara Jeane Moyer in Las Vegas, Nevada. Robison's parents died when she was young so, throughout her childhood, Robison was raised by her grandparents in the small town of Lagunitas, California. She sang in her local high school's chorus assembly. By her early teens, she also sang in her local church, and had the ability to perform in multiple genres including folk, pop, and rock. =Early career= Toward the latter part of high school, Robison gravitated toward the folk music scene. She met contemporaries like David Crosby, Dino Valenti, and future husband Robbie Robison, who was later a part of the band Clear Light. In 1963, at the age of 18, she married Robbie Robison and moved to Los Angeles where she began performing with him as a duo. A year later, future PBC member John Merrill met Barbara Robison after a gig in The Insomniac, located in Hermosa Beach. He proposed that she join his group, which included bassist Jim Cherniss, in recording a single. Robison accepted, and she made her recording debut in January 1965 by providing backing vocals to the folk-rock single that included \\"Love Her Everyday\\" b/w \\"Or Else You'll Cry\\" under the group name The Young Swingers. Their next single, recorded in April 1965, placed Robison at lead vocals. The single included \\"Wind's Up High\\" b/w \\"Let's Take Our Love\\". In 1965, Alan Brackett joined; a drummer named Doug Rowe was added but soon replaced by Spencer Dryden. From this point on, the five piece band was called \\"The Ashes\\". The Ashes were able to obtain a steady gig at the Waleback club in Santa Monica in October 1965. Robison, only 20, needed a borrowed ID to enter the club. She went under the alias \\"Sandi Moon\\" and was commonly addressed as such; she was later even credited as \\"Sandi Peanut Butter\\" on the first two Peanut Butter Conspiracy albums. February 1966 came, and with it The Ashes' first single, called \\"Is There Anything I Can Do?\\" b/w \\"Every Little Prayer\\" on the Vault Records label. It featured Robison on lead vocals. Another single, \\"Dark On You Now\\" b/w \\"Roses Gone\\" followed with Robison on vocals again, but neither of their singles made much impact outside of Los Angeles. By May 1966, Dryden left to replace Skip Spence of Jefferson Airplane, and \\"Sandi\\" had to call quits in June to soon deliver her child. The Ashes disbanded soon after. Following the birth of her son, Scott Robison, Barbara Robison returned to her music career, starting in September 1966. She, along with Merrill and Brackett, added two more members for their new group including drummer Jim Voigt and guitarist Lance Fent. The Peanut Butter Conspiracy formed by the end of 1966 and was recording by 1967. =The Peanut Butter Conspiracy= The Peanut Butter Conspiracy signed to Columbia Records after sessions with five recording companies. Robison was present and sang lead vocal for their several auditions. They were managed by Gary Usher on their first two albums. In total, the band produced three studio albums between the years 1967 and 1969. These include The Peanut Butter Conspiracy Is Spreading, The Great Conspiracy, and For Children of All Ages. Their albums were examples of psychedelic rock but were largely ignored outside Los Angeles. Within those years the band went through lineup changes, but Robison, along with Merrill and Brackett, remained the core of the group. As on all past material, Robison contributed vocals to the studio recordings. The Peanut Butter Conspiracy charted once on the Billboard Hot 100 with their single \\"It's A Happening Thing\\", which featured Robison sharing vocals in harmonies. It was associated with the flower power era and charted number 93 nationally. This single appeared on their debut album, The Peanut Butter Conspiracy Is Spreading, in 1967. The album itself peaked at number 196, nationally. Although the band never charted again nationally, tracks like \\"Too Many Do\\", which featured Robison, were historical for being one of the first songs to receive airplay even though it was beyond the three-minute conventional track length. Live performances for Robison and the band were opposite to that of their debut album. The group would prolong their songs with guitar solos and they proved to be more experimentally psychedelic. In venues like the Whisky a Go Go and the Fillmore Auditorium, the band opened for groups like Big Brother and the Holding Company and Jefferson Airplane. Live performances proved to be the highlight of the band for the rest of their existence. Robison and her bandmates, however, only ever became a local Los Angeles interest and they broke up in 1970. =Later events= Later in 1970, Robison was involved in multiple soundtracks for movies. Her most prominent work came with her providing backing vocals and main vocal parts, with Lynn Carey of Mama Lion, on six tracks for the soundtrack of the musical melodrama Beyond the Valley of the Dolls. She was included on \\"Find It\\", \\"In The Long Run\\", \\"Sweet Talkin' Candyman\\", \\"Come with the Gentle People\\", and \\"Look Up at the Bottom\\". The song \\"Once I Had Love\\" was mentioned in the film but not heard. It is available on the LP and on a CD (see Discography). Additional work was completed by Robison along with Brackett and Merrill on the 1971 film Jud. It was the first time the ex-bandmates performed together since the band disbanded. While she was working on her soundtrack commitments, Robison joined the Los Angeles counterculture-inspired musical production, Hair. The musical was critically acclaimed and controversial for its profanity, nudity, and the depiction of the use of illegal drugs. She performed in lead roles for an 18-month stint. Robison continued to be involved in sessions of Hair even after she and Merrill began performing as a duo in local clubs. In September 1971, Robison along with Merrill and Brackett joined a covers band named Froggy. The group was based in Pasadena, California in a club called the Handlebar. Returning from jam sessions in early 1972, Robison was seriously injured in a car crash. She was unconscious for four days, but still returned in less than a month to perform with the band again. Robison moved to Glendora, California and formed a band called Rush and began touring in state and in Arizona in mid-1973. This band included keyboardist Ivan Jean. After Rush dissolved, the two became a duo who toured in clubs across the country for years to come. =Death= On April 6, 1988, Robison was performing in Butte, Montana. During her concert, she fell ill and was transported to a hospital in Billings, Montana. Robison did not recover, and died on April 22, 1988 from toxic shock poisoning at the age of 42. In 2014, Al Brackett self- released a compilation album entitled Barbara. The album is a tribute to Robison's career in the years 1966 to 1970 with and without the Peanut Butter Conspiracy.

(lit. Volleyball Sport in the Philippines) is the current national governing body (NSA) for volleyball in the Philippines recognized by the Philippine Olympic Committee (POC), the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC), the Asian Volleyball Confederation (AVC) and the International Volleyball Federation (FIVB). History =Formation= Larong Volleyball sa Pilipinas, Inc. (LVPI) was formed in a restructuring effort by the Philippine Olympic Committee (POC) through their president Peping Cojuangco following a power struggle which emerged at the formerly POC-recognized Philippine Volleyball Federation (PVF) due to two colliding factions between the group of now-PVF president Edgardo \\"Boy\\" Cantada and the group of now-PVF secretary general Karl Chan and now-PVF managing director Otie Camangian but it was later reconciled and united. LVPI was formed together with four of the Manila-based major stakeholders - the UAAP, the NCAA, the Shakey's V-League/Spikers' Turf (under Sports Vision Management Group, Inc.) and the Philippine Super Liga (under SportsCore Events Management). Provincial stakeholders were snubbed for joining the LVPI due to current alignment with the PVF. The POC withdrew its recognition of the PVF when it learned that there are two federations (PVF) for volleyball registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the same name (the old 2005 recognition and the updated 2014 recognition). LVPI was incorporated by POC 1st vice-president, Team Philippines Chef de Mission for the 2016 Rio Olympics and Asian Volleyball Confederation Board Member Joey Romasanta, POC (and University of Perpetual Help System) official Ret. Army Col. Jeff Tamayo, POC legal counsel Atty. Ramon Malinao, POC official Marine B/Gen. Benjamin \\"Chippy\\" Espiritu, and former Ateneo de Manila University athletics director and Sports Vision president Richard Palou with the intent of replacing PVF as the national sport association for volleyball in the Philippines. The POC received a letter dated January 27, 2014 from the FIVB indicating that it is giving provisional membership to the newly formed LVPI. The FIVB required LVPI to hold an election not before February 15, 2015. LVPI was introduced to the public during the opening day of the 2015 season of the Philippine Super Liga and also during the drawing of the lots for the 2015 Asian U23 Women's Volleyball Championship last March 6, 2015, despite the backlash by the current PVF president Cantada against the forming of the new volleyball NSA by the POC. Cantada claimed that the PVF is still the recognized NSA for volleyball in the country, and that the withdrawal of the recognition of the PVF by the POC is illegal and not due process. Romasanta, together with former Philippine Amateur Volleyball Association (PAVA, the predecessor of the PVF) president Victorico \\"Concoy\\" Chaves, leads the executive board of LVPI, together with Palou, Ariel Paredes, Tamayo, Peter Cayco, Ramon \\"Choy\\" Cojuangco Jr., and Sherwin Malonzo, among others in the presence of AVC secretary general Shanrit Wongsaprert and AVC development and marketing chairman Ramon Suzara. The first order of business for the group after their formal recognition to the AVC, is the payment of the 3 million peso debt ($80,000 from FIVB and $10,000 from Thailand Volleyball Association) of the former PAVA administration (under Roger Banzuela, which Palou and Suzara were members of the PAVA board) to the FIVB during the Manila's hosting of the 2005 Grand Prix. On April 23, 2015, the PVF filed a temporary restraining order and petition for preliminary mandatory injunction against the LVPI citing the group's \\"malicious intent\\" against the PVF. A decision was set to be issued before the end of the year. In a meeting held last May 12, 2015, presided by FIVB President Ary Graca, the FIVB officially gave its full recognition to the LVPI as the legitimate and exclusive authority for volleyball in the Philippines (without given time to the general assembly), Former FIVB and AVC president Wei Jizhong was part in witnessing the formation and given recognition for LVPI by the international governing bodies. On July 29, 2015, the POC issued their letter of recognition to the LVPI as regular member of the local Olympic body in compliance to the requirements of the Membership and Accreditation Committee. =Developments= LVPI sent different teams (with different players compositions and coaches) to represent the Philippines in all competitions within 2015 (except the Asian Men's Seniors where they backed out due to lack of funds), including the Asian Men's U23 and Asian Women's U23, Asian's Women's Seniors, 2015 SEA Games (comeback after 10 years) and the 2015 VTV Cup, which the PVF's Amihan and Bagwis program have planned to play before the LVPI intervened. Those teams were disbanded by the LVPI management due to its poor performance in the competitions. The organization also supported the Cignal HD Spikers and Petron Blaze Spikers on their stints in the 2015 Asian Men's and Women's Club Volleyball Championships. LVPI has partnered with the Philippine Marines 7th Marine Brigade (Reserve) to organize volleyball clinics in South Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat and Sitangkai, Tawi-Tawi towards peace and development but it is under drawing stages. In October 2015, LVPI together with the FIVB conducted a level 2 coaching seminar instructed by course director Shanwen Zhao of China and course instructor Razieh ‚ÄúSamira‚Äù Seifzadeh of Iran at the Arellano University Gym, attended by 12 volleyball coaches, including Oliver Almadro of Ateneo Men's Team and Kung Fu Reyes of the UST and Philippine Army Women's teams as preparation for the formation of the coaches commission to be headed by LVPI board member Ramon Malinao. In December 2015, the LVPI also sent four representatives, Anna Tomas, Kyle Principe, Abac Cordero and Marc Anthony Reyes, to the inaugural AVC Press Seminar held in Bangkok, Thailand. Among its plans for 2016 were the formation of the commissions for coaches, referees and the athletes and looking for private sponsors to fund the national team and other projects within the scope of LVPI. The organization also focused on the formation of the permanent national team training pool that will restrict players (initially, from 19 years old below - for the Asian U19 and possibly, the FIVB U19 championships) for playing in too many leagues and exhibition games, this will be patterned to the Gilas Cadets program of the SBP and the expansion of their activities to the provinces. Eventually, some of the U19 players will compete also in the 2017 SEA Games and the Asian Seniors. President Romasanta confirmed that the PSL will support the formation of the national pool. It will also use the Arellano University Gym in Pasay City, as their main office (from its original location in POC office in Pasig) and the national training center for the LVPI-formed national volleyball teams. It will also serve as a venue for different events and seminars for referees and coaches. LVPI has also appointed managing director Benjamin Espiritu to oversee the adjustments in the volleyball calendar between the four stakeholders of the federation starting in 2016. Top LVPI officials Romasanta, Palou, Cayco and Suzara went to the AVC Congress 2015 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in November 2015 to formally sealed the hosting rights of the 2016 Asian Women's Club Volleyball Championships in Manila and the appointment of Romasanta as the board member, and re-election of Suzara as the Development and Marketing Chairman. AVC has also offered the hosting rights to the Philippines for the 2017 Asian Seniors Women's Volleyball Championship. In 2016, the BEST Center's Women's Volleyball League was officially accredited as a stakeholder of LVPI. Also in the same year, the Beach Volleyball Republic officially gets pivotal support from the organization after the successful staging of its Nationwide Tour, the National Championships and the Invitationals held in Anguib Beach, Cagayan on June 2016. =Controversies= In a board meeting held in July 2015, LVPI secretary-general Ricky Palou was cited and accused of misrepresenting himself as LVPI President in documents submitted to the FIVB and AVC. In these documents, he sought permission from both bodies to form a beach volleyball tournament without the consent of LVPI board. He was also accused of sealing deals with Solar Sports to cover this event, again without the knowledge and consent of the LVPI board. Palou also insisted on sending the Ateneo Lady Eagles in the 28th SEA Games, instead of the newly formed team with players from 4 stakeholders (as approved by Romasanta). He also instigated the protest against Indonesia's April Manganang over claims of being a hermaphrodite. Palou was also responsible in sending the wrong team roster sent to the Asian Women's Senior Championships in May 2015, as well as the appointments of Roger Gorayeb and Nes Pamiliar as coaches, replacing Thai coach Anusorn Bundit, for the national team in the 2015 VTV Cup, again without the permission of the board. In a caucus, Palou pointed out his assistant Sherwin Malonzo as responsible to the mess. The LVPI board has since decided to honor the deal brokered between Palou and Solar Sports in order to avoid facing legal charges. In October 2015, PVF President Cantada, condemned the act of the LVPI and Score (headed by Ramon Suzara, the president of PSL, and one of the masterminds in the withdrawal of recognition of PVF in the POC, AVC, and FIVB) over the incident involving 12 imports of the Philippine Super Liga Grand Prix who have gone through the immigration process and play in the league without any necessary working permits and other documents for foreigners who will work in the country. He also criticized LVPI and Suzara for blatant disregard and abuse of the Philippine immigration and labor laws over the incident. On October 2016, the LVPI was retained as the National Sports Association for Volleyball in the Philippines as the FIVB started their probe on the expulsion of the Philippine Volleyball Federation, which is one of the main topics of the 35th FIVB World Congress in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The results of the investigation will be released in two years' time during the 37th FIVB World Congress, according to LVPI President Romasanta.

He became known in 1919 during the First Red Scare as Paivio and his fellow anarchist Gust Alonen were convicted of \\"criminal anarchy\\" for writing in a radical newspaper. Paivio and Alonen were the first activists convicted in the State of New York for violating the Criminal Anarchy law, although it was passed already in 1902 right after the assassination of the president William McKinley.  Life  Paivio was born in T√∂ys√§, and emigrated to the United States as an illegal immigrant at the age of 22. He sailed from Finland via Australia as a crew member of a Finnish merchant ship and boarded Seattle in the fall of 1915. December 1917 Paivio moved to New York City and joined the syndicalist trade union Industrial Workers of the World. He was a member of the Finnish IWW local in the Bronx. It was known as a radical splinter group within the IWW, opposing all centralized power or centralized organization. The group was publishing a Finnish language anarchist paper called Luokkataistelu (The Class Struggle), Paivio was the editor and Gust Alonen worked as the co-editor. The Lusk Committee raided the IWW Manhattan headquarters on 21 June 1919 and found several copies of the Luokkataistelu paper. The committee was interested on the article ‚Ä≥The Activity of the Rioting Masses‚Ä≥ published in the March edition. Content of this article finally brought Paivio and Alonen the charges of criminal anarchy. The article included the often quoted lines:Cashman, Sean Dennis: America Ascendant: From Theodore Roosevelt to FDR in the Century of American Power, 1901-1945. p. 176. New York University Press, New York, NY, 1998. . Paivio and Alonen were arrested in August and the trial started on 6 October. On 28 October 1919 Supreme Court Justice Bartow S. Weeks sentenced them to prison terms of from four to eight years for \\"criminal anarchy\\". The court also called for the deportation of Paivio and Alonen when their sentences expired, but it was never executed. Carl Paivio was released from Clinton Prison in 1923. He continued his activities in several leftist organizations, but according to the autobiography of Elizabeth Gurley Flynn Paivio later moved from anarchism towards communism. He became the national secretary of the Communist Party afflicted Finnish America Mutual Aid Society and was also employed by the International Workers Order. Through the 1930s and 1940s Paivio was a prominent leftist political organizer, lecturer and instructor. During the Second Red Scare led by United States Senator Joseph McCarthy Paivio was held for deportation under the McCarran‚ÄìWalter Act and kept on Ellis Island, but he died there before he was deported to Finland.

He was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Council.  Early life  Raff was born in Forres, Elginshire, Scotland, in July 1820, as the third son of James and Margaret Raff. Raff arrived in New South Wales in 1845, following his eldest brother, George Raff, who had arrived in 1841. After first settling in Victoria pursuing pastoral interests, Raff arrived in Brisbane, aboard the Souvenir schooner on 9 April 1851. Queensland years Raff purchased two blocks of land on what was to become Gregory Terrace in Spring Hill on 14 May 1860 for ¬£312.4.3. A third adjacent block was subsequently bought by Raff in 1864 from the original 1860 purchaser, John Frederick McDougall. In January 1861, Raff was seriously injured when he was thrown from his horse. Raff married Elizabeth Millar Patterson, the elder daughter of a prominent Scottish medical family, in Sydney on 5 June 1862. The newly-weds arrived in Brisbane aboard the Balclutha on 13 June 1862. Raff and his wife Elizabeth had seven children, six of whom survived to adulthood. At some point prior to the birth of his first child, Jessie Watson, on 18 April 1863, the now heritage-listed house Grangehill was built on the Gregory Terrace site and occupied by Raff's family. In 1865 Raff was appointed to the position of Official Assignee of Insolvent Estates, and in 1868 he was promoted to the position of Curator of Intestate Estates. The Official Assignee was responsible for collecting the assets of an insolvent debtor and distributing them among the creditors; the Curator of Intestate Estates administered the estate of deceased persons, thought to have died intestate. Raff continued his pastoral interests in Queensland, on his property, Logie Plains on the Darling Downs. For many years from the 1880s, Raff was a partner of Smellie and Co, looking after the financial interests of the company. In August 1884 Raff was appointed to the Queensland Legislative Council. Raff was an active member of various organisations and societies, including the Brisbane School of Arts, where he was elected treasurer in January 1854; the Pilot's Board; the Queensland Horticultural and Agricultural Society and the Queensland Philosophical Society, in both of which he acted as treasurer during the 1860s. Raff was the first president of the Young Men's Christian Association in Queensland. Other organisations of which he was a member include the Queensland Steam Navigation Company; the Board of National Education pending the passing of the Education Act in 1860; and, later, the men's steering committee for the Brisbane Children's Hospital established in 1878. Raff was a director of the Scottish Mutual Land and Mortgage Company; the Agricultural Company; the Brisbane Gas Company and National Mutual Life Association. Raff was an elder in the Presbyterian Church. Later life Raff retired from the legislative council on 10 June 1910 (he was approaching his 90th birthday). Raff died on 26 January 1914. He was buried in the Toowong CemeteryRaff Alexander -- Brisbane City Council Grave Location Search. Retrieved 28 March 2015. on 27 January 1914.

Pyomo was developed by William Hart and Jean-Paul Watson at Sandia National Laboratories and David Woodruff at University of California, Davis. Significant extensions to Pyomo were developed by Bethany Nicholson and John Siirola at Sandia National Laboratories, Carl Laird at Purdue University, and Gabriel Hackebeil. Pyomo is an open-source project that is freely available, and it is licensed with the BSD license. Pyomo is developed as part of the COIN-OR project. Pyomo is a popular open-source software package that is used by a variety of government agencies and academic institutions. Features Pyomo allows users to formulate optimization problems in Python in a manner that is similar to the notation commonly used in mathematical optimization. Pyomo supports an object-oriented style of formulating optimization models, which are defined with a variety of modeling components: sets, scalar and multidimensional parameters, decision variables, objectives, constraints, equations, disjunctions and more. Optimization models can be initialized with python data, and external data sources can be defined using spreadsheets, databases, various formats of text files. Pyomo supports both abstract models, which are defined without data, and concrete models, which are defined with data. In both cases, Pyomo allows for the separation of model and data. Pyomo supports dozens of solvers, both open source and commercial, including many solvers supported by AMPL, PICO, CBC, CPLEX, IPOPT, Gurobi and GLPK. Pyomo can either invoke the solver directly or asynchronous with a solver manager. Solver managers support remote, asynchronous execution of solvers, which supports parallel execution of Pyomo scripts. Solver interaction is performed with a variety of solver interfaces, depending on the solver being used. A very generic solver interface is supported with AMPL's nl (format). Related software The following software packages integrate Pyomo as a library to support optimization modeling and analysis: * SolverStudio lets you use Excel to edit, save and solve optimisation models built using a variety of modeling languages, including Pyomo. Pyomo is bundled with the SolverStudio software. * TEMOA (Tools for Energy Model Optimization and Assessment) is an open source modeling framework for conducting energy system analysis. The core component of TEMOA is an energy economy optimization model. This model is formulated and optimized using Pyomo. * MinPower is an open source toolkit for students and researchers in power systems. It is designed to make working with standard power system models simple and intuitive. MinPower uses Pyomo to formulate and optimize these power system models.

It was originally built in the 1860s with a new wing added in 1882 designed by Andrea Stombuco. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 May 2004.  History  The earliest section of Mountview House, a two-storeyed stone residence, is believed to have been erected in the 1860s for Brisbane foreman carpenter Daniel McNaught. A two-storeyed brick wing designed by architect Andrea Stombuco was added in 1882, when the house was converted into a preparatory school for boys. This part of Spring Hill was surveyed officially into suburban allotments in 1856, but was soon subdivided for closer residential settlement by speculative landowners. Along with Kangaroo Point and Petrie Terrace, Spring Hill was among the earliest of Brisbane's dormitory suburbs, attracting wealthier residents to the high land along the ridges, and the less affluent to the hollows in between: Hanly's Hollow (between Wickham Terrace and Leichhardt Street), Spring Hollow (between Leichhardt Street and Gregory Terrace), and York's Hollow (to the north of Gregory Terrace - an area occupied by a number of brick-makers in the 1850s and 1860s, now Victoria Park). The site on which Mountview House is located was part of a larger parcel of land (suburban portions 177 and 178, parish of North Brisbane - totalling just over ) with a frontage to Leichhardt Street, purchased from the Crown by Brisbane draper Richard Ash Kingsford in November 1856 at a sale of Villa Allotments at Hanley's Valley, Brisbane. In the early 1860s this property was surveyed into 18 residential allotments and a wide road, later known as Downing Street. In January 1863, Daniel McNaught of Brisbane purchased from Kingsford subdivisions 1 & 2 of suburban portion 178 (), at the corner of Leichhardt and Downing streets, located on the highest ground in Spring Hill. By September that year, McNaught had taken out a mortgage on this property, from fellow Spring Hill resident, Robert Bourne. It is possible this helped finance the construction of Mountview House. Daniel McNaught, a Dumbarton and Glasgow-trained carpenter, and his wife Barbara Ure, were amongst the first wave of Scottish immigrants to Queensland, arriving at Moreton Bay via the immigrant ship Artemisia in late 1848. For three years in the early 1850s Daniel prospected on the New South Wales goldfields, but in 1855 returned to Brisbane where he worked for his brother-in-law, businessman and contractor John Petrie (his sister, Jane Keith McNaught, had married John Petrie in Queensland in 1850). From the early 1860s McNaught was manager of Petrie's joinery works, and as foreman carpenter supervised the finishing of many of Petrie's most significant construction projects, including Parliament House, the Supreme Court, the Brisbane Hospital and the Brisbane Gaol on Petrie Terrace. Like many of the early Scottish immigrants, Daniel McNaught was active in local politics in the 1850s, opposing the re-introduction of convict labour and working for the separation of Queensland from New South Wales. He was a prominent and long-term member of the Wharf Street Congregational Church, a director of the City and Suburban Building Society from its inception, and a Magistrate of the colony. It is thought that John Petrie constructed and/or designed Mountview House for the McNaughts in the 1860s, possibly initially as an investment rather than as their home, as Daniel McNaught, carpenter, is recorded as resident in Creek Street in the 1868 and 1874 Post Office Directories. However, the McNaugths were resident at their Leichhardt Street property in 1876, the year in which Mrs McNaught died. By this year also a small timber cottage had been erected at the rear of Mountview House, fronting Downing Street [No.8], which was occupied by their son John Ure McNaught, a Queen Street bookseller and stationer. By 1878 Daniel McNaught had moved into the cottage, and Mountview House was occupied by Presbyterian minister Rev. JF McSwaine. In 1880 Daniel McNaught took out two mortgages on his Spring Hill property, totalling , and from 1 August 1881 Sarah Cargill held a five-year lease on Mountview House, which she ran as a boys' preparatory school. In January 1882, title to the property [which included both Mountview House and 8 Downing Street] was transferred from McNaught to Mrs Rebecca Thorn, who honoured the lease with Sarah Cargill. It is likely Mrs Thorn commissioned the 1882 additions to Mountview House, designed by Brisbane architect Andrea Stombuco, for Sarah Cargill's Boys' Preparatory School. By 1883, Daniel McNaught had left Downing Street, and at his death in 1891, aged 67 years, was resident at Edgar Cottage in Amelia Street, Fortitude Valley. In 1890 Rebecca Thorn sold off at the rear of Mountview House, containing No.8 Downing Street, retaining Mountview House on . By this year, Mrs Mary Glandford was utilising Mountview House as a boarding-house, and the building continued in this function for several decades. Following Rebecca Thorn's death in 1916, Mountview House was transferred by her devisees to Joseph O'Donnell of Brisbane, who established a motor garage at the corner of Leichhardt and Downing streets (33 Leichhardt Street), and occupied Mountview House as his private residence. He may also have continued to operate the place as a boarding house. In 1937 O'Donnell sold the property to James Walter Cloughley and Miss Annie Ellen Cloughley, both of whom in 1938 also acquired title to 8 Downing Street - the subdivision from the Mountview House grounds sold by Mrs Thorn in 1890. Under the Cloughleys, Mountview House functioned as a tenement building. In 1954 they sold 8 Downing Street and in late 1955 transferred Mountview House to the principal partners in the Brisbane architectural firm of Ford Hutton and Newell - Peter Edward Newell, Theodore Bernhard Hutton, Neville Henry Lund and Bruce Donald Paulsen - who refurbished the building as offices. Since the 1970s the building has served as both residence and professional offices.  Description  Located on a prominent ridge in Spring Hill, one of Brisbane's oldest residential suburbs, Mountview house is a two-storeyed stone and brick building with two-storeyed verandahs on three sides. Situated on a corner, facing Leichhardt Street to the north with Downing Street to the west, it is built up to the Leichhardt Street alignment. Side gardens separate the house from Downing Street and the eastern neighbour. The house is raised half a level above Leichhardt Street on a masonry base. It consists of two major parts, the original rectangular planned stone core on the east, abutting a brick extension on the west. A smaller brick wing and other more recent extensions are located on the south side of the building. Due to the angle at which the building faces the Leichardt Street alignment, the front facade steps back at the junction between the stone and brick sections. The stone used appears to be local porphyry, squared and laid in rough courses. The brickwork has been painted. The stone core and western brick extension have separately framed hip roofs clad in painted corrugated iron. A box gutter runs between the two main roofs. A rendered masonry chimney emerges from both roofs. The chimney on the stone core is larger, having multiple flues. The verandahs on the front facade are not continuous due to the stepping back of the western brick wing. The verandah, which wraps around the northern, eastern and southern sides of the stone core, is enclosed with cement sheeting and louvres. An open verandah on the front of the western brick wing is set back from the enclosed verandah, running into the sidewall of the stone core. It has cast iron balustrades, timber posts and a shingle valence between the upper and lower levels. The shingle valence can also be seen built into the enclosed verandah. The verandahs have skill ion roofs that are hipped at the corners and ends. The overhangs on the verandah roofs are wider than those on the main part of the house. Located in the space created by the setback of the brick wing, the front entry stairs are built into the masonry base. The stairs terminate in a small entry porch, a timber framed, flat roofed structure with a timber-battened valence that is attached to the western end of the enclosed verandah. A door opens off the entry porch directly into the stone core of the building. A steel framed stair links the lower level of the open front verandah with the side garden. The brick wall on the western side of the building, the only side without a verandah, has five double hung timber framed windows with six paned sashes. A single storey extension with a brick parapet wall and shallow pitched roof has been built on the southwestern corner of the building. This relatively recent extension abuts an older southern brick wing with a low-pitched hipped roof and projecting corbelled brick bay. An open timber staircase connects the eastern garden with the upper level of the southern verandah. From the entry porch, the front door opens into a wide hallway. The hallway, located in the stone section of the building, contains a staircase that leads to the upper level. In addition to the hallway space, the stone core has two rooms on each level, all containing fireplaces with timber mantelpieces and opening onto the enclosed verandahs. Openings in the thick masonry walls have deep timber reveals and timber architraves. Some timber paneled doors remain but French doors from the openings onto the enclosed verandahs have been removed. The enclosed verandahs have been partly lined with cement sheeting and the stonework walls facing onto the enclosed verandahs have been painted. Access to the western brick extension is directly from the entrance hall. This section of the house consists of a single large room on each level. A fireplace, flanked by double hung windows, is positioned in the centre of the western wall on the lower level. On both levels, a door in the north wall leads to the open north verandahs. Bathroom and laundry facilities have been built into the upper level of the southern verandah. Windows throughout the older part of the building are generally timber framed double hung sashes. Internal walls and ceilings are plastered and painted and floors are generally timber. The brick wing at the rear of Mountview house is accessed from the lower level of the southern verandah. It consists of a single room and contains remnants of a former fireplace. The other additions to the rear of Mountview House include a large kitchen area and storeroom and are of relatively recent construction.  Heritage listing  Mountview House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 13 May 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Mountview House, a s two-storeyed stone residence with 1882 additions, is important in illustrating the evolution of Queensland's history, in particular the pattern of residential settlement in the capital city, Brisbane, in the mid-19th century. It is also important historically for its association with the first wave of Scottish immigrants to Queensland, including the McNaught and Petrie families, and their contribution to the expansion of the colony. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The place has rarity value as one of comparatively few s stone buildings to survive in Queensland and is important in illustrating features of an 1860s residence, including two-storeyed construction in stone, verandahs, fireplaces, a chimney and a hipped roof. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The place has rarity value as one of comparatively few s stone buildings to survive in Queensland and is important in illustrating features of an 1860s residence, including two-storeyed construction in stone, verandahs, fireplaces, a chimney and a hipped roof. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Located high on one of the principal ridges through Spring Hill, the place has landmark value and maintains an important contribution to the streetscape of Leichhardt Street. Additions to the original 1860s core, including the brick wing added by Andrea Stombuco and the entry porch, have been well designed and enhance the aesthetic appeal of Mountview house.

History On May 19, 1862 the surgeon general of the U.S. Army authorized Governor of Rhode Island William Sprague IV to \\"provide suitable accommodations for wounded and sick soldiers\\". Sprague appointed a commission which selected Portsmouth Grove in the Melville section of the town of Portsmouth as the location for the hospital.Rhode Island's Civil War Hospital. Frank L. Grzyb. McFarland and Company, Inc. 2012. pg. 14. The first patients arrived on July 6, 1862.Grzyb. pg. 23. Over the course of the war thousands patients were cared for by the hospital. As a number of patients at the hospital were Union soldiers convicted by court martial and others were Confederate prisoners of war, it was necessary to have guards posted at the hospital. In the early months of the hospital's operation security was provided by units of the Rhode Island Militia - first by the Artillery Company of Newport and later by the First Light Infantry of Providence. In December 1862 a company of volunteers, called the Hospital Guards, was raised under the command of Captain Christopher Blanding. Soldiers who joined the company had to have disabilities or injuries which precluded them from front line service. The company remained at the hospital until it was closed and was mustered out of service on August 25, 1865.Grzyb. pg. 164. An early superintendent of the hospital was Katherine Prescott Wormeley who was a key organizer of the United States Sanitary Commission. Wormeley was inspired by the work of Florence Nightingale during the Crimean War and was highly successful in recruiting nurses to work at the hospital. The hospital was named Lovell General Hospital after Joseph Lovell, who served as the Surgeon General of the United States Army from 1818 to 1836. The hospital was also known as Portsmouth Grove Hospital. The hospital was closed on August 25, 1865.Grzyb. pg. 137. In time, all the buildings of the hospital were either dismantled or removed. There are no remains of the hospital. During the course of the war, over 200 patients died at the hospital. Their remains were originally buried in a cemetery near the hospital but were removed to Cypress Hills National Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York in May 1868.Grzyb. pg. 164. Later use of site In the early 20th Century the hospital site became a coaling station for the Navy. Prior to World War II the Navy converted from coal to oil and the coaling station was converted accordingly. The site of the hospital became a PT boat training base during World War II. John F. Kennedy was one of the hundreds of Navy officers to receive training there. After the Navy greatly reduced its presence in Rhode Island in the 1970s, the site was converted for use by the boating industry. Major commercial enterprises there include Little Harbor Marine, the Bend Boat Basin and the Melville Grille restaurant. Several former America's Cup yachts are stored there during the winter.

Thomas Zimmerman invented the prototype of the DataGlove and began looking for other people to help work on it. The device was using 6502 microcontrollers. Zimmerman met Mitch Altman and asked him to join VPL part-time because Altman knew how to program the microcontrollers. The system was wired to a computer. It was interactive and contained fiber-optic bundles to track movements and orientation. That data would then be transmitted to the computer so that the information could be duplicated virtually. It allowed for people to manipulate and re-orient virtual objects.

The film was released on May 21, 1922, by Paramount Pictures. Plot As described in a film magazine, Sybil Bruce (Ayres) agreed to a marriage with her older drunken and abusive husband George Bruce (Burton) to provide for her invalid sister and young brother. The husband's physician Dr. Robert Acton (Nagel) is regarded as a rival and is not permitted in the house. A will is drafted that stipulates that the wife will forfeit her claim to the husband's wealth if she remarries after his death. When the husband dies, Sybil believes that in failing to provide him his medicine, she had murdered him. The money she inherits allows her to pay for an operation that restores her sister's health. But her sister becomes headstrong and wasteful, and her younger brother follows the same path. Dr. Robert Acton returns, but the sister and brother prevent the natural marriage. There is a big scene at a roadhouse where an aged, former family nurse saves Sybil and tells her that she poisoned the deceased husband. There follows a happy ending with Sybil and the doctor.

He rediscovered the earliest African-American novels, long forgotten, and has published extensively on appreciating African-American literature as part of the Western canon. In addition to producing and hosting previous series on the history and genealogy of prominent American figures, since 2012 Gates has been host of the television series Finding Your Roots on PBS. It combines the work of expert researchers in genealogy, history, and genetics historic research to tell guests about their ancestors' lives and histories. Early life and education Gates was born in Keyser, West Virginia, to Henry Louis Gates Sr. (c.1913‚Äì2010) and his wife Pauline Augusta (Coleman) Gates (1916‚Äì1987). He grew up in neighboring Piedmont. His father worked in a paper mill and moonlighted as a janitor, while his mother cleaned houses, as described in his memoir Colored People (1994). Gates learned through research that his family is descended in part from the Yoruba people of West Africa. He has also learned that he has 50% European ancestry, including Irish forebears; he was surprised his European ancestry turned out to be so substantial. Having grown up in an African-American community, however, he identifies as black. He has learned that he is also connected to the multiracial West Virginia community of Chestnut Ridge people. At the age of 14, Gates was injured playing touch football, fracturing the ball and socket joint of his hip, resulting in a slipped capital femoral epiphysis. The injury was misdiagnosed by a physician, who told Gates' mother that his problem was psychosomatic. When the physical damage finally healed, his right leg was two inches shorter than his left. Because of the injury, Gates now uses a cane when he walks.Contemporary Black Biography. Vol. 67. Gale, 2008. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center, Farmington Hills, Mich.: Gale, 2009.

Career After a month at Yale Law School, Gates withdrew from the program. In October 1975 he was hired by Charles Davis as a secretary in the Afro- American Studies department at Yale. In July 1976, Gates was promoted to the post of Lecturer in Afro-American Studies, with the understanding that he would be promoted to assistant professor upon completion of his doctoral dissertation. Jointly appointed to assistant professorships in English and Afro-American Studies in 1979, Gates was promoted to associate professor in 1984. While at Yale, Gates guided Jodie Foster, who majored in African- American Literature there, writing her thesis on writer Toni Morrison. In 1984, Gates was recruited by Cornell University with an offer of tenure; Gates asked Yale if they would match Cornell's offer, but they declined. Gates moved to Cornell in 1985, where he taught until 1989. Following a two-year stay at Duke University, he was recruited to Harvard University in 1991. At Harvard, Gates teaches undergraduate and graduate courses as the Alphonse Fletcher University Professor, an endowed chair he was appointed to in 2006, and as a professor of English. Additionally, he is the Director of the Hutchins Center for African & African American Research. As a literary theorist and critic, Gates has combined literary techniques of deconstruction with native African literary traditions; he draws on structuralism, post-structuralism, and semiotics to analyze texts and assess matters of identity politics. As a black intellectual and public figure, Gates has been an outspoken critic of the Eurocentric literary canon. He has insisted that black literature must be evaluated by the aesthetic criteria of its culture of origin, not criteria imported from Western or European cultural traditions that express a \\"tone deafness to the black cultural voice\\" and result in \\"intellectual racism\\". In his major scholarly work, The Signifying Monkey, a 1989 American Book Award winner, Gates expressed what might constitute an African-American cultural aesthetic. The work extended application of the concept of \\"signifyin'\\" to analysis of African-American works. \\"Signifyin'\\" refers to the significance of words that is based on context, and is accessible only to those who share the cultural values of a given speech community. His work has rooted African- American literary criticism in the African-American vernacular tradition.Napier, Winston, ed. African American Literary Theory: A Reader. NYU Press, 2000. pp. 6‚Äì7. While Gates has stressed the need for greater recognition of black literature and black culture, he does not advocate a \\"separatist\\" black canon. Rather, he works for greater recognition of black works and their integration into a larger, pluralistic canon. He has affirmed the value of the Western tradition, but has envisioned a more inclusive canon of diverse works sharing common cultural connections: > \\"Every black American text must confess to a complex ancestry, one high and > low (that is, literary and vernacular) but also one white and black ... > there can be no doubt that white texts inform and influence black texts (and > vice versa), so that a thoroughly integrated canon of American literature is > not only politically sound, it is intellectually sound as well.\\" Gates has argued that a separatist, Afrocentric education perpetuates racist stereotypes. He maintains that it is \\"ridiculous\\" to think that only blacks should be scholars of African and African-American literature. He argues, \\"It can't be real as a subject if you have to look like the subject to be an expert in the subject, adding, \\"It's as ridiculous as if someone said I couldn't appreciate Shakespeare because I'm not Anglo-Saxon. I think it's vulgar and racist whether it comes out of a black mouth or a white mouth.\\"Clarke, Breena, and Susan Tifft, \\"A 'Race Man' Argues for a Broader Curriculum: Henry Louis Gates Jr. Wants W. E. B. DuBois, Wole Soyinka and Phyllis Wheatley on the Nation's Reading Lists, As Well As Western Classics like Milton and Shakespeare\\", Time: 137(16). April 22, 1991: 16. As a mediator between those advocating separatism and those believing in a Western canon, Gates has been criticized by both. Some critics suggest that adding black literature will diminish the value of the Western canon, while separatists say that Gates is too accommodating to the dominant white culture in his advocacy of integration of the canon. Gates has been criticized by John Henrik Clarke, Molefi Kete Asante and the controversial Maulana Karenga, each of whom has been questioned by others in academia.Molefi Kete Asante, \\"Henry Louis Gates is Wrong about African Involvement in the Slave Trade\\", Asante.net, May 6, 2010. As a literary historian committed to the preservation and study of historical texts, Gates has been integral to the Black Periodical Literature Project, a digital archive of black newspapers and magazines created with financial assistance from the National Endowment for the Humanities. To build Harvard's visual, documentary, and literary archives of African-American texts, Gates arranged for the purchase of The Image of the Black in Western Art, a collection assembled by Dominique de M√©nil in Houston. As a result of research as a MacArthur Fellow, Gates discovered Our Nig, written by Harriet E. Wilson in 1859, and thought to be the first novel written in the United States by an African American. Later, he acquired and authenticated the manuscript of The Bondwoman's Narrative by Hannah Crafts, a novel from the same period that scholars believe may have been written as early as 1853; if so, it would have precedence as the first-known novel written in the United States by an African American. (Note: Clotel (1853) is recognized as the first novel published by an African-American author, but William Wells Brown wrote and published it in London.) The Bondwoman's Narrative was first published in 2002 and became a bestseller. As a prominent black intellectual, Gates has concentrated on building academic institutions to study black culture. Additionally, he has worked to bring about social, educational, and intellectual equality for black Americans. His writing includes pieces in The New York Times that defend rap music, and an article in Sports Illustrated that criticizes black youth culture for glorifying basketball over education. In 1992, he received a George Polk Award for his social commentary in The New York Times. Gates's prominence has led to his being called as a witness on behalf of the controversial Florida rap group 2 Live Crew in an obscenity case. He argued that the material, which the government charged was profane, had important roots in African-American Vernacular English, games, and literary traditions, and should be protected. Asked by National Endowment for the Humanities Chairman Bruce Cole to describe his work, Gates responded: \\"I would say I'm a literary critic. That's the first descriptor that comes to mind. After that I would say I was a teacher. Both would be just as important.\\" After his 2003 NEH lecture, Gates published in the same year a book entitled The Trials of Phillis Wheatley, about the early African-American poet. Other activities In 1995 Gates presented a program in the BBC series Great Railway Journeys (produced in association with PBS). The program documents a 3,000-mile journey Gates took through Zimbabwe, Zambia and Tanzania, with his then-wife Sharon Adams and daughters Liza and Meggie Gates. This trip came 25 years after Gates worked at a hospital in Kilimatinde near Dodoma, Tanzania, as a 19-year-old pre-medical student at Yale University.\\"Great Railway Journeys\\". BBC. Retrieved February 6, 2010. In September 1995, Gates read a five-part abridgement (by Margaret Busby) of his memoir Colored People on BBC Radio 4.\\"Coloured People\\", Radio Times, Issue 3739, September 14, 1995, p. 121. Gates was the host and co-producer of African American Lives (2006) and African American Lives 2 (2008) in which the lineage of more than a dozen notable African Americans was traced using genealogical and historic resources, as well as genealogical DNA testing. In the first series, Gates learned that he has 50% European ancestry\\"The 10 Percenter\\", The New York Times, October 13, 2011. and 50% African ancestry.\\"What It Means to Be Black in Latin America\\", NPR Books, January 27, 2011. He had known of some European ancestry but was surprised to learn the high proportion; he also learned that he was descended from John Redman, a mulatto veteran in New England of the American Revolutionary War. Gates has joined the Sons of the American Revolution. In the series, he discussed findings with guests about their complex ancestries. In the second season, Gates learned that he is part of a genetic subgroup possibly descended from or related to the fourth-century Irish king Niall of the Nine Hostages. He also learned that one of his African ancestors includes a Yoruba man who was trafficked to America from Ouidah in present-day Republic of Benin. The two series demonstrated the many strands of ancestry, cultural heritage and history among African Americans. Gates hosted Faces of America, a four-part series presented by PBS in 2010. This program examined the genealogy of 12 North Americans of diverse ancestry: Elizabeth Alexander, Mario Batali, Stephen Colbert, Louise Erdrich, Malcolm Gladwell, Eva Longoria, Yo-Yo Ma, Mike Nichols, Queen Noor of Jordan, Mehmet Oz, Meryl Streep, and Kristi Yamaguchi. Since 1995, Gates has been the jury chair for the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award, which honors written works that contribute to society's understanding of racism and the diversity of human culture. Gates was an Anisfield-Wolf prize winner in 1989 for The Schomburg Library of Women Writers. Since 2012 he has hosted a PBS TV series, called Finding Your Roots ‚Äì with Henry Louis Gates, Jr..Finding Your Roots with Henry Louis Gates, Jr., PBS. The second season of the series, featuring 30 prominent guests across 10 episodes, with Gates as the narrator, interviewer, and genealogical investigator, aired on PBS in fall 2014. The show's third season was postponed after it was discovered that actor Ben Affleck had persuaded Gates to omit information about his slave-owning ancestors. Finding Your Roots resumed in January 2016. Gates's critically acclaimed six-part PBS documentary series, The African Americans: Many Rivers to Cross, traced 500 years of African- American history to the second inauguration of President Barack Obama. Gates wrote, executive produced, and hosted the series, which earned the 2013 Peabody Award and a NAACP Image Award. \\"Ending the Slavery Blame-Game\\" op- ed In 2010, Gates wrote an op-ed in The New York Times that discussed the role played by Africans in the slave trade.Henry Louis Gates Jr. (April 23, 2010). \\"Ending the Slavery Blame-Game\\", The New York Times, p. A27. Gates' op- ed begins and ends with the observation that it is very difficult to decide whether or not to give reparations to the descendants of American slaves, whether they should receive compensation for their ancestors' unpaid labor and lack of rights. Gates also notes that it is equally difficult to decide who should get such reparations and who should pay them, as slavery was legal under the laws of the colonies and the United States. In an article for Newsweek, journalist Lisa Miller reported on the reaction to Gates' article: The Letters page of The New York Times of April 25, 2010, featured criticism and examination of Gates's views in response to his op-ed. Eric Foner, professor of history at Columbia University, considered Gates's emphasis on there being \\"little discussion\\" of African involvement in the slave trade to be unfounded, stating that \\"today, virtually every history of slavery and every American history textbook includes this information\\". Author Herb Boyd, who teaches African and African-American history at the College of New Rochelle and City College, CUNY, argued that despite the complicity of African monarchs in the Atlantic slave trade, the United States \\"was the greatest beneficiary, and thus should be the main compensator\\". Lolita Buckner Inniss, a professor at the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, argued that notwithstanding African involvement as \\"abductors\\", it was Western slave- owners, as \\"captors\\", that perpetuated the practice even after the import trade was banned. \\"Up until that recent piece, people would have thought of him as someone who took a cautious and nuanced approach to questions like reparations.\\" Gates has such an eminent reputation, she said, and \\"so much gravitas. Many of us were troubled.\\"Miller, L. (April 18, 2011). \\"Skip Gates's Next Big Idea\\". Newsweek. 157 (16), pp. 42‚Äì45. Cambridge arrest On July 16, 2009, Gates returned home to his residence in Cambridge, Massachusetts near Harvard Square following a trip to China, only to find the front door jammed. His taxi driver attempted to help him gain entrance. A passerby called police reporting a possible break-in after reporting to 911 \\"an individual\\" forcing the front door open. A Cambridge police officer was dispatched. The confrontation resulted in Gates being arrested and charged with disorderly conduct. Prosecutors later dropped the charges.\\"Charge dropped against Harvard scholar\\", The Washington Times, July 22, 2009. The incident spurred a politically charged exchange of views about race relations and law enforcement throughout the United States. The arrest attracted national attention after U.S. President Barack Obama declared that the Cambridge police \\"acted stupidly\\" in arresting the 59-year-old Gates. Obama and Vice President Joe Biden eventually extended an invitation to Gates and the Cambridge officer who was involved to share a beer with them on the White House lawn, which they accepted.

She was presumed to have sunk, with no surviving crew or passengers. The cause remains a mystery, and her wreckage has not been found. History Manistee was built in 1867 by E. M. Peck Shipbuilders, of Cleveland, Ohio. Originally, she measured 154 feet (46.9 meters) in length, but she was later lengthened to 184 feet (56.1 meters), and she was rated at 677 gross tons. Originally, the vessel was operated by the Engelman Line and carried cargo and passengers between her home port of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and her namesake city, Manistee, Michigan. In 1872, the ship came to Duluth, Minnesota, and she eventually was put in service for the Leopold and Austrian Line, her final owners. The long and interesting career of Manistee came to an end on an autumn Saturday in 1883, when the ship left Duluth for Ontonagon, Michigan. The 400 tons of cargo included items such as flour, mill goods, furniture, and general merchandise. Shortly after she left Duluth, a violent northwest gale developed on the western portion of Lake Superior. Her captain, John McKay, decided to seek temporary shelter near Bayfield, Wisconsin, until the winds subsided. The storm lasted for four days. On the fifth day of his Bayfield stay, McKay decided to venture back out towards Ontanagon. However, this proved to be a mistake, as the ship disappeared somewhere near the Apostle Islands after leaving Bayfield. The cause of the sinking, the location of the wreck, and even the exact number of missing passengers is in question. Different theories as to the ship‚Ä≤s fate were discussed in an article in the Bayfield County Press on November 24, 1883, when the story was first reported by the local media.

She was also significant within the Latina feminist movement and the Communist Party. She describes her own complicated identity in her poem \\"I am what I am\\", ‚ÄúI am Puerto Rican I am U.S. American‚Ä¶ I am Boricua as Boricuas come‚Ä¶ I am naturalized Jewish American‚Ä¶ I am what I am. Take it or leave me alone.\\"Morales, Rosario, and Aurora Levins Morales. Getting Home Alive. Ithaca, New York: Firebrand Books, 1986. 138. Print. Biography =Early life and childhood= Rosario Morales was born in August 1930 to two immigrants from Naranjito, Puerto Rico, both from landholding families. Her mother worked in a hospital laundry, and later in a garment factory. Her father was a janitor and then an electrician. She was raised Catholic, and, although the family was not very devout, Rosario was very firm in her religious beliefs and even considered becoming a nun early in her life, although this religious fervor diminished over time. She grew up in El Barrio of New York City at a time when the Puerto Rican population was still very small. There were only 52,774 first-generation Puerto Ricans in the US in 1930.Mills, C. Wright, Clarence Senior, and Rose K. Goldsten. Puerto Rican Journey: New York's Newest Migrants. New York: Harper and Row, 1950. 44. This profoundly impacted her identity; she learned to identify with other minority groups such as her Eastern European Jewish neighbors.\\"Rosario Morales.\\" Encyclopedia Latina: History, Culture, and Society in the United States. Ilan Stavans and Harold Augenbraum, eds. New York City: Grolier, 2005. 17-18. Print. The Morales family spoke Spanish at home until the children entered primary school. Once in English-speaking public school, Rosario and her sister began to primarily speak English, because it was the language they used for the longest parts of their day. Rosario's father was very controlling and fought often with her mother during their childhood. Due to this conflict, she says she would not describe her relationship with her parents at this point in her life as close. Her younger sister used to urge them to divorce after the fights. They did so briefly when Rosario was in her late 30s, but remarried soon after. Her father was diagnosed with dementia soon after her parents returned to live in Puerto Rico. Morales attended public school in New York City, which she cites as the time when English transitioned to being her primary language. The family began to speak what Rosario defines as Ingla√±ol rather than Spanglish, because Spanglish is Spanish that uses English words, whereas they spoke English that incorporated Spanish words. Her primary school is where she first discovered her passion for writing. As a young adult, Rosario had a complicated relationship with her Puerto Rican heritage. She felt a strong kinship with the land and nature of the island, as described in her poem ‚ÄúHappiness as a Coqu√≠‚Äù, but was also adamant that the United States is her home.Montes, Brian. \\"Rosario Morales.\\" The Oxford Encyclopedia of Latinos and Latinas in the United States. Suzanne Oboler and Deena J. Gonz√°lez, eds. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005. 180-181. Print. She describes her feelings in her work ‚ÄúPuerto Rican Journal‚Äù: ‚ÄúThis is not home eleven years couldn‚Äôt make it home. I‚Äôll always be clumsy with the language always resentful of the efforts to remake me.‚Äù =Adult life= While studying at Hunter College in New York, she met Ukrainian heritage Jew Richard Levins, also known as Dick, through mutual friends and her political activism. Within two weeks of meeting, the two decided to become informally engaged. They waited several months before breaking the news to their families due to a fear of being seen as too young for marriage. In 1950, at 19 and 20 years-of-age, they were married. In 1951, Rosario moved with Dick to Puerto Rico. He had recently graduated and was trying to avoid the draft for the Korean War. While in Puerto Rico, the two became active in the Puerto Rican Communist Party and the Fellowship of Reconciliation while working a small farm in the mountains. They had their first child, Aurora Levins Morales in 1954. Rosario and Aurora both became public writers as participants in the Second Wave of U.S. feminism. Although they had a sometimes challenging personal relationship, Rosario cites her daughter as her closest ally in her work surrounding Latina Feminism. Rosario and Dick's second child, Ricardo Manuel, was born in 1956. Shortly thereafter, Rosario and Dick moved to New York City while Dick pursued graduate studies at Columbia University, and Rosario studied at City College. She was an accomplished visual artist in multiple genres, an interest she shared with her son, Ricardo, who is a well-known activist artist. During this time she also met anthropologist Anthony Leeds, part of a group of young radical social scientists, and became interested in the field.Interview, Richard Levins,2012 In 1961, the family returned to Puerto Rico, where Dick joined the faculty of the University of Puerto Rico. Rosario pursued her interests in visual art and women's crafts, and began studying anthropology on her own, and during summers at the University of Michigan. Rosario and Dick's third child, Alejandro Rub√©n, was born in 1965, during an anti-war teach-in at the University of Puerto Rico, in which Dick played a leading role. Dick drove back and forth between the teach-in and the hospital during Rosario's labor.Interview, Richard Levins, 2012 In 1967, Dick was denied tenure at the University of Puerto Rico because of his political activism. Rosario wanted to go to graduate school in anthropology, and was concerned about the role models available to her daughter in rural Puerto Rico, so they decided to leave.Personal communication with Rosario Morales, 2008 They moved to Chicago in June, 1967, and Rosario started graduate school at the University of Chicago. Within the first weeks of the semester, the students went on strike to protest the fact that many of the anthropology faculty were away doing field work, and few classes were being offered, and Rosario found herself in a leadership role in campus activism. Her prose poem \\"Concepts of Pollution\\" in Getting Home Alive describes her experience with the racism of anthropology. Her Masters thesis was a critique of the racism of French anthropologist Claude Levi-Straus, entitled \\"Tropes Tipique,\\" a satirical play on his famous work, Tristes Tropiques.Personal communication, Rosario Morales, 2008 Morales and her daughter Aurora became active in the women's movement in the late 1960s through their membership in the Chicago Women's Liberation Union. In 1975, Rosario and Dick moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Dick joined the faculty of the Harvard School of Public Health. Rosario loved New England and it became the place she felt most at home. The couple also had a cabin in Marlboro, Vermont, where they spent summers. In 1981, Rosario and Aurora were both contributors to This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color edited by Cher'rie Moraga and Gloria Anzald√∫a. In 1983, they were approached by Nancy Bereano, a feminist editor, soon to be founder of Firebrand Books, who invited them to submit a joint manuscript. Getting Home Alive was published in 1986. In 1995, she took a leadership role with the Women's Community Cancer Project partially due to her own health decline, but also as an attempt to revitalize her old interest in a more scientific field. An artist and intellectual with wide-ranging interests, Rosario Morales studied botany, philosophy of science, feminist history and political writings, and fiber arts. Rosario Morales was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2002. On February 28, 2011, she decided to stop her treatment. On March 23, 2011, Rosario Morales died at 3:30 am. She is survived by her husband, her sister Gloria, her three children and five grandchildren, including Minneapolis-based hip hop artist Manny Phesto.Tran, Kyle \\"New Local Music\\" MN Daily PlanetThompson, Eric \\"Top 10 Must See Music Videos This Week\\" retrieved (8/4/15) City Pages Career =Involvement in the Communist Party= During her schooling at Hunter College, Rosario began to lose faith in her religious beliefs. She cites this as one of the reasons she became so deeply involved in the Communist Party: it gave her something new in which to put her faith and passion. She first discovered her interest in socialist ideology when two of her close friends in college enrolled her a course at the Jefferson School ‚Äì a program run by the Communist Party. She fell in love with the philosophy she learned there. In addition, it was through her new activism and friends that she met Dick Levins. Together, they joined the Communist Party on July 29, 1949. One of their early dates was the so-called Peekskill Riots, in which white supremacists tried to prevent a concert by Paul Robeson in Peekskill, New York. After their move to Puerto Rico, both Rosario and Dick became members of the Puerto Rican Communist Party (1951-1956). Their involvement in communist activism at this time decreased due to the small size of the Puerto Rican Communist Party and its structure. The party in Puerto Rico was run by a very small core group, in which the participation of women was uncommon and discouraged. Rosario and Dick became close friends with C√©sar Andreu Iglesias, a prominent labor leader and journalist, who was in the leadership of the Party, and his wife, Jane Speed, an Alabama communist organizer. In 1956, Jane attempted to get a leadership position within the party and, subsequently, was forced out of involvement. Both couples left the Communist Party, partially due to this incident, and also because of their disapproval of the factions forming within party leadership. =Writing= Rosario Morales's two most recognized publications are Getting Home Alive and her contributions to This Bridge Called My Back. In addition, Rosario says in her interviews that the pieces of writing she is the most proud of are her writings in This Bridge Called My Back and her piece ‚ÄúConcepts of Pollution‚Äù in Getting Home Alive. Both share a focus on the themes of personal identity, multiple consciousness, critical reflections on gender relations, and social commentary. She fuses her identities as a U.S. Latina who grew up among Eastern European Jews, and married one, through language; her poetry combines English, Spanish, and Yiddish. This Bridge Called My Back is an anthology collected and edited by Cherr√≠e Moraga and Gloria E. Anzald√∫a and first published in 1981. It is an examination of Feminist politics among women of color in the United States. Working and connecting with women from different racial and ethnic backgrounds that shared her passions gave Morales a new perspective on the world. Her contributions to the anthology discuss identity as multiple and complementary rather than restrictive. In 1986, Morales published Getting Home Alive, a collection of writings and poems that she collaborated on with her daughter Aurora Levins Morales. The book is an analysis of multiple identity as multiple as can be seen in the much anthologized ‚ÄúEnding Poem‚Äù, the final piece in Getting Home Alive. It explores their relationship with Puerto Rico in poems such as \\"Happiness is a Coqu√≠\\", ‚ÄúNostalgia‚Äù, and ‚ÄúMemory‚Äù. These poems both admire the beauty of the island and its traditions, as well as critique the patriarchal dominance in Puerto Rican society. Additionally, it explores Rosario and Aurora's differing emotions toward the United States and their heritage as mother and daughter. Rosario Morales' literary papers are held at Smith College Special Collections. The collection includes \\"correspondence, writings (manuscripts, drafts, journals, free writing, publications), conference files, memorabilia, and awards that document her personal and professional life as an author, poet, feminist, and activist. The materials in this collection primarily date back to the 1980s and 1990s, and are especially reflective of Rosario Morales' processes as a writer. Writings included here are primarily autobiographical, focusing on her identity as a Puerto Rican feminist. Morales' writings often underscore the importance of intersectionality in the feminist movement. Other topics covered include communism/Marxism, writing and publishing processes, Cuba and the Cuban blockade, and feminist theory. Of note is correspondence with Gloria Anzaldua and Cherrie Moraga, the editors of the 1981 anthology This Bridge Called My Back, including notes on public readings and publicity for the groundbreaking book by and about women of color. The papers also include some materials of her daughter, writer Aurora Levins Morales.\\"  Later life  Rosario stopped writing publicly and publishing before she died; she wanted to write because she had something poignant to say rather than because she thought of herself as a writer. Instead, she began to read a lot and took a bigger role in editing her husband's work on communism in Puerto Rico and Cuba. On March 23, 2011 Morales succumbed to her multiple myeloma at home in Massachusetts.

The story sets in New York in the years 1776 to 1777, when slavery was legal and common in the colonies. Though the novel is fictional, the events in the story are actual events that occurred back then in the colonies. Some examples of these events are the failed plan of George Washington's assassination followed by the hanging of one of the conspirators, the capture of Fort Washington, and the popular pamphlet Common Sense by Thomas Paine. The novel contains 45 chapters numbered in Roman Numerals with the dates of the events in the chapter appearing beneath the chapter number. Under the dates, Anderson includes quotes from important historic documents such as private letters, newspapers, the Common Sense pamphlet, the Declaration of Independence of the United States, and even spoken opinions from various country leaders. This opening of each chapter gives a perspective of what Isabel might face in the chapter or something relating to the events of the chapter. Plot introduction Isabel and her younger sister, Ruth were supposed to be released from slavery as promised by their owner, Miss Mary Finch's will when she dies but unfortunately they landed in the hands of Miss Mary's nephew, Robert Finch, who claimed them as his property with the reason that there was no actual will in physical form. He then sold them to a Loyalist couple who brings them to New York away from their previous hometown, Newport, Rhode Island. Isabel, determined to gain her and her sister's liberty, follows the advice of a servant boy named Curzon, who tells her to spy on her master and other Loyalists for any suspicious plans that could be reported back to the Patriots to use against the Loyalists. Characters =Isabel= Protagonist and narrator of the novel, she is always striving her best to do anything she can do to get her and her sister out of slavery and back to Rhode Island, where they belong. Though at a very young age‚Äîthirteen-years-old‚Äîshe has a very tough character and is devoted to anything she does. Her cleverness helps her in her various tasks on spying the Loyalists and planning her escape. She is very nurturing towards her younger sister Ruth, knowing that she is the only person who can truly take care of her. She befriends a slave boy named Curzon who works for a Patriot, to whom she is a good friend he can always trust, which is shown when she desperately tried to deliver leftover food to Curzon, who is in prison; considering she knows the consequences of helping a Patriot when she herself is working for a Loyalist. She also shows a brave spirit when she stands up to Mrs. Lockton and demand the information on the whereabouts of Ruth, who Lockton said she has sold but in truth kept Ruth in hiding away from Isabel to weaken her. This action results in her being branded with I for insolence on her right cheek as a punishment for standing up to her master, but towards the end of the novel she sees this mark standing for her name Isabel, and is proud to have everyone know her name. On the night of the Queens Ball she makes her move on her way to freedom, bringing Curzon along with her. =Ruth= Isabel's five-year-old sister and also a slave. Ruth, who is suffering from epilepsy, often encounters fits from this sickness. She does not talk very often and does what she is told without question, which becomes the more desirable slave to Mrs. Lockton and she would be kept in Mrs. Lockton's chamber for hours to be her personal maid. As a young child, she is sometimes stubborn, for example she asks for her baby doll every night before going to bed even though she knows that Mr. Robert Finch has taken away all their belongings. Her innocent and vulnerable nature makes her very dependent on Isabel. =The Locktons= The Locktons are the owners of Isabel and her sister Ruth throughout, pretty much the whole book. They are both loyalists and try their hardest to make the little girls' lives miserable Elihu Lockton A Loyalist who is very self-centered and devious. His commitment to being a Loyalist is shown by his various attempts to get the rebels to join the British side; one of the attempts was to bribe them and hiding the money in his wife's linen chest to discourage suspicion. This attempt, however, was discovered thanks to Isabel's report on her spying tasks. He also had a plan to assassinate President George Washington along with a group of Loyalists; unfortunately, their plan was also discovered by Isabel. At home, he is very abusive towards his wife, and he demands to be obeyed by everybody in the house. And he has a big belly according to the Narrator. Anne Lockton Wife of Elihu Lockton, she is also a Loyalist though not as strongly committed as Elihu. Very abusive towards Isabel, both physically and mentally, she does not call her by name and instead calls her Sal; in return demanding Isabel refers to her as Madam. Her harsh and brutal character is shown in her branding Isabel as a punishment for standing up to her and running away afterward. She strongly dislikes Isabel, as opposed to her liking Ruth because she is considered easier to order around. She is very impatient and she always blames Isabel for accidents she encounters, also often picking on the simplest mistakes such as not placing her dog statue in the right position after being dusted. When her husband's aunt falls sick, she hopes that her condition will cause her to die soon. Whenever Lady Seymour's condition improves, Mrs. Lockton seems to be saddened. =Miss Mary Finch= The previous owner of Isabel and Ruth before she died and they were sold to the Locktons. She promised Isabel that she and her sister would be free when she dies, as a part of her will. Isabel views her as one of the nicer slave owners, describing her as being polite to her slaves by saying please and thank you when assigning tasks. Along with those acts, She taught Isabel to read and write. She worked as a policeman for most of her life. =Robert Finch= Miss Finch's nephew and only relative. He denies Miss Mary's will by saying that it is verbal and not physically extant thus making it non-legal and claims that the death of Miss Mary would mean Isabel and Ruth belongs to him. He then sells the girls to the Locktons and takes away all of the girls' only belongings, including Ruth's favorite baby doll. =Curzon= A slave of Mr. Bellingham, a Patriot, he helps Isabel to achieve her wish for freedom by telling her to become a spy on the Locktons and try to find out any personal information that is sensitive to the political being, and report back. While other slaves join the Patriot army to be free from slavery, Curzon says that he is simply a loyal American fighting for the independence of his country; he is even brave enough to risk life imprisoned as long as he is fighting for America's liberty. He is a very good and loyal friend to Isabel, calling her \\"Country,\\" and he is always helping her in her attempts to seek the liberation of her and her sister. =James Bellingham= He is a strong-willed American Patriot who distrusts Elihu Lockton. His suspicious nature is shown towards Elihu, which is shown in the mid-beginning of the book where he demands that Anne Lockton's linen closet shall be inspected as they arrive in the docks of New York. He trusts Curzon though he is a slave, which is considered very odd at the time. =Lady Seymour= Elihu Lockton's aunt, is very kind to slaves, unlike the rest of the people of the society. She acquaints Isabel and welcomes her dearly, and she always helps Isabel whenever she needs it. When Isabel came to her house to pass the information that Mr. Lockton had been arrested and that Madam is in need of his aunt, she tells Isabel to come in the house and even serves her milk and cookies to nourish herself; something nobody at the time would do to slaves. She also took care of Isabel while in recovery right after getting branded, which in return was paid by Isabel helping her escape from the burning bush burning buildings and save her life. =Angelika= Angelika is Lady Seymour's servant who only speaks Dutch and does not show interest in learning English. She treated Isabel's wounds when Isabel woke up from being branded with the letter I for insolence. =Becky= She is a maid in the Lockton house, and she often helps Isabel whenever she is having tough times due to Mrs. Lockton's orders and actions. She reminds Isabel to do what Mrs. Lockton says, and she tells Isabel what and what not to do in the Lockton house. Becky also tries her best to get Isabel and Ruth out of situations where they would possibly get punished. She told Isabel about a slave who worked for the Locktons a couple of years earlier who got beaten severely for talking back to Madam, trying to get Isabel to stay cautious in her actions and hold her fists down. =Grandfather= He is an elder African-American slave who is in the line of the distribution of water from the Tea Water Pump. He seems to know much about the gossip of the war, which is passed around every morning when slaves come to the pump to obtain water for the day. His real name is not revealed, but most slaves refer to him as \\"Grandfather\\", because he is kind to everyone. =Colonel Regan= A colonel who works for Mr. Bellingham, he is Isabel's only hope to get her and her sister back to Rhode Islands. He retrieves information and evidence in the form of a list of names of the plan to assassinate General George Washington from Isabel, who secretly spied on Mr. Lockton during one of his meetings. He promised to help Isabel in return for the information, but he, later on, dismisses her when she begged for help when she ran away from Madam. =Captain Morse= Leader of the war prisoners of Fort Washington, he asks Isabel to be his messenger and bring messages from other military officers. He treats Isabel kindly and allows her to bring in food for Curzon, who was a prisoner in there. Captain Morse often takes some food from the basket that Isabel brings along. =Captain Farrar= A military officer who Isabel goes to in the midst of her task of being Captain Morse's personal messenger. He gives a note to Isabel which was demanded by Mrs. Lockton when she discovers that Isabel has been working for the rebels. Isabel surprisingly throws away the note in the hearth so that Mrs. Lockton would not be able to obtain the information in the note. =Pastor Weeks= A pastor that fulfills Isabel's parents funeral. He also helps Isabel with trying to get to a safe place, and where she would be best happy, even though she would still be a slave. =Old Ben= Pastor Week's slave who pulled the wagon carrying a pine coffin containing Miss Mary Finch's body at the beginning of the story. =Momma (Dinah)= Isabel and Ruth's mother who died when they were young from pox. Isabel sneaks her seeds when she gets sold to the Locktons. =Papa= He is the father of Isabel and Ruth and also the wife of Dinah, their mother. He has many scars from when he was a slave, and isabel compares herself to him toward the end of the book while trapped in the potato basket, all alone.

It was designed by Frank Gibson Costello and built from 1927 onwards, one of the builders being Sir Manuel Hornibrook. It is also known as Bedford Park and Spring Hill Playground. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 May 1998.  History  The Bedford Playground was established in 1927 as the third children's playground of the Playground Association of Queensland. The Park was officially named in 1959 in commemoration of Ms Josephine Mary Bedford, an early Brisbane philanthropist who was involved with the progress of family welfare and an integral and prolific member of the Playground Association. The Playground Association of Queensland held their first meeting in 1913 and was formed to introduce concepts emanating from the United States movement toward providing public recreation parks and playgrounds. A comprehensive guide to the design and management of these new parks, written by landscape architects and social planners, Arthur and Lorna Leland was published in 1909 and many of the themes of this book were adopted by the Playground Association of Queensland in their mission statements. In a time of serious epidemics the Leland book, Playground Technique and Playcraft, promoted a revised level of care and protection of children, allowing them a better chance at success in life. The basic requirements advocated for the mental and physical well being of children were good food, air, sunshine and exercise. Of these basic requirements, the playgrounds provided for three, and were also thought to instil a love of nature and an appreciation of beautiful environments. The first playgrounds in America developed as part of this movement were in Charlesbank, Boston; Boone Park, Louisville; and many examples in Chicago all planned in the late nineteenth century. Many of these early playgrounds were designed by important landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmsted who was earlier involved with the highly influential design of Central Park, New York. Generally these American playgrounds were incorporated in large public recreation parks, usually with elements such as playgrounds, open air gymnasiums, running tracks and field houses, which provided covered accommodation for halls, administrative offices, libraries and club rooms. Unlike the large recreation parks constructed in the United States for the whole community, the playgrounds established in Queensland by the Playground Association were planned on a smaller scale, focussing solely on children and providing a playground and usually a field house. Usually the playgrounds were associated with an adjacent kindergarten or cr√®che, and this is thought to have been due to Mary Josephine Bedford's involvement with the Cr√®che and Kindergarten Association. This group formed in 1907 with the purpose of instituting and maintaining day nurseries and free kindergartens for the children of the poor in Brisbane. Like the Playground Association, the Cr√®che and Kindergarten Association were successful in achieving local and Queensland Government sponsorship and funding as well as funding from various national philanthropic trust funds. The success of these two organisations can be rightly said to be due to the tireless and strategic work of Mary Josephine Bedford. Throughout her life Bedford, who is perhaps best remembered as the lifelong companion of Dr Lilian Violet Cooper, worked toward alleviating the stress and poverty afflicting urban dwellers. On her many study tours with Cooper, Bedford researched successful methods and programmes on the provision of family welfare in America and Europe and she is known to have attended lectures at Berkeley University on public recreation parks in about 1911, just two years before the Playground Association was established. Ms Bedford was associated with many of the early efforts in Brisbane to establish welfare; she was instrumental in increasing the scope of the Brisbane Children's Hospital in 1905, she was involved with the establishment of the Queensland branch of the National Council of Women also in 1905; she and Cooper were delegates at the International Council of Women in Stockholm in 1912, and in 1916 both Bedford and Cooper served in Serbia during World War I, Bedford as an ambulance driver for which she received the 5th Order of St Sava. Ms Bedford remained an active participant of both the Cr√®che and Kindergarten Association and the Playground Association until her death in December 1955. It is clearly through her extensive letter writing, evident in archival files on both organisations, that they achieved their successes. The Playground Association in Queensland was formed with the practical intention of promoting the establishment of children's playgrounds and recreation centres in districts of poverty and high density. Also the Association worked towards assuming the administration of the parks and providing trained supervisors who were to direct play and, through this, to instil the values of courage, honesty and consideration in the children. The supervisors were also to look after the playground libraries, teach hand work and also to liaise with the children's homes. The Association was interested in the full social development of the child and saw the lessons learnt during play as an adjunct to the lessons the children studied in their classrooms. The sites chosen for the three playgrounds managed by the Playground Association in their formative years were at Paddington, established 1918; East Street Fortitude Valley, 1922 and Spring Hill established 1927. All three were places of high density low cost housing. The characteristics of the sites were similar as well; the site was usually undeveloped and lying stagnant for various reasons, at Paddington the playground was part of a former cemetery and the Spring Hill playground was constructed on a former quarry site. The playgrounds were planned within a short distance of the local state school, usually near swimming baths and central to the density of housing surrounding the playground. They were planned with several mandatory features; a boundary fence to aid supervision and protection of the child, borders within the playground separating girls, boys and toddlers, a field house and a well considered plan incorporating play equipment and open space. The playgrounds were planned as model examples of recreational facilities for children, to be copied in both management and planning by schools and local councils across Queensland. Certainly the playgrounds established by the Playground Association foreshadowed a period of intense playground development in suburban Brisbane when a number were established by various groups, usually the city council or a local progress association. In 1938 a list was made of eight playgrounds managed or funded through the Brisbane City Council but not including those in which the Playground Association was involved. Like the three model playgrounds, the Brisbane City Council playgrounds were found in high density, inner city areas and included one in the Domain of the Brisbane Botanic Gardens. Over the next ten years the Council continued to acquire sites for playgrounds, although only those playgrounds managed by the Playground Association were supervised, a practice which continues to this day. The playground created in Water Street, Spring Hill utilised the site of an early Brisbane quarry which had closed. From the 1860s until its closure in the early twentieth century the Spring Hill porphyry quarry was one of a series of quarries stretching along a porphyry seam extending north and south from the city. Porphyry is formed from volcanic ash, consolidated and hardened in the presence of solutions containing silica. The presence of various iron and manganese oxides results in a range of possible colours. Given the variance in strength through the stone, porphyry is not usually cut into ashlar blocks but often left rockfaced to minimise disturbance. Stone from the Spring Hill quarry was thought to be used in construction of the early Brisbane Normal School and other early Brisbane buildings. The quarry was closed by the early twentieth century. On 22 January 1918 the land around the quarry was divided into twelve allotments and offered for sale. Only one portion of this subdivision was sold, that on the corner of Water and Love Streets to a Mrs Kate Downey. The twelve allotments remained undeveloped until 1924 when the Brisbane City Council were granted the land by the Queensland Government for use as a park on behalf of the Playground Association who offered to undertake supervision and management on their third Brisbane project after Paddington and Fortitude Valley. The Spring Hill Playground was officially gazetted as a reserve for a Children's Playground on 20 March 1924. Mrs Downey surrendered her lot in the following year and the entire reserve was re-gazetted on 12 November 1925, measuring and . The early playground on the site was along the Water Street boundary, another park reserve was gazetted around the former quarry site, which the Playground Association assumed in recent years, increasing the size of the original playground. Few early plans of the Spring Hill playground have been located, it seems, however, that it was originally planned with three principal sections divided by fences; the boys were closest to the Love Street end of the site and the girls at the Quarry Street end, divided by the infants section which was centrally located. A field house, or supervisor's cottage with a free library was located to the north of the girls section and toilets were provided for the girls and infants within the field house. The boys' toilets were in the northern eastern corner of their section. The field house was an early timber cottage moved to the playground from another site. Re- fencing in chain link occurred in 1935, further increasing security. In 1945 a war memorial hall was opened at the playground, designed by the City Architect and funded by public appeal supplemented by the state and local council. The tender was awarded to MR Hornibrook who completed the work for . The building was constructed to commemorate those from Paddington, Spring Hill and Fortitude Valley who served during World War II. The original supervisor's cottage was burnt down in 1959 and the Brisbane City Council donated the insurance money to the Playground Association to allow them to infill the undercroft of the Memorial Hall for use as a library. Mary Josephine Bedford died on 22 December 1955 and to commemorate her instrumental role in the provision of playgrounds in Queensland a memorial tree was planted on 22 March 1956 at the Spring Hill Playground by Lady Lavarck, wife of Lieutenant-General Sir John Dudley Lavarack, Governor of Queensland. In 1959 the Brisbane City Council agreed to the suggestion of the Playground and Recreation Association to rename the park, the Bedford Playground in memory of Ms Bedford. In December 1971 an area of land on the Quarry Street side of the park was excised for Health Purposes and this became the home of the Shaftsbury Citizenship Centre. Again, in March 1989 land at the corner of Quarry and Water Streets was excised for Local Government Purposes and this block of land is now the Lady Gowrie Occasional Child Care Centre, providing an additional service to the Lady Gowrie Child Care Centre which is at the St Paul's Terrace end of Love Street.  Description  Play equipment, 2008 Bedford Playground comprises a large area of open space incorporating tennis courts, play equipment, an old steam locomotive, an elevated timber hall, a number of established trees and a large outcrop of porphyry formerly used as a quarry. The reserve is bounded on three sides by Water, Love and Quarry Streets and on the fourth side by dense vegetation concealing development beyond to the south east. At the corner of Quarry and Waters, on excised land, is a fenced timber building used as the Lady Gowrie Occasional Child Care Centre. Entrance to the playground is via a driveway and pathway from Love Street. A high chain link fence surrounds the site. Where the ground is cut down for a road at the corner of Love and Water Streets, a retaining wall is clad with rubble stonework featuring recessed panels surrounded by concrete mouldings. A steel sign \\"BEDFORD PLAYGROUND\\" is adjacent to the entrance to the site. Within the playground, near the entrance of the playground is a large elevated hall with a substantially infilled undercroft. The building which has a rectangular plan running parallel to the Love Street boundary, has a gabled roof clad with \\"super six\\" corrugated fibrous cement sheeting. Strip windows line the long sides of the building and smaller individual windows are found on the shorter ends. Entrance to the building is via a straight timber stair on the north eastern facade. The most prominent feature of the playground is the large porphyry outcrop which is in the southern corner of the site. Partially concealing the outcrop are a large number of trees and plantings, growing around the base and on the stone itself. The outcrop has evidence of cutting on its north eastern face and varies in height from about . Also on this face of the outcrop is a plaque cut from the stone with lettering \\"BRISBANE CITY COUNCIL: THIS QUARRY IS PRESERVED FOR ITS GREAT GEOLOGICAL INTEREST\\". Cut into the north western side of the outcrop is a winding and uneven concrete stair, the dimensions of which suggest that it was built for the use of children. The stair leads to a path which winds north east through the vegetation on the top of the outcrop, leading to a now overgrown lookout. Recent metal, plastic and timber play equipment is found in the central part of the playground. Situated among the new equipment is a small play house known as the Betty Mansion, from the sign on the front of the structure. This is a model play version of a two storeyed interwar house, built on a concrete slab with reinforced concrete walls and finely detailed openings including a moulded and panelled front door. The entrance door is in a bay projecting from the front, north eastern facade. The bay terminates in a stepped parapet decorated with three vertical fins and the signage panel. Aside from this structure the early playground equipment has been replaced, although remnants of an Aladdin's Cave remain in the north western side of the outcrop and partially embedded concrete slabs provide evidence of earlier equipment. A tennis court is found on a raised terrace on the south eastern border of the playground, adjacent to the outcrop. A steam locomotive is located in the north western corner of the site and is surrounded by a large steel fence. One of the features of the playgrounds is the large number of established trees. Along the Water Street boundary are large shade trees providing privacy to the playground. Large trees are also found on the other boundaries and within the playground.  Heritage listing  Bedford Playground was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 9 May 1998 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Bedford Playground which was established in 1927 is important in demonstrating the pattern of growth of the working class suburbs of inner city Brisbane, particularly Spring Hill. The playgrounds demonstrate early twentieth century philosophies of child care, particularly in relation to the importance of adequately providing for children in poorer communities to provide a better chance of their future success. The playground contains a substantial porphyry outcrop, remnant from an early quarry which was established in the 1860s, providing evidence of the early construction industry of Brisbane and a rare example of \\"untamed\\" landscape in inner city Brisbane. The park is important as an integral example of the small number of open parks in the CBD and Spring Hill area. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. A rare example of \\"untamed\\" landscape in inner city Brisbane. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The playground demonstrates the principal characteristics of early model playgrounds formed by the Playground Association of Queensland and influenced by similar American models. This is particularly evident in the siting, and elements such as the memorial hall, the Betty Mansion (an early play fixture) and established plantings. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The site has aesthetic significance as a public open space with established plantings forming a substantial element of the Spring Hill townscape. The former quarry is of particular aesthetic interest as a bold, natural form visibly contrasting with its immediate surrounds and visually linked to the large outcrops on St Paul's Terrace. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The playground has special associations with the surrounding community as well known public recreation reserve and supervised children's playground. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Bedford Playground has a special association with Ms Mary Josephine Bedford, an early Brisbane philanthropist who successfully instigated many elements of family welfare in working class suburbs of Brisbane through her involvement with both the Playground Association and the Cr√®che and Kindergarten Association.

The program comes with an index to measure the design of disabled-friendly buildings and human resource policies. The flagship program has been launched by the Prime Minister on 3 December 2015, the International Day of people with Disabilities. The initiative also in line with the Article 9 of the (UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities) to which India is a signatory since 2007. The scheme also comes under Persons with Disabilities Act, 1995 under section 44, 45, 46 for equal Opportunities and protection of rights which provides non-discrimination in Transport to Persons with Disabilities.  Targets  According to the 2011 Census of India, 2.21 per cent of the population or approximately 26.8 million Indians suffer from a disability. The target is to make at least fifty percent government buildings disabled friendly under the campaign in each of the state capital and central capital till end of May 2018 and make 25 per cent of the public transport vehicles under government as disabled friendly till mid 2017. It also envisages further development with bigger targets in the following years. In this way, the overall environment becomes more inclusive and provides equal opportunities to the Pwd. A website will also be made where the people can put their views on the accessibility of any building. By July 2016, the international airports in the country and railway stations which come under A1, A and B categories will be made fully disabled-friendly. Special set-top boxes will be made available to make watching TV more convenient for the visually impaired. In the next 5 years, almost 200 people will be trained to speak in sign languages on government TV channels. Government websites will also be made more friendly by using text to speech option. The initiative involves retrofitting buildings, framing such standards for new buildings and transport that they are friendly to the differently-abled, auditing private companies on 'accessibility index' standard and making all government websites friendly to the differently-abled. A Sugamya Bharat mobile app which can provide information on disabled-friendly public facilities in a city, will be launched under the scheme. On 9 November 2017, RBI asked the banks to provide doorstep banking facilities to senior citizens of more than 70 years of age and differently-abled people including the visually-impaired. After it was found that targets under the Accessible India Campaign had been missed by 1-3 years, the government had set March 2020 as the new deadline for completing all the work under this initiative. Rating There will a collection of 10 private companies from different sectors including textiles and manufacturing which will be included in the ratings. The parameters will include investment in the training of the differently able employees and their career growth and the quality of facilities provided to them. The range of rating is 1 to 10. The structure of the points allotment and data management has been estimated by the department of disability affairs which comes under the ministry of social justice and empowerment. The government sees this campaign as an ethical push with the help of the index for the corporate sector under the Corporate social responsibility (CSR) and incentives will be given according to their performance. Other features The ministry of social justice and empowerment will give free motorized tricycles to people with 70-90% disability. Each state has to choose at least 50-100 public buildings which are friendly to people with disabilities. Till 2016, the program aims to make public buildings in 50 cities of the country under the prescribed guidelines. However, due to slow progress, revised deadlines had been extended to March 2020. For awareness, a team of experts will conduct workshops for sensitizing the main parties including builders and activists. The government will establish a special university for differently-abled people with a corpus of which will start functioning from the next academic year with special courses.  Works done  In August 2016, an online library Sugamya Pustakalaya (Accessible Library) was launched under the scheme by the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DEPwD) in collaboration with National Institute of Visually Handicapped, member organizations of Daisy Forum of India, Bookshare and TCS Access. The library would be a collection of all accessible materials from all over the country and the organizations who would become members of it would provide accessible material to its members. , 400 out of nearly 1800 websites of the Government of India were made accessible.

ARC processors are configurable and extensible for a wide range of uses in system on a chip (SoC) devices, including storage, digital home, mobile, automotive, and Internet of things (IoT) applications. They have been licensed by more than 200 organizations and are shipped in more than 1.5 billion products per year. ARC processors use reduced instruction set computing (RISC), and employ the 16-/32-bit ARCompact instruction set architecture (ISA) that provides good performance and code density for embedded and host SoC applications.  History  The ARC concept was developed initially within Argonaut Games through a series of 3D pipeline development projects starting with the Super FX chip for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. In 1995, Argonaut was split into Argonaut Technologies Limited (ATL), which had a variety of technology projects, and Argonaut Software Limited (ASL). At the start of 1996, the General Manager of Argonaut, John Edelson, started reducing ATL projects such as BRender and motion capture and investing in the development of the ARC concept. In September 1996 Rick Clucas decided that the value of the ARC processor was in other people using it rather than Argonaut doing projects using it and asked Bob Terwilliger to join as CEO; Rick Clucas then took on the role of CTO. In 1997, following investment by Apax Partners, ATL became ARC International and totally independent from Argonaut Games. Prior to their initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange, underwritten by Goldman Sachs and five other investment banks, three related technology companies were acquired: Metaware in Santa Cruz, California (development and modeling software),ARC Acquires MetaWare , www.edn.com, 1999-09-27 VAutomation in Nashua, New Hampshire (peripheral semiconductor IP), and Precise Software in Nepean, Ontario (RTOS). ARC International was acquired by Virage Logic in 2009. Virage was subsequently acquired by Synopsys in 2010, and ARC processors are now part of the Synopsys DesignWare series.  Design configuration  Designers can differentiate their products by using patented configuration technology to tailor each ARC processor instance to meet specific performance, power and area requirements. Configuration of the ARC processors occurs at design time, using the ARChitect processor configurator. The core was designed to be extensible, allowing designers to add their own custom instructions that can significantly increase performance or reduce power consumption. Unlike most embedded microprocessors, extra instructions, registers, and functionality can be added in a modular fashion. Customers analyse the task, break down the operations, and then choose the appropriate extensions, or develop their own, to create their own custom microprocessor. They might optimise for speed, energy efficiency or code density. Extensions can include, for example, a memory management unit (MMU), a fast multiplier‚Äìaccumulator, a USB host, a Viterbi path decoder, or a user's proprietary RTL functions. The processors are synthesizable and can be implemented in any foundry or process, and are supported by a complete suite of development tools.

She wrote novels, short stories, cultural criticism, and scripts. Her father, Edward Spencer Jenison, was a prominent Chicago architect who helped rebuild the city after The Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Her sister, Nancy Blanche Jenison, was a pioneering woman physician. In the early years of the 20th century Madge Jenison moved from Chicago to New York, where she found success with writing, primarily for magazines. She soon met sculptor John Frederick Mowbray-Clarke, at a dinner given by \\"some liberal group\\". He was immediately taken with her, later telling his wife, Mary Horgan Mowbray-Clarke, that he had been seated between \\"two of the most interesting women in America.\\" One was the biographer Katharine Anthony; the other was Madge Jenison. In late 1915, she conceived the idea that \\"a bookshop of a different kind must be opened in America.\\" Jenison co-founded The Sunwise Turn, a Modern Bookshop with Mary Horgan Mowbray-Clarke in a leased building at 2 E. 31st. Besides offering books which interested them personally they also held readings and sold paintings, prints, sculptures and textiles in the small shop. The Sunwise Turn was one of the first bookstores in the America to be run by women, and Jenison wrote in 1923 that \\"In the winter of 1919 - 20 we had eight unpaid apprentices - all women of a great deal of background. They sold thousands of dollars worth of books for us. They filed invoices. They swept floors. They ran on errands.\\"Jenison, Madge. Sunwise Turn: A Human Comedy of Bookselling. New York: E. P. Dutton & Company, 1923 One of their unpaid interns was Peggy Guggenheim. Working as an apprentice at the Sunwise Turn, she absorbed much about avant-garde culture, and it was there that she was introduced to the poet Margaret Anderson. Harold Loeb wrote of her at this time \\"Coming under Mary Clarke's spell Peggy gradually discarded many traditional taboos and adopted a whole set of new ones. Feeling guilty, no doubt, for having inherited wealth, she came to deny herself some of the luxuries to which she was accustomed In compensation she collected the latest in experimental painting and gave money and meals to poor artists and writers.\\"Dearborn, Mary V. Mistress of Modernism: The Life of Peggy GuggenheimHoughton Mifflin Co. 2004 p. 35 Arthur Davies, a principal organizer of the 1913 Armory Show along with John Frederick Mowbray-Clarke, was the designer of the interior of the shop. He chose a \\"burning orange\\" color for the walls and worked a prism of colors into the woodwork. Artists and writers featured at the bookshop included Theodore Dreiser, who gave the first reading on April 30. 1916. Robert Frost also gave a reading, as well as a host of others, both well-known and unknown. They showed work by artists such as William Zorach, Martha Ryther, Charles Burchfield, and Herbert E. Crowley. Jenison wrote that \\"At the end of four years we had branches in Detroit, in the Neighborhood Playhouse, and the Theatre Guild. We had sold books at garden lectures at the Colony Club, at the Socialist and Civil Liberties Conventions, at the International Conference of Women Physicians.\\" The Sunwise Turn also published a \\"broadsheet\\" which included poetry and art, as well as political and social commentary by various authors and artists. They also published full-length books in small editions, including a 500-copy edition of a study of sculptor Auguste Rodin by Rainer Maria Rilke in 1919. Periodicals to which Jenison contributed short stories and social commentary included Harper's Monthly, and The Atlantic in the early 1900s, as well as in later years.Jenison, Madge, The Church and the Social Unrest 'The Outlook', May 16, 1908 pp. 112‚Äì114Jenison, Madge True Believer: A Story The Harpers Monthly, August 1938, pp. 262‚Äì271 She published several books in her lifetime: Dominance (1928), Invitation to the Dance (1929), Roads (1949), and her account of the early years of the Sunwise Turn, Sunwise Turn: A Human Comedy of Bookselling (1923).

There is also focus on disarming various militant groups, such as the Islamic separatist groups in Mindanao and the communist rebel groups such as the New People's Army. The Philippines has also enacted laws as a result of many incidents of armed political violence during elections. During his presidency Ferdinand Marcos implemented gun confiscations against citizens. These were part of his martial law regime, what he referred to as \\"The New Society\\" or the Bagong Lipunan, as well as to quell the Moro separatist groups in Mindanao. Since then, gun control has become a moderate and strong issue in the Philippines. The ownership of firearms in the Philippines is regulated by the Firearms and Explosives Division of the Philippine National Police. In order to possess a firearm in the Philippines, a person must be at a minimum age of 21 years and pass a background check to be issued a Possession License. They must also take a firearms training and safety course. Any history of mental illnesses and/or domestic violence within the individual or the family will cause an applicant to have his request rejected. Guns are used for hunting, target shooting, self-protection and security purposes. Filipinos can carry pistols and handguns in public by acquiring a Permit to Carry. PROGUN is the main gun lobby of the Philippines, which is an organization meant to protect Filipino gun rights as well as to endorse politicians who will do so. According to a 2014 study, there are 1,700,000 licensed firearms owners and 3,900,000 privately owned guns (legally and illegally) in the country. History of firearm laws in the Philippines Gun control was a small issue in the Philippines. However, this became an issue during the various armed insurgencies that plagued the country in the 1960s and 1970s by Islamic militants in Mindanao and communist groups throughout the country. Strict gun control was enacted in 1972 under the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos. Under Proclamation No. 1081, citizens were banned from carrying a firearm outside of their residences. Though, despite the government claims that this was a temporary gun control law, citizens often fell victim to door-to-door searches for firearms. Confiscated firearms were not returned. During the 2010 election season, on January 10, a ban was implemented which completely prohibited citizens from carrying firearms into the public, with no exceptions. Off-duty police officers carrying their guns in the public were arrested for failure to comply with the law. This gun ban was a measure to prevent political killings, as the Philippines often deals with armed conflict during elections such as the Maguindanao Massacre. This move saw opposition from the gun lobby, especially from members of PROGUN. On May 29, 2014 Benigno Aquino III signed Republic Act 10591. This required gunsmiths to contain licenses to repair registered firearms. The law also required gun owners to renew their licenses every two years, and registration of their guns every four years. Failure to comply will result in revocation as well as confiscation of guns. This new law also required people who wish to carry their firearms outside of their residence to apply for a Permit to Carry, under good reason. These permits are often given to high-profile people. Current gun ownership law =Republic Act 10591= Qualifications to carry guns were set forward by Republic Act 10591 (RA 10591) or the Comprehensive Firearms and Ammunition Regulation Act, an act providing for a comprehensive law on firearms and ammunition and providing penalties for violations thereof. RA 10591 stipulates that people seeking to carry a gun may apply for a Permit to Carry (PTC). PTCs are granted on a May-Issue basis at the discretion of the issuing authority. A qualified person may apply for a PTC if he or she is under actual threat. The law specifies professionals who are considered to be in imminent danger due to the nature of their profession, occupation or business. These include lawyers or members of the Philippine Bar, certified public accountants, accredited media practitioners, cashiers, bank tellers, priests, ministers, rabbis and imams, physicians, nurses, and engineers. Businessmen who, by nature of their business or undertaking, are exposed to the high risk of being targets of criminal elements are also allowed to apply for PTC. Section 10 of RA 10591 also specifies the firearms that may be registered. Only small firearms may be registered by licensed citizens or licensed juridical entities for ownership, possession, and concealed carrying. The act also provides for the procurement of arms for use by law enforcement and military personnel. It states that a light weapon shall be lawfully acquired or possessed exclusively by the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the Philippine National Police (PNP) and other law enforcement agencies authorized by the president in the performance of their duties. =Licensing and registration= RA 10591 lays out the licensing and registration requirements for firearms. First and foremost, all firearms must be registered with the PNP. Firearms for use in sports and competitions also require licensing. Firearm and ammunition manufacturers must also apply for licenses. Gun stores are also required to have a license based on the new law for the purchase and sale of guns, as well as general business in handling firearms and ammunition. Gunsmiths must also apply for a license before they may repair registered firearms. Current laws require gun owners to renew their licenses every two years on or before the date of expiration. If they fail to renew their licenses, it will be automatically revoked, resulting in the lawful confiscation of the firearm by the PNP. The registration of the firearm must also be renewed every four years. Failure to renew the registration of the firearm on or before the date of expiration shall cause the revocation of the license of the firearm. The firearm shall be confiscated or forfeited in favor of the government. Failure to renew a license or registration within the periods mandated by the new law on two occasions shall cause the holder of the firearm to be perpetually disqualified from applying for any firearm license. The application for the renewal of the license or registration may be submitted to the Firearms and Explosives Office (FEO) of the PNP within six months before the date of the expiration of such license or registration.

These cities are subordinate to the raion authorities and derive their powers from them. The KOATUU national classification system refers to them as the third-level of the country's administrative divisions. there are 276 cities of district significance in Ukraine. Cities of district significance are automatically considered as \\"small cities\\", a status which is recognized by a few normative acts of the Verkhovna Rada, the Ukrainian parliament. Ukrainian law designates these populated places with populations of up to 50,000. In 2008, the average population of a city of district significance was 13,400. Small cities can belong to one of several specific economic categories, often having a regional transportation significance, important local industry, or an important historical and tourist attraction. , 63 of the 276 cities of district significance are members of the Association of Small Cities of Ukraine, a public organization that was registered in 2011 to recognize the common issues of small cities in general and to further promote their development. Characteristics Under Ukrainian law, every city of district significance automatically belongs to the category of \\"small cities\\" (, ), which is defined by the law \\"On the Approval of the National Program of the Development of Small Cities\\" dated 4 March 2005 as cities which have populations of up to 50,000. These small cities have populations of up to 50,000, and they contain a certain amount of social and industrial infrastructure within their boundaries. They have a proportionally lower rate of industrial expansion compared to cities of regional significance, however, they allow for favorable conditions for the creation of social, cultural, household, communal areas to meet the needs of its urban residents and the surrounding district countryside. A large number of these cities are centered on important industrial enterprises, creating the need of maintaining a favorable economic climate for industry. Cities of district significance are often the administrative centers of the districts they are located in. The lives of approximately 22 million inhabitants (both urban and rural) are tied in with the socio-economic activities of small cities, which plays an important role in the development of suburbs and the Ukrainian economy. The law \\"On the General Scheme of the Territorial Planning of Ukraine\\" is Ukraine's comprehensive general plan, which was adopted on 7 February 2002. It organizes small cities into five different categories: # cities that are adjacent to the geographical centers of local population; # cities with a significant recreational and health potential; # cities with a significant natural, historical and cultural potential; # cities that are important local centers of predominantly rural areas; # single-function cities. The law \\"On the Approval of the National Program of the Development of Small Cities\\" was adopted on 4 March 2005. It organizes small cities into seven economic categories: # cities of predominantly industrial functions; # regional transportation crossroads; # sanatorium-resorts and recreational centers; # historical, historical-architectural, cultural, and tourist centers; # administrative centers of rural raions (districts); # business centers of local importance; # important local centers of society, cultural, communal, and other services. Legal sphere Out of all of the cities of district significance, the city of Boyarka, Kyiv Oblast has the largest population at 35,320 (2013 est.). The Constitution of Ukraine and the 1997 law \\"On the Local Self-Governance in Ukraine\\" defines cities as independent units of administrative-territorial structures, which manage their own local self- government, economic, and financial activities. However, there is no clearly defined mechanism for designating populated places as cities of district significance under Ukrainian law. Rather, these cities are designated based on old Soviet laws such as the decree of the Presidium of the Verkhovna Rada of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic \\"On the Resolution of the Administrative-Territorial Structure of Ukrainian SSR\\" dated 12 March 1981. The legal competence of designating populated places as cities of district significance belongs to the Ukrainian parliament subject to proposals from the executive committees of regional and city councils. The 1981 decree stipulates that populated places are designated as cities of district significance if they have important regional industry, communal utilities, and networks of social, cultural, and business enterprises. In addition, they have to have populations of over 10,000 people, of which not less than 2/3 were workers, employees, and their families. The presidium's decrees, \\"On the Resolution of the Administrative-Territorial Structure of Ukrainian SSR\\" and \\"On the Practice of Applying the Legislation on the Order of Naming and Renaming of Administrative-Territorial Units and Populated Places of the Republic\\" were to have expired after the Ukrainian parliament adopted the law \\"On the Administrative-Territorial Composition of Ukraine\\". However, to this day, such a law has not been passed. Governance Local government in cities of district significance is delegated to their popularly elected mayoral administrations and legislative city councils, which derive their authority from the law \\"On the Local Self-Governance in Ukraine\\". These councils are local government areas that may often contain some urban-type settlements and rural localities under their jurisdiction aside from the respective cities themselves. Local elections take place nationwide every four years, and elect anywhere from 12-46 deputies, depending on the city's population. Cities of district significance receive their funding through the rural raion state administrations they are subordinate to, amidst other sources of local revenue, as determined by the Budget Code of Ukraine. In 2015, the Association of Small Cities of Ukraine criticized the adoption of the 2015 Ukrainian budget, which they stated limited the authority of local government institutions throughout Ukraine, contrary to what was proposed by all five of the coalition parties in parliament as part of decentralization in Ukraine. Statistics The 2010 urbanization rate: Lviv, Donetsk, and Luhansk oblasts have the largest number of cities of district significance with 30% of them. Although not every small city is designated as a city of district significance, in 2003 there were a total of 305 such small cities, which is 3/4 of the total number of cities in Ukraine, and 13% of the total population (19% of the urban population). In 2003, 15 cities had a population of up to 5,000; 66 cities had populations between 5,000‚Äì10,000; 160 cities had populations between 10,000‚Äì20,000; 109 cities had populations between 20,000‚Äì50,000. A majority of small cities (160 total) belong to the 10‚Äì20,000 population range. The locations of cities of district significance throughout Ukraine is unevenly distributed throughout Ukraine's 24 oblasts (regions) and the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. The number of cities of district significance varies depending on the level of urbanization in a specific region. The region with the largest number of cities of district significance is Lviv Oblast in western Ukraine with 35 such cities, which is close to 80% of the oblast's city population. Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts also have a proportionally larger number of cities of district significance with 24 (46% of the oblast's city population) and 23 (62% of the oblast's city population), respectfully. Half of the cities of district significance are located within just six oblasts, not to mention that 94% of all of the cities in Ternopil Oblast and 82% in Chernivtsi Oblast are designated cities of district significance. These numbers are particularly higher than those in other regions throughout Ukraine due to a lower number of larger cities that could meet the status of cities of regional significance. Out of the 276 cities of district significance, 89 of them (32% of them) are not administrative centers of their surrounding rural raions. Only four out of 24 cities of district significance in Donetsk Oblast are administrative centers; seven out of 23 in Luhansk Oblast; three out of seven in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast; and 17 out of 35 in Lviv Oblast. Every city of district significance in Cherkasy, Khmelnytskyi, Mykolaiv, Rivne, Zhytomytr, and Zakarpattia oblasts are also administrative centers of their respective raions. Nomenclature A city of district significance can also be referred to as a city of district importance, depending on the translation from the original Ukrainian terminology. For the same category of cities in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, the subject of a territorial dispute between Russia and Ukraine, the term for this type of urban populated place is a city of district subordination (, ). Cities of district significance and similarly named categories date back to the forms of local government and administrative divisions of Soviet Union. In countries of the former Soviet Union, these types of cities are subject to similar characteristics and economic categories as those that are located in Ukraine. In neighboring Russia, they are referred to as cities of district significance (, ), while in Belarus, they are known as cities of district subordination (, ).

It was designed by architect Richard George Suter and built in 1874 by Dennis & Sons with further additions through to . It is also known as Leichhardt Street School, and Leichhardt Street State School for Boys, Girls, Infants. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. In 2018 the principal is Michael Grogan.  History  Central State School for Boys, circa 1890 Agitation for a primary school in the Spring Hill area commenced in 1873, culminating in the establishment of three separate schools - Leichhardt Street Boys' School, Leichhardt Street Girls' School, and Leichhardt Street Infants' School (later renamed Brisbane Central State School). Opening 25 January 1875 on a large site, the schools were initially accommodated in one building built in 1874. As attendance grew, other buildings were constructed, including; a playshed (1887); a high-set, timber classroom building for the boys' school (1909); a timber classroom building for the practising school (); a brick building for the infants' school (); as well as playgrounds, extensive cuttings, retaining walls, landscaping and plantings. The provision of state- administered education was important to the colonial governments of Australia. In 1848 the New South Wales Government established National Schools. This was continued by the Queensland Government after the colony's creation in 1859. The Education Act 1860 established the Queensland Board of General Education and began to standardise curriculum, teacher training, and facilities. The Education Act 1875 provided a number of key initiatives for primary education; it was to be free, compulsory and secular. The Department of Public Instruction was established to administer the Act. This move standardised the provision of education and, despite difficulties, colonial educators achieved a remarkable feat in bringing basic literacy to most Queensland children by 1900. The establishment of schools was considered an essential step in the development of early Queensland communities. The formal education of Queensland children was seen as integral to the success of a town, the colony, and the nation. Land and construction labour was often donated by the local people and schools frequently became a major focus within the community as a place symbolising progress, for social interaction, and as a source of pride. Also, the development and maintenance of schools frequently involved donations and work by teachers, parents, and pupils. Because of their significant connections with the local community, schools have occasionally incorporated other socially important elements such as war memorials and halls used for community purposes. They also typically retain a significant enduring connection with former pupils, their parents, and teachers. Social events involving a wide portion of the local community have often been held at schools, utilising the buildings and grounds - such as fetes, markets, public holiday celebrations, school break-up days, fundraisers, sporting events, reunions, and dances. As in other Australian colonies, the Queensland Government developed standard plans for its school buildings. This helped to ensure consistency and economy. The standard designs were continually refined by government architects in response to changing needs and educational philosophy. Queensland school buildings were particularly innovative in their approach to climate control, lighting, and ventilation. Due to the standardisation of facilities, schools across the state were developed in distinctly similar ways and became complexes of typical components. These components included: the teaching buildings, the school yard, the horse paddock that was often later configured into a sports oval, and a variety of features such as sporting facilities or play equipment, shade structures, gardens and trees. The initial school building for the Leichhardt Street schools was a low-set, one-storey, brick structure designed by established Brisbane architect Richard George Suter. Suter was a private architect commissioned from 1865 by the Board of General Education to design school buildings. After 1868, Suter was responsible for most of the Board's buildings until 1875. As an architect in the early years of the colony, Suter was prolific despite only practicing for approximately 10 years in Queensland and had a strong influence on the establishment of Queensland architecture, being credited with introducing \\"outside studding\\" construction technique to the state. Suter's Brisbane school buildings were of brick construction. His initial designs were simple, low-set, structures with gable roofs, and rectangular in plan. In 1873 he introduced an \\"improved plan\\" adding front and rear verandahs to provide hat rooms and additional play and classroom space beginning a distinctive design solution of \\"classroom and verandah\\" that continued through evolution until at least the 1960s. The contract to construct the Suter building for the Leichhardt Street schools was let on 5 February 1874 to builders Dennis & Sons, with a price of . The T-shaped building had three large classrooms - the long front wing held two classrooms, one each for the boys' and girls' schools, and projecting to the rear was one classroom for the infants' school. The building had a symmetrical front elevation with a projecting central room flanked by a small teachers' room either side and a verandah along the front and rear. Enrolments by October 1875 totalled 241 boys, 176 girls, and 250 infants. In 1887 a playshed was built at the school. This was a timber-framed, open-sided shelter with a gable roof measuring . The Queensland education system recognised the importance of play in the school curriculum and, as well as classrooms, they provided plans for playsheds, free-standing shelters that provided covered play space and were often used for unofficial teaching space when needed. They were timber- framed structures, generally open on all sides although were sometimes partially enclosed with timber boards or corrugated galvanised iron sheets. The hipped (or less frequently, gabled) roofs were clad with timber shingles or corrugated iron and they had an earth or decomposed granite floor. Fixed timber seating ran between the perimeter posts. Playsheds were a typical addition to state schools across Queensland between s and the 1950s. They were mostly built to standard designs that ranged in size relative to student numbers. School sites were typically cleared of all vegetation and the provision of all-weather outdoor space was needed. After school buildings were high-set, allowing students to play in the understorey and playsheds were not frequently constructed. In 1889 a Grand Gala Tree-planting Day was held at the Leichhardt Street schools site. Prior to this, the grounds were described as barren. The provision of outdoor play space was a result of the early and continuing commitment to play-based education, particularly in primary school. Trees and gardens were planted as part of beautification of the school. In the 1870s, schools inspector William Boyd was critical of tropical schools and amongst his recommendations was the importance of the addition of shade trees in the playground. Landscape elements were often constructed to standard designs and were intrinsic to Queensland Government education philosophies. Educationalists believed gardening and tree planting instilled in young minds the value of hard work and activity, improved classroom discipline, developed aesthetic tastes, and inspired people to stay on the land. Aesthetically designed gardens were encouraged by regional inspectors. More than 50 shade and ornamental trees supplied by the Department of Agriculture were planted in the Leichhardt Street school grounds by its scholars. It was seen as a great success and sparked the introduction of Queensland-wide Arbor Day celebrations the following year. Between 1889 and 1892 about 150 trees were planted in the school grounds. From the school's opening, the Suter building was overcrowded and had other problems, including poor lighting and ventilation. From 1893 the Department of Public Works became responsible for school design and worked to greatly improve its standard designs to address the natural ventilation and lighting of classroom interiors. The department's architects experimented with different combinations of roof ventilators, ceiling and wall vents, larger windows, dormer windows and ducting. Roof ventilators became fleches which grew larger as the experimentation continued. Prior to the widespread adoption of electricity and artificial lighting, achieving an ideal or even adequate level of natural light in classrooms, without glare, was of critical importance to educators and consequently it became a primary determinant of the design concept and layout of all school buildings. From around 1909 windows were rearranged and enlarged to provide a greater amount of gentle, southern light into the room and desks were rearranged to have the light falling onto the students' left hand side. This reduced glare, and, since students were forcibly right-handed, did not throw a shadow onto the page. This often meant a complete transformation of the fenestration of existing buildings. Windows were larger and sills were lowered to let in more light generally. Smaller classrooms were preferred as they were easier to light correctly. Interiors became lighter and airier and met with immediate approval from educationalists. Over time, the Leichhardt Street schools' Suter building was altered to improve lighting and ventilation of the interior to standard designs by the department. In skylights were added to the roof either side of the spire to aid internal lighting of the classrooms. In these were replaced with dormer windows, and a large arched window was added to the end (south- eastern) wall. To further improve the internal light conditions the rear verandah was removed between 1918 and 1933. The projecting infants' wing was demolished in 1933, replaced by an asphalted assembly area. Banks of casement windows were added to the rear wall to greatly increase the natural lighting and ventilation of the classrooms. This work is typical of the standard \\"improvements\\" designed by the Department of Public Works that were made to older education buildings to meet evolving education philosophies espoused by the Department of Education of over time. Overcrowding continued at the Leichhardt Street schools and in 1909 a new high-set, timber classroom building was built to the south of the Suter building for the boys' school. This was built to a new standard design introduced in . This high-set, timber design provided better ventilation as well as further teaching space and a covered play space underneath. This was a noticeable new direction and the high-set form became a characteristic of Queensland schools. The understorey of this new building at Leichhardt Street was enclosed between June 1922 and June 1923. By 1914 a separate building for the Infants' School had been constructed to the northeast of the Suter building. In 1927 the Brisbane Normal School (Adelaide Street) was closed for demolition and its teachers and students were transferred to Leichhardt Street State School. The Leichhardt Street school also took over the Normal School's role of training teachers. On 4 September 1927, the three Leichhardt Street schools operating from the site (boys', girls', and infants' schools) closed and re-opened the next day under one head teacher as the Leichhardt Street State and Practising School (unofficially known as the Central Practising School). To accommodate the large increase in pupils, teachers and trainee teachers, additional buildings and toilets were constructed at the school. One of these was a classroom building for the practising school built facing St Pauls Terrace. It stood on the highest part of the site, separated from the rest of the school by a tall, concrete retaining wall. During the 1930s and 1940s, the school was known as the \\"Scholarship Factory\\" due to the high success rate of its pupils in the high school scholarship examinations. Many of its teachers and pupils became prominent identities, including Jack Pizzey and Sir Douglas Tooth. The school was officially renamed the Brisbane Central State School in 1954. A fire damaged the north-western end of the Suter building in 1973. New Infants School under construction, July 1950 New Infants School under construction, 1st and 2nd sections, April 1951 A large, new brick infants building was constructed at the Water Street end of the site, replacing the earlier infants building. Beginning in the 1950s, school designs were altered with a goal of modernisation. Classrooms had extensive areas of windows; almost the entirety of the verandah wall and the opposite classroom wall were glazed, allowing abundant natural light and ventilation. The proliferation of stumps in the understorey was replaced with steel, timber and sometimes concrete trusses that spanned the width of the classroom and provided an unimpeded play space while minimising costs. While the majority of school buildings were built to standard plans, as in other periods, some buildings were also constructed that were individually designed. These were typically constructed in areas of stable, suburban and urban populations and were an evolution of the urban brick school buildings of the early 1900s and depression-era brick school buildings. They were generally substantial structures of brick and concrete that introduced many innovative ideas that found their way into standard plans. For example, brick was progressively used more frequently in high schools as standard. The new infants' building at Brisbane central State School was one of these non-standard designs. Designed in 1949 by the Department of Public Works, construction was completed in the financial year ending June 1952. The building included five classrooms, one kindergarten room, and an open understorey play area. It was occupied by the school until when use of the building was given to the Department of Health. The building was then used as the Brisbane Institute of Child Guidance, which operated as a separate entity to the school. This new use was officially opened 6 April 1966. The land around the former infants' building was subdivided off and formally transferred to the Department of Health in 1991. Remedial structural work was performed on the building at this time. The Practising School left Brisbane Central State School . Its building facing St Paul's Terrace was transferred to the Department of Health and used as the Children's Dental Hospital, operating separating from the school. Later, the dental hospital moved out and in the building was transferred back to school use. The interior was extensively refurbished in 2010 to create a single large space for assembly. Over time, buildings and structures were added to and removed from the school grounds to accommodate different education programs or to provide new facilities. New toilets were constructed in 2004 and the toilets were demolished in 2012. A low-set classroom building was constructed adjacent to the rear of the Suter building in . Enrolments at Brisbane Central State School fluctuated from over 1000 students during the 1930s to fewer than 100 during the 1980s to 220 in 2013. In 2014, the school retains the 1874 Suter building, the 1887 playshed, the 1909 former boys' school building, the former practising school building, the former infants' school building, playgrounds, extensive cuttings, retaining walls, landscaping and mature tree plantings. In 2014, the school is the only remaining inner-city state school and is surrounded by a mix of early Spring Hill housing and modern structures.  Description  Brisbane Central State School, built on terraced terrain, comprises a number of elements, including: the Suter building (1874); a play shed (1887); the former boys' school high-set, timber classroom building (1909); the former practising school building (); the former infants' school building (completed by June 1952); playgrounds; and extensive cuttings, retaining walls, landscaping and plantings. The Suter building is a one- storey, low-set brick structure with a gabled roof clad with corrugated metal sheets. It faces south-west to the main entrance into the grounds on Victoria Street, and the vista of the building from the entrance is framed by trees. It is a long and narrow building aligned south-west and north-east with a timber- framed verandah along the front. The verandah is interrupted by a central, projecting gabled classroom and either side of this is an attached pair of timber-framed and -clad teaching rooms. Surmounting the centre of the roof is a square-based spire and along the ridge are timber- framed, ventilated dormer windows. The brick walls of the building stand on Brisbane tuff footings and the timber-framed portions stand on concrete posts or brick piers. The building features highly crafted, decorative brickwork including: running corbel friezes under the eaves and gable barge boards; a variety of corbelled decorations; and lancet niches. The rear (north-eastern) wall is cement rendered, scored to mimic coursed stone and has a series of timber-framed casement windows with fanlights, sheltered by timber-framed hoods. The south- eastern gable end wall has a large bricked-in arch. The layout comprises five classrooms facing north-east and one central classroom facing south-west, all accessed from the verandah. The three southern classrooms have timber-lined walls and ceiling with timber roof framing exposed within the space. The other two rooms have suspended ceilings and a masonite sheeting partition. The playshed is a timber-framed, open-sided shelter with a gable roof supported by timber posts with brackets. The gable ends are clad with timber weatherboards. The roof is clad with corrugated metal sheets and the ceiling is lined with timber, v-jointed boards with a ventilation gap between cladding and ceiling. It has a concrete floor and perimeter seating. The former boys' school high- set building is very intact and stands adjacent to a tall, brick-faced retaining wall on its north-eastern side. It is a timber-framed building clad with timber weatherboards and has a gable roof clad with corrugated metal sheets. It is high-set on tall brick piers and the understorey is enclosed with timber weatherboards. A timber stair on the north-western side provides access to the upper level. The upper level has a verandah on the north-eastern and south-western sides, partially enclosed on the latter by more recent sheet material and on both sides by modern steel screens. The verandah walls are single-skin with externally exposed stud framing. Between the studs are timber-framed, horizontal-pivot windows with high sills. The gable end windows are later, steel-framed louvres with original, timber-framed hoods. The upper level comprises one large classroom, accessed from both verandahs via timber, double- leaf doors with horizontal-pivot fanlights. The well-proportioned interior has a high, coved ceiling and is lined with timber, v-jointed boards. A metal tie rod between the verandah walls at cornice height is exposed within the space. The former practising school building stands on the easternmost corner of the site and faces St Paul's Terrace to the south-east. This is a large, timber-framed building clad with timber weatherboards and has a gable roof clad with corrugated metal sheets. It is a high-set building and its understorey is enclosed. The interior layout on both levels is not original; all partitions of the upper floor are demolished to form one large space. The former infants' school stands on the lowest part of the site near the corner of Rogers and Water Streets, separated from the main part of the school by a tall stone-faced retaining wall. Accessed from a curving driveway from Rogers Street, the long, narrow building is a two-storey, facebrick structure with a hipped, tiled roof. The area for the former infants' school is divided into two level areas by a large concrete retaining wall and the school building sits against the wall on the lower level, accessible at grade from both sides. The principal entry is from the driveway into the upper (formerly classroom) level. This entrance is emphasised by large porthole windows, a sweeping, cantilevered concrete awning and curved steps, and a set of large, bifolding, glazed, timber-framed entrance doors. A verandah, enclosed with more-recent glazing, runs along the length of the northern side and a stair at the entry and at the western end leads down to the lower level (formerly open play space). The classrooms and the understorey are subdivided by later, lightweight partitions to form offices; although the original layout is discernible. The walls between former classrooms and the verandah have been demolished. The upper level retains south-facing, timber-framed casement windows and fanlights and sheet-and-batten ceilings. The school grounds are terraced to form levelled playing areas and feature mature ornamental trees including: camphor laurels (Cinnamomum camphora), figs, hoop pines, (Araucaria cunninghamii), palms, jacarandas (Jacaranda mimosifolia), poincianas (Poinciana regia), and eucalypts, as well as gardens and other plantings.  Heritage listing  Brisbane Central State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Brisbane Central School, established in 1875, is significant historically for its close association with the development of Spring Hill as an early dormitory suburb of Brisbane, and as one of the oldest extant brick schools in Queensland. It is the last remaining inner-city state school in Brisbane and is important for its historical role in Queensland teacher education. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is important in illustrating the principal characteristics of 1870s state school design in Queensland. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The place has an aesthetic appeal engendered principally by the early form, materials and siting of the 1870s building within grounds with mature trees and landscaping, and makes an aesthetic contribution to the historic Spring Hill townscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It has a strong association for the Brisbane community with the evolution of Spring Hill as one of the city's most historic districts. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The 1874 building is an excellent example of an institutional building by Brisbane architect RG Suter, and displays a high quality of design and craftsmanship.

Built as an aviso, she served as the imperial yacht Reine Hortense from 1853.  Career  Laid down as Comte d'Eu, the ship was renamed to Patriote on 20 February 1848 after the French Revolution of 1848. In June 1853, she became the imperial yacht Reine Hortense. In 1855, she served as a troopship to ferry forces bound for the theatre of the Crimean War. Reine Hortense ferried Prince Napol√©on Bonaparte from Marseille to Genoa in early 1859 for his marriage to Princess Maria Clotilde of Savoy, and Napol√©on III from Marseille to Genoa on 11 and 12 May 1859. Returned to the French Navy in 1854. In 1862 she was in the Baltic when she gave aid to a British vessel who she towed her 80 miles from Bomarsund to Stockholm, on board had been Lord Dufferin, who she was to meet again 3 years later. The Reine Hortense was recommissioned as the imperial yacht on 20 April 1865 for an official visit in Algeria. In June 1856 she took Prince Napol√©on on an expedition to Greenland, with the Art√©mise (1847), a 28-gun corvette, La Perdrix\\" and, the \\"cocyte\\", and two British coal tender screw steamers, the \\"Tasmania\\" and the \\"Saxon\\" of 700 tons each. On 30 June at Reykjav√≠k in Iceland, she met again Lord Dufferin who was on his own travels that would feature in his book Letters From High Latitudes, published the next year. Dufferin's journey was taking in Iceland, Jan Mayen and Spitzbergen. He had chartered the schooner Foam for the task. Dufferin was invited to join Prince Napoleon aboard his royal steamer, and the Prince on hearing that the \\"Foam\\" had broken down offered them a tow north to Jan Mayen as they were going to the same region. On their last night in Reykavik the prince held a ball to which all the rank, fashion, and beauty of the tiny town (population 700 or 800) were invited. The \\"Foam\\" was attached with two cables and the flotilla set off on 7 July, the collier \\"Saxon\\" traveling all too slowly behind. The fragile La Reine Hortense was soon to be in increasing danger from the ice and the French were required to abandon their journey 100 miles short of Jam Mayen, and return to Reykjav√≠k. So on 11 July they let loose the \\"Foam\\" to carry on north by sail. This was fortuante in a sense since on their return they were to discover that the Saxon had been damaged by ice, and would have meant that the convoy would have been short of fuel. This effectively cancelled the expediton. Reine Hortense was again decommissioned in October. On 14 February 1867, she was renamed to Cassard, and commissioned for the Algiers station. In her military role, her performances inspired a whole generation of commerce raiding cruisers; these ships, inexpensive, unarmoured sail and steam corvettes or frigates with a relatively heavy armament, proved useful to enact gunship diplomacy around the world, but became obsolete after the Franco-Prussian War. Navires et Histoire, n¬∞29, April 2005, page 83 Cassard served there until 1881, when she was decommissioned in Toulon before becoming a littoral defence ship. Renamed to Faune in 1893, she was used as a hulk in Port-Vendre. She was eventually broken up in 1920.

The paper has been criticized by numerous sources over the years for its sexist representations of women. The campaign's first aim is to persuade the newspaper to stop publishing photographs of the \\"BILD- Girl,\\" a topless model. It also asks that the newspaper start reporting on women and women's issues in the same way that it writes about men. Stop Bild Sexism was inspired by the No More Page 3 campaign in the UK to persuade The Sun newspaper to abandon its practice of publishing images of half-naked women.  History of the campaign  The campaign began in October 2014 with a petition posted on Change.org by Kristina Lunz, a postgraduate student at the University of Oxford, asking the Bild's editor, Kai Diekmann, to remove the topless \\"BILD-Girl\\" from the publication. The petition was discussed on Twitter under the hashtag #BILDsexism.Eul, Alexandra (16 November 2014). \\"Kampagne: Schafft das Bild-Girl ab!\\", EMMA.Burgard, Benjamin (11 November 2014). \\"#BILDsexism: Studentin (25) fordert von Kai Diekmann Abschaffung des Bild-Girls\\", S√ºdkurier. The newspaper stopped publishing topless images on its front page in 2012, but they are still published inside the newspaper and on its website.Harcup, Tony (2014). A Dictionary of Journalism, Oxford University Press, p. 36. On 17 September 2014 it published photographs of the cleavages of six well-known German women on its front page, and asked readers to rate them. Sophia Becker, the campaign's social-media manager, cited this as an example of the newspaper's pattern of objectifying women and normalizing sexism.Becker, Sophia (2014). \\"Sexism in The Media & Its Violent Implications\\", Zod.Lunz, Kristina (11 June 2015). \\"Warum es wichtig ist, dass wir uns √ºber Diskriminierung aufregen\\", The Huffington Post. Lunz has described Bild's reporting of sexual assault and harassment as \\"sexist and voyeuristic.\\" She asserts that the tone of outrage found in the publication's frequent reporting of cases of sexual harassment and sexual violence appears to indicate that the anger over violence against women is only superficial, because it is juxtaposed with the publication's frequent use of images of unclothed women. Lunz and Becker said they were inspired by the No More Page 3 campaign, led by Lucy-Anne Holmes, which asked the editor of The Sun newspaper in the UK to voluntarily remove their similarly topless Page 3 models.  Reception  As of July 2019, the petition had over 58,000 signatures and has been recognized by Diekmann.

History In 1878, the first railway line in to Port Augusta was when it became the southern terminus of a proposed line to Darwin. Under South Australian ownership the narrow gauge railway, known as the Great Northern Railway, was extended in stages and reached Oodnadatta in 1891. In 1882, this line also connected Port Augusta to Adelaide when the Peterborough‚ÄìQuorn railway line was completed, as there was already railway from Peterborough to Adelaide. The Old Port Augusta railway station was on Commercial Road, and is now heritage listed and used as an art gallery. The railway continued through what later became railyards, through the original station, and down Commercial Road to the wharf area. The South Australian Government subsequently made offers to several syndicates to construct a line north from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek on the land grant system, however negotiations were unsuccessful and Oodnadatta remained the railhead. The line passed to Commonwealth ownership on 1 January 1911, but continued to be operated by the South Australian Railways until the Commonwealth Railways took over operations on 1 January 1926. An extension of the railway to Alice Springs was completed in 1929.History of the Pichi Richi Railway Pichi Richi Railway Between 1913 and 1917, the standard gauge Trans-Australian Railway was built from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie in Western Australia, entering the town from another direction and the station from the other end. Thus Port Augusta became a break of gauge station until the standard gauge line was extended to Port Pirie Junction in 1937. The new station provided for transfer of passenger and goods between trains on the standard gauge line to Kalgoorlie and the narrow gauge line to Oodnadatta and Adelaide (via Peterborough, and another break of gauge at Terowie). The new two-storey station building was and provided platform for standard gauge trains and platform for narrow gauge trains. In 1957, a new standard gauge Stirling North to Marree line was built via Leigh Creek, replacing the line via Quorn. In 1972, the Whyalla line opened to Whyalla to serve Whyalla Steelworks. In 2001, the narrow gauge line between Port Augusta and Quorn was re-opened by the Pichi Richi Railway Preservation Society.Port Augusta track extension project Pichi Richi Railway Port Augusta has long been an important railway centre, with Downer Rail having a plant in the city.Mayor disappointed with job losses The Transcontinental 9 May 2014Rail Rollingstock Downer Rail Journey Beyond's The Ghan and Indian Pacific services pass Port Augusta on the Adelaide-Port Augusta railway line but do not stop at the station.The Ghan Timetable 2019-2020 Journey Beyond References External links *Flickr gallery Category:Railway stations in South Australia Category:South Australian Heritage Register Category:Port Augusta ","title":"Port Augusta railway station"},{"id":"45246306","text":"Barbara Jaracz (born 8 June 1977), n√©e Grabarska, is a Poland chess Woman Grandmaster (2007).

It is north of Cisco Grove, California. The surrounding alpine forest contains 13 nearby lakes and streams supporting trout. There are so many lakes that some of them are just assigned numbers.  Former summer camp program  The Golden Empire and prior councils offered summer camp at Camp Cole for many years. In 2015 the camp was open for three weeks from July 20 to August 8. The cost was $250. When used as a Boy Scout summer camp, the program featured a six-day, trek through the nearby mountains known as the Cole Trek. Cole also offered Mountain Biking Treks, Rock Climbing, Mountain Man Program, and a unique Build Your Own Program week. A trading post provided snacks and merit badge supplies during camp. Meals during summer camp were served cafeteria style. The waterfront program included swimming, canoeing, snorkeling, small boats, and board-sailing. The camp provided a limited number of Scouts with a series of activities that helped them satisfy many of the requirements for First Class rank. Due to ongoing poor road conditions and the gift of land for a new camp at a lower elevation, the council stopped providing a summer camp program at Camp Cole in 2015.NorCal High Adventure  Current use  White Stag Sierra's contributions to improving the camp facilities and their long-term commitment to the camp. The camp is currently used by five Northern California stakes of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for their Young Men summer camp program during three weeks in July or August. It is also used for one week each summer by the White Stag Sierra leadership camp. They provide ongoing leadership development for youth 11-18. Attendees have come from as far as Mexico and China. Participants take part in challenging games and exercises designed to stimulate learning about leadership.  Hiking  To the northeast of Lake Sterling there is about a of glacial rock and ponds, originally called Glacier Lakes Basin Trails. The trail system usually follows watercourses and is prone to be wet after rain, requiring detours. The trails cross many many marsh areas as well. There are two marked trail systems, red and blue, accessible by crossing the dam, and staying to the right around a helipad. Both connect to Mossy Pond located to the northeast. The red trail is to the west (13E01A) and the blue trail veers east. From the dam the red trail goes left while the blue trail continues along the lake. The blue or east trail is easier, more popular, and is usually well marked. It is also usually wetter than the more challenging red trail to the west. The former Glacial Trails Council offered a patch and certificate to Scouts who completed a hike connecting Fordyce, Meadow, Paradise, Baltimore, and Lola Montez Lakes. Three Boy Scout councils collaboratively offer a patch for a Tri-Trek Trail that connects three Boy Scout camps: Camp Pahatsi (Golden Empire Council at Kilborne Lake), Camp Robert Cole (Golden Empire Council at Lake Sterling), and Camp Marin-Sierra (at Chubb Lake). Hikers can begin the loop at any of the three camps. From Camp Pahatis to Camp Cole is 12 miles; Camp Cole to Marin-Sierra is 25 miles; and Marin-Sierra to Camp Pahatsi is 21 miles. Boy Scouts can complete any section of the trek to qualify for the patch.  History  In 1924 the Buttes Area Council and the Mount Lassen Area Council were split from the former Sacramento Area Council. In 1952 and 1953 Buttes Area Council Executive Alden Barber worked closely with volunteers to identify a new summer camp site in the Sierra Nevada mountains near a lake. They found Lake Sterling, a Pacific Gas & Electric reservoir, and discovered that it was within of 13 other small lakes suitable for back country treks.13 Lakes They opened the Glacial Trails Scout Ranch at Sterling Lake in 1954. The property consisted of of land leased from the United States Forest Service and leased from Pacific Gas & Electric Company. The council built a permanent kitchen in 1957, and after a severe winter storm severely damaged it, were forced to rebuild it in 1958. It was reconstructed once again in 1970, during which volunteers also built a new staff dining building. The Buttes Area Council and the Mount Lassen Area Council were merged back into the Golden Empire Council, located in Sacramento, in 1993. The Golden Empire Council closed the Glacial Trails Scout Ranch in 2003 and 2004 when they were unable to pay for improvements required by the Placer County health dept and the U.S. Forest Service. Robert L. Cole, President of Goodwin-Cole Company, contributed $260,000 in a matching grant to help pay for the necessary upgrades. The camp was reopened as a high-adventure camp in 2005. After 53 years as the Glacial Trails Scout Ranch, the camp was renamed as Camp Robert L. Cole on July 21, 2007 to honor contributions made to the council and camp by Cole. The Cole family continued to support the camp and facilities through its closure as a council summer camp in 2015.  Weather  Due to the camp's altitude, snow may be present in camp during June and even July. On one July 4th weekend, Scout camp staff had to ski over snow drifts to access the camp, and the summer camp program was cancelled until mid August. During most years, the camp is accessible and free of snow by about July 1. The weather during summer camp season typically ranges from 56-94 ¬∞F. It rains an average of ¬Ω inch during July.  In popular media  The camp had a mountain biking program during the 1980s that was featured in an article in Boys' Life magazine in May 1989.

According to Al-Monitor, it may be the first time that young people in the West have been directly addressed by a senior Islamic cleric about his religion. Prompted by the Charlie Hebdo shooting in Paris on 7 January 2015 by militants who said that they had acted in the name of Islam, and writing about the current image of Islam in the West, Khamenei released the letter on his official website. It was also promoted via a Twitter account attributed to him. Khamenei appeals to his audience to have an open mind and not to judge Islam based on the Charlie Hebdo attacks, and implores Western youth to learn about Islam from its original sources, rather than have it \\"introduced to [them] by prejudices\\" and Islamophobia. In his letter he writes that he does not insist that young people accept his or any particular reading of Islam, but that he wants young people not to \\"allow this dynamic and effective reality in today's world to be introduced to [them] through resentments and prejudices\\". A second open letter was written by Khamenei on 29 November 2015, following the November 2015 Paris attacks. Content =Message to youth= Khamenei says that his letter, written in English, is addressed to young people who may still have open minds, not to Western leaders who, he writes, intentionally distort the truth. \\"I am addressing you, [the youth], not because I overlook your parents\\", but because \\"the future of your nations and countries will be in your hands; and also I find that the sense of quest for truth is more vigorous and attentive in your hearts\\". He further writes: \\"I don't insist that you accept my reading or any other reading of Islam. What I want to say is: Don't allow this dynamic and effective reality in today's world to be introduced to you through resentments and prejudices.\\" Ali Khamenei writer of letter He states his admiration for Western historians who, in his words, are \\"deeply ashamed of the bloodsheds wrought in the name of religion between the Catholics and Protestants or in the name of nationality and ethnicity during the First and Second World Wars\\". The question Khamenei asks here is why Western public awareness is focused on the distant past, \\"but not [on] current problems\\". He asks, \\"Why is it that attempts are made to prevent public awareness regarding an important issue such as the treatment of Islamic culture and thought?\\" This question leads him to the main issue that he wishes to communicate to young people: \\"Hence, my first request is: Study and research the incentives behind this widespread tarnishing of the image of Islam.\\" As part of this, he advises young people to read the Quran for themselves. \\"Have you studied the teachings of the Prophet of Islam and his humane, ethical doctrines? Have you ever received the message of Islam from any sources other than the media?\\", he asks. =Criticizing Islamophobia= Khamenei claims that Western countries are responsible for the creation of the so-called Islamic State, a violent militant group. He also often accuses the Western media of trying to stir up sectarian conflict between Shiites and Sunnis. According to CNN, while \\"chants of 'Death to America' have been a familiar refrain at Friday prayers and parliamentary sessions since the Islamic republic's founding in 1979,\\" the leader strikes a more conciliatory tone in the letter, writing: \\"Don't allow them [western countries] to hypocritically introduce their own recruited terrorists as representatives of Islam\\". That is part of a persisting trend that, he said, started after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. \\"This is a preplanned challenge between Islam and you,\\" he wrote, a twenty-year-long effort \\"to place this great religion in the seat of a horrifying enemy\\". \\"Why does the power structure in the world want Islamic thought to be marginalized and remain latent?\\" he asks the youth. \\"What concepts and values in Islam disturb the programs of the super powers and what interests are safeguarded in the shadow of distorting the image of Islam?\\" Promotion Radio Zamaneh stated that 80 \\"cultural representatives and advisers have been mobilized by Iran‚Äôs Islamic Culture and Relations Organization to travel to European and North American countries to promote a message from Iran‚Äôs Supreme Leader among the youth there\\". The Islamic Culture and Relations Organization also translated the letter into 21 languages. In his tweets responding to the 2015 kidnapping and beheading of Copts in Libya, Khamenei continued using the hashtag Letter4U. Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Foreign Minister of Iran, delivered a copy of the letter to UN General Secretary Ban Ki-moon. Al-Mustafa International University created a website with the letter and translation in various languages along with feedback and reactions from youth in different countries. Holly Dagres of Al-Monitor, commenting on the promotion of the letter by Khamenei's supporters on Instagram, wrote: > Ayatollah Khamenei‚Äôs followers in the virtual and literal sense ‚Äî through > #Letter4u ‚Äî actively spammed Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google+ and even > Tumblr with links and short messages that pose questions such as: \\"Searching > for the truth? Then #Letter4u is what you might want to read first,\\" or \\"Do > you know the leader of iran have written a letter for you??\\" ‚Äî all with the > aim to garner the attention of people in the West. On 16 March 2015, the University of Tehran and Press TV held a conference in Tehran on Khamenei's letter called \\"Seeking the Truth. Mohammad Marandi was the opening speaker at the conference. The letter is translated into Russian and distributed among people in the Moscow book fair. Reception of the letter Derek R. Ford of The Hampton Institute stated that \\"The questions raised in Ayatollah Khamenei‚Äôs recent letter can help combat the pervasive anti-Islam culture of the West, especially by locating Islamophobia as part of a longer history of ‚Äúphobia‚Äù spreading. When we ask the question, as Khamenei asks us to, as to why it is that the policy of spreading phobia has targeted Islam we immediately begin to see that it has nothing to do with religion, and everything to do with politics and economics. In other words, Khamenei‚Äôs letter helps us to link anti-Islamism with the agenda of imperialism and capitalism.\\" Esfandyar Batmanghelidj comments at the Europe-Iran Forum that it is unprecedented for Khamenei to address western youth in an open letter, however the strangest thing is that he speaks against dogma in his letter saying \\"I don't insist that you accept my reading or any other reading of Islam\\", while his county, Iran, is not famous for free speech. He released his letter on Twitter, a website which has been blocked in Iran since the presidential election in 2009, when people used the website to raise their protests. It seems Khamenei, himself, is aware of the contradiction, as he writes the letter from the standpoint of a scholar and not a leader. After the Iranian Revolution \\"cultural battles between reformists and traditionalists\\" have always been a serious problem in Iran through which Khamenei has gained the experience that intellectuals are better able to solve problems than leaders. It took Iran's leader a great breakthrough to realize that the conflict between Islamic Iran and the west was not fundamental and inevitable, but epistemological and solvable. Karim Sadjadpour, a senior Iran analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that the letter is revealing of Khamenei's \\"outsized confidence, dogmatic worldview, and victimization complex\\". American conservative pundit Michael L. Brown wrote a response letter to Khamenei. He praised the leader for using modern technology and attempting to bring harmony between civilizations, but also accused him of trying to stoke division between generations in the West. He went on to write \\"Your [sic] are concerned about Islamophobia writing, \\"I would like you to ask yourself why the old policy of spreading 'phobia' and hatred has targeted Islam and Muslims with an unprecedented intensity.\\" The answer, respected sir, is that our people and our buildings have been blown up by religious Muslims and our citizens have been beheaded by devout followers of Islam.\\" He then cites violent actions by groups such as the Taliban, Boko Haram, Al-Qaeda, ISIS and Hamas as being responsible for Islamophobia. Journalist Kate Zavadski of New York magazine wrote that \\"The open letter ends on a note of hope - perhaps foreshadowing the end of decades of \\"clash of civilizations\\" scholarship on Islam and the West.\\" Bruce Laingen, an American diplomat and former charg√© d'affaires of the United States Embassy in Iran, responded that \\"The ayatollah appears to have conveniently forgotten his personal role and that of his entire regime in the treatment of the American hostages in the hostage crisis of 1979-81.\\" Foreign Policy magazine wrote that \\"So far, the dozen-something tweets with the hashtag #Letter4U from Khamenei's official account have received several dozen retweets and likes, but none have gone viral\\". James S. Robbins commented in The National Interest that in his letter Khamenei \\"maintained that the view of Islam most young people receive is filtered through hostile governments and negative press reports.\\" He laments that \\"the White House is making little effort to promote the cause of freedom among Iran's youth.\\" Jordan Valinsky of Mic commented that \\"Perhaps his letter should have been addressed to Western media rather than Western youths: American cable news networks are routinely embarrassing themselves with \\"experts\\" and lines of guests who reinforce the \\"us vs. them\\" division between the West and the entire Muslim world after successive atrocities committed by Islamic militants. Charles Taliaferro, a professor at St. Olaf College, stated that \\"The more this message can be spread and interpreted as condemning both the caricature and false portrait of Islam as well as interpreted as a clear condemnation of those who commit cruel, wrongful acts in the name of Islam, the greater the success of Islam among the people of the West. Natalie Davis of The Algerian commented that while \\"the Western world still grieves, reeling from the Charlie Hebdo attacks, many may view Khamenei‚Äôs response as arrogant and insensitive. His hopefulness and prose seem disingenuous and strange. Nonetheless, with recent shifts in US-Iran relations and the directness of the tone, the audacity of penning this note seems permissible.\\" Faisal Mekdad, the Deputy Foreign Minister of Syria, noted that Khamenei's letter also helps raise awareness among the Islamic community‚Äôs youth, which prevent them from being seduced by terrorist groups. Elif Koc of Mashable commented that \\"In a country notorious for its limitations on freedom of speech, Twitter is blocked, but Khamenei's office maintains a Twitter presence. Other Twitter users relayed messages to Khamenei highlighting the limitations of Iran's own policies on free speech using #LETTER4U. One shared a personal anecdote about his father. 'Dear Youth!, My dad spent 5 years in jail for just telling the guy who wrote you a letter he is a dictator #Letter4U.'\\" See also *\\"A Common Word Between Us and You\\", a 2007 letter by Muslim leaders to their Christian counterparts. * To the Youth in Western Countries * Ruhollah Khomeini's letter to Mikhail Gorbachev References External links * Translation to 48 languages of First Letter of Iran's Supreme Leader following Paris attacks, 21 January 2015, TEXT and AUDIO * First Letter of Iran's Supreme Leader, Jan 21, 2015 * Second Letter of Iran's Supreme Leader, Nov 29, 2015 * Related Video of Iran's Supreme Leader's second Letter, Nov 29, 2015 Category:Open letters Category:Ali Khamenei Category:Foreign relations of Iran Category:2015 in Iran Category:2015 documents ","title":"To the Youth in Europe and North America"},{"id":"45246581","title":"Daffodils (song)"},{"id":"45246587","text":"The following lists events that happened during 1893 in Chile.

The caption reads: \\"Copy after Domenico Fetti.\\" Provenance The first record of Fetti's portrait is a 1653 inventory of Cardinal Mazarin's collection at the Palais Mazarin in Paris, where it is described as \\"Harlequin, sur toile, par Fety [Harlequin, on canvas, by Fetti]\\".Aumale 1861, p. 347, cited by Askew (1978, p. 64) and Safarik (1990, p. 284). An inventory drawn up after the Cardinal's death in 1661 lists it as item 1266: \\"Un autre faict par Fety (1), sur toile, repr√©sentant Harlequin, com√©dien, tenant un masque [Another work by Fetti (1), representing Harlequin, actor, holding a mask]\\".Cosnac 1884, p. 342, cited by Askew (1978, p. 64) and Safarik (1990, p. 284). The painting was later in the collection of Pierre Crozat and reproduced as Portrait de Com√©dien, an engraving by Nicolas de Larmessin in the Recueil Crozat (1729), where it is noted that the actor had been in the service of the Duke of Mantua.Portrait de Com√©dien (engraving) at Gallica; for the note, see Recueil d'estampes, vol. 1 (1729), p. 40, at Gallica. It is also mentioned in an inventory made after Crozat's death in 1740Safarik, 1990, p. 286, cites Stuffmann 1968, p. 68, note 92. and was inherited by Crozat's nephew, Louis-Antoine Crozat. It was described in a 1755 inventory as a portrait of a \\"Com√©dien la t√™te d√©couverte, tenant un masque d'Arlequin; par le Feti [Actor, head uncovered, holding a Harlequin mask; by Fetti]\\".La Curne de Sainte-Palaye 1755, p. 29, cited by Safarik 1990, p. 284. After the death of Louis-Antoine Crozat, it was sold by his heir in 1772 to Catherine II of Russia and is mentioned as being in the collection of the Hermitage Museum beginning in 1774.Saffarik 1990, p. 284; Sotheby's. Identification of the sitter Since the late 19th century, the identity of the sitter in Fetti's Portrait of an Actor has been a subject of much interest and disagreement. Among the portraits painted by Fetti during his stay at the Gonzaga court of Mantua (1614‚Äì1622), few have been identified with certainty, but none of the others have engendered as much attention as this one. Pamela Askew explains: \\"The reason undoubtedly lies in its impressive power of characterisation and execution. In many respects [it is] the grandest and most penetrating of Fetti's portraits.\\"Askew 1978, p. 59. =Former attributions= Eduard Safarik, author of a 1990 monograph on Fetti, lists five persons previously proposed by others as the subject of Fetti's painting: the actors Francesco Gabrielli, Giovanni Gabrielli, Giovanni Battista Andreini, and Tristano Martinelli, and the composer Claudio Monteverdi.Safarik 1990, p. 284, cites: Possenti 1964, p. 165, fig. 6 (Francesco Gabrielli); Somof 1899, pp. 53, 54, note 236 (Giovanni Gabrielli); De Logu 1967, pp. 706,‚Äì709, fig. 6 (Monteverdi); Lehmann 1967, p. 205, note 63 (Giovanni Battista Andreini); and Askew 1978, pp. 59‚Äì65, fig. 2 (Martinelli). Of these, apart from Martinelli, only two, Giovanni Gabrielli and Monteverdi gained wide currency. Giovanni Gabrielli Br√ºiningk and Somoff, editors of the 1891 catalogue of the Hermitage Museum's Gallery of Paintings, identified the subject of Fetti's portrait as the Italian commedia dell'arte actor Giovanni Gabrielli, whom they equated with the much younger subject in Annibale Carracci's Portrait of a Lute Player ().Br√ºiningk & Somoff 1891, p. 71, item 236, cited by Mahon 1947, note 50, p. 267. The three-way correlation of Fetti's Actor and Annibale's Lute Player with Agostino Carracci's engraved Giovanni Gabrielli () was traced by Denis Mahon, who questioned it in 1947.Mahon 1947, p. 234, note 3; pp. 266‚Äì267, note 50. The errors were compounded in 1962, when Henner Menz, director of the Dresden Gallery, where Annibale's painting is located, gave it the title Portrait of the Lute-player Giovanni Gabrielle and described it as a \\"picture of a musician\\", leading to a confusion of the actor with the similarly named Venetian composer Giovanni Gabrieli. These misidentifications lingered, despite Posner's outright rejection of them in 1971, when he named the subject of the Lute Player as a member of the Mascheroni family of Bologna, based on Carlo Cesare Malvasia's description of the sitter in his 1678 book Felsina Pittrice.Posner 1971, vol. 2, p. 32; Malvasia 1678, vol. 1, p. 502: \\"del sonatore Mascheroni tanto suo [Annibale's] famigliare, & amico\\". For example, the popular book, Five Centuries of Music In Venice by H. C. Robbins Landon and John Julius Norwich, published in English, Italian, French, and Japanese, as a companion to the five-part television series Maestro, included a full-page color plate of the Lute Player as a portrait of Gabrieli the composer in 1991.Robbins Landon 1991, p. 23, plate 7. In 1978 Askew strongly supported Posner's identification of the sitter as a member of the Mascheroni family,Askew 1978, pp. 59‚Äì60. and more recently the Dresden gallery identified the sitter as Giulio Mascheroni of Bologna..

Martinelli, probably the first actor to use the name Harlequin for the masked secondo zanni role, and the most famous Harlequin up to the time of his death in 1630,Askew 1978, p. 64; Katritzky 2006, pp. 103‚Äì104. In a letter to the Mantuan court in 1595, Martinelli signed himself \\"Tristano Martinelli, called Arlecchino, actor\\" (Richards & Richards 1990, pp. 222‚Äì223) and as late as 1627 refers to \\"nostra arlichinesca persona\\" (Katritzky). commissioned numerous dramatic portraits of himself, three of which he sent to France when he was wanting to return to that country in 1626.Letter of 27 July 1626, signed \\"Tristano Martinelli, dit Arlequin, com√©dien\\", to the French ambassador extraordinary in Venice, translated from Italian into French and quoted by Baschet 1862, p. 301; Askew 1978, p. 64, cites Smith 1930, p. 171. One may have been Fetti's portrait, later acquired by Mazarin. The association of the name Martinelli with the portrait was first documented in 1912, when a copy in pastel, attributed to Fragonard (1732‚Äì1806), was sold in Paris as Portrait de l'auteur et acteur Martinelli.Askew 1978, p. 64. Francesco Andreini The Fetti scholar Eduard Safarik proposed the Italian actor Francesco Andreini as the subject of Fetti's portrait in 1990. Andreini began his career as the innamorato (male lover) and later became famous in the role of Capitano Spavento da Vall'Inferna. He also sometimes played the Sicilian Doctor, the shepherd Corinto, and the necromancer Falsirone.Duchartre p. 232; Savoia 2008, p. 10. Safarik's attribution is based on a comparison of Fetti's portrait (and a drawing, presumably a study for the portrait) to the frontispiece of Andreini's Le Bravure di Capitano Spavento, engraved by Abraham Tummerman and first published in 1609 in Venice.Safarik 1990, pp. 284‚Äì287, cited by Sotheby's. The Hermitage painting was shown with the title Portrait of Fancesco Andreini at a 1996 exhibit (organized by Safarik) at the Palazzo Te in Mantua.Aikema 1997; Safarik 1996, pp. 181‚Äì182.

They compete in the Illawarra Premier League, and are considered one of the most successful teams in the competition having finished Premiers 4 times, the most recently in 2014. The team plays out of Balls Paddock, a small ground located at Woonona, just south of Bulli which was opened in 1988. Bulli FC has had several well known, high-profile players both play, and coach at the club including Socceroos players Adrian Alston, and Dean Heffernan. In addition to their Illawarra Premier League team, Bulli FC also fields junior teams and women's teams in local club competitions in Wollongong. History =Foundation= Bulli football club, was founded at the turn of the 20th century in 1901, however records of some organised football competition go back as far as the mid 1880s. This is believed to be the North Illawarra Rovers who are credited with being the \\"First club on the NSW South Coast ‚Äì North Illawarra, with a ground at Bulli, founded in 1888\\". The foundations of the club were believed to have occurred whilst British traditions of football were still in a development stage. =Early years= Historically, Bulli have always played in strips of blue and white. This however changed in the 1950s when following amalgamation with Bulli Surf Life Saving Club (Bulli SLSC) they changed their kits to green and gold. In 1956 Bulli took out their first Premiership of the Illawarra 1st division. The 1960s were seen as the golden generation for the club, with silverware and success being had right throughout the decade. The 1969 team, coached by Ron Mcgarry (Ex Newcastle Unt UK and South coast Unt) won an impressive 5 trophies that year, including the Premiership & Championship for 1969, NSW Amateur Cup, Langridge Shield and the Corrimal Leagues Knock-out. These successes earned the team the title \\"The invincibles\\". =1970s, 1980s and 1990s= Th 1970s saw a return to a blue and white playing strip. However the 70s was not to be a successful decade for the club on the field. However, it was a success for the field of youth which the club brought through their ranks. The club however struggled in the opening years of the IPL. The 1980s would be a mixed bag of success's and disappointments for the club. They were relegated into the second division in 1982, however re-gained promotion into the Illawarra Premier League after winning the 1983 second division. 2 years later they would achieve their first success in the Illawarra Premier League, when they won the 1985 season. 1986 would see them defend their Premiership, and go on to win further silverware, winner the grand final. 1988 would also see more success for the North Wollongong club, with the opening of their home ground Balls Paddock, by Wollongong Mayor Frank Arkell, MP Brian Tobin, and Illawarra Football Association President George Naylor. Bulli would go on to win their third IPL title in 1988, their last piece of silverware for 26 years. The 1990s for the club saw steady finishing, for little or no reward. Some of the club's most famous, and well-respected players played during this era including Rod Paterson who would go on a 22-year career with the club. =2000s-now= The start of the 21st century started poorly for Bulli, with the club being relegated for only their second time in its history in 2002 since the foundation of the Illawarra Premier League. However, like their previous relegation in 1982, the club bounced back the season following, and would go on to win the Bampton Cup in 2004. In 2006 Bulli made headlines in the Australian footballing community, when they signed former English born Socceroo, Adrian Alston. Alston, who made appearances for Cardiff City FC, and Luton Town FC coached the club for 2-years. The club's next major piece of silverware would come in the 2014 Illawarra Premier League season, where they finished Premiers, ahead of Dapto Dandaloo Fury FC. Dapto Dandaloo would go on to win the grand final, defeating Bulli 2‚Äì0 in the process. It was this season they signed another former Socceroo, and former A-League stalwart Dean Heffernan who signed for the club following a stint with the Western Sydney Wanderers. In 2017, Matt Bailey took over from Ben Smith as first-grade coach. The side enjoyed success in the FFA Cup, reaching the seventh round where they were beaten 3‚Äì0 by NPL heavyweights Blacktown City at Balls Paddock. Bulli won the Bert Bampton Cup for the second time in their history, their final opponents where Albion Park White Eagles and a Marcus Beattie goal saw Bulli win 1‚Äì0. In the final round of the season, Bulli clinched their fifth League Championship with a 1‚Äì0 win over 2nd placed Wollongong Olympic FC. Bulli made it to the Grand Final where they faced Port Kembla who came 5th in the regular season. Though Bulli were strong favourites Port Kembla secured a shock upset, winning via a penalty shootout after it finished 0‚Äì0 after extra time. Grand Final Hoodoo Despite being one of the Premier League's most successful clubs, Bulli would go 32-years between their first grand final win in 1986 and their second in 2018. This period saw the club lose eight grand finals including seven in 12 seasons between 2006 and 2017 including a shock penalty shootout defeat to Port Kembla in 2017 which was one of the biggest upsets in the competition's history. Bulli would break the hoodoo in 2018 with a 3‚Äì2 win over rivals Wollongong United at Win Stadium Current squad Correct as of 29 July 2017 Source: Bulli FC Notable past players and managers * Adrian Alston ‚Äì 43 appearances, 7 goals for Australia * Dean Heffernan ‚Äì 2 appearances, 1 goal for Australia Honours and awards Illawarra Premier League *Premiers (6): 1985, 1986, 1988, 2014, 2017, 2018 *Champions (2): 1986, 2018 Bert Bampton Cup *Champions (2): 2004, 2017 References External links Category:Soccer clubs in New South Wales Category:Soccer clubs in Wollongong Category:Illawarra Premier League Category:Association football clubs established in 1901 Category:1901 establishments in Australia ","title":"Bulli FC"},{"id":"45246696","text":"Suobi Ê¢≠ÊØî is a Southern Loloish language of south-central Yunnan, China.

It is notable for the discovery of a skull that belongs to a modern human, called Manot 1, which is estimated to be 54,700 years old. The partial skull was discovered at the beginning of the cave's exploration in 2008. Its significance was realised after detailed scientific analysis, and was first published in an online edition of Nature on 28 January 2015. This age implies that the specimen is the oldest known human outside Africa, and is evidence that modern humans lived side-by-side with Neanderthals. The cave is also noted for its \\"impressive archaeological record of flint and bone artefacts\\". Geologically, it is an \\"active stalactite cave\\". Discovery Manot Cave: Stalactites and stalagmites form a column Manot Cave is situated in Western Galilee, about 10 km north of HaYonim Cave and 50 km northeast of Mt. Carmel. It was discovered accidentally during a construction work in 2008 when a bulldozer struck open its roof. Experts from the Cave Research Unit of Hebrew University of Jerusalem immediately made the initial survey. Important finds were stone tools, charcoal pieces, and human remains. The tools consisted of a Levallois point, burins, bladelets, overpassed blades, and Aurignacian tools such as nosed and carinated endscrapers. There were also remains of \\"fallow deer, red deer, mountain gazelle, horse, aurochs, hyena, and bear\\". The major find was an almost complete human skull. The finds were reported to the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), which granted another survey. Ofer Marder and H. Khalaily made the survey and found that it was a rich archaeological site. Recognising its importance, the IAA granted a full-scale excavation in 2010. For three weeks the site was excavated by a collaboration of archaeologists from Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Tel Aviv University, Geological Survey of Israel, Zinman Institute of Archaeology of University of Haifa, Kimmel Center for Archaeological Sciences of Weizmann Institute of Science, and the Department of Archaeology of Boston University. Description Map of Manot Cave with the areas of excavation The Manot Cave consists of a lengthy hall, 80 m long and between 10m and 25m wide. Two lower chambers are connected to it from north and south. It is possible that the main entrances were at both the eastern and western ends. The cave has active stalagmite formations. Archaeological remains indicate that the most recent artifacts belong to the Early Palaeolithic period. This further indicates that the cave had been completely sealed for at least 15,000 years. The blockage was probably due to rock falls and active stalagmites at the main entrances. Chronology Archaeologists have offered the following chronology for the cave, based on radiocarbon dating: an Early Ahmarian phase (46,000‚Äì42,000 BP), a Levantine Aurignacian phase (38,000‚Äì34,000 BP), and a post-Levantine Aurignacian phase (34,000‚Äì33,000 BP). Significance in human evolution The most important find in the cave is a partial skullcap of a modern human, referred to by archaeologists as Manot 1. The specimen is estimated (using uranium‚Äìthorium dating) to be 54,700 years old. It shows that modern humans lived together with another human species, the Neanderthals, in the Levant. This could support the notion that these two species had interbred, as evidenced by genome sequencing.

Biography  Lu Zhaolin was born in Fanyang (near present-day Beijing). He studied under Cao Xian (ÊõπÊÜ≤; fl. 605‚Äì649), the master of Wen Xuan studies, and Wang Yifang (ÁéãÁæ©Êñπ; 615‚Äì669), a famous scholar of the Chinese classics. He worked in the archive of Prince Li Yuanyu (died 665), the seventeenth son of the founding Emperor Gaozu of the Tang dynasty. Lu was known for his erudition, and was said to have exhaustively studied the large collection of books in the prince's library. In 666, he was a member of the entourage of Emperor Gaozong on the imperial pilgrimage to Mount Tai. Soon afterwards, Lu was appointed the county defender of Xindu in Shu province (modern Sichuan). He later suffered a debilitating disease, probably rheumatoid arthritis, which eventually crippled him. The disability forced him to resign from his post, and he became a disciple of the renowned doctor and alchemist Sun Simiao, living on Mount Taibai and in the capital Chang'an. He adopted the alternative name (hao) of Youyouzi (ÂπΩÊÜÇÂ≠ê), or \\"Master of Shrouded Sorrow\\". He committed suicide by drowning himself in the Ying River circa 684 or 686, after years of suffering.  Poetry  Like the other three \\"paragons\\" of the early Tang, Lu Zhaolin was capable of composing the highly mannered poetry that was fashionable in the Tang court. However, his work outside the court allowed him significant freedom in his style. Lu was best known for his qil√º, or ballads of seven-character lines, such as \\"Chang'an: Ancient Theme\\", but his most remarkable works are poems expressing his personal suffering, such as \\"Five Sorrows\\" and \\"Resolving Sickness\\", which were written in the style of Li Sao of the Songs of Chu. Lu was the only medieval poet to successfully revive the sao style of the ancient poet Qu Yuan; and just like Qu Yuan, he chose to end his tragic life by drowning himself.

It was constructed between 1899 and 1900 in the Dutch colonial age, during which it was also known as the Banten railway (). History The public railway company Staatsspoorwegen built the line in 1899 and 1900 as part of the Western railways () in order to improve connectivity with the western regions on Java. On 2 January 1899 the first part was opened between Batavia Zuid (Jakarta Kota) and Tangerang. Until 12 September 1923, this line started from Batavia Zuid, headed west across the street via Pasar Pagi (current day Petongkangan street), turned south to Angke after which the railway followed the current route via Duri. Due to the narrow streets downtown, the new railway from 1923 went around the city on partially elevated tracks. The original plan for this included a rail curve starting from Batavia station going east and curving 180¬∞ north- and westwards. Because of the higher costs however, the line was to go east to Kampung Bandan after which trains would have to revert onto the new railway going northwest around the old downtown area. This is the situation as it remains today. The railway stretch from Duri to Rangkasbitung was completed on 1 October 1899, to Serang on 1 July 1900, and the final extension to Anyer Kidul on 20 December 1900.

Before the war Gerard Reeskamp was born in 1899 in Utrecht. He started a successful drugstore in Bussum. In 1933, Reeskamp and his large family moved from their home above the drugstore to a detached house in Naarden. A devout Protestant, his faith was important to him throughout his life. Resistance Before the war (1939) he was practically already part of the resistance, tailing Germany-sympathizers in the area together with his eldest son, Gerard Reeskamp. Reeskamp already distributed pamphlets before the war to warn people of the imminent danger. Immediately after the invasion in May 1940, he organized a resistance group in Het Gooi, nearby Amsterdam. His eldest son Gerard together with the later famous resistance fighter Theo Dobbe were members of this group. The group stole chests of ammunition and trotyl from the fortifications at Naarden, which were later used by Dobbe for bombings in Amsterdam. Several months later, the group was betrayed and arrested, but father and son Reeskamp managed to escape. As he was wanted by the Sicherheitsdienst (SD), Reeskamp was forced to leave his family and drugstore in Naarden behind in 1940, and seek refuge in Sneek, the birthplace of his wife Sjoukje. He came into contact with Sybrand Marinus van Haersma Buma, the mayor of Wymbritseradeel. Through his contacts, Reeskamp was able to foment resistance in the province of Friesland. In the area of Sneek (Scharnegoutum) he founded one of the first Frisian 'knokploegen' (fighting squads). He was asked to help during large operations elsewhere in the province, most notably during the assault on the Leeuwarden prison. Because of his resistance activities, the Germans wrote him down for several death sentences. A bounty of 10.000 guilders was put on his head, whether dead or alive. In 1944, Reeskamp was appointed District Operation Leader of the sabotage teams in southwestern Friesland. In his resistance, Gerard Reeskamp was supported by his wife Sjoukje Reeskamp-Wielinga. In 1943, she was held in captivity together with her children for several months and was interrogated, but she did not give away her husband's whereabouts. In 1943, Sjoukje took two Jewish children into her home. For this, she received the Yad Vashem award in 1988, requested by her Hidden Children. Overview of resistance activities =Propaganda activities= ‚Ä¢ from his drugstore, flyers were distributed which warned the people of the dangers of the German occupation (1939) and which were intended to increase the moral resilience of his compatriots ‚Ä¢ he raised money to print propaganda reading material such as Vrij Nederland and De Oranjekrant. These were subsequently brought to the existing resistance groups by him personally (1941). These activities were an important reason for the SD to hunt him down =Paramilitary activities= ‚Ä¢ he stole chests of ammunition and trotyl from the guarded arms deposits in the fortified garrison at Naarden (June 1940) ‚Ä¢ he made incendiary bombs out of phosphorus and gunpowder, with which the ammunition deposits in Soesterberg were destroyed (1940) ‚Ä¢ shortly before he was transported to Kamp Amersfoort, he managed to escape from the guarded Binnengasthuis in Amsterdam (December 1942) ‚Ä¢ he took charge of the cover squad during the successful raid on the Leeuwarden Penitentiary Facility; 52 resistance members were freed during the raid (8 December 1944) ‚Ä¢ he took charge during two raids on the Sneek police station, during which 20 resistance members were freed ‚Ä¢ as a commander, he organized reception and transport of airdrops with weapons in southwest Friesland (1944-1945) ‚Ä¢ he bombed an train transporting ammunition in Bozum (December 1944) ‚Ä¢ he disarmed the German soldiers at gunpoint, on the day Sneek was liberated (15 April 1945) =Helped construct resistance in Friesland= ‚Ä¢ helped construct reading groups in the whole of Friesland, which often developed into resistance groups later on. =Activities regarding refugees and other victims= ‚Ä¢ he raided distribution offices in Wommels (23 Oct. 1942), Bolsward, Rauwerd and Mantgum for ration coupons and identification cards ‚Ä¢ in Bolsward, he destroyed the address list containing potential candidates for forced labour in Germany ‚Ä¢ he raided the population register in Rauwerd for blank identity cards ‚Ä¢ he raided ten cheese factories in Friesland ‚Ä¢ he shipped food supplies to Amsterdam. Agent Akkerman testified to no less than 200 food aid packages, which had arrived during the Dutch famine of 1944 ‚Ä¢ he robbed dozens of livestock traders who did not want to donate money to the resistance and the refugees After the liberation Immediately after the war, Reeskamp was lauded for his courage and boundless effort. He received a recommendation by general Dwight D. Eisenhower on behalf of the Allied Expeditionary Force, for the courage he had displayed. But the last robbery of a livestock trader on 16 January 1945 proved fatal. Reeskamp, who had joined the resistance organization Binnenlandse Strijdkrachten ('Internal Forces') by the end of 1944, robbed livestock traders at the request of Haitze Wiersma, commander of the Frisian branch of the National Organization for Aiding Refugees, in order to finance the resistance, which was constantly plagued by money troubles. Money was direly needed to feed the refugees. During his assignment, two members of his group made a failed robbery-attempt on a rich livestock trader. When he resisted, one of the group members panicked and shot the trader in the head with the pistol he had lent from Reeskamp. The livestock trader was left behind in the snow, and died of pneumonia a few weeks later. Detective Aukema found one of the bullets and held on to it for one and a half years. As Ad van Liempt indicates in his book 'De Drogist', Aukema jr. was a police officer who collaborated with the Germans during the war. According to Van Liempt, this was no coincidence since his father was one of the most notorious Jew-hunters in Amsterdam. For one and a half years Aukema jr. was suspended, awaiting his reprimand. After his suspension was over in 1947, he fanatically committed himself to prosecuting his old wartime enemy Gerard Reeskamp. The bullet he had kept for so long turned out to be crucial for his purposes. Trial Reeskamp was tried as a soldier for his part in the death of the rich livestock trader, since he had joined the Binnenlandse Strijdkrachten by the end of 1944, which was later incorporated into the military regime. It would cost him dearly. The passionate hearing officer C.H. Beekhuis, active during the war as a lawyer in Leeuwarden, after an initial sentence of 2 years imprisonment, appealed and demanded 6 years imprisonment. 'De Drogist' states that according to Beekhuis, who was completely unaware of any resistance work, the resistance was to have an unblemished record in history. The Supreme Military Court sentenced Reeskamp to 4 years in prison. It was not taken into account that the purpose of that fatal robbery in the war was aiding the refugees. It was not the only remarkable legal aspect of this case. Only after 7 months of imprisonment a lawyer was assigned to Reeskamp. During the trials, his lawyer made little effort in his defense. Witnesses for his defense were not summoned. In culture Ad van Liempt wrote in his book 'De Drogist' that he did not intend to rehabilitate Reeskamp, but that he did attempt to unearth the truth and that he attempted to ascertain to the best of his abilities what Reeskamp had done in the war and what had happened to him afterwards. Many readers have stated on the biographical website that they cannot help seeing the book as a reparation for a courageous and successful resistance fighter. A play about his life was created and staged in 2020. A remarkable resistance fighter Various aspects give Reeskamp a special place in the Dutch resistance history. First of all, his anti-NSB activities before the war (1939) are a testament to his foresight, while his resistance activities during May 1940 are proof of his strong vigor. He was one of the first resistance fighters in the Netherlands, Loe de Jong writes in his multivolume work on World War II. In a letter, De Jong calls Reeskamp one of the first and more important resistance fighters of the Netherlands. A second remarkable aspect of Reeskamp his nature is that he performed his resistance activities as humanely as possible, always attempting to minimize civilian casualties, as the book 'De Drogist' also indicates. The multiple propaganda actions he made to strengthen the moral resilience of his compatriots also stand out. As for the post-war chapter of his story, the first question which comes to mind is why it was possible for the Leeuwarden legal system and police to dispose themselves so easily of an outlaw who had evaded the Germans successfully for years. He is the only resistance fighter who was sentenced and imprisoned after the war for an act of resistance other than assassination. The many hundreds of assassinations carried out by the resistance, even those committed after the war was over, have never led to prosecution.

His song \\"This Is My Dream\\" has been described as an anthem for overcoming adversity. Life and career =Early life and career beginnings= Keegan was born Matthew Kashy Keegan in 1983 in Worthing, West Sussex, England. He started piano lessons at the age of seven, going on to write his first song at the age of 10. Keegan cites early classic pop music such as that by George Michael and Elton John as being some of his earliest musical influences. He said his favourite album is Tracy Chapman by Tracy Chapman because of its socially conscious lyrics. Prior to signing his first record deal in 2014, Keegan released two albums independently Kashy Keegan and Looking In. =2012‚Äì15: This Is My Dream= Keegan wrote \\"This Is My Dream\\" in 2007. The song was first used as a 2012 London Olympics motivational song and was later discovered by a music supervisor who works for Hong Kong Television (HKTV) after Keegan had uploaded the song to the website ReverbNation. Following this he was contacted by Universal Music who signed a one-song contract with him. HKTV chose the song as the theme music for a documentary series called The Challenge (Chinese: ÊåëÊà∞). But this was before the network had been granted a broadcast license. In October 2013 the news was announced that HKTV's application for a broadcast licence had been rejected. This triggered a series of public protests attended by tens of thousands of people for which Keegan's song became the unofficial soundtrack. Keegan flew to Hong Kong in support of HKTV and on 25 October 2013 an estimated audience of 30,000 watched him perform his song \\"This is My Dream\\". The following year Keegan flew to Beijing and competed in the MTV Asia Aloft Star competition where \\"This Is My Dream\\" came second overall. In early 2014 he relocated from London to Hong Kong to pursue his music career full-time. He eventually signed to Hong Kong- based record label Evosound in May 2014 and released an album This Is My Dream on 1 December 2014. =2016: Inner Song= 18 March 2016 saw the release of Keegan's fourth studio album Inner Song.

They are commonly known as vetch aphids for this reason. Taxonomy Megoura viciae was described by English entomologist George Bowdler Buckton in 1876. It is the type species of the genus Megoura. Morphology Megoura viciae has a large globular green abdomen with a smaller black prothorax, black cauda, black legs, black antennae and a black head. Towards the rear of the body are large crescent- shaped black sclerites which are in front of the siphunculi. The eyes are red in colour. Dependent on the stage in their lifecycle M. viciae may be winged or wingless. Distribution and habitat Megoura viciae is widely present in Europe, from latitudes 64‚Äì65¬∞ N across Scandinavia, into Denmark and the rest of Europe (including England) and south to the Mediterranean. It also occurs in Ethiopia and has been recorded from North America. Host plants Megoura viciae feeds on leguminous plants, primarily vetch, peas and broad beans of the genus Vicia from which M. viciae gets its common name of vetch aphids. Feeding on the host plant causes a leaf gall to form. Life cycle Megoura viciae does not move between primary and secondary plants, spending its life cycle on a leguminous host plant. Eggs are laid at the base of the host plant and these hatch in the spring. Winged forms are produced after three generations and these winged aphids then move on to other plants. In the autumn the aphids move on to the seed pods of the host plant. Like most aphids, M. viciae is viviparous.

It is a paternal mouthbrooder which has been introduced to Asia and North America. In the Philippines, it is also informally called gloria or tilapiang arroyo after former Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo because of its small size and mole-like dark pigmentation under its lower jaw, resembling that of the short stature and mole on the former president's left cheek. Description The blackchin tilapia, is pale in colour, that colour varying in shades including light blue, orange and golden yellow which normally has dark patches on the chin of adults. It also normally has dark colouration on the posterior edge of the gill and on the tips of the soft rays of the dorsal fin. The body is typically marked with irregular bars, spots or splotches. It has a small mouth which is equipped with as many as a few hundred tiny teeth which are arranged in 3-6 rows. They display minimal sexual dimorphism with the heads of adult males usually being slightly larger than the heads of females, some males may also show gold tinting on the operculum. The dorsal fin has 15 - 17 spines and 10-12 soft rays, the anal fin has 3 spines and 8-10 soft rays and the length of caudal peduncle is equal to 0.6-0.9 times its depth. It can grow to a maximum length of but more normally attains . Distribution The blackchin tilapia is native to western Africa from Mauritania to Cameroon. It has been introduced to several countries in Asia, USA and Europe. It has also become an invasive species in Florida, Thailand, and the Philippines. Habitat and biology The blackchin tilapia is able to tolerate high salinities and it can be found abundantly in mangrove areas and is able to move into freshwaters, such as the lower reaches of streams, and in to salt waters. In West Africa, it is restricted to brackish lagoons and estuaries, and is abundant in the mangroves. It forms schools and it is largely nocturnal, although it will feed during the day infrequently. The diet is largely aufwuchs and detritus supplemented with bivalves and zooplankton It feeds by picking up and swallowing in bites, it lacks gill rakers. Spawning occurs close to the shore in shallow water. The female actively courts the male, digs pits and leads in mating. The male eventually reacts in a largely passive manner and the pair will establish a bond. It is paternal mouth brooder, but females of one of the strains in Ghana also exhibit the potential for oral‚Äêbrooding. Invasive species In Florida, this species appears to have been introduced via escapes from the aquarium trade, although some deliberate releases are suspected. In some areas Blackchin tilapia can make up to 90% of the fish biomass. They can then spread disease to and out compete native fish. In Hawaii it is sometimes called the \\"saltwater tilapia\\" because it has the ability to survive and possibly even breed in pure seawater. In these islands it is found off sheltered beaches and in lagoons around O\`ahu and possibly the other islands. This species is regarded as a pest in canals and reservoirs in Hawaii, they breed rapidly, out-compete any other species present, and then they frequently have massive die-offs. For example, in 1991 at Lake Wilson on O\`ahu, there was a fungal infection which killed off an estimated 20,000 tilapia, the majority of which were blackchin tilapia. This was thought to represent at most 0.5% of the total population of tilapia in the reservoir. In the Philippines, there is no record on how the blackchin tilapia was introduced into the country's waters, but it is believed that around as early as 2015, it may have come from the aquarium trade and released into the wild in the waters near provinces of Bataan and Bulacan. The species is considered a threat towards fish ponds as they multiply very quickly, taking up space for other fish, particularly those for breeding bangus (milkfish). Given the nearby proximity to Bataan and Bulacan, blackchin tilapia is also present in Manila Bay, despite not being a freshwater body as it was among the fish that had washed ashore along the Baseco shoreline on September 17, 2020. Taxonomy The black chin tiapia was formerly considered to be subdivided into three subspecies but some authorities now consider it to be a monotypic species: The three subspecies were * S.m. heudelotii (Dum√©ril, 1861) * S.m. leonensis (Thys van den Audenaerde, 1971) Liberia and Sierra Leone * S.m. melanotheron R√ºppell, 1852 C√¥te d'Ivoire to southern Cameroon.

It had a shorter, broader palate with large carnassial teeth relative to its overall skull size. This adaptation allowed it to prey and scavenge on Pleistocene megafauna. Such an adaptation is an example of phenotypic plasticity. It was once distributed across the northern Holarctic. Name In 2007, the words \\"megafaunal\\" and \\"wolf\\" appeared separated in the title of a study. In 2013, one of the study co-authors first used the term \\"megafaunal wolf\\" in a media release. Taxonomy The megafaunal wolf (Canis cf. lupus, where cf. in Latin means confer, uncertain) has not yet been taxonomically classified but based on genetic analysis is believed to be an ecomorph of Canis lupus. The ancient wolf specimens from Europe have been classified as Canis lupus spelaeus Goldfuss, 1823 - the cave wolf. Differences =Populations= Ecological factors including habitat type, climate, prey specialization, and predatory competition will greatly influence gray wolf genetic population structure and cranio-dental plasticity. Therefore, within the Pleistocene gray wolf population, the variations between local environments would have encouraged a range of wolf ecotypes that were genetically, morphologically, and ecologically distinct from one another. =Types= In 2010, a study compared a 230 base pair sequence of the mitochondrial control region from 24 ancient wolf specimens from western Europe dated between 44,000‚Äì1,200 ybp with those of modern gray wolves. The sequences could be represented on a phylogenetic tree, which formed two haplogroups that were separated from each other by 5 mutations. Haplogroup 1 was monophyletic (indicating they share a common ancestor). Haplogroup 2 was basal to haplogroup 1, which indicated a more ancient lineage, and it was not monophyletic. The ancient wolf samples from western Europe all belonged to haplogroup 2, indicating haplogroup 2 predominance in this region for over 40,000 years before and after the Last Glacial Maximum. Physical description =Skull and dentition= Diagram of a wolf skull with key features labelled Megafaunal wolves were similar in physical size to other Pleistocene-era wolves and large extant gray wolves, but with stronger jaws and teeth. They tended to have short, broad palates with large carnassials relative to their overall skull size. These features suggest a wolf adapted for producing relatively large bite forces. The short, broad rostrum increased the mechanical advantage of a bite made with the canine teeth and strengthened the skull against torsional stresses caused by struggling prey. Relatively deep jaws are characteristic of habitual bone crackers, such as spotted hyenas, as well as canids that take prey as large as or larger than themselves. Overall, these features indicate that megafaunal wolves were more specialized than modern gray wolves in killing and consuming relatively large prey, and scavenging. In comparison to other gray wolves, megafaunal wolf samples include many more individuals with moderately to heavily worn teeth, and significantly greater numbers of broken teeth. The distribution of fractures across the tooth row differs as well, with these wolves having much higher fracture frequencies of incisors, carnassials, and molars. A similar pattern was observed in spotted hyenas, suggesting that increased incisor and carnassial fracture reflects habitual bone consumption, because bones are gnawed with incisors and subsequently cracked with the cheek teeth. In 2014, a study of the morphology of wolf (Canis lupus) remains from Europe dating from the Middle-Late Pleistocene and Holocene indicated that the size of the lower carnassial teeth did not fluctuate directly with changes in climate but possibly with the spread of cold megafauna, and therefore in the dietary regime. The lower carnassial length can be used to estimate carnivore body size. In 2015, a study looked at specimens of all of the carnivore species from Rancho La Brea, California, including remains of the large wolf Canis dirus that was also a megafaunal hypercarnivore. The evidence suggests that these carnivores were not food-stressed just before extinction, and that carcass utilization was less than among large carnivores today. The high incidence of tooth breakage likely resulted from the acquisition and consumption of larger prey.DeSantis, L.R.G. ¬ß, Schubert, B.W., *Schmitt- Linville, E., Ungar, P., *Donohue, S., *Haupt, R.J. In press. Dental microwear textures of carnivorans from the La Brea Tar Pits, California and potential extinction implications . Contributions in Science (a special volume entitled La Brea and Beyond: the Paleontology of Asphalt-Preserved Biotas, in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County's excavations at Rancho La Brea) Diet Location of a dog's carnassials; the inside of the 4th upper premolar aligns with the outside of the 1st lower molar, working like scissor blades Isotopic bone collagen analysis of the specimens indicated that they ate horse, bison, woodland muskox, and mammoth ‚Äî i.e., Pleistocene megafauna. This supports the conclusion that they were capable of killing and dismembering large prey. Compared with Pleistocene and extant gray wolves, the megafaunal wolf was hypercarnivorous, with a craniodental morphology more capable of capturing, dismembering, and consuming the bones of very large mega-herbivores. When their prey disappeared, this wolf did as well, resulting in a significant loss of phenotypic and genetic diversity within the species. Habitat Based on the morphological and genetic evidence, the megafaunal wolf's distribution was across the northern Holarctic. =Paleoecology= Ukok Plateau, one of the last remnants of the mammoth steppe The last glacial period, commonly referred to as the \\"Ice Age\\", spanned 125,000 to 14,500 years ago and was the most recent glacial period within the current ice age which occurred during the last years of the Pleistocene era. The Ice Age reached its peak during the last glacial maximum, when ice sheets commenced advancing from 33,000 years BP and reached their maximum positions 26,500 years BP. Deglaciation commenced in the Northern Hemisphere approximately 19,000 years BP, and in Antarctica approximately 14,500 years BP, which is consistent with evidence that this was the primary source for an abrupt rise in the sea level 14,500 years ago. A vast mammoth steppe stretched from Spain across Eurasia and over the Bering land bridge into Alaska and the Yukon, where it was stopped by the Wisconsin glaciation. This land bridge existed because more of the planet's water was locked up in glaciation than now, and therefore the sea levels were lower. When the sea levels began to rise, this bridge was inundated around 11,000 years BP. During the last glacial maximum, the continent of Europe was much colder and drier than it is today, with polar desert in the north and the remainder steppe or tundra. Forest and woodland was almost non-existent, except for isolated pockets in the mountain ranges of southern Europe. The fossil evidence from many continents points to the extinction mainly of large animals at or near the end of the last glaciation. These animals have been termed Pleistocene megafauna. The most common definition of megafauna is an animal with an adult body weight of over 44 kg. Across Eurasia, the straight- tusked elephant became extinct between 100,000‚Äì50,000 years BP. The hippopotamus, interglacial rhinoceros (Stephanorhinus), cave bear (Ursus spelaeus), and heavy-bodied Asian antelope (Spirocerus) died out between 50,000-16,000 years BP. The spotted hyena, woolly rhinoceros, and mammoths died out between 16,000-11,500 years BP. The musk ox died out after 11,500 BP, as did the giant deer (Megaloceros), with the last pocket having survived until about 7,700 years BP in western Siberia. A pocket of mammoths survived on Wrangel Island until 4,500 years BP. As some species became extinct, so too did their predators. Among the top predators, the sabre-toothed cat (Homotherium) died out 28,000 years BP, the Eurasian cave lion 11,900 years BP, and the leopard in Europe died out 27,000 years BP. The Late Pleistocene was characterized by a series of severe and rapid climate oscillations with regional temperature changes of up to 16¬∞ C, which has been correlated with megafaunal extinctions. There is no evidence of megafaunal extinctions at the height of the LGM, indicating that increasing cold and glaciation were not factors. Multiple events appear to also involve the rapid replacement of one species by one within the same genus, or one population by another within the same species, across a broad area. Modern humans' ancestors first appeared in East Africa 195,000 years ago. Some migrated out of Africa 60,000 years ago, with one group reaching Central Asia 50,000 years ago. From there they reached Europe, with human remains dated 43,000-45,000 years BP discovered in Italy, Britain, and in the European Russian Arctic 40,000 years ago. Remains of mammoth that had been hunted by humans 45,000 YBP have been found at Yenisei Bay in the central Siberian Arctic. Another group left Central Asia and reached the Yana River, Siberia, well above the Arctic circle 27,000 years ago. Modern humans then made their way across the Bering land bridge and into North America between 20,000-11,000 years ago, after the Wisconsin glaciation had retreated but before the Bering land bridge became inundated by the sea. These people then populated the Americas. In the Fertile crescent the first agriculture was developing 11,500 years ago. In this environment, the non- megafauna-specialist haplogroup 1 wolf became more numerous than the haplogroup 2 megafaunal wolf in the Old World and in the New World was unchallenged by the latter due to its prior extinction there. =Beringia= Shrinking of the Bering land bridge Beringia is a loosely defined region surrounding the Bering Strait, the Chukchi Sea, and the Bering Sea. It includes parts of Chukotka and Kamchatka in Russia, as well as Alaska in the United States. In historical contexts it also includes the Bering land bridge, an ancient land bridge roughly wide (north to south) at its greatest extent, which connected Asia with North America at various times ‚Äî all lying atop the existing North American plate, and east of the Siberian Chersky Range ‚Äî during the Pleistocene ice ages. During ice ages, more water was stored as ice, the sea levels fell, and a land bridge was exposed. East Beringia Dentition of an Ice Age wolf showing functions of the teeth. In 2007, a study was undertaken on the skeletal material from 56 Pleistocene-period East Beringian wolves from permafrost deposits in Alaska. Uncalibrated radio carbon dating showed a continuous population from 45,500 years BP to 12,500 years BP, and one single wolf dated at 7,600 BP. This indicates that their population was in decline after 12,500 BP. Megafauna was still available in this region until 10,500 BP, with the age of the more recent wolf specimen supported by the discovery of a remaining pocket of residual megafauna that still inhabited interior Alaska between 7,500‚Äì10,500 BP. The East Beringian wolf was identified as an ecomorph of the gray wolf (Canis lupus) with a skull morphology that was adapted for hunting and scavenging megafauna. None of the 16 mtDNA haplotypes recovered from a sample of 20 of the wolves was shared with any modern gray wolf, but similar haplotypes were found in Late Pleistocene Eurasian gray wolves. Six eastern-Beringian wolves had the same sequence found in two wolves from Ukraine dated 30,000 years BP and 28,000 years BP, and from Altai dated 33,000 years BP. Two eastern-Beringian wolves matched another haplotype with a wolf from the Czech Republic dated at 44,000 years BP. Its phylogeny indicates that, aside from the older-lineage Himalayan wolf and the Indian gray wolf, the Beringian wolf's unique haplotypes are basal to other gray wolves. Its genetic diversity was higher than that of its modern counterparts, implying that the wolf population of the Late Pleistocene was larger than the present population. Modern North American wolves are not their descendants, and this supports the existence of a separate origin for ancient and extant North American wolves. A more detailed analysis of the genetic material from three specimens were dated at 28,000 years BP, 21,000 years BP, and 20,800 years BP, respectively (with the samples deposited in GenBank with accession numbers KF661088, KF661089 and KF661090) and identified as Canis lupus. West Beringia In 2009, a study was made on a skull fragment and right mandible of a wolf (Canis lupus) found near Lake Taimyr in the Taimyr Peninsula, Arctic Siberia, Russian Federation (the Lake Taimyr wolf). It is one of the northernmost records of Pleistocene carnivora in Eurasia. The skull was aged by radio carbon dating to 16,220 BP. The adult skull was small and assumed to be a female, as it did not differ in size to an extant female wolf skull from northern Siberia. Another study of the Lake Taimyr wolf found that its comparatively small size and characters of the cheekteeth and skull raised the possibility that it might have been a domesticated or semi-domesticated animal. The increased skull width in comparison to extant wolves indicated pronounced development of the temporalis muscles. The specimens were compared to wolf (Canis lupus spelaeus) fossils found near Burnberg, Germany, and near the Paleolithic site of Kostenki 1 on the Don River near Voronezh, Russia. Both of the European fossil skulls demonstrated the same dentition as the fossil wolf from Taimyr. The skull and teeth arrangement suggest a considerable portion of carrion and bones in the diet. In the severe environmental conditions of the Late Pleistocene arctic zone of Eurasia, carrion had been one of the principal food sources for these animals. \\"Notably, the Pleistocene C. lupus from eastern Beringia, by the skull shape, tooth wear and isotopic data, is also reconstructed as a specialized hunter and scavenger of extinct North American megafauna.\\" In 2019, the severed head of the world's first full-sized Pleistocene wolf was unearthed in the Abyisky district in the north of Yakutia. The wolf, whose rich mammoth-like fur and impressive fangs are still intact, was fully grown and aged from two to four years old when it died. ‚ÄòThis is a unique discovery of the first ever remains of a fully grown Pleistocene wolf with its tissue preserved. We will be comparing it to modern-day wolves to understand how the species has evolved and to reconstruct its appearance,‚Äô said an excited Albert Protopopov, from the Republic of Sakha Academy of Sciences.Still snarling after 40,000 years, a giant Pleistocene wolf discovered in Yakutia (Note: until tooth measurements are published, there is no evidence that this wolf was megafaunally adapted) =Europe= Canis lupus spelaeus The European cave wolf (Canis lupus spelaeus) was first described by Georg August Goldfuss in 1823 based on a wolf pup skull found in the Zoolithen Cave located at Gailenreuth, Bavaria, Germany. The wolf possibly belongs to a specialized Late Pleistocene wolf ecomorph. Its bone proportions are close to the Canadian Arctic-boreal mountain-adapted timber wolf and a little larger than those of the modern European wolf. It appears that in the early to middle Late Pleistocene this large wolf existed all over Europe, but was then replaced during the Last Glacial Maximum by a smaller wolf-type which then disappeared along with the reindeer fauna, finally replaced by the Holocene warm-period European wolf Canis lupus lupus. These wolves have not been well-studied, nor have they been well-defined by DNA. Canis lupus maximus Canis lupus maximus (Boudadi-Maligne, 2012) was a subspecies larger than all other known fossil and extant wolves from Western Europe. The fossilized remains of this Late Pleistocene subspecies were found across a wide area of south-western France at: Jaurens cave, Nespouls, Corr√®ze dated 31,000 YBP; Maldidier cave, La Roque-Gageac, Dordogne dated 22,500 YBP; and Gral pit-fall, Sauliac-sur- C√©l√©, Lot dated 16,000 YBP. The wolf's long bones are ten percent longer than those of extant European wolves and 20 percent longer than its probable ancestor, C.l. lunellensis. The teeth are robust, the posterior denticules on the lower premolars p2, p3, p4 and upper P2 and P3 are highly developed, and the diameter of the lower carnassial (m1) were larger than any known European wolf. Wolf body size in Europe has followed a steady increase from their first appearance up to the peak of the Last Glacial Maximum. The size of these wolves are thought to be an adaptation to a cold environment (Bergmann's rule) and plentiful game as their remains have been found in association with reindeer fossils. Italian wolves A 2014 study found wolves in Late Pleistocene Italy were comparable in tooth morphology - and therefore in size - with C. l. maximus from France. These wolves were found near Avetrana, Taranto and near Buco del Frate, Brescia and Pocala cave in Friuli-Venezia Giulia. Relationship with the domestic dog Watercolor tracing made by archaeologist Henri Breuil from a cave painting of a wolf-like canid, Font-de- Gaume, France dated 19,000 years ago. In 2013, a leading evolutionary biologist stated: In 2015, a study looked at the mitogenome control region sequences of 13 ancient canid remains and one modern wolf from five sites across Arctic north-east Siberia. The 14 canids revealed nine haplotypes, three of which were on record and the others unique. Four of the Siberian canids dated 28,000 years before present (YBP), and one Canis variabilis dated 360,000 YBP. The phylogenetic relationship of the extracted sequences showed that the haplotype from specimen S805 (28,000 YBP) was one step away from another haplotype S902 (8,000 YBP) that represents the domestic dog and modern wolf lineages. Several ancient haplotypes were oriented around S805, including Canis c.f. variabilis (360,000 YBP), Belgium (36,000 YBP ‚Äì the \\"Goyet dog\\") and Belgium (30,000 YBP), and Kostyonki, Voronezh Oblast, Russia (22,000 YBP). Given the position of the S805 haplotype, it may potentially represent a direct link from the putative progenitor (including Canis c.f. variabilis) to the domestic dog and modern wolf lineages.

The film follows the lives of several 18- and 19-year-old pornographic actresses. The film premiered at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival and was released on Netflix on May 29, 2015.  Synopsis  Several 18- to 25-year-old young women are interviewed about their experiences as pornography performers. Several women, including Rachel Bernard, Tressa Silguero and Karly Stouffer are recruited by a 23-year-old pro-amateur porn agent Riley Reynolds to live in his North Miami Beach home. Silguero, 19, leaves the business.  Production  The film was originally imagined as an exploration of male consumption of pornography on college campuses. The filmmakers abandoned this idea when they discovered that the men were mostly watching pornographic videos starring young women. Curious about why such a large number of young women were entering the industry, the film was reoriented to tell their story. Further edits took place after the Sundance premiere to address issues the filmmakers identified during screenings. Following discussions with the public on Twitter, some of the film's statements were also clarified.  Release  Hot Girls Wanted premiered at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival. Netflix picked the film up for distribution and released it on May 29, 2015.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that nine of eleven surveyed critics gave the film an 82% positive review; the average rating is 6.5/10. Geoff Berkshire of Variety wrote, \\"An intimate and ultimately harrowing peek inside the world of amateur porn, Hot Girls Wanted will shock and outrage audiences in equal measure.\\" Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter called it a \\"rigorous, timely study\\". Jordan Hoffman of The Guardian rated it 2/5 stars and wrote, \\"If you were in the dark about the potential dangers for young women of employment in the porn industry, this documentary may prove instructive. For everyone else, it's an unnecessary ‚Äì if salutary ‚Äì reminder.\\" Mike Hale of The New York Times described it as \\"a documentary with a provocative subject and title but an uncertain tone that vacillates between weary outrage and motherly concern\\". Reynolds and two of his performers said that the film focuses too much on the worst-case scenarios. Regardless, Reynolds said the film has inspired young women to enter pornography.  TV series: Turned On  Hot Girls Wanted: Turned On, a six-part Netflix documentary series exploring the intersection of sexuality and technology, was released in April 2017.

He was also an excellent playwright who established the Rampur theatre in the building of club ghar at Rampur. Early life and background Wazir Khan was born in the erstwhile Rampur State to Ameer Khan Beenkar. Wazir Khan, was the descendant of Naubat Khan and Hussaini (Tansen's daughter).He was an individual whose interests span many fields or areas.Besides being an excellent musician he was a professional playwright.In poetry Wazir Khan was the student of Daagh Dehelvi.He also authored a novel in his lifetime. He was passionate about photography and was also an immaculate Calligrapher.Primarily he used to do Calligraphy in Arabic.Painting was one of his avocation.As a Musicologist he wrote the Risala Mausibi.Wazir Khan was proficient in many languages such as Arabic,Persian,Urdu,Hindi,Bangla,Marathi and Gujarati.Wazir Khan and his prominent disciples a research by Rati Rastogi,RohilKhand University Cuisine Naubat Khan's family was very fond of food. They were able to develop their own cuisine.Rice preparations were included in their meals and kebab featured regularly. Rakabdars from the court of Awadh were employed in their kitchens. It was said that if anyone from this family is not fond of dessert than he is not a Naubat Khani. These preparations were so rich in ingredients that once Nawab Hamid Ali Khan said that if this family was not fond of such good food they could have houses made of gold and silver. Disciples Nayak Wazir Khan was the master of Nawab Hamid Ali Khan of Rampur,Rampur ki Sadarang Parampara by Saryu Kalekar,1984 New Delhi Publications Allauddin Khan, Hafiz Ali Khan, Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande. Alauddin Khan went on to establish the modern Maihar gharana with disciples like Ali Akbar Khan (son), Annapurna Devi (daughter), Pandit Ravi Shankar (son-in-law), Nikhil Banerjee, Vasant Rai, Pannalal Ghosh, Bahadur Khan, and Sharan Rani. Wazir Khan (centre) with other musicians Struggle of Alauddin Khan Wazir Khan lived like a prince. It was not easy for a commoner to approach the musician directly. Alauddin was quite desperate to become his disciple. It is said that one day he stood in front of the Nawab's vehicle and begged to become Wazir Khan' disciple. The Nawab of Rampur was pleased with his perseverance. The Nawab sent the vehicle to fetch Wazir Khan and Alauddin was made the disciple of Wazir Khan. Wazir Khan taught him nothing for two years, but when he came to know about the hardships Alauddin's wife was facing at home, he started teaching Alauddin. 1907 Ford owned by Ustad Wazir Khan, the earliest Ford car in Calcutta Imtiyaz Ali Khan, nephew of Wazir Khan Family tree * 15px I.

The ship was armed with a main battery of nine guns, and six twin torpedo tubes were added in 1917. She was built by the Cantiere Navale Triestino shipyard from 1911 to 1914, entering service days after the outbreak of World War I. She spent the war as a flotilla leader, conducting raids and patrols in the narrow waters of the Adriatic Sea. In May 1917, Saida took part in the Battle of the Strait of Otranto, the largest naval action in the course of the war in the Adriatic. Saida was tasked with provoking a final fleet confrontation in June 1918, but the attack was called off after the dreadnought battleship was sunk by an Italian motor torpedo boat. Saida was ceded to Italy after the war and commissioned as Venezia. She served in the Regia Marina (Royal Navy) from 1921 to 1937, ending her career as a barracks ship after 1930. The ship was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1937. The three Novara class cruisers were the largest vessels of the former Austro- Hungarian Navy to see service in foreign navies after the war. Design Saida was long overall, with a beam of and a mean draft of . She displaced at normal load, and up to at deep load. Her propulsion system consisted of two sets of Melms-Pfenniger steam turbines driving two propeller shafts. They were designed to provide and were powered by 16 Yarrow water-tube boilers. These gave the ship a top speed of . Saida carried about of coal that gave her a range of approximately at . The ship had a crew of 340 officers and men.Fraccoli, p. 317Gardiner & Gray, p. 336 Saida was armed with nine 50-caliber guns in single pedestal mounts. Three were placed forward on the forecastle, four were located amidships, two on either side, and two were side by side on the quarterdeck. A ≈†koda /50 K10 anti-aircraft gun and six torpedo tubes in twin mounts were added in 1917. The navy planned to remove the guns on the forecastle and quarterdeck and replace them with a pair of guns fore and aft, but nothing was done before the end of the war. The ship was protected by a waterline armored belt that was thick amidships. The conning tower had 60 mm thick sides, and the deck was thick. Service history Saida was laid down at the Cantiere Navale Triestino shipyard in Monfalcone on 9 September 1911. Her completed hull was launched on 26 October 1912, and construction, including fitting-out, was completed by 1 August 1914, four days after Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Following the outbreak of World War I, Saida was assigned as the flotilla leader for the First Torpedo Flotilla, which included the six s, six s, ten torpedo boats, and a depot ship.Sondhaus, p. 257 Following the Italian declaration of war against Austria-Hungary in May 1915, most of the Austro-Hungarian fleet sortied in a surprise attack on various points on the Italian coast. During the operation, Saida, her sister , the cruisers and , and nine destroyers provided a screen against a possible Italian counterattack, which did not materialize.Sondhaus, pp. 274-275 The ship's first combat came on 17 August 1915 when she, Helgoland, and four destroyers bombarded Italian forces on the island of Pelagosa which had recently been occupied by the Italians.Halpern 1994, p. 150 In late 1915, the Austro-Hungarian Navy began a series of raids against the merchant ships supplying Allied forces in Serbia and Montenegro. On the night of 22 November 1915, Saida, Helgoland, and the 1st Torpedo Division raided the Albanian coast and sank a pair of Italian transports carrying flour.Halpern 1994, p. 154 Chronic problems with Saidas turbines prevented her from being used for much of the war, leaving Helgoland and to shoulder most of the burden of the naval war in the Adriatic.Halpern 2004, p. 44 =Battle of the Strait of Otranto= Map showing the location of the Straits of Otranto at the southern end of the Adriatic In May 1917, Admiral Mikl√≥s Horthy planned a major raid on the drifters of the Otranto Barrage, using a force composed of the three Novara-class cruisers. The three cruisers were modified to resemble destroyers, and where thoroughly overhauled in preparation for the attack. Their boilers and turbines were cleaned to ensure the highest efficiency, and an anti-aircraft gun was installed on each ship. The ships were to attack separately while two destroyers made a diversionary attack on the drifters near the Albanian coast. On the night of 14 May, the ships departed port and managed to pass through the line of drifters in the darkness without being identified. As the sounds from the diversionary attack were heard, the drifters released their nets and began to head towards the Strait of Otranto.Halpern 2004, pp. 62‚Äì66 At 03:45, Saida and the other cruisers began their attacks on the drifters, though Saida stopped her engines and drifted toward the patrol vessels for about 30 minutes to conceal her position. Saida opened fire at 4:20, setting three drifters on fire, before stopping to pick up nineteen survivors.Halpern 2004, p. 64 The Austrian ships were first contacted during their retreat by a group of three French destroyers led by a small Italian scout cruiser, , but the heavier guns of the Austrian ships dissuaded the Allied commander from pressing an attack. They were intercepted shortly afterward by a stronger group of two British protected cruisers, and , escorted by four Italian destroyers. Dartmouth opened fire with her guns at a range of and Horthy ordered his ships to lay a smoke screen several minutes later. Horthy called for reinforcements that came in the form of the armored cruiser , which sortied with two destroyers and four torpedo boats.Halpern 2004, pp. 79-80 The heavy smoke nearly caused the three Austrian cruisers to collide, but it covered them from the fire from the British ships as they closed the range. When they emerged, the Austrian ships were only about from the British, a range much more suitable for the smaller Austrian guns.Halpern 2004, pp. 63, 72, 74‚Äì75, 80‚Äì86 British drifters sailing from their base in the Adriatic to the Barrage The three cruisers were gradually drawing away from their pursuers when Novara, leading the Austrian ships, was hit several times. Novaras boilers were disabled, leaving her dead in the water. Saida was preparing to take Novara under tow when several Italian destroyers attacked in succession. The weight of fire from the three cruisers prevented them from closing to torpedo range and they scored no hits. Sankt Georg arrived and Saida took Novara under tow for the voyage back to port.Halpern 2004, pp. 86-97 The four cruisers assembled in line-ahead formation, with Sankt Georg the last vessel in the line, to cover the other three ships. Later in the afternoon, the old coastal defense ship and three more torpedo boats joined the ships to strengthen the escort.Halpern 2004, pp. 100-101 The ship was tasked to participate in a major attack on the Allied ships defending the Strait of Otranto on 11 June 1918. Saida, Admiral Spaun, and four torpedo boats were to have attacked the seaplane base at Otranto to draw out the Allied fleet. The operation was called off after the dreadnought was sunk by an Italian motor torpedo boat en route to the rendezvous for the operation.Halpern 2004, p. 142 On 3 November 1918, the Austro-Hungarian government signed the Armistice of Villa Giusti with Italy, ending their participation in the conflict.Gardiner & Gray, p. 329 Following the armistice, the entire Austro-Hungarian fleet was transferred to the newly formed Yugoslavia.Halpern 1994, p. 177 =Italian service= In 1920, under the terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Saida and the rest of the fleet was surrendered to the Allied powers as war prizes.Sondhaus, p. 360 The ship was ceded to Italy, where she was commissioned as Venezia on 5 July 1921; she and her sisters were the largest vessels of the former Austro-Hungarian Navy to see active service in the navies of their former enemies.Sondhaus, p. 363 Venezias 6.6 cm anti-aircraft gun was replaced with a anti-aircraft gun of Italian manufacture; apart from that modification, the ship served in her original configuration. From 1930, she served as a barracks ship, first at Genoa and then in La Spezia.Gardiner & Gray, p. 264 In September 1935, Venezia was drydocked at La Spezia in preparation of being laid up before being scrapped.Willmott, p. 60 The ship was sold for scrapping 11 March 1937 and was subsequently broken up.

The two persuade Jason's girlfriend Natasha (Tara Reid), to call her best friend Melanie (Allira Jaques) to come with them, without informing them about the history of the site. After hours of driving, the group stop at a pub for food and directions to the farm. A pub patron, Blue (Jeff Watson), warns them not to continue resulting in a fight between Mick and another patron (Brad Bromfield), who angrily changes his mind after the fight and gives them directions. At a campfire, Melanie and Natasha confront the two and Mick eventually tells them the story of Charlie's Farm: In the 1980s, John Wilson (Bill Moseley) and his wife Meredith (Trudi Ross) are farmers, murderers and cannibals. The local townspeople, led by Blue, confront the couple over a slew of missing backpackers, which included Amber (Madeleine Kennedy), whom the two had just murdered and eaten. After an argument Blue shoots John dead while Meredith escapes with their mentally handicapped son Charlie. Meredith manages to hide Charlie before being caught, interrogated and beaten to death by the locals while Charlie watches. Charlie is never seen again, and is presumed dead. The next day, desperate to find the farm, Jason calls their boxer friend Tony Stewart (Kane Hodder) for directions. Tony warns them to be careful at the Farm. Arriving at the gate to the property, they decide to walk to the farmhouse. Upon exploring the house, Melanie finds an old teddy bear of Charlie's and decides to keep it. In the middle of the night when the group are sleeping, Melanie awakens to see an enormous, hulking figure looming over them; the full-grown Charlie (Nathan Jones). Melanie dismisses it as a dream. Morning comes and two backpackers, Gordon (David Beamish) and Alyssa (Genna Chanelle Hayes), arrive at the farm for the same reason as the group. Later on the group decides to split up and explore the property. Gordon and Alyssa come upon a barn which appears to be Charlie's base of operations. Charlie ambushes them and kills Gordon with an axe to the chest and Alyssa by crushing her head beneath a tractor wheel. Meanwhile, Mick and Melanie discover a lake and go skinny dipping. They are amazed at Charlie who is watching them from the dam. Mick goes to confront Charlie, naked, who cuts off Mick's genital and shoves it down his throat, killing him. Melanie runs and is chased through the woods but is killed when Charlie rips out her lower jaw. Natasha and Jason find another barn. Jason insists they go inside but Natasha refuses and waits. Tony, fearing for the group, goes to the Farm to check on them. Meanwhile, Jason, who was taking a long time inside, alarms Natasha who follows him in. Jason warns Natasha to be quiet as he finds Charlie roaming inside the barn. Tony arrives and faces Charlie head-on in hand-to-hand combat. Jason tries to assist but Tony is killed when Charlie tears out the skin on his neck. Jason is then also killed when Charlie slits his throat in front of Natasha. Natasha flees but is knocked unconscious and captured by Charlie. She then wakes up in an underground chamber, breaks free and escapes, discovering many corpses of Charlie's previous victims. Blue, the elderly patron from the pub, appears and assists Natasha in escaping. Charlie, however, catches up to them and kills Blue with an axe to the back. Natasha takes Blue's rifle and shoots Charlie in the chest, maybe kill him. She gets to blue's truck, but Charlie surprises her by impaling her with a rifle in her stomach, pulling out her guts, which he tosses away after killing her. Charlie then picks up her dead body and goes back to his land.

Bangladesh said that it will not recognize Israel until there is an independent Palestine. Diplomacy The Bangladeshi passport is valid for all countries of the world except Israel Bangladesh is one of 29 UN member states that does not recognize the state of Israel. It is one of several countries that officially bans its citizens from traveling to Israel and does not accept Israeli passports. In November 2003, Bangladeshi journalist Salah Choudhury was arrested for attempting to fly to Tel Aviv, arraigned for \\"sedition, treason, and blasphemy\\", and sentenced to a seven-year prison term. Bangladesh officially supports a sovereign Palestinian state and \\"an end to Israel's illegal occupation of Palestine\\". In a September 2011 statement published in The Jerusalem Post, an Israeli government spokesperson said, \\"We have no conflict with Bangladesh. We want dialogue. We want people-to-people relations. We welcome the religious-minded people of Bangladesh to visit the holy land of Jerusalem\\". Israel fruitlessly \\"sought a relationship with Bangladesh\\" after they had established \\"full diplomatic relations with China and India in 1992\\". Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina said in 2014, \\"We have been continuing our support to the Palestinians and occupation of their land by the Israelis is never acceptable\\". Dr Shadman Zaman became the first Bangladeshi national in history to visit Israel in 2017 using his Bangladeshi passport. Since then, he is said to be residing in England after receiving multiple death threats and potentially facing the prospect of a trial for treason. Trade Bangladesh maintains a ban on trade with Israel even though both countries are members of the World Trade Organization. In 2014, it was found from the official statistics of the Bangladesh Export Promotion Bureau that Bangladesh had exported a small amount of merchandise goods worth about to Israel in 2013‚Äì14 fiscal year. In recent years however, it is found that Bangladeshi products are exported to Israel through USA or European Union or other third countries. Bangladesh Liberation War Israel was one of the first nations to recognize the independent Bangladesh in February 1972. Both the Israeli Government and the Israeli general public supported the aspirations of the Bengali people during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. After the independence of Bangladesh, the newly formed country was quickly recognized by Israel on 4 February 1972. However the Government of Bangladesh officially rejected the Israeli recognition. On behalf of the Bangladeshi Government, the then Foreign Minister of Bangladesh, Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad, issued a letter saying this recognition was not acceptable. 2006 Lebanon War In the immediate aftermath of the 2006 Lebanon War, Bangladesh offered to send battalions of its infantrymen to help with the UN peacekeeping force, but Israel rejected it stating that Bangladesh does not recognize Israel. Although Israel rejected the country's participation, Bangladesh was one of first countries whose troops reached the shores of south Lebanon. Whereas western nations, such as the original leader and top contributor to Lebanon, France, delayed their deployment. As of May 2015, Bangladesh has 326 peacekeepers participating in UNIFIL in Lebanon.  Allegation of Mossad connection  In May 2016, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina alleged that opposition parties BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh have joined together with Israeli national intelligence agency Mossad to overthrow her government through a coup after it had been reported that Aslam Chowdhury, the joint secretary general of BNP met the Israeli politician Mendi N. Safadi during a visit to India. Aslam claimed that the meeting was accidental. On 7 June 2016, Bangladeshi Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan alleged that the main opposition party BNP has link to the recent fundamentalists attacks in Bangladesh and these attacks are part of a wider conspiracy that also involved Mossad, the national intelligence agency of Israel.

One of its best-known applications is in the exponent of the Gamow factor (also known as the penetrability factor), : P = \\\\exp(-2 \\\\pi \\\\eta) , which is the probability of an s-wave nuclide to penetrate the Coulomb barrier, according to the WKB approximation. This factor is particularly helpful in characterizing the nuclear contribution to low-energy nucleon-scattering cross-sections - namely, through the astrophysical S-factor.

Hudson Law Office is a historic commercial building on Hudson Avenue in the center of Guilford, Maine. Built c. 1867, it is an architecturally distinctive small Italianate/Second Empire structure, which was used by two generations of lawyers in the Hudson family as a law office. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history The Hudson Law Office building is located near the center of Guilford, on the west side of Hudson Avenue a short way south of its junction with Maine State Route 150. It is a wood-frame structure, stories in height, with a flared slate mansard roof, wooden clapboard siding, and a granite foundation. Its main (east-facing) facade is three bays wide, with sash windows in the outer bays and the entrance in the center. The windows are topped by lintels with an entablature and carved woodwork above. The main entrance is sheltered by a hood with ornately carved brackets. There are two dormers above, with gable roofs topped by finials, and decorative carvings on the sides. The building is one of the most architecturally sophisticated buildings in the rural community. The office was built c. 1867 by Henry Hudson, a prominent lawyer who conducted his practice in Guilford from 1849 until his death in 1877. His son, also a lawyer, continued to use the office until his retirement in 1919. After undergoing a variety of other uses in the 20th century, it was once again made into a law office in the 1970s.

He headed the Genna crime family with his brothers. He was killed by police officers after a shootout with North Siders, being one of the only American organized crime leaders to be killed by a policeman.  Early life  Michele Genna was born on January 18, 1895 in Marsala, Sicily.http://www.findagrave.com/cgi- bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln;=genna&GSbyrel;=all&GSdyrel;=all&GSob;=n&GRid;=3395& Genna's parents, Antonino Genna Sr. and Maria Concetta Utica, had six other sons: Antonio \\"the Gentleman\\", Angelo \\"Bloody Angelo\\", Vincenzo \\"Jim\\", Pietro \\"Peter\\", Salvatore \\"Sam\\", and Nicola Genna (who stayed in Sicily); and two daughters: Rosa Laudicina and Caterina Mariana. He and his brothers entered the U.S. through New York around 1910.  Prohibition and O'Banion  The Gennas became a close knit Marsala-based Mafia and bootlegging gang. In 1919, the Gennas obtained a federal license to legally manufacture industrial alcohol, which they sold illegally. Angelo and his brothers operated from Chicago's Little Italy, which was located west of the Chicago Loop.\\"La Cosa Nostra database: Genna Brothers\\" Brothers They started selling their extra alcohol at cut-rate prices outside of their territory. This caused a problem with the North Side Gang leader Dean O'Banion, who went to South Side Gang leader John \\"Johnny the Fox\\" Torrio and Unione Siciliana boss Mike Merlo to get the Gennas to back down. When Torrio refused, O'Banion began hijacking shipments of alcohol belonging to the Genna brothers. On November 3, 1924, Dean O'Banion inadvertently signed his own death warrant during an argumentative phone call to arch-rival Angelo Genna. Their disagreement originated at The Ship, the gambling casino that the North Side gang boss owned along with the Torrio Syndicate. On this day, O'Banion sat in with Al Capone, Frank Nitti, Frank Rio, and others to tally the week's profits. It was mentioned that Angelo Genna had dropped a large amount of cash, plus a sizable marker. Capone recommended that they cancel the marker as a professional courtesy. O'Banion, instead, got Genna on the telephone and demanded that he pay his debt within a week. With this personal insult, Angelo Genna and his family could no longer be restrained.Schoenberg, Robert J. Mr. Capone. New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 1992. , pg. 116 Until then, Merlo and the Unione had refused to sanction a hit on O'Banion. However, Merlo had terminal cancer and died on November 8, 1924. With Merlo gone, the Gennas and South Siders were free to move on O'Banion. Torrio ordered the Gennas to murder O'Banion; the brothers carried out the hit on November 10, 1924. Francesco Ioele and two Genna hitmen‚ÄîGiovanni Scalise and Alberto Anselmi‚Äîentered O'Banion's flower shop, Schofield, and when Yale and O'Banion shook hands, Scalise and Anselmi fired two bullets into O'Banion's chest and two into his throat, and one of them fired a final bullet into the back of his skull as he was lying on the floor, face-down.  Gang war and death  After O'Banion's death, the North Siders‚Äînow led by Henry Earl \\"Hymie\\" Weiss‚Äîattempted to kill Torrio outside his home on January 24, 1925, causing Torrio to flee to Naples; leaving his top bouncer‚ÄîAlphonse \\"Scarface\\" Capone‚Äîin charge of the Outfit. On May 26, 1925, Weiss, Vincent \\"the Schemer\\" Drucci, and George \\"Bugs\\" Moran shot and killed Angelo Genna in a high-speed car chase. On June 13, 1925, Genna, Scalise, and Anselmi had a shootout with the North Siders. After the shootout, the three men were chased by Chicago Police detectives Michael Conway, rookie William Sweeny, officer Charles Walsh and another officer, Harold Olson. The three opened fire on the policemen killing Walsh and Olson and wounding a third officer. ODMP memorial Olsen and Walsh Police shot Genna in the leg, severing an artery; Genna died in an ambulance after he kicked an officer in the face.  Funeral  Genna's family had planned for his funeral to be lavish like his late brother Angelo's funeral, but the funeral was quick and quiet due to the two policemen he killed. Police spread the word that they would arrest any gangster attending. No gangster attended, not wanting to be identified as one at his funeral and connected with the crime.  Aftermath  On July 9, 1925, Genna's brother Antonio was ambushed and killed by a Genna traitor on orders of Moran and Weiss. After Antonio's death, the three remaining Chicago brothers‚ÄîSam, Jim, and Peter‚Äîfled Chicago; leaving the Genna territory to be taken over by Joe Aiello and his brothers, then by the Outfit.The true and complete story of 'machine gun' Jack McGurn by Amanda Jayne Parr pg.244 References External links *Mike \\"Mike the Devil\\" Genna at Find A Grave *Charles Dion O'Banion at Find A Grave *The Dean O'Banion Project at Dean O'Banion Category:1895 births Category:1925 deaths Category:People from Marsala Category:Italian emigrants to the United States Category:American mobsters of Sicilian descent Category:People shot dead by law enforcement officers in the United States Category:Prohibition-era gangsters Category:People from Chicago Category:Deaths by firearm in Illinois ","title":"Mike Genna"},{"id":"45247998","text":"The Governor of Chernihiv Oblast is the head of executive branch for the Chernihiv Oblast.
