Pasque di sangue. Ebrei d'Europa e omicidi rituali) is a 2007 book by Israeli historian Ariel Toaff. The book analyses a notorious medieval trial regarding accusations of the ritual murder of a child by Jews for the purposes of Passover.S.Buttaroni, S. Musial (eds.) Ritual Murder Legend in European History, Krakow, Nuremberg, Frankfort, 2003 p.12 reads:'It is important to state from the very beginning that Jewish ritual murder never took place. Today proving such theories wrong is not the goal of scientific research'. Cited Toaff, Pasque di sangue 2007 p.225 n.2 The book sparked intense controversy including calls for him to resign from or be fired from his professorship; the questioning of his research, historical method(s), and motives as they relate to his writing of the book; threats to his life; and demands that he be prosecuted.MKs demand the author of blood libel book be prosecuted (Haaretz). Contents=Chapter 1 Toaff opens his book with a detailed vignette of the arrival in Venice from Rome of the philosemitic'molto favorevole agli ebrei', as Elia Capsali, then Rabbi of Heraklion, noted, and as cited by Toaff p.20 Holy Roman Emperor Friedrich III. It was his third visit to the city, and his arrival was met by an influx of numerous visitors, merchants, adventurers, clerics and relic-hawkers, all keen to obtain certificates attesting to their merits, services and learning. Among the various groups was a delegation of Ashkenazi Jews, leaders of a community that, over the preceding century, had emigrated in considerable numbers from German lands towards northern Italy where the expanding commercial empire of Venice offered prospects of prosperity and relief from the afflictions they had suffered in northern lands, in waves of antisemitic pogroms from the age of the Crusades to the Black Death. Venice had in its employ a spy and intriguer, the Cretan adventurer and businessman David Mavrogonato, regarded as a malshin (moser) by the Jews of his native Heraklion, who was engaged in furthering Venetian interests in the Ottoman Empire's dominions in the Aegean. He, and his bodyguard and successor Salomone of Piove, enjoyed considerable privileges for services they rendered to the Council of Ten. Both attempted to employ Jewish physicians in an attempt to assassinate Mehmed II. The cameo role played by these two allows Toaff to touch on the politics of intrigue within the larger Jewish community. As Mavrogonato and Salomon of Piove acted on Venice's behalf to kill a Turkish Sultan, so one of Salomon's henchman, Salomon Fürstunger, connived with Pavia's powerful banker Mendele b.Abraham to get an Italian priest to assassinate by poisoning those responsible for the trial at Trento, over the case of Simon of Trent, which had led to the executions of many Jews in 1475. In examining the condotte, pacts negotiated between Jewish leaders and the local authorities stipulating the duties and conditions under which the Jewish communities were given the rights of residency, Toaff elicits a significant difference in cultural values between the native Italian Jewish communities, and those hailing from the German- speaking world beyond the Alps. The Ashkenazi retained their deep suspicion of the Christian world which, in Germany, had caused them grievous injury, even within the, at the time, more hospitable world of northern Italy. In various agreements, they asked for and obtained strict guarantees from their hosts against forced conversion by friars and priests, the right to use kosher foods, the right to physical safety, severe punishments to be inflicted on any one who should harm them, and freedom from having their assets seized. Strict conditions were negotiated to govern the reliability of witnesses in the case of criminal charges being laid against them. They obtained the right to be allowed to follow their own religious observances with 'zealous scruple'. In some condotte, the authorities were asked, and consented to, expelling any Jews from the city (Gemona) who converted to Christianity. Both groups competed as suppliers of credit, but the older Italian Jewish communities quickly lost out to the new Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazi, and were forced to close down their banking operations in many northern areas in consequence. Toaff describes entrepreneurs from these Ashkenazi communities as brash with the new power of the financial authority they had expeditiously acquired in a mere five decades after their arrival:- > '(They were) self-confident and often arrogant and insolent in their > relationships with rulers, observing laws only when it was strictly > necessary or too dangerous to act otherwise.'A.Toaff, Pasque di sangue Il > Mulino, Bologna, 2007 p.29 Chapter 2 Salomon of Piove's two sons, Marcuccio and Salamoncino, outshone their father in their rash adventurousness and bold wheeling and dealing. The first was distinguished for his braggart haughtiness - he was defined by Venetian authorities as fidelis noster civis, and was assured of that city's protection - sufficiently so to boast of taking on and beating any Christian who might prove bold enough to mess around with him. The other son, Salamoncino, took care of that grey area where shady business ventures and the criminal underworld rubbed elbows,Toaff, Pasque di Sangue, ibid.p.36 attempting to assassinate Mehmed II, dealing in counterfeit goods and forbidden trade, and fleecing the Jews of Padova, rabbis, widows, students and the poor, of their savings. When his henchman David Schwab, hit by a cherem by a rabbinical victim, sought arbitration, Salamoncino hired an assassin to kill one of the other members of the swindling consortium, Aaron of Wil. The attempt failed, Salamoncino's role was discovered. He freely confessed to his Venetian protectors and was imprisoned for 6 months and banned for 4 years from Venice. After one more imbroglio he passes from history. Chapter 3 Tobias of Magdeburg, one of the doctors visiting Venice in search of a conferment of an imperial recognition from Frederick III in 1469, gave testimony linking the German Jews who had flocked to that city in the Emperor's train, with the figure of David Mavrogonato. According to his testimony at the Simon of Trent trial, Mavrogonato had imported, perhaps from Cyprus, large quantities of both sugar and blood for the Venetian market. Specifically, Tobias testified that the German Jews were keen to procure from the daring Cretan trader the blood of Christian children, not for confectioning rare medicines, but rather for obscure magical religious rites.Toaff, Pasque di sangue ibid. p.45 Mavrogonato, wary of the dangers of direct involvement, delegated negotiations to a certain Hossar, i.e. Asher of Cologne, a charlatan known in Venice as el Zudio de la barba. According to further testimony by Israel Wolfgang, a double-dealing opportunist, powdered blood from Mavrogonato's shipment had been used in preparing the wine and unleavened bread for the Passover feast in Salomon of Piove's home, in 1471. Reception and reactions Reactions to the book concentrated on the final chapter, which addressed the story of Simon of Trent, a young boy murdered by Jews in order to extract his blood to be used in making bread for Passover rituals. Roman Catholics commemorated Simon's martyrdom for five centuries, until, in 1965, the Vatican published Nostra aetate, which aimed at extirpating antisemitism from the Catholic faithful. The Bishop of Trent signed a decree proclaiming that the accusation against the city's Jews of that city was unfounded. Shortly after its publication, press reports were circulated stating that Toaff claims in his book that there was some truth to the story, and that Christian children may have been killed by \\"a minority of fundamentalist Jews of Ashkenazi origin.\\" In an interview with Haaretz Toaff said: \\"Over many dozens of pages I proved the centrality of blood on Passover,\\" Toaff said. \\"Based on many sermons, I concluded that blood was used, especially by Ashkenazi Jews, and that there was a belief in the special curative powers of children's blood. It turns out that among the remedies of Ashkenazi Jews were powders made of blood.\\"Bar-Ilan prof. defiant on blood libel book 'even if crucified' (Haaretz). The article also states that: \\"Although the use of blood is prohibited by Jewish law, Toaff says he found proof of permission given by a highly restricted school of Ashkenazi rabbis to use blood, even human blood. 'The rabbis permitted it both because the blood was already dried, and because in Ashkenazi communities it was an accepted custom that took on the force of law.'\\" Dr. Amos Luzzatto, former president of the Union of Italian Jewish Communities, has said, \\"I would expect a more serious statement than 'it might have been true.'\\" He also expressed dismay at the sensationalism with which Corriere della Sera, Italy's leading daily, treated the issue.Historian gives credence to blood libel By LISA PALMIERI- BILLIG.

Twelve of Italy's chief rabbis in a press release refuting Toaff's claims declared: \\"It is totally inappropriate to utilize declarations extorted under torture centuries ago to reconstruct bizarre and devious historical theses.\\" Kenneth Stow, Professor Emeritus of Jewish History at the University of Haifa, wrote: \\"To disparage this book is not, as some have suggested, to challenge academic freedom. It is to decry bad historiographical method.\\"Blood Libel: Ariel Toaff's Perplexing Book By Kenneth Stow (HNN). Writing in the same newspaper, Prof. Ronnie Po- chia Hsia states: \\"There is plenty of evidence to suggest hatred between Jews and Christians, as many scholars have demonstrated regarding the Middle Ages. It is, however, quite a leap of imagination to take testimonies obtained under torture and to construct a hypothetical reality based on unrelated circumstantial facts. It may be true that dried blood or other exotic ingredients were used in popular medicine, Jewish or Gentile - not being an expert on the history of medicine, I remain open-minded on this; but it is sheer blind logic to jump to the conclusion that Jewish groups might have used Christian blood for ritual practices.\\"The real blood of Passover (Haaretz). According to David Abulafia, Professor of Mediterranean History at the University of Cambridge, \\"... the significance of blood in Christian culture, and in particular the significance of the Eucharistic sacrifice, is largely ignored as an explanation of the fantasies, for such they were, about Passover rituals, fantasies in which the unleavened bread and wine became explicit negations of the body and blood of Christ. The blood libel has played a particularly nefarious role in the history of anti-Semitism.\\"\\"Blood libels are back\\" by David Abulafia (Times Literary Supplement) February 28, 2007. Withdrawal and republication A week after its publication, Ariel Toaff withdrew the book from circulation, in order to \\"re-edit the passages which comprised the basis of the distortions and falsehoods that have been published in the media\\"'Blood libel' author halts press by Matthew Wagner and A.P.

Engle was a sort of super-utility man at all positions but pitcher and catcher, playing mainly at first base and third. He entered the majors in 1909 with the New York Highlanders of the American League, playing for them one and a half seasons before joining the Boston Red Sox (1910–14). In his rookie year for New York, he hit a .278 batting average with a career-highs of 20 doubles and 71 RBI in 135 games. His most productive season came with Boston in 1913, when he posted career-numbers in average (.289), runs (75), triples (12) and stolen bases (28). He was also a member of the Boston Red Sox 1912 World Series champion team which defeated the New York Giants in eight games. During the 1914 midseason, Engle joined a significant number of players who jumped to the Buffalo teams of the outlaw Federal League (1914–15), returning to the American League with the Cleveland Indians in 1916, his last major league season. Engle (left) pictured with William P. Edmunds in Ariel 1921, Vermont yearbook In an eight-season career, Engle was a .265 hitter (748-for-2822) with 12 home runs and 318 RBI in 836 games, including 373 runs, 101 doubles, 39 triples, 128 stolen bases, and a .335 on-base percentage. He made 748 appearances as a fielder at first base (255), third base (163), left field (142), center field (111), second base (81), right field (25) and shortstop (9). Following his majors career, Engle was the athletic director and coached the University of Vermont football team, and he later coached the freshman baseball team at Yale University, where the coach of the varsity squad was his former teammate and close friend Smoky Joe Wood. Engle died in Boston, Massachusetts at age 55. The 1912 World Series Engle will be known forever as the man who hit the ball that Fred Snodgrass missed in the eight and final game of the 1912 World Series. The Series lasted eight games, due to a 6-6 tie in Game 2 when the game was called by darkness after 11 innings. Engle had appeared twice before during the Series in pinch-hitting duties. In Game 6, he hit a two-run RBI double off Giants pitcher Rube Marquard that scored Boston's only runs in a 5-2 losing effort. The decisive Game 8 at Fenway Park faced Joe Wood for Boston and Christy Mathewson for the New York Giants, who had broken a 1-1 tie by scoring a run in the first half of the 10th inning. The Red Sox started its half and manager Jake Stahl sent Engle to pinch-hit for pitcher Wood. Then, he hit a fly ball off Mathewson that came toward CF Snodgrass, who dropped the ball. Snodgrass made a fine catch on the next batter, Harry Hooper, but Mathewson walked Steve Yerkes, gave a single to Tris Speaker, and Engle went on to score the tying run. Another walk to Duffy Lewis and a sacrifice fly by Larry Gardner scored Yerkes with the winning run to give Boston the game and the series.

Construction was completed in the early 1980s. Charles Bluhdorn's daughter, Dominique Bluhdorn, is the current president of the Altos de Chavón Cultural Center Foundation.

Adding authenticity to the project is the charming St. Stanislaus Church (Iglesia San Estanislao de Cracovia in Spanish) with its plaza and sparkling fountain that is a popular wedding venue. The Church of St Stanislaus was named after the patron saint of Poland in tribute to Pope John Paul II, who visited Santo Domingo in 1979 and left some of the saint's ashes behind.

Its common name commemorates the English zoologist William Thomas Blanford. Taxonomy and systematics Blanford's lark was formerly included in either the greater short-toed lark (C. brachydactyla) or the red-capped lark (C. cinerea) but is now commonly treated as a separate species. Alternate names for Blanford's lark include Blandford's lark, Blandford's short-toed lark and Blanford's red-capped lark. Subspecies Two subspecies are recognized: * C. b. blanfordi - (Shelley, 1902): Found in northern Eritrea * C. b. erlangeri - Erlanger's lark- (Neumann, 1906): Found in Ethiopia Description Blanford's lark is 14-15 centimetres long. The upperparts are pale sandy-brown with some darker streaking and the crown is rufous. The underparts are pale and plain apart from a small dark patch on the side of the neck made up of vertical streaks. The greater short-toed lark is similar but has a greyer, more-streaked crown. Erlanger's and red-capped larks have darker upperparts with more streaking and a darker rufous crown. Erlanger's lark has larger dark neck-patches while in red-capped lark the patches are rufous. Blanford's lark has a sparrow-like flight-call. The song is given in a circular song-flight and includes a mixture of chew-chew-chew-chew notes and fluid phrases. Habitat and movements They occur on open stony plains, often with bushes. In Arabia, it breeds between 1800 and 2500 metres above sea-level with some birds dispersing to lower ground in winter. The species is often seen in flocks outside the breeding season.

It often marked the point at which the father became more involved with the raising of a boy.Baumgarten, p. 168 Reasons The main reason for keeping boys in dresses was toilet training, or the lack thereof.\\"Boy's Dress\\", V&A; Museum of childhood, accessed February 8, 2012 The change was probably made once boys had reached the age when they could easily undo the rather complicated fastenings of many early modern breeches and trousers. Before roughly 1550 various styles of long robes were in any case commonly worn by adult males of various sorts, so boys wearing them could probably not be said to form a distinct phenomenon. Dresses were also easier to make with room for future growth, in an age when clothes were much more expensive than now for all classes. The \\"age of reason\\" was generally considered to be about seven, and breeching corresponded roughly with that age for much of the period. The many portraits of Balthasar Charles, Prince of Asturias (1629–1646), son of Philip IV of Spain, show him wearing breeches from about the age of six. For working-class children, about whom even less is known than their better-off contemporaries, it may well have marked the start of a working life. The debate between his parents over the breeching of the hero of Tristram Shandy (1761) suggests that the timing of the event could be rather arbitrary; in this case it is his father who suggests the time has arrived.The episode takes up Chapters 48–53 of Book 3 (though it is neither as long nor as conclusive as that might suggest), which was published in 1761 Gutenberg project text (large file) The 17th-century French cleric and memoirist François-Timoléon de Choisy is supposed to have worn dresses until he was eighteen. Celebrations In the 19th century, photographs were often taken of the boy in his new trousers, typically with his father. He might also collect small gifts of money by going round the neighbourhood showing off his new clothes. Friends, of the mother as much as the boy, might gather to see his first appearance. A letter of 1679 from Lady Anne North to her widowed and absent son gives a lengthy account of the breeching of her grandson:\\"...Never had any bride that was to be dressed upon her wedding-night more hands about her, some the legs and some the armes, the taylor buttn'ing and other putting on the sword, and so many lookers on that had I not a ffinger amongst them I could not have seen him. When he was quit drest he acted his part as well as any of them.... since you could not have the first sight I resolved you should have a full relation...\\". The dresses he wore before she calls \\"coats\\".Quoted in: Dressing the Elite: Clothes in Early Modern England; Susan Vincent;p. 59; 2003; Berg Publishers; Online extract Unbreeched boys Louis XIV and his unbreeched brother. In French royal portraits gender can be hard to tell, except by the absence of jewellery (1640s) English boys (1670) The first progression, for both boys and girls, was when they were shortcoated or taken out of the long dresses that came well below the feet that were worn by babies—and which have survived as the modern Christening robe. It was not possible to walk in these, which no doubt dictated the timing of the change. Toddlers' gowns often featured leading strings, which were narrow straps of fabric or ribbon attached at the shoulder and held by an adult while the child was learning to walk.Ashelford, Jane: The Art of Dress: Clothing and Society 1500–1914Baumgarten, p. 166 After this stage, in the Early Modern period it is usually not too difficult to distinguish between small boys and girls in commissioned portraits of the wealthy, even where the precise identities are no longer known. The smaller figures of small children in genre painting have less detail, and painters often did not trouble to include distinguishing props as they did in portraits. Working-class children presumably were more likely than the rich to wear handed down clothes that were used by both sexes. In portraits the colours of clothes often keep the rough gender distinctions we see in adults—girls wear white or pale colours, and boys darker ones, including red. This may not entirely reflect reality, but the differences in hairstyles, and in the style of clothing at the chest, throat and neck, waist, and often the cuffs, presumably do. In the 19th century, perhaps as childhood became sentimentalised, it becomes harder to tell the clothing apart between the sexes; the hair remains the best guide, but some mothers were evidently unable to resist keeping this long too. By this time the age of breeching was falling closer to two or three, where it would remain. Boys in most periods had shorter hair, often cut in a straight fringe, whilst girls' hair was longer, and in earlier periods sometimes worn \\"up\\" in adult styles, at least for special occasions like portraits. In the 19th century, wearing hair up itself became a significant rite of passage for girls at puberty, as part of their \\"coming out\\" into society. Younger girls' hair was always long, or plaited. Sometimes a quiff or large curl emerges from under a boy's cap. Boys are most likely to have side partings, and girls centre partings. Girls' bodices usually reflected adult styles, in their best clothes at least, and low bodices and necklaces are common.When front-closing gowns with stomachers became fashionable for women at the end of the 17th century, young girls continued to wear back-closing bodices, which from this time began to be cut and trimmed more simply than adult women's gowns; see Ashelford, Jane: The Art of Dress: Clothing and Society 1500–1914 Boys often, though not always, had dresses that were closed up to the neck-line, and often buttoned at the front—rare for girls. They frequently wear belts, and in periods when female dresses had a V at the waist, this is often seen on little girls, but not on boys. Linen and lace at the neck and cuffs tend to follow adult styles for each gender, although again the clothes worn in portraits no doubt do not reflect everyday wear, and may not reflect even best clothes accurately. Unbreeched boys of the nobility are sometimes seen wearing swords or daggers on a belt. A speech by King Leontes from Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale implies that, as common sense would suggest, these could not be drawn, and were purely for show: — he also calls his dress a \\"coat\\"; \\"cote\\" was a French and English term, dating back to the Middle Ages, for earlier adult male gowns and seems to have been kept in use for boys' clothes to preserve some gender distinction. Usually jewellery is not worn by boys, but when worn it is likely to be dark in colour, like the coral beads worn by the Flemish boy above. Coral was considered by medical authorities the best material to use for teething aids, and a combined rattle and whistle (in silver) and teething stick (in coral) can be seen in many portraits.Here, the two children from Boston at top, and the Boucher of Philipe Egalité in the Gallery. Virtually identical ones can be seen from a century or more earlier. Examples from the Metropolitan King Charles I of England in 1637 by Van Dyck. From left: Mary, James—unbreeched at four, Charles, Elizabeth and Anne. In portraits even very young girls may wear necklaces, often of pearls. In the Van Dyck portrait of the children of Charles I, only the absence of a necklace and the colour of his dress distinguish the unbreeched James (aged four) from his next youngest sister Elizabeth, whilst their elder brother and sister, at seven and six, have moved on to adult styles. In cases of possible doubt, painters tend to give boys masculine toys to hold like drums, whips for toy horses, or bows. The next step In the late 18th century, new philosophies of child-rearing led to clothes that were thought especially suitable for children. Toddlers wore washable dresses called frocks of linen or cotton.Baumgarten, p. 171 British and American boys after perhaps three began to wear rather short pantaloons and short jackets, and for very young boys the skeleton suit was introduced. These gave the first real alternative to dresses, and became fashionable across Europe. Boy in a light frock, with masculine hat (on ground) and drum, England, late 18th century pantaloon suit. Germany, late 18th century The skeleton suit consisted of trousers and tight-fitting jacket, buttoned together at the waist or higher up; they were not unlike the romper suit introduced in the early 20th century.Payne, Blanche; Winakor, Geitel; Farrell-Beck Jane: The History of Costume, from the Ancient Mesopotamia to the Twentieth Century, 2nd Edn, pp. 424–25, HarperCollins, 1992. But dresses for boys did not disappear, and again became common from the 1820s, when they were worn at about knee-length, sometimes with visible pantaloons called pantalettes as underwear, a style also worn by little girls. As the next stage, from the mid-19th century boys usually progressed into shorts at breeching—again these are more accommodating to growth, and cheaper. The knickerbocker suit was also popular. In England and some other countries, many school uniforms still mandate shorts for boys until about nine or ten. The jackets of boys after breeching lacked adult tails, and this may have influenced the adult tail-less styles which developed, initially for casual wear of various sorts, like the smoking-jacket and sports jacket. After the First World War the wearing of boy's dresses seems finally to have died out, except for babies. Gallery Image:Pieter Bruegel d.

Due to the small school size, there was generally no need to qualify for any of the sports, as cutoffs would be meaningless and there was simply not a large enough applicant pool to allow cuts. In later years, higher demand led to cuts in both cheerleading, basketball, and girls' football (soccer). While this allowed for a large percentage of the student body to participate (an estimated 85% of students are involved in athletics), some teams were less successful than larger more- competitive schools.

Student government  There were three student governments at MHS: elementary, middle and high school. There had also been an overarching student council responsible for the well-being of the entire school. For the middle and high school, each class elected a president and vice president. The high school student government was responsible for fund-raising, planning for and coordinating dances, Spirit Week, prom, and the commencement ceremony, which was traditionally held at Fountains Abbey in Ripon.

Gregory. \\"The Macroeconomist as Scientist and Engineer\\". The Journal of Economic Perspectives. Vol. 20, No. 4 (Fall, 2006), p. 35., was a post-World War II academic movement in economics that worked towards absorbing the macroeconomic thought of John Maynard Keynes into neoclassical economics. The resultant macroeconomic theories and models are termed neo-Keynesian economics. Mainstream economics was largely dominated by the synthesis until the 1970s, being largely Keynesian in macroeconomics and neoclassical in microeconomics.Clark, B. (1998). Political-economy: A comparative approach. Westport, CT: Preager. Much of neo-Keynesian economic theory was developed by John Hicks and Maurice Allais, and popularized by the mathematical economist Paul Samuelson. The process began soon after the publication of Keynes' General Theory with the IS/LM model (investment saving–liquidity preference money supply) first presented by John Hicks in a 1937 article.Hicks, J.R. (1937). \\"Mr. Keynes and the 'Classics': A Suggested Interpretation,\\" Econometrica, 5(2), pp. 147-159 (via JSTOR). It continued with adaptations of the supply and demand model of markets to Keynesian theory. It represents incentives and costs as playing a pervasive role in shaping decision making. An immediate example of this is the consumer theory of individual demand, which isolates how prices (as costs) and income affect quantity demanded. Samuelson appears to have coined the term \\"neoclassical synthesis\\", and helped disseminate the resultant work, partly through his technical and academic writing, and also via his influential textbook, Economics.Blanchard, Olivier Jean (2008), \\"neoclassical synthesis,\\" The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, 2nd Edition.

G. Wodehouse, and music by Rudolf Friml. It is based on the classic 1844 novel by Alexandre Dumas, père. Set in France and England in 1626, it recounts the adventures of a young man named d'Artagnan after he leaves home to become a Musketeer of the Guard. The three men of the title are his friends Athos, Porthos and Aramis. The original 1928 production on Broadway, and a 1930 West End run, both starring Dennis King as d'Artagnan, were successful, but a 1984 attempt at a much-revised Broadway revival flopped. Plot synopsis In early 17th century France, the poor but virile d'Artagnan travels to Paris to join the Musketeers (the King's bodyguard). He meets and falls in love with Lady Constance Bonacieux, a lady-in-waiting to Queen Anne. Meanwhile, Cardinal Richelieu learns that the Queen has given a diamond heart brooch, which was a present to her from the King, as a token of love to the Duke of Buckingham. Richelieu suggests that the King ask the Queen to wear it at a planned royal gala. Richelieu dispatches the Comte de Rochefort and Milady de Winter to London to recover the gem, which he plans to unveil at the gala in order to reveal that the Queen has been unfaithful. The Queen asks her lady-in-waiting, Constance Bonacieux, to involve the Musketeers in the jewel's speedy recovery so that she might foil the plot. But when the Musketeers reach London, they are too late: Lady de Winter has arrived first. D’Artagnan uses his seductive charms upon Milady de Winter and steals the bauble. After a rousing sword fight, the Musketeers kill de Rochefort and rush back to Paris just in time to bring the jewel to the gala. King Louis fastens it to the Queen's shoulder just as he did when he first gave it to her.

Early life  Born in Little Roderick, Kurow, Otago, New Zealand, she was one of five children of Harry Rainy Parker and his wife, Frances Emily Jane Kitchener. Her family lived at the Waihao Downs Homestead from 1870 to 1895, when they moved to Little Roderick. Little Roderick is a division of Station Peak on the north side of the Waitaki River, Waimate District (not in Kurow, as reported elsewhere). Parker came from a well off background and was a niece of Field-Marshal Lord Kitchener. who paid for her education at Newnham College Cambridge. Her famous uncle would later declare himself \\"disgusted\\" by her involvement in the women's movement. In New Zealand, women were granted the franchise on 19 September 1893 and voted for the first time in the election held on 28 November 1893. Parker left New Zealand in 1896 to study at Newnham College, Cambridge. Her tuition there was paid for by her uncle. She received a degree in 1899, and subsequently spent several years working as a teacher in France and New Zealand.  Suffrage work  On her return to Britain, Parker began campaigning for women's suffrage, initially with the Scottish Universities Women's Suffrage Union, and later with Emmeline Pankhurst's Women's Social and Political Union, for which she became organiser in the West of Scotland in 1912. Parker took part in increasingly militant actions, for which she was imprisoned several times. She served six weeks for obstruction in 1908 following a demonstration. Later she was sentenced to four months in Holloway Prison in March 1912 after taking part in a WSPU-organised window-smashing raid. Parker joined other suffragettes in defiantly embroidering her signature on a piece of cloth, under the eyes of the wardresses, now known as The Suffragette Handkerchief. Like many suffragettes she went on hunger strike and was subjected to force-feeding. alt= Later that year she was imprisoned twice, once for breaking windows, and once for breaking into The Music Hall in Aberdeen with the intention of disrupting an appearance by David Lloyd George. On both occasions she was released after going on hunger-strike for several days. By 1914 the suffrage movement was becoming increasingly violent, with many buildings around Britain being bombed and burned. In July of that year, Parker and a fellow campaigner, Ethel Moorhead attempted to set fire to Burns Cottage in Alloway. A watchman was on duty, and while Moorhead escaped, Parker was arrested. While on remand she went on hunger and thirst strike. Knowing that there was little chance of recapturing her if she was released, the prison authorities subjected her to particularly brutal force-feeding; when she was unable to hold down food, they attempted to feed her through her rectum, resulting in serious bruising. There was controversy when Parker wrote about her brutal treatment in 1914 in Votes for Women newspaper, under then name 'Janet Parker' . She was seriously ill when finally released to a nursing home, but was still able to escape. Parker had been given a Hunger Strike Medal \\"for Valour\\" by WSPU. Before she could be recaptured the First World War broke out, resulting in an end to militant campaigning and an amnesty for suffragettes. During the war, Parker served in the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps and was awarded an OBE. After the war she lived in Arcachon, near Bordeaux, where she died in 1924. Parker left her Hunger Strike medal to her friend and fellow activist, Ethel Moorhead.  Legacy  In 2014, Victoria Bianchi wrote a play, CauseWay, based on Parker and Moorhead's attempt to blow up Burns Cottage 100 years previously. The play was performed at the Robert Burns Birthplace Museum in Alloway. In 2016, the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa purchased Parker's suffragette medal, the Women's Social and Political Union Medal for Valour, from an auction house in Scotland and will display it at the museum in Wellington. It is thought to be the only suffragette medal with a New Zealand connection. The Suffragette Handkerchief with Parker's embroidered signature and 67 suffragette names or initials can be seen at Priest House, West Hoathly, Sussex.

International email, by contrast, uses Unicode characters encoded as UTF-8 - allowing for the encoding the text of addresses in most of the world's writing systems.RFC 6530: Overview and Framework for Internationalized Email The following are all valid international email addresses: (Chinese, Unicode) अजय@डाटा.भारत (Hindi, Unicode) квіточка@пошта.укр (Ukrainian, Unicode) χρήστης@παράδειγμα.ελ (Greek, Unicode) Dörte@Sörensen.example.com (German, Unicode) коля@пример.рф (Russian, Unicode)  UTF-8 headers  Although the traditional format for email header section allows non-ASCII characters to be included in the value portion of some of the header fields using MIME-encoded words (e.g. in display names or in a Subject header field), MIME-encoding must not be used to encode other information in a header, such as an email address, or header fields like Message-ID or Received. Moreover, the MIME-encoding requires extra processing of the header to convert the data to and from its MIME-encoded word representation, and harms readability of a header section. The 2012 standards RFC 6532 and RFC 6531 allow the inclusion of Unicode characters in a header content using UTF-8 encoding, and their transmission via SMTP - but in practice support is only slowly rolling out.  Interoperability via downgrading  Domain internationalization works by downgrading. UTF-8 parts, known as U-Labels, are transformed into A-Labels via an ad-hoc method called IDNA. For example, \`Sörensen.example.com\` is encoded as \`xn--srensen-90a.example.com\`. In 2003, when the need was addressed, that seemed easier than checking that all DNS software could comply with UTF-8 strings, although in theory DNS can transport binary data. This encoding is needed before issuing DNS queries. Note that domain names are also, if not primarily, used for web navigation. EAI differs. Since traditional email standards constrain all email header values to ASCII only characters, it is possible that the presence of UTF-8 characters in email headers decreases the stability and reliability of transporting such email. This is because some email servers do not support these characters. Checking compliance with UTF-8 strings must be done software package by software package (see #Adoption below.) There was an experimental method proposed by the IETF, by which email could be somehow downgraded into the legacy all-ASCII format which all standard email servers support. This proposal was too cumbersome, because the meaning of the left hand side part of an email address is local to the target server. No way to check that \`xn--something\` isn't a valid user name, used in some domain. So that experiment has been obsoleted in 2012 by RFC 6530.  Standards framework  The set of Internet RFC documents RFC 6530, RFC 6531, RFC 6532, and RFC 6533, all of them published in February 2012, define mechanisms and protocol extensions needed to fully support internationalized email addresses. These changes include an SMTP extension and extension of email header syntax to accommodate UTF-8 data. The document set also includes discussion of key assumptions and issues in deploying fully internationalized email.  Adoption  * 2013-11-14: The Bat!

They contain the tombs and mosques built by the various kings of the Qutb Shahi dynasty. The galleries of the smaller tombs are of a single storey while the larger ones are two storied. In the centre of each tomb is a sarcophagus which overlies the actual burial vault in a crypt below. The domes were originally overlaid with blue and green tiles, of which only a few pieces now remain.Restoration of Quli Qutub Shahi tombs Location View of Qutb Shahi Tombs from the Golkonda fort They lie in the north of the outer perimeter wall of Golkonda Fort and its Banjara Darwaza (Gate of the Gypsies), amidst the Ibrahim Bagh. Description The tombs form a large cluster and stand on a raised platform. The tombs are domed structures built on a square base surrounded by pointed arches, a distinctive style that blends Persian and Indian forms. The tombs are structures with intricately carved stonework and are surrounded by landscaped gardens.Archaeology Dept. increases security at Qutb Shahi tombs The tombs were once furnished with carpets, chandeliers and velvet canopies on silver poles. Copies of the Quran were kept on pedestals and readers recited verses from the holy book at regular intervals. Golden spires were fitted over the tombs of the sultans to distinguish their tombs from those of other members of the royal family. History During the Qutb Shahi period, these tombs were held in great veneration. But after their reign, the tombs were neglected until Sir Salar Jung III ordered their restoration in the early 19th century. A garden was laid out, and a compound wall was built. Once again, the tomb-garden of the Qutb Shahi family became a place of serene beauty. All except the last of the Qutb Shahi sultans lie buried here. Sultan Quli Qutb Mulk's tomb, the style of which sets the example for the tombs of his descendants, is on an elevated terrace measuring 30 meters in each direction. The tomb chamber proper is octagonal, with each side measuring around 10 meters. The entire structure is crowned by a circular dome. There are three graves in this tomb chamber and twenty-one laid out on the surrounding terrace, all of which lack inscription except for the main tomb. The inscription on Sultan Quli's tomb is in three bands, in the Naskh and Tauq scripts. The inscription refers to Sultan Quli as Bade Malik (Great Master) -- the endearing term by which all people of the Deccan used for him. The tomb was built in 1543 A.D. by the Sultan, during his lifetime, as was the custom. Near the tomb of Sultan Quli is that of his son, Jamsheed, the second in the line of Qutb Shahi sultans. Built in 1550 A.D., this is the only Qutb Shahi tomb which has not been fashioned from shining black basalt. Its appearance, too, is quite unlike the other tombs in the garden -- it rises gracefully in two stories, unlike the squat tombs of the other kings. Jamsheed Quli Qutb Shah's is the only tomb of a Qutb Shahi ruler without any inscriptions; of course, Jamsheed's son, Subhan's tomb also does not have any inscriptions. Subhan Quli Qutb Shah ruled for a short time. Subhan's tomb stands midway between the tombs of his father and grandfather. He was popularly called Chhote Malik (Small Master). Sultan Ibrahim Quli Qutb Shah's tomb, built in 1580, after his death, is slightly larger than Sultan Quli's tomb. Traces of the enameled tiles, which once adorned this mausoleum, can still be seen on the southern wall. The tomb has two graves in the main chamber and 16 on the terrace; some of them probably are those of his six sons and three daughters. There are inscriptions in the Thuluth script on all faces of the sarcophagus. The three famous calligraphists -- Isphalan, Ismail and Taqiuddin Muhammad Salih -- who left a store of Naskh, Thuluth and Nastaliq inscriptions on the many Qutb Shahi edifices in the city, were contemporaries of Ibrahim Shah. Tomb of Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah Sultan Muhammed Quli Qutb Shah's mausoleum is considered the grandest of the Qutb Shahi tombs. Built in 1602 A.D., the tomb is on a terrace of 65m square and 4m high. A flight of steps leads to the mausoleum proper, which is 22 m square on the outside and 11 m square on the inside. There are entrances on the southern and eastern sides. The tomb is in a vault below the terrace. Inscriptions in Persian and the Naskh scripts decorate it. Another grand mausoleum is that of the sixth sultan, Muhammed Qutb Shah. The facade of this tomb was once decorated with enameled tiles; only traces are now evident. There are six graves and inscriptions in Thuluth and Naskh. The mausoleum was built in 1626. Sultan Abdullah Qutb Shah's tomb is the last of the royal tombs, as Abul Hasan Qutb Shah (Tana Shah), the last Qutb Shahi Sultan, was a prisoner in the fortress of Daulatabad, near Aurangabad, when he died. While the tombs of those who ruled dominate the area, interspersed are many other monuments, most of them tombs of other members of the royal family. The tomb of Fatima Sultan, with its bulbous dome, is near the entrance to the tomb-garden. Fatima was the sister of Muhammed Qutb Shah. Her tomb houses several graves, two with inscriptions. Immediately to the south of Muhammed Quli's tomb are three uninscribed tombs. There are the mausoleums of Kulthoom, Muhammed Qutb Shahi’s granddaughter born of the son of the sultan's favourite wife Khurshid Bibi, her (Kulthoom's) husband and daughter. Kulthoom's tomb is on the west of this cluster. The twin-tombs of the two favourite hakims (physicians) of Sultan Abdullah -- Nizamuddin Ahmed Gilani and Abdul Jabbar Gilani -- were built in 1651. They are among the few Qutb Shahi tombs that are not of royalty. Another pair are those of Premamati and Taramati, the favourite courtesans of Sultan Abdullah Shah, were laid to rest beside his tomb. One other tomb which is not that of a Qutb Shahi family member is that of Neknam Khan. Neknam Khan, who served in Abdullah's army, was the commander-in-chief of the Carnatic. His tomb is on a platform outside the mausoleum of Ibrahim Qutb Shah. It was built in 1672, two years after Nekam Khan's death. Archways at Qutb Shahi Tombs The last Sultan of the dynasty, Abul Hasan Qutb Shah (also known as Tana Shah) was not buried alongside his ancestor. Instead, he was buried at Khuldabad. The mausoleum which Abul Hasan, the last Qutb Shahi Sultan, began building for himself, actually houses the grave of Mir Ahmed, the son of Sultan Abdullah's son-in-law and the sister of Abbas II Safair, the Shah of Persia. The tomb of Fadma Khanum, one of Sultan Abdullah's daughters, stands near the mausoleum of her husband, Mir Ahmed. Hers is the only Qutb Shahi tomb not surmounted by a dome. To the west of the tombs lies the dargah of Hussain Shah Wali, the revered Sufi saint. He is most affectionately remembered by people as the builder of Hussain Sagar in 1562. Among other monuments in the garden that are not tombs, the most important are the mortuary bath and the Masjid of Hayat Bakshi Begum.The Great Mosque in the Qutb Shahi Tombs Complex The mortuary bath, which stands opposite the tomb of Muhammad Quli, was built by Sultan Quli to facilitate the ritual washing of the bodies of the dead kings and others of the royal family before they were carried to their final resting place. The practice followed was to bring the body out of the fort, through the Banjara Gate, to this bath, before carrying it away for burial with the ritualistic pomp that was required to mark the occasion. A large number of people, fond subjects, friends and relatives attended. The bath is one of the finest existing specimens of ancient Persian or Turkish baths. The Qutb Shahis built a number of masjids all over Golkonda and Hyderabad, and almost every tomb has a masjid adjacent. The biggest and the grandest such masjid is by the mausoleum of Hayat Bakshi Begum. Popularly known as the great masjid of the Golkonda tombs, it was built in 1666 A.D. Fifteen cupolas decorate the roof and the prayer-hall is flanked by two lofty minarets. The impression, as a whole, is one of majesty and splendour. The inscriptions in the masjid are in calligraphic art. Hayat Bakshi Begum was the daughter of Muhammed Quli Qutb Shah, the fifth sultan, the wife of Sultan Muhammed Qutb Shah, the sixth sultan and the mother of Abdullah Qutb Shah, the seventh sultan. She was affectionately known as \\"Ma Saheba\\" (Revered Mother). The tomb-garden of the sultans of Golkonda was known as \\"Lagar-e-Faiz Athar\\" (a place for bountiful entertainment) in the days of the Qutb Shahi rulers, for some item or song or dance or even an occasional play was staged here every evening, free of cost, to entertain the poor.  Restoration  The tombs were restored by the Telangana State Archaeology and Museums Department in collaboration with the Aga Khan Trust for Culture. The restoration work started in 2013 and was unveiled by the U.S. Ambassador to India on March 10, 2020. While the restoration work was paused due to the Covid-19 pandemic, work has now continued at a slower rate.

The station was just to the west of the summit of the line, which was also the highest point on the entire Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) system. History The LYR branch line from to had opened for goods on 5 October 1870, and to passengers on 1 November 1870. On 18 July 1872 the LYR was authorised to extend the line to . There were to be two intermediate stations: one was at ; the other, from Rochdale, was named Britannia after a nearby public house, the Britannia Inn, which was built in 1821 at the junction of the old and new roads from Bacup. The station was built by Samuel Warburton, who was contracted for the work on 28 July 1880; it had an island platform. The line opened on 1 December 1881, and with it, Britannia station. The station was situated above sea level, and just to the east of the station was the summit of the line, which at above sea level was also the highest point on the entire LYR system. To the west of the station was a skew arch bridge built to carry the Lee Moor Colliery tramway over the railway line. On 29 August 1891 a goods train of 24 wagons carrying stone from Britannia ran away on the falling gradient of 1 in 34 (3%) and collided with a passenger train at Facit station. Three passengers died and six were injured. In 1940 a passenger train became stuck in snow for five days at Britannia. The station closed on 2 April 1917 as an economy measure, although passenger services on the line continued until 16 June 1947. Goods traffic between Facit and Bacup ceased around the same time, but the line was not lifted until at least August 1963.

As of 1993, there were an estimated 80,000 Ngizim. The tribe lives primarily in Potiskum, the largest city in Yobe State and originally a Ngizim town, as well as the areas to the east and south of the city. Ngizim populations once inhabited parts of Borno and Jigawa states, but have since lost their cultural identity after being assimilated into other ethnic groups. The Ngizim speak a Chadic language also called Ngizim. History Before the Fulani Jihad of 1804, the history of the Ngizim people was closely linked with that of the Bornu Empire. By 1472, when the capital of the Bornu Empire, Birni Ngazargamu, was established, the Ngizim had gained a reputation as formidable warriors. As they consolidated their influence over parts of modern-day Yobe State, their cultural capital Potiskum became a regional center. During the early part of the 20th century, the Ngizim rebelled against the Fika Emirate, which had been given political control over them by the colonial authorities. The local British district officer lead forces against the Ngizim; Mai Agudum, the rebel leader, was later executed. The Ngizim emirate was not restored until 1993 when Mai Muhammadu Atiyaye was appointed by the state governor. The current Ngizim leader, Mai Umaru Bubaram Ibn Wuriwa Bauya was recently upgraded to the status of a first-class Emir by former Governor Bukar Abba Ibrahim. In his notes on the \\"History of the first twelve years of the reign of Mai Idris Alooma (1571–1583) by Imam Ahmad Ibn Furtua\\", H. R. Palmer informs us about the word Ngizim. \\"There are various forms of this name which though they are distinguished seem to denote the same people — N'gizim, N'gujam, N'gazar, N'Kazzar, N'gissam\\". In another part of the notes, he tells us that Birni N'gazargamu was founded by Mai Ali Ghaji Dunamani in about 1462, who acquired the site from the \\"So\\" who lived in the region. \\"The name of the capital is correctly spelled as N'gazargamu or N'gasarkumu. The first part of the word signifies that the previous inhabitants of the region where N'gazar or N'gizim. The later part of the word \\"Gamu\\" or \\"Kumu\\" is the same as the first part of the word \\"Gwombe\\" and means either (i) chief or King or (ii) ancestral spirit.\\" Going by the scattered references to the N'gizim one would at best only guess the extent of their spread in the Western Sudan. There is reference to N'gizim and then the tribe of N'gizim in the west of the empire known as the Binawa. Binawa is also known as Mabani who extended from Bursari region west of Birni Gazargamu to Katagum. Early Kanem-Bornu history There are various references to Ngizim people in Kanem-Bornu history as early as the days of the Kanem civil wars in 1396. It can be said that the Ngizim people have played a considerable role in moving the capital of the empire from Njimi to N'gazargamu. Quoting H. R. Palmer: From another source, we find a reference to the Ngizim being one of the earliest groups to migrate from Kanem: Language Ngizim is one of five Chadic languages indigenous to Yobe State, the others being Bade, Bole, Karekare, and Ngamo. Ngizim is a member of the West Branch of Chadic and is hence related to Hausa, the dominant language throughout northern Nigeria. Ngizim's closest linguistic relatives are Bade, spoken north of Potiskum in Bade (Bedde) Emirate, and Duwai, spoken east of Gashua. Unlike some of the other languages in Yobe State, Ngizim has very little dialect variation.ref name=\\"humnet\\" /> Traditional leaders The traditional ruler of the Ngizim people is the Mai Potiskum, whose stool is located in Potiskum. Like most traditional rulers in northern Nigeria, Mai Potiskum is also the foremost Islamic leader among his people. Potiskum town Concerning their more recent history, during the period of the Fulani Jihad specifically in 1808, a group of N'gizim under the leadership of Bauya left Mugni as a result of an attack on Birni N'gazargamu by the Fulani Jihadi terrorists. They took a south course to the Kaisala area. On arrival, Bauya and his group helped the inhabitants of Kaisala repulse an attack on them by the N'gazar (branch of Ngizim) of Daura (Dawura). After a counter-attack on Daura and its conquest, Bauya founded his own section of settlement and called it \\"Pataskum\\" which was corrupted by Europeans to \\"Potiskum\\". The word \\"Pataskum\\" is an Ngizim phrase meaning forest of \\"Skum\\" trees. \\"Pata\\" meaning forest in the Ngizim language and \\"Skum\\" is a type of tree found abundantly in the area at the time of founding Potiskum town.

Clutter is an OpenGL-based 'interactive canvas' library and does not contain any graphical control elements. It relies upon OpenGL (1.4+) or OpenGL ES (1.1 or 2.0) for rendering,. It also supports media playback using GStreamer and 2D graphics rendering using Cairo.http://developer.gnome.org/clutter/stable/ClutterCairoTexture.html Clutter API Reference: ClutterCairoTexture Clutter was authored by OpenedHand Ltd, now part of Intel. Clutter is free and open-source software, subject to the requirements of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), version 2.1.  Adoption  Popular programs that adopt Clutter are GNOME Videos (a.k.a. Totem), GNOME Shell, Pitivi, Cinnamon Desktop and GNOME Ease. Mx is a widget toolkit based on Clutter originally designed for the graphical shell of Moblin/MeeGo netbook, but evolved into an independent project. The widget toolkits Netbook Toolkit (nbtk) and Mx are based on Clutter. Often Clutter is seen analogous to GTK+ but this is inaccurate. Only Clutter together with Mx or Nbtk can match the extent of the GTK+. This is also the reason why Clutter is used together with GTK+. Clutter supports multi-touch gestures. * Clayland is a Wayland compositor utilizing Clutter. * Snappy is a lightweight media player based on Clutter and GStreamer. * Pinpoint is a simple light-weight presentation program. * GNOME Maps uses ClutterActor * Proof of concept casual video games PillPopper (a Pac-Man clone) and HappyWombats (an Angry Birds clone) use Clutter. GTK+ Scene Graph Kit (GSK) was initially released as part of GTK+ 3.90 in March 2017 and is meant for GTK-based applications that wish to replace Clutter for their UI. Software architecture GDK contains back- ends to X11, Wayland, Broadway (HTTP), Quartz and GDI and relies on Cairo for the rendering. Its new SceneGraph (GSK) is work-in-progress, Clutter's SceneGraph can be used. Example of Clutter usage in Linux-based systems Clutter is a scene graph-based canvas working in retained mode. Every object on the scene is usually a 2D surface inside a 3D space. Clutter abstracts the native windowing environment behind a backend, which is also responsible for creating the main container for the scene graph; this top level container is called the stage. Items on the stage are called actors. Instead of operating on matrices, as does OpenGL, the Clutter developer changes properties of each actor. Clutter will then notice the changes, and render the scene accordingly. Clutter is currently being developed by OpenedHand to provide visually rich graphical user interfaces on desktop and embedded hardware. The main target are media center-like applications, small devices UIs and base drawing API for GL- and GL/ES-based UI toolkits. Clutter uses Pango for text rendering (with a special GL/GLES renderer) and GdkPixbuf for loading images into GL textures. Interaction with other GNOME platform libraries is done through multiple integration libraries, e.g.: clutter-gst (GStreamer), clutter-gtk (for embedding the stage into a GTK+ application), clutter-cairo (for using cairo to draw into a texture). It's API and ABI are kept stable within micro releases, but can break API during minor releases—until it reaches 1.0, then it will be API and ABI stable until the following major release.  ClutterActor  ClutterActor is the basic element of Clutter's scene graph, it encapsulates the position, size, and transformations of a node in the graph. * A ClutterActor can receive and handle input device events, for instance pointer events and key events. * Animation is a core concept of modern user interfaces; Clutter provides a complete and powerful animation framework that automatically tweens the actor's state without requiring direct, frame by frame manipulation from your application code.  Supported platforms  Clutter is developed for the X Window System using GLX as well as Wayland using EGL. Clutter can also use the framebuffer. As of release 0.6, native support for Mac OS X has been added.http://blogs.gnome.org/tko/2008/05/26/three-steps-forward-one-giant- step-back/ Life with Clutter on OSX A native Microsoft Windows backend is supported since the 0.8 release and Windows pre-compiled DLLs are available, however, it is possible to build the latest DLL for Windows with MinGW and Bash shell for Windows. Since version 1.19.4 from June 2014, Clutter's evdev input backend depends on libinput 0.4.0. Programming language bindings Clutter is implemented using the C programming language with a design based on the GObject object system. Bindings are available for these languages: *C++ ( cluttermm) *Perl (perl-Clutter) *Python (PyClutter) *Haskell () *JavaScript (Seed and GJS) *C# (clutter-sharp (aka Clutter#)) ? *Ruby () ? *Vala (clutter- vala) ?  Integration libraries  Clutter can be integrated with other libraries and toolkits, for instance: * GTK+ applications can embed Clutter stages using a special widget. * Clutter applications can embed GTK+ widgets using the 'client-side windows' feature since GTK+ 2.18.http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce- list/2009-September/msg00099.html GNOME Mailing Lists: GTK+ 2.18.0 released * Clutter applications can use GStreamer to play videos directly into a Clutter texture actor. * Clutter applications can use Cairo to draw onto a texture. * Video Acceleration API  Example  This example will add a label on the stage (written in C). // Retrieve the default stage, which will contain all the actors on the scene. ClutterActor *stage = clutter_stage_get_default (); // Create a new label, using the Sans font 32 pixels high, and with the \\"Hello, world\\" text, // and will place it into the stage. ClutterActor *label = clutter_text_new_with_text (\\"Sans 32px\\", \\"Hello, world\\"); clutter_container_add_actor (CLUTTER_CONTAINER (stage), label); // Position the label at the center of the stage, taking into account the stage and the label size. float x = (clutter_actor_get_width (stage) - clutter_actor_get_width (label)) / 2; float y = (clutter_actor_get_height (stage) - clutter_actor_get_height (label)) / 2; clutter_actor_set_position (label, x, y); // Show the stage. All actors in Clutter are visible unless explicitly hidden, except for the stage; // thus showing the stage will // automatically display all of its visible children. clutter_actor_show (stage);  Interface builder  Clutter can build user interfaces using a specialized JSON dialect.http://www.clutter- project.org/docs/clutter/stable/ClutterScript.html#ClutterScript.description Clutter API Reference: ClutterScript The entire scene graph is defined using JSON types and built at run time through the ClutterScript class. = Example = This definition will create the main window and place a label with the text Hello, world! inside it. { \\"id\\": \\"main-stage\\", \\"type\\": \\"ClutterStage\\", \\"color\\": \\"white\\", \\"width\\": 800, \\"height\\": 600, \\"title\\": \\"Script demo\\", \\"children\\": [{ \\"id\\": \\"hello-label\\", \\"type\\": \\"ClutterText\\", \\"x\\": 400, \\"y\\": 300, \\"text\\": \\"Hello, world!\\", \\"color\\": \\"black\\", \\"font-name\\": \\"Sans 48px\\" }], \\"signals\\": [{ \\"name\\": \\"destroy\\", \\"handler\\": \\"clutter_main_quit\\" }] } The definition can be saved into a file or as a string, and loaded using: ClutterScript *script = clutter_script_new (); GError *error = NULL; clutter_script_load_from_data (script, description, -1, &error;); if (error) { g_warning (\\"Unable to load UI description: %s\\", error->message); g_error_free (error); } else { GObject *stage; clutter_script_connect_signals (script, NULL); /* connect the signal handlers */ stage = clutter_script_get_object (script, \\"main-stage\\"); /* get the \\"main-stage\\" object */ clutter_actor_show (CLUTTER_ACTOR (stage)); }  Animation  Clutter allows implicit animations of every item on the canvas using special objects called behaviours: each behaviour can be applied to multiple actors, and multiple behaviours can be composed on the same actor. Behaviours handle animations implicitly: the developer specifies the initial and final states, the time (or number of frames) needed to complete the animation, the function of time to be used (linear, sine wave, exponential, etc.), and the behaviour will take care of the tweening. Clutter provides a generic base class for developers to implement custom behaviours, and various simple classes handling simple properties, like opacity, position on the Z axis (depth), position along a path, rotation, etc. Since Clutter 1.0, it is also possible to create simple, one-off animations using the ClutterAnimation class and the clutter_actor_animate() convenience function. The clutter_actor_animate() function animates an actor properties between their current state and the specified final state. = Example = This example will scale the label from its size to a factor of 2 in 2 seconds, using a linear function of time and behaviours: ClutterTimeline *timeline = clutter_timeline_new (2000); ClutterAlpha *alpha = clutter_alpha_new_full (timeline, CLUTTER_LINEAR); ClutterBehaviour *behaviour = clutter_behaviour_scale_new (alpha, 1.0, 1.0, /* initial scaling factors */ 2.0, 2.0 /* final scaling factors */ ); clutter_behaviour_apply (behaviour, label); :These statements will create a timeline with a duration of 2 seconds; an alpha, binding the timeline to a linear easing mode; a behaviour, which will scale any actor to which it is applied between factor 1.0 and factor 2.0 (both horizontally and vertically). Finally, it applies the behaviour to an actor. The equivalent code using the implicit animations API is: clutter_actor_animate (label, /* the actor to animate */ CLUTTER_LINEAR, /* the easing mode */ 2000, /* the duration of the animation */ \\"scale-x\\", 2.0, /* final horizontal scaling factor */ \\"scale-y\\", 2.0, /* final vertical scaling factor */ NULL); :This statement will create an implicit ClutterAnimation object, which will animate the provided GObject properties between their current value and the specified final value.  COGL  Cogl is a small open source software library for using 3D graphics hardware to draw pretty pictures. The API departs from the flat state machine style of OpenGL and is designed to make it easy to write orthogonal components that can render without stepping on each other's toes. Cogl currently supports OpenGL ES 1.1/2.0 and OpenGL > 1.3 (or 1.2 if you have the GL_ARB_multitexture extension), and having Gallium3D or D3D back-ends are options for the future.  libchamplain  libchamplain is a C library providing a ClutterActor to display maps.

Computer-aided design also known as CAD was the first type of program to help architectures but since it did not have all the features, Computer-aided architectural engineering created as a specific software with all the tools for design. Overview All CAAD and CAAE systems use a set of data with geometric and other aspects of an abject; they all use information technology to assembling design from standard or non-standard pieces. For example software like computer animation is what is made in CAAE field. All the blue prints around us is made by CAAE or CAAD software. Degree Getting a degree in computer-aided architectural engineering can qualify one for higher-level positions. This specialization is for students interested in having careers in architectural engineering and drafting.a CAAE can have jobs in many areas such as Expeditor, Construction Estimator, Project Manager, project architecture and many other fields related to these. Advantages An advantages to CAAE is to develop the two-way mapping software of subject. The two dimension mapping are set to be between the surface structure (TM1) and the deep structure (TM2). In designing the systems, system designers usually pay attention to TM1. The important statement here is a one-to-one mapping, which is to create a computer functionality that maps as close as possible into a resulted manual design project. An engineer's works mostly involves visually observe data and represent them. Problems are usually outlined and dealt with in graphical result. Therefore, the designer should have a lot control over the processes happens within the design.

The two distinctive high gables make 33–35 Eastcheap instantly recognisable as \\"one of the maddest displays in London of Victorian Gothic\\" Robert Lewis Roumieu (1814 – 1877) otherwise R.L. Roumieu, was a 19th-century English architect whose designs include Milner Square in Islington and an idiosyncratic vinegar warehouse at 33–35 Eastcheap in the City of London. A pupil of Benjamin Dean Wyatt, he worked in partnership with Alexander Dick Gough between 1836 and 1848. Life and career Roumieu was of Huguenot descent and his middle name is occasionally spelled \\"Louis\\". The Roumieu family originated from Languedoc, and the name has been listed among those of Huguenot refugees who settled in Great Britain and Ireland during the reign of Louis XIV (1643–1714). Roumieu's father John was a solicitor, while his grandfather Abraham Roumieu (1734–1780) had been an architect. Roumieu was articled to the architect Benjamin Dean Wyatt in 1831. In 1836 he went into partnership with another pupil of Wyatt, Alexander Dick Gough. Together they completed some notable projects in what are now the London Boroughs of Camden and Islington, including Milner Square and the Islington Literary and Philosophical Institute (now the Almeida Theatre), a stuccoed classical work of 1837. The partnership was dissolved in 1848. On 15 December 1845 Roumieu was elected a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects (FRIBA), having been proposed by HL Keys, EM Foxhall, and HE Kendall.All three of Roumieu's proposers had become Fellows of the Institute a year after its foundation, in 1835. Henry Lant Keys was born in 1800 or 1801. Edward Martin Foxhall (1733–1862), was a District Surveyor of St George's Hanover Square and had been articled to Sir John Soane. The identity of Henry Edward Kendall is problematic, for there are two identically named, father and son. H E Kendall (1776–1875) was from 1823, District Surveyor for St Martin in the Fields. His son, Henry Edward Kendall Jr. (1805–55) received his FRIBA in 1842. It seems likely that the Kendall who proposed Roumieu was Kendall Sr. As a possible former pupil of John Nash he may have carried some weight, and he had also proposed Foxhall as a Fellow. For 22 years Roumieu's address was 10 Lancaster Place, Strand, London (1845–77). Prior to that he was at 8 Regent's Square, St Pancras, London (1845) and after that period at 7 St George's Terrace, Regent's Park, London, until his death in 1877. Works=Milner Square, Islington Roumieu and Gough's Milner Square, Islington, has been taken as \\"an early example of his [Roumieu's] talent for strangeness and distortion.\\" 33–35 Eastcheap In 1868 Roumieu designed 33–35 Eastcheap in the City of London as a vinegar warehouse for Hill & Evans at a cost of £8,170. It has been seen as \\"crazy and dazzling\\" and as one of the City of London's most original commercial façades. Ian Nairn characterised it as \\"truly demoniac, an Edgar Allan Poe of a building\\", arguing that it should be preserved \\"not as an oddity, but as a basic part of human temperament, and one which doesn't often get translated into architecture\\". Stamp and Amery praise the originality with which \\"the high gables broke through the standard cornice line and the confident canopies gave tremendous vigour to the façade. Describing it as \\"the City's masterpiece of polychromatic Gothic self-advertisement\\", Pevsner notes its > Red brick with blue brick bands...dressed in Tisbury stone with Devonshire > marble columns, all organized into a frenzy of sharp gables, a shaft resting > on top of a gable, others starting on corbels. Strictly symmetrical...twin > three-bay outer sections narrow as they rise, exposing a recessed centre > with a dormer in the steep roof.\\" The roofline is accentuated with iron foliage finials. Above the two lights of the central Gothic window Roumieu placed an animal carving in a medallion, depicting a wild boar peeping out from long grass. This alludes to the celebrated Boar's Head tavern in Eastcheap which features in Shakespeare's Henry IV plays as the scene of drunken revelry between Young Prince Hal and Falstaff. Rebuilt after the Great Fire of London, the old Board's Head stood on the site until 1831. (Henry C. Shelley, Inns and Taverns of Old London, Boston, L.C. Page, 1909, p.21.)

Roumieu was also surveyor to the Gas, Light and Coke Company's Estate at Beckton, the French Hospital Estate, St Luke's, and several other estates in and near London.Ibid. Family=Reginald St Aubyn Roumieu Roumieu's son, Reginald St Aubyn Roumieu (1854–1921) had an architectural practice with Alfred Aitchison at his father's premises of 10 Lancaster Place, near the Strand. Roumieu and Aitchison completed R.L. Roumieu's Crosse & Blackwell warehouse designs for Charing Cross Road, following his demise in 1877, and then undertook further commissions for the firm in the same area. His daughter Emillie Isabel married and divorced Alexander C Wylie who went on to marry twice more, becoming the father of author I. A. R. Wylie with his 2nd (Australian) wife. Reginald St Aubyn Roumieu reflected the family's origins in becoming President of the Huguenot Society in London. In this capacity, he unveiled a memorial in 1911 to Wandsworth Huguenots. He maintained his father's association with the French Hospital, as seen by an inscribed bowl presented to him by its directors on 13 January 1921. It was sold in 2007 by the auction firm Bonhams in Edinburgh for £2,500. Derby connection The Roumieu family appear to have owned land in Derby which was eventually bought from them for council housing.

Built in 1888, it is a prominent local example of Queen Anne architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 4, 1986. Description and history The Amos Adams House stands in a large residential area roughly midway between the villages of Newton Corner and Newton Centre, on the west side of Park Avenue near its junction with Green Park. It is a 2-1/2 story structure, with a tall hip roof and clapboarded exterior. It has asymmetrical massing typical of the style, as well as a variety of projecting gables and porches, an octagonal tower, and tall paneled-brick chimneys. The front facade is divided into roughly three sections, with the tower on the right, a central single-story entry porch with turned posts and balustrade above, and a rectangular projecting section on the left that increases in size to a third-level gable with Stick style woodwork in the gable top and a small balcony on the third level. A small gable section projects above the entrance porch, and a small hip-roof dormer is found in the tall roof above that. Gable ends are typically clad in decorative shingles, and there are paneled sections below windows of the turret and the left projection. The house was built in 1888, on land that had previously been part of the large estate of Albert Brackett, a prominent local coal and lumber dealer. Brackett sold off portions of his estate in response to increasing development pressures. The house was built for Amos Adams, a businessman who commuted to Boston, a common occurrence in residents of this area.

It is 'the area of study, research and practice that places a priority on improving mental health and achieving equity in mental health for all people worldwide'. There is a growing body of criticism of the global mental health movement, and has been widely criticised as a neo-colonial or \\"missionary\\" project and as primarily a front for pharmaceutical companies seeking new clients for psychiatric drugs.Movement for Global Mental Health Newsletter. May 2014. In theory, taking into account cultural differences and country-specific conditions, it deals with the epidemiology of mental disorders in different countries, their treatment options, mental health education, political and financial aspects, the structure of mental health care systems, human resources in mental health, and human rights issues among others. The overall aim of the field of global mental health is to strengthen mental health all over the world by providing information about the mental health situation in all countries, and identifying mental health care needs in order to develop cost-effective interventions to meet those specific needs.  The global burden of disease  Disability-adjusted life year for neuropsychiatric conditions per 100,000 inhabitants in 2002. Mental, neurological, and substance use disorders make a substantial contribution to the global burden of disease (GBD).World Health Organization. Global burden of disease. Geneva, WHO Health statistics and health information systems. Accessed 15 March 2011. This is a global measure of so-called disability- adjusted life years (DALY's) assigned to a certain disease/disorder, which is a sum of the years lived with disability and years of life lost due to this disease within the total population. Neuropsychiatric conditions account for 14% of the global burden of disease. Among non-communicable diseases, they account for 28% of the DALY's – more than cardiovascular disease or cancer. However, it is estimated that the real contribution of mental disorders to the global burden of disease is even higher, due to the complex interactions and co-morbidity of physical and mental illness. Around the world, almost one million people die due to suicide every year, and it is the third leading cause of death among young people. The most important causes of disability due to health-related conditions worldwide include unipolar depression, alcoholism, schizophrenia, bipolar depression and dementia. In low- and middle-income countries, these conditions represent a total of 19.1% of all disability related to health conditions.World Health Organization: Mental Health and Development: Targeting People with Mental Health Conditions as Vulnerable Group. Accessed 15 March 2011.  Treatment gap  It is estimated that one in four people in the world will be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives.World Health Organization: Mental disorders affect one in four people. Accessed 15 March 2011. Although many effective interventions for the treatment of mental disorders are known, and awareness of the need for treatment of people with mental disorders has risen, the proportion of those who need mental health care but who do not receive it remains very high. This so-called \\"treatment gap\\" is estimated to reach between 76–85% for low- and middle-income countries, and 35–50% for high-income countries. Despite the acknowledged need, for the most part there have not been substantial changes in mental health care delivery during the past years. Main reasons for this problem are public health priorities, lack of a mental health policy and legislation in many countries, a lack of resources – financial and human resources – as well as inefficient resource allocation. In 2011, the World Health Organization estimated a shortage of 1.18 million mental health professionals, including 55,000 psychiatrists, 628,000 nurses in mental health settings, and 493,000 psychosocial care providers needed to treat mental disorders in 144 low- and middle-income countries. The annual wage bill to remove this health workforce shortage was estimated at about US$4.4 billion.Scheffler RM et al. (2011). Human resources for mental health: workforce shortages in low- and middle-income countries. Geneva, World Health Organization Press.  Interventions  Information and evidence about cost-effective interventions to provide better mental health care are available. Although most of the research (80%) has been carried out in high-income countries, there is also strong evidence from low- and middle- income countries that pharmacological and psychosocial interventions are effective ways to treat mental disorders, with the strongest evidence for depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and hazardous alcohol use. Recommendations to strengthen mental health systems around the world have been first mentioned in the WHO's World Health Report 2001,World Health Organization. (2001) The world health report 2001 – Mental Health: New Understanding, New Hope. Geneva, WHO Press. which focused on mental health: # Provide treatment in primary care # Make psychotropic drugs available # Give care in the community # Educate the public # Involve communities, families and consumers # Establish national policies, programs and legislation # Develop human resources # Link with other sectors # Monitor community mental health # Support more research Based on the data of 12 countries, assessed by the WHO Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems (WHO-AIMS),World Health Organization: Instrument for Mental Health Systems. Accessed 15 March 2011. the costs of scaling up mental health services by providing a core treatment package for schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, depressive episodes and hazardous alcohol use have been estimated. Structural changes in mental health systems according to the WHO recommendations have been taken into account. For most countries, this model suggests an initial period of investment of US$0.30 – 0.50 per person per year. The total expenditure on mental health would have to rise at least ten-fold in low-income countries. In those countries, additional financial resources will be needed, while in middle- and high- income countries the main challenge will be the reallocation of resources within the health system to provide better mental health service. Prevention Prevention is beginning to appear in mental health strategies, including the 2004 WHO report \\"Prevention of Mental Disorders\\", the 2008 EU \\"Pact for Mental Health\\" and the 2011 US National Prevention Strategy. NIMH or the National Institute of Mental Health has over 400 grants. Stakeholders= World Health Organization (WHO)  Two of WHO's core programmes for mental health are WHO MIND (Mental health improvements for Nations Development) and Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP). WHO MIND focuses on 5 areas of action to ensure concrete changes in people's daily lives. These are: # Action in and support to countries to improve mental health, such as the WHO Pacific Island Mental Health network (PIMHnet) # Mental health policy, planning and service development # Mental health human rights and legislation # Mental health as a core part of human development # The QualityRights Project which works to unite and empower people to improve the quality of care and promote human rights in mental health facilities and social care homes. Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) is WHO’s action plan to scale up services for mental, neurological and substance use disorders for countries especially with low and lower middle incomes. The aim of mhGAP is to build partnerships for collective action and to reinforce the commitment of governments, international organizations and other stakeholders. The mhGAP Intervention Guide (mhGAP-IG) was launched in October 2010. It is a technical tool for the management of mental, neurological and substance use disorders in non-specialist health settings. The priority conditions included are: depression, psychosis, bipolar disorders, epilepsy, developmental and behavioural disorders in children and adolescents, dementia, alcohol use disorders, drug use disorders, self-harm/suicide and other significant emotional or medically unexplained complaints.  Criticism  One of the most prominent critics of the Movement for Global Mental Health has been China Mills, author of the book Decolonizing Global Mental Health: The Psychiatrization of the Majority World. Mills writes that:Mills, China. Decolonizing Global Mental Health: The Psychiatrization of the Majority World.

A substellar object, sometimes called a substar, is an astronomical object whose mass is smaller than the smallest mass at which hydrogen fusion can be sustained (approximately 0.08 solar masses). This definition includes brown dwarfs and former stars similar to EF Eridani B, and can also include objects of planetary mass, regardless of their formation mechanism and whether or not they are associated with a primary star.§3, What Is a Planet?, Steven Soter, Astronomical Journal, 132, #6 (December 2006), pp. 2513–2519.Chabrier and Baraffe, pp. 337–338Alula Australis , Jim Kaler, in Stars, a collection of web pages.

Barrado Y Navascués, J. A. Caballero, and M. Morales-Calderón, Astronomy and Astrophysics 460, #3 (December 2006), pp. 799–810. Assuming that a substellar object has a composition similar to the Sun's and at least the mass of Jupiter (approximately 10−3 solar masses), its radius will be comparable to that of Jupiter (approximately 0.1 solar radii) regardless of the mass of the substellar object (brown dwarfs are less than 75 Jupiter masses). This is because the center of such a substellar object at the top range of the mass (just below the hydrogen-burning limit) is quite degenerate, with a density of ≈103 g/cm3, but this degeneracy lessens with decreasing mass until, at the mass of Jupiter, a substellar object has a central density less than 10 g/cm3. The density decrease balances the mass decrease, keeping the radius approximately constant.Chabrier and Baraffe, §2.1.1, 3.1, Figure 3 Substellar objects like brown dwarfs do not have enough mass to fuse hydrogen and helium, hence do not undergo the usual stellar evolution that limits the lifetime of stars. A substellar object with a mass just below the hydrogen-fusing limit may ignite hydrogen fusion temporarily at its center. Although this will provide some energy, it will not be enough to overcome the object's ongoing gravitational contraction. Likewise, although an object with mass above approximately 0.013 solar masses will be able to fuse deuterium for a time, this source of energy will be exhausted in approximately 106 to 108 years. Apart from these sources, the radiation of an isolated substellar object comes only from the release of its gravitational potential energy, which causes it to gradually cool and shrink. A substellar object in orbit about a star will shrink more slowly as it is kept warm by the star, evolving towards an equilibrium state where it emits as much energy as it receives from the star.Chabrier and Baraffe, §4.1, Figures 6–8 Substellar objects are cool enough to have water vapor in their atmosphere. Infrared spectroscopy can detect the distinctive color of water in gas giant size substellar objects, even if they are not in orbit about a star. Classification William Duncan MacMillan proposed in 1918 the classification of substellar objects into three categories based on their density and phase state: solid, transitional and dark (non-stellar) gaseous. Solid objects include Earth, smaller terrestrial planets and moons; with Uranus and Neptune (as well as later mini-Neptune and Super Earth planets) as transitional objects between solid and gaseous. Saturn, Jupiter and large gas giant planets are in a fully \\"gaseous\\" state.

The cartridge is closely related to the .308 Norma Magnum. Both calibers share the same dimensions of the case head as the .300 H&H; Magnum, but have far less body taper, resulting in the same internal capacity in a shorter case.Kvale, Nils; Kulor, krut och älgar. Norma, Åmotfors, 1963. The cartridge case is the longest that will comfortably fit in a standard Mauser action, or any rifle action designed to chamber the 30-06. The .358 NM was the first .35 caliber cartridge commercially developed and sold to the American market since the decline of the .35 Newton in the late 1920s. Uses Though introduced by a Swedish company, the .358 Norma Magnum was designed for American hunters, due to Norma's chief designer Nils Kvale's close contacts with American colleagues. It is intended as a cartridge for the largest of North American game - elk, moose, brown bear, Bighorn Sheep, and bison, and shoots fast and flat enough to be useful to 400 to 500 yards on game the size of American elk (Wapiti). While it is needlessly powerful for deer-sized game, it can be used, at least with the heavier (and therefore slower) .358 bullets on such game without destroying too much meat. It would work well, with properly designed bullets, on most large African species. But laws prohibiting the use of bullets smaller than on dangerous game, in most African countries, limit its use to \\"plains game,\\" including the largest antelope, the one-ton eland. Norma took a gamble, introducing the .358 only as new empty cases for handloaders, and chambering-reamer specifications for gunsmiths who made custom rifles—there were no factory rifles available, and it was several months before factory-loaded ammunition appeared. The cartridge proved immediately popular with hunters and custom gunsmiths, and within a year the Danish firm of Schultz & Larsen chambered its Model 65 for the round, and Husqvarna its Series 1600 and 1650 rifles. The .358 Norma is what is known as a \\"short magnum,\\" designed to work in long rifle actions; many 30-06 rifles such as the 1903 Springfield rifle have been rebarreled to the much-more powerful .358 Norma. Norma's factory ammunition for the .358 Norma drives a 250-grain bullet at 2880 fps and produces more than 4,600 ft-lbs (foot-pounds) of kinetic energy at the muzzle, while delivering a foot-ton of energy 500 yards downrange.

CL6282 It has been distributed on VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD. Plot A stranger in town meets pretty young Susan Martinez De La Cruz and accompanies her to a barbecue, where wealthy Jason Carberry is saying a few words for the recently departed Robin Randall, a citizen who got shot. Jason objects to the stranger's presence, being Susan's guardian and protective of her. He challenges him to a shootout, but the stranger pulls his pistol before Jason's can even clear the holster. Calaveras Kate, a saloon singer who's in love with Jason, is relieved when the stranger declines to pull the trigger. Rafael Moreno suddenly rides into town and picks a fight with the stranger. Their brawl continues until the arrival of Judge Wallace Wintrop and his niece, Sheila, who have come to town from back East and deplore all this random violence out West. The stranger is recognized as Reb Randall, the dead man's brother. He is looking for the killer, who could be Rafael, or could be Jason, or could even be Billy Buckett, the coward of the county. The women hold their breath to see if the men they love will survive.

Both the common name and the scientific name are based on the shape of the shell, which is long, narrow and curved, resembling the shape of a donkey's ear.  Shell description  The maximum shell length of this species is up to 12 cm, but it more commonly grows up to about 9 cm. The shell of Haliotis asinina has a distinctly elongated contour, in clear resemblance to a donkey ear, hence the common name. Its outer surface is smooth and almost totally covered by the mantle in life, making encrustations of other animals (such as barnacles) quite uncommon in comparison to other abalones. The shell of H. asinina presents 5 to 7 ovate open holes on the left side of the body whorl. These holes collectively make up what is known as the selenizone which form as the shell grows. Its spire is somewhat conspicuous, with a mostly posterior apex. The color may variate between green olive or brown externally, with distinct roughly triangular patches. As is the case in many other abalones, the interior surface of the shell is strongly iridescent, with shades of pink and green.  Distribution  This is an Indo-West Pacific species (Eastern Indian Ocean to the Central Pacific). It is common in the Andaman Islands and Nicobar Islands, Pacific islands, southern Japan and Australia (Northern Territory, Queensland, Western Australia).Poutiers, J. M. (1998). Gastropods in: FAO Species Identification Guide for Fishery Purposes: The living marine resources of the Western Central Pacific Volume 1. Seaweeds, corals, bivalves and gastropods. Rome, FAO, 1998. page 385.  Ecology = Habitat  This abalone dwells in shallow water coral reef areas of the intertidal and sublittoral zones, commonly reaching a depth around 10 m.Haliotis asinina Donkey's ear abalone. Sealifebase.org accessed 10 July 2009. Though this species is quite abundant, aggregates of H. asinina are considered to be uncommon. Feeding habits These large animals are nocturnal. They graze amongst turf algae and inhabit the undersides of boulders and coral bommies.  Life cycle  Several major transitions in shell pattern and morphology can be observed during the life of Haliotis asinina. The species has a pelagobenthic life cycle that includes a minimal period of three to four days in the plankton. Biomineralisation begins shortly after hatching, with the fabrication of the larval shell (protoconch) over about a 10-hour period. The initial differentiation of biomineralising cells is likely to include a localised thickening of the dorsal ectoderm followed by an invagination of cells to form the shell gland. The shell gland then evaginates to form the shell field which expands through mitotic divisions to direct the precipitation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) via the secretion of organic molecules. In this way the larval shell (protoconch) is formed. The construction of the haliotid protoconch is complete following torsion. These structures allow the veliger larva to completely retract into a protective environment and rapidly fall out of the water column.: File:Haliotis asinina trochophore.jpgSEM of 9-hour old trochophore of Haliotis asinina with shell field (sf) File:Haliotis asinina trochophore protoconch.jpgTrochophore of Haliotis asinina 11 hours post-fertilisation, with a calcified protoconch (pc) File:Haliotis asinina protoconch.jpgProtoconch The next phase of biomineralisation does not commence until the competent veliger larva contacts an environmental cue that induces metamorphosis. The protoconch remains developmentally inert until the animal contacts a specific cue that initiates the process of metamorphosis. The postlarval shell (teleoconch) is laid down rapidly following metamorphosis with marked variation in the rate of its production between individuals. The transition from protoconch to teleoconch (juvenile/adult shell) is clearly visible at metamorphosis, and suggests the action of a different biomineralising secretome. The early postlarval shell is more robust and opaque than the larval shell but has no pigmentation. While the initial teloconch is not pigmented, it is textured and opaque such that postlarval shell growth is easily discerned from the larval shell. File:Haliotis asinina metamorphosis.jpgSEM image of initial postlarval shell at metamorphosis. The white arrow indicates the metamorphosis from the larval shell (protoconch) to juvenile shell. File:Haliotis asinina metamorphosis 2.jpgA photograph of two postlarvae on a coralline algal surface. The juvenile Haliotis asinina teloconch rapidly develops a uniform maroon colouration several weeks after metamorphosis, similar to the crustose coralline algae (CCA) that the larva has settled upon. At about 1 mm in size, further changes in the morphogenetic program of the mantle are reflected in the shell. Structurally, a pronounced series of ridges and valleys and a line of respiratory pores (tremata) have appeared. Furthermore, it is at this stage of development that the first recognisable tablets of nacre can be detected. Colourmetrically, the uniform maroon background is now interrupted by oscillations of a pale cream colour, and is punctuated by a pattern of dots (that only occur on ridges) which are blue when overlying a maroon field and orange when overlying a cream field. This shell pattern may enhance the juvenile's ability to camouflage on the heterogeneous background of the CCA they inhabit at this stage of development. File:Haliotis asinina juvenile.jpgLive 1–2-month old juveniles File:Haliotis asinina shell 2.jpgA 5 mm long juvenile shell of Haliotis asinina showing the tremata and ridges. File:Haliotis asinina shell 3.jpgJuvenile shells of approximately 1 – 10 mm in length have blue and orange dots, as shown here. This pattern is gradually lost with growth, as the shell becomes thicker and more elongate. At 10 to 15 mm, this ornate colouration pattern begins to fade, with maroon and cream fields apparently blending to give a brown background. Blue and orange dots however persist on the ridges. With further growth, the ridge-valley structure fades to give rise to a smooth adult shell, with irregular brown-green triangles on a light brown background. These large scale morphological changes are accompanied by mineralogical and crystallographic changes. Well defined tablets of nacre are present in shells larger than approximately 5 mm which are absent or poorly resolved in shells 1 mm or less. In larger shells, a ventral cap of CaCO3 that underlies the tablets of aragonitic nacre continues to thicken. Overall, ontogenetic changes in Haliotis asinina shell pigmentation and structure match changes in the habitats occupied during development.

Spark of protests After the violent clashes of April 6, representatives of the student community composed a list of 22 demands to the authorities, urging an end to police repression against the student movement. A series of other protests were held by students in the days to come. In an effort to quell the dissent, the authorities decided to close the campuses in Kathmandu valley between April 13 and April 21. On April 9 (B.S 2035 Chaitra), a nine-member central Action Committee of students was formed in order to write the 25-point chart of demands. The members of the Action Committee were as follows: * Nepal National Student Federation: Kailash Karki, Dhruba Shrestha and Sunil Manandhar, * Nepal Bidhyarthi Sangh: Bal Bahadur Karki, Benu Prasai and Shiva Bhurtel, and * All Nepal National Free Students Union: Sharan Bikram Malla, Bharat Pokhrel, and Dhruba Gyanwali Among them, 'chief action committees' consisting of three members were also formed, of Bal Bahadur K.C. of Nepal Students Union (connected to Nepali Congress), Kailash Karki of the Nepal National Students Federation (connected to the pro-Soviet Communist Party) and Sharan Bikram Malla of the All Nepal National Free Students Union (connected to the pro- Chinese communist, Pushpa lal group). April 23 Ascol clashes On April 23 students of the Amrit Science College (Ascol) held a public manifestation, protesting against violence committed by the pro-government outfit Rashtravadi Swatantra Vidhyarthi Mandal (nicknamed mandales). At that manifestation, the police not only decided to break up the demonstration in the open areas of the campus, but surrounded the entire area and began violently assaulting the students. Sources from the student community claimed that two or three students were killed by the police. Police sources, on their hand, claimed that 64 amongst their ranks had been injured in the clashes. Following the Amrit Science College clashes, the authorities took a decision that would essentially turn local student unrest in the capital into a national rebellion. They decided to close the campuses and student hostels; students were given 24 hours to clear their rooms. Students from remote areas left the capital to return to their family residences. To their villages and hometowns they brought news about the brutality of the state forces, and soon protests began to appear around the country.Shaha, Rishikesh. Politics in Nepal 1980-1990.

Official records say that three demonstrators were killed, but opposition sources claimed that the death toll could have reached 17. The morning after, the state forces clamped down on known opposition leaders in the capital, arresting several prominent figures. Former Prime Minister B.P. Koirala was placed under house arrest. The unrest then gained momentum and spread throughout the country. Protests occurred in Bhaktapur, Patan, Bharatpur, Birganj, Kalaiya, Janakpur, Biratnagar, Rajbiraj, Siraha, Sarlahi, Pokhara and Syangja.

The mountain was previously known as Clach Leathad (Stony Slope) in the Munro Tables prior to 1981, its name being changed to Creise when the highest point was found to be 1200 metres further north along the summit ridge when using new mapping techniques.  Overview  Creise along with Meall a' Bhuiridh, Stob Ghabhar and Stob a' Choire Odhair is one of the four Black Mount Munros, it reaches a height of 1100 metres (3609 feet) and is a hill that is well known to skiers as well as walkers being situated next to the White Corries ski area from where it is often climbed along with adjoining Meall a' Bhuiridh. The two mountains are a popular traverse with cross-country skiers. The mountain is well seen from the A82 road and the Kings House Hotel, showing its steep and craggy northern buttress of Sròn na Creise. For many years the translated meaning of the mountains name from the Gaelic was unknown, however Irvine Butterfield now says that “creis” means grease or fat and refers to the rich grazing land around the hill which was used in the past by Glen Coe herdsman to fatten their cattle.\\"The Magic of the Munros\\" Page 46 (Gives details of translated name).  Geography  Creise is a long whaleback of a mountain, oriented north to south. It has a three kilometre long summit ridge with four distinct high points. The most southerly is Clach Leathad (Clachlet) which with a height of 1099 metres is just a metre lower than the main summit. Up to the 1970s it was regarded as the highest point of the mountain. It was downgraded to a “Munro Top” in the 1981 edition of Munro's Tables. 700 metres north of Clach Leathad along the ridge is Mam Coire Easain (1070 metres), a former “Munro Top” deleted from the tables in 1981. It is strategically important as it stands at the head of the ridge linking the mountain to Meall a' Bhuiridh. The main summit stands a further 650 metres north. It was previously an unnamed Munro Top on OS maps before being promoted to Munro in 1981.The Munros and Tops 1891-1997. Spreadsheet with details of changes in Munro's Tables. A fourth high point is Stob a’ Ghlais Choire (996 metres). This Munro Top stands at the northern end of the ridge above the crags of Sròn na Creise which fall steeply to the valley of the River Etive. Sròn na Creise offers a challenging scrambler's route to the summit, but needs care in winter as several serious accidents have occurred on the crags.Mountaineering Council of Scotland. Details accidents on Sròn na Creise. Rainfall on Creise finds its way to both coasts of Scotland. Drainage from the south of the mountain (Clach Leathad) flows into Coire Ba, one of the biggest corries in Scotland,Travel Lite. “Coire Ba is a gigantic corrie“. and arrives at the east coast at the Firth of Tay via the Rivers Ba, Tummel and Tay. All other drainage from the mountain is via Glen Etive and Loch Etive to the west coast near Oban. The northern cliffs of Creise tower behind the Kings House Hotel.  Ascents  The most popular ascent of Creise along with the neighbouring Meall a' Bhuiridh starts at the White Corries ski Centre (grid reference ) and climbs Meall a' Bhuiridh first by following the line of the ski chair lift (no self-respecting mountaineer would use the lift). The lifts and tows go right up to the summit of the mountain. The continuation to Creise goes SW and then west over a col with a height of 932 metres which connects the two mountains to reach the summit plateau of Creise. A direct ascent from the same starting point goes west across moorland to reach the foot of Sròn na Creise, it is then a scramblers route up to the northern end of the summit ridge. The hill can also be climbed as part of the Clachlet Traverse, a 25 km classic walk between the Inveroran Inn at Bridge of Orchy and the Kings House Inn in Glen Coe taking all four of the Black Mount Munros with 1700 metres of ascent. The view from the summit takes in a close up of the cliffs of Buachaille Etive Mòr and the western part of Rannoch Moor\\"The Munros\\" Page 52 Gives routes of ascent.

Local & national importance  The Court evolved from the adjacent Tretower Castle site and is a very rare example of its type, in that it shows the way in which a castle gradually developed into another significant type of medieval building, the fortified manor house or defended house . It is also a rare survival, escaping destruction in wars or conflicts, partial damage or slighting, for example during the English Civil War, and total redevelopment over time.  Construction  Tretower Court, interior The initial construction of Tretower Court dates from the early years of the 14th century, when the castle site was also still in use. The earliest part of Tretower Court is the north range. The masonry of the walls, the internal fireplaces, the windows and the projecting latrine tower all indicate a date maybe as early as 1300. The 14th-century building consisted of a central ground floor hall open to its high roof, a solar or private bedchamber and a private living room. The hall probably served as a local court for paying fines and tithes. The west range was also 14th century.  Owain Glyndŵr  In the early 15th century during the Owain Glyndŵr revolt in Wales against the new King Henry IV the building was under a very real threat from Welsh forces. Tretower Castle was listed as a defensible stronghold for the King in 1404 and under Sir James Berkeley successfully held off an attack. Presumably this was directed at Tretower Castle and the Court escaped serious damage. The same year an English force led by Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick fought a Welsh army of Owain Glyndŵr at the Battle of Mynydd Cwmdu nearby, almost capturing Glyndŵr himself and capturing his banner or standard. The Welsh forces retreated down the valley of the River Usk but laid an ambush for the pursuing English and engaged them in a skirmish below Craig-y-Dorth hill near Mitchel Troy, where the large fields are still referred to as Upper and Lower Battlefield. The English army was chased to the walls of Monmouth town. According to the Annals of Owain Glyn Dwr, \\"Here the more part of the English were slain and they were chased up to the town gate [of Monmouth]\\".Annals of Owain Glyn Dwr Less than a decade later the Court was the local meeting point from which the local contingent of Welsh archers left for service in France under King Henry V and contributed to the English victory at Agincourt.  Development under the Vaughan family  Tretower Court, roof beamsIn early times the castle was held by the Picard (Pychard) family who gained extensive lands in Herefordshire for assisting William the Conqueror. Members of the family were Sheriffs of Hereford and married into several great landed families. About 1450 the property was given to Sir Roger Vaughan by Sir William Herbert, the Earl of Pembroke and his half-brother. Sir William Herbert was the previous owner of the Court and Tretower Castle and the manor. The property was to remain in the hands of successive generations of Vaughans for all of its heyday. Sir Roger Vaughan was to become the richest Commoner in Wales at the height of his career and he immediately set about refurbishing and developing Tretower Court into one befitting a prosperous man and leaving us the building that broadly speaking we see today. He modernised the north range , inserting a floor above the hall, turning the block into a two-storey building . The lower storey seems to have served as storerooms, with a kitchen at its west end . He also added a new west range, immediately doubling the accommodation available, building a brand new hall, solar and upper rooms . Sir Roger Vaughan was on the Yorkist side in the Wars of the Roses in the mid 15th century, fighting at the Battle of Mortimer's Cross in 1461, and leading Owain Tudor to his execution at Hereford following the battle. He quelled a rising in Carmarthenshire in 1465 and was soon after knighted. In 1471 he pursued Jasper Tudor following the Battle of Tewkesbury but Tudor captured him instead and he was beheaded at Chepstow Castle. Sir Roger Vaughan's son and heir, Sir Thomas Vaughan, continued to develop the Court further during the last quarter of the 15th Century with the addition of the battlemented wall, wall walks and gatehouse , thus enclosing the courtyard. Subsequent improvements were added in 1630 under Charles Vaughan, a sheriff of Brecknock in 1622 and 1636, adding cellars, a new stair, and an alternative entrance. The Court passed to his son Edward Vaughan but he died without issue, the estate passing to his sister, Charles' daughter, Margaret of Maes-y-Gwartha, married to a Thomas Morgan. The Court then passed through a few more generations without any further improvements, either to the fabric or the fortunes of the residents.  Decline & neglect  Tretower Court, gardens The property was sold in 1783 as the Vaughan family decided to take up occupancy at another of their properties following a marriage and Tretower Court passed out of Vaughan hands to a series of new tenants and over time some previously residential rooms were adapted as stores, barns and then even used by animals, part even becoming a piggery. The building was not maintained to the previous standards and by the early years of the 20th century the building was in danger of collapse, the roof in particular being vulnerable. What maintenance had taken place was piecemeal and concealed the origin, age and value of the medieval structure.  Rescue & renovation  In 1929 the Brecknock Society made a successful appeal for the government to purchase the building.Brecknock Society (1929). Appeal by the Brecknock Society to purchase for the nation the 14th century building known as Tretower Court. Western Mail In the 1930s it was saved and restored for the nation, and is now in the care of Cadw, Welsh Historic Monuments. The Court is now open to the public and a guided audio tour is available, inclusive in the nominal entrance fee. Events and interpretive reenactments are often held at the Court in season. Parts of the building are available for wedding ceremonies.

After only one season with FAS, he left them for Alianza and he moved to Atlético Balboa for the Clausura 2010 tournament. He also left Alianza after only one season and signed with Luis Ángel Firpo in 2010. Except for his period at San Salvador FC and his short stint at Atlético Balboa he has primarily been used as a back-up goalkeeper. He didn't have much activity with Luis Ángel Firpo, the most important game he had on the team was against Xolos de Tijuana on 2013–14 CONCACAF Champions League. He was the master piece of the team that night, because of his great match against the Mexican team, but he got injured and was the last game he played with Luis Ángel Firpo. Before a whole season injured he signed Atlético Marte in August 2014. However, with Atlético Marte Salinas experienced an administrative crisis, arrears in salary payments and pressures from directives of the team, leading Salinas to leave the club after Atlético Marte's descent in the Clausura 2016 tournament. In the Apertura 2016 Salinas signed with Chalatenango. However, with the scorpion's team Salinas he barely had minutes and left the club in 2017. In 2018 Salinas signed with Brujos de Izalco of Segunda División. International career Salinas' made his debut with El Salvador on August 22, 2007 against Honduras. His next game came only a couple of weeks later in a friendly match against Ecuador. Controversially, Salinas (who was the starting goalkeeper) was subbed out after only 34 minutes for Juan José Gómez. Many thought this was a harsh decision by Mexican coach Carlos de los Cobos, and believed that although Salinas had conceded two goals it was more due to poor defence rather than the goalkeeper mistakes. Since this game Salinas has not returned to the national team, and has not participated or been invited to attend any of the national team's training camps again.

It was the 50th game in the series featuring the Big Ten Conference and the Pacific-10 Conference. The USC Trojans defeated the Northwestern Wildcats, 41–32, on the strength of two touchdown passes from USC quarterback Brad Otton to wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson. Johnson was named the Rose Bowl Player Of The Game. Pre-game activities The game was presided over by the 1996 Tournament of Roses Royal Court and Rose Parade Grand Marshal Kermit the Frog. Members of the court were: Queen Keli Hutchins, San Marino, San Marino High School; Princesses Lissa Anderson, Pasadena, Blair High School; Sarah Clinton, Arcadia, Arcadia High School; Nancy Grace, South Pasadena, Mayfield Senior School; Katherine Kingston, San Marino, San Marino High School; Jennifer Lai, Pasadena, Blair High School; and Sara Packer, La Canada, La Canada High School. Teams=Northwestern Wildcats The Northwestern Wildcats had a string of losing seasons stretching back to 1972, and had not appeared in the Rose Bowl for 47 years, a win in January 1949. The Wildcats opened the 1995 season with a surprise 17–15 win at #9 Notre Dame on September 3, 1995. That Notre Dame finished at number 6 and went to the Orange Bowl. However, Notre Dame set the record for largest drop in the rankings AP Poll in the Top 25-era when the next AP poll was released. The Fighting Irish dropped 16 spots, from #9 to #25, after losing to Northwestern (this record has since been beaten by Michigan after losing to Appalachian State during the first week of the 2007 season). The Wildcats, who were then ranked in the AP Poll for the first time since 1971, fell out of the spotlight when they lost to Miami University in their next game. They won against Air Force and Indiana to get back to #25 in the polls. On October 2, the Wildcats had another win that brought them back into national attention, a 19–13 over Michigan in Ann Arbor. The Wildcats won the rest of their games with a perfect 8–0 record in the Big Ten Conference. In response to the Wildcats earning a berth in the Rose Bowl, announcer Keith Jackson uttered the quote \\"We've had all the romance, now let's find out if she can dance.\\" USC Trojans The USC Trojans opened with six wins until losing at Notre Dame, 38–10, on October 21. On October 28, USC and Washington played what would be the deciding game for the conference at Husky Stadium. Down 21–0 in the fourth quarter, the Trojans scored three straight touchdowns, with the final coming with 33 seconds remaining. The game ended in a 21–21 tie. A Washington loss to Oregon on November 4 put USC in the lead in the Pac-10 race. Coming into the UCLA–USC rivalry game, the Trojans already had the Rose Bowl berth by virtue of more non-conference victories than Washington, even though a loss to the Bruins would leave both teams with a 6–1–1 record.

Route description Iowa Highway 212 begins at an intersection with Iowa Highway 21 (Iowa 21) south of Belle Plaine. The intersection features a dominant curve from southbound Iowa 21 to eastbound Iowa 212\\\\. A short connector road allows westbound Iowa 212 traffic to reach southbound Iowa 21\\\\. Northbound Iowa 21 traffic must stop at the curve in order to continue north on Iowa 21. Heading east, Iowa 212 runs roughly parallel to the Iowa River for its entire length. It crosses Bear Creek before entering Marengo along South Street. At Western Avenue, Iowa 212 turns south towards U.S. Route 6. Just from its eastern end, Iowa 212 crosses a single line of the Iowa Interstate Railroad. The route ends at US 6 on the southwestern edge of Marengo. History The route which is now Iowa 212 was originally designated as Primary Road No. 73 (PR No. 73) in 1920. PR No. 73 was a route which began at the Lincoln Highway (PR No. 6) in Belle Plaine and ended at the River to River Road (PR No. 7) in Marengo. By 1947, Iowa 73 had been renumbered Iowa 212\\\\. The Lincoln Highway, now U.S. Route 30 (US 30), had been relocated north of Belle Plaine. Iowa 212 was extended west through Chelsea along the western leg of the abandoned section of US 30.

It was founded in 1981. Originally formed to operate a repertory movie theater, the company subsequently moved into catalog and online sales, retail stores, film festivals and film distribution. The catalog began as a pornographic mail order business and grew to include also gay and lesbian non- pornographic films and books and mainstream films. History TLA stands for Theatre of the Living Arts. Now a concert venue, it was founded as an experimental theater group in the 1960s under the direction of Andre Gregory (of My Dinner with Andre fame). The group included Danny DeVito, Judd Hirsch, Sally Kirkland and Ron Leibman who performed exclusively in the Theater of the Living Arts on South Street in Philadelphia. By the mid- to late-60s, funding for the Theater was running out and the theater was converted to a movie house showing an eclectic mix of classic and foreign films. In 1981, the founding partners of TLA Entertainment Group met and subsequently ran the theater. For the next six years the TLA was a repertory art movie theater. In addition, for four of those six years, the partners ran a small, first-run art house, the Roxy Screening Room, also located in Center City Philadelphia. The Theater of the Living Arts is no longer affiliated with TLA Entertainment Group. Video stores In 1985, the first video store was opened next door to Theater of the Living Arts. The stores expanded into a chain, and by 2005 there were four stores in Philadelphia and one in New York. (The NYC store was in a building previously occupied by the 8th St. Playhouse.) Starting in 2007, the stores began closing, with the New York store closing first, followed by the Chestnut Hill and Society Hill locations in 2009,South Street TLA Video Closes and the Rittenhouse Square location in 2011. The final store, TLA Bryn Mawr remained open until October 2012. Online sales TLA Entertainment Group launched the TLAvideo website in 1997. The site sells gay and lesbian, American independent, international, Hollywood and pornographic DVDs and books. Film festivals In 1994, TLA Entertainment Group President Raymond Murray started the Philadelphia International Gay & Lesbian Film Festival. In 2001, TLA Entertainment Group assumed management of the Philadelphia Festival of World Cinema, now called The Philadelphia Film Festival. The two-week festival shows over 100 feature films from around the world. In order to better fund these events, in August 2001 TLA Entertainment Group spun them off and created the non-profit Philadelphia Film Society. Film distribution TLA Releasing is the licensing division of TLA Entertainment. It is focused on the acquisition of distribution rights of international, independent, and gay and lesbian films to theaters and on DVD and VHS.

Chicago: S.J. Clarke Pub. Co. Josiah was the oldest of ten children in the family. He attended the public schools of his native state. At age sixteen the family moved and Josiah became employed on the Erie Canal at Lockport. Josiah was married in 1833 in New York to Elizabeth Winn (died 1869), and they would have four children. In 1839, the trained blacksmith volunteered to join Jason Lee's mission in the Willamette Valley. Parrish and around 50 others sailed on the ship Lausanne around Cape Horn in South America to the Columbia River and on to Oregon City in what has been called the Great Reinforcement of the Methodist Mission. They set sail on October 9, 1839, from New York City. Missionary Parrish and the others arrived in Oregon in May 1840. Beginning in February 1841 Parrish became involved in the movement towards creating a white colonist government in the Willamette Valley, which on May 3, 1843, at the last of the Champoeg Meetings he voted in favor of creating the Provisional Government of Oregon. The vote to create a government passed 52-50. During the two years of on and off meetings he helped to build the Star of Oregon that was sailed to California by a crew led by Joseph Gale. In California the vessel was sold in order to purchase cattle to be driven overland to the Willamette Valley. On February 1, 1842, Parrish was selected as a trustee to the new Oregon Institute, a school established to teach the children of the missionaries that would later become Willamette University. Also in 1842, Parrish moved to the Clatsop Plains and took over the Clatsop Mission from Joseph H. Frost. In 1844, when the Methodist Mission was dissolved by George Gary, Parrish purchased the Clatsop Plains mission. From 1849 until 1854 he worked as an Indian agent in the now Oregon Territory. As a rancher he was the first breeder in Oregon of pure- breed sheep, and had brought the first white clover seed to Oregon when he migrated aboard the Lausanne. Later life Gravestone of J. L. Parrish Parrish became involved in a land dispute involving the authority of the laws from the Provisional Government with Daniel H. Lownsdale. Parrish would take the matter to court in a case that would make its way through the Oregon Supreme Court and to the United States Supreme Court in Lownsdale v. Parrish, 62 U.S. 290 (1858).Lownsdale v. Parrish, 62 U.S. 290 (1858). In 1868, Parrish drove the first spike in Portland, Oregon, for the Oregon and California Railroad. In 1869, his wife, Elizabeth Parrish, donated land to help create the Lee Mission Cemetery in Salem, Oregon, with Josiah as one of the incorporators.History of Lee Mission Cemetery , OregonPioneers.com. Retrieved on September 17, 2007. Later that year his wife Elizabeth died, with Josiah remarrying in 1870 to Jane (Jennie) Lichtenthaler Pickett. Married in Portland, the couple would have two children, Gertrude Grace and Josephine Leilani before Jane, known as Jennie, died in 1887. Jennie graduated from Willamette Medical School in 1879 and practiced in both Salem and Portland. In 1888, Josiah would marry a final time, to Mrs. M. A. Pierce.

It seems to have had personal details (acting to identify a body the same way a modern dog tag does) with a seal or stamp to authenticate it. Similar items for identifying civilian goods and equipment have been found as well. Signacula of this variety were not discs that were carried on one's person as with the Roman army equivalent, but are more like modern-day product labels, giving information on the item's manufacturer and affiliates.  History  Although the origins of exactly when or why the Roman army decided to use the signaculum for their soldiers are not clear, there are, regardless, references to its use in some historical documents, which indicate its composition (lead), as well as the fact that it is given after it is determined a man is fit to serve the legion. In a document from 295, Maximilian of Tebessa, an early Christian martyr, is being recruited as an officer in the Roman army against his wishes:  Other forms  Signaculum PRIMIT (Primit=first) Labels Signaculum also describes the stamps on some Roman Imperial goods, and are used to identify the manufacturer and/or other pertinent facts about the item. Mark of slaves Slaves were also known to wear dog tags on their person, typically in the form of an unremovable metal collar that would be inscribed with messages such as: These, along with branding and tattooing, were common ways for Roman slaves to be separated from the rest of the Roman social system, and easily punishable should they make their escape. Stamps It is possible that signacula that were carried by domestic workers were used as stamps to record usage of tools, and debts from one to another. Replacement by the soldier's mark There is some evidence suggesting that, by the time of the late Roman army, it became common practice to instead give soldiers that were found to be fit for service in the legion an indelible Soldier's Mark, possibly to discourage desertion by making any former or deserting soldiers clearly discernible. In De Re Militari (AD 390), one of the few writings of Roman military writer Vegetius Renatus, it is stated that, after the initial selection process, a recruit is then placed through a four- month testing period to ensure his physical capability.

SAINT Network Vulnerability Scanner The SAINT scanner screens every live system on a network for TCP and UDP services. For each service it finds running, it launches a set of probes designed to detect anything that could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access, create a denial-of-service, or gain sensitive information about the network. SAINT provides support to the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) specification as an Unauthenticated Vulnerability Scanner and Authenticated Vulnerability and Patch Scanner. SAINT is also an approved scanning vendor with the Payment Card Industry (PCI).https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/approved_companies_providers/approved_scanning_vendors.php The Four Steps of a SAINT Scan: * Step 1 – SAINT screens every live system on a network for TCP and UDP services. * Step 2 – For each service it finds running, it launches a set of probes designed to detect anything that could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access, create a denial-of-service, or gain sensitive information about the network. * Step 3 – The scanner checks for vulnerabilities. * Step 4 – When vulnerabilities are detected, the results are categorized in several ways, allowing customers to target the data they find most useful. SAINT can group vulnerabilities according to severity, type, or count. It can also provide information about a particular host or group of hosts. SAINT describes each of the vulnerabilities it locates; references Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), CERT advisories, and IAVA (Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts); and describes ways to correct the vulnerabilities. In many cases, the SAINT scanner provides links to patches or new software versions that will eliminate the detected vulnerabilities.https://www.carson-saint.com/products/ A vulnerability is a flaw in a system, device, or application that, if leveraged by an attacker, could impact the security of the system. Exploits take advantage of a vulnerability by compromising or destructing the vulnerable system, device, or application. Remediation is the process of repairing or providing a remedy for a vulnerability, thereby eliminating the risk of being exploited. Vulnerability scanning is used to identify and evaluate the security posture of a network. Historically, scanners were developed for specific purposes such as scanning only Windows desktops, applications, or network devices. SAINT offers heterogeneous scanning that identifies vulnerabilities across operating systems, desktop applications, network devices, Web applications, databases, and more. SAINTexploit Penetration Testing Tool The integrated penetration testing tool, SAINTexploit, demonstrates the path an attacker could use to breach a network and quantifies the risk to the network. SAINTexploit includes a Web site emulator and e-mail forgery tool.https://www.carson-saint.com/wp- content/uploads/2019/10/SAINT_SCinnovator.pdf Penetration testing tools from SAINT are designed to simulate both internal and external real-world attacks. This type of testing identifies the methods of gaining access to a target and understanding the techniques used by attackers. There are many levels and types of penetration testing and the scope of the project should be well defined. Targets included in the scope could include popular protocols, network devices, databases, Web applications, desktop applications, and various flavors of operating systems. SAINT focuses on the development of exploits where a shell can be established. A shell, or shellcode, is where all exploits included offer a command shell/direct connection to the target from the computer performing the testing. Exploits target operating systems, desktop applications, databases, Web applications, protocols, and network devices. The most common exploit types included in SAINTexploit include the following: • Remote Exploit – These attacks are launched across the Internet or network against a vulnerable target without the user having previous access to the system. • Client Exploit – The victim must access the attacker’s resource for a successful attack to take place. Common client exploits include e-mail forgery attacks, enticing the user to visit a Web site, or to open a file. • Local Exploit – In order to launch a local attack, the attacker must have previous access to the victim. (Also known as privilege elevation and tunneling). In this case, the victim's machine is used as the launch pad for connecting to other vulnerable targets. SAINTmanager Remote Management Console SAINT’s remote management console, SAINTmanager, enables enterprise- wide vulnerability scanning. The browser-based console provides the ability to centrally manage an entire network of SAINT vulnerability scanners from a single interface. SAINTCloud  SAINTCloud enables cloud based vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and compliance audits without having to download and install software. History The SAINT (Security Administrator's Integrated Network Tool) network vulnerability scanner was based on SATAN (Security Administrator Tool for Analyzing Networks) which was developed by Dan Farmer and Wietse Venema and released in 1995.

An Individual augmentee is a United States military member attached to a unit (battalion or company) as a temporary duty assignment (TAD/TDY). Individual Augmentees can be used to fill shortages or can be used when an individual with specialized knowledge or skill sets is required. As a result, Individual Augmentees can include members from an entirely different branch of service. The system was used extensively in the Iraq War, though with some criticism. By early 2007, there were an average of approximately 12,000 Navy personnel filling Army jobs in the United States, Iraq, Afghanistan, Cuba and the Horn of Africa at any one time. Historical use All branches of the military have existing regulations concerning assignment of personnel outside of their normal organization or branch of service. Examples include members of the Navy who are temporarily assigned to NASA for astronaut duty. Upon completion of their duties, these members are returned to their home units. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, and especially after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Individual Augmentee assignments increased dramatically. Initially, most of these assignments included Navy or Air Force personnel assigned to Army units to fill specialized roles that the Army had either trouble filling or had limited expertise in. Some of these personnel were already combat trained by virtue of their existing skills, while others went into combat zones in Afghanistan and Iraq with little or no combat training. As a result, a formal program soon developed that ensured a minimum level of training for all members deploying to combat zones. Current assignment and training model Admiral Gary Roughead, Chief of Naval Operations speaking about individual augmentee assignments and answering questions during an all-hands call aboard USS Milius The current Individual Augmentee system approved by the United States Department of Defense works on a combination of ordered and volunteer assignments mirroring manning requirements. The Army produces a document consisting of job requirements with the required skill sets as well as starting and ending dates. The job descriptions are converted to Navy equivalents and the personnel activities of these branches task local commanders with assigning the required personnel. Volunteers are used first, and local commands issue orders for the remaining jobs based on local instructions. For the Navy, excess shore billets are tapped first.http://www.navycompass.com/news/newsview.asp?c=184127 As of June 5, 2008, United States Fleet Forces Command has responsibility of the Individual Augmentee training program. In January 2006 the McCrady Training Center at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, became the central training facility for Navy personnel assigned as Individual Augmentees. The center, operated by Task Force Marshall, is also a South Carolina Army National Guard facility, and the Individual Augmentee training program is modeled closely after the refresher training conducted for drilling reservists. Prior to using this centralized facility personnel were trained in several other locations including Fort Lewis, Washington, Camp Shelby, Mississippi, Fort Bliss, Texas, and Fort Benning, Georgia. The McCrady facility is capable of processing up to 600 students at once with an annual budget of $16.7 million. Sailors preparing to enter a simulated building while participating in the Navy's Individual Augmentee Combat Training course at Fort Jackson. Curriculum at McCrady includes basic combat skills. The three-week course is not designed to build Army infantrymen since even for Army personnel a significant amount of training occurs not in Basic Combat Training but in the experience of years on the job. Instead, the program is designed to teach individuals assigned to Army units the basic skills required to stay alive should the worst scenario occur. In keeping with this, topics covered in the training include basic marksmanship (Navy personnel must qualify on the same course of fire as Army personnel), combat first aid, land navigation, urban operations and an introduction to Army culture. Perhaps most important is training in convoy and counter-IED operations since these subjects are crucial to survival in Afghanistan and Iraq. It's important to note that the vast majority of Navy Individual Augmentees are assigned to combat support or combat service support roles, and only a small percentage of Individual Augmentees have seen combat. While some risk exposure in a war zone is inevitable, most joint commands in Iraq and Afghanistan have specific controls in place to limit the exposure of personnel who are not trained for such high risk operations. Even with the additional training and limited combat exposure of most Individual Augmentees, deaths have occurred. While the Navy has sustained 73 casualties in the combined efforts of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, many of these individuals were Naval Combatants or Direct Support Enablers SEAL, EOD, Hospital Corpsmen, or Seabee whose roles were not typical of most Navy personnel. Controversy Rick West meeting with sailors returning from individual augmentee assignments. While the Individual Augmentee program has been in existence long before the September 11, 2001 attacks, the current use of the program has drawn controversy. One reason is that the program is being used to fill Army vacancies for the sole reason of making up for lower Army recruiting numbers. There has also been criticism in Congress about the program due to issues of oversight and financing, as well as mission readiness. Congress has expressed concern that the Navy, with a traditionally sea-centric role, may be spreading itself too thin (some units have up to 40% of personnel on IA duty) and in the process may lose some of its core competency in traditional seagoing warfare. Members within the Navy have expressed concern about the increased focus of IA assignments, especially as to how they relate to promotions, advancement and awards, with some members interpreting new Navy instructions on the subject to mean that Individual Augmentees are to receive preferential treatment. Although Congress and the Department of Defense have increased the Army's troop strength authorization by 7,000, the Army and Navy have both admitted that it may take as much as five years before Individual Augmentee requirements draw down to pre-Iraq War levels.

Located adjacent to the University of Missouri campus, the hospital has a coverage area of 43 counties in Missouri and Illinois and serves more than 38,000 veterans inpatient and 314,000 veterans outpatient. Affiliated with the University of Missouri School of Medicine, it provides primary care, surgical, mental health, medical, geriatric, transitional, rehabilitative, and hospice services. The medical center has achieved some of the best scores in the state of Missouri for JCAHO Quality Reporting. History Truman Veterans' Hospital was constructed from 1966 to 1972 at a cost of $15 million. In 1975, by an act of Congress, it was legally named Harry S. Truman Memorial Veterans' Hospital. Truman VA is the only hospital in the Heartland Network — including Missouri and Kansas as well as parts of Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, and Arkansas — that has a referral center for open heart surgery. At least 250 heart surgeries per year are performed at the hospital. In 1995, a new ambulatory care building was built, adding onto the north side of the hospital. The two-story ambulatory care center was dedicated on March 20, 1998, and cost $15.1 million. In August 2009, ground was broken on a , $25 million expansion to add a suite of operating rooms and renovate existing floor space. The new building houses five operating room suites, two dedicated to open heart surgery, two general purpose, and one dedicated to special procedures. The old operating rooms were also be gutted to house a new post-anesthesia care unit and pre-operation room. The first phase of the project was completed in November 2010, with the entire project completed in mid-2012. The Truman VA was awarded $8 million in stimulus package funds to replace or renovate existing hospital components, which was completed in 2011. Additional facilities The Truman VA maintains eight Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) in Waynesville, Kirkville, Mexico, St. James, Osage Beach, Missouri, Jefferson City, Sedalia, and Marshfield, each of which provides access to primary care and mental health services. Research program and affiliations The Truman VA is affiliated with the University of Missouri School of Medicine and supports 83 resident doctor positions; it also provides a clinical site for other professions within the health field. In 2009, 52 research projects were active at the VA hospital, and included important areas like diagnostic imaging, cancer therapy, cardiovascular disease, PTSD, traumatic brain injury, geriatrics, pulmonary care, and the development of new radiopharmaceuticals. The Truman VA participates in the Missouri Arthritis Rehabilitation Research and Training Center (MARRTC), which is the only federally funded arthritis rehabilitation research and training center in the United States. The MARRTC provides research and public awareness regarding arthritis and to improve the quality of life and promote independent living among people with arthritis and arthritic conditions.

The coefficient is a function of surface temperature, surface coverage (θ) and structural details as well as the kinetic energy of the impinging particles. The original formulation was for molecules adsorbing from the gas phase and the equation was later extended to adsorption from the liquid phase by comparison with molecular dynamics simulations. For use in adsorption from liquids the equation is expressed based on solute density (molecules per volume) rather than the pressure. Derivation When arriving at a site of a surface, an adatom has three options. There is a probability that it will adsorb to the surface (P_a), a probability that it will migrate to another site on the surface (P_m), and a probability that it will desorb from the surface and return to the bulk gas (P_d). For an empty site (θ=0) the sum of these three options is unity. : P_a + P_m + P_d=1 For a site already occupied by an adatom (θ>0), there is no probability of adsorbing, and so the probabilities sum as: : P_d'+P_m'=1 For the first site visited, the P of migrating overall is the P of migrating if the site is filled plus the P of migrating if the site is empty. The same is true for the P of desorption. The P of adsorption, however, does not exist for an already filled site. : P_{m1}=P_m(1-\\\\theta)+P_m'(\\\\theta) : P_{d1}=P_d(1-\\\\theta)+P_d'(\\\\theta) : P_{a1}=P_a(1-\\\\theta) The P of migrating from the second site is the P of migrating from the first site and then migrating from the second site, and so we multiply the two values. : P_{m2}=P_{m1} \\\\times P_{m1}=P_{m1}^2 Thus the sticking probability ( s_c ) is the P of sticking of the first site, plus the P of migrating from the first site and then sticking to the second site, plus the P of migrating from the second site and then sticking at the third site etc. : s=P_a(1-\\\\theta)+P_{m1}P_a(1-\\\\theta)+P_{m1}^2P_a(1-\\\\theta)... : s=P_a(1-\\\\theta)\\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infin} P_{m1}^n There is an identity we can make use of. :\\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infin} x^n =\\\\frac{1}{1-x}\\\\forall x<1 :\\\\therefore s=P_a(1-\\\\theta)\\\\frac{1}{1-P_{m1}} The sticking coefficient when the coverage is zero s_0 can be obtained by simply setting \\\\theta=0. We also remember that :1-P_{m1}=P_a+P_d : s_0=\\\\frac{P_a}{P_a+P_d} : \\\\frac{s}{s_0}=\\\\frac{P_a(1-\\\\theta)}{1-P_{m1}}\\\\frac{P_a+P_d}{P_a} If we just look at the P of migration at the first site, we see that it is certainty minus all other possibilities. : P_m1=1-P_d(1-\\\\theta)-P_d'(\\\\theta)-P_a(1-\\\\theta) Using this result, and rearranging, we find: : \\\\frac{s}{s_0}=[1+\\\\frac{P_d'\\\\theta}{(P_a+P_d)(1-\\\\theta)}]^{-1} : \\\\frac{s}{s_0}=[1+\\\\frac{K\\\\theta}{1-\\\\theta}]^{-1} : K\\\\overset{\\\\underset{\\\\mathrm{def}}{}}{=}\\\\frac{P_d'}{P_a+P_d} References *King-Ning Tu, James W.

The village is about west of Bicester and about north of Kidlington. The parish is bounded by the River Cherwell in the east, the A4260 main road between Oxford and Banbury in the west, partly by the B4030 in the north, and by field boundaries with Tackley parish in the south. The 2001 Census recorded the parish's population as 80. Rousham was founded early in the Anglo-Saxon era. Its toponym is derived from Old English meaning Hrothwulf's ham or farm.  Manor  The Domesday Book records that in 1086 there were two manors at Rousham. The larger belonged to the Norman nobleman Robert D'Oyly and the smaller to his brother in arms Roger d'Ivry. The D'Oyly manor later became part of the honour of Wallingford and in 1279 its overlord was Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall. The latest known records of Rousham remaining in the Honour of Wallingford are from the 15th century. The d'Ivry family line died out in 1215 and the d'Ivry manor at Rousham became part of the Honour of St. Valery. In 1237 Henry III granted the d'Ivry manor at Rousham to Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall and in 1279 it, like the D'Oyly manor, was held by Richard's son Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall.

A \\"German's Well\\" recorded in the parish in 1626 refers to St Germanus. By 1846 the church had been rededicated to Saint Mary and by 1864 it had been changed again to Saint James. The present dedication of Saint Leonard and Saint James dates from 1904. The church building dates from the 12th century. The easternmost bay of the arcade for the south aisle was built in about 1180 and the bell tower was added early in the 13th century. Between 1296 and 1316 a chantry chapel was added to the north side of the nave. Slightly later the south aisle was extended the full length of the nave, a south chapel was included and a south porch was added. The arch to the south chapel is 14th century and all the windows of the south aisle are Decorated Gothic. In the 15th century a clerestory was added to the nave and a rood screen and rood loft were built across the nave and aisle. The chantry chapel was in disrepair by 1520 and demolished shortly after 1530. Later in the 16th century a large window was inserted in the north wall of the nave towards its western end. It and all the other windows in the north wall are Perpendicular Gothic. In 1867–68 the church building was restored, the chancel and south porch were rebuilt and the height of the chancel was increased. In 1744 the wooden pulpit was built, and during the restoration of 1867–68 it was reduced in height. The pews were rebuilt in the 19th century but include some 17th and 18th century panelling. The tower has a ring of six bells. Richard Keene of Woodstock cast five of them including the treble and tenor bells in 1675; Thomas II Mears of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the fourth bell in 1825. Rousham Rectory was a large house, consisting of eight bays in 1634 and 11 bays in 1685. It was remodelled in 1804 and enlarged in 1873, when the present attic floor was added. The architect of the 1873 works was William Wilkinson of Oxford, whose commissions included several clergy houses in Oxfordshire. In 1921 the house was sold to the Cottrell-Dormers.  Economic and social history  The north- south Oxford–Banbury road that forms the parish's western boundary is an ancient ridgeway. It was a turnpike from 1755 until 1875. In the 1920s road classification the Oxford–Adderbury stretch of the former turnpike was made part of the A423 road. When the M40 motorway was completed in the 1990s the old Oxford–Banbury ridgeway was reclassified the A4260. The Bicester–Enstone road that forms part of the parish's northern boundary has existed at least since 1255 when a bridge was built at Lower Heyford to carry it across the River Cherwell. The road was a turnpike from 1793 until 1876. Since the 1920s road classification this road has been the B4030. The Domesday Book records that by 1086 the parish had two water mills, presumably on the River Cherwell. By 1222 there was only one mill, and this still existed in 1547. Its later history is not clear but it had gone by 1721. In 1636 Sir Robert Dormer, lord of the manor of Rousham, refused to pay ship money. During the English Civil War a Royalist force plundered the house and village in 1644 and a detachment of Royalist cavalry occupied the house early in 1645. Most of Rousham parish was farmed under an open field system until the 18th century. There had been one small enclosure by 1601 and a second in 1645. The enclosure of the parish's remaining common lands in 1775 was by agreement between the landowners without recourse to an Act of Parliament. Clement Cottrell-Dormer established a parish school in about 1785. Between 1808 and 1818 it had between 22 and 25 pupils, but there is no record of it after 1834. In 1878 Clement Upton-Cottrell-Dormer established a new parish school in the building just south of the parish church. It opened with 35 pupils but this declined to 25 in 1889 and 16 in 1906. The school was closed in 1926 but its building is still recognisable as the schoolhouse, complete with bell-turret on the western gable. Between 1845 and 1850 the Oxford and Rugby Railway was built, passing through the eastern margin of the parish beside the River Cherwell. In 1850 it opened Heyford railway station at Lower Heyford, north of Rousham village. The station is now part of the Cherwell Valley Line and is served by Great Western Railway trains.

It reports on events in Earth's natural history. Typical content Earthweek provides a weekly overview of headline events affecting the planet—cyclones, floods, brushfires, oil spills and climate change. Other stories are a bit more unusual—monkey attacks, snake infestations and a bounty of phenomena as diverse as nature itself. Earthweek initially focused mainly on breaking weather news stories, along with a complement of items about volcanic eruptions, El Niño outbreaks and unusual animal stories. That focus has widened in recent years to be more inclusive of global warming issues and how wildlife is reacting to the changing climate. Format The feature was the first fully paginated newspaper column to be distributed with placed graphics, thanks to the growing popularity of the Macintosh computer platform in newspaper graphics departments during the late 1980s. Due to the slow modem speeds common in 1988, early versions of Earthweek were limited to low-resolution graphics. Subscribing newspapers maintained a library of individual icons and the base map, which were used by the \\"wire frame\\" of the Pagemaker document distributed to them each week. Earthweek is now created in QuarkXPress with Adobe Illustrator graphics, and is delivered as a complete, integrated package. A PDF version of the feature may be downloaded by readers in markets where Earthweek is not published. Distribution The feature premiered in the San Francisco Chronicle on Saturday, January 2, 1988, and began syndication through the now-defunct Chronicle Features in early September of that year. Earthweek moved briefly to Universal Press Syndicate in 1998, when Andrews McMeel Universal purchased Chronicle Features. Author Steve Newman moved the column to the Los Angeles Times Syndicate in June 1998, where its circulation increased and an online version was created. A subsequent purchase of that syndicate by the Tribune Company absorbed Earthweek into Tribune Media Services, which discontinued the online version and oversaw a steady decline in the column's print subscriptions and sales. Earthweek rejoined Universal Press Syndicate in June 2003, and is now published by nearly 100 newspapers worldwide. An interactive version was launched by Uclick in July 2006. Use in education Many educators use the feature in a weekly assignment to elementary and middle school students. By encouraging a close examination of Earthweeks map and summaries, students can increase their understanding of both geography and the environment. Educator Lori Agan wrote an essay in the National Science Teachers Association journal Science Scope that documents how her use of Earthweek has benefited her students. Author rightEarthweek is produced by Steve Newman, a broadcast meteorologist for more than 30 years and a frequent contributor for ABC's Good Morning America. His Earth Alert bulletins were a weekly component of Discovery News on the Discovery Channel, and an online feature of Discovery.com. in 1980 Newman established Earth Environment Service, a weather consulting company that provided forecasts and data to agricultural, insurance and media interests worldwide.

Among the featured artists are Bing Crosby, Rosemary Clooney, Danny Kaye, and Trudy Stevens (who dubbed for Vera-Ellen in the movie), with Peggy Lee, who was not in the movie, singing some parts. It is one of the last 78 rpm albums Decca produced. Background An original soundtrack recording has never been released. This was because Crosby had a recording contract with Decca Records and Rosemary Clooney was signed with Columbia Records and contractually could not record together. This album was issued with Columbia's Irving Berlin's White Christmas. In this album, Lee recorded the parts that Clooney sang in the movie. This was Crosby's third Decca LP album, recorded and released in 1954 and advertised as the soundtrack for White Christmas. For the 78rpm set, the three song medley \\"Blue Skies/I'd Rather See a Minstrel Show/Mandy\\" running to 3 minutes 53 seconds was a too long for a 10\\" 78, so \\"Blue Skies\\" was removed. The music and lyrics were written by highly celebrated songwriter Irving Berlin. The album was released on CD by MCA in 1994. In the UK, it was released in 2002 as part of a 2-on-1 CD with studio recordings of songs from Holiday Inn (1942). A special edition, combined with the DVD of the film, was sold in Starbucks stores during the holiday season in 2006. Although Clooney and Crosby were unable to make an album together at this time, they made the albums Fancy Meeting You Here, How the West Was Won , and That Travelin' Two-Beat later in their careers. They also co-starred in a network radio show and frequently appeared together on television during the 1950s and 1960s.

This notion was introduced by the Russian mathematician Gennadi KasparovG. Kasparov. The operator K-functor and extensions of C*-algebras. Izv. Akad. Nauk. SSSR Ser. Mat. 44 (1980), 571-636 in 1980. It was influenced by Atiyah's concept of Fredholm modules for the Atiyah–Singer index theorem, and the classification of extensions of C*-algebras by Lawrence G. Brown, Ronald G. Douglas, and Peter Arthur Fillmore in 1977.Brown, L. G.; Douglas, R. G.; Fillmore, P. A., \\"Extensions of C*-algebras and K-homology\\", Annals of Mathematics (2) 105 (1977), no. 2, 265-324\\\\. In turn, it has had great success in operator algebraic formalism toward the index theory and the classification of nuclear C*-algebras, as it was the key to the solutions of many problems in operator K-theory, such as, for instance, the mere calculation of K-groups. Furthermore, it was essential in the development of the Baum–Connes conjecture and plays a crucial role in noncommutative topology. KK-theory was followed by a series of similar bifunctor constructions such as the E-theory and the bivariant periodic cyclic theory, most of them having more category-theoretic flavors, or concerning another class of algebras rather than that of the separable C*-algebras, or incorporating group actions.  Definition  The following definition is quite close to the one originally given by Kasparov. This is the form in which most KK-elements arise in applications. Let A and B be separable C*-algebras, where B is also assumed to be σ-unital. The set of cycles is the set of triples (H, ρ, F), where H is a countably generated graded Hilbert module over B, ρ is a *-representation of A on H as even bounded operators which commute with B, and F is a bounded operator on H of degree 1 which again commutes with B. They are required to fulfill the condition that :[F, \\\\rho(a)], (F^2-1)\\\\rho(a), (F-F^*)\\\\rho(a) for a in A are all B-compact operators. A cycle is said to be degenerate if all three expressions are 0 for all a. Two cycles are said to be homologous, or homotopic, if there is a cycle between A and IB, where IB denotes the C*-algebra of continuous functions from [0,1] to B, such that there is an even unitary operator from the 0-end of the homotopy to the first cycle, and a unitary operator from the 1-end of the homotopy to the second cycle. The KK-group KK(A, B) between A and B is then defined to be the set of cycles modulo homotopy. It becomes an abelian group under the direct sum operation of bimodules as the addition, and the class of the degenerate modules as its neutral element. There are various, but equivalent definitions of the KK-theory, notably the one due to Joachim CuntzJ. Cuntz. A new look at KK-theory. K-Theory 1 (1987), 31-51 which eliminates bimodule and 'Fredholm' operator F from the picture and puts the accent entirely on the homomorphism ρ. More precisely it can be defined as the set of homotopy classes :KK(A,B) = [qA, K(H) \\\\otimes B], of *-homomorphisms from the classifying algebra qA of quasi-homomorphisms to the C*-algebra of compact operators of an infinite dimensional separable Hilbert space tensored with B. Here, qA is defined as the kernel of the map from the C*-algebraic free product A*A of A with itself to A defined by the identity on both factors.  Properties  When one takes the C*-algebra C of the complex numbers as the first argument of KK as in KK(C, B) this additive group is naturally isomorphic to the K0-group K0(B) of the second argument B. In the Cuntz point of view, a K0-class of B is nothing but a homotopy class of *-homomorphisms from the complex numbers to the stabilization of B. Similarly when one takes the algebra C0(R) of the continuous functions on the real line decaying at infinity as the first argument, the obtained group KK(C0(R), B) is naturally isomorphic to K1(B). An important property of KK-theory is the so-called Kasparov product, or the composition product, :KK(A,B) \\\\times KK(B,C) \\\\to KK(A,C), which is bilinear with respect to the additive group structures. In particular each element of KK(A, B) gives a homomorphism of K*(A) → K*(B) and another homomorphism K*(B) → K*(A). The product can be defined much more easily in the Cuntz picture given that there are natural maps from QA to A, and from B to K(H) ⊗ B which induce KK-equivalences. The composition product gives a new category \\\\mathsf{KK}, whose objects are given by the separable C*-algebras while the morphisms between them are given by elements of the corresponding KK-groups. Moreover, any *-homomorphism of A into B induces an element of KK(A, B) and this correspondence gives a functor from the original category of the separable C*-algebras into \\\\mathsf{KK}. The approximately inner automorphisms of the algebras become identity morphisms in \\\\mathsf{KK}. This functor \\\\mathsf{C^*!-!alg} \\\\to \\\\mathsf{KK} is universal among the split-exact, homotopy invariant and stable additive functors on the category of the separable C*-algebras. Any such theory satisfies Bott periodicity in the appropriate sense since \\\\mathsf{KK} does. The Kasparov product can be further generalized to the following form: :KK(A, B \\\\otimes E) \\\\times KK(B \\\\otimes D, C) \\\\to KK(A \\\\otimes D, C \\\\otimes E). It contains as special cases not only the K-theoretic cup product, but also the K-theoretic cap, cross, and slant products and the product of extensions.  Notes  References  * B.

In 1971 the winner received $3,000 and each year since then, the winner's purse has been raised by $1,000; in 2019 the winner received a total check of $52,000. Qualifying Qualifying for the World 100 feature race is a 3 day event. Typically, the Thursday and Friday prior to the World 100 is filled with the prototypical event schedule (hot laps, heat races, B-Main/Last Chance Qualifier, Feature event). Both Thursday and Friday have Twin Features. Drivers earn points based on their performances the first two days. On Saturday (the day of the World 100) drivers are seeded into their heat races based on the points accumulated through the previous 2 days. How they finish in their heat races immediately determines where the predetermined number of qualifying drivers will start. There is also a predetermined number of drivers that start in reverse order, resulting from the \\"Wheel of Misfortune\\" that has gained some fame at Eldora. This process saw Hudson O'Neal, son of legendary driver Don O'Neal, become the youngest driver to start on the pole at 17-years-old in 2017. In 2018, both Friday and Saturday racing were rained out and moved from the September date, to Columbus Day weekend in October.

These bones, or ossicles, are a defining characteristic of all mammals. The event is well-documented and importantMeier & Ruf (2016), page 270, Introduction, \\"The study of the mammalian middle ear has been one of the central themes of vertebrate morphological research of the last 200 years.\\" as a demonstration of transitional forms and exaptation, the re-purposing of existing structures during evolution. The ossicles evolved from skull bones present in most tetrapods, including the reptilian lineage. The reptilian quadrate bone, articular bone, and columella evolved into the mammalian incus, malleus, and stapes (anvil, hammer, and stirrup), respectively. In reptiles, the eardrum is connected to the inner ear via a single bone, the columella, while the upper and lower jaws contain several bones not found in mammals. Over the course of the evolution of mammals, one bone from the lower and one from the upper jaw (the articular and quadrate bones) lost their purpose in the jaw joint and migrated to the middle ear. The shortened columella connected to these bones within the middle ear to form a chain of three bones, the ossicles, which serve to effectively transmit air-based vibrations and facilitate more acute hearing. History Following on the ideas of Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1818), and studies by Johann Friedrich Meckel the Younger (1820), Carl Gustav Carus (1818), Martin Rathke (1825), and Karl Ernst von Baer (1828), the relationship between the reptilian jaw bones and mammalian middle-ear bones was first established on the basis of embryology and comparative anatomy by Karl Bogislaus Reichert (in 1837, before the publication of On the Origin of Species in 1859). These ideas were advanced by Ernst Gaupp, and are now known as the Reichert–Gaupp theory. The discovery of the link in homology between the reptilian jaw joint and mammalian malleus and incus is considered an important milestone in the history of comparative anatomy. Novacek references these early works: – – Work on extinct theromorphs by Owen (1845), and continued by Seeley, Broom, and Watson, was pivotal in discovering the intermediate steps to this change. The transition between the \\"reptilian\\" jaw and the \\"mammalian\\" middle ear was not bridged in the fossil record until the 1950s with the elaboration of such fossils as the now-famous Morganucodon. During embryonic development, the incus and malleus arise from the same first pharyngeal arch as the mandible and maxilla, and are served by mandibular and maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve. Recent genetic studies are able to relate the development of the ossicles from the embryonic arch to hypothesized evolutionary history. Bapx1, also known as Nkx3.2 (a member of the NK2 class of homeobox genes), is implicated in the change from the jaw bones of non- mammals to the ossicles of mammals.A survey of the genes involved in the development of the vertebrate middle ear is given in Other implicated genes include the Dlx genes, Prx genes, and Wnt genes.

Other features are required when classifying fossils, since mammary glands and other soft-tissue features are not visible in fossils. Paleontologists therefore use the ossicles as distinguishing bony features shared by all living mammals (including monotremes), but is not present in any of the early Triassic therapsids (\\"mammal-like reptiles\\"). left Early amniotes had a jaw joint composed of the articular (a small bone at the back of the lower jaw) and the quadrate (a small bone at the back of the upper jaw). All non-mammalian amniotes use this system including lizards, crocodilians, dinosaurs (and their descendants the birds) and therapsids; so the only ossicle in their middle ears is the stapes. The mammalian jaw joint is composed of different skull bones, including the dentary (the lower jaw bone which carries the teeth) and the squamosal (another small skull bone). In mammals, the quadrate and articular bones have evolved into the incus and malleus bones in the middle ear. The mammalian middle ear contains three tiny bones known as the ossicles: malleus, incus, and stapes. The ossicles are a complex system of levers whose functions include: reducing the amplitude of the vibrations; increasing the mechanical force of vibrations; and thus improving the efficient transmission of sound energy from the eardrum to the inner ear structures. The ossicles act as the mechanical analog of an electrical transformer, matching the mechanical impedance of vibrations in air to vibrations in the liquid of the cochlea. The net effect of this impedance matching is to greatly increase the overall sensitivity and upper frequency limits of mammalian hearing, as compared to reptilian hearing. The details of these structures and their effects vary noticeably between different mammal species, even when the species are as closely related as humans and chimpanzees. Phylogeny The following simplified cladogram displays relationships between tetrapods: The first fully terrestrial vertebrates were amniotes, which developed in eggs with internal membranes which allowed the developing embryo to breathe but kept water in. The first amniotes arose in the late Carboniferous from the ancestral reptiliomorphs (a group of amphibians whose only living descendants are amniotes). Within a few million years two important amniote lineages became distinct: the synapsid ancestors of mammals, and the sauropsids ancestors of lizards, snakes, crocodilians, dinosaurs and birds. The evolution of mammalian jaw joints and ears did not occur simultaneously with the evolution of other mammalian features. In other words, jaw joints and ears do not define any except the most recent groups of mammals. Mammalian and non-mammalian jaws. In the mammal configuration, the quadrate and articular bones are much smaller and form part of the middle ear. Note that in mammals the lower jaw consists of only the dentary bone. Early tetrapod and amniote ears In modern amniotes (including mammals), the middle ear collects airborne sounds through an eardrum and transmits vibrations to the inner ear via thin cartilaginous and ossified structures. These structures usually include the stapes (a stirrup-shaped auditory ossicle). Early tetrapods likely did not possess eardrums. Eardrums appear to have evolved independently three to six times. In basal members of the 3 major clades of amniotes (synapsids, eureptiles, and parareptiles) the stapes bones are relatively massive props that support the braincase, and this function prevents them from being used as part of the hearing system. However, there is increasing evidence that synapsids, eureptiles and parareptiles developed eardrums connected to the inner ear by stapes during the Permian. Early therapsid jaws and ears The jaws of early synapsids, including the ancestors of mammals, were similar to those of other tetrapods of the time, with a lower jaw consisting of a tooth-bearing dentary bone and several smaller posterior bones. The jaw joint consisted of the articular bone in the lower jaw and the quadrate in the upper jaw. The early pelycosaurs (late Carboniferous and early Permian) likely did not have tympanic membranes (external eardrums). Additionally, their massive stapes bones supported the braincase, with the lower ends resting on the quadrates. Their descendants, the therapsids (including mammalian ancestors), probably had tympanic membranes in contact with the quadrate bones. The stapes remained in contact with the quadrate bone, but functioned as auditory ossicles rather than supports for the brain case. As a result, the quadrate bones of therapsids likely had a dual function in both the jaw joint and auditory system. Twin-jointed jaws Morganucodontidae and other transitional forms had both types of jaw joint: dentary-squamosal (front) and articular-quadrate (rear). During the Permian and early Triassic the dentary of therapsids, including the ancestors of mammals, continually enlarged while other jaw bones were reduced. Eventually, the dentary bone evolved to make contact with the squamosal, a bone in the upper jaw located anterior to the quadrate, allowing two simultaneous jaw joints: an anterior \\"mammalian\\" joint between the dentary and squamosal and a posterior \\"reptilian\\" joint between the quadrate and articular. This \\"twin- jointed jaw\\" can be seen in late cynodonts and early mammaliforms. Morganucodon is one of the first discovered and most thoroughly studied of the mammaliforms, since an unusually large number of morganucodont fossils have been found. It is an example of a nearly perfect evolutionary intermediate between the mammal-like reptiles and extant reptiles.  Early mammals  The earliest mammals were generally small animals, and were likely nocturnal insectivores. This suggests a plausible source of evolutionary pressure: with these small bones in the middle ear, a mammal has extended its range of hearing for higher-pitched sounds which would improve the detection of insects in the dark. The evidence that the malleus and incus are homologous to the reptilian articular and quadrate was originally embryological, and since this discovery an abundance of transitional fossils has both supported the conclusion and given a detailed history of the transition. The evolution of the stapes (from the columella) was an earlier and distinct event. Fossil evidence for mammal-like jaws and ears As the dentary bone of the lower jaw continued to enlarge during the Triassic, the older quadrate-articular joint fell out of use. Some of the bones were lost, but the quadrate, the articular, and the angular bones became free-floating and associated with the stapes. This occurred at least twice in the mammaliformes. The multituberculates had jaw joints that consisted of only the dentary and squamosal bones, and the quadrate and articular bones were part of the middle ear. Other features of their teeth, jaws and skulls are significantly different from those of mammals.  Hadrocodium  In the lineage most closely related to mammals, the jaws of Hadrocodium (about 195M years ago in the very early Jurassic) suggest that it may have been the first to have a nearly fully mammalian middle ear: it lacks the trough at the rear of the lower jaw, over which the eardrum stretched in therapsids and earlier mammaliformes. The absence of this trough suggests that Hadrocodium’s ear was part of the cranium, as it is in mammals, and that the former articular and quadrate had migrated to the middle ear and become the malleus and incus. Hadrocodium’s dentary has a \\"bay\\" at the rear which mammals lack, a hint that the dentary bone retained the same shape as if the articular and quadrate had remained part of the jaw joint. However, several studies have cast doubt on whether Hadrocodium did indeed possess a definitive mammalian middle ear; Hadrocodium likely had an ossified connection between the middle ear and the jaw, which is not visible in the fossil evidence due to limited preservation. Researchers now hypothesize that the definitive mammalian middle ear did not emerge any earlier than the late Jurassic (~163M years ago).  Teinolophos  It has been suggested that a relatively large trough in the jaw bone of the early Cretaceous monotreme Teinolophos provides evidence of a pre-mammalian jaw joint, because therapsids and many mammaliforms had such troughs in which the articular and angular bones \\"docked\\". Thus, Teinolophos had a pre-mammalian middle ear, indicating that the mammalian middle ear ossicles evolved independently in monotremes and in other mammals. A more recent analysis of Teinolophos concluded that the trough was a channel for the large vibration and electrical sensory nerves terminating in the bill (a defining feature of the modern platypus). Thus, the trough is not evidence that Teinolophos had a pre-mammalian jaw joint and a pre-mammalian middle ear.  Yanoconodon  A recently discovered intermediate form is the primitive mammal Yanoconodon, which lived approximately 125 million years ago in the Mesozoic era. Yanoconodon the ossicles have separated from the jaw and serve the hearing function in the middle ear, yet maintain a slender connection to the jaw via the ossified Meckel's cartilage. Maintaining a connection via the ossified Meckel's cartilage may have been evolutionary advantageous since the auditory ossicles were not connected to the cranium in Yanoconodon (as they are in extant mammals), and required structural support via Meckel's cartilage. Effects on hearing The frequency range and sensitivity of the ear is dependent on the shape and arrangement of the middle-ear bones. In the reptilian lineage, hearing depends on the conduction of low-frequency vibrations through the ground or bony structures (such as the columella). By modifying the articular bone, quadrate bone, and columella into small ossicles, mammals were able to hear a wider range of high-frequency airborne vibrations. Hearing within mammals is further aided by a tympanum in the outer ear and newly evolved cochlea in the inner ear.

Overview Operator K-theory resembles topological K-theory more than algebraic K-theory. In particular, a Bott periodicity theorem holds. So there are only two K-groups, namely K0, which is equal to algebraic K0, and K1. As a consequence of the periodicity theorem, it satisfies excision. This means that it associates to an extension of C*-algebras to a long exact sequence, which, by Bott periodicity, reduces to an exact cyclic 6-term-sequence. Operator K-theory is a generalization of topological K-theory, defined by means of vector bundles on locally compact Hausdorff spaces. Here, a vector bundle over a topological space X is associated to a projection in the C* algebra of matrix-valued—that is, M_n(\\\\mathbb{C})-valued—continuous functions over X. Also, it is known that isomorphism of vector bundles translates to Murray-von Neumann equivalence of the associated projection in K ⊗ C(X), where K is the compact operators on a separable Hilbert space. Hence, the K0 group of a (not necessarily commutative) C*-algebra A is defined as Grothendieck group generated by the Murray-von Neumann equivalence classes of projections in K ⊗ C(X). K0 is a functor from the category of C*-algebras and *-homomorphisms, to the category of abelian groups and group homomorphisms. The higher K-functors are defined via a C*-version of the suspension: Kn(A) = K0(Sn(A)), where SA = C0(0,1) ⊗ A. However, by Bott periodicity, it turns out that Kn+2(A) and Kn(A) are isomorphic for each n, and thus the only groups produced by this construction are K0 and K1. The key reason for the introduction of K-theoretic methods into the study of C*-algebras was the Fredholm index: Given a bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space that has finite-dimensional kernel and cokernel, one can associate to it an integer, which, as it turns out, reflects the 'defect' on the operator - i.e. the extent to which it is not invertible. The Fredholm index map appears in the 6-term exact sequence given by the Calkin algebra. In the analysis on manifolds, this index and its generalizations played a crucial role in the index theory of Atiyah and Singer, where the topological index of the manifold can be expressed via the index of elliptic operators on it. Later on, Brown, Douglas and Fillmore observed that the Fredholm index was the missing ingredient in classifying essentially normal operators up to certain natural equivalence. These ideas, together with Elliott's classification of AF C*-algebras via K-theory led to a great deal of interest in adapting methods such as K-theory from algebraic topology into the study of operator algebras. This, in turn, led to K-homology, Kasparov's bivariant KK-theory, and, more recently, Connes and Higson's E-theory.

It can also be made with goat or cow milk. It has a mild salty and tart flavor. When an acidifying agent is used, it resembles queso blanco or paneer. When rennet is used, it resembles buffalo mozzarella. Moisture content can also vary, ranging from almost gelatinous to pressed and firm. It can be eaten as is, paired with bread (usually pandesal), or used in various dishes in Filipino cuisine. It is usually sold wrapped in banana leaves. The name, also spelled quesong puti, is Tagalog for \\"white cheese\\" and is its name in the provinces of Laguna and Bulacan. In Cavite it is known as kesilyo (also kasilyo or quesillo); while in northern Cebu it is known as queseo or kiseyo. Etymology Kesong puti is from Spanish queso (\\"cheese\\") with the Tagalog enclitic suffix -ng, and Tagalog puti (\\"white\\"). In other parts of the Philippines, Caviteño kesilyo or kasilyo and Cebuano queseo or kiseyo, are all nativized spellings of Spanish quesillo (\\"little cheese\\"). Production Kesong putî from the Philippine Carabao Center Most kesong puti is made by direct acidification, similar to numerous other cheeses like queso blanco, paneer, ricotta, mascarpone, and cottage cheese. It is usually made with carabao milk, but it can also use goat or cow milk, though the latter has lower yields. The most common way of making homemade kesong puti is by heating (but not boiling) fresh strained carabao milk with one to four teaspoons of salt for about ten to fifteen minutes while stirring constantly. The ideal temperature is around , as long as it does not reach and above. Higher temperatures will denature the proteins, resulting in slower or even no curdling. This also pasteurizes the milk, destroying pathogens and allowing the cheese to last longer. Around a fourth of a cup of vinegar or citrus juices (or both) are then added to induce coagulation. It is left to curdle for around 30 minutes to an hour. The curds are strained with a cheesecloth (katsa) leaving the soft gelatinous-like version of kesong puti. It can be further pressed and molded to squeeze out more whey if desired. In commercial versions, the salt is usually added after the curdling either through manual mixing or by soaking the cheese in weak brine solutions. An alternate way of making kesong puti is with rennet dissolved in a small amount of water. The rennet can either be vegetable-based or from ruminant stomachs. The steps are similar to the vinegar or citrus method but requires that the milk be cooled after it is taken off the heat, ideally to . This is because rennet is deactivated at higher temperatures, while lower temperatures result in slow or no coagulation. Like in the previous method, it is left to coagulate for 30 minutes to an hour. The curds are strained then cut into small cubes and left to stand for another 15 minutes to allow more moisture to seep out. This method results in more curds and a firmer type of cheese once pressed. It is the method used by the Philippine Carabao Center kesong puti. Kesong puti made with rennet is similar to the Italian mozzarella di bufala. It lacks the sour vinegary smell that usually characterizes the vinegar or citrus versions. Culinary uses Filipino breakfast with kesong puti, pandesal, sinangag (garlic rice), and a longganisa sausage Kesong puti is usually sold wrapped in banana leaves. It has a mildly salty and tart flavor and ideally has little or no odor. It can be eaten as is, either fresh or grilled on a pan. It is also commonly eaten with bread or kakanin rice cakes, including pandesal, puto, and bibingka, It can also be used in various dishes in Filipino cuisine; including dishes like paella negra and ginataang pakô. Kesong puti has a shelf life of only around a week. It depends on the amount of salt used as well as the consistency of the cheese. Softer cheese spoil faster than firmer versions. It can be extended to about two weeks to a month if packaged correctly and refrigerated. However, it should never be frozen as it will form ice crystals that damage the smooth texture. Variants There are four main regions producing variants of kesong puti that probably originated independently: Laguna, Cebu, Cavite, and Bulacan. The following are the most prevalent production techniques for commercial kesong puti among the regions: Laguna Laguna kesong puti or quesong puti is originally from Santa Cruz, Laguna. Its production is centered in the towns of Santa Cruz, Pagsanjan, and Lumban, with the milk used coming from neighboring towns (mostly from Lumban and Jalajala). Laguna kesong puti traditionally use rennet from carabao or cow abomasum. It undergoes lactic acid fermentation during the process. The salt is added afterwards and mixed by hand until the texture becomes smooth. It is similar to the Cebu version and is firmer than the Cavite and Bulacan version. Santa Cruz celebrates an annual Kesong Puti Festival. Cebu Cebu kiseyo cheese Cebuano queseo or kiseyo production is centered on the town of Compostela and the city of Danao. It is very similar to the Laguna version and is made using the same processes. It differs only in that queseo typically use more salt and the molds are lined with muslin cloth. The muslin cloth may be pressed with a weight. It is a fermented cheese and is also usually firm, like the Laguna version. The town of Compostela celebrates an annual Queseo Festival. Cavite Caviteño quesillo, kesilyo, or kasilyo production is centered in the cities of General Trias, Cavite, and Tanza. It uses vinegar as the coagulant. It is not a fermented cheese, unlike the Laguna and Cebu versions. Salt is added to the milk beforehand. A small amount of vinegar is then heated to around in a small clay pot (palayok) and the milk added and stirred until curds form. The curds are strained and molded in small cups and then further soaked in a weak brine solution. The resulting cheese has a softer consistency in comparison to the Laguna and Cebu versions. Bulacan Bulacan kesong puti production is centered in the towns of Santa Maria, Meycauayan, and San Miguel. It is similar to the Caviteño version in that it is not a fermented cheese and primarily use vinegar. It differs in that more vinegar is used and it is not heated while curdling. The curds are molded and then soaked in a weak brine solution.

On 30 September 1928, the Estate Districts of Wintermoor were united with the rural community of Wittenmoor. until December 31 2009, Wintermoor was an independent municipality of the associated Vollenschier district. On June 2009, through a territorial amendment, the municipal council of the municipality of Wintermoor decided the municipality of Wintermoor would be incorporated into the city of Stendal. This agreement was approved by the county lower municipal supervisor and entered into force on January 1st 2010.

It was built in the 13th century by the Margrave Dietrick and named after the river Pleisse which runs nearby. Martin Luther gave the first evangelical sermon in the castle chapel on Pentecost Sunday in 1539. After heavy damage during the siege in the Schmalkaldic War in 1547, the Elector Maurice of Saxony built a fortification with moats. After the Thirty Years War the castle lost its significance and was used as an administrative building and barracks. In the 18th century the newly founded Leipzig Art Academy was based in the Pleissenburg and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe studied here. The naturalist Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius von Tilenau also studied here. The New Town Hall stands today on the site where the Pleissenburg stood.

Carlson et al., “Dara — ܕܪܐ ” in The Syriac Gazetteer last modified June 30, 2014, http://syriaca.org/place/67.) was an important East Roman fortress city in northern Mesopotamia on the border with the Sassanid Empire. Because of its great strategic importance, it featured prominently in the Roman-Persian conflicts (in 530, 540, 544, 573, and 604). The former archbishopric remains a multiple Catholic titular see. Today the Turkish village of Oğuz, Mardin Province, occupies its location.  History = Foundation by Anastasius  During the Anastasian War in 502–506, the Roman armies fared badly against the Sassanid Persians. According to the Syriac Chronicle of Zacharias of Mytilene, the Roman generals blamed their difficulties on the lack of a strong base in the area, as opposed to the Persians, who held the great city of Nisibis (which until its cession in 363 had served the same purpose for the Romans).Zacharias of Mytilene, Syriac Chronicle, Book VII, Chapter VI Therefore, in 505, while the Persian King Kavadh I was distracted in the East, Emperor Anastasius I decided to rebuild the village of Dara, only 18 kilometres westwards from Nisibis and just 5 km from the actual border with Persia, to be \\"a refuge for the army in which they might rest, and for the preparation of weapons, and to guard the country of the Arabs from the inroads of the Persians and Saracens\\". Masons and workers from all over Mesopotamia were gathered and worked with great haste. The new city was built on three hills, on the highest of which stood the citadel, and endowed with great storehouses, a public bath and water cisterns. It took the name Anastasiopolis () and became the seat of the Roman dux Mesopotamiae.  Reconstruction by Justinian  Remains of the cisterns According to Procopius, the hasty construction of the original walls resulted in poor quality, and the severe weather conditions of the region exacerbated the problem, ruining some sections. Thus Byzantine Emperor Justinian I was compelled to undertake extensive repairs to the city, afterwards renaming it Iustiniana Nova.Procopius, De Aedificiis, II.1.11-13 The walls were rebuilt and the inner wall raised by a new storey, doubling its height to about . The towers were strengthened and raised to three stories (ca. 35 m) high, and a moat dug out and filled with water.Procopius, De Aedificiis, II.1.14-21 Justinian's engineers also diverted the nearby river Cordes towards the city by digging a canal. The river now flowed through the city, ensuring ample water supply. At the same time, by means of diverting its flow to an underground channel which exited to the north, the garrison was able to deny water to a besieging enemy, a fact which saved the city on several occasions.Procopius, De Aedificiis, II.2 To avert the danger of flooding, which had already once wrecked large parts of the city, an elaborate arch dam was built to contain it,Procopius, De Aedificiis, II.3.16-21 one of the earliest known of its kind.; ; ; ; In addition, barracks were built for the garrison, and two new churches were constructed, the \\"Great Church\\", and one dedicated to St Bartholomew.Procopius, De Aedificiis, II.3.26  Later history  The city was later besieged and captured by the Persians under Khosrau I in 573-574, but was returned to the Romans by Khosrau II after the Roman-Persian treaty in 590. It was taken again by Khosrau II in 604-05 after a nine-month siege, recovered again for the Roman Empire by Heraclius. Finally captured in 639 by the Arab Muslims, the city then lost its military significance, declined and was eventually abandoned.  Modern history  Dara became the site of massacre during the Armenian Genocide. According to some reports, the cisterns were filled with the bodies of slaughtered Armenians from Diyarbakır, Mardin, and Erzurum in the spring and summer of 1915.  Ecclesiastical history = Archbishopric  The new city became the seat of a Christian bishop and was at first a Metropolitan see, with three suffragans : Rhesaina (also called Theodosiopolis), Rhandus and Nasala.Echos d'Orient X, 1907, pp. 144-145 Its first known bishop was Eutychianus, who took possession in 506. His successor, Thomas, was deposed in 519 for his opposition to the Council of Chalcedon and died in 540. Mamas was removed in 537. Stephanus took part in the Second Council of Constantinople in 553. After the 7th-century Arab conquest, Dara again became the seat of Jacobite (Syriac Orthodox) bishops.Michel Lequien, Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus, Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 997-998, and 1427-1430Raymond Janin, v. Dara in Dictionnaire d'Histoire et de Géographie ecclésiastiques, vol. XIV, Paris 1960, coll. 83-84 In the 10th century, Syriac Orthodox Diocese of Dara lost its Metropolitan rank, which passed to its former suffragan Rhesaina.Echos d'Orient X, 1907, p. 96 No longer a residential bishopric, Dara is now listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see, both Latin and in particular for the Syriac Catholic Church, which, though of the West Syriac Rite, is in full communion with the Holy See.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, ), p. 879  Titular Latin see  The diocese was nominally restored in the 15th century as the Latin Catholic titular bishopric of Dara. As such, it has the following incumbents, all of the lowest (episcopal) rank : * Hubert Léonard, Carmelite Order (O. Carm.)

Sackeim is an American psychologist and proponent of electroconvulsive therapy.

He received his Bachelor's degree from Columbia in 1972; in 1974, he received his Master's degree from Oxford University; and in 1977 he received his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania. Sackeim is co-author of more than 300 publications relating to electroconvulsive therapy. Until 2007 all of his research expounded on its positive effects. For many years he denied that electroconvulsive therapy had any permanent or negative side effects, including memory loss, despite the many complaints of individuals who had undergone the procedure. Finally, in 2007, his research found that excessive electrical dosage correlated with risk of memory loss. For many years during his research of electroconvulsive therapy, Sackheim consulted for MECTA and Somatics, companies that manufacture devices for its administration, constituting what many consider a conflict of interest. In 2007 Sackeim and his colleagues published the results of a study which followed 250 patients who had received electroconvulsive therapy. The study found that the various techniques used when giving electroconvulsive therapy can have a direct impact on the adverse effects experienced by patients. Sackeim and colleagues later demonstrated that right unilateral electroconvulsive therapy with an ultra brief pulse appears to be the most efficacious, while remaining the least likely to cause adverse effects.'Effects of Pulse Width and Electrode Placement on the Efficacy and Cognitive Effects of Electroconvulsive Therapy', Sackeim et al, 'Brain Stimulation', 2008.

During his career, he won the Icelandic championship three times and the Icelandic Cup four times. After retiring from playing, he became a well-known manager. In 1999, he guided Knattspyrnufélag Reykjavíkur to its first championship in 31 years. Atli played 70 games for the Icelandic national team from 1976 to 1991. He later coached the national team from 1999 to 2003. Club career Atli started at Valur and later became very successful in the German Bundesliga with Fortuna Düsseldorf and Bayer Uerdingen. On 6 June 1983, he became the first foreign player to score a five goals in one game in the Bundesliga, when he scored five goals for Fortuna Düsseldorf in a 5–1 victory against Eintracht Frankfurt. After the game, he took a flight to Iceland where he scored the winning goal in Iceland's 1–0 victory against Malta the following day. For the season, he scored 21 goals in 34 matches for Düsseldorf, finishing second in the league. After a year in Turkey, he finished his playing career back in Iceland, where he became player-manager. International career He made his debut for Iceland in 1976 and went on to win 70 caps, scoring eight goals and captaining the team 31 times. He played his last international match in a September 1991 friendly game against Denmark. After Ásgeir Elíasson became Iceland's manager in 1991, he announced that Atli was not in the future plans of the team. At the time he was Iceland's record cap. Manager years After his playing days ended, Atli went on to manage three Icelandic club teams before taking the helm at the national team in 1999 where he stayed for four years. On 4 July 2009, Atli was appointed manager of Úrvalsdeild karla club Valur until the end of the season. He last coached Hamar in the 4. deild karla in 2018. Roger Hollis case Chapman Pincher alleged that Atli is the owner of certain documents that might add further weight to the case against Roger Hollis, that Hollis was a Russian spy at the head of MI-5 in the UK. As Pincher, who died in 2014, stated \\"I have been unable to extract a copy of the interrogation report from Atli\\", p. 603\\\\. The interrogation report is alleged by Pincher to have been written by his deceased father, Evald Mikson . Personal life Atli was the younger brother of former international player Jóhannes Eðvaldsson. His father, Evald Mikson (Icelandic: Eðvald Hinriksson), was a goalkeeper in the Estonian national football team between 1934 and 1938. Mikson was the Tallinn chief of police during the German occupation of Estonia during World War II. Atli's daughter Sif Atladóttir is a member of the women's national football team. Illness and death In December 2018, he revealed in an interview with RÚV that he had been battling a serious illness for two years and that initially the doctors only gave him two weeks to live. On 2 September 2019, Atli died from cancer.

Throughout the record, the words \\"things get a little easier/ once you understand\\" are repeated. The song ends abruptly as a policeman calls the father with the news that his 17-year-old son is dead from an overdose. \\"Once You Understand\\" started getting airplay in late 1971, hitting #1 at stations KQV in Pittsburgh and WIXY in Cleveland; nationally, it made it to No. 23 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in early 1972, even though some stations banned the song for its reference to drugs.Joel Whitburn, The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits. 7th edn, 2000 The flip side of the single, \\"Gather\\" is a poem sung about life being short. (In later decades, \\"Once You Understand\\" was often sampled by hip hop artists.) The song also peaked at number 76 in Australia. The record was re-released in early 1974 and peaked at No. 53 on the Billboard Hot 100. Later releases Laurie released another single from Think, \\"It's Not The World, It's The People\\" b/w \\"Who Are You To Tell Me What To Do\\", as well as an album, Encounter \\"Once You Understand\\", but neither was a hit. Stallman later produced a series of educational albums (such as Pre-Drivers' Education Through Music) in the 1970s, while Susser, who had previously helmed recordings by such artists as Trini Lopez and Robert John, has had a fruitful career recording children's songs.

Goss served in the Royal Navy during World War I, and played football for the naval side. On leaving the navy, he joined the staff of Southampton F.C. as assistant secretary to Ernest Arnfield, taking over as secretary on Arnfield's retirement. Following Jimmy McIntyre's surprise resignation as a manager in December 1924, Goss assumed responsibility for team affairs under the supervision of the board of directors for the remainder of the season, continuing into the following season until Arthur Chadwick took over the manager's position in October 1925. During the period when he was acting as manager, the Saints embarked on a run in the FA Cup, defeating Liverpool in round 4, to reach the semi-final at Stamford Bridge, where they were defeated 2-0 by Sheffield United on 28 March 1925. In the semi-final Tom Parker had a dreadful afternoon, first scoring an own-goal, then suffering a rare miss from the penalty spot (shooting straight at the 'keeper) before a mix-up between him and goalkeeper Tommy Allen gave Sheffield their second goal. In June 1936, the club was suffering severe financial difficulties, and the entire board of directors resigned. The new board of directors asked manager George Kay to leave in order to trim the payroll, and in August Kay moved on to Liverpool, taking long-serving trainer Bert Shelley with him. Goss then combined the roles of secretary and manager, with club captain Johnny McIlwaine taking on the role of assistant manager. Following the upheavals in the boardroom, the club was able to raise sufficient finances to purchase new players, most prominent of whom was the former Irish international forward Jimmy Dunne who was signed from Arsenal for £1000. The 1936–37 season was not an outstanding success and Saints struggled to avoid relegation from Division 2. On 16 January 1937, Saints played Sunderland in a First round FA Cup tie. Although Saints lost 2–3, this game was attended by a crowd of 30,380 which remained an all-time record attendance at The Dell. By March, Goss and McIlwaine were feeling the pressure and Goss resigned his position as manager and in March 1937 was replaced by former Saints and Arsenal player Tom Parker. At the end of the season Goss left the club completely, after over 13 years service, initially to run the Railway Hotel in St Denys. On the outbreak of World War II he re-joined the Royal Navy, taking command of a minesweeper before settling in Australia.

DNA is initially transcribed into a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule. The mRNA is then translated into a protein. (See Central dogma of molecular biology.) mRNA structure, approximately to scale for a human mRNA In molecular genetics, an untranslated region (or UTR) refers to either of two sections, one on each side of a coding sequence on a strand of mRNA. If it is found on the 5' side, it is called the 5' UTR (or leader sequence), or if it is found on the 3' side, it is called the 3' UTR (or trailer sequence). mRNA is RNA that carries information from DNA to the ribosome, the site of protein synthesis (translation) within a cell. The mRNA is initially transcribed from the corresponding DNA sequence and then translated into protein. However, several regions of the mRNA are usually not translated into protein, including the 5' and 3' UTRs. Although they are called untranslated regions, and do not form the protein-coding region of the gene, uORFs located within the 5' UTR can be translated into peptides. The 5' UTR is upstream from the coding sequence. Within the 5' UTR is a sequence that is recognized by the ribosome which allows the ribosome to bind and initiate translation. The mechanism of translation initiation differs in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The 3' UTR is found immediately following the translation stop codon. The 3' UTR plays a critical role in translation termination as well as post-transcriptional modification. These often long sequences were once thought to be useless or junk mRNA that has simply accumulated over evolutionary time. However, it is now known that the untranslated region of mRNA is involved in many regulatory aspects of gene expression in eukaryotic organisms. The importance of these non-coding regions is supported by evolutionary reasoning, as natural selection would have otherwise eliminated this unusable RNA. It is important to distinguish the 5' and 3' UTRs from other non-protein-coding RNA. Within the coding sequence of pre-mRNA, there can be found sections of RNA that will not be included in the protein product. These sections of RNA are called introns. The RNA that results from RNA splicing is a sequence of exons. The reason why introns are not considered untranslated regions is that the introns are spliced out in the process of RNA splicing. The introns are not included in the mature mRNA molecule that will undergo translation and are thus considered non-protein- coding RNA.  History  The untranslated regions of mRNA became a subject of study as early as the late 1970s, after the first mRNA molecule was fully sequenced. In 1978, the 5' UTR of the human gamma-globin mRNA was fully sequenced. In 1980, a study was conducted on the 3' UTR of the duplicated human alpha-globin genes.  Evolution  The untranslated region is seen in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, although the length and composition may vary. In prokaryotes, the 5' UTR is typically between 3 and 10 nucleotides long. In eukaryotes, the 5' UTR can be hundreds to thousands of nucleotides long. This is consistent with the higher complexity of the genomes of eukaryotes compared to prokaryotes. The 3' UTR varies in length as well. The poly-A tail is essential for keeping the mRNA from being degraded. Although there is variation in lengths of both the 5' and 3' UTR, it has been seen that the 5' UTR length is more highly conserved in evolution than the 3' UTR length.  Prokaryotes  The 5' UTR of Prokaryotes consists of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (5'-AGGAGGU-3'). This sequence is found 3-10 base pairs upstream from the initiation codon. The initiation codon is the start site of translation into protein.  Eukaryotes  The 5' UTR of Eukaryotes is more complex than prokaryotes. It contains a Kozak consensus sequence (ACCAUGG). This sequence contains the initiation codon. The initiation codon is the start site of translation into protein.  Links to disease  The importance of these untranslated regions of mRNA is just beginning to be understood. Various medical studies are being conducted that have found connections between mutations in untranslated regions and increased risk for developing a particular disease, such as cancer. For example, associations between polymorphisms in the HLA-G 3′UTR region and development of colorectal cancer have been discovered. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in the 3' UTR of another gene have also been associated with susceptibility to preterm birth. Mutations in the 3' UTR of the APP gene are related to development of cerebral amyloid angiopathy.  Further study  Through the recent study of untranslated regions, general information has been gathered about the nature and function of these elements. However, there is still much that is unknown about these regions of mRNA. Since the regulation of gene expression is critical in the proper function of cells, this is an area of study that needs to be investigated further. It is important to consider that mutations in 3' untranslated regions have the potential to alter the expression of several genes that may appear unrelated. We are only beginning to understand the links between proper untranslated region function, and disease states of cells.

Tradition  According to the myth, this flower blooms for a very short time on the eve of the summer solstice (celebrated on June 21 or sometimes July 7) The flower brings fortune to the person who finds it. In various versions of the tale, the fern flower brings luck, wealth, or the ability to understand animal speech. However, the flower is closely guarded by evil spirits and anyone who finds the flower will have access to earthly riches, which have never benefited anyone, so the decision to pick the flower or leave it alone is left up to the individual.  Slavic tradition =Russian, Ukrainian, Belarus and Polish tradition Fern flower on a commemorative coin of the National Bank of Belarus In Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Poland, the holiday is practiced on the eve of Ivan Kupala Day.Midsummer celebration (Celebration of Ivan Kupala Day) Young girls wear wreaths in their hair and couples go into the woods searching for the fern flower. When they come out of the woods, if the male is wearing the girl's wreath, it means the couple is engaged to be married. According to folklore, the flower is chervona ruta. The flower is yellow, but according to legend, it turns red on the eve of Ivan Kupala Day.  Traditions in the Baltic and Nordic countries =Baltic and Estonian-Finnish tradition In the Estonian, Lithuanian and Latvian tradition, the fern flower is supposed to appear only on the night of 23 to 24 June during the celebration of the summer solstice which is called Jāņi in Latvia, Joninės or Rasos in Lithuania, Jaaniõhtu or Jaaniöö in Estonia and juhannus in Finland. The celebration has pre-Christian origins.  Swedish tradition  Similar beliefs are attested in Sweden, where the fern flower was said to be found only at midnight on Midsummer's Eve, and even then was protected by magic and thus hard to obtain. This also applied to horsetail and daphne flowers; of daphne, a flowering plant, it was said: \\"The flowers are a rarity if picked on nights when they are believed to bloom. The naturally occurring flowers no one believes to be daphne flowers.\\"\\"Blommor äro en raritet om de tagas de nätter de tros blomma. De blommor som äro naturliga tror ingen vara tibastblommor.\\" Ericsson, Folklivet i Åkers och Rekarne härader, p. 251.  Blooming ferns  A \\"fertile frond\\" of a true fern is not really a flower at all. In fact, ferns are not flowering plants. However some experts think that the flowering fern myth has roots in reality. In the past, the grouping of plants was not as exact as modern taxonomic ones. Numerous flowering plants resemble ferns, or have fern- like foliage, and some of them indeed open flowers during night time.\\"Saint John's Wreaths and Fern Flower\\" Also, certain true ferns, e.g., Osmunda regalis have sporangia in tight clusters (termed \\"fertile fronds\\"), which may appear in flower-like clusters, and as a result, they are commonly known as \\"flowering ferns\\".

Most of the civilian killings was conducted by the Mahdi Army who were seeking to purge the Sunni population of Baghdad. The offensive coincided with a Coalition operation called Together Forward which was to significantly reduce the violence in Baghdad which had seen a sharp uprise since the mid- February 2006 bombing of the Askariya Mosque, a major Shia Muslim shrine, in Samarra. However, the operation failed. Moreover, the insurgents managed take control of more than 80 percent of Baghdad. Also insurgents made huge gains in the western Al Anbar and southern Babil province, forcing Coalition and Iraqi security forces from many towns and cities. This period also saw the battle of Amarah, during which rogue Mahdi Army fighters fought with the police, who were members of the Badr Organisation, for control of the southern city of Amarah.

Written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, \\"Worried About You\\" is slow ballad first produced for 1975's Black and Blue. This is most evident with the song's guitar solo contributed by Wayne Perkins, an early contender for the lead guitarist spot left open after the departure of Mick Taylor. Like some songs for Black and Blue, \\"Worried About You\\" was recorded in Rotterdam, Netherlands, using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Overdubs were performed in Montreux, Switzerland, as well as later in 1981 in New York City. With Jagger on lead vocals (using a falsetto voice like the earlier released, later recorded \\"Emotional Rescue\\") with Richards providing prominent harmony vocals during the chorus, Perkins and Richards perform guitars. Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman perform drums and bass, respectively. Billy Preston, a heavy contributor to Stones albums during the 1970s, performs electric piano. A simple performance music video was produced in support of the song. The song was billed as \\"Worried 'Bout You\\" in the video. It is notable for showing Ronnie Wood, the eventual choice for the Stones' lead guitarist, performing Perkins' solo (similar to the videos for \\"Waiting on a Friend\\" and \\"Hot Stuff\\", which were actually played by Mick Taylor and Harvey Mandel respectively). Also, Jagger is seen performing electric piano rather than Billy Preston (not featured in the video). The song was first performed by the Stones during the two shows at the \\"El Mocambo Club\\" in Canada, March 4–5, 1977. It was also played throughout the 200203 Licks Tour, with one captured performance being released on the 2004 live album Live Licks. It would again be performed during the 2006 leg of the A Bigger Bang Tour and in 2013 during the 50 & Counting... Tour. During concerts, the keyboard parts are performed by Jagger and Chuck Leavell. The song was featured in \\"Mars vs. Mars\\", an episode of the television series Veronica Mars.

Number 125 in the designation stands for the 125 mm A555 smoothbore tank gun. It is now designated P-125 (P stands for Prototype). History In the late 1970s - early 1980s, Romania ordered 30 T-72M main battle tanks from the USSR. The Romanian government asked USSR for a license to build T-72 tanks locally.Ceausescu and the Soviet Military Licenses (in Romanian, from Jurnalul.ro) Rebuffed by the Soviet leaders, the communist government decided to reverse-engineer the T-72 tank. The tank was developed from 1984 to 1991. The turret and the loading mechanism were developed by ICSITEM research institute from Bucharest, while the chassis was designed by ACSIT–P 124 from the F.M.G.S. (FMGS stands for \\"Fabrica de Mașini Grele Speciale\\" - Special Heavy Equipment Factory) division of the \\"23rd August\\" (now known as FAUR) factory from Bucharest.

It used an old DShK machine gun for anti-aircraft purposes and was fitted with extra armour. The 125mm A555 smoothbore tank gun was developed by Arsenal Reșița factory. As a result of these changes the tank's weight increased from 41.5 tonnes (T-72M) to around 50 tonnes. Operators * - The exact number varies according to the source: 3, 5 or 10 prototypes.

It was founded by a group of Harvard Business School and MIT graduates including Warren Adams and Brian Robertson. Their company, Sage Enterprises, was based in Cambridge, Massachusetts and was the winner of the 1996 New Business of the Year Award from the Cambridge Chamber of Commerce. Background PlanetAll was possibly the first social networking site on the Internet. The site had more than 100,000 groups, organized around real-world counterparts such as academic institutions and employers. When the user entered the name of his or her university, the service would list the user's classmates who were also members of the service. Users could exchange authorization to access each other's contacts. Many sites at the time offered web-based address books and calendars, but PlanetAll.com combined the two: when a user entered travel plans into the calendar, the service would cross- reference the destination with the address book, as well as the user's contacts' travel plans; the site would then notify users when they would cross paths with their contacts. On August 4, 1998, Amazon.com announced that it had agreed to acquire PlanetAll. Under terms of the agreement, Amazon.com acquired 100 percent of PlanetAll in exchange for 800,000 shares.Amazon.com buys Junglee, PlanetAll - Silicon Valley / San Jose Business Journal: Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos said, \\"PlanetAll is the most innovative use of the Internet I've seen. It's simply a breakthrough in doing something as fundamental and important as staying in touch. The reason PlanetAll has over 1.5 million members—and is growing even faster than the Internet—is simple: it creates extraordinary value for its users. I believe PlanetAll will prove to be one of the most important online applications.\\" Less than two years later, Amazon.com shut down PlanetAll.com. On July 2, 2000, they told PlanetAll members, \\"We are pleased to announce that we have completed the integration of the key e-commerce related features of PlanetAll.com into our main site at Amazon.com ... Although PlanetAll.com will be going away, you'll still be able to enjoy some of the tools that help you keep in touch with like-minded folks.\\" Amazon's \\"Purchase Circles\\" feature was based on PlanetAll, and some of PlanetAll code was used to improve Amazon's Friends and Favorites area. The only calendar feature that appears to have remained, however, is the date reminder. Amazon spokeswoman Patty Smith said after Amazon had absorbed the technology, it did not see the need to maintain PlanetAll. \\"It seemed really superfluous to have it running beside Friends and Favorites,\\" she said. Many of the 1.5 million members were upset by the loss of the utility; one internet journalist wrote later that year that she was \\"in mourning\\" for the service. Social Networking Patent On June 15, 2010, the United States Patent and Trademark Office awarded Amazon.com a patent for \\"Social Networking System\\" based on its ownership of PlanetAll. The patent describes a Social Networking System as > A networked computer system provides various services for assisting users in > locating, and establishing contact relationships with, other users. For > example, in one embodiment, users can identify other users based on their > affiliations with particular schools or other organizations. The system also > provides a mechanism for a user to selectively establish contact > relationships or connections with other users, and to grant permissions for > such other users to view personal information of the user. The system may > also include features for enabling users to identify contacts of their > respective contacts. In addition, the system may automatically notify users > of personal information updates made by their respective contacts.

Operational history The fifth ship to be named Nightingale by the Navy, YMS-290 was built by the Associated Shipbuilding Co., Seattle, Washington, as YMS–290; launched 27 February 1943; sponsored by Miss Suzanne Marion, granddaughter of A. F. Marion, General Manager of Lake Union Drydock and Machine Works; and commissioned 17 July 1943. After shakedown and training in Puget Sound, she departed for the western Pacific Ocean via Pearl Harbor. Throughout World War II she operated exclusively in the Pacific. She participated in the Gilbert Islands operations 13 November through 8 December, and continued minesweeping operations until the end of hostilities. YMS-290 was then assigned to minesweeping activities in the Kobe-Fukuoka area of Japan. Returning from Japanese waters YMS-290 reached Boston, Massachusetts, and was assigned to the 1st Naval District as a Naval Reserve Training ship. On 1 September 1947 the ship was renamed Nightingale and reclassified to AMS–50. She continued as a Naval Reserve training ship until March 1950, when she put in at Green Cove Springs, Florida, and decommissioned. Nightingale recommissioned February 1951 and served with the Mine Force, Atlantic Fleet. She operated out of Charleston, South Carolina, providing service along the U.S. East Coast from Yorktown, Virginia, to Panama City, Florida.

Film Market) is the business counterpart of the Cannes Film Festival and one of the largest film markets in the world.Marché du Film intro Cannes Festival website. Established in 1959, it is held annually in conjunction with the Festival de Cannes. With 12,500 participants from 121 different countries, more than 4,000 films and projects were presented in 2019. History=1950 Before the Marché du Film was created, no space was allocated to production houses representatives. As a result, they started to rent Antibes cinema rooms to show their films and organise the trade of cinematic rights. In 1950, Robert Favre Le Bret, Executive Director of the Festival de Cannes, suggested to include this parallel market in the Festival de Cannes. Unfortunately, his suggestion was rejected. The Marché du Film was finally created in 1959, by two members of the “Chambre Syndicale des Producteurs de Film Français” (lit. Trade Union Chamber of French Film Producers), Émile Natan and Bertrand Bagge, under the authorisation of Robert Favre Le Bret and Minister of Culture André Malraux. Émile Natan and Bertrand Bagge wanted to take advantage of the international influence that the festival was starting to have by arranging screenings of French Films for the professionals and therefore expand business opportunities for the French Film Industry. 1970 In 1979, the Cannes city council decided to build a new Palais des Festival et des Congrès in response to the growing success of the film festival. The new building, a six-story building designed by architects Sir Hubert Bennett and François Druet, was constructed on the site of the municipal Casino at the top of blvd. de la Croisette, east of the port. That same year, Marcel Lathière, the new director of the market was in charge of the move to the “Palais”. This new building allowed the market to expand the number of screening rooms from 4 to 10 while welcoming a larger number of booths. 1980 In 1980, L’Association du Festival (lit. the festival association) decided to establish the Secrétariat Général du Marché du Film (lit. General Secretariat of the film market) with Michel Bonnet and Marcel Lathière in charge. They started to slowly set up the Marché du Film by introducing fares for films subscriptions and booth rentals for professionals. In 1982, the new \\"Palais des Festival et des Congrès\\" was inaugurated. By 1989, the market reached more than 2000 exhibitors and 600 screenings 1990 In November 1995, Jérome Paillard became Executive Director and continued the expansion of the Marché. His goal was particularly to enlarge the Marché to all the companies including those in the hotels and apartments. In 1996, the Marché du Film launched \\"The Guide\\": a printed guide which provided attendees a full index of participants and gathered all the information in one publication. In 1997, \\"The Guide” became available on CD- ROM and finally turned into an online database in 1999. This database is what preceded Cinando. 2000 The Riviera building opened in 2000 adding 10 000 m² to the Palais des Festival et des Congrès. This new building allowed the Marché du Film to have more screening rooms as well as more space for the sales companies to be represented. International attendance at the Marché Over the years, the Marché du Film's international influence has grown and professionals from the film industry from all continents attend. The three main countries present at the Marché du Film 2019 edition are: the United States (2,264), France (1,943) and the United Kingdom (1,145).

June 1906 Bank Leu AG (pronounced \\"Loy,\\" as in toy) was a Swiss private bank that existed from 1755 to 2007. Headquartered in Zurich, it was a subsidiary of Credit Suisse from 1990. In 2007, it was merged with that company's other private banking units as Clariden Leu. At the time, it was Switzerland's oldest bank. The bank was founded in 1758 as Leu et Compagnie, named after its founder, Johann Jacob Leu, who later became mayor of Zurich. Originally a state-owned bank, it was privatized in 1798 after Napoleon conquered Switzerland; the bank's officials did not want its assets to be taken over by Napoleon's new client state, the Helvetic Republic. In 1854, it incorporated as Leu & Co. after more than a century as a limited partnership. It became a public limited company () in 1969. Despite having many distinguished customers over the years (at one point, it was Maria Theresa's banker), two major scandals in the 1980s eventually cost the bank its independence. U.S. insider trading scandal Bank Leu's Bahamian subsidiary, Bank Leu International, was used by Dennis Levine to handle most of his insider trades. From 1981 to 1986, Levine built up his account to over $10 million USD, trading on information he acquired based on his work as an investment banker. Levine took advantage of the Bahamas' strict bank secrecy laws (which forbid the disclosure of any information about a customer's banking relationship) to cloak his activities. Bank Leu itself had a long tradition of secrecy, and its Bahamian branch had a reputation for accepting deposits from anyone, no questions asked. However, unknown to Levine, his account manager in Nassau and several bank employees (including the bank's manager) copied several of his trades in order to make their own profits off Levine's information. This practice, called \\"piggybacking,\\" was not illegal in and of itself unless the piggybacker knows or has reason to know that the trader he is copying is acting on illegally obtained information. However, Bank Leu officials knew soon after Levine opened his account that he was trading almost entirely on inside information. Even without this to consider, the practice was contrary to Bank Leu policy. As a result of their piggybacking, Bank Leu employees made a tidy profit of their own off Levine's trades. More seriously, Bank Leu steered a large number of trades through a broker at Merrill Lynch's office in Caracas. He himself piggybacked the trades for his own benefit, and the volume led one of his colleagues to get suspicious. The colleague wrote a letter to Merrill Lynch's compliance unit, whose internal investigation led to Bank Leu. Unfortunately, the broker had by this time moved onto another company, and there was no way for Merrill Lynch to pierce the offshore veil. The matter was thus passed on to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Bank officials suggested that Levine come up with reasons to justify the trades. However, they also forged or destroyed many documents related to Levine's activity—thus opening them to charges of obstruction of justice. Their story fell apart when noted attorney Harvey Pitt, whom the bank had retained, noticed a huge gap between the actual statements of the bank's managed accounts and the omnibus records. At that point, the bank decided to cooperate with the SEC. Bahamian Attorney General Paul Adderly issued an opinion that stock trading was separate from normal banking transactions, and thus was not subject to the bank secrecy laws. The bank was thus free to reveal Levine's name, and he was arrested soon afterward. Despite the bank's cooperation, Bahamian regulators forced corporate headquarters in Zurich to fire the entire board of the Bahamian branch as a condition of being allowed to stay in business in the Bahamas. Involvement in Distillers Company deal In 1986, Guinness PLC was in the midst of a bidding war for the much larger Distillers Company. In the closing stages, Guinness' stock rose 25 percent—which was unusual, since the stock of the acquiring company usually falls in a takeover situation. Guinness paid several people and institutions, most notably American arbitrageur Ivan Boesky, about $38 million USD to buy $300 USD million worth of Guinness stock. The effect was to increase the value of its offer for Distillers, whose management favored merging with Guinness. In the course of the investigation, it emerged that Bank Leu was involved in half of the purchases. Two of Guinness' directors signed under-the-table agreements in which Bank Leu subsidiaries in Zug and Lucerne bought 41 million Guinness shares. Guinness secretly promised to redeem the shares at cost, including commissions. To fulfill its end of the bargain, Guinness deposited $76 million with Bank Leu's Luxembourg subsidiary. Merger with Credit Suisse Bank Leu's involvement in two major financial scandals seriously hurt its reputation, and in September 1990, it agreed to merge with Credit Suisse. Shortly after the merger closed, it came out that the credit officer of its Duebendorf office made fake loans in the name of legitimate clients, and then shared the proceeds with what was called \\"the Zurich financial underworld.\\" The scheme cost Bank Leu an estimated 63 million CHFs (roughly $50 million USD). Bank Leu was reorganized in 1997 as an \\"independent private bank,\\" integrating its branch network in Zurich as well as its corporate banking business with Credit Suisse. In 2007, it merged with Credit Suisse Fides and Credit Suisse's other three private banks—Clariden, Bank Hofmann, and Banca di Gestione Patrimoniale—to form Clariden Leu.

A native of Hato Mayor Province, he played professionally under the name Porfi Jiménez. Jiménez' father died when he was three years old, and his mother gave him a trumpet when he turned eight. He began playing the instrument at school in 1940, turning himself into a professional musician two years later. Jiménez was 26 years old when he arrived in Caracas, the capital city of Venezuela. He started to play with orchestras led by Rafael Minaya, Pedro José Belisario and Chucho Sanoja, as well as for the Billo's Caracas Boys. In the early 1960s, he became noted for his arrangements for bolero singers Felipe Pirela and Blanca Rosa Gil. He started his own Latin music dance band in 1963. With lead vocalists Kiko Mendive and Chico Salas, Jimenez' orchestra made its recording debut on the \\"Velvet\\" label. He made several albums for them in the late 1960s and mid 1970s, and helped popularize the salsa rage.Sacven Jiménez enjoyed a huge success in the mid 1980s while recording for \\"Sonografica\\" label, with albums combining salsa, cumbia, and his native Dominican merengue. Some of his most popular songs include La negra Celina, Se hunde el barco, Dolores and Culu Cucú, which reached number one on the Colombian, Dominican and Venezuelan Hit Parade charts. Beside this, he conducted a 17-piece Jazz orchestra to promote the big band tradition by featuring his own repertoire and selected works of Thad Jones, Chico O'Farrill, among others. In January 2007 Jiménez was honored in New York City by the United Nations Orchestra, created by Dizzy Gillespie, for his long and storied career in Latin music.United Nations homage Jiménez died in Caracas at the age of 82 on June 8, 2010.El- Nacional.com – Obituary Discography Esto es ritmo 1964 • Porfi y Su Conjunto Ritmico Únicamente tú 1964 • Felipe Pirela & Porfi Jiménez y Su Orquesta A bailar con Porfi 1966 Ron con coco 1966 Pata-pata con ¡Porfi! 1967 Y el negro ahi! 1967 Orquesta Porfi Jiménez: Canta Felipe Pirela 1967 • Felipe Pirela & Porfi Jiménez y Su Orquesta Casatshok Latin Soul 1968 Por fin Porfi 1968 Rate La machaca 1972 Así soy yo 1973 El rico sabor de Porfi Jiménez y Su Orquesta 1974 Cortando cabezas 1977 20 Años 1985 Porfi '85 1985 Bula bula 1988 Ululukukulala 1989 Parrandeando con la trigueña hermosa! 1990 • Porfi Jimenez y Su Orquesta Parrandeando Como siempre 1992 Sources * In Spanish Category:1928 births Category:2010 deaths Category:Dominican Republic emigrants to Venezuela Category:Dominican Republic musicians Category:People from Caracas Category:People from Hato Mayor Province Category:Venezuelan bandleaders ","title":"Porfi Jiménez"},{"id":"13314813","text":"The meningeal branch of the vagus nerve is one of the first branches of the vagus nerve at the level of the superior ganglion.

Biography Jochen Fahrenberg studied psychology, sociology and philosophy in Freiburg, London and Hamburg, followed by a PhD at the University of Freiburg. His dissertation was based on an experimental investigation and factor analysis of writing movement parameters (graphometry). After working as a research assistant to cardiologist Professor Ludwig Delius in Bad Oeynhausen, he completed his postdoctoral thesis (habilitation) on Psychophysiological personality research in Freiburg in 1966. Together with Dr. med. Michael Myrtek, he founded the Freiburg Psychophysiology Research Group in 1970 with funding from the Volkswagen Foundation. In 1973, he was offered the Chair at the Psychology Department previously held by his academic teacher, the philosopher and psychologist Robert Heiß, founder of the Freiburg Institute. During the following decades he was involved in the Institute's considerable expansion as well as academic reform. In 2002, as professor emeritus, he retired from his dual function as head of the Personality Research section and co-director of the Psychophysiology Research Group in the Department of Psychology at Albert-Ludwigs-University in Freiburg, Germany. Research During its 35-year history, the Psychophysiology Research Group was a centre for multivariate psychophysiological research on personality, research on cardiovascular rehabilitation, illness behaviour, and life satisfaction. The laboratory was generously supported by the Volkswagen Foundation (with eight scientific and technical staff, two computer-based electrophysiological labs and a clinical-chemistry lab). The research group also developed and promoted both methodology and techniques of ambulatory monitoring (ambulatory assessment) to assist behavioural research in everyday situations. A number of tests and personality scales were developed, one of which, the Freiburg Personality Inventory (FPI), comparable to the 16 PF Questionnaire, is the most frequently used in German-speaking countries. A series of extensive laboratory analyses and field research was conducted focusing on cardiovascular psychophysiology, in particular. Hans Eysenck's Theory of Emotionality (emotional lability, neuroticism), which was generally accepted at that time, was critically tested in a number of experimental and clinical studies. The findings contradicted the assumed (hypothetical) correlation between specific personality factors (questionnaire scales) and autonomic lability (hyperreactivity of the autonomic nervous system). A second focus of his research was Ambulant Assessment (ambulatory monitoring): psychophysiological examinations under everyday conditions, also during work and leisure periods, with multi-channel digital systems for recording behavioural, physiological and subjective data. The research group's list of publications consists of more than 400 references (Fahrenberg & Myrtek, 2005); the most important research data have been collected and made available (open access). His later work was devoted to other areas: psychological anthropology – including surveys on student attitudes and belief systems, or assumptions about human nature and the impact of philosophical concepts on professional issues – the philosophy of science, methodology, categories in psychology; and theoretical psychology. In addition, a number of books and articles were written about Wilhelm Wundt, a pioneer of modern psychology. Fahrenberg initiated the Workshop for Psychophysiological Methods in 1972, which became the German Society for Psychophysiology and its Application in 1982. Workshops on ambulatory assessment in Freiburg led to the founding of the international Society for Ambulatory Assessment in 2009.

This leaves the term \\"systems: theory\\", which is not the same as a type of systems theory. The following more than 40 types of systems theory are all explicitly named systems theory and represent a unique conceptual framework in a specific field of science. Systems theory has been formalized since the 1950s, and a long set of specialized systems theories and cybernetics exist. In the beginnings, general systems theory was developed by Ludwig von Bertalanffy to overcome the over-specialisation of the modern times and as a worldview using holism. The systems theories nowadays are closer to the traditional specialisation than to holism, by interdependencies and mutual division by mutually-different specialists.Matjaž Mulej (2006), \\"Systems, Cybernetics and Innovations\\", in: Kybernetics, Vol 35 No. 7/8, pp. 939–940.

Dent studied forms of systems theory and came up with a set of concepts that he thought marked off systems theory approaches from earlier science. Dent identified eight concepts: :* holism rather than analysis or reductionism, :* relationships rather than entities, :* interaction with environment as opposed to closed or isolated systems, :* indeterminism as opposed to predictability, :* circular causal loops rather than linear causality, :* self-organization, observation as part of or directly related to systems, and :* reflexivity or interaction between a system and what is known about it. * Holistic Symmetry in Modern Science, webtext by Gary Witherspoon, 3 April 2007. : Witherspoon states, that \\"the rise of abstract art and the development of various systems theories have an important parallel. Abstract art goes beyond the recognition of entity or image and focuses attention on interaction and interrelatedness, striving to uncover and reveal holistic essences. Systems theories have tried to get us beyond linear cause and effect notions and tried to get us to think of phenomena in terms of interaction and interrelationship. It is interesting and significant that abstract art and quantum theory arose at about the same time. Both of these developments preceded the application of various forms of systems theory to the social and biological sciences.

After producing a financial story on budget- friendly interior design projects, Brian crossed over from network to cable to join the production team of Surprise by DesignSurprise by Design on The Discovery Channel. The eight-hour makeover timeline prepared Brian for a similar position on the spin-off series Rally Round the House for which he relocated to Atlanta. It was there that Brian learned the art of designing outdoor living spaces and working with outdoor materials. Flynn is self-taught and credits his formal education in video production from The Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale for influencing his interest in set design and set decoration. Following cancellation of Rally Round the House in 2003, Brian transitioned to work in front of the camera as a design expert on Movie & a Makeover. The fashion and home makeover program tasked Brian with designing spaces such as dorm rooms, laundry rooms, garden sheds, fraternity houses, non-profit board rooms, pet-care centers and outdoor living spaces. In addition to Movie & a Makeover, Brian was also a featured \\"redesigner\\" on the HGTV series Decorating Cents and served as design producer for two seasons of HGTV's reality competitionDesign Star. Flynn's spaces are best described as soft-masculine and characterized by a unique mix of design styles, modern and classic art, unconventional color schemes and practical budgets.

Of medieval origin, it was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666 and not rebuilt; the site became part of Honey Lane Market, which was in turn partially cleared to make way for the City of London School in the 19th century. Much of the area was destroyed during the bombing in World War II and has been redeveloped. The name Honey Lane is retained in a nearby walkway. Location All Hallows Honey Lane was located at the north end of Honey Lane, a narrow lane leading north from Cheapside. The church was surrounded on three sides by churchyard and enclosed by private houses. It was situated about north of Cheapside. John Stow's Survey of 1603 indicates the parish was part of Cheap Ward of the City of London.'Cheape warde', A Survey of London, by John Stow: Reprinted from the text of 1603 (1908), pp. 258–276. After the Great Fire, the site, together with that of the adjoining church of St. Mary Magdalen Milk Street and several houses, was acquired by the City, cleared, and laid out as a market-place, called Honey Lane Market.The City of London - a history Borer, M.I.C. : New York, D.McKay Co, 1978 ISBN 0-09-461880-1 The former church was situated in the northwest corner of this market.An exact surveigh of the streets, lanes and churches, comprehend.d plats, 10 Decem.r A.o Dom.i 1666, Leake J.

After the bombings of World War II, the area was comprehensively redeveloped. The alignment of the present Honey Lane is about east of the original lane. The church site is now occupied by a British Telecom shop at 114 Cheapside. History Honey Lane--Ordnance Survey map of 1916, also showing the pre-1666 London Fire, All Hallows church location.Ordnance Survey map of London, 1916, 2nd revision. Digimap. Retrieved 10 January 2018. The church may have originated as a private chapel associated with a nearby property, though no specific property has been identified. The earliest historical reference to the church, dating from between 1191 and 1212, comes in a deed which mentions one \\"Helias presbyter de Hunilane\\". Early mentions of the church describe it as \\"parochia Omnium Sanctorum de Hunilane\\" (1204–1215); \\"St. Elfegi de Hunilane\\" (1216–22, the only occurrence of an apparent alternative dedication), \\"All Hallows de Honilane\\" (1279); \\"All Hallows in Honylane\\" (1287) and \\"Parish of Honylane\\" (1297). Parish The parish of All Hallows was very small, and may originally have comprised only the area of those properties which surrounded Honey Lane and the churchyard and then been subsequently enlarged in the early 13th century. Even after this enlargement, the parish, covering only about 1 acre (0.4 hectare) in area, was one of the smallest in the City. There was a suggestion in 1658 that it should be united with that of St. Mary le Bow, but the idea was dropped and the two remained separate until after the Great Fire. In the late 12th and early 13th century, the parish became one of the first centres in the City for the trade of mercery: trading in cloth, typically silk and other fine cloth that was not produced locally. The parish had several small shops and selds, or covered markets, specializing in the trade. Patronage The earliest known patron of the church was Henry de Wokyndon, in the mid-13th century. The advowson then passed to various private owners until 1446, when it was willed to the Grocers' Company. The Grocers' Company retained the advowson until the Great Fire. The Grocers' Company had a custom of appointing learned men as rector of the church, at least until 1540. In the mid-16th century, the Company appointed graduates from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, apparently in strict alternation. Lutheranism At the time of the Protestant Reformation, the church was known for its Lutheran sympathies. Dr. Robert Forman, rector from 1525 to his death in 1528 and president of Queens' College, Cambridge, over the same period, was a well-known early reformer famous for his sermons and his interest in Lutheran books and doctrines. His curate at All Hallows, Thomas Gerrard (or Garret), himself appointed rector in 1537, was even more active in spreading Lutheran doctrines. In 1540 he was found guilty of heresy and burnt at the stake in Smithfield with other Protestants. In 1543, other members of the parish were also examined for holding allegedly \\"heretical\\" doctrines. Destruction All Hallows was destroyed by the Great Fire of London in 1666 and not rebuilt. Instead its parish was united with that of St. Mary le Bow; the name lived on as a ward precinct.Cheap Ward. - All Hallows Honey Lane Precinct: minute books, giving names of ward officers, 1726 q28 08806 cited in Architecture No archaeological traces of the church remain in situ. After the church's destruction in the Great Fire, the site was cleared for the market. When the City of London School was built there in 1835, the site was excavated to a depth of over 15 ft. (4.57 m.) before concrete foundations were laid. Tiles, the pavement, and vaults of a church described as \\"Anglo-Norman\\"” were found at that time. A rough pencil sketch made at about the same time, and entitled \\"part of old church discovered in Honey Lane\\", shows the remains of masonry walls including three pointed arches over what appear to be blocked openings. Two \\"Norman\\" capitals and the capital of a \\"Saxon\\" column, decorated with twisted serpents, were also found. One of the serpent capitals - now considered to be 12th century - is in the British Museum. Catalogue entry with photograph These remains could, however have belonged to either of churches on the site of the school, or possibly to one of the houses nearby. It is not known whether there had been any medieval rebuilding or enlargement of the church. However, because the structure described in the 1550s was apparently very simple, it is possible that this was the original church, altered little if at all. In the mid-16th century the church appears to have been a simple rectangular building, about long and wide. The cellar beneath the church was owned separately, from at least the early 14th century until the early 17th century. There was door on the south side of the church near the west end (opposite Honey Lane) and a chancel door, also on the south side. The church was surrounded to north, west, and south by its churchyard. In addition, excavations in 1954-5 on the site of the former No. 111 Cheapside uncovered a number of medieval burials. They probably represent an area of early churchyard subsequently encroached upon by private building. It is not clear whether this early churchyard would have extended as far south as Cheapside. In addition to those in the churchyard, there were some burials within the church. A vault near the chancel is also mentioned. Despite the narrowness of the church, part of it was referred to as the \\"south aisle\\", and several burials took place there in the 16th century. This may be the same area called the \\"burial aisle\\" in the register. In 1611 the parish bought the cellar, as a \\"more convenient place of burial for any of the inhabitants\\". The first burial took place in the cellar (referred to as the \\"cloister\\" in the burial register) in 1613. A chapel of St. Mary within the church is mentioned in a will of 1380. In 1545, apart from the high altar in the church there were altars to Our Lady (possibly in the chapel mentioned) and to St. Thomas the Martyr. By the 1550s there was a gallery, reached by stairs, and the church had several pews and a font. Churchwardens' accounts, beginning in 1618, indicate there were two or more bells, hung probably in a belfry with a steeple. Monuments and burials In his Survey of 1603, John Stow notes only of All Hallows that \\"there be no monumentes in this church worth the noting. I find that John Norman, Draper, Mayor 1453, was buried there.\\" ReferencesExternal links Category:Churches destroyed in the Great Fire of London and not rebuilt Category:Churches in the City of London Category:Former buildings and structures in the City of London ","title":"All Hallows Honey Lane"},{"id":"13314894","text":"The Kansas City crime family is an Italian-American Mafia family based in Kansas City, Missouri.  History =Early history The Italian-American organized crime family began when two Sicilian mafiosi known as the DiGiovanni brothers fled Sicily to Kansas City, Missouri, in 1912. Joseph \\"Joe Church\\" DiGiovanni and Peter \\"Sugarhouse Pete\\" DiGiovanni began making money from a variety of criminal operations or rackets shortly after their arrival. Their fortunes greatly improved with the introduction of Prohibition, when they became the only group bootlegging alcohol in Kansas City. Their rackets at this time were controlled by John Lazia, who later became the leading figure when the organisation expanded. The gang was given virtually a free hand to operate by their boss Tom Pendergast, head of the Pendergast Machine that controlled Kansas City's government at the time. Under Pendergast, Kansas City became a wide-open town, with absolutely no alcohol-related arrests being made within city limits during the entirety of Prohibition. The DiGiovanni family directly benefited from this lack of enforcement of prohibition laws. Post- Prohibition When Prohibition ended in 1933, the family, although already involved in various rackets, allegedly began extorting bars. On July 10, 1934, Lazia was assassinated, probably on the orders of his underboss, Charles Carrollo, who ruled as boss until his arrest in 1939 for tax evasion. His underboss Charles Binaggio then became the new boss and expanded the family's areas of labor into racketeering. With the help of Binaggio, Forrest Smith was elected in the Missouri gubernatorial race of 1948, and he took office on January 10, 1949. Binaggio was seen as a liability to the Mafia's nationwide commission, and it was decided that Binaggio should be killed. He was assassinated on April 6, 1950, and his successor Anthony Gizzo died of a heart attack in 1953. Nicholas Civella The new boss was now Nicholas Civella, who greatly expanded the family's rackets and forged alliances with families from other cities, making the organization very powerful. Civella used the Teamsters to fund casinos in Las Vegas. In 1975, Civella was imprisoned on gambling charges for betting on the 1970 Super Bowl, played between the Minnesota Vikings and the Kansas City Chiefs. Around this time, there was a war in the family over control of the River Quay entertainment district, in which three buildings were bombed and several gangsters were killed. Operation Strawman The Kansas City FBI, suspecting mob involvement at the Tropicana Casino in Las Vegas, set up a broad investigation, known as Operation Strawman, which involved wiretapping phones of reputed mobsters and their associates in Kansas City. From the evidence collected by taps and other eavesdropping in the late 1970s, the FBI discovered a conspiracy to skim money from the Tropicana Casino. Operation Strawman learned that Joe Agosto, head of the Tropicana's Folies Bergere show, controlled the skimming in the Tropicana. Agosto was secretly sending cash from the casino to Kansas City organized- crime chief Nick Civella and Joseph Aiuppa of Chicago, as well as Cleveland and Milwaukee mobsters. In 1981, a grand jury in Kansas City indicted Agosto, Kansas City mob boss Nick Civella, Civella's brother Carl Civella, mob member Carl DeLuna, and Carl Thomas, who had directed the illegal skimming of cash at the Tropicana with two others. The defendants were convicted in 1983. Recent history William \\"Willie the Rat\\" Cammisano, Sr., became the family's next boss until his death in 1995. Anthony Civella then became the new boss. He died in 2006. The Kansas City family had an estimated 25 made members as of the late 1990s, according to the FBI. The current boss of the family is believed to be John Joseph Sciortino, also known as \\"Johnny Joe\\", godson of Anthony Civella. The current underboss is believed to be Peter Simone. On July 21, 2008, Carl \\"Tuffy\\" DeLuna, former underboss to Nick Civella and brother-in-law to Anthony Civella, died. In August 2008, retired FBI agent William Ouseley published his history of the KC crime family from 1900 to 1950 in a book titled Open City. On March 20, 2009, Blackhand Strawman, a documentary of Kansas City's organized crime history, was released in theaters in Kansas City. On March 1, 2011 retired FBI agent William Ouseley published his history of the KC crime family from 1950 to 2000 in a book titled Mobsters in Our Midst. On November 25, 2013, the documentary film Gangland Wire was released to theaters. This film uses audio clips from FBI wiretaps to tell the story of how law enforcement uncovered a massive conspiracy to control Las Vegas casinos. On March 11, 2010, the FBI indicted Gerlarmo Cammisano, James Moretina, Michael Lombardo, and James DiCapo for allegedly operating a \\"multi-million-dollar internet gambling scheme\\". Gerlarmo Cammisano, son of William \\"Willie the Rat\\" Cammisano, served as the \\"master agent\\" of the sports bookmaking operation, which was based in the Kansas City area. Gerlarmo Cammisano's brother, William D. Cammisano, Jr., pleaded guilty for his role in the sports bookmaking operation. In January 1992, Moretina pleaded guilty to a federal money laundering charge and was sentenced to 37 months. Moretina served as president of a firm that distributed illegal video gambling machines. He and his business partner, purported mob underboss Peter J. Simone, operated the Be Amused Vending and Amusement Co. Moretina is the son of Charles Moretina, who was convicted in the 1980s for skimming Las Vegas casino gambling receipts. Prior to the indictment, six individuals pleaded guilty in connection with the investigation, including three – Vincent Civella and brothers Michael and Anthony Sansone – who are the son and grandsons of former Kansas City boss Anthony \\"Tony Ripe\\" Civella. According to Scott Burnstein's Gangster Report website (see State of the Syndicate: the Kansas City Mafia Today), the Kansas City mob is on its last legs with 12 made men or less. The family still has some gambling and loansharking with some extortion involving drugs and the strip club industry.

Widely accepted for several years, the gap was used as a political talking point in the United States to justify a great increase in defense spending. One result was a massive buildup of the US Air Force bomber fleet, which peaked at over 2500 bombers to counter the perceived Soviet threat. Surveillance flights by the U-2 aircraft indicated that the bomber gap did not exist. Appearance  On February 15, 1954, Aviation Week published an article describing new Soviet jet bombers capable of carrying a nuclear bomb from their bases to the US.Pictures Reveal Reds' New \\"Sunday Punch\\", Aviation Week, 15 Feb. 1954, 12–13 The aircraft was the Myasishchev M-4 Bison. Over the next year and a half, the rumors were debated publicly in the press and soon in Congress.Congress Gets Red Plane Facts, Aviation Week, 22 February 1954, pp. 13–14 Soviet Aviation Day deception Adding to the concerns was an infamous event in July 1955. At the Soviet Aviation Day demonstrations at the Tushino Airfield, ten Bison bombers were flown past the reviewing stand, flew out of sight, quickly turned around, and then flew past the stands again with eight more. That presented the illusion that there were 28 aircraft in the flyby. Western analysts, extrapolating from the illusionary 28 aircraft, judged that by 1960, the Soviets would have 800. US Air Force raises numbers of bombers At the time, the Air Force had just introduced its own strategic jet bomber, the B-52 Stratofortress, and the shorter-range B-47 Stratojet was still suffering from a variety of technical problems that limited its availability. Its staff started pressing for accelerated production of the B-52 but also grudgingly accepted calls for expanded air defense. The Air Force was generally critical of spending effort on defense after it had studied the results of the World War II bombing campaigns and concluded that British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin's pre-war thinking on the fruitlessness of air defense was mostly correct: \\"The bomber will always get through.\\" Like the British, the US Air Force concluded that money would better be spent on making the offensive arm larger to deter an attack. The result was a production series consisting of thousands of aircraft. Over 2,000 B-47s and almost 750 B-52s were built to match the imagined fleet of Soviet aircraft. Disproval of gap US President Dwight Eisenhower had always been skeptical of the gap. However, with no evidence to disprove it, he agreed to the development of the U-2 to find out for sure.Bomber Gap The first U-2 flights started in 1956. One early mission, Mission 2020, flown by Martin Knutson on 9 July 1956, flew over an airfield southwest of Leningrad and photographed 30 M-4 Bison bombers on the ramp. Multiplying by the number of Soviet bomber bases, the intelligence suggested the Soviets were already well on their way to deploying large numbers, with NEI 11-4-57 of November 1957 claiming 150 to 250 by 1958, and over 600 by the mid-1960s. In fact, the U-2 had actually photographed the entire Bison fleet; there were no M-4s at any of the other bases.Interview with Martin Knutson Follow-up missions over the next year showed increasing evidence that the Soviet military was actually at a very low level of activity. Further, the CIA received information from the factories that showed that production rate had slowed down.Recent Evidence on Bison Production (Top Secret), CIA-RDP79R00904A000400030035-9, Central Intelligence Agency, July 9, 1958. A follow-up report in April 1958 by Sherman Kent of the CIA stated that the program appeared to be winding down, not speeding up, and that the estimates for the force should be decreased. The Air Force would have none of it. In May 1958, they instead suggested that production was being carried out at Samara (then known as Kuybyshev), Kazan and Irkutsk, and the aircraft being delivered to Engels-2, Bila Tserkva and Balbasovo Air Base (Orsha Southwest) - basically, anywhere that had not yet been overflown. They suggested these be photographed, with the expectation that it would also provide information on new equipment. Engels and Kuybyshev were finally overflown by a Royal Air Force pilot in December 1959.[Mission 8005 Submitted 18 December 1959] (Document title of Mission 8035 is in error, see copy), CIA- RDP78B05700A000400200005-1, Central Intelligence Agency, 21 December 1959 They showed no sign of the bombers nor the production capacity for them. At least in official circles, the gap had been disproved. As it was later discovered, the M-4 was unable to meet its original range goals and was limited to about . Unlike the US, the Soviets still lacked overseas bases in the Western Hemisphere and so the M-4 could not attack the US and then land at a friendly airbase. Interest in the M-4 waned, and a total of only 93 were produced before the assembly lines were shut down in 1963. The vast majority were used as tankers or maritime reconnaissance aircraft; only the original ten shown at the air show and nine newer 3MD13 models served on nuclear alert.Myasishchev 'Bison' In popular culture *In Stanley Kubrick's movie Dr. Strangelove, the notion of a \\"Bomber Gap\\" is parodied when the character of Buck Turgidson (a Pentagon general) declares that the US \\"must not allow a mineshaft gap\\" in discussing the use of mineshafts as nuclear fallout shelters. *In one episode of U.S. television situation comedy That '70s Show, \\"Who Wants It More\\", Donna and Eric do a report in his bedroom for school on the arms race between the superpowers.

Establishing a uniform title is an aspect of authority control. The phrases conventional title and standard title are sometimes used; Resource Description and Access uses preferred title; while the 2009 Statement of International Cataloguing Principles deprecates \\"uniform title\\" in favour of authorized access point. There are many instances in which a uniform title can be used. Anonymous works such as sacred texts and folk tales may lack an obvious title: for instance, the Bible, Epic of Gilgamesh, Beowulf, or the Chanson de Roland. Works of art and music may contain no text that can be used for reference. A uniform title allows all versions of the work to collocate under one title and will reference all of the items to which the uniform title applies. For example, if a library has 10 copies of Crime and Punishment, each in a different language, an online library catalogue can display all of the copies of the book together under the chosen uniform title. The library could also list any copies of Crime and Punishment in other media, such as film adaptations or abridged editions, under the same uniform title. This can help a library patron when searching the online catalog find all of the versions of Crime and Punishment at once instead of searching for each foreign title or film individually. Uniform titles are particularly useful when cataloguing music, where pieces of music are often known by multiple valid titles and those titles are known in multiple languages, or when an individual work has been adapted as a contrafactum. The Library of Congress provides an example of how books of the New Testament are referred to in the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules: > :- Bible. N.T. Acts :- Bible. N.T. Colossians :- Bible. N.T. Corinthians, > 1st :- Bible. N.T. Corinthians, 2nd :- Bible. N.T. Ephesians ... > Example: > edition being cataloged: Othello / William Shakespeare > established uniform title: Shakespeare, William ... Othello > no uniform title assigned to the edition being cataloged > Example: > edition being cataloged: The tempest / William Shakespeare > established uniform title: Shakespeare, William ... Tempest The complementary situation occurs with a single work that exists with more than one title, especially when translated into another language, excerpted or collected with other works. In this case, the name of the language or a phrase such as 'Selections' is added to distinguish works with the same uniform title. The MARC 21 standard uses fields 240, 243, 630, 730 and 830 for uniform titles. ReferencesExternal links * Reitz, Joan M. ODLIS: Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science. U.

Although less well known than similar Curtiss and Felixstowe flying boats, 50 were ordered for Britain's Royal Naval Air Service. Development and design The White and Thompson company was formed by Norman Thompson and Douglas White in 1912 at Bognor Regis, Sussex to design and build aircraft.Goodall 1995, pp. 7–8. It built several models of aircraft in small numbers, before being renamed the Norman Thompson Flight Company in September 1915. The first aircraft to be produced by the renamed company was a twin- engined patrol flying boat, the Norman Thompson N.T.4. This was a three bay biplane powered by two pusher Hispano-Suiza engines mounted between the wings and was fitted with an enclosed, heavily glazed cockpit for its four-man crew. An initial order for ten aircraft for the Royal Naval Air Service was placed in December 1915, with the first prototype flying in October 1916.Goodall 1995, pp.44–45. Further orders were placed in 1917 bringing the total ordered to 50. Production continued through 1917, but in 1918, following a change in policy on anti-submarine aircraft, the final contract for 20 aircraft was cancelled.Goodall 1995, p.49. Total production was 26 aircraft, continuing until June 1918.Goodall 1995, pp.49,53. Norman Thompson produced a revised design to meet the requirements of Admiralty Specification N.2C, to replace the N.T.4. This type, designated the Norman Thompson N.2C used the wings of the N.T.4 but with a new hull resembling that of the Porte/Felixstowe boats. Power was by two 200 hp (149 kW) Sunbeam Arab engines. The first prototype attempted to fly on 1 August 1918, but required changes to the hull before it was capable of take-off. Water handling remained poor, and the aircraft was tail heavy in flight. It was abandoned following the end of the war.London 2003, pp.39–40. Operational history The N.T.4 entered service with the RNAS in 1916, being operated on anti-submarine patrols over the North Sea and English Channel but were mainly used for training, as larger aircraft were more suitable for patrol purposes.Goodall 1995, p.47. Many of the aircraft produced in 1918 were delivered straight to storage and were never used.Goodall 1995, p.49. Owing to its similarity in size to the Curtiss H-4, it shared the Curtiss flying boat's nickname of America, being renamed Small America when the larger Curtiss H-12 (known as Large America) and Felixstowe F.2 flying boats came into service.Thetford 1978, p.266-267 Variants ;N.T.4 :Initial batch of six aircraft.

He was a member of the Democratic Party, and was elected on November 7, 2006 to represent the 46th District, which covers the neighborhoods of Bath Beach, Bay Ridge, Brighton Beach, Coney Island, Dyker Heights, and Seagate, in Brooklyn. He served until July 7, 2015. Early life and career Brook-Krasny immigrated to the United States in 1989 from Moscow, where he had graduated from the Moscow Institute of Consumer Technology (currently the Russian State University for Tourism and Services) in 1983. After several years in New York City, he became a manager and started his own successful business, a children's entertainment and community center called Funorama, in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. He later was appointed to Brooklyn Community Board 13 and quickly rose to the position of treasurer. Political career Brook-Krasny's first political campaign was in 2000 for the New York State Assembly. Although he lost to the party-backed incumbent, he won a record number of votes as the city's most viable write-in candidate. In 2001, he ran for the New York City Council. Although he won the endorsement of The New York Times, he lost the election to Domenic M. Recchia, Jr. That same year, Brook-Krasny became the founding Executive Director of The Council of Jewish Émigré Community Organizations, a central coordinating body for 33 community-based, Russian-speaking émigré organizations in New York. In 2006, State Assemblywoman Adele Cohen retired and Brook-Krasny declared his candidacy for her position. Running a fierce campaign against fellow local activist Ari Kagan, who is also Russian-born, Brook-Krasny successfully reached out to many non-Jewish voters and secured the endorsements of many local newspapers and elected officials. He won a very close Democratic primary election, with 3,101 votes to Kagan's 2,958, and then easily won the general election over the Republican candidate, Patricia B. Laudano, 10,423 to 4,139 votes. Brook-Krasny was reelected to his assembly seat in 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014. During his tenure, he served on the Housing, Aging, Cities, Election Law, and Governmental Employees Committees. On June 11, 2015, he announced his resignation from the assembly effective July 7, to work in the private sector. He was succeeded by Pamela Harris, who was selected as the Democratic nominee by a party committee and then won the special general election in November. Criminal charges In 2017, as part of \\"Operation Avalanche\\" Brook-Krasny was arrested on charges of healthcare fraud. He was indicted along with eight other individuals and corporate entities with schemes to illegally sell prescriptions for over 3.7 million opioid painkillers, to defraud Medicaid and Medicare of millions of dollars and to commit money laundering through two Brooklyn medical clinics owned by Lazar Feygin. Feygin pleaded guilty to 16 charges including conspiracy, criminal sale of a prescription and health care fraud.  Acquittal  After a trial that lasted two months, on July 25, 2019 Brook-Krasny was found not guilty of five felony charges of conspiracy, health care fraud, and scheming to defraud the state. A mistrial was declared on the other three misdemeanor commercial bribery charges after the jury could not reach a verdict. Remaining charges against Alec Brook-Krasny were dismissed on Dec 2, 2019.

Seishirō disappears from Subaru's life after this point; Hokuto, fearing that he will come after her brother, offers up her own life in his place. Seishirō accepts and stabs her through the heart; with her last breath, Hokuto casts a spell whose effects would subsequently be revealed in X.  X  After leaving Tokyo following the events of Tokyo Babylon, Seishirō returns to the city to assume his place as one of the Dragons of Earth, one of the warriors destined to fight against the Dragons of Heaven to eliminate mankind. He encounters Subaru and other Dragons of Heaven while destroying one of the city's barrier but their fight does not conclude. Though still unemotional, Seishirō makes an unlikely friend with Fūma Monou, the most leader of the Dragon of Earth, who while taking one of Subaru's eyes in combat tells him that only Seishirō can grant Subaru's true wish. Seishirō encounters Subaru for one final fight in the Rainbow Bridge. After some time of fighting, Seishirō heads in for the finishing blow. Hokuto's final spell takes effect, leaving Subaru with his hand through Seishirō's chest, killing the Sakurazukamori instead. Hokuto's final wish was Subaru could not be killed the same way she was. Seishirō knew this, effectively committing suicide as Fūma states Subaru's wish was dying at Seishirō's hands. After the battle, Fūma offers Subaru Seishirō's remaining intact eye, revealing that it was Seishirō's wish to erase Fūma's trace on Subaru, which Subaru accepts. This act completes this ritual and, after regaining his full sight, Subaru becomes the 14th Sakurazukamori and one of the Dragons of Earth. A sidestory in the series also shows Seishiro becoming the Sakurazukamori by killing his mother, Setsuka. As she dies in his arms, she tells him he will also be killed by the person he loves.  Other appearances  In the live-action sequel to Clamp's manga, Seishirō Sakurazuka is portrayed by Shihodo Wataru. In the film, the Sakurazukamori assassinates a former enemy of the Sumeragi clan; however, his signature hand- through-the-chest style of killing is dropped in favor of magically strangling his victims. In the crossover manga Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Seishiro appears as a young traveler who gained the power to travel between worlds from the witch Yūko Ichihara in exchange for his right eye. He searches for the vampire twins Kamui and Subaru and, like his younger brother Fūma, he is a treasure hunter. Although the reason for searching the vampire twins remains unknown, Kamui states that he will kill Seishirō if he finds them. Seishirō possesses one of Sakura's magical feathers which allows him to summon oni to fight for him as well as modify them into swords he can change their shape. An experienced fighter, Seishirō was also the one to teach the dimension traveller Syaoran his kicking techniques. Although he grows happy with his development, Seishirō does not doubt in trying to kill Syaoran in Oto Country when searching for clues about the vampires. When coming to Japan to get information about the vampires' location, Seishirō is challenged by the \\"other Syaoran\\" who wishes to obtain his feather. In the course of the battle Syaoran manages to claim the feather, although Fūma comments that was his main intention from the start. He later leaves Japan to continue his search and is seen in the epilogue alongside his brother and the vampires.  Creation and conception  Subaru and his twin sister Hokuto, as well as Seishirō, were first conceived by series creator Nanase Ohkawa for a dōjinshi novel about an onmyōji who hunts elves, of which only the beginning exists.\\"Interview with Clamp: Tokyo Babylon\\" in Clamp no Kiseki, Volume 3. Egmont Manga & Anime, 2005. . The characters were twice drawn for covers, and when South asked Clamp to create a new series for them, these characters were used. In the dōjinshi, Seishirō was also a veterinarian, but though he had a dark side, it was nowhere near as pronounced. Thus, he was the character who underwent the most change from this early conception to the creation of Tokyo Babylon. Nevertheless, Seishiro was easier to write than Subaru as Clamp was more used to writing dark characters. In the dōjinshi, Seishirō's shikigami was named Nandaro (\\"Just what is this?\\"), and Clamp privately still refer to it by this name. Yasunori Kato: Subaru and Seishiro's respective designs pay homage to this character, the protagonist of the fantasy novel Teito Monogatari, widely credited with starting the \\"onmyoji boom\\" in Japan.Kazuhiko, Komatsu. \\"Seimei jinja\\" 28-61 Subaru and Seishirō appear in X because their relationship parallels Kamui Shirō and Fuma Monou's. They serve as an example to Kamui and Fuma: One of Xs most important developments is the question what these two will do so they will not end up like Subaru and Seishirō.Ten years of X. PUFF magazine, January 2002, 19–21. Ohkawa found Seishirō to be childish due how he only deals with what appeals to him in contrast to Fuma who Ohkawa finds adult-like.\\"Interview with Clamp: X (Part 1)\\" in Clamp no Kiseki, Volume 8. Kodansha, 2005. . In the sixteenth volume of the series, the rivalry between the two ended with Seishirō's death much to the surprise of most readers. As they believed Seishirō would actually survive, Clamp made it clear that Seishirō permanently died and would not return in future chapters. Reception Seishirō has been well received by publications for manga and anime. Mania Entertainment writer Mike Dungan found Seishirō's role in Tokyo Babylon as comical, with his romantic intentions for Subaru being hard to find genuine. Despite initially finding Seishirō \\"cliche\\", the writers from Manga Bookshelf were interested by the true meaning behind his actions to Subaru. They were surprised by Seishirō's betrayal to Subaru as it contrasted other stories in which an traitor would redeem himself but at the same time they questioned his motivations in the past. Zac Bertschy from Anime News Network referred to Seishirō as one of the most deep villains from X, pointing that he was already developed in Tokyo Babylon. His confrontation with Subaru in the TV series was praised mainly because how their character designs were updated from the ones from Tokyo Babylon. Mania Entertainment's Chris Beveridge agreed with Bertschy, calling the episode of their final battle one of the best ones from the series focused on how their backgrounds are shown and tragic elements portrayed. In the book Understanding Manga and Anime, writer Robin E. Brenner referred to Seishirō's and Subaru's relationship as one of the most explicit ones from X adding that the romantic feelings between these two male characters were uncommon in western stories. Brenner stated that Seishirō's unheard last words were meant to force readers to interpret them into their own ways, something characteristic in manga series. In the first character popularity poll from Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Seishirō was voted as the sixth most popular character from the series.

She championed Darwinian evolution with particular emphasis on the mind and morals, in contrast to the prevailing emphasis on competition and physical survival.Larsen, J. 2017. The evolving spirit: morals and mutualism in Arabella Buckley's evolutionary epic. Notes and Records: the Royal Society Journal of the History of Science, 71(4), pp.385-408. Charles Darwin described her as being able to 'treat evolution with much dexterity and thruthfulness'.Charles Darwin to Arabella Buckley, 14 November 1880, Cambridge University Library, Darwin Papers, DAR 143:184. Biography Buckley was born in Brighton, England. Her brother was Henry Buckley, 1st Baron Wrenbury. At the age of 24, she went to work as secretary to Charles Lyell, and remained with him until his death in 1875, on which Charles Darwin wrote to her to commiserate with her. After that, she began lecturing and writing on science. Being Charles Lyell's assistant and a female put her in good standing to educate youth. One of Buckley's earlier pieces, The Fairy-Land of Science, puts her views of science in a children's book setting, much like a mother educating her child. Her work was labelled as lectures rather than chapters, mirroring how she would teach young people. One of her lectures, \\"The Two Great Sculptors - Water and Ice\\" emphasizes how water and ice create hills, crevasses and valleys much as a sculptor will create a statue using a chisel. It also describes how water always needs somewhere to go and often takes part of the land with it, causing cliffs to fall apart leaving faults and intrusions behind. She saw no contradiction in using fancy to present fact, writing of the natural world: \\"Can any magic tale be more marvellous, or any thought grander, or more sublime than this?\\" Buckley married at the age of 44, but continued publishing under her maiden name, although one of the later editions of Eyes and No Eyes gives her married name (Mrs Fisher). She also edited two other publications: Mary Somerville's Connexion of the Physical Sciences (1877) and Heinrich Leutemann's Animals from Life (1887). Her books were translated into Japanese, Polish and Swedish in her lifetime. In Buckley's time, male scientists often had female assistants and included some of their findings in the lead scientists' work. The women themselves generally would not be labelled scientists, and so did not receive any acknowledgement. Arabella Buckley died of influenza at her home, 3 Boburg Terrace, Sidmouth, Devon, on 9 February 1929. Writing Arabella Buckley's writing was predominantly aimed at children and young people, but was popular and greatly respected by all ages. She communicated science through enchantment and metaphorical language that was attractive to younger readers.Somerset, R. 2011. Arabella Buckley and the Feminization of Evolution as a Communication Strategy. Nineteenth-Century Gender Studies, 7. Like many writers in her time, she was trying to distance science from the mechanistic and materalistic philosophies it was sometimes connected to, and promoted it in moralistic terms: learning is presented as a means to become not only knowledgable, but morally good. This places it in the tradition of books such as Charles Kingsley's Glaucus or the Wonders of the Shore (1855) which ignited the Victorian crazy for the popular pursuit of the natural world, seen in a framework of what has been called 'muscular christianity'. However, Buckley veered away from this hyper-masculinised narrative of nature and science. She tended to avoid technical language, such as the mechanisms of natural selection, and instead use narrative and metaphor to reach a wide audience. This made her work accessible and 'barrier crossing'. Works *A short history of natural science and of the progress of discovery from the time of the Greeks to the present day.

Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) is a United States student organization representing left wing ideals. It takes its name and inspiration from the original SDS of 1960–1969, then the largest radical student organization in US history. The contemporary SDS is a distinct youth and student-led organization with over 120 chapters worldwide. Re- formation Beginning January 2006, a movement to revive the Students for a Democratic Society took shape. Two high school students, Jessica Rapchik and Pat Korte, decided to reach out to former members of the \\"Sixties\\" SDS, to re- establish a student movement in the United States. Korte did this by contacting Alan Haber. They called for a new generation of SDS, to build a radical multi-issue organization grounded in the principle of participatory democracy. Several chapters at various colleges and high schools were subsequently formed. On Martin Luther King Jr. Day of 2006, these chapters banded together to issue a press release that stated their intentions to recreate the national SDS organization. In the press release, the SDS called for the organization's first national convention since 1969 to be held in the summer of 2006 and to have it preceded by a series of regional conferences occurring during the Memorial Day weekend. These regional conferences would also be the first of their kind since 1969. On April 23, 2006, SDS held a northeast regional conference at Brown University. Politics Since its foundation in 2006, the organization's activities have centered on two broad areas. The first is building opposition to the US government-led wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and neighboring countries in South Asia and the Middle East. The second area is advocating for \\"students rights\\", broadly defined. For example, SDSers have played a major role in the national movement against budget cuts and tuition hikes in education in the recent period. Practically speaking, each SDS chapter is additionally also involved in a variety of local issues having relevance to their particular area. Structure SDS is a chapter based organization. Individuals belong to particular chapter, and a national working committee coordinates national campaigns and communications between the chapters. Working groups form on an as-needed basis and give reports back to the national working committee. Certain caucuses based on specific historical oppressions fulfill an ombudsman-like role, in addition to acting in support and networking capacities for the organization generally. Notable events The new SDS has organized and participated in numerous actions against the Iraq War and made clear its opposition to any possible military action against Iran by the US. The Pace University chapter of SDS protested against a speech by Bill Clinton held at the University's New York City campus, prompting the university to hand over two students, Lauren Giaccone and Brian Kelly, to the United States Secret Service. After the threatened expulsion of the two protesters, Pace SDS began a campaign that helped pressure the President of Pace to resign. Beginning in March and continuing into April and May 2006, SDS chapters across the country participated in a series of actions supporting Immigrant Rights. SDS chapters, such as at Brandeis, Connecticut College, and Harvard coordinated with large coalitions of students to strike and walk out of their classes on May Day. The newly formed SDS held its first national convention from August 4 to August 7, 2006 at the University of Chicago. In early March 2007, SDS members and allies in Tacoma, Washington led a blockade of the Port of Tacoma, where the US military was loading Stryker vehicles onto ships to be transported to Iraq. After confrontations every night for a week, the police broke the human blockade through the use of rubber bullets and pepper spray. On March 12, 2007, one week before the anniversary of the invasion of Iraq, the New School chapter of SDS held a Campus Moratorium against the Iraq War. Students left classes and proceeded down 5th Avenue to the Chambers Street military recruitment center where they met with the Pace University chapter of SDS. The students entered the Recruitment Center, barricaded the door and held a nonviolent sit-in, effectively closing the recruitment center for about two hours. Twenty members of SDS were arrested and charged with criminal trespassing, a misdemeanor. On March 17, 2007, SDS groups from across the country met and participated in the March on the Pentagon, in which parts of the SDS contingent along with allies occupied a bridge near The Pentagon. Five demonstrators were arrested. On March 20, 2007, 83 SDS chapters from around the country held coordinated actions against the Iraq war. One such action in the Bay Area shut down the entrance to Chevron's World Headquarters. The Summer of 2007 was a critical turning point for SDS as a national organization. First, SDS fielded a large contingent at the first US Social Forum in Atlanta on June 27 – July 1. SDS found itself part of a national movement to change the US; at the forum, SDS members gave workshops, demonstrated, and formed bonds with members from across the country. The second SDS National Convention took place July 27–30, 2007 at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan. Approximately 200 members of SDS attended what was a constitutional convention. The primary focus of the convention was to democratically create a national structure and vision for the organization. These goals were achieved, though all decisions made at the convention will be sent back to the SDS chapters for a process of ratification which is currently under way. The first national SDS Action Camps took place from August 13–16 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The camp was hosted by the Lancaster chapter of SDS. It included anti-oppression/collective liberation trainings, and workshops about a variety of things – including media skills, meeting facilitation, and direct action. The camp was held in order to provide students with skills needed to become better organizers, and deepen the sophistication of their vision and strategy. On September 15, 2007, SDS chapters from several colleges across the country (including Ohio, Indiana, Washington D.C., Harrisburg, PA and New York) gathered and marched in the ANSWER coalition march from the White House steps, to the Capitol building. The protest was estimated to include up 80,000 people. At least 150 were arrested, and there was at least one incident where police pepper-sprayed protesters. In early November 2007, SDS members were again present at a similar blockade at the Port of Olympia, Washington. The blockade was broken only after 67 arrests, as well as use of pepper spray, rubber bullets, and other crowd-control weapons. A similar confrontation had occurred in May 2006 at the Port of Olympia. Members and Chapters around the US and Canada participated in a large series of semi-coordinated events and demonstrations between March 17 and March 21 to bring awareness to the 5th anniversary of the invasion of Iraq. The 2008 National Convention was held in College Park, Maryland. Members at the meeting decided on a national structure: the National Work Committee and a national campaign: Student Power for Accessible Education. A \\"Funk the War\\" demonstration, organized by DC SDS. In September, SDS chapters from around the country converged on St. Paul, Minnesota to participate in the four days of protests against the Republican National Convention. Members of Providence SDS took over a board meeting of the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority RIPTA to protest proposed route cuts. The group also argues that the RIPTA board is detached from its riders and doesn’t represent them. The University of North Texas and several other chapters opened. In 2008, the University of Houston opened a chapter and added to the efforts of immigrant rights actions that Texas Grassroots Leadership had begun in 2006, holding many protests centered on detention centers in Texas, particularly the family detention center T. Don Hutto that incarcerated immigrant mothers with children in Taylor, the center in Raymondville and Houston's Processing Center who's in contract with ICE. These efforts across Texas saw a big win when the T. Don Hutto detention center changed its policies and stopped incarcerating children in late 2009. SDS at the University of Houston in Houston, Texas has continued the protests of these detention centers and plans for more in 2010. New efforts in Texas SDS chapters are being made to support the DREAM Act, as well as 2010's May Day. SDS at the University of Houston also participated in the March 4 National Day of Action to Defend Education, along with SDS chapters nationwide, as well as national anti-war,Anti-War Working Groups http://sdsantiwar.wordpress.com/ anti-occupation and Israeli apartheid Week campaigns. In March 2010, members of the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee's chapter of SDS staged a protest outside the Chancellor's building. The event, designed to protest rising tuition costs, was met with a police presence. Police began using pepper spray, and arrested sixteen members of the protest, including both SDS members and allied organizations on campus through the Education Rights Campaign. On August 19, 2012, Occupy Colleges officially merged with SDS.

Early life  Kasten, fourth child of Ferdinand Kasten and his wife Barbara Anna Kasten, grew up in San Francisco's Richmond District.John O'Hara - The Chronicle 11-22-2002 He was a student of art from an early age and regularly competed with his older brother Fred in battleship drawing contests. Fred eventually gave up but Karl continued. At times, Kasten's art seemingly got in the way of his schoolwork and his sixth grade teacher was driven to send a note home: \\"Dear Mr. Kasten, Do something about your son. All he wants to do is draw. He's not paying attention in school\\" Fortunately, his father sent a note back to the teacher: \\"Let him draw.\\" The same year, with financial help from his older brother Fred, Karl furthered his artistic advancement at the California School of Fine Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute) and his explorations of art continued from there. Following his graduation from San Francisco Polytechnic High School, Kasten pursued an education in fine art.  Education  Kasten attended College of Marin, and later transferred to UC Berkeley. His early mentors came from the \\"Berkeley School\\" - John Haley, Erle Loran, Margaret Peterson and Worth Ryder. Following the mode of the \\"Berkeley School\\" Kasten painted landscapes with flat planes punctuated with color. His work from this period earned him recognition and prizes in annual painting competitions held at the San Francisco Museum Of Art (now MOMA).\\"Breaking of Type, The Art of Karl Kasten\\", Susan Landauer 1999 Kasten was also an editorial cartoonist and Arts Editor for The Daily Californian newspaper. His cartoons regularly featured reflections on the New Deal and the conflicts in Europe. By coincidence the success of Berkeley's Golden Bears also marked an interesting chapter in Kasten's artistic adventure. As part of the Rally Committee, Kasten designed and directed the card stunts for the 1938 Rose Bowl against Alabama's Crimson Tide. The card sequence depicted Berkeley's Campanile covered over by a surging red tide. As the tide receded, a bear appeared in a rowboat and rowed across the tide. Cal won, 13-0. Kasten describes the stunts as, \\"The greatest work of art I ever did.\\" He went on to complete his B.A and M.A at UC Berkeley. Following his graduation he taught briefly at the California School of Fine Arts but the attack on Pearl Harbor led him to wartime service.  World War II  Kasten enlisted in the U.S. Army following the attack on Pearl Harbor. Kasten was initially assigned to the medical corps but ended up in the engineers corps where his artistic skills were used for camouflage. After Officer Candidate School he was deployed to England to serve with the 295th Engineer Combat Battalion.http://lct376.org/us295th/us295th_Roster.pdf On D-Day he was promoted to Captain and put in charge of the Intelligence unit of the Battalion. Kastens' memories of the war are dark and he recalls bluntly, \\"My job was to kill people\\", and \\"I was pretty miserable inside.\\"Kaul (2005), p.169–174  Educator  After the war, Kasten continued with his art education. Rather than return to his budding career in the Bay Area Kasten chose to establish himself in a new area without ties. He taught for two years (1946-1947) at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor under the chairmanship of Jean Paul Slusser. Ultimately the Michigan winters drove his return to the Bay Area where he again took an assistant professor of art position at the San Francisco State University. He spent three years at SFU (1949-1950) where he introduced a printmaking program. During the summer of 1949 he studied modern etching techniques and printmaking with Lasansky at the University of Iowa. The following year he was offered a professorship UC Berkeley which he was to hold until 1983. \\"That was Nirvana\\" he said. \\"My greatest satisfaction is that I was a pretty good teacher.\\" Painting and printing  Dante, 1962, oil on canvas, 63\\" x 68\\" In the early 1950s Kasten experimented with Cubism and non- objective painting but after studying at the Hans Hofmann School in Provincetown, Mass in '51 he turned to Abstract Expressionism. Hofmann's modern art philosophy stressed \\"pictorial structure, spatial illusion, and color relationships.\\"Tate Collection  Hans Hofmann In her biography of the San Francisco School of Abstract Expressionism Susan Landauer noted Kasten as the artist who came closest to these tenets. Of that period Kasten said, \\"It was a great period to work in. Just letting things flow and seeing what happens... I think I got more color into painting during that time than most guys.\\" Kasten's paintings are predominantly acrylics on canvas, but he also works in watercolor and gouache. The graphics are primarily drawings in pencil, monoprints, drypoints and collagraphs. In the 1960s he began working in collography which is a variation of the etching process first practiced by Rudolph Nesch in the 1930s. Kasten's collographs are noteworthy for the sensitivity in texture and for the use of insertable parts such as coins and found objects to print a range of colors. Campus Drypoint, 1999 In addition to his wide record of painting exhibitions, Karl Kasten is known worldwide as a master printer. In 1950, he established the Printmaking program and a course in Materials and Techniques at UC Berkeley. Kasten's aim and underlying credo with the courses was that printmaking could equal traditional painting through creative exploration. After viewing his colorful etchings of the 1950s, art critic Alfred Frankenstein observed that Kasten had \\"discovered a new softness, liquidity, and fluency of effect in the bitten plate and with this a new way of expressing the modern artist's preoccupation with space and movement.\\" Susan Landauer recognized Kasten in her monograph Breaking Type: The Art of Karl Kasten, with one or two exceptions 'there were few examples of serious printmaking among Abstract Expressionists in New York.' Kasten has also been recognized for his printing accomplishments with the 1997 Distinguished Artist award of the California Society of Printmakers, the Humanities Research Fellowship and Tamarind Lithography Fellowship. David Acton refers to Kasten succinctly as \\"the dean of Bay Area printmaking.\\" In 1960 Kasten unexpectedly met Willem de Kooning at an art gathering. The meeting resulted in Kasten inviting de Kooning to the Berkeley campus where he pulled his first lithographs. Kasten has since lectured widely on the unique tools, technique and genius which de Kooning employed in the two lithographs. In the 1970s, he designed a lightweight press (The KB Press) in conjunction with the Berglin Corporation that can now be found in schools and studios around the world.  Collections  Kasten has exhibited in the São Paulo Bicentennial and World Print III Traveling Show, as well as the M. H. de Young Museum and California Palace of the Legion of HAuckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmakionor, the Art Institute of Chicago, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the Whitney Museum of American Art, among others. His works are in the collections of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; the Oakland Art Museum; San Jose Museum of Art; New York Public Library; Museum of Modern Art, New York City; M. H. de Young Memorial Museum; Achenback Collection; Musée des Beaux Arts, Rennes; Auckland Art Gallery Toi o Tāmaki, New Zealand; and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Texts dealing with his work include \\"Etching\\" by L. Edmondson, 1973; \\"Modern Woodcut Techniques\\" by A. Kurasaki, 1977; \\"The California Style\\", by G. McClelland and J. Last, 1985; \\"Breaking Type, The Art of Karl Kasten\\" by Susan Landauer. Kasten retired from teaching in 1983 but his passion for art and learning kept him busy. He continued to lecture occasionally, paint enthusiastically, and work on his memoirs until his death. He also continued to draw.

At times there is cross-over between D.T. and Information Technology, whereas I.T. is primarily focused on overall network infrastructure, hardware & software requirements, and implementation, D.T. is specifically focused on supporting, maintaining and training design and engineering applications and tools and working closely with I.T. to provide necessary infrastructure, for the most effective use of these applications and tools. Within the building design, construction and maintenance industry (also known as AEC/O/FM), the product is the building and the role of D.T., is the effective application of technologies within all phases and aspects of building process. D.T. processes have adopted Building Information Modeling (BIM) to quicken construction, design and facilities management using technology. So though D.T. encompasses BIM and Integrated Project Delivery, I.P.D., it is more overarching in its directive and scope and likewise looks for ways to leverage and more effectively utilize C.A.D., Virtual Design & Construction, V.D.C., as well as historical and legacy data and systems. D.T. is applicable to industrial and product design and the manufacturing and fabrication processes therein.

It was the first publicly supported medical school west of the Mississippi River. History The University of Missouri School of Medicine is medical school of the University of Missouri. Established in 1872, it was the first publicly supported medical school west of the Mississippi River. The school was organized as a two-year school in 1872. Joseph Norwood, M.D., professor of natural science and philosophy, was the first dean. The current dean is interim dean Steven Zweig who was previously the chair of Family and Community Medicine. The School of Medicine, along with the University of Missouri Sinclair School of Nursing and the University of Missouri School of Health Professions form the MU Health System. Parker Hospital around 1900 Progress was slow until 1890, when Richard Jesse was appointed university president. The school was housed in an old frame building on the northwest corner of campus. Equipment was inadequate and out of date, and the program was in danger of being discontinued. Jesse led the school to new heights due to nationwide advances in modernizing medical education. In addition, he reorganized the academic structure and raised financial support for new facilities. W.L. Parker established an endowment that supplemented the cost of building the Parker Memorial Hospital. In 1957, the school was transformed into a four-year program. As a result, the medical center was constructed in 1960. The name was later changed to University Hospitals and Clinics.  Campus The campus is located in the South portion of campus, along with the University Hospital, Mizzou Biojoint Center, and Ellis Fischel Cancer Center, among other members of the MU Health System. A new $42.5 million Patient- Centered Care Learning Center opened in Columbia in 2017. A second campus, known as the Springfield Clinical Campus, was opened June 13, 2016, in partnership with CoxHealth and Mercy Health systems. Eight to twelve MU medical students complete their last two years of training at the Springfield campus.  Admissions  For the entering class in 2016, MU School of Medicine received 2,167 applications for 104 spots. 370 applicants were interviewed, and 164 were accepted. The average accepted applicant's GPA and MCAT percentile were 3.79 and 77.8, respectively. The school employs 739 faculty members as part of 1,359 staff members. The schools has 401 medical students, 369 residents, 81 clinical fellows, 85 postdoctoral fellows, 139 PhD students, and 22 master's degree students. As of 2017, there are 7,700 physician alumni and 500 doctoral and master's degree alumni from the University of Missouri School of Medicine.  Curriculum & Rankings  Years one and two at the medical school are centered around patient based learning (PBL), in which students work through real clinical cases to strengthen their problem-solving capacity, clinical skills, and ability to collaborate with peers. In the third year, students participate in seven core clerkships (family medicine, internal medicine, neurology, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, psychiatry, and surgery). In their fourth and final year, students are required to take advanced clinical electives, general electives, and an advanced biomedical science course. The MU Department of Family Medicine has been ranked in Top 10 for 23 consecutive years, and the school itself is ranked No. 54 in its primary care training, out of 170 schools.  Expansion  Beginning in August 2017, MU School of Medicine will expand its class size from 96 to 128 to help address the nationwide physician shortage. The class-size increase has been enabled by the opening of a second clinical campus in Springfield, MO, and the construction of a brand new Patient-Centered Care learning center on the main campus. It is estimated that the expansion will provide an additional 300 Missouri physicians, create 3,500 new jobs, and add $390 million to the state economy annually. Reception Several basic science departments are nationally recognized for excellent research. U.S. News and World Report has ranked MU's Department of Family and Community Medicine as one of the top three family medicine programs nationwide for 15 consecutive years.\\"MU Family Medicine Ranked the Number Three Department in Country.\\" The 2008 rankings ranked MU third in family medicine (tied with University of Wisconsin–Madison) and 23rd among schools emphasizing primary care.

It is part of the Idaho Falls, Idaho Metropolitan Statistical Area. History In the 19th century, the site of present-day Osgood was known as Eagle Rock, and it was the location of an important ferry crossing of the Snake River. The name came from an isolated basalt island in the Snake River that was the nesting site for approximately twenty eagles. However, the name Eagle Rock eventually migrated downstream to the town that today is known as Idaho Falls, and at that point the ferry crossing site became known as Payne. Shortly thereafter the Osgood Canal was built nearby as a means to harness the irrigation capability of the nearby Snake River and expand agricultural production, and the community assumed that name, which it retains to the present day. Transportation & Tourism In 1972, a Boy Scout from Idaho Falls constructed a small monument on the west shore of the river, within sight of Eagle Rock. The location is visited by fishermen, hunters, and photographers. However, today, no eagles nest on the rock.

Founded in 2003, Skyhook originally began by geolocating Wi-Fi access points and evolved with the idea that hybrid positioning technology, which incorporates Wi-Fi, GPS, cell towers, IP address and device sensors, could improve device location.  History  Skyhook was founded in 2003 by Ted Morgan and Michael Shean. Skyhook's database was initially gathered through wardriving,How It Works: Coverage, Skyhook when the company sent teams of drivers around the United States, Canada, Western Europe and selected Asian countries to map out Wi-Fi hot spots. Skyhook powers location-based services for companies such as Apple, Samsung, Sony, HP, Dell, Sharp, Philips and MapQuest. The firm received its first patent in 2007, and as of early 2020 holds over 650 patents across the United States and foreign markets. In 2010 Skyhook sued Google over the use of Wi-Fi locator technology in cell phones. The complaint claimed that Andy Rubin, Google's Vice President for Engineering, gave Sanjay K. Jha, Chief Executive of Motorola's mobile devices division, a “stop ship” order, preventing Motorola from shipping phones with the Android operating system using the Skyhook software. The litigation was settled in 2015: Skyhook received $90 million in settlement with the tech giant, a third of which was consumed by legal fees. The figure was revealed in a securities filing by Liberty Broadband Corp., Skyhook's Colorado-based parent company. In February 2014, Skyhook Wireless was acquired by TruePosition Inc, a subsidiary of Liberty Broadband.http://www.trueposition.com/about-trueposition/news/press- releases/trueposition-acquires-skyhook/ In 2016, the two companies merged under the Skyhook brand, which now rests under Liberty Broadband, which is a part of the Liberty Media family. In 2016 Skyhook launched new products dedicated to the advertising technology market: Retailer Personas, Power Personas, and On-Demand Personas. These solution, based on Skyhook's processing of billion location points, help marketers finely target consumers based on where they have been in order to personalize mobile marketing campaigns. In February 2019 Skyhook announced that it is working closely with Qualcomm Technologies to bring Wi-Fi positioning and location-assistance services based on Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear platforms. In February 2020 Deutsche Telekom announced that Skyhook was among its new technology partners for IoT Solution Optimizer, an ecosystem of company developed to “scale-up IoT business faster, and support enterprises of all sizes wanting to succeed in the Internet of Things.“ In April 2020 Skyhook partnered with Kyocera to provide accurate location services to DuraXV Extreme, a rugged flip phone.  Coverage  To pinpoint location, Skyhook uses a reference network composed of the known locations of over 4 billion Wi-Fi access points and 200 million cellular towers, . Skyhook's coverage area includes most major metro areas in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. The system can also be used to enhance the performance of GPS enabled devices where GPS reception is weak.  Precision Location SDK  Skyhook offers a software development kit (SDK), which allows developers to create location-enabled applications using Skyhook's software-only Hybrid Positioning System on the platform of their choice. The SDK supports Android 2.2 (Froyo), 2.3.x (Gingerbread), 4.0.x (Ice Cream Sandwich), and 4.1.x (Jelly Bean), 4.4 (KitKat), 5.0-5.1 (Lollipop), and 6.0 (Marshmallow) including forked platforms such as the Kindle Fire, along with Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.Skyhook SDK  Context SDK  In 2013, Skyhook launched Context, which uses Skyhook's location network along with venue data to give mobile users awareness of the world around them. It enables personalized mobile experiences and enhanced revenue opportunities using 1st Party Location Network and precisely located venues. The SDK requires iOS 6.0+ and a device with region monitoring support: iPhone 4+, iPad (Wi-Fi only) 3+, iPad (Wi-Fi+Cell) 2+, iPad mini, iPad Air, iPod Touch 5+. The Android SDK is supported on Android 2.2 (Froyo), 2.3.x (Gingerbread), 4.0.x (Ice Cream Sandwich), 4.1.x-4.3 (Jelly Bean), 4.4 (KitKat), 5.0-5.1 (Lollipop), and 6.0 (Marshmallow) including forked platforms such as the Kindle Fire.

Its onset of pain relief after oral administration is about 10–15 minutes and peak relief from pain occurs about 25–50 minutes after oral administration. Medical uses Tilidine Tilidine is used in the form of hydrochloride or phosphate salt. In Germany, tilidine is available in a fixed combination with naloxone for oral administration (Valoron N and generics); the mixture of naloxone is claimed to lower the abuse liability of the opioid analgesic. This is so that if people take the medication orally (which is the way they are meant to) the opioid blocker, naloxone, has minimal effects on them but if they inject it the naloxone becomes bioavailable and hence antagonises the effects of the tilidine producing withdrawal effects. In Switzerland the original Valoron brand with only tilidine and no naloxone is also available. As well as its use as an analgesic, tilidine is also commonly used in Germany for treatment of restless legs syndrome. The reversed ester is also known and is also a prodrug. Tilidine is a controlled substance in most countries, listed in the German BtMG, Austrian SMG, and in the USA under the Controlled Substances Act 1970 as ACSCN 9750 as a Narcotic under Schedule I, with an annual aggregate manufacturing quota of 10 grams in 2014. It is used as the hydrochloride (free base conversion ratio 0.882) and HCl hemihydrate (0.858). Adverse effects Its most common adverse effects are transient nausea and vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, headache and nervousness; less commonly, nausea and vomiting (after repeated dosing), hallucinations, confusion, euphoria, tremor, hyperreflexia, clonus and increased sweating. Uncommonly, somnolence; rarely, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Physicochemistry It usually comes in its hydrochloride hemihydrate salt form; in this form it is highly soluble in water, ethanol and dichloromethane and appears as a white/almost white crystalline powder. Its storage is restricted by its sensitivity to degradation by light and oxygen, hence necessitating its storage in amber bottles and at temperatures below 30 degrees Celsius, respectively. Pharmacology Considered a low-to-medium-potency opioid, tilidine has the oral potency of about 0.2, that is, a dose of 100 mg p.o. is equianalgesic to approximately 20 mg morphine sulfate orally. It is administered orally (by mouth), rectally (by a suppository), or by injection (SC, IM or slowly IV). Tilidine itself is only a weak opioid, but is rapidly metabolised in the liver and gut to its active metabolite nortilidine and then to bisnortilidine. It is the (1S,2R)-isomer (dextilidine) that is responsible for its analgesic activity. Nortilidine binds to opiate receptors in the central and peripheral nervous systems and suppresses pain perception and transmission. To counteract the abuse potential, tilidine is used in combination with the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. Naloxone abolishes the central depressant and peripheral effects of tilidine. The mixing ratio with naloxone is chosen so that the analgesic effect of tilidine is not impaired. Pharmacokinetics Tilidine is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and is subject to a pronounced first-pass effect. The conversion of tilidine into the more active metabolite nortilidine occurs with the participation of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19. The inhibition of these enzymes can thus alter the efficacy and tolerability profile of tilidine. The analgesic effect occurs after 10-15 minutes. After oral administration of 100 mg tilidine plus 8 mg naloxone, the maximum effect is reached in about 25-50 minutes. The duration of action is given as 4-6 hours. The elimination half-life for nortilidine is 3-5 hours. Tilidine is metabolised to 90% and eliminated renally. The rest appears in the faeces. Depending on the extent of the impairment, the maximum concentration of nortilidine in plasma is lower in liver function than in healthy individuals and the half-life is prolonged. In case of severe hepatic insufficiency the therapy is questionable. In these cases, it is possible that the formation of active nortilidine may be so low that the analgesic effect is insufficient. In addition, in the combination preparations with naloxone, the inactivation of the same can only be insufficient. The consequent antagonisation of the nortilidine effect can lead to a further loss of activity. Synthesis It is manufactured by a Diels-Alder reaction of 1-N,N-dimethylaminobuta-1,3-diene with ethyl atropate, yielding a mixture of isomers, of which only the (E)-(trans)-isomers are active and are separated subsequently from the mixture by precipitation of the inactive (Z)-(cis)-isomers as zinc complex. The inactive (Z)-(cis)-isomers may be epimerised to the more thermodynamically favoured (E)-(trans)-isomers via reflux in diluted phosphoric acid. 400px  References  Category:Opioids Category:Ethyl esters Category:Mu-opioid agonists Category:Cyclohexenes ","title":"Tilidine"},{"id":"13315870","title":"Israeli Chess Championship"},{"id":"13315871","text":"KOZT (95.3 FM) The Coast is a radio station broadcasting an Album Oriented Rock format.

The everyday phenomenon is that a small part of a memory can remind a person of the entire memory, for example, “recalling an entire song when a few notes are played.” In cognitive psychology the word is used in reference to phenomena in the field of memory, where it is defined as \\"the use of long-term knowledge to facilitate recall.\\"Allen Baddeley (2007). Working Memory, Thought, and Action. Oxford, Oxford University Press, p. 24 The process is hypothesised to be working as \\"pattern completion\\", where previous knowledge is used to facilitate the completion of the partially degraded memory trace. Proust The great literary example of redintegration is Marcel Proust's novel Remembrance of Things Past. The conceit is that the entire seven-volume novel consists of the memories triggered by the taste of a madeleine soaked in lime tea. \\"I had recognized the taste of the crumb of madeleine soaked in her concoction of lime-flowers which my aunt used to give to me. Immediately the old grey house upon the street, where her room was, rose up like the scenery of a theatre to attach itself to the little pavilion, opening on to the garden, which had been built out behind it for my parents\\", ... for seven volumes. (See List of longest novels.) Associationists Redintegration was one of the memory phenomena that the Associationist school of philosophical psychologists sought to explain and used as evidence supporting their theories. Contemporary Memory Research In the study of item recall in working memory, memories that have partially decayed can be recalled in their entirety. It is hypothesized that this is accomplished by a redintegration process, which allows the entire memory to be reconstructed from the temporary memory trace by using the subject's previous knowledge. The process seems to work because of the redundancy of language. The effects of long-term knowledge on memory’s trace reconstruction have been shown for both visual and auditory presentation and recall. The mechanism of redintegration is still not fully understood and is being actively researched.  Models of Redintegration = Multinomial Processing Tree  Schweickert (1993) attempted to model memory redintegration using a multinomial processing tree. In a multinomial processing tree, the cognitive processes and their outcomes are represented with branches and nodes, respectively. The outcome of the cognitive effort is dependent on which terminal node is reached. In Schweickert model of recall, the trace of memory can be either intact or partially degraded. If the trace is intact, memory can be restored promptly and accurately. The node for correct recall is reached, and the recall process is terminated. If the memory has partially degraded, the item must be reconstructed through trace redintegration. If the process of redintegration was successful, the memory is recalled correctly. Thus, the probability of correct recall (P_C) is:P_C = I + R*(1-I)Where: > I is the probability of trace being intact, and R is the probability of > correct redintegration. If the trace is neither intact nor successfully completely redintegrated, person fails to accurately recall the memory. = Trace Redintegration = Schweickert proposed that the redintegration of memory trace happens through two independent processes. In the lexical process, the memory trace is attempted to be converted into a word. In the phonemic process, the memory trace is attempted to be converted into a string of phenomes. Consequently, the probability of correct redintegration (R), becomes a function of L (lexical process) and/or P (phonemic process). These processes are autonomous, and their effect on R depends on whether they take place sequentially or non- sequentially. Schweickert’s explanation of trace redintegration is analogous to the processes hypothesized to be responsible for repairs of errors in speech. Though Schweickert indicates that the process of trace redintegration may be facilitated by the context of the situation in which recall takes place (e.g. syntax, semantics), his model does not provide details on the potential influences of such factors. = Extensions = Schweickert’s model was extended by Gathercole and colleagues (1999), who added a concept of degraded trace. Their model of the multinomial processing tree included an additional node, which represents a decayed memory. Such degraded trace can no longer undergo redintegration, and the outcome of recall is incorrect. Thus, the probability of correct recall (P_C) changes to: P_C = I + R*(1-I-T)Where: > I is the probability of trace being intact, R is the probability of correct > redintegration, and T is the probability of trace being entirely lost. = Criticism = The main criticism of Schweickert model concerns its discrete nature. The model treats memory in a binomial manner, where trace can be either intact, leading to correct recall, or partially decayed, with subsequent successful or unsuccessful redintegration. It does not explain the factors underlying the intactness, and cannot account for the differences in the number of incorrect attempts of recall of different items. Moreover, the model does not incorporate the concept of the degree of memory degradation, implying that the level of trace’s decay does not affect the probability of redintegration. This issue was approached by Roodenrys and Miller (2008), whose alternative account of redintegration uses constrained Rasch model to portray trace degradation as a continuous process.  Influencing Factors = Lexicality  In immediate recall, trace reconstruction is more accurate for words than for non-words. This has been labelled as the lexicality effect. The effect is hypothesized to occur due to the differences in the presence and availability of phonological representations. Contrarily to non-words, words possess stable mental representations of the accompanying sounds. Such representation can be retrieved from previous knowledge, facilitating the redintegration of item from the memory trace. The lexicality effect is commonly used to support the importance of long-term memory in the redintegration processes.  Item Similarity  The redintegration of memory traces may be affected by both semantic and phonological similarity of items which are to be recalled. Semantic similarity effect refers to the higher accuracy of redintegration for lists containing semantically homogenous items, than for those with semantically heterogeneous items. This has been attributed to the differences in the accessibility of different memories in the long-term store. When words are presented in semantically homogenous lists, other items may guide the trace reconstruction, providing a cue for item search. This increases the availability of certain memories and facilitates the redintegration process. An example would be a redintegration attempt for a word from a list of animal names. The semantic consistency of words evokes the memories associated with this matter, making the animal names more accessible in the memory. Contrarily, redintegration has been shown to be hindered for items sharing phonological features. This has been attributed to the “trace competition”, where errors in redintegration are caused by mistaking the items on the lists. This effect could arise for example for the words auction (/ˈɔːkʃ(ə)n/) and audience (/ˈɔːdiəns/). The effect of phonological similarity on redintegration may differ depending on the position of phenomes shared within the items.  Word Frequency  Word frequency effect refers to the higher accuracy of redintegration processes for the words that are encountered more frequently in the language. This effect has been attributed to the differences in the availability of items stored in long-term memory. Frequently encountered words are hypothesized to be more accessible for subsequent recall, which facilitates the reconstruction of memory redintegration of the partially degraded trace.  Phonotactic Frequency  Phonotactic frequency effect refers to the pattern in memory redintegration, in which trace reconstruction is more accurate for items that contain phoneme combination that is frequently represented in the language. Though this effect is similar to the Word Frequency Effect, it can also explain patterns in redintegration of non-word items.  Others  Other factors which have been shown to facilitate redintegration include the ease of item imageability, familiarity with the language, and word concreteness.

He is best known for Meusnier's theorem on the curvature of surfaces, which he formulated while he was at the École Royale du Génie (Royal School of Engineering). He also discovered the helicoid. He worked with Lavoisier on the decomposition of water and the evolution of hydrogen. Dirigible balloon Meusnier is sometimes portrayed as the inventor of the dirigible, because of an uncompleted project he conceived in 1784, not long after the first balloon flights of the Montgolfiers, and presented to the French Academy of Sciences. This concerned an elliptical balloon (ballonet) 84 metres long, with a capacity of 1,700 cubic metres, powered by three propellors driven by 80 men. The basket, in the form of a boat, was suspended from the canopy on a system of three ropes.  Jacques Charles and Les Frères Robert  After their successful hydrogen balloon flights in 1783, professor Jacques Charles and the Robert brothers built an elongated, steerable craft that followed Jean Baptiste Meusnier's proposals. Their design incorporated Meusnier's internal ballonnet (air cell), a rudder, and a method of propulsion.Biographical dictionary of the history of technology, Volume 39 By Lance Day, Ian McNeil. Charles, Jacques Alexandre Cesar On 15 July 1784 the brothers flew for 45 minutes from Saint-Cloud to Meudon with M. Collin-Hullin and Louis Philippe II, the Duke of Chartres in their elongated balloon. Rather than 80 men it was fitted with oars for propulsion and direction, but these proved useless. The absence of a gas release valve also meant that the duke had to slash the envelope to prevent it rupturing when they reached an altitude of about 4,500 metres (15,000 ft).Federal Aviation Administration - F.A.Aviation News, October 2001, Balloon Competitions and Events Around the Globe, Page 15Federation Aeronautique Internationale, Ballooning Commission, Hall of Fame, Robert Brothers.

Liubice was located at the confluence of the Schwartau with the Trave across from Teerhof Island, approximately fourHerrmann, p. 173 kilometres north of Lübeck's island old town. The residence of Henry, the Christian prince of the Obotrites, Liubice was destroyed after his death by the pagan Rani of Rugia. Old Lubeck History Slavic tribes began migrating to the Bay of Lübeck in the 7th century, replacing migrating Germanic tribes. The Wagrians and Polabians established numerous villages and castles, including Starigard, Plune, Racisburg, and Liubice, whose name means \\"lovely\\". Liubice was sparsely populated during the 9th and 10th centuries. In the middle of the 11th century, the settlement began to develop. Starting in 1055 during the rule of Gottschalk, a Christian prince of the Obotrite confederacy, the old castle was rebuilt. Gottschalk was killed during an uprising in 1066 and replaced as Obotrite prince by the pagan Kruto. Liubice's castle was modified for the second time in 1087, near the end of Kruto's reign. Because the fortifications were located on a peninsula between the Schwartau and Trave Rivers, a twelve metre wide trench was created to separate Liubice from the mainland, essentially creating an island fortress. Liubice reached its height during the reign of the prince or \\"King of the Slavs\\", the Christian Henry, who avenged his father Gottschalk's death by killing Kruto in 1093. The harbour settlement of Liubice, which lay in the borderland between the Wagrians, Polabians, and Obotrites, was chosen as Henry's royal residence. The relatively small castle's walls had a diameter of approximately 75 to 100 metres. The castle church built by Henry c. 1100 was the earliest discernible stone construction in the region; members of the princely family were buried inside the church.Herrmann, p. 147 The princely palace probably lay northwest of the castle's own Christian church, while a granary was east of the church. Cattle stalls were located to the southeast next to the ramparts. The castle complex also contained houses for the garrison and probably goldsmithing workshops or a mint.Herrmann, p. 175 The castle was surrounded by a wooden earthworks with a southern gate. Southwest of the castle under the protection of its walls was a settlement of craftsmen. To the northwest across the trench was a poorer settlement, probably of servants. To the southwest across the Trave was a colony of foreign, mostly Saxon, merchants who were allowed their own Christian church.Herrmann, p. 261 Around 1100 Liubice was besieged by the fleet of the pagan Rani, but with the assistance of Saxons from Holstein, Henry forced the Rani to pay tribute.Herrmann, p. 218 The Obotrite state collapsed after the death of Henry and end of the Nakonid dynasty in 1127; the Rani returned to sack Liubice in 1128. With the death of Canute Lavard in 1131, the Obotrite lands were partitioned between Niklot, who received Mecklenburg, and Pribislav, who received Wagria and Polabia. Pribislav chose Liubice as his residence in order to assert his claims for the inheritance of Henry,Herrmann, p. 319 but he was reduced to being a Saxon vassal in Wagria after being defeated by Henry of Badewide in the late 1130s. Liubice and the Oldenburg region were ravaged by another Rani campaign in 1138 in which the castle's church was destroyed. Granted Wagria and Segeberg by Duke Henry the Lion in 1143, Count Adolf II of Holstein founded the new German settlement of Lübeck four kilometres from Liubice on a peninsula called Bucu at the confluence of the Wakenitz with the Trave.Herrmann, p. 320 The remaining Slavic inhabitants of the region held their assemblies at Lübeck's Marienkirche until the 13th century. Some of the older Slavic laws were incorporated into Lübeck's city code, Lübeck law. Excavation Archaeological findings in the 1970s indicated that Liubice was older than previously thought. The oldest wall dates back to 819, while further sections of the wall date to 1055 and 1087. Dendrochronological date indicates two repairs on the wall and activity inside of the castle in 1002 and 1035. The stone church, discovered in 1852, was preceded by a wooden church. Plaiting and block construction were found scattered inside the ruins of the castle complex.

The ship was laid down in 1916 and launched on 25 April 1917; she was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 28 March 1918. She and her sister were the only two of her class to be completed; eight of her sisters were scrapped before they could be completed. The ships were an incremental improvement over the preceding cruisers. Dresden was commissioned into service with the High Seas Fleet eight months before the end of World War I; as a result, her service career was limited and she did not see action. She participated in a fleet operation to Norway to attack British convoys to Scandinavia, but they failed to locate any convoys and returned to port. Dresden was to have participated in a climactic sortie in the final days of the war, but a revolt in the fleet forced Admirals Reinhard Scheer and Franz von Hipper to cancel the operation. The ship was interned in Scapa Flow after the end of the war and scuttled with the fleet there on 21 June 1919, under orders from the fleet commander Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter. Design Dresden was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced normally and up to at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of two sets of steam turbines, which drove a pair of screw propellers. Steam was provided by eight coal-fired and six oil-fired Marine-type water-tube boilers. The boilers were ducted into three funnels amidships. Her engines were rated to produce for a top speed of and a range of approximately at . Her crew consisted of 17 officers and 542 enlisted men. The ship was armed with eight SK L/45 guns in single pedestal mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle, four were located amidships, two on either side, and two were arranged in a super firing pair aft.Gardiner & Gray, p. 162 These guns fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of . The guns had a maximum elevation of 30 degrees, which allowed them to engage targets out to .Gardiner & Gray, p. 140 They were supplied with 1,040 rounds of ammunition, for 130 shells per gun. Dresden also carried three SK L/45 anti-aircraft guns mounted on the centerline astern of the funnels, though one was removed in 1918. She was also equipped with a pair of torpedo tubes with eight torpedoes in deck-mounted swivel launchers amidships. She also carried 200 mines. The ship was protected by a waterline armored belt that was thick amidships. The conning tower had thick sides, and the armor deck was covered with 60 mm thick armor plate. Service history Dresden was ordered under the contract name \\"Ersatz \\" and was laid down at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg in 1916.Gröner, p. 114 She was launched on 25 April 1917, after which fitting-out work commenced. She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 28 March 1918.Gröner, p. 115 After her commissioning, Dresden joined the reconnaissance screen for the High Seas Fleet. She was the last light cruiser built by the Kaiserliche Marine.Herwig, p. 205 The ship was assigned to II Scouting Group, alongside the cruisers , , , , and .Woodward, p. 116 The ships were in service in time for the major fleet operation to Norway in 23–24 April 1918. I Scouting Group and II Scouting Group, along with the Second Torpedo-Boat Flotilla, were to attack a heavily guarded British convoy to Norway, with the rest of the High Seas Fleet steaming in support.Halpern, p. 418 The Germans failed to locate the convoy, which had in fact sailed the day before the fleet left port. As a result, Admiral Reinhard Scheer broke off the operation and returned to port.Halpern, p. 419 In October 1918, Dresden and the rest of II Scouting Group were to lead a final attack on the British navy. Dresden, Cöln, Pillau, and Königsberg were to attack merchant shipping in the Thames estuary while the rest of the Group were to bombard targets in Flanders, to draw out the British Grand Fleet. Scheer intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, in order to secure a better bargaining position for Germany, whatever the cost to the fleet.Tarrant, pp. 280–281 On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on and then on several other battleships mutinied.Tarrant, pp. 281–282 The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation.Tarrant, p. 282 During the sailors' revolt, Dresden was ordered to steam to Eckernförde to serve as a relay to Kiel. Communications had been disrupted by major unrest there. The battleship laid in Dresdens path, and her unruly crew refused to move out of Dresdens way; Markgraf aimed one of her gun turrets at Dresden, but then her crew backed down and let Dresden leave the port.Woodward, p. 164 The ship then went to Swinemünde, where her crew partially scuttled her following reports that mutinous ships were en route to attack the cruisers stationed there. After these proved false, Dresden was re-floated and returned to seaworthy condition. This involved removing the ammunition for all of the guns and allowing them to air-dry.Woodward, pp. 165-166 Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet's ships, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Dresden was among the ships interned, but owing to her poor condition following the naval mutiny, she was not able to steam with the rest of the fleet in November. She arrived on 6 December, leaking badly.van der Vat, p. 129 The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Versailles Treaty. Von Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships.Herwig, p. 256 Dresden began to sink at 13:50. Her wreck lies to this day on her port side at the bottom of Scapa Flow to the south east of the island of Cava, in a depth of . Her upper decks have been badly damaged; her weather deck has fallen off, exposing her internal structure. Her guns are buried in mud.Wille, p. 392 In 2017, marine archaeologists from the Orkney Research Center for Archaeology conducted extensive surveys of Dresden and nine other wrecks in the area, including six other German and three British warships. The archaeologists mapped the wrecks with sonar and examined them with remotely operated underwater vehicles as part of an effort to determine how the wrecks are deteriorating.Gannon NotesReferences    Category:Cöln-class cruisers Category:Ships built in Kiel Category:1917 ships Category:World War I cruisers of Germany Category:World War I warships scuttled at Scapa Flow Category:Maritime incidents in 1919 Category:Wreck diving sites in Scotland ","title":"SMS Dresden (1917)"},{"id":"13316382","text":"Frédéric Caudron Palmares on Kozoom.com Retrieved 2013-03-22 Frédéric Caudron (born 27 January 1968 in Mons, Belgium) is a Belgian professional three- cushion billiards player, nicknamed \\"L'Extraterrestre\\" (\\"The Extraterrestrial\\").Profile in French He won the UMB World Three-cushion Championship in 1999 and 2013.

Davis (April 17, 1877 - March 7, 1961) operated an antiquities and folk art shop in Mexico City. Davis was an early collector and dealer in pre-Columbian and Mexican folk art and his shop was a place where Mexican Modern artists who were interested in pre-Columbian and folk art, often met. Davis was born and raised in Illinois. He came to Mexico about 1910 and worked for the Sonora News Company selling newspapers, guidebooks, and souvenirs on the Southern Pacific Railway line south from Nogales, Arizona. Davis, who was interested in folk art and pre-Columbian art of Mexico became the manager of the Sonora Company's arts and crafts showroom in Mexico City. During the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920), many Mexican antiques came on the market. After 1920, as stability returned and Americans became interested in Mexico, Davis's shop attracted collectors and other visitors. Artists of the emerging “Mexican school” were interested in both historical and contemporary folk art, so they also gravitated to Davis's shop. Davis was among the first to collect, display and sell their work. He exhibited work by Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco, and Rufino Tamayo; others who came to the shop included Miguel Covarrubias and Jean Charlot. Davis also displayed work by Americans including George Biddle, Caroline Durieux, and William Spratling. In 1927, Davis hired Rene d'Harnoncourt as his assistant. D'Harnoncourt worked with Davis until 1933, helping in the purchase and sale of art objects and organizing displays and exhibits in the showroom. Davis was also a noted silversmith and produced numerous pieces of Mexican jewelry. Davis was gay, but few accounts of his life mention this fact. In 1933, Davis left the Sonora News Company and became head of the department of antiques and fine crafts in Frank Sanborn's Mexico City store. He continued supporting Mexican artists and craftsmen by displaying and selling their work.

Described as mild-mannered and quiet, he developed a deep grudge against a prominent neighboring Jewish family over a business dispute. Menten travelled back to the Netherlands in 1939, when Russia invaded eastern Poland. He was in Cracow in 1940 where he worked as a Treuhänder (Aryaniser) of a number of Jewish art dealerships. He returned to Poland in 1941 after the Nazi counter- occupation—this time as a member of the SS. Menten was involved in the massacre of Polish professors in Lviv and robbery of their property. According to witnesses, he helped shoot as many members of the offending family in Galicia as he could find, then turned on other Jews in the area. Trial Menten in the SS Totenkopfverbände, 1941 While travelling in his personal train with his prized art collection, he was recognized by Dutch Resistance fighters. He was brought to trial. His chief defense lawyer was Rad Kortenhorst, President of the Dutch House of Representatives. The controversial trial concluded in 1949, with the prosecution unable to prove most allegations, and Menten was sentenced to an eight-month term for having worked in uniform as a Nazi interpreter. In 1951 the Dutch government refused a Polish request for Menten's extradition. Menten would go on to become a successful art collector and businessman. His 20-room mansion was filled with valuable art work (Nicolaes Maes, Francisco Goya, Jan Sluyters, etc.) and he held vast areas of real estate. In 1976, the case was reopened. During the trial, Menten's mansion was set ablaze after a survivor of Dachau concentration camp threw a petrol bomb onto its thatched roof. The building suffered extensive damage and some of the art collection was destroyed. In 1980 Menten was sentenced to 10 years in prison and was fined 100,000 guilders for war crimes, including being accessory to the murder of 20 Jewish villagers in 1941 Poland. Upon his release he believed he would settle in his County Waterford mansion in Ireland only to find out Garret FitzGerald, Taoiseach at the time, had barred him from the country. Menten died at a senior's home in Loosdrecht, Netherlands.

History Cosmo traces its corporate roots to Maruzen Petroleum (丸善石油株式会社), a company established in 1931, although the oil business operated by Maruzen was originally established by Zenzo Matsumura in Kobe in 1907. Cosmo Oil Company was formed on April 1, 1986, through the merger of Maruzen Petroleum and Daikyo Petroleum, a group of oil businesses based in Niigata Prefecture, which merged in 1939. A major fire occurred at the Cosmo refinery in Ichihara, as a result of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake. It was extinguished after ten days, injuring six people and destroying storage tanks The ultimate cause was traced to the collapse of supports for LPG Tank 364, which had been filled with water and undergoing hydrostatic testing at the time the earthquake struck. The collapse fractured LPG pipes, releasing gas that then ignited, in turn igniting LPG in several adjacent tanks. In February 2015, the company said it will reorganize itself under a holding company to boost profitability. Also in 2015, in March, Cosmo Oil formed an LPG joint-venture, by merging its LPG business with three other company's LPG units. The new company, named Gyxis Corporation, started effective operations on April 1, 2015.

As Viceroy of India, George Curzon directed extensive repairs and restoration of Akbar's mausoleum, which were completed in 1905. Curzon discussed restoration of the mausoleum and other historical buildings in Agra in connection with the passage of the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act in 1904, when he described the project as \\"an offering of reverence to the past and a gift of recovered beauty to the future\\". This preservation project may have discouraged veneration of the mausoleum by pilgrims and people living nearby.

It is a locked room mystery and features the series detective Sir Henry Merrivale and his long-time associate, Scotland Yard's Chief Inspector Humphrey Masters. Plot summary The Dell mapback edition of 1950 is subtitled \\"Murder in the Zoo\\". Edward Benton, director of the Royal Albert Zoological Gardens, is worried about what the year 1941 will bring to his beloved collection of snakes and reptiles; it seems as if they will be destroyed, at the request of the Department of Home Security, to prevent poisonous snakes from escaping in the case of an air raid. Nevertheless, he is still making arrangements to add to the exhibits, including a recent acquisition, \\"Patience\\", a tree-snake from Borneo. Accomplished stage magicians Carey Quint and Madge Palliser, whose families’ professional rivalry goes back four generations, are visiting the zoo, each to research certain snakes in connection with an illusion which both claim was invented by an ancestor. They quarrel, and somehow the glass cage breaks that encloses a tropical American lizard. The lizard immediately attacks Sir Henry Merrivale, also a visitor. After the lizard is subdued, all three are led by the security guard to Dr. Benton's home on the grounds, to make their explanations and apologies. He is easily mollified, and his daughter Louise invites all three to dinner that evening. Louise is worried about her father's mental equilibrium. When the three arrive to find what seems to be an empty house, with dinner burning away merrily in the kitchen, they are perplexed. Then they discover Dr. Benton has apparently locked all the doors and windows of his study, sealed them with paper strips, and gassed himself. Louise asks Sir Henry to investigate because she is sure that, even in committing suicide, her father would not have killed the innocent tree- snake, Patience. Sir Henry must investigate against the backdrop of England in 1940, with airplanes constantly buzzing overhead. The involvement of two professional magicians, however, points out a path to a solution — to make people think they've experienced something which indeed they have not. Sir Henry corners the murderer and extracts a confession in a dramatic climax that involves a rattlesnake, a mamba and a cobra.

It is stationed at McConnell Air Force Base, Kansas, and is part of Air Mobility Command (AMC)'s Eighteenth Air Force. The group's primary mission is to provide global reach by conducting air refueling and airlift where and when needed. The group directs the 22d Wing's Boeing KC-135R Stratotanker refueling and airlift operations in support of worldwide AMC, United States Transportation Command, Air Force, Department of Defense, and allied operations anywhere in the world. During World War II, as the 22d Bombardment Group, the unit was one of the first Army Air Forces units to be deployed into the Pacific Theater after Pearl Harbor with the Martin B-26 Marauder medium bomber. It operated primarily in the Southwest Pacific Theater as a North American B-25 Mitchell unit assigned to Fifth Air Force. It was awarded two Distinguished Unit Citations and the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation for its combat service in China, the Netherlands East Indies, New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago; the Western Pacific; Leyte and Luzon. The group was reactivated as part of Strategic Air Command (SAC). During the early years of the Cold War, the group moved temporarily to Okinawa in July 1950 and was attached to Far East Air Forces for duty in the Korean War. It began combat immediately, and until October 1950 attacked marshalling yards, bridges, highways, airfields, and industries and supported United Nations ground forces in Korea. It was inactivated in a SAC program to eliminate groups and assign operational squadrons directly to wings. Units and mission The 22d Operations Group uses five squadrons and their assigned personnel to execute the wing's air refueling and airlift missions, from the continental United States refueling support to unit deployments in support of theater operations worldwide. * 344th Air Refueling Squadron * 349th Air Refueling Squadron * 350th Air Refueling Squadron With these air refueling squadrons, the group supervises operations in support of strategic force projection and mobility, special operations, tactical air operations, and humanitarian assistance efforts. *22d Operations Support Squadron :The squadron provides airfield management, air traffic control, intelligence, combat crew communications, base weather service, mission scheduling, planning, and combat tactics. History :For related history and lineage, see 22d Air Refueling Wing Origins The authorizing document was a letter issued by the Adjutant-General's Office titled \\"The Constitution and Activation of Certain Air Corps Units\\". Lieutenant Colonel Ross F. Cole was the first Group Commander. The first elements of the Group included: * 2d Bombardment Squadron, commanded by Captain Leslie P. Halcomb * 19th Bombardment Squadron, commanded by 1st Lieutenant Herman E. Hurst * 33d Bombardment Squadron, commanded by 1st Lieutenant Theodore E. Graff * 18th Reconnaissance Squadron (later 408th Bombardment Squadron), commanded by Captain John P. Doyle. The Group was located at Langley Field, Virginia. Its first aircraft were a few Douglas B-18 Bolo bombers, with a few North American B-25 Mitchell bombers allocated to the 18th Reconnaissance Squadron. In 1941 the Group transitioned to Martin B-26 Marauder bombers, a fast bomber with very specialized aerodynamic capabilities. These capabilities included short, stubby wings, which led the plane to be known as \\"The Flying Prostitute\\" (no visible means of support). However its flying characteristics led to many crashes, which also led to the plane being known as \\"The Flying Coffin\\". Throughout 1941 the 22d trained extensively, increasing in intensity in November 1941. It was so combat ready that 16 hours after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, the 44 planes of the 22d headed for the West Coast and on to the South West Pacific.

A ground crew team left San Francisco on 31 January 1942 for Brisbane, Queensland in Australia. On 6 February 1942, the Group's aircraft were shipped to Hickam Field (arriving about a week later). They immediately commenced patrol duties. On 22 March 1942, the first flight of the 22d air echelon arrived at Amberley Field. near Brisbane in Australia, and became the first fully armed Air Force Group to fly the Pacific en masse. They were warmly welcomed by the Australians who were concerned that, while the Japanese were threatening Australia, its troops were fighting the Germans in the Middle East. Shortly after arriving in Australia, the Group (now under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Millard L. Haskin) moved further North to the Townsville area: * 2d Bombardment Squadron (commanded by 1st Lt George R. Anderson) was based at Reid River, about 40 miles South of Townsville * 19th Bombardment Squadron (commanded by 1st Lt Elliott H. Reed) was based at Garbutt field. * 33d Bombardment Squadron (commanded by 1st Lt William A. Garnett) was based Antill Plains, 20 miles South of Townsville. * 408th Bombardment Squadron (commanded by Captain Brian O'Neill) was also based at Reid River On 5 April 1942, the 22d took off from Garbutt Field for its first combat action, an attack on Rabaul in New Britain (North of New Guinea). In this attack on the Japanese Naval Base, the Group sunk a transport ship but lost a plane and the life of S/Sgt Bourne. Meanwhile, four B-26 Marauders, including two from the 18th Reconnaissance Squadron, left behind at Hawaii, saw action on 4 June 1942 as part of the air attack in the Battle of Midway, and were the first Army planes to make a torpedo attack. These planes, piloted by 1st Lieutenant Herbert C. Mayes and 1st Lieutenant James P. Muri attacked the Japanese Naval Invasion Force, focusing torpedo and strafing action on its aircraft carrier.

Following its conversion to Liberators, on 11 February 1944 the 22d was redesignated 22d Bombardment Group, Heavy. The group was tasked to bomb Japanese airfields, shipping, and oil installations in Borneo, Ceram, and Halmahera. It began raiding the southern Philippines in September 1944 to neutralize Japanese bases in preparation for the invasion of Leyte. From December 1944 to August 1945, the group struck airfields and installations on Luzon, supported Australian ground forces on Borneo, and bombed railways and industries in Formosa and China. Near the end of the war the 22d moved to Okinawa in August 1945 and flew some armed reconnaissance missions over southern Japan. Postwar era The 22d's staff and aircraft were released and the group moved to Clark Air Base in the Philippines in November 1945. In April 1946 the 22d returned to Okinawa as the 22d Bombardment Group, Very Heavy and was remanned and assigned Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers, operating from Kadena Air Base.

The 22d was one of two SAC groups selected to deploy to the Pacific after SAC was directed to reinforce the 19th Bombardment Wing of Far East Air Forces. The 22d was selected because removing it from SAC control would have a minimum impact on the SAC mission because its planes were not yet equipped for the delivery of nuclear weapons and would not impact SAC's task of building a credible deterrent to the Soviet Union.Deaile, pp. 167-168 The 22d Bombardment Group deployed its B-29 Superfortresses in early July 1950 to Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, where it came under control of FEAF Bomber Command (Provisional). On 13 July, the group flew its first mission, against the marshalling yards and oil refinery at Wonsan, North Korea. By 21 October, it had amassed fifty-seven missions against the enemy, attacking bridges, factories, industrial targets, troop concentrations, airfields, marshalling yards, communications centers, and port facilities. During four months of combat, the group flew 335 sorties with only fourteen aborts and dropped over 6,500 tons of bombs. When the 22d returned to March Air Force Base in late October or early November 1950, 335 sorties had been flown. One plane, 44-62279, was reported lost during operations from Okinawa. Combat components of the group were the 2nd, 19th and 33rd Bombardment Squadrons. It became a records unit in February 1951, inactivated on 16 June 1952. Modern era After activation in 1991, commenced air refueling missions. Using KC-10 aircraft, the group airlifted humanitarian equipment and supplies to Somalia, 1992–1994. Deployed group aircrews and aircraft on other contingency operations in many parts of the world, including Haiti in 1994 and Serbia in 1999.

Allegations of assassinations In February 2004, Christos Pourgourides of the Council of Europe's Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights reported concerns suggesting that Dmitri Pavlichenko, along with other \\"senior officials of the State\\" had been involved in the assassination of several people, including senior politicians. He stated that the Chief of the Criminal Police of Belarus, General Lapatik, in a handwritten note on November 21, 2000, accused Dmitri Pavlichenko of assassinating Jury Zacharanka, a former Minister of the Interior who disappeared on May 7, 1999, with a PB pistol, normally used for carrying out the death penalty at SIZO-1 prison, officially signed out from SIZO-1 on the orders of the Minister of the Interior, Sivakov. He also stated suspicions that Pavlichenko was involved in the disappearances of Victor Gonchar, Vice-President of the Parliament of Belarus and businessman Anatoly Krasovski on September 16, 1999. Pavlichenko was arrested on November 22, 2000. According to Pourgourides' report, the warrant stated (translation) While the warrant stated that the detention would be for 30 days, Pavlichenko was released a few days later, either on November 23 (according to Prosecutor General Viktor Sheyman, who became Prosecutor General on November 27) or on November 27 (according to Colonel Oleg Alkayev, head of SIZO-1 at the time, who later was accepted for political asylum in Germany). Pourgourides states that the Zakharenko family's lawyer, Volchek, stated that President Alexander Lukashenko had personally ordered Pavlichenko's release from prison. The Head of KGB (Mackiewicz) and other top Belarusian officials were fired for the arrest. He also states that the Minister of Agriculture, Leonov, had personally told him that Lukashenko had \\"violently criticised the KGB for arresting Pavlichenko\\" on television. Lukashenko also immediately (in November 2000) fired the Head of KGB and some other top Belarusian officials for the arrest of Pavlichenko and attempts to investigate the murders. The above- mentioned general Lapatik had to retire at the age of 54. The Governing Council of the Inter-Parliamentary Union has expressed its concern about these allegations and Pavlichenko is now subject to international financial sanctions among with several other Belarusian senior officials and politicians. In December 2019, Deutsche Welle published a documentary film in which Yury Garavski, a former member of a special unit of the Belarusian Ministry of Internal Affairs, confirmed that it was his unit which had arrested, taken away Yury Zacharanka, Viktar Hanchar and Anatol Krassouski and that it was Pavlichenko who by hand shot them dead.Belarus: How death squads targeted opposition politicians References Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:People from Vitebsk Category:Forced disappearance ","title":"Dmitri Pavlichenko"},{"id":"13316678","text":"Khuiratta () or Khoi ratta is a town in Kotli District, in Pakistan- administered Azad Kashmir.

General information  Tortuguero Lagoon Nature Reserve is the only freshwater lagoon in Puerto Rico. It contains about 708 million gallons of water. The reserve was designated in 1979 through a program of Coastal Zone Management PR. It is located between the municipalities of Vega Baja and Manatí. It covers approximately 2.43 km2. It is divided into two main parts: in the east and northeast, the Laguna Grande (\\"Big Lagoon\\" in English), and in the south, the Laguna Rica. A swamp located northeast of the pond, El Cabo Caribe (\\"Cape Caribbean\\" in English), includes one of the most important areas of the reserve as a source of nesting and feeding waterflow ecosystem. Generally, Tortuguero is made up of swamps, marshes, soils of silica sand and hills. Although not a forest, its variety of rare endemic plants and flowers has earned it a place amongst the most important reserves in Puerto Rico, just after El Yunque, Toro Negro State Forest and the Forest of Maricao.  Native, exotic and endemic species in the reserve  Native species: * Eels of the genus Anguila * Chad (Elops saurus) * Common snook (Centropomus undecimalis) * Big-eye scad mackerel or horse-eye jack (Caranx latus) Endemic species: * Puerto Rican spindalis (Spindalis portoricensis) * Puerto Rican oriole (Icterus portoricensis) * Adelaide's warbler (Setophaga adelaidae) Exotic species: * Caiman (Caiman crocodilus) * Black seabream or chopa (Spondyliosoma cantharus) * Tilapia (Oreochromis urolepis)  Flora  The flora of this reserve is the fourth most important in Puerto Rico.

RiftSpace was released almost simultaneously with Star Wraith IV: Reviction. Whereas the Star Wraith series prior to the release of Riftspace in 2004 had been purely military, RiftSpace is a freeform mercenary game. Its successor is the Evochron franchise, none of which were or are freeware games. Story An ancient Vonari prophecy tells of a mysterious system called RiftSpace, a system that will be found by an outsider to shelter a dying race. The player was to unravel clues and find pieces of a puzzle to discover RiftSpace, where the player would be faced by Vonari guardians of the system. Gameplay When beginning Riftspace, the player begins with the most basic ship, a second-level weapon (out of three), four Viper missiles (the second out of seven missile types) and 60,000 of the game's monetary system, which is not named in Riftspace. This form of money is usually referred to as credits. Throughout the game, it is possible to upgrade your weapon to the third type or downgrade to the first, which take more and less energy respectively and deal more or less damage, with a slower or faster rate of fire. It is also possible to obtain up to three wingmen, which have a skill and loyalty rating. As the missions go on, they will request pay raises until their loyalty reaches 100, and their skill will gradually increase. Loyalty rating is used as a percentage factor to determine whether or not a wingman will leave upon return to wherever you obtained the contract. To progress past a certain point and obtain better ships and weaponry, it is necessary to leave the starting system and the protection of the Alliance and the Mercenaries Guild. Each planet specializes in one or more areas; for example, weapons on the planet Deneb are much less expensive then on the planet Fauston. Outside Alliance territory, the player is likely to find more lucrative areas, but the contracts will be more dangerous. After following the clue trail and obtaining all of the artifacts (which lead the player on a wild goose chase to locate the rest, the last giving the location of the RiftSpace portal), the player may progress through the red wormhole leading to RiftSpace. Once there, 9 Vonari guardians must be fended off, at which point the game will initiate a cutscene showing the player and any wingmen that accompany the player flying towards the planet, at which point a few lines of text appear at the bottom-left of the screen concluding the storyline. The screen then fades out, and the player is returned to the pilot selection screen. Licensing changes As of January 2008, StarWraith has released RiftSpace as freeware.

Simon & Schuster) Hey Rube: Blood Sport, the Bush Doctrine, and the Downward Spiral of Dumbness is a book by Hunter S. Thompson, consisting of 83 articles split into three parts. The articles were first published on ESPN.com's Page 2 under Thompson’s column Hey Rube. First published in mid-2004, the book contains articles from November 20, 2000, to October 13, 2003. It is sub-titled, Modern History from the Sports Desk. This was the final book Thompson published before his death in February 2005.  Synopsis  Most of the columns were written primarily as sports commentary, but tend to branch into other subjects—commonly politics and social commentary—either due to a perceived relevance to the sports news, or as a result of Thompson's natural discursive tendencies. Some articles are focused on subjects entirely outside sports, such as \\"Fear and Loathing in America\\" and \\"Love Blooms in the Rockies\\", which deal with the 9/11 attacks and Thompson's marriage, respectively. Thompson also chimes in on world events at the time of writing the articles. He voices his distaste for the 2000 presidential election, promotes warning as he writes through September 11, and tells of his crusade to free Lisl Auman, who had been sentenced to 20 years in prison in connection to the murder of a police officer. Included in Hey Rube is a copy of a personal report written about Thompson during his time in the United States Air Force at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. It requests that he be reassigned duties and advises that Thompson should not do any unauthorized writing or accept outside employment with local media. Thompson also includes a personal political statement and an “Honor Roll” which includes the names of such figures as Johnny Depp, Fidel Castro, Al Gore, and Anita Thompson. The title is taken from the 19th century slogan \\"Hey, Rube!\\", a slang term of circus folk used to rally other carnies to their aid during a fight with a patron from the local town. Thompson elaborates in the introduction on the meaning of the term and the zeitgeist of old-fashioned circuses from the golden era that spawned the term.

It is a medium to large snake, found in coastal areas and adjacent ranges of south-eastern Australia. It is the most southerly occurring python in the world and is found at higher altitudes than any other species of Australian python. Description M. s. spilota is quite variable in colour and pattern, typically being predominantly dark olive to black in colour with most dorsal scales having a yellow (or cream) spot in the centre (hence spilota, meaning spotted). Along the body and tail are numerous clusters of yellow or cream scales that form \\"rosettes\\" that look a bit like diamonds (hence the common name). The underside is white, cream or even yellowish in colour, although it is often spotted with black. The average adult size of this subspecies is usually about in total length (including tail), although it is known to reach a total length of about , with very rare specimens recorded at up to . Reproduction M. s. spilota is an oviparous snake, averaging 25 eggs in a clutch and laying up to 54 eggs. The female defends her eggs by coiling around them and shivering to regulate their temperature. She does not leave the eggs to eat during the incubation period, apart from briefly basking in the sun to raise her body temperature and then returning. Maternal care does not continue once the young have emerged. Juveniles resemble other M. spilota subspecies, although they become more distinct in their appearance as they mature. Hatchlings are typically browner in colour rather than the typical black of adult colouration and superficially resemble other carpet python subspecies. Wild diamond python in the Wallingat National Park Morelia spilota spilota (diamond python) - head of an adult, with coarse road gravel and leaf for size comparison Geographic range The subspecies M. s. spilota is found in southern coastal regions of New South Wales and Victoria. It lives in a variety of habitats, including heaths, woodland, forest, and urban areas. It is known to occupy the roof space of suburban homes, living on mice and rats.Cogger, Harold G. (2000). Reptiles and Amphibians of Australia, Sixth Edition. Sydney: New Holland Publishing Pty. Ltd. 808 pp. . It has a limited distribution range in Victoria, where it is regarded as rare and threatened by reduction in available habitat. In New South Wales, it is recorded as naturally hybridising with the closely related northern subspecies M. s. mcdowelli in the northern parts of the diamond python's range. These natural intergrades are found on the mid-north coast of NSW. M. s. spilota can be found at higher altitudes (for example, in the eastern Gippsland region and Blue Mountains) than any other member of the family Pythonidae. It is usually found on the eastern side of the Great Dividing Range, but can also be found on the ranges and occasionally some distance from the coast. It has the most southerly distribution of all python taxa. Few populations are recorded in the state of Victoria, and changes in land use have this subspecies listed as threatened with extinction. They are also known to occur in rocky habitat during winter months. Behaviour The diamond python is typically inoffensive by nature and generally reluctant to bite. This python is an ambush predators with large territories that often overlap. It moves around these territories seasonally to occupy well camouflaged positions in the warmer months and brumate in the winter months. Females have ranges up to ; males may occupy areas almost twice as large. The diamond python is often active during the day and on warm nights, although most of its time is spent waiting in ambush for passing prey. It typically remains in one position for up to two weeks, before moving to another around away. M. s. spilota kills its food by constricting and suffocating it, and preys on lizards, birds, and mammals as large as possums. It is not a danger to humans, but is capable of biting and leaving teeth in the wound if severely harassed. Taxonomy M. s. spilota is the nominate subspecies of Morelia spilota, a species first described by Lacépède. Captivity The diamond python is often kept in captivity by collectors in Australia and around the world. The capture of wild specimens is illegal; however, it is successfully bred in captivity to supply the demand for this popular reptile. It is usually fed a diet of rodents and kept in controlled environments such as a vivarium. Captive-bred and captive-raised specimens become quite tame, tolerate gentle handling, and make good pets. It is one of the few snakes that typically emerges from the egg with a placid, non-defensive nature. ReferencesFurther reading *Cogger HG (2014).

It is a locked room mystery or, more properly, a subset of that category known as an \\"impossible crime\\", and features the series detective Sir Henry Merrivale. Carr considered this one of his best impossible crime novels. Plot summary Lady Helen Loring does not believe in the ancient Egyptian curse associated with an ancient artifact, a bronze lamp that is a gift from the Egyptian government. It comes from a tomb that Helen and her father, Lord Severn, helped excavate. In defiance of the dire predictions of an Egyptian soothsayer, she brings the lamp back to Severn Hall, her ancestral home in England. At the door, Helen stepped out of the car, leaving her friends to follow her into the Hall. Less than three minutes later, they did—and Helen had vanished. On the floor, in the middle of the vast entrance hall, were her coat and the bronze lamp. Luckily, Sir Henry Merrivale is nearby and unafraid of any and all spirits and soothsayers; after a murder shocks the inhabitants of Severn Hall, he solves both the disappearance and the murder.

The C-132 would have been the largest aircraft of its era. Development In January , the United States Air Force (USAF) issued a request for a preliminary design of a heavy cargo transport aircraft. The aircraft needed the ability to transport of payload . By December , the USAF selected a proposal from the Douglas Aircraft Company, which would serve as a cargo transport and as an air-to-air refueling tanker. The Douglas design was given the designation of C-132 by April , and a mockup of the C-132 was built in February . Douglas announced in December 1954 that the C-132 would be powered by the Pratt & Whitney T57 engine, a new turboprop in the class. The T57 would be flight tested on a Douglas C-124 Globemaster II testbed aircraft. The USAF expected the T57 engine to be flown experimentally within two years, and it hoped the engine would be operational within five years. At about the same time, USAF leadership began speaking about a turboprop aircraft that could transport across the Atlantic Ocean in ten hours. The next month, the USAF confirmed that the C-132 was the aircraft with that capability, which meant the C-132 would have more payload capacity than three Douglas C-124Bs, then the largest cargo transport aircraft. In November , the USAF announced that the mockup would be moved from Douglas's main Santa Monica, California factory to its Tulsa, Oklahoma plant, where production of the C-132 would occur if a production contract was awarded. The mockup was set up in the Tulsa factory by January . While the move was being made, flight testing of the T57 engine was planned for early 1956, but the engine did not fly until early autumn of 1956. In its May 1956 congressional testimony, the USAF praised the C-132 tankering capabilities, including its large capacity, low cargo costs per ton-mile, and ability to fly at high altitudes, but it then canceled the tanker version of the aircraft in mid-1956. The USAF offered more details about the C-132 in October, now describing an overload payload of , a cruise speed of Mach 0.8, and a maximum speed higher than Mach 0.9. Another report at the beginning of November stated that Douglas had begun \\"cutting tin\\" on the C-132, which was described as a aircraft with a payload capacity of and the ability to carry 300-400 troops or passengers. First flight was originally planned for April , but the target slipped to mid-. The USAF had planned to buy 30 aircraft, and they would be delivered at an annual rate of six aircraft, beginning in early . On February 14, 1957, the USAF issued a news release describing the C-132 as the new \\"giant of the airways,\\" which would weigh over , carry 200,000 pounds, travel at a cruise speed faster than , transport a light tank, and have the ability to take off and land on conventional-length runways through its undercarriage setup of two nose wheels and 16 main landing gear wheels. The news release, which was carried widely in American mass-circulation newspapers and magazines, also had photographs of the C-132 mockup in Tulsa. However, the USAF retracted its statement five days later, saying that it only had a development contract with Douglas to build two C-132 prototypes, and that it was considering the termination of the project. The unauthorized news release embarrassed the USAF, since the upcoming fiscal defense budget contained almost no money for new transport aircraft. In its retraction, the USAF did not mention that on December 31, 1956, it had already sent a report to the United States Congress, informing them of its decision to remove the C-132 from its aircraft program. The project was officially cancelled on March 20, 1957, after $104 million had been allocated and $70 million of non-recoverable costs had been spent on the program. Oklahoma's congressional delegation pushed back against the cancellation, and Douglas publicly campaigned for C-132 funding restoration to improve the nation's airlift capability and allow for long-range transport of intercontinental ballistic missiles. Douglas also denied rumors that problems with the development of the engine caused the cancellation. Douglas did not respond to assertions that budget restrictions and increasing requirements from the Strategic Air Command were responsible, although in June 1956, a former USAF research and development official testified to the United States Senate that C-132 program initiation was withheld for two years, even after they had determined that the engine development risk was manageable enough to support the program's go-ahead. However, the project was not revived. No prototype was built, and the project did not get past the mockup stage. Design The C-132 was to be powered by four Pratt & Whitney T57 turboprops, mounted on a swept wing. The T57 was to be the most powerful turboprop engine in existence at the time. It also would have used the largest propeller at the time, the Hamilton Standard B48P6A propeller. The T57 turboprops provided of residual jet thrust. The XKC-132 air refueling version would only have utilized the probe and drogue (P&D;) air refueling system. That system, used primarily by the US Navy, did not find favor with the USAF. Projected speed was to be with a range of and a maximum payload of . The C-132 was a triple- decker aircraft with a cargo space measuring long, wide, and high. The main cargo hold had a usable volume of . The aircraft had a dual wheel nose landing gear, while the main landing gear had 16 wheels arranged in two coaxial quadruple wheel units that operate in tandem under each side of the fuselage.

It is presumed that Mozart wrote it to play with his sister Maria Anna (\\"Nannerl\\"). Years later he performed it in a private concert with pupil Josepha Barbara Auernhammer. The concerto was originally scored for the two pianos together with two oboes, two bassoons; two horns; and strings. Mozart later expanded the score with pairs of clarinets, trumpets and timpani in E flat and B flat. However, the authenticity of the additions is not beyond question; they do not appear in the score. The piece is in three movements: #Allegro, common time #Andante, B-flat major 3/4 #Rondo: Allegro 2/4 The concerto departs from the usual solo piano concerto with the dialogue between the two pianos as they exchange musical ideas. Mozart divides up the more striking passages quite evenly between the two pianos. Also, the orchestra is rather more quiet than in Mozart's other piano concertos, leaving much of the music to the soloists. The first movement is lyrical and \\"wonderfully spacious, as if Mozart is thoroughly enjoying himself and letting his ideas flow freely\\", as Ledbetter has noted. The middle movement is slow and refined; the orchestra stays in the background behind the pair of playful pianists. The finale is a rondo filled with rhythmic drive and, after passages of lyrical grace, there is an exuberant return to the main rondo theme.

Earlier versions of MSCDEX since 1986 were installable add-ons for MS-DOS 3.1 and higher. Overview The program is a driver executable which allows DOS programs to recognize, read, and control CD-ROMs using the High Sierra and – since version 2.0 as of 1988 – also the ISO 9660 file systems. This requires the previous loading of an appropriate CD-ROM device driver (example: OAKCDROM.SYS), usually from CONFIG.SYS. The final version of the MSCDEX program was 2.25, included with Windows 95 and used when creating bootable floppy disks with CD-ROM support. Starting with Windows 95, CD-ROM access became possible through a 32-bit CDFS driver. The driver uses the Microsoft networks interface in MS-DOS. This is the reason that at least version 3.1 of MS-DOS is required. The driver essentially looks similar to a network drive from the system perspective. It is implemented as a TSR program and an extension to the redirector interface (CDEX). Datalight ROM-DOS includes an implementation of MSCDEX. Alternatives Novell DOS 7, Caldera OpenDOS 7.01 and DR-DOS 7.02 and higher provide a functional equivalent to MSCDEX named NWCDEX, which also runs under MS-DOS and PC DOS. It has more flexible load-high capabilities, also allowing to relocate and run in protected mode through DPMS on 286 and higher processors, thereby leaving only a 7 KB stub in conventional or upper memory (in comparison to MSCDEX, which occupies some 16 KB). Using EMS with a page frame, NWCDEX can reduce its footprint even down to a few bytes in conventional memory. In contrast to MSCDEX, the driver does not depend on undocumented DOS APIs and therefore, with a third-party helper tool named INSTCDEX, can be loaded via \`INSTALL\` statements and be fully functional in CONFIG.SYS thereby increasing chances to load the driver high and, under these operating systems, allow to load other drivers not only from hard disk but also from CD-ROM while the operating system is still processing CONFIG.SYS. An alternative solution, but less flexible, some versions of DR-DOS offer to delay the installation of a driver in CONFIG.SYS until after the DOS data segment relocation via \`INSTALLLAST\`. Based on NWCDEX, IMS REAL/32, a successor to Novell's Multiuser DOS and Digital Research's Concurrent DOS, provides a similar driver named IMSCDEX. A cloaked variant of MSCDEX was provided as part of Helix Software's Multimedia Cloaking product. It uses Cloaking to relocate and run in protected mode on 386 and higher processors. Corel offered CORELCDX.COM as alternative to MSCDEX. There's a free alternative called SHSUCDX that is used with the IDE/ATA driver UIDE.SYS first released in 2005. It is often used with FreeDOS and works with other DOSes as well. In 1998, Caldera provided a DRFAT32 driver for DR-DOS to dynamically mount and unmount FAT32 volumes on DOS versions otherwise not natively supporting FAT32. DRFAT32 uses a variation and extension of the CDEX API in order to achieve this and work with older DOS versions.

It was located just south of the modern village Dorf Mecklenburg, sevenHerrmann, p. 189. kilometres (4 miles) south of the Bay of Wismar in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany. The only remnants of the ruined castle are parts of an earthen wall. Some scholars have associated Mecklenburg with the medieval trading emporium Reric.Herrmann, p. 113. Etymology The travelling merchant Ibrahim Ibn Jacub described Mecklenburg as “Nakon’s Castle” in 965. By 995 it was documented as MichelenburgHerrmann, p. 188. or Mikelenburg, meaning \\"large castle\\" in Low German. In Latin, it was known as Magnopolis. The later duchy and region of Mecklenburg derives its name from the castle. The probable Slavic name, Veligrad also (“great” or “large castle”). was commemorated in a new Schloss Weligrad built between 1896 and 1898 for Duke John Albert of Mecklenburg. History Excavations indicate that the first castle of Mecklenburg was built in the 7th or 8th century in a lowland at the tip of a lakeland peninsula.Herrmann, p. 167. It was possibly the Obotrite residence of Reric, destroyed in 808. If associated with Reric, merchants were at the castle by the beginning of the 9th century. Significant market traffic would have developed in the 10th century.; a number of silver artifacts have been found in the vicinity of the ruins. The castle of Mecklenburg became a seat of Obotrite princes by the 10th century at the latest. It lay on a route from Hamburg to Wolin, assuring the castle importance as an economic and political center. The powerful Obotrite prince resided in the castle by 965. The castle flourished as the residence of the Christian prince Gottschalk (ruled 1043-1066) and the seat of the Irish bishop John of Mecklenburg; the castle contained churches and three monasteries by 1066. During a widespread pagan rebellion later that year, Gottschalk was killed and his family fled from Mecklenburg Castle. The head of Bishop John was displayed at the pagan center of Rethra.Herrmann, p. 258. Henry, a younger son of Gottschalk, avenged his father’s death by killing the pagan usurper Kruto in 1093. However, he chose as his residence Liubice, which was near the borders of the Wagrians, Polabians, and Obotrites, instead of Mecklenburg Castle, which was in the heart of the Obotrite territory. The castle also began to lose its prominence as the Kingdom of Germany began expanding eastward. As part of Duke Henry the Lion of Saxony’s expansionary goals, the Archbishop of Bremen placed a bishop named Emmehard at Mecklenburg in 1149, as the bishopric had been vacant since 1066.Herrmann, p. 329. In 1160 King Valdemar the Great of Denmark and Henry the Lion campaigned against the Obotrite prince, Niklot, who burned his castles at Ilow, Mecklenburg, Schwerin, and Dobin in order to avoid being pinned down in sieges. Niklot was ultimately killed at Werle during the campaign, however, and the Obotrite territory was partitioned between Saxon ministeriales; Mecklenburg Castle passed to Count Heinrich von Schaten.Herrmann, p. 330. The Bishopric of Mecklenburg was replaced by the Bishopric of Schwerin in the same year. Niklot’s son Pribislav led a Slavic rebellion in 1163 against Henry the Lion and the German lords occupying Obotrite castles. Although Pribislav sacked Mecklenburg in 1164, the rebellion was eventually defeated at the Battle of Verchen later that year. In need of an ally against the Saxon nobility three years later, Henry allowed Pribislav to receive his father’s Niklot’s inheritance and became the Prince of Mecklenburg, Kessin, and Rostock. Market traffic was documented at Mecklenburg in 1168, although most of the trade was passing to Schwerin. In 1265, the castle was torn down to provide building material for the construction of a palace in the growing city of Wismar. Although the princes in Schwerin rebuilt the castle at Mecklenburg in 1277 for use as a staging point for raids, it was demolished 45 years later. The modern village of Mecklenburg developed from a mid-14th century settlement near the castle. After the cursory removal of the ruins, the rampart was used for agriculture. Georg Christian Friedrich Lisch, active from 1839-41, was the first to begin surveying the ruins. The wall was established as a memorial in 1854 by Grand Duke Friedrich Franz II of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, while reforestation with oak trees began two years later. From 1967-71, Prof. Dr. Donat of the Akademie der Wissenschaften der DDR led extensive excavations into a 52 metre (57 yard) section of the southern wall and an area of 1,175 m² (12,650 sq ft) near the ruins. The diameter of the oval inner court reached 95 to 140 metres (100 to 150 yards), while the ramparts rose 10 metres (30').Herrmann, p. 180. The street, “Am Burgwall”, leads to the still visible remnants of the castle’s rampart; the area has been used a cemetery since 1870.

It is one of Europe's few surviving theatres of the period and has been extensively restored.Goldmann, A. J., Inch by Inch, an Operatic Jewel Is Polished, The New York Times, April 16, 2018, photographs by Gordon Welters On 30 June 2012, the opera house was inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List. History It was built according to plans designed by the French architect (ca. 1709 – 1754), court builder of the Hohenzollern margrave Frederick of Brandenburg-Bayreuth and his wife Princess Wilhelmine of Prussia. It was inaugurated on the occasion of the marriage of their daughter Elisabeth Fredericka Sophie with Duke Charles Eugene of Württemberg. Interior The wooden interior was designed by Giuseppe Galli Bibiena (1696 – 1757) and his son Carlo from Bologna in an Italian Late Baroque style. The box theatre is completely preserved in its original condition, except for the curtain which was taken by Napoleon's troops on their march to the 1812 Russian campaign. The prince box was seldom used by the art-minded margravial couple, who preferred a front-row seat. Princess Wilhelmine, older sister of the Prussian king Frederick the Great, had established the margravial theatre company in 1737. In the new opera house she participated as a composer of opera works and Singspiele, as well as an actor and director. Today she features in a sound-and-light presentation for tourists. After her death in 1758, performances ceased and the building went into disuse, one reason for its good conservation status. More than one hundred years later, the stage's great depth of attracted the composer Richard Wagner, who in 1872 chose Bayreuth as festival centre and had the Festspielhaus built north of the town. The foundation stone ceremony was held on 22 May, Wagner's birthday, and included a performance of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, directed by the maestro. Parts of the 1994 biopic Farinelli were filmed in the Opera House. The theatre was the site of the annual Bayreuther Osterfestival until 2009. Each September from the year 2000 to 2009, the theatre also hosted the Bayreuth Baroque festival, with performances of early operatic rarities. The 2009 festival included performances of Andrea Bernasconi's festa teatrale, L'Huomo, to a libretto by the Margravine Wilhelmine. The theatre closed between October 2012 for extensive refurbishment and redevelopment and reopened April 12, 2018.

He is sometimes called \\"Akao Satoshi,\\" which is an alternate reading of his given name. In 1951, he founded and became the first president of the far-right Greater Japan Patriotic Party. Early Life Akao was born the son of a hardware dealer in Nagoya. Akao was sickly as a child and in high school he contracted tuberculosis. In order to aid his recovery, he was sent to manage a farm owned by his father on the island of Miyakejima. While on the island, Akao became acquainted with future chairman of the Japan Socialist Party Inejirō Asanuma as well as Inejiro's distant relative Michio Asanuma, who would later become a member of Akao's Greater Japan Patriotic Party. On the farm, Akao sought to create a utopian society by implementing a primitive form of agrarian communism based on the ideals of the \\"New Village Movement\\" advocated by poet-philosopher Saneatsu Mushanokōji. In particular, the produce of the farm was distributed in equal shares to all workers on the farm, regardless of class or social standing. However, Akao's neighbors on the island felt threatened by his practices, and managed to swindle the farm from him through legalistic maneuvers. \\"Conversion\\" to ultranationalism Disillusioned by the failure of his experiments with communism, Akao returned to the mainland and settled in Tokyo, where he began to dabble in Socialism, under the influence of Toshihiko Sakai, Hitoshi Yamakawa, Sakae Osugi, and Motoyuki Takabatake. However after being drafted into military service, Akao made a speech critical of the Emperor System and was arrested and imprisoned. While imprisoned in 1926, he \\"converted\\" (tenkō suru) to ultranationalism. Thereafter, he became a vocal opponent of the Soviet Union and Communism. He helped found and was the first president of the Kenkokukai, or National Foundation Society, a major ultranationalist organization of the 1920s that ultimately reached a nationwide membership of around 120,000. He was a close associate of Uesugi Shinkichi, who allowed Akao to run the Kenkokukai from his home after the withdrawal of several prominent members left the organization without the means to fund their headquarters. One consistent aspect of Akao's thought was his respect for the power of the United States. Akao opposed the Asia-Pacific War with the United States from a nationalist perspective on the grounds that the United States was too powerful and therefore that fighting a war with it was foolhardy. In the 1942 election, Akao ran for a seat in the National Diet as a \\"non-recommended candidate,\\" meaning he was not recommended by the single national political party, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. Nevertheless, Akao won the election and received the second most votes in Tokyo and the fourth most votes of anyone in Japan. Like other independent candidates, Akao dutifully joined the IRAA upon winning his seat. Postwar Activism Akao was defeated for reelection in 1945, and shortly thereafter was purged as a wartime leader by the US military occupation of Japan. Depurged in 1951 as part of the Reverse Course, Akao vowed to return to elected office. To this end, he established a new political party, the Greater Japan Patriotic Party (GJPP). Ideologically, the GJPP was virulently anti- communist and staunchly pro-American. As a member of this party, Akao stood for several elected positions but never won. Increasingly, he seemed less interested in winning elections and more interested in stirring up debate. His use of noise trucks and street corner speechifying was a model for later right-wing movements in Japan. During the 1960 Anpo protests against the US- Japan Security Treaty, Akao became convinced that Japan was on the verge of a communist revolution, and sought to rally right-wing groups to engage in counter-protests. Both Otoya Yamaguchi, who assassinated Inejirō Asanuma, and Kazutaka Komori, who perpetrated the Shimanaka Incident, were 17-year-old members of the GJPP who resigned from the party shortly before committing their violent attacks, leading many people to speculate that Akao had ordered both attacks. Akao was actually arrested for murder in the wake of the Shimanaka Incident, although he was eventually released for lack of evidence. Later Years Akao took to flying the American flag and the British Union Jack on his noise trucks alongside the Hinomaru, and strongly supported the revised Security Treaty and the US-Japan alliance. He also was a strong supporter of South Korea, for its anti-communism, and advocated close alliance between South Korea and Japan. In 1989, following the death of Emperor Hirohito, Akao ran for a seat in the House of Councilors for a 15th time, at the age of 90. Akao died of heart failure on February 6, 1990, at the age of 91.

Known for most of its length as Green Valley Road, the state highway runs from MD 355 near Hyattstown north to MD 31 in New Windsor. MD 75 serves as the main north-south highway of eastern Frederick County, where it connects Hyattstown with New Market, Libertytown, Johnsville, and the Carroll County town of Union Bridge. The first sections of MD 75 were constructed around New Windsor and between Green Valley and New London in the early 1910s. The latter highway was extended south to Green Valley in the late 1910s. In the early 1920s, MD 75 was constructed between New Windsor and Union Bridge and from Libertytown to Johnsville. The remainder of the state highway was constructed in the late 1920s and early 1930s. MD 75 was relocated between Union Bridge and New Windsor in the early 1960s, around its interchange with Interstate 70 (I-70) and U.S. Route 40 (US 40) in New Market in the early 1970s, and at its northern terminus in New Windsor in 2007. Route description View north at the south end of MD 75 at MD 355 near Hyattstown MD 75 begins at MD 355 (Urbana Pike) a short distance north of the Frederick-Montgomery county line near Hyattstown, heading northeast on two-lane undivided Green Valley Road. The state highway crosses Bennett Creek and Stillhouse Branch and passes through the village of Green Valley. MD 75 traverses Fahrney Branch before reaching MD 80 (Fingerboard Road), onto which MD 75 turns west for a short concurrency in the hamlet of Fountain Mills. The state highway continues north to the village of Monrovia, where the highway passes through a pair of sharp curves, crosses Bush Creek, and passes under CSX's Old Main Line Subdivision. At Baldwin Road south of New Market, MD 75 makes a right turn to remain on Green Valley Road while its old alignment continues straight to a dead end. At East Baldwin Road, the state highway heads north of a park and ride lot and makes a left turn onto a four-lane divided highway where the state highway has a diamond interchange with I-70 and US 40 (Baltimore National Pike). North of the interchange, MD 75 has an intersection with Old National Pike, which heads west into the town of New Market as MD 144. North of MD 144, MD 75 reduces to a two-lane undivided road and meets the north end of the old alignment, Old New Market Road. The state highway traverses Bens Branch in the hamlet of New London, which contains the Drummine Farm and Linganore High School on Old Annapolis Road. MD 75 crosses Linganore Creek and parallels Town Branch to the town of Libertytown. The state highway is named Walnut Street and Church Street south and north, respectively, of its intersection with MD 26 (Liberty Road). After passing through Johnsville, which is home of the historic Kitterman-Buckey Farm, MD 75 curves to the east and crosses Beaver Dam Creek. The state highway curves back to the north and traverses Haines Branch before crossing Sams Creek into Carroll County. MD 75 passes to the west of a cement factory before the highway enters the town of Union Bridge as Main Street. The state highway intersects Locust Street in the center of the Union Bridge Historic District. Locust Street heads east toward the Pipe Creek Friends Meetinghouse and the historic home Hard Lodging, and west toward the historic farm Mount Pleasant. MD 75 crosses the east-west line of the Maryland Midland Railway adjacent to Union Bridge Station, which now serves as the Western Maryland Railway Historical Society Museum that commemorates the railway's predecessor, the Western Maryland Railway. The state highway crosses Little Pipe Creek, then turns east onto Green Valley Road; Main Street continues north as a municipal highway that leads north to the historic Uniontown Academy and the village of Middleburg. MD 75 heads east past Wilson's Inheritance and the village of Linwood, which has its own historic district south of the rail line. Through Linwood, the state highway is paralleled to the north by its old alignment, MD 800 (Watson Lane). After the eastern junction with MD 800, MD 75 veers southeast and meets the southern end of MD 84 (Clear Ridge Road), which heads north toward Uniontown. The state highway crosses Little Pipe Creek again before reaching its northern terminus at MD 31 on the northern edge of the town of New Windsor. Green Valley Road continues south as eastbound MD 31, while westbound MD 31 heads west from the intersection as High Street. History MD 75 northbound south of Union Bridge A portion of MD 75 was originally the Liberty and Pipe Creek Turnpike from Libertytown to Union Bridge via Johnsville. When the Maryland State Roads Commission laid out its initial system of state roads to be improved in 1909, the highway between Fountain Mills and New London via New Market was included as one of the original state roads. By the end of 1911, the state road was completed from New Market to about south of Monrovia. The remainder of the Fountain Mills - New London road was under construction in 1911 and completed as a macadam road in 1912. The Uniontown Road from New Windsor to near the modern MD 75-MD 84 junction was paved in macadam as a state aid road in 1911. The highway was extended south as a state-aid road from Fountain Mills toward Hyattstown in two sections; the first section was completed as a macadam road by 1915. The second section, which would extend the highway to Green Valley, went under contract in 1916 but the contracted company failed after partially completing the road. The macadam road south to Green Valley was completed in 1920. The highway from the Uniontown Road north of New Windsor to Union Bridge went under construction shortly after 1921 and was completed as a concrete road by 1923; this included paving of Main Street in Union Bridge. A macadam road from Libertytown to Johnsville was also completed around 1923. The concrete road in Union Bridge was extended south across Sams Creek into Frederick County, completing the highway in Carroll County, in 1926 and 1927. The following year, of concrete was built north from New London. In 1929 and 1930, the concrete road being constructed north from New London was extended north a short distance and another concrete segment was started south from Libertytown. Another concrete road was started north from Johnstown toward Union Bridge. The three remaining gaps in modern MD 75--Hyattstown to Green Valley, midway between New London and Libertytown, and midway between Johnsville and Union Bridge--were under contract by 1930 and completed as concrete roads by 1933. MD 75's first significant relocation occurred around 1963 when the highway was relocated for several stretches between Union Bridge and New Windsor. The highway's old segments became sections of MD 800; in addition, MD 84 was extended south along part of old MD 75 to meet new MD 75 just north of New Windsor. The second major relocation occurred around New Market. The present alignment of I-70 through New Market had been constructed as a non-freeway four-lane divided highway for US 40 between 1953 and 1955. MD 75 was relocated to the east of New Market when I-70 was upgraded to a freeway through the town, which included the modern I-70-MD 75 interchange, in 1973 and 1974. This relocation resulted in the old alignment north of Main Street in New Market becoming a section of MD 874 and the present alignment south of the Interstate with its two right-angle turns. Finally, MD 75's eastern terminus was moved in New Windsor as a result of the relocation of MD 31 through the town in 2007. MD 31 originally entered town from the southwest along High Street, then turned east at Main Street. MD 31 was rerouted to follow High Street north to Green Valley Road at MD 75's present terminus, follow Green Valley Road south to Main Street at MD 75's old terminus, then turn east onto Main Street. The stretch of Main Street between its two intersections with MD 31 was designated MD 831J.

Television=AnimatedSuper Friends= The first television appearance of Green Arrow was a guest spot in an episode of the original incarnation of Super Friends. He appeared in the 1973 episode \\"Gulliver's Gigantic Goof\\" and was voiced by Norman Alden. He was referred to as a \\"staunch member of the Justice League of America\\" (JLA). =Justice League Unlimited= Green Arrow in Justice League Unlimited Green Arrow makes numerous appearances in Justice League Unlimited, voiced by Kin Shriner. He was the first new hero introduced in the revamped series in the episode \\"Initiation\\". In this version, Green Arrow is reluctant to join the League to avoid distractions from his primary goal: protecting \\"the little guy\\": he prefers to fight muggers and thieves, over supervillains and alien invaders. However, his strong left-wing political convictions (showcased by his quote \\"I'm an old lefty\\") and his sometimes irreverent advocacy are key reasons the Justice League insists on recruiting him as a prominent voice of the team. His counsel is critical in preventing the Justice League from overreacting to their apparent enemies' machinations and thus setting on a path towards becoming a version of the totalitarian Justice Lords during the Project Cadmus incident, and also from disbanding the League when they were later cleared of wrongdoing. Ironically, the disbanding speech is given by Superman, who had been the one who wanted the League not to disband after only one mission, and coined the team's name as the \\"Justice League.\\" In this version, Green Arrow is a billionaire who sold his company to exclusively devote time to his volunteering and activism. He develops a romantic relationship with Black Canary over the course of the series. He also develops a close friendship with Supergirl since they first met as he always helps her whenever she needs it and enjoys spending time with her. Speedy makes one appearance during the show in the episode \\"Patriot Act\\". While Green Arrow refers to Speedy as his \\"ex- sidekick\\", Speedy prefers the term \\"ex-partner\\". According to the TV Guide for the week of July 25–31, Shriner showed up at the recording studio dressed as Green Arrow. =The Batman= Green Arrow first appeared in the season five episode \\"Vertigo\\". This version of Green Arrow is motivated largely by a desire for revenge against Count Vertigo, a former employee who used technology stolen from his company to strand him on a desert island. He is also prominent in the series finale, \\"Lost Heroes\\", in which he reveals his frustrations at being ignored in favor of the super-powered members of the League. He was voiced by Chris Hardwick. The Green Arrow's appearance is reminiscent of his 1970s comic counterpart. =Batman: The Brave and the Bold= Green Arrow in Batman: The Brave and the Bold Green Arrow appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold voiced by James Arnold Taylor with a design that resembles his Golden and Silver Age interpretations. He is often portrayed as Batman's friendly rival. They are trapped together by Clock King in the first episode, but escape and defeat the villain. Merlin calls upon them in \\"Day of the Dark Knight!\\" to restore Camelot and bring King Arthur back to the throne; they succeed and are nearly knighted before they begin arguing, resulting in Merlin sending them back to their own time. There are also romantic rivalries as Green Arrow shows disgust at Batman's flirting with Catwoman and blames him for her escape; Green Arrow later makes efforts to gain Black Canary's affection despite her attraction to Batman. The Crime Syndicate counterpart of Green Arrow appears in episode \\"Deep Cover for Batman\\" and is named Blue Bowman. =DC Showcase: Green Arrow= DC Showcase: Green Arrow, an animated short directed by Joaquim Dos Santos, was included on the DVD for the direct-to-video animated film Superman/Batman: Apocalypse. Actor Neal McDonough voices Green Arrow. In the short, Oliver Queen is picking up Dinah Lance at the Star City Airport with the intention of proposing to her. However, he sees Merlyn entering the airport. He saves the princess of Vlatava from the League of Assassins, battling them and Merlyn through the airport. The girl confirms that her father was killed the night before and that her uncle is Count Vertigo, who Green Arrow believes hired Merlyn. Green Arrow defeats Merlyn in a duel. Vertigo then appears and nearly kills Arrow, but Black Canary uses her \\"canary cry\\" to defeat him. Arrow then proposes and Canary accepts, the short ending with their passionate kiss. =Young Justice= Artemis in Young Justice. Green Arrow appears as a member of the JLA in Young Justice, voiced by Alan Tudyk. In the pilot episode \\"Independence Day\\", Green Arrow and Speedy are late to a sidekick induction ceremony at the Hall of Justice, and Speedy mistakenly believes he will not be made an official JLA member and angrily denounces Green Arrow. Green Arrow appears again in \\"Infiltrator\\" with new sidekick Artemis, who claims to be his niece. When the villainous Light takes control of the Justice League, Green Arrow and others try to hunt and kill their apprentices. Green Arrow returns in \\"Salvage\\" to confront Red Arrow over his obsession with finding the original Speedy. When Red Arrow succeeds, Speedy is angry with Green Arrow for giving up on him. In Young Justice: Outsiders, which is set two years later, he resigns from the Justice League in a pre-planned move to interfere in metahuman trafficking as vigilantes with Batman, their proteges and other Justice League members. =Mad= Green Arrow appears in the animated sketch comedy series Mad where he tries to appeal to Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman about being called \\"Super Friends\\". =DC Nation Shorts= Green Arrow appears in one of the DC Nation Shorts on Cartoon Network voiced by Will Friedle. =Vixen= Green Arrow (voiced by Stephen Amell) appears in the animated web series Vixen, set in the shared universe called Arrowverse. =Justice League Action= Green Arrow appears in the animated series Justice League Action, voiced by Chris Diamantopoulos. =DC Super Hero Girls= Green Arrow appears in the 2019 animated series DC Super Hero Girls, voiced by Eddie Perino. In this version, he is the onstage nemesis of Zatanna and is member of the Invincibros. Live-actionSmallville= Green Arrow made his first appearance as a young Oliver Queen near the end of the episode \\"Sneeze\\" of the sixth season of the Superman series Smallville. Played by Justin Hartley, Lois Lane was his love interest during his appearances in season six. In Smallville, Oliver is more of an anti-hero, committing criminal acts in order to reach his goals (most notably blowing up Lex Luthor's medical transport) under the belief that the ends justify the means. Due to the Batman embargo that Warner Bros. laid down to protect Christopher Nolan's Batman movie franchise, Smallvilles version of Green Arrow seems to be a combination of Oliver Queen and Bruce Wayne. After a rough start, he becomes a trusted ally and friend of Clark Kent. Green Arrow retains his many unique arrows and demonstrates expert archery skill, along with the skilled use of a crossbow. In Smallville, Oliver was given a modern costume that had equipment designed by his company. Green Arrow also makes extensive use of an adapted PSE Archery compound bow, shot using fingers, rather than an archery tab or release aid, although his gauntlets serve as both a shooting glove and an armguard. He returned in season seven for the episode \\"Siren\\", in which he continues his fight against LuthorCorp and meets another superhero, Black Canary, whom he recruits for his Justice League. In a flashback sequence in the season seven episode \\"Veritas\\", a young version of Oliver Queen can be seen being played by Luke Gair. He returned as a regular in season eight, where flashback sequences to his desert island origin story were shown. After learning that Lionel Luthor murdered his parents he abandoned his heroic persona and only rethought his role as Green Arrow when helping Clark keep his identity secret. His battle with Lex Luthor concluded in \\"Requiem\\" when he became a majority shareholder of LuthorCorp, which effectively became a subsidiary of Queen Industries. However, a bomb goes off in a plot by Lex, and Oliver uses another bomb to murder Lex. In the season finale Oliver and the Justice League capture Bloome who Chloe separates from his Doomsday persona; Doomsday escapes, killing Jimmy Olsen and injuring the others. Clark defeats Doomsday by burying him a mile underground, and the group leave Metropolis while feeling responsible for Olsen's death. In season nine Oliver's life begins to fall apart and following an argument with Clark he burns his Green Arrow costume. He reaches his lowest point in \\"Echo\\", when Queen Industries is on the edge of bankruptcy. Tess Mercer gets Oliver to raise shareholder confidence, but Oliver remained depressed enough to attempt suicide with a fake bomb left by an adversary. After talking with Clark, Oliver becomes fearful of following the same path as Lex. Roulette helps Chloe and the Justice League set up a ruse to help convince Oliver that he is a hero, and he agrees to become the Green Arrow again to help protect Metropolis. In the following episode he offers to help train Mia Dearden. With his secret about to be revealed in the episode \\"Supergirl\\", Oliver announced to the press that he was Green Arrow and became the public face of superheroes to mitigate the public backlash being created by the Darkness. Oliver is briefly corrupted by Darkseid but resists his influence long enough for Clark to cure him. Later, he marries Chloe Sullivan and in the series finale it is suggested that they later had a child together. The eighth issue of the show's comic book continuation Smallville Season Eleven written by executive story editor Bryan Q. Miller, confirms that the child is Oliver's son as Chloe announces her pregnancy to him.Smallville Season 11 vol. 1 #8 (December 2012) He and Chloe later named their newborn son \\"Jonathan\\" after Clark's late-adoptive father.Smallville Season Eleven: Continuity vol. 1 #4 (March 2015) There are references from other characters that Oliver occasionally flirted with Black Canary.

The series, Arrow, offers a fresh take on the character, and initially does not feature superpowers, as a way to take a realistic look at the characters in this universe. In addition to the character's experiences as the hero Green Arrow, the series also features flashbacks to Oliver's time on the island and the events that shaped him into the hero in the present. Stephen Amell portrays Oliver Queen in the series. It premiered in North America on October 10, 2012, and has aired six seasons. On April 2, 2018, The CW renewed the series for a seventh season.

Goyer and Justin Marks penned a script for a film starring Green Arrow originally called Super Max. On June 5, 2008, the film was retitled Green Arrow: Escape from Super Max. The reported storyline stated that the hero, who was framed for a crime he did not commit, must escape a high-security prison filled with A-, B-, and C-list villains and rogue superheroes. In an interview with MTV in 2008, Marks said: > It's a very, very awesome prison. I majored in architecture in college, and > design is how I actually started in. For Super Max, designing that prison, > it had to be the kind of thing that was a character in and of itself. We're > in a world where instead of just trying to contain a guy who's really big, > you're trying to contain a guy who canin the case of Iciclewho can freeze > things. What kind of a cell would a guy like that need in order to have his > powers neutralized? So to escape from Super Max they have got to go through > the most elaborate heist we've ever seen, involving superpowers. Because the > prison itself kind of has superpowers! Marks added that Black Canary would not be making an appearance in the film, and that it would include cameos from the Riddler, Lex Luthor, and the Joker. Elements of the script were adapted for the seventh season of Arrow, where Oliver Queen is locked in the Slabside Maximum Security Prison after being outed as the Green Arrow. =DC Extended Universe= Stephen Amell, who portrays the character on Arrow, stated in July 2013 that he was interested in portraying the character in the Justice League film.ARROW’S STEPHEN AMELL IS UP FOR JUSTICE LEAGUE MOVIE However, DC has consistently denied any continuity between the cinematic universe and the TV universe, which began with Arrow.

If the character is wearing the downloadable Arrow skin, he is voiced by Stephen Amell from the live-action series. In Injustice: Gods Among Us, Green Arrow is one of the Justice League members taken from the primary universe into an alternate world where Superman and his Regime rule over the planet. They are recruited by that world's Batman into the fight against the tyrannical Superman, whom Oliver discovers has killed his counterpart in this universe. In his playable chapter, Oliver assists Batman and the League in infiltrating the Batcave to retrieve a chunk of kryptonite by defeating the Regime versions Solomon Grundy, Killer Frost, Wonder Woman, and Black Adam. He later helps this world's Batman in rescuing the primary Batman from Stryker's Island, but is forced to battle the alternate Batman when he becomes possessed by Raven. Later, he fights the Regime Flash when the latter finds the Insurgency base to switch sides. After the Insurgency defeats the Regime with the assistance of the primary Superman, he wishes the Regime Flash the best of luck. In his single-player ending, Oliver visits the alternate Star City and finds an arrow-shaped memorial in the deceased Green Arrow's honor. He also mentors this universe's Roy Harper into becoming the city's new protector, Red Arrow. The Green Arrow in Injustice 2 is from an alternate universe Doctor Fate took Black Canary to after she was defeated by Superman and near death. Just as Dinah lost her Oliver, this Oliver lost his version of Dinah, so Fate left her and her son Connor in this world for the two to find happiness. Five years later, they received news from Doctor Fate of Superman's defeat at the hands of his prime- Earth counterpart. When Dinah is brought home by Doctor Fate to help Batman in restoring Earth, the alternate Oliver joins in to honor his late-counterpart. In the story mode, the couple are sent with Harley Quinn to battle Gorilla Grodd's Society. During their time in Gorilla City, Fate warns them of a bigger threat coming to Earth and offers to take them back to Oliver's home world, but they refuse and defeat him in a fight. After the two defeat Gorilla Grodd, they are abducted by the threat Fate was talking about: Brainiac. They are later brainwashed by Grodd into battling Black Adam and Aquaman in Kahndaq, but are freed after Aquaman kills the Gorilla tyrant. In his single- player ending, Oliver returns to his universe to warn his planet about Brainiac, but arrives in the middle of Brainiac's assault. However, Brainiac was defeated by a multiverse Justice League consisting of variations of Earth-23 Superman, Red Son Batman, and Flashpoint Wonder Woman. He joins them as they go to other universes to combat the multiple versions of Brainiac.

World War II service  Departing Boston, Massachusetts, on 14 July, Blue Jay arrived at the Mine Warfare School, Yorktown, Virginia, on the 18th for three weeks training. Departing Yorktown on 2 August, the minesweeper reached the Philadelphia Navy Yard the following day. Following upkeep, she and three other coastal minesweepers proceeded to the naval base at Cape May, New Jersey, on 16 August to operate as the minesweeping detachment of the 4th Naval District's local defense forces.

With her reclassification, her name and coastal minesweeper designator were cancelled on 20 November 1943; and she became simply YDT-6. Converted for her new work at the Boston Navy Yard--the alterations completed by 22 May 1944--she proceeded to Quonset Point, Rhode Island, the same day and operated out of the naval air station there as a torpedo retriever and diving tender.  Placed out of service  Placed out of service on 15 April 1946, YDT-6 was struck from the Navy list on 8 May 1946 and turned over to the Maritime Commission for disposal.

As a player, he made 121 appearances between 1912 and 1930, having earlier played in the Minor Counties Championship for Staffordshire. The great majority of his first-class matches were for Worcestershire, though he also played in India for the Europeans and, once, a joint \\"Europeans and Parsees\\" side. He umpired four first-class games, including one Test match. Higgins was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham, where he was in the cricket XI. Obituary. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 1971. In his teens and early twenties, Higgins played football as an inside left. He appeared once in the Football League First Division for Birmingham in the 1907–08 season, and was also on the books of Aston Villa and Brierley Hill Alliance, retaining his amateur status throughout his football career. He made his first-class cricket debut for Worcestershire against Leicestershire at Amblecote in 1912. Only one day's play was possible in the match, during which Higgins scored 5 and bowled five wicketless overs for 34. It was to be eight years before he played first-class cricket again. His next game for Worcestershire came against Yorkshire at Worcester in 1920, on which occasion he again had an unproductive match: he scored 1 and 0, and took no wickets in 16 overs. Higgins finally claimed his first wicket — Kent opener Wally Hardinge, caught and bowled — in his fifth first-class game, at Tonbridge a few days later, and he ended the season with unattractive figures of 85 runs at 7.72 and four wickets at 88.25. Higgins played not at all in 1921, but in 1922 he had a considerably more successful time of it, scoring 605 runs at 16.35 – albeit with only one fifty – and taking 14 wickets, his highest season's aggregate, at 44.07. This year also saw him claim his only five-wicket haul, 5–72 against Gloucestershire at Gloucester, restricting the home team to 202 in their first innings. His performance was to no avail, however: Worcestershire were bowled out for 58 and 52, Mills and Parker bowling unchanged throughout the match, and lost by an innings. Higgins was in India during the 1922–23 English winter, playing four first-class games including two for Europeans in the Lahore Tournament. He was to make further Indian appearances, five of them in the Bombay Quadrangular, in 1923–24, 1924–25 and 1928–29, though he hit only one fifty (56 for Europeans against Parsees in 1923–24) and took just two wickets in his entire career of ten matches in that country. Meanwhile, Higgins' English career was barely noticeable: he played twice in each of the 1924 and 1925 seasons, and not at all in 1926. The next three years, however, were to prove by some margin his most successful in the game. He played 19 or 20 matches for Worcestershire every summer, and hit one century in each, the highest of these being the first: 123 against Glamorgan at Kidderminster in July 1927. He scored those runs from number three in the order, but his other two centuries were both made as an opener. In 1928 he reached 1,000 first-class runs in a season for the only time, hitting 1,041 at an average of 30.61. Higgins played three final matches for Worcestershire in 1930, without conspicuous success. By this time he had already umpired two first-class games in India in 1926–27, and in 1933–34 he stood in two more, including the third Test between India and England at Madras. He died in England, in a nursing home in Malvern, aged 84. His younger brother Harry played nearly 100 times for Worcestershire in the 1920s.

This method of navigating through canal tunnels and adits was commonly used in canal tunnels during the 18th and early 19th centuries. Legging in canal tunnels Early canal tunnels were built without a towpath as this would require a much larger bore, and hence cost more to build. Prior to the introduction of motorised boats, legging was one of the few options for getting a boat through such a tunnel. Two people were required. They would lie on a plank across the bows of the boat, and holding the plank with their hands, would propel the boat with their feet against the tunnel wall. This was quite a dangerous activity and resulted in many deaths.Rolt, L.T.C.: \\"Navigable Waterways\\", Arrow Books, 1969,1973 In later years 'wing' boards were hooked on to the boat to make the operation safer. At Crimson Hill tunnel, alternate stones in the walls were recessed to provide better tread for the leggers.Gladwin & White: \\"English Canals Part II\\", Oakwood Press While the boat was being legged through the tunnel, the horse would be led over the hill. On short tunnels the legging was done by the boat owner and crew. At long tunnels, professional leggers were available, such as at Blisworth Tunnel and Dudley Tunnel. At the 3 mile long Standedge Tunnel expert leggers could get an empty boat through in 1 hour 20 minutes, taking 3 hours with a full load, for which they were paid 1s 6d.Marsden History Group website At Blisworth the boatmen were often terrorised into employing leggers, so in 1827 the leggers were registered and issued with brass armlets for identification.Faulkner, Alan (1972). \\"The Grand Junction Canal\\", Newton Abbot: David & Charles, At Standedge Tunnel, the use of official leggers eventually became a requirement for passage. At Morwellham, boatmen were said to have pushed against the tunnel roof. This tunnel has a considerable flow of water through it, and progress was very slow in one direction.Hedges, Carolyn. \\"The Tavistock Canal\\", Dartington Amenity Research Trust, 1975 Berwick Tunnel on the Shrewsbury Canal, opened in 1797 was the first tunnel to be built with a towpath, negating the need for legging. Legging was also the main form of propulsion used in the man-made adits in Speedwell Cavern until the boats were given electric motors. Sometimes the guide will switch off the boat's engine and leg along the roof of the cave to demonstrate how the boats used to be worked by miners. They got paid £11.05 in today's money.

These pensions are \\"frozen\\" until retirement age. This does not mean that the pension is fixed in money terms. In money purchase schemes, the benefit will continue to grow in line with underlying investments. In defined benefit schemes, the pension will increase in face value based on whatever uprating factor the scheme uses for preserved pensions. Normally, this should be the same as is applied to accruing pensions of current members. Frequently, if the amounts are small, the member and the scheme administrators lose touch with each other, and as a result the pension is never claimed. Many financial services advisors and companies offer to collect frozen pensions so as to amalgamate them and bring them under one paying agency.

Route description SR 761 begins at a T-intersection with SR 313 in northeastern Noble County's Wayne Township, where SR 313 forms the western and southern legs of the intersection. For its duration, SR 761 traverses hilly terrain that is composed of both forest and grassland. Heading northeastward from its southern terminus, the state highway passes T-intersections with Noble County Road 33 and Eagon Hill Road, then bends to the north as it crosses the county line into Guernsey County's Millwood Township. Turning to the northeast, SR 761 now curves its way through a heavily wooded stretch through the Sycamore Road intersection, then runs northerly briefly to where it meets New Gottengen Road. SR 761 runs northeasterly from there into Salesville, where it comes to an end at its junction with SR 265, an intersection where SR 265 forms the northern and eastern approaches.

Dual enrollment Honesdale High School offers a dual enrollment program. This state program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits.

The state offered a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. Students are responsible for their own transportation. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. For the 2009-10 funding year, Wayne Highlands School District received a state grant of $10,742 for the program. In 2010, Governor Edward Rendell eliminated the grants to students, from the Commonwealth, due to a state budget crisis.

On September 17, 2007, Kerry addressed a Constitution Day forum at the University of Florida campus in Gainesville, which was organized by the ACCENT Speakers Bureau, an agency of the university's student government. Andrew Meyer, a 21-year-old fourth-year undergraduate mass communication student, had initially been allowed to ask a question after the close of the question period. He asked Kerry whether he was a member of Skull and Bones society. Meyer was forcibly pulled away from the microphone. He was immediately restrained and forcibly removed and was subsequently arrested by university police. During his arrest, Meyer struggled and screamed for help. While six officers held Meyer down, one of the officers drive-stunned him with a taser following Meyer's shouted plea to the police, \\"Don't tase me, bro!\\" Several videos of the episode were posted on the Web, with one version reaching 7 million views on YouTube. The New Oxford American Dictionary listed tase or taze as one of the words of the year for 2007, popularized by the widespread use of the phrase. Meyer registered the phrase as a trademark in September 2007.  Details = Student  Andrew Meyer was, at the time of the incident, an undergraduate student at the University of Florida. Born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, he attended Cypress Bay High School in Weston, Florida, where he worked at the school newspaper, The Circuit, and was a member of the National Honor Society. At the University of Florida, Meyer worked as a columnist for the college paper Independent Florida Alligator. Meyer has stated that he writes \\"mostly whimsical nonsense columns about nothing in particular, yet occasionally finds [himself] angry enough to rain down fire and brimstone on an unsuspecting politician or celebrity.\\" He received international publicity when videos were posted of police tasering him at the town hall forum featuring Senator Kerry. The Miami Herald stated that \\"Meyer's grandmother, Lucy Meyer of Pembroke Pines, Florida, told The Miami Herald that he is a hardworking student with no prior run-ins with the law.\\" She also said \\"He gets very, very overcome with passion for whatever he is feeling. Maybe the passion took over.\\" Today interviewed Meyer a month after the incident, once he had negotiated probation. As of April 2011, Meyer attends the Florida International University College of Law. Meyer registered \\"Don't tase me, bro\\" as a trademark in September 2007 and uses the publicity to sell T-shirts on his website. As of July 15, 2016, the phrase is no longer trademarked. Meyer wrote a book titled Don't Tase Me Bro! Real Questions, Fake News, and My Life As A Meme, which he published on Amazon in December 2018. As of 2019, Meyer is very active on Twitter, in which he comments frequently on U.S. Politics, and regularly expresses support for conservative ideals and right-wing nationalism.https://twitter.com/TheAndrewMeyer  Incident prior to start of video  University of Florida police attempt to force Andrew Meyer out of the auditorium. According to reports, Meyer was in line for access to the microphone, when former Ambassador Dennis Jett, a University of Florida political science instructor and the forum's moderator, announced that one more question would be taken from the microphone on the right as seen from the stage. Meyer grabbed a second microphone which had been shut off, and demanded he be allowed to ask a question, asking, \\"Why don't you answer my questions? I have been waiting and listening to you speak in circles for the last two hours.\\" He also stated, \\"These officers are going to arrest me,\\" and \\"You will take my question because I have been listening to your crap for two hours.\\" When an officer attempted to cut Meyer off and escort him out of the hall, Meyer broke away and continued to shout. Kerry then intervened and requested that Meyer be allowed to ask a question. Meyer was then brought back to the microphone with police officers on either side of him. Meyer then handed his camera to the woman who was standing in front of him in line and requested that she record him. Kerry then finished answering a previous question, and Meyer was then recognized by Kerry to ask a question.  Video begins  At this point, Meyer's video began. Meyer spoke for approximately 1 minute and 20 seconds, beginning by citing the book Armed Madhouse and its author Greg Palast's description of the 2004 U.S. presidential election and reports of election irregularities. According to The Washington Post, Meyer's question turned into \\"an increasingly agitated three-parter.\\" Meyer questioned Kerry's concession of the 2004 U.S. presidential election, Kerry's support or lack of support of the efforts to impeach George W. Bush, and Kerry's involvement in the Yale University secret society known as Skull and Bones. After Meyer used the term \\"blowjob\\" (in reference to the impeachment of Bill Clinton) and while he was asking about Kerry's involvement in Skull and Bones, Meyer's microphone was cut off. Later, Steven Blank, ACCENT chairman, said, \\"We make it clear that any profanity and vulgarity by anyone asking questions will result in a cutting off of the mic.\\"\\"Meyer incident won't affect Accent security policy, chairman says\\" By DEVIN CULCLASURE, Alligator Writer.

Steven Blank, ACCENT chairman, later said \\"They [the police] acted independently of ACCENT.\\" Some members of the crowd began to cheer and applaud. Physical contact by the police occurred right after Meyer remarked, \\"Thank you for cutting my mic!\\" Kerry responded to the police action, \\"That's all right, let me answer his question\\", but two police officers continued to hold Meyer and attempted to forcibly move him towards the exit. Meyer repeatedly asked why he was being arrested. He struggled for several seconds shouting, \\"Get off me! What are you doing? What is going on?\\" while a third police officer kept a Taser aimed at him. Meyer managed to get back towards the stage and stated, \\"I want to stand and listen to the answers to my questions!\\" A fourth officer joined in, and single-handedly managed to remove Meyer to the back of the auditorium while being escorted by the three other officers. Meyer was carried part of the way by officer King, holding Greg Palast's book up in the air with his one free arm and shouting, \\"Why are you arresting me? Help! Help!\\" Close to the exit, Meyer broke free for a short moment and then was wrestled to the ground. Two more officers joined in and Meyer was now held down by four officers on the body and two on the legs. The officers managed to handcuff only one hand. As Meyer requested to be allowed to leave of his own accord, they informed him that he no longer had a say in the matter and threatened several times to taser him if he did not comply. Meyer asked again to leave, and he yelled \\"Don't tase me, bro! Don't tase me!\\" but was drive stunned (referred to in the police report as a \\"contact tase\\") in the shoulder by an officer with a department-issued X-26 Taser when he failed to comply. Meyer continued screaming for help as the officers removed him from the room. During the altercation, Kerry urged everyone to calm down, joked that \\"Unfortunately, he [Andrew Meyer] is not available to come up here and swear me in as President\\" and continued his response to Meyer's question, which he referred to as \\"very important\\". Senator Kerry later released a statement saying that he was unaware that any Tasing had occurred until afterwards. Meyer was then escorted off the premises and detained overnight in the Alachua County Jail. A large gathering of students protested outside the jail that evening.  Legal action  After the incident, Meyer was arrested for inciting a riot and charged with resisting an officer and disturbing the peace and taken to Alachua County Jail. Meyer spent one night in the jail and was released the following morning. Police recommended charges of resisting arrest with violence, a felony, and disturbing the peace and interfering with school administrative functions, a misdemeanor. Meyer's attorney, Robert S. Griscti, stated he would seek to have the charges dismissed. Meyer later issued a public apology for his \\"failure to act calmly\\", stating that he \\"stepped out of line\\". He initially insisted there was no reason for his arrest and demanded an apology from the Alachua County Police Department, although he sent written letters of apology to the University Police Department, as well as UF President Machen and the Gator Community. The state attorney agreed to drop prosecution of Meyer's case in return for Meyer serving a voluntary 18-month probation. If Meyer got into legal trouble during the probationary period, he was to be charged for the September 17 incident with resisting officers without violence and interfering with a school function. According to the University of Florida, Meyer also accepted sanctions from the University for violations of the Student Code of Conduct. The sanctions were not made public because of student privacy laws. He returned as a student in the spring semester of 2008.  Issues raised = Allegations of excessive force  CNN.com stated that student opinions on the University of Florida campus were evenly divided as to whether the officers acted properly. About 300 students marched to the steps of campus police headquarters the following day with another 100 marching to Emerson Alumni Hall. They chanted that police used excessive force and waved signs that read \\"Stop police brutality\\", \\"Taze Pigs\\", \\"Freedom of Speech not a Felony\\", \\"Tasers Kill\\", and Meyer's words, \\"Don't Tase me, bro.\\" They demanded that Tasers be banned from campus and that charges be filed against the police officers who restrained and tased Meyer. Four weeks after the incident the university sponsored a panel to discuss appropriate police practices. Fifteen people attended and one signed up to make comments.\\"Policy panel draws 15 attendees\\".  Free speech issues  Some critics of the actions of the police have suggested that it was not Meyer's actions which led to his removal, but the content of his remarks. For example, writer Palast said, \\"When you bring up uncomfortable stuff, it's going to create discomfort. Obviously, if he was speaking about baseball scores—if he maybe had a different political viewpoint that wasn't seen as combative or outside of what's permissible—then the cops' backs wouldn't have been up.\\"Taser sparks debate Gainesville sun The American Civil Liberties Union's Florida chapter released a statement on September 18, 2007 expressing dismay over the incident.  Reactions to incident  News articles about the incident have reported that Meyer had posted on his website's numerous comedy videos. It has also been pointed out that Meyer made arrangements to have himself filmed and have speculated that the incident may have been a stunt by Meyer. The reported behavior of Meyer when no cameras were present is also cited as evidence that the incident was a prank. The police report claimed that \\"as [Meyer] was escorted down stairs with no cameras in sight, he remained quiet, but once the cameras made their way down stairs he started screaming and yelling again.\\" Additionally, the report asserts that Meyer was \\"laughing and being lighthearted in the car, his demeanor completely changed once the cameras were not in sight.\\" The police officers have claimed that during the ride, Meyer said: \\"I am not mad at you guys, you didn't do anything wrong, you were just trying to do your job.\\" John Levy, a graduate student at the university and a friend of Meyer's since the second grade, has said that he spoke with Meyer shortly before Meyer entered the Kerry forum. He said that Meyer felt excited, had come up with several questions, and wanted to hear the senator's responses. Levy also said that Meyer was \\"really upset that people are more concerned with the police attack and not with the dialogue he was trying to start with Kerry\\" and that \\"What kind of message does that send? He wants to show students it's okay to ask hard questions, and then he gets tased for doing it.\\" In the 2008 film Free For All, filmmaker John Ennis and Greg Palast (the author of the book Meyer was holding during the event) strongly echo this sentiment. When \\"asked about speculation that Meyer staged the confrontation\\", University spokesman Steve Orlando has stated that a member of the Office of Student Affairs told Orlando that Meyer brought a video camera to the forum and gave it to Clarissa Jessup, the young woman who was next in line to ask a question,'Washington Postarticle Sept 24 \\"Got a Camera by Howard Kurtz with whom he was unacquainted, before he spoke. Henry Perlstein, a university senior who has known Meyer since high school, said, \\"My first impression was that [the video] was a home movie he made for his friends because it was so surreal. Then I heard the screams and he sounded genuinely afraid.\\" Amos Eshel, a fellow UF student who has known Meyer since middle school and who attended his arraignment in September 2007, later told reporters that Meyer does \\"like to speak his mind\\" but that Meyer is not the type of person who would attempt to start trouble.  University investigation  On September 18, in Emerson Alumni Hall, University of Florida President, J. Bernard Machen held a press conference about the incident. He also issued a letter in which he stated that the University Police Chief Linda Stump had requested that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) investigate the arrest. President Machen stated that \\"We plan to assemble a panel of faculty and students to review our police protocols, our management practices and the FDLE report to come up with a series of recommendations for the university.\\" The State Attorney's Office will review the charges as well. The Miami Herald has stated that, at the press conference, President Machen called the situation \\"regretful for us\\" and announced that two officers involved in the incident had been placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the probe. University spokesman Steve Orlando said Meyer was asked to leave the microphone after his allotted time was up. However, a transcript of the event shows that this is untrue; he was not told to leave at any point. The university president \\"would not say whether he thought the latest episode was a prank.\\" On October 24, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement released a report on its investigation of the incident. The report concluded that Meyer may have planned a 'disruption' of the forum. It also cleared the police officers involved of any wrongdoing in subduing Meyer, saying that the officer's actions were justified. University President Bernie Machen stated that \\"I have full confidence in the police department\\" and that the two officers previously placed on paid administrative leave have been fully reinstated.  Response from Senator Kerry  On the day following the incident, Kerry's office issued a statement:  Popular culture  The most viewed video of the taser incident, shot by Kyle Mitchell of The Gainesville Sun, has more than 7 million views on YouTube as of January 2015. The \\"Don't tase me bro!\\" quote has become a catchphrase and Internet meme, spawning various parodies of the incident. The New Oxford American Dictionary listed \\"tase/taze\\" as one of the words of the year for 2007. The Yale Book of Quotations designated Meyer's exclamation as the most memorable quote of 2007.

Life Michael O'Shaughnessy was born 28 May 1864 in Loughill County Limerick, Ireland. His father Patrick O'Shaughnessy and mother Margaret O'Donnell were farmers. O'Shaughnessy attended school in Limerick and County Tipperary and studied at University College in Cork and University College, Galway, graduating from the Royal University of Ireland in 1884 in Engineering. Michael had a brother Edward who also immigrated to Minnesota, USA and changed his name, dropping \\"O\\" and marrying Lucy Ann (Foster), and a sister Eileen who immigrated to Australia and married Charles Edward Andrews. On 21 October 1890 he married Mary Spottiswood and had five children. Career He emigrated to the U.S. in 1885, sailing from London then traveling to San Francisco overland by train, arriving on 30 March 1885. He first worked as an assistant engineer for the Sierra Valley and Mohawk Railroad. In 1886, he found employment with the Southern Pacific Railroad as a surveyor and worked on layout for the towns of Mill Valley and Sausalito, California. In 1889 he opened an engineering office in the city of San Francisco. He was appointed chief engineer for the California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894 in Golden Gate Park in 1890. Later, in 1895, he was awarded a commission by the Mountain Copper Company to design a narrow- gauge railroad, and he began working for the Spring Valley Water Company, a private concern that controlled streams and springs on the San Francisco peninsula, later purchased by the city to become the San Francisco Water Department. O'Shaughnessy oversaw construction of several major water supply projects in the Hawaiian Islands beginning in 1889. These included aqueducts at Olokele, Koolau, Keanaiemaui, and Kohala for sugar plantations. Upon return to California in 1906 he worked on the Morena Dam project outside San Diego and the Merced River Dam for the Crocker Land and Development Company. He also designed and supervised the construction of a water supply system for the city of Port Costa. San Francisco Mayor James Rolph chose him as chief engineer for the city in September, 1912, convincing him to accept a salary less than half that of his private practice. O'Shaughnessy was uncertain that he wanted the job because in the past, the city had not always paid him for work done. His wife, a native of San Francisco, convinced him to accept. O'Shaughnessy issued dozens of reports during his years in office, nearly all descriptions of engineering projects intended to educate city officials and the general populace. He once complained that he had to run \\"an engineering school, where, as fast as he could teach the Supervisors what it was all about, the public turned them out and sent him new pupils.\\" In this position O'Shaughnessy supervised the construction of the Twin Peaks Reservoir, the Stockton Street Tunnel, the Twin Peaks Tunnel, the Municipal Railway System and service to the Panama-Pacific International Exposition (1915) along with streets, a high- pressure fire system and new sewers. San Francisco's streetcar system, of which the J, K, L, M, and N lines survive today, was pushed to completion by O'Shaughnessy between 1915 and 1927, but city voters defeated the bond issue he backed in 1927. Hetch Hetchy O'Shaughnessy's largest and most controversial project was the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir and power project (Lake Eleanor Dam and O'Shaughnessy Dam). While San Francisco rebuilt after the earthquake and fire of 1906 its current water supply was inadequate to meet future growth. Hetch Hetchy began with a dam in the Yosemite and was linked to more than of tunnels, pumping stations and pipelines to San Francisco. The project involved building not just a dam, but also a -long railroad, several smaller dams, an aqueduct long that included of tunnels, some through solid granite, hydroelectric generating plants and transmission lines. That the dam was planned for a valley in Yosemite National Park caused significant opposition. One of the most potent opponents was the Sierra Club and its founding President, John Muir. After two vetoes by Teddy Roosevelt, on 19 December 1913, Woodrow Wilson signed the Raker Act. Construction began in 1914. Water from the dam, named for O'Shaughnessy, crosses the foothills, the San Joaquin Valley, the coast ranges and San Francisco Bay through the Pulgas Water Temple and is stored in the Crystal Springs Reservoir. O'Shaughnessy lost control of the project in 1932 when the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission was formed. Edward Cahill was appointed to head the new commission and O'Shaughnessy's deputy, Lloyd McAfee, was appointed manager and Chief Engineer for the Hetch Hetchy project. O'Shaughnessy died of a heart attack on 12 October 1934, sixteen days before Yosemite's water was delivered to San Francisco's reservoirs. O'Shaughnessy Boulevard in San Francisco is named for him.

The estate is located in the western Chicago suburb of Oak Brook, Illinois, United States, and is now part of the Mayslake Forest Preserve administered by the Forest Preserve District of DuPage County. Originally encompassing an area of over 848 acres (3.4 km²), the estate now contains a total area of 87 acres (0.4 km²). The entire complex features the Tudor Revival style Mayslake Hall, its retreat wing, and the Portiuncula Chapel, a replica of the Chapel of St. Francis in Assisi, Italy. Approximately 22 acres (0.1 km²) of wetlands, lakes, restored prairies and two small oak savannas are included within the 87 acre (0.4 km²) territory. On November 8, 1994, Mayslake Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History=Construction and early ownership The Mayslake Peabody Estate was constructed from 1919-1921 for wealthy coal baron and Democratic politician Francis Stuyvesant Peabody. At the time of the estate's construction, Peabody was the owner of one of the largest coal companies in the United States, the Peabody Coal Company, which has since become Peabody Energy, the largest private sector coal company in the world. Peabody first began purchasing land in the eastern portion of DuPage County in 1910. He used the land to create Peabody Farms, later renamed Mayslake Farms. By 1919 Peabody had approximately of land for use between parcels he owned and leased. Construction of Mayslake Hall, his Tudor Revival style country house began in 1919. The estate is named in honor of his first wife, who died in 1907, and his daughter, both of whom were named May. Only a year after Mayslake Hall was completed, on August 27, 1922, Francis Peabody died of a heart attack during a fox hunt on his property. Peabody was 63 years old at the time of his death. Later ownership and additions The Portiuncula Chapel, constructed in 1926, is a replica of the Chapel of St. Francis of Assisi in Assisi, Italy. After Francis Peabody's death, his family did not wish to reside at the estate, and on March 28, 1924, the estate was sold to the Franciscan Order for a total of $450,000. Beginning in 1925, the Franciscans used Mayslake Hall as a retreat house. After Peabody's death, the Portiuncula Chapel, a replica of the Chapel of St. Francis of Assisi in Assisi, Italy, was added to the property in memory of him. Completed in 1926, the chapel was one of the first replicas of the original chapel in the United States. The Portiuncula Chapel at the Franciscan Monastery of the Holy Land in America in Washington, D.C. was also built around the same time. Originally, the chapel was located at the site of Peabody's death. It was moved to its present location near the mansion in 1973. Behind the chapel, a semi-circular memorial wall surrounding a flower and herb garden, was constructed by the Franciscan Order of Friars Minor. In 1927, the St. Joseph Seminary was added to the complex, but was later demolished. In 1951, an additional wing was added to the country house (now known as the retreat wing). St. Paschal's Friary was built on the estate between 1952 and 1964. The Friary was demolished in 2011. During the 1930s and 1970s, the Franciscans sold large portions of the estate. In 1991, the Franciscans announced the pending sale of the remaining to a developer who planned to raze remaining buildings and build 130 luxury homes. Conservationists, historic preservationists and DuPage County citizens formed a group to save the historic property. With the assistance of the group's efforts, DuPage County voters approved a $17.5 million referendum providing the Forest Preserve District with funds to purchase Mayslake in 1992. The area is now part of the Forest Preserve District of DuPage County. Mayslake Hall hosts cultural and educational programs throughout the year, including lectures, art classes, and concerts. Restoration-In-Progress tours of the hall take place on Saturdays and Wednesdays. The estate is also home to First Folio Theatre. The Mayslake Peabody Estate has been used as a film location for several television and movie projects. It was used as the main location for the independent feature film, \\"Eye of the Sandman,\\" produced by a Chicago-based non-profit organization, Split Pillow in November 2007. Architecture A hand-carved staircase of walnut leads guests onto the second floor. Architectural damage can be seen on the walls. Mayslake Hall was designed in the Tudor Revival style by Benjamin Marshall of Marshall & Fox, an architectural firm based in Chicago. The country house somewhat resembles Compton Wynyates, a 15th-century manor house in Warwickshire, England. The building's architectural elements include decorative half-timbering and groups of tall, narrow windows. Mayslake Hall features a library, kitchen, private study, numerous bedrooms and bathrooms, servant's quarters, and other rooms. Francis Peabody's private study contains a secret staircase leading to a basement. During years of disrepair, the building suffered significant architectural and structural damage, but is being remediated by a restoration process within Mayslake Hall. The restoration is ongoing and is featured during tours of Mayslake Hall. The service complex was designed by Howard Van Doren Shaw including servants' quarters, horse stables, garages, workshops, and a greenhouse, but these service buildings have since been razed.

Patton in 1913. Patton suggested the revision from a curved sword and edge and cutting technique to a thrusting style of attack, following his extensive training in France. It had a large, basket-shaped hilt mounting a straight, double-edged, thrusting blade designed for use by light cavalry. Although officially designated a saber, it lacks the curved edge typical of many models of saber. This weapon, the last sword issued to U.S. cavalry, was never used as intended. At the beginning of U.S. involvement in World War I, several American cavalry units armed with sabers were sent to the front, but they were held back. The character of war had changed, making horse-mounted troops easy prey for enemy troops equipped with Gewehr 98 rifles and MG08 machine guns. Cavalrymen who saw combat did so dismounted, using their horses only to travel, similar to mounted infantry. History The saber is traditionally the weapon of the U.S. Cavalry; the 1913 Cavalry saber design replaced the Model 1906 Light Cavalry Saber (\\"Ames\\" saber), which itself was little changed from the Model 1860 Light Cavalry Saber.Arthur Wyllie, American Swords, (2014) , 9781304811967 Patton designed the saber when he was Master of the Sword at the Mounted Service School; unlike earlier revisions of cavalry sabers, however, the 1913 saber was a complete redesign. Following the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm, Patton traveled with his family to Dresden, Berlin, and Nuremberg. Seeking the greatest swordsman in Europe to study with, Patton was told the \\"beau sabreur\\" of the French Army would be the one. Adjutant M. Cléry was a French \\"master of arms\\" and instructor of fencing at the Cavalry School at Saumur. Patton went to Saumur to undergo an intense study with the master. Upon his return, Patton wrote a report on his sword studies that was revised for the Army and Navy Journal. Patton's first article for the well-known Cavalry Journal appeared in the March 1913 issue. In the summer of 1913, following his advising the Ordnance Department on sword redesign, Patton was allowed to return to Saumur to study once again under Cléry. Patton was next assigned to the Mounted Service School at Fort Riley, Kansas, as a student and \\"Master of the Sword\\", the top instructor in a new course in swordsmanship. It was here he wrote two training manuals in mounted and unmounted swordsmanship, \\"Saber Exercise 1914\\", and \\"Diary of the Instructor in Swordsmanship\\". Patton's original saber is on display at the General George Patton Museum at Ft. Knox, Kentucky. Design The design was influenced by the French heavy cavalry sword of the Napoleonic Wars as well as French cavalry doctrine that emphasized the use of the point over the edge and is similar to the British Pattern 1908 and 1912 cavalry swords. The Model 1913 saber features a large, basket-shaped hilt mounting a straight, double-edged, thrusting blade designed for use by heavy cavalry. It was designed in accordance with Patton's system of swordsmanship, which was published by the War Department as the 1914 Saber Exercise manual,Saber Exercise 1914 and which emphasized the use of the point over the edge.Charles M. Province, The M1913 \\"Patton\\" Saber web page (accessed 20 April 2015). Its design was wrongly thought to have influenced today's Hungarian saber, which is used in sport fencing, however, there is no connection to the modern fencing sabre, which developed from traditional Hungarian and Italian weapons and was introduced in 1910. A modern reproduction is overall with a blade and weighs . The blade is straight and tapered, the front edge running the whole length of the blade and double-edged for half its length. Considering the weight of the bell and grip assembly, it would be balanced much closer to the hand than the typical weapon associated with the name \\"cavalry saber\\". *It has a blued steel (some were nickel plated) \\"cup-hilt\\" and a black composition grip. *The scabbards (three variants) are of wood covered by leather, then covered with green canvas. The furniture (throat and drag) are of blued steel. Others were nickel plated steel—\\"garrison scabbards\\".The garrison scabbard is relatively scarce, as fewer than 10,500 were made between 1913-1914. *It was worn attached to the saddle of the horse, rather than being attached to the waist of the trooper. Use According to KJ Parker, Patton's saber was light, slim, exceptionally ergonomic and well-balanced – in short, \\"more or less perfect, the best sword ever issued to an army.\\" Amberger, on the other hand, considered the weapon to be poorly suited for the cavalry use intended, since at the speed of a cavalry charge, a thrust that transfixed an opponent could not be withdrawn quickly enough, and thus the attacker must either abandon his blade, break his wrist or dislocate his sword arm by holding on to it, or risk worse consequences: \\"At worst, his dead opponent would drag him off his own horse—making him an unarmed foot soldier in an ocean of falling saber blades and trampling hooves.\\"J. Christoph Amberger, \\"Patton's Folly\\", page 41-45, The Secret History of the Sword, 1996 Hammerterz Forum, revised edition 1999 Multi-media Books, Inc.. Patton's 1914 manual \\"Saber Exercise 1914\\" outlined a system of training for both mounted and on-foot use of the saber. Patton's thoughts were expressed in his 1913 report \\"The Form and Use of the Saber\\". He expanded on his \\"Saber Exercise 1914\\" manual the next year, at the request of his students at the Mounted Service School in Fort Riley, Kansas, with the publication of \\"Diary of the Instructor in Swordsmanship\\". In any case, when it was issued, it was already militarily obsolete because modern warfare did not allow the cavalry charges for which it was intended. According to Parker, \\"if it was ever drawn in anger, I can find no record of it.\\" References *George S.

The Massachusetts Alliance to Reform CORI, Boston Workers' Alliance, EPOCA and Neighbor to Neighbor, amongst other groups advocate for various changes, including quicker sealing of older records. Reform advocates call the reports flawed and difficult to interpret. CORIs display all court arraignments—regardless of the eventual outcome of the case—and advocates say this in effect turns all criminal histories into \\"life sentences\\". They also point out that the social and economic impact of CORI affects the children of former offenders. After a reform in the early 2010s, one must wait 10 years for a felony and five years for a misdemeanor after final disposition (the date probation is finished) to apply to the Office of the Commissioner of ProbationOffice of the Commissioner of Probation and have this record sealed. If however, during this time that individual receives even a minor citation, such as a traffic ticket for more than $50, he or she must wait an additional 15/10 years. As of 2010, a reform bill is in the state legislature, which would reduce these wait times. The reform also allows judges to seal dismissed cases after probation period.

Life and career Andy Statman was born in New York City and grew up in the borough of Queens. Beginning at age 12, he learned to play banjo and guitar, following the example of his older brother Jimmy, and then switched to mandolin, which he studied briefly under lifelong- friend David Grisman. He learned to play R&B; and jazz saxophone, for a time under the tutelage of Richard Grando, who played saxophone in Earth Opera. As a teenager Statman was already performing in public in Washington Square Park and with local string bands. In 1969 he attended Franconia College in Franconia, New Hampshire, but eventually dropped-out to pursue a musical career. He first gained acclaim as a mandolinist as a sideman with David Bromberg and Russ Barenberg, as well as in the pioneering bluegrass bands Country Cookin' and Breakfast Special. During the course of exploring a wide range of roots and ethnic music, Statman turned to klezmer music, traditional Eastern European Jewish instrumental music. This led Statman, who grew up in a traditional but secular Jewish home, to reconnect with his Jewish roots. Andy Statman playing clarinet. Statman studied klezmer clarinet during the 1970s with legendary klezmer clarinetist Dave Tarras, who bequeathed several of his clarinets to him. Statman also produced Dave Tarras's last recording. As a clarinetist, he recorded several albums that were highly influential in the Klezmer revival of those years. Still forging ahead musically, he began playing Chassidic melodies, fusing bluegrass, klezmer, and jazz along the way. Given his apprenticeship with Tarras and his subsequent master classes at workshops such as KlezKamp as well as privately, Statman became a renowned exponent of traditional Jewish and avant-garde clarinet styles. The Andy Statman Trio, which includes bassist Jim Whitney and percussionist Larry Eagle, plays regularly at Darech Amuno Synagogue in Greenwich Village in New York City, and tours nationally as schedules allow. In 1983, he performed on the Antilles Records release Swingrass '83. He has participated in a yearly klezmer concert series with Itzhak Perlman and other klezmer superstars. In 2007, he was a Grammy Awards nominee in the Best Country Instrumental Performance category for his version of Bill Monroe's \\"Rawhide\\" on Shefa CD East Flatbush Blues. In 2008, Statman appeared as a guest on the Bela Fleck and the Flecktones holiday album Jingle All the Way, playing both clarinet and mandolin. The album won Best Pop Instrumental Album at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards. He joined the group in concert on December 10 at the University at Buffalo, Center for the Arts, and December 16 at Philadelphia's Kimmel Center. Old Brooklyn, a multi-artist recording project, was released in October 2011 on Shefa Records. This double CD features the American roots, R&B;, Chassidic and other sides of his music, performed with his trio, Jim Whitney on bass and Larry Eagle on drums and percussion, along with fiddler Byron Berline and guitarist Jon Sholle. Guest artists include Ricky Skaggs, Béla Fleck, Paul Shaffer, Bruce Molsky, Art Baron, Marty Rifkin, Bob Jones, Lew Soloff, Kristen Muller and John Goodman. His next album was Superstring Theory, released in November 2013, which hosts fiddler Michael Cleveland and guitarist Tim O'Brien. On June 19, 2012, the National Endowment for the Arts announced that Andy Statman would be awarded a National Heritage Fellowship, the nation's highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. He performed with other recipients of this fellowship in Washington, DC, on October 4, 2012. Andy Statman plays a Will Kimble F-5 mandolin, after having played an early 1920s Gibson A2Z for more than 35 years. He plays several Albert-system clarinets.

Of very ancient origin, probably dating back to the conversion of the country by the Celtic monks, it is comparable to the parades associated with Saint Patrick's Day in Ireland or New York City. A pardon is a penitential ceremony. A pardon occurs on the feast of the patron saint of a church or chapel, at which an indulgence is granted. Hence use of the word \\"pardon\\". Pardons only occur in the traditionally Breton language speaking Western part of Brittany. They do not extend farther east than Guingamp. Types The faithful go on a pilgrimage either to the tomb of a saint or a place dedicated to a saint. The locations may be associated with miraculous appearances, as in Querrien, or holy relics. The pardons begin in March and end in October, but the majority of them are between Easter and Michaelmas. Traditionally pilgrims wore their best costumes, each diocese and parish having a distinctive style, and otherwise only worn at weddings. However, traditional Breton costume is now not typically worn, except at the Locronan pardon, in honour of Saint Ronan. Penitents travel as a group in parishes, fraternities or other corporate bodies, bringing banners, crosses and other insignia in procession, each group competing with the others for grandeur. The leader of the pardon, typically a high ranking ecclesiastic, has the title of \\"pardonnor\\". If relics are involved, he will normally carry them during part of the procession. For most of the pilgrimage, however, this honour falls to those who were considered to be worthiest of it by the various social groups represented. The greater part of the day is spent in prayer, and the pardon begins with an early Mass at 4 AM. Its observance, however, has actually commenced earlier, for the preceding evening is devoted to confession, and the rosary is generally recited by the pilgrims the whole way to the place of the pardon. After the religious service, a great procession takes place around the church. This is the most picturesque part of the pardon and may be regarded as its mise en scène. At Ste-Anne d'Auray, this procession is especially striking. In the procession join all those who believe that the intercession of St. Anne has saved them in times of peril. Sailors will carry fragments of a vessel, upon which they escaped in a shipwreck; the once lame will carry on their shoulders crutches which they no longer need; and those rescued from fire will carry the rope or ladder by which they escaped from the flames. The religious observances are usually followed by social events including picnics and, traditionally, wrestling matches. Significance The dispersal of the pilgrims until meeting at the appointed place, like the procession, symbolises the desire to obtain intercession from the celebrated saint by offering the effort of the journey as an act of faith. This reflects the Christian view that the human condition on this earth is a journey towards the Kingdom of heaven or the new promised land. Following this logic, the pilgrims are invited to confess their sins to their priests before taking part in the mass, which is often followed by solemn vespers. Once they are granted absolution, the groups engage in communal festivities to express the joy of Christian redemption. This can take the form of a village fair or even resemble a funfair. Principal pardons The Pardon of Saint Yves in Tréguier, 2005 There are five major pardons: Saint Yves at Tréguier, known as the pardon of the poor; Our Lady of Rumengol, known as the pardon of the singers; Saint- Jean-du-Doigt, near Morlaix, called the pardon of fire; Saint Ronan, or the pardon of the mountain; and Sainte Anne de la Palud, or the pardon of the sea. Very large pilgrimages are made to some pardons, including those of St. Jean- du-Doigt and Sainte-Anne-d'Auray in Morbihan. The Locronan pardon of Saint Ronan involves a troménie (a 12 km-long procession). The former occurs on 24 June, and that of Ste Anne d'Auray on 24 July, the anniversary of the finding of the miraculous statue of Saint Anne by the peasant Yves Nicolazic. The latter is regarded as the most famous pilgrimage in all Brittany, and attracts pilgrims from Tréguier, Léonnais, Cornouaille, and especially from Morbihan. Some pardons are held during notable religious festivals, such as the Feast of the Assumption on August 15. The pardons dedicated to the Virgin Mary are usually followed by those dedicated to Mary's mother Saint Anne, patron saint of Brittany. However, the majority honour local saints because of their patronage role to protect specific categories of people or activities. Thus there are pardons dedicated to Saint Gildas at the beginning of June in Trégor, to Saint Guirec, patron of girls about to marry, and to the patron saints of individual parishes. The pardon of Saint Yves in Tréguier honours, though him, the legal profession, of which he is patron. Its influence is now international, since thousands of pilgrims, official or anonymous, from all the countries of the world, meet at his tomb in the parish of his birthplace, in fraternities of lawyers, judges and other legal professionals. Pardons in art Femmes de Plougastel au Pardon de Sainte-Anne-La-Palud, by Charles Cottet. Pardons were a popular subject in 19th century French art, since the local people dressed in their elaborate traditional Breton costume for the ceremonies, and also involved open-air public festivities. Many artists came to Brittany to portray pardons. Jules Breton and Pascal Dagnan-Bouveret painted a number of such scenes. Paintings by members of the Pont-Aven School such as Paul Sérusier and Paul Gauguin's Vision after the Sermon are also inspired by this aspect of Breton culture.

His career on the pro circuit spanned the early 1950s to the mid-'70s. He was known for being one of the most talented and versatile riders, and for wearing a cheap straw hat while working on his motorcycle. Background Born in Salt Lake City, Utah, Mann rode his first motorcycle as a teenager when he delivered papers on a Cushman scooter in Richmond, California. He learned how to ride dirt competitively on a cinder running track at the area schools. He would also ride on the cow trails in the area, experiences that would later help him in motocross. After high school, he started helping at fellow Motorcycle Hall of Fame member Hap Alzina's BSA shop in Oakland as a mechanic. Racing career=1950s In the summer of 1954 he started touring as an amateur with professional Al Gunter. Mann turned expert in 1955, and finished seventh on a Harley-Davidson in his first Grand National race, the Daytona 200. At this time, the race was held on the Daytona Beach Road Course. He slowly made a name for himself in his first three years, and he finished in the top ten in the season points for the first time in 1957.

Design and Fabrication 1968 Yankee Prototype Throughout his racing career, Mann was an innovative designer and fabricator of frames and related hardware. He also worked for and acted as consultant to several motorcycle manufacturers. 1960s In 1966, Dick designed and fabricated a large diameter backbone Chromoly frame for his BSA A65. Elements of its geometry became the hallmark of several of his designs. In 1967, he was retained by John Taylor of Yankee Motor Corp. and incorporated the same design elements into the Yankee 500Z. In 1969 while with Yankee, he designed and worked with Frank Conner of OSSA/West to build the highly successful OSSA/DMR flat tracker. After winning several National races, the DMR was put into a short run of production by Yankee with 150 units being produced in 1970-71. He was also influential on styling. Design elements of an earlier BSA of Dick's appeared on the Ossa Wildfire SS tank in 1967, the DMR tank, and the tank and seat that graced the first 500Z prototypes in 1968. That prototype had influence on later designs such as Craig Vetter's Triumph X75 Hurricane. 1970s In 1975 Mann started designing frames for the Yamaha XT 500.In all he sold some 200 frames for this engine in four marks, the final frames being completed in 1982. He also designed variations for the Honda XL/XR500 and the Suzuki DR/SP370. All the production frames were constructed by Terry Knight based on each of Mann's home built and extensively tested prototypes. Current life He owns a business specializing in restoring and selling vintage race motorcycles. He also continues to actively participate in American Historic Racing Motorcycle Association (AHRMA) Vintage Moto-Cross racing. His wife's name is Kay. Biography *Mann of His Time, Ed Youngblood.

From 1919 to 1923, he attended Breslau University, Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg, University of Greifswald, and University of Göttingen. He received his doctorate in 1923 under Richard Adolf Zsigmondy at Göttingen.Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Thiessen. Career=Early years In 1923, Thiessen was a supernumerary assistant at the University of Göttingen and from 1924 to 1930 was a regular teaching assistant. He joined the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (Nazi Party) in 1925. He became a Privatdozent at Göttingen in 1926. In 1930, he became head of the department of inorganic chemistry there, and in 1932 he also became an untenured extraordinarius professor.Holloway, 1994, 110. In 1933, Thiessen became a department head at the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für physikalische Chemie und Elektrochemie (KWIPC) of the Kaiser- Wilhelm Gesellschaft (KWG). For a short time in 1935, he became an ordinarius professor of chemistry at the University of Münster. Later, that year and until 1945, he became an ordinarius professor at the Humboldt University of Berlin and director of the KWIPC in Berlin-Dahlem. As director of the KWIPC, he transformed it into a model National Socialist organization.Hentschel, 1996, 56. Thiessen was the main advisor and confidant to Rudolf Mentzel, who was head of the chemistry and organic materials section of the Reichsforschungsrat (RFR, Reich Research Council). Thiessen, as director of the KWIPC, had a flat on Faradayweg in Dahlem that the former director Fritz Haber used for business purposes; Thiessen shared this flat with Mentzel. In the Soviet Union Before the end of World War II, Thiessen had Communist contacts. He, Manfred von Ardenne, director of his private laboratory Forschungslaboratoriums für Elektronenphysik,sachen.de - Zur Ehrung von Manfred von Ardenne. Gustav Hertz, Nobel Laureate and director of the second research laboratory at Siemens, and Max Volmer, ordinarius professor and director of the Physical Chemistry Institute at the Berlin Technische Hochschule, had made a pact. The pact was a pledge that whoever first made contact with the Russians would speak for the rest. The objectives of their pact were threefold: (1) prevent plunder of their institutes, (2) continue their work with minimal interruption, and (3) protect themselves from prosecution for any political acts of the past.Heinemann-Grüder, 2002, 44. On 27 April 1945, Thiessen arrived at von Ardenne’s institute in an armored vehicle with a major of the Soviet Army, who was also a leading Soviet chemist.Oleynikov, 2000, 5. All four were taken to the Soviet Union. Von Ardenne was made head of Institute A,Goals of Manfred von Ardennne’s Institute A included: (1) Electromagnetic separation of isotopes, for which von Ardenne was the leader, (2) Techniques for manufacturing porous barriers for isotope separation, for which Peter Adolf Thiessen was the leader, and (3) Molecular techniques for separation of uranium isotopes, for which Max Steenbeck was the leader. In his first meeting with Lavrentij Beria, von Ardenne was asked to participate in building the bomb, but von Ardenne quickly realized that participation would prohibit his repatriation to Germany, so he suggested isotope enrichment as an objective, which was agreed to. By the end of the 1940s, nearly 300 Germans were working at the institute, and they were not the total work force. See Oleynikov, 2000, 10-11.Institute A was used as the basis for the Sukhumi Physical-Technical Institute. See Oleynikov, 2000, 12. in Sinop,Oleynikov, 2000, 11-12.Naimark, 1995, 213. a suburb of Sukhumi. Hertz was made head of Institute G,Topics assigned to Gustav Hertz’s Institute G included: (1) Separation of isotopes by diffusion in a flow of inert gases, for which Gustav Hertz was the leader, (2) Development of a condensation pump, for which Justus Mühlenpfordt was the leader, (3) Design and build a mass spectrometer for determining the isotopic composition of uranium, for which Werner Schütze was the leader, (4) Development of frameless (ceramic) diffusion partitions for filters, for which Reinhold Reichmann was the leader, and (5) Development of a theory of stability and control of a diffusion cascade, for which Heinz Barwich was the leader. After 1950, Hertz moved to Moscow. See Oleynikov, 2000, 12-13 and 18. Also see Kruglov, 2002, 131. in Agudseri (Agudzery), about 10 km southeast of Sukhumi and a suburb of Gul’rips (Gulrip’shi). Volmer went to the Nauchno-Issledovatel’skij Institut-9 (NII-9, Scientific Research Institute No. 9),Today, NII-9 is the Bochvar All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Inorganic Materials, Bochvar VNIINM. See Oleynikov, 2000, 4. in Moscow; he was given a design bureau to work on the production of heavy water.Oleynikov, 2000, 13. In Institute A, Thiessen became leader for developing techniques for manufacturing porous barriers for isotope separation.Oleynikov, 2000, 11. In 1949, six German scientists, including Hertz, Thiessen, and Barwich, were called in for consultation at Sverdlovsk-44, which was responsible for uranium enrichment. The plant, which was smaller than the American Oak Ridge gaseous diffusion plant, was getting only a little over half of the expected 90% or higher enrichment.Holloway, 1994, 191-192. Awards for uranium enrichment technologies were made in 1951 after testing of a bomb with uranium; the first test was with plutonium. Thiessen received a Stalin Prize, first class.Oleynikov, 2000, 21. Return to Germany Thiessen returned to the Deutsche Demokratische Republik (DDR, German Democratic Republic) in the mid-1950s as a Fellow of the Academy of Sciences and from 1956 was director of the Institute of Physical Chemistry in East Berlin. From 1957 to 1965, he was also chairman of the Forschungsrat der DDR (Research Council of the German Democratic Republic).Fritz Haber Institute – MPG.Thiessen – German Wikipedia.Hentschel, 2007, 78 - 79.

It consists of several divided sections of stores and attractions located on filled land over top of Louis Lake, next to the Intracoastal Waterway. Barefoot Landing was previously known as the Village of the Barefoot Traders which was a collection of 15 unusual gift shops that was located on 3½ acres along a natural marsh and in 1988 was rebuilt and opened as Barefoot Landing. The complex, a popular tourist attraction, has over 100 stores and restaurants, on all sides of a small lake, plus it has adjoining areas with Alabama Theatre, House of Blues and Alligator Adventure. History Barefoot Landing was originally a residential area that had its own private marina, that was developed in the 1970s into a quaint \\"village\\" of shops. The Village of Barefoot Traders opened in March 1972 on 3-1/2 acres containing 15 shops surrounded by Louis Lake. In 1988, the entire area was redeveloped and expanded into a much larger complex, consolidated under a single owner, and was rebranded from The Village of Barefoot Traders to Barefoot Landing. Several unexploded bombs were unearthed during the construction of the resort. The bombs were left over from when the property was used as part of a bombing/gunnery range for the military. Purchase by Burroughs and Chapin On December 12, 2012 Burroughs & Chapin along with an investment firm, put in a bid to purchase Barefoot Landing and a memo was sent out to the merchants of Barefoot Landing, notifying them of the potential sale. On April 2, 2013 it was reported that B&C; would take control of Barefoot Landing that month and a holding company called \\"Barefoot Landing Commercial, LLC\\" filed for incorporation in late January. The purchase was finalized on March 31. Current tenants would not notice any notable changes to the property or its administrative staff. On April 15, 2013 it was also reported that Burroughs & Chapin paid $43 million for Barefoot Landing and the sale closed on March 1, with Barefoot Landing Commercial, LLC paying $43 million for the 64-acre complex which is according to the Register of Deeds office of Horry County. According to tenants, small improvements are set to be made at Barefoot Landing in the next month including installed fountains, playing music throughout the center, and replacing some of the aging boards in the wooden walkways. On April 14, 2014, The Sun News reported that Barefoot Landing would be undergoing a renovation, along with the addition of 10 new stores. Work included replacing the pedestrian bridges, renovating and expanding the restrooms, freshening up landscaping and resurfacing the parking lots. In Spring 2018, LuLu's by Lucy Buffett opened with 400 seats, live music performances, rope climbing and its own beach, as the anchor to a restaurant district called Dockside Village. Resort On December 15, 1998, Silver Carolina Development and Barefoot Landing Inc. presented plans to the North Myrtle Beach city council for the $812 million 2345-acre Barefoot Landing Resort, which would be built over 12 to 15 years. The resort would have four golf courses, two hotels, a marina, and 5000 housing units, along with commercial, office and retail space. Late in 1999, the city annexed the area, a move expected to double the population in the city limits. In March 2000, a renovated swing bridge built in 1934 was moved from Edenton, North Carolina to cross the Intracoastal Waterway, connecting the resort to the shopping center. The golf courses opened in April, though the bridge was not ready, after a delay caused by damage from Hurricane Floyd. The Resort's section of greenway is a part of the East Coast Greenway, a 3,000-mile long system of trails connecting Maine to Florida. The International Association of Golf Tour Operators named Barefoot Resort 2016 North American Golf Resort of the Year.

Some members of the family gained wider exposure due to their discovery of various islands in the Pacific Ocean. Valentine Starbuck Valentine Starbuck was born on May 22, 1791, in Nantucket. A descendant of one of the first Anglo-European settlers of Nantucket, Valentine commanded various whalers in the Pacific. In 1823 he was captain of the British whaleship , which Hawaiian King Kamehameha II chartered for a trip to Britain on a state visit. The passengers included Queen Kamāmalu and a few other nobles. The Hawaiian king and queen died of measles while at London, and Valentine was sued by his employers for not completing his whaling voyage.Dunmore, p 238 Prior to his journey to London, Valentine had sighted an island in the Pacific, known as Starbuck or Volunteer Island. When Royal Navy captain George Anson Byron came across this island when returning the bodies of the Hawaiian king and queen to their homeland on , he named the island \\"Starbuck\\" in Valentine's honour. However, his cousin Obed Starbuck had sighted the island previously. Obed Starbuck Obed Starbuck was born on May 11, 1797, also in Nantucket, and died June 27, 1882. Whaling in the Pacific for many years, Obed made a number of significant voyages. Sailing on the Hero 1822-1824, which returned to Nantucket with 2,173 barrels of sperm oil, he discovered an island on 5 September 1823, located at 5°32' S, 155°5' W, since known as Starbuck Island (also called \\"Hero Island\\").Dunmore, p 237 From 1824 to 1826, Obed captained the Loper, in which vessel he was the first European to visit an outlying island in the Phoenix group, which he named \\"New Nantucket\\" and which, when re-discovered in 1835 by Michael Baker, was renamed Baker Island. Obed named \\"Loper Island\\" (Niutao) which was sighted by Francisco Antonio Mourelle on May 5, 1781,Keith S.

Emmett in 1820, although it is hard to be precise due to the bearings given.Sharp, p 211 On this journey, Obed also completed the mapping of Tuvalu, which had been begun by Captain George Barrett of the Nantucket whaler Independence II.Quanchi & Robson, p 163 Other sources suggest that Obed discovered New Nantucket in 1823, while aboard the Hero.Sharp, pp 210–13 J.N.

The park was the first South Carolina State Park to open in 1936. It was developed by the Civilian Conservation Corps, a New Deal Program created by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The program was designed to provide employment during the Great Depression while addressing national needs in conservation and recreation. The CCC was instrumental in the development of many of South Carolina’s state parks. A number of buildings built by the CCC in the 1930s are still in use there. The park includes one mile of undeveloped beach in Horry County. The park's maritime forest has been declared a Heritage Trust Site. The maritime forest includes live oaks and southern magnolias. Other unique features include sea oats located on the dunes and an expansive sand dunes system along the beach. The Myrtle Beach State Park Nature Center features interactive natural history displays, saltwater aquariums and live animals. Programs about coastal habitat and native wildlife are offered throughout the year. The park also has two nature trails: the Yaupon Nature Trail and the Sculptured Oak Nature Trail. Myrtle Beach State park is open from 6 am to 8 pm with extended hours from March to November. A fee is charged for admission to the park. South Carolina Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism offers annual Passports that can significantly decrease admission fees based upon usage. Camping The campground has 140 standard sites with individual water and electrical hookups and an additional 138 sites with full hookup. All sites are convenient to hot showers, restrooms and laundromat facilities. All sites also have complimentary wi-fi access. The main campground is located approximately 300 yards from the beach. The overflow campground is for tents only, does not provide electricity and has central water. The 30-site overflow campground is open Easter weekend through Labor Day. The Ranger Station (store/registration located at the campground entrance) includes limited grocery items, camping supplies, souvenirs, drinks, snacks, and firewood. Six cabins, located 200 yards from the beach, are completely furnished, heated, air-conditioned, and supplied with bath and bed linens, basic cooking and eating utensils and TV. Prices vary throughout the year. The Pier The park has a fishing pier that stretches out into the Atlantic Ocean for prime fishing. A South Carolina fishing license is not required to fish from the pier; however, you do have to pay for daily fishing. An annual pass for the calendar year is available. Fishing for sharks is prohibited from the fishing pier. Surf fishing is allowed; however, it is not allowed on the beach where lifeguards are on duty and a South Carolina saltwater fishing license is required. Typical fish caught include flounder, king mackerel, sheepshead, whiting, spot, spanish mackerel, drum and blues. The Beach Horry County lifeguards are stationed on the north section of Myrtle Beach State Park from mid-May through mid- September. Umbrellas and beach chairs are available to rent from the lifeguards. The beach at Myrtle Beach State Park falls within the jurisdiction of Horry County, and therefore abides by Horry County Ordinances and Regulations. Horry County also has ordinances that prohibit pets and bicycles on public beaches from May 1 through Labor Day between the hours of 10 am and 5 pm. Equestrian Trails Beach access is available beginning the third Saturday in November and continues through the last day of February for horseback riding. A permit is required for each horse that enters the park. Horses are not allowed in the park overnight. Riders must have current Negative Coggins papers for each horse brought into the park (per SC Code of Laws, Act 13, 1976, Sec 1, Chapter 13, Title 47).

He is the epitomized antithesis of Tishtrya, divinity of the star Sirius and guardian of rainfall. In Zoroastrian tradition, Apaosha appears as Aposh or Apaush. For many decades, the Avestan common noun ' \\"drought\\" was thought to derive from either * \\"burning away\\" or * \\"stemming the waters.\\". In the late 1960s, it was proposed that ' was the antonym of an unattested derivative of * \\"thriving\\". This explanation, which is also supported by Old Indic ' with the same meaning, is today well accepted. Avestan ' thus originally meant \\"not thriving\\". In scripture In the mythology of Yasht 8.21-29,. Tishtrya, as a mighty white horse with golden ears and golden tail, rushes towards the cosmic sea Vourukhasha. On his way, he is confronted by Apaosha as a horrible black horse with black ears and black tail. They battle for three days and nights until Apaosha drives Tishtrya away. Tishtrya then complains to Ahura Mazda that he was weakened because humankind did not give him his due of proper prayers and sacrifices. Ahura Mazda then himself offers sacrifice to Tishtrya, who now strengthened reengages Apaosha in battle at noon and conquers the demon of drought. Tishtrya then causes the rains to fall freely upon the earth and all is well again. This legend has been interpreted to be a mythological conflation of a seasonal and astronomical event: The heliacal rising of Sirius (with which Tishtrya is associated) occurred in July, just before the hottest and driest time of the year. For the next few days, Sirius is visible at dawn as a glimmering star (doing battle with Apaosha). In the torrid summer months, as Sirius becomes more directly visible, the light of the star appears to grow stronger (Tishtrya gathering strength) until it is steadily visible in the firmament (Apaosha vanquished). With the defeat of Apaosha, the rainy season begins (in late autumn). A mythological explanation of the heliacal setting of Sirius is only alluded to in the Avesta: In Yasht 18.5-6,. Apaosha is contrasted with the bringers of prosperity, that is, Tishtrya and his assistants Vata and Khwarrah. In these verses, the demon of drought is described as the \\"numbing frost.\\" In tradition The description of the battle between Apaosha and Tishtrya is reproduced in the 9th-12th century texts of Zoroastrian tradition, where Apaosha now appears as Middle Persian Aposh (apōš), and Tishtrya is now Tishtar or Tishter. In the Bundahishn, a cosmological fable completed in the 12th century, the opposition is established during the creation: the second phase of the war between creation (with its guardians) and Angra Mainyu (MP→ Ahriman) is over control of the waters and of the rains. In this war (Bundahishn 7.8-10,. and Zadspram 6.9-11), Apaosha is assisted by Spenjagr, who is however defeated by a bolt of lightning. On the opposing front, Tishtrya is supported by Verethragna (→ Vahman), Haoma (→ Hom), Apam Napat (→ Burz), the hordes of the fravashis and by the Vayu (→ Weh). In the Bundahishn, Apaosha is identified with the planet Mercury, the astrological opposition to Sirius being a product of the contact with Chaldea, and which may be a lingering trace of the Zurvanite doctrine that places stars in opposition to planets. Dadistan i denig 93 reiterates Apaosha's attempt to prevent rain. Upon being defeated by Tishtrya, Apaosha then attempts to make the rains cause damage (93.12.). Dadistan i denig 93 provides a folk etymology of Aposh as Middle Persian ab osh \\"(having) the destruction of water.\\" Notes * The heliacal rising of Sirius presently occurs in early August. But 2500 years ago, it occurred about two weeks earlier. See precession of the equinoxes.

Francisco (Francesco) Leonardoni (1654–1711) was an Italian painter of the Baroque period, active mainly in Spain. He was born in Venice, where he studied but was forced to leave the republic and travelled through various parts of Europe, till he settled at Madrid in 1680. There he distinguished himself by his portrait miniatures, although he also painted several pictures for the churches. In June 1694, after the death of Claudio Coello, he became the painter for Queen Mariana of Neuburg. For the church of the Convent of Atocha at Madrid he painted a Marriage and Death of St. Joseph and in the church of San Gerónimo el Real, a large altar-piece of the Annunciation. He also restored the Transfiguration, a large altar at the Salvador church in Leganés which was completed in 1702. He died in Madrid. References * *Ceán Bermúdez, Juan Agustín (1800).

Feuti grew up in Pascoag, Rhode Island, where he and his older sister were raised by their single mother, who worked in a screen windows factory. “Growing up in a single-parent family during America’s first ‘Great Recession’ wasn’t always easy, but I look back on my formative years fondly,” said Feuti.Moore, Matt. “Seriously Funny”. Associated Press, March 6, 2012. He drew in high school but wasn't impressed enough by his drawing ability to apply to an art school. He is a resident of Plainville, Massachusetts. Retail In Massachusetts, Feuti had over 15 years of retail management experience at seven different stores, selling everything from arts and crafts supplies, jewelry and men's footwear to clothing, giftware and toys. He first worked at a convenience store, recalling: :They insisted we wear an apron. Our clientele was generally getting out of a bar late at night, coming in, yelling that we were out of their brand of cigarettes, and we still had to put on an apron to create an air of respectability.Barbaro, Michael. \\"Panel by Comic Panel, a Retail Clerk Exacts His Revenge\\". The New York Times, December 31, 2005. Next, he was employed at Father and Son Shoes, selling backpacks: :As the company moved into the backpack business, it asked employees to wear a backpack around the store and compete to sell the highest number. Customers mocked him, the bag proved uncomfortable and, in the end, he said, the only contest winner was the store's manager, who received a color television. Soon, he switched to Bostonian, an upscale shoe store where the merchandise was more expensive and the customers complained more loudly. One shopper called the store to report that a shoelace had broken off. It was unclear how the lace had broken, or what it had to do with the store, but the man angrily demanded that Mr. Feuti mail him a new one, which he did. After that, Mr. Feuti worked at Learningsmith, an educational toy and gift store, where, he recalled, he encountered parents who thought that their children were little geniuses in the making. When Mr. Feuti steered one mother to a series of Looney Tunes- themed workbooks she sneered that her highly literate children \\"never watch television.\\" Tapping into such past experiences, Feuti's daily comic strip Retail was launched on January 1, 2006 by King Features Syndicate. Feuti ended Retail on February 23, 2020. Gil In 2008, Feuti created a second strip, Gil, as a web comic on his website. The main character is an eight-year-old boy named Gil who is raised by his single mother Cheryl in a poverty-stricken household. Gil also sees his father Frank occasionally, a ne'er-do-well who often offers Gil questionable advice. Secondary characters include Gil's friend and confidant Shandra and his antagonist Morgan. In 2011, Gil was picked up for syndication by King Features and launched in newspapers on January 2, 2012.Racine, Tom. \\"Norm Feuti Returns\\". Tall Tale Radio, September 26, 2011. Living in Massachusetts in 2012, Feuti dreamed up Gil ideas while observing his children, along with memories of his own childhood experiences.

Baptism may be by immersion or pouring or sprinkling if water is not available for immersion.\\" Ordination: \\"Ordination into Christian service is for men and woman who have experienced salvation through faith in Christ Jesus and who are baptized believers called by Christ through the Holy Spirit to serve Him in ministry. TheLEPC believes that God has set aside particular individuals for service and that ordination is man’s recognition of what God Himself has already done. Men and women may serve as co-laborers with Christ in the harvest fields. Men and women may serve as deacons, overseers, apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, and evangelist as examples of all of these can be found in scripture concerning both male and female. From the beginning authority was given to both male and female. In Christ there is neither male nor female, Gentile or Jew, but all are children and servants of God. All are called as a royal priesthood. All levels of leadership are open to spirit led men and women of God.\\" Homosexuality: \\"The Lutheran Evangelical Protestant Church follows the Bible in all matters of faith including the issue of homosexuality. The LEPC will not knowingly ordain any practicing homosexual to the Christian ministry. The belief of the LEPC is that homosexuality should not be an issue causing division and debate within the Church at large, as Holy Scripture already settles the debate.

LEPC Clergy minister to all people,welcomes all people following the example of the Lord, Jesus Christ.\\" Marriage: \\"Marriage is the union of a man and a woman. It is a vow made before God that the two (male and female) shall become one. The General Conference of Evangelical Protestant Churches, LEPC and EPC, does not perform same sex unions or bless same sex couples.\\" Abortion: \\"Abortion is the willful taking of innocent human life. Human life begins at conception because there is simply no other point that it can begin. Therefore, abortion is not acceptable under any circumstance except in the rare and unusual instance where the life of the mother is at real risk. Only then should an abortion be considered.\\" Israel and the Jewish People: \\"The Jewish people are God's chosen people. Believers should bless them as scripture says that God will bless those who bless Israel and curse those who curse Israel. The LEPC/EPC/GCEPC recant and renounce the works and words of Martin Luther concerning the Jewish people.On the Jews and their Lies Prayer is offered for the healing of the Jewish people, their peace and their prosperity. Prayer is offered for the peace of Jerusalem.With deep sorrow and regret repentance is offered to the Jewish People for the harm that Martin Luther caused and any contribution to their harm. Forgiveness is requested of the Jewish People for these actions.The Gospel is to the Jew first and then the Gentile. Gentiles (believers in Christ other than Jews) have been grafted into the vine. In Christ there is neither Jew nor Gentile but the Lord's desire is that there be one new man from the two for Christ broke down the wall of separation with His own body (Ephesians 2:14-15).The EPC GCEPC/LEPC blesses Israel and the Jewish people.

Many schisms have come in the Body of Christ because of conflicts and disagreements over \\"non-essentials.\\" In the non-essentials liberty is offered for where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. In all things charity is offered as well as blessing. The EPC GCEPC/LEPC labors alongside others in the Body of Christ in the work of the Lord Jesus Christ as all believers long for His second coming. The Lord Jesus Himself first announced his salvation to world, which cannot be neglected, and God added His witness through signs, wonders, and the distribution of the gifts of the Holy Spirit according to God's will. (Hebrews 2:1-4) The Lord Jesus is the head of God's Church. There are many parts but one Body. Each part of the Body of Christ has been given an assignment from the Lord to fulfill until Jesus' coming. The GCEPC/LEPC/EPC endeavors to complete this work in the spirit of unity and in the bonds of peace.\\" Sexual abuse: \\"Incidents of sexual abuse will be reported to civil authorities. Ministers known as perpetrators will not be reassigned nor will known perpetrators be allowed to continue in ministry with the LEPC/GCEPC.\\" Organizational structure The LEPC is overseen by the Presiding Bishop with a life appointment . The Board of Advisors appoints the Presiding Bishop with nominations from the Conference. Synod Bishops are appointed by the Presiding Bishop for life with Board of Advisor approval. All Bishops have five year reviews. The Board of Advisors serves in staggered three and two year renewable terms. EPC GCEPC/LEPC congregations and ministries are autonomous. The church is divided into geographical synods and non-geographical synods. Home groups and one new man fellowships are encouraged. Role of women The EPC GCPEC/LEPC ordains both men and women to the gospel ministry noting that scripture states that in “ Christ Jesus there is neither male not female, Jew or Greek..” Also, noting that the Book of Concord states that seminaries are for the preparation of men and women but more so that Holy Scripture does not specifically direct yes or no but rather indicates by example that women did pursue the gospel ministry and did serve in positions of authority in Biblical times. The EPC GCEPC/LEPC professes the “priesthood of all believers.” The current and sixth Presiding Bishop of the EPC GCEPC/LEPC is The Most Rev. Nancy Kinard Drew. Both males and females may serve on the Executive and Advisory Boards and the Council of Bishops. Apostolic succession The EPC GCEPC/LEPC is in historic and valid Apostolic Succession (AS). AS is not required for salvation or for the ordaining of ministers in the LEPC but is done upon request by the laying on of hands for those who understand and value the process and desires this honor. AS serves as a further encouragement and support in the ministry as well as a channel for open doors among certain people groups. Sacraments The EPC GCEPC/LEPC confesses two sacraments: the Eucharist (Communion, The Lord’s Supper) and Holy Baptism. All believers are welcome at the Lord’s Table. The EPC GCEPC/LEPC will baptize infants but for salvation there must be faith in Christ. As seen by the thief on the cross who was told “Today, you shall be with me in paradise,” there are exceptions to the requirements of baptism. One is not saved through baptism only. Such practice would be empty without faith in Christ but one can be saved by faith in Christ without baptism. Baptism alone does not save. It should not be said \\"I am saved because I am baptized but rather I am saved because of faith in Christ therefore I am/will be baptized.\\" Missions The EPC GCEPC/LEPC is Missions oriented and has congregations and church plants in The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, Angola and Kenya. Concordia Bible Institute of Kenya prepares indigenous ministers to take the salvation message to their own people.Courses through Concordia Theologica Institute for Biblical Studies are available online anywhere in the world for those who desire to meet the educational requirements of the LEPC and link with the LEPC in ministry. Worship The EPC GCEPC/LEPC permits a broad range of worship styles from contemporary to traditional to liturgical to renewal/charismatic and messianic.

Wilson and Frank J. Warnke has been described as the first prose autobiography written by an Italian woman.Graziella Parati, Public History, Private Stories: Italian Women's Autobiography, University of Minnesota Press, 1996. See Synopsis from Barnes & Noble.com. Her story was the subject of Paolo Giacometti’s historical drama Camilla Faa da Casale, first performed at the Teatro Nuovo, Florence on 29 October 1846.. Life She was born to Margherita Fassati and Ardizzino Faà, Count of Bruno, a military man and diplomat. The young Camilla became one of the many companions of the duchess Margherita di Savoia at the Gonzaga court of Casale: capital of the Duchy of Montferrat of which Margherita’s husband Francesco Gonzaga was governor. In February 1612 Francesco’s father Vincenzo died. Francesco succeeded him as Duke of Mantua and of Montferrat and the court transferred from Casale to Mantua where, on 22 December of the same year, Francesco himself died during an outbreak of smallpox. His successor as Duke was Ferdinando, until then a cardinal at Rome with a reputation as a womaniser. The 16-year-old Camilla, now a great beauty and known to all as La bella Ardizzina, became the object of his attention: attentions which she resisted, however, to the point that he was first obliged to promise marriage in writing and then actually to marry her. The nuptials took place in secret on 19 February 1616 in the chapel of the Palazzo Ducale and Camilla became pregnant shortly afterwards. Attempts to keep the marriage secret failed and both the court and Ferdinando’s relations took the news very badly, whether out of envy, or because they thought that the duke had married beneath himself and had failed to protect the dynasty. It appears that initially Ferdinand wanted to maintain the marriage: in August he granted her the marquisate of Mombaruzzo and the income from various territories in Montferrat and in the area of Acqui. However the hostility that she faced from the Mantuan nobility became too much for Camilla and, at her own request, she left the city for Bruno. At this time Montferrat was at war with Savoy, who wanted to wrest it from the Gonzagas. Either out of fear that she would flee to the enemy, or for her own protection from them, she was moved from Bruno to the Castle of the Paleologi at Casale, one of the most heavily fortified cities in Italy. Ferdinando joined her there in November and on 5 December she gave birth to their son, Giacinto Teodoro Giovanni. Ferdinando recognised the boy as his son, while failing to recognise him as his heir; the duke remained in Casale until the New Year. In the meantime he had been persuaded that he should repudiate la bella Ardizzina and make a more dynastically suitable marriage. He achieved both with some alacrity. A pronouncement that the marriage had been invalid was obtained from Pope Paul V, and on 7 February 1617 he married Caterina de’ Medici. Camilla was recalled to Mantua where, to avoid the humiliation of returning as a mere courtier, she took lodgings in a monastery. Giacinto, however, was brought up at the Mantuan court and achieved some popularity. In November 1618 the duke compelled her to enter an enclosed order of nuns in the convent of Corpus Domini at Ferrara. She entered as a secular but in 1622 took her vows and spent the rest of her life there as a nun. Camilla Faà di Bruno died on 14 July 1662 at the age of 63 in the convent of Corpus Domini where she was buried next to an earlier beauty of Ferrara, Lucrezia Borgia. She had far outlived Duke Ferdinando, who died in 1626; Caterina de' Medici, who died, childless, in 1629; and Giacinto, who died of the plague (or perhaps was murdered) in 1630.

Werker that stars Beatrice Pearson, Mel Ferrer (in his first starring role), and Susan Douglas Rubeš. The film is based on William Lindsay White's story of the same title, a nonfiction account of Dr. Albert C. Johnston and his family, who passed for white while living in New England in the 1930s and 1940s. The film won the 1949 Cannes Film Festival award for Best Screenplay. Except for supporting role, white actors were used for the film (whitewashing in film). This was controversial. The film was banned in Atlanta, Georgia and Memphis, Tennessee. Plot In 1922, Scott Mason Carter graduates from Chase Medical School in Chicago and marries Marcia. Both are light-skinned enough to be mistaken for whites. Scott has landed an internship, but his fellow graduate, the dark-skinned Jesse Pridham, wonders if he will have to work as a Pullman porter until there is an opening in a black hospital. When Scott goes to Georgia, the black hospital director tells him that the board of directors has decided to give preference to Southern applicants and rescinds the job offer. The couple live in Boston with Marcia's parents, who have been passing as white. Her father and some of their black friends suggest they do the same. Instead, Scott continues to apply as a Negro and is repeatedly rejected. Scott finally yields, quits his job making shoes, and masquerades as white for a one-year internship in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. There, Scott responds to an emergency. At an isolated lighthouse, he has to operate immediately on a sport fisherman who is bleeding to death. His patient turns out to be Dr. Walter Bracket, the well-known director of a local clinic. Impressed, Dr. Bracket offers Scott a position as town doctor in Keenham (a fictionalized version of Keene, New Hampshire), replacing Bracket's recently deceased father. Scott declines, explaining that he is a Negro. Dr. Bracket, though he admits he would not have made the offer had he known, recommends Scott take the job without revealing his race. With his wife pregnant, Scott reluctantly agrees. Scott and Marcia are relieved when their newborn son appears as white as they do. Scott slowly gains the trust and respect of the residents. By 1942, when the United States enters World War II, the Carters are pillars of the community. Their son, Howard, attends the University of New Hampshire, while daughter Shelly is in high school. Scott goes to Boston once a week to work at the Charles Howard Clinic, which Jesse Pridham and he established for patients of all races. The Carters have kept their secret even from their own children. When Howard invites a black classmate, Arthur Cooper, to visit, Shelly worries aloud what her friends will think about a \\"coon\\" staying in their home. Scott sternly orders her never to use that word again. When Arthur goes to a party with Howard, some guests make bigoted remarks behind his back. Scott and Howard enlist in the Navy, but after a background check, Scott's commission as a lieutenant commander is suddenly revoked for \\"failure to meet physical conditions\\". The only position open to blacks in the Navy is steward. The Carters have no choice but to tell their children the truth. Howard breaks up with his white girlfriend. He rents a room in Harlem and roams the streets. When Shelly's boyfriend Andy asks her about the \\"awful rumor\\" about her family, Shelly confesses that it is true. He asks her to the school dance anyway, but she turns him down. In Harlem, Howard investigates screams and finds two black men fighting. When one pulls out a gun, Howard intervenes. The gun goes off and the gunman flees, but Howard is taken into custody. To a sympathetic black police lieutenant, Howard explains, \\"I came here to find out what it's like to be a Negro.\\" Arthur Cooper collects his friend from the police station.

Thompson *Bai Saunders *Emery Richardson Sources William Lindsay White, a former war correspondent who had become editor and publisher of the Emporia Gazette, published Lost Boundaries in 1948. It was just 91 pages long, and a shorter version had appeared the previous December in Reader's Digest. The story was also reported with photographs in Life, Look, and Ebony. White recounted the true story of the family of Dr. Albert C. Johnston (1900–1988) and his wife Thyra (1904–1995), who lived in New England for 20 years, passing as white despite their Negro backgrounds until they revealed themselves to their children and community. Lost Boundaries focuses on the experience of their eldest son, Albert Johnston, Jr., beginning with the day Albert, Sr., tells his 16-year-old son that he is the son of Negroes who have been passing as white. The story then recounts the lives of the parents. Dr. Johnston graduates from the University of Chicago and Rush Medical College, but finds himself barred from internships when he identifies himself as Negro. He finally secures a position at Maine General Hospital in Portland, which had not inquired about his race. In 1929, he establishes a medical practice in Gorham, New Hampshire. His blue-eyed, pale-skinned wife Thyra and he are active in the community, and no one suspects their racial background, at least not enough to comment on it or question them. In 1939, they move to Keene, New Hampshire, where he takes a position at Elliot Community Hospital. At the start of World War II, he applies for a Navy post as a radiologist, but is rejected when an investigation reveals his racial background. Struck by this rejection, he then shares his and his wife's family history with his eldest son Albert, who responds by isolating himself from friends and failing at school. Albert joins the Navy, still passing as white, but is discharged as \\"psychoneurotic unclassified\\". Albert then tours the U.S. with a white schoolfriend, visiting relatives and exploring lives on either side of the color line. Much of the book is devoted to Albert Jr.'s personal exploration of the world of passing, where he learns how the black community tolerates its members who pass, but disapproves of casual crossing back and forth between the black and white communities. The other Johnston children have their own problems adjusting to their new identity and the acceptance and rejection they experience. Finally, Albert Jr., attending the University of New Hampshire, tells his seminar on international and domestic problems \\"that perhaps he could contribute something to this discussion of the race problem by telling of the problem of crossbred peoples because he was himself a Negro.\\" The film adaptation does not follow the younger Johnston on his exploration of the broader racial landscape, but instead the son in the film visits Harlem, where he witnesses lives lived in the street rather than in the private homes of his New Hampshire environment and becomes involved in violence. The film ends on a note of interracial reconciliation as the white population excuses the Johnstons' deception without examining the economic social pressures that led them to pass as white. The film, in one critic's analysis, presents a subject of racial violence and social injustice within the bounds of a family melodrama. Casting and production Producer Louis de Rochemont was originally to have worked on the film under contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Because they could not agree on how to treat the story, with de Rochemont insisting on working \\"in the style of a restaged newsreel\\", he mortgaged his home and developed other sources of financing so he could work independently. Its status as an independent production led some theaters and audiences to view it as an art film, and art houses proved significant in the film's distribution. De Rochement recruited local townspeople and found a local pastor to play the role of the minister. Filming took place on location in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Kittery, Maine, Kennebunkport, Maine, and Harlem, New York. Mel Ferrer accepted his role reluctantly, at a point in his career when he hoped to direct either theater or film. The leading roles were all cast with white actors, so the film does not present any instances of racial passing, nor of interracial intimacy. Reception The film premiered in New York on June 30, 1949, and screened in Keene, New Hampshire, on July 24, 1949. The Screen Directors Guild awarded Werker its prize for direction for the third quarter of 1949. Atlanta banned the film under a statute that allowed its censor to prohibit any film that might \\"adversely affect the peace, morals, and good order of the city\\". Memphis did so as well, with the head of the Board of Censors saying: \\"We don't take that kind of picture here.\\" Walter White, executive director of the NAACP, reported his reaction to viewing a rough cut of the film: \\"One thing is certain–Hollywood can never go back to its old portrayal of colored people as witless menials or idiotic buffoons now that Home of the Brave and Lost Boundaries have been made ...\\" The Washington Post countered attempts on the part of some in the South to deny that the film represented an actual social phenomenon by calling it \\"real life drama\\" and \\"no novel\\" that presented \\"the stark truth, names, places and all\\". In The New York Times, critic Bosley Crowther said it had \\"extraordinary courage, understanding and dramatic power.\\" Ferrer later said: \\"This was a very, very radical departure from any kind of fiction film anybody was making in the country. It was a picture which broke a tremendous number of shibboleths, and it established a new freedom in making films.\\" In 1986, Walter Goodman located Lost Boundaries within the Hollywood film industry's treatment of minorities: ReferencesExternal links  *Louis de Rochemont -- The Making of Lost Boundaries *Louis de Rochemont -- Lost Boundaries *Photo: Ferrer, Hylton, and Pearson, \\"Clips from three dramas arriving on Broadway this week\\", New York Times, June 26, 1949 Category:1949 films Category:American films Category:American biographical drama films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Film Classics films Category:Films about race and ethnicity Category:Films based on biographies Category:Films directed by Alfred L.

Lebel was born in Roberval, Quebec. Lebel was elected to the House of Commons of Canada on September 17, 2007, in the Roberval—Lac-Saint-Jean by- election, as a member of the Conservative Party. Four years later, it emerged that he had been an active member of the Bloc Quebecois from 1993 to 2001. Lebel stated that he joined the Conservatives because Prime Minister Stephen Harper recognized the Québécois nation, and maintains that he has always been a Quebec nationalist. On October 30, 2008, he was appointed to Harper's cabinet as minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec. Following the 2011 election, Lebel was promoted to minister of transport. He was shuffled out of the post in July 2013, shortly after the Lac-Megantic rail disaster. He was also the minister of infrastructure, communities and intergovernmental affairs and served as the Harper government's Quebec lieutenant. In the 2015 election, Lebel was re-elected in the new Lac-Saint-Jean riding. After the election, he and fellow member of Parliament (MP) Michelle Rempel proposed to become joint interim leaders of the party but ultimately lost to Rona Ambrose. On November 18, 2015 he was named deputy leader of the Conservative Party and thus deputy Opposition leader. Lebel announced on June 19, 2017 that he will be stepping down as an MP in the following weeks, before the House of Commons resumed sitting in the fall. The Montreal Gazette reported on June 20, 2017 that Lebel is to be appointed as the CEO of Québec Forest Industry Council. It has also been reported that then-premier of Quebec, Philippe Couillard was interested in recruiting Lebel to run for the Quebec Liberals in the 2018 Quebec general election, but he did not run.

The first ship to be named Humming Bird by the Navy was a wooden dragger, built as Whaling City in 1936 by Morse Shipyard, Thomaston, Maine; acquired by purchase 30 October 1940 from her owner, William Hayes of New Bedford, Massachusetts; converted to Navy use at Geo. Lawley & Son, Neponset, Massachusetts, and placed in service 12 June 1941. Humming Bird operated throughout the war as a minesweeper and minesweeping training vessel, largely in the vicinity of Mine Warfare Training School, Yorktown, Virginia.

(eds.) (2007). Flora Fanerogâmica do Estado de São Paulo 5: 1-476. Instituto de Botânica, São Paulo. It was first described by John Sims, and got its current name by John Lindley.da Costa, A.F. & Wendt, T. (2007). Bromeliaceae na região de Macaé de Cima, Nova Friburgo, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil. Rodriguésia; Revista do Instituto de Biologia Vegetal, Jardim Botânico e Estaçao Biologica do Itatiaya 58: 905-939. Description Billbergia pyramidalis var. concolor in cultivation. A perennial, clump-forming stemless bromeliad plant, it is adaptable, growing well as a terrestrial or epiphytic plant. When on the ground, plants quickly create large clumps, and when planted at the base of a tree, they will slowly climb the trunk. The strap-like, green-coloured, overlaying, leathery leaves are arranged in jar-shaped basal rosettes, with a central cup that keeps water, organic debris and insects, thus providing extra nutrients to be absorbed by the plant.Acevedo-Rodríguez, P. & Strong, M.T. (2012). Catalogue of seed plants of the West Indies. Smithsonian Contributions to Botany 98: 1-1192. The thick, red or pink brush-shaped flowers on an individual plant last less than one month, but nearly all plants will come into bloom at the same time in the late summer or early autumn. In some latitudes, they bloom more frequently. The scarlet-coloured, erect, pyramidal flowers are laid in thistle-like inflorescences, which are made up of red, tube-shaped flowers with violet or yellow highlights.Martinelli, G., Magalhães Vieira, C., Gonzalez, M., Leitman, P., Piratininga, A.

Rodriguésia; Revista do Instituto de Biologia Vegetal, Jardim Botânico e Estaçao Biologica do Itatiaya 59: 209-258. Cultivation Requiring minimal care, the plant is used as groundcover in partial shade and in a protected position. It is drought and frost sensitive. Being epiphytic, these plants can also be grown in the branching of trees or on tree ferns. A slow-release fertiliser may be applied on the base of the plants in spring. Propagation is done by dividing off the immature parts of the plants in spring or autumn. This plant tolerates between USDA zones 10a to 12a and may not withstand temperatures below -1.1ºC.Billbergia pyramidalis Range The species is found in moist humus rich soils or in composted leaf mould on the ground in humid areas, and as well as on rocks under shady forest trees, in countries such as, Cuba, Venezuela, Brazil, French Guiana, the Lesser Antilles and Cuba. It is reportedly naturalised in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and on the Island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families Cultivars *Billbergia pyramidalis var. bicolor Lindl. *Billbergia pyramidalis var. concolor L.B.Sm. *Billbergia pyramidalis var. croyana E.Morren *Billbergia pyramidalis var. farinosa E.Morren *Billbergia pyramidalis var. lutea Leme & W.
