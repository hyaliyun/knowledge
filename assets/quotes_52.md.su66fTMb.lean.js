Lists of these kinds exist in many different cultures and times. They are sometimes given names – for example, the Hindu Yamas.  Examples = Bertrand Russell (1951)  Bertrand Russell was a British philosopher, logician, mathematician, historian, writer, social critic, political activist, and Nobel laureate. He formulated these ten commandments: > # Do not feel absolutely certain of anything. # Do not think it worthwhile > to proceed by concealing evidence, for the evidence is sure to come to > light. # Never try to discourage thinking for you are sure to succeed. # > When you meet with opposition, even if it should be from your husband or > your children, endeavour to overcome it by argument and not by authority, > for a victory dependent upon authority is unreal and illusory. # Have no > respect for the authority of others, for there are always contrary > authorities to be found. # Do not use power to suppress opinions you think > pernicious, for if you do the opinions will suppress you. # Do not fear to > be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric. > # Find more pleasure in intelligent dissent than in passive agreement, for, > if you value intelligence as you should, the former implies a deeper > agreement than the latter. # Be scrupulously truthful, even if the truth is > inconvenient, for it is more inconvenient when you try to conceal it. # Do > not feel envious of the happiness of those who live in a fool's paradise, > for only a fool will think that it is happiness. Anton LaVey (1967) Anton Lavey was an American author, musician, and occultist. He was the founder of the Church of Satan and LaVeyan Satanism and published \\"The Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth\\": > # Do not give opinions or advice unless you are asked. # Do not tell your > troubles to others unless you are sure they want to hear them. # When in > another's home, show them respect or else do not go there. # If a guest in > your home annoys you, treat him cruelly and without mercy. # Do not make > sexual advances unless you are given the mating signal. # Do not take that > which does not belong to you unless it is a burden to the other person and > they cry out to be relieved. # Acknowledge the power of magic if you have > employed it successfully to obtain your desires. # Do not complain about > anything to which you need not subject yourself. # Do not harm little > children. # Do not kill non-human animals unless you are attacked or for > your food. # When walking in open territory, bother no one. If someone > bothers you, ask them to stop. If they do not stop, destroy them.  Summum (1975)  Summum is an informal gathering of people registered as a tax exempt organization in the state of Utah, U.S., in 1975. Summum contradicts the historical Biblical account of the Ten Commandments by claiming that, before returning with the Commandments, Moses descended from Mount Sinai with a first set of tablets inscribed with seven principles they call aphorisms. According to the group, the seven principles are: > # SUMMUM is MIND, thought; the universe is a mental creation. # As above, so > below; as below, so above. # Nothing rests; everything moves; everything > vibrates. # Everything is dual; everything has an opposing point; everything > has its pair of opposites; like and unlike are the same; opposites are > identical in nature, but different in degree; extremes bond; all truths are > but partial truths; all paradoxes may be reconciled. # Everything flows out > and in; everything has its season; all things rise and fall; the pendulum > swing expresses itself in everything; the measure of the swing to the right > is the measure of the swing to the left; rhythm compensates. # Every cause > has its effect; every effect has its cause; everything happens according to > Law; Chance is just a name for Law not recognized; there are many fields of > causation, but nothing escapes the Law of Destiny. # Gender is in > everything; everything has its masculine and feminine principles; Gender > manifests on all levels. George Carlin (2004) George Carlin was an American stand-up comedian, social critic, actor and author. In his twelfth HBO stand-up comedy special Complaints and Grievances, Carlin reduces the Ten Commandments to three:http://apatheticagnostic.com/articles/reflections/ref01/ref014d06.html > # Thou shalt always be honest and faithful, especially to the provider of > thy nookie. # Thou shalt try real hard not to kill anyone - unless, of > course, they pray to a different, invisible man in the sky. # Thou shalt > keep thy religion to thyself.  Ten Offers of Evolutionary Humanism (2005)  In his 2005 book Manifesto of Evolutionary Humanism German philosopher Michael Schmidt-Salomon devised \\"The Ten Offers of Evolutionary Humanism\\". In short, they read as follows:Michael Schmidt-Salomon. 2005. Manifesto of Evolutionary Humanism, Aschaffenburg: Alibri Verlag, p.136-139. > # Serve neither foreign nor familiar \\"gods\\" but rather the great ideal of > ethics to lessen the suffering in the world.

Richard Dawkins (2006)  Richard Dawkins is an English ethologist, evolutionary biologist, and author. These are the alternative to the Ten Commandments, cited by Dawkins in his book The God Delusion: > #Do not do to others what you would not want them to do to you. # In all > things, strive to cause no harm. # Treat your fellow human beings, your > fellow living things, and the world in general with love, honesty, > faithfulness and respect. # Do not overlook evil or shrink from > administering justice, but always be ready to forgive wrongdoing freely > admitted and honestly regretted. # Live life with a sense of joy and wonder. > # Always seek to be learning something new. # Test all things; always check > your ideas against the facts, and be ready to discard even a cherished > belief if it does not conform to them. # Never seek to censor or cut > yourself off from dissent; always respect the right of others to disagree > with you. # Form independent opinions on the basis of your own reason and > experience; do not allow yourself to be led blindly by others. # Question > everything. Dawkins uses these proposed commandments to make a larger point that \\"it is the sort of list that any ordinary, decent person today would come up with\\". He then adds four more of his own devising: > * Enjoy your own sex life (so long as it damages nobody else) and leave > others to enjoy theirs in private whatever their inclinations, which are > none of your business. * Do not discriminate or oppress on the basis of sex, > race or (as far as possible) species. * Do not indoctrinate your children. > Teach them how to think for themselves, how to evaluate evidence, and how to > disagree with you. * Value the future on a timescale longer than your own.  Christopher Hitchens (2010)  Christopher Hitchens was an English American author, columnist, essayist, orator, religious and literary critic, social critic, and journalist. His new Ten Commandments are:Hitchens, Christopher, \\"The New Commandments\\", Vanity Fair, April 2010 > # Do not condemn people on the basis of their ethnicity or their color. # Do > not ever even think of using people as private property, or as owned, or as > slaves. # Despise those who use violence or the threat of it in sexual > relations. # Hide your face and weep if you dare to harm a child. # Do not > condemn people for their inborn nature — why would God create so many > homosexuals only in order to torture and destroy them? # Be aware that you, > too, are an animal, and dependent on the web of nature.

And terrible sexual repressions. # Be willing > to renounce any god or any faith if any holy commandments should contradict > any of the above. ::* In short: Don't swallow your moral code in tablet > form.  Bayer and Figdor's Ten Non-Commandments (2014)  As detailed in the book Atheist Mind, Humanist Heart: Re-writing the Ten Commandments for the Twenty- first Century by Lex Bayer and the Stanford Humanist Chaplain John Figdor, it is devoted to the subject of creating a secular alternative to the Ten Commandments and encouraging readers to formulate and discover their own list of beliefs. > # The world is real, and our desire to understand the world is the basis for > belief. # We can perceive the world only through our human senses. # We use > rational thought and language as tools for understanding the world. # All > truth is proportional to the evidence. # There is no God. # We all strive to > live a happy life. We pursue things that make us happy and avoid things that > do not. # There is no universal moral truth.

The Atheists' New Ten Commandments (2015)  These are the ten winning beliefs of the Rethink Prize, a crowdsourcing competition to rethink the Ten Commandments. The contest drew more than 2,800 submissions from 18 countries and 27 U.S. states. Winners were selected by a panel of judges. > # Be open-minded and be willing to alter your beliefs with new evidence. # > Strive to understand what is most likely to be true, not to believe what you > wish to be true. # The scientific method is the most reliable way of > understanding the natural world. # Every person has the right to control of > their body. # God is not necessary to be a good person or to live a full and > meaningful life. # Be mindful of the consequences of all your actions and > recognize that you must take responsibility for them. # Treat others as you > would want them to treat you, and can reasonably expect them to want to be > treated.

Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park is an industrial symbiosis network located in Kalundborg, Denmark, in which companies in the region collaborate to use each other's by-products and otherwise share resources. The Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park is the first full realization of industrial symbiosis. The collaboration and its environmental implications arose unintentionally through private initiatives, as opposed to government planning, making it a model for private planning of eco-industrial parks. At the center of the exchange network is the Asnæs Power Station, a 1500MW coal-fired power plant, which has material and energy links with the community and several other companies. Surplus heat from this power plant is used to heat 3500 local homes in addition to a nearby fish farm, whose sludge is then sold as a fertilizer. Steam from the power plant is sold to Novo Nordisk, a pharmaceutical and enzyme manufacturer, in addition to Statoil oil refinery. This reuse of heat reduces the amount thermal pollution discharged to a nearby fjord. Additionally, a by-product from the power plant's sulfur dioxide scrubber contains gypsum, which is sold to a wallboard manufacturer. Almost all of the manufacturer's gypsum needs are met this way, which reduces the amount of open-pit mining needed. Furthermore, fly ash and clinker from the power plant is used for road building and cement production. These exchanges of waste, water and materials have greatly increased environmental and economic efficiency, as well as created other less tangible benefits for these actors, including sharing of personnel, equipment, and information. History The Kalundborg Industrial Park was not originally planned for industrial symbiosis. Its current state of waste heat and materials sharing developed over a period of 20 years. Early sharing at Kalundborg tended to involve the sale of waste products without significant pretreatment. Each further link in the system was negotiated as an independent business deal, and was established only if it was expected to be economically beneficial. The park began in 1959 with the start up of the Asnæs Power Station. The first episode of sharing between two entities was in 1972 when Gyproc, a plaster-board manufacturing plant, established a pipeline to supply gas from Tidewater Oil Company. In 1981 the Kalundborg municipality completed a district heating distribution network within the city of Kalundborg, which utilized waste heat from the power plant.National Research Council (1998). The Ecology of Industry: Sector and Linkages. Washington DC: The National Academies Press. Print. Since then, the facilities in Kalundborg have been expanding, and have been sharing a variety of materials and waste products, some for the purpose of industrial symbiosis and some out of necessity, for example, freshwater scarcity in the area has led to water reuse schemes. In particular, 700,000 cubic meters per year of cooling water is piped from Statoil to Asnaes per year. A timeline of the creation of the industrial park: * 1959 The Asnæs Power Station was started up * 1961 Tidewater Oil Company constructed a pipeline from Lake Tissø to provide water for its operation * 1963 Tidewater Oil Company's oil refinery is taken over by Esso * 1972 Gyproc establishes plaster-board manufacturing plant. A pipeline from the refinery to the Gyproc facility is constructed to supply excess refinery gas * 1973 The Asnæs Power Station is expanded. A connection is built to the Lake Tissø- Statoil pipeline * 1976 Novo Nordisk starts delivering biological sludge to neighboring farms * 1979 Asnæs Power Station starts supplying fly ash to cement manufacturers in northern Denmark * 1981 the Kalundborg municipality completes a district heating distribution network within the city that utilizes waste heat from the power plant * 1982 Novo Nordisk and the Statoil refinery complete construction of steam supply pipelines from the power plant. By purchasing process steam from the power plant, the companies are able to shut down inefficient steam boilers * 1987 The Statoil refinery completes a pipeline to supply its effluent cooling water to the power plant for use as raw boiler feed water. * 1989 The power plant starts using waste heat from its salt cooling water to produce trout and turbot at its local fish farm * 1989 Novo Nordisk enters into agreement with Kalundborg municipality, the power plant, and the refinery to connect to the water supply grid from Lake Tissø * 1990 The Statoil refinery completes construction of a sulphur recovery plant. The recovered sulphur is sold as raw material to a sulfuric acid manufacturer in Fredericia * 1991 The Statoil refinery commissions the building of a pipeline to supply biologically treated refinery effluent water to the power plant for cleaning purposes, and for fly ash stabilization * 1992 The Statoil refinery commissions the building of a pipeline to supply flare gas to the power plant as a supplementary fuel * 1993 The power plant completes a stack flue gas desulfurization project. The resulting calcium sulphate is sold to Gyproc, where it replaces imported natural gypsum  The Symbiosis  The relationships among the firms comprising the Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park form an industrial symbiosis. Generally speaking, the actors involved in the symbiosis at Kalundborg exchange material wastes, energy, water, and information. The Kalundborg network involves a number of actors, including a power station, two big energy firms, a plaster board company, and a soil remediation company. Other actors include farmers, recycling facilities, and fish factories that use some of the material flows. Kalundborg Municipality plays an active role. Additionally, other actors, such as Novoren, a recycling and urban land field firm, are formally part of the network but do not contribute tangibly in the exchange. A researcher studying the evolution of the Kalundborg Symbiosis concluded that a high level of trust between the actors involved represented an essential element to collaborative success.  Partners  A flowchart to show the material sharing between entities in the Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park The Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park today includes nine private and public enterprises, some of which are some of the largest enterprises in Denmark. The enterprises are: * Novo Nordisk - Danish company and largest producer of insulin in the world * Novozymes - Danish company and largest enzyme producer in the world * Gyproc - French producer of gypsum board * Kalundborg Municipality * Ørsted A/S - owner of Asnaes Power Station, the largest power plant in Denmark * RGS 90 - Danish soil remediation and recovery company * Statoil - Norwegian company which owns Denmark's largest oil refinery * Kara/Novoren - Danish waste treatment company * Kalundborg Forsyning A/S - water and heat supplier, as well as waste disposer, for Kalundborg citizens  Material Exchanges  This matrix shows which actors in the Kalundborg Eco-Industrial Park interact with each other. There are currently over thirty exchanges of materials among the actors of Kalundborg. The Asnaes Power Station is at the heart of the network. The power company gives its steam residuals to the Statoil Refinery, meeting 40% of its steam requirements, in exchange for waste gas from the refinery. The power plant creates electricity and steam from this gas. These products are sent to a fish farm and Novo Nordisk, who receive all of their required steam from Asnaes, and a heating system that supplies 3500 homes. These homeowners pay for the underground piping that supplies their heat, but receive the heat reliably and at a low price. Fly ash from Asnaes is sent to a cement company, and gypsum from its desulfurization process is sent to Gyproc for use in gypsum board. Two-thirds of Gyproc's gypsum needs are met by Asnaes. Statoil Refinery removes sulfur from its natural gas and sells it to a sulfuric acid manufacturer, Kemira. The fish farm sells sludge from its ponds as fertilizer to nearby farms, and Novo Nordisk gives away its own sludge, of which it produces 3,000 cubic meters per day. The sludge is to be refined for biogas for the power plant. Water reuse schemes have also been developed within Kalundborg. Statoil pipes 700,000 cubic meters of cooling water per year to Asnaes, which purifies it and uses it as \\"boiler feed-water.\\" Asnaes also uses approximately 200,000 cubic meters of Statoil's treated wastewater per year for cleaning. The 90 °C residual heat from the refinery is not used for district heating due to taxes. Instead, heat pumps are used with the 24 °C waste water as a heat reservoir. Savings and Environmental Impacts Annual wastes avoided in Kalundborg as of 1997 Annual resource savings in Kalundborg as of 1997 Since its start over 25 years ago, Kalundborg has been operating successfully as an eco-industrial park. One of the main goals of industrial symbiosis is to make goods and services that use the least-cost combination of inputs. These relationships were formed on an economic and environmental basis.Desrochers, Pierre (2001). \\"Cities and Industrial Symbiosis: Some Historical Perspectives and Policy Implications.\\" Journal of Industrial Ecology 5.4 : 29-44. Print. As mentioned above, there are over thirty exchanges occurring in Kalundborg. While Kalundborg does operate using trades between various firms in the vicinity, it itself is not self-sufficient or contained to the industrial park. There are many trades that occur with companies outside of this park region. All of these exchanges have contributed to water savings, and savings in fuel and input chemicals. Wastes were also avoided through these interchanges. For example, in 1997, Asnaes (the power station) saved 30,000 tons of coal (~2% of throughput) by using Statoil (large oil refinery) fuel gas. And 200,000 tons of fly ash and clinker were avoided from Asnaes landfill. These resources savings and waste avoidances, documented before 1997, are illustrated in the tables to the right. A study in 2002 showed that these exchanges also contributed to more than 95% of the total water supply to the power plant. This is up from 70% in 1990. So, the system is becoming more comprehensive in its ability to save groundwater, however, there is still room for improvement. Out of the 1.2 million m3 of wastewater discharged from Statoil (the refinery), only 9000 m3 were reused at the power plant.Jacobsen, Noel Brings (2006). \\"Industrial Symbiosis in Kalundborg, Denmark: A Quantitative Assessment of Economic and Environmental Aspects.\\" Journal of Industrial Ecology 10.1-2: 239-55. Print. More recent numbers show a vast improvement, when comparing to the numbers from 1997, in resource savings. Data from around 2004 show annual savings of 2.9 million cubic meters of ground water, and 1 million cubic meters of surface water. Gypsum savings are estimated around 170,000 tons, and sulfur dioxide waste avoidance is estimated around 53 Tn. These numbers are mostly estimations. Aspects of the eco-industrial park have changed, and there are many levels to consider when doing these calculations. All together though, these interchanges have shown annual savings of up to $15 million (US), with investments around $78.5 million (US). The total accumulated savings is estimated around $310 million (US). As a Model Kalundborg was the first example of separate industries grouping together to gain competitive advantage by material exchange, energy exchange, information exchange, and/or product exchange. The very term, Industrial Symbiosis (IS) was first defined by a station manager in Kalundborg as \\"a cooperation between different industries by which the presence of each…increases the viability of the others, and by which the demands of society for resource savings and environmental protection are considered\\" .Chertow, Marian R (2007). \\"\\"Uncovering\\" Industrial Symbiosis.\\" Journal of Industrial Ecology 11.1: 11-30. Print. Kalundborg's success helped generate interest in industrial symbiosis. Developed nations such as the United States began to formulate incentives for corporations to implement materials exchange with other corporations. Industrial and political circles began to look into the implementation of eco-industrial parks (EIPs). Specifically, the United States worked to put into service several planned EIPs. The U.S President's Council on Sustainable Development in 1996 proposed fifteen eco-industrial parks to pursue the idea of industrial symbiosis. These parks were created by grouping diverse stakeholders with common material flows together, with added governmental incentives to encourage materials exchange. The goal of these planned EIPs was to test if the industrial symbiosis that worked so well in Kalundborg could be replicated. The Council on Sustainable Development also defined 5 major characteristics of a successful EIP to help guide EIP development. These characteristics include: (1) some form of material exchange between multiple separate entities, (2) industries in close proximity to each other, (3) cooperation between plant management of the different corporations, (4) an existing infrastructure for material sharing that does not require much retooling, and (5) \\"anchor\\" tenants (large corporation with resources to support early implementation). Devens Regional Enterprise Zone is a good example of a successful EIP in the United States.Lowitt, Peter C (2008). \\"Devens Redevelopment: Emergence of a Successful Eco-Industrial Park in the United States.\\" Journal of Industrial Ecology 12.4: 497-500. Print. Kalundborg became an attractive topic in academia as well because of the obvious sustainability advantages of industrial symbiosis. Research conducted on planning and implementation of eco-industrial parks revealed interesting results. Experts argued over the idea of \\"planned parks\\" versus \\"self organized parks\\". Research showed systematic failure of forced or planned EIPs. Most successful EIPs originate from industrial symbiosis that occurs naturally during industry life, much like the Kalundborg case. This conclusion served to deflate the momentum that the success of Kalundborg generated. Organizations began to recognize the difficulties associated with forcing eco- industrial parks to coalesce and abandoned the idea.

The dead are mostly from the samurai class, but the names of priests and artisans have also been found.Kawano (2005: 173) These tombs are extremely numerous in the hills surrounding Kamakura, and estimates of their number range from 1,500 to over 5,000. The total number will remain unknown, as many have been destroyed and others may not yet have been found. Yagura can be found either isolated, as in the case of the Harakiri Yagura, or in clusters of almost 200 caves.A Guide to Kamakura, Terminology Groups of yagura are labeled with the suffix . The most conveniently seen yagura for most tourists are those at Jufuku-ji, near Kamakura station. Its cemetery has many yagura, including those with the cenotaphs of Hōjō Masako and Minamoto no Sanetomo. True yagura can be found also in the Miura Peninsula, in the Izu Peninsula, and as far away as Awa Province (Chiba).  History  There is a lack of solid documentary or archeological evidence regarding exactly when or why the yagura system was adopted. It is generally believed that tombs were dug into the soft rock of the hills around the city because of lack of space in the valley below.Kusumoto (2002: 148–149) The only way to date a yagura is through the dates carved on a gorintō or stele that it may contain.Kawano (2005: 172) On this basis, the oldest was found near the Asahina Pass and dated to between 1260 and 1270. It was previously thought that an ambiguously titled law that forbade cemeteries in towns (the ) referred to Kamakura, and therefore was the origin of the custom. It is now believed that the law was promulgated for the city of Fuchu, in Bungo Province of Kyushu, by the Ōtomo clan. However, some historians think the Ōtomo must have used a Kamakura shogunate law as a model. The custom continued after the demise of the shogunate and well into the Ashikaga period, until the middle of the 15th century, after which it declined. The yagura of the time give some indication of the decline of the custom: some have been converted to storehouses, others served as a convenient grave for inhumation, and thus were filled.  Structure of a yagura  GorintōA yagura is usually just a hole dug into the side of a hill and begins with a short corridor called leading to the crypt, called . The crypt is usually one to five meters wide and roughly rectangular. In many cases the mouth of the sendō was sealed by a wooden door (), the remains of which can sometimes still be seen. In some cases, cremated bones were interred in an opening in the floor, but in other tombs there is instead urn. In either case, yagura floors are part of the bedrock, so are not suitable for burials.Kawano (2005: 168-170) Fragments of cremated bone can occasionally be found. Inside a yagura, the grave is often marked by a stone gorintō, hōkyōintō (Buddhist tower), or other stone monument. These are normally later additions. Other Buddhist imagery, such as statues of Jizō are commonly found, as in most Japanese cemeteries. Red painted rafters are visible on the ceiling of the .  Etymology and written form  As with many other aspects of yagura and their history, the etymology of the name is unclear. According to one hypothesis, the name derives from , or watchtower, but it seems more likely that it is just a local corruption of , that is, a stone storehouse.Kawano (2005: 167) The word yagura over the centuries has been written in several ways, among them . The term is now usually written only in hiragana.  Notable yagura  The largest known yagura in Kamakura at Meigetsu-in. Still visible are some human figures on the walls. These are some notable yagura in Kamakura: * Otō no Kubo - One of the yagura supposed to be Hōjō Takatoki's grave. * Karaito Yagura - Close to the Shakadō Pass. Due to the remains of a wooden door which are still visible today, legend says it was a prison. * Jitsugetsu Yagura - Also close to the Shakadō Pass. The name comes from the two openings in the wall shaped like the sun and the moon. * Kubi Yagura - Behind Zuisen-ji, this is another supposed grave of Hōjō Takatoki. * Shakadō Yagura Group - This is supposed by tradition to be the burial place of those who died at Tōshō-ji at the fall of the Kamakura shogunate in 1333.Kamiya Vol. 1 (2006/08: 71–72) It has been partly destroyed by urban development. * Shutarugi Yagura - In the mountains near Nishi Mikado. * Harakiri Yagura - Near the ruins of Tōshō-ji in Komachi 3-chōme. This is supposed to be the place where Hōjō Takatoki killed himself at the fall of the shogunate. * Tahō-ji-ato Yagura - In the woods near Ōgigayatsu. Nearby there's a huge gorintō called . * - At the bottom of the Urigayatsu Valley. * - In the Higashi Sensui valley. * Hyakuhachi Yagura - Located near Kakuon-ji, it contains 177 yagura. It contains all known types of yagura. * Jushi Yagura - In the Nishi Urigayatsu Valley. Contains the reliefs of 14 gorintō. * Mandaladō Group - Kamakura period yagura group located to the north of the Nagoe Pass and containing 104 graves.Nihon Rekishi Chimei Taikei - Mandaladō It used to be called but started to be called to distinguish it from the Sarubatake Yagura behind Hosshō-ji. The name indicates that in the area there used to be a temple dedicated to memorial services for the dead (a kuyōdo). Divided in three groups, it is built in a flat area carved up from an artificial cliff built to defend the Nagoe Pass. It contains both Kamakura and Muromachi period graves.

He wrote in Persian and Turkish. Due to his excellent command of Persian, Gulshani was known to his Turkish contemporaries as Acem-i Küçük. He was also known by the Turks as Acem Fethioglu, Muhyi Celebi and Dervish Muhyi. In addition to his literary output, Gulshani was the inventor of Balibilen, a constructed language. Biography Gulshani was born in Adrianople (modern Edirne) to a family originally from Shiraz and Qazvin in Iran, at a time when these cities were ruled by the Ak Koyunlu. Muhyi's grandfather, Abu Talib, lived in Iran during the reign of Uzun Hasan (1453–1478) and was killed during the conquest of the Ak Koyunlu realm by Shah Ismail I (1501–1524). As a result of the political upheaval created by the rise of the Safavids, Abu Talib's son, Fath-Allah (Fethullah Effendi), moved to the Ottoman realm, and settled in Adrianople. He married in Adrianople and joined a scholarly and Sufi social netwerk that encompassed the cities of Adrianople, Cairo and Constantinople (modern Istanbul). Muhyi attended the Üçşerefeli and Bayezid madrasas in Adrianople. In 1546, he moved to Constantinople to complete his education at the Sahn-i Seman madrasa. There, he attended lectures of contemporaneous scholars such as Ebussuud Efendi and Gelibolulu Süruri (died 1562). In 1552 he moved to Cairo in order to join his brother Muhammad (Mehmed) who served in the local Ottoman bureaucracy of Egypt. Gulshani became deputy judge in Egypt, and became a student of Ahmad Kayali (Ahmed-i Hayali; died 1569/70), son and successor of Shaykh Ibrahim Gulshani (founder of the Gulshani order). He stayed in Egypt until his death and functioned as custodian (turbedar) of the main Gulshani order hospice in Cairo. In the Ottoman Empire, Gulshani's family were known as the Etmekçizadeler. Muhyi Gulshani married the daughter of Shaykh Ibrahim Gulshani. Literary output Though Gulshani claimed to have written a hundred works, only 43 are extant. His Persian works include Ketab-e ma'ab and Ketab-e haqq al-yaqin. He wrote a divan mostly containing poems in Persian, but also include some in Turkish. His Alfiya-ye Muhyi, consists of a collection of ghazals in Persian and Turkish. His Masader-e alsena-ye arba'a is a quadrillingual dictionary, in which Persian functions as the base, and equivalents to words are provided in Turkish, Arabic and Balibilen (the artificial language he created himself). Of Gulshani's extant works, 34 are in Turkish, including the Loghat va qawa'ed-e Balibilen, the Manaqeb-e Ibrahim Gulshani, and the Nafahat al-ashar.

Rajah was the first, although unofficial, police dog in New Zealand and was nominated as a replacement for Rin Tin Tin during his time in Methven. Rajah amassed fame throughout the country for his acting performances and locating work performed with the New Zealand Police, in multiple locations throughout the South Island, New Zealand. History Rajah was owned by Constable John Robertson, who was the only serving police officer in the town of Methven at the time. Rajah assisted Robertson in his duties unofficially and while he was not officially designated the position, Rajah was technically the first police dog in New Zealand. Rajah was trained by Robertson and his son, Ian \\"Robbie\\", using a search-and-find method. This made the dog very perceptive at finding concealed objects and assisted the dog greatly in its future work. Working life Rajah's work mostly consisted of finding weapons and other notable items, and he was also infrequently used to locate remains. During his time in service, Rajah only failed once in finding his objective - the body of a woman believed by police to have been the victim of foul play and dumped along the railway line that was still under construction at the time. However, it was revealed a few years later that the body he was looking for had been embedded inside a concrete pillar. When Rin Tin Tin died in 1932, a representative from the now defunct Fox Film Corporation proposed that Rajah be used as his replacement. The family ultimately declined the offer, citing that it was too big a move and instead chose to put Rajah to work doing performances around New Zealand, including in Christchurch and Timaru. Rajah was also able to continue working as a police dog. Memorial In 2008, the Ashburton District council donated money to assist with a fund proposed for a monument in Rajah's honour be erected in front of the Methven Police station or at the Mt Hutt Memorial hall. The proposal was met with positive community response, and a bronze statue of Rajah was unveiled on the February 8th, 2015, outside the Mt Hutt Function Centre.https://methvenheritagecentre.co.nz/heritage/ References Category:Dog actors Category:German shepherds Category:Individual animals in New Zealand Category:Police dog ","title":"Rajah (dog)"},{"id":"18654189","text":"Tivetshall St Margaret is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Tivetshall, in the South Norfolk district, in the county of Norfolk, England.

Organization  The 27th Connecticut Infantry Regiment was raised in the late summer of 1862 in response to President Abraham Lincoln's nationwide call for volunteers to put down the rebellion. The regiment would serve for a nine-month enlistment, unlike the usual three-year enlistments, inducing many older, married men to answer the call. This is evident by the fact that the average age of the 27th Connecticut was 27 years, about six years older than the average age of Union soldiers in general. The 27th Connecticut departed for Washington, D.C., on October 22 and was attached to the Military District of Washington until November 7, 1862. It was then attached to the 3rd Brigade, 1st Division, 2nd Army Corps, Army of the Potomac, and it advanced to Falmouth, Virginia.  War history  In its nine months of service, the 27th fought in the three largest campaigns in the eastern theatre of the war. First at the Battle of Fredericksburg, on December 13, 1862, during which they launched an attack up Marye's Heights under their brigade commander Col. Samuel K. Zook. Their second taste of combat was the Battle of Chancellorsville, on May 1, 2 and 3, 1863. On May 3, eight out of 10 companies making up the 27th were captured after fighting a fierce delaying action holding back Confederate forces so the Union Army could reorganize itself and hold off the confederates. Finally, the 27th Connecticut embarked on their last campaign of their nine-month service which culminated with the campaign and Battle of Gettysburg, on July 1, 2 and 3, 1863. Here, in the late afternoon of July 2, the 27th entered the battle with a total of 3 companies only 160 men out of the original 829 who had joined just nine months earlier. They occupied the portion of the union line known as \\"The Wheatfield,\\" where the regiment successfully held back the rebels. By the end of the battle, 10 men were dead, 23 wounded, and 4 were missing. Among the regiment's casualties was Regimental Commander Lt. Col. Henry C. Merwin, who was struck by a bullet. After his death, Maj. James H. Colburn took command of the regiment for the rest of its service. On July 18, 1863, what remained of the 27th was released from the Army of the Potomac and sent back to New Haven to be discharged. On the way home to Connecticut, they were reunited with 279 men who were captured at Chancellorsville, and had been paroled by the Confederates in a prisoner exchange.  Casualties  In its nine months of service, the Regiment lost 533 men who were killed, wounded, captured, and died of disease out of 829 enrolled.

The AC impedance of the cell-covered electrode is then measured at one or several frequencies as a function of time. Due to the insulating properties of their membranes the cells behave like dielectric particles so that the impedance increases with increasing coverage of the electrode until a confluent (i.e. continuous) layer of cells is established. In confluent cell layers the measured impedance is mainly determined by the three-dimensional shape of the cells. If cell shape changes occur, the current pathways through and around the cell bodies change as well, leading to a corresponding increase or decrease of impedance. Thus, by recording time- resolved impedance measurements, cell shape changes can be followed in real time with sub-microscopic resolution and can be used for bioanalytic purposes.Wegener, Zink, Roesen, Galla: Use of electrochemical impedance measurements to monitor b-adrenergic stimulation of bovine aortic endothelial cells.

History  The mall was sold for $17 million to Clearview Investments Ltd of Arlington, Texas in January 1998, who immediately announced plans to remodel the mall in order to attract new tenants. The mall was sold again in 2000 to Jaeger & Jaeger of Deerfield, Illinois; at this time, the mall was at 80% occupancy.

By late 2003, occupancy had slipped to 61%, and in January 2004 lenders GMAC Commercial Mortgage Corp and LaSalle National Bank moved to sue the owners, claiming the owners had defaulted on a $20 million loan, and demanded the mall be sold at sheriff's auction. The property was handed back to the lenders in February that year, who announced they were looking to sell the mall within the year. The mall was later acquired in December 2004 by American Realty Advisors, in a joint venture with the Tucker Development Corporation. Plans called to continue operating the site as an outlet mall in the near future, but to later redevelop the property into a 300,000 square foot community shopping center. By January 2006, demolition had commenced on northern portion of the mall, with the small number of remaining tenants condensed into the southern wing of the mall, on short term leases. By August, demolition of the mall had been finished, with construction of an Ashley HomeStore on the grounds already in progress. Also planned for the site were three 8,000 square foot commercial sites, a 121 room hotel on the site, and four additional lots left for future expansion.

At age 14, he dropped out of high school and joined a traveling carnival. He later joined a gang called the Manor Boys. He attempted to join the Marines but was rejected for hearing problems. Bartmann became an alcoholic by age 17, and one night fell down a flight of stairs while drunk. He became paralyzed and was told that he would never walk again. Against his doctor's wishes, Bartmann embarked on a nightly regimen of physical activity until he eventually regained the use of his legs. For several years Bartmann worked at the Dubuque Packing Company, a large local slaughterhouse. While there, Bartmann organized a wildcat strike to force the company to give benefits to part-time workers. The strike was successful. Around this time, Bartmann ran into a high school principal who earlier had expelled him from school. The principal challenged Bartmann to get his GED certificate, which he did. Bartmann later earned a BS from Loras College and a JD from Drake University. After passing the Iowa Bar Exam, Bartmann immediately went into private practice, specializing in consumer law. He also invested in real estate. Bartmann moved to Muskogee, OK to devote full-time to real estate investing. Bartmann was later asked by a local bank to take over a struggling oil equipment company in Oklahoma. He turned around the company and grew it substantially. It folded in 1985 due to falling oil prices, with Bartmann one million dollars in debt due to personally guaranteeing some of the corporate obligations.

He bought a portfolio of loans, financed by the bank he was $1 million in debt to. Bartmann succeeded in collecting enough money from that first portfolio to recoup the cost of the portfolio, plus make a partial repayment on his bank debt. That led to more purchases of loan portfolios that allowed Bartmann to repay the entire $1 million obligation. Bartmann created a consumer friendly company that would buy delinquent debts from banks and then attempt to restructure them according to terms the customer could afford. The strategy was successful, he was able to help 4.5 million consumers resolve $15 billion in debt, all of it without ever suing a consumer, producing net margins as high as 48%. But CFS didn't actually make any profit on collecting debt balances but from paying 5 cents on the dollar for consumer debt accounts that had been charged-off from banks. This enabled CFS to only have to collect 10 cents on each dollar of outstanding debt and double their initial investment. But the exorbitant profits of CFS came from securitizations collateralized by charge-off consumer debt. So profitable, that for every $100 million in collateralized securitizations, CFS immediately profited by $40 million. This did nothing to correct or improve a consumer's credit profile or score.\\"CFS History\\", FundingUniverse By 1997, Bartmann was listed in Forbes magazine as one of the 400 richest people in America. Inc. magazine estimated Bartmann's net worth to be in the range of $2.4 to $3.5 billion. Goldman Sachs offered to buy a 20% stake in the company and Norwest Bank offered to acquire, but Bartmann refused both offers. As the company grew, Bartmann gained a reputation for doing the unexpected. He challenged his staff that if they beat their performance goals, he would take them all to Las Vegas. They exceeded the target and Bartmann flew the entire company to Las Vegas. Bartmann arrived and wrestled Hulk Hogan at the Thomas & Mack Center in Vegas.\\" On another occasion, Bartmann leased 27 Boeing 747 Jumbo Jets to fly thousands of employees to Disney World for the weekend. CFS offered free on-site daycare that grew to 500 children, as well as free full health care and a 250% company match in its 401(k) program. BusinessWeek magazine called CFS \\"One of the top 10 family-oriented businesses in America\\" and Working Mother Magazine named it \\"One of the top 100 best companies for working mothers.\\" In 1998 the Harvard Business School published a case study on the methods Commercial Financial Services used to securitize non-performing debt.Kenneth A. Froot, Ivan Farman: \\"Commercial Financial Services, Inc.: Securitization of Charged-off Credit Card Receivables\\", Harvard Business School. Publication date: October 14, 1998. Prod. #: 299023-PDF-ENG The Smithsonian Institution's Museum of American History awarded CFS its Computer World award for technological innovations. Also in 1998, an investigation began after an anonymous letter raised questions about the propriety of certain transactions at the company by a rogue employee. Throughout the ensuing investigation, Bartmann maintained his innocence. Jay Jones, a shareholder of the company, later confessed to the questionable transactions and admitted that Bartmann did not know about them. Nevertheless, the U.S. Department of Justice persuaded a third grand jury to indict Bartmann and other senior executives. In the trial that followed, Bartmann was found to be not guilty of all charges.\\"Credit company co-founder acquitted\\", Kelly Kurt, Associated Press, December 4, 2003 One of Bartmann's co-defendants sued the government for malicious prosecution and won.http://i.imgur.com/TaPF5.png Even so, the controversy meant his company could not obtain financing and Commercial Financial Services declared bankruptcy. A bankruptcy trustee liquidated the company, laying off its 3900+ employees. In 2005, the bankruptcy trustee for Commercial Financial Services publicly declared that the company had not engaged in fraud. Bartmann was cleared of all wrongdoing.http://www.kiplinger.com/slideshow/spending/T025-S001-millionaires- who-lost-it-all-but-came-back/index.htmlhttp://imgur.com/mNA3H  Other activities  In 2002, the Governor appointed Bartmann to the board of Oklahoma Futures, a public-private partnership whose goal was to advise the governor, legislature, and judiciary on ways to promote economic development in Oklahoma. The Senate confirmed Bartmann's nomination. In 2003 Bartmann founded Bill Bartmann Enterprises in order to offer business training and information to entrepreneurs. In 2008 he noticed that the banking bailout and TARP subsidies presented an opportunity to buy defaulted debt from troubled banks, mirroring the situation he built Commercial Financial Services on in the 1980s and 1990s. Bartmann developed a series of training programs to enable individuals to buy portfolios of defaulted credit-card debt and then taught them how to collect without using litigation or other abusive behavior. In 2009 Bartmann published a book, \\"Bailout Riches\\", which describes the opportunity he says the bank-bailout and recession of 2008-2010 has created. The book became a #1 world-wide bestseller on Amazon, and also made it to the Wall Street Journal, USA Today and BusinessWeek bestseller lists. In 2010 Bill Bartmann Enterprises was named to the \\"Inc. 500\\" for 2009. It's the fifth time Bartmann has made the list.\\"Meet America's Fastest-Growing Private Companies and the Superstar Entrepreneurs Who Run Them.\\" Inc. Magazine. Publication date: Sept 2010.http://www.inc.com/magazine/20100901/how-bill-bartmann-lost- it-all-and-got-it-back.html  CFS2  Bartmann re-established his former consumer financial recovery company, naming the successor entity, CFS2, in July 2010. Later that year the company leased space at the CityPlex Towers complex in south Tulsa, returning Bartmann to the location where CFS had previously operated.\\"Bill Bartmann to return to CityPlex Towers\\", Tulsa World, November 30, 2010. Bartmann is in the midst of reviewing potential sites across the country for expansion, with Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio and Arkansas having offered incentives.\\"Southern Nevada competing for debt- collection company, 2,000 jobs\\", VegasInc, January 17, 2012.

An anomaly to the debt collection industry, CFS2 has pledged to never litigate in order to collect from their accounts and has encouraged others in his industry to follow his lead. This helping hand approach reduces the banks reputational risk while enabling CFS2 to collect at rates twice the industry average. In April 2013 CFS2 became the first and only collection company to ever win The American Consumer Council'shttp://www.americanconsumercouncil.org/ \\"Friend of the Consumer\\" award. In bestowing the award American Consumer Council CEO, Thomas Hinton, remarked \\"as a financial recovery company, CFS2 is offering valued services that millions of consumers desperately need as we emerge from one of the longest recessions in our nation's history.\\"http://www.cfstwo.com/wsj.htm In 2014 he won this award for the second time.http://www.docstoc.com/docs/168339309/CFS2%20-%202014%20Friend%20of%20the%20Consumer%20Award CFS2 has also won the Compass Award for Business Ethics;http://www.okethics.org/awards the Beacon Award for Community Involvementhttp://journalrecord.com/beacon-awards/2013/07/12/guiding-the-way- beacon-event-pays-tribute-to-philanthropic-leaders/ the “Stevie” Award for Customer Service, and has been named as one of the most admired CEO's in Oklahoma by the Oklahoma Journal Record.http://www.stevieawards.com/pubs/awards/403_2662_22383.cfmhttp://journalrecord.com/2014/02/05/most- admired-ceos-profile-bill-bartmann-cfs2-general-news/ In October 2013 CFS2 was featured on CBS Evening news as the debt collector who thrives using the unique strategy of kindness.  Industry reform efforts  In the 1990s Bartmann gained a reputation for collecting debts by avoiding strong-arm tactics. He is following the same consumer-advocate approach in his new company, CFS2. He says: \\"We’re going to go at it the same way we did before, treating people with respect and helping them out of bad situations.\\" A Bartmann-run website, StopTheseCriminals.com, urges consumers to sign a petition that calls for drastic legislative and regulatory reforms of the debt-collection industry. Among those recommended reforms are the barring of all collection efforts on debt that is older than the statute of limitations; allowing consumers to record telephone calls from collection agencies; and requiring the licensing of both agencies and individual collectors. Bartmann has persuaded 200 Debt Buying companies to take the “Bartmann Pledge’. The Bartmann Pledge requires all signors to agree not to use litigation against debtors; not to charge interest on the obligation, not to attempt to contact debtors more than twice in one day, not to pursue debtors beyond the statute of limitations and not to resell delinquent loans. Bartmann has worked with members of the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate to reform the current federal debt-collection rules. In addition he helped to enact a recent change to the Oklahoma debt-collection rules, which the Governor of Oklahoma signed into law in June 2011. Bartmann authored Oklahoma Senate bill 1430 “The Bartmann Bill” which would require debt collectors to follow stringent practices designed to protect consumers. This bill passed the Senate 40-2. In 2011 Bartmann was nominated to the Consumer Advisory Board of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) by the president of the American Bankers Association (ABA), Frank Keating. The nomination was seconded by six sitting state attorneys general. In October 2012, Bartmann was invited to the West Wing of the White House to meet with the Deputy Director of the National Economic Council and Senior Policy Advisers to discuss the creation of a moratorium on debt collection litigation that would reduce the national bankruptcy rate by as much as 50% while also reducing the national unemployment rate. Bartmann has worked extensively with Attorneys General across the United States to promote debt collection reforms and has testified as an expert witness at their request at numerous proceedings.http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110518005194/en/Industry- Insider-Testifies-to%C2%A0Massachusetts-Attorney-General-Martha Bartmann is a regular contributor to publications like The Huffington Post and The Christian Science Monitor.http://www.csmonitor.com/content/search?SearchText=%22Bill+Bartmann%22&SearchButton;=Search He authored Out of Control: Cases of Debt-Collection Abuse In America And What We Can Do About It, an expose´of the debt collection industry.

A stone picker (or rock picker) is an implement to sieve through the top layer of soil to separate and collect rocks and soil debris from good topsoil. It is usually tractor-pulled. A stone picker is similar in function to a rock windrower (rock rake); a stone picker generally digs to greater depths to remove stones and rocks. Stone pickers are used in farming and landscaping, where stones need to be removed from the soil and ground surface to prevent damage to other farm machinery (such as hay balers, combines, and mowers), improve the soil for crop production, or improve the appearance of the ground surface in preparation for a lawn or a golf course. Surface stones and large rocks often left from plowing can damage a hay bailer, the header or reciprocating knives on a combine, and blades on a rotary mower. Land with rock instead of fine soil are often less useful for crops. Thus, removing stones from the soil also ensures a more consistent yield. Additionally, using stone pickers is particularly useful for crops forming tubers (such as potatoes) in the ground. A stone picker has digging teeth, a conveyor system, a sieve or screen, and a stone bin. The digging teeth are at the leading edge of the stone picker and removes soil, which is placed on the conveyor system. If the sieve is not combined with the conveyor system, the conveyor system transports the stones and large rocks to a bin or hopper for periodic dumping. Some stone pickers use a large tractor, generally over 100 horsepower, equipped with hydraulics and power take-off driven mechanisms. PTO pump driven equipment can use 60 horsepower tractors. The tractor's hydraulics control the depth to which the stone picker digs to excavate soil material; whereas, the PTO controls the movement of the conveyor and picking system.

Plot In a cell under the Old Bailey, two men meet. One is Wilfred Morgenhall, an unmarried barrister who never gets any cases and is overjoyed to have won this dock brief, the defence of an accused individual with no lawyer (at public expense). The other is his client Herbert Fowle, an insignificant man who just wants to plead guilty to murdering his wife and get it all over. Flashbacks show that the wife was impossible to live with and Fowle, who avoided her as much as possible, hatched a plot to get rid of her by taking in a male lodger. The lodger found her amusing and attractive, until one day he went too far and Mrs Fowle threw him out of the house. In despair at his plot having failed, Fowle killed her. Morgenhall role plays various defences, in the process raising Fowle's will to fight. But when the case is called, he botches it and Fowle is found guilty. Morgenhall goes to visit him in prison, where he learns that Fowle has been reprieved because his defence was so poor. The two leave together, two lonely and inadequate men who have become friends.

A career soldier, he served in the Reichswehr and the Wehrmacht. He served as the last Chief of Staff of the Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH) during the final phase of the war (1 April to 1 May 1945). Krebs tried to open surrender negotiations with the Red Army; he committed suicide in the Führerbunker during the early hours of 2 May 1945. Early life and education Krebs was born in Helmstedt. He volunteered for service in the Imperial German Army in 1914, becoming an officer in 1915. Krebs spoke fluent Russian. Career In 1931, Krebs worked in the Defence Ministry, where he maintained contacts with the Red Army in the context of joint military exercises conducted by the two countries. Krebs held strong racist and anti- Communist views, as evidenced by his description of the members of the Soviet military delegation that visited Berlin in 1932: \\"a sly and cunning Jew,... [and] a Jewish half-breed ... insincere, with a suspicious and treacherous nature, apparently a fanatic Communist.\\" In 1936, Krebs was posted to the German embassy in Moscow as acting military attaché; he held this position up to the invasion of the Soviet Union. As such, he played a role in the Wehrmacht's faulty intelligence into the capabilities of the Red Army. World War II During World War II, Krebs reached the position of chief of staff of various army groups. While serving on the Eastern Front, Krebs was promoted to the rank of Generalmajor when Chief of Staff of the 9th Army in February 1942. In March 1943, he was made Chief of Staff of Army Group Centre. In April 1943, he was promoted to Generalleutnant and became a General of Infantry in August 1944. Krebs served as Chief of Staff of Army Group B on the Western Front from September 1944 until February 1945 when he was appointed Deputy Chief of the Army General Staff. Berlin, 1945 On 1 April 1945, Krebs was appointed Chief of the Army General Staff (OKH). Krebs was in the Führerbunker below the Reich Chancellery garden during the Battle of Berlin. On 28 April 1945, Krebs made his last telephone call from the Führerbunker. He called Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel at the new Supreme Command Headquarters in Fürstenberg. He told Keitel that, if relief did not arrive within 48 hours, all was lost. Keitel promised to exert the utmost pressure on General Walther Wenck, who commanded the German 12th Army, and General Theodor Busse, who commanded the German 9th Army. The 12th Army was attacking towards Berlin from the west and the 9th Army was attacking from the south. Adolf Hitler had ordered both of these armies to link up and come to the relief of Berlin. In addition, forces under General Rudolf Holste were to have attacked towards Berlin from the north. Later on 28 April, when it was discovered that Heinrich Himmler was trying to negotiate a backdoor surrender to the western Allies via Count Folke Bernadotte, Krebs became part of a military tribunal ordered by Hitler to court-martial Himmler's SS liaison officer Hermann Fegelein. Fegelein was by that time Eva Braun's brother-in-law. SS-General Wilhelm Mohnke presided over the tribunal which, in addition to Krebs and Mohnke, included SS-General Johann Rattenhuber and General Wilhelm Burgdorf. However, Fegelein was so drunk that he was crying, vomiting and unable to stand up; he even urinated on the floor. It was the opinion of the judges that he was in no condition to stand trial. Therefore, Mohnke closed the proceedings and turned Fegelein over to Rattenhuber and his security squad instead. On 29 April, Krebs, Burgdorf, Joseph Goebbels, and Martin Bormann witnessed and signed the last will and testament of Adolf Hitler. Hitler dictated the document to his personal private secretary, Traudl Junge. Bormann was head of the Party Chancellery (Parteikanzlei) and private secretary to Hitler. Late that evening, Krebs contacted General Alfred Jodl (Supreme Army Command) by radio and made the following demands: \\"Request immediate report. Firstly, of the whereabouts of Wenck's spearheads. Secondly, of time intended to attack. Thirdly, of the location of the 9th Army. Fourthly, of the precise place in which the 9th Army will break through. Fifthly, of the whereabouts of General Holste's spearhead.\\" In the early morning of 30 April, Jodl replied to Krebs: \\"Firstly, Wenck's spearhead bogged down south of Schwielow Lake. Secondly, 12th Army therefore unable to continue attack on Berlin. Thirdly, bulk of 9th Army surrounded. Fourthly, Holste's Corps on the defensive.\\" Later that afternoon, Hitler and Eva Braun committed suicide. Surrender and suicide On 1 May, after Hitler's suicide on 30 April, Goebbels sent Krebs and Colonel Theodor von Dufving, under a white flag, to deliver a letter he had written to General Vasily Chuikov. Dufving was Helmuth Weidling's Chief of Staff. The letter contained surrender terms acceptable to Goebbels. Chuikov, as commander of the Soviet 8th Guards Army, commanded the Soviet forces in central Berlin. Krebs arrived shortly before 4:00 a.m. Krebs, who spoke Russian, informed Chuikov that Hitler and Eva Braun, his wife, had killed themselves in the Führerbunker. Chuikov, who was not aware that there was a bunker complex under the Reich Chancellery or that Hitler was married, calmly said that he already knew all of this. Chuikov was not, however, prepared to accept the terms in Goebbels' letter or to negotiate with Krebs. The Soviets were unwilling to accept anything other than unconditional surrender, as it was agreed with the other Allies. Krebs was not authorized by Goebbels to agree to such terms, and so the meeting ended with no agreement. According to Traudl Junge, Krebs returned to the bunker looking \\"worn out, exhausted\\". Krebs' surrender of Berlin was thus impeded as long as Goebbels was alive. At around 8:30 p.m. on 1 May, Goebbels removed this impediment by committing suicide. After Goebbels' death, Krebs himself became suicidal. The responsibility for surrendering the city fell to General Helmuth Weidling, the commander of the Berlin Defense Area. On 2 May, with Krebs in no condition to do it himself, Weidling contacted General Chuikov to again discuss surrender. Weidling and Chuikov met and had the following conversation in which Chuikov asked about Krebs: > Chuikov: \\"You are the commander of the Berlin garrison?\\" > Weidling: \\"Yes, I am the commander of the LVI Panzer Corps.\\" > Chuikov: \\"Where is Krebs?\\" > Weidling: \\"I saw him yesterday in the Reich Chancellery.

Junge relates how she approached Krebs to say goodbye and how he straightened up and smoothed his uniform before greeting her for the last time. Krebs and General Wilhelm Burgdorf, along with SS-Obersturmbannführer Franz Schädle of the Führerbegleitkommando, stayed behind with the intention of committing suicide. Sometime in the early morning hours of 2 May, Krebs and Burgdorf committed suicide together by gunshot to the head. Their bodies were later found when Soviet personnel entered the bunker complex. Schädle also committed suicide by gunshot on 2 May 1945. Thereafter, the corpses of Krebs, the Goebbels family along with the remains of Hitler, Eva Braun and Hitler's dogs were repeatedly buried and exhumed by the Soviets. The last burial was at the SMERSH facility in Magdeburg on 21 February 1946. In 1970, KGB director Yuri Andropov authorised an operation to destroy the remains. On 4 April 1970, a Soviet KGB team with detailed burial charts secretly exhumed five wooden boxes. The remains from the boxes were thoroughly burned and crushed, after which the ashes were thrown into the Biederitz river, a tributary of the nearby Elbe.

The 2008 final In the final, 1999 Cup-winners Dunedin Technical faced finals debutants East Coast Bays in front of a crowd of some 3000 spectators at North Harbour Stadium. Technical had the better of the early stages of the match, as East Coast Bays took time to settle, but were unable to press home any advantage. By the mid-stages of the half Bays had begun to exert their dominance, particularly in the midfield area. The only goal of the match came from a long Ryan Zoghby throw-in in the 34th minute which was deflected by Technical defender Blair Scoullar into his own net.

Background Canal of the aqueduct – View in 1900 At the beginning of the 19th century, there was a severe shortage of water. After having negotiated with several French engineers in 1852, the Governor of Cuba José Gutiérrez de la Concha decided to create a commission to propose solutions for the water supply. The commission was to be chaired by Francisco de Albear, at that time colonel of the Corps of Engineers of the Spanish army and chairman of the Public Works Committee of Cuba. His main assistant was José Luis Casaseca, Director of the Institute of Chemical Investigations of Havana. The construction of a new water supply system was a necessity for the improvement of the sanitary conditions of the city. There had been severe outbreaks of cholera in 1850, 1856, 1865 and 1867-1870. The mortality due to dysentery and other waterborne diseases. Investigation The investigations carried out by De Albear’s team were extensive; he investigated various alternatives among which the use of the Luyanó, Martín Pérez, Guasabacoa, Marianao or Almendares rivers as well of the Cacahual or del Calvario springs all of which he rejected for various reasons. He finally settled for the use of the del Vento springs, both due to the superior water quality and for the possibility of conveying the water by gravity, the source being located 41 meters higher than the city. Chemical studies carried out by José Luis Casaseca lead to the conclusion that the water of the del Vento springs had to be isolated from the Almendares River to prevent a deterioration of the water quality which was of great concern due to the tropical location of the island.José Luis Casaseca,: Informe sobre los análisis de las aguas del Almendares y de Vento – In: Memoria sobre el Proyecto de conducción a la Habana de las aguas de los manantiales de Vento Imprenta del Gobierno y Capitanía General por S. M., Habana, 1856 However, it was only in 1855, that a second commission, chaired also by Francisco de Albear, started extensive geological and hydrological field surveys, to ascertain that the springs had the capacity to cover the water requirements of the city. Finally, on November 25, 1855 De Albear was able to present his report to Governor José Gutiérrez de la Concha.Francisco de Alvear y Lara – Memoria sobre el proyecto de conducción a La Habana de las aguas de los manantiales de Vento.

Copies of the report were sent to the Ministers of Interior (Ministro de Gobernación) and of Public Works (Ministro de Fomento) in Madrid. The \\"Royal Decree for the conveyance of the water of the Vento springs to Havana\\" was signed on October 5, 1858. To ensure the financing, the decree suspended for three years all payments from the revenue generated by the Fernando II aqueduct, imposed an annual fee of 45 pesos for each water faucet and authorized the governorship to raise another 500,000 pesos through taxes, if necessary. On February 18, 1859, Governor Gutiérrez de la Concha created the Administration of the de Vento canal, Board of Directors.Rolando García Blanco - Agua, medio ambiente y sociedad en La Habana colonial – CubaLiteraria  Components of the project  Though called an aqueduct, the project presented by De Albear is complex water supply system, including the following components: Historia de la Hidráulica en Cuba (1851-1900) Alejandro Montecinos and Alberto Sauri.- Las aguas de Albear * dams for the creation of storage ponds for the water of the springs * Hydraulic structures in the Vento gully * De-silting structures * Tunnel for the crossing of the Almendares River * canal for conveyance of water to the city * water treatment plant * water storage tanks and water towers * the water distribution network in the city. Technical features Albear Aqueduct The canal has an oval cross section, being 2.40 m deep and having a maximum width of 1.98 m. With a slope of 1:5000 it can convey a discharge of 1.67 m³/s (144.000 m³/day) at normal water levels. However, at higher water levels the capacity of the canal can be increased to 302.800 m³/day. It should be taken into account that, according to the standards in force at the time the canal was designed, the water requirement was of 500 day per inhabitant Construction of the water supply system In 1861, the construction started under the direction of Francisco de Albear. The progress was however extremely slow due to the scarcity of available funds and to the disturbances created by the Ten Years' War. Work on the water distribution network started only in 1874 when Francisco de Albear made the first complete topographic survey of Havana and produced a 1:5000 plan of the city. Based on these surveys, he completed the design of the network and fixed the location of the water storage tanks.Francisco de Albear y Fernández de Lara –Memoria del Proyecto de depósito de recepción y de distribución de las aguas del Canal de Vento , Habana, septiembre de 1876, In the meanwhile, the water supply of the city had worsened, as a result of the project's construction delays. After the Peace of Zanjón was signed with the independentist rebels on February 10, 1878, the first part of the canal could finally be completed and, on June 23, 1878, the link of the De Vento Canal and the filters of the Fernando VII aqueduct could finally be inaugurated by Governor Arsenio Martínez-Campos Antón.Anales de la Real Academia de Ciencias Médicas, Físicas y Naturales de La Habana, - Habana, 1880 Completion of the project Francisco de Albear, infected with malaria, was not able to oversee the last part of the project. He died on October 22, 1887, without seeing its completion. The work was continued under the supervision of Joaquín Ruiz, colonel of the Corps of Engineers who had assisted de Albear.Joaquín Ruiz – Canal de Albear – In Memoria acerca del Estado y Adelantos del Excmo.

The project was inaugurated on January 22, 1893, 45 years after its commencement. Gerardo Martí - Albear, un patriota de la construcción  Expansions  An expansion from 1925 to 1931 under the direction of the engineer Montoulieu, and the participation in addition to the engineer Abel Fernández Simón, took place. The population exceeded half a million inhabitants and urban growth had also continued to rise, so it was necessary to build a new Cup in Vento, known as the Taza chica, and another Cup in Acura del Cura, with a driving channel up to Vento. A new booth was also built Turbo-electric pumps in Palatino. In this era created the Garden of the Seasons in the access zone Deposits and remodeled the exterior areas of Vento, with the creation of gardens and the incorporation of trails and ornamental elements. Similarly, the Torre Norte was renovated and elements were added ornamentals in the neocolonial style. The third expansion of the aqueduct occurred between 1947 and 1948, directed by the engineer Fernández Simón, and involved the installation of a new 66″ duct diameter between Mazorra and Palatino, passing through Vento, that allowed to drive to the Palatino deposits a flow of forty million gallons per day from Aguada del Cura, which improved the supply of Vedado, Luyanó, the Viper, the Hill and allowed to supply Los Pinos, Arroyo Naranjo and Calvario. Awards The project received a prize at the Centennial International Exhibition of 1876 in Philadelphia. It was also distinguished with the Gold Medal of the Éxposition universelle of Paris 1878, where it was considered an engineering masterwork.Real Orden remitiendo a los Gobernadores Generales de las Islas de Cuba, Puerto Rico y Filipinas la relación de los expositores premiados en la Exposición de París Ministerio de Educación y Cultura de España, Archivo Histórico NacionalEnrique J.

Conclusion  The Albear Aqueduct is still active as it works without electric power and continues using as sole energy the force with which springs from its source. Supplies all five central municipalities of the city of Havana: Havana Vieja, Centro Habana, Cerro, October 10 and Plaza de the Revolution, which is approximately the 12% of the population of Havana today. The Albear Aqueduc was selected by the National Union of Architects and Construction Engineers of Cuba, UNAICC, as one of the Seven Wonders of Engineering in Cuba.

The park is home to many species of animal and plant life, including the eponymous red crab, whose annual migration sees around 100 million crabs move to the sea to spawn. Christmas Island is the only nesting place for the endangered Abbott's booby and critically endangered Christmas Island frigatebird, and the wide range of other endemic species makes the island of significant interest to the scientific community.  History  Concerns were expressed in the early 1970s about the effect of phosphate mining on the flora and fauna of Christmas Island. A particular focus was on the habitat of Abbott's booby (Papasula abbotti), which appeared in danger of extinction. In 1974 a governmental committee examined the environmental impact of mining and other commercial activities and advised on measures to protect the island. The committee's recommendation that an area of the island be set aside for conservation was implemented in a series of measures culminating in the establishment of the Christmas Island National Park on 21 February 1980 under the terms of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975. The park initially covered the south-west corner of the island, and was extended in 1986 and 1989 to include most of the rainforest on the island. Today the park covers approximately , or 63% of the island.  Geology and geography  Christmas Island consists of an uplifted limestone cap metamorphosed from coral reefs overlying more ancient volcanic andesite bedrock. The underlying seamount lies some southwest of Indonesia, and the isolation by the abyssal zone has led to endemism amongst the marine ecosystem. The park's boundaries extend beyond the low water line. Approximately of the island's shoreline is within the park limits. Many stretches of the shoreline are marked by rock platforms, which are filled by wave splashes to create rock pools. Sea cliffs, up to high in places, rise steeply from the sea and form a series of stepped terraces, the lower cliffs of which are higher and steeper. Soil on the island is generally poor, punctuated by limestone pinnacles, and tends to dehydrate during the dry season. The limestone is fractured and has created a substantial cave system. There are both water-filled and dry caves. Christmas Island's two Ramsar sites, The Dales and Hosnies Spring, are contained within the park.  Flora and fauna  Gecarcoidea natalis, the Christmas Island red crab Both the waters surrounding the island and its land surface are fecund, and the park exhibits a high level of biodiversity with many endemic species.  Fauna  Crabs = The island is particularly noted for its prodigious populations of Christmas Island red crabs (Gecarcoidea natalis), whose mass migrations at spawning time may number over a hundred million individuals. The bright red carapaces and sheer density of crabs make their routes to the sea observable from the air. Nonetheless, the populations of red crabs are threatened by the arrival of the invasive yellow crazy ant (Anoplolepis gracilipes). The ant was accidentally introduced between 1915 and 1934, and without any native ant species to compete against, rapidly formed 'supercolonies' of extremely high density. Populations of the ant have been observed bringing down red crabs over a hundred times their combined biomass. A. gracilipes is thought responsible for killing up to 30 million of the park's crabs. While the red crab is Christmas Island's most numerous crab, the island also hosts the world's largest population of coconut crab (Birgus latro), the world's largest land invertebrate. There may be as many as one million coconut crabs on Christmas Island. It is also home to several species each of hermit crab, grapsids and gecarcinucoidea. = Reptiles = There are six species of reptile native to the park, of which five are endemic: the giant gecko (Cyrtodactylus sadlieri), the Christmas Island gecko (Lepidodactylus listeri), the forest skink (Emoia nativitatis), the blue- tailed skink (Cryptoblephanus egeriae) and the Christmas Island blind snake (Ramphotyphlops exocoeti). The foreshore skink (Emoia atrocostata) is native to the park, but is also to be found on other islands of the Indian Ocean. All have been showing decline in recent years. A further five species of reptile have been reported, but all were introduced by human activity: the barking gecko (Hemidactylus frenatus), house gecko (Gehyra mutilata), black blind snake (Ramphotyphlops braminus), wolf snake (Lycodon aulicus capucinus) and grass skink (Lygosoma bowringii). = Mammals = There are three species of mammal native to the park: the Christmas Island shrew (Crocidura trichura), listed as critically endangered, and possibly extinct; the small Christmas Island pipistrelle (Pipistrellus murrayi), listed as endangered and showing a rapid decrease in numbers; and the Christmas Island flying fox (Pteropus melanotus). The black rat (Rattus rattus) and house mouse (Mus musculus) have been introduced. Feral cats and dogs are also common, and stray into park territory. = Birds = Abbott's booby, unique to Christmas Island There are over 100 species of birds, of which ten are endemic. Many birds are passing vagrants, such as the great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo). Others, like the lesser frigatebird (Fregata ariel), are more regular visitors. Bird populations are threatened due to the invasive yellow crazy ant, and reports have suggested that the ant has attacked hatchlings and harassed adults in their nests. All endemic bird species have been placed on the critically endangered list.  Flora  The dominant vegetation on the island is rainforest. Approximately 200 species of native flowering plant are to be found on Christmas Island. There are no mangroves on the park's coast. However, a stand of the normally estuarine mangrove species, Bruguiera gymnorhiza and B. sexangula, is found approximately above sea level, at Hosnies Spring.  Park management  The park is managed by the Director of National Parks whose duties include protection of the park's natural areas, its lifeforms and genetic resources, to maintain ecological diversity, and to manage visitor access for educational, cultural and recreational purposes. It latest management plan (2002) listed control of the yellow crazy ant as its highest priority. The park administration has a staff of 17, and operates out of an office in Drumsite on the northern side of the island.

Bush, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Arizona Senator John McCain. He is best known for pushing McCain to select Sarah Palin as his running mate, which McCain came to regret. He specialized in \\"message development and strategy\\". Schmidt was the senior campaign strategist and advisor to the 2008 presidential campaign of Senator John McCain. He was a Vice Chair at the public relations firm Edelman until he stepped down in July 2018. In June 2018, Schmidt renounced the Republican Party as \\"fully the party of Trump\\". He is a founder of The Lincoln Project, a political action committee of lifelong Republican strategists seeking to prevent Trump's reelection. Early life and education The son of a schoolteacher and a telecommunications executive, Schmidt grew up in North Plainfield, New Jersey, where he became an Eagle Scout, a tight end on the high school football team, a two-year member of the National Honor Society, and senior class vice president. In 1988, he was one of two graduating seniors voted \\"most likely to succeed\\" by his classmates at North Plainfield High School. He distributed campaign materials for Democrat Bill Bradley's 1978 Senate campaign. Schmidt attended the University of Delaware from 1988 through the spring of 1993, majoring in political science. During this time, he registered as a Republican. He left three credits short of graduating because he did not pass a math course; Schmidt has said that he has been diagnosed with a learning disability that makes higher math difficult for him. He joined the Delta Tau Delta fraternity, was a member of the campus Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program, and did field work for Republican candidates in Delaware, sometimes wearing campaign buttons to class. Schmidt graduated in the class of 2013. Career=Early campaigns In 1995, Schmidt managed the unsuccessful campaign for Kentucky Attorney General of Will T. Scott, who is formerly a Justice of the Kentucky Supreme Court.Justice Will T. Scott , courts.ky.gov. Retrieved November 15, 2015.

Governor of California. Also that year, he was the Communications Director for California State Treasurer Matt Fong's unsuccessful campaign to unseat U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer. In 1999, he was the Communications Director for Lamar Alexander's presidential run, leaving in June when the campaign reduced its senior staff. Washington, D.C. Schmidt with President George W.

In 2001, he was the spokesman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, becoming the Communications Director by 2002. Schmidt joined the Bush administration as a Deputy Assistant to the President and Counselor to Vice President Dick Cheney. In 2004, he was a member of the senior strategic planning group, led by White House adviser Karl Rove, that ran President George W. Bush's re-election campaign; Schmidt oversaw the reelection \\"war room\\". In 2005 and 2006, he was the White House strategist responsible for the U.S. Supreme Court nominations of Samuel Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts. California In 2006, Schmidt left the White House to become the campaign manager in the re-election campaign for California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. From there, he became a partner in Mercury Public Affairs, part of Fleishman-Hillard International Communications, in charge of Mercury's operations in California. 2008 McCain presidential campaign On July 2, 2008, Schmidt was appointed to head up day-to-day operations of the McCain campaign in response to concerns that the campaign lacked coordination and a clear message. Rick Davis retained the formal title of \\"campaign manager\\". =Press commentary= The New York Times described Schmidt's management as having transformed the McCain campaign into \\"an elbows-out, risk-taking, disciplined machine\\", crediting him with aggressive responses to press criticism and creative methods of manipulating the news cycle. Time's Michael Scherer, in an opinion piece from September 15, 2008, relating to Schmidt's involvement with John McCain's presidential campaign, stated that Schmidt, the \\"lord of outrage, has a long and prosperous career ahead of him\\". Schmidt criticized the press on September 22, 2008 calling the New York Times \\"a pro-Obama advocacy organization that every day impugns the McCain campaign, attacks Senator McCain, attacks Governor (Sarah Palin)\\" and saying \\"Whatever The New York Times once was, it is today not by any standard a journalistic organization.\\" =Stance on gay rights= Schmidt voiced his support for gay rights at a meeting of the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay Republican group. He said: \\"I just wanted to take a second to come by and pay my respect and the campaign's respect to your organization and to your group. Your organization is an important one in the fabric of our party.\\" Schmidt said about his lesbian sister and her life partner: \\"On a personal level, my sister and her partner are an important part of my life and our children's life. I admire your group and your organization and I encourage you to keep fighting for what you believe in because the day is going to come.\\" In February 2013, Schmidt along with 74 other Republicans co-signed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court of the United States in support of overturning Proposition 8. \\"The die is cast on this issue when you look at the percentage of younger voters who support gay marriage\\", he was quoted as saying. \\"As Dick Cheney said years ago, 'Freedom means freedom for everybody. While leading the 2008 John McCain presidential campaign the McCain campaign states that \\"gay adoption is a state issue and does not endorse any federal legislation.\\" Departure from the Republican Party In May 2018, when President Donald Trump moved the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, sparking violent Gaza border protests, Schmidt said Trump \\"has blood on his hands\\".\\"Steve Schmidt: There is blood on Trump's hands\\". NBC News. May 14, 2018. On June 19, 2018, Schmidt formally withdrew from the GOP over Donald Trump's policy of separating immigrant families at the U.S. border with Mexico. He also cited Republican leadership for their failure to challenge the policy. Schmidt said of Trump, \\"We have in America--right now, at this hour--to understand that you have a lawless president, a vile president, a corrupt president, a mean, cruel president, who is seeking to remake the world order.\\" In June 2018, he tweeted \\"the Republican Party ... is fully the party of Trump. It is corrupt, indecent and immoral. With the exception of a few Governors like Baker, Hogan and Kasich it is filled with feckless cowards who disgrace and dishonor the legacies of the party's greatest leaders ... Today the GOP has become a danger to our democracy and our values.\\"Huff Post 20 June 2018: GOP Strategist Quits 'Corrupt' Party Of 'Feckless Cowards', Will Vote For Democrats During an August 2018 television appearance, he characterized Trumpism: Describing his new political orientation, he stated: Howard Schultz's possible 2020 run On January 28, 2019, it was reported that Schmidt, along with Democratic consultant Bill Burton, had been hired to help shape a potential presidential run by former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz. With Schultz deciding to withdraw, Schmidt returned to MSNBC.

Schmidt parted ways with the podcast when he walked out in the middle of an episode in which Jordan and executive producer Adam Levine questioned Schmidt about his role as adviser to potential 2020 presidential candidate Howard Schultz. = The Lincoln Project = He is a founding member of The Lincoln Project, a Super PAC organized by current and former Republican operatives opposed to the re-election of Donald Trump in 2020.Schmidt and members of The Lincoln Project guest starred on Showtime's The Circus in 2020 giving viewers an insight to their strategies. Game Change Schmidt is portrayed by Woody Harrelson in the HBO film Game Change. The film, based on chapters of the book of the same title by political journalists John Heilemann and Mark Halperin, focuses on the choice of Sarah Palin as John McCain's running mate in the 2008 United States presidential election. Schmidt is shown as pushing for the choice of Palin, then afterward conceding she was unqualified for the job, including that she had a limited knowledge of current affairs. Schmidt himself voiced his approval of the film, saying that \\"it tells the truth of the campaign\\" and that watching the film was tantamount to \\"an out-of-body experience\\".David Frum, \\"HBO's 'Game Change' Charts Sarah Palin's Revenge\\", thedailybeast.com.

The purpose of the Dallas Accord was to make the Libertarian Party of the United States a \\"big tent\\" that would welcome more ideologically diverse groups of people interested in reducing the size of government. Therefore, the 1974 platform, including a \\"Statement of Principles,\\" focused on statements arguing for getting government out of various activities, and used phrases such as \\"where governments exist they must not violate the rights of any individual.\\" The previous version of the Statement of Principles adopted at the party's first convention in 1972, in contrast, affirmatively endorsed the minarchist perspective with statements such as \\"Since government has only one legitimate function, the protection of individual rights....\\" It was agreed that the topic of anarchism would not even be on the table for discussion until a limited government was achieved. During the following years the number of anarchists in the party was estimated to have dropped by about half and more conservative-oriented and constitutionalist members joined.Knapp, Thomas, \\"Time for a new Dallas Accord?\\", Rational Review. Denunciations of equating the Libertarian Party with anarchism have persisted throughout the party's history, from John Hospers, the party's first presidential nominee in 1972, to Judge Jim Gray, the party's 2012 nominee for Vice President.http://johnhospers.com/articles/anarkisttemperament.pdf During the 2006 Libertarian National Convention delegates deleted a large portion of the very detailed platform. The phrase \\"Government exists to protect the rights of every individual including life, liberty and property\\" was added. This development was described as the \\"Portland Massacre\\" by its opponents. Some took this as meaning the Dallas Accord was dead. Several delegates tried in 2008 to restore the platform, without success. Anarchist libertarians continue to work in the party and run for office. Anarchist philosophies of no monopolist government are, they contend, referenced implicitly in the current platform planks, one of which describes the \\"right to alter or abolish government.\\" Whether such an agreement remains in effect, and if so whether it should, or what limits it places on the party's public statements or candidates, all remain disputed. The party's Statement of Principles also states support for \\"the prohibition of the initiation of physical force against others,\\" and \\"the prohibition of robbery, trespass, fraud, and misrepresentation.\\" The platform states in its Criminal Justice plank, that \\"[t]he prescribed role of government is to protect the rights of every individual including the right to life, liberty and property.\\" References Category:Classical liberalism Category:Anarcho-capitalism Category:History of anarchism Category:Minarchism Category:Libertarian Party (United States) ","title":"Dallas Accord"},{"id":"18654566","text":"Olszewo-Góra is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Jedwabne, within Łomża County, Podlaskie Voivodeship, in north-eastern Poland.

It occurs following self- inflicted trauma of the skin. Pyotraumatic dermatitis rarely affects cats. Signs The dog persistently licks, chews, scratches or rubs at a focal area of skin, which quickly causes hair loss. The skin becomes red, moist and weeps. The affected area is obviously defined and separate from the surrounding healthy skin and coat. Usually only one area of the skin is affected. The size of the affected area is variable. If the area is difficult for the dog to scratch, or if the disease is caught early, hair may still be present. Areas commonly affected include the rump above the tail, the head and neck near the ears, and the top and sides of the lumbar area. Cause Pyotraumatic dermatitis is caused by self-inflicted trauma to the skin, which is incited by pain or irritation, such as infestation with fleas or lice, irritation from clippers, allergic skin diseases, diseases of the anal sacs, inflammation of the ear canal, foreign bodies or irritants within the coat, or pain in muscles or joints. Skin maceration from repeated wetting of the coat or moisture in the fur can also be an inciting cause. Flea infestations are the most common inciting factor. The inciting factor causes the dog to traumatize a small area of skin. The affected skin weeps (that is, it exudes serum), and this moist surface layer of skin can become colonized by bacteria, although the skin itself is not infected. The affected area is usually painful, as nerve endings are exposed when the surface of the skin is eroded. Hair which remains in the affected area holds in the moisture and further irritates the skin surface. Continued itching by the dog can cause the affected area to enlarge rapidly in only a few hours. Pyotraumatic dermatitis is more common when the dog's environment is hot and humid. Dogs with thick undercoats or long fur are most commonly affected, but pyotraumatic dermatitis can occur in any dog. Commonly affected breeds include the Airedale Terrier, Akita, Basset Hound, Golden Retriever, Great Pyrenees, Labrador Retriever, Leonberger, Peruvian Inca Orchid (Peruvian Hairless Dog), Shiba Inu, and Xoloitzcuintle (Mexican hairless dog) as well as the German Shepherd and St. Bernard. Treatment There are several aspects to treatment: breaking the \\"itch-scratch\\" cycle by clipping the fur and cleaning the skin; addressing the underlying painful or itchy condition which initially caused the animal to begin scratching; and relieving the dog's discomfort, for example with steroid medications. The hair in and around the affected area is clipped before the skin is cleaned with an antiseptic, rinsed, and dried. The dog may require sedation before the fur is clipped, as skin affected by pyotraumatic dermatitis can be painful. With treatment, pyotraumatic dermatitis resolves in 3–7 days, but can recur if the inciting factor is not addressed.

Called \\"Mr. Human Rights\\" by U.S. News and World Report, Healey's focus has been on inspiring the youth to support non-violent activism that would push back oppressive governments and societies. Healey heads the Washington, D.C. based Human Rights Action Center, (HRAC), a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization. His projects include printing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights into all passports and bringing Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi to power in Burma. Background Born into an Irish-American Catholic family as the youngest of eleven children, Healey grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His mother was a teacher and his father was a metallurgist at Superior Steel, a steel rolling plant located in Pittsburgh. He studied at St. Fidelis Seminary for high school and college and received a master's degree from Catholic University. He was a Franciscan friar for ten years and a Catholic priest for four years. He left the priesthood in 1968 and began work as Director of the Young World Development Program at Freedom from Hunger Foundation USA for five years. At the Young World Development Program, Healey produced over 300 Walks for Development. A total of $12 million was raised from these walks and given to national and international non-profits, including Meals for Millions, The Free Clinic, and Freedom Farm Co-op of Fannie Lu Hamer. They also funded Catholic Relief Service, Church World Service, Heifer, and Oxfam International and other international non-profit organizations. From 1973 to 1976, Healey worked at the Center for Community Change (CCC) in Washington, D.C. At CCC, Healey helped to build the Binder Schweitzer Hospital in Mexico and co- directed the Dick Gregory World Hunger Run across the United States. Dick Gregory won the Dawson Award from the Black Caucus for this run. Healey, along with George O’Hara, recruited Muhammad Ali to join Dick's Hunger Run. From 1977 until 1981, Healey directed the Peace Corps in Lesotho. During his time as director of the Peace Corps, he was also a presence on morning, afternoon and evening shows such as Oprah, 60 Minutes and Nightline. After finishing his tour with the Peace Corps, he worked as the director of Amnesty International USA for 12 years. Healey has received seven honorary doctorates and spoken in colleges and high schools. He has produced three music albums and Douye, a documentary on Aung San Suu Kyi. Additionally, Healey worked as a consultant to both the Center of Victims of Torture in Haiti, and to comedian Dick Gregory on the topic of world hunger. Healey helped to start the Reebok Human Rights Foundation, which hands out the Reebok Human Rights Award each year, and two other non-profits, Witness (human rights group) and Equality Now. Healey gained attention in 1990 when he worked with other human rights activists to block the entrance to a UN Human Rights conference set to take place in Vienna, because the UN refused to seat the Dalai Lama. In 1992, Healey spoke out against the U.S. government when Haitian refugees fleeing harm from a dictatorial government were turned away from the United States border. Healey campaigned to free Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest. Media Projects=Concerts/film/albums 1976: Dick Gregory’s World Hunger Run To highlight world hunger, Jack worked as Advisor to Dick Gregory on his World Hunger Run from Los Angeles to New York, beginning on July 4. Dick Gregory won the Dawson Award from the Black Causus for this run. 1986: A Conspiracy of Hope Tour This two week tour for human rights included musicians Peter Gabriel, U2, Lou Reed, Joan Baez, Bryan Adams, Miles Davis, Bob Dylan, The Police, Jackson Browne, Santana, the Hooters, Third World and Bob Geldof. Traveling to San Francisco, Los Angeles, Denver, Atlanta, Chicago, and Giants Stadium in New Jersey, this tour furthered awareness of Amnesty International in the US, raised $3 million, and brought in 45,000 new US members within a month. MTV and Fox Network both ran the last show internationally for a period of eleven hours, and the show won a national award and brought the show into the colleges and high schools of the United States. Because of the success of the show, Healey was recognized by MTV as humanitarian of the year. The tour was co-produced by Bill Graham, Mary Daly and Jack Healey. 1988: Human Rights Now! Tour In 1988, for the 40th anniversary of the Declaration of Human Rights, Healey organized the 6-week Human Rights Now! World tour to celebrate achievements of the human rights movement and to introduce the idea of basic human rights protection through the power of the media to millions of people worldwide. Over a million people filled the stadiums, and crowded into fields for concerts in South America, Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia. The concert was broadcast to over one billion people worldwide. The tour covered 18 countries in six weeks, and won the Pollster Reader's Award for number of viewers, beating out Michael Jackson's worldwide tour. HBO covered this show on a 3-hour special. This show tripled the membership of Amnesty International worldwide. Musicians included Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Peter Gabriel, Tracy Chapman, and Youssou N'Dour 1990: From A Hug to a Hope Concert As a celebration of the human rights victory in Chile after the fall of dictator Pinochet, Healey organized a two-day concert with Sting, Peter Gabriel, Sinéad O'Connor, Jackson Browne, Ruben Blades, Wynton Marsalis and New Kids on the Block. The show took place in a stadium previously used as a prison for political dissidents, and a home to some of the many tortures and executions that took place under Pinochet's rule. Families of the victims of the prison attended the concert, and celebrated the great victory for the Chilean people and for human rights activists around the world. This live show was broadcast 10 hours a day for 2 days to all of Latin America, Mexico and Spain. As a result of the concert, Jackson Browne was able to free two political prisoners still jailed in Chile. 1991:'Free to Laugh' In 1991, Healey produced this three-hour show on Lifetime in honor of women's rights.

It is around 5x more potent than cocaine, but is more selective for the dopamine transporter relative to the other monoamine transporters. RTI-150 has a fast onset of effects and short duration of action, and its abuse potential in animal studies is similar to that of cocaine itself; its main application in scientific research has been in studies investigating the influence of pharmacokinetics on the abuse potential of stimulant drugs, with the rapid entry of RTI-150 into the brain thought to be a key factor in producing its high propensity for development of dependence in animals. RTI-150 is not explicitly illegal anywhere in the world, but its similar structure and pharmacological activity to cocaine makes it possible that it would be considered a controlled substance analogue in countries such as the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand which have controlled substance analogue legislation.

Depending on the size, complexity, and purpose of a particular building project.  Design process  A design process may include a series of steps followed by designers. Depending on the product or service, some of these stages may be irrelevant, ignored in real-world situations in order to save time, reduce cost, or because they may be redundant in the situation. Typical stages of the design process include: *Pre-production design ** Design brief - a statement of design goals ** Analysis - analysis of current design goals ** Research - investigating similar design solutions in the field or related topics ** Specification - specifying requirements of a design solution ** Problem solving - conceptualizing and documenting design solutions ** Presentation - presenting design solutions *Design during production ** Development - continuation and improvement of a designed solution ** Testing - in-situ testing a designed solution *Post-production design feedback for future designs ** Implementation - introducing the designed solution into the environment ** Evaluation and conclusion - summary of process and results, including constructive criticism and suggestions for future improvements *Redesign - any or all stages in the design process repeated (with corrections made) at any time before, during, or after production.  Architectural drawing  Architectural drawings are used by architects and others for a number of purposes: to develop a design idea into a coherent proposal, to communicate ideas and concepts, to convince clients of the merits of a design, to enable a building contractor to construct it, as a record of the completed work, and to make a record of a building that already exists. Architectural drawings are made according to a set of conventions, which include particular views (floor plan, section etc.), sheet sizes, units of measurement and scales, annotation and cross referencing. Conventionally, drawings were made in ink on paper or a similar material, and any copies required had to be laboriously made by hand. The twentieth century saw a shift to drawing on tracing paper, so that mechanical copies could be run off efficiently.  Architectural design values  Architectural design values make up an important part of what influences architects and designers when they make their design decisions. However, architects and designers are not always influenced by the same values and intentions. Value and intentions differ between different architectural movements. It also differs between different schools of architecture and schools of design as well as among individual architects and designers.Holm, Ivar (2006). Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture and Industrial design: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. .  Floor plan  Floor plan for a single-family home One of the major tools in architectural design is the floor plan. This diagram shows the relationships between rooms, spaces and other physical features at one level of a structure. Dimensions are usually drawn between the walls to specify room sizes and wall lengths. Floor plans will also include details of fixtures like sinks, water heaters, furnaces, etc. Floor plans will include notes to specify finishes, construction methods, or symbols for electrical items. Similar to a map in a floor plan the orientation of the view is downward from above, but unlike a conventional map, a plan is understood to be drawn at a particular vertical position (commonly at about 4 feet above the floor). Objects below this level are seen, objects at this level are shown 'cut' in plan-section, and objects above this vertical position within the structure are omitted or shown dashed. Plan view or \\"planform\\" is defined as a vertical orthographic projection of an object on a horizontal plane, like a map.  Planning  A plan is typically any procedure used to achieve an objective. It is a set of intended actions, through which one expects to achieve a goal. Plans can be formal or informal: * Structured and formal plans, used by multiple people, are more likely to occur in projects, diplomacy, careers, economic development, military campaigns, combat, or in the conduct of other business. * Informal or ad-hoc plans are created by individuals in all of their pursuits. A lack of planning in any discipline may lead to a misallocation of resources, misunderstandings, or irrelevant sections added to Wikipedia articles such as this one.  Building construction  Building construction is the process of preparing for and forming buildingsSturgis, Russell. \\"Construction def. B. and \\"Building\\" def. A. Sturgis' illustrated dictionary of architecture and building: an unabridged reprint of the 1901-2 edition. Mineola, N.Y.: Dover, 1989. Print. and building systems.Davies, Nikolas, and Erkki Jokiniemi. \\"Construction\\" def. 1-5. Dictionary of architecture and building construction. Amsterdam: Elsevier/Architectural Press, 2008. 93. Print. Construction starts with planning, design, and financing and continues until the structure is ready for occupancy. Far from being a single activity, large scale construction is a feat of human multitasking. Normally, the job is managed by a project manager, and supervised by a construction manager, design engineer, construction engineer or project architect. For the successful execution of a project, effective planning is essential.  Related types of design = Garden design  Garden design is the art and process of designing and creating plans for layout and planting of gardens and landscapes. Garden design may be done by the garden owner themselves, or by professionals of varying levels of experience and expertise. Most professional garden designers are trained in principles of design and in horticulture, and have an expert knowledge and experience of using plants. Some professional garden designers are also landscape architects, a more formal level of training that usually requires an advanced degree and often a state license. Many amateur gardeners also attain a high level of experience from extensive hours working in their own gardens, through casual study or Master Gardener Programs offered by the American Horticultural Society.  Landscape design  Landscape planning is a branch of landscape architecture. Urban park systems and greenways of the type planned by Frederick Law Olmsted are key examples of urban landscape planning. Landscape designers tend to work for clients who wish to commission construction work. Landscape planners can look beyond the 'closely drawn technical limits' and 'narrowly drawn territorial boundaries' which constrain design projects. Landscape planners tend to work on projects which: * are of broad geographical scope * concern many land uses or many clients * are implemented over a long period of time In rural areas, the damage caused by unplanned mineral extraction was one of the early reasons for a public demand for landscape planning.  Site planning  Example of a site plan A site plan is an architectural plan, and a detailed engineering drawing of proposed improvements to a given lot. A site plan usually shows a building footprint, travelways, parking, drainage facilities, sanitary sewer lines, water lines, trails, lighting, and landscaping. Such a plan of a site is a graphic representation of the arrangement of buildings, parking, drives, landscaping and any other structure that is part of a development project. A site plan is a set of construction drawings that a builder or contractor uses to make improvements to a property. Counties can use the site plan to verify that development codes are being met and as a historical resource. Site plans are often prepared by a design consultant who must be either a licensed engineer, architect, landscape architect or land survey. The architect Map is part of a plan in Chandler, AZ.  Transportation planning  Transportation planning is the field involved with the siting of transportation facilities (generally streets, highways, sidewalks, bike lanes and public transport lines). Transportation planning historically has followed the rational planning model of defining goals and objectives, identifying problems, generating alternatives, evaluating alternatives, and developing the plan. Other models for planning include rational actor, satisficing, incremental planning, organizational process, and political bargaining. However, planners are increasingly expected to adopt a multi-disciplinary approach, especially due to the rising importance of environmentalism. For example, the use of behavioral psychology to persuade drivers to abandon their automobiles and use public transport instead. The role of the transport planner is shifting from technical analysis to promoting sustainability through integrated transport policies.Southern, A. (2006), Modern-day transport planners need to be both technically proficient and politically astute, Local Transport Today, no. 448, 27 July 2006.  Urban planning  Urban planning designs settlements, from the smallest towns to the largest cities. Urban, city, and town planning is the integration of the disciplines of land use planning and transport planning, to explore a very wide range of aspects of the built and social environments of urbanized municipalities and communities. Regional planning deals with a still larger environment, at a less detailed level. Another key role of urban planning is urban renewal, and re-generation of inner cities by adapting urban planning methods to existing cities suffering from long-term infrastructural decay.

A Europe- exclusive port for Microsoft Windows was developed and released by Deep Silver in 2010. The story, set in the 1980s in the Himalayas and inspired by Tibetan Buddhist folklore, follows mountaineer Eric Simmons's trek up Chomolonzo to rescue his brother Frank, who unleashed hostile ghosts and monsters onto the surrounding lands. The gameplay, combining elements of survival horror and action-adventure, follows Eric as he ascends Chomolonzo, collecting items to progress and fighting hostile ghosts. The development team wanted to create a game experience unlike others on the market, focusing on open environments and real-world folklore. Pre-production focused on researching religion and survival stories from the Himalayas. The action-oriented combat was a later addition based on tester feedback, though the motion control-based mechanics were always present. Including pre-production, development lasted over two years and was shared between multiple external studios. Upon release, the game saw a mixed reception; praise was given to its narrative and atmosphere, but many criticised its use of motion controls. It was the only game created by Deep Silver Vienna before closing down in February 2010. Gameplay Protagonist Eric Simmons fights a boss monster. Cursed Mountain is a survival horror action-adventure video game where players take on the role of mountaineer Eric Simmons. The game is split into thirteen levels, with the player controlling Eric as he explores a number of environments, solving puzzles and fighting hostile ghosts; all actions are controlled using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk; while basic movement and interactive actions use the d-pad and buttons, several combat and environmental triggers rely on the console's motion controls. The environments Eric explores are large, with several structures to enter and multiple levels to explore. To progress, some doors and pathways must be unlocked by completing puzzles in other areas of a level. Some puzzles require Eric to activate his third eye, which reveals hidden symbols in the environment. During some sections, Eric must climb sheer walls, with his movements mapped to the motion controls. During exploration, Eric can find items such as health-restoring incense sticks, and journal entries which flesh out the game's lore. During exploration, Eric is attacked by hostile ghosts, being drawn into a shadow realm during combat. To see clearly and attack ghosts, Eric must activate his third eye, and use a pickaxe augmented with a kartica to fire projectiles at attacking ghosts. Once weakened, a glowing symbol appears on a ghost. Once Eric hits the symbol, the player must then complete a quick time event by matching motion gestures with the Remote and Nunchuck to permanently banish the ghosts. In addition to ranged attacks, Eric can also swing the pickaxe to damage ghosts directly. During the game, the pickaxe can be upgraded with new enchantments which change the power and type of ammunition. For the Microsoft Windows port, the motion control mechanics were redesigned; instead, players used the mouse to draw specific patterns on screen. Synopsis Set during the late 1980s in the Tibetan Himalayas, the story opens with a log from climber Eric Simmons; his younger brother Frank was hired by wealthy expedition organiser Edward Bennet to retrieve a Turma artefact from the mountain Chomolonzo; the local practitioners of Chöd Buddhism believe that Chomolonzo is the embodiment of the goddess Palden Lhamo. Frank has disappeared, going up the mountain alone after an argument with Paul. Eric goes himself to try and rescue Frank. He finds the city of Lhando completely deserted, and is narrowly rescued from an attacking ghost by the monk Thod-pa, who teaches Eric to awaken his third eye and fight the ghosts before vanishing. Reaching Bennet, he learns that Frank did something wrong with the ritual preparations for climbing Chomolonzo, but may still be alive and that Thod-pa can help. During his ascent, Eric learns that Bennet's own attempt to get the Terma failed and cost him his leg, so he hired Frank to get it. He is directed by a survivor in Cherku Village to the yogini Jomo Menmo, who reveals that Frank is still alive and was working with her apprentice Mingma to climb the mountain. Menmo tries appeasing Palden Lhamo, but turns hostile and attacks Eric, accusing Frank of \\"raping\\" Palden Lhamo. Back in Cherku, Eric fights a monstrous bird spirit, then Menmo performs a final ritual that warns of a hard journey and reveals Palden Lhamo is undecided about Frank's fate, giving Eric hope he can save him. Reaching the monastery and Thod-pa, Eric learns that Frank was summoned by Bennet as he fit a translated prophecy about the Terma's retrieval. The llama of Derge Gonchen Monastery reveals that Frank used the Terma to attempt physical entry of the Bardo, a transitional realm between life, reincarnation and nirvana. Frank's spirit is trapped in the Bardo, but can return to his body. As Eric reaches the base camp, he pieces together what happened. Frank had not completed the necessary twelve ritual walks before the ascent, so went through a series of meditative and sexual rituals with Mingma as a shortcut. Mingma and Paul fell in love, so Mingma could not complete the final ceremony. Frank climbed the mountain anyway, an act equivalent to raping Palden Lhamo that cursed the expedition and unleashed ghosts from the Bardo. Upon reaching the base camp, Eric learns that Bennet killed Mingma in a rage after she attempted to flee. Confronting Bennet and Paul with the evidence, Bennet kills Paul, changing into a demonic monster that Eric destroys. Eric summits Chomolonzo and faces the physical incarnation of his inner demons. Eric then purges the curse with the Terma, pacifying Palden Lhamo and reviving Frank. Frank, having seen his own demons, decides to die and reincarnate. Eric returns down the mountain leaving Frank's body and the Terma on its summit. Development Cursed Mountain was primarily co-developed by Sproing Interactive and the Vienna branch of Deep Silver, who also acted as publisher. The first concept was a game set within the religion and scenery of Asia. Using this as a base, they decided upon the Tibetan Himalayas as the setting, leading into its mountain-climbing elements. From there, the basic combat gimmick of exorcising ghosts using control gestures was settled upon, leading to the team developing the title on Wii. Pre-production planning lasted ten months, followed by nineteen months of active production. In addition to the main studios, the team employed sixteen external companies across fourteen different countries. To ensure continuity between these developers, the team laid out the game design in a simple spreadsheet document and stuck to it, while communicating frequently with the other studios via web calls. Deep Silver staff member Martin Fillip described Cursed Mountain as the company's first title to rely so much on outsourcing to other studios. There were some issues with communication and delays in creating a vertical slice of gameplay, and a few of the production partners closed down during the game's development. The 1980s setting was chosen due to the lack of technology which would mitigate getting into trouble while climbing, reinforcing the sense of isolation. It was also a time when there was superstition about Western climbers coming to mountains in the region and violating local customs, which in-game was taken to a literal conclusion. While there are fantastic elements, the team wanted to maintain ambivelance as to whether the ghosts were real, or whether the characters were suffering from altitude-based hallucinations. The scenario was written by Bob Bates, who was creating the scenario before some of the settings had been finalised. He described working without this reference as the most difficult part of his work. The team's research included multiple documentaries about Buddhism, the Dalai Lama, and specifically the survival story of Touching the Void. The focus on one brother searching for another was inspired directly by Reinhold Messner losing his brother on an expedition. Eric's Scottish origin drew from the high number of Scottish mountaineers during the period. The team also wanted a character voice that had not been heard in many games, which would have been near-impossible with an American protagonist. They also incorporated real-world rituals into the narrative, such the tradition of the kora (circling a sacred site before entering). This research took place during the pre-production period. The music was composed by Darren Lambourne, who also acted as sound director. His music reflected the harsh environment, religious elements and darker themes. To present these themes, Lambourne deliberately mingled the music with the in-game sound effects. He acquired several musical instruments native to the region and incorporated them both into the score and the environmental sound. He also incorporated Tibetan chanting. To create the right environmental feel, Lambourne blended musical instruments and ghost vocals with the sound effects in several areas, aiming to avoid \\"Hollywood cliches\\" and use the environment to evoke tension. The voice recording with done in London, with all the actors being either English or Scottish to fit in with the team's narrative wishes. The game was designed using \\"Athena\\", a proprietary game engine created by Sproing to display complex and higher-quality graphic and environment effects on the Wii. The team aimed to make all elements, from the environment to the ghosts, as realistic as possible to promote player immersion. Each level had to be unique, showing changes in scenery and architecture as Eric climbed higher up the mountain. The team also wanted the entire trek up the mountain to be visible from either end of the path, something difficult to achieve on Wii. A production challenge was the scale of levels; their original designs were larger, but due to hardware limitations were reduced in size. An early wish was to make sure the various gameplay elements (exploration, survival, combat) were balanced with each other so it would not become dominated by any single element. Originally, the shooting mechanics were non-existent, with the motion-based prayer gestures being the only combat mechanic. Due to tester feedback, the team implemented the pickaxe-based combat. The gestures used by to banish ghosts were based on the real-world concept of mantras. Using mantras as a base, the team incorporated both familiar and \\"innovative\\" gameplay elements. The gesture system was intended to open up a player's body language and make them face their fears while defeating ghosts. The team also incorporated level-specific gimmicks that would use the Wii control features. Release Cursed Mountain was announced in July 2008 at the Leipzig Games Convention. The title was shown off at E3 2009. The game was notable due to its platform choice and mature content, as the Wii was better known for family-oriented titles. The beta version was completed by March the following year; while the base game was complete, balance and lighting adjustments continued until release. In the run-up to release, it had relatively little marketing support. It released in North America on 25 August 2009. It went on to release in Europe on 4 September, and in Australia on 15 October. A limited edition was released at launch, including a double-sided disc including a documentary on the game and the complete soundtrack. A release for Windows was indicated in mid-2009 by a leaked ESRB rating for the platform. The port was released by Deep Silver on 5 February 2010 as a European exclusive. Cursed Mountain was the only title developed by Deep Silver Vienna before its closure by parent company Koch Media in February 2010 due to what they described as \\"the current overall economic situation\\"; the studio's second in-development title Ride to Hell was transferred to another studio. Reception Upon release, Cursed Mountain saw a mixed reaction from journalists, with many praising its atmosphere and faulting its controls. Review aggregate site Metacritic gave it a normalised score of 67 out of 100, indicating \\"mixed or average\\" reviews. Eurogamers Keza MacDonald praised the setting as the game's best feature. Kevin VanOrd, writing for GameSpot, lauded its authentic use of local folklore and cited the narrative as one of the strong points of the game. GameTrailers found the narrative lacking, citing its weakness as a detrimental factor in completing the game. IGNs Matt Casamassina cited the narrative as \\"unique\\" due to its setting and tone. James Newton of Nintendo Life lauded the narrative and setting, Randy Nelson of Nintendo Power called the story \\"interesting\\", while Nintendo World Reports Lukasz Balicki enjoyed the Himalayan setting and folklore while noting uneven pacing. Fred Dutton of Official Nintendo Magazine praised the setting as innovative compared to other horror titles but found the story confusing without additional texts found through levels. PALGNs Jeremy Jastrzab called the setting and narrative \\"superbly put together\\". The general aesthetic was enjoyed by MacDonald, but she faulted the character animations as outdated and overuse of fog effects. VanOrd echoed the criticism of the fog effect during combat, while GameTrailers felt that the level design and aesthetics were a minor advantage compared to other elements such as the cutscene design. Casamassina generally liked the art and environment design, citing a few set pieces that impressed him. Newton praised the voice acting and cited the game as one of the best- looking titles on the platform. By contrast Nelson faulted the voice acting, while Balicki rated the sound design as one of the game's strong points. Dutton praised the \\"excellent\\" sound design, and Jastrzab noted its strong art direction and aesthetics. MacDonald enjoyed some of the gameplay ideas, but faulted the lack of innovation or challenge. VanOrd enjoyed the combat when it functioned properly, but cited frustrating repetition in the gameplay structure. GameTrailers noted the gameplay as enjoyable in places, but found its style broke the game's atmosphere. Casamassina found the gameplay interesting, but faulted the level design as archaic. Newton was disappointed with the traditional button-based combat mechanics following the pre-release emphasis on motion controls. Nelson noted a lack of variety and growing fatigue as the game progressed, while Balicki noted its unique approach to the survival horror genre despite difficult movement controls. Jastrzab faulted the lack of innovation in gameplay and lack of collectables, but otherwise praised the experience. A common complaint from all reviewers was a lack of responsiveness from the motion controls, with a few saying they were unusable at some points. Reviewing the Windows port in 2013, John Coxsey of website Adventure Classic Gaming was generally positive and gave it a score of three out of five stars. In addition to echoing praise of the narrative and atmosphere, he noted the slight graphical upgrade and wider colour pallate compared to the Wii original. His main complain was a lack of content and the game's short length, and he also noted that its deeper spiritual elements would be lost on most players.

It lies approximately north-east of Piątnica, north-east of Łomża, and west of the regional capital Białystok. History Jeziorko was founded in the early 15th century, and was mentioned in a document from 1426. It was a private village of Polish nobility, administratively located in the Masovian Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown. In the Third Partition of Poland (1795), it was annexed by Prussia. In 1807 it was regained by Poles and included within the newly established but short-lived Duchy of Warsaw, and in 1815 it passed to the Russian Partition of Poland. 19th-century owners from the Rzętkowski family took part in the Polish November and January Uprisings against Russia. The village suffered during both World War I, after which in 1918 Poland regained independence, and the Polish–Soviet War,Agresja sowiecka na Polskę i okupacja wschodnich terenów Rzeczypospolitej 1939–1941, IPN, Białystok-Warszawa, 2019, p. 182 (in Polish) during which it was a site of a battle. In interwar Poland a landscape park was founded around the local manor house of the Schirmer family. After the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II, the village was occupied by the Soviet Union from 1939 to 1941, and then by Nazi Germany from 1941 to 1944. Owner of the Jeziorko manor, Wacław Schirmer, was arrested and deported to forced labour by the Soviets in 1939, and probably later murdered in 1941, while his family managed to escape and hide in Warsaw in the German-occupied part of Poland. The manor was devastated. The Germans carried out three massacres of Poles in the Jeziorko forest (see Nazi crimes against the Polish nation). In 1942, they murdered 60 residents of a nursing home from Pieńki Borowe, in June 1943 they murdered 62 people who had previously been imprisoned in Łomża, and in July 1943 they murdered 52 members of Łomża's intelligentsia. Some of the victims have not been identified, because in 1944 the Germans burned the victims' bodies in attempt to cover up the crime. Despite such circumstances, the Polish resistance movement was active in Jeziorko, and even organized secret Polish education, established a secret printing house and issued underground Polish press. The Germans deported several Poles to Nazi concentration camps. In 1944 the village was restored to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which retained power until the 1989 Fall of Communism. (1908–1957), notable member of the local Polish resistance movement in World War II, was born and lived in the village. He was killed in Jeziorko as one of the last partisans of the anti-communist resistance in Poland. A memorial to him was unveiled in Jeziorko 2007. In 2009, President of Poland Lech Kaczyńśki, posthumously awarded him with the Grand Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta, one of Poland's highest state decorations.

Kaleldo is a Kapampangan term for summer.  Plot  The story is set in Guagua, Pampanga a decade after the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo which ravaged the province with lahar. It follows the lives of Rodolfo \\"Mang Rudy\\" Manansala, a woodcarver, and his three daughters and their relationships with the people close to them in the span of seven summers. Grace, the youngest daughter, marries the mama's boy Conrad, and has to face the reality of leaving the ancestral house, to which she is deeply rooted, to go and live with her in-laws. Much against her will, to the point of staging an escape, she yields to the dictates of tradition. Yet she manages to cope up with married life, and on the fourth year of her marriage gets pregnant with her second child. Lourdes, the middle daughter and married to the weakling Andy Pineda with whom she has a daughter, goes into an illicit affair with a bank manager, for which reason Mang Rudy succumbs to a heart attack and becomes bedridden. For a while numbed by the infidelity of his wife, Andy later realizes his insignificance and retaliates by beating up and nearly killing Lourdes. Lourdes atones for her guilt by ministering to Andy's wounds after he joins the rituals of the flagellants during the Holy Week. However, they both decide to separate. Jess, the eldest daughter, is a lesbian whose bitter luck in life is being unwanted by her own father. Yet she serves Mang Rudy to the hilt after he gets bedridden and makes the common sense of allowing her girlfriend Rowena to move in at the Manansala house, not so much for their own convenience as lovers but for Rowena to help in looking after Mang Rudy and in helping out with the household chores. But when a conflict arises between Lourdes and Rowena, Mang Rudy sends Rowena away. A year later, Mang Rudy succumbs to a second attack and when he dies several months later, Rowena sets foot on the ancestral house once more to pay her last respects. At the wake, Rowena comes to the realization that, like Andy, she never belonged and finally decides to leave Jess. Rowena gets married while Jess, along with her sisters, moves on with life. The story is told in three segments, with each segment told from the point of view of the three daughters. Attached to each segment are social occasion popularly observed in the province of Pampanga in the Philippines, with a symbolic motif for each, represented by the elements sun, fire, water, air, blood, moon and earth. With Rowena's wedding at the end of the film, as in Grace's wedding at the start, a full cycle of life transpired.

Critical commentary and analysis After the American Repertory Theater's world premier of Ribman's \\"Sweet Table at the Richelieu,\\" Jonathan Marks identified a central theme in Ribman's work as having \\"a preoccupation with the persistence of the past in the present—a recognition that we all carry with us a heavy baggage of seeds, each of which began sprouting at a different time in the past, and never stopped shooting out tendrils: a bag of memories which can never be simply dumped.\\" reprinted in American Theater, July/August 1987.

His debut novel, The White Tiger, won the 2008 Man Booker Prize. Biography=Early life and education Aravind Adiga was born in Madras (now Chennai) on 23 October 1974 to Dr. K. Madhava Adiga and Usha Adiga, both of whom hailed from Mangalore. His paternal grandfather was the late K. Suryanarayana Adiga, former chairman of Karnataka Bank, and a maternal great- grandfather, U. Rama Rao, a popular medical practitioner and Congress politician from Madras. Adiga grew up in Mangalore and studied at Canara High School, then at St. Aloysius College, where he completed his SSLC in 1990 and secured the first place in his state in SSLC (his elder brother, Anand, had placed second in SSLC and first in PUC in the state). After emigrating to Sydney, Australia, with his family, Aravind studied at James Ruse Agricultural High School. He later studied English literature at Columbia College of Columbia University, in New York city, under Simon Schama, and graduated as salutatorian in 1997.At Last! Commencement For More than 8,900 Today. Columbia University Record. MAY 21, 1997 He also studied at Magdalen College, Oxford, where one of his tutors was Hermione Lee. Career Aravind Adiga began his journalistic career as a financial journalist, interning at the Financial Times. With pieces published in the Financial Times and Money, he covered the stock market and investment, interviewing, among others, Donald Trump. Adiga's review of previous Booker Prize winner Peter Carey's 1988 book, Oscar and Lucinda, appeared in The Second Circle, an online literary review.The Second Circle Adiga was subsequently hired by TIME, where he remained a South Asia correspondent for three years before going freelance.Adiga is the first current or former TIME staffer to win the Man Booker Prize, or its predecessor, the Booker Prize. During this freelance period, he wrote The White Tiger. He now lives in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.\\"OSCAR AND LUCINDA by Peter Carey, reviewed by Aravind Adiga\\", The Second Circle. Booker Prize Adiga's debut novel, The White Tiger, won the 2008 Booker Prize. He is the fourth Indian-born author to win the prize, after Salman Rushdie, Arundhati Roy, and Kiran Desai. (V. S. Naipaul, another winner, is ethnically Indian but was born on the Caribbean island of Trinidad.) The five other authors on the shortlist included one other Indian writer (Amitav Ghosh) and another first-time writer (Steve Toltz). The novel studies the contrast between India's rise as a modern global economy and the lead character, Balram, who comes from crushing rural poverty. Adiga explained that \\"criticism by writers like Flaubert, Balzac and Dickens of the 19th century helped England and France become better societies\\". Shortly after he won the prize, it was alleged that Adiga had, the previous year, sacked the agent who had secured his contract with Atlantic Books at the 2007 London Book Fair. In April 2009, it was announced that the novel would be adapted into a feature film.Kay, Jeremy (15 April 2009), \\"Smuggler, Ascension acquire 2008 Mann Booker winner White Tiger\\", Screen Daily. Propelled mainly by the Booker Prize win, The White Tigers Indian hardcover edition sold more than 200,000 copies.\\"Boom time for English-language books in India\\", The Hindu, 4 March 2010.  Academic criticism  According to Ana Cristina Mendes (2010), The White Tiger falls prey to \\"inauthenticity\\": Adiga a well-read Indian author who writes in English, having been educated at Oxford and Columbia – errs on the side of an unconvincing colloquialism by making his characters speak a language of the Indian underground, which he himself masters only to a certain extent. The novel is described as a first-person bildungsroman and placed within the wider context of contemporary Indian writing in English, as a novel about \\"the Darkness\\" (which reminds us of Dickens's London) and a fascinating success story about the overnight rise of one character from rags to riches, but also about India’s development as a global market economy. Mendes (2010) notices in this a certain artificiality, cleverly masked by irony, and remarks the “'cardboard cut-out' title character equipped with an inauthentic voice that ultimately undermines issues of class politics\\" (p. 277). Pakistani blogger Sarmad Iqbal reviewed Adiga's The White Tiger for International Policy Digest, saying: \\"This novel in multiple ways was an eye opener for me about the rising India as being a Pakistani I grew up listening to and learning nothing good about India. As I got acquainted with all the dark secrets of a rising India divulged by Adiga in this novel, I came across several astonishing similarities between what goes in the 'enemy state' I knew from my childhood and my own country Pakistan.\\" Other academics find the book to be a fascinating assessment of the ongoing development of India as a nation, written with a manner of direct honesty, humour and frankness few authors can harness when attempting to evaluate their own nations. Adiga provides readers with a broad perspective on the ancient ideas of historic India as they contrast with the last 120 years of rapid societal change and advancement. Readers who have spent significant periods of time in India can glean essential insights from the book while appreciating the author's firsthand knowledge of the subtleties of the diverse and intoxicating cast of people that make India such an interesting place, be it tragic or breathtaking.  Other works  Adiga's second book, Between the Assassinations, was released in India in November 2008 and in the US and UK in mid-2009; twelve interlinked short stories comprise this book. His second novel and third published book, Last Man in Tower, was published in the UK in 2011. His third novel, Selection Day, was published on 8 September 2016.

Two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2D IR) is a nonlinear infrared spectroscopy technique that has the ability to correlate vibrational modes in condensed-phase systems. This technique provides information beyond linear infrared spectra, by spreading the vibrational information along multiple axes, yielding a frequency correlation spectrum. A frequency correlation spectrum can offer structural information such as vibrational mode coupling, anharmonicities, along with chemical dynamics such as energy transfer rates and molecular dynamics with femtosecond time resolution. 2DIR experiments have only become possible with the development of ultrafast lasers and the ability to generate femtosecond infrared pulses. Systems studied Among the many systems studied with infrared spectroscopy are water, metal carbonyls, short polypeptides, proteins, perovskite solar cells, and DNA oligomers. Experimental approaches There are two main approaches to two-dimensional spectroscopy, the Fourier-transform method, in which the data is collected in the time-domain and then Fourier-transformed to obtain a frequency-frequency 2D correlation spectrum, and the frequency domain approach in which all the data is collected directly in the frequency domain. Time domain The time-domain approach consists of applying two pump pulses. The first pulse creates a coherence between the vibrational modes of the molecule and the second pulse creates a population, effectively storing information in the molecules. After a determined waiting time, ranging from a zero to a few hundred picoseconds, an interaction with a third pulse again creates a coherence, which, due to an oscillating dipole, radiates an infrared signal. The radiated signal is heterodyned with a reference pulse in order to retrieve frequency and phase information; the signal is usually collected in the frequency domain using a spectrometer yielding detection frequency \\\\omega_3. A two-dimensional Fourier-transform along \\\\omega_1 then yields a (\\\\omega_1, \\\\omega_3) correlation spectrum. In all these measurements phase stability among the pulses has to be preserved. Recently, pulse shaping approaches were developed to simplify overcoming this challenge. Frequency domain Similarly, in the frequency-domain approach, a narrowband pump pulse is applied and, after a certain waiting time, then a broadband pulse probes the system. A 2DIR correlation spectrum is obtained by plotting the probe frequency spectrum at each pump frequency. Spectral interpretation Schematic of a 2D IR spectrum. The red circles correspond to bleaching of the ground state. The blue circles correspond to absorption of the excited state. The smaller off-diagonal circles to coupling between the two states. The linear absorption (FTIR) spectrum is indicated above the 2D IR spectrum. The two peaks in the 1D spectrum reveal no information on coupling between the two states. After the waiting time in the experiment, it is possible to reach double excited states. This results in the appearance of an overtone peak. The anharmonicity of a vibration can be read from the spectra as the distance between the diagonal peak and the overtone peak. One obvious advantage of 2DIR spectra over normal linear absorption spectra is that they reveal the coupling between different states. This for example, allows for the determination of the angle between the involved transition dipoles. The true power of 2DIR spectroscopy is that it allows following dynamical processes such as chemical exchange, motional narrowing, vibrational population transfer, and molecular reorientation on the sub-picosecond time scale. It has for example been used successfully to study hydrogen bond forming and breaking and to determine the transition state geometry of a structural rearrangement in an iron carbonyl compound. Spectral interpretation can be successfully assisted with developed theoretical methods. Currently, two freely available packages exists for modeling 2D IR spectra. These are the SPECTRON developed by the Mukamel group (University of California, Irvine) and the NISE program developed by the Jansen group (University of Groningen). Solvent effect The consideration of the solvent effect has been shown to be crucial in order to effectively describe the vibrational coupling in solution, since the solvent modify both vibrational frequencies, transition probabilities and couplings. Computer simulations can reveal the spectral signatures arising from solvent degrees of freedom and their change upon water reorganization.

It is around 5 times more potent than cocaine at inhibiting monoamine reuptake in vitro, but is relatively unselective. It binds to all three monoamine transporters, although still with some selectivity for the dopamine transporter. RTI-126 has a fast onset of effects and short duration of action, and its pharmacological profile in animals is among the closest to cocaine itself out of all the drugs in the RTI series. Its main application in scientific research has been in studies investigating the influence of pharmacokinetics on the abuse potential of stimulant drugs, with its rapid entry into the brain thought to be a key factor in producing its high propensity for development of dependence in animals.

This photograph was taken in 1934, the dwelling was subsequently destroyed. Note the split-shingle roof and stick-and-mud chimney. The dogtrot, also known as a breezeway house, dog- run, or possum-trot, is a style of house that was common throughout the Southeastern United States during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Some theories place its origins in the southern Appalachian Mountains. Some scholars believe the style developed in the post-Revolution frontiers of Kentucky and Tennessee. Others note its presence in the South Carolina Lowcountry from an early period. The main style point was a large breezeway through the center of the house to cool occupants in the hot southern climate. Architects continue to build dogtrot houses using modern materials, but maintaining the original design.  Design  Urban variation of a \\"dog-trot\\": Creole cottage row house with narrow dogtrot, New OrleansA dogtrot house historically consisted of two log cabins connected by a breezeway or \\"dogtrot\\", all under a common roof. Typically, one cabin was used for cooking and dining, while the other was used as a private living space, such as a bedroom. The primary characteristics of a dogtrot house is that it is typically one story (although -story and more rare two-story examples survive), has at least two rooms averaging between wide that each flank an open-ended central hall. Additional rooms usually take the form of a semidetached ell or shed flanking the hall, most commonly at the rear. Enclosed shed rooms are also sometimes found at the front, although a shed- roof front porch is the most common form. The breezeway through the center of the house is a unique feature, with rooms of the house opening into the breezeway. The breezeway provided a cooler covered area for sitting. The combination of the breezeway and open windows in the rooms of the house created air currents which pulled cooler outside air into the living quarters efficiently in the pre-air conditioning era. Secondary characteristics of the dogtrot house includes placement of the chimneys, staircases, and porches. Chimneys were almost always located at each gable end of the house, with each serving one of the two main rooms. If the house was 1½ or the rarer two stories, the necessary staircase was usually at least partially enclosed or boxed in. The stairway was most commonly placed in one or both of the main rooms, although it was sometimes placed in the open hallway. Although some houses had only the open central hall and flanking rooms, most dogtrots had full-width porches to the front and/or rear.

The house was designated as a county seat and courthouse in 1825 by the territorial legislature. Around 1855, Colonel Randolph D. Casey built the Casey House, currently the oldest existing house in Mountain Home. The home is currently maintained by the Baxter County Historical and Genealogical Society. Kentucky In 1800, Jacob Eversole, of what is now Perry County, Kentucky, constructed an addition to the one-room cabin he had erected in 1789, creating a two-story dogtrot home.

Intersubjective psychoanalysis suggests that all interactions must be considered contextually; interactions between the patient/analyst or child/parent cannot be seen as separate from each other, but rather must be considered always as mutually influencing each other. This philosophical concept dates back to \\"German Idealism\\" and phenomenology. The myth of isolated mind Trends in intersubjective psychoanalysis have accused traditional or classical psychoanalysis of having described psychic phenomena as \\"the myth of isolated mind\\" (i.e. coming from within the patient).

Stamps of Joseon dynasty Joseon issued its own first stamps on 18 November 1884 when the first postal service was created. While five values were printed - 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 mon, only the 5m and 10m values were issued, and even these saw little use, as the post office was burned down during a revolt in December 1884. The next series of stamps did not appear until 1895, and consisted of four values: 5, 10, 25, and 50 poon, all of the same design featuring a taegeuk symbol. They were overprinted \\"Dae Han\\" in 1897, and surcharged to 1 poon in 1900. Stamps of Korean Empire A currency change in 1900, to rin, cheun, and {[translkorweun}}, necessitated new stamps, and accordingly a series of 13 was issued, with values ranging from 2 rin to 2 . While all the designs have a common theme of the taegeuk symbol, the frames are different for each value, and the three highest values are printed in two colors each. In 1902 five of these were surcharged using black handstamps. Korea issued its first commemorative stamp on 18 October 1902, marking the 40th anniversary of the reign of Emperor Gojong. The orange stamp depicted the emperor's crown. The last stamps of the Empire were another series of 13 issued in 1910, with all stamps of a common depicting a falcon symbol. However, in 1910, Japan assumed administrative control of Korean Empire, and subsequently all mail used Japanese Chosēn stamps. This state of affairs continued until early 1945 after liberation.

This was the first of a planned series of resorts throughout Princess Louisa Inlet. The club opened in July 1941, but its operations were suspended until the end of World War II in 1945.Hitz 2003, p. 94–102 From that point until 1950, the facility was open as a premium resort. Visitors included John Wayne, Senator John F. Kennedy, Barbara Stanwyck, Bing Crosby, and Bob Hope. The club faced financial problems due to the limited transportation access and the limited two-month window of good weather. In 1948, a polio death and related quarantine further damaged business prospects. Hamilton's Malibu Club was closed in 1950.Hitz 2003, p. 121–123 Young Life, a Christian association, agreed to purchase the facilities from Hamilton in December 1953Hitz 2003, p. 137 and has operated the Malibu Club facility since.

Origins Born about 1360, he was the second son and heir of Sir Marmaduke Lumley (1314-1365), a landowner and administrator in Northumberland, and his second wife Margaret, daughter of Robert Holland, 2nd Baron Holand. Career Under the age of majority at the death of his father in 1365 and of his elder brother Robert in 1374, his guardian was John Nevill. In 1383 he received his inherited lands and had already embarked on a military career, being knighted and holding for ransom a number of French prisoners of war. The next year he was summoned to Parliament as a baron and in 1385 was under the command of Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, fighting the Scots in the defence of Berwick-upon- Tweed. At the Battle of Otterburn in August 1388, he was taken prisoner by the Scots, not being freed until October 1389 after payment of a sizeable ransom, toward which both King Richard and the Bishop of Durham contributed. In 1391 he was appointed Captain of Berwick and in 1392 received royal permission to rebuild and crenellate his castle at Lumley. In 1394 and 1397 he was on the commission of the peace for the North Riding of Yorkshire and in 1397 attended the Parliament at which all members had to swear loyalty to King Richard. In the Parliament of September 1399 he accepted the seizure of power by King Henry IV and the imprisonment of Richard, but in December joined his cousin Thomas Holland, 1st Duke of Surrey, in the conspiracy known as the Epiphany Rising, which aimed to murder Henry and restore Richard. He was one of the conspirators captured and beheaded at Cirencester in January 1400. All his moveable possessions were given to the King's half-brother John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset, and his estates were forfeited to the crown, apart from lands yielding 100 pounds a year left to support his widow and twelve children. Family He married Eleanor (died after 1441), third daughter of his guardian John Nevill and his first wife Maud, daughter of Henry Percy, 2nd Baron Percy. Their children included: *Thomas (died 1400), implicated in his father's treason. *Sir John (1383–1421), whose son Sir Thomas obtained a reversal of his grandfather's attainder in 1461. *Marmaduke (died 1450), Cambridge-educated bishop and Lord High Treasurer of England (1446-1449). *Catherine (died 1461), who before 1425 married Sir John Chideock, of Chideock in Dorset. *Elizabeth, who married Adam Tyrwhitt, of Kettleby in Lincolnshire.

The museum contains the most complete collection of Javanese artifacts, after the National Museum in Jakarta. In addition to ceramics of the Neolithic era and bronze sculptures from the 8th century, the museum also includes collections of wayang (shadow puppets), various ancient weapons (such as keris), and Javanese masks. The Sonobudoyo Museum consists of two units, with Unit I located at Jalan Trikora No. 6 Yogyakarta, and Unit II located at Ndalem Condrokiranan, Wijilan, to the east of main (northern) alun-alun in the city. The museum also features nightly wayang and gamelan performances on weekdays, primarily for foreign and domestic tourists.  History  The Java Instituut was a foundation established in 1919 in Surakarta for the study of the cultures of Java, Madura, Bali, and Lombok. In 1924, the Java Instituut held a congress in Surakarta to establish a museum with collections from the regions of Java, Madura, Bali, and Lombok. On November 6, 1935, the Sonobudoyo Museum was inaugurated and opened to the public, with the word sono meaning \\"place\\" and budoyo meaning \\"culture\\" in Javanese. In 1939, in order to support and complement the business of the Java Instituut, the Kunstambacht School or Sekolah Kerajinan Seni Ukir (Carving Arts and Crafts School) was opened. Towards the end of 1974, the Sonobudoyo Museum was handed over to the Ministry of Education and Culture and became directly responsible to the Directorate General in 2000. The Sonobudoyo Museum joined the Provincial Office of Culture and Tourism of Yogyakarta in 2001. NotesFurther reading * Behrend, T.E. ed., Katalog Induk Naskah-naskah Nusantara.

The second largest island in Lake Superior, Michipicoten Island is long and wide at its widest point. Most of the lands of Michipicoten Island, as well as smaller islands, shoals, and waters which surround it to within , were regulated as Michipicoten Island Provincial Park in 1985.http://www.ebr.gov.on.ca/ERS-WEB- External/displaynoticecontent.do?noticeId=MjAzMDM=&statusId;=MjAzMDM=http://scans.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/4/42/v1ontarioregulat1985ontauoft/v1ontarioregulat1985ontauoft.pdf Despite attempts to develop a comprehensive park management plan in the early- to mid-2000s,https://www.ebr.gov.on.ca/ERS-WEB- External/displaynoticecontent.do?noticeId=MjAzMDM=&statusId;=MjAzMDM=&language;=en it continues to be administered by Ontario Parkshttps://www.ontarioparks.com/park/michipicotenisland under an interim management statement developed in 1986.https://www.ontario.ca/page/michipicoten-island-provincial-park- management-statement During the spring, summer, and fall, the island is inhabited or regularly visited by the owners of camps located on a small number of private inholdings, commercial fishers, and clients of a commercial outpost camp.https://www.hawkair.com/outpost-camps/michi.html It has become a destination for some adventurous kayakers. In the winter, due mainly to reasons of remoteness and difficulty of access, the island is usually uninhabited. Michipicoten Island has plentiful wildlife (notably beaver, woodland caribou, and birds). It is located in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Forest region.http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/pubwarehouse/pdfs/24040.pdf The island is made up of ancient lava bedrock related to volcanism of the Midcontinent Rift System and is heavily forested, with over 20 inland lakes. It has a rugged interior, containing east-west aligned ridges with gentle southern slopes and steep northern slopes. The highest point is above Lake Superior. A lighthouse was established in 1912 on the eastern end of the island. It was staffed until 1988.http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=1554 On some old maps, Michipicoten Island is shown as Isle Maurepas, after the French minister of Marine Jean-Frédéric Phélypeaux, Count of Maurepas. The word Michipicoten is an Anglicization of the original Ojibwe word Mishipikwadina, meaning \\"big bluffs\\" in Ojibwe, and is a reference to the geography of the nearby Michipicoten River. Mishipeshu, a powerful creature in the mythological beliefs of some Native American tribes―particularly Anishinaabe tribes, the Odawa, Ojibwe, and Potawatomi, of the Great Lakes region of Canada and the United States―is traditionally said to make his home on Michipicoten Island.Conway, Thor (2010). Spirits in Stone. Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario: Heritage Discoveries.Kohl, Johann (1859). Kitchi-Gami: Life Among the Lake Superior Ojibway. . Woodland caribou Michipicoten Island played host to an indigenous caribou population until the herd's extirpation, as a result of overhunting, in the mid-1800s. In 1981, a lone male caribou was observed on the island; how it arrived there remains unknown. In 1982, additional caribou - one male, three adult females and three female calves - were moved to the island from the Slate Islands by the Ministry of Natural Resources. An additional male was translocated in 1989. From the time of these relocations to 2001, the herd population increased at \\\\lambda=1.18 to arrive at approximately 160 animals in 2001. A population determination performed in 2011 concluded that the herd had grown to 680 animals. At times, the rate of population growth was among the fastest ever recorded for caribou.https://knowledgecommons.lakeheadu.ca/bitstream/2453/402/1/KuchtaB2012m.pdf In the winter of 2014, four wolves transited to Michipicoten Island. This was facilitated by an ice bridge which had formed between the island and the mainland.https://web.archive.org/web/20170905050646/http://twsconference.org/sessions/conservation- and-ecology-of-mammals-carnivores/ The wolf population had more than tripled by the winter of 2016/2017. The 2017/2018 wolf population count is anticipated to reveal approximately 20 wolves present on the island.http://northernwilds.com/wolves-isle-royale-michipicoten-island/ The decline in the caribou population as resulting from the presence of the wolves has raised the concern that the caribou population is in danger of extirpation as soon as the winter of 2017/2018.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/northern-ontario-caribou- eaten-by-wolves-1.4268034 The caribou population of Michipicoten Island is scientifically significant because it manifests an opportunity to apply A. T. Bergerud's proposed test to assess the viability of the range hypothesis versus the predation hypothesis for providing a credible explanation for caribou population decline. Adapted to Michipicoten Island, Bergerud's proposed test was two-part: First, the caribou population on Michipicoten Island should increase despite the lack of lichen in the island's Great Lakes/St. Lawrence Forest. This happened, and it indicated that lichen was not a critical requirement in the diet of caribou. Second, after the appearance of wolves, the population of caribou should decline. Should these population trends emerge, it would indicate conclusively that wolf predation, and not a lack of lichen as forwarded by the range hypothesis, was a key factor in the decline of caribou throughout North America. The caribou population of Michipicoten Island is ecologically significant because it and the Slate Islands caribou population are all that conclusively and verifiably remain of a caribou population which was once found throughout the federally-recognized ON6 Lake Superior caribou range.http://www.registrelep- sararegistry.gc.ca/virtual_sara/files/plans/rs%5Fcaribou%5Fboreal%5Fcaribou%5F0912%5Fe1%2Epdf Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry/Parks Canada 2016 caribou populations surveys failed to conclusively observe any caribou remaining in the lands along the north shore of Lake Superior. As of March 2019 all of the remaining caribou and wolves had been moved off of the island due to the low remaining population of caribou.https://globalnews.ca/news/5094395/wolves- michipicoten-island/ A pack of eight of the wolves were translocated to Isle Royale in 2018.

Commonly, alun-alun in modern-day Indonesia refers only to the two large open squares of kraton palace compounds. Each kraton has two alun-alun: the most important and northern alun-alun lor and the less important and commonly smaller southern alun-alun kidul. The court of Pakubuwana in Surakarta is unique as it incorporates the alun-alun kidul within the defensive wall of the kraton proper.Studies in Indonesian archaeology, By Willem F Stutterheim, Netherlands Institute for International Cultural Relations and M.

Javanese officials and commoners alike had to dismount carriages and horses before entering the alun-alun lor to continue to the kraton. At the two centrally located holy beringin or banyan trees, officials had their payung (ceremonial parasols indicating office), placed down by their parasol valet. Ordinary commoner Javanese seeking an audience with the Regent would be required to sit and wait under the trees waiting for an official to leave the Kraton and ask their reason for an audience. Dutch officials such as the Resident were commonly received with great ceremony to the alun-alun lor with the kraton soldiers firing three volleys, which would be answered by a twenty-one gun salute from the Dutch fortress, especially between the Yogyakarta kraton and the Dutch Fort VredeburgCephas, Yogyakarta: Photography in the Service of the Sultan, G. J. Knaap, Yudhi Soerjoatmodjo, KITLV Press: 1999, 136 pp, : p. 3 Architectural convention Strict rules govern the location of buildings surrounding the alun-alun lor. The main mosque must be cited on the west side and hence correctly face east (to Mecca). The official residence of the Regent's \\"Patih\\", also Bupati (town or village head) was situated on the North or South. East is generally reserved for shops, markets, or houses of prominent families. Two enormous Pacikra or Pacikeran doors conventionally separate the high defensive perimeter wall surrounding the kraton and the alun-alun. The gladak or pradah compound for stables, porters and draught horses was stationed outside the north gate of the alun-alun, presumably for practicality for disembarking officials and to keep the smell of horses and manure as far as possible from the kraton.Java and modern Europe: ambiguous encounters, Ann Kumar, Routledge 1993, 472 pp.: , pp. 319–320, 360 Historical function The alun-alun lor also historically functioned for a place for public corporal punishments and executions. Condemned criminals were publicly executed by krissing (using a keris to stab the condemned from the left shoulder blade downward into the heart) beside the enclosed banyan trees of the alun-alun lor. For especially heinous criminals, most especially traitors and vicious brigands the condemned's head would be impaled on a pike as a macabre public warning The alun-alun lor functioned and continues to function as centre for public spectacles, court celebrations and general non-court entertainment. The Javanese festivals of Garebeganan and Sekaten great fairs were held here, as they are still held today, with the spectacle of huge mountains of rice exiting the kraton for blessings at the mosque and distributed to the people in the alun-alun lor. Occasionally a social and entertainment spectacle of a tiger and buffalo fight would be held, though from Sultan Hamengkubawana VII onward these were rare, as the Yogyakarta court tigers were incredibly useful for public sanitation as they were fed a diet of stray dogs.'Karaton Surakarta: A Look Into the Court of Surakarta Hadiningrat, Central Java By Paku Buwono, A. Mutholi'in Marshall Cavendish Edition 2006: 411 pages, , pp. 22–31 The alun-alun lor was the only place where the Sultan would conduct dialogue with his people, and functioned to show his humanity and humility.The Kraton: Selected Essays on Javanese Courts, Stuart O. Robson and Rosemary Robson-McKillop, KITLV Press, 2003, 397 pp, , pp. 20, 42 The alun-lun kidul was more of a generic ground, principally for everyday mustering troops or servants and for exiting officials, servants and workers attending to mundane everyday business. Contemporary function In modern-day Yogyakarta, the alun-alun lor is now surrounded by shops and malls, frequently holding micro-business stalls and for youngsters to picnic on the grounds and consume their recently purchased take-away (take-out) food. The Yogyakarta kraton alun-alun kidul has two banyan trees in the centre famed, according to local folklore, to bring good luck to skillful enough to navigate their way between them without mishap, blindfolded and today on Friday and Saturday nights, youngsters boisterously pursue this fabled luck.Indonesian's Culture Heritages Portal. Alon-alon errata The transliteration of \\"alon alon\\" is erroneous Javanese. Possibly the accent of the Javanese speaker confused the scribe. The definition of alon alon is to progress slowly or cautiously, and well known within the modern Indonesian public sphere as the phrase \\"alon alon asal kelakon\\": \\"slowly and surely as long as it's [sic: task] done\\"- humorously amended to the very popular contemporary \\"alon alon asal kelakson\\": \\"slowly as long as you beep the horn\\" referencing Jakarta's infamous gridlock traffic.The Making of a Bureaucratic Elite: The Colonial Transformation of the Javanese Priyayi, Heather Sutherland: 182 pp. See also * Kraton * Pendhapa Further reading * Behrend, T.E.
