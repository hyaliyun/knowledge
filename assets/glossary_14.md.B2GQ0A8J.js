It was a media sensation which radically altered English perception of Australian cricketers and was hailed in years to come as \\"(the match which) marked the commencement of the modern era of cricket\\". Background The 1878 Australians (without W. E. Midwinter). Standing: F. R. Spofforth, J. Conway (manager), F. E. Allan. Centre: G. H. Bailey, T. P. Horan, T. W. Garrett, D. W. Gregory, A. Bannerman, H. F. Boyle. Front: C. Bannerman, W. L. Murdoch, J. McC. Blackham. Following the successful English tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1876–77, arrangements were made for a reciprocal tour of England by a team of \\"the best cricketers in the colonies\\", which became known as the \\"First Australians\\" (i.e., the first official Australian team to tour England).Knox, p. 11. The team members were John Conway (manager), W. C. V. Gibbes (assistant-manager), Dave Gregory (captain), Frank Allan, George Bailey, Alick Bannerman, Charles Bannerman, Jack Blackham (wicketkeeper), Harry Boyle, Tom Garrett, Tom Horan, Billy Midwinter, Billy Murdoch and Fred Spofforth. Apart from Midwinter, who was already in England, the team left Sydney on 29 March 1878 and sailed via Auckland and Honolulu to San Francisco, from where they travelled across America by train to New York City. They crossed the Atlantic, arriving in Liverpool on 13 May, and then went by train to Nottingham where they played their first match, starting on Monday, 20 May. This was a three-day match against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge and the Australians were well beaten by an innings and 14 runs, an inauspicious start which dampened much of the public enthusiasm that their visit had generated. The Australians were next due to play Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in a three-day match at Lord's, commencing on Monday, 27 May. In the meantime, Charles Bannerman and Billy Midwinter were invited to visit Dublin and play for the United South of England Eleven (USEE) against 15 past and present players of Dublin University. This was due to be played over three days, starting on Thursday, 23 May, at College Park. The USEE was captained by W. G. Grace and included his younger brother Fred. W. G. Grace and Bannerman scored just 11 and 1 respectively in the USEE first innings, while Fred Grace and Midwinter scored 46 and 64. The match was ruined by the weather and ended in a draw. On Sunday, 26 May, the USEE team caught the ferry back to England and W. G. Grace continued by train to London, probably in the company of Bannerman and Midwinter, as all three were due to take part in the match at Lord's the following day. They could not have guessed that the game would be remembered as \\"arguably the most momentous six hours in cricket history\\".Rae, p. 220. Monday, 27 May 1878 – MCC v Australians at Lord's 1878 was a \\"chilly and wet summer\\" in which the bad wickets reduced \\"all (batsmen) to comparative impotence\\" but enabled bowlers to dominate and cause \\"havoc\\" and that was certainly the case at Lord's on 27 May.Darwin, p. 58. CricketArchive states without elaboration that: \\"the match was scheduled for three days but completed in one\\". In the morning session, having won the toss, MCC were dismissed for 33 but then bowled out the Australians for 41. MCC hoped for a better total in the afternoon but were quickly dismissed again, this time for a mere 19. The Australians needed only 12 to win but, given the conditions, were by no means sure of getting them. They succeeded, losing only one wicket, and won a sensational match by 9 wickets. The match aggregate of 105 runs remains the lowest-ever in first-class cricket.Rae, p. 222.Webber, Playfair, p. 30. In his ghost-written Reminiscences (1899), W. G. Grace recalled that there had been \\"only four and a half hours of actual cricket\\" net of the lunch interval and breaks between innings. The MCC team, captained by W. G. Grace (Gloucestershire), was relatively strong with eight players who represented England during their careers. These were Grace himself, A. N. Hornby (Lancashire), A. J. Webbe (Middlesex), Wilfred Flowers (Nottinghamshire), George Hearne (Kent), George Vernon (Middlesex), Alfred Shaw (Nottinghamshire) and Fred Morley (Nottinghamshire). The other three, all recognised first-class players, were Nottinghamshire wicketkeeper Frederick Wyld and two amateur batsmen Clement Booth and Arthur Ridley (both Hampshire). The Australians were without Blackham so Murdoch took over as wicketkeeper. Their team in batting order was: Charles Bannerman, Midwinter, Horan, Alick Bannerman, Garrett, Spofforth, Gregory (captain), Boyle, Murdoch (wicketkeeper), Allan and Bailey. The umpires were Arnold Rylott and Mordecai Sherwin. Play started at three minutes past twelve on a \\"sticky wicket\\", a wet pitch drying out as the sun began to shine. Only a small crowd was present and it all began well enough for Grace as he hit the opening ball of the match from Allan for four. But another firm shot off his legs sent the second ball straight to Midwinter and Grace was \\"easily caught at square leg\\".Altham, p. 134. Another wicket fell to Boyle in the next over and MCC were 5 for two but, with Hornby and Ridley seemingly settling in, they pushed the total on to 27. Then there was a change of bowling and Spofforth came on instead of Allan. Spofforth's first spell at Lord's was \\"truly demonic\\". Within another 11 overs, MCC were all out, Spofforth taking 6 for four in just 5.3 overs including a hat-trick with the wickets of Hearne, Shaw and Vernon. Shaw and Morley took five wickets apiece as they dismissed the Australians for 41, the last wicket falling just before the lunch interval. In the afternoon session, Gregory decided to open his second innings attack with Spofforth and Boyle. The decisive moment was Spofforth's second ball to Grace, which clean bowled him for 0. The MCC innings lasted just 50 minutes, Boyle taking 6 for three and Spofforth 4 for sixteen. Spofforth's match analysis was 14.3 overs, five maidens, 20 runs, 10 wickets. As news of the proceedings spread, the crowd grew in the afternoon sunshine and, at the end, they \\"mobbed the Australians as they left the field in a spirit of non-partisan enthusiasm\\".Rae, pp. 220–221. Around 500 had been present at the start but the number grew to 4,742 by the end; the receipts of £119 7s were given to the Australians and MCC paid the expenses.Harte, p. 102.ACS, p. 98. So ended a \\"memorable day of cold and puddles and calamity\\". Impact and legacy Afterwards, the match was seized upon by the media and widely reported by the press.Altham, pp. 134–135. The news \\"spread like wildfire and created a sensation in London and throughout England\\". The satirical magazine Punch responded to the event by publishing a parody of Byron's poem The Destruction of Sennacherib including a wry commentary on Grace's contribution:Altham, p. 135. > The Australians came down like a wolf on the fold, > The Mary'bone Cracks for a trifle were bowled; > Our Grace before dinner was very soon done, > And Grace after dinner did not get a run. No one in England had taken the Australians very seriously at first, even though they had beaten James Lillywhite's England team in what was retrospectively classified as the inaugural Test match. No one was too surprised when they lost their tour opener by an innings to the strong Nottinghamshire attack of Shaw and Morley on a rain-affected wicket.Rae, pp. 219–220. This perception of Australian cricketers was immediately and permanently revised such that \\"henceforth a match between Australia and any representative English team would overshadow any of the 'great matches'\\".Rae, p. 221. Although the match did not mark the birth of international cricket, it was the point in time at which the English sporting public wholeheartedly embraced the concept. As Lord Hawke put it:Harte, p. 101. > (27 May 1878) this marked the commencement of the modern era of cricket. As for W. G. Grace, his whole approach to cricket was about what was needed to win the game in hand and he never took kindly to defeat. Two decades later, in his Reminiscences, he gave the Australians due credit for their \\"glorious victory\\".

In 1989 he was accepted to the American Film Institute’s Center for Advanced Film and Television Studies and moved to Los Angeles. He currently resides in Santa Monica. Career In 1994, Serling and his partner, Roland Seeman, developed and shot a half-hour series pilot in Yugoslavia. The purpose of the shoot was to shoot a pilot episode for a show concept profiling the lives and actions of Americans working for aid organizations around the world, and their prime goal was to profile American Red Cross volunteer Diane Paul based out of Zagreb, Croatia. During the shoot they met and included footage of Toby Wolf of the International Organization for Migration and Sonya Thompson, a representative of the US military whose job was to coordinate daily medevac. In 1995, after a year in post production, the project was completed and titled \\"American Heroes\\".

However, in making the rounds to networks, production companies and distributors with their pilot, they received cool receptions. One development executive wrote a rejection letter stating \\"We do not feel the marketplace can support a show about heroes at the current time\\", and others in 1995 responded, \\"We want sex and action\\", and \\"We are looking for the next People's Court, and \\"It sounds boring,\\" and \\"Hero shows just don't work\\". The rejection of a worthy concept caused Serling a bit of consternation, and he grudgingly quipped \\"Perhaps next time I'll produce a show called \\"Fallen American Heroes\\". In 1998, Los Angeles Times columnist and critic Howard Rosenberg shared that the pilot had aired on KCET and in praise of it wrote it was \\"a terrific concept for a weekly series\\" which \\"remains just a gleam in Serling's eye and an enriching series waiting to happen\\". The concept for Serling's Jam films was inspired by a 2002 incident where he and his writing partner Nicole Lonner were stuck in a traffic jam in upstate New York. The script for was completed in 2003 and, after obtaining financing, Serling shot the concept with principal photography completed in 2-1/2 days. The short film screened at the Method Fest Independent Film Festival in 2004, and debuted at The Other Venice Film Festival in 2005. Serling found that shooting the concept as a short before expanding into a feature allowed him to hone the script and concept to better create a marketable project. After obtaining financing for the feature-length version, Serling shot it over a 15-day period in 2006. The feature-length film made festival rounds before being licensed for release through Starz!, airing first on their TV channel and then being released on DVD through Anchor Bay Entertainment. =Filmography=Editor * Received Damaged a Black Flag band documentary) (1988) * American Heroes (1995) * The Making of 'Super Mario Brothers' (1997) * Modern Marvels (2 episodes, 1999-2000) * Survivor - Season Two: The Greatest and Most Outrageous Moments (2001) * Combat Missions (2002) * Survivor (58 episodes, 2000-2002) * American Idol (62 episodes, 2002-2003) * The Amazing Race (24 episodes, 2002-2003) * Mad Mad House (2004) * Jam (2004) (short film) * NASCAR Drivers: 360 * Jam (2006) * I Can Make You Thin with Paul McKenna (2008) * Hardcore Pawn (5 episodes, 2010-2011) * Kitchen Nightmares (27 episodes, 2010-2011) * Expedition Impossible (1 episode, 2011) * Police Women: Most Amazing Arrests (2011) * Undercover Stings (4 episodes, 2012) * Shark Week (1 episode, 2013) * Celebrity Wife Swap (1 episode, 2014) * The Unlikely's (2016) Producer * Received Damaged (1988) * Our Favorite Movies (1993) * American Heroes (1995) * The Making of 'Super Mario Brothers' (1997) * Jam (2004) (short film) * Jam (2006) * Mall Cops: Mall of America (12 episodes, 2009-2010) * Gator Boys (6 episodes, 2012) Director / screenwriter * Jam (2004) (short film) * Jam (2006) Recognition=Awards and nominations= * 1994, nominated for CableACE Award for 'Short-Form Programming Series' as producer of television series Our Favorite Movies * 2001, nominated for Primetime Emmy for 'Outstanding Picture Editing for Non-Fiction Programming' for Survivor * 2002, nominated for Primetime Emmy for 'Outstanding Picture Editing for Non- Fiction Programming' for Survivor * 2004, nominated for Primetime Emmy for 'Outstanding Picture Editing for Non-Fiction Programming' for The Amazing Race * 2006, won Independent Spirit Award as writer/director of Jam at Santa Fe Film Festival ReferencesExternal links * #1 * #2 * Category:1964 births Category:American film directors Category:Film producers from New York (state) Category:Television producers from New York (state) Category:Screenwriters from New York (state) Category:Living people Category:Businesspeople from Syracuse, New York Category:Writers from Syracuse, New York Category:American film editors ","title":"Craig E.

Until 1840, it paid an annual tribute of £443. History Banki was a zamindari state of Orissa located in the hilly area to the west of Cuttack district. The predecessor state had been ruled by a powerful Raja who in the 17th century had established the zamindari of Dompada as a gift to his second son.Dompada (Zamindari) The river Mahanadi flowed to the north of the state, separating it from Baramba and Tigiria. It was bound in the south by Puri district and in the west by Khandpara State; a little part of the state was located north of the Mahanadi. The state included 177 villages, the most important of which were Charchika, Baideswar, Kalapathar and Subarnapur. Banki became a British protectorate in 1807 following the defeat of the Maratha Empire in the area. In 1821 it was made part of the Feudatory States of Orissa.L. E. B.

The Imperial Gazetteer of India. Trübner & co. London, 1885. =Rulers= The rulers of Banki State bore the title 'Raja'. In 1840 the last Raja was deposed and the state was confiscated after he was condemned by a British tribunal to life in prison for murder. After annexation Banki was put under direct control of the Bengal Presidency, being administered by the Cuttack Commissioner. Rani Sukadei Rani Sukadei (1686 A.D. - 1726 A.D.) was an Indian queen of the princely state of Banki, Odisha. She is known for her display of courage and bravery in the battles against Gajapati of Khurda. She is regarded as the only undefeated warrior queen in Indian history. Rajkumari Sukadei of Badamba married the King of Banki, Maharaja Dhanajay Trilokyanath Harichandan Deb. Their union strengthened the ties between the two princely states, Banki and Badamba. As the queen of Banki, the Rani took keen interest in the welfare of her subjects. The King and Queen visited the Jagannath temple at Puri and on their way back to Banki, they were invited by the King of Khurda, Gajapati Gopinath Deva at his court. It is said that when the Raja and Rani paid a visit to Gajapati. Gajapati at Sukadei's first sight got attracted to her so much so that he planned an attack on Banki in order to woo her as soon as the King and Queen departed for Banki from Khurda. Raja Dhanajay refused to accede his kingdom to Khurda on Gajapati's demand, thus decided to fight a war with the Gajapati. In the battle of Ragadigrama, the combined armies of Badamba and Banki fought with the army of Khurda. The Gajapati's army still outnumbered the combined armies of the defendants. Raja Dhanajay suffered huge loses at the hands of Gajapati. He was ultimately killed in the battle. When this news reached Sukadei it devastated her but then she got determined to protect her husband's kingdom. Only when the commanders of Banki had accepted defeat. Sukadei emerged and motivated the soldiers and commanders to not to loose hope. She declared that the war is not over and she shall herself lead the army to the battle ground. In the afternoon Sukadei marched with a troop of 700 soldiers towards the Gajapati's camp. Both the armies again met at Ragadigrama. Sukadei single handedly killed several soldiers of the Gajapati's army. She challenged the Gajapati for a fight. Gajapati, undermining her abilities, stepped down from his horse to fight with her accepting her challenge. The valiant queen defeated the Gajapati and captured her, thus ending the war.

It was established on December 27, 2015. The new brigade, dubbed the Commando Brigade, is composed solely of infantry special-operations units removed from their previous chain of command structures to create a new tactical formation. Commanded by Aluf Mishne (Colonel) Avi Blut, the brigade operates as part of the 98th Division.  Ideation and development  According to the IDF, the Commando Brigade is the brainchild of Lieutenant General Gadi Eisenkot and is the implementation of operational lessons learned during Operation Protective Edge in the summer of 2014 and the Second Lebanon War in 2006. According to the 98th Division Commander, the brigade is not only an integration of the elite teams of the Infantry Corps under one command, but also a body expected to lead operational and tactical thinking in order to establish a new warfare doctrine. The new Brigade, furthermore, is intended to provide special operations units a previously lacking centre of gravity. The concept of a commando brigade was developed by IDF Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot during the formulation of the 5-years military plan. The new brigade is said to draw further parallels between Israel's special forces and 75th Ranger Regiment. Other special-operations units, Sayeret Matkal, Shayetet 13, Shaldag, Oketz and Yahalom will continue to operate independently.  Structure  The 89th Brigade consists of three (formerly four) special operations units of the IDF: The brigade had a fourth battalion, the now defunct Unit 845, or \\"Rimon\\", desert warfare unit, which was absorbed into Maglan on June 27th, 2018. https://www.idf.il/%D7%90%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D/%D7%97%D7%98%D7%99%D7%91%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%93%D7%95/%D7%98%D7%A7%D7%A1-%D7%A1%D7%92%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%AA-%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%9F/ * Unit 212 – Maglan – special reconnaissance unit, formerly under the 98th DivisionGal Perl Finkel, Don’t throw out the baby with the bath water, The Jerusalem Post, August 09, 2018. * Unit 217 – Duvdevan – undercover counter terrorism unit, formerly under Central Command * Unit 621 – Egoz – guerilla warfare unit, formerly under the Golani BrigadeGal Perl Finkel, Wisdom is in the timing, The Jerusalem Post, December 12, 2019.

The original score and songs are composed, arranged and produced by Rahul Raj. Plot Bharath, a technical student, has a habit of kissing people nearby when he is both stressed and happy, disregarding social situations. Bharath (Gokul Suresh), from his first sight of Ganga (Arthana), falls in love with her. Somewhere in Thiruvananthapuram city an infamous gangster Ramakrishnan Bonacaud, aka Rambo (Vijay Babu), has a face to face confrontation with CI Pathmanabhan, aka Padayappa (Baiju); grumpy Rambo becomes annoyed and plans to kill Pathmanabhan soon before leaving Kerala. Meanwhile, Bharath is able to requite love from Ganga and one night he stays with Ganga. After this incident Ganga starts to react hypochondriacally and suspects she is pregnant with Bharath's child and preoccupiedly behaves in the gravity of the same. Rambo is able to sketch Pathmanabhan through two bumbling goons (Kumari and Putheri), but before executing Pathmanabhan publicly, shoots his own urinary bladder using his suppressed gun due to an unexpected kiss from Bharath (who has just got confirmation on Ganga's love). Rambo, who after the accident has urinary incontinence and is attached to a urine drainage bag permanently, is enraged and asks his right-hand man (Abu Salim) to round up everyone involved. All the while the police plan to trap Rambo, once and for all, understanding him to be not just a business man but a Don. They set up a meeting with Rambo through Kumari and Putheri on Rambo's hotel terrace. Rambo calls Bharath's number (which Putheri has obtained) and it keeps ringing. Unexpectedly, Bharath comes to the hotel's terrace to discuss with Ganga their problem of confirming whether she is pregnant or not through a pregnancy test kit and switches off his phone. Everyone on the terrace is frozen and unsure on how to respond. Knowing Ganga isn't pregnant, Bharath looks to kiss someone, sees Rambo, and runs towards him to kiss; they both fall. Immediately a shootout starts between the Police and Rambo's gang. Bharath and Ganga escapes through the staircase. Rambo follows and corners them near a balcony. Pathmanabhan fires his gun; it distracts Rambo, he slips on urine from his detached catheter and falls from the balcony to the sea. Police try to find Rambo's body and they are unable to find it. Policemen involved are promised promotions from political leaders. Bharath, back at home after legal proceedings, promises (at his mother's insistence) before his late father's photo to not kiss anyone whom he doesn't know. It is revealed that his father Chandran (Santhosh Keezhattoor) happens to be a man whom Rambo had murdered in his early days. In the credits it is shown that Rambo is washed up on a beach and a couple of cannibals are surrounding him.

It built and opened its line between Edinburgh and Berwick (later Berwick on Tweed) and formed part of the first rail link between Edinburgh and London (although with two water breaks). The line opened in 1846. The first chairman, John Learmonth, wanted to enlarge the geographical area of dominance of the NBR and committed huge sums of money to the project even before opening the first line. Some of the commitments were in vain, but he acquired the Edinburgh and Hawick Railway as a first step to reaching Carlisle, part of the bitter and enduring rivalry with the Caledonian Railway. Making the Hawick line included purchasing the obsolescent Edinburgh and Dalkeith Railway and converting it for locomotive operation. The railway's operations were popular and successful, although early shortcomings in the civil engineering caused temporary difficulties. Branches to Haddington, North Berwick, Dunse (later spelt Duns) and Kelso were opened. Part of the motivation for their building was the exclusion of rival railway companies, and these branches did not enjoy such great success. The drain on the Company's financial resources dragged it down in comparison to the rival Caledonian Railway, and shareholder dissent led to the departure of its first chairman and his successor, and in 1855 Richard Hodgson took over, with the mandate of rescuing the company. Early railways The Lothian and Fife areas of Scotland had been endowed with minerals, especially coal that led to adoption of waggonways as a means of transport in the eighteenth century. These early lines used horse traction and wooden rails, and in nearly all cases were designed to convey coal and limestone over short distances to a harbour for onward transport. In the nineteenth century, the notion of longer distance lines began to take hold, but for the time being available technology prevented that idea becoming a practicable proposition. In the first years of the nineteenth century, the use of iron rails became commonplace, and it was possible to think in terms of trains, rather than two or three wagons, and primitive locomotives came into use. The so-called coal railways of the Monklands were starting to adopt steam traction, and also to carry passengers in some cases. The Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway of 1825 and the Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway 1831 were pioneers. It was the opening of the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825 which indicated that technological progress could make a successful railway over longer distances using locomotive power, and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway of 1830 showed that an inter-city steam railway could be viable. Indeed, the success of the passenger part of the L&MR; operation seems to have taken everyone by surprise. When the London and Birmingham Railway opened, followed by the Grand Junction Railway of 1833, connecting Birmingham with the Liverpool and Manchester line, the notion of a railway network began to take hold, and suddenly it seemed as if the whole of Great Britain must be connected into it. Longer distance railways The first long-distance line in Scotland was the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, opening in 1832, and this too was commercially successful beyond the expectations of its promoters. The E&GR; had been built to the track gauge of 4 ft 8½ inches, whereas most of the earlier Scottish lines had been built with a gauge of 4 ft 6in. Although at that time interconnection with English railways was not yet considered, the selection must have been influenced by the perceived technical superiority of the Stockton and Darlington and its imitators. If English railways seemed to be congregating in the Midlands and North of England, and slowly progressing northwards, then perhaps Scottish railways needed to be promoted to extend southward to join them. As the money market became freer as the 1830s moved on, a number of proposals were put forward for connecting central Scotland with the English network. (In addition, many schemes were promoted for domestic Scottish lines, but the controversy was not so intense for them.) Suddenly the newspapers were full of commentary about the line to England, with wild schemes being praised by their promoters and condemned by their opponents. For the time being it was assumed that only a single route could be commercially viable to handle all the traffic. It was critical design a route that could cross the high ground of the Southern Uplands and the Cheviot Hills and the Pennines, usable by the technically primitive locomotives of the day, which were unable to ascend steep and lengthy gradients. In 1835 the Grand Junction Railway, already planning to reach Preston and later Carlisle, commissioned the young engineer Joseph Locke to propose routes from Glasgow to Carlisle. His report made the difficulties plain: a west coast route (as the Carlisle options were beginning to be called) had to ascend steep gradients, or go in a wide westerly circuit round them. The Grand Junction investors had other preoccupations further south and the idea was deferred for the time being. More modest schemes were being proposed, though, and in 1836 plans for a line from Edinburgh to Dunbar by way of Haddington had been prepared. In the same year a line from Edinburgh through Jedburgh and under Carter Fell to Newcastle upon Tyne was put forward, but neither of these schemes was progressed further. However, on 24 October 1838 a Great Northern Junction Railway was proposed by a meeting of promoters; this time the line would run through Berwick. Work was done on route design, by George Stephenson, who found that gradients and engineering works would be much easier than going over the flank of the Southern Uplands. In February 1839 a prospectus was issued; the name had been changed to the Great North British Railway. The capital required for the scheme was £2 million. The Smith-Barlow Commission Routes to England considered by Smith and BarlowThe considerable public interest continued, and the Government decided that the matter should be decided in the national interest. In 1840 it appointed a commission to advise it, and Professor Peter Barlow of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and Colonel Sir Frederick Smith, Inspector General of Railways at the Board of Trade, were appointed to \\"make recommendations on the most effective means of railway communication from London to Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dublin\\". In fact the major part of their consideration was a route from Glasgow and Edinburgh to Carlisle or Newcastle. Both of the English places already had definite schemes in hand to place them on the English network, so the gap lay in southern Scotland, and Dublin was not a central issue. The Commission considered 16 schemes, although many of them were no more than minor variations of others. In several cases the promoters of schemes were unable to provide more than the most basic details of their proposals and their costs, and the Commissioners found wild and inexplicable variations in unit costs assumed. Their report was published on 15 March 1841: they repeated the assumption that only one line was required linking Scotland and England. The Annandale route to Carlisle via Beattock was favoured. Although the gradients would be challenging, the route had the advantage of being reasonably direct, and serving both Glasgow and Edinburgh equally well. Importantly, their recommendation was heavily qualified: anyone could build such a line provided they gave an undertaking to reach Lancaster, which at that time was the northern extremity of planned English railways. If this undertaking were not given, an east coast route via Newcastle would have preference. This ambiguity was fatal to the authority of their report. There were two further fundamental shortcomings in their recommendation: it was not mandatory; and there was no Government money on offer to build the recommended line. Most people had assumed that public money would be made available to build the preferred route; the sudden tightness of the commercial money market ensured that no group of promoters rushed to do the Commission's bidding. The passage of time had changed attitudes to railway speculation; the success of the first inter-city railways and the further success of local feeders and secondary routes, encouraged the belief that there could be more than one route to England, and in fact that any route could be viable on its own terms. The Commission's findings had become irrelevant. The North British Railway takes shape Nonetheless the start of the Commission's work, coupled with an extreme tightness of the money market, had put paid to the immediate prospect of the £2 million Great North British Railway. In January 1842 John Learmonth, chairman of the Edinburgh Committee of the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, chaired a meeting proposing a more modest scheme from Edinburgh to Dunbar only. They obtained the surveys of the Great North British Railway and intended to follow the same route as far as Dunbar; and they determined to call their line the North British Railway. A prospectus was issued in February 1842; there was to be a branch to Haddington, and the capital was to be £500,000. Haddington, a Royal Burgh and important county market town was displeased to be on a branch line; the earlier proposals had put it on the main line. Learmonth was anxious to keep the capital cost under control, and routing through Haddington would have materially increased capital cost and running cost due to the more difficult terrain. Dunbar too was disappointed to find that its terminus was to be south of the town, and not connecting its important fishing harbour; here the reason was the intended later extension to Berwick: Learmonth had a clear vision that Dunbar was only a short-term terminus; the station needed to enable a later extension. The track gauge too was now determined not by local whim, but by the imperative of joining up with the English network; the notion of a \\"standard gauge\\" of 4 ft 8½ in was taking hold. There was now a sense of urgency about raising money, for the provisional Caledonian Railway was also planning its future line and trying to raise money. Quite apart from the now discredited idea of only one line being viable, the capital required for a long distance railway was huge, and the gross available capital was not unlimited. Already the rivalry for supremacy between the North British Railway and the Caledonian Railway was in action. In fact both lines found that they could not raise enough money to go to Parliament in the 1843 session as they had hoped. George HudsonA revised route with steeper gradients had been considered earlier, in an attempt to reduce construction costs by 8%, and further cost-paring might have been attempted at this stage. Now Learmonth was persuaded by George Hudson, an English railway promoter and financier, to increase interest in his scheme by putting forward a more ambitious scheme, going all the way to Berwick (later known as Berwick- upon-Tweed. At 56 miles, this would increase construction costs to £900,000, but be more attractive to investors: it would link with the proposed Newcastle and Berwick Railway and form part of a future chain of railways reaching London. Hudson agreed to subscribe £50,000, and he did so in due course, although he then passed his holding to the York and North Midland Railway, which he controlled. The railway engineer John Miller was asked to revisit the route surveys to reduce cost, and he did so, getting the cost of construction down to £800,000, though this figure omitted the acquisition of coaching stock. The Edinburgh terminus was altered to be at North Bridge, having previously been intended at Leith Walk. The Act secured The North British Railway system in 1847With the new scheme, the promoters were able to submit a Bill to Parliament in the 1844 session. The most serious potential opponent to the scheme in Parliament was the Edinburgh and Dalkeith Railway (E&DR;) which feared abstraction of its traffic. The E&DR; was an obsolescent horse-drawn railway with stone-block sleepered track; its principal traffic was coal but passengers were carried. To eliminate the opposition, the North British promoters agreed to buy that railway for £133,000The figure is quoted as £113,000 in Dow page 8, and Mullay page 16. The NBR Chairman John Learmonth already contemplated a long branch from Edinburgh to Carlisle using the E&DR; as its northern termination; reaching Carlisle would connect to the West Coast route to London and the industrial north west of England. Moreover, the E&DR; had a branch to Leith docks, and important outlet to shipping; securing the E&DR; would automatically acquire that connection. With E&DR; opposition neutralised, there was relatively little else in the way, and the North British Railway secured its authorising Act of Parliament on 4 July 1844.Dow says 19 July on page 8 The rival Caledonian Railway had not got a far as submitting a Bill in this session. Construction and preparation The engineer Miller proceeded with building the main line. He designed the Dunglass Viaduct, near Cockburnspath. It had six arches; the main span was 135 feet, 111 feet high, approached by three and two respectively of 30 feet each. Stations were basic, reflecting the skimping of the budget, and this included the Edinburgh station. The Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway was extending its line from Haymarket to a joint Edinburgh station which was to be called \\"North Bridge\\". The station was being built by the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway and it was not ready until 3 August 1846. The line was laid with 70 lb per yard rails in 12 feet lengths The Nor' Loch and the North Bridge in 1809There was a large depression on a west to east alignment, the Nor' Loch, with Princes Street and the New Town to the north of it, and the Old Town to the south. This had been a disgusting refuse and cess pit, but it was somewhat improved in 1820 when two sets of gardens were made on the area. It was on this land that the North British Railway terminal for Edinburgh was built; the passenger station was immediately east of the North Bridge, and the goods station was squeezed in east of that on the north side of the line. The North Bridge in 1829; the alignment of the North British railway was to be from the bottom left of the image through the left hand (north) arch of the North BridgeThe Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway had long wished to extend to the city centre from its Haymarket terminal, and the opportunity was now taken to extend to the North Bridge station, running through the western gardens of the Nor' Loch, partly in tunnel, and passing through the northern arch of the North Bridge. The railway was fortunate in being allowed to take this land, and the lines and stations of Edinburgh would be very different today if this had not been permitted by the city authorities. High construction of station buildings was not permitted, and the major disadvantage for arriving passengers was the strenuous climb from platform to street level. The North British booking offices were later provided on Waverley Bridge; the building is still in existence. The construction of the main line was not without disorder: Cockburnspath: The continued disturbances among the railway workmen at this station on pay days have induced the authorities to send out a detachment of Dragoons from Jock's Lodge [a cavalry barracks near Edinburgh]. Their arrival on Saturday morning was very anxiously looked for. As it is the intention of Messrs Ross and Mitchell, the contractors, to turn off about 500 of the most refractory, and burn their mud huts, to prevent their locating in the district, a serious disturbance might have been looked for, had the military not been on hand. As it is, we have not heard of any attempt at a row. Two million tickets were ordered from McDoland and McIver in preparation for the opening; Edmondson's style of pasteboard tickets dated on issue by a press, appear to have been used from the start. The opening date had been envisaged to be 1 May 1846, but this was overrun, and General Pasley, the Inspecting Officer of the Board of Trade visited for a formal inspection on 15 May 1846. The line was not ready, and he refused the requested permission; even a partial opening from Edinburgh to Cockburnspath was declined. He revisited the line on 16 June, this time finding the works satisfactory. Opening The North Bridge station runs from the right hand edge of the image and through the left arch of the North Bridge; the view is to the south-east. Coaches can be seen in the Edinburgh and Northern Railway Canal Street station, running from the centre of the image to the left; the connecting curve to the E&GR; runs in front of the square building to the bottom-right corner of the image.General Pasley, the Board of Trade Inspecting Officer reviewed the line on 17 June and passed it, so it was given a ceremonial opening on 18 June 1846, and opened to public passenger trains on 22 June 1846., amended by The Haddington branch was included in the opening. There were five passenger trains each way on the main line, supplemented by ten short workings between Edinburgh and Inveresk. The trains were notable for having better accommodation for third class passengers than was usual on railways at the time. 26 locomotives had been acquired from R and W Hawthorn. Goods trains did not start operation until 3 August 1846. At this stage £1,460,000 had been expended. The passenger train service was five main line trains daily, with two on Sundays (four weekdays and two on Sundays on the Haddington branch), with an additional ten trains daily between Edinburgh and Musselburgh. Considerable controversy was generated among those shareholders and others who had a religious objection to the running of trains on Sundays. For example, at an ordinary shareholders' meeting on 27 August 1846, \\"A discussion of nearly three hours' duration next took place in regard to the running of railway trains on the Sabbath. It was brought on by Mr Blackadder, who produced a great number of petitions and remonstrances against the desecration of the Sunday.\\" Initially there were fifteen stations, taken from public advertisements by the Company: Edinburgh, Portobello, Musselburgh (later Inveresk), Tranent (later Prestonpans), Longniddry, Ballencrieff, Drem, Linton (later East Linton), Dunbar, Cockburnspath, Grant's House, Reston, Ayton, and Berwick. There seem to have been several other stations brought into use at a very early date and not necessarily formally announced, and indeed some of the stations were considered provisional \\"until it was better ascertained from the traffic whether permanent stations should be erected at these places or elsewhere\\". One new station was at Meadowbank, subsequently known as St Margaret's. It was used by Queen Victoria in 1850 when returning to the Palace of Holyroodhouse, which was nearby; the station also became known as The Queen's Station. Jock's Lodge station, a quarter mile east of Meadowbank, was opened at an early date, and closed on 1 July 1848.The station was at the site of Restalrig Road bridge. There was a cavalry barracks there, and the name Jock's Lodge was simply a district on the outskirts of Edinburgh at the time. A Joppa station is thought to have opened before 1848 also. East Fortune, Beltonford goods station, and Innerwick and Burnmouth all opened between 1848 and 1850. The definition of a station seems to have been odd: referring to trains to the market at Haddington, a NBR advertisement stated, \\"On Fridays a Market Train will leave Cockburnspath for Haddington at 10 a.m. returning at 4 p.m., calling at all the intermediate stations and at Innerwick. [emphasis added]\\". The Edinburgh station occupied the eastern end of the present-day Waverley station site. On 1 August 1846, the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway opened its extension line from Haymarket.Dow and Paterson; Ross says 3 August for goods only. For the time being the station facilities consisted of little more than a platform and a booking office (located on Waverley Bridge), and there was no railway connection between the two lines. Work on providing even a basic station took until 17 May 1847, and from this time the Edinburgh station gradually became known as the \\"General Station\\". Both the main line railways used the station but there was still no railway connection between them, and the North British Railway passenger trains used a single temporary platform. The adjoining Canal Street station was also opened on 17 May 1847 when the rope worked line of the Edinburgh, Leith and Granton Railway from Scotland Street was brought into use. A sharp curve connected this line to the Glasgow line. The roof of the new station was limited to 42 feet above the rails because of daylight requirements for neighbours; North Bridge was reconstructed as part of the work. Land acquisition had been very expensive, although this was not declared to shareholders until 8 March 1849: £350,000 had been spent on land, against the £120,000 estimated. The civil engineering construction was not entirely robust; most of the main line bridges were of timber construction, doubtless part of Miller's process of reducing the capital cost. Even before the line was opened, poor foundations to the central pier of a two span bridge over the Esk near Niddrie Burn caused settlement. Then soon after opening, the Calton Tunnel showed signs of distortion at the eastern portal, and near Portobello a brick skew arch for the Portobello Road and an iron arch and wooden viaduct of eleven spans over the Leith branch of the E&DR; line were settling. Further from Edinburgh, the line was breached. Heavy rain in September 1846 put many watercourses into spate, and the runoff exposed some weaknesses in the foundations of some of Miller's bridges: \\"Stoppage of the North British Railway: Short as the time is since this line was opened to the public, it is now closed. Three of the bridges have been washed away—one at Linton and two others between that place and Dunbar. The cause appears to have been the late heavy rains, and it is thought that the contractors will have to restore the bridges at their own expense. No lives were lost, and passengers are now transmitted by the joint aid of rails and coaches, the latter of which, along with horses, have been forwarded from Edinburgh.\\" Dalkeith and Hawick Connections between the NBR and the former Edinburgh and Dalkeith lines in 1855When the 1844 Act was secured, the NBR had agreed to purchase the Edinburgh and Dalkeith Railway. The chairman of the NBR, John Learmonth, already had a vision of reaching Carlisle over that line, in opposition to the Caledonian Railway, which was planning its line from Glasgow and Edinburgh to Carlisle. (The Caledonian Railway secured its authorising Act on 31 July 1845.) Although the technical condition of the E&DR; line was primitive, it connected numerous collieries, and above all it connected to Leith Docks by a branch. A Bill for a line to Hawick, the Edinburgh and Hawick Railway was entered in the 1845 session; the subscribers at this stage were all directors of the North British Railway. It obtained its Act of Incorporation on 21 July 1845, and at this stage Learmonth made public his intention that the line should proceed to Carlisle, and that the North British Railway should construct it. The shareholders went along with this huge increase in capital, and despite some opposition in Parliament, the Hawick line got its Act on 31 July 1845.The date of passing of the Edinburgh and Hawick Railway Act. The NBR had pre-emptively acquired the transfer of those powers, and directly acquired the E&DR;, by the North British Railway (Edinburgh and Dalkeith Purchase) Act of 21 July 1845. The Act also authorised the connection between the NBR and the E&DR; line at Niddrie. The North British shareholders voted on 18 August 1845 to raise £400,000 to purchase the nominally independent company, and £160,000 for the Edinburgh and Dalkeith and its conversion and modernisation to a locomotive railway. The NBR took possession of the E&DR; on 1 October 1845, payment for the Leith Branch being completed the following December. In acquiring the Edinburgh and Hawick Railway, the North British took over the powers to build from South Esk on the E&DR; to Hawick. The NBR also secured powers in 1845 to build from Portobello (on its own future main line) to Niddrie (on the E&DR;), the first step in providing the Waverley Route. The Edinburgh and Dalkeith line had to be reconstructed and relaid, in itself a major undertaking for the North British Railway. In addition, a deviation was made where sharp curves existed near Millerhill, and the single track beyond the Dalkeith junction had to be provided; beyond the extremity of the E&DR; the River South Esk had to be crossed by a new bridge; the Marquis of Lothian's Waggonway had crossed it, forming an extension of the E&DR;, but the old viaduct was inadequate. The work of improving the E&DR; seems to have been done without suspending trains. In 1846 a two-hourly passenger service was more or less maintained over the former E&DR; main line until June 1847. Locomotives began working from St Leonards to Niddrie on 15 February 1847, the incline winding engines being taken out of use. Steam hauled services to Dalkeith from St Leonards and from North Bridge station started on 14 July 1847, along with those from General to Gorebridge on the uncompleted Hawick line. St Leonards was closed to passenger traffic on 1 November 1847. The press had taken an interest in progress: > Edinburgh and Dalkeith Railway: This line of railway having recently > undergone, to a considerable extent, the necessary alterations for adapting > it to locomotive power, an engine was placed on it last week, preliminary to > its being employed for the passenger traffic on Monday.

The new NBR lines and the E&DR; lines needed to be connected. Where the NBR main line crossed the E&DR; Leith branch, a spur was installed enabling direct running from North Bridge station towards the E&DR; Niddry (later spelt Niddrie) direction. In addition a new line was built from Portobello to Niddry; this was to be part of the future main line of the Waverley Route; it had stations at Joppa and Niddry. The Fisherrow branch had been built to get access to the small fishing harbour there, but this was not a great success and the NBR extended that line crossing the River Esk to make a terminus in Musselburgh itself. The \\"Musselburgh\\" station on the NBR main line was renamed Inveresk. The line branched from the new Portobello line at Niddry, and the short section of E&DR; giving direct running from St Leonards to Fisherrow was removed. These changes were made on 16 July 1847. The Fisherrow stub was reduced to goods status only. This left parts of the E&DR; oddly unconnected; both St Leonards and Leith could only be accessed from the Dalkeith direction, and no turnback siding accommodation is evident in period maps. Moreover, the Joppa and Niddry stations were not on the NBR main line. It was not until 1859 (outside the scope of this article) that some of these anomalies were rectified.Smith and Anderson say that \\"in 1847 a short spur above the Friggate Burn was authorised so that South Leith [that is, Leith E&DR;] passenger trains could run into a separate platform at the new Portobello main line station, thus affording more direct connections with Edinburgh. This opened in summer 1849 and the former E&DR; Portobello station nearby closed along with the original route to Niddrie.\\" These events took place in 1859, not 1849, and the reference in Smith and Anderson seems to be a typographical error.Ordnance Survey of Great Britain, Six inches to one mile plans, Edinburghshire, published 1853 (surveyed 1852) Branches In the 1846 session even more financial commitment was taken on, as the shareholders agreed on 9 February 1846 to branches to Duns, North Berwick, Tranent and Cockenzie; and from the Hawick line to Kelso, Jedburgh, Selkirk, and Peebles, and extending the Hawick line to Carlisle with a branch to Gretna; the total capital required was £1.68 million. Northward extension was not overlooked, and the proposed Edinburgh and Perth Railway was to be taken over by a share exchange amounting to £800,000. Although the money market was slowing down, North British Railway shares were at a premium (£30 10s per £25 share); the Caledonian Railway was at £10 15s per £50 share. The numerous NBR branches proposed in 1845 were passed in Parliament on 26 June 1846, but the proposed extension from Hawick to Carlisle was turned down, as was the Edinburgh and Perth Railway. Even so, the financial resources were tight. Receipts from train services for the ten weeks to 31 July were £9,931 (about £50,000 annualised) and the capital of £1.528 million had been expended save for about 4%. Nonetheless Learmonth insisted on resubmitting the Carlisle extension and the Edinburgh and Perth line. £10,000 was spent on a down-payment on the Halbeath Railway, a horse tramway which appeared to be on the future route of the Perth line. A takeover bid by Hudson George Hudson had been supportive of the North British in the early months, but now he sponsored reports in the press criticising its engineering quality. There was talk of a new railway from Berwick to Edinburgh via Kelso, cutting out the NBR altogether. The object of this propaganda was clear when Hudson offered to lease the NBR, obviously his objective all along. His terms were to pay 8% on its capital on the main line and 5% on the branches (only Haddington and Hawick—other branch construction was to be deferred) with an option to amalgamate with his York and Newcastle Railway and Newcastle and Berwick Railway. 8% was not a bad offer: \\"Strange to say, these remarkably liberal terms were rejected by the directors of the North British Company\\",Tomlinson, page 482 but John Learmonth had other ambitions for his North British Railway. Scottish pride may also have been a factor in rejecting Hudson's advances. \\"Resolution passed at a Special General Meeting of the North British Railway Company, held at Edinburgh upon the 10th day of February 1847: [it was unanimously] resolved, that the Report now submitted to the Meeting be approved, and that the offer made by the York and Newcastle, and Newcastle and Berwick Railway Companies, for leasing the North British Railway, be rejected.\\" If that announcement was terse, the fact was underlined by exactly as much space being allocated to an announcement immediately below in the Caledonian Mercury. The date of the next shareholders' meeting was advertised, at which Mr Blackadder's motion, \\"that no Trains shall be run on the Sabbath Day\\" would be considered. An editorial in the same newspaper supported the decision to reject Hudson's offer. From this time until early 1848 the price of NBR shares was on a downward slide, and many shareholders regretted the refusal of Hudson's 8% offer; Hudson declined to renew the offer when requested to do so in September 1848. Although part of it had been opened, completion of the Hawick line was stalled through inability to get calls on shares paid. North Bridge station On 17 May 1847 the joint station at Waverley Bridge came into use; until then crude platforms without proper facilities had been the sole provision. The Edinburgh and Glasgow and the NBR each used the new station, and the Edinburgh, Leith and Granton Railway opened its Canal Street terminus, alongside but at right angles, facing north. There was a sharp curve connecting that line with the E&GR; but the NBR was not connected. The NBR called the station simply \\"Edinburgh\\" or \\"the North Bridge station\\". The station was still not complete; that was not achieved until 22 February 1848. Even then, the site was very cramped, and relations with the City Council over expansion were difficult. On 5 June 1851 the Royal Assent was finally granted for a modest extension of the station. Finances The North British Railway system in 1855The company had taken on massive capital obligations; as well as the direct cost of its own main line, there was the Edinburgh and Hawick Railway, in all but name a long and expensive branch of the North British Railway; and there was the purchase and conversion of the Edinburgh and Dalkeith Railway, involving temporary closure of it with corresponding loss of income. At the September 1847 half yearly shareholders' meeting the Deputy Chairman, Eagle Henderson, was chairing the meeting. He had to excuse the poor results on revenue account due to the \\"untoward accidents of last year\\", and \\"the general depression of trade, the incomplete state of communication between Berwick and Newcastle [while the Tweed and Tyne bridges were being completed] and the serious interruption to the traffic on the Dalkeith branch for several months, while the alterations were being made.\\" Nonetheless a half year dividend of 12s 6d on the £25 ordinary shares [1 per cent annualised] was declared, \\"looking to ... the certainty of a large increase of traffic for the current half-year\\". By \\"the current half year\\" he meant the future period, so the dividend was paid out of capital. The company's financial position was no less difficult in 1849; as well as huge capital outlays, it emerged that working expenses had climbed to well over 50% of receipts. As well as taking out a large 4% loan in the personal names of the Directors, the company imposed wage reductions on the staff. This resulted in most of the engine drivers leaving the company, and inexperienced men took over, not without mishap. However, on 29 October 1849 the Hawick branch was completed. This was matched by the completion of the Kelso branch (to a temporary terminus at Wallace Nick) on 7 June 1850. The general drift continued; in 1852, noting that working expenses were now 56% of receipts, a newspaper recorded: > North British Railway: It appears that the shareholders in this company are > becoming uneasy at the state of the property, the greater part of which [the > shareholding] is in England ... The line was originally intended to connect > the southern lines at Berwick with the Scotch lines at Edinburgh. The > original act was passed in 1844, and the length of the line then sanctioned > was 57 miles, and the amount of the capital authorized was £900,000, being > at the rate of £15,500 per mile ...

The directors of the company in the year 1847 refused an offer > from Mr. Hudson of eight per cent. per annum for leasing the line to the > York, Newcastle and Berwick Company. A through route to London Dunglass Viaduct; the twentieth century road bridge is behindWhen the NBR first opened, passenger services to London were advertised, but these involved change of train, and crossing on foot or by carriage, at the Tweed at Berwick and the Tyne at Newcastle.Until 1 July 1847 when the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway was completed as far as Tweedmouth, this involved a considerable road journey. Goods had to be carted through the streets. Both these rivers were to be bridged, but that work would take some considerable time. In both cases temporary wooden structures were used to pass trains before the permanent structure was ready. Temporary bridges passed trains over the Tyne (at Newcastle) from 20 August 1848, and over the Tweed (at Berwick) from 18 October 1848;Hamilton Ellis says that on 2 September 1848 a carriage was pushed manually to centre of the bridge on the temporary trestle staging. from that date the North British was able to advertise \\"no change of train\\".Ross says (page 238) Tweed opened for goods 10 October 1848, passengers 15 October 1848; Hamilton Ellis agrees; Lewin (Aftermath, page 513) says Tyne crossing 29 August 1848 and Tweed 10 October 1848. Hoole says (page 204) Tyne crossing 29 August 1848; Quick agrees 10 October 1848 for Tweed.Thomas, volume 1, page 48 The rival Caledonian Railway was completed throughout, giving through rail services from both Edinburgh and Glasgow to London, on 1 April 1848; the Caledonian was to be a formidable competitor. Moreover, the North British Railway did not eliminate the coastal steamer route to London: in 1849 the NBR booked 5,792 passengers from Edinburgh to London, while coastal steamers booked 11,584 in the year 1849. The permanent High Level Bridge at Newcastle was opened on 15 August 1849. Although the permanent Tweed bridge had originally been scheduled for completion in July 1849, the permanent bridge was opened to goods traffic on 20 July 1850, and formally opened 29 August 1850. quoted in Tomlinson, page 507 A special arrangement was made to pass a special passenger train for visitors to a meeting at Edinburgh for the Royal Society for the Advance of Science on 1 August 1850, only a single line being available. George Leeman, Chairman of the York Newcastle and Berwick Railway, referred to the special train, and disclosed that the full opening had been intentionally delayed to comply with Royal commitments, in a speech at a dinner in honour of Robert Stephenson in Newcastle on 30 July 1850: > Gentlemen, perhaps you will think I have said enough upon the subject of the > High Level Bridge. But, there is another structure, the representation of > which adorns this hall, and in regard to which in a very few weeks I hope > all the gentlemen I am now addressing will feel a pleasure in being present > at the opening. (Applause.) Gentlemen, you are aware that the bridge for the > passage of the trains of the Company over [the permanent bridge across] the > Tweed has not been opened until the last few days, and then only for one > line across the bridge. We have opened the bridge thus far at the present > time for the purpose of enabling those travelling to the great meeting of > the British Association at Edinburgh to pass over it rather than over the > temporary structure that had been used previously. You will ask why we have > delayed the laying of the second line and the complete opening of the > bridge? We have done so because we considered it an undertaking of such a > character that it should receive its finishing stroke from one of the > highest in the land. We were anxious to celebrate the opening of the bridge > by the presence of one of the most distinguished patrons of science and art > in this country, Prince Albert. (Applause.) We have been in communication > with his Royal Highness, and we had hoped to have been able to open the > bridge at an earlier period than that at which we are now assembled; but, > gentlemen, though that has not been done, I am happy to say our hopes in > other respects are not only realized, but that they have been exceeded ... > The announcement I am enabled to make is that not only will his Royal > Highness give his own presence on that auspicious occasion, but that her > Majesty the Queen will do so likewise.(Loud and continued cheering.) Fletcher recorded slightly different opening dates: > The first train passed along the temporary bridge used on the erection of > the High Level Bridge on the 29th August 1848 ... The last key on [the > permanent structure of] the High Level Bridge was driven by Mr. Hawks on 7th > June, 1849; it was opened without any ceremony on August 14th, but it was > not brought into ordinary use until the following February [1850] ...

The completion of the railway routes revived consideration of the onward route to London; the original route had been by way of the York and North Midland Railway and the London and North Western Railway to Euston Square. From October 1852 the possibility of running by a shorter route over the Great Northern Railway to Kings Cross was available, and the North British settled on that; the best time was eleven hours from Edinburgh, an hour quicker than the West Coast route time. Goods traffic, increasingly important, was speeded up too. The Caledonian Railway was dominant in the emerging railway hub at Carlisle, and as a member of the Euston Confederacy, a cabal of companies allied to the London and North Western Railway, it was becoming a bitter and potent enemy of the North British. However an octuple agreement on traffic to London was concluded on 17 April 1851 for five years, apportioning traffic between the North British, Caledonian Railway, the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway and the London and North Western Railway, the York Newcastle and Berwick Railway, the York and North Midland Railway, the Midland Railway and the Great Northern Railway shared the London - Edinburgh traffic excluding mails and minerals in equal division between the East Coast and West Coast companies on the three Anglo-Scottish routes: Euston - Preston- Carlisle -Edinburgh; Euston - Rugby - York - Edinburgh, and Kings Cross - Doncaster - York - Edinburgh. The NBR formed the northern section of two of these routes and all traffic from places between York and Edinburgh was to be carried by the east coast lines. Receipts from the Berwick - Edinburgh section went to the NBR. The NBR also became a party to the sextuple agreement backdated to 1 January 1851 with the same companies except the Great Northern and York and North Midland companies, allocating shares of all traffic except mails, from Birmingham northwards to Edinburgh with a 50/50 east coast/west coast split on through traffic between these cities. Traffic forwarded from Great Northern station south of York to Edinburgh and Glasgow would be 100% east coast. These arrangements were not unfavourable to the North British, though it still hoped to break the Caledonian monopoly of all traffic through Carlisle, including that to and from Leeds and Bradford, passed to the West Coast via the \\"Little North Western Railway\\" between Skipton and Lancaster. Train service in 1850 The passenger train service in 1850 is shown in Bradshaw for 1850, although at that time the publication was not rigorously complete. On the main line there were five trains weekdays from Edinburgh \\"North Bridge\\" to Berwick, with an additional Edinburgh to Haddington train. The best main line train called intermediately only at Dunbar, leaving Edinburgh at 9:45 am and arriving at Berwick at 11:15 am, offering arrival in London Euston Square at 10:30 pm. The train \\"carries second class passengers between Edinburgh and Newcastle and the servants of first class passengers throughout.\\" There was a corresponding service northbound. The Haddington branch had four or five trains to and from Longniddry. The Sunday service was two stopping and one (up) or two (down) fast trains. The Dunse (later \\"Duns\\") branch had three trains each way connecting with main line trains at Reston, and the North Berwick had three each way connecting at Drem. There was a Wednesday market train on the Dunse branch. There is no mention in Bradshaw of the frequent short trains to Musselburgh (main line) that were laid on at the beginning of the service. The Dalkeith and Hawick line had six trains weekdays only between Edinburgh and Dalkeith, and three stopping trains each way Edinburgh to Hawick. Learmonth ousted Since the beginning, the North British directors had taken on huge financial commitments, and in many cases Directors had taken on individual share allocations on behalf of the Company, and these looked shady to some shareholders. There had been a race to capture territory by sponsoring, directly or indirectly, associated lines and branches. (By contrast, the Caledonian Railway, though equally voracious, had concluded leases of associated lines, which achieved the commitment without requiring the front-end cash outlay.) This issue had attracted increasing criticism from shareholders, and on 18 March 1852 it had to be made clear that there would be no dividend distribution to ordinary shareholders for the half year. A preference share issue, necessary to finance capital commitments, flopped, and a full-blown financial crisis was in progress. A group of influential English shareholders had submitted a circular demanding a change of directors, and the Chairman, John Learmonth and his deputy said they would be pleased to be relieved of the work of running the company. Three directors announced that they were resigning, and Learmonth said that he would retire in due course. He hoped to do so at a time of his own choosing, but on 13 May 1852 he and two more directors left. Learmonth's deputy, James Balfour, took over as Chairman. Balfour was not the man to lead a great public undertaking like the North British, and was seen infrequently and had little influence. In 1855 he resigned (by wire from Madeira): the announcement in the press was typically low-key: > North British Railway: Mr. John Bain of Morriston has been appointed a > director of this line, in room of Mr James Balfour of Whittingham, resigned. The Chairmanship passed to a better man: Richard Hodgson. Branch openings In the 1846 Parliamentary session, the North British Railway had achieved authorisation for a considerable number of branch lines, in addition to the connections to the Edinburgh and Dalkeith line authorised in the previous session. The branch line to Dunse (later called Duns) from Reston opened on 13 August 1849 (formal) and fully on 15 August 1849. The short branch at Prestonpans to Tranent, serving colliery workings there, opened on 11 December 1849. The branch line to Kelso from St Boswells opened on 17 June 1850 to a temporary station near Kelso; obstruction from the Duke of Roxburghe frustrated efforts to get a proper Kelso station at once, and the later permanent station was inconveniently located south of the Tweed. The Newcastle and Berwick Railway had earlier promoted a branch to Kelso from Tweedmouth, near Berwick, and Learmonth had envisaged these lines as together forming a strategic east-west link. Relations between the NBR and the North Eastern Railway, successor to the Newcastle and Berwick Railway, were cool and the development never took place. A number of other railways were promoted in the area the North British considered its own, but the difficult financial position of the NBR meant that they had to raise the capital themselves. The Peebles Railway was incorporated on 8 July 1853 and opened on 4 July 1855. It ran to Peebles from a junction off the Hawick line at Hardengreen. It worked its own trains, although it joined the North British family from 1858. The Port Carlisle Dock and Railway Company was incorporated on 4 August 1853, to build a line to Port Carlisle, enabling goods to be brought to Carlisle by- passing the silted up channel of the Solway Firth. This turned out to be an unprofitable business, but it played a part later in getting access to Carlisle for the North British Railway. For now it opened in 1854; its later destiny was not to become obvious for some years. For the time being, it had no connection to the North British Railway. The Border Counties Railway was authorised on 1 July 1854 to build a line through very thinly populated terrain, with suspected, but unproven, coal reserves. It was to connect Hexham on the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway to Bellingham, but later extensions took the line to Riccarton Junction. It too had no connection with the North British Railway until later. Topography Hamilton Ellis described the route from a train running point of view (condensed here): > The exit from Edinburgh was through Calton Tunnel followed by about a mile > at 1 in 78 falling, but elsewhere most of it rose and fell at 1 in 300, with > a mile at 1 in 250 between East Fortune and East Linton. From Innerwick the > route became more formidable, rising for about 6 miles to Penmanshiel > Tunnel, the first 2¾ miles at 1 in 210 and the rest at 1 in 96, a > challenging road for the motive power of those days. The remaining 17½ miles > from the summit to Berwick had a fall on a more gentle gradient, mostly 1 in > 200 to a level between Reston and Ayton, whence there was a gentle hump > before the final descent at 1 in 190 to the short Berwick level. Hamilton Ellis also described the Berwick station: > The origin of the Berwick station was quaint. On the site was an old border > castle built by David I, so that he could watch the English. The North > British company thoughtfully demolished this, but kept the building material > in order to erect out of it a massive station house with battlements and > crenellations, an octagonal tower on one side, and a round tower with a > superimposed turret on the other. It lasted until 1926. =Early stations= An exact record of passenger stations open at any time does not appear in official timetables of the day nor in independent publications.

Richard Hodgson as chairman With the departure of John Balfour, the North British Railway was at a low point, and needed a dynamic and skilful chairman to build it up. Learmonth's objectives of extending from Hawick to Carlisle, (a distance of 43 miles,) and establishing a network morth of the Forth, were in abeyance. At the end of 1855 the Company appointed Richard Hodgson as their Chairman. Taking over at a most difficult time, he was a leader as determined and ruthless as Learmonth, and equally determined to broaden the scope of the North British Railway, and to fight the Caledonian Railway wherever it was necessary.

GM604 GM604 is the temporary name of a drug under development by Genervon that is supposed to slow the progression of ALS. The drug is currently in the Phase II approval process of the FDA after a 12-week clinical trial was performed on 12 patients. Genervon has claimed that the trial revealed that treatment with GM604 resulted in a statistically significant and robust slow down in the progression of the disease. The results of this trial encouraged ALS support groups and patients to petition Congress and the FDA to speed up approval of the drug, with a petition on Change.org receiving nearly 800,000 signatures. Despite Genervon's claims, experts in the industry such as Steve Perrin, the chief executive officer of the ALS Therapy Development Institute, and John Carroll of Fiercebiotech.com have challenged the significance of the trial, specifically objecting to the small number of patients in the early- phase trial, and cautioned that an accelerated approval process seems premature.

Facts Tabbasum Mahomed and Azees Mahomed were the mother and father of Tahani, a 10-week-old baby who died on 1 January 2008 as \\"a result of a fracture to the skull at the back of her head, associated brain damage and a fractured thigh bone\\".Mahomed v R [2011] NZSC 52 at [25]. Medical evidence showed that Tahani had suffered these injuries around 12 hours before admission to hospital and that she had suffered two other rounds of injuries over between two and five weeks prior to admission.Mahomed v R [2011] NZSC 52 at [25]. As a result of police interception devices placed in the Mahomed's house the police learned that Azees Mahomed had inflicted the injuries, they acknowledged they had failed to properly look after Tahani and they were \\"concocting innocent explanations for what had happened to Tahani\\".Mahomed v R [2011] NZSC 52 at [31]. The evidence in contention in these proceedings was known as the \\"van incident\\", and involved the Mahomeds leaving Tahani, crying and covered in perspiration in their van near Otahuhu shopping centre on a warm day in December 2007.Mahomed v R [2011] NZSC 52 at [32]. After a security guard called the police Azees Mahomed left \\"the scene in a hurry\\".Mahomed v R [2011] NZSC 52 at [9]. In a trial before judge and jury Mr Mahomed was found guilty of murder and of twice intentionally causing grievous bodily harm; Mr Mahomed and Mrs Mahomed were also found guilty of failing to provide the necessaries of life (prompt medical treatment).Mahomed v R [2011] NZSC 52 at [21]. The Mahomeds appealed their convictions arguing inadmissibility of evidence of the van incident and improper trial directions to the jury by the judge on this evidence.Mahomed v R [2011] NZSC 52 at [22]. Legislation The case turned on the interpretation of sections 40 and 43 of the Evidence Act 2006. ;40 Propensity rule :(1) In this section and sections 41 to 43, propensity evidence— ::(a) means evidence that tends to show a person’s propensity to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind, being evidence of acts, omissions, events, or circumstances with which a person is alleged to have been involved; but ::(b) does not include evidence of an act or omission that is— :::(i) 1 of the elements of the offence for which the person is being tried; or :::(ii) the cause of action in the proceeding in question. :(2) A party may offer propensity evidence in a civil or criminal proceeding about any person. :(3) However, propensity evidence about— ::(a) a defendant in a criminal proceeding may be offered only in accordance with section 41 or 42 or 43, whichever section is applicable; and ::(b) a complainant in a sexual case in relation to the complainant’s sexual experience may be offered only in accordance with section 44. :(4) Evidence that is solely or mainly relevant to veracity is governed by the veracity rules set out in section 37 and, accordingly, this section does not apply to evidence of that kind. ;43 Propensity evidence offered by prosecution about defendants :(1) The prosecution may offer propensity evidence about a defendant in a criminal proceeding only if the evidence has a probative value in relation to an issue in dispute in the proceeding which outweighs the risk that the evidence may have an unfairly prejudicial effect on the defendant. :(2) When assessing the probative value of propensity evidence, the Judge must take into account the nature of the issue in dispute. :(3) When assessing the probative value of propensity evidence, the Judge may consider, among other matters, the following: ::(a) the frequency with which the acts, omissions, events, or circumstances that are the subject of the evidence have occurred: ::(b) the connection in time between the acts, omissions, events, or circumstances that are the subject of the evidence and the acts, omissions, events, or circumstances which constitute the offence for which the defendant is being tried: ::(c) the extent of the similarity between the acts, omissions, events, or circumstances that are the subject of the evidence and the acts, omissions, events, or circumstances which constitute the offence for which the defendant is being tried: ::(d) the number of persons making allegations against the defendant that are the same as, or are similar to, the subject of the offence for which the defendant is being tried: ::(e) whether the allegations described in paragraph (d) may be the result of collusion or suggestibility: ::(f) the extent to which the acts, omissions, events, or circumstances that are the subject of the evidence and the acts, omissions, events, or circumstances which constitute the offence for which the defendant is being tried are unusual. :(4) When assessing the prejudicial effect of evidence on the defendant, the Judge must consider, among any other matters,— ::(a) whether the evidence is likely to unfairly predispose the fact-finder against the defendant; and ::(b) whether the fact-finder will tend to give disproportionate weight in reaching a verdict to evidence of other acts or omissions. Judgments The Supreme Court dismissed the appeals. The Court gave two judgments, both of which, \\"took a broad approach to s 40(1) and were clear that its language requires a broad approach to determining what is propensity evidence. In the words of the minority, a “broad and literal approach” should be taken. Accordingly, the Court unanimously held that evidence that had been categorised by the Court of Appeal as part of the narrative, did fall squarely with s 40(1).\\" =Elias CJ, Blanchard and Tipping JJ= The majority judgment given by Justice Tipping began by noting that \\"The greater the linkage or coincidence provided by the propensity evidence, the greater the probative value that evidence is likely to have.\\"Mahomed v R [2011] NZSC 52 at [3]. The judgment also stated that not \\"a great deal\\" could be gained from the pre-Evidence Act case law on propensity evidence.Mahomed v R [2011] NZSC 52 at [5]. The majority then held that in deciding on admissibility, > \\"In order to make the necessary assessment the court must carefully identify > how and to what extent the propensity evidence has sufficient particularity > to be probative, and how and to what extent it risks being unfairly > prejudicial. Obviously any evidence that is probative will be prejudicial to > the accused but not normally unfairly so. Unfairness is generally found when > and to the extent the evidence carries with it a risk that the jury will use > it for an improper purpose or in support of an impermissible process of > reasoning. In assessing the probative value/unfair prejudice balance, the > court may need to take into account the extent to which it considers a > \\"proper use\\" direction in the trial judge’s summing-up is likely to guard > against the risk of improper use.\\"Mahomed v R [2011] NZSC 52 at [7]. The majority also noted \\"it is necessary to identify with some specificity the \\"particular\\" state of mind the propensity evidence tends to show and relate that to the states of mind required for each offence.\\"Mahomed v R [2011] NZSC 52 at [8]. The majority concluded that the \\"van incident\\" evidence was admissible only in respect of the charge of failing to provide the necessities of life and that the judge's trial directions on the evidence were \\"problematical\\" and \\"misleading\\".Mahomed v R [2011] NZSC 52 at [14]-[15]. Satisfied that a miscarriage of justice had occurred, the majority went on to hold that considering the weight of evidence the jury's decisions were inevitable, \\"in the sense of being the only reasonable possible verdicts on the admissible evidence\\".Mahomed v R [2011] NZSC 52 at [18]. =McGrath and William Young JJ= Justice William Young, giving the minority opinion held that the evidence of the 'van incident' was admissible on all charges.Mahomed v R [2011] NZSC 52 at [78]. McGrath and William Young JJ also held that for propensity evidence “if probative value and the risk of unfair prejudice were equal, exclusion would only be required by s 43”.Mahomed v R [2011] NZSC 52 at [66]. Significance The Mahomed decision is the leading decision in how to interpret section 43 of the Evidence Act 2006. In December 2009 Mr Mahomed was sentenced to a minimum prison sentence of seventeen years and Mrs Mahomed to four years, for crimes described by the sentencing judge as \\"callous and cowardly\\".

Ivanov was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin for his leadership of the 6th Guards Rifle Division from late 1944 to 1945. Ivanov fought in World War II at the Battle of the Dnieper and the Vistula–Oder Offensive.  Early life  Georgy Vasilyevich Ivanov was born on 25 May 1901 in Upornikov in the Khopyorsky Okrug of the Don Host Oblast to a peasant family. In 1911, Ivanov's father died of his war wounds from the Russo-Japanese War. Ivanov graduated from primary school. In 1919, Ivanov joined the Red Army. He served in the Russian Civil War on the Don River as a private in the 5th Amur Cossack Cavalry Regiment of the 1st Cavalry Army. After the regiment was withdrawn to the reserve, Ivanov fell ill with typhus and spent two months in the hospital. After recovering, he returned to the front and fought battles near Novocherkassk.  Interwar  After completing the 10th Novocherkassk Cavalry Command Course between July 1921 and September 1922, Ivanov was posted to the 19th Manych Cavalry Regiment of the 4th Cavalry Division in February 1923, stationed in the North Caucasus Military District. There he served as an assistant platoon commander, starshina of the 1st Squadron, and as an acting platoon commander. Transferred to the 20th Salsk Cavalry Regiment of the division in November, Ivanov served with the latter as an acting platoon commander and starshina of the 2nd Squadron. Sent to study at the Kiev Combined Military School in September 1924, he returned to the 4th Division, now relocated to the Leningrad Military District, to serve a platoon commander in its 21st Don-Stavropol Cavalry Regiment following his graduation in August 1926. In 1927, he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. After completing the courses of physical education at the Leningrad Military- Pedagogical School between November 1928 and August 1929, Ivanov returned to his previous position with the 21st Regiment, briefly serving as an acting squadron commander. Placed at the disposal of the 4th Directorate of the Staff of the Red Army in December 1929, Ivanov was sent to Mongolia as an advisor to the 3rd Cavalry Regiment of the 17th Cavalry Division of the Mongolian People's Army. Upon his return to the Soviet Union in December 1932, he became a student of the command department of the Military Academy of Mechanization and Motorization. By now a major, Ivanov was appointed commander of the 7th Mechanized Regiment of the 7th Cavalry Division following his graduation from the academy in December 1937. In 1940, he graduated from the Military Academy of the General Staff. After graduation, Ivanov became an officer in the Belorussian Direction of the General Staff.  World War II  On 22 June, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa, began. By 27 June, the Red Army General Staff had almost no reliable information from the Belorussian Special Military District. To clarify the situation, Ivanov flew in an Ilyushin Il-4 escorted by two fighters to meet with front commander Dmitry Pavlov. After flying over two German tank columns, Ivanov's aircraft landed at the headquarters of the 3rd Long-range Bomber Aviation Corps. On 29 July, his aircraft took off in another attempt to find Pavlov's headquarters but was shot down. Ivanov and the crew received shrapnel wounds, and he was evacuated to Moscow for treatment. After leaving the hospital, he taught at the Frunze Military Academy and participated in the defence of Moscow, helping to erect fortifications near Poklonnaya Hill during September. He was evacuated along with the academy to Central Asia. In March 1942, Ivanov became the chief of staff of the 24th Rifle Corps, part of the 60th Army. He fought in the Battle of the Dnieper during September 1943. For his actions during the battle, Ivanov was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on 20 September.Order No. 198 Central Front, available online at pamyat-naroda.ru He then fought in the Battle of Kiev.

It was supposed that the portrait was painted in 1623 during Charles' eight-month visit to Spain where the future monarch failed in his attempt to secure the hand of the Spanish Habsburg princess Maria Anna. A protracted court case in Scotland with trustees from the estate of the Earl of Fife arose over the ownership of the work and this eventually brought Snare to financial ruin. Following the trial, Snare emigrated to New York City. After Snare's death, the Velázquez passed to Snare's son, and went on display briefly in 1885 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The painting has not been seen again since.

This contact resulted in the gradual replacement of Classical Arabic forms with Western ones. Genres like plays, novels, and short stories were coming to the fore. Although the exact date in which this reformation in literary production occurred is unknown, the rise of modern Arabic literature was \\"inseparable\\" from the Nahda, also referred to as the Arab Renaissance. Aleppine writer Qustaki al-Himsi (1858–1941) is credited with having founded modern Arabic literary criticism, with one of his works, The researcher's source in the science of criticism.Al-Jamahir newspaper:The Son of Aleppo, Qustaki al-Himsi the Voyager Poet (in Arabic) Context The development that Arabic Literature witnessed by the end of the 19th century was not merely in the form of reformation; for both maronite Germanos Farhat (died 1732) and al-Allusi in Iraq had previously attempted to inflict some change on Arabic literature in the 18th century. On the other hand, modern Arabic literature fully appeared through the interdependence between two important movements: the revival of the classical Arabic tradition and the translation of foreign literature. Advocates of the former movement began their work at the onset of the 19th century to resist the decline Arabic literature and its styles were facing. High quality traditional literary models were thus disseminated and imitated to create new literary models. Meanwhile, proponents of the translation movement included an array of authors such as Nasif al-Yaziji (1800–1871) from Lebanon, Ali Mubarak (born 1823 or 1824; died 1893) from Egypt, and Mahmoud Shukri al-Alusi (died 1923) from Iraq. Both Mubarak and al-Yaziji wrote the maqamat (lengthy literary works of rhymed prose) Alam Eddin and Majma' al-Bahrain (Where Two Seas Meet) respectively, while al-Alusi authored Balaghat al-Arab (The Eloquence of the Arabs). Other factors, including journalism and the literature of the diaspora, helped in shaping and developing Arabic literature. =Translations= The translation movement began on the hands of Governor Muhammad Ali of Egypt while forming his army. He fostered the endeavor by importing the first printer in 1828 to Egypt (the second printer was brought later to Syria). Among the most prominent translators during that period was Rifa'a al-Tahtawi (1801–1873), who translated many scientific books for the army's use. Al-Tahtawi's influence is mostly recognized, however, in Talkhis al-Ibriz (Paris's Profile), in which he documented his visit to Paris. This book, written in a modern style, is an account of the political and social conditions in France during that time as perceived by the author. Al-Tahtawi was also the first translator of a literary novel, Les Aventures de Télémaque by French writer François Fénelon, into Arabic. However, the mark al-Tahtawi left on the literary reformation was witnessed later via his various contributions. Most of the early novels to have been translated into Arabic were of French origins. Famous works including Alexandre Dumas's Le Comte de Monte Cristo, Jules Verne's Cinq Semaines en Ballon, and many others from different genres, were readily translated and Arabized and found a large readership through their circulation in journals. Schools that were established in Beirut and Tunisia for authorship and translation affected, and were in turn influenced by, the direct impact of missionaries in Lebanon. These Lebanese missionaries were led by Ahmad Faris al-Shidyaq (born 1805 or 1806; died 1887), Butrus al-Bustani (1819–1883), Ibrahim al-Yaziji (1847–1906), and, from Tunisia, Mohamed Bayram V (1840–1889). All of these missionaries helped in the creation of Arabic journalism, which was the main force (second to the revival of traditional Arabic literature and the translation movement) in initiating the new literary movement. In Egypt, journalism, first aided by intellectuals from the Levant, and later becoming a genuine Egyptian endeavor, was considered the pivotal ingredient that polished new literary styles and helped in the dissemination of ideas and opinions. Such was the natural and organic atmosphere for the development of modern Arabic literature. The translation movement also revived on the hands of the literary figures of the New York Pen League. Although the Pen's translation did not directly affect the development of modern literature (unlike the translations of al-Manfaluti and Othman Jalal); translation, as that undertaken during Ibn al-Muqaffa' and al-Jahiz's time, did, nevertheless, help in finding the true literary essence in both Arabic and foreign literature. Without translation, regardless of its quality, modern Arabic literature would not have reached different horizons. Translation also influenced the Arabic repertoire of imageries and ideas. Most importantly, it introduced new literary genres, such as novels, plays, short stories, articles, etc. The first effect of translation was in the adaptations of foreign plays. It began with Maroun al-Naqqash's (died 1855) adaptation of Molière, and Najib Haddad's (died 1866) translations of Pierre Corneille, Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas, and William Shakespeare. However, the most successful attempts in the adaptations of foreign dramas were on the hands of Muhammad Othman Jalal (died 1898), who adapted from Molière, and Arabized the novel Paul et Virginie. Despite all these efforts, the play, as a distinct literary genre, did not reach its full popularity until the 20th Century. =Journalism= In the final thirty years of the 19th century, the growth of journalism helped in the emergence of notable figures in literature. It also created a comprehensive image of the stages of the development of the literary prose genres-excluding poetry- until World War I. On the pages of newspapers and journals met the powerful classical prose of Muhammad Abduh (1849–1905), and the nationalist- laden expressive prose of Saad Zaghloul in Al-Waqa'i' al-Misriyya (Egyptian Affairs) newspaper. Was also seen Muhammad al-Muwailihi's rhyming prose (died 1930), Mustafa Lutfi al-Manfaluti's sweet romantic prose (1876–1924), as well as the works of Jurji Zaydan (1861–1914), Yagob Sarrof (died 1927), and Qasim Amin (1863–1908) that relied on uniform ideas and lucid expressions to perform social-educational purposes. As for romantic valor (hamasah), such as the works of Mustafa Kamil (1874–1908) and Wali Eddin Yakun (died 1921), this genre first appeared in journals. Other genres such as sardonic narratives mixed with colloquialisms, as in the works of Yaqub Sanu (1839–1912) and Abdullah al-Nadim (died 1896), gained their socio-literary power from appearing in journals. 19th and 20th century Through the 19th century and early 20th centuries, a number of new developments in Arabic literature started to emerge, initially sticking closely to the classical forms, but addressing modern themes and the challenges faced by the Arab world in the modern era. Francis Marrash (born between 1835 and 1837; died 1873 or 1874) was influential in introducing French romanticism in the Arab world, especially through his use of poetic prose and prose poetry, of which his writings were the first examples in modern Arabic literature, according to Salma Khadra Jayyusi and Shmuel Moreh.; . He also tried to introduce \\"a revolution in diction, themes, metaphor and imagery in modern Arabic poetry\\",. sometimes even mocking conventional poetic themes.. In Egypt, Ahmad Shawqi (1868–1932), among others, began to explore the limits of the classical qasida, although he remained a clearly neo-classical poet. After him, others, including Hafez Ibrahim (1871–1932) began to use poetry to explore themes of anticolonialism as well as the classical concepts. In 1914, Muhammad Husayn Haykal (1888–1956) published Zaynab, often considered the first modern Egyptian novel. This novel started a movement of modernizing Arabic fiction. Jurji Zaydan (1861–1914) developed the genre of the Arabic historical novel. May Ziadeh (1886–1941) was also a key figure in the early 20th century Arabic literary scene. A group of young writers formed The New School, and in 1925 began publishing the weekly literary journal Al-Fajr (The Dawn), which would have a great impact on Arabic literature. The group was especially influenced by 19th-century Russian writers such as Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy and Gogol. At about the same time, the Mahjari poets, of whom the most famous is Kahlil Gibran (1883–1931), further contributed to the development of the forms available to Arab poets.See Somekh, \\"The Neo-Classical Poets\\" in M.M. Badawi (ed.) \\"Modern Arabic Literature\\", Cambridge University Press 1992, pp36-82 From the American diaspora emerged the new Pen League of authors like Gibran and Ameen Rihani (died 1940). The works produced by members of this league quickly spread through the Middle East, as new currents in modern Arabic prose took shape. Gibran, for instance, not only published works in both Arabic and English, but attempted to self-translate some of his works, such as his collection entitled Sand and Foam (1926). Some later returned to Lebanon, such as Mikha'il Na'ima (1898–1989). Literary genres=Novels= Arabic literature was not entirely lacking of narrative prose. There existed many lengthy works of literature such as Kitab al-Aghani (The Book of Songs) by Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani, Qisas al-anbiya'a (The Stories of Prophets) by al- Tha'alibi, as well as the eloquent maqama. This latter work, characterized by its embellishing rhythmic prose style, is thought to be the invention of Badi' al-Zaman al-Hamadani's (969–1007). The realization of the novel underwent extensive efforts to reach its full, complete form. The first attempts in writing novels were on the hands of Jurji Zaydan in his historical novel Sukot (Silence), and Farah Antun's (1874–1922) experimentation in the analytical novel. Other writers benefited from the foreign repertoire in discussing social and political matters. Non-fiction Arabic books were hence written to reflect new current concerns as well as the authors' thoughts and convictions. This is clearly present in the writings of Abd al-Rahman al-Kawakibi (born 1854 or 1855; died 1902) in Taba'i al-Istibdad wa-Masari' al-Isti'bad (The Nature of Despotism) and Umm al-Qura, as well as Qasim Amin's Tahrir al-Mar'a (The Liberation of the Woman). Authors like Aisha Taymur (died 1902) and Malak Hifni Nasif (died 1918) were also inspired by the foreign cultures but maintained—along with Qasim Amin—an Islamic and didactic spirit. Poetry, on the other hand, was not affected by foreign models until World War I, and remained in its ridged form that was prevalent since the age of decadence. Nonetheless, poetry was slightly affected by some of the nationalistic issues and debates taking place across the Arab World. Famous poets of the period included Mahmoud Sami el-Baroudi (1839–1904), Ahmed Shawqi (1868–1932), and Hafez Ibrahim (1871–1932) from Egypt. These poets differed in their styles, sense of solidarity, and the degree of involvement in nationalist events. However, their names are usually associated with the rise of the neo-classical movement in poetry. Ibrahim al-Mazini (born 1889 or 1890; died 1949) was probably among the most prominent authors who employed his style in the production of new literary themes, when he wrote his successful social novel Ibrahim al-Kateb (Ibrahim the Writer), which was essentially a description of current social norms. Since then, the novel flourished through the contributions of many authors like: Tawfiq al-Hakim in Awdat erroh (The Return of the Spirit, 1933), followed by Abbas Mahmoud al-Aqqad's Sara (1933), Taymour's Nida'a al-Majhoul (The Call of the Unknown, 1939), while Muhammad Farid Abu Hadid wrote the all-Arabic novel Ibnat al-Muluk (The Daughter of Kings). The success this novel attained later supported Zaydan in his own endeavors. As for the psycho-analytical novel, it was introduced by Taha Hussein for the first time in his autobiographical novel Al-Ayyam (The Days, 1926). This novel was one of the greatest works of modern Arabic literature with its themes, style and depiction of life. =Short stories and articles= Authors in Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and the Mahjar wrote many short stories. However, it was the article, of all genres, that had undergone profound development and change. The reason for this was due to the rise of and the attention which journals and newspapers received since the Egyptian revolution of 1919. The articles changed in style and form and were tailored towards discussing various topics, including social and political issues, literature, religion, etc. It eventually reached the elevated level of its foreign counterpart. Among the important topics discussed in articles were the reformation of the Arabic culture and its comparison with foreign traditions and civilizations, including Latin and Greek traditions. Writers of articles included Taha Hussein and Abbas Mahmoud al-Aqqad, advocates of innovation of style; the conservative Muhammad Rashid Rida (1865–1935) who wrote for the magazine Al-Manar; as well as Farid Wajdi and Mostafa Saadeq al-Rafe'ie (1880–1937). From Syria, there was Muhammad Kurd Ali (1876–1953), and from Lebanon and the Diaspora Mikha'il Na'ima (1889-1988). Whether they were supporters of innovative or traditional styles, these authors played an important role in reforming old and new notions of both extreme ends; they found a balance between the two directions after an extensive filtration of ideas and opinions. In addition, these authors influenced the following current of thought which promoted scientific reasoning in the process of writing the article. Later on, social criticism, which had already become an active element in the article, found its place in the novel. For example, this could be seen clearly in the novels of Tawfiq al-Hakim, Husayn Fawzi's The Modern Sindibad, as well as in the works of Naguib Mahfouz, Hassan Kamil, and many more. Subsequent to that, the novel took a turn in realism, disregarded style, and promoted many political currents, particularly after World War II. =Plays= The musical plays of Lebanese Maroun Naccache from the mid-1800s are considered the birth of not only theatre in Lebanon, but also modern Arab theatre. Modern Arabic drama began to be written in the 19th century chiefly in Egypt and mainly influenced and in imitation of French works. It was not until the 20th century that it began to develop a distinctly Arab flavour and be seen elsewhere. The most important Arab playwright was Tawfiq al-Hakim whose first play was a re-telling of the Qur'anic story of the Seven sleepers and the second an epilogue for the Thousand and One Nights. As is the case with other literary genres, the first accounts of plays during that period were in the form of translations and adaptations of Western works. Gradually, however, the stage, particularly in Egypt, reached its full potency as Egyptian dramatist began writing plays that reflected the current socio- political situation of the country and its people. A major theme that was recurrent in most of the plays was the West-East struggle; an issue that seemed to have both coincided and aggravated the search for an Egyptian national identity. The shift towards realism that took place in writing the novel extended to the play. Dramatic plays, particularly in Egypt, flourished immensely, and subsequently dominated the rest of the Arab world. In that reals, Mahmoud Taymour was the first to experiment with the social realist play, but it did not reach its full potency except on the hands of Tawfiq al- Hakim, who mastered motifs and mental representations, utilized Pharaonic, Islamic, and Western myths, and wrote remarkable cognitive plays such as Ahl al-Kahf (The People of the Cave), and Scheherazade. He also wrote social plays including Al-Sultan al-Ha'er (the Bewildered Sultan). Shawqi's contributions to the poetic theater, taken up later by Aziz Abaza, are noticeable for their dealing with historical and classical themes. The employment of colloquial Arabic within the dialogues of the plays was a central issue in studying Arab litterateurs and their motives behind such act. The issue, however, was not as prominent in novels and stories as it was in plays. Nevertheless, al-Hakim and Taymour both tried to utilize colloquialisms in dialogues in both novels and stories, yet their success did not stop the debate that had risen as a result. In fact, it led Taymour to refrain from using colloquialisms in his writings, and he rewrote his previous works by replacing any colloquialisms with Modern Standard Arabic. Despite many efforts to create a distinct colloquial literature, particularly in Lebanon, all attempts failed. Reaching a necessary compromise between the two was done by simplifying the Standard form and elevating the status of the colloquial. However, judgments of this issue and its implications are yet to be explored, although some argue that the use of colloquialism in Arabic drama is a direct result from the interaction with the Western forms of literary production. Both the spread of education and of Standard Arabic offered solutions for the instability the Arabic status was facing. Some of these solutions were due to the journal article as it created a new form of prose, characterized by precision and an ability to portray reality in a way that surpassed eloquent prose, where meaning in the latter is not definite, and gives the sense of the older era of Arabia. Through this new variety of language, the modern author was now able to find in the Standard form of Arabic many specific expressions that allowed him to portray reality. =Poetry= Poetry made way for prose, particularly after the war. While the influence of Western literature accelerated the production of innovative literary prose in Arabic, poetry was slower in liberating itself from classical poetic forms and creating new rhythms and melodic moods. As classical Arabic poetry held an important position in the literary heritage of the Arabs, it is not surprising that the first attempts in renewing the poetic forms would be by a re-employment of these traditional forms. Insofar as Suleyman al-Boustani's (died 1925) attempt in introducing new forms by a rather mediocre translation of the Iliad into Arabic, the role it played was weaker than to be mentioned in the movement towards reformation. Nationalist poetry was an important element in the progression of modern verse, whose doyen is Tunisian poet Aboul-Qacem Echebbi (died 1934). Echebbi succeeded in using traditional models and imageries to present new and powerful reflections of the current time. Others tried to create psychological effects by playing with rhymes and old structures. Gradually, classical poetic forms were replaced by newer forms. The guiding force behind that change is due to literary schools of thought such as al-Diwan Group, led mainly by poets Abbas Mahmoud al-Aqqad, Ibrahim al-Mazini, and Abdel Rahman Shokry (influenced by neo-romanticism); the New York Pen League, which included Elia Abu Madi; and the Andalusian League, which included Rashid Salim al-Khoury and Fawzi Ma'louf. Members of all these schools called for a change in the poetic production. They also advocated liberating poetry from classical forms, as well as a call for sincerity of emotions, self-inspiration, and portrayal of direct feelings. The result of these efforts was a powerful Romantic poetry (ghazal). The pioneers of this type of poetry were the members of the Apollo Group. Led by Ahmed Zaki Abu Shadi (died 1955), and competing against the New School of Khalil Mutran in Egypt, and Elias Abu Shabaki's in Lebanon, the Diwan Poets, and the Leagues, the Apollo Group was more liberated and largely influenced by Western Romanticism. The Apollo Group's contributions to the new, unrestricted forms of poetry is largely manifested in the periodical 'Apollo', a magazine that fostered and proliferated both traditional and innovative styles of poetry. While al-Aqqad and other poets in Iraq remained faithful to classical forms of poetry, others, including poet Abdel Rahman Shokry, the Northern Diaspora School, and the Apollo Group, all diverted greatly from these traditional forms. In fact, the argument that existed between the proponents of Classical poetry who favored the single-rhyme and meter poem, and those advocated the free verse poem (shi'r hurr) remains till this day. A few years later, the prose poem appeared in the 1970s. Writers of this hybrid form were Ameen al-Rihani, Onsy Al-Hajj, and Shawqi Abi Shaqra (Lebanon), Jabra Ibrahim Jabra, Tawfiq Al-Sayegh, Ezz Eddin al-Munasira (Palestine), Muhammad al-Maghut (Syria), Sargon Boulus, Fadil Al-Azzawi, Mu'ayyid al-Rawi (Iraq). Al-Rawi created a new genre in Arabic poetry by liberating it from rhythm and metre, and replacing that with inner music, while maintaining the original imageries. Themes=Social themes= Social themes along with reformations in the field of poetry were not greatly affected despite the attempts some poets such as Khalil Mutran (1872–1949) to inflict some changes on the genre. Other attempts were made by Jamil Sidqi al- Zahawi (1863–1936) and al-Rasafi (1875–1954) in Iraq, though with little or no implications. This can be due to the fact that poetry in Iraq did not suffer the same decline as it did in Egypt and the Levant, which were under unstable political circumstances. After the war, modern Arabic literature changed dramatically. Topics such as modernity and social change, and people's interests and doubts, all became the center of the new themes of literature. The first to have undertaken this change are the disciples of Mohammad Abduh, who were advocates of liberated and innovative thought. These students eventually governed Al-Jarida (The Newspaper) and Al-Siyasa (The Politics), two newspapers which were jointly edited by Lutfy Asyyed and Muhammad Husayn Haykal. These newspapers also proliferated the new literary genres of novels, stories, articles and plays. One of the first successful realizations of these genres was Haykal's novel Zaynab (1914) which demonstrated the difficulty of wielding Arabic rhetoric in writing the social novel. Mohammad Taymour (died 1921) tried to overcome these difficulties with his novel Ma taraho al-Oyon (What the eyes see), a task that was supported by his brother's (Mahmoud Taymour) efforts. Many others including Issa Obeid, Shahata Obeid, and Taher Lasheen contributed to the novel, yet were never able to reach the elevated stylistic and linguistic abilities of the Taymour brothers in their portrayal of a realistic and vivid life.

Here a Montagu's harrier chick has just hatched from its egg. Animals make use of a variety of modes of reproduction to produce their young. Traditionally this variety was classified into three modes, oviparity (embryos in eggs), viviparity (young born live), and ovoviviparity (intermediate between the first two). However, each of those so-called traditional modes covered a wide range of diverse reproductive strategies. The biologist Thierry Lodé has accordingly proposed five modes of reproduction based on the relationship between the zygote (the fertilised egg) and the parents. His revised modes are ovuliparity, with external fertilisation; oviparity, with internal fertilisation of large eggs containing a substantial nutritive yolk; ovo-viviparity, that is oviparity where the zygotes are retained for a time in a parent's body, but without any sort of feeding by the parent; histotrophic viviparity, where the zygotes develop in the female's oviducts, but are fed on other tissues; and hemotrophic viviparity, where the developing embryos are fed by the mother, often through a placenta. Traditional modes The three traditional modes of reproduction are: * Oviparity, taken to be the ancestral condition, is traditionally where either unfertilised oocytes or fertilised eggs are spawned. * Viviparity, traditionally including any mechanism where young are born live, or where the development of the young is supported by either parent in or on any part of their body. * Ovoviviparity, traditionally covering mechanisms which span the modes of oviparity and viviparity. It can be seen that so defined, these traditional modes each covered a range of reproductive strategies. Revised modes The biologist Thierry Lodé proposed (2001, 2012) five modes of reproduction based on the relationship between the zygote (fertilised egg) and the parents:Thierry Lodé (2001). Les stratégies de reproduction des animaux (Reproduction Strategies in Animal Kingdom). Eds. Dunod Sciences. Paris. * Ovuliparity: fertilisation is external, the oocytes being released into the environment and fertilised outside the body by the male. This is common in molluscs, arthropods and fishes, and is found in most frogs. * Oviparity: fertilisation is internal, but the female lays zygotes as eggs with a substantial quantity of yolk to feed the embryo while it remains in the egg. The egg is not retained in the body, or only for a limited time. Oviparity is found in birds. Among mammals, the monotremes (four species of Echidna, and the Platypus) are oviparous. * Ovo-viviparity: or oviparity with retention of zygotes in either the female's or in the male's body, but there are no trophic interactions between zygote and parents. This mode is found in the slowworm, Anguis fragilis. In the sea horse, zygotes are retained in the male's ventral \\"marsupium\\". In the frog Rhinoderma darwinii, the zygotes develop in the vocal sac. In the recently extinct frogs Rheobatrachus, zygotes developed in the stomach. * Histotrophic viviparity: the zygotes develop in the female's oviducts, but find their nutriments from other tissues, whether skin or glandular tissue, oophagy or adelphophagy (intra-uterine cannibalism in some sharks or in the black salamander Salamandra atra). * Hemotrophic viviparity: nutrients are provided by the female, often through a placenta, as in mammals except for marsupials and monotremes. In the frog Gastrotheca ovifera, embryos are fed by the mother through specialized gills. The lizard Pseudomoia pagenstecheri and most mammals use this form of viviparity. Thus the definition of oviparity is narrower in the revised scheme, as it does not include the \\"ovuliparity\\" found in most fish, most frogs and many invertebrates.

Certain tests may change normal behavior. Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) are one of several rodents used in animal testing. Syrian hamsters are used to model human medical conditions including various cancers, metabolic diseases, non-cancer respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, infectious diseases, and general health concerns. In 2014, Syrian hamsters accounted for 14.6% of the total animal research participants in the United States covered by the Animal Welfare Act. Use in research Since 1972 the use of hamsters in animal testing research has declined. In 2014 in the United States, animal research used about 120,000 hamsters, which was 14.6% of the total research animal use (under the Animal Welfare Act which excludes mice, rats, and fish) for that year in that country. According to the Canadian Council for Animal Care, a total of 1,931 hamsters were used for research in 2013 in Canada, making them the sixth-most popular rodent after mice (1,233,196), rats (228,143), guinea pigs (20,687), squirrels (4,446) and voles (2,457).CCAC – CCAC Animal Data Report 2013 Human medical research=Cancer research= Humans get lung cancer from tobacco smoking.Valentine 2012, p. 877 cites * Syrian hamsters are a model for researching Non-small-cell lung carcinoma, which is one of the types of human lung cancer. In research, when hamsters are injected with the carcinogen NNK several times over six months, they will develop that sort of cancer. In both Syrian hamsters and humans, this cancer is associated with mutations to the KRAS gene.Valentine 2012, p. 877 cites * For various reasons, collecting data on the way that Syrian hamsters develop this lung cancer provides insight on how humans develop it. Oral squamous-cell carcinoma is a common cancer in humans and difficult to treat.Valentine 2012, pp. 877-878 cites * Scientists studying this disease broadly accept Syrian hamsters as animal models for researching it. In this research, the hamster is given anesthesia, has its mouth opened to expose the inside of its cheeks, and the researcher brushes the carcinogen DMBA on its cheeks. The scientist can take cell samples from the mouth of the hamster to measure the development of the cancer. This process has good reproducibility. The cancer itself develops tumors in a predictable way starting with hyperkeratosis, then hyperplasia, then dysplasia, then carcinoma. In humans with this cancer there is increased ErbB2 production of receptor tyrosine kinase and Syrian hamsters with this cancer also have increased levels of that kinase.Valentine 2012, pp. 877-878 cites * As the tumor develops in the hamster, they also have increased gene expression in p53 and c-myc which is similar to human cancer development.Valentine 2012, pp. 877-878 cites * Because hamsters develop this cancer so predictably, researchers are comfortable in using hamsters in research on prevention and treatment.Valentine 2012, p. 877-878 cites * There is scientific and social controversy about the virus SV40 causing cancers in human.Valentine 2012, pp. 877-878 cites * Leaving that controversy aside, Syrian hamsters injected with SV40 certainly will develop various cancers in predictable ways depending on how they are exposed to the virus.Valentine 2012, p. 878 cites * The hamster has been used as a research model to clarify what SV40 does in humans. The golden hamster can contract contagious reticulum cell sarcoma which can be transmitted from one golden hamster to another by means of the bite of the mosquito Aedes aegypti. =Metabolic disorders= Syrian hamsters are susceptible to many metabolic disorders which affect humans.Valentine et al. 2012, p. 879 cites  Because of this, hamsters are an excellent animal model for studying human metabolic disorder. Gallstones may be induced in Syrian hamsters by giving the hamster excess dietary cholesterol or sucrose.Valentine et al. 2012, p. 880 cites * Hamsters metabolize cholesterol in a way that is similar to humans. Different sorts of fats are more or less likely to produce gallstones in hamsters. The gender differences in gallstone formation in hamsters is significant. Hamsters of different genetic strains have significant differences in susceptibility to forming gallstones. Diabetes mellitus is studied in various ways using Syrian hamsters. Hamsters which are feed fructose for 7 days get hyperinsulinemia and hyperlipidemia. Such hamsters then have an increase in hepatic lipase and other measurable responses which are useful for understanding diabetes in humans. Streptozotocin or alloxan may be administered to induce chronic diabetes in hamsters. Atherosclerosis may be studied with Syrian hamsters because both organisms have similar lipid metabolism. Hamsters develop atherosclerosis as a result of dietary manipulation. Hamsters develop atherosclerotic plaques as humans do. =Non-cancer respiratory disease= Smoke inhalation can be studied on Syrian hamsters by putting the hamster in a laboratory smoking machine. Pregnant hamsters have been used to model the effects of smoking on pregnant humans. The emphysema component of COPD may be induced in hamsters by injecting pancreatic elastase into their tracheas.Valentine 2012, p. 883 cites  Pulmonary fibrosis may be induced in hamsters by injecting bleomycin into their tracheas. =Cardiovascular= Cardiomyopathy in hamsters is an inherited condition and there are genetic lines of hamsters which are bred to retain this gene so that they may be used to study the disease. Microcirculation may be studied in hamster cheek pouches.Valentine 2012, p. 885 cites  The pouches of hamsters are thin, easy to examine without stopping bloodflow, and highly vascular. When examined, the cheek pouch is pulled through the mouth while being grasped with forceps. At this point the cheek is everted and can be pinned onto a mount for examination. Reperfusion injury may be studied with everted hamster pouches also. To simulate reperfusion, one method is to tie a cuff around the pouch to restrict blood flow and cause ischemia. Another method could be to compress the veins and arteries with microvascular clips which do not cause trauma. In either case, after about an hour of restricting the blood, the pressure is removed to study how the pouch recovers. Several inbred strains of hamsters have been developed as animal models for human forms of dilated cardiomyopathy. The gene responsible for hamster cardiomyopathy in a widely studied inbred hamster strain, BIO14.6, has been identified as being delta- sarcoglycan. Pet hamsters are also potentially prone to cardiomyopathy, which is a not infrequent cause of unexpected sudden death in adolescent or young adult hamsters. =Infection research= Syrian hamsters have been infected with a range of disease causing agents to study both the disease and the cause of the disease. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is a medical condition in humans caused by any of the Hantavirus species. Syrian hamsters easily contract Hantavirus species, but they do not get the same symptoms as humans, and the same infection that is deadly in humans have effects ranging from nothing to flu to death in Syrian hamsters. Because hamsters become easily infected, they are used to study the pathogenesis of Hantavirus. Andes virus and Maporal viruses infect hamsters and cause pneumonia and edema. The Sin Nombre virus and Choclo virus will infect hamsters but not cause any disease. SARS coronavirus causes severe acute respiratory syndrome in humans. Syrian hamsters may be infected with the virus, and like humans will have viral replication and lesions in the respiratory tract which can be examined with histopathological tests. However, hamsters do not develop clinical symptoms of the disease. Hamsters might be used to study the infection process. Leptospira viruses cause Leptospirosis in humans and similar symptoms in Syrian hamsters. Syrian hamsters are used to test drugs to treat the disease. Bacteria which have been studied by infection Syrian hamsters with them include Leptospira, Clostridium difficile, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Treponema pallidum. Parasites which have been studied by infecting Syrian hamsters with them include Toxoplasma gondii, Babesia microti, Leishmania donovani, Trypanosoma cruzi, Opisthorchis viverrini, Taenia, Ancylostoma ceylanicum, and Schistosoma. Syrian hamsters are infected with scrapie so that they get transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. In March 2020, researchers from the University of Hong Kong have shown that Syrian hamsters could be a model organism for COVID-19 research. =Other medical conditions= Scientists use male hamsters to study the effects of steroids on male behavior. The behavior of castrated hamsters is compared to typical male hamsters. Castrated hamsters are then given steroids and their behavior noted. Some steroid treatments will cause castrated hamsters to do behaviors that typical male hamsters do. Poor nutrition may cause female infertility in mammals.Valentine et al. 2012, p. 896 cites * When hamsters do not have enough of the right food, they have fewer estrous cycles.Valentine et al. 2012, p. 896 cites * Studies in hamsters identify the nutritional needs for maintaining fertility. Syrian hamsters are used to study how NSAIDs can cause reactive gastropathy. One way to study is to inject hamsters with indometacin, which causes an ulcer within 1-5 hours depending on the dose.Valentine et al. 2012, p. 897 cites * If repeatedly given doses, hamsters get severe lesions and die within 5 days from peptic ulcers in their pyloric antrum. A model for creating a chronically ill hamster which will not die from the ulcers is to give naproxen by gavage.Valentine 2012, p. 897 cites * * When the hamster is chronically ill, it can be used to test anti-ulcer drugs. Syrian hamsters are also widely used in research into alcoholism, by virtue of their large livers, and ability to metabolise high doses.Alcohol: an ancient medicine New York Times Nathalie Angier 11 September 2007 Research on Syrian hamsters themselves In captivity, golden hamsters follow well-defined daily routines of running in their hamster wheel, which has made them popular subjects in circadian rhythms research. For example, Martin Ralph, Michael Menaker, and colleagues used this behavior to provide definitive evidence that the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the brain is the source of mammalian circadian rhythms.Ralph, M.R., et al., Transplanted Suprachiasmatic Nucleus Determines Circadian Period. Science, 1990. 247(4945): pp. 975-978. Hamsters have a number of fixed action patterns that are readily observed, including scent-marking and body grooming, which is of interest in the study of animal behavior. Scientific studies of animal welfare concerning captive golden hamsters have shown they prefer to use running wheels of large diameters (35 cm diameter was preferred over 23 cm, and 23 cm over 17.5 cm,), and that they prefer bedding material which allows them to build nests, if nesting material is not already available. They prefer lived-in bedding (up to two weeks old - longer durations were not tested) over new bedding, suggesting they may prefer bedding changes at two-week intervals rather than weekly or daily. They also prefer opaque tubes closed at one end, 15 cm in diameter, to use as shelter in which to nest and sleep.

It was built in 1943 by Royal Australian Air Force. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 February 2001.  History  The Charlie's Hill Radio Direction and Ranging (RADAR) Station, located south of the town of Home Hill, was constructed in 1943 as part of the World War II defences mounted in north Queensland. It was constructed by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). With the imminent threat of war with Japan in the Pacific the Australian Government had been looking to the resources of north Queensland from the late 1930s. Following the declaration of war on Japan on 9 December 1941, Japan launched simultaneous attacks on Hawaii, Hong Kong and Malaya. Immediate action was taken to construct military installations in north Queensland. The bombing of Darwin (March 1942) and Townsville (July 1942) and the arrival of American troops in the north (from March 1942) accelerated plans to establish facilities in the area. However the shifting of the war to New Guinea in May 1942 intensified the military presence in the area as the important role the north would play in the defence against Japan was recognised. Radar stations were established along the north Queensland coast during WWII to give the earliest possible warning of approaching enemy aircraft. The RAAF installed No 211 Radar Station on Charlie's Hill in late 1943. It was one of twenty radar installations established along the north Queensland coastline. Whilst many were established in remote locations, the station at Charlie's Hill was located near the town of Home Hill just south of the Burdekin River. The installation, known as a 200 Series, fixed ground \\"high flying\\" radar station was one of only two of this type located in north Queensland (the other being No 220 at Bones Knob, Tolga). The 211 Radar Station utilised British Advanced Chain Overseas (ACO) equipment, operated in the HF band at 42.05 megacycles per second, which is a wave length of about , and had height finding capabilities. Two wooden towers, which were assembled in kit form, stood approximately apart, and supported the transmitting and receiving aerials. The equipment was housed in two above ground semi-circular bomb-proof igloos constructed of reinforced concrete. The eastern igloo housed the receiving equipment whilst the western igloo housed the transmitting equipment. It is believed that these igloos were designed to be built underground, with a short access tower at the end, although the tower would have also provided much needed ventilation. Other services provided at the site include a camp-site of huts, mess and toilet facilities and a power generator. These were constructed at the base of the hill on the north-western side. The No 211 Radar Station was maintained and operated by a radar unit made up of members of the RAAF and Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF). The radar units were usually small, numbering around 35 personnel. The station was operated for 24-hours a day with the shifts usually divided into three eight-hour shifts - day, evening and night. Each shift comprised three-four people - one recording the incoming messages, one working on the plotting table, one operator, and a fourth person to operate the telephone. During a shift the personnel would rotate every two hours, to help break up the monotony of the work. The RAAF staff, who lived on site, maintained and operated the station. The WAAAF staff, who worked as operators, plotters, and recorders, were on site during daylight hours only. The WAAAF personnel were accommodated in the hotel at Home Hill. Following the surrender of Japan in August 1945 military installations in north Queensland were disbanded. The Charlie's Hill Radar Station ceased operating on 1 October 1945. The equipment was dismantled and removed. Before leaving the area, the officers and operators of the unit, in return for the hospitality of the Home Hill residents, hosted a tennis afternoon, dinner and dance in the town. Since the end of World War II, the site of the No 211 Radar Station, Charlie's Hill has been maintained by the Burdekin Tourism Association as a local tourist attraction.  Description  The No 211 Radar Station is located south of Home Hill by way of the Bruce Highway, turn east into Charlie's Hill Road and travel , turn right onto an unsealed track, which leads up to the radar station on top of a small hill, known as Charlie's Hill. To the north-east are Rita Island and Peters Island. The physical remains of the radar station comprise two above ground semi- circular igloos, two spotter's posts, tower foundations and miscellaneous concrete foundations. The two above ground semi-circular igloos were built on concrete slab foundations and are constructed of reinforced concrete. Each igloo has a tower located at one end, which is believed to have been utilised as an exhaust, with fans drawing in fresh air from the front of the igloo and sucking it out the tower opening. The two igloos are approximately apart. The eastern (receiving) igloo is approximately long x wide. Along the base of the north-east side wall (rear) of the igloo is a small timber framed opening. There is an opening on the southern side, approximately wide, which would have been the door. The door is no longer extant. Anecdotal evidence indicates that the door was staggered ie. enter one side, walk around one partition, and then another, like an s-bend, to ensure that light was contained inside the igloo at all times. This would also have provided a constant flow of air into the igloo, which was then drawn through the igloo by an exhaust fan situated in the tower. There is a square steel box on top of the tower inscribed with the words \\"A & W... & Co LTD ENGINNEERS GLASGOW\\". It is not known what this was use for. The interior of the igloo is bare, except for a modern lounge chair and some rubbish. The remains of four square concrete footings, approximately , of the wooden tower, which carried the receiving aerial, are located approximately to the east of the igloo. To the north east of the footings is the remains of a \\"spotters post\\" - a chest height, concrete lined hole in the ground. This was operated by member of the Voluntary Air Observers' Corps (VAOC) whose role was to sight air and sea craft visually to confirm radar readings. The telescope is no longer extant. North of the receiving igloo are two small concrete foundations, their purpose is unknown. The western (transmitting) igloo is approximately long x wide. The interior of the igloo is bare. Exit holes for the aerial cables are evidenced in the concrete floor. There is a small opening in the floor on the north-west corner (rear) of the igloo approximately long x wide. It contains modern rubbish. To the west of the igloo are four square concrete foundations, approximately , which are the foundations of the wooden tower, which housed the transmitting aerials. Located in the middle of the tower foundations is a chest-height, concrete lined hole, the remains of another 'spotter's post'. Due to heavy grass cover this was not located during the 2000 survey. Other infrastructure associated with the site including a smaller igloo situated at the base of the hill, which is believed to have contained a diesel alternator to power the station, were not located during the 2000 survey.  Heritage listing  Radar Station, Charlie's Hill was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 February 2001 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The No 211 Radar Station, Charlie's Hill a complex comprising two semi-circular igloos, spotter's posts and tower foundations, is important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history by representing the role it played in World War II fortifications in north Queensland. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The No 211 Radar Station, Charlie's Hill is a good example of defence facilities constructed in north Queensland and has the potential to yield further information about this aspect of Queensland history. It is one of a series of radar stations, which were constructed along the Queensland coastline to give the earliest possible warning of approaching enemy aircraft. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The station, in its design, layout and siting, demonstrates the principal characteristics of WWII military installations involved in the defence of the Queensland coastline.

At age 17, their family settled in Galați, where Pineles was successful in business, contributing to the prosperity of the Galați port. He became one of the pillars of philanthropy in Romania's Jewish community. He helped settle refugees who fled the pogroms in the Russian Empire and later helped Jewish refugees fleeing the Soviet authorities. Pineles helped organize the immigration of Jews to the towns of Rosh Pina and Zichron Yaakov. After the advent of Theodor Herzl's Political Zionism, Pineles took up this idea with great enthusiasm. At the First Zionist Congress (Basel 1897) Pineles was elected as vice president, along with Max Nordau.

During the first decade of the twenty-first century he came to prominence beyond the confines of the German academic community with compilations, books, articles and interviews concerned with Adolf Hitler. Some of these have been translated into English. Life Henrik Eberle was born in Karl-Marx-Stadt (as Chemnitz was known between 1953 and 1990). His father was an engineer and his mother was a pharmacist. Eberle studied history at Martin Luther University of Halle- Wittenberg, receiving his doctorate for a substantial work on the Martin Luther University under Naziism (\\"Die Martin-Luther-Universität in der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus\\") which was published as a book in 2002. By this time he had embarked on a career as a freelance writer and contributing editor. Media channels to which he contributed included Die Zeit and ZDF. A biographical work on Erich Honecker appeared in 2000 and broke new ground, providing thoughtful and well-informed insights. It was considered controversial in some quarters. Eberle himself insisted that it could not be classified as a satisfactory biography because it had not been possible to access Soviet archives from the 1950s and 1960s, a period crucial in Honecker's rise to power, and one during which within the party politburo Central Committee he had apparently been promoting plans for the invasion of West Germany. Produced jointly by Eberle and his colleague Matthias Uhl, The Hitler Book has now been translated into more than 30 languages. It consists of a lengthy secret report prepared by senior NKVD officers and presented in 1949 to Joseph Stalin. The report had been inaccessible to western researchers for many years, and after 1991 apparently overlooked for another decade. The Soviet compilers had been able to access large amounts of documentary material captured when the Soviets had invaded the eastern part of Berlin (including the Chancellery and the bunker in which Hitler had killed himself), and to extensively interview the Nazi leader's valet Heinz Linge and personal adjutant Otto Günsche. Two years later, Eberle followed up The Hitler Book with \\"Briefe an Hitler\\", a 434-page compilation of hitherto unpublished letters received by Hitler, which makes extensive use of material found during searches of the Russian Defence Ministry archives along with other sources including the files of the estranged younger brother of Martin Bormann, Albert Bormann, who had handled much of their leader's routine correspondence. For 2009 Henrik Eberle joined up with the physician and writer and together they produced a book entitled War Hitler krank? (\\"Was Hitler ill?\\"). The two of them revisited various sources, paying particular attention to papers from Hitler's private physician, Theo Morell, and produced a contribution on the psychopathography of Adolf Hitler. The book lists 82 different medications that Hitler used while he was in charge of Germany, and debunks various popular myths along the way, while also concluding that towards the end of his life he began to suffer from Parkinson's disease. The authors concluded that Hitler suffered from various conventional ailments, but was not mentally ill.

It is endemic to Atlantic rainforests in São Paulo state of southeastern Brazil, and only known from four localities at an altitude of in Ubatuba (the type locality) and São Luiz do Paraitinga. It can be very common where found, and two of the known localities are protected by the Serra do Mar State Park. Unlike many other pumpkin toadlets (genus Brachycephalus), the red pumpkin toadlet is not considered threatened. Appearance Fluorescent B. pitanga under UV-light Although very small with a snout–to–vent length of in adult males and in adult females, the red pumpkin toadlet is a medium-sized species of Brachycephalus. It is overall orange, but with irregular red markings above. The extent of these marking vary greatly; from individuals where there are almost none (they are almost entirely orange throughout) to individuals where the upperparts are almost entirely red. Its specific name pitanga was chosen because it means \\"red-coloured\\" in the Tupi–Guarani languages. The bright colours are considered aposematic; although it has not been studied in the red pumpkin toadlet, the closely related and also brightly coloured B. ephippium and B. pernix have tetrodotoxin and similar toxins in their skin and organs. The red pumpkin toadlet and its close relative B. ephippium have bones that are fluorescent, which is visible through their skin when exposed to UV light. It was initially speculated that the fluorescent colour also is aposematic or that it is related to mate choice (species recognition or determining fitness of a potential partner), but later studies indicate that the former explanation is unlikely, as predation attempts on the toadlets appear to be unaffected by the presence/absence of fluorescence. Behavior, voice and hearing The red pumpkin toadlet is diurnal and live in leaf litter on the rainforest floor. During dry weather they mostly remain hidden and there is little activity, but during the wet season and high humidity they can be seen walking on top of the leaf litter. Calling by adults of both sexes and juveniles can be heard year-round, but follows the same wet/dry pattern as their general activity. Peculiarly, this species and its close relative B. ephippium are unable to hear the frequency of their own advertising calls, as their ears are underdeveloped. Instead their communication appears to rely on certain movements like the vocal sac that inflates when calling, mouth gaping and waving of their arms. It is speculated that their calling is a vestigiality from the ancestral form of the genus, whereas their reduced hearing ability (they do have some hearing ability in frequencies outside their call) is a novel change in these species. Sounds make them more vulnerable to predators, but there has likely been little direct evolutionary pressure to lose it because of their (confirmed in B. ephippium, presumed in B. pitanga) toxicity.

It was designed by Tunbridge & Tunbridge and built in 1897. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Bishop's Lodge was constructed in 1897 to the design of Tunbridge & Tunbridge, an important Townsville architectural firm, as the residence of the Anglican Bishops of North Queensland, which it remained until the early 2000s. Townsville was established in November, 1864 by partners John Melton Black and Robert Towns and was gazetted as a port of entry in 1865. It grew quickly as a supply centre and by 1873 the port was receiving international as well as coastal traffic. By 1880 Townsville was the port for several major goldfields and had opened the first stage of the Great Northern railway line westwards through Charters Towers and beyond, consolidating its importance as a port and mercantile centre. Townsville was at first part of the Diocese of New South Wales. Although it is not known when the first Church of England services were held in the township, it is known that the first services were conducted in the Court House, which was built by March 1866. A Reverend Searle visited intermittently from Bowen and requested the appointment of an incumbent to the parish of Townsville. This was accepted by the Reverend James Adams. On 24 December 1872, land for a church was purchased at the foot of Melton Hill by trustees James Gordon, Frederick Walker and William Aplin and St James Church was constructed with a vicarage beside it. The church was opened on 1 October By 1877 a school, St James English Church School, was in operation and in 1878 the Diocese of North Queensland was created, with the new Bishop, George Henry Stanton, based in Townsville. There were 2 other Anglican churches, St Peter's at West End and St John's at South Townsville. In 1883 Bishop Stanton selected land in the suburb of German Gardens (later renamed Belgian Gardens due to anti-German sentiment in World War I) for a bishop's residence. About the same time a movement began to erect St James Cathedral and the first stage of this was constructed between 1887 and 1892. Bishop's Lodge, 1903 (before Cyclone Leonta damaged it) Presumably because the building of the cathedral took precedence, the bishop's residence was not begun until the next bishop, Christopher Barlow, was installed, having arrived in 1891. The lodge was constructed in 1897 to the design of the well known Townsville architectural firm of Tunbridge and Tunbridge. Walter Howard Tunbridge was born and trained as an architect in England. In 1884 he migrated to Australia and worked for Rooney Bros in Townsville. He left to establish his own practice in 1886 and invited his younger brother, Oliver, to join him in 1887, founding the partnership of Tunbridge and Tunbridge, who were to become an important architectural and civil engineering firm in North Queensland. Of the bishops who have resided at the Lodge, John Oliver Feetham is particularly well known, partly because of his 35 years in office. Feetham was an attractive and eccentric personality, born in England in 1873 as the son of a vicar. Intelligent and well-educated himself, he took an interest in the provision of education which was to be a focus for much of his work in North Queensland. Before becoming ordained, he carried out a lay ministry for 18 months in the slums of London, an influence that remained with him for life. Feetham came to Australia in 1904 as a principal of the Brotherhood of the Good Shepherd. A strong belief in the value of the work being done by the Brotherhood to spread religion in the outback and a care for its people were distinctive marks of his episcopate. He was unanimously elected to the See in 1912. Feetham died in his bed on the verandah of the Bishop's Lodge on 14 September 1947. In the 1960s he was designated by the Synod of the Diocese of North Queensland for liturgical commemoration and styled \\"Blessed John Oliver Feetham\\". In the 1970s a memorial chapel was established on the verandah where he died. The Lodge, like many buildings in Townsville, has suffered damage from cyclones, notably in Cyclone Leonta in 1903 and Cyclone Anne in 1971, followed by extensive repair work. In the 1970s a bathroom was added on the south west verandah and the Feetham chapel was created on the north east verandah by glassing in this area. This has preserved a view across Cleveland Bay seen beyond the altar of the chapel. During the 1970s, a considerable portion of the Lodge's land was subdivided. The house is now privately owned, being bought from the Anglican church in the early 2000s.  Description  The Bishop's Lodge is a large timber building situated on an exposed northerly ridge of Castle Hill. The ground falls away from the house on three sides and the Lodge is visible from the surrounding suburb and from the sea. In turn the house has splendid views of Cleveland Bay towards Magnetic Island from its verandah. The architect has used this position to advantage, creating a striking house which is a flamboyant blend of Victorian Gothic and vernacular architecture; perhaps appropriate for an English church transplanted to tropical Australia. It also responds well to the climate with wide verandahs right around the house to obtain the best of both breeze and view. A terrace at the front of the house has a lawn with trees and flowering shrubs. Bishop's Lodge is symmetrical and roughly U-shaped in plan, enclosing a courtyard at the rear. It is set on low stumps and has steeply pitched gabled roofs clad in corrugated iron and topped with large decorative ventilators. In form it consists of two large wings parallel to each other and linked by a transverse section at the front. A wide passage through the centre of the building serves as a breezeway linking the front and rear verandahs, and effectively divides the house into two parts, with bedrooms on one side and living areas on the other. The front elevation is dominated by the ends of the high twin gables. These extend across the verandah and are supported by decorative bracketed posts, creating two bays between which the central section runs. This has a lower roofline and a single ventilator in the centre of the ridge. At the centre of this section is a small gable forming an entrance porch. All three gables are decorated with timber bands placed to resemble half timbering. The central gable is surmounted by a cross. The verandahs at the sides and centre front are also supported decorated timber posts and those at the front corners of the building have clusters of bracketed posts. The verandah balustrades are composed of wooden dowels. A modern metal security gate has been installed in the front porch. The courtyard area has been developed as a covered greenhouse linked to the wide verandahs around the courtyard. Attached to the house by a covered way is a separate timber building, also with exterior studding. The building is raised on concrete stumps and has a gabled roof clad in corrugated iron. A modern concrete garage has been constructed to the rear of the house.  Heritage listing  Bishop's Lodge was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Bishop's Lodge, as the first and subsequent, purpose-built, residence for the Anglican Bishop of North Queensland, is important in demonstrating the pattern of establishment and growth of the Anglican Church in North Queensland in the late 19th century. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Lodge has aesthetic value as a good example of a high quality, well detailed and fashionable residence of its era and was designed by one of North Queensland 's leading architectural firms. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Bishop's Lodge is closely associated with the life and work of the Blessed John Oliver Feetham, Anglican Bishop of North Queensland 1913-47. It is also associated with the important North Queensland architectural firm of Tunbridge and Tunbridge.

Using first- hand testimonies of people living in the area at the time, the film documents the changes in the lives of these people in relation to the urban regeneration promised by the large-scale sporting event. The film premiered at the 2012 Venice Film Festival. Plot In the years leading up to the 2012 Olympics, East London, the eventual site of the Olympic park, is transformed into a construction site. Indeed, one of the factors that was instrumental in leading the Olympic committee to choose London as the location for the 2012 games was the promise to reinvigorate this area, which was considered to be one of the poorest in Great Britain.\\"Why was London chosen to hold the 2012 Olympiad\\", (study, retrieved 15.01.2016), The film shows the mood of the area at the time to be one of hope and expectation, by interviewing inhabitants and workers in order to explore the urban and social changes brought about by the imminent arrival of the great sporting event. The theme of the clash between large- scale events and the daily lives of ordinary people is explored through the use of symbolism: three ‘temples’ are examined – hence the title of the film, ‘The Golden Temple.’ First we see the stadium, a veritable temple of games and entertainment: we hear in one witness’s account, however, that it was built over radioactive waste. The second symbolic temple – this time, a shrine to consumerism – is Westfield Stratford City, one of the biggest shopping centres in Europe. It was constructed in such a way that all Olympic spectators had to pass through it to reach the stadium. The third symbolic temple is not, unlike the others, a real construction, but is instead represented by numerous religious communities in the area seeking new followers, and more specifically by the plans to build a new mosque in the area at around the same time, which were eventually scrapped. Among these metaphorical temples, we meet various people who talk of their hopes and eventual delusions regarding the regeneration of the area. Among them are Mike, a photo journalist who lives on a house boat on the canal; John, a businessman; Sue, one of the Olympic Games tourist guides; and the apostle Ben, so-called ‘General of God,’ a Ghanaian evangelist who preaches in a military uniform. The English author Iain Sinclair also appears in the film. He criticises the militarisation of the city of London under the pretext of the Olympic Games, an argument which he explores further in his book ‘Ghost Milk.’ Production The film was produced by Caucaso Factory,\\"Caucaso Factory website\\", Retrieved 15.01.2016 in collaboration with Aplysia, Dupleix and Nordeste. The media consultancy, distribution and presentation of the film was undertaken by ESNA European Higher Education News, based in Berlin.

He was arrested in December 16, 2015 by the Vietnamese authorities and charged under Article 88 for \\"conducting propaganda against the state\\". The arrest was condemned by international human rights organisations and elected representatives across the world. On April 5, 2017 while still in the prison in Vietnam, he received from German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier the Human Rights award 2017 of German Association of Judges.Lễ trao giải nhân quyền cho LS. Nguyễn Văn Đài tại Đức, www.rfa.org, 2017-04-06 Activism In 2006, Dai founded the Committee for Human Rights in Vietnam, dedicating his life to civil empowerment through legal means with programs aimed at expanding legal networkings, building capacity for future human rights defenders and increasing legal education by disseminating and authoring publications on civil and legal rights. Through his work with the Committee for Human Rights, Dai has travelled across Vietnam to teach law students and train young human rights defenders on human rights reporting mechanisms and how to deal with police interrogation. In May 2013, Dai also founded the \\"Brotherhood for Democracy\\", a group of mostly former jailed dissidents to co-ordinate mobilising efforts throughout Vietnam. In December 2015, the Brotherhood for Democracy organised a series of human rights forums in Hanoi and Saigon to mark International Human Rights Day. Police prevented Dai from leaving his house to attend and speak at the forum in Hanoi. Dai was beaten with wooden clubs, had his possessions taken and left stranded on a beach following training and facilitating a human rights forum in Nghe An Province the week before his arrest. Dai was previously tried in May 2008 and sentenced to five years in prison (later reduced to four years) for \\"conducting propaganda against the state\\" (Article 88) and was forced to close his offices. He was released to four years of house arrest on March 9, 2011 and barred from practicing law. Dai concluded his house arrest in March 2015 but experienced regular police harassment, physical attacks and surveillance. Dai was the recipient of Human Rights Watch's Hellman-Hammett Award and Vietnam Human Rights Network's Human Rights Award in 2007. Arrest Nguyen Van Dai was taken into custody in the morning of December 16, 2015. According to his wife, he was on his way with Truong Van Dung, a Hanoi-based activist, to meet with European Union representatives involved in the bilateral human rights dialogue the previous day. Dai was taken back to his house by plainclothes police officers and was confronted by more than two dozen police officers in plainclothes and uniform. A search warrant was produced and signed by Dai and his wife. They also stated the charges which Dai did not agree to. Police confiscated several of his possessions including two laptops, a desktop computer and several USB sticks. Since his arrest, Dai has been held in incommunicado. His wife, Vu Minh Khanh, has not been allowed to visit him but has recently been able to send supplies to him. In December attorney Ha Huy Son submitted the paperwork to be Dai's defense lawyer but was declined by the Ministry of Public Security. Currently, Dai has not been given legal representation. On the same day, Le Thu Ha, also a member of the Brotherhood for Democracy was also arrested under article 88. She is currently being held incommunicado. International Response By letter of 18 December 2015, NGO's Lawyers for Lawyers (L4L) and Lawyers Rights Watch Canada called on the Vietnamese authorities to immediately release Nguyen Van Dai and conduct an independent investigation into the attack on him. Furthermore, L4L requested the Delegation of the European Union to Vietnam and the Ambassadors of the EU Member States in Vietnam to visit Nguyen Van Dai in prison and to report on his condition. In a joint statement released on 6 January 2016, 26 organisations from around the world called on the Vietnamese Government to release Nguyen Van Dai. On 13 January 2016, L4L furthermore requested the delegation to request the Vietnamese authorities that Nguyen Van Dai and his colleague are granted access to legal counsel and that their family members are allowed to visit them. On 26 April 2016, 19 international organizations called on the President of the U.S. to use talks about the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement to urge Viet Nam to release political prisoners, repeal laws that criminalize the exercise of internationally protected rights and cease harassment of human rights defenders, including lawyers, in accordance with its international human rights obligations. Nguyen Van Dai was specifically mentioned in this letter. On 14 October 2016, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed concern about Van Dai's detention and called for his release and the release of all individuals detained in connection with Article 88 and similar provisions. In November 2016, a petition was filed with the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD) urging it to intervene in the case of Nguyen Van Dai. As a result, the UNWGAD published an opinion in June 2017 ruling in favour of the petition and calling for the immediate and unconditional release of Nguyen Van Dai.

Early years Chuck Pyle was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and raised in Newton, Iowa where he sang in the school choir. He was the adopted son of Lyle, a railroad conductor, and Julie, a school teacher. Pyle dropped out of college in his home state of Iowa and moved to Boulder, Colorado in 1965, hoping to build a career in music. Career In the winter of 1970, having made minor progress as a musician, he was invited to a cabin in Gold Hill that was owned by songwriter Steve Fromholtz. There, he met the musicians John Cable and Richard Dean. Soon, Cable and Pyle joined forces in the five-piece band Colours, with Pyle as a bass player. Pyle's vocal abilities and songwriting talents made him well known in country music songwriting circles. Pyle wrote \\"Cadillac Cowboy\\" for Chris LeDoux (it appeared on LeDoux’s 1988 album Chris LeDoux and the Saddle Boogie Band).

Built in 1836, it is a distinctive local example of transitional Federal-Greek Revival architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. Description and history The Union Meeting House stands in the center of the rural village of Whiting, on the north side of the three-way junction of US 1 and Maine State Route 189. It is a single story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboard siding, and a foundation of ornamental concrete blocks. The roof is topped by an open belfry with a pyramidal roof that has a spire that is a sculpted metal fish. The main facade is three bays wide, with a center entrance flanked by sash windows, and a fully pedimented gable above, in which there is an arched panel at the center. The entrance is framed by pilasters and topped by an entablature and cornice. The interior of the building has a vestibule area, from which narrow stairs wind to the gallery on one side, and a center double door leads into the sanctuary. The sanctuary has a coved ceiling finished in pressed tin, which extends down the walls to wainscoting. The floors are wide pine, and there are three banks of bench pews. The church was built in 1836 by a union committee of two different Christian congregations, and has a basic Federal-period form, with a few added Greek Revival details, such as the fully pedimented gable. Churches of this period are rare in eastern Maine, and this one is a particularly well preserved instance. It underwent an interior remodeling in 1886, and again in 1904, when it is likely that the belfry and pressed tin finishes were added. A heating system was added in the 1960s, altering the configuration of the vestibule, but these changes have been reversed. Due to declining attendance of the congregations, the union committee deeded the building to the town in 2012.

The area was leased to the Soviet Union according to the 1944 signed Moscow Armistice between Finland, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom. The area was returned to Finland in 1956, and currently hosts a Finnish naval base Upinniemi. Porkkala Naval Base location on a map  History  At the end of the Second World War the Soviet Union secured the rights of lease to a naval base at Porkkala, in accordance with the Moscow armistice agreement that ended the Continuation War, between Finland and the Soviets on September 19, 1944. Porkkala thus replaced the peninsula of Hanko, which had been leased to the Soviets as a naval base in 1940–41. A large area centered on the peninsula, including land from the municipalities of Kirkkonummi, Siuntio and Ingå and almost the entire area of Degerby, was leased to the USSR from 29 September 1944, ten days after the armistice. It was immediately placed under a military commander, Neon Vasilyevich Antonov (1907–1948), who remained in office till June 1945, when he was transferred to command the Amur River flotilla, in preparation for the war against Japan. On 1 November 1944, the headquarters and other assets of the 55th Rifle Division were converted into the 1st Mozyr Red Banner Naval Infantry Division of the Baltic Fleet at Oranienbaum. Its subordinate units were renumbered. The 107th Rifle Regiment became the 1st Regiment, the 111th Rifle Regiment became the 2nd Regiment, and the 228th became the 3rd Regiment. The 185th Tank Regiment became the 1st Tank Regiment and the 84th Artillery became the 1st Artillery. The division formed the garrison of the Porkkala Naval Base. In 1948, the division became the 1st Machine Gun Artillery Division of the Baltic Fleet. The 1st Regiment became the 51st Machine Gun Artillery Regiment, the 2nd Regiment the 54th, and the 3rd Regiment the 57th. The 1st Tank Regiment was renumbered as the 194th and the 1st Artillery was renumbered as the 414th. The 53rd and 60th Machine Gun Artillery Regiments were added to the division after being formed from ground units. The division included 16,000 soldiers, occupying 280 machine gun and 208 artillery bunkers. In 1955, negotiations for a Soviet withdrawal began, and the division began disbanding in August 1955. The process was completed in January 1956, when what remained of the division was disbanded at the Bobochinsky Camp in the Leningrad Military District. According to the armistice of 1944, the area was leased to the Soviet Union for 50 years. On February 10, 1947, the Paris peace treaty reaffirmed the Soviet Union's right to occupy this area until 1994. No Soviet civilian administration was set up, the USSR simply administered it through the military commander of Porkkala, a post held until 26 January 1956 by Sergey Ivanovich Kabanov (1901–1973), the former Commander of Hanko naval base. While under Soviet control, Finnish passenger trains running between Helsinki and Turku were allowed to use the line through the area. However all train windows had to be closed with shutters, and photography was prohibited. Although the Soviet lease for Porkkala had been conceded for 50 years, an agreement was reached to return it earlier. The agreement was signed on September 19, 1955, exactly 11 years after the armistice, and control of the area was handed back to Finland on January 26, 1956. This may be attributed to the Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948, the conditions of which made the naval base unnecessary. At present, the Porkkala area houses one of the main bases of the Finnish Navy, located in Upinniemi, near Porkkala proper.

The episode aired on February 15, 2016 on AMC in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service Netflix in several countries. Plot=Opening= In a flash forward that follows the events of Breaking Bad, \\"Gene\\" manages a Cinnabon store in Omaha, Nebraska. When closing up for the night, he accidentally locks himself in the mall's dumpster room. He contemplates using an emergency exit, but doesn't because it would notify the police, who might recognize him. He is finally let out by a janitor nearly three hours later, but carved \\"SG WAS HERE\\" into the wall with a screw while he waited. =Main story= Jimmy declines Davis & Main's employment offer in Santa Fe, closes down his law practice, and goes on vacation under an assumed name at a luxury hotel. Kim confronts Jimmy about his decision, but he's content since his reason for becoming a lawyer was to impress Chuck, who is not supportive. Jimmy convinces Kim to help him con an obnoxious businessman, Ken, into paying their expensive tequila bar tab by posing as a pair of inexperienced investors. Thrilled by the experience, Kim keeps the elaborate stopper from the tequila bottle as a souvenir, and spends the night with Jimmy, but it becomes clear that she does not want to participate in this behavior all the time. Jimmy takes the job with Davis & Main, and finds that benefits include an expensive company car as well as the cocobolo desk he always wanted. Jimmy notices a wall switch in his new office which has a note posted on it indicating that the switch should never be turned off. He turns it off, and waits a moment to see what happens. When nothing does, he turns it back on. Mike refuses another job with Daniel Wormald (\\"Pryce\\"), who has spent some of his drug money on a flashy and expensive new Hummer that Mike believes will draw too much attention. Pryce believes he no longer needs Mike as a bodyguard and fires him, ignoring Mike's warnings that it is not wise to deal with Nacho alone. Nacho takes advantage of Mike's absence and obtains Pryce's address and real name from the papers in the Hummer's glove compartment. Pryce's house is ransacked and he calls the police, upset that his valuable baseball card collection has been stolen. The responding officers are suspicious about the nature of the burglary, as certain valuable items such as Pryce's computer and TV were left untouched. They are also suspicious of Pryce's Hummer. When they search inside his house, the officers find a hidden compartment in the wall behind Pryce's couch, apparently located and emptied by the burglar. Production This episode was written and directed by executive producer Thomas Schnauz, who also wrote the episodes \\"Nacho\\" and \\"Pimento\\" of the previous season. Just like \\"Switch\\", \\"Pimento\\" was also directed by Schnauz. Despite being credited, Michael McKean as Chuck McGill does not appear. Kyle Bornheimer who plays Ken, reprises his guest role from the first-season Breaking Bad episode \\"Cancer Man\\". Reception=Ratings= Upon airing, the episode received 2.57 million American viewers, and an 18-49 rating of 1.1. Including Live+3 viewership, the premiere was watched by 4.708 million viewers and attained an 18-49 rating of 2.1. =Critical reception= The episode received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the episode has a 95% rating with an average score of 8.07 out of 10 based on 19 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads, Switch' succeeds in taking its sweet time while laying nuanced groundwork for the anticipated transition from Jimmy into Saul.\\" Terri Schwartz of IGN gave the episode an 8.5 rating, concluding, Switch' marks a solid return for Better Call Saul as we begin to see the 'how' of Jimmy's transition into Saul Goodman be explored.\\" The Telegraph note how \\"it was obviously a hoot to resume acquaintances with Jimmy, Kim and Mike\\".

Scheuerman was born in Moline, Illinois and grew up in Rock Island, one of the Quad Cities. He was born to Milton Scheuerman and Lois Anderson. He had one younger brother Thomas. After a strong high school basketball career at Rock Island High School, Scheuerman chose to play college basketball for coach Bucky O'Connor at Iowa. There, he was started for some of the most successful teams in program history, winning two Big Ten Conference titles and advancing to the national Final Four in 1955 and 1956. The starting unit for these teams were known as the \\"Fabulous Five\\" as they started as a unit from their sophomore to their senior seasons. Coaching career Following the close of his college career, Scheuerman was hired as an assistant coach by his mentor Bucky O'Connor, then was hired as head coach in 1958 when O'Connor was killed at the age of 44 in an automobile accident. At 24, Schuerman was the youngest head basketball coach in Big Ten history and one of the youngest in college basketball overall. In six years as the Hawkeyes' head coach, Scheuerman's teams compiled a record of 72–69. Hall of Famer Don Nelson was recruited to Iowa by Scheuerman, as was Hall of Famer Connie Hawkins. Nelson, also from Rock Island High School, left Iowa as the school's all-time leading scorer, before winning five NBA championships with the Boston Celtics and then retiring as the all-time wins leader among NBA coaches. Scheuerman had Bob King on his Iowa staff from 1960-1962. Scheuerman resigned at Iowa coach in 1964 to enter private business. \\"What I remember most about it is playing for Sharm and our relationship over 50 years and how close we were and how much I loved that man,” Nelson said in 2012 of Scheuerman. “A role model certainly, but I could never duplicate that man’s life because he was so special. I certainly tried. I’m certainly a better person just by knowing him and talking to him. But we spent a lot of time together over the last 50 years.” Scheuerman settled in Denver, Colorado after coaching. He died on August 30, 2010 after a long battle with cancer.

It has 12 floors that contain 55 apartments. It takes up a whole city block on 4th Street and stretches between Broadway and Lafayette with entrances on both streets. Built in 1912 as a factory for producing silk garments, it was converted into a condominium building in 1982. Since then, it was the residence of global stars such as Keith Richards, Cher and Britney Spears. Its penthouse is the most famous four-storey quadruplex in New York. History The Silk Building was designed by Clinton & Russel Architects in the Italian Renaissance style. Construction began in 1908 and was completed in 1912. The building was initially constructed to be a factory space for workers producing silk garments. The only remaining traces of the factory are the two friezes in the lobby. The first, called Silk Textile Workers of New York, shows a silk manufacture with female workers performing various tasks. The second frieze, called Silk Production in China, shows how silk itself was traditionally produced in China. At the time, many buildings in the neighborhood, such as the American Thread Building or the Spinning Wheel Building, contained clothing manufacturers. Over the decades, they have all been repurposed into office buildings or, as in the case of the Silk Building, into luxury residential buildings. In 1982, the Silk Building was bought by David Walentas of Two Trees Management Company. He developed it into a condominium-style building with retail spaces, designed by Beyer Blinder Belle. The condominiums range from studios to four bedrooms with high-beamed ceilings. Many of the layouts are duplexes or triplexes. Tenants An important event for the whole neighborhood was the leasing of the Silk Building's entire retail spaces to Tower Records in 1983. Their music store became a major destination store in New York, attracting rock musicians and other celebrities. The first global stars living in the building were Keith Richards and Cher. Richards owned two floors, one a complete recording studio. He lived a secluded life and rarely left the building till late at night to avoid fans. The Silk Building was the New York home of both the writer Bret Easton Ellis and of the main character of his novel Imperial Bedrooms. Rap mogul Russell Simmons resided at PH 1108 until 1996. Britney Spears lived in the penthouse until 2006. In 2010, Alan Colmes sold his triplex apartment there. In 2010, New York University purchased a 12,851-square-foot condominium spanning the entire third floor. The space is used for back-office purposes by the university, including the NYU Shanghai office in New York, as well as housing an affiliate of the NYU Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development.

Lauded for his role as a catalyst in the general development of the Russian theatre in the mid-19th-century, Burdin the actor was unpopular with theatre critics, notably Apollon Grigoriev who coined the term 'burdinism' to denote what he saw as the contemporary Russian stage actors' worst flaws: pompousness and penchant for banality.

In 1876 his 2-volume Collection of Plays Translated from French came out in Saint Petersburg.

Red mangrove seeds germinate while still on the parent tree. In plants, vivipary occurs when seeds or embryos begin to develop before they detach from the parent. Plants such as some Iridaceae and Agavoideae grow cormlets in the axils of their inflorescences. These fall and in favourable circumstances they have effectively a whole season's start over fallen seeds. Similarly, some Crassulaceae, such as Bryophyllum, develop and drop plantlets from notches in their leaves, ready to grow. Such production of embryos from somatic tissues is asexual vegetative reproduction that amounts to cloning. Description In some species of mangroves, for instance, the seed germinates and grows from its own resources while still attached to its parent. Seedlings of some species are dispersed by currents if they drop into the water, but others develop a heavy, straight taproot that commonly penetrates mud when the seedling drops, thereby effectively planting the seedling. This contrasts with the examples of vegetative reproduction mentioned above, in that the mangrove plantlets are true seedlings produced by sexual reproduction. In some trees, like jackfruit, some citrus, and avocado, the seeds can be found already germinated while the fruit goes overripe; strictly speaking this condition cannot be described as vivipary, but the moist and humid conditions provided by the fruit mimic a wet soil that encourages germination. However, the seeds also can germinate under moist soil. Reproduction Vivipary includes reproduction via embryos, such as shoots or bulbils, as opposed to germinating externally from a dropped, dormant seed, as is usual in plants;Kenneth, John H.

Gervase was a pupil or student of Hilary of Chichester, the bishop of Chichester.Barlow Thomas Becket pp. 77–79 Around 1158 Gervase appears as a clerk King Henry II of England, while also simultaneously serving Henry's chancellor, Thomas Becket.Barlow Thomas Becket p. 42 The king and Becket arranged for Gervase's appointment to two churches – Basing and Shelbourne in Berkshire – by Robert de Torigni, the abbot of Mont St Michel. Gervase followed Becket to Canterbury when Becket became archbishop of Canterbury. Herbert of Bosham names Gervase as one of the 17 eruditi, or \\"scholars\\" that Becket had at Canterbury. Herbert gave this list as a separate grouping from the secular law experts in Becket's household, explaining that the eruditi were theologians and experts in \\"courts spiritual\\". He is usually given the title of \\"master\\", but the details of why he was called that are unknown. Gervase did not follow Becket when the archbishop went into exile in 1164 over the Becket controversy, but instead returned to Chichester and the service of Hilary. He was recorded as a canon of the Chichester cathedral chapter in a document dated between 1174 and 1180, with his last occurrence in a document being between 1187 and 1192.

The Editio super Malachiam is a commentary on the biblical prophecies contained in the Book of Malachi attributed to Malachi. His homilies are sermons that he delivered on the second and third anniversaries of the martyrdom of Becket. These sermons were delivered at Chichester and compared Becket to two biblical figures – Phineas and Abel. John Leland saw a commentary on the biblical Book of Psalms at Walsingham Priory and attributed it to a Gervase, but it is not clear which of several possible Gervases was meant. Richard Sharpe considers it doubtful that the commentary Leland saw was authored by Gervase of Chichester.Sharpe Handlist of Latin Writers pp. 139–140 The two further works follow the homilies in the one extant manuscript – one on Ezekiel and one on the birth of John the Baptist, may have been written by Gervase, but this is not certain.

Azizi previously served as the Chief of Staff of the Governor of Nangarhar and Kandahar.  Early life  Masood Ahmad Azizi was born on 4 June 1983 in Kandahar Province, into a family of relative affluence, son to a prominent Political and tribal leader Abdul Aziz Khan. Major Gen. Azizi became involved in politics as the Special Assistant to the Governor of Kandahar and rapidly began impressing his superiors, mentors and the citizens alike with his thorough knowledge for political attributes already obtained and further attentive to absorb and reflect effectively and efficiently resulting in positive, innovative plans and ideas which turned into programs benefiting the Province and on wards the Republic as a whole.  Political career  Masood Ahmad Azizi became Deputy Minister of Policy and Strategy in Ministry of Interior and Brigadier General in December 2013. President Karzai issued Azizi a second star to Major General Azizi for his accomplishments in the honor of his Nation. Over the last 10 years, Major Gen. Azizi has acquired a vast amount of experience and has been exposed to every significant aspect within the political arena vital to evolving ones career towards the most important goal shared by all those working within the Public sector, servicing the Republic and its peoples to the best of their capabilities for a stronger, healthier and unified Afghanistan. Major Gen. Azizi has had the honor and privilege to chair numerous positions within Afghanistan ranging from the Special Assistant to a Governor to being the Chief of Staff of Nangarhar. These roles, and others in between, offered him the opportunity to advise and learn from Senior Leadership, but also identify and strengthen his core competencies for the position he currently holds today as the Deputy Minister of Interior for Policy and Strategy. During his tenure in all of his positions, and due to his distinguishable performance and solid work ethic, he has surely and steadily has been recognized and promoted for his efforts to perform his duties and responsibilities effectively and efficiently on a continual basis. As Chief of Staff of Nangarhar, Major Gen. Azizi immediately identified three key issues. The first was the high poppy cultivation rate in Nangarhar, the second was the need to implement infrastructure concerning the rule of law, and the third was to reduce the gap between the local community and government. He accomplished this by not only creating 5 years strategic plan, but remaining actively involved in overseeing the regulations and enforcement of achievements to ensure that the end result was realised to the fullest of expectations and satisfaction and would be continued accordingly. All of the constructive effects reached Tribal Elders, Islamic Scholars, Youth and Women for the improvement in way of life for Afghans. Two significant programs that Major Gen. Azizi was instrumental in, and both were substantial national and international talking points, were: Disarmament of illegal groups while simultaneously informing, educating and interacting with the local populace to keep the public informed every step of the way. These efforts were not popular with many groups who did not have Afghanistan nor its peoples in their best interests and it took stern dedication, commitment and personal risk to his life to succeed. For his “commitment, dedication and personal risk for Afghanistan” he was awarded the Hero Medal “Ghazi Meer Masjidi Khan Medal”, one of the most prestigious medals and forms of gratitude issued by the government to an employee in the Public sector recognizing excellence, devotion and devout patriotism by one man for all those he has sworn to serve and protect.  Education  Major Gen. Azizi was educated at an independent school during his migration in Pakistan. He holds a Bachelor in Law and a Master in International Relations from a prominent British institute, Warwick University. He has also attended many courses and workshops relevant to his past and prior work in Afghanistan and in many developed countries, a prime example being recently attended courses on “Leadership and Local Governance, Media and Management, Strategic Studies and Post-Conflict studies”. MG. Azizi wrote his Master's thesis on “Tribalism in Afghanistan” and has, at the request of world-renowned colleagues, associates, leaders, specialists, admirers and other dignified individuals or groups, performed hours of interviews, lectures, in-person sessions and research in reference concerning the effects of international policies related to Afghanistan. Major Gen. Azizi 2013 MG. Azizi is famous to be obsessive about his work and how it impacts those around him, dedicated to the utmost levels, has demonstrated a resilient history in approach to his job and continues to display the desire and devotion to contribute all he has and then some to constantly raise the bar as he believes in only obtaining the best for those he loves and serves. He is fluent in all local and regional languages as he enjoys speaking with all of his country's people and many international languages to avoid any language barriers with those considered friends and allies of Afghanistan: Pashto, Dari, Urdu and English.  Community Involvement  Major Gen. Azizi studied abroad but has never lost sight of the tribal and cultural dynamics of Afghanistan. After ten years in politics, and as the existing Chairman of Afghanistan Forward, the knowledge and experience will not stop there as he continues to learn, grow and share. As Afghanistan is currently in a transitional period, and will be for decades to come, MG. Azizi strongly believes that whilst continuing his already progressive work in policy and strategy inside of Afghanistan, additionally improving his regional and international policies will contribute to and strengthen the relationship of Afghanistan with its close to distant neighbors for a stronger Republic as a whole. A Republic who is on the verge of, and must be prepared to return to its former position of glory as one of the world's most used and valuable trade routes and strategic hubs rating on a global capacity. Policy and strategy plays one of the most important parts in ensuring that Afghanistan and its peoples remain true to its cultural and customs beliefs and take effective preventive measures to eliminate the risks of failing while evolving into the position of strength and power to benefit Afghanistan, its neighbors and friends around the world. Currently, MG. Azizi is actively involved in civic, political and international associations that focus on the immediate needs and priorities of Afghanistan.

First developed between about 1880 and 1910, the neighborhood has high-quality late 19th- century homes, interspersed with later mid-20th century development. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. Description and history Westminster Terrace is geographically sited on a terrace overlooking the mouth of the Saxtons River, where it empties into the Connecticut River just below Bellows Falls, Vermont. The terrace is separated from the surrounding roads and properties (principally Westmminster Road, a major north-south artery) by steep terrain. The southernmost properties located on the terrace are across the town line in Westminster. The northern end of the district abuts the Bellows Falls Neighborhood Historic District. The terrace is occupied by 24 primary residential structures and a number of outbuildings. Most of these are large 2-1/2 story wood frame buildings in architectural styles popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, while there are also a number of mid-20th-century single-story ranch houses, which exemplify the shift in character of the area over time. The terrace's initial use, by settlers in the early 18th century, was as farmland. In 1827 a pair of handsome Greek Revival mansions were built near its northern end, where the Rockingham Hospital stands today. Beginning in 1880, the terrace's principal owner, a farmer named Edward Bancroft, began selling off the land for development. Early deed restrictions mandated minimum house values, sizes, and had ownership and occupancy restrictions excluding African Americans and the Irish. Development of the area as an upper-class enclave also prompted calls for a redrawing of municipal boundaries, in order to unite the area. In the first wave of building, a number of handsome Queen Anne style houses were erected, followed in the early 20th century by similarly sized buildings with Colonial Revival features. In the 1950s a number of the larger parcels were subdivided to permit the construction of the more modest ranch houses that stand in the neighborhood.

The exterior, finished in superior blue, boasts a low-slung flowing pillarless coupe design with a sloping fastback roofline. The front fascia is said to have been inspired by the 1954 Buick Wildcat II concept car. On the inside, the seats are upholstered in mist gray leather, complete with carbon fiber aluminium accents to give the driver's compartment a more sporty appearance. The dashboard features a wide touchscreen previewing a \\"future version\\" of Buick's IntelliLink infotainment system. The doors and interior components were 3D-printed. The Avista concept car is related to the Cadillac ATS-V Coupe and sixth generation Chevrolet Camaro by sharing the same rear- wheel-drive Alpha platform. Its chassis utilizes Magnetic Ride Control to provide more precise handling. Power comes from a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V6 engine producing 400 hp, backed by an 8-speed automatic transmission. Its engine comes equipped with cylinder deactivation to improve fuel efficiency. The concept car was met with critical acclaim, winning the 2016 EyesOn Design award (also won by the Buick Avenir in the previous year), as well as being named \\"Best Future Concept\\" by The Detroit News. The fastback coupe concept was applauded for its perfectly proportioned rear-drive stance. The Avista nameplate, meaning sight in Italian, was previously filed for trademark registration by General Motors on September 22, 2015. Production consideration Although the car was merely intended as a design study, GM considered putting the Avista or a similar car into production as a halo vehicle for Buick, according to a Buick representative. A production version was expected to retain the platform and engine from the concept. Its prospects were boosted by the great fanfare generated by its introduction at the Detroit Auto Show. However, Buick ultimately decided not make the Avista. Despite the interest, Buick restated it was a design study and would not be produced. They also decided not to make a sedan version of the Avista to replace the Buick Regal.

The Austrian Emperor called on the Serbs, who were ready to revolt, on 15 June 1737, and stressed that they would fight in an alliance with Russia against a common enemy. The Serbs organized themselves under Serbian Patriarch Arsenije IV. The uprising had a wide geographical extent, from Belgrade to eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and the Šar Mountain. The Albanian Klimenti tribe also joined the uprising. The failed war prompted Serbs, mostly from Herzegovina, Sandžak, Metohija and Montenegro, to flee under the leadership of Arsenije IV from the Ottoman territories into the Habsburg Monarchy (as was done in 1689–92). Talks Serbian Patriarch Arsenije IV discussed with the Austrian government through the bishop of Temeschwar, Nikola Dimitrijević. Arsenije promised that the people would revolt and help the Austrian army with food. The tribes in Brda, under the leadership of Radonja Petrović, would ready 500 armed men of Kuči, vojvoda Vuksan Vojvodić of Vasojevići 200, vojvoda Toško of Piperi 200, etc. The Serbian Patriarch and Radonja called on Metropolitan Sava Petrović to join the war against the Ottomans, but he was under the influence of the Republic of Venice, and stayed inactive during the war.

When talks were underway, an uprising broke out in Montenegro. Radonja's rebels and Serbian troops, and an auxiliary force of Staniša Marković-Mlatišuma, attacked the local Muslims. According to the Serbian plan, they were to take over Novi Pazar, Rožaje, Bijelo Polje and Peć. A Serbian detachment attacked Bihor, and penetrated to Godijevo, where they set up a headquarters in the house of Mustafa Sijarić. Radonja heard that the Ottomans would in their future actions first attack Župljani, which had already crossed to the Venetian side. At the same time, Radonja informed Cattaro intendant Jerolim Buća that Derviš-paša Čengić was ordered to turn with his army from the Sanjak of Herzegovina towards Knin, which they were to attack; and that vezir-Mustafa-paša with the armies of other sanjaks and 4,000 Tatars, as was planned, turn in the direction of Zadar. That information was likely exaggerated. Second Great Migration The failed war prompted Serbs, mostly from Herzegovina, Sandžak, Metohija and Montenegro, to flee under the leadership of Arsenije IV from the Ottoman territories into the Habsburg Monarchy (as was done in 1689–92). The Austrian government had encouraged the Serbs to settle Habsburg territories.

The animation, or \\"movie\\", consists of a series of distinct views of the data as seen from different directions, displayed on a computer screen, that appear to change continuously and that get closer and closer to all possible views. This allows a human- or computer-based evaluation of these views, with the goal of detecting patterns that will convey useful information about the data. This technique is like what many museum visitors do when they encounter a complicated abstract sculpture: They walk around it to view it from all directions, in order to understand it better. The human visual system perceives visual information as a pattern on the retina, which is 2-dimensional. Thus walking around the sculpture to understand it better creates a temporal sequence of 2-dimensional images in the brain. The multivariate data that is the original input for any grand tour visualization is a (finite) set of points in some high-dimensional Euclidean space. This kind of set arises naturally when data is collected. Suppose that for some population of 1000 people, each person is asked to provide their age, height, weight, and number of nose hairs. Thus to each member of the population there is associated an ordered quadruple of numbers. Since n-dimensional Euclidean space is defined as all ordered n-tuples of numbers, this means that the data on 1000 people maybe be thought of as 1000 points in 4-dimensional Euclidean space. The grand tour converts the spatial complexity of the multivariate data set into temporal complexity by using the relatively simple 2-dimensional views of the projected data as the individual frames of the movie. (These are sometimes called \\"data views\\".) The projections will ordinarily be chosen so as not to change too fast, which means that the movie of the data will appear continuous to a human observer. A grand tour \\"method\\" is an algorithm for assigning a sequence of projections onto (usually) 2-dimensional planes to any given dimension of Euclidean space. This allows any particular multivariate data set to be projected onto that sequence of 2-dimensional planes and thereby displayed on a computer screen one after the other, so that the effect is to create a movie of the data. (Note that, once the data has been projected onto a given 2-plane, then in order to display it on a computer screen, it is necessary to choose the directions in that 2-plane that will correspond to the horizontal and vertical directions on the computer screen. This is typically a minor detail. But the choice of horizontal and vertical directions should ideally be done so as to minimize any unnecessary apparent \\"spinning\\" of the 2-dimensional data view.) Technical description Each \\"view\\" (i.e., frame) of the animation is an orthogonal projection of the data set onto a 2-dimensional subspace of the Euclidean space Rp where the data resides. The subspaces are selected by taking small steps along a continuous curve, parametrized by time, in the space of all 2-dimensional subspaces of Rp, known as the Grassmannian G(2,p). To display these views on a computer screen, it is necessary to pick one particular rotated position of each view (in the plane of the computer screen) for display. This causes the positions of the data points on the computer screen to appear to vary continuously. Asimov showed that these subspaces can be selected so as to make the set of them (up to time t) increasingly close to all points in G(2,p), so that if the grand tour movie were allowed to run indefinitely, the set of displayed subspaces would correspond to a dense subset of G(2,p).Asimov, Daniel.

In 1963, she founded the Institut for Nordisk Rytmik (Institute for Nordic Rhythm) which she ran until 1989. Biography Bülow was born on 23 September 1904 in the Frederiksberg district of Copenhagen, the daughter of the German officer and aristocrat Friedrich August Heinrich von Bülow and his wife Fred Hedvig Christiane Damm. Although she was in fact born a baroness she was not interested in riding or dance, preferring furniture design and the violin. After her father's death in 1916, her Danish mother returned to Denmark with Bülow and her three sisters. She began to play the violin, studying under Gerhard Rafn (1891–1941), whom she married in 1923, and Emil Telmányi. She continued her studies abroad with Firmin Touche in Paris, Georg Kulenkampff in Berlin and Max Rostal and Carl Flesch in London. She debuted in 1929 at the Tivoli Concert Hall with Max Bruch's Violin Concerto, which was positively received. But as life as a concert pianist became too demanding for her, she turned to education, graduating as a music teacher in 1932 and qualifying in ear training under Dagmar Borup the following year. From the early 1940s, she was an active member of the Danish Music Teachers Association and initiated a long-lasting series of Scandinavian music teaching conferences in 1946. She also developed rhythmic musical education in Denmark after studying the method in Hanover in 1957. In 1961, she founded Nordisk Rytmik (Nordic Rhythm) which she ran from her home in Lyngby. It later received official support, receiving the name Instituttet for Rytmik (The Institute for Rhythm)). Bülow also gave courses in the rhythmic approach throughout Scandinavia, receiving support from her second husband, the music teacher Verner Oluf Mogensen, whom she married in 1945. From 1952–57 she chaired the Danish Ear Training Association and chaired the Rhythmic Educational Organization (RMO) from 1970–78. Gerda von Bülow's awards included culture prizes from Copenhagen County in 1969 and 1980 as well as award for music education in 1983. She died in Lyngby on 4 May 1990.

Swagger is used together with a set of open-source software tools to design, build, document, and use RESTful web services. Swagger includes automated documentation, code generation (into many programming languages), and test-case generation. History The Swagger API project was created in 2011 by Tony Tam, technical co-founder of the dictionary site Wordnik. During the development of Wordnik's products, the need for automation of API documentation and client SDK generation became a major source of frustration. Tam designed a simple JSON representation of the API, building upon the flexibility of the REST style of architecture and using many features of tooling built for the SOAP protocol. The concept for the user interface was proposed by Ayush Gupta, who suggested that an interactive user interface would benefit end users who wished to \\"try out\\" and develop against the API. Ramesh Pidikiti led implementation of the initial code generator and designer/developer Zeke Sikelianos coined the name Swagger. The Swagger API project was made open source in September 2011. Soon after release, a number of new components were added to the project, including a stand-alone validator, support for Node.js, and Ruby on Rails. In Swagger's early years, modest traction came from small companies and independent developers. RESTful APIs typically did not have a machine-readable description mechanism, and Swagger provided a simple and discoverable way to do so. Tam was invited to a meeting with some of the API industry's thought leaders including John Musser (ProgrammableWeb), Marsh Gardiner (Apigee, now a Google product), Marco Palladino (Kong), and Kin Lane (API Evangelist) to discuss a standardization effort around API descriptions. While the meeting did not yield a concrete plan to do so, it put Swagger on the map as a critical innovation in the API space. Helped by the use of the Apache 2.0 open-source license, a number of products and online services began including Swagger in their offerings, which accelerated quickly after adoption by Apigee, Intuit, Microsoft, IBM and others who began to publicly endorse the Swagger project. Shortly after Swagger was created, alternative structures for describing RESTful APIs were introduced, the most popular being API Blueprint in April 2013 and RAML in September 2013. While these competing products had stronger financial backing than Swagger, they initially focused on different use cases from Swagger, and as of mid-2014, Swagger interest was growing more quickly than the combination of the two others [source: Google Trends]. In November 2015, SmartBear Software, the company that maintained Swagger, announced that it was helping create a new organization, under the sponsorship of the Linux Foundation, called the OpenAPI Initiative. A variety of companies, including Google, IBM, and Microsoft are founding members. On 1 January 2016, the Swagger specification was renamed to OpenAPI Specification, and was moved to a new software repository on GitHub.https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification While the specification itself was not changed, this renaming signified the split between the API description format and the open-source tooling. As of July 2017, Swagger tools were downloaded over 100,000 times per day, according to hosting repositories Sonatype and npm. Usage Swagger's open-source tooling usage can be broken up into different use cases: development, interaction with APIs, and documentation. =Developing APIs= When creating APIs, Swagger tooling may be used to automatically generate an Open API document based on the code itself. This embeds the API description in the source code of a project and is informally called code-first or bottom-up API development. Alternatively, using Swagger Codegen, developers can decouple the source code from the Open API document, and generate client and server code directly from the design. This makes it possible to defer the coding aspect. =Interacting with APIs= Using the Swagger Codegen project, end users generate client SDKs directly from the OpenAPI document, reducing the need for human-generated client code. As of August 2017, the Swagger Codegen project supported over 50 different languages and formats for client SDK generation. =Documenting APIs= When described by an OpenAPI document, Swagger open- source tooling may be used to interact directly with the API through the Swagger UI. This project allows connections directly to live APIs through an interactive, HTML-based user interface. Requests can be made directly from the UI and the options explored by the user of the interface.

He had lengthy associations with the Chicago Civic Opera (1918–1932) and the Metropolitan Opera (1933–1950), and frequently performed at the Salzburg Festival during the 1930s. He appeared as a guest artist with opera houses internationally, including the Royal Opera House, the Teatro Colón, and the Teatro Carlo Felice among others. Lazzari was particularly known for his performances of Archibaldo in L'amore dei tre re and Leporello in Don Giovanni. In 1943 he created the role of Salomone in the world premiere of Italo Montemezzi's L'incantesimo. Music critic Harold Rosenthal stated that Lazzari was \\"one of the best singing actors in his particular repertory\\". While working in Chicago he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. His voice is preserved on complete recordings of Giuseppe Verdi's Rigoletto and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Don Giovanni which he made with the Metropolitan Opera. Life and career Born in Assisi, Lazzari began his career performing with the Vitale Operetta Company from 1908–1911; making his professional debut as L'Incognito in Franz von Suppé's Boccaccio. He then pursued studies in opera with Antonio Cotogni in Rome before making his first appearance in that city in 1914 at the Teatro Costanzi. He was committed to the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires for the 1914–1915 season, and appeared at the Municipal Theatre of Santiago in 1915 as Aldobrandino de 'Rangoni in Mascagni's Parisina. In 1916 Lazzari performed the role of Archibaldo in L'amore dei tre re at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City and gave his first appearance in North America in Saint Louis. In 1917 he was committed to the Boston Opera House, and made his New York City debut performing Colline in Giacomo Puccini's La bohème with Maggie Teyte as Mimi and Luca Botta as Rodolfo at Columbia University to an audience of 2,000 people. Lazzari was a principal artist with the Chicago Opera Association (COA) and the Chicago Civic Opera (CCO) from 1918–1932. He had earlier portrayed Ramfis in the Chicago premiere of Verdi's Aida with Rosa Raisa in the title role at the Auditorium Building, Chicago, in 1916; a role which he repeated for the grand opening of the Civic Opera House in Chicago in 1919. With the COA he sang Archibaldo to Mary Garden's Fiora in 1920. He performed in several operas opposite Amelita Galli-Curci in Chicago, including Count Rodolfo to Galli-Curci's Amina in Vincenzo Bellini's La sonnambula in 1921. He also performed the role of Claudius in the Chicago premiere of Ambroise Thomas's Hamlet in 1921. In 1925 he performed the role of Don Basilio in Gioachino Rossini's The Barber of Seville in Paris, and performed the role of Archibaldo to Lucrezia Bori's Fiora at the Ravinia Festival with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Other opera roles he sang in Chicago included Sparafucile in Verdi's Rigoletto, Raimondo Bidebent in Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor, Plunkett in Flotow's Martha, Figaro in The Marriage of Figaro, and the title role in Boito's Mefistofele among others. From 1933 to 1950 Lazzari was a leading bass at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. He made his debut at the Metropolitan Opera House on December 28, 1933 as Don Pedro in L'Africaine. Other roles he sang at the Met included Alvise in La Gioconda, Archibaldo, Colline, Count Rodolfo, Don Basilio, Dr. Bartolo in Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro, Ferrando in Verdi's Il trovatore, Leporello, Lothario in Mignon by Ambroise Thomas, Oroveso in Bellini's Norma, the Prefect in Linda di Chamounix, Raimondo Bidebent, Ramfis, Samuel in Verdi's Un ballo in maschera, Simone in Puccini's Gianni Schicchi, Sparafucile, Talpa in Puccini's Il tabarro, and Varlaam in Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov. His final performance at the Met was as Leporello to Paolo Silveri's Don Giovanni on December 5, 1950. Lazzari appeared annually at the Salzburg Festival from 1934 to 1939; portraying such roles as Bartolo in The Barber of Seville, Leporello in Don Giovanni, and Pistola in Falstaff. He made his debut at the Royal Opera House in London in 1939 as Leporello in Don Giovanni. In 1943 he sang the role of Salomone in the world premiere of Italo Montemezzi's L'incantesimo on a radio broadcast with the NBC Symphony Orchestra. One of his final appearances was as Archibaldo at the Teatro Carlo Felice in 1953. Lazzari died on 4 October 1953 at his home in Castel Gandolfo when he was 66 years old.

Habitat attributes are interpreted from the aerial images and categorized in a geographic database. The mapping project was first developed as an oil spill response tool for British Columbia, and now ShoreZone extends from Oregon to Alaska and has many other uses including ecological studies, marine conservation planning, coastal flooding and vulnerability assessments, and community education. Development A ShoreZone imaging and mapping prototype was originally developed by Dr. Ed Owens and demonstrated on Saltspring Island, British Columbia in 1979 . A decade of further development resulted in the first protocols for the Physical Shore-zone Mapping System published by the British Columbia Ministry of the Environment. A compatible biological classification was developed in the early 1990s and the fully integrated biophysical mapping system was first applied to Gwaii Haanas National Park, with the remainder of British Columbia imaged and mapped from 1991 to 2007. The State of Washington was imaged and mapped between 1994-2000,http://file.dnr.wa.gov/publications/aqr_nrsh_szusermanual.pdf and the coast of Oregon was imaged in 2011 and mapped in 2013. The Alaska program began in 2001 when the Cook Inlet Regional Citizens Advisory Council contracted Coastal and Ocean Resources Inc. to image and map Cook Inlet, and as of 2020 the Alaska program is on-going (see map). The spatially contiguous database of imagery and habitat attributes now includes over 100,000 km of shoreline. In 2014, Dr. Carl Schoch of Coastwise Science pioneered the use of Structure From Motion using Microsoft Photosynth to orthorectify ShoreZone oblique aerial imagery and to generate a point cloud of photographed objects used to produce a three-dimensional model of the shoreline. The digital post- processing of the imagery using Structure From Motion allows for quantitative measurements of shoreline unit dimensions, percent cover of substrate, percent cover of macro epiflora and epifauna, and time series assessments of shoreline change. In areas where a temporal sequence of imagery exists, such as in Cook Inlet Alaska and the North Coast of British Columbia, the time series are analysed to quantify shoreline erosion or accretion, and vulnerability to flooding in the context of sea level rise and changing wave dynamics. Beginning in 2016, commercial software is used to digitally process the aerial images to create orthophoto mosaics and shoreline elevation models. The Alaska portion of the database is now part of the Alaska Ocean Observing System and the Integrated Ocean Observing System. Partnership The ShoreZone mapping program is maintained by a unique consortium with no binding agreement. The consortium currently consists of over 50 local, regional, and national partners including First Nations, various industries, non-profits, state, provincial and federal governments. This partnership won the 2009 Coastal America Spirit Award that recognizes \\"exceptional projects that demonstrate the 'spirit' of teamwork for group efforts that are poised to address our challenging coastal issues.” In the United States, the Oregon ShoreZone program is supported by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Oregon Coastal Management Program. The Washington ShoreZone program is supported by the Washington Department of Natural Resources. The Alaska ShoreZone program has on-going support from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that also manages and distributes the imagery and data. In Canada, the British Columbia ShoreZone data is distributed by GeoBC.GeoBC The Nature Conservancy coordinated the program until 2016. Utility Coastal resource managers need an inventory of habitats and associated biota that are threatened by increasing development and encroachment along coastal areas, as well as indirect effects of human activities. Coastal mapping efforts, such as ShoreZone, to a large extent fulfill these needs by providing physical and biological characterizations of the shoreline. The ShoreZone imagery and maps were originally intended as an oil spill response tool, and notably the data have been used in several emergency situations including the grounding in 2012 of the drilling barge Kulluk near Kodiak, Alaska. Although the majority of users access only the imagery, the regional scale habitat attribute data have been used for ecological modelling and marine conservation planning. More recently the data are benefiting NOAA climate resilience studies. Recent improvements in quantifying habitat attributes allow for analytical studies such as estimating potential Blue Carbon resources of salt marshes. The imagery also has aesthetic appeal and is used for travel guides and gazetteers, art exhibits, exploring, books, and story maps. Assessments Over 450 ground stations have been used to inform the mapping process and to evaluate the accuracy of the interpreted aerial imagery. The utility of ShoreZone maps for change detection has been assessed, and findings include: 1) the NOAA Coast63 digital shoreline used by ShoreZone in Alaska poorly resolves features less than 50 meters, i.e., many small scale features are not represented and thus cannot be accurately described; 2) ShoreZone has no explicit minimum or maximum mapping unit resulting in inconsistent placement of unit breaks among mappers; 3) the combination of 1 & 2 contributes to the lack of repeatable unit breaks leading to potential false positive and false negative indications of change at the scale of individual shore units; and 4) users must be cognizant of the limitations imposed by qualitative mapping protocols used prior to 2016.http://www.sf.adfg.state.ak.us/FedAidPDFs/FDS11-63.pdf References  External links * ShoreZone * CoastView *Alaska ShoreZone *Washington ShoreZone *Oregon ShoreZone Category:Coastal geography ","title":"ShoreZone"},{"id":"49099205","text":"The term Greek legislative election, 1989 may refer to: *Greek legislative election, June 1989 *Greek legislative election, November 1989 ","title":"Greek legislative election, 1989"},{"id":"49099217","text":"The term Greek legislative election, 1915 may refer to: * Greek legislative election, May 1915 * Greek legislative election, December 1915 ","title":"Greek legislative election, 1915"},{"id":"49099240","text":"John Conway (also known by his Irish name Sean Ó Conbhuí) is a former Gaelic footballer from County Laois.

It is a mixture of the two optically active isomers of 12(Z) 9,10-epoxy- octadecenoic acid. This mixture is also termed 9,10-epoxy-12Z-octadecenoic acid or 9(10)-EpOMEhttps://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/6246154 and when formed by or studied in mammalians, isoleukotoxin. Occurrence Coronaric acid is found in the seed oils derived from plants in sunflower family such as (Helianthus annuus) and Xeranthemum annuum. Coronaric acid is also formed by the cells and tissues of various mammalian (including humans) species through the metabolism of linoleic acid by cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenase enzymes. These CYPs (CYP2C9 and probably other CYPs that metabolize polyunsaturated fatty acids to epoxides) metabolize linoleic acid to (+)12S,13R-epoxy-9(Z)-octadecaenoic acid and (-)12R,13S-epoxy-9(Z)-octadecaenoic acid, i.e. the (+) and (-) epoxy optical isomers of coronaric acid. When studied in this context, the optical isomer mixture is often termed isoleukotoxin. This same CYP epoxygenases concurrently attack linoleic acid at the carbon 9,10 rather than 12,13 double bond of linoleic acid to form a mixture of (+) and (-) epoxy optical isomers viz., 9S,10R-epoxy-12(Z)-octadecaenoic and 9R,10S-epoxy-12(Z)-octadecaenoic acids. This (+) and (-) optical mixture is often termed vernolic acid or when studied in plants and leukotoxin when studied in mammals. Coronoric acid is found in urine samples from healthy human subjects and increases 3- to 4-fold when these subjects are treated with a salt-loading diet. Coronaric and vernolic acids also form non-enzymatically when linoleic acid is exposed to oxygen and/or UV radiation as a result of the spontaneous process of autooxidation. This autoxidation complicates studies in that it is often difficult to determine if these epoxy fatty acids identified in linoleic acid-rich plant and mammalian tissues represent actual tissue contents or are artifacts formed during their isolation and detection. Metabolism In mammalian tissue, coronaric acid is metabolized to its two corresponding dihydroxy stereoisomers, 12S,13R-dihydroxy-9(Z)-octadecaenoic and 12R,13S-dihydroxy-9(Z)-octadecaenoic acids, by soluble epoxide hydrolase within minutes of its formation. The metabolism of coronaric acid to these two products, collectively termed isoleukotoxin diols, appears to be critical to coronaric acid's toxicity, i.e. the diols are the toxic metabolites of the non-toxic or far less toxic coronaric acid. Activities=Toxicities= At very high concentrations, the linoleic acid-derived set of optical isomers, coronaric acid (i.e. isoleukotoxin), possesses activities similar to that of other structurally unrelated leukotoxins viz., It is toxic to leukocytes and other cell types and when injected into rodents produce multiple organ failure and respiratory distress. These effects appear due to its conversion to its dihydroxy counterparts, 9S,10R- and 9R,10S-dihydroxy-12(Z)-octadecaenoic acids by soluble epoxide hydrolase. Some studies suggest but have not yet proven that isoleukotoxin, acting primarily if not exclusively through its dihydroxy counterparts, is responsible for or contribute to multiple organ failure, the acute respiratory distress syndrome, and certain other cataclysmic diseases in humans (see epoxygenase section on linoleic acid). Vernolic acid (i.e. leukotoxin) shares a similar metabolic fate in being converted by soluble epoxide hydrolase to its dihydroxide counterparts and toxic actions of these hydroxide counterparts. =Other activities= At lower concentrations, isoleukotoxin and its dihydroxy counterparts can protect from the toxic actions cited above that occur at higher concentrations of isoleukotoxin and leukotoxin; they may also share with the epoxides of arachidonic acid, i.e. the epoxyeicosatreienoates (see Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids), anti-hypertension activities.

He composed over a hundred songs, including The Vamp, Walkin' the Dog, Kitten on the Keys, Some of These Days, Don't You Remember the Time, and Sweet Hawaiian Moonlight. During the 1920s, he was employed by Jack Mills Music, Inc. Personal life Klickmann was born on February 4, 1885 in Chicago, Illinois. His father, Rudolph Klickmann, was a German immigrant. His mother Carolina (née Laufer) Klickmann was originally from Illinois. Frank was the second-born of five children: Emily (b. 1881), Ida (b. 1887), Florence (b. 1889), and Robert (b. 1890). In 1908, Klickmann married Jeanette Klickmann. It was his first marriage and her second. They lived in Chicago for an extensive period of time, before moving to Manhattan between 1922 and 1923. They remained in New York for the remainder of their lives. On June 25, 1966, Klickmann died at the Knickerbocker Hospital in New York. He was 81 years old. Career In 1906, Klickmann's first publication, Oh Babe, appeared under the name F. Henri Klickmann. Many of his early \\"rag\\" songs were co-written with bandleader, Paul Biese. Together they composed the songs, The Maurice Walk and The Murray Walk. The former was written for vaudeville performers Maurice and Florence Walton, and the latter for silent film actress, Mae Murray. Klickmann occasionally played in Biese's orchestra and arranged music for them. Klickmann's songwriting career began with, My Sweetheart Went Down With the Ship, which was a song inspired by the sinking of the Titanic. One of his first hits was a 1914 anti-war song, Uncle Sam Won't Go to War, co-written with Al Dubin. Klickmann arranged music for various music companies, including the McKinley Music Company of Chicago. In 1917, he ended his working relationship with the Paul Biese Orchestra in order to focus all his attention to arranging music. This decision provided Klickmann more time to the McKinley Music Company. By the 1920s, Klickmann's work was being published by the largest music publishers of popular sheet music in the country, Waterson, Berlin & Snyder, Inc.. At this time, he was rearranging composer Zez Confrey's songs into more readable arrangements for accompanied instruments, and working with lyricist Harold G. Frost. In 1921, he became a member of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. In 1923, Klickmann was hired full-time by Jack Mills Music, Inc. Under Mills, Klickmann published novelty songs, a book about jazz performance (1926), and jazz band orchestrations. He arranged music for the Six Brown Brothers and Eddie Cantor, and composed music for the ukulele and accordion. He also collaborated on a project with cartoonist Rube Goldberg, based on Goldberg's character, Boob McNutt. Klickmann edited various books containing the popular pieces of musicians, Wendell Hall, Buddy Rich, and Tommy Dorsey. During the 1930s, work started to wane. By 1942, Klickmann was self-employed and working for various music publishers. He also co-led a popular swing and jazz group with trombonist, Fred Norman and backing singers, Millie Bosman and Irene Redfield. In the mid-1950s, Klickmann retired.

According to the New York Times, she is « one of France's most prominent anti-racism activists ». She is a BET-France host and has produced and/or directed documentaries, TV and radio programs. She has published: Racism: a guide, France Belongs to Us, France: One and Multicultural and How to talk to kids about racism, a graphic novel Pari(s) d'Amies, and Afro! featuring Afro- Parisians who choose natural hairstyles.  Biography  Rokhaya Diallo was born in 1978, in Paris, from Senegalese and Gambian parents. Her father was a mechanic and her mother a sewing teacher. Her family moved to La Courneuve, a suburb of Paris, in 1989. After obtaining a bachelor's degree in International and European law, Diallo went on to study business, which led her to work for a short period at IBM, which she left because she felt \\"like a pawn\\". So she decided to work toward a marketing and distribution degree at the Université Panthéon-Sorbonne (Paris I), which she earned in 2003. She now works in broadcasting production. As an anime enthusiast, Diallo helped found the Japan Expo. She was also briefly a voice actress, performing Kamui Shiro as a child in X1999, by CLAMP, and Ex in Ah! My Goddess: The Movie. In 2001, she participated in the youth outreach program of La Courneuve. She was asked to join in the city's Youth Council and rose to the position of president within two years. As a feminist, she campaigns for the anti-sexist association Mix- Cité. She also campaigns for the organization ATTAC, which fights for sustainable and socially just globalization policies, notably during the Film Festival \\"Images mouvementées\\". = The Indivisibles = Diallo (second from left) at the press conference for the first \\"Y'a bon Awards\\" in 2009 In 2006, having heard that \\"most people consider being black and from a working class background to be a problem\\", Diallo founded the association, The Indivisibles. \\"People's looks seemed to associate me with a certain image and uncomfortable stereotypes.\\" \\"When we were young, my brother and I had never asked ourselves \\"where do we come from?\\", until we were asked by others\\". Diallo was not bothered by attaching the question to one's origin, but she objects to people placing their own yearning for exoticism over her. The Indivisibles campaigns to put a stop to \\"a partition of French citizenship by physical appearance\\" or by geographical origin. Originally created in secrecy, to \\"work with institutions such as the French Education Department\\", the association burst on to the publishing scene in 2009 with a large media exposure program oriented around their newly created \\"Y'a bon Awards\\" recognizing the most outrageous racist statements by French public figures. Diallo became a radio and television commentator and in 2011 she published Racism: a guide, in the philosopher Vincent Cespedes' collection. \\"France is my country. I know Paris better than Senegal. But how should she behave in a \\"structurally racist\\" environment? Mentalities need to change. Especially in the media, when their coverage of a news story focuses solely on a defendant’s skin color or geographical origin\\". Exposing Islamophobia holds an increasingly important place in her reasoning: \\"We only speak of secular education when the subject is Islam (and not in regard to any other religion), a religion we are led to believe is only practiced in France by sexist and violent fundamentalists of North African origin.\\" = Activity since 2004 = In 2002, Diallo took part in different humorous short-films by the group Une case en moins, as an actress, singer and songwriter. From 2009 to 2013, she was a commentator for La Matinale on Canal+, and since 2009 on RTL (French radio station). In March 2010, she was chosen to participate in the International Visitor Leadership program and as a guest of the US government. She visited the country to study its diversity. With four other leading figures - , Marc Cheb Sun, Lilian Thuram and Pascal Blanchard - she appealed and draws up a hundred propositions for \\"a multicultural and post-racial Republic\\". Since 2011, Diallo has hosted Fresh Cultures on the Mouv' (French radio station); she also hosted and co- directed a monthly show Egaux mais pas trop (Equals but not too much) on LCP. In March 2014, she published an editorial opinion piece in the weekly review Politis for International Women's Day. = Awards = Diallo was listed by Slate as 36th out of the 100 most influential French women in 2013, and appears among the 30 most influential black figures in Europe on Britain’s Powerful Media’s ranking. * January 2012 - awarded by the Conseil pour la Justice, l’Egalité et la Paix – COJEP (an international NGO working for democracy, human rights, the fight against racism and discrimination, living together and citizenship, affiliated with the UN and the Council of Europe) * October 2014 - #LabComWomen prizewinner in the category \\"Generosity\\". The prize created by TF1 and LABCOM recognizes women with noteworthy profiles, working and ambassadors in the digital world. * In March 2015, her documentary Steps to Liberty, which questions France's identity through the prism of young American leaders, won Best Documentary Film at the Regional and International Festival of Guadeloupe (FEMI).  Journalism = Press = Along with other personalities (Audrey Pulvar, Lilian Thuram, Pascal Blanchard...), she is featured in the October 2011 issue of Respect Mag magazine entitled \\"100% Blacks in France \\". She has produced several reports for the French press, such as on women in Bahrain and on racism in Tunisia for Les Inrocks, or on the Black Lives Matter movement, which made the front page of the newspaper Libération. Rokhaya Diallo also writes articles for the international press: the Washington Post, The Guardian and Al Jazeera. = Radio = She has been a columnist since 2009 on RTL. Since 2011, Rokhaya Diallo has been hosting France Culture on Mouv'. For a column for the Canal+ channel and for radio le Mouv', she went at the end of September 2011 to the annual meeting of the Black Congressional Caucus in Washington, D.C., a Congressional caucus in the U.S. Congress created at the time of the Black Civil Rights Struggle to bring together black parliamentarians. In September 2018, she created the podcast Kiffe ta race, with Grace Ly, which was broadcast on the Binge Audio platform. = Television = She is a columnist from 2009 to 2013 for Canal+35's La Matinale. Between 2011 and 2013, she presents and co-directs 18 issues of the monthly program \\"Égaux mais pas trop (in English : Equal but not too much)\\" on LCP, supported by the national agency for social cohesion and equal opportunities. The program will be removed from the parliamentary channel's schedule in 201436. 36 Caroline Fourest writes that Rokhaya Diallo complacently interviewed Dieudonné and Alain Soral in her program Égaux mais pas trop on LCP on August 9, 2012. From December 6, 2014 to May 31, 2015, she hosts, on Mediapart, six programs in a series called Alter-égaux, devoted to \\"issues of inequality and equality, race and racism, discrimination and affirmation. 38 She invites successively: Jean-Loup Amselle; Dominique Sopo; Nadia Geerts; Caroline De Haas; Raphaël Glucksmann; and James Cohenn. In July 2017, the press mentions her arrival as a columnist in \\"Touche pas à mon poste! (in English \\"Don't touch my post!\\") on C8. Her arrival on the show was linked to a line change wanted by host Cyril Hanouna after the criticisms for the \\"homophobic, racist and sexist remarks\\" that targeted her during the 2016-2017 season . The program will keep its fundamentals and its entertaining values but it will move up the line,\\" he told Challenges magazine.40 \\"The program will keep its fundamentals and its entertaining values but it will move up the line,\\" he told Challenges magazine. Rokhaya Diallo will be alongside other new recruits: Rachid Arhab, who was a journalist and TV presenter on France 2 and a former member of the Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel (CSA), Louis Morin, a former member of the Petit Journal, and Renaud Revel, former editor-in-chief of L'Express and head of the media section at the Journal du Dimanche41. This announcement caused a surprise on social networks , as the programme was \\"pinned for discriminatory abuses \\"43. 43 Rokhaya Diallo explains his decision to accept the position as follows for Libération: \\"The audience of Touche pas à mon poste! is a popular audience, it is not an audience pampered by the media, and it is not an audience that I find respected. 44 It only stays there for one season. She has also been the presenter of the BET Buzz programme on Black Entertainment Television (BET), alongside Raphäl Yem, since 2016. BET broadcasts programmes dedicated to \\"black culture\\" in France. It presents a weekly half-hour \\"people\\" and \\"lifestyle\\" magazine23. Since September 2018, she has been participating in the program \\"24H Pujadas\\" on the LCI channel once a week, as much as a presenter. She discusses political and social current events with guests and other columnists. In Le Monde, Benoît Thieulin, founder of the Netscouade, declared in January 2018: \\"She is intelligent, courageous, she looks good on television. In other words, she embodies something that can be watched. Better still, the generations of tomorrow. ».  Stances = Anti-racism = Diallo's action is consistent with the fight for race and ethnic equality, \\"especially among non-white French citizens, as their French identity is so often denied and depreciated.\\" (presentation of the Indivisibles on their website). She is a member of the advisory board of the Berlin-based NGO Center for Intersectional Justice, which seeks to address intersecting forms of discrimination and inequality. In June 2013, someone found guilty of using Twitter to call for Diallo's rape was sentenced to pay a fine of 2000 euros, of which 1400 were suspended, and 1000 euros for damages to the plaintiff. The following year, Diallo produced a documentary for French channels LCP/AN and France 3, Networks of Hate, covering hate speech and freedom of speech online. = Campaigning against anti-black racism = * Reporting for TV channel Canal+ and radio station le Mouv', in September 2011, Diallo attended the annual meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus (organization representing the black members of the United States Congress, created at the time of the Civil Rights Movement to unite black members of Congress). * With Audrey Pulvar, Lilian Thuram, Pascal Blanchard, Diallo appeared on the cover of the October issue of Respect Mag titled \\"100% French & Black\\". * In January 2012, after the publication of an article in Elle magazine considered racist, she co-authored with Sonia Rolland, China Moses, Eric Fassin, Clementine Autain, Audrey Pulvard, and many other figures, an opinion column in Le Monde questioning the magazine's lack of black women on its covers. = Gay rights = In December 2012, she took part in a demonstration supporting the right of gay couples to marry, where she noticed the lack of black participation. = Under-representation of black women in women's magazines = In January 2012, following the publication in the pages of Elle magazine of an article on black fashion deemed racist , she co-signed with Sonia Rolland, China Moses, Éric Fassin, Clémentine Autain, Audrey Pulvar and many other personalities, a column in Le Monde questioning the magazine about the absence of black women on its covers. On 6 March 2014, she signed the editorial of the weekly Politis on the occasion of International Women's Rights Day. = Decolonial Summer Camp = Rokhaya Diallo defends the organization of summer camps, some of whose meetings are \\"open only to 'racialized' people, i.e. those who feel they are victims of discrimination because of their origin [...]62\\". 62 It justifies itself by referring to the desire to \\"meet among people who are victims of racist violence, for a few hours, in a peaceful manner. 63,64 \\"She claims non-mixing as a useful political tool for anti-racist and feminist causes, which, in her view, makes it possible in particular to protect oneself from what she describes as \\"State racism\\". In an article for Slate, she writes on this subject: \\"Afrofeminist meetings that are not mixed are in no way intended to propose a definitive project for a segregationist society, since they are part of the temporality of a specific event. They offer their participants an escape route, a breathing zone in an oppressive society \\". = Criticism of the \\"a-critical\\" use of the term \\"anti-white racism\\". = Rokhaya Diallo is one of the signatories of a column, published in L'Obs, criticizing two passages of a policy text adopted for three years by the Movement against Racism and for Friendship between Peoples (MRAP) at its congress on 30 March and 1 April 2012. The signatories note the problems raised by the \\"a-critical\\" use of the concept of \\"anti-white racism\\". According to them, it is necessary, \\"to recall, with Albert Memmi, what he explained half a century ago, no link can be made between the racism of the dominant, reflecting and relying on the power of the devices of domination, and what he called \\"toothless racism\\", that is to say this form of \\"racism\\" of the dominated, without force, without power, incapable of being anything other than words, ...\\". > \\"How can we fail to see that the notion of \\"anti-white racism\\" has emerged > in the French political debate in order to invert the relationship of > responsibility: the \\"victim\\" would no longer be the immigrant or the > descendant of immigrants but the white person, an inversion that can be > expressed in another way; if hostility to immigration increases, it is the > fault of the immigrants, or again: if immigrants live and work in terrible > conditions, well, it is their fault. » = Communitarianism = Rokhaya Diallo wrote in 2011 in Racism User's Guide: \\"What is most striking is that the 'communities' stigmatized by the accusation of anti-republicanism do not exist! An association can bring together black people not in the name of belonging to a community, but in the name of the same experience: that of being black in France. Moreover, the terms \\"communitarian\\" and \\"communitarianist\\" are often confused: communitarianism is a political approach aimed at separatism. But what do community groups want if not inclusion in the Republic? Strangely enough, community groups are not always decried, they are even the subject of a double discourse. Anti- community offensives are aimed in particular at black people or people from the Maghreb. Those of Portuguese, Chinese or Jewish origin - or even people from Auvergne, whose social, economic or cultural organization, often marked by community belonging, is highly visible in the public sphere - are spared any criticism.\\" = Afro-feminism, intersectional and \\"decolonial\\" feminism = Rokhaya Diallo defines herself as \\"an intersectional and decolonial feminist \\"68 . 68 In an interview for the Inrocks in 2017, she states: \\"I have always been aware of sexism, I found it more prevalent than racism in my environment. I wasn't sent back to my skin colour until I was an adult. In my neighbourhood, not being white wasn't an issue, but gender inequality was. It is close to non-mixed Afrofeminist movements such as the Mwasi collective and to intersectional feminism, which believes that oppression or domination can be multiple (gender, class, race...). Rejecting universalist feminism, it is close to a more identity-based feminism: Afro-feminism, Islamic feminism. In an interview for the webzine Deuxième page, she explains: \\"For me, the word 'feminist' implicitly includes all these minority denominations \\". She also deplores the fact that traditional feminism (Dare feminism!, Les Chiennes de garde...) is very \\"white\\" and bourgeois, and does not take into account at all the specific problems of some women, especially black, Muslim or minority women. She states for example: \\"the vast majority of Islamophobic acts concern veiled women, and are therefore clearly sexist. Yet this does not elicit any reaction from traditional feminist associations. \\"To explain the origin of her feminist and anti-Islamophobic struggle, she states: \\"As far as veiled Muslim women are concerned, there is a problem: we want to fight them. Even if they are victims of sexism by veiling themselves, as some people claim, you cannot punish a victim.\\" In October 2015, she took part in the \\"March for Dignity \\"organized, with the support of Angela Davis, by a group of associations and personalities fighting sexism, racism and \\"police crime [which the group believes] is the ultimate expression of state racism. By claiming to be \\"Afrofeminists\\" or \\"decolonial feminists,\\" this mode of struggle \\"troubles historical activists,\\" according to Le Monde. For Elsa Dorlinn : \\"today, the idea that [white women] define for all women the right way to emancipate is - rightly - contested. » According to Maboula Soumahoron, decolonial feminism finds its sources on the other side of the Atlantic, borrowing its theory and lexicon from black feminism, it is inspired by the struggle of personalities such as Angela Davis. It is also in the United States that the concept of \\"intersectionality\\" was developed, representing the accumulation of several types of discrimination (ethnic, sexual, social, etc.).73 The concept of \\"intersectionality\\" is also being developed in the United States. In February 2015, Frédérique Calandra, PS mayor of the 20th arrondissement of Paris, refused Rokhaya Diallo the right to come and talk about violence against women during the Week for Gender Equality. She says of her decision that: \\"Rokhaya Diallo's point of view cannot represent feminism. She is made for feminism just as I am made for being an archbishop. She is] at best a useful idiot of Muslim fundamentalism, at worst a false nose of Tariq Ramadan. She also promised, \\"If Mrs. Diallo ever wants to debate, no problem, I'll beat her up! \\" Rokhaya Diallo finally spoke in a small room on the 20th, where more than a hundred people came to listen to her, particularly about the discriminatory treatment of sexual assault. Emmanuelle Rivier, Europe Ecology deputy for the Greens in charge of equality in the district, said she did not understand the reasons for the city council's refusal to invite Rokhaya Diallo. In September 2018, Frédérique Calandra also withdrew a subsidy that her town hall had given to a festival because Rokhaya Diallo was invited. In 2015, Caroline Fourest wrote: \\"Reading Rokhaya Diallo, it is never the time to denounce patriarchal and fundamentalist oppression, even when you are a victim and yourself a Muslim. Her \\"feminism\\" is used to mock feminists of Muslim culture who dare to stand up to fundamentalism sometimes at the cost of their lives, accusing them of wanting to sell \\"best-sellers\\". His main struggle, as a \\"feminist\\", consists in rehabilitating the veil and attacking the laity. » In November 2017, Rokhaya Diallo states: \\"I don't see how marking femininity with a veil is more sexist than marking it with high heels or a miniskirt. There is no reason to isolate the veil from the rest of the attributes associated with femininity.\\" = Prostitution = She co-authored an op-ed published in Libération on November 21, 2013, taking a stand against the criminalization of clients of prostitution. Entitled \\"Féministes, donc contre la pénalisation des clients\\" (Feminists, therefore against the criminalization of clients), this article relays the arguments of Médecins du Monde, the Sex Work Union and Act Up-Paris, explaining that the criminalization of clients will increase cases of HIV transmission to prostitutes; it is signed by the \\"collectif du 8 mars pour toutes\\" (March 8 for all). = Notoriety = According to the magazine Slate, Rokhaya Diallo is ranked in 2013 in 36th position among the 100 most influential French women and is among the 30 most influential black personalities in Europe according to the ranking of the British Powerful Media. = Awards = * On 21 January 2012, it will receive the Prize for Combating Racism and Discrimination from the international NGO Council for Justice, Equality and Peace (COJEP)121,122 \\"an international NGO which constitutes, wherever it is established, the relay of the AKP123\\"124 or \\"Erdogan's relay in Europe. » * On October 23, 2014, she is the winner of the #LabComWomen award in the Generosity126 category. The prize, created by TF1 and Labcom127, rewards women with an outstanding profile, who are active and ambassadors in the digital. * She received the Senegalese Diaspora for Equality and Justice's Sununet Prize for her positive contribution to the international image of Senegal. * In March 2015, her documentary Les Marches de la liberté, questioning the identity of France through the prism of young American leaders, received the Best Documentary Film Award at the regional and international Festival of Guadeloupe (FEMI). * In 2016, at the European Diversity Awards ceremony in London, she was awarded a distinction honouring her work in the category \\"Journalist of the Year \\". * In 2017, she was the only French guest to attend the inauguration of the Obama Foundation in Chicago.

The story of Gerasim, a deaf and mute serf whose life of poverty is brought into sharp relief by his connection with Mumu, a dog he rescued, brought greater national attention to the cruelties of serfdom, and received praise for its brutal portrayal of this institution in Russian society. Background Originally published in 1854, Mumu was written by Turgenev in 1852 while he was in custody for writing an obituary for fellow writer Nikolai Gogol.Moser, Charles. The Cambridge History of Russian Literature. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992. Web. From a good family,Chamberlin, William Henry. \\"Turgenev: The Eternal Romantic.\\" Russian Review 5.2 (1946): 10-23. Turgenev was well-read, and had spent extensive time in the West (he was fluent in German, French, and English). His primary concern, and the main topic of his writings, was Russia, and he wrote only in Russian. Although attempting to improve and distinguish Russia, he was not a Slavophile, but voiced his alignment with the west. Turgenev was most concerned with writing about and discussing serfdom. One reason Mumu was such an indirectly powerful critique of serfdom was the ways in which it showed the terror of absolute power of one human being over another. For this story, and his writings for Gogol's obituary, Turgenev was banished to his estate. Although part of the intelligentsia, Turgenev was criticized from both the left and right, as his views were not radical enough for the more revolutionary members of the intelligentsia. Instead, he was viewed as holding consistent liberal, romantic ideals. He was, however, one of the few writers who wrote on behalf of serfs, and against serfdom, treating serfs as humans with complex emotional lives.Frost, Edgar L.. “Turgenev's \\"Mumu\\" and the Absence of Love”. The Slavic and East European Journal 31.2 (1987): 171–186. He once went so far as to take up arms in defense of a serf.Zhitova, V. N. Vospominaniya o semje I.S. Turgeneva. Tul’skoye Knizhnoe Izdatelstvo, 1961. This was reflected in his first work, A Sportsman's Sketches, which was both a condemnation of his mother's treatment of serfs, and the beginnings of his sympathetic portrayals of the peasantry. Mumu, therefore, is an intense exploration of serfdom and the position of the Russian peasantry. Gerasim, the main character, is meant to represent the Russian peasant at his most raw: strong but mute, submissive yet resistant. His work and situation is a direct tie to the peasantry, including his portrayal as a Russian folk hero. Turgenev evokes themes of the Russian folk hero, using words such as bogatyri to evoke a strong connection between the peasantry and the heroes of Russia's past. Characters Illustration of Mumu by Vladimir Tabourine * The landlady (barinya) - The lady of the house. An old, lonely and bitter widow who adheres to everything in the ancient ways. She cruelly decides and manipulates the fate of her serfs. In the story, she is the contrast to Gerasim, but she too is without love and has grown cruel and isolated. Based on Turgenev's mother, Varvara Petrovna Turgeneva.Memoirs of Varvara Petrovna Zhitova * Gerasim - The porter in the household and protagonist of the story. Of remarkable size and strength, but deaf since birth. Gerasim is portrayed as a classical Russian folk figure, as both terrible and wonderful: mighty and sympathetic. He is also a symbol of the peasantry, while also very much his own person. Based on Andrey, who however did not leave the mistress. * Mumu - The dog rescued, raised, and pampered by Gerasim. The dog is an orphan, like Tatiana, but unlike her is not afraid of Gerasim, but rather loves him unconditionally. She serves as an excellent watch-dog and devoted companion to her master. Ultimately, Gerasim is forced by the lady to drown Mumu in the river after she becomes angered by her rejection and barking. * Tatiana - A household laundress. Described as a meek and timid woman, with few relations and abundant suffering. Like Gerasim, she is orphaned and alone. She becomes the object of Gerasim's desire, to which she responds with fear. She is ultimately forced by the lady to marry Kapiton. * Kapiton Klimov - The shoemaker in the household, and resident drunkard. He is absorbed by self-pity, and forced by the lady of the house to marry Tatiana, whom he does not love. * Volchok - The old guard dog that sits chained on the property: he does not try to obtain freedom, unlike Mumu, nor is he ever censured: He is meant to represent the downtrodden peasant. * Gavrila Andreyevich - The head steward of the household who does his mistress’ bidding while also stealing from her. * Liubov Lubimovna - A household maid, who attends to the mistress, as well as an old companion of Gavrila's who helps him steal from the mistress. Plot summary Statue of Mumu in Honfleur The story opens in Moscow, at the home of an unnamed, wealthy, and elderly widow. Mean and spiteful, she has been abandoned by whatever living friends and relatives she still has. The exposition then focuses on one of her porters, Gerasim, a man from the countryside. Born deaf and mute, he communicates with the other servants of the estate via hand signs. He is a man of almost superhuman strength, and was renowned in the country for his work in the fields. After being taken from his village, he eventually settles into life in the city, and, while his presence inspires fear in the other servants, he is able to remain on at least cordial terms with them. During this time, Gerasim becomes infatuated with Tatiana, the mistress’ laundress. He offers her gifts, including a gingerbread chicken, and follows her, smiling and making his characteristic unintelligible noises. His affection is quite protective, and he threatens a servant who “nags” her too severely. In another incident, Kapiton Klimov, the widow's shoemaker, speaks “too attentively” with Tatiana, and is, too, threatened by Gerasim. Kapiton, a drunkard who feels unfairly castigated for his vices, is chosen by the mistress to be married off. Speaking with her head steward, Gavrila, the widow decides that Kapiton shall marry Tatiana. Gavrila, aware of Gerasim's affections but unable to disagree with his master, relates this to Kapiton, who reacts with fear but ultimately agrees. He then informs Tatiana, who acquiesces but echoes the same concerns. Gavrila comes up with a plan, and, noting Gerasim's hatred of drunkards, has Tatiana pretend to be drunk in his presence. The plot succeeds, and Tatiana and Kapiton are married. However, Kapiton's drinking only worsens, and he and his wife are sent away after a year to a small village. As they depart, Gerasim follows them, and hands Tatiana a red handkerchief, causing her to burst into tears. During this walk, Gerasim encounters a dog drowning in a river. He saves her, whom he names Mumu, and nurses her back to health. He loves Mumu passionately, and she follows him around throughout his daily activities. After a year, the mistress sees Mumu in the yard, and has the dog brought to her. Mumu reacts poorly to the mistress, baring her teeth. The following day, Gavrila is ordered to get rid of Mumu, whose barking disturbs the widow, and he has the footman, Stepan, ambush the dog behind Gerasim's back and sell her in the market. Gerasim, distraught, searches for Mumu for the entire day, but Mumu returns. He learns that Mumu's disappearance was an order from his lady, and begins hiding his dog in his room. However, Mumu's “whining” is still audible, and when she is finally brought into the yard, her barking alerts the mistress to her presence. Knowing that the servants will be coming for Mumu, Gerasim barricades himself with her in his room, but, after Gavrila signs to him, explaining the situation, he promises to get rid of Mumu himself. He brings her to a cookshop, giving her a final treat before travelling to the river where he found her, commandeering a rowboat, and eventually drowns her—bringing his rescue of her full circle. He is followed by Eroshka, another servant, who reports back to the others. However, Gerasim does not return until night, when he gathers his things and then departs walking back to his old village. The mistress, initially angry, decides not to search for him, and soon dies. The story concludes with Gerasim returned to his fields, helping reap the harvest.  Prototypes  The real story with the dog happened at Turgenevs' house in Moscow. The landlady was Turgenev's mother, Varvara Turgeneva, and the strong mute serf was Andrey. Unlike Gerasim, Andrey stayed with his mistress. Varvara Zhitova, Varvara Turgeneva's adoptive or real daughter, tells a story of a marriage the mistress arranged for two of her favorite serfs, Agafya Semyonovna and Andrey Polyakov. That marriage turned out well, although the mistress demanded that all babies be put away, but they were kept at home secretly, so one day one of them had to have her mouth shut to hide her presence. Interpretations and Themes The Role of Chance: Chance and coincidence are themes throughout Turgenev's short works, and Mumu is no exception.Briggs, Anthony D. \\"Ivan Turgenev and the Workings of Coincidence.\\" The Slavonic and East European Review (1980): 195-211. Several incidents in the story are based entirely upon coincidence. For instance, Gerasim finds Mumu exactly as his beloved, Tatiana departs with her husband. Mumu is then reduced to a victim of fate; the mistress's arbitrary cruelty acting as an agent of destiny.Kagan-Kans, Eva. \\"Fate and Fantasy: A Study of Turgenev's Fantastic Stories.\\" Slavic Review 28.4 (1969): 543-560. While some critics, notably Briggs, have called Turgenev's use of this device as clumsy, and even “egregious,\\" it is less pronounced in this particular work than some of his others. Love and Isolation: A common theme discussed in this story is the presence and absence of love, and feelings of isolation which drive many of the characters’ decisions. There are many instances and relationships lacking in affection in this story: Kapiton is not in love with Tatiana, the old woman has no family, and indeed, there is no mention of family in the entire story. At the beginning, this lack of affection seems like an insurmountable barrier: In Gerasim's love with Tatiana he is unable to overcome his muteness, to express his feelings and bridge this gap.Somoff, Victoria. \\"No Need for Dogs or Women: Muteness in Turgenev's ‘Mumu’.\\" Russian Literature 68.3 (2010): 501-520. This, however, changes when Gerasim finds Mumu. Mumu represents love in its purest form: Gerasim's muteness does not limit his ability to express his feelings, and Mumu is unquestionably devoted to him. These different loves of Gerasim tie the story together: from Tatiana's departure, to the discovery of Mumu, and ultimately Mumu's death. The scene where Gerasim drowns Mumu seems almost like a wedding, drawing out the theme of tragic love. This love is, in part, so tragic because of Gerasim's lack of agency in finding and keeping love. Gerasim is alone because he has no say, and the old lady forced him to leave his home, thus isolating him and forcing him to give up love. Gerasim goes on to reject love and thus ends the story alone. Muteness: In the act of rendering Gerasim both deaf and mute, scholars discuss how Turgenev takes the role of an external observer to the greatest extreme. Due to his sensory failings, the author is unable to accurately represent his consciousness, or to infer his inner thoughts and feelings. In the first scenes of the story, Gerasim's inability to effectively communicate with his peers leaves him isolated and misunderstood.Turgenev, I.S. “Mumu.” Polnoe sobranie socinenij i pisem v dvadcati vos’mi tomax, vol. 5, 264-92. M.-L.: AN SSSR, 1960-68 Scholars suggest that by naming the dog Mumu, Gerasim finally acquires speech. His once meaningless moans become a meaningful word, that he can share with others. This language does not last long, however, for he is soon ordered to put the dog to death. With the death of Mumu, Gerasim also loses the only language he could possess. Final Rebellion: Critics are divided in their interpretations of Gerasims’ two final acts. To some the murder of Mumu represents the “ultimate manifestation of the hero’s enslavement,\\" and his return to his Homeland represents his defeat. There remains debate whether Gerasim represents a slave resigned to fate or a rebel finally liberated. Some scholars believe that while killing the dog was an act of ultimate submission, it is only after killing Mumu that Gerasim finds the strength to break free. Textual evidence implies that Gerasim did not plan his escape prior to the killing, because he had to return home to gather his things before breaking away. Furthermore, this idea of ultimate liberation is also supported by Turgenev's use of animal symbolism. When Gerasim is first brought to the estate he is described as an ox, a strong yet domesticated animal. In contrast, at the end of the story, he is compared to a lion, a wild and uninhibited creature. Adaptations As an extremely influential work, which was taught in schools during the Soviet Regime, Mumu has had many adaptations. Several film and media adaptations have been created since its publication, as this work was extremely influential for many Russian-speaking children. Several movie adaptations are listed below: A 1959 Live-Action movie (in Russian) A 1987 animated film (in Russian) made for TV A 1998 Live-Action movie (in Russian) Many songs have also been written referencing the work, including “Why did Gerasim drown Mumu?” There are also several monuments to Mumu in Russia, the most notable in Turgenev Square, next to Cafe Mumu (see header photo).

Alex originated as a non-tropical low near the Bahamas on January 7, 2016. Initially traveling northeast, the system passed by Bermuda on January 8 before turning southeast and deepening. It briefly acquired hurricane-force winds by January 10, then weakened slightly before curving towards the east and later northeast. Acquiring more tropical weather characteristics over time, the system transitioned into a subtropical cyclone well south of the Azores on January 12, becoming the first North Atlantic tropical or subtropical cyclone in January since Tropical Storm Zeta of 2005-2006. Alex continued to develop tropical features while turning north- northeast, and transitioned into a fully tropical cyclone on January 14\\\\. The cyclone peaked in strength as a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) and a central pressure of 981 mbar (hPa; 28.97 inHg). Alex weakened to a high-end tropical storm before making landfall on Terceira Island on January 15\\\\. By that time, the storm was losing its tropical characteristics; it fully transitioned back into a non-tropical cyclone several hours after moving away from the Azores. Alex ultimately merged with another cyclone over the Labrador Sea on January 17\\\\. The precursor cyclone to Hurricane Alex brought stormy conditions to Bermuda from January 7 to 9. On its approach, the hurricane prompted hurricane and tropical storm warnings and the closure of schools and businesses for the Azores. Alex brought gusty winds and heavy rain to the archipelago, though structural damage was generally minor. One person died of a heart attack because the inclement weather prevented them from being transported to hospital in time. Background and records As currently defined, the Atlantic hurricane season lasts from June 1 to November 30, the period in which tropical cyclones are most likely to develop across the basin. Occasionally, systems develop outside these seasons, most frequently in May or December. Activity in January is extremely rare, only five systems other than Alex being recorded since 1851: an unnamed hurricane in 1938, an unnamed tropical storm in 1951, Hurricane Alice in 1954–55, an unnamed subtropical storm in 1978, and Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005–06. Because Alice formed in December 1954 and persisted into January 1955, Alex is only the second hurricane after the unnamed storm of 1938 to originate within January. Alex's landfall on Terceira as a strong tropical storm marked only the second such occurrence for an Atlantic tropical cyclone in January – after Hurricane Alice of 1955, which made landfall on the islands of Saint Martin and Saba. Equally unseasonable as the time of its formation was its location: Alex became only the second hurricane on record to form north of 30°N and east of 30°W. Alex was the first hurricane to impact the Azores since Hurricane Gordon in 2012, and the only recorded hurricane to track within 230 mi (370 km) of the Azores outside the usual activity period between August and September. Unrelated to Alex, the formation of Hurricane Pali over the Central Pacific in early January coincided with Alex's development over the Atlantic. This marked the first occurrence of simultaneous January tropical cyclones between these two basins. Meteorological history In early January 2016, a stationary front spanned across the western Caribbean, spawning a non-tropical low along its boundary over northwestern Cuba by January 6. The low moved northeast ahead of the subtropical jet stream the following day, when its interaction with a shortwave trough produced a cyclonic disturbance at the lower atmospheric levels northeast of the Bahamas. This system proceeded northeast toward Bermuda, where unfavorable atmospheric conditions such as strong wind shear, low sea surface temperatures, and dry air initially inhibited tropical or subtropical cyclone formation. The system featured a large field of gale-force winds, with maximum sustained winds of 60–65 mph (95–100 km/h). On January 8, it passed about 75 mi (120 km) north of Bermuda, bringing strong winds and heavy rain to the islands. The next day, an unseasonable air pattern blocked the disturbance from continuing along its northeasterly path. Instead, the system turned east-southeast into a region slightly more favorable for subtropical development. On January 10, surface pressures below the system's core deepened to 979 mbar (hPa; 28.91 inHg) as the surrounding winds reached hurricane-force. Concurrently, a warm-core seclusion at the upper-levels marked the transition to a more symmetric structure, although convective activity near the center remained sparse. Once separated from the jet stream, the cyclone turned sharply to the south-southeast in response to a mid- latitude trough over the central Atlantic, entering a region with warmer waters of above average for January. The system underwent substantial changes to its cyclonic structure on January 11–12: frontal boundaries separated from the core of the cyclone, its core became symmetric, it became co-located with an upper-level low, and intense albeit shallow convection developed atop the circulation. All these factors indicated the storm's transition into a subtropical cyclone by 18:00 UTC on January 12, at which point it was situated 1,150 mi (1,850 km) west-southwest of the Canary Islands and received the name Alex from the National Hurricane Center. The cyclone proceeded to the east- northeast and eventually north-northeast over the next day, steered by the same trough that had enabled the previous southward turn. An eye feature soon appeared at the center of the cyclone's spiral bands, marking intensification. The 20 mi (25 km) wide feature cleared out early on January 14 and was surrounded by a largely symmetric ring of cloud tops. Alex then began to move away from the upper-level low it had been situated under and entered a region of lower wind shear, allowing the cyclone to acquire a deeper warm core with upper-level outflow typical of more tropical systems. Despite moving over waters, Alex continued to deepen and became a fully tropical cyclone by 06:00 UTC on January 14 – a transition that was supported by greater instability than usual for tropical cyclones due to colder upper-tropospheric temperatures than those around the equator. Upon the storm's transition, Dvorak satellite estimates indicated that Alex had achieved hurricane strength. The hurricane achieved its peak intensity as a tropical cyclone with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 981 mbar (hPa; 28.97 inHg) soon thereafter, classifying as a Category 1 on the Saffir–Simpson scale. As Alex moved north toward the Azores, decreasing sea surface temperatures and increasing wind shear caused the cyclone to weaken through January 14 and 15. A deterioration of the convection around the hurricane's eye feature marked the start of its transition back to an extratropical cyclone. Becoming increasingly disorganized due to shear, Alex weakened to a tropical storm before making landfall over Terceira Island at 13:15 UTC with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). Less than five hours later, the system completed its transition into an extratropical cyclone, featuring a more elongated circulation, an expanding radius of maximum winds, and frontal boundaries. Furthermore, the overall structure became more \\"comma shaped\\" as a consequence of the frontal systems. The system deepened slightly to 978 mbar (hPa; 28.88 inHg) as it turned northwest towards Greenland. On its passage, the cyclone interacted with the mountainous southeastern coast of the island, generating hurricane- force winds over that region. Around 06:00 UTC on January 17, the remnants of Alex were absorbed into a larger extratropical low over the North Atlantic. Preparations and impact=Bermuda= The precursor to Alex brought stormy conditions to Bermuda between January 7 and 9, dropping of rain at Bermuda International Airport over the course of these three days. Gusts to disrupted air travel, downed trees, and left 753 customers without power on January 8\\\\. Waves as high as prompted small craft advisories and the suspension of ferry services between the islands. =Azores= alt=A wave crashing against a rocky escarpment When Alex was classified as a hurricane on January 14, the Azores Meteorological Service issued a hurricane warning for the islands of Faial, Pico, São Jorge, Graciosa, and Terceira, and a tropical storm warning for São Miguel and Santa Maria. A red alert—the highest level of weather warnings—was declared for central and eastern islands. Anticipating strong winds and heavy rain, homeowners stacked sandbags to protect their properties from flooding and boarded up doors and windows. Officials closed schools and administrative buildings for the duration of the storm. SATA Air Açores cancelled 33 domestic and international flights for the morning of January 15, stranding more than 700 passengers. The hurricane and tropical storm warnings were discontinued on January 15 after Alex had passed. Traversing the archipelago on January 15, Alex brought heavy rain and gusty winds to several islands. Rainfall totaled in Lagoa, São Miguel, and in Angra do Heroísmo, Terceira. Wind gusts exceeded on Santa Maria Island and peaked at in Ponta Delgada, São Miguel. The strong winds brought down trees, damaged some roofs, and triggered scattered power outages. The storm caused minor flooding; six homes in Ponta Delgada sustained damage, while the winds destroyed the roof of another. Landslides occurred across the central islands, though their damage was limited. Overall, the storm's effects were milder than initially feared, possibly because the strongest winds were located far from the center of Alex as the system underwent extratropical transition. One person suffering a heart attack died as an indirect result of Alex when turbulence from the storm hindered their emergency helicopter from taking off in time.

Las Haldas is located on the Pacific coast approximately north of Lima and about south of the Casma river valley, noted for the extensive ruins of the Casma/Sechin culture. For most of its history Las Haldas, a coastal community, coexisted with the inland agricultural communities in the Casma River Valley. Distinguishing characteristics of Las Haldas are both its size and age as one of the earliest ruins of the ceramic period, its dependence upon maritime resources for subsistence, the lack of agriculture, and its distance from any source of fresh water. Las Haldas is in a coastal area in which are found the oldest known civilizations of the Americas. The Casma valley archaeological sites are a few miles north and the Norte Chico civilization is about to the south. Discovery and description Las Haldas was discovered in 1956 and has since been studied by many archaeologists. It was not discovered earlier because of its unlikely location, far from sources of fresh water and land which could be irrigated for agriculture. Las Haldas is located on a terrace near but above the rocky coastline of the ocean at an elevation of about . The area around Las Haldas is nearly devoid of vegetation. This coastal area near receives less than of precipitation annually.\\"Weatherbase: Chimbote, Peru, http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=13548, accessed 14 Jan 2015 Las Haldas. The ruins cover about , consisting of a 370-meter (400 yards) long, U-shaped central area with a large mound at one end and four slightly- elevated plazas. The largest of the plazas has a circular court. Around the central area are 18 additional smaller mounds, each with its plaza and one with another circular court. Residential areas are found to either side of the monumental ruins. Pozorski, Shelia and Pozorski, Thomas (Spring 2006), \\"Las Haldas: An Expanding Initial Period Polity of Coastal Peru\\", Journal of Anthropological Research, Vol. 62, No. 1, pp. 30, 34. Dowloaded from JSTOR. Las Haldas is isolated from other contemporary archaeological sites, the nearest being the inland agricultural sites in the Casma River valley to the north which is also the nearest source of fresh water. Throughout its history, Las Haldas probably traded maritime products to the Casma River settlements for agricultural products. Agricultural products collected at Las Haldas include cotton, beans, including lima beans, potatoes, chile peppers, and lucuma (a tropical fruit still popular in Peru). All of these products were probably imported from the Casma River valley. Maize has not been found at Las Haldas although it was being grown at this time in Peru.Pozorski, p. 29, 36 Dating and influence The ruins at Las Haldas primarily date from the Initial Ceramic Period of 1800 BCE to 1000 BCE. However, the site was occupied in the Late Pre-Ceramic Period from 3000 BCE to 1800 BCE and continued to be occupied in the Early Horizon Period of 1000 BCE to 200 BCE. Most of the monumental construction occurred during two phases, the first beginning about 2000 BCE and lasting 300 to 400 years and the second phase, relatively brief, beginning about 1400 BCE, during which time Las Haldas reached its apex as a community. Phase 2 construction appears to have been modeled on the Sechin Alto complex in the Casma River valley. In the Phase 2 period, architectural (and possibly political influence) of Las Haldas extended north to a weakening Sechin Alto and nearby coastal communities. Pozorski, pp. 29–30, 37–43 After 1000 BCE, Las Haldas was gradually abandoned as the importance of irrigation agriculture grew and coastal settlements became smaller and subsidiary to inland agricultural communities in river valleys.Pozorski, p. 49 The maritime theory It has long been an article of faith by scholars that the rise of civilization was based on intensive agriculture, particularly of at least one cereal. The production of agricultural surpluses is seen as essential in promoting population density and the emergence of complex society. Anthropologist Michael E. Moseley challenged this view in the 1970s, asserting that the earliest civilizations in Peru were based not on agriculture, but on exploitation of the rich maritime resources of the Peruvian coastline at sites such as Las Haldas which practiced little or no agriculture. Reinforcing Moseley's theory, Los Haldas, according to radiocarbon dating, appears to be older than many nearby inland agricultural sites in the Casma and Sechin Valleys.Pozorski, p. 108 Investigations and earlier dating of other sites, notably nearby Sechin Bajo, have called Moseley's hypothesis into question, but in 2004 he still maintained that perhaps \\"Peruvian fisherman can be credited for creating the earliest civilizations in the Americas.\\"Moseley, Michael E. (2004), \\"The Maritime Foundations of Andean Civilization: An Evolving Hypothesis,\\" http://www.hallofmaat.com/ancientamerican/the-maritime-foundations-of-andean- civilization-an-evolving-hypothesis/, accessed 2 Feb 2020 Water Given the distance to the nearest source of drinking water, Las Haldas would seem undesirable as a location for a settlement. Some anthropologists have argued that water wells must have existed near Las Haldas. The Pozorski's, a husband and wife team, argued to the contrary. Many early fishing settlements, they said, were located distant from sources of water because fish and shellfish resources are more abundant away from the fresh water near the mouths of coastal rivers. They also argued that the requirements for drinking water would be small given the mild temperatures and the water content of seafood and that much cooking could have been done with sea water. It was feasible, they claimed, for the inhabitants of Las Haldas to have hauled drinking water from the Casma Valley.Pozorski, pp 30–36 See also * Casma/Sechin culture * Cerro Sechin * Chankillo * Mojeque * Sechin Alto * Sechin Bajo ReferencesBibliography *SHELIA POZORSKI AND THOMAS POZORSKI (2002), The Sechin Alto Complex and Its Place Within Casma Valley Initial Period Development. in Andean Archaeology I, William H.

The film was edited by Gopinath with music composed by Santhosh Dhayanidhi. The film, featuring a new technical crew, began production during 2015 and released on 30 December 2016. Plot Vetri (Selva), a real estate businessman, plans to buy an old school in Pondicherry to establish a new resort there. Another opponent businessman Senthil Nathan (Mime Gopi) has more of a chance of finishing the final deal. Senthil's horoscope says that he should never own a haunted property, and he has a fear of ghosts. Dev (Suresh Ravi), Sathish (Ramesh Thilak), and Kumar (Darbuka Siva) are childhood friends who have been involved in cheating practices for money from childhood. They discover a new idea to cheat people using their fear of ghosts. Priya (Aishwarya Rajesh), a junior film artist who dreams of becoming a heroine someday, and Joseph Chellappa (Ramdoss), a film makeup artist, join the three. Priya acts as the ghost, and Joseph does her makeup. Priya does this to make her brother Gautham (Saran) continue his schooling. Dev, Sathish, and Kumar act as exorcists. One day, the five plans to cheat Vetri but get trapped. Vetri assigns them a task to do the same ghost drama in the school in Pondicherry in order to make Senthil drop his plan of buying the property. They accept the deal and go to Pondicherry. They do all sorts of paranormal activities, and Senthil's men believe that the school is haunted. However, they themselves feel certain abnormal things happening around them. The next day, Vetri tells them about Senthil's visit to the school at night. Priya does not accompany them as she falls sick. All the boys reach the school. This time, Chellappa acts as the ghost, and they do the paranormal activities again. After Senthil runs, they themselves again feel the same activities and hear a hiccup sound. All four run out of the school and reach their rooms; they find that Priya has gone to the school in search of them. They go to the school to rescue Priya and find her possessed by a ghost. They find her in a horror look scribbling on the board. They seek the help of a priest in the nearby church. He gives them holy water and a bible. They read the bible and throw the holy water on the ghost-obsessed Priya. The ghost calms down and tells them that she is Mohanavadhani alias Mo (Pooja Devariya), who always dreamed of becoming a math teacher. When her dreams came true, she died out of continuous hiccups on the first day of her class as a teacher. She wants her unfulfilled dream of teaching math. She makes all four men sit and teaches them math. Finally, Mo's spirit leaves Priya’s body, tired of teaching the four dumb men. The movie ends with the school successfully being sold by Vetri, Priya becoming the heroine of a ghost film, and Chellapa being her makeup man. However, Dev, Sathish, and Kumar continue cheating people.

Behind the distinguished façade of the building there is a collection of paintings, drawings, engravings, watercolours and objects, all directly related to this family of painters. The museum is located at 8 Choorstraat, not far from St. John's Cathedral. The Slager Family The founder of the Slager painting dynasty was Petrus Marinus Slager (1841 - 1912). Four of his children, Piet, Frans, Jeannette and Corry, were also artistically gifted and followed in their father's footsteps. Piet and Frans were both married to artists; Piet married Suze Velsen, while Frans married Marie van Gilse. Grandson Tom Slager represented an artistic third generation. With the death of Tom, who had no children, the male line of the Slager family became extinct. The Slager family also played a prominent role in the cultural life of 's-Hertogenbosch. For years they were involved in the former Koninklijke School (Royal School), the precursor of today's Art Academy in the city. As art teachers, the painters of the Slager family were a source of inspiration to a great many students. Collection The three successive generations of the Slager family span the period from the Renaissance Revival to Post- Impressionism. Their works date between 1861 and 1994 in subjects ranging from cityscapes of the old town of 's-Hertogenbosch, village scenes and landscapes of Brabant, the Belgian Campine and southern Europe, to still lifes, flowers and portraits. Many of the works produced by the family now belong to private collections in the Netherlands or abroad, but public institutions and other museums also own works. Since 1968 the Slager Museum's collection has been managed by the P.M. Slager Foundation. What started out with the legacy bequeathed by Suze Bergé-Slager, the daughter of Piet Slager and Suze Velsen, has grown into a museum whose collections have expanded significantly some fifty years later. The present collection not only contains works by the Slager family, but also by other painters, including Pieter de Josselin de Jong, a former art student of P.M. Slager, and Herman Moerkerk, two artists with strong ties to the province of Brabant. In addition to exhibitions of works from its own collections, the Slager Museum organizes temporary exhibitions of works by other artists, such as Anton Heyboer in 2014-15. The museum also houses furniture and objects from several periods, immersing visitors in the domestic and artistic atmosphere of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. History Located in the historic buildings on 8, 10 and 16 Choorstraat in 's-Hertogenbosch, the Slager Museum is within walking distance of St. John’s Cathedral. The museum was opened by Suze Bergé-Slager and Hein Bergé in 1976, within a decade of establishing the P.M. Slager Foundation on 25 October 1968. The aim of the Foundation is to raise the profile of the work of the eight Slager family artists. The building, which was acquired for the museum in 1975, originally belonged to the Maatschappij van Brandverzekering voor het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden (Fire Insurance Company of the Kingdom of the Netherlands), a company whose name can still be read on a tablet above the entrance. From 1936 the spacious lower floors of the building accommodated the Openbare Leeszaal en Boekerij op R.K. Grondslag (Public Reading Room and Library on Roman Catholic Principles). To mark the opening of this reading room, a special exhibition was organized showing 31 works by P.M. Slager. It was to be the first of many exhibitions mainly devoted to works by artists from 's-Hertogenbosch. When the library moved out of the former Insurance building after some 35 years, the lower floors became vacant. Since 1959 Mr and Mrs Bergé-Slager had been living in the house above the library and had gradually transformed their home into a museum, filling it with paintings by members of the Slager family. They decided to turn the lower floors into a dedicated museum, and named it after the Slager family as a tribute to its painters, their colleagues and their students. After a thorough renovation, the Slager Museum opened its doors on 23 April 1976 (the 100th anniversary of Frans Slager's birthday). In 1978 Hein Bergé also bought the adjacent buildings, the former home of the Simons family (mother and sons), from where they once ran both a grocery shop and the famous de Vierkante Meter ('the Square Metre', the tiniest pub in 's-Hertogenbosch, with standing room only). This remarkable museum expansion, with a history all of its own, was opened on 26 November 1987. The last major renovation dates from 2010. The artistic members of the Slager family, incidentally, never lived in the museum building which now houses their works.  Further reading  * Nel van der Heijden Rogier, Slager.

The essay comprises five chapters, three of which were previously published in 1853 in Putnam’s Magazine under the title “An Excursion to Canada.” (Thoreau withheld the remaining two chapters following an editorial dispute with George William Curtis, his editor at the magazine.)

Overview The M62 type was one of the most important types of diesel locomotive in the Comecon countries, with over 5,000 units being built for the railways of the Eastern Bloc, Cuba, Mongolia and North Korea. Initially designed to meet a requirement of the Hungarian State Railways, the reliability and the durability of the type helped it become a mainstay of many railways in the former Communist bloc. As it had done for many of those countries, the arrival of the M62 - or K62, as the units built for North Korea were designated at the factory - helped North Korea to significantly reduce its use of steam locomotives for mainline operations, and they played an important role in the DPRK's economic improvements of the 1960s. Aside from the \\"K62\\" designation given by the factory, the Korean State Railway gave the type a unique class name as well: Sinsŏng. The class name, when written in Hanja, is 新星. In this case, these hanja are read as sinsŏng; however, there is a class of domestically-built diesel shunters whose class name is written with the same hanja: the Saebyŏl- class (새별, \\"New Star\\"). In practice this is not an issue, as the use of Chinese characters to write Korean is officially discouraged in the DPRK. Although many types of diesel locomotive have been operated by the Korean State Railway over the years, the most important, in terms of both quantity and scale of operations, has been the K62-class, of which 64 units were built new for North Korea. These were built in two batches, the first being constructed between 1967 and 1969 (48 units), and the second batch of 16 between 1972 and 1974. Of the second batch, five were delivered in 1973 with trucks for service on the Soviet-DPRK border at Tumangang. Though plans were made to obtain 2M62-type two-unit versions of the M62, this ultimately failed to materialise; however, at least one twin-unit was delivered, whose remains have been seen, gutted and split in half - one section in P'yŏngyang, the other south of Mulgae on the P'yŏngbu Line to Kaesŏng. In the early 1970s, the Kim Chong-t'ae Electric Locomotive Works reverse-engineered a Soviet-built M62. This led to the production of the Kŭmsong-class copies. In 1998, the Kim Chong-t'ae Works began a project to convert M62s to electric operation, resulting in the Kanghaenggun-class electric locomotives. 21 Soviet-built M62s have been converted thus far, along with two of the Kim Chong-tae Works-built copies. These are used widely on lines such as the P'yŏngŭi and P'yŏngnam lines. The identities of the locomotives thus converted is unclear for the most part, but 632 is known to have been rebuilt into electric number 1.5-13. The K62 class has been the backbone of diesel power on North Korea's railways for many years, being used all over the country, including on electrified lines. Because of their reliability and the crews' familiarity with the type, between 1996 and 2000 second-hand M62-type locomotives were bought from various countries. These locomotives were brought in from Russia, Germany, Poland and Slovakia, and were numbered variously in the 600, 700 and 800 series ranges. The locomotives purchased from Germany, Poland and Slovakia retain their European-style buffers, although the European couplers have been replaced with the Janney (AAR-type) knuckle coupler used by the Korean State Railway. 600 Series This series, numbers 내연601 to 내연665 is made up of the 64 units delivered new to North Korea from the factory, as well as one unit obtained second-hand from the Polish State Railways (내연665). 내연656 (works number 1384, built 1971), although built for the Korean State Railway, wasn't delivered immediately, instead having served for some years with Soviet Railways, assigned to the Lvov region as M62-1265. Some of the units originally built for the DPRK have since been retrofitted with exhaust silencers. 내연656 - built for North Korea, but served in the USSR for some years before being delivered. Here the Russian lettering is still visible. Some units of this series are being modernised, which includes the replacement of the original Kolomna 14D4 engine. The modernisation package includes replacement of the original engine with the new Kolomna 12ChN26/26 engine, and of the original 4-14DG generator with the new 5-26DG. These have a much lower fuel consumption than the originals, and can go longer before overhaul is required. In 2000, 내연604 was sent back to Luhanskteplovozstroi to undergo this modernisation, at which time it received a new blue and white livery similar to that used by the Russian Railways. Additionally, it received new headlights like those found on the Russian DM62 and M62U variants. Since 2006, the new 12ChN26/26 engines and 5-26DG generators have been delivered to North Korea, the modernisations now taking place in domestic shops. So far, 내연602 - the machine inspected by Kim Il-sung and which carries plaques commemorating the occasion \\\\- is known to have been modernised. Locomotive 602 also has the distinction of having been the first North Korean locomotive to cross the Korean Demilitarized Zone since the end of the Korean War. Almost all locomotives of the 600 series are painted in the standard blue over dark green livery, although there are a few exceptions. 604, as mentioned, was repainted into a blue and white scheme used by the Russian Railways. Several, including 622, 639 and 658 are painted in a scheme becoming more common, which replaces the blue in the standard livery with light green. 629 is overall dark green with a white stripe, and, as mentioned above, 656 still carries its Soviet paint and even lettering, while 653 has been repainted into the green and yellow scheme used on the 700 series locomotives. The one locomotive in this series that wasn't ordered new, 665, is one of the very few second-hand units that received the standard blue over green livery. Known to be assigned to P'yŏngyang Depot are 602, 619, 620, 622, 625, 627, 638, 650, and 664. One locomotive was rebuilt, likely after an accident, with new cabs similar to those on the Red Flag 6-class electrics locomotive, but with dual headlamps; this is numbered 내연001 and is painted in the standard livery. 700 Series A 700-series locomotive, bought second-hand from Germany, working at P'yŏngyang Station on 5 October 2013. In the 1990s, the Korean State Railways obtained some M62s from Russia for parts, as well as attrition replacements, one of which was partially repainted into standard light blue over dark green (keeping the distinctive striping of the original Russian scheme, and even the original Russian number plates on the ends) and was assigned the number 646 - this is a number originally assigned to one of the 64 units delivered new. Starting in the mid-1990s, the Korean State Railways began buying M62s second- hand from former Communist countries to put into service. The first such purchase came from Germany, which saw a total of 31 units shipped from the stock of the former East German Deutsche Reichsbahn between 1996 and 1998 - six in 1996, fourteen in 1997 in three shipments, and eleven in 1998 in at least two shipments: * 21 December 1996 - 220 048-3, 220 219-0, 220 289-3, 220 292-7, 220 318-0, 220 322-2; * 22 April 1997 - 220 043-4, 220 234-9, 220 290-1, 220 335-4, 220-345-3, 220 367-7; * 19 November 1997 - 220 371-9, 220 372-7, 220 375-0 * 20 November 1997 - 220 114-3, 220 211-7, 220 296-8, 220 317-2, 220 332-2 * 11 March 1998 - 220 008-7, 220 180-4, 220 305-7, 220 319-3 * 1998 - 220 086-3, 220 087-1, 220 119-2, 220 159-8, 220 334-7, 220 342-0, 220 362-8 In 2000, a total of 13 units were received from the Polish State Railways, shipped in two batches: * 8 May 2000 - ST44 103 (w/n 1970/830), ST44 152 (1968/519), ST44 325 (1971/1166), ST44 518 (1976/2497), ST44 649 (1977/????), ST44 673 (77/2912) * 1 October 2000: ST44 72, ST44 549, ST44 840, ST44 929, ST44 937, ST44 947, ST44 999 All of the locomotives in the 700 series have been repainted into overall green with a yellow stripe (arranged the same was as the previous DR livery of burgundy red with a white stripe). Known to be assigned to P'yŏngyang Depot is 715. The origins of the following units are known: * 내연701 ex-DR * 내연705 ex-DR * 내연706 ex-DR * 내연707 ex-DR * 내연719 ex-DR * 내연720 ex-DR * 내연728 ex-PKP * 내연738 ex-PKP * 내연742 ex-PKP * 내연743 ex-PKP * 내연744 ex-ŽSR 800 Series For reasons unknown, two of the 13 M62s bought from Poland, the nine bought from Slovakia and those bought from Russia - new or second-hand - are grouped together in the 내연800 series. The lowest number seen thus far is 내연855. The reason for the seeming gap is not known, but it is possible that the many units obtained from Russia for use as parts stores were given numbers in the lower end of the range for inventory purposes. A total of nine units were received from the Slovak Republic Railways in 2000, delivered in two batches: * 8 May 2000: 781 826 (ex 781 317; w/n 1971/1191), 781 827 (ex 781 281; 1970/905), 781 828 (ex 781 373; 1971/1247) * 1 October 2000: 3 unidentified units. Their new numbers are not known, but the dark red livery still carried by some of these machines give their origins away. Nineteen of the units delivered from Russia are known to have entered operational use. These are likewise numbered in the 8xx series, grouped together indiscriminately with the machines bought from Slovakia and Poland. Of these, fifteen were delivered second-hand in 1989, all from the Lvov Division of the Soviet Railways, all M62S type; M62S is the designation for those locomotives originally built for the Soviet Railways of the original M62 design. These are: * July 1989: M62-1005 (w/n 0933, 1970), M62-1008 (w/n 0936, 1970), M62-1011 (wn 0939, 1970), M62-1077 (w/n 1030, 1970); * August 1989: M62-1101 (w/n 1054, 1970), M62-1102 (w/n 1055, 1970); * September 1989: M62-1187 (w/n 1301, 1971), M62-1189 (w/n 1303, 1971), M62-1191 (w/n 1308, 1971), M62-1195 (w/n 1312, 1971), M62-1246 (w/n 1363, 1971), M62-1262 (w/n 1381, 1971), M62-1288 (w/n 1586, 1972); * October 1989: M62-1083 (w/n 1036, 1970), M62-1085 (w/n 1038, 1970). A DM62 at the St. Petersburg Railway Museum. At least three of the ex-Russian locomotives that have entered service, 862, 863 and 870, are of the DM62 type. The DM62 was a variant of that, originally delivered to the Soviet Army between 1982 and 1994. These were operated by the 10th, 52nd and 36th Guards Missile Divisions of the Soviet Army to pull the combat missile trains in which RT-23UTTKh rail-mobile ICBMs were carried. The DM62 differs from the standard M62S by a number of changes designed to improve the reliability and survivability of the locomotive; some of these changes were later incorporated into the design of the (2)M62U. External spotting differences include the bogies, the rectangular housings for the headlights, and the box between the headlight on which the number plates are mounted. Other differences include heat sensors in the journal boxes, automatic starters for the engine, blackout shields, and multiple-unit operation regardless of the locomotives position in the train. Following the dissolution of the Railway Rocket Troops in 2000, these locomotives were transferred to the Russian Railways. A 2M62U of the Russian Railways. In addition to the units received second hand, two M62UP - single-section versions of the Russian 2M62U twin-section locomotives - were built new for the Korean State Railway in 1990; these were given the factory designation KM62U. Externally, these differ from standard M62s in their headlights, which are mounted in the same rectangular housings as on the DM62 and other minor details. They are powered by a water-cooled Kolomna 14D40U2 two-stroke diesel engine and have a GP-312U2 generator.

Description Starting in 1967, the Voroshilovgrad Locomotive Factory in Voroshilovgrad, USSR (now Luhansk, Ukraine), began production of 64 K62-class variants of the M62 for the Korean State Railway. The Kim Chong-t'ae works subsequently reverse-engineered these locomotives, along with their diesel engines and other components imported from the USSR. These efforts led to the production of the Kŭmsŏng class locomotives using both copied components and Russian-made parts. In testing, the first prototype, numbered 8001, the goal of attaining a maximum speed of was achieved, and the copy of the Kolomna 14D40 engine produced . However, reliability issues prevented mass production. The second unit, 8002, has been on display at the Three Revolutions Exhibition in P'yŏngyang since it was built. The first two units were both painted in a yellow and red livery, strikingly different from the blue and green scheme applied to the Soviet-made versions. 8001 is in service, pulling trains on the P'yŏngŭi Line. Another view of Kŭmsŏng 8002. There are a number of noticeable external differences between the Kŭmsŏng class locomotives and the Soviet-built M62s. The most immediately evident is the number and arrangement of the side windows, and the shape of the cab windows. Also very different are the headlights: the top light is round on the Kŭmsŏng instead of rectangular, and the main headlights are mounted in pairs, and higher up, than on the M62. Another readily noticeable difference is that the bogie frames are constructed with welded steel profiles. Conversions to electric Like the M62, some Kŭmsŏng class locomotives have also been converted to Kanghaenggun-class electric locomotives. Two have been seen so far - #0309 in dark green and white, and #399 in dark blue and white, but it is not known whether these were converted from existing Kŭmsŏng class locomotives originally built as diesels, or if the electrics use newly built bodies.

They were converted to 3,000 V DC electric operation by the Kim Chong-t'ae Electric Locomotive Works from Soviet-built K62-class diesel locomotives. A similar project has been undertaken by the Azerbaijan Railways, who have converted a number of their M62 locomotives to electric operation as well. Description Through the 1990s, North Korea suffered through a severe economic crisis, made worse by severe floods in 1995 and 1996, and a drought in 1997. This period is known as the \\"Arduous March\\" or \\"Forced March\\"; the class derives its name from this. The economic crisis also made obtaining diesel fuel extremely difficult, so the Korean State Railways decided to convert a number of diesel locomotives to electric operation, as intensive efforts have been made to restore as much generation of electricity as possible, with fair success over the past years. As a result, in 1998 the Kim Chong-t'ae works began a program to convert the more decrepit M62-type diesels in the KSR's inventory to electric operation. This was achieved by removing the diesel engine, fuel tanks and other unneeded equipment, and the installation of the necessary transformers and related gear to convert the power collected from the overhead lines, via newly-installed pantographs, to the traction motors. The resulting unit is considerably lighter than the diesel version, and sound like oversized streetcars. Like the original diesels, these produce , making suitable for the same services as the diesels. At least 21 Kanghaenggun-class locomotives have been rebuilt so far, numbered 강행군1.5-01 through 강행군1.5-21 (1.5 refers to 1 May, International Workers' Day). The previous identity of one unit is known - 1.5-13 was rebuilt from the former 632. In addition to the units numbered in the 1.5-xx range, two others of this class have been noted, numbered 309 (painted dark green and white) and 399 (dark blue and white), which are distinctly different from the 1.5-series. Unlike those, which were rebuilt from original Soviet-built M62s, the bodies of these have all the distinctive features of the Kŭmsong-class, domestically built copies of the M62.

Description Following the success of the Red Flag 6-class articulated locomotives, the Kim Chong-t'ae Electric Locomotive Works set to the development of a successor in the early 1990s. The new design integrated updated mechanical and electric components, allowing for a maximum speed of 120 km/h with a power output of . They are essentially an upgraded, two-part version of the Ch'ŏngnyŏnjŏl Kinyom-class locomotives, which are a locally manufactured derivative of the Francorail-MTE CSE26-21-type diesel locomotives received by the Korean State Railway from France in the 1980s. The first two prototypes were numbered 7001 and 7002, and both were painted in different variations of a red and yellow livery. Misleadingly, 7001 wore \\"Red Flag 6\\" nameplates on the cab ends; 7002, however, carried new nameplates inscribed with the new designation, Red Flag 2.16 class, after the birthdate of Kim Jong-il. Aside from the two prototypes, locomotives of this class have not yet been noted on rail lines generally seen by foreigners, though two have been seen inside the Kim Chong-t'ae Works plant. 7002 was on display at the Museum of the Three Revolutions in P'yŏngyang for a time, but by the spring of 2007 it had been removed and put into service in the northern part of the country.

However, with the electrification of steep mountain lines, it was realised that a more powerful locomotive was needed. Therefore, the Kim Chong-tae Electric Locomotive Works began design work on an articulated locomotive to operate freight trains on the difficult mountainous sections. Using the Red Flag 2 class as a starting point, the Red Flag 6 (붉은기6, Pulg'ŭn'gi-6) class was developed. The result was a permanently coupled Bo'Bo'+Bo'Bo' articulated locomotive with eight capacitors, made up of two sections; these sections are single-cab versions of the Red Flag 2. The Red Flag 6 class is thus an articulated descendant of the Škoda Type 30E, which had formed the basis for the design of the Red Flag 1 and Red Flag 2 after North Korea bought a licence to build the type, including technology transfer, from Czechoslovakia. The first prototype was shown in 1981. Numbered in the 6000 series, production of the new design began in 1986, and was put into service in 1987 to haul freight trains on the P'yŏngra Line. These four-bogie, eight-axle articulated units are long, weigh and produce .

They were built for the Chosen Government Railway (Sentetsu), who designated them DeRoNi (デロニ) class, and after the partition of Korea were inherited by the North Korean State Railway, where they were known as the Chŏngidu (, \\"Electric 2\\") class.Hayato, Kokubu, 将軍様の鉄道 (Shōgun-sama no Tetsudō), Description The Government-General of Korea began working on a national electric power policy in November 1926, and the resulting plan was completed in December 1931. Chapter 4, \\"Utilising Electricity in Transportation in Korea\\" dealt with the electrification of Korea's railways. In 1937, a plan to electrify the Bokgye–Gosan section of the Gyeongwon Line, the Jecheon–Punggi section of the Gyeonggyeong Line and the Gyeongseong–Incheon Gyeongin Line was submitted to the Imperial Diet, which approved it in 1940. The Railway Bureau began implementation of the plan in 1938, and subsequently placed orders with Mitsubishi, Toshiba and Hitachi for 26 electric locomotives. Sentetsu's order placed with Hitachi was for six electric locomotives intended for operation on the planned electrification of the Gyeongwon and Gyeonggyeong lines - four for the former and two for the latter. Of these, a total of four were delivered by war's end, 2 each in 1943 and 1944; these were designated DeRoNi class (デロニ) by Sentetsu, and numbered デロニ1 through デロニ4. This class name, デロニ (DeRoNi), comes from the Sentetsu classification system for electric locomotives: DeRoNi = De, for \\"electric\\" (from 電気, denki), Ro, to indicate six powered axles (from Japanese roku, 6), and Ni (from Japanese ni, 2), indicating the second class of electric locomotive with six powered axles. Though generally quite similar in appearance to the both types of the DeRoI-class locomotives, there were a number of features that distinguished the DeRoNi class from those. These were: equally spaced side windows; a distinctive ventilator shape; a distinctive arrangement of the deck railings; three-point electrical connectors mounted vertically at the centre of the end decks like on Soviet VL19 class; they were slightly longer and slightly more streamlined than the DeRoI locomotives. After the end of the Pacific War, at the time of the partition of Korea, all four of the DeRoNi locomotives remained in the North. These were operated on the Kosan-Pokkye segment of Kangwŏn Line prior to the Korean War. As the Korean War caused the destruction of the electrification of North Korea's rail lines, they sat disused until 1956, when they were reclassified Chŏngidu (전기두) class and numbered 전기두1 through 전기두4. They were then refurbished at the engine shops at Yangdŏk for use on the Yangdŏk-Ch'ŏnsŏng section of the P'yŏngra Line, which had been electrified in 1956 as the first stage of North Korea's electrification plans. Originally painted brown, they were repainted in 1958-1959 in the light blue over dark green livery to match the scheme that was made standard with the introduction of the Red Flag 1 class electric locomotives.

They were very similar to the Toshiba-built DeRoI-class locomotives and the DeRoNi-class locomotives built by Hitachi. They were built for the Chosen Government Railway (Sentetsu), but the war ended before delivery took place. They were delivered to the Korean National Railroad after the partition of Korea, which designated them 데로3 (\\"Dero3\\"). During the Korean War all were captured by the Korean People's Army and taken to North Korea, where they were put into service by the Korean State Railway as the Chŏngisŏ (, \\"Electric 3\\") class. Description The first electrified railway in Korea was the narrow gauge streetcar line in Seoul running from Seodaemun to Cheongnyang-ni via Cheongno and Dongdaemun, which was opened on 18 April 1898 by the Hanseong Electric Company. This was actually the first railway of any type in Korea, having preceded the Gyeongin Railway from Noryangjin to Jemulpo, which opened on 18 September 1899. The first electrified standard gauge mainline railway in Korea was the privately owned Geumgangsan Electric Railway, which on 1 August 1924 opened a line from Cheorwon to Geumhwa electrified at 1,500 V DC. Later, the line was extended from Cheorwon to Naegeumgang; the extension was opened on 1 July 1931. The Government-General of Korea began working on a national electric power policy in November 1926, and the resulting plan was completed in December 1931. Chapter 4, \\"Utilising Electricity in Transportation in Korea\\" dealt with the electrification of Korea's railways. In 1937, a plan to electrify the Bokgye–Gosan section of the Gyeongwon Line, the Jecheon–Punggi section of the Gyeonggyeong Line and the Gyeongseong–Incheon Gyeongin Line was submitted to the Imperial Diet, which approved it in 1940. Sentetsu issued its requirement for an electric locomotive in 1938, beginning discussions with Mitsubishi in that year regarding the implementation of the electrification plan. Part of the Railway Bureau's goal with the electrification plan was to set a new world speed record, and to go with that, a state-of-the-art locomotive was desired. The project entailed many Japanese firsts, including the first use of 3,000 V electrification, and, specific to the DeRoI class locomotive, the first use of regenerative brakes. The resulting design was very similar to the EF12 class of the Japanese National Railways. When the electrification of rail lines in Korea was begun in 1943, Sentetsu ordered twenty DeRoI class locomotives of 135 tons - sixteen from Toshiba and four from Mitsubishi The original class name, デロイ (DeRoI), comes from the Sentetsu classification system for electric locomotives: DeRoI = De, for \\"electric\\" (from 電気, denki), Ro, to indicate six powered axles (from Japanese roku, 6), and I (from Japanese ichi, 1), indicating the first class of electric locomotive with six powered axles. Design work was undertaken by Mitsubishi, with Shinichi Matsuda designing the control circuits and Saneyoshi Hirota designing the main motor. The design was very similar to the EF12-class of the Japanese National Railways. The electrical components were manufactured by Mitsubishi Electric, while the mechanical components were produced by Mitsubishi's Mihara Vehicle Works. Though generally quite similar in appearance to the Hitachi-built DeRoNi type and the Toshiba-built DeRoI type locomotives, there were a number of features that distinguished the Mitsubishi-built DeRoI class from the others. These included: equal spacing of side windows; a distinctive ventilator shape, including two relatively large ventilators; and a distinctive arrangement of the deck railings. The four units ordered by Sentetsu were intended for use on the Kyŏnggyŏng Line, but none were completed by the end of the Pacific War; three were nearly complete. After the war, the Allied General Headquarters (GHQ) in Tokyo ordered the construction and delivery of a further ten units to Korea as war reparations, including the three near-complete Mitsubishi units. Mitsubishi-built units 31 and 32 were delivered in August 1946, while number 33, although likewise completed in June 1946, wasn't delivered until June 1948. The remaining, unfinished unit was scrapped at the factory. These were all delivered to the southern zone of occupation, but during the Korean War all three of the Mitsubishi-built DeRoI locomotives were captured and taken to the North.

Description Although some lines had been electrified already in the colonial era, the large-scale electrification of North Korea's railways began in 1956 after the end of the Korean War and the subsequent reconstruction of North Korea's railway infrastructure. To work the newly electrified lines, an order was placed with the Škoda Works in Czechoslovakia for electric locomotives of works Type 22E2, based on the Type 12E locomotives built by Škoda for the Czechoslovak State Railways (ČSD class E 499.0). The Type 12E was developed by Škoda Works based on the technology of the BLS Class Ae 4/4 built by SLM Winterthur. The first prototype was completed in 1953, and production of types 12E1—12E6 continued until 1958 for the ČSD and the Polish State Railways (as class ET13), along with the very similar derivative types - the Type 22E2 for North Korea, and Types 24E0, 41E0—41E2 and 29E0 for the Soviet Railways (as class ЧС1). All variants of the type were built to operate on the 3,000 V DC system. These are dual-cab locomotives with welded-steel bodies and two two-axle bogies. Each bogie has two six-pole DC traction motors, one for each axle. Current collection is via pantograph from overhead lines; the on-board electrical system is 48 V. The total number of Type 22E2 locomotives ordered by the Korean State Railways is not known, but at least three are still in service as of October 2015. Some have been rebuilt in various ways, such as the addition of 'bumpers' on the ends and other features unique to individual units; these have been renumbered (one such rebuilt locomotive carries the number plates of the Ch'ŏngnyŏnjŏl Kinyŏm-class \\"Pulg'ŭn'gi 4011\\", but the unmodified examples continue to carry their original 전기50 series numbers.

The thesis came under heavy criticism from multiple directions, including medical professionals, due to claims within the thesis, including advancing a conspiracy theory whereby the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the pharmaceutical industry supposedly conspire to promote vaccinations in the absence of evidence of safety and efficacy. The awarding of the degree created questions about the standards being applied and whether or not the thesis supervisors and examiners had sufficient knowledge to oversee the research, and led to calls for the university to review the doctorate. A number of individuals and medical organisations – including academics and researchers from other parts of the University of Wollongong – spoke out against the findings of the thesis, emphasising the need for vaccinations in order to prevent serious disease; and the University of Wollongong was criticised for a perceived lack of transparency in their doctoral process and an alleged failure to uphold standards of scholarship. The thesis was conducted from within the university's School of Humanities and Social Inquiry, under the primary supervision of cultural studies professor Brian Martin and the co-supervision of sociologist Andrew Whelan. Although describing himself as \\"hardly a neutral observer\\", Martin argued that the questions raised about the work equate to biased attacks on Wilyman and himself. The university responded to the criticism by asserting that the research was conducted and examined under high standards, and spoke in defence of academic freedom. The University of Wollongong also agreed to conduct a review into their overall doctoral process, but the scope did not include specific PhD recipients, and therefore did not address Wilyman's work. Prior to the PhD, Wilyman had already received some attention for her assertion that the parents of Dana McCaffery, a child who died of pertussis, has \\"cashed in\\" on their daughter's death following the award of a prize to the McCafferys by Australian Skeptics – they had donated the money to charity. More recently, she has been criticised for speaking at anti-vaccination events and for charging large sums for \\"expert reports\\" in court cases, despite having no medical qualifications. Background Judith Wilyman was awarded a Masters by University of Wollongong (UOW) in 2007 in the Faculty of Law, Humanities and the Arts; her thesis topic was the Australian government's pertussis vaccine policy. Her thesis alleges a connection between vaccinations and autism, a claim that was already convincingly refuted, and false claims that vaccines do not control whooping cough. By 2009, Wilyman was a member of the Australian Vaccination-risks Network (AVN), an anti-vaccination group, and coordinates two anti-vaccination groups; Vaccination Decisions and Vaccination Choice. In 2011 Wilyman opposed the cancer-preventing HPV vaccination saying evidence about the vaccine's benefits were not clear, and it was reported that she claimed that vaccinations are linked to autism. HPV vaccination has significantly reduced rates of cervical cancer, and is thought to have the potential to eliminate it altogether. In 2012 she caused controversy after the death of a child from whooping cough, questioning \\"whether the family had been paid to use their daughter's death to promote vaccine\\", causing the family of the deceased to request that Wilyman not use their daughter's death in furthering her agenda. In 2013, the Australian Medical Association (AMA) criticised the university's decision to fund Wilyman to attend a conference in the US. Wilyman was provided with $3,000 by the university to present a paper opposing human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccinations. The conference was organised by predatory open access publishing company OMICS Publishing Group, which has also been criticised for running predatory meetings with no effective standards for speaker selection. In response to the criticism of Wilyman's trip, the university's Dean of Research, Tim Marchant, stated that the university upheld the principles of academic freedom and, accordingly, it was important to support Wilyman and the presentation of differing viewpoints, even when they were controversial. Brian Martin, who was supervising Wilyman's research, also supported the decision, arguing that attending the conference was a valuable experience for Wilyman. Questions of misconduct concerning Wilyman's Masters thesis were raised in 2014, and were investigated and cleared in 2015. The Australian reported that \\"Wilyman [was] shielded from critics\\" by the university in 2014 when their media office refused a request to promote the 44th Annual Scientific Meeting of the Australasian Society for Immunology, to be held at a Novotel Hotel in Wollongong. The reason given was that, if the conference \\"will be discussing vaccinations, we should steer well clear of doing any publicity. We don't want to inflame any opponents of ... Judy Wilyman.\\" According to the university, they were attempting to limit \\"the vicious and repeated attacks being directed ... towards a then student\\" PhD award Wilyman entered a PhD a program in 2007 in the same UOW Faculty as awarded her Masters, but with her research focus expanded to cover Australian vaccination policy more generally. In 2008, the supervision of her studies was transferred to Peter Dingle at Murdoch University, and returned to UOW in 2011 under Brian Martin. The thesis was accepted by UOW in 2016. Although details of the examiners have not been released, in May 2016 The Australian reported that one of two original examiners did not recommend that a PhD be granted. It was passed after a third academic evaluated the thesis and recommended changes. The thesis came under heavy criticism from multiple directions, including medical professionals, due to claims within the thesis, including advancing a conspiracy theory that the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the pharmaceutical industry supposedly conspire to promote vaccinations in the absence of evidence of safety and efficacy. The awarding of the thesis lead to criticism and questions about the standards being applied and whether or not the thesis supervisors and examiners had sufficient knowledge to oversee the research and led to calls for the university to review the doctorate. A number of individuals and medical organisations – including academics and researchers from other parts of the University of Wollongong – criticised the findings of the thesis, emphasising the need for vaccinations in order to prevent serious disease; and the University of Wollongong was criticised for a perceived lack of transparency in their doctoral process and an alleged failure to uphold standards of scholarship. The university responded to the criticism by asserting that the research was conducted and examined under high standards, and spoke in defence of academic freedom. The University also agreed to conduct a review into their overall doctoral process, but the scope did not include specific PhD recipients, and therefore did not encompass Wilyman's work. =Doctoral claims= Biological scientist Helen Petousis Harris writes that the thesis abstract contains conclusion, and quotes Wilyman's aim of her thesis as an attempt to \\"assess the rigour of the claims supporting the efficacy, safety and necessity for the use of an expanding number of vaccines in the Australian Government’s National Immunisation Program\\". Brull reports that according to supervisor Brian Martin, Wilyman's thesis makes four major points: * Wilyman claims that the death rates from diseases in Australia had declined before most vaccines were introduced, leading to a suggestion that other factors may have had a role in the reduced infection rate. * It is alleged in the thesis that Australia's vaccination policy follows international models, rather than being based on local conditions. * In her thesis, Wilyman claims that there is a conflict of interest when research on vaccination is conducted by pharmaceutical companies. * She alleges that some areas of research which relate to vaccination policy have not been examined, even though there may be value in doing so. Other, more specific, claims include that the World Health Organisation (WHO) formed a secret committee, which in turn orchestrated \\"hysteria relating to a global swine flu pandemic in 2009\\" and that the organisation is \\"perceived to be out of touch with global communities and … controlled by the interests of corporations and the World Bank\\". At one stage during Wilyman's candidature, Australian immunisation expert and advisor to the WHO Peter McIntyre offered to advise her on her research, but withdrew his offer as she was \\"not willing to entertain\\" alternative points of view that contradicted her beliefs. Wilyman's PhD thesis claims that \\"diseases for which vaccines are recommended have not been demonstrated to be a serious risk to the majority of children\\". Medical academics and the Australian Medical Association (AMA) have questioned whether Martin had sufficient knowledge to supervise the thesis, with McIntyre observing \\"No doubt the examiners selected have credentials within that area of study but they are likely to lack necessary credentials in health sciences that would enable them to be aware of the full picture here\\". Similarly, an editorial in The Australian was harshly critical of both Wilyman and the University. It dismissed the central idea of the thesis as \\"rather like a sociologist who insists that jet aircraft remain aloft only because of a conspiracy between aeronautical engineers and greedy airlines\\" and noted the problem of academic overreach, with the faculty presuming to judge the quality of work well outside its area of expertise. It characterised the University of Wollongong as putting itself on the wrong side in a \\"battle of life and death\\", and questioned whether the granting of the PhD \\"could 'reasonably be expected' to lead to lower levels of vaccination?\\" New Matilda journalist Michael Brull reports that Martin responded to the question of expertise by stating that Wilyman's thesis was about policy, and accordingly, \\"if anyone can lay claim to having special knowledge about policy, it is those who have researched policy itself\\". Expertise in immunology and epidemiology, according to Martin, can give \\"no special insight into vaccination policy\\". Brull advises against stripping Wilyman of her PhD as it may change her from being a \\"marginal quack\\" to a \\"persecuted martyr\\", and argues that the claims in the thesis identified by Martin are \\"issues of both politics and science\\", not only questions of policy, and therefore were more properly the domain of the hard sciences. Brull observes that the PhD avoided rigorous and informed peer review by being conducted through the University of Wollongong's social sciences faculty, thus avoiding serious scientific scrutiny with the examiners potentially being \\"out of their depth in dealing with questions of vaccination science\\". =Academic health science sector responses= University of Auckland biological scientist Helen Petousis Harris, who has a PhD in Vaccinology, was highly critical of the thesis and writes: :Wilyman's \\"references to support these outrageous comments are from the bottom dwelling literature that includes 50-year-old discussions along with well-established, thoroughly debunked pseudoscience. At no point does she mention any of the vast scientific literature that includes large clinical and epidemiological studies - or attempt a critique of it.\\" :\\"It is [a] litany of deceitful reveries. How it could possibly pass as a piece of Doctoral level work is inexplicable and it has made no contribution to knowledge. Shame on you University of Wollongong.\\" Saxon Smith, president of the NSW branch of the AMA, characterised it as \\"a thesis that’s talking about the science of medicine without any support of its argument from credible scientific literature\\", adding \\"the evidence is clear about the safety of vaccines.\\" Alison Campbell, an associate dean and biological sciences lecturer at the University of Waikato, produced a blistering analysis criticising the use of out-of-date references as well as pointing out numerous scientific errors in Wilyman’s master’s work, including calling the unexplained exclusion of two of four types of vaccine components \\"an alarming omission for a paper on immunisation\\". The Medical Journal of Australia criticised the university in awarding a PhD to a student \\"demonstrating a glaring lack of understanding of immunology and vaccine science,\\" suggesting that unless legislation keeps the anti-vaccination movement in check \\"we are ushering in a dangerous time.\\" John Dwyer AO, emeritus professor of medicine at the University of New South Wales, wrote: \\"[Ms Wilyman] has endorsed a conspiracy theory where all sorts of organisations with claimed vested interests are putting pressure on WHO to hoodwink the world into believing that vaccines provide more benefits than they cause harm. Many well-established concepts in science are being challenged in this thesis with no data to support the conclusions provides [sic].\\" He pointed out that numerous leading scientists and at least five major scientific organisations are criticising the university for rewarding poor scholarship and asking that the thesis be re-examined by experts in immunology and epidemiology, which is what the thesis addresses. In a February 2016 media-release the Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) directly questioned suggestions of bias from Wilyman. In challenging central arguments of her thesis, the RACP highlighted that the TGA is the regulatory body responsive to the monitoring and investigation of any adverse events and any significant concerns around vaccination safety. American surgical oncologist David Gorski refers to the thesis as an academic travesty, pseudoscientific and containing \\"easily refutable downright incorrect information.\\" He also \\"has to wonder how much Martin buys into antivaccine pseudoscience\\", and as an example refers to Martin's prior defence of discredited Andrew Wakefield. Gorski goes on to say that \\"Martin has a history of being sympathetic to medical cranks. He views crank views as \\"medical dissent\\"\\". In response Martin accused Gorski of being part of an \\"orchestrated\\" attack on Wilyman and the University of Wollongong led by Australian pro-science group Stop the Australian Vaccination Network (SAVN). Gorski later wrote in ScienceBlogs that this accusation was based on a false argument that criticism of the scientific validity of Wilyman's thesis was an attack on the freedom to present dissenting views in science. =University response= Responding to the criticism of the thesis from several medical researchers and public health advocates who called for a review by the university's academic board, the university reiterated that research is conducted under strict standards, and that they do not \\"restrict the subjects into which research may be undertaken just because they involve public controversy or because individuals or groups oppose the topic or the findings\\". Although very critical of the thesis, this view is partially shared by journalist Michael Brull, who argued that having \\"unorthodox or distasteful\\" opinions should not be grounds for the denial of a PhD. He goes on to support the freedom of such intellectual inquiry. In January 2016, the Vice Chancellor of the university, Paul Wellings, announced a review into the doctoral process. However, the review did not examine specific doctorates, and therefore did not look at the awarding of Wilyman's PhD. Upon completion, the university's report found that their higher degree research policies and procedures were consistent with those at other comparable Australian universities. Immunology academic John Dwyer noted that even though the university's review made some \\"excellent recommendations for improving the postgraduate research students' experience\\", it \\"failed to address the vital question of matching the scientific question to be examined to the expertise of the supervisor and the ultimate reviewers\\". According to the university, all theses are examined by two people with \\"unchallengeable knowledge in the field of study\\", but the university does not reveal the identities of the examiners or their respective academic fields. In March 2016, the university's compliance officer turned down a request to identify the examiners, arguing that \\"the examiners would be offended, humiliated or intimidated by the conduct of the media and the public once their names are released\\", concerned for \\"their physical, psychological or emotional wellbeing\\" and noting that current privacy laws forbid the release of the information. John Dwyer AO responded that the names of examiners would not have been required if the university had agreed to re-examine the thesis, adding \\"as we know they are social scientists not clinical scientists\\". In a rebuttal the Australian Skeptics considers UOW's statement of a possible \\"detrimental effect on the [examiner's] physical ... wellbeing\\" to be verging on a libellous depiction, as it \\"suggest[s] that the community critical of the PhD may physically attack the examiners\\". =Remonstrations= In response to UOW and Wilyman's thesis an online petition called Stop the University of Wollongong's Spread of Disease and Death Via Anti-Vaccination PhD was established in January 2016 and attracted over 2,100 signatures within the first few weeks. The petition reportedly states that UOW's acceptance of the thesis \\"demonstrates an anti- scientific culture at the University of Wollongong that is inimical to scholarship\\". At the same time over sixty of the university's health and medical academics and researchers jointly signed a statement that \\"the evidence is clear\\" in support of vaccination urging all parents to ensure their children are fully immunised, Public Health Association of Australia president Heather Yeatman said the 65 academics wanted to clarify the scientific position and point out they are firmly behind vaccination and that \\"Universities need to publish papers based on sound evidence and the balance of evidence in relation to any matter\\". A week later, representatives from 12 medical research and clinical societies also signed a supporting statement on behalf of 5,000 scientists and clinicians in the fields of microbiology, virology, immunology and infectious diseases concerned about vaccine- preventable diseases in the community. Eminent research biologist Sir Gustav Nossal was one of signatories, and Jonathan Iredale who drafted the statement said \\"It’s not about academic freedom; it’s an academic issue. If the thesis comes from poor scholarship then that is something the university must deal with\\". In the Elsevier journal Vaccine three months later, UoW's executive dean of the Faculty of Science, Medicine and Health, researcher and toxicologist Alison Jones, co-authored a paper in-part referring to Wilyman, and in discussing the balance of good public health versus unchecked academic freedom stated: :\\"there is the very real potential for feral academic liberty and free speech to do harm ... this is particularly pertinent in the field of child health, where two recent controversial \\"scholarly\\" vaccine contributions ... could undermine community confidence in immunisation and immunisation uptake ... by suggesting scientific doubt where doubt is not warranted on the basis of the evidence available... [Wilyman has] repeated the discredited claims of a link between vaccines and autism, without providing compelling scientific evidence to support her claim\\". Martin responded to Durrheim and Jones, arguing that they had misrepresented parts of Wilyman's work. McIntyre, a senior doctor at the Westmead Children's Hospital, said that Wollongong University \\"must bear the major responsibility for manifestly inadequate supervision\\", saying: \\"It is clear from even cursory examination that Wilyman’s thesis, although raising some legitimate questions about gaps in both the process and transparency of immunisation policy development, is based on a highly selective and poorly informed review of the literature, driven by the imperative to support pre-determined conclusions.\\" =Peer review= The March 2019 issue of the journal Vaccine published an article titled \\"PhD thesis opposing immunisation: Failure of academic rigour with real-world consequences\\" that stated in its conclusion that Wilyman's \\"thesis is notable for its lack of evidence of systematic literature review. Despite its extensive claims, there is no primary research, but there is abundant evidence of strong bias in selecting the literature cited and sometimes outright misrepresentation of facts.\\" The authors also criticised Wilyman's use of her PhD to position herself as an expert witness in a family law court case over immunisation. After graduation Within two months of University of Wollongong publishing the thesis it was reported that Wilyman was claiming her \\"PhD provides evidence that all vaccines are not safe and effective and that the combined schedule of vaccines is doing more harm than good in the population through the increase in chronic illness\\". In June 2016 The Australian reported that Wilyman was an audience member at a vaccination forum run by the Telethon Kids Research Institute in Perth. Anti-vaccination activists at the event accused the forum members of lying, and heckled, interjected and continuously interrupted the speakers, forcing the event to close early. Wilyman wrote an open letter to Paul Wellings, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Wollongong asking the university to correct alleged inaccuracies in the Wikipedia article about her research, asserting that criticism of her thesis in the media and by individual scientists was not \\"a proper scientific debate (but) suppression of the literature using political strategies\\". She also criticised Alison Jones, a Wollongong academic, for using the university's website to publicise \\"personal opinions of vaccination\\". The university responded by saying that they do not endorse or otherwise the views of students or academic staff, and do not curate Wikipedia. Wilyman, Martin and the Faculty were awarded the satirical Australian Skeptics 2016 Bent Spoon Award for \\"a PhD thesis riddled with errors, misstatements, poor and unsupported 'evidence' and conspiratorial thinking\\". During the COVID-19 pandemic, Wilyman questioned whether there really was a pandemic saying \\"do not lock down a healthy population under the guidelines of 'social distancing' for a global pandemic when there is no evidence of that pandemic\\", and challenged health advice by saying \\"that if you accept this social distancing and banning of gatherings of more than two people, [which] is clearly about population control and not the control of this infectious disease outbreak… then you are accepting the new norm and you've already lost your freedom\\". Masters thesis investigation Wilyman was previously investigated and cleared by the university after allegations relating to her 2007 Masters thesis. After investigating the allegations and clearing Wilyman in 2015, the university declined to publicly release details, but under a Freedom of Information request a small number of documents were released after the Information & Privacy Commission of NSW intervened. In March 2016 there was a further release of hundreds of heavily redacted pages relating to the investigation, after the initial response was appealed. In what text was left unredacted, it showed that the complaint was referred to a high-level conduct committee, which dismissed the complaint after a two-month investigation and took no further action. The documents revealed that Judy Raper, the university's Deputy Vice Chancellor of Research, wrote to Wilyman after the investigation saying that it should not have occurred, that she was \\"sincerely sorry for this to have happened\\", and that \\"academic misconduct processes are not a forum for academic debate\\". Political career Wilyman ran in the 2019 Australian federal election as a candidate for the Western Australia senate as a member of the anti-vaccination/anti-fluoridation, Involuntary Medication Objectors (Vaccination/Fluoride) Party. She was not successful.  References  Further reading  * Public health and the necessary limits of academic freedom? - D.N. Durrheim, University of Newcastle; A.L.

The library has branches around the town and in nearby villages. The current library is located in a historical building in Plungė park.  History = Zubov's era = After 3rd partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which occurred in 1795, Catherine II, the ruler of the Russian Empire, for loyalty to the tsar's throne and zealous service, offered 170,000 acres of land to Platon Zubov (1767–1822), who was one of the initiators of the Two Nations partition. In 1806 Count Platon Zubov bought the Plungė estate with the surrounding buildings from Vikentij Potocki. Thus, the period of Zubovai ruling in Plungė began, and it lasted 67 years (1806–1873). The documents, recorded memories, stories and legends of this period have remained up to now. Platon Zubov ruled Plungė until his death in 1822. The only legitimate heir to Platon Zubov, daughter Alexandra (1822–1824), who was born after his death, died at the age of just 2. Platon's relatives did not agree that a large inheritance of the Count would accrue only to his wife. Accordingly, the assets were distributed among Platon Zubov's brothers and their children. In the absence of historical sources, it is very difficult to figure out who in Zubov's family inherited Plungė's estates after the death of Platon. Well-known documents of the archives are sparse, and the secondary sources contradictory. So far it has remained unclear whether all Plungė possessions inherited from Platon went to one heir, or whether they were distributed among a few family representatives. In the Zubovai family genealogical tree diagram there are two possible versions of ruling Plungė possessions after the death of Platon Zubov, i. e. during the period from 1822 until 1873 when his brother Alexander's son Platon Alexandrovich Zubov (1835–1890) sold the Plungė estate to Duke Mykolas Oginskis (Michael Oginski). One of the genealogical tree branches belongs to Platon Zubov's brother Nicholas (1763–1805), who in 1822 was already dead. Thus, the Plungė estate lands might have been inherited by his son (Platon's nephew) Alexander (1797–1875), and later – the latter's son Platon Alexandrovich (1835–1890). Another branch shows that after the death of Platon Zubov, Plungė possessions could have been accrued to his brother Dimitri (1764–1836), and then – to Dimitri's son Nicholas (1801–1871). = Castle tower = In the 19th century the ruling period of Counts Zubovai was very important for Lithuania. Many representational and ceremonial buildings were constructed, roads were repaired, business was flourishing and educational and cultural institutions were established. Apparently, the Zubovai family who had many lands in other places of Lithuania was not residing in Plungė. They used to come here on business and built several buildings. A belfry of the church, All Saints Chapel in the old cemetery of Plungė, Italian-style Romantic Neo- Gothic style castle villa-conservatory in Plungė Park built by Zubovai have remained until today. The castle stands in the southern part of the park, about 300 metres away from the central palace. It was built in the middle of the 19th century during the Romantic Period when in the whole of Europe there was a tendency to follow the Middle Ages. It has a tower of 12 m in height, with a clock visible from all four sides. The clock has a very rare and unique anchor mechanism created by Parisian clockmaker Ž. L. Amant in 1741. Because of this clock, earlier the townspeople called it “dziegorinė”, later on and now – “laikrodine” (“clock tower”). On the south side of the clock's foundations there is a record with the date – 1846. It is the oldest still extant building of the Plungė estate and the oldest known stone building in the whole of Plungė. This date indicates that the castle clock tower was built during the period of Zubovai ruling. According to the archaeological research, it was found that the castle was built on top of the foundations of another much older representative building in the 17th century, a large, five-room, “U” shaped manor ensemble. In the middle of the 19th century next to the castle clock tower a greenhouse was built. Archaeologists have found that the northern and eastern stone walls of the former 17th century building were used for building the northern walls of the castle and greenhouse, and also for building the eastern wall of the conservatory's stove; the foundation of the old building middle wall was used to build the southern walls of the castle and conservatory. The castle clock tower is similar to the Palazzo Vecchio palace in Florence. It's like a small copy of this palace. The construction of the Palazzo Vecchio palace, by the Italian architect Arnolfo di Cambio (1245–1302), began in 1299. Documents still have not revealed why the castle of such construction was built in Plungė, and which member of the Zubov family had decided to build it. However, memories of the Zubov family representatives were recorded. Vladimir Zubov (1909–2007) wrote that Nicholas Dimitrijevic Zubov (1801–1871) had built a small Italian-style castle for his wife Alexandra de Raymond de Mormoiron (1807– 1839), who came from Marquis de Modena family and was born in Petersburg. Her father was Frenchman Gabriel (1774–1833), who was born in Paris and worked as an oberger master. In 1873 Duke Mykolas Oginskis bought the Plungė estate with a nice castle clock tower in the park from Count Platon Alexandrovich Zubov. Oginskis used the castle of Zubovai as a gardener's office and greenhouse. On the ground floor there lived a gardener, and on the first floor – a clockmaker. Therefore, during the period of Oginskiai ruling the castle was sometimes referred to as a gardener's house or greenhouse. The clock tower via a balcony was attached to another smaller building, next to which there was an extension – summer greenhouse – a large room separated with a glass wall. Flowers and vegetables grew in a close. Exotic plants used to be grown there: palms, grapes, pineapples. = War and postwar periods = During the interwar period, the Second World War and post-war years. the building was primarily used as accommodation. The remains of the conservatory were being gradually turned into greenhouses. At this time the castle tower's clock had already stopped working. During the Soviet Union period, the Young Pioneers organization was established in the castle. When Lithuania regained its independence the facilities were closed and abandoned, leading to believe that this unique building was doomed to collapse. It was only until the proposal of a new site for Plungė Municipal Library that the clock tower castle was on the right path to serve a new purpose for the community. Various campaigns were held in order to make the dream come true. In 2011 the castle tower's clock was restored by metal restorer Tadeušas Kvakšys. In October 2012 restoration and reconstruction work in the castle clock tower was finished, and Plungė District Municipal Public Library moved to the new building.  Branch libraries  Currently Plungė District Municipal Public Library has branches in the following locations: *  European Voluntary Service  Plungė library has been actively participating in programs such as: Erasmus+ and National volunteering. Volunteers make a remarkable contribution to the Library and they perfectly proceed their given tasks: * Meeting and greeting library customers; * Helping and preparing various events within the library; * Learning Lithuanian language; * Meeting with non-governmental organizations; * Gaining knowledge and awareness about history (culture, heritage) of Plungė region. * Self-realization and many other creative tasks if they like.

While the phenomenon has been known for ages, the term is relatively new: it was introduced within the field of literary and cultural studies by Susan Arndt, Dirk Naguschewski and Robert Stockhammer in 2007. Some exophonic authors may be bilingual or multilingual from their childhood years, even polyglots, while others may write in an acquired language. In some cases the second language is acquired early in life, for example through immigration, and it is not always clear whether the writer should strictly be classed a non-native speaker. In other cases, the language is acquired through exile or migration: \\"Exophonic writing, the phenomenon of writing literature in a second language, is increasing across Europe due to labour migration\\". It is one form of transnational literature, although the latter also encompasses writing that crosses national stylistic or cultural boundaries without being written in another language. \\"Extraterritoriality and exophony are indeed important notions, not only for comparative literature but in general for the question of the status of the literary text [of] the 21st century\\". It also overlaps with translingualism, and translingualist writer is one of many terms that has been coined to describe the phenomenon. Related concepts in English include transculturalism/transculturation, axial writing, postnationalism and postcolonialism, and in German, Exophonie, Anders- Sprachigkeit, Interkulturelle Literatur ('intercultural literature'), Gastarbeiterliteratur ('guest worker literature'), Ausländerliteratur ('foreigner literature') and Migrantenliteratur ('migrant literature'). Motivations for becoming an exophonic writer may be manifold: to make a political statement (for example, Yoko Tawada attempted \\"to produce exophony both in her mother tongue (Japanese) and her acquired tongue (German) ... to dismantle ... the ultranationalistic concept of a 'beautiful' Japanese language\\"), to adopt/avoid stylistic elements of particular languages (\\"for Tawada, a native speaker of a language whose grammar makes no distinctions of gender, case, definite and indefinite articles, or singular and plural ... each Western word, phrase or idiom becomes a conundrum\\", \\"I grope for some unlikely expression in my native language, trying to find the proper equivalence in translation for an English word or phrase\\"), to evade the risk of being lost in translation, or to gain a wider readership – translated literature in the UK and US accounts for only a small percentage of sales, so \\"it makes commercial sense\\". When asked why he didn’t write in his native language, Joseph Conrad replied, \\"I value too much our beautiful Polish literature to introduce into it my worthless twaddle. But for Englishmen my capacities are just sufficient.\\" Some exophonic authors are also translators, including (in some cases) of their own works. Conversely, translation of exophonic works can present problems due to the \\"defamiliarisation of the new language through stylistic innovation\\".

It was made into a film in 1999, and an English translation by Okinawan professor Takuma Sminkey was published by Ozaru Books in 2011. Plot and Themes The main protagonist, 'Boku', is a foreign student in Japan, who wishes to blend in with insular Kyoto society but finds himself rejected as a gaijin (outsider). Frustrated, he volunteers to read books to the blind - partly to assist his own studies of Japanese literature - and finds acceptance with the young, beautiful Kyoko. She soon tests his mettle by choosing erotic works, and eventually a love affair develops. This is however challenged by cultural misunderstandings and prejudice on both sides. Similar to Elizabeth Katayama (Elizabeth Kata)'s novel Be Ready with Bells and Drums, which was made into the award-winning film A Patch of Blue, the story deals with themes of how perceived handicaps and prejudice can counteract each other and resolve feelings of isolation or alienation, specifically in the example of being 'blind to colour'. The setting also resembles The Reader (Der Vorleser) by Bernhard Schlink (made into a 2008 film, as well as Raymond Jean's novella 'La lectrice' (translated as 'Reader for Hire' and made into a 1988 film, as all cover the little-known area of reading to the visually impaired. Reception The Japan Times called Ichigensan “a beautiful love story”. Asahi Evening News described it as “Sophisticated [...] subtle [...] sensuous [...] delicate [...] memorable [...] vivid depictions”, while Japan PEN Club called it “Striking […] fascinating” and Kyoto Shimbun expressed the style as “Refined and sensual”. The New York Times praised the \\"flawless Japanese\\" and said the \\"insights into Japanese relationships are unnervingly perceptive, [the] story as elegantly simple as a haiku\\".

So Kumar informs this to his family and Kumar asks them to hit anybody in the form of ghost. The monk who realizes, that when the moon's light touches the box, the ghost inside it will get released. The monk sends a disciple to get that box, but Kumar's father and Mohan mistake him for an intruder and knock him out. Eventually, the moon's light touches the box and the ghost inside get released.

The venture was later postponed to allow Santhanam to finish work on Muruganand's Inimey Ippadithan (2015) first. In early 2015, Rambala then announced that he would make the film with Shiva and Nandita, but the project did not develop. Following the release of Inimey Ippadithaan, Santhanam began pre-production on his work with Rambala during July 2015 and sported a new look for the project. The film began production in November 2015, with newcomer Shanaya and Hindi film actor Saurabh Shukla revealed to be a part of the cast. Prior to the release of the film, the producer of the proposed venture starring Shiva came forward and submitted an application to court stating that Rambala had made Dhilluku Dhuddu from the script of the film he had earlier approved. Sarbudeen of Paper Flight Pictures argued that Rambala had unceremoniously left the project and sought to stop Dhilluku Dhuddu release, which he failed to do.

First years His father, René Allard, was a merchant and a public figure in Craon: he is convened in 1770 by the Présidial Councillor, as well as master Jacques-René Chassebœuf (father of Volney), lawyer at Craon and former administrator of the hospital, to deliberate on the reforms to the mismanagement of the Hôtel-Dieu de Craon. René Allard married Marthe-Marie Gousset on May 10, 1734 and she gave him a son who received the names of Louis François. He became medical doctor in the University of Angers, on November 19, 1754.

His last political office was clerk of the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which he held from 1860 to 1866, when he retired from public life. He died in 1881 and was buried in Lexington Cemetery. Early life Leslie Combs was born November 28, 1793, in Clark County, Kentucky.Kleber, p. 219 He was the youngest of twelve children born to Benjamin Combs, an officer in the Revolutionary War, and Sarah (Richardson) Combs, a Quaker from Maryland.Emch, p. 32 His early education was obtained in a private school operated by Reverend John Lyle. Later, he became a deputy clerk in the office of S. H. Woodson, a lawyer from Jessamine County. At the outbreak of the War of 1812, Combs enlisted in the 1st Regiment Kentucky Volunteers under William Henry Harrison, but was soon transferred to the command of Green Clay. By April 1813, he was promoted to Captain over a scouting unit. On the evening of May 1, 1813, Combs and a detachment of six men were dispatched by Colonel William Dudley from Fort Defiance to the besieged Fort Meigs. As they canoed down the Maumee River, they were ambushed by Potawatomi, and two of Combs' men were killed.Emch, p. 34 He quickly returned to General Green Clay at Fort Defiance to report that Fort Meigs was under siege and in need of aid. After two days, he arrived back at Fort Defiance to find Clay already preparing to march to Fort Meigs.Emch, p. 40 Badly injured, he was ordered to bed by medical personnel, but upon finding two small companies of spies ready to operate under his command, he secured new clothes and joined Clay's march.Emch, p. 41 He was wounded and captured by the enemy on May 5, 1813. After his parole, Combs discontinued his military service and relocated to Lexington, Kentucky, where he read law with Samuel Q. Richardson. In 1818, he was admitted to the bar. He married Margaret Trotter on September 1, 1818, and the couple had eleven children. Legal and legislative career In 1827, Combs was elected as a Whig to the Kentucky House of Representatives, serving until 1829. In 1830, he was one of twenty incorporators of the Lexington and Ohio Railroad. He was once again elected to the state House of Representatives in 1833 and was appointed to the Committee on Internal Improvements. Responding to Stephen F. Austin's call for assistance against Mexico in 1836, Combs raised a volunteer regiment, but it was disbanded by President Andrew Jackson before being deployed. As a delegate to the Whig National Convention in 1840, Combs worked to nominate Henry Clay for the presidency, but when Clay failed to secure the nomination, he campaigned for the party's eventual nominee, William Henry Harrison. He was elected for a third time to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1845 and served as Speaker of the House in 1846. In 1846, Combs raised a regiment to participate in the Mexican–American War, but he resigned after not being selected to command it. His first wife having died, Combs married Mary Elizabeth (Brownell) Man, daughter of Episcopal Bishop Thomas Church Brownell, on April 11, 1849. They had three children.His eldest son was the Hon. Leslie Combs, Lexington horse breeder and diplomat. He was Minister to Guatemala, Honduras and Peru under the administration of President Theodore Roosevelt. After losing his campaign for an open seat in the U.S. House of Representatives to Democrat John C. Breckinridge, Combs was again elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1855. That year, he also became president of the Lexington and Danville Railroad. His legislative term ended in 1859, and he was elected clerk of the Kentucky Court of Appeals in 1860. Combs was a strong Unionist during the American Civil War. Death Combs did not seek reelection as clerk in 1866 and retired from public life. He died at home in Lexington on August 22, 1881, and was buried in Lexington Cemetery.

It is a rhizomatous perennial, from central Anatolia, in Turkey. It has small, thin grey-green leaves, a short stem with 1–3 branches, which are normally, covered with a green leaf with purple staining. It has 2 or more fragrant flowers in late spring (normally between May and June), which come in shades of yellow or purple, or violet and yellow, (from greenish yellow, mid-yellow, yellow, white, off-white to yellow/brown bi-tones). It has a yellow or white with yellow-tips beard. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions, but prefers regions with dry, hot summers. Description Similar in form to Iris attica, or Iris imbricata.Basak Gardner & Chris Gardner It may also be related to Iris taochia but it is smaller, with different leaves. It has nodular, fibrous and well branched rhizomes.British Iris Society (1997) That creep across the soil to create small clumps of plants. It has small, thin leaves, with are narrow. The herbaceous, or semi-herbaceous leaves, are grey-green, glaucous, and can grow up to long, and between 1.5 cm wide. They are ensiform (sword shaped), crescent-shaped, or lanceolate (lance-shaped). They have parallel venation. It has a short stem or peduncle, that can grow up to between tall. It has 1–3 short branches, which can be hidden by the bracts. The stem has a short, semi- sheathing leaf, and 1 stem leaf, the branches have partially inflated spathes (leaves of the flower bud), which are long, and generally green with purple staining. They are transparent or membranous on the edges. The stems (and the 3 branches) hold several flowers, between 1 and 3, but normally 2 or more. In spring, in April, or between May and June. The flowers normally open in a sequence. The large flowers, are in diameter, come in shades of yellow or purple, or violet and yellow. Including greenish yellow, mid-yellow, yellow, white, off-white and yellow/brown bi-tones. The fragranced flowers, are similar in form to Iris germanica flowers. Like other irises, Iris schachtii has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The dark veined, or brown veined, falls are obovate or obtuse shaped, up to long and 2.5 cm wide. In the middle of the falls, is a row of short hairs called the 'beard', which is yellow, or white with yellow-tips. It often is similar to the petal colour. It has broadly elliptic-obtuse shaped standards, that narrow abruptly, they are similar in shape to nautilus shells. It has a broad, smooth and 1.5 cm long ovary and a perianth tube that is 1.5–3 cm long. After the iris has flowered, it produces a seed capsule that has not been described. =Biochemistry= In 1989, a karyological study was carried out on 4 iris species in Turkey; including Iris junonia Schott et Kotschy ex Schott, Iris purpureobractea B. Matthew et T.Baytop, Iris taochia Woronow ex Grossh., and Iris schachtii. It found the chromosome counts of the iris species. The chromosome count of 2n=48. In 2014, a new technique of in vitro plant tissue culture was carried out on Iris sari and Iris schachtii. As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings, but Iris schachtii is a tetraploid, with a count of 2n=48, by Koca, 1989. Taxonomy It is commonly known as 'prairie iris' in Turkey. The Latin specific epithet of schachtii refers to Wilhelm Schacht (1903–2001), alpine gardener and plant collector for the Botanischer Garten München-Nymphenburg.F. Markgraf. in Die Gartenbauwissenschaft. 1957. Volume 22.pages 550–551.obituary. in Berichte der Bayerischen Botanischen Gesellschaft zur Erforschung der heimischen Flora. Munich. volume 71. pages 173–175. It was first published and described by Friedrich Markgraf in 'Gartenbauwissenschaft' (Gartenbauw) in Vol.22 on page 550 in 1957. It was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, then updated on 3 December 2004. It is listed in the Encyclopedia of Life. Iris schachtii is an accepted name by the RHS and was last listed in the RHS Plant Finder in 2014. Distribution and habitat It is native to temperate Asia. =Range= It is an endemic of Turkey. Found in central Anatolia, from the plateau east of Ankara, and between Kayseri and Malatya, of Turkey. Including being found near Salt Lake. One source mentions the range goes as far as the Balkans. =Habitat= It grows on the dry, rocky hillside, slopes, open steppes, or mixed forests. In limestone or chalky soils, in full sun. They can be found at an altitude of above sea level. Synecology On the steppes near Ankara, it grows with Beypazari milkvetch (Astragalus beypazaricus), dark blue bottle (Centaurea depressa), and steppe thyme (Thymus sipyleus). Conservation Iris sari and Iris schachtii are assessed as 'least concern' (LC) within in the Red Data Book of Turkish Plants, due to the widespread population. Although, this assessment could be changed due to the amount of plants being collected from the wild, for ornamental plants. IUCN Status: Unassessed Cultivation Like the other species from Turkey Ii. junonia and purpureobractea, this is a relative newcomer to cultivation. It is hardy, standing temperatures down to −20oC. It prefers to grow in well drained, limestone soils, in full sun. Preferring dry, hot summers. It can be grown in a rock garden, alpine garden or trough. In the UK, it is best grown in bulb frame. =Propagation= Irises can generally be propagated by division, or by seed growing. =Hybrids and cultivars= No known hybrids are found, but it has the potential to create fertile offspring when crossed with Iris pumila and regelia section irises. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), and if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Handling the plant may cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske ReferencesSources * Davis, P. H., ed.

Very few people lived near the halt, which served nearby Walkmill Colliery and coke ovens in Cumbria, England. The halt consisted of one single wooden platform by the southbound track a short distance south of the junction itself. Northbound trains calling at the halt had to cross to the \\"wrong line\\" and reverse or recross when they had dropped and picked up their passengers. The halt was unstaffed and had no facilities whatsoever. Publications both official and authoritative variously referred to the halt as Moresby Junction Halt, Moresby Junction Platform, Moresby Junction and Walkmill Colliery. The halt only ever had one purpose - to bring workers to and from the remote colliery. It appeared in public timetables in 1910 then again from 1913 to 1923, but only northbound, other northbound calls and all southbound calls were made by unadvertised workmen's services. Further research is needed to establish exactly when services to the halt ended, the closest available from authoritative sources is \\"by 1952\\". History The line was one of the fruits of the rapid industrialisation of West Cumberland in the second half of the nineteenth century, being specifically born as a reaction to oligopolistic behaviour by the London and North Western and Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railways. The halt opened to passengers in July 1910 on the company's main line from to . All lines in the area were primarily aimed at mineral traffic, notably iron ore, coal and limestone, none more so than the C&WJR;'s line to Workington, which earned the local name \\"The Track of the Ironmasters\\". General goods and passenger services were provided, but were very small beer compared with mineral traffic. The founding Act of Parliament of June 1878 confirmed the company's agreement with the Furness Railway that the latter would operate the line for one third of the receipts. Services Passenger trains consisted of antiquated Furness stock hauled largely by elderly Furness engines referred to as \\"rolling ruins\\" by one author after a footplate ride in 1949. No Sunday passenger service was ever provided on the line. The initial passenger service in 1879 consisted of *two Up (northbound) trains a day, leaving at 09:20 and 13:45, calling at Cleator Moor, , , and terminating at Workington, taking 30 minutes in all. *they returned as Down trains, leaving Workington at 10:30 and 16:00 In 1880 the extension northwards to was opened. The service was extended to run to and from Siddick and an extra train was added, with * three up trains a day, leaving Moor Row at 07:40, 10:12 and 14:45, taking 30 minutes to Workington and an extra four to proceed to Siddick, where connections were made with the MCR. * Down trains left Siddick at 08:45, 12:22 and 17:00 By 1922 the service reached its high water mark, with: * five up trains a day from Moor Row through to Siddick, leaving Moor Row at 07:20, 09:50, 13:15, 16:50 and 1820. * one train Mondays to Fridays Only from Moor Row to Workington, leaving at 13:45 and also calling at , making that halt qualify as a publicly advertised passenger station * one Saturdays Only train leaving Cleator Moor (NB not from Moor Row) at 12:50 for Workington * one Saturdays Only train leaving Moor Row at 19:35 for Workington There was one fewer Down train, as the 09:50 Up was provided to give a connection at Siddick with a fast MCR train to with connections beyond. Although not serving Cleator Moor, two Saturdays Only trains left at 16:05 and 21:35 for Workington, calling at Distington and High Harrington, with balancing workings leaving Workington at 15:30 and 21:00. There were also trains using the Lowca Light Railway plying between and Workington, but they served no \\"pure\\" C&WJR; stations other than Workington Central. As with advertised passenger trains, in 1920 workmen's trains ran on the company's three southern routes: * between Workington Central and Lowca using the Lowca Light Railway * between (Rowrah's \\"other station\\") and on the single track \\"Baird's Line\\", and * on the \\"main line\\" between Siddick Junction and Moor Row ** from Siddick Junction to Moor Row, calling at all passenger stations except , calling at instead ** from Moor Row to , calling at Cleator Moor and The situation in 1922 was similar. The 1920 Working Time Table shows relatively few Goods trains, with just one a day in each direction booked to call at Cleator Moor West. Mineral traffic was an altogether different matter, dwarfing all other traffic in volume, receipts and profits. The key source summarises it \\"...the 'Track of the Ironmasters' ran like a main traffic artery through an area honeycombed with mines, quarries and ironworks.\\" The associated drama was all the greater because all the company's lines abounded with steep inclines and sharp curves, frequently requiring banking. The saving grace was that south of Workington at least, most gradients favoured loaded trains. During the First World War especially, the company ran \\"Double Trains\\", akin to North American practice, with two mineral trains coupled together and a banking engine behind, i.e. locomotive-wagons-guards van- locomotive-wagons-guards van-banker. Such trains worked regularly between and , passing the halt as they did so, going full tilt up the 1 in 70 northbound. The practice was discontinued after dark from 1 April 1918. The workings at Moresby Junction exemplified the line's role, carrying coke and coal from a remote site to industries near and far. Like any business tied to one or few industries, the railway was at the mercy of trade fluctuations and technological change. The Cumberland iron industry led the charge in the nineteenth century, but became less and less competitive as time passed and local ore became worked out and harder to win, taking the fortunes of the railway with it. The peak year was 1909, when 1,644,514 tons of freight were handled. Ominously for the line, that tonnage was down to just over 800,000 by 1922, bringing receipts of £83,349, compared with passenger fares totalling £6,570. Rundown and closure The high water mark for the line's tonnage was 1909, the high water mark for progress was 1913, with the opening of the Harrington and Lowca line for passenger traffic. A chronology of the line's affairs from 1876 to 1992 has almost no entries before 1914 which fail to include \\"opened\\" or \\"commenced\\". After 1918 the position was reversed, when the litany of step-by-step closures and withdrawals was relieved only by a control cabin and a signalbox being erected in 1919 and the Admiralty saving the northern extension in 1937 by establishing an armaments depot at Broughton. The halt had closed by 1952. The line past the site of the platform closed in 1963 and was subsequently lifted. Afterlife By 2013 the site of junction next to site of the halt was readily visible on satellite imagery.

Morris developed Cleveland Public Library's first Negro History Week and was New York Public Library's first children's specialist for visually-impaired patrons. She was the first coordinator of children's services at San Francisco Public Library, where she was also the first African American to hold an administrative position. An active leader in advocacy organizations, Morris served as president of the Public Library Association—the first woman and first African American person to do so. Morris also served on the committees for prominent children's book awards, including the Caldecott Medal, Newbery Medal, and Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal (now known as the Children's Literature Legacy Award). Morris wrote the original selection criteria for the Coretta Scott King Award to become an official award for the American Library Association (ALA) in 1982. Morris received many distinguished awards during her lifetime and posthumously. The ALA conferred their highest honor, honorary membership, on Morris in 2008. In 2017, she was inducted posthumously into the California Library Association's Hall of Fame.  Education and personal life  Morris grew up in segregated Richmond, Virginia. At the age of eight, she moved with her family to Cleveland, Ohio, where her father was head chef with the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad Company. Morris and her sister were one of only a few students of color at their elementary school in Cleveland. Reading was a part of Morris’s life from an early age. After discovering her local Mount Pleasant branch of the Cleveland Public Library, she delighted in playing librarian by organizing her books on the front porch. Morris was valedictorian at John Adams High School and won a scholarship to the University of Chicago, where she studied for three years. She returned home to Cleveland after her father fell ill and finished her undergraduate career at Western Reserve University (now called Case Western Reserve University), from which she received two bachelor’s degrees: one in Social Sciences, and another in Library Science. She studied under Harriet Long, who specialized in training children's librarians. Morris returned to Case Western for graduate school, earning her Master of Science in Library Science in 1956. Her thesis was titled “A Mid-Century Survey of the Presentation of the American Negro in Literature for Children Published in the United States between 1700 and 1950.” Morris married Leonard Virgil Jones in Honolulu, Hawai’i on August 25, 1971. At the time of their marriage, Jones was Assistant Vice President of Fidelity Savings and Loan Association. A graduate of University of California, Berkeley, Jones played football for coach Pappy Waldorf. Jones remained active at Berkeley, serving as a trustee of the Cal Athletic Foundation and a director of the Cal Alumni Association. Morris always wore a pendant of an owl, which was her personal symbol of excellence and a reference to The Three Owls column written by New York Public Library children’s librarian Anne Carroll Moore. The column was the first series of children’s book reviews to be published by the New York Herald Tribune. Moore’s three owls represent the author, illustrator, and critic; Moore’s fourth owl represents the reader.  Career = Cleveland Public Library (1945-1955) = Morris’s library career began during college at the Cleveland Public Library, where she worked in a branch serving a majority African American community. She focused on literacy for African American children and children in low-income urban areas. She established the library’s first Negro History Week celebration for children, for which she developed the programming and suggested reading list. = New York Public Library (1955-1963) = In 1955, New York Public Library recruited Morris away from Cleveland. She worked in The Bronx and became the library’s first children’s specialist for visually-impaired patrons. The coordinator of children’s services, Francis Landis Spane, allocated grant money for Morris to find materials for visually-impaired children. Morris was the only librarian in the country working with blind children and advocated for new books to be written for this population. When blind children throughout the country wrote to her for books, Morris worked with the National Braille Association (then known as the National Braille Club) to secure new adaptations of children’s books. This included braille editions as well as multi-sensory adaptations using fabrics as illustrations. During her time in New York, Morris served as president of the National Braille Association and chair of the Library of Congress’s Committee for Book Selection for Blind Children. = San Francisco Public Library (1963-1977) = Morris moved from New York to San Francisco in 1963 to become the first children’s services coordinator at San Francisco Public Library. She was also the first African American to hold an administrative position at the library. By 1973, she was still only one of ten African American librarians working in the San Francisco Public Library system. In 1964, Morris established the library's Children's Historical and Research Collection, featuring out-of-print books for young people that depicted ethnic stereotypes, in order to highlight the changing portrayals of ethnic and minority groups. The collection was renamed in Morris’s honor in 1981. In 1969, Morris helped establish the library's first Negro History program, which included a visit by five African American authors and illustrators, including author Lorenz Graham. A consummate advocate for children, Morris once advised the library’s architects that the proposed railings in the children’s section were dangerous for children, as they had been set too wide. During her fourteen-year tenure, Morris wrote the library’s declaration of children’s rights, translated the library’s card application into five languages, established a city-wide summer reading program, and wrote booklists for the annual event. In 1975, Morris used a Library Services and Construction Act grant to establish “Dial-a-Story,” a 24-hour phone line where callers could listen to a three-minute recorded story for preschool-aged children.Oversight Hearings on Library Services and Construction Act: Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Postsecondary Education of the Committee of Education and Labor, House of Representatives, 97th Cong. 382-383 (1984) (Testimony of Effie Lee Morris). = Post-library career = After leaving San Francisco Public Library, Morris worked as a senior editor of urban education at Harcourt Brace Jovanovich from 1978 to 1979. After her retirement, she taught courses on children's literature the University of San Francisco, Mills College, Case-Western Reserve University, and Clark-Atlanta University. In 2004, Morris delivered the commencement address to graduates of the School of Library and Information Science at the University of California, Los Angeles.

It is also the location of two pre-historic archaeological sites. History Taire I (referred to as Et Taireh I) is located 3.5 km north of Ain Ebel to the west of the village. The exact location of the site is unknown and the assemblage found was small and of indeterminable date. It was only mentioned in passing by Paul Bovier- Lapierre in 1908 and Karge in 1918.Bovier-Lapierre, Paul. R., Stations préhistoriques du Belel Becharra (Hte Galilée).

It is located northeast of the village on a small track leading to Kounine that crosses the road between Bent Jbeil and Tibnine. A collection was made south of the track at 690 m above sea level by Jesuit archaeologist Henri Fleisch, who did not publish it but confirmed that the Qaraoun culture was present this far south via personal communication to Lorraine Copeland. The collection is held by the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory at the Saint Joseph University. =Ottoman era= In 1596, it was named as a village, Taira in the Ottoman nahiya (subdistrict) of Tibnin under the liwa' (district) of Safad, with a population of 29 households and 7 bachelors, all Muslim.

Other cut stones of similar appearance, and trunks of columns scattered about the village, belong apparently to the same monument. A great birkeh, partly cut in the rock and partly built of medium-sized regular stones, adjoins the houses. Broken sarcophagi are lying about: their lids have acroteria.\\"Guérin, 1880, p. 113 as given in Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 258 In 1881, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described it: \\"A small stone village, containing about eighty Metawileh, in narrow valley, with grapes, a few olives, and figs ; many cisterns in and round village ; on hill-side old masonry birket.”Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 203 \\"Many old and well-cut stones and broken fragments of a pillar were observed at this village, showing probably early Christian occupation.

It occurs from Ourimbah, Central Coast (New South Wales) at 33° S to Eungella National Park (20° S) in tropical Queensland. Other common names include corkwood, rose-leaf marara, brown alder and sugarbark. The generic placement of the species varies between sources, some preferring Ackama paniculosa. The habitat of Caldcluvia paniculosa includes riverine, littoral, tropical, subtropical and warm temperate rainforests. It is also found in the ecotone of eucalyptus and rainforests. The tree may be identified in the rainforest by the unusually soft corky bark.  Description  A medium to large sized tree with a buttressed base. Sometimes over 40 metres tall and in excess of 90 cm wide at the butt. The trunk is cylindrical with soft corky bark, greyish fawn in colour. The base of the tree is usually buttressed. Leaves form in groups of five to seven leaflets, sometimes in threes. Leaves are hairy, opposite and toothed, 5 to 12 cm long. Creamy white flowers form on compound panicles in November. The fruit is a red capsule, containing a few hairy oval flattened seeds, 1 mm long. The fruit matures from February to June.  Taxonomy  The species has a complex nomenclatural history. It was first described by Ferdinand von Mueller in 1860 under the name Weinmannia paniculata F.Muell. However, this combination had already been published in 1797 by Antonio José Cavanilles for a Chilean species. Realizing his error, Mueller in 1861 published the replacement name Weinmannia paniculosa F.Muell., which is the correct basionym (base name) for this species. When Heinrich Gustav Adolf Engler moved the species to the genus Ackama in 1891, he incorrectly used Mueller's earlier illegitimate name as the basis, calling the species Ackama paniculata Eng. In 1947, the combination Ackama paniculosa Beuzev. & C.T.White was put forward, but incorrectly, as there was no reference to Mueller's legitimate basionym. The species continued to be placed in Akama, but without a legitimate name. In 1979, when Ruurd Dirk Hoogland transferred all the species of Ackama to Caldcluvia, he correctly used the name Caldcluvia paniculosa (F.Muell.) Hoogland. In 2013, transfer back to Ackama was proposed, and a valid name in this genus, Ackama paniculosa (F.Muell.) Heslewood, was published for the first time by Margaret M. Heslewood and Peter G. Wilson. , The Plant List and the Australian Plant Census continue to place the species in the genus Caldcluvia.

He was the Ambassador for Foreign Trade in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in 2008. He is best known for his community ecological activism for the Belize River Valley Development Program (BELRIV). BELRIV is a community-based cultural and ecology project to promote sustainable development. He pioneered and developed the BELRIV 'OASIS' project. He graduated from the University of the West Indies, and Harvard. He was an excellent community organizer, international consultant, community environmental project coordinator, activist, humanist, Pan Africanist (Pan-Africanism), Internationalist, renaissance man, scholar, technocrat, writer, and poet. \\"A very passionate nationalist; very powerful sense of humor; a tremendous memory and just a very kind individual. He really was into education. He saw education as being vital for us\\". Early life Bert Tucker was privately schooled with Ms. Annette Maheia. He then went on to Belize Technical College, University of the West Indies, and Harvard University. He has well documented his experiences as a student at University of the West Indies in the 60s and 70s in the article Jamaican Vibrations - Rocking Steady to Reggae. This article articulates the early days of Reggae, University of West Indies student movement, the rise of Michael Manley, a peoples' mass movement, Abeng Movement, and the People's National Party. As Jamaica confronted injustices and poverty. The article is a poetic expression of Jamaican history during the 1960s, and Tucker's experience. He documents what was called the 'Rodney Riots', when Walter Rodney a professor of African history and a Black Power Movement advocate was banned from returning to his position as professor at the University of the West Indies (Mona campus). Career Bert Tucker received a master's degree in Economics from the University of the West Indies. He did post-graduate work in law and international relations at Harvard University. Tucker's lifelong work was for the advancement and development of the human race. He worked in many troubled spots across the world, especially in Africa and in the Caribbean. For three decades he worked for over fourteen countries. He acted as a consultant for Liberia, Namibia, Grenada, and Zimbabwe. He worked in Jamaica during the Michael Manley years. He worked for the United Nations in the 80s in sustainable development. He worked with Ghanaian President, Jerry Rawlings in the 1970s and 1980s. For many years Bert Tucker was a United Nations Advisor to several countries in the Caribbean and Africa. He graduated from the University of the West Indies, and Harvard. His lifelong work was for the advancement and development of the human race. He worked in many troubled spots across the world, especially in Africa and in the Caribbean. He was involved in the rebuilding of Jamaica during the Michael Manley era. The rebuilding of Grenada during the Maurice Bishop era New Jewel Movement ,and the rebuilding of Namibia during the era of (the Southwest Africa People's Organization), SWAPO. When Tucker worked with Grenada, Namibia and Jamaica these countries were in turmoil. He was an adviser and consultant for the Mandela Center in Belize. He was a visiting lecturer for universities in many countries in particular – in the United States of America, Africa and Latin America. Tucker was one of Belize's leading advocate and support for the work of Henry C. Fairweather. Mr. Fairweather was known as the \\"Mahogany Man\\". Mr. Fairweather's mission was to replant mahogany trees in Belize. Bert Tucker took on this cause and became known as \\"Mahogany Man', too. Mr. Fairweather was still planting mahogony trees into his 90s. He used his own money, and land to create a legacy; and to build a future for future generations. \\"Children and Trees Growing Together, A Future for Both', was the theme of the project between BELRIV and the mahogany plantation. Bert Tucker was the founder of the Isaiah Emmanuel Morter organization to honor the work and legacy of Isaiah Morter; a self-made man. Morter is reported as being Belize's first colored millionaire. Morter built his fortune on growing bananas and coconuts. He was a strong supporter of Marcus Garvey 's Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League. He once owned Cave Chapel. On May 18, 2014 at the Venezuela Embassy in Belmopan a tribute to honor the work and character of Bert Tucker was held. It was given by Yoel Pérez Marcano, Ambassador of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela to Belize. The Ambassador from Venezuela described Bert Tucker as \\"a visionary, revolutionist, and a man who dedicated his life to fight against colonialism\\". A hall in the Venezuela Embassy in Belmopan was dedicated to honor Bert Tucker. Mr. Vernon Cord, a lifelong friend of Bert Tucker spoke at the tribute off his character as \\"passion for change, progressive thinking and empowerment of the less fortunate\\". There has also been a street in Belmopan to honor Bert Tucker. The Commission for Reparation in Belize was started in 2013. It was initiated by Bert Tucker.National Convention on Initiative For Justice And Reparations held in Belmopan Quotes Bert would say, > \\"We must fight the right fight\\" The things that challenge us Is only pretend > For once a people become mobilized In righteousness there is no Force that > can stop them ....Do the research; we need to get the facts And then do the > interpretation Together as a people unified Engaged in prosperity.

Originally, the APC superfamily consisted of subfamilies under the transporter classification number (TC #) 2.A.3. This superfamily has since been expanded to include eighteen different families. The most recent families added include the PAAP (Putative Amino Acid Permease), LIVCS (Branched Chain Amino Acid:Cation Symporter), NRAMP (Natural Resistance-Associated Macrophage Protein), CstA (Carbon starvation A protein), KUP (K+ Uptake Permease), BenE (Benzoate:H+ Virginia Symporter), and AE (Anion Exchanger). Bioinformatic and phylogenetic analysis is used to continually expand currently existing families and superfamilies. Other constituents of the APC superfamily are the AAAP family (TC# 2.A.18), the HAAAP family (TC# 2.A.42) and the LCT family (TC# 2.A.43). Some of these proteins exhibit 11 TMSs. Eukaryotic members of this superfamily have been reviewed by Wipf et al. (2002) and Fischer et al. (1998). Families Currently recognized families within the APC Superfamily (with TC numbers in blue) include: *2.A.3 - The Amino Acid-Polyamine-Organocation (APC) Family *2.A.15 - The Betaine/Carnitine/Choline Transporter (BCCT) Family *2.A.18 - The Amino Acid/Auxin Permease (AAAP) Family *2.A.21 - The Solute:Sodium Symporter (SSS) Family *2.A.22 - The Neurotransmitter:Sodium Symporter (NSS) Family *2.A.25 - The Alanine or Glycine:Cation Symporter (AGCS) Family *2.A.26 - The Branched Chain Amino Acid:Cation Symporter (LIVCS) Family *2.A.30 - The Cation-Chloride Cotransporter (CCC) Family *2.A.31 - The Anion Exchanger (AE) Family *2.A.39 - The Nucleobase:Cation Symporter-1 (NCS1) Family *2.A.40 - The Nucleobase/Ascorbate Transporter (NAT) or Nucleobase:Cation Symporter-2 (NCS2) Family *2.A.42 - The Hydroxy/Aromatic Amino Acid Permease (HAAAP) Family *2.A.46 - The Benzoate:H+ Symporter (BenE) Family *2.A.53 - The Sulfate Permease (SulP) Family *2.A.55 - The Metal Ion (Mn2+-iron) Transporter (Nramp) Family *2.A.72 - The K+ Uptake Permease (KUP) Family *2.A.114 - The Putative Peptide Transporter Carbon Starvation CstA (CstA) Family *2.A.120 - The Putative Amino Acid Permease (PAAP) Family  APC proteins in humans  There are several APC proteins expressed in humans, and they are SLC proteins. There are 11 SLC families including APC proteins: SLC4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 23, 26, 32, 36, and 38. The atypical SLC TMEM104 is also clustered to the APC clan. Structure and function The topology of the well-characterized human Anion Exchanger 1 (AE1) conforms to a UraA-like topology of 14 TMSs (12 α-helical TMSs and 2 mixed coil/helical TMSs). All functionally characterized members of the APC superfamily use cation symport for substrate accumulation except for some members of the AE family which frequently use anion:anion exchange. All new entries contain the two 5 or 7 TMS repeat units characteristic of the APC superfamily, sometimes with extra TMSs at the ends likely the result of an addition prior to duplication. The CstA family contains the greatest variation in TMSs. New functionally characterized members transport amino acids, peptides, and inorganic anions or cations. Except for anions, these are typical substrates of established APC superfamily members. Active site TMSs are rich in glycyl residues in variable but conserved arrangements. In CadB of E. coli (2.A.3.2.2), amino acid residues involved in both uptake and excretion, or solely in excretion are located in the cytoplasmic loops and the cytoplasmic side of transmembrane segments, whereas residues involved in uptake are located in the periplasmic loops and the transmembrane segments. A hydrophilic cavity is proposed to be formed by the transmembrane segments II, III, IV, VI, VII, X, XI, and XII. Based on 3-D structures of APC superfamily members, Rudnick (2011) has proposed the pathway for transport and suggested a \\"rocking bundle\\" mechanism. The structure and function of the cadaverine- lysine antiporter, CadB (2.A.3.2.2), and the putrescine-ornithine antiporter, PotE (2.A.3.2.1), in E. coli have been evaluated using model structures based on the crystal structure of AdiC (2.A.3.2.5), an agmatine-arginine antiporter (). The central cavity of CadB, containing the substrate-binding site is wider than that of PotE, mirroring the different sizes of cadaverine and putrescine. The size of the central cavity of CadB and PotE is dependent on the angle of transmembrane helix 6 (TM6) against the periplasm. Tyr(73), Tyr(89), Tyr(90), Glu(204), Tyr(235), Asp(303), and Tyr(423) of CadB, and Cys(62), Trp(201), Glu(207), Trp(292), and Tyr(425) of PotE are strongly involved in the antiport activities. In addition, Trp(43), Tyr(57), Tyr(107), Tyr(366), and Tyr(368) of CadB are involved preferentially in cadaverine uptake at neutral pH, while only Tyr(90) of PotE is involved preferentially in putrescine uptake. The results indicated that the central cavity of CadB consists of TMs 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 10, and that of PotE consists of TMs 2, 3, 6, and 8. Several residues are necessary for recognition of cadaverine in the periplasm because the level of cadaverine is much lower than that of putrescine at neutral pH. The roughly barrel-shaped AdiC subunit of approx. 45 Å diameter consists of 12 transmembrane helices, TMS1 and TMS6 being interrupted by short non-helical stretches in the middle of their transmembrane spans. Biochemical analysis of homologues places the amino and carboxy termini on the intracellular side of the membrane. TM1–TM10 surround a large cavity exposed to the extracellular solution. These ten helices comprise two inverted structural repeats. TM1–TM5 of AdiC align well with TM6–TM10 turned 'upside down' around a pseudo-two-fold axis nearly parallel to the membrane plane. Thus, TMS1 pairs with TMS6, TMS2 with TMS7, etc. Helices TMS11 and TMS12, non-participants in this repeat, provide most of the 2,500 Å 2 homodimeric interface. AdiC mirrors the common fold observed unexpectedly in four phylogenetically unrelated families of Na+-coupled solute transporters: BCCT (2.A.15), NCS1 (2.A.39), SSS (2.A.21) and NSS (2.A.22). =Transport reactions= Transport reactions generally catalyzed by APC superfamily members include:  Solute:proton symport  > Solute (out) + nH+ (out) → Solute (in) + nH+ (in).  Solute:solute antiport  > Solute-1 (out) + Solute-2 (in) ⇌ Solute-1 (in) + Solute-2 (out). These reactions may differ for some family members.

Zheng was the chief conductor of the China National Opera House (CNOH) and she formed and conducted at the Xiamen Philharmonic Orchestra. She has also been a dean in the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing (CCOM).  Biography  Zheng was born in Yongding, Fujian. Zheng is of Hakka descent and felt that her family valued education. Zheng first studied at Jingling Women's University in Nanjing in 1947. Zheng took part in the Chinese Communist Revolution, where her job was to train a large song and dance troupe and conducting Chinese operas. She was working in Henan province. Later, Zheng studied at the CCOM in 1952. Her first conducting teacher was Nicolai Tumascheve, who taught chorus- conducting. In 1955, she was sent to a special course taught by Soviet conductors where she was the only woman in the class. She taught at the CCOM between 1956 and 1960. Zheng then studied opera conducting at the Moscow Conservatory between 1960 and 1963. In 1962, she was first Chinese conductor to conduct an opera in a foreign setting when she conducted \\"Tosca\\" at the Moscow National Theater. After Moscow, she returned to CCOM and taught until the Cultural Revolution interrupted her work. During the revolution, there \\"was no classical music in China\\". Zheng became the Principal Conductor at the CNOH in Beijing in 1977. She was involved in the \\"influential performances\\" of The God of Flowers, La Traviata, Carmen, Le Nozze di Figaro and Madam Butterfly. In the 1980s, she helped French conductor, Jean Perrison, make the first Chinese translation of Carmen when he visited Beijing. In 1993, she founded the first women' symphony orchestra in China, the Ai Yue Nu Philharmonic Orchestra, which has performed around the world. The group plays both Western and Chinese music. Zheng and the women's orchestra performed at the Fourth World Conference on Women. When Zheng retired from the China National Opera in 1997, she moved to Xiamen. In 1998, she started the Xiamen Philharmonic Orchestra (XPO), a non-State musical ensemble. The XPO has grown steadily under her leadership, gaining worldwide recognition. Zheng was a torchbearer in Xiamen for the 2008 Olympic Games. In 2011, she was honored with the Golden Melody Prize from the Chinese Musicians' Association. Zheng received the 2012 Chinese Cultural Figure title for her contribution to music education and conducting. She retired from the XPO in 2013. In 2014, she was honored by the CNOH with the title \\"Honorary Conductor for Life.\\" Zheng is an educator who works to help the public understand and appreciate the orchestra. She also teaches audiences about concert etiquette. She is the mother of Zheng Su, who is one of the few ethnomusicologists from China teaching in America, and she is a grandmother to Aimee Zheng.

The common and adaptable species occurs in a variety of habitat types at middle to high altitudes. It was for a time treated as a southern race of the African striped skink, T. striata. Description This skink is dark grey brown in colour with two golden brown stripes that run lengthwise on either side of the spine. The underside is dirty white or pale grey. Both sexes grow to a length of about 19 cm. Habits and biology They are diurnal and like to bask in the sun. Those in colder regions will spend a period in hibernation. They are ovoviviparous.

Lee Monument, often referred to simply as the Jackson and Lee Monument or Lee and Jackson Monument, was a double equestrian statue of Confederate generals Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee, formerly located on the west side of the Wyman Park Dell in Charles Village in Baltimore, Maryland, alongside a forested hill, similar to the topography of Chancellorsville, Virginia, where Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee met before the Battle of Chancellorsville in 1863. The statue was removed on August 16, 2017, on the order of Baltimore City Council, but the base still remains. The present location of the monument is unknown and some city council members have called for all Confederate monuments in the state to be destroyed. The area surrounding the old monument was rededicated as Harriet Tubman Grove in March 2018.https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore- city/bs-md-ci-harriet-tubman-grove-20180309-story.html Significance The Jackson and Lee Monument was the first double equestrian statue in the United States. Artist Laura Gardin Fraser was the only woman sculptor selected out of five other men to create the monument. Notable architect John Russell Pope was commissioned to design the base of the monument. Background Funding for the statue was secured by Colonial Trust Company owner J. Henry Ferguson before he died in 1928. Ferguson provided $100,000 for the erection of the monument. It was dedicated in 1948 in a ceremony at which Governor William Preston Lane Jr. and Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro Jr. spoke. The monument was located on the west side of the Wyman Park Dell along Art Museum Drive from its dedication until its removal by the Baltimore City Government. Removal The empty pedestal, two days after the statue's removal. After the 2015 Charleston church shooting, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake organized a commission to evaluate removal of the city's four confederate monuments. In January 2016, the commission decided that the Jackson and Lee Monument, along with William Henry Rhinehart's Roger B. Taney Sculpture in Mount Vernon Place would be removed. On August 15, 2017, the Baltimore City Council voted unanimously to deconstruct these monuments. The Jackson and Lee Statue was subsequently removed by Whiting Turner construction on August 16, 2017, but the base remains intact. Activists replaced the monument with a rendition of a pregnant African-American woman, created by artist Pablo Machioli, which was destroyed shortly thereafter. The pedestal was also repeatedly vandalized with politically motivated graffiti. Inscription The base of the sculpture featured the following inscription: ::SO GREAT IS MY CONFIDENCE IN / GENERAL LEE THAT I AM WILLING TO / FOLLOW HIM BLINDFOLDED / STRAIGHT AS THE NEEDLE TO THE POLE / JACKSON ADVANCED TO THE EXECUTION / OF MY PURPOSE ::(West steps:) THE PARTING OF GENERAL LEE AND / STONEWALL JACKSON ON THE EVE / OF CHANCELLORSVILLE ::(East steps:) GIFT OF J.

The film follows the pairings of prisoners and dogs from their first meeting through adoption into a loving family. The rehabilitation program is an initiative under Don't Throw Us Away, an nonprofit that rescues dogs from Southern Kill Shelters and partners them with prisoner inmates to prepare for potential adoption.  Synopsis  Dogs On The Inside explores the problem of abandoned dogs in the Southern United States, where shelters are overcrowded and euthanasia is common. After a devoted team of rescuers transports the dogs, they begin an 8- to 10-week program with prisoner inmates who supply the dogs with basic obedience skills as well as much needed attention. Following research in animal behavior and psychology by Marc Bekoff Ph.D., the program shows that connected by their troubled pasts, the dogs learn to have faith in people again while the inmates are reminded of their own humanity and capacity for love and empathy. Over the three-month period, the inmates find solace in the companionship with their dogs as well as a confidence in their own ability to affect positive change. One of the inmates, Candido Sanchez draws on his time with the dogs as inspiration for his own upcoming release. As the dogs graduate from the course, he sees the dogs move on to a loving home, which inspires him to transform his own life. Production  While shot over a three-month period, actual shooting took only three days. Brean Cunningham and Douglas Seirup directed, edited, shot, and produced the title over the course of three years. Also on production was Cindy Meehl. As for music, Sam Gay provided the score. Cunningham and Seirup co-found their own production company, Expect Miracles Productions.  Release  The film was released on VOD February 10, 2015 and on DVD February 24th, 2015.

The Dubois Brothers began their reputation for their criminal behaviour and their toughness throughout their teenage years. By the 1960s the Dubois Brothers were gaining control and were becoming the only crime group in Montreal that were considered to rival the Cotroni family in the 1960s and 1970s. The Dubois Brothers engaged in extortion, the exploitation of strippers and prostitutes, drug trafficking, loan sharking, and the murder of rival victims. A report by the Quebec Crime Commission called the gang \\"the most important criminal organization in Quebec,\\" so vicious and strong that they were known to be feared by both outlaw motorcycle gangs and the nearby Mafia.  Family background  The Dubois Brothers are nine of the ten sons of Napoleon Dubois also known as \\"Paulo\\" and Alice Tribodeau. The 10th son, Roger, never had any part of the organized crime group and lived a crime free life working a government job. The nine brothers consisted of: Raymond, Jean-Guy, Normand, Claude, Rene, Rolland, Jean-Paul, and the twins Maurice and Adrien. The Dubois Brothers came from Saint-Henri, a working-class neighbourhood in Montreal, which was bordered by rail yards and factories. Their father worked as a bartender at a local bar. The boys grew up in what they described as an \\"impoverished childhood\\" but were considered as being aggressive, strong and very close- knit, quickly realizing the strength in their unity. The Dubois Brothers had explained in an interview that in school they were mocked because of what they wore and many times had to skip meals or could only have molasses sandwiches. Their father, Napoleon 'Paulo' Dubois, died near the end of the Dubois Brothers reign in January 1976 of what was considered a natural death in an old folks home.  Brothers  Adrien Dubois Adrien Dubois was the second youngest brother of the 10 brothers. He was in general considered the strong man in the drug trade along with his brother Claude, although he was considered more low profile than some of his other brothers he was perceived as the smarter and more discreet operator, unlike some of his brothers who were the flexing type. After Adrien was charged and acquitted in a highly publicized case in 1983 he stayed generally clear of the spotlight and criminal charges. In his final years of his life he lived in a cottage north of Montreal in Saint Adele and presided over a company, which was registered as a real-estate firm. His family stated in his obituary that he had died away at the age of 68 and stated no cause of death although there was a request that any donations go to the Canadian Cancer Society. Claude Dubois Claude was known as the singing killer. Keep in mind that there was another Claude Dubois at the time whose career was purely musical. Claude was a nightclub singer in his spare time and was acknowledged as the singer of the Montreal organization. When he was young he started out by working as a door-man for the Mafia, which gave him a foot in the door of the criminal underworld as the Cotroni began to weaken it allowed him to expand his work into strip clubs and bars. He ran his empire very efficiently and would insure regular meetings to make sure he was on top of everything. Claude was very active in the downtown drug trafficking trade along with his brother Adrien. At the end of Claude's career he was sentenced to 25 years for the murder of Cotroni's brother-in-law in 1973. Jean-Guy Dubois He was one of the Dubois Brothers. He was convicted of murder after he dumped a bartender's body into the Lachine Canal in 1975. Jean-Guy had a son named Alain Dubois who grew up as Jean-Guy served his time for second degree murder and later continued the cycle of criminality because as he claimed it was the only place he felt like he fit in. Raymond Dubois Raymond was considered the deadly older brother who was the eldest of all the brothers and had a criminal record stretching back to 1947. Raymond specialized in extortion and was a suspect of hundreds of crimes throughout Montreal but despite his crime and tactics he was rarely convicted. In November 1976, Raymond had been driving in his limousine when he was violating traffic laws by going through twelve red lights in a row, when he was pulled over by a police officer and was arrested, he grabbed the officers finger and twisted it until it broke. Raymond faced murder charges in 1974 but was acquitted. Raymond died at his own hand in 1989 when he committed suicide at the age of 57 and was found in a hotel room surrounded by pills with his wrists slit. Normand and Rolland Dubois Both these Rolland and Normand were charged with assault in 1977 and spent some time in prison. Jean-Paul Dubois In 1977, Jean-Paul received a year's sentence for possessing the proceeds of a $100,000 jewelry theft and was also charged with perjury and contempt by the commission. Rene and Maurice Dubois There was not information on what had happened to them specifically found.  Life of crime  It is believed that the strength of the Dubois Brothers was built from the trust that they had between them, they were said to have made a gang of perfect cohesion in their neighbourhood who few would compete against. They built their criminal organization and power on intimidation and violence; they reigned like crime lords over illegitimate and legitimate businesses in their controlled territories. The Quebec Police Commission gave them a great compliment when they stated in 1977 in their report: \\"Some maintain that the ruthless methods of the Dubois, the large number of toughs gravitating about each of the nine brothers, as well as the widely dreaded cruelty of their hirelings, make them the most influential criminal group at the present time on the island of Montreal.\\" The network that the Dubois Brothers organized was made up of about two hundred men loosely organized into independent gangs of several dozen members with the brothers at the centre of this organization. Even the Dubois Brother's number one hitman, Donald Lavoie, was scared of the brothers because he claimed that they were too powerful and he believed that one day Claude Dubois would put a bullet through his head. The Dubois Brothers were not considered ones to hold back, they acted when to the degree they thought was necessary regardless of the cost which was reaffirmed the cruelty they demonstrated to their victims and foes that in turn shaped their reputation. Instances such as when a restaurant owner stood up to the Brothers insisting that they needed to pay for their food which resulted in him being beat up and a knife taken to his chest in order to carve a cross in it. Events such as this one left people fearful of the Dubois Brothers and reinforced their supremacy. Mercier, a Montreal journalist, started to realize how much corruption and integration into the community the group had one he began to follow one of the assault cases through the courts. The case was involving one of the young Dubois brothers and a merchant from St. Henri who had been beaten after he had refused to pay his daily receipt to the brothers’ hold up men. Mercier believed that the Dubois Brothers were getting help from someone on the inside as the victim was almost sentenced and the Dubois brother had only received a small fine. The Dubois Brothers also received permits, swung votes to which person they wanted through intimidation and were able to get judges to give reduced sentences. They had corrupted a journalist in order to have the journalist change information they needed and report information they wanted out but with his change of careers, due to the company finding out about his corruption, the Dubois Brothers turned him into their lawyer opening an office and giving them legal information. They were able to corrupt politicians, the police, judges and lawyers according to Mercier causing them a vast integration into society. There was never any formal structure or hierarchy to the Dubois Brothers group, other than the Brothers were on the top, they either individually or in tandem with each other controlled a particular criminal activity or territory and often shared their army or other members. The Dubois Brothers began in the 1950s with petty street crimes and eventually moved on to the four oldest brothers- Raymond, Jean-Guy, Normand and Claude- starting to convince local bar owners to give them protection funds and other extortions. Some of their petty street crimes were a series of burglaries and armed robberies in the early 1950s. By the time the 1960s rolled around extortion, targeting the owners and employees of nightclubs, bars and taverns in the eastern end of the city became their specialty. Near the end of the 1960s five of the brothers were charged with murdering a waiter at a quarrel in a local bar, which ended with the waiter shot, they were later acquitted and continued their reign. Into the late 1960s to 70s, the Dubois Brothers expanded their territory into the downtown nightclubs as they challenged the Cotroni Mafia family supremacy. The Cotroni Family began to show signs of weakness around the 1970s allowing the expansion of the Dubois Brothers territory into both the east and west ends of Montreal city. This movement allowed the Brothers to basically wipe out the rival Irish gang as well and take over a lucrative drug market by out muscling a motorcycle gang. The Dubois Brothers were prospering in the 1970s and continued to expand their territory and add to their criminal lifestyle. One of the Commissioners in the 1977 report described the Dubois brothers as living, in \\"opulence if we can judge by the external manifestations of wealth, such as town houses, country houses, expensive cars and an ostentatious life style.\\" The Dubois Brothers seemed to have it all. = Protection tax and loan sharking = The Dubois Brothers were known to terrorize the owners of nightclubs and bars in order to force the owners into paying protection taxes and then would begin to take over their business. They were known to use these tactics similarly with drug dealers, prostitutes, pimps, loan sharks, strippers, thieves and fences. The Brothers would start by frequenting a bar or nightclub either themselves or through sending an associate or cronies, they would begin by seeming friendly and then move on to picking fights with patrons, vandalizing the premises, commence harassing staff and assaulting the owner in a hostile take over. It would continue to get progressively worse until the owner could not take anymore of the attacks and agreed to what they Dubois Brothers were wanting. Majority of the time there seemed to be no option for the owners once the Brothers became interested, they would do what it took in order to get what they wanted. The Dubois Brothers would often settle for $100 a week in protection tax or payments, which at the time would have been equivalent to around $1000 a week today, with the Brothers collecting individually from dozens of bars or clubs. One witness, Charles Houle, who owned a bar on Notre Dame street west in Montreal claimed to police that the Dubois Brothers, specifically Raymond, in 1965 had paid a quick visit to his bar shortly they had opened and demanded he pay the weekly fee for the protection tax. It turned out that even at his testimony many years later he was still paying the tax and at this time it was believed to have totalled $50,000. Once there was control over the bar by Dubois Brother they would force integration of other criminal activities such as: control hiring so they could hire criminals, loansharking, drugs, gambling, etc. The owners would have no say in the matter and the criminal activities and the Dubois Brothers would gain a business or home base for their transactions and other criminal business. If the Brothers received a refusal or negative response from an owner of a business they wished to takeover, the Brothers or their associates would ensure nightly visits to the business where they would threaten patrons and staff and continue the hostility and if worse came to worse threaten the owners life. There were many cases of the attacks on business owners, one of them was Louis Fornier, owner of Jean Lou Cabaret, who refused the transaction with the Brothers and later was murdered on June 20, 1971. Another case similar to this, but ending on a better note, was that of Laurier Gatien the man who owned the Tavern Montreal at the time who had to endure multiple attempts on his life including shootings, knifing, and attacks with billiard cues and balls. Gatien could not deal with the pressure and later had to sell the tavern in October 1973. One of the Brother, Claude Dubois, had decided to expand the protection taxes even further by including pimps, prostitutes and strippers by requiring them to buy a work permit if they wished to work the streets or work in the club within the Dubois territory. By the 1970s, the Dubois Brothers, in the west end, had become the most prevalent loan sharks using the bars they had taken as their offices in order to run their loan sharking business. In order for a borrower to obtain a loan they had to pay a visit to one of the Dubois Brothers offices or businesses where if the loan were approved they would either receive the money directly or delivered later to them. It was expected of the borrower to make their payments in cash to the same location that they borrowed from and the interest of the loan was substantial usually sitting around 30%. One of their associates who turned informant, Dugenais, told police that majority of the Dubois Brothers loan shark customers were taxi drivers who would take the money to go to the night clubs and racetrack. One of the clients had claimed that because he could not afford to pay his $50 debt, which he ran up playing billiards, to Adrien Dubois he had no choice but to agree to be forced into the drug trade as a drug pusher claiming that they were greedy and took more profit than they should have. = Drug trafficking = As the Dubois Brothers continued to make money and become wealthier they realized that the highest profits were in the drug trade realizing that a drug, especially methamphetamine, were cheap enough to get and highly addictive and once a customer was hooked they could not resist coming back for more creating a customer base. One of their previous drug pushers stated that the Dubois Brothers could get a pound of marijuana for $30 imported from Mexico and were able to sell it on the streets for up to $750 making a major profit. The Dubois Brothers, more specifically Adrien, Claude and Roland, had branched off logically into drug trafficking in the mid 70s and were controlling, in the west end and city center of Montreal, the sales of marijuana, hashish, LSD, amphetamines, and cocaine. They had a web of dealers set up to distribute the drugs all of which were working in licensed establishments under the control of at least one of the Brothers. Montreal police were able to seize a drug distribution for the Dubois Brothers that consisted of nearly two million tenure pills in late 1973 to early 1974. The Brothers took it one step further by going continental when they began having roots in Pakistan because Adrien Dubois decided to introduce a Sixth Family associate to his impressive source of hashish through a corrupt government official in Pakistan who had a ministerial position and thrived for foreign currency. The Dubois Brothers were always thirsty for more territory and money and that is what lead them to the McSween Turf War.  McSween turf war  The Dubois Brothers had the Mcsweens, an Irish-Canadian gang, join their associates in 1957 after one of the Brothers met Pierre McSween in reform school while serving a two-year term for theft. McSween reported in his testimony that him and his brothers specialized in truck hijackings, selling the booty to the Dubois gang for a fraction of the value and committing theft or robbery and the Dubois Brothers in turn provided them with supplies such as weapons, getaway cars and other hired hands. The war between the two groups, Dubois Brothers and the McSween gang, broke out in 1973. The McSweens owned the territory adjacent to the Dubois Brothers for many years and the Dubois Brothers intended to drive the McSweens from their territory and start what was considered and called the \\"war over the west end.\\" What instigated the war was when Real Lapine, one of the friends and drug trafficking associates of the McSweens, was murdered in a bar on Notre Dame street west after he refused to sell Adrien Dubois drugs. The Dubois ended up being victorious in the battle and were able to expand their territory, but at the expense of over a dozen lives from both sides. Amongst the deceased was Jaques McSween who was ambushed in his home by Jean-Guy, Adrien and Claude Dubois and was killed on October 5, 1974. The most notorious of all the killings though was known as the Valentine's Eve Massacre.  Valentine’s Eve Massacre  The Valentine's Eve Massacre happened on the south side of Montreal, in Hotel Lapiniere on February 13, 1975, which was a hangout of the McSween gang. It happened when three men walked into the packed bar during a country-music show and opened fire killing four men and injuring five others. Three of the people killed had no association with either gangs and according to Pierre McSween he did not consider them \\"cool\\" killers because they just walked in and sprayed the place instead of walking up to the person they wished to execute and shooting them in the back of the head so no one else would get hurt. The target that evening was Roger \\"Birdie\\" Letourneau who was a former member of the gang before the Dubois Brothers took over. The men behind the shooting, according to McSween were Roger Fontaine, Claude Dubois, and Claude Lebeau who were carrying M-1 Semi-automatic rifles. After the Dubois Brothers had taken over the McSween territory they focused on taking over the downtown area.  Devils Disciples  The downtown area, which was Claude Dubois’ target, was very profitable in the trafficking of marijuana, LSD, and particularly meth, which operated out of the hippie area of St. Henri Square as wanting to gain control of Saint-Louis Square which was run by the Devil's Disciples. The Devil's Disciples were purely French and were considered the most powerful biker gang at their time in Montreal. The Disciples had created a highly profitable drug trafficking business in the Saint-Louis Square, which was located in downtown Montreal in 1972 and almost instantly became the largest open-air drug market in Montreal. Claude Dubois considered this as a threat and intrusion into his and his Brothers territory and hired another muscle group of bikers called the Popeyes Motorcycle Club led by Yves Buteau. Between 1974 and 1976 fifteen members of the Disciples were killed but the Dubois Brothers ended up succeeded taking over the territory and ran out the Devil's Disciples, yet again displaying their power. The Popeyes then began selling and managing the drugs in Saint-Henri square and the surrounding area after they chased out the Disciples but this was short lived as the Montreal Police had assembled a well- organized task force to take on the Dubois Brothers.  The fall of the Dubois Brothers  On November 17, 1975, the police began to set forth action in order to bring down the powerful Dubois Brothers; they established police task forces and began pressuring the Brothers. After some time the pressure began to deteriorate the Dubois Brothers organization through undercover operations and some of the organizations most notorious and loyal associates began to slip away, become informants or had met violent deaths. The papers and police began stating that never before has the criminal underworld's law of silence been broken by so many criminals, especially those who were so loyal to the organizations core. Among these numerous informants was Donald Lavoie who was one of the Dubois Brothers most trusted hitman whose previous occupation had been to eliminate anyone suspected of snitching as well as anyone who they told him to eliminate. It was Donald Lavoie who played the biggest part in the fall of the Dubois Brothers power, when Claude Dubois who had put a bounty on Lavoie's head, which he just nearly escaped, forcing Lavoie to testify for protection. By 1977, Roland and Normand were charged with assault and Claude and Adrien were charged with perjury for giving a false testimony to the Police Commission. Even earlier that year Jean-Paul received a year's sentence for possessing the proceeds of a $100,000 jewelry theft and as well was charged with perjury and contempt by the commission, leaving five of the brothers behind bars. On April 27, 1977, Jean-Guy was found guilty of the 2nd degree murder of Jean-Guy Fournier. It was not until November 12, 1982 that Claude Dubois who was considered one of the driving forces of the family's crime empire was convicted of the 1973 murder of Cotroni's brother-in-law and was locked away for 25 years basically resulting in the fall of the Dubois Brothers. By the mid 1980s the Brothers had lost their empire and were split up with some behind bars and some laying low. The name would have been all but forgotten in Montreal if it were not for Adrien Dubois who had become a successful businessman, after he was acquitted from his crime, owning buildings and nightclubs in Laurentian.

A number of Christian saints have anecdotes and stories about them in relation to animals or plants. In some cases they appeared to possess miraculous powers to speak with animals. Among examples of such supposed stories include the following. Anselm of Canterbury A group of dogs were pursuing a hare and the hare run under this horse as he was riding it. The dogs stopped and the hare continued. Anselm thought the hare reminded him of a poor soul about to die that is surrounded by devils waiting to carry away their prey. And Anselm then forbade the dogs to continue pursuing the hare, and the dogs obeyed and left the hare in peace.http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=548, retrieved January 14 Columba of Iona Columba, while living on the island of Iona, once supposedly called one of the other monks to him and told him that a heron would arrive in two days on the west side of the island, having flown there from Ireland. And he instructed the monk to go there and take the bird, bringing it back with him to feed it and take care of it for three days as a pilgrim. And after three days it would be ready to leave again, to go back to Ireland. And it all happened as Columba predicted, and the monk found the weak and hungry bird on the shore, took care of it, and released it again after three days.Adomnan of Iona. Life of St Columba. Penguin books, 1995 Like the story of Anselm with the hare representing a sinner on the point of death, it is possible that the heron was also like the penitents who came from Ireland to Iona to do penance and revive their souls, so they could later go back to where they came from with new spiritual life. Another story involving Columba is that there was a fruit tree near the monastery of Durrow in Ireland that was connected to Columba's monastery in Iona. The fruit was plentiful, but it was always bitter. When Columba came to Durrow on one occasion, he came to the tree and blessed it, saying 'In the name of almighty God, all your bitterness shall leave you, O bitter tree, and your fruit until now most bitter shall become most sweet.' And after he did this, the fruit of the tree supposedly did become sweet.Adomnan of Iona. Life of St Columba. Penguin books, 1995 He encountered a very large boar being pursued by hunting dogs in Skye and said 'Go no further, but die where you are now' and after he said this, the boar dropped dead.Adomnan of Iona. Life of St Columba. Penguin books, 1995 Shortly before he died, he supposedly blessed the island of Iona by saying that 'From this hour, from this instant, all poisons of snakes shall have no power to harm either men or cattle in the lands of this island for as long as the people who dwell here keep Christ's commandments'.Adomnan of Iona. Life of St Columba. Penguin books, 1995 A monk named Molua Ua Briúin asked Columba to bless a butchering knife for him, and Columba blessed it without realizing what it was. When he later learned that it was a butchering knife he said, 'I trust in my Lord, that the implement I have blessed will harm neither man nor beast'. And when this knife was later used to slaughter cows, the knife was incapable of cutting the cows' flesh and could not even penetrate the skin. This knife was then melted down and the metal for it was put on all the metal implements used at the monastery of Iona.Adomnan of Iona. Life of St Columba. Penguin books, 1995 He also supposedly encountered a monster in the River Ness, which he turned back by blessing it. This later was linked to the Loch Ness monster legend. Florentius In Gregory the Great's dialogues, there is recorded the story of two monks named Florentius and Euthicius. When a certain deacon came to visit Florentius, the area around his cell was filled with snakes and Florentius then prayed to God to get rid of the snakes, and suddenly lightning came down and killed them all, and when Florentius then asked God what should happen with their bodies, at the same moment a large number of birds came to eat their corpses http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/gregory_03_dialogues_book3.htm#C15 Francis of Assisi In his famous Canticle of the Sun, he referred to other creatures as his brothers and sisters. He tamed a wolf in the city of Gubbio and made an agreement with the wolf that the wolf would stop terrorizing the town, and in return the people would feed it (see Wolf of Gubbio). He also famously preached to birds and called for food to be given out to animals on Christmas Day. Francis of Paola He had a pet trout named 'Antonella'. A visiting priest, who didn't realize it was special, caught it and brought it back to cook it. When Francis realized what happened he sent word to the priest, and the priest annoyed by Francis' concern over the trout (that had now been cooked), threw it on the ground. The dead and cooked trout was brought back to Francis, and he put its remains back in water and called on God saying 'Antonella, in the name of Charity, return to life' and the trout then resurrected with its restored body and swam in the pool like before. St Gall St Gall, when on mission in Switzerland, once came across a bear that charged him, but he rebuked the bear. The bear then changed its behaviour and helped to gather firewood for St Gall and was a companion to him for the rest of his days. Jerome He supposedly healed a lion in the wilderness by removing a thorn from its paw, and the lion was then tamed and followed him around. Jesus Christ In the gospel, Jesus curses a fig tree after he finds no figs on it, even though it was not the season for figs. After he curses it, the tree withers and Jesus tells His disciples that whatever they ask for in prayer will be given to them, even if they should say to a mountain to be lifted up and go into the sea, it would obey them. The fig tree has often been thought to represent the people of Israel, who were not producing 'good fruit'. St Patrick In Irish legends, Patrick supposedly banished snakes from Ireland. Paul of Tarsus When on the island of Malta, he could pick up poisonous snakes without being bitten. At the end of Mark's gospel, Jesus told his disciples that they would perform this sign. Some have contested whether the final verses of Mark's gospel were original or a later addition, however. In recent years, some Pentecostal churches in the United States have claimed to replicate this miracle, believing it to be a sign of the Holy Spirit's presence. However, some have also been bitten and hospitalized or even died as a result of attempting this http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/pastor- jamie-coots-snake-handling-tv-preacher-dies-viper-bite-article-1.1616382, retrieved January 19, 2016 (see Snake handling) References Category:Groups of Christian saints ","title":"Saints and animal/plant life"},{"id":"49101414","title":"Madhusudhan Rao (actor)"},{"id":"49101448","text":"Andraya Michele Howard (born January 23, 1985) is an American media personality, model, actress, and fashion designer.

Personal life Henry Fletcher was born in Birmingham, England on January 17, 1859. His family moved to New Jersey, United States, when Henry was a small boy. By 1873, the family moved to Providence Rhode Island, where Henry attended public schools. He studied at Scholfield's Commercial College, a business school in Providence. Henry Fletcher married Hattie E. Bennett in 1883. She died in 1935. Three sons outlived him: Henry B. Fletcher Sr; R. Leslie Fletcher, president of the Providence Gas Company; and Paul W. Fletcher. A fourth son, Col. Edward G. Fletcher, died shortly after World War II. Career In 1881, Fletcher entered the jewelry industry, which was a large and important industry in Providence at the time. He partnered with Edward G. Burrows, Jr. to form Fletcher Burrows and Co. Burrows died in 1893. Fletcher was director of the Jewelers' Board of Trade. In 1898, Fletcher was elected as a Republican councilman from the Eighth Ward, then from 1901-1906 he represented the Seventh Ward. He was president of the Board of Aldermen in 1908. In 1908, Fletcher defeated Democratic incumbent Patrick J. McCarthy to win the mayor's office. He was re-elected in 1909, beating State Senator James H. Thurston. In 1910 he defeated Joseph E. Cole, and in 1911 he beat Joseph H. Gainer. Fletcher ran again in 1912 and 1916, losing both times. Subsequently, Fletcher retired from elective politics but remained active in the Republican Party. As mayor, Fletcher: * Backed the construction of the Scituate Reservoir * Developed the Port of Providence * Acquired land for the municipal pier * Deepened Providence's harbor * Supported efforts to attract the business of the Fabre Line, a steamship company which brought thousands of European immigrants to Providence. * In 1911, in response to rising traffic fatality rates, Fletcher introduced new laws meant to deal with the chaos on Providence city streets. This was at a time when the automobile was new, and traffic was a vexing problem. In 1921 Fletcher sold his jewelry business and retired. He maintained residences in Florida and New Hampshire as well as a summer home in Conimicut for many years. Fletcher was a 32nd degree mason. He belonged to several organizations, including: the Providence Town Criers, the Providence Central Club, and the Providence Chamber of Commerce. He was director of the Atlantic National Bank. Death and burial Fletcher died on August 26, 1953 in Barrington, Rhode Island, age 94, at the home of his eldest son, Henry B. Fletcher, Sr. He was buried at Swan Point Cemetery, and his funeral service was held at the Swan Point Cemetery chapel.

As a result of its being one of the first successes of the Ch'ŏllima Movement,http://www.cchere.com/topic/3893100 along with being the most numerous of all locomotive types on North Korea's railways,Kokubu, Hayato, 将軍様の鉄道 (Shōgun-sama no Tetsudō), it has become a distinctive symbol of North Korea, featured on postage stamps,http://www.cchere.com/article/3895102 propaganda posters, at the Arirang Festival, and even a mural at a station of the P'yŏngyang Metro. In 2001, Kim Jong-il awarded the Hero of Labour title to the Red Flag 1 class in recognition of its long-standing service, and the type has also been awarded the Order of the Red Banner Of the Three Great Revolutions three times. Red Flag 1 (붉은기1) Prototype of the Red Flag 1-class electric locomotive under construction. When Korea was partitioned after the end of the Second World War, the Korean State Railway had inherited a number of Japanese-built electric locomotives (the Toshiba-built DeRoI type being the most numerous) from its colonial-era predecessor, the Chosen Government Railway. Following the end of the Korean War, the railway network underwent large-scale reconstruction, part of which was the expansion of electrification. Expanding electrification of North Korea's rail network meant that the fifteen locomotives inherited from the Chosen Government Railway would be insufficient, As a result, the Ministry of Railways bought a number of new electric locomotives from Czechoslovakia in the mid 1950s (the Škoda Type 22E2). Political concerns, such as desire for self-reliance and the then- ongoing Ch'ŏllima Movement, however, led to the decision to undertake mass production domestically. To this end, a license to build the Škoda Type 30E was bought, including technology transfer. A number were built to the original design, but the primary focus was on the development of a larger, indigenous design based on the Type 30E. The result was the Red Flag 1 (붉은기1, Pulg'ŭn'gi 1), designed by a team led by Chŏn Chae-yun. This was a universal locomotive considerably larger than the Type 30E, with Co'Co' axle arrangement and distinctive body work featuring a rounded front end and trapezoidal, inset cab windows The traction motors, transformers, auxiliary motors, master controller and other components used on the first prototype were imported from the USSR or China. Production of the Red Flag 1 began at the Kim Chong-t'ae Electric Locomotive Works in 1961. The first prototype rolled off the assembly line on 30 August 1961; Kim Il-sung visited the plant for the occasion and chose the locomotive's name personally. The first production unit entered service on 14 January 1962,http://nk.chosun.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=14054 and another twenty were built that year. Thirty more followed in 1963, and production continued steadily thereafter. However, due to a range of problems with reliability, production facilities and methods, difficulties in reproducing key components such as the NB-410 traction motor and other complications that delayed mass production, it wasn't until 1970 that the production design was finalised. Eventually over 150 were built; in 2002 the KSR rostered 290 electric locomotives - the bulk of the motive power fleet - with the Red Flag 1 type (including variants) accounting for over half of that number. Over fifty years of operation, the Red Flag 1 class locomotives have made over 6 million kilometres in service. The earliest Red Flag 1 units had decorative chrome striping which was mostly omitted on later units, though did occasionally resurface on subsequent units. Their distinctive features are the rounded front end with trapezoidal cab windows, and fluted skirting with smooth carbody sides. Later Red Flag 1 units deleted the chrome striping, and have a somewhat less rounded front end with more rectangular cab windows, along with fluted skirting with fluted carbody sides. The early-style Red Flag 1 units numbered in the 5000 series were all painted in the standard light blue over dark green livery, or, with a minor variation, light green over dark green; the vast majority of those numbered in the 5100 series also carry the standard livery, but one exception (5110) has been noted, painted in the orange over red \\"lightning\\" scheme. The late-style Red Flag 1 units, numbered in the 5200 and 5300 series, were likewise all painted in the standard scheme. Red Flag 2 (붉은기2) A Red Flag 2 class locomotive of the Korean State Railway in P'yŏngyang. The original design underwent a number of improvements, including a redesign of the body work; the new design had a square front end and square cab windows; this new design was given the name Red Flag 2 (붉은기2, Pulg'ŭn'gi 2). Like the later style of the Red Flag 1, the Red Flag 2 also had fluting on both the skirting and the carbody sides, and were painted in the standard livery of light blue over dark green. Red Flag 2-class unit number 5385, with the later-style square cab, was built in 1980.North Korea 2013; trip report Variants 5 March Virtue-class (오삼덕호) locomotive number 5310 at its unveiling. Parallel to the introduction of the Red Flag 2 came the Man'gyŏngdae (만경대호) class. These had late-style Red Flag 1 body work, but were geared for higher speeds for dedicated express passenger service; they were painted in a cream over red livery and numbered in the 5200 series. These produce and were introduced in 1980. Over the years, many Red Flag 1 and Red Flag 2 locomotives were modernised. Upgraded and rebuilt units are given a new class name, and can be identified by the addition of the new class name in large lettering - either painted on or using characters cut out of metal. These include: * Reunification-class (조국동일호, Choguk Tong'il-ho) - rebuilt from early Red Flag 1 class. Two units known, one (5048) in standard light blue over dark green livery, the other in cream over red; * Reunification Youth- class (조국동일소년호, Choguk Tong'il Sonyŏn-ho) - rebuilt from early Red Flag 1 class. Several known, three (5050 plus two others) in cream over red or red and orange livery, one (5070) in standard light blue over dark green, and one (5057) in the orange over red \\"lightning\\" scheme; * Songdojŏn Youth-class (속도전청년호, Songdojŏn Ch'ŏngnyŏn-ho) - rebuilt from late Red Flag 1 class.

Six units known, three (5340, 5364, 6387) in standard light blue over dark green, one (5367) in cream over red,http://livedoor.blogimg.jp/ba0001ssc/imgs/b/c/bc8182a8.jpg and two (5311 and one other) in the orange over red \\"lightning\\" scheme; * 2nd Grand Ch'ŏllima March-class (제2의 천리마대진군호, Che-i-ŭi Ch'ollima Taejin'gun-ho) - in 1999 the KCNA announced the construction of a new class of electric locomotives with this name by the Kim Chŏng-t'ae Electric Locomotive Works, and stated that they were to be deployed to the locomotive depots at Kilju, Hŭich'ŏn and Kowŏn. One has been seen so far (5378), painted in the standard livery of light blue over dark green. * Worker-class (로동자호, Rodongja-ho) - rebuilt from Red Flag 2 class. One unit known (5378), painted in the standard livery, and one (5388) in cream/red. Numbering Sinanju. Running numbers are allotted in the 5000, 5100, 5200 and 5300 series, but the assignment seems haphazard, with many units of Red Flag 2 design carrying lower serial numbers than some Red Flag 1 units. The 5000 series consists entirely of early-style Red Flag 1, and the 5100 series is almost entirely early-style Red Flag 1, with one anomalous unit of Red Flag 2 design (5103); this may be a case of a scrapped unit's number being reassigned. The 5200 and 5300 series are a mix of late-style Red Flag 1, Red Flag 2 and Man'gyŏngdae-class units. While it is possible that 387 locomotives were built, with simultaneous production of both designs, it seems more likely that as the Red Flag 2 were being built, existing units of the Red Flag 1 type were rebuilt internally to Red Flag 2 standard and given new running numbers. This would fit better with the information that around 150 units were built in total. However, to add to the confusion, over the years many units were upgraded and rebuilt, and given new class names, whilst retaining their original running number.

He was favorably impressed by the character development and the performances, especially Ballinger's and Reale's. He also liked its structure and musical score, but felt that the exposition was sometimes bogged down in the early episodes by its explanation of details and sometimes panders to Miranda's established internet audience; he felt that the series improves in the later episodes. He disliked the sexual innuendos and found Miranda's relationship with Uncle Jim uncomfortable, although these are elements carried over from Miranda's YouTube videos. The A.V. Club's Danette Chavez commented that Ballinger's \\"portrayal of Miranda is multidimensional in spite of the character's single-mindedness. ... Haters fleshes out the environment that would spawn such an egotistical personality. ...

In \\"an eight-episode Netflix series ... the lampoon loses its edge\\". He also thought that much of the pathos in the series is \\"unearned, unconvincing\\" and the characters are \\"shallow vessels freighted down by contrived plot complications . ... And there's more than a bit of that vainglorious YouTubers' entitlement in where Haters ultimately ends up, the satire finally curdling into smugness.\\"Uhlich, Keith. \\"Haters Back Off!: TV Review\\", The Hollywood Reporter, October 12, 2016 Sonia Saraiya of Variety did not think that the series has \\"the same organic appeal as Ballinger's bizarre, pastiche-y videos. ... Miranda lacks some of the innocent naivete that makes her character work on YouTube. ...

Adapted from the 1954 novel of the same title by Erle Stanley Gardner, this episode marked the beginning of Raymond Burr's long-running portrayal of the famous fictional lawyer. Synopsis Red-headed waitress Evelyn Bagby (Whitney Blake) comes home to her apartment one night and is shocked to find a revolver, which she'd never seen before, in her cigarette box. Having once been accused, then acquitted, of stealing jewelry from a famous movie star, Evelyn calls defense attorney Perry Mason (Raymond Burr) to ask for his advice. He advises her to leave her San Fernando Valley apartment and check into a hotel in Hollywood for the night. As she drives to Hollywood, a driver with a hood over his head tries to force her off the road; panicking, she fires the revolver twice in his direction, causing him to drive off the road. Evelyn brings the gun to Mason's office and tells him what had happened. Mason goes to the scene of the incident, and finds that the homicide police are already there; the hooded driver was killed by a bullet to the head. He's identified as a man who had cheated Evelyn out of $1500 when she first came to Hollywood, and there's no bullet hole in the man's hood—which turns out to be a pillowcase from the apartment house where Evelyn lives. The police refuse to believe her story, and she's arrested for murder. After a great many twists and turns (including Mason using an identical gun to fire two bullets into a tree and a post at the crash site), Mason, with help from private investigator Paul Drake (William Hopper), exposes the true killer in the courtroom; as a result, Evelyn is cleared of all charges. Notes * Sergeant Holcomb, who was a regular character in the original Perry Mason novels, only appears in two episodes of the TV series; this one, and \\"The Case of the Fan Dancer's Horse\\" (in which he's played by Rusty Wescoatt). In most of the episodes, this character's role is filled by that of Lieutenant Arthur Tragg (Ray Collins) and/or Lieutenant Andy Anderson (Wesley Lau). * Whitney Blake, who plays the \\"restless redhead\\" in this episode, later plays wrongfully accused Diana Reynolds in the episode \\"The Case of the Black-Eyed Blonde.\\" * Although this was the first episode broadcast, it wasn't the pilot episode for the series; that episode, \\"The Case of the Moth-Eaten Mink,\\" was broadcast twelve weeks later.

The design and lay-out of the airfield was quite unique, having 5 runways, 2 of these being east west lay-out (07-25) both 1000 yards long, the northern runway incorporated a dummy deck landing strip, complete with under-ground arresting gear with four above ground arrestor wires, which was a duplicate of that installed on HMS Implacable for training of aircraft carrier landings, these mainly being carried out with the Seafire, a naval version of the spitfire with folding wings. The site also had its own cinema and stage hall Post-war March 1952 the airfield became inactive and was placed under care and maintenance, during 1953 Air whaling (now Bristow group) used the facilities for repairs to the whaling fleet of helicopters until moving out in June 1958. June 1957 it was finally closed as a naval establishment, from 1958-1960 the entire site was sold off. 27 June 1980 the BBC purchased the whole site and applied for planning permission to erect at the airfield a shortwave radio station consisting of 21 self- supporting towers holding aerial arrays and ancillary buildings on a 300-acre site.

From the first crop of foals sired by Sunday Silence she won four of her twenty-five races and finished second nine times in a racing career which lasted from January 1995 until December 1997. She was unraced as a juvenile, but in 1995 she won the Yushun Himba and won the JRA Award for Best Three-Year-Old Filly. As a four-year-old she won the Keian Hai and the Queen Elizabeth II Commemorative Cup and won the JRA Award for Best Older Filly or Mare. She failed to win as a five-year-old and was retired from racing at the end of the year. Apart from her victories she was placed in the Oka Sho, Prix de la Nonette Kyoto Daishoten and Takarazuka Kinen (twice). She has had success as a broodmare, producing several good winners. Background Dance Partner is a bay mare bred in Japan by Shadai Farm.

In the Group Three Prix de la Nonette at Deauville Racecourse on 27 August she took the lead in the straight but was caught in the final stride and beaten a short head by the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches winner Matiara. Two weeks later she started 2.3/1 favourite for the Group One Prix Vermeille at Longchamp Racecourse but finished sixth of the ten runners behind Carling. In late autumn the filly returned to Japan and was matched against colts for the first time in the Kikuka Sho over 3000 metres on 7 November, finishing fifth behind Mayano Top Gun. On her final appearance of the year she finished second to Samani Beppin in the Grade II Sankeisports Hai Hanshin Hinba Tobubetsu at Hanshin Racecourse on 17 December.

In October Dance Partner returned from her summer break and finished fourth to Marvelous Sunday in the Kyoto Daishoten. On November 10 she competed in all-female competition for the first time in 1996 when she was one of sixteen fillies and mares to contest the Queen Elizabeth II Commemorative Cup. Ridden by Hirofumi Shii she won the Grade I prize from Hishi Amazon (winner of the race in 1994), Fair Dance and She's Grace. The runner-up was demoted to seventh after a steward's inquiry. In her two remaining races of that year, Dance Partner finished tenth behind Singspiel in the Japan Cup and sixth behind Sakura Laurel in the Arima Kinen. Dance Partner won her second JRA Award in January 1997 when she was voted Best Older Filly or Mare for 1996. =1997: five-year-old season= Dance Partner began her third season with a trip to Hong Kong for the Queen Elizabeth II Cup at Sha Tin Racecourse on 13 April, and finished eighth behind the South African-trained London News. On her return to Japan she finished third to Bubble Gum Fellow in Naruo Kinen at Hanshin in June. In July she finished third for the second consecutive year in the Takarazuka Kinen, beaten by Marvelous Sunday and Bubble Gum Fellow. Dance Partner returned in October and finished second to the three-year-old colt Silk Justice in the Kyoto Daishoten and then attempted to repeat her 1996 success in the Queen Elizabeth II Commemorative Cup on 9 November. She narrowly failed to complete the double, being beaten a neck into second place by the four-year-old Erimo Chic. In December she was again invited to contest the Arima Kinen, but made no impact and finished unplaced behind Silk Justice. Breeding record Dance Partner was retired to become a broodmare at Shadai Farm. To date, she has produced ten named foals and nine winners: *Royal Partner, a bay filly, foaled in 1999, sired by Helissio. Won three races. *Dream Partner, bay colt, later gelded, 2000, by Helissio.

She is author of The Importance of Being Little. Education and early career Christakis graduated from Harvard College with a degree in social anthropology in 1986. She was one of the first undergraduate interns at Harvard’s Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations and studied in Kenya in 1985. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Christakis worked on public health projects in Bangladesh and Ghana and served as a case manager for indigent adults with mental illness and addiction in Boston. In 1990, Christakis obtained a Master of Public Health degree from Johns Hopkins University, with a concentration in international health. In 1993, she obtained a second master's degree from the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, with a focus on the role of education campaigns to prevent HIV infection and to improve maternal and child health. Christakis obtained her third master's degree in 2008, in early childhood education, from Lesley University and was then licensed in Massachusetts as an early childhood teacher and preschool director. Career Since the 1990s, Christakis has worked as a preschool teacher, college administrator and instructor, educational consultant, and writer and journalist. From 2009-2013, Christakis was appointed Co-Master, together with her husband, the scientist Nicholas Christakis, of Pforzheimer House at Harvard College. In 2013, Christakis moved to Yale University, where she was appointed Lecturer in Early Childhood Education at the Zigler Center in Child Development and Social Policy at the Yale Child Study Center. At Yale, she has taught undergraduate courses in child policy, early childhood education, and child development. She was appointed Associate Master of Silliman College, one of Yale’s 12 residential colleges, in the spring of 2015, a post she held until June, 2016. Christakis has written on the developmental needs of children, young adults, and families, and on popular culture and other topics, for many venues, including The Atlantic, CNN.com, The Washington Post, The Huffington Post, the Financial Times, and The Boston Globe. She wrote a TIME.com Ideas column for two years. She has written in the defense of the rights of minors and criticized the increasing bureaucratization of American schooling. Her article in The Atlantic in early 2016, “The New Preschool Is Crushing Kids,” was described in Slate as having an “explosive” effect on the education world. Her book, The Importance of Being Little: What Preschoolers Really Need From Grownups was published by Viking Penguin in February 2016, and it debuted on the New York Times Hardcover Nonfiction Bestseller List of February 28, 2016 at number 19. Science described the book as \\"superbly written\\" and \\"supported by a rich scientific literature.\\" In October 2019, she joined the National Advisory Board of Defending the Early Years. Christakis has spoken twice at the Aspen Institute Ideas Festival. Support of free expression In October, 2015, in her capacity as Associate Master, Christakis wrote an e-mail to the undergraduates at Silliman College, Yale University on the role of free expression in universities. This email was in response to a directive from the Intercultural Affairs Committee at Yale that provided guidelines regarding Halloween costumes.https://www.thefire.org/email-from- intercultural-affairs/ In her email, she argued that, from a developmental perspective, students might wish to consider whether administrators should provide guidance to college students regarding Halloween attire or whether students should be allowed to \\"dress themselves.\\" According to The Atlantic, \\"Her message was a model of relevant, thoughtful, civil engagement.\\" But the message played a role in protests at Yale about several issues, and it received national attention. This incident prompted a number of social critics to comment on possible generational changes.Fox, Claire (2016) \\"I find that offensive\\". Biteback. Christakis eventually decided to no longer teach at Yale, and, on the anniversary of the events (in October 2016), she described the difficult circumstances she had faced, expressing concern that a \\"culture of protection may ultimately harm those it purports to protect.\\" While in a similar post at Harvard in 2012, Christakis was also involved in the defense of free expression. She came to the defense of minority students who were using satire to criticize the final clubs at that institution, arguing that policing free expression on campus \\"denies students the opportunity to learn to think for themselves.\\" In another column that same year, she came to the defense of a high school student wearing a T-shirt supporting gay rights.  Personal  Christakis is married to scientist and author Nicholas Christakis and they have four children, one of whom they adopted later in life, while serving as foster parents.

It is a densely-foliaged shrub with grey, felty leaves and blue to violet-coloured flowers clustered at the tips of its branches. Description Eremophila fasciata is an erect shrub which grows to a height of between and is covered with a dense layer of yellowish-grey hairs, giving the foliage a felty texture. The branches are rough due to large numbers of leaf bases left after older leaves have fallen. The leaves are densely crowded and overlapping at the ends of the branches and are long, wide, thick and linear in shape. The flowers are borne singly without a stalk in leaf axils and are clustered near the ends of the branches. There are 5 claw-like sepals which are linear in shape, flattened at the base and needle- like at the tip, long, about wide and covered in the same hairs as the leaves and branches. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is dark lilic-coloured to blue on the outside and white inside with lilac-coloured spots. The outside of the tube and the petal lobes are covered with a hairy layer like the leaves and sepals while the inside of the petal lobes is glabrous and the inside of the tube is densely filled with white, woolly hairs. Flowering occurs from June to September and is followed by fruits which are cone-shaped, long and have a woolly covering. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 2007 and the description was published in Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae. The specific epithet is according to Chinnock from the \\"Latin fasciata, a bundle; referring to the flowers densely clustered at the branch tips and making the plant appear fasciated\\". The word in classical and botanical Latin for \\"bundle\\" is fascis.Lewis, C.T. & Short, C. (1879). A Latin dictionary founded on Andrews' edition of Freund's Latin dictionary. Oxford: Clarendon Press.Stearn, W.T. (1983). Botanical Latin. History, grammar, syntax, terminology and vocabulary. (3rd edition). Newton Abbot London: David Charles. Distribution and habitat Eremophila fasciata is only known from the hills south-east of Meekatharra in the Murchison biogeographic region where it grows with other dense shrubs. Conservation status Eremophila fasciata is classified as \\"Priority Three\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat. Use in horticulture The crowded, furry leaves are an attractive feature of this eremophila but may make it less suitable for gardens in areas of high humidity. It also produces masses of flowers in spring. E. fasciata is difficult to propagate from seed or from cuttings but can be grafted onto Myoporum rootstock during warm weather. It prefers well- drained soil, will grow in full sun or partial shade and is tolerant of most frosts.

Debates about this topic are mainly focused on the extent to which language influences spatial cognition or if it does at all. Research also concerns differences between perspectives on spatial relations across cultures, what these imply, and the exploration of potentially partaking cognitive mechanisms. Frames of reference across cultures Research shows that frames of reference for spatial cognition differ across cultures and that language could play a crucial role in structuring these different frames. Three types of perspectives on space can be distinguished: * The Relative perspective (dominant in Dutch, English, and Japanese) is dependent on the viewer's position towards the object and often uses descriptions like \\"the object is to the left/right of ...\\". * The Absolute perspective (found in speakers of Arrernte, Guugu Yimithirr, Kuuk Thaayore, and Tzeltal) is based on cardinal directions such as north, east, south, and west. Therefore, the description of the location of an object does not change according to the position towards it. * The Intrinsic perspective (found in speakers of Mopan and Totonac) describes the location of an object without referring to yourself or the use of cardinal directions. Instead it uses the relation towards another object to specify spatial relations (e.g. \\"the object is at the back/front/side of ...\\"). Languages like English or Dutch do not exclusively make use of relative descriptions but these appear to be most frequent compared to intrinsic or absolute descriptions. An absolute frame of reference is usually restricted to large scale geographical descriptions in these languages. Speakers of the Australian languages Arrernte, Guugu Yimithirr, and Kuuk Thaayore only use absolute descriptions. The relative and intrinsic perspectives seem to be connected as there is no known language which applies only one of these frames of reference exclusively. Two views on spatial cognition (1.) It has been argued that people universally use an egocentric representation to solve non-linguistic spatial tasks which would align with the relative frame of reference. (2.) Other researchers have proposed that people apply multiple frames of reference during their daily lives and that languages reflect these cognitive structures. In the light of the current body of literature the second view seems to be the more plausible one. Directional gestures The dominant frames of reference have found to be reflected in the common types of gesticulation in the respective language. Speakers of absolute languages would typically represent an object moving north with a hand movement towards the north. Whereas speakers of relative languages typically depict a movement of an object to the right with a hand movement to the right, independent of the direction they are facing during speech. Speakers of intrinsic languages would, for example, typically represent human movement from the perspective of the mover with a sagittal hand gesture away from the speaker. The spatial representation of time A study by Boroditsky and Gaby compared speakers of an absolute language—Pormpuraawans—with English speakers. The task on which they compared them consisted of the spatial arrangement of cards which showed a temporal progression. The result was that the speakers of the relative language (Americans) exclusively chose to represent time spatially as progressing from left (earlier time) to right (later time). Whereas the Pormpuraawans took the direction they faced into account and preferred to depict time as progressing from east (earlier time) to west (later time) the most. Third variables Confounding variables could potentially explain a significant proportion of the measured difference in performance between the linguistic frames of reference. These can be categorized into three types of confounding factors: * Environmental factors (e.g. rural vs. urban or open terrain vs. dense forest) could influence linguistic and non-linguistic categories. * Global cognitive styles (e.g. individualism vs. collectivism) could act as a mediator between language and cognition. * Differences in habitual action (could be reflected in subsistence patterns) might shape the differing use of frames of reference in language and cognition. =The importance of language for cognition= Gentner, Özyürek, Gürcanli, and Goldin-Meadow found that deaf children, who lacked a conventional language, did not use gestures to convey spatial relations (see home sign). Building on that, they showed that deaf children performed significantly worse on a task of spatial cognition compared to hearing children. They concluded that the acquisition of (spatial) language is an important factor in shaping spatial cognition. Cognitive mechanisms Several mechanisms accounting for or contributing to the possible effect of language on cognition have been suggested: *Perceptual tuning and attention: Experience (with language) can direct habitual attention so that perception becomes more oriented towards particular features in the environment. *The novice-expert shift: Increased experience in a specific domain can lead to a recoding of representational units. *Structure-mapping: When comparing conceptual representations based on similarities, language can influence what tends to be compared to what by promoting the saliency of specific categories. *Costs of computation: Based on the assumption of language promoting the formation of different categories, it would result that the cognitive effort to access the more salient frame of reference in the respective language (relative, absolute or intrinsic) is lower in comparison to switching to another frame.

Based on the Scottish fairy tale by George MacDonald, it tells the story of a princess afflicted by a constant weightlessness, unable to get her feet on the ground, both literally and metaphorically, until she finds a love that brings her down to earth. The musical was premiered for the Royal National Theatre in London in 2013. The stage production featured actress Rosalie Craig as the titular character. The musical was generally well-received, enjoyed an extended run in the theatre, and released its cast recording in 2015. Background and Creation In 2013, the National Theatre produced a musical staging of the story. It is adapted by Samuel Adamson; directed by Marianne Elliott, winner of the Tony Award for Best Directing in 2011, and has music and lyrics by Tori Amos. It was expected to premiere in London in April 2012, but The National Theatre announced in October 2011 that the production would be delayed until later in the year. The musical opened to positive reviews in September 2013, starring Rosalie Craig in the titular role, subsequently singled out as a stand-out performance. Craig was nominated for many awards, and ultimately won the Evening Standard's award for best actress in a musical. The choreography, lighting, set design, music (Amos) and other cast performances were also lauded and nominated for a range of awards. In 2014, Amos stated that the production team had ambitions of bringing The Light Princess to American Broadway, but expressed worry that the original National Theatre production might not be commercial enough for the American audience. On creating the musical, Amos stated: American singer/songwriter and classically trained pianist Tori Amos wrote music and lyrics for the musical stage production. \\"It wasn’t commercial theater, so from the top down they (the National Theatre) said to us, do not dumb this down. You be brave, you be bold, you be confrontational. Sam and I said, well, this is a feminist fairy tale, and not everyone will be comfortable with it. It’s not always going to make everyone feel warm and fuzzy. It brings up confrontations between teenagers and their parents, that would resonate in the 21st century [...] The Light Princess has to be something that kids can come see, because it is a story of a teenage girl. It might be a little dark for some. But we found that there were kids that were completely entranced. And even though sometimes it got scary, they stayed with the story.\\" Selected tracks from the musical is available for streaming from the National Theatre, including \\"My Fairy Story\\", \\"Althea\\", \\"Amphibiava\\" and \\"Better Than Good\\". Another stage adaption was done to the fairy tale by a Massachusetts director, Emily C. A. Snyder. On 1 July 2018 Alex Parker and Club 11 staged a concert performance of the musical at Cadogan Hall in London. It starred Rosalie Craig returning to the role of Althea, Craig's husband Hadley Fraser as Prince Digby, Trevor Dion Nicholas as King Darius, Gabrielle Brooks as Piper, Louis Maskell as Llewelyn, Norman Bowman as King Ignacio, Anna-Jane Casey as Sergeant at Arms, Laura Pitt-Pulford as Falconer and David Langham as Mr Flowers. Both Tori Amos and Samuel Anderson attended the concert who both joined in the rapturous standing ovation at the end of the performance. Synopsis In the middle of a desert lies the kingdom of Lagobel, which owes its wealth to gold buried in its native sands. The kind king and queen have two children, eldest son Alexander and daughter Althea. When the queen dies, the kingdom is plunged into a tearful sorrow, all except the princess Althea, who instead chooses to reject sadness, instead floating into the air, above emotion and responsibility, seemingly without any influence from gravitational forces. Her father descends into cold- heartedness, locking her in a tower with the orphan Piper. East of Lagobel, across a vast wooded wilderness, lies Sealand, a kingdom rich in natural resources, most notably a healthy network of rivers. The queen dies mysteriously shortly after questioning the greedy king. The land dares not weep, fearing the king's wrath. The prince Digby, however, did not smile after the incident, adopting the moniker 'Solemn Prince of Sealand'. He grows up to be a proud and dutiful warrior. The day of Digby's coming of age, Prince Alexander of Lagobel was killed by a Sealand assassin, and Sealand declares war on Lagobel, with sights aimed upon the vast riches of their Western neighbor. Upon the realization of Althea's impending ascent to the throne, the king of Lagobel urges her to take up her familial duty of leading Lagobel's army against the incoming siege from Sealand. Althea laughs off her father's requests, instead fleeing to the wilderness to find her own sanctuary. She comes across a secret lake, the source of Lagobel's limited water supply. She hears about the slaughter of the Lagobel army at the hands of the Sealand force. At the lake she comes across Prince Digby, who teases her about her lack of gravity, and realizes the value of the lake upon which Lagobel depends for life. His conversation with Althea fills Digby with mirth, prompting his first smile since his childhood. He falls in love with Althea, and she for him, engaging in a joyous dance in the forest. Back in Lagobel, rumors of the princess's actions in the forests fill the people with distrust with the throne. The king redoubles his efforts to return Althea to a normal state. He accepts the theory that making the princess cry will cure her. He tries arranging a marriage for her, in the hope that destroying her subsequent marriage or child will cause her to cry. Althea escapes again to the lake, where she and Digby declare themselves queen and king of the lake, and consummate their love, conceiving a child. Digby asks Althea to return to the normal world with him, offering to build a house. Althea, preferring her watery home, asks Digby to stay. Digby heads toward Sealand, encountering his brother on the way. Digby tells Llewelyn he has killed the princess and they return to Sealand. The king of Sealand learns of the life-giving lake and vows to dam it to choke the life out of Lagobel. Digby returns to the lake to destroy the dam, and is nearly killed.

The script by Adamson and music by Amos, however, divided critics. Professional critic ratings of the musical ranged the full spectrum from 1 to 5 stars, though more often complimentary than not. Many reviewers found the musical to be a fantastic and unusual fairytale with unafraid scope and smarts. The Independent gave it a 4-star review, calling it a \\"bewitchingly unusual evening walking on air\\". Time Out likewise gave it 4 stars, saying it was \\"a visual and technical tour de force with a title performance from Rosalie Craig that’ll blow your mind and melt your heart.\\" Another 4 star review came from What's On Stage, calling it an \\"unusual and delightful surprise\\" with an excellent ensemble led by a Craig in \\"one of the most extraordinary, vocally resourceful and physically triumphant performances ever seen in musical theatre.\\". The Evening Standard gave 4 stars, finding the musical \\"worth the wait\\" and a showcase for Amos as an artist and songwriter, with a stunningly good performance by Craig and gorgeous set design by Smith. Metro likewise gave 4 stars, with splendid music by Amos and fantastic production, but ultimately being blown away by Craig as Althea, concluding with \\"a star is born.\\" Simon Edge of The Daily Express gave the musical its best review, a perfect score of 5 stars, calling it a \\"feast for the eyes\\", with a \\"staggeringly good\\" lead performance by Craig, stirring and sweet music by Amos, and ultimately finding that \\"this bonkers but beautiful fantasy defies categorisation\\". Edge stated: \\"Every so often you see something in the theatre so arresting, so unlike anything you’ve seen before, that you want to grab strangers in the street and tell them to book tickets [...] Bonkers, dazzling, lyrical, fun and sweet - Tori Amos's musical is a wonderful, unforgettable feast for the senses [...] All I know is I’d go again tomorrow, and again the day after that.\\" Other reviewers were mixed in their critiques, most often founding the musical too unfocused, its script overtly preachy for adults, and the music not memorable enough. The Telegraph gave a 3-star review, praising Craig's performance, but finding the narrative \\"preachy\\" and Amos' music lacking in standout numbers. London Theatre gave another 3 stars, calling the musical \\"visually ravishing\\" with a brilliant cast and occasionally haunting music by Amos, but overall deeming it a \\"honourable, interesting misfire\\". The Guardian's review gave the musical 2 stars, citing a lack of emotional punch, finding Amos' score sometimes bland, and Adamson's narrative too meandering. The Stage enjoyed the set production, the superb ensemble and Amos' rich music, but felt the story might fail to capture any specific audience group, being perhaps too complex for children and too earnest for adults.http://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/review.php/39007/the-light-princess The Huffington Post concluded that its flaws \\"cannot dim the magic of The Light Princess.\\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/victoria-sadler/light- princess-review_b_4082983.html Financial Times gave a 3-star review, stating that cluttered content was weighing an otherwise \\"daring, beautiful and original\\" musical down.http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/e884aaf4-34ca-11e3-a13a-00144feab7de.html#axzz317pztL5b The Arts Desk gave 3 stars, citing more great cheorography than real chemistry, not enjoying Amos' music and lyrics.http://www.theartsdesk.com/theatre/light-princess-national-theatre Variety found fault with the music as well, stating a tendency to ramble, but called Craig's performance \\"career-making\\" and intense.https://variety.com/2013/legit/reviews/west-end-review-the-light- princess-1200712342/ Cast recording A cast album of the 2013 London production was released in October 2015 by Universal/Mercury Classics. The album will be produced by songwriter and composer Tori Amos, recorded during 2014 at different stops during her Unrepentant Geraldines Tour in support of her own album. Amos' tour team, including Mark Hawley and Marcel van Limbeek, engineered the cast album throughout the tour, having recorded the orchestra in April and met up with the different cast members \\"as they were available\\". It will contain all 33 tracks from the show and will also feature exclusive bonus tracks sung by Amos. Amos expressed she was happy to be able to give The Light Princess a cast recording under these terms, because so many theatre musicals no longer get an album release because of the expense and logistics involved.http://www.antimusic.com/news/14/May/06Tori_Amos_Recording_Soundtrack_to_The_Light_Princess_Musical.shtml Notes and references External links  *Live streaming tracks from the musical, hosted by National Theatre's Soundcloud *The Light Princess (Etext from CCEL) New Victory Theatre production of The Light Princess Category:Children's short stories Category:Plays based on fairy tales Category:Fictional princesses Category:2013 musicals Category:George MacDonald ","title":"The Light Princess (musical)"},{"id":"49102375","text":"Sylvia Haydée Kersenbaum (born 27 December 1945) is an Argentine pianist, composer and teacher.

The halt was provided to enable residents of the isolated Keekle Terrace, less than 100 yds from the track, to get to and from work at the equally isolated Walkmill Colliery and coke ovens in Cumbria, England. The Platform is not shown by Jowett. The halt consisted of two wooden platforms. It was unstaffed and had no shelter or toilet, but each platform carried a lone oil lamp.The halt with colliers' cottages beyond, via Cumbrian Railways Association Publications both official and authoritative variously refer to the halt as Keekle Colliers' Platform, Keekle Colliers Platform and Keekle Halt. The halt did not appear in public timetables. Its purpose was to bring workers to and from the remote colliery, but on at least one occasion a passenger special called to take children to and from a Sunday School outing at St Bees. Further research is needed to establish exactly when services to the halt ended, as Butt differs from Croughton et al., who state it was still being used in October 1923. History The line was one of the fruits of the rapid industrialisation of West Cumberland in the second half of the nineteenth century, being specifically born as a reaction to oligopolistic behaviour by the London and North Western and Whitehaven, Cleator and Egremont Railways. The halt was on the company's main line from to . All lines in the area were primarily aimed at mineral traffic, notably iron ore, coal and limestone, none more so than the C&WJR;'s line to Workington, which earned the local name \\"The Track of the Ironmasters\\". General goods and passenger services were provided, but were very small beer compared with mineral traffic. The founding Act of Parliament of June 1878 confirmed the company's agreement with the Furness Railway that the latter would operate the line for one third of the receipts. Services Passenger trains consisted of antiquated Furness stock hauled largely by elderly Furness engines referred to as \\"rolling ruins\\" by one author after a footplate ride in 1949. No Sunday passenger service was ever provided on the line. The initial passenger service in 1879 consisted of *two Up (northbound) trains a day, leaving at 09:20 and 13:45, calling at Cleator Moor, , , and terminating at Workington, taking 30 minutes in all. *they returned as Down trains, leaving Workington at 10:30 and 16:00 In 1880 the extension northwards to was opened. The service was extended to run to and from Siddick and an extra train was added, with * three up trains a day, leaving Moor Row at 07:40, 10:12 and 14:45, taking 30 minutes to Workington and an extra four to proceed to Siddick, where connections were made with the MCR. * Down trains left Siddick at 08:45, 12:22 and 17:00 By 1922 the service reached its high water mark, with: * five up trains a day from Moor Row through to Siddick, leaving Moor Row at 07:20, 09:50, 13:15, 16:50 and 1820. * one train Mondays to Fridays Only from Moor Row to Workington, leaving at 13:45 and also calling at , making that halt qualify as a publicly advertised passenger station * one Saturdays Only train leaving Cleator Moor (NB not from Moor Row) at 12:50 for Workington * one Saturdays Only train leaving Moor Row at 19:35 for Workington There was one fewer Down train, as the 09:50 Up was provided to give a connection at Siddick with a fast MCR train to with connections beyond. Although not serving Keekle, two Saturdays Only trains left at 16:05 and 21:35 for Workington, calling at Distington and High Harrington, with balancing workings leaving Workington at 15:30 and 21:00. There were also trains using the Lowca Light Railway plying between and Workington, but they served no \\"pure\\" C&WJR; stations other than Workington Central. As with advertised passenger trains, in 1920 workmen's trains ran on the company's three southern routes: * between Workington Central and Lowca using the Lowca Light Railway * between (Rowrah's \\"other station\\") and on the single track \\"Baird's Line\\", and * on the \\"main line\\" between Siddick Junction and Moor Row ** from Siddick Junction to Moor Row, calling at all passenger stations except , calling at instead ** from Moor Row to , calling at Cleator Moor and Keekle Colliers' Platform. The situation in 1922 was similar. The 1920 Working Time Table shows relatively few Goods trains, none of which called at Keekle. Mineral traffic was an altogether different matter, dwarfing all other traffic in volume, receipts and profits. The key source summarises it \\"...the 'Track of the Ironmasters' ran like a main traffic artery through an area honeycombed with mines, quarries and ironworks.\\" The associated drama was all the greater because all the company's lines abounded with steep inclines and sharp curves, frequently requiring banking. The saving grace was that south of Workington at least, most gradients favoured loaded trains. During the First World War especially, the company ran \\"Double Trains\\", akin to North American practice, with two mineral trains coupled together and a banking engine behind, i.e. locomotive-wagons-guards van-locomotive-wagons- guards van-banker. Such trains worked regularly between and , passing the halt as they did so, full tilt up the 1 in 70 northbound. The practice was discontinued after dark from 1 April 1918. The workings at Keekle Colliers' Platform exemplified the line's role, enabling coke and coal to be won and carried from a remote site to industries near and far. Like any business tied to one or few industries, the railway was at the mercy of trade fluctuations and technological change. The Cumberland iron industry led the charge in the nineteenth century, but became less and less competitive as time passed and local ore became worked out and harder to win, taking the fortunes of the railway with it. The peak year was 1909, when 1,644,514 tons of freight were handled. Ominously for the line, that tonnage was down to just over 800,000 by 1922, bringing receipts of £83,349, compared with passenger fares totalling £6,570. Rundown and closure The high water mark for the line's tonnage was 1909, the high water mark for progress was 1913, with the opening of the Harrington and Lowca line for passenger traffic. A chronology of the line's affairs from 1876 to 1992 has almost no entries before 1914 which fail to include \\"opened\\" or \\"commenced\\". After 1918 the position was reversed, when the litany of step-by-step closures and withdrawals was relieved only by a control cabin and a signalbox being erected in 1919 and the Admiralty saving the northern extension in 1937 by establishing an armaments depot at Broughton. The halt probably closed in 1923. The line past the site of the platform closed in 1963 and was subsequently lifted. Afterlife By 2013 Keekle Terrace and the trackbed through the Platform were readily visible on satellite imagery, especially the striking Keekle Viaduct a short distance to the south.

Synopsis  In 1927, a railway was being built through northern Manitoba in order to ship grain from the Prairies to Europe via Hudson Bay. In that year, N. B. McLean, a Department of Marine and Fisheries official, led an expedition to Ungava Bay and Hudson Strait to undertake an aerial survey of the strait to study ice conditions and determine how long the annual navigation season might be for ocean-going freighters. Royal Canadian Air Force Squadron Leader Thomas A. Lawrence, in charge of air operations for the 1927-28 expedition, was responsible for the six RCAF pilots and their six Fokker Universal aircraft. A total of 44 men, 22 being military personnel, made up the group of mechanics, riggers, wireless engineers, storekeepers, cooks and doctors, essentially every trade needed for a major Arctic expedition. From Halifax, Nova Scotia, the expedition set out on July 17, 1927, on the CGS Stanley icebreaker, accompanied by the supply ship S.S. Larch, carrying 25 tons of general cargo and 27 tons of coal. Their first stop was Port Burwell, where men and supplies were dropped off to set up an outpost. Two other posts were set up on Nottingham Island and at Wakeham Bay. At each location, prefabricated buildings were constructed that included barracks for housing, storehouses, a radio shack and hangars for the aircraft. The challenges of flying in Arctic conditions meant that the Fokker Universals flew on pontoons during the short spring and summer, and then converted to skis for the fall and winter months. Constant attention to snowdrifts that might trap the men and equipment and keeping runways and waterways clear meant that in the 14-month operation proceeded slowly. One of the main advantages was the use of Inuit supplies of parkas and clothing that were much better suited to the Arctic than regulation clothing provided by the RCAF. Inuit hunters also acted as guides and accompanied the pilot and mechanic (who also acted as a photographer) aboard each aircraft. The Inuit guides proved particularly important when one aircraft went down on an ice floe, and the crew only managed to get back safely after a 13-day ordeal by following the guidance of the Inuit hunter, who was able to provide not only food but shelter for the trek. When the expedition completed its work, over 2,000 photographs had been taken of the region in the course of 227 patrols. The work of the aviators provided invaluable information needed to ensure the future of navigation in Hudson Strait. Production The 1927-28 Arctic expedition to Ungava Bay and Hudson Strait was documented by the RCAF, with the film footage providing the basis of the NFB documentary film.Fleming 1957, p. 88.

Using the voice writing method, a court reporter speaks directly into a stenomask or speech silencer—a hand-held mask containing one or two microphones and voice-dampening materials. As the reporter repeats the testimony into the recorder, the mask prevents the reporter from being heard during testimony. Purpose and function Voice writers can be used to record everything that is said by judges, witnesses, attorneys, and other parties to a proceeding, including gestures and emotional reactions, and either provide real-time feed or prepare transcripts afterwards. In medical transcription, some transcriptionists use voice writing, versus typing, when working out of their own home. They receive audio files and use a voice recognition program to translate voice to text. No mask is needed, but a good headset with appropriate microphone is necessary. Sometimes an updated sound card needs to be added in order to have excellent clarity for the voice recognition software. This can be done easily with a small sound card which is attached to the microphone cord and then inserts into a USB port. A foot pedal is also used. A voice writing system consists of a stenomask, an external sound digitizer, a laptop, speech recognition software. A foot pedal can plug into a computer's USB port. A real-time voice writer's words go through the mask's cable to an external USB digital signal processor, From there the words go into the computer's speech recognition engine, for conversion into streaming text. The reporter can send the streamed text to a) the Internet; b) a computer file; c) a television station for subtitling; d) to an end-user who is reading the captions via their laptop, tablet, smart phone, or e) software which formats the results in a way most familiar to judges, attorneys, or subtitling consumers. Voice writers enjoy very high accuracy rates, based upon pure physiology. The route taken by a person's words goes from the mouth to the reporter's ear, brain, and \\"inner\\" voice. This form of repetition is naturally effortless; it is what we all do in our daily conversation, as we listen to a person speak, or when we read a book. So the most natural extension of this process is to psychologically switch the repetition mechanism from \\"inner voice\\" to the physiological \\"spoken voice.\\" Therefore, we minimize the introduction of cognitive overhead in our task of routing the spoken word to its permanent destination as printed words. This streamlined process allows voice writers to achieve excellent performance for many continuous hours and greater than 98 percent accuracy at speeds as high as 350 words per minute. Voice writers produce the same products as their stenotype colleagues, including transcripts in all electronic and printed formats. Realtime verbatim reporters connect their laptops to captioning equipment, real-time viewer programs, and provide attorneys or other clients with computer files at the end of the sessions. Only the physical way of capturing speakers' words differentiates voice writing from other methods of court reporting. Every other aspect of this profession is the same, with the exception of the time required to learn the skill, which is much shorter with voice writing. Voice writing method The method of court reporting known as voice writing, formerly called \\"stenomask,\\" was developed by Horace Webb in the World War II era. Prior to inventing voice writing, Webb was a Gregg shorthand writer. Gregg shorthand is a multi-level process in which the reporter records the proceedings using shorthand, then dictates from his notes into a tape recorder. The dictation process alone requires two hours for every one hour of testimony. After the testimony is transferred to audio tape, a transcriptionist types out an official documentation of the proceedings. Mr. Webb wanted to create a reporting method that allowed court reporters to dictate directly during proceedings, eliminating the shorthand process altogether. Horace Webb and two colleagues spent several years designing the stenomask and perfecting the voicewriting method. The court reporter speaks directly into the stenomask – a handheld mask with a voice silencer. The silencer prevents the court reporter from disturbing proceedings while repeating everything that occurs during testimony -– even unspoken answers, gestures and reactions. Unfortunately, the voicewriting method did not catch on until the method was tested by the U.S. Navy and adopted by the military justice school in Newport, Rhode Island. From then on, the stenomask method of court reporting gained widespread acceptance. Voice writers have long been available to make the record through the use of a stenomask with a voice silencer and analog tapes. Voice writers not only repeat every word stated by the attorneys, witnesses, judges and other parties to a proceeding but also verbally identify the speaker. They even punctuate the text, describe activities as they take place, and, in some cases, mark exhibits. Now, however, new technologies are available to them. Digital recording offers a clearer, better-defined soundtrack, making transcription easier and even more accurate. New technology, in the form of speech recognition CAT systems, affords the voice writer the opportunity to have the spoken words instantly turned into text on a laptop computer or computer workstation. As a result, the voice writer is now able to produce real-time text feeds within the courtroom and download them in ASCII format for distribution immediately following a proceeding. The equipment used by real-time voice writers can also interface with all litigation-support software. Training All court reporters require the same basic academic background, regardless of method. This includes legal and medical language, business law, and English. The skills track is where the methods diverge. A voice writing student can become real-time certifiable well within the 24-month associate degree window. Paralegals and legal secretaries, because they’ve already taken nearly the same set of core academics required by court reporting, can become proficient in three to six months. In under 12 months, a paralegal or legal secretary can become real-time certified.

The company provides information and financial services.  History  Global Growth was founded as Eli Global by Greg Lindberg. The conglomerate operated as an information and financial services company. In 2012 Lindberg began investigating the possibility of acquiring insurance companies, displaying a particular interest in the large number of assets retained by such companies to fulfill payouts. In 2014 Eli Global made its first insurance acquisition when it purchased a burial-policy insurer based in Alabama. Lindberg wished to loan the insurer's assets to other businesses he owned, but the number of the company's assets he could invest in affiliated enterprises was restricted by Alabama state laws. Lindberg then relocated the insurer to North Carolina, where regulations on such practices were vaguer, and began trading the burial-policy insurer's investments in treasury bonds for large loans in his own companies. Though North Carolina regulators usually enforced a cap of affiliated investments on insurers at 10% of their assets, the North Carolina Department of Insurance reached a special agreement with Lindberg, allowing his burial-policy insurer to invest as much as 40% of its assets in affiliates, though this limit was also eventually breached. In 2015 and 2016 Lindberg acquired more insurers and grouped them together as the Global Bankers Insurance Group. As a result of the insurer acquisitions, Eli Global became markedly more profitable. Lindberg ultimately loaned about $2 billion from the insurance companies he had acquired to other affiliated corporations. By 2019 he had acquired over 100 companies. In March 2019 Lindberg was indicted by United States federal authorities for bribery. He subsequently relinquished his daily managerial responsibilities at Eli Global. On June 27 the North Carolina Department of Insurance placed several Eli Global insurance companies into \\"rehabilitation\\", citing concerns about their liquidity and ability to meet their obligations to policy holders. In September 2019 Lindberg resigned as the company's chief executive officer and its name was changed to Global Growth, though he remained its sole owner. George Vandeman was appointed chairman of the company. Following the disclosure of Linbderg's legal troubles and those of some Global Growth companies, some of the subsidiaries were sued by other corporations for failure to uphold business agreements.

Biography He was born in Botzen and became one of Jacob Stainer's best pupils. The tone of his violins, which are generally very high in the belly and have a dark red, almost brown, varnish, is more remarkable for power than for quality. His son, also named Mathias, was at first a pupil of his father, afterwards of the Amatis at Cremona, and finally settled at Rome. His best violins, which by some connoisseurs are considered hardly inferior to those of the Amatis, are dated at the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th century. A third Albani, whose given name is not known, lived during the 17th century at Palermo. He also made good violins, which resemble those of the old German makers.

The flood also affected some other nearby areas in Colfax County that morning, including highways and small towns around Philmont. One youth Scout, Alden Brock, who was situated in a campsite within the staff camp Indian Writings, drowned while being swept away by the flood. The flood also had a significant impact on many individual crews and treks and significantly damaged some campsites. The 2015 flash flood is the largest documented flood in the history of Philmont, and is the only flood at Philmont that has ever caused the death of a person. Background Throughout much of the summer of 2015, parts of New Mexico were experiencing a monsoon season, likely due to an El Niño. Throughout the season, there had been many other flash flood warnings across New Mexico due to large storms. Fifty years before the 2015 flood, on June 17, 1965, a similar flash flood had occurred at Philmont Scout Ranch. Flood On the night of June 26, the night before the flood, there were reports of hail and light rain in some areas of Philmont. On the early hours of the morning of June 27, the rain became heavier. Around 3:30A.M., the National Weather Service issued a statement highlighting the threat of a flash flood in the area. At around 4:30A.M., a flash flood, with water levels of over 20 feet at the highest, occurred in several areas of Philmont. Some reported loud thunder and nearby lightning strikes before and during the flood. Outside of Philmont, there had been reports of mudflows and flooding along U.S. Route 64. Boulders also tumbled down from canyons in the Cimarron area, causing damage to and blockage of roads. Death of Alden Brock The morning of June 27, when the flood occurred, Crew 380 from Sacramento, California, was entering the third day of their twelve-day trek. They were situated at a campsite in Indian Writings near North Ponil Canyon that was about 20 feet above a small portion of Ponil Creek. Troop 606, from Irving, TX, had recently camped at Ponil Canyon the night before, bringing the rising rivers to staff members attention. Four members of Crew 380, including 13 year-old Alden Brock, the ranger assisting the crew, and two other youth Scouts were swept away by the flood from their campsite at about 4:30am. The New Mexico State Police arrived at around 9:35am on a search and rescue mission. The two Scouts and the ranger were quickly located but not Brock. They found Brock dead at around 11:00am, approximately one mile away from the location from which he was originally swept. Crew 380 decided to finish their trek despite the incident in honor of Brock. Brock's death received nationwide attention, particularly from the Scouting community; fatalities are exceedingly rare at Philmont, and this was the only flood-related fatality in Philmont's history. Aftermath Excessive brush accumulated as a result of the flood. Shortly after the incident, Philmont staff notified the families of Scouts involved in the flood. Many crews at Philmont associated with the flood were temporarily withheld by Philmont staff until further notice because of logistical issues and because of significant damage to trails. Philmont and the New Mexico State Police also offered counseling for those involved in the flood. Many crews affected by the flood had lost many necessary items, such as tents, backpacks, and other camping gear. Several trails and bridges were also severely damaged by the flood. Because of debris, mudflows, and road blockage, a large portion of U.S. Route 64 in New Mexico was closed for a period of nearly one full day. Crews affected by the flood were given the opportunity to choose whether they were to continue their treks or to leave Philmont. Some crews decided to leave Philmont, while many decided to continue their treks. The New Mexico State Police investigated the flood further with the intent of providing more information to improve future preparedness, but came to no conclusions. The investigators believed that the incident could not have easily been prevented.

She wrote symphonies, oratorios, operas, and chamber works, with some of her early works appearing under the pseudonym Frank Donnell. During her career as a professional violinist, she performed the world premiere of Béla Bartók's Violin Sonata No. 1 and also worked with Arnold Schoenberg. Early life and education Mary Frances Dorothea Dickenson was born in Dublin, Ireland, to a well-connected Irish family. Her mother was Mary Frances MacDonnell, the daughter of Hercules Henry Graves MacDonnell, a rector of Trinity College and cofounder of the Royal Irish Academy of Music. Her great-grandfather was Richard MacDonnell, a provost of Trinity College, and her great-uncles included Major-General Arthur Robert MacDonnell and Richard Graves MacDonnell, a governor of South Australia. Her father was Augustus Maximilian Newton Dickenson, a doctor of medicine. Her father died in 1883, and her mother moved the family to Wiesbaden, Germany, where she received her first violin lessons at the age of six. Against the wishes of her family, she moved to London around 1897–98, where she briefly studied with composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor at the Croydon Conservatory of Music and performed his Gypsy Suite, Op. 20 (1898). She may also have studied composition with him, and he dedicated at least one of his subsequent works to her. On returning to Dublin, she worked briefly as an assistant at the Royal Irish Academy of Music. She then returned to London, still against her family's wishes, to study at the Royal Academy of Music for three years, with the violinist and composer Émile Sauret as her primary teacher. She took her final exams in 1902 in violin and organ performance and in composition. To strengthen her left-hand technique, she then moved to Prague to study for two years with the Czech violinist Otakar Ševčík. Career as performer and composer In 1905, Dickenson-Auner made her debut with the Czech Philharmonic. This launched her on a career lasting most of a decade as a touring concert player who performed all around Europe. She also had her first compositions published under the pseudonym Frank Donnell. In 1909 she settled in Vienna, Austria, living at first with her mother and then with her husband, the diplomat Michael Auner, whom she married in 1913. They moved to Transylvania and had two children, Moira and Michael. In 1917, towards the end of World War I, when Auner was drafted into the army, the couple fled with their children to Bussum in the Netherlands. There her playing was well received by Dutch music critics. Throughout this period, she gave music lessons to help support the family; one of her pupils was the American author Helen Nearing. In 1920, Dickenson-Auner and her family were able to move back to Vienna, and in 1922, she played the world premiere of Béla Bartók's Violin Sonata No. 1, Op. 21 with pianist Eduard Steuermann at the Konzerthaus there. Her performance was well-received, and that same summer, she presented the work with Bartók himself at the newly founded International Chamber Music Performances in Salzburg. She also joined Arnold Schoenberg's private music performance group and gave concerts under his direction. In 1925, Dickenson- Auner developed an educational concept for a new kind of 'listening lesson' (Hörstunden) to help train the ears of children through a practical and theoretical introduction to the world of selected composers. It was tested in cooperation with the Vienna School Board, and by 1938 had extended to 17 schools. However, when the Nazis seized power in 1938, Dickenson-Auner was banned from these activities due to her British citizenship. Now almost 60 and amicably divorced from Auner (since 1934), she decided to devote herself exclusively to composing music. Over the next quarter-century, Dickenson-Auner wrote six symphonies, four operas, and two oratorios, as well as numerous songs and chamber music works. From 1946 to 1962, her chamber works were presented in twelve concerts. Three of her symphonies had their world premiere broadcast by the Austrian Broadcasting Corporation. Dickenson-Auner wrote polyphonic compositions that combined her love of Johann Sebastian Bach with the 12-tone music of Schoenberg. In choosing musical motifs, however, she often reached back to the Irish folk tunes of her early years, terming the resulting compositions \\"Celtic Impressionism\\". She wrote some of her lyrics herself, but she also used selections from the Irish poet William Butler Yeats and from writers influenced by the ideas of the Theosophical Society, of which she had been a member since 1938. She died in Vienna. Selected works * Irish Symphony, Op. 16 (1941) ReferencesOther sources *Dreyfus, Kay, Margarethe Engelhardt-Krajanek, and Barbara Bold: Die Geige war ihr Leben.

They were declared a conservation area in May 1980. The two estates were influenced by Ebenezer Howard's Garden city movement and the Arts and Crafts movement, which high quality external detailing and an open setting with privet hedges, front gardens and wide grass verges. Location The estates are in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, in the west of London, lying either side of the A40 Westway to the south of Wormwood Scrubs. To the west they are bounded by Old Oak Road and to the east partially by Bloemfontain Road. The southern boundary extends to include Wormholt Park. The London Underground Central line passes through the estates. The station is called East Acton tube station. History Braybrook Street on the Old Oak Estate London County Council bought the from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners in 1905, were resold to the Great Western Railway for the Ealing to Shepherds Bush branch line. The Old Oak estate was built in two phases: west of East Acton station and the railway in 1912–13, and east in 1920–23. The final fourteen houses were added in 1927. The land for the Wormholt Estate was purchased from the same source in 1919. In 1926–28 LCC built 783 houses and Hammersmith Council added 500 houses on the adjoining . Plans for 37 shops were dropped but both the Hammersmith Open Air Swimming Pool and Wormholt Park were both constructed. The estates were designated conservation areas in May 1940. An Article 4 Direction, taking away certain PD Rights (permitted development rights) to preserve aspects of the character of the estate, has been issued. Design The estate was designed by the LCC's Architects' Department Housing of the Working Classes branch, particularly A S Soutar, F J Lucas, and J M Corment, using Hampstead Garden Suburb as a reference. The Hampstead Garden Suburb Act 1906 had freed Raymond Unwin, the architect, from the gridiron street pattern imposed by the Public Health Act 1875, and this had been extended to all estates by the Town Planning Act 1909. As planned the estate was to contain 1527 houses, referred to as cottages, built at a density of . The first 304 cottages and five shops had been completed by January 1914, and the drainage and sewers laid for the rest when the war halted construction. . Each of the cottages and maisonettes had a scullery and the WC but only the cottages of five and four rooms and 14 of the three-roomed cottages were fitted with baths. The cottages were built in small terraces from red brick. They shared a common style but were deliberately different from each other. The Arts and Crafts style was applied to the roofing; which predominantly was red tiles but from different sources to vary the texture. Some roofs used a hand made Belgian peg tile which is very difficult to match when repairs are needed. The Conservation Areas Design guidelines explain that \\"privet hedging, grass verges, street trees and the provision of small cottage gardens\\" and \\"the widespread use of wooden mullioned window frames (both sash and casement), brick façades, pitched and gabled roofs, small dormers and panelled doors reinforce the cottage character of the estates\\". =Article 4 Direction= There is requirement to obtain planning consent for proposed changes to: #Roofs – form or materials #Facades – Painting, rendering or cladding – removal or changes to the string courses or arches #Existing rendering – any change of colour #Proposed hardstanding for vehicles #Porches #Gates, Walls and hedges #Extension #Windows – form, colour or material #Doorways The presumption is always against change.

The art form of card flourishing, commonly referred to as cardistry (a portmanteau of card and artistry), grew out of simple flourishes used in close-up magic by magicians in the 1990s to early 2000s. Chris Kenner's notable two-handed Sybil cut from his 1992 publication Totally Out of Control has carried great influence and gave birth to a series of advanced flourishes which today represents the foundation of the performance art. Sleight of hand pioneers Dan and Dave Buck popularized cardistry on the world stage with their instructional DVD releases from 2004 and 2007. Journalist Kevin Pang of Vanity Fair characterized the art of card flourishing as, \\"It's yo-yo tricks performed by cardsharps with the street cred of a Parkour video. There's a name for it: cardistry.\\" Roots in magic When conjuring tricks with playing cards became popular around the 19th century, magicians would often include card flourishes in their performances to demonstrate their sleight of hand abilities. Unlike tricks, flourishes were intended to be visually impressive and appear difficult to perform. Some of the first flourishes to be documented include the Charlier Cut, Riffle Shuffle and Thumb Fan. Several sleight of hand bestsellers, such as S. W. Erdnase's The Expert at the Card Table from 1902 (which shared roots in gambling and cheating at cards), emphasized the importance of incorporating flourishes into tricks. Up until the 2000s, card flourishing were considered a mere subsection of close-up magic and not an independent performance art.Pang, Kevin (21 April 2015). \\"72 Hours Inside the Eye-Popping World of Cardistry\\". Vanity Fair. Retrieved 14 January 2016. Cardistry is a portmanteau of \\"card\\" and \\"artistry\\". It involves the use of hands to create cuts, displays, fans, patterns and sequences through the use of playing cards. Various armspreads, cuts, shuffles and springs can be used. The intent is to create a captivating motion and beautiful display. The effects are limited only by the types of card used, the imagination, and the degree of manual dexterity of the performer. The presentation is typically neither \\"illusionary\\" nor purportedly \\"magic\\". At least in part, the color and form of cards affect visual perceptions of the act. The visual style of the art form is often associated or compared to juggling, hackey-sack, mimes and even skateboarding. Five Faces of Sybil The ending face of Chris Kenner's Sybil flourish displaying five packets using all fingers. In 1992, American magician David Copperfield and producer Chris Kenner published Totally Out of Control, a successful instructional book explaining magic effects with playing cards and other household objects. Among the many sleights featured was a two-handed card flourish on page 125 called \\"The Five Faces of Sybil\\". Using all fingers, Sybil ends with the deck divided into five distinct packets. Kenner himself describes Sybil in his book as \\"a quick cut flourish to demonstrate skill and dexterity\\". The flourish spawned a cycle of two-handed cut creations and formed the cornerstone of what is now known as cardistry. Journalist Kevin Pang of Vanity Fair magazine noted that \\"every cardist can deftly perform Sybil the way guitarists can run through a blues progression\\". An art form Los Angeles-based magician Brian Tudor was one of many performers heavily influenced by Sybil. In 1997, he released a three-volume VHS tape dubbed Show Off, one of the first instructional products made by a known magician to only feature flourishes. Tudor's tape was well received, with some critics describing the flourishes and cuts taught as \\"eye-popping\\". The most notable invention from Show Off was the one-handed Revolution Cut, a variation of the common Charlier, where the top packet spins an additional 180 degrees. In 2001, twin brothers and Sybil enthusiasts Daniel and David Buck (known as Dan and Dave) released Pasteboard Animations, another flourish-only instructional VHS tape. Although produced as a low-fi home video and relatively short compared to Show Off, it sold hundreds of copies at hotel lobbies and magic conventions at a cost of $25. In a Genii magazine review of the Magic Live convention in August 2001, the twins flourishes and Pasteboard Animations tape received mixed responses. Renowned magic historian Jamy Ian Swiss remarked: In spite of the mixed responses from the traditional magic scene, Dan and Dave continued with their cardistry creations. In 2004, with the help of Kenner, the twins released an instructional DVD on cardistry named The Dan and Dave System. The System is perceived as having officially separated advanced card flourishing from card magic and defined the style of cardistry. Filmed with digital movie cameras at film studios and professional edited, the critically praised $30 DVD inspired thousands of sleight of hand artists all over the world to embark on cardistry. Four years later, the twins released a three- disc DVD set known as The Trilogy, showcasing some of the most comprehensive and difficult flourishes ever created. Retailing at $85 per copy, The Trilogy is the bestselling cardistry release of all time, having sold more than 25,000 units. Pang wrote that just about every cardist lists either the System or The Trilogy as the reason they got into card flourishing. In a 2015 interview, Singaporean cardist Kevin Ho mentioned that cardistry grew in popularity during the 2000s because of promotion through social media and journalistic coverage. Another cardist from Singapore, Huron Low, explained: Cardistry convention In response to the growing cardistry community, Dan and Dave organized the first cardistry convention and interactive conference to promote the performance art in 2014, called Cardistry-Con. The convention saw interviews, panel discussions, live performances, exclusive video screenings, workshops, contests and giveaways.Choe, Ivan (12 April 2015). \\"Cardistry: Cardistry-Con, New York Day 2\\". Kardify. Retrieved 14 January 2016. The 2015 convention was attended by journalists from magazines such as Vanity Fair and Wired as well as television stations, all of which helped further popularize cardistry as an art. Its growth has been associated with its availability with the availability of videos, lessons and podcasts, which tend to make the art more transparent and available to all who are interested. Tools Decks of playing cards are an essential part of the cardist's tools. Ordinary paper playing cards will do, but some cardists believe that the cards used should be particularly adapted to the task, and so qualities such as flexibility, stickiness, colors, and the artwork on the front and back of the cards can vary. Decks are now being created exclusively to be used for cardistry, and some of these can be relatively expensive. Some commonly known name brands in popular cardistry videos include The Virts, School Of Cardistry, Anyone Worldwide, and Fontaines. Other cardists prefer older, grimier cards, sometimes called \\"poop decks\\".

The Act enabled the introduction of private prisons to the United Kingdom, attempted to reform the system of fines in England and Wales, established HM Inspectorate of Probation as a statutory body, and allowed for the Home Secretary to release foreign prisoners from prison to enable their deportation. It remains in force with many of its provisions amended by subsequent Criminal Justice Acts.  History  The Conservative MP John Greenway attempted to have the Act amended during its passage to introduce the death penalty for the murder of a police officer.  Provisions = Early Removal Scheme = The Act mode provision for an Early Removal Scheme. Under the Scheme, the Home Secretary can release foreign national prisoners early from prison where they were subject to deportation or administrative removal. The Scheme is currently regulated by the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and was modified in 2008 by Statutory Instrument to reduce the qualifying period before a prisoner could be released for deportation. = Unit fines = Section 18 made provision for fines to be imposed using a mathematical formula that took into account the seriousness of the crime and the offenders ability to pay. This was subject to criticism from magistrates and others for imposing significant fines on wealthier individuals for minor offences, and insignificant fines on poorer individuals for more serious offences. Eventually, Kenneth Clarke introduced the Criminal Justice Act 1993 to remove the system of unit fines. = Drug rehabilitation = Schedule 1A6 made provision for attendance at drug treatment for an offender on probation who suffered from alcohol or drug dependence. = HM Inspectorate of Probation = Section 73 placed HM Inspectorate of Probation on a statutory footing. = Private prisons = Sections 84 to 88 made it possible for the establishment of private prisons in England and Wales.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Thomas Creek – Gilkey Covered Bridge in 1987. Carrying Goar Road, the bridge crosses Thomas Creek about southwest of Scio. Gilkey Bridge and a covered railroad bridge next to it crossed the creek at the former community of Gilkey. Gilkey was a station on the Southern Pacific Railway line between Crabtree and Shelburn. The station, established in 1880, was named for Allen and William Gilkey. Allen Gilkey came to Oregon in the early 1850s and settled nearby. The bridge, long, was constructed in 1939. Damaged by an overloaded vehicle in 1997, it was closed for repairs, then reopened to traffic in 1998. Just nine years later, the bridge was damaged again. Scot McKillop, an employee of Fisher Implements, left a service call at a nearby farm and was enroute to Albany when he started to cross the bridge. The hydraulic boom, which had been left extended, snapped power lines before it crashed into the bridge cover. The truck traveled three-quarters of the way across the bridge where it stopped, stuck sideways. There were no injuries, the truck was moved in about 5 hours, and the bridge lost about 50% of its load capacity. The bridge was rehabilitated in 2017 in a $1.6 million project.

It was erected in the 6th century. On September 30, 1986, the diocese was suppressed, and its territory merged into the Diocese of Nardò- Gallipoli.\\"Diocese of Gallipoli\\" Catholic-Hierarchy.org. David M. Cheney. Retrieved January 15, 2016.\\"Diocese of Gallipoli\\" GCatholic.org. Gabriel Chow. Retrieved January 14, 2016. History In the Synecdemus of Hierocles of the time of the Emperor Justinian (527–565), Gallipoli is listed as a suffragan bishopric of the metropolitan of Sancta Severina. Kehr, p. 428. At the end of the century, however, it is clear from letters of Pope Gregory I (590–604) that the bishop of Gallipoli was subject to his jurisdiction.Kehr, pp. 428-429. In 663, following the defeat of the Byzantine armada of Constans II at Benevento, which was trying to destroy the Lombard duchy of Benevento, the Lombards took control of southeastern Italy and became overlords of Gallipoli. Previous to that date, Gallipoli had been part of the Byzantine empire.Ravenna, pp. 155-156. The Lombards also finally destroyed the city of Ravenna in 751, and the Exarchate of Ravenna ceased to exist. The surviving Greek territories were grouped under the Theme of Sicily, governed by a Strategos. A letter of Pope Adrian I (772–795) indicates that Gallipoli belonged to that Byzantine theme.Ravenna, pp. 157-159. When the Lombards were driven out in the Byzantine reconquest of southern Italy, the Church of Gallipoli returned to its obedience to the Greek Metropolitan of Santa Severina. This is the situation in the Diatyposis of Leo IV (c. 900). Cf. Kehr, p. 408. The attacks of the Normans in the area began in 1055. The Greeks were forced to withdraw from Apulia, and Gallipoli was incorporated by the Normans of Sicily in 1071. Duke Roger granted Apulia to his brother Bohemund, who became the prince of Taranto and lord of Gallipoli.Ravenna, pp. 171-172. This brought Gallipoli back into contact with the Roman Church. The Liber Censuum of the Roman Church, which was compiled beginning in 1192, includes the diocese of Gallipoli as a suffragan of the archdiocese of Otranto. In the archdiocese of Otranto, payments are owed by the Church of S. Maria de Nardò, and by the monastery of S. Nicolas de Casulis. With regard to Gallipoli, there is only the note \\"Est Graecus\\". The adjective Graecus requires a noun of the masculine gender,Thus dioecesis (feminine}, ecclesia (feminine) and monasterium (neuter) are excluded. A possibility might be ritus (masculine), but the relevance of the Greek rite to payments owed is not clear. probably Episcopus. Elsewhere in the Liber Censuum there are entries for sums owed by individual bishops. Unfortunately the names and status of individual bishops of Gallipoli at the end of the 12th and first quarter of the 13th centuries are unknown. The city of Gallipoli was completely destroyed by Charles of Anjou, King of Naples (1266–1285), and for a considerable time remained desolate. The abbot of S. Maria di Nardò exercised jurisdiction over the territory.Ravenna, pp. 430-431. Ravenna claims that the time interval was more than a century. But a new bishop was approved by the Holy See within 70 years. Gallipoli was nonetheless in danger, due to the Great Western Schism. In 1379, the Avignon pope, Clement VII, created the diocese of Nardò, with a bishop who had been the Abbot of S. Maria di Nardò. He was driven out in 1401 and the diocese was suppressed. But then in 1413, Pope John XXIII, who ruled in Rome, created a new diocese of Nardò in 1413, and again chose the Abbot of S. Maria di Nardò to be its bishop. In these transactions, Gallipoli lost the towns of Copertino, Galatone, Secli, Nohe, Neviano, Tuglie, Parabita, Alliste, Felline, Taviano, and Casarano, and its bishops had to spend the rest of the century defending their episcopal mensa ('property').Ravenna, pp. 430-431. In 1463, Bishop Lodovico Spinelli obtained from the Prince of Taranto the grant of a tenth part of the baglia of Gallipoli. His successor Bishop Alfonso Spinelli obtained from King Ferdinand I the grant of a fifteenth of all the money paid into the royal customs collection agency (dogana) in Gallipoli.Ravenna, p. 433. On 26 December 1805, Napoleon I, King of Italy, and Emperor of the French, declared Ferdinand IV deposed, and replaced him with his own brother Joseph Bonaparte on 30 March 1806. Bonaparte brought with him to Naples the policies of the French Republic and Napoleonic empire, including the abolition of all traces of feudalism, financial reform through the abolition of old taxes (like the salt tax, and the dogana) and the abolition of tax farming, and the imposition of the Code Napoleon. Bishop Giovanni Dalla Croce (1792–1820) was arrested, and imprisoned in Lecce for a period of eight months.Ravenna, p. 502. By a law of 13 February 1807, all of the houses of Benedictines or Cistercians were suppressed, and their property confiscated by the State, to be used for pensions to subsidize the transition of the monks to the condition of being secular priests. The mendicant orders were allowed to survive, and were assigned to teach in elementary schools. Property which had belonged to the suppressed Society of Jesus was confiscated, sold, and the money applied to the Monti di pietà. Any feudal dues or obligations which might have been attached to the property were abolished.Sclopis, p. 522. =Chapter and cathedral= Cathedral of S. Agata The original cathedral was dedicated to S. John Chrysostom, probably indicating a Greek origin. A dedication to S. Agatha was added, when her relics were acquired in 1126.Ravenna, pp. 316-326. The current cathedral was begun in 1629 by Bishop Consalvo de Rueda, with money supplied by the testament of the Chief Physician of Sicily, Giovanni Giacomo Lazari, a native of Gallipoli. The architects were Francesco Bischetimi and Scipione Lachibari.Ravenna, p. 327. The stone façade was completed by Bishop Antonio della Lastra in 1696.Ravenna, p. 336. The choir was finished and roofed, the high altar was placed, and decorations were installed by Bishop Orazio Filomarini, and dedicated on 1 May 1726.Ravenna, p. 335. The tower received a bell in 1744, a second in 1790, and a third in 1804.Ravenna, p. 336. The cathedral was administered by a corporation of clergy called a Chapter. When the cathedral was in the hands of the Greeks, the Chapter was composed of two dignities (the Archpriest and the Archdeacon) and twelve Canons.Cataldi, p. 252 column 1. Under the Roman rite, introduced by Bishop Alessio Zelodano in 1513,Ravenna, p. 339-341. the Chapter received an additional four Canons, making a corporation of eighteen members. Later, it was composed of ten dignities and nine Canons.Ravenna, p. 342. The dignities were: the Archdeacon, the Archpriest, the Dean, the Cantor, the Provost, the Treasurer, the first Primicerius, the second Primicerius, and the vice- Treasurer.Cappelletti, p. 328. In 1679 and in 1747, there were seven dignities and nine Canons.Ritzler-Sefrin, Hierarchia catholica V, p. 208, note 1; VI, p. 222, note 1. The erection of a seminary was begun in 1751, by Bishop Serafino Branconi (1747–1759), the brother of Marchese Branconi, Secretary of State of the Kingdom of Naples. It stood next to the episcopal palace and was connected to it by internal passages. It had accommodations for thirty students. Shortly after the seminary was completed (1759), the Bishop's brother died, and the Bishop chose to resign. He reserved to himself an annual pension of 800 ducats, which he ordered to be distributed to the poor.Ravenna, p. 495-496. Bishop Antonio La Scala (27 Sep 1852 – 27 Sep 1858) conducted a diocesan synod in the cathedral from 18–20 March 1855. =End of the independent diocese= On 18 February 1984, the Vatican and the Italian State signed a new and revised concordat, which was accompanied in the next year by enabling legislation. According to the agreement, the practice of having one bishop govern two separate dioceses at the same time, aeque personaliter, was abolished. Otherwise Nardò and Gallipoli might have shared a bishop, as the Bishop of Nardo e Gallipoli. Instead, the Vatican continued consultations which had begun under Pope John XXIII for the merging of small dioceses, especially those with personnel and financial problems, into one combined diocese. On 30 September 1986, Pope John Paul II ordered that the dioceses of Nardò and Gallipoli be merged into one diocese with one bishop, with the Latin title Dioecesis Neritonensis-Gallipolitana. The seat of the diocese was to be in Nardò, and the cathedral of Nardò was to serve as the cathedral of the merged diocese. The cathedral in Galllipoli was to become a co-cathedral, and the cathedral Chapter was to be a Capitulum Concathedralis. There was to be only one diocesan Tribunal, in Nardò, and likewise one seminary, one College of Consultors, and one Priests' Council. The territory of the new diocese was to include the territory of the former dioceses of Nardò and of Gallipoli.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 79 (Città del Vaticano 1987), pp. 755-758.

She was arrested by Chinese authorities in 2015 when China initiated the 709 Crackdown against human rights attorneys. She was charged with inciting subversion of state power which is a serious offense in China carrying a life sentence.  Career  Wang is a lawyer with the Fengrui law firm in Beijing. That law firm has been targeted by the government in its crackdown, which arrested two lawyers and one intern there in addition to Wang and her husband, Bao Longjun. Late in 2016, Chinese authorities released Wang Yu on bail after she was almost certainly coerced to give a televised confession in which she denounced her colleagues and suggested that her human rights work was the result of foreign activists out to smear China. “I won't be used by them anymore,” Ms. Wang said in a video published on a Communist Party news site. Her confession followed a pattern similar to those given to Chinese authorities by other lawyers, publishers and human rights activists. Friends said that although released from detention, Wang would still remain under surveillance by Chinese authorities for years and would not be free to come and go as she pleases. Before her conversion to a human rights lawyer, Wang Yu was a business and commercial lawyer until an incident at a Tianjin train station in 2008. At that time she got into an argument with rail employees because she was denied entry onto a train even though she had a ticket. In a bizarre turn of events, she was charged with \\"intentional assault\\" and was imprisoned for more than 2 years. While in prison, she learned how prisoners were mistreated and tortured. When she was released in 2011, her conversion to a human rights lawyer was complete. Since then, she became part of China's human rights movement. Her clients have included Ilham Tohti, a well-known Uyghur intellectual, the women's rights group known as the \\"Feminist Five,\\" and the banned Falun Gong spiritual group. It was her use of social media to champion her causes that eventually led to her arrest on the subversion charges. In 2015, the government's Xinhua News Agency published a piece designed to tarnish her reputation, saying, \\"This arrogant woman with a criminal record turned overnight to a lawyer, blabbering about the rule of law, human rights, and justice, and roaming around under the flag of 'rights defense.'\\" Wang Yu's human rights work is highlighted in the 2016 documentary directed by Nanfu Wang, Hooligan Sparrow. On 4 June 2016, Wang Yu was awarded the 21st prestigious Ludovic Trarieux International Human Rights Prize also called \\"The award given by lawyers to a lawyer\\". On August 6, 2016, the American Bar Association awarded its inaugural International Human Rights Award to Wang Yu, in absentia. “In honoring Wang Yu, we pay tribute to her steadfast commitment to doing this essential work in China. We recognize her important work to protect human rights and to advocate that the Chinese government respect the independence of the judiciary and the legal profession and observe fair trial and due process standards—all principles guaranteed under Chinese and international law and critical to sustaining progress toward rule of law,” said ABA President Paulette Brown.

A fossil site at Předmostí is located near Přerov in the country Moravia of what is today the Czech Republic. The site was discovered in the late 19th century. Excavations were conducted between 1884 and 1930. As the original material was lost. The skeletal remains of the few dozen people from Předmostí are among the most important finds ever made of anatomically modern humans, and are accompanied by items from the Gravettian culture. A major restriction on the opportunities available for extracting information from this Upper Paleolitic population assembly, however, came with the irreparable damage done to the skeletal material during fire at Mikulov castle near the end of the World War II, which almost completely destroyed the entire collection. For many years, the only sources of scientific information relating to the assemblage available were the two-volume work by Jindřich Matiegka (1934 and 1938) and casts made of the skulls of individuals Předmostí 3 and Předmostí 4, and the endocrania of individuals Předmostí 3, 4, 9 and 101, in the collection of Moravian Museum in Brno. A fragment of Predmostí 21's mandible was rediscovered in the Museum of Olomouc. New excavations were conducted. The Předmostí site appears to have been a living area with associated burial ground with some 20 burials, including 15 complete human interments, and portions of five others, representing either disturbed or secondary burials. Cannibalism has been suggested to explain the apparent subsequent disturbance, though it is not widely accepted. The non-human fossils are mostly mammoth. Many of the bones are heavily charred, indicating they were cooked. Other remains include fox, reindeer, ice-age horse, wolf, bear, wolverine, and hare. Remains of three dogs were also found, one of which had a mammoth bone in its mouth. The Předmostí site is dated to between 24,000 and 37,000 years old. The people had robust features indicative of a big-game hunter lifestyle. They also share square eye socket openings found in the French material. Skulls of Předmostí individuals are significantly longer and more robust than of modern Europeans, with thick brow ridges, and prognathism, and show marked sexual dimorphism. They also display a degree of variability.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5608801_Variability_of_the_Upper_Palaeolithic_skulls_from_Predmosti_near_Prerov_Czech_Republic_Craniometric_comparison_with_recent_human_standards  History of research  Předmostí 9 skull, destroyed in 1945 It was here that Jindřich Wankel, and shortly afterwards K.J.

The last film role of Anatoly Solonitsyn.Обзор фильма «Остановился поезд» Before the official premiere the film was shown in spring of 1982 at the Concert Hall of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.  Plot  Late at night, a train accident happens. Four empty lorries suddenly roll down a slope and crash into a passenger train on high velocity. Only driver Timonin's courage, who until recently remained in the cabin of the locomotive and applied the emergency brake, helped to avoid a colossal calamity. However, the driver himself has died. The tragedy is investigated by the detective German Ermakov. In his hotel room Ermakov meets with journalist Igor Malinin, one of the passengers of the ill-fated train. The subject of their conversation, of course, becomes the wreck. Malinin writes an enthusiastic article about the heroism of the driver Timonin but Ermakov, who compiles more and more information, understands that it's not so simple as it seems. The immediate cause of the disaster becomes a chain of seemingly \\"minor\\" violations. Railroad shunter Panteleev ignores instructions and does not put in a second boot, causing the lorries to break away from their parked positions and to roll out toward the passenger train. Head of the depot, Golovanov does not observe protocol and releases a locomotive on the rails with a faulty speed gauge. And the dead driver Timonin absolutely had no right to start his run, without fixing the speed meter. Investigator Ermakov formulates the results of his investigation in a very firm way: there was no heroism, and instead there was a large-scale carelessness that led to the death of a person. But this causes indignation and outright hatred directed towards Ermakov from the public and the leadership of the city, where Timonin lived. Even the journalist Malinin, initially experiencing sympathy to the investigator is indignant towards the behavior of Ermakov.

Later, he served as Chairman of an art society created by a bequest from his friend Arkhip Kuindzhi. He often returned to the area around Kiev to paint landscapes in oils and watercolors. In 1910, he was accused of plagiarism by the tabloid press because one of his paintings was similar to a work by Yakov Brovar (1864–1941). Apparently, the resemblance derived from a photograph taken in the Białowieża Forest, that was later used as a model by both artists, and involved a single, distinctive tree. When this was pointed out, his critics declared that using a photograph for a painting was a form of \\"cheating\\".

Context The case drew attention as one of a number of murders committed by migrants during the European migrant crisis. According to the New York Times, the New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany, \\"resonated in Italy\\", and the police chief of Florence addressed safety worries, \\"assuring the public that Florence remained safe\\" in the wake of the Olsen murder.\\" =Sexual harassment= Olsen's murder was discussed as an example of the sexual harassment that women, especially young, foreign, women face in Italian cities, and of the victim blaming of young, attractive female murder victims for their own deaths. Olsen was killed at a time of rising public concern about miscommunication regarding consent to sexual activity between migrant men and European women, and international attention was focused on the New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany that took place in a number of cities just days before Olsen was killed. In January, Denmark debated a proposal to ban anyone who could not speak Danish, German or English from entering a bar or nightclub, and news discussion of the proposal included the Ashley Ann Olsen case. Victim Olsen was the daughter of Walter and Paula Olsen, of Summer Haven, Florida. She was a 1999 graduate of St. Joseph Academy. She moved to Florence in 2014 after the breakup of her marriage to South African diver Grant Jankielsohn, and with the intention of studying art and in order to live near her father, who teaches at an American school in Florence. She was living in an apartment in the Oltrarno neighborhood of Florence when she was murdered. Murder, investigation and trial Olsen, 35, was found dead in her apartment in the Santo Spirito neighborhood of Florence by her boyfriend, Florentine artist Federico Fiorentini, on 9 January 2016. Marks on her neck indicated that she had been strangled to death. Cheik Tidiane Diaw, a 27-year-old Senegalese national who had recently entered Italy as an illegal immigrant, was arrested for the crime. Witnesses saw the two leave a nightclub in Florence together on 7 January. Security cameras in the street recorded them walking to Olsen's apartment in the early hours of 8 January. After identifying Diaw using security camera footage, police called him in for questioning, arresting him based on DNA evidence. Diaw's attorney, Antonio Voce, said that Diaw and Olsen had consumed cocaine and alcohol. The lead investigator on the case, Giacinto Profazio, was involved in the Meredith Kercher murder case, a case with which Olsen's murder is frequently compared. On 9 February, reexamination of security tapes by authorities showed that suspect Diaw had returned to the apartment on the night of the murder and spent a period of time inside after his first departure from it. Prosecutors asked for a life sentence, the highest penalty available in Italy. =Perpetrator= The murderer, Cheik Diaw is an illegal immigrant from Senegal who arrived in Italy in 2015. According to the prosecutor, DNA analysis of a cigarette butt and a condom found by police investigators in Olsen's bathroom led to Diaw's arrest. Diaw was convicted of murder and sentenced to 30 years in prison. Attorneys acting for the perpetrator appealed the verdict, but the original 30-year prison sentence was upheld in January 2018.

The school was one of six two-story buildings built by the county for educational purposes in the 1870s and early 1880s. They required two teachers, and were therefore more expensive to operate. This building was constructed in 1881 by Reynolds Bros. It replaced a school building that had been built further east in 1874. It is a two-story frame structure that measures . The pedimented entry faces the south, and there is a belfry above the gable. A single classroom is located on the northern two-thirds of both floors. The town of Lancaster at one time had 32 buildings, but it started to decline in the 20th century. Enrollment in the school was 119 in 1898, but fell to about thirty early in the 20th century. When it closed in 1964 there were 13 students enrolled, and by that time they only utilized the first floor. The former school building, one of the churches and a few houses are all that remain of Lancaster. The building has been used in subsequent years as a voting facility.

It is about five degrees from Fomalhaut, roughly halfway between it and the Helix Nebula. It is currently 2.5 light years (0.77 pc) from Fomalhaut A, and 3.2 light years away from Fomalhaut B (0.987 pc). The entire system is only around 25 light years (7.7 parsecs) from our solar system. It was originally catalogued as a lone red dwarf, until October 2013, when Eric Mamajek announced that the star had a distance, velocity and color- magnitude position consistent with it being part of the Fomalhaut system. It was most likely catalogued with no relation to Fomalhaut due to the fact that it is in the Aquarius constellation, while the rest of the system are in the Piscis Austrinus constellation. Discovery and observation DSS image of Fomalhaut, Fomalhaut C's parent. Fomalhaut C was catalogued as a high-proper- motion star by Willum Luyten in 1979, and later, in October 2013, was discovered to be part of the Fomalhaut system, giving it the name Fomalhaut C. The star has a mass of 0.2 solar masses, (0.2 M☉) while Fomalhaut A is 1.9 M☉, and Fomalhaut B is 0.7M☉. The magnitude of this star has been recorded as 12.6. With this third star being so distant, the entire Fomalhaut system may be the widest-spanning star system that has ever been discovered. In the sky, Fomalhaut C would appear very far away from Fomalhaut, which is part of the fact of how close this system is. The distance in the night sky would be 5.5°, or around 11 full moons. Due to its magnitude, you would require a telescope to observe it at home. The entire system of Fomalhaut is around 440 million years old, which is roughly a tenth of the Solar System's age. Artist's rendition of Fomalhaut b (planet) orbiting in the Fomalhaut A debris disc =Debris disc= In December 2013, a debris disc was discovered around this star. This is the second debris disc in the system, as a first one was discovered around Fomalhaut A. The debris disc was discovered with the Herschel Space Telescope, and with the telescope the debris disc's temperature has been estimated at 24 kelvins. The distance from the star was originally thought to be around 10 AU, but since it is hypothesized that it is mainly small grains, which trap more heat, it may be further. However, if it were beyond 40 AU, it would have been already cataloged, which gives it a radius between 10 and 40 AU. Comets In part with the debris disc, there are also comets orbiting Fomalhaut C. The debris disc orbiting C is sometimes referred to as a comet belt, due to some very elliptical orbits. The disc around Fomalhaut A is also thought to have many comets, as it is also elliptical, along with Fomalhaut b (the planet, not to be confused with Fomalhaut B, the star). The Fomalhaut A belt is thought to possibly be due to a close encounter with either an undiscovered exoplanet, Fomalhaut B, or Fomalhaut C. With both A and C having comet belts, the absence of one around B is a mystery. Not only does the presence of comets make the belt more elliptical, it also makes it brighter which takes a part in its discovery. With Fomalhaut b being hidden in the comets, this leads to a hypothesis that C could have hidden exoplanets within its comets and asteroids. There is another theory that A & C have interacted which could have formed C's comet belt if the interaction involved A giving up comets and debris. With Fomalhaut B not having any discs or belts around it, it could have been unaffected by the encounter between them. Orbit The orbit of Fomalhaut C around A is estimated to take 20 million years to complete. Due to the age of the three stars being 440 million years, and the distance of 2.5 light years, this would mean that Fomalhaut C has only completed a full orbit around Fomalhaut A 22 times. The tidal radius of the Fomalhaut system is 6.2 light years (1.9 parsecs), which makes Fomalhaut C well within it, which further proves the Fomalhaut system as trinary.

Designed by architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, the memorial is in the form of a cenotaph, similar to that on Whitehall, also by Lutyens. It was commissioned by the South African Hospital and Comforts Fund Committee to commemorate the 39 South African soldiers who died of their wounds at a military hospital in Richmond Park during the First World War. The memorial was unveiled by General Jan Smuts in 1921 and was the focus of pilgrimages from South Africa through the 1920s and 1930s, after which it was largely forgotten until the 1980s when the Commonwealth War Graves Commission took responsibility for its maintenance. It has been a grade II listed building since 2012. Background Richmond Park, adjacent to the cemetery, was the location of the South African Military Hospital during the First World War, and 39 South African soldiers who died at the hospital were buried in Richmond Cemetery. After the end of the war, the South African Hospital and Comforts Fund Committee resolved to erect a memorial in the area of the cemetery known as \\"soldiers' corner\\", which includes the graves of the 39 South Africans. The committee commissioned Sir Edwin Lutyens, described by Historic England as \\"the leading English architect of his generation\\" to design the memorial, Lutyens having previously designed the Cenotaph on Whitehall which became the focus for the national Remembrance Sunday commemorations. Lutyens was also responsible for the Rand Regiments Memorial (later renamed the Anglo-Boer War Memorial) in Johannesburg, erected in 1911 to commemorate the Second Boer War (1899–1902)—his first war memorial. After the First World War, he worked extensively with the Imperial War Graves Commission (IWCG) to design memorials in cemeteries on the Western Front, including the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing—the largest British war memorial anywhere in the world—and the Stone of Remembrance which appears in all large IWCG cemeteries. Historic England described Richmond Cemetery as being \\"unusually well endowed with war memorials and war graves\\". Close to the South African Memorial is a section dedicated to ex-servicemen from the Royal Star and Garter Home in Richmond, which is marked by the Bromhead Memorial. History and design The memorial is in the form of a cenotaph, constructed in coarse granite to a design modelled on the Whitehall cenotaph. Unusually among Lutyens' memorials, it has a triangular top. It has a flared base and sits on a base of two stone steps, in contrast to the three on which most of Lutyens' memorials stand. The only significant relief on the memorial is two sculpted wreaths, one on each side, which have their own carved supports. The apex of each face bears the head of a springbok, the national symbol of South Africa, in low relief. The memorial contains inscription in both English and Dutch: on the outer face (facing away from the war graves) is the English inscription \\"UNION IS STRENGTH / OUR GLORIOUS DEAD\\", on the base below which is an inscribed cross; on the opposite side, facing the graves, is the same dedication in Dutch, \\"EENDRAGHT MAAKT MACHT, ONZEN GEVALLENEN HELDEN\\". On the north side of the cenotaph is engraved the Roman numeral MMXIV (1914) and on the south MMXIX (1919). One of the sculpted wreaths on the cenotaph, the only significant relief on the memorial According to Lutyens researcher Tim Skelton, the starkness of the South African Memorial in comparison to other Lutyens memorials and its differences to his other works is symbolic of the breakdown of the relationship between Lutyens and Herbert Baker. The two architects had collaborated on several projects in South Africa and India, but ultimately fell out over an alteration to the design of New Delhi.Skelton, pp. 19–21.Skelton, p. 96. The memorial was unveiled on 30 June 1921 and formally accepted by South African General Jan Smuts, who had previously laid the foundation stone, on behalf of the South African government in a ceremony officiated by the Bishop of St Albans.Meller, pp. 290–291. After the unveiling, it became a focal point for pilgrims from South Africa throughout the 1920s and 1930s, but thereafter fell into a state of neglect, in part due to strained relationships with South Africa during the apartheid era. It came to the attention of the IWGC (by then renamed the Commonwealth War Graves Commission) in 1981, and the commission agreed to take responsibility for its maintenance on behalf of the South African government.Skelton, p. 158.Skelton, p. 172.Beach, p. 218. Since 24 July 2012, the cenotaph has been designated a grade II listed building for its special architectural or historic interest, a status which offers legal protection from unauthorised demolition or unauthorised modification. In November 2015, as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War, Lutyens' war memorials were recognised as a \\"national collection\\" and all 44 of his free-standing memorials were listed or had their listing status reviewed and their National Heritage List for England list entries were updated and expanded.

Sarinah was the first skyscraper to be built in Jakarta. It is located at the intersection of Jalan Kyai Haji Wahid Hasyim and Jalan M. H. Thamrin. Sarinah was Jakarta's first modern department store, famous for having Indonesia's first escalators (installed by Hitachi), for being air-conditioned and for having electronic cash registers. In addition to Thamrin, Sarinah also has a number of outlets located in Pejaten Village at South Jakarta, Banyumanik at Semarang and Malang. Operator Sarinah is owned and operated by PT Sarinah (Persero), which was incorporated on 17 August 1962 as PT Department Store Indonesia. The entity is wholly owned by the government of Indonesia and was renamed in 1979. History In the early 1960s, Indonesia was hit by very high inflation rates. President Sukarno believed that a department store would act as a price stabilizer to help keep prices under control, a view he formed after visiting several communist capitals including Moscow, Prague and Warsaw. The department store was built by Obayashi Corporation using Japanese war reparation funds, and opened in August 1966. The project was conceived by President Sukarno, who named it Sarinah after his childhood nanny. In an effort to pursue its price stabilization agenda, state-owned Sarinah department store published weekly grocery price lists. Sukarno affirmed that \\"The Sarinah department store will become one of the important tools for the organization of Indonesian socialism...\\" and \\"if Sarinah sells a blouse for 10 rupiah then another retailer will not dare to sell the same blouse for 20 rupiah\\". However, it failed almost immediately in this role as there was a limit to what one store or even a few stores could do in such a large country. Sarinah struggled to compete with other retailers and went into debt as it expanded aggressively into other cities in Indonesia. In the early 1970s, in an effort to survive, Sarinah moved its focus to local handicrafts, especially batik. Sarinah is still best known for batik today. In the 1990s, after leasing out some of its space to McDonald's (its first branch in Indonesia) and Hard Rock Cafe (which later moved to Pacific Place Jakarta), Sarinah managed to rejuvenate itself as a popular place for young people. 2016 terrorist incident On 14 January 2016, multiple explosions and gunfire occurred near Sarinah. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility. 8 people were killed, 4 civilians and all 4 attackers. Expansion Two forty-one story towers are planned to be built in the area to complement the existing shopping center. The new towers will house high end restaurants; offices; and venues for meetings, conferences, and exhibition halls. The existing building will undergo major renovations to restore the originality of the building. The expansion project is expected to start by July 2020 and is projected to be completed in its entirety by mid-2022. Renovations on the existing building are estimated to complete by mid-2021. For the renovation to be carried out, the building management ordered all tenants to close in a 30 April 2020 memo. Notably the closing of the first McDonald's in Indonesia at the Sarinah location on 10 May 2020 attracted a considerable crowd and legal rebuke for violation of social distancing laws in effect for the ongoing SARS-2 pandemic at the time.

The league promotes Pinoy hip hop. FlipTop is heavily influenced by the original rap battle leagues in the West founded in 2008 – Grind Time Now (US), King of the Dot (Canada) and Don't Flop (UK), which inspired the creation of FlipTop and other battle leagues around the world. The league also branched out into several divisions after its success. The league is currently under management of a self-produced events and artist management company, FlipTop Kru Corp which was established also by Yuson.  Battle  In general, the contest consists of three rounds with a time limit for each contender set by the referee. Sometimes time limits are agreed on by the participants before the battle. For 1 on 1 and 2 on 2, time limits are generally 1 minute to 3 minutes (with 30 second increments) and 5 minutes respectively. Odd number of judges are selected to judge the battle to prevent draws. Early iteration of rules allowed judges to vote for overtime. In early years, majority of judges voted for overtime or if no definite winner emerged from judges' votes. However recently, the judges are not allowed to vote for overtime, they should pick a winner. The first turn is determined by a coin toss or prearranged agreement between two emcees who will took the first turn before the battle start. Written or non-written lines are allowed. Both sides can also bring props for the event. Filipino language is the primary medium although other languages or dialects can be used. Choking in any rounds increase the chance of losing the battle. The winner is determined by the decision of the judges. The criteria for judging are the usage of words, content, performance, audience impact, delivery, and rapping style depending on judge's perspective. There are different conferences in FlipTop such as the Filipino Conference, Bisaya Conference, and English Conference among others. The league has an annual tournament called \\"Isabuhay\\". A series of matches consists of undercard, non-tournament matches and tournament matches running for a year where the finals occurred every month of December. The emcees appearances on the matches depends on their availability.  Format  FlipTop has three different battle formats which sometimes combined with Freestyle: *Written - This format allows use of written lyrics along with freestyle and is now the standard format used in battles. *Freestyle - At first the most common in all FlipTop tournaments, this format is now rarely done and has generally been replaced by the written format. Lyrics must be thought of during the battle. *Old School - Is essentially the freestyle format but is accompanied with an instrumental, and is commonly used on tryouts. There are also different variations of rap battle within the FlipTop tournament: * Dos por Dos - Tag-team freestyle rap battle. It can be Emcee or Femcee, Freestyle or Written. * Five on Five - Five-member team freestyle rap battle. It can be Emcee or Femcee, Freestyle or Written. * Femcee Battle - All-female rap battle. It can be Freestyle or Written. * Intergender Battle - Male vs. Female battle. * Royal Rumble - A rap battle consists of more than two emcees randomly attack or bash each other. * Secret Battle - Same as the other battles but with limited audience.

As time passed, the events gained acceptance with the help of official FlipTop YouTube channel gaining more than one million subscribers for which they received the Golden Play Button Award, and over two million likes on its Facebook fanpage. Some emcees in the league recently are more focused on line delivery, hyping the audience in the battle, and gimmicks rather than dissing to attack the opponent; also the emcees improved their penmanship. After it gained success and reputation via social media, many amateur and other rap battles arose such as Sunugan, Word War, Bolero Rap Battles, Bahay Katay, Flipshop, Flipcap etc. Due to its freestyle and rhymed content, some academics considered it as modern-day \\"balagtasan\\" although some rap artists discourage the idea. Some educators considered FlipTop as 21st century Philippine literature It caught media attention in that some emcees involved in FlipTop have gained commercial success like Abra, Dello, Loonie, Smugglaz, Shehyee, and others. Also some of the lines spoke by the emcees in the battle became popular phrases used in the Philippines. =Controversy=Sinio vs. Shehyee Due to the nature of the league and its mechanics, bashing or shaming emcees' relatives is inevitable during the battle. However, in an undercard match between Sinio and Shehyee during the Ahon 7 event on December 16, 2016, Shehyee threw disrespectful lines against Sinio's wife, Bie Sarmiento, during the battle. This led to Sinio aggressively rebutting Shehyee by dissing the latter's girlfriend, internet sensation Ann Mateo. Their match was uploaded on FlipTop's YouTube channel on February 2, 2017 and went viral with over five million views within four days. Sinio's harsh words about Ann Mateo received mixed reactions, and became a hot topic on social media. There was controversy when Ann Mateo's mother saw the video and threatened Sinio with a lawsuit. Because of the situation, many netizens bashed Shehyee for being unprofessional for his failure to explain to his girlfriend's mother the mechanics of the league. Sinio felt that Shehyee was not to blame and that he understood Ann Mateo's mother's point-of-view. Shehyee tried to help Sinio in addressing the issue with Ann Mateo's mother. Ann Mateo did not share her reaction about the topic.  Pistolero vs. Luxuria  When their battle was uploaded to FlipTop Youtube Channel, viewers noticed Luxuria reading her written lyrics on her smartphone in the middle of the battle instead of memorizing it, thereby raising concerns of unfairness and cheating. There were also instances of rappers reading their written lyrics, besides Luxuria. Dopee and his partner Snob was caught in their DosPorDos battle while reading their lyrics on a paper in a few seconds.

For instance, is a triangle-free graph that contains all finite triangle-free graphs. These graphs are named after C. Ward Henson, who published a construction for them (for all ) in 1971.. The first of these graphs, , is also called the homogeneous triangle-free graph or the universal triangle-free graph. Construction To construct these graphs, Henson orders the vertices of the Rado graph into a sequence with the property that, for every finite set of vertices, there are infinitely many vertices having as their set of earlier neighbors. (The existence of such a sequence uniquely defines the Rado graph.) He then defines to be the induced subgraph of the Rado graph formed by removing the final vertex (in the sequence ordering) of every -clique of the Rado graph. With this construction, each graph is an induced subgraph of , and the union of this chain of induced subgraphs is the Rado graph itself. Because each graph omits at least one vertex from each -clique of the Rado graph, there can be no -clique in . Universality Any finite or countable -clique- free graph can be found as an induced subgraph of by building it one vertex at a time, at each step adding a vertex whose earlier neighbors in match the set of earlier neighbors of the corresponding vertex in . That is, is a universal graph for the family of -clique-free graphs. Because there exist -clique-free graphs of arbitrarily large chromatic number, the Henson graphs have infinite chromatic number. More strongly, if a Henson graph is partitioned into any finite number of induced subgraphs, then at least one of these subgraphs includes all -clique-free finite graphs as induced subgraphs. Symmetry Like the Rado graph, contains a bidirectional Hamiltonian path such that any symmetry of the path is a symmetry of the whole graph. However, this is not true for when : for these graphs, every automorphism of the graph has more than one orbit.

The term was first coined on December 30, 2015, by Guido Vranken, who wrote: :\\"The name TLS Bicycle Attack was chosen because of the conceptual similarity between how encryption hides content and gift wrapping hides physical objects. My attack relies heavily on the property of stream-based ciphers in TLS that the size of TLS application data payloads is directly known to the attacker and this inadvertently reveals information about the plaintext size; similar to how a draped or gift-wrapped bicycle is still identifiable as a bicycle, because cloaking it like that retains the underlying shape. The reason that I've named this attack at all is only to make referring to it easier for everyone.\\" The premise of the bicycle attack is that it makes brute-forcing of passwords much easier, because the length of passwords can be known. Moreover, it refutes the idea that SSL- encrypted HTTP packets obscure the length, because: :\\"the redundancy of the plaintext HTTP headers included in each and every request can be exploited in order to reveal the length of particular components (such as passwords) of particular requests (such as authentication to a web application).\\"  See also * Computer security  References  Category:Internet security ","title":"Bicycle attack"},{"id":"49104867","text":"Laurindo Almeida Quartet Featuring Bud Shank (later released as Brazilliance) is an album by guitarist Laurindo Almeida with saxophonist Bud Shank that was recorded in 1953 and 1954 for the Pacific Jazz label.Pacific Jazz Records Catalog: 1200 series accessed January 13, 2016Pacific Jazz/Pacifica Album Discography, accessed January 13, 2016 Reception Allmusic gave the album three stars.

Biography Albert Mangonès was born the son of Fernande Elisabeth Auguste and Philippe Auguste Edmond Mangonès on March 26, 1917 in Port-au-Prince. Like most children of Haitian elite, Albert Mangonès was sent away to study abroad. He was trained at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts of Brussels, one of Europe’s most prestigious institutions, and at Cornell University in New York where he studied architecture between 1939 and 1942, where he received a gold medal for excellence. Albert Mangonès in 1944 is one of the founders of the Art Center in Port-au-Prince build in 1941, which plays an important role in the discovery of popular painters of Haiti. In 1968 Mangonès is the author of an iconic sculpture of Haiti's history: the monument of Le Marron Inconnu (\\"The Unknown Slave\\") created in 1968 to pay tribute to the maroons of the Haitian Revolution. Founder in 1979 of Institut de Sauvegarde du Patrimoine National (ISPAN), Institute for the protection of the national heritage, Albert Mangonès is one of the pioneers of the preservation of architectural heritage of Haiti. He participated in the restoration of the Citadelle Laferrière, and the historic National Park including the palace of Sans-Souci Palace and the Ramiers site in the Nord department of Haiti, declared World Heritage by UNESCO.

It was translated into English in 2010 by Ann Goldstein. Agus asked that the passages of her work that were written in Sardinian be kept, a wish that was respected. The novella was adapted as a French film, Mal de pierres (2016), released with subtitles in English as From the Land of the Moon, written and directed by Nicole Garcia and starring Marion Cotillard. Plot A young woman recounts her grandmother's past life in Italy, beginning in 1943 in the middle of the Second World War, when her grandmother had reached her 30s and was still unwed. Considered an old maid by her parents, the she was married off to a man who had come to the town after his home had been bombed. She told him she would not have a sexual relationship with him, and he agreed as long as she permitted him to go to brothels. Shortly afterward, the couple moved to the man's home in Cagliari. The woman began to have sex with her husband in order to save the money he would have spent on brothels, but they were unable to conceive a child. She had painful kidney stones, which resulted in several miscarriages. After several years, in 1950 the woman's doctor recommended that she go to Civitavecchia for thermal treatments at a well- known spa. While there, the married woman met a war veteran, and they bonded over their artistic passions, his for music and hers for writing. He had lost a leg in the war, was married, and lived in Milan with his wife and child. Nine months later, the formerly childless married woman had a son. When he is seven, she goes to work as a maid so that he can have piano lessons. The son takes after his father and grows up to be a classical pianist. He in turn marries and has a daughter. The daughter and her grandmother become close; the older woman eventually tells her granddaughter about her affair with the veteran so many years ago. The grandmother also confides that in 1963 she, her husband and son visited Milan to see her younger sister. The grandmother somehow thought she would encounter her former lover and leave with him. Instead, she was overwhelmed by the city and had a miserable time, although the rest of the family remember the trip as one of the best of their lives. After the trip to Milan the woman resigns herself to life with her husband. Sometime later, she dies of kidney failure. The granddaughter comes to believe that her real grandfather is the veteran. After her grandmother's death, the granddaughter learns that at one point her great-grandparents wanted to commit their daughter to an asylum. She had been cutting herself and wrote erotic poetry (which they considered obscene) to any attractive man who caught her eye. The granddaughter becomes engaged to a man and the two begin to renovate her family apartment. They discover a notebook hidden in a wall. It belonged to the grandmother and includes a letter from the veteran. It reveals that the account of a sexually charged relationship between the grandmother and the veteran was entirely fictional; she sent him that story sometime after they had parted to ask his opinion. He responded that passages were beautiful, nearly causing him to regret that they never did make love. He encouraged the woman in her writing and reassured her that she was not mad. Adaptations In 2014 it was announced that Nicole Garcia would adapt the book for the screen with Marion Cotillard in the lead role. The film premiered at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. Reception The novella was positively reviewed. The New Yorker called it a \\"spare, fable-like novella\\".

The term is distinguished from the term \\"Nazarenes\\", used in Jewish writings to avoid the recognition of Jesus as Messiah, which is inherent in the term \\"Christians\\". It's also necessary to distinguish the various Christian sects who were using the name \\"Nazarenes\\" over the centuries.  The Judeo-Christian context  The name of Nazarenes (, \\"he who has vowed\\"; nothing to do with the radical N.Ts.H (hard, where does \\"Nazareth\\" (Netsarhi, which means \\"The Guard\\"))) was the very first Christians pray based on the title of the Nazarene or Nazareth gave Jesus (Matthew 2:23; Acts of the Apostles 2.22; 3.6; 4.10; 22.8; 26.9); but this meaning is probably multiple and fades away from us today. Gradually, from an unknown date between 40 and 110, it was left by the \\"Christian\\" Hellenized and the converted pagans, in favor of the disciples of the Messiah. (, Christians in French - mšiyayé in Aramaic). The name \\"Christian\\" had been given to these groups by the Romans and the latter from having a distinctly pejorative connotation and it seems like a \\"criminal qualification\\". Christian tradition says it was in Antioch that the name was given for the first time to \\"followers of the Way of the Lord\\". However, a group or groups preserved the name of Nazarenes. They are the subject of this article, and it should be appointed as the more accurate term, suggested by Ray A. Pritz, of \\"Judeo- Nazarenes\\" to avoid misunderstandings because of patristic writers: “They, evoking without interest, sometimes confused, rightly, with Gnostic groups, since part of the Judaizing who loved to return the name of the first Christians who were Gnostics.” The Jewish world of the first and the second centuries was marked by a large plurality; it sometimes simply explained by geographical reasons: most of the \\"Jews\\" lived outside of Palestine, until Chine (which also explains the rapid expansion of the Church of the East over there ). What is commonly called \\"Judaism\\" today is simply the form taken by the communities of Pharisees obedience from the Synod of Yavneh in Galilee, to 95, which form only became majority until much later. The Judeo-nazaréisme will prove as a warrior ideology. To understand this, we must go back to its beginnings prior to the first century, in a Jewish world diverse and marked by deep antagonisms since the Hasmoneans, the Kings of Judea were not the descendants of David, and the High Priests are all llegitimated. This could only raise an opposition movement. The facts were traced at length by Jacqueline Genot-Bismuth especially in the scenario Damas and summarized in Volume I of the Messiah and his prophète (p 114-137.) The character of the \\"Teacher of Righteousness\\", many believe is most likely mythical Kohen Yossé ben Yo'ezer who opposed the worship of the Temple in Jerusalem in the second century BCE and died a victim of persecution during the expedition of General Bacchides, governor of Syria, came restore Alcimus in the function of High Priest -161. His death is described in the Midrash Genesis Rabbah (65:22). Far from silencing his supporters forced to disperse, his death strengthened their political culture of opposition exacerbated by a dream cultic purity, focused on the expectation of the Messiah who will purify worship and abroad will drive the Holy Land. This movement of the Zealots are a branch, is the origin of so-called literature \\"Dead Sea\\". These discoveries eliminate implausible assumptions that were devised following the 1950 excavations by archaeologists some caves of the Dead Sea: bringing the archaeological site of Qumran caves of literary content, that is to say, imagine the inhabitants of site \\"Essene monks' unique authors of manuscripts caves, and therefore very busy copy them in a scriptorium in the medieval style (which is an anachronism ten centuries!). These reconciliations are baseless, born in the 1950s in the Vaux's father's entourage who directed the excavations, were quickly challenged by archaeologists (including Robert and Pauline Donceel): the site of Qumran nothing of \\"monastic\\", he reflects on the contrary a very rich habitat; and implausible \\"scriptorium\\" is nothing but a living rooms as we found in other wealthy homes in the region at that time. As for the texts of the caves, it should release the fiction \\"Essene\\" which was built around them, denounced as an expert exegete of these manuscripts, André Paul in 2008. Even on the basis of too partial documentation (what Frédéric Manns, Le judéo- christianisme, mémoire ou prophétie? Highlighted), former director of Jewish Studies, Simon Claude Mimouni, received the seed of Judaeonazaréisme into the birth of Islam, where \\"he played such a role that you wonder if it is not a large extent of the cause.\\"  Islam and the Third Temple  Syria (Paris, Geuthner, 1927).

She played guitar with The White Mountain Orchestra and recorded six sides for the Victor Talking Machine Company. Life She was born in 1906 to Curtis Maxwell, a locally known fiddler. She grew up in Nutrioso, near Springerville, Arizona. The family worked primarily as ranchers. Her father started a folk group called The White Mountain Orchestra while Billie was a child, and they would perform around the area, often playing at dances. She joined the band as a guitarist while in her teens. In 1929 she married A. Chester Warner, a school teacher and continued playing with the band. Around the same time, Ralph Peer, noted recording engineer and talent scout for the Victor Talking Machine Company, was having auditions held around the southwestern U.S. to find new Victor recording artists. The White Mountain Orchestra was selected from a local audition in June 1929 to travel to El Paso, Texas, to record for him. The band went to El Paso on 2 July 1929 and recorded four songs, including Escudilla Waltz. While Peer was listening to the session, he asked Billie to sing. She recorded five songs singing solo, with guitar and violin. The first song was recorded on July 2, the remainder on July 11. The discs were published with Maxwell identified as Billie Maxwell, the Cow Girl Singer. Her songs spoke honestly of the struggles of poorer women. She continued to perform with the White Mountain Orchestra until the birth of her first child. She had two children, and died from cancer in 1954 at age 48. Discography Victor issued three 78rpm records (six songs) by Maxwell. Disc One: It was issued 22 November 1929 and sold 3125 copies. Disc Two: It sold 2641 copies. Disc Three: It sold 1300 copies.

Bruce, Jr., took over the business in 1900 and he had the 1½-story, frame, Queen Anne-Neoclassical style house completed in 1910. At one time, the Bruce Goldfish Fisheries consisted of twenty-four ponds, nine windmills, two fish houses, a storage house, barn, garage and two cement tanks sunk in the ground. The tanks were used to display the fish for public tours, and to sort them before they were shipped. The heyday of the business was in the 1920s, shipping goldfish across the United States and around the world. Tariff protections were removed in 1933 and the American market was opened to less expensive Japanese fish. The effects of the Great Depression also led to the rapid decline of the business. E.K.
