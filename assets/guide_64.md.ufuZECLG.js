Ranger Uranium Mine, number 3 pit Arandis Mine The uranium mining debate covers the political and environmental controversies of the mining of uranium for use in either nuclear power or nuclear weapons. Background As of 2009, in terms of uranium production, Kazakhstan was the largest supplier to export markets (27%), followed by Canada (20%) and Australia (16%). Australia has 23% of the world's uranium ore reserves and the world's largest single uranium deposit, located at the Olympic Dam Mine in South Australia. The years 1976 and 1977 saw uranium mining become a major political issue in Australia, with the Ranger Inquiry (Fox) report opening up a public debate about uranium mining.Bauer, Martin (ed) (1995). Resistance to New Technology, Cambridge University Press, p. 173. The Movement Against Uranium Mining group was formed in 1976, and many protests and demonstrations against uranium mining were held.Drew Hutton and Libby Connors, (1999). A History of the Australian Environmental Movement, Cambridge University Press. Concerns relate to the health risks and environmental damage from uranium mining. In 1977, the National Conference of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) passed a motion in favour of an indefinite moratorium on uranium mining, and the anti-nuclear movement in Australia acted to support the Labor Party and help it regain office. However, after the ALP won power in 1983, the 1984 ALP conference voted in favour of a \\"Three mine policy\\".Burgmann, Verity (2003). Power, Profit and Protest pp. 174-175. Retrieved 8 December 2009. Australia has three operating uranium mines at Olympic Dam (Roxby) and Beverley - both in South Australia's north - and at Ranger in the Northern Territory. As of April 2009, construction has begun on South Australia's fourth uranium mine‚Äîthe Honeymoon Uranium Mine.Work begins on Honeymoon uranium mine ABC News, April 24, 2009. Retrieved 8 February 2010. The R√∂ssing Uranium Mine located in Namibia is the world's longest-operating open-pit uranium mine. The uranium mill tailings dam has been leaking for a number of years, and on January 17, 2014, a catastrophic structural failure of a leach tank caused a major spill. The France-based laboratory, Commission de Recherche et d'Information Independentantes sur la Radioactivite (CRIIAD) reported elevated levels of radioactive materials in the area surrounding the mine. Notable anti-uranium activists include Golden Misabiko (Democratic Republic of the Congo), Kevin Buzzacott (Australia), Jacqui Katona (Australia), Yvonne Margarula (Australia), Jillian Marsh (Australia), Manuel Pino (US), JoAnn Tall (US), and Sun Xiaodi (China).Phil Mercer. Aborigines count cost of mine BBC News, 25 May 2004.Anti-uranium demos in Australia BBC World Service, 5 April 1998.Jennifer Thompson. Anti-nuke protests Green Left Weekly, 16 July 1997. There have been many reports about working conditions at the mine, and the effects on the mine laborers.  Health risks of uranium mining  Because uranium ore emits radon gas, uranium mining can be more dangerous than other underground mining, unless adequate ventilation systems are installed. During the 1950s, many Navajos in the U.S. became uranium miners, as many uranium deposits were discovered on Navajo reservations. A statistically significant subset of these early miners later developed small cell carcinoma after exposure to uranium ore. Radon-222, a natural decay product of uranium, has been shown to be the cancer-causing agent. Some American survivors and their descendants have received compensation under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act which was enacted in 1990, and as of 2016 continues to receive and award claims. Successful claimants have include uranium miners, mill workers and ore transporters. Residues from processing of uranium ore can also be a source of Radon. Radon resulting from the high radium content in uncovered dumps and tailing ponds can be easily released into the atmosphere. Also possible is the contamination of ground water and surface water with uranium by leaching processes. In July 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) released the fourth edition of its guidelines for drinking-water quality. The drinking water guidance level for uranium was increased to 30 Œºg/L. This limit can be exceeded near mill tailings or mining sites. In January 2008 Areva was nominated for an Anti Oscar Award. The French state-owned company mines uranium in northern Niger where mine workers are not informed about health risks, and analysis shows radioactive contamination of air, water and soil. The local organization that represents the mine workers spoke of \\"suspicious deaths among the workers, caused by radioactive dust and contaminated groundwater\\". Uranium mining and indigenous people Large- scale uranium mining operations throughout the world have had a significant impact on indigenous peoples and their ways of life, raising questions concerning economic development of \\"remote regions\\" in relation to the impact on traditions life styles of these cultures, and resulting health and environmental hazards. The Jabiluka uranium mine is located in Kakadu National Park, Australia, is a World Heritage Site and home to the Mirrar Aboriginal culture. A dispute exists between the mining industry, the Mirrar people represented by Yvonne Margarula, ecologists and politicians on the implications of postcolonialism in relation to the impacts on the health and vitality of humans and other species, and effects on scarce water resources. The impact of uranium mining, milling and processing for India's burgeoning nuclear power industry has created controversy between indigenous peoples and mining and energy development. Winona LaDuke, spokesperson for Native Americans and First Nations has written extensively on the impact of uranium mining on indigenous communities. The Jackpile Uranium Mine was the world's largest open-pit uranium mine until its closure in the 1980s. The mine, located on Laguna Pueblo land in New Mexico covered approximately 2,500 acres, and employed Laguna, Canyoncito, Acoma and Zuni Pueblo people, as well as the Navajo.

It was released in Japan in July 2010, in Australia and Europe in October 2010, and in North America in January 2011. Lost in Shadow is played largely in the background of the game environment as the player controls a boy's shadow, which must climb the shadows of a tall tower, rife with puzzles and enemies. He is accompanied by a sylph that can alter the direction of the foreground light sources, altering the alignment of shadows upon which he climbs. There are times in the game when the boy is able to materialize into the 3D world and briefly interact with the objects themselves as opposed to simply their shadows. Gameplay Lost in Shadow is a 2D platform game. The player must navigate each level, fighting enemies, and using switches and levers to open up paths. Selected platforms can be rotated to provide different routes. At certain points, the player is given control over light sources in the foreground which can be moved to alter the layout of the level. Development The old racing track in Negishi served as the principal basis for the atmosphere in the game. Lost in Shadow was developed by the team at Hudson Soft that had previously created Kororinpa and its sequel for the Wii. The original inspiration came from the game shadow tag, the objective of which is to step on an opponent's shadow. Director Osamu Tsuchihashi was reminded of his experience with the game as a child when he saw some kids playing tag in a park. He conceived the concept of Lost in Shadow as a result, combining it with an earlier idea of a title revolving around climbing a tower. The atmosphere and setting of the game was based on a disused tower in Tokyo and an abandoned racing track in Negishi, the latter of which Tsuchihashi was intrigued by after he coincidentally came upon a photo of the location. For the lighting of Lost in Shadow, he tried to recreate the horizontal incidence of sunlight while playing shadow tag, and the muted color palette used in the title was inspired by ancient Japanese art. The enemies in the levels were made to convey a sense of fear and sadness, and were thought of as \\"it\\", the current chaser in a game of tag. The shadow protagonist of the story was left unnamed because Tsuchihashi did not want to over-characterize it. Similarly, chief designer Masakazu Echigo kept its shape fairly simple not to obscure it on the various surfaces it is cast on, and sound director Shohei Bando was faced with the challenge of creating sounds a shadow would make. The health system of the game, centered around the weight of the shadow, was based on Duncan MacDougall's alleged determination of the human soul weighing 21 grams. Hiromasa Ogura, who is a character designer of director Hayao Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli and had previously worked on the anime films Patlabor: The Movie and Ghost in the Shell, was commissioned as the art director for the game and drew the Japanese box cover, as part of a team of seven graphic artists. The music composed by Takasi Watanabe is mostly ambient in nature, and is supplemented by the image song \\"Hinagiku\\" from artist Gutevolk. The team conceived the easier puzzles in the game with a computer program, though actual toy blocks were used to model more complex ones, resulting in a lot of trial and error. However, most of the development time of one and a half years was spent on creating and adjusting the shadow engine which posed many unforeseen problems for the game's programmers.

Muriel a andƒõl√© (Muriel and Angels) is a comic album written by Milo≈° Macourek and drawn by K√°ja Saudek, originally created in the late 1960s and published in 1991. The album is considered one of the masterworks of Czech comics; it was voted the best Czech comic in a poll held by the newspaper Mlad√° fronta DNES in 2009. Muriel and Angels tells the story of a young physician Muriel Ray and her friend Ro, a winged angel who came to Earth from a distant future. The main character was inspired by the Czech film star Olga Schoberov√°, and the main antagonist, militant general Ian Xeron, was inspired by Saudek's twin brother, photographer Jan Saudek.

However, his reach of military actions had spread till the provinces of Ghazni and Kabul, and his political influence and relations towards the other mujahideen groups was reaching even further.Raffray, M√©riadec, \\"Les Sovi√©tiques en Afghanistan 1979 - 1989 L'Arm√©e Rouge Boulevers√©e \\", Cahier de la Recherche Doctrinale, 2008 He was educated at the Lyc√©e Esteqlal in Kabul, before taking his B.A. in documentation fran√ßaise at Kabul University.J. Bruce Amstutz. Afghanistan: The First Five Years of Soviet Occupation. DIANE Publishing, 1994. , , p.119 Resistance period His father and grandfather were followers of Pir Ahmed Gailani, his father introduced him to Ahmed Gailani and Amin joined Gailani's Mahaz-e Melli . A particularly active commander, he attacked Soviet and government targets as far as Ghazni and Kabul, far from the traditional territory of his clan. This caused tensions with the traditional leaders of other clans of the Wardak tribe. These other clans appealed to Pir Gailani to intervene on their behalf. The Pir pressed Amin Wardak to stop his long-range operations and diminished his weapons deliveries. As a result, Amin switched to Hezb-e Islami Khalis in 1987, or early 1988, as Khalis was more willing to supply him with weapons. In his memoirs,\\"Commandant Amin Wardak, M√©moires de Guerre \\", Arthaud, 2009. Amin Wardak explains that his switch to Khalis' faction didn't bring any improvement in supplying weapons. To him, these factions or political groups were simply basic logisticians for real field operationals. He blames them for not having been sufficiently focused on the war against the Soviets and the needs of the populations, instead, they have been more worried about their own power gaining and their political aims. In respect to himself, Amin Wardak writes that almost all of its weaponry stock was taken from the enemy during combat. He admits that he received very little support from Afghan political parties, but he could bear it because he had developed a strong position within his people and good links with western humanitarians. Besides, as a Pashtun leader, Amin Wardak always kept reliable and durable relations with minority ethnic communities within the country. Links with the West In order to limit the control of the parties Amin Wardak established strong links with Westerners. Especially with the assistance of French NGOs, Amin Wardak developed his own administration in areas which he controlled, which he called the \\"Free province of Wardak\\". He established clinics and schools, instituted agricultural policies, and even printed his own postage stamps. His influence grew rapidly and extended up to the city of Ghazni.Rubin, p.241 French adventurer Patrice Franceschi fought alongside Amin Wardak and his mujahideen. He was also supported by humanitarian activist: Dr Bernard Kouchner who held the office of Minister several times in France and who is also known as an icon of what has been called the French Doctors. Post-Soviet period Council of Commanders - Legend of main characters In the late 80's, when the Soviet withdrawal became inevitable, Amin Wardak was at the initiative of what was called the Council of Commanders. He has been strongly supported in this purpose by his close friend Commander Abdul Haq. Namely, significant mujahideen leaders took part in this process, as Jalaluddin Haqqani, the Hazara leader Sayid Jaglan, Qari Baba, Ahmad Shah Massoud, and so on till 300 major Commanders. The purpose of this council was to unify all Commanders in order to coordinate attacks on the communist regime and to plan the reconstruction of Afghanistan after the fall of communist regime. This quest has been sabotaged by the Afghan political parties who saw a loss of their influence in it. In his memoirs, Amin Wardak states that Massoud has certainly played the most ambiguous role during his late and hesitant participation in this unification process. Abdul Haq (left), Amin Wardak, Akhtar Mohammad Tolwak (standing) at Band-e Sultan in Jaghatu, Wardak, in 1992. Meeting held in order to plan a security strategy in provinces, while fights had started in Kabul between several Mujahideen Commanders In 1992, while war raged in Kabul under the Presidency of Burhanuddin Rabbani, for the first time in the history of Afghanistan Amin Wardak established free elections in the province of Wardak in order to elect its Governor. Dr Guy Causs√© and Dr Joseph-Louis Rabette from M√©decins du Monde witnessed it while they were in Wardak at that time.\\"Wardak, Amin, M√©moires de Guerre, , Arthaud, 2009, p.268. The aim was to ensure political and security stability for the population that feared the spread of fighting into their area. Amin Wardak didn't wish to aspire to the post, but the population claimed at least one candidate from his family. Amin Wardak asked his youngest brother Rohani Wardak (Nangyalai) to run for elections. Rohani won handily and became Governor of Wardak. He held this position until the arrival of the Taliban and then presented his resignation. He left a very positive image and is still living amid his people. Today, Rohani Wardak is considered as the strong man in the region (as a traditional leader) because of the local support that he possesses. Expatriation In 1995, Amin Wardak had to flee Afghanistan because he was under serious threat due to its very critical position against the mujahideen who took part in the civil war between 1992-1996. In his memoirs, Amin Wardak calls it \\"War for Power\\". This war also gave birth to the Taliban movement, whom then received broad popular support in their first years. Since, Amin Wardak lived in exile in France, but continues to return home often. However, he never turned his back to his homeland and is still focussed on solutions to the Afghan issue. One point should be emphasized, Amin Wardak is one of those rare former leading commanders who has never been involved in any ethnical or religious war. He remains extremely critical against the main protagonists of the Afghan civil war, in particular, those who henceforth hold office in the Afghan government.

The mountain was renamed Sharafat Koh (Honor Mountain) by the Afghan mujahideen after they established a stronghold there in 1979. The Afghan communists referred to the mountain as Mordar Koh (Filthy Mountain).Ali Ahmad Jalali, Lester W. Grau. Afghan guerrilla warfare: in the words of the Mujahideen fighters. Zenith Imprint, 2002. , Capturing Lor Koh A series of military operations by Soviet troops and the Armed Forces of the DRA to capture the base area of the Afghan mujahideen during the Afghan war (1979-1989), in the Lor Koh mountain range in the southwestern part of the Republic of Afghanistan in the Farah province. Preceding events Detachments of Afghan mujahideen from the Lor Koh region carried out regular attacks on the highway and methodically increased their territory under their control. Various attempts were made by the command of the Soviet troops and the Afghan army to squeeze the rebel groups out of the gorge and leave the area. In 1980, the command of the Soviet 5th Infantry Division decided to eliminate the rebel detachment in the gorge and seize the Lor Koh base area. Purpose and course of the operation According to General B.V. Gromov, the commander of the Soviet contingent in Afghanistan, the capture of the Lor Koh base was, first of all, needed by the Government forces of the DRA, and not by the 40th Army of the USSR. On the border of Afghanistan and Iran, the 5th motorized rifle division conducted combat activities. Its area of responsibility was the entire territory bordering with Iran - the provinces of Herat, Farah, Helmand. At the stage of the beginning of the military operation, it was proposed to mine all the entrances and exits to the gorge, enclosing the rebels in a so-called bag, and keeping them in the zone of constant destruction of Soviet artillery and aviation. The command of the Afghan army had a different opinion: they offered to make a powerful breakthrough deep into the gorge and destroy the base, while sending Soviet troops forward. From the very beginning, the course of the operation to capture Lor Koh took on a complex character - attempts to advance into the depths of the mountain range met with fierce resistance from the rebels. The base was equipped and replenished with reserves in advance and with a prospect for the future: huge stocks of ammunition and food allowed the rebels to hold out for a long time. To capture Lor Koh, first of all, it was necessary to clear all the approaches to the base and suppress the firing points that targeted the sections of the gorge. It was extremely difficult to do this without loss. The advance along the mountain ranges in the direction of the base area, for the consistent capture of the dominant heights, was prevented by the oncoming heavy enemy fire. The landing of a Soviet landing in the Lor Koh area, due to the numerical and positional advantage in favor of the rebels, was inexpedient. The forces of Soviet artillery were not enough for preliminary processing by strikes on the slopes in order to exclude the loss of foot groups. At the current stage, the Soviet troops did not have the necessary number of helicopters and front-line aviation for the landing, and the aviation forces - air cover for helicopters - were also lacking. One of the main problems was also the lack of proper communication for controlling the landing in the mountains, especially when descending into the gorge. The loss of communication with the foot groups was tantamount to their death. At the initial stage of the war, the Soviet troops were not yet equipped with aviation systems with radio repeaters, those that later hung in the air during each of the hostilities. If Soviet units imposed a battle on the rebels, it would lead to heavy casualties. Based on this, it was decided not to carry out an operation inside Lor Koh, but to limit itself only to the selected measures: the approaches to the mountain range were mined, the gorges were treated with artillery. Between the rocks of Lor Koh and the road, reinforced barriers were set up to intercept the rebels. It took five days, after which the divisions returned to the barracks. A few months later, the base in Lurkokh began to remind of itself again. The base area was almost daily subjected to bomb-assault and long-range artillery strikes, mining of the main gorges and approaches to them was constantly repeated. Nevertheless, Lor Koh again began to be used by the opposition as a united command post - on a well- fortified base in the center of the mountains, where the leaders of the mujahideen formations continued to gather from time to time. The Soviet command was oppressed by the fact that during the incessant raids of the rebels, outposts, guard posts and military garrisons - parts of the 40th Army and government troops, continued to suffer losses. To capture Lor Kokh, before the subunits set out, it was necessary to clear the areas of the gorge under fire. It was impossible to do this without losses from the Soviet side. The Soviet paratroopers could not move along the mountain ranges in order to occupy the dominant heights - they ran into a wall of heavy oncoming fire. The landing directly at Lor Koh was also not possible, since there was not enough force for this. There was not enough artillery for the preliminary processing of the mountain slopes before the landing of the landing groups, thereby excluding the possibility of its defeat. There was not the required number of helicopters for landing and front-line aviation for cover. The most test task was to control the landing force that went into the mountains, and to a greater extent descended into the gorge - the loss of communication with the landing force is tantamount to its death. Based on the current situation, the command of the operation decided not to send troops to Lor Kokh, but to limit themselves to only some measures - to carefully mine the approaches to the mountain range, and the tops of the mountains were thoroughly re-processed by artillery. Between the rocky passages of Lor Koh in the valleys, reinforced barriers were set up to intercept the Mujahideen. The operation ended at this point. Lor Koh after 1980, 1981 A few months after the operations in Lor Koh, the base began to function again. Mujahideen in the area renewed their attacks on the highway and systematically increased their territory under their control. Soviet troops took all measures to squeeze the rebels out of the gorge. In the future, the attacks of the rebels on the Soviet and Afghan outposts, outposts, military garrisons of the unit did not stop, taking on a regular character, and led to human casualties. The command of the 5th Infantry Division again faced the need to eliminate the rebel detachments and capture the base area of Lurkokh. Much later, Lurkokh again fell into the field of view of the command of the 40th Army, the rebel detachments operating in the Lor Kokh gorge became more active at the end of 1985, then a series of massive bomb and assault air strikes were carried out on them, after which Lurkokh no longer functioned. The fighting to seize the Lor Koh Mujahideen base in December 1984 was carried out using sudden night strikes from different directions and further seizing all the main heights in the mountain range and establishing control over the main gorge, from which the secondary ones departed. Under the cover of artillery fire, it was possible to clear all the approaches, and then, suppressing the enemy with artillery fire and aviation strikes, the main forces were brought in. Suppressing enemy firing points and capturing prisoners. During the operation, three people were killed: one was killed by a sniper, the second was blown up by a rebel mine, the third fell off a cliff and crashed into a gorge during night operations to capture heights. At the Lor Koh base, plots of cultivated land were discovered where everything from vegetables to wheat was grown; training fields, where fire training classes were held from various types of weapons from small arms to grenade launchers; classes in tactics, sapper business - the installation and removal of anti-personnel and anti-tank mines, land mines, charges. The base also had a prison. Each cell had chains and shackles. The front side of the cells was covered with a grill made of a thick metal rod, with a door in it. At the end of the prison there was a room with many different instruments of torture. There was a small guard tower over the prison. At the time of the capture of Lor Koh, none of the prisoners were found in the prison. During the inspection, they also found barracks for a variable staff undergoing training here, behind them were premises where the permanent staff was located. The premises intended for the command and the foreign adviser were detached. Some rooms were mined with surprise mines. In one of the caves, a trophy warehouse was discovered, as well as a lot of foreign literature in English and French. There were also at the base, separate rooms for prayer; kitchen-dining room, built by a small flowing lake, feeding with the waters of powerful springs. From this lake stretched many kilometers of flexible colored rubber hoses, they went up to the rocks and into some caves. The availability of water provided the rebels with life. Upon completion of the operation and exit from the gorge, the base infrastructure was undermined and mined. More about Lor Koh base From the description by the Afghan mujahideen: the actual name of the mountain range is Lor Koh, but the mujahideen themselves among themselves called it Sharafat Koh - the mountain of honor. Lor Koh is located southeast of the city of Farah, 12 kilometers from the Kandahar-Herat highway, and 20 kilometers from the Daulatabad-Farah highway. The mountain range is a strict rectangular shape on a plateau (top view). It rises up to 1500 meters above the surrounding desert, the mountain slopes of the massif are steep. Lor Koch covers over 256 square kilometers. The massif consists of many connected large and small canyons. On the north side - Shaykh Razi Baba Canyon, in the north- west of the massif there is Kale-e Amani Canyon, in the west of the massif there is - Kale-e Kaneske Canyon Canyon). The Jare-e Ab Canyon faces southwest and joins the Kal-e-Kaneski Canyon at the top. In the south is the Tangira Canyon, the most water-bearing, but the Mujahideen usually did not use it in their tactics, since the canyon was the widest and most sufficient for the passage of enemy armored vehicles. In the south, and further in the east, there is the Khwaja Morad Canyon, located near the Khoja Morad temple. The Khoja-Morad canyon is connected with all the canyons of the mountain range. The Kal-e Kaneske canyon was the most powerful base in Sharafat Koh. It takes 35‚Äì40 minutes to overcome the path from the entrance to the end of the gorge. The mouth of the canyon is a gorge in a solid rock, only two to three meters wide. At the entrance to the canyon, it is impossible to observe the sky above you, in the depths of the gorge - in the area where there are many trees, it expands three to four times. The canyon has 40-meter waterfalls flowing into a reservoir, water supply dams and 16 caves that can accommodate 60 people. On both sides, at the tops of the canyons, DShK machine guns were installed. In connection with the loss of powerful bases in the vicinity of the provincial centers of Farah and Nimruz in the early years of the war as a result of the attacks of the Soviet and Afghan government forces, the Mujahideen decided to equip the Sharafat Koh base area. The first base at Sharafat Koh was set up in Tangir canyon in 1979. The Mujahideen detachments were organized along tribal lines, initially they were: Achakzai, Nurzai, Barakzai and Alizai. They united and moved to a new base in the Jare-e canyon. Soviet troops attacked this base in 1980, from there the Mujahideen moved to the Kal-e-Kaneski canyon. The Mujahideen were in the city of Farah until 1982. When the DRA and Soviet troops cleared the area, the Mujahideen abandoned their positions and retreated to Sharafat Koh. With the abandonment of Farah, the Mujahideen lost contact with the population of the city. The Mujahideen regularly attacked nearby columns - Karvanga, Chara, Shivan, as well as garrisons: in Karwang, Charah and Velamekh, intended to escort the columns.

Lactoperoxidase is a member of the heme peroxidase family of enzymes. In humans, lactoperoxidase is encoded by the LPO gene. Lactoperoxidase catalyzes the oxidation of a number of inorganic and organic substrates by hydrogen peroxide. These substrates include bromide and iodide and therefore lactoperoxidase can be categorised as a haloperoxidase. Another important substrate is thiocyanate. The oxidized products produced through the action of this enzyme have potent bactericidal activities. Lactoperoxidase together with its inorganic ion substrates, hydrogen peroxide, and oxidized products is known as the lactoperoxidase system. The lactoperoxidase system plays an important role in the innate immune system by killing bacteria in milk and mucosal (linings of mostly endodermal origin, covered in epithelium, which are involved in absorption and secretion) secretions hence augmentation of the lactoperoxidase system may have therapeutic applications. Furthermore, addition or augmentation of the lactoperoxidase system has potential applications in controlling bacteria in food and consumer health care products. The lactoperoxidase system does not attack DNA and is not mutagenic. However, under certain conditions, the lactoperoxidase system may contribute to oxidative stress. Furthermore, lactoperoxidase may contribute to the initiation of breast cancer, through its ability to oxidize estrogenic hormones producing free radical intermediates.  Structure  The structure of lactoperoxidase consists mainly of alpha-helices plus two short antiparallel beta-strands. Lactoperoxidase belongs to the heme peroxidase family of mammalian enzymes that also includes myeloperoxidase (MPO), eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), thyroid peroxidase (TPO), and prostaglandin H synthase (PGHS). A heme cofactor is bound near the center of the protein.;  Function  Lactoperoxidase catalyzes the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) oxidation of several acceptor molecules: * reduced acceptor + H2O2 ‚Üí oxidized acceptor + H2O Specific examples include: * thiocyanate (SCN‚àí) ‚Üí hypothiocyanite (OSCN‚àí) * bromide (Br‚àí) ‚Üí hypobromite (BrO‚àí) * iodide (I‚àí) ‚Üí hypoiodite (IO‚àí) Source of the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) usually is the reaction of glucose with oxygen in the presence of the enzyme glucose oxidase () that also takes place in saliva. Glucose, in turn, can be formed from starch in the presence of the saliva enzyme amyloglucosidase (). These relatively short lived oxidized intermediates have potent bactericidal effects, hence lactoperoxidase is part of the antimicrobial defense system in tissues that express lactoperoxidase. The lactoperoxidase system is effective in killing a range of aerobic and certain anaerobic microorganisms. Research (1984): \\"The effect of lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide mixtures on bacteria is dependent on experimental conditions. If the bacteria are cultured after the exposure to lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide on nutrient agar under aerobic conditions, they may not grow, whereas they grow readily on blood agar under anaerobic conditions.\\" In its antimicrobial capacity, lactoperoxidase appears to acts synergistically with lactoferrin and lysozyme.  Applications  Lactoperoxidase is an effective antimicrobial agent. Consequently, applications of lactoperoxidase are being found in preserving food, cosmetics, and ophthalmic solutions. Furthermore, lactoperoxidase have found application in dental and wound treatment. Finally lactoperoxidase may find application as anti-tumor and anti viral agents.  Dairy products  Lactoperoxidase is an effective antimicrobial agent and is used as an antibacterial agent in reducing bacterial microflora in milk and milk products. Activation of the lactoperoxidase system by addition of hydrogen peroxide and thiocyanate extends the shelf life of refrigerated raw milk. It is fairly heat resistant and is used as an indicator of overpasteurization of milk.  Oral care  A lactoperoxidase system is claimed to appropriate for the treatment of gingivitis and paradentosis. Lactoperoxidase has been used in toothpaste or a mouthrinse to reduce oral bacteria and consequently the acid produced by those bacteria.  Cosmetics  A combination of lactoperoxidase, glucose, glucose oxidase (GOD), iodide and thiocyanate is claimed to be effective in the preservations of cosmetics.  Cancer and viral infections  Antibody conjugates of glucose oxidase and to lactoperoxidase have been found to effective in killing tumor cells in vitro. In addition, macrophages exposed to lactoperoxidase are stimulated to kill cancer cells. Peroxidase-generated hypothiocyanite inhibits herpes simplex virus and human immunodeficiency virus.  Clinical significance = Innate immune system  The antibacterial activity of lactoperoxidase plays an important role in the immune defense system. Hypothiocyanite is one of the reactive intermediates produced by the activity of lactoperoxidase on thiocyanate and hydrogen peroxide produced by dual oxidase 2 proteins, also known as Duox2. Thiocyanate secretion in cystic fibrosis patients is decreased, resulting in a reduced production of the antimicrobial hypothiocyanite and consequently contributes to increased risk of airway infection. The lactoperoxidase system efficiently inhibits helicobacter pylori in buffer; however, in whole human saliva, it has a weaker antibacterial effect. The lactoperoxidase system does not attack DNA and is not mutagenic. However, under certain conditions, the lactoperoxidase system may contribute to oxidative stress. It has been shown that lactoperoxidase in the presence of thiocyanate can trigger the bactericidal and cytotoxic effects of hydrogen peroxide under specific conditions, such as when hydrogen peroxide is present in the reaction mixtures in excess of thiocyanate.  Breast cancer  The oxidation of estradiol by lactoperoxidase is a possible source of oxidative stress in breast cancer. The ability of lactoperoxidase to propagate a chain reaction leading to oxygen consumption and intracellular hydrogen peroxide accumulation could explain the hydroxyl radical-induced DNA base lesions recently reported in female breast cancer tissue. Lactoperoxidase may be involved in breast carcinogenesis, because of its ability to interact with estrogenic hormones and oxidise them through two one-electron reaction steps. Lactoperoxidase reacts with the phenolic A-ring of estrogens to produce reactive free radicals. In addition, lactoperoxidase may activate carcinogenic aromatic and heterocyclic amines and increase binding levels of activated products to DNA, which suggests a potential role of lactoperoxidase-catalyzed activation of carcinogens in the causation of breast cancer.  Oral Care  During the last decades, several clinical studies describing the clinical efficacy of the lactoperoxidase system in a variety of oral care products (tooth pastes, mouth rinses) have been published. After showing indirectly, by means of measuring experimental gingivitis and caries parameters, that mouth rinses containing amyloglucosidase (Œ≥-amylase) and glucose oxidase activate the lactoperoxidase system, the protective mechanism of the enzymes in oral care products has been partially elucidated. Enzymes such as lysozyme, lactoperoxidase and glucose oxidase are transferred from the tooth pastes to the pellicle. Being components of the pellicle, these enzymes are catalytically highly active. Also, as part of tooth pastes, the lactoperoxidase system has a beneficial influence to avoid early childhood caries by reducing the number of colonies formed by the cariogenic microflora while increasing the thiocyanate concentration. With xerostomia patients, tooth pastes with the lactoperoxidase system are seemingly superior to fluoride-containing tooth pastes with respect to plaque formation and gingivitis. More studies are required to examine further the protective mechanisms. The application of lactoperoxidase is not restricted to caries, gingivitis, and periodontitis. A combination of lysozyme and lactoperoxidase can be applied to support the treatment of the burning mouth syndrome (glossodynia). In combination with lactoferrin, lactoperoxidase combats halitosis; in combination with lactoferrin and lysozyme, lactoperoxidase helps to improve symptoms of xerostomia. Furthermore, gels with lactoperoxidase help to improve symptoms of oral cancer when saliva production is compromised due to irradiation. In this case, also the oral bacterial flora are influenced favorably.

During their lifetime, they released two singles, an EP, and recorded an album that was not released until 2013. Career The Lightning Raiders formed in August 1977 with an original lineup featuring Johnny Hodge (known as Little John) on guitar, Andy Allan on guitar/vocals, ex-Pink Fairies Duncan ('Danger Sun') Sanderson on bass/vocals, Jorge Panchito on drums and Michael Wilding on saxophone.The Complete Rock Family Trees, by Pete Frame (Omnibus Press, 1993), In February 1978, ex-Pink Fairies drummer/singer Twink released an EP called \\"Do It '77\\" with the help of band members Sanderson and Hodge. Twink had already recorded his intended single with his regular band but \\"Chiswick Records didn't like the track and I jammed \\"Do It\\" with the Lightning Raiders, which they preferred.\\" Sanderson recalled, \\"Twink came round my house and dragged me down the studio while I was still asleep one morning, and Little John Hodge just came along to deliver a guitar. Twink had us jam through \\"Do It\\", so we did it. Kid [Rogers (guitar)] and John hadn't even heard the flaming song before. At the end he jumps up and says 'That's it, thanks lads!' We didn't even know it was being taped!\\" Twink's comment on this was that \\"A second take of \\"Do It\\" is a contradiction in terms.\\" The EP was credited to 'Twink & The Fairies'. The band had a loose membership policy, at one time joining Larry Wallis and Duncan Sanderson onstage as The Pink Fairies with Little John and Jorge Panchito completely unrehearsed to fulfil concert obligations. \\"Psychedelic Musik\\" On 31 March 1980, a lineup including Little John on guitar, Andy Allan on Bass, Paul Cook on drums, and Steve Jones on guitar released a 7\\" single, \\"Psychedelic Musik\\", on Arista Records. The two members of the Sex Pistols were never official members of the band - they were repaying a debt to Allan who played bass on the Sex Pistols single, \\"Silly Thing\\". \\"Criminal World\\" In the next lineup, formed in November 1980, Hodge and Sanderson were joined by Gass Wild on lead vocals (who later drummed with Johnny Thunders and the Chrissie Hynde Band), Bruce Irvine on guitar (later with Sean Tyla's Tyla Gang), and George Butler (ex-Kilburn and the High Roads) on drums. In 1981, this lineup put out \\"Criminal World\\" with Revenge Records. They then recorded the Will Reid Dick produced 12\\" EP for Island Records (under the Revenge label), which included the songs \\"Sweet Revenge\\", \\"Rowdies\\", \\"Addiction\\", and \\"Soul Rescue\\". This was to be a preview of the forthcoming LP Sweet Revenge, but in December 1981 they were dropped by the label, making the soon deleted EP very rare. This lineup was popular on the club circuit, playing in various clubs such as Dingwalls, the Marquee Club the Music Machine, The Venue, and many more, often with support from heavy rock trio Killerhertz consisting of Hugo Mallett (guitar) Doug McArthur (bass) and former Chelsea drummer Marc Rathbone. Another support act for the Raiders were long haired glam boys Kitsch (under the same management as the Raiders). Kitsch bass player Paul Raven went on to join London cult band, Killing Joke. The Lightning Raiders along with Killerhertz and former Raider Andy Allan, performed at the 1981 Stonehenge Free Festival. Little John went on to record briefly with Chelsea and play live with Lena Zavaroni in her father's Kilburn pub. Hodge left the band in February 1982, though the remaining members continued for a time. Duncan Sanderson and George Butler played with Larry Wallis in a series of bands during the early 1980s, until the reformation of the Pink Fairies and, later, The Deviants at which point George Butler was replaced by Russell Hunter (original Pink Fairy/Deviant). Little John Hodge recorded and performed with Bert Jansch for the latter's album, Edge of a Dream, which included the Hodge song \\"La Luna\\" inspired by Aleister Crowley. Jansch repaid the favour by appearing on Hodge's solo CD La Luna as second guitarist on a number of tracks. Sweet Revenge The 2013, a truncated version of the Lighting Raiders 'lost' album, Sweet Revengewas released. NYC reunion / Lost Rockers In 2009, Hodge visited New York to reunite with Gass Wild for two 'Lightning Raiders' reunion shows with guest American musicians, to promote a forthcoming documentary and book Lost Rockers,. In the film Lemmy of Mot√∂rhead praises the band. Where are they now? Johnny Hodge died at home in Camden Town in 2012, George Butler and Duncan Sanderson have both died too.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. History The church was built in the 12th century, altered in 1845‚Äì46, and restored in 1880 by Ewan Christian. In 1845‚Äì46 the nave, north aisle and porch were demolished. At this time the font, piscina and some carvings were removed to a new church built in the village. The church was declared redundant on 11 June 1971, and was vested in the Trust on 7 November 1972. Architecture Ireby Old Church is constructed in blocks of sandstone and limestone, and it has a green slate roof. Only the former two- bay chancel remains. At its west end is an open bellcote. The door is at the west end in the blocked former chancel arch. It has a 19th-century surround over which is a re-used 12th-century tympanum and a built-in medieval grave slab. In the north wall is a blocked doorway, and a square window dating from the 18th century. The east wall contains three small round-headed windows, with one similar window above; this wall contains more built-in medieval slabs. Inside the church, the east wall contains a restored three-bay arcade. Also built into the east wall is a stone altar shelf over which is a carved medieval cross. There are two blocked 13th-century windows in the south wall; these are not visible from the exterior. Memorials include a wall plaque dated 1626 and an aedicule (small shrine) dated 1769. External features In the churchyard are two 13th-century octagonal columns with capitals that formerly stood in the nave of the church. In 1845‚Äì46 they were moved to the village where they acted as gateposts for a house. In 1933‚Äì34, excavations revealed the former bases of these columns and, following the 1972 restoration, the columns were returned to their original positions, now to the west of the church.

In 1981, they created the Factory Sound Studio and the SAIFAM Group. The pair have been recognized as founders of HI- NRG, the genre in which they achieved their first gold records, thanks largely to localized translations of their songs in the Asian market. In the early 1990s, their hits included \\"What's Up\\" by DJ Miko, \\"Moments in Soul\\" by JT and the Big Family, and \\"Venus\\" by Don Pablo's Animals, which entered the European and American charts. Since the mid 1990s, thanks to the birth of the Arsenic Sound division of their company, other hits are being produced such as the Zombie Nation Remix which entered the official charts in Europe, America and Asia. Perhaps their greatest international success came in 1998 with the dance track \\"Free\\" by female duo Bacon Popper. The 2000s saw releases \\"La Follia\\" by DJ Frederik, as well as Italian Hip Hop records from Club Dogo, Mondo Marcio, and Fabri Fibra on the Italian National Indies Sales Charts.

While there, she was discovered by Vittorio De Sica and subsequently made her debut at age 22 in his 1941 film Teresa Venerd√¨ as the title character. In 1942, she appeared in director Alessandro Blasetti's celebrated Quattro passi fra le nuvole, where she supported Gino Cervi in Luigi Zampa's C'√® sempre un ma!, and Avanti c'√® posto..., alongside Andrea Checchi and Aldo Fabrizi. In 1943, she played in Mario Soldati's Quartieri alti with Massimo Serato and Vittorio Sanipoli and in Marc All√©gret's Les Petites du quai aux fleurs with Bernard Blier and G√©rard Philipe. In 1945, she appeared in two musicals, Torna a Sorrento with Gino Bechi and O sole mio with opera singer Tito Gobbi. In 1946, she appeared with Fosco Giachetti in Il sole di Montecassino and with Eduardo and Titina De Filippo in Uno tra la folla. In 1947, she appeared in Goffredo Alessandrini's Furia, alongside Rossano Brazzi, in Giorgio Ferroni's Tombolo, paradiso nero with Lucio De Caro and in Man√π il contrabbandiere with Andr√© Cayatte.

In her subsequent short career in British service as HMS Espoir she captured three prizes, with the capture in 1798 of the more heavily armed Genoese pirate Liguria earning her crew a clasp to the Naval General Service Medal. Espoir was laid up in 1799 and sold in 1804. Construction L'Espoir was one of six brig-sloops of the Hasard class, designed by Raymond-Antoine Haran. She was built in Bayonne between December 1787 and April 1788, and launched in March 1788. She originally mounted just 4-pounder guns and carried a crew of 5 officers and 65 ratings; by 1794 she carried twelve 6-pounder guns and 125 men. French service Espoir cruised the coasts of Newfoundland while under the command of chevalier de Fabry, lieutenant de vaisseau, around 17 August 1790. Between 13 July 1792 and 12 January 1793, Espoir carried dispatches to Senegal, and then returned. At the time she was under the command of enseigne de vaisseau, later lieutenant de vaisseau, Martin. Espoir sailed from Rochefort to Verdon, escorted a convoy from Verdon to Rochelle, cruised and conducted escorts on the coasts of Poitou and la Charente, and between Rochefort and Bayonne, and escorted a convoy from France to Cayenne. Between 5 February and 17 July 1793 she was under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Charles-Nicolas Lacaille; in August her commander was lieutenant de vaisseau Vignier. Espoir was renamed Lazouski (or Lazousky) on 28 September 1793 (in honour of Revolutionary leader Claude Fran√ßois Lazowski). She escorted convoys between Bayonne and Brest, cruised in the Bay of Biscay and south of Ireland, and was at Rochefort. From 1 January 1794 to 22 May, she was under the command of enseigne de vaisseau, later lieutenant de vaisseau, Farjanel. Then between 27 May and 8 September her captain was enseigne de vaisseau non entretenu Barb√©. On 26 May 1795 her captain was lieutenant de vaisseau Barr√®re. Under his command Lazouski, based at Rochefort, cruised the Gulf of Gascony, and escorted a convoy from Rochelle to Pasajes. Lazouski reverted to the name Espoir on 30 May 1795. Around 15 July, while under the command of Lieutenant de vaisseau Goyeteche, Espoir escorted merchant vessels from Saint-Jean-de-Luz to Bayonne. From 20 August 1797 until her capture, Espoir was under the command of enseigne de vaisseau Pairaudeau. He sailed her to Cayenne, and then cruised east of Bermuda. Capture Thalia, under Captain Lord Henry Paulet, captured Espoir in the Mediterranean on 18 September 1797. She had sailed from Cayenne and earlier had been in company with the French corvette Gait√©, which however the British frigate had captured on 10 August. Thalia shared the prize money for Espoir with and . British service The British rearmed Espoir with fourteen 6-pounder guns and gave her a crew of 80 men. She was commissioned in June 1798 in the Mediterranean under Commander Loftus Otway Bland. On 7 August she was escorting the Oran convoy when she encountered the Genoese pirate, the 26-gun Liguria, some three leagues off Cape Windmill. Bland sailed to meet the vessel, which ordered him to surrender and then fired on Espoir. Liguria mounted twelve 18-pounder guns, four 12-pounder guns, and ten 6-pounder guns. She also carried 12 wall-pieces, and four swivel guns. Lastly, she had a crew of 120 men. She thus outgunned and outnumbered Espoir. After several broadsides and some lulls, lasting in all perhaps four hours, Ligouria struck her colors. She had lost her boatswain and six men killed, and 14 men wounded, including her commander Don Francisco de Orso dangerously so. Espoir lost her master killed, and had six men wounded, of whom two were badly wounded.James (1837), Vol. 2, pp.227-8. Liguria was a Dutch frigate that had been sold to the Genoese. Bland received a promotion to post-captain, with seniority of 25 September 1798. In 1847 the Admiralty issued the clasp \\"Espoir 7 Augt. 1798\\" to the Naval General Service Medal to the one surviving claimant from that action. shared in the prize money for Liguria. Then on 18 October, Espoir and Corso captured the Madonna de Ydra. On 29 October, between Tarifa and Tangiers, Espoir captured the 8-gun cutter Fulminante, which had had the \\"impudence\\" (in Bland's words) to attack Espoir.The Naval Chronicle, Vol. 1, p.76. Admiral Jervis, Earl of St Vincent, needing an advice boat, took her into service the next day as . Fulminante had a short career, being wrecked on the Egyptian coast on 24 March 1801. On 2 December 1798, Espoirs boats assisted Corso in bringing off a small French privateer that Corso had run ashore about three leagues east of Malabar Bay, near Gibraltar. When the boarding party arrived at the vessel they found that her crew had deserted her. The privateer was armed with two carriage guns, two swivels, and small arms. Corso and Espoir shared the prize money for the vessel, which turned out to be the barque Adolphe. In late 1798 or early 1799, command of Espoir transferred to Commander James Sanders. (When Bland handed over command he reported that he considered Espoir to be unseaworthy.Marshall (1825), Vol. 2, Part 2, p.641-2.) Under Sanders's command she took her last prize on 22 February 1799, the Spanish 14-gun xebec Africa some three leagues from Marbello on the Spanish coast. Espoir sighted two xebecs and a brig. One of the two xebecs hoisted Spanish colours and it and the brig formed in line ahead to engage Espoir. (They had cast off a Moorish vessel, which was a prize.) After exchanging broadsides with the xebec and the brig, Espoir was able to bring the xebec Africa, Captain Josepho Subjado, to close action. Africa mounted 14 long Spanish 4-pounder guns and four brass 4-pounder swivels, and had a crew of 75 seamen and 38 soldiers from Algosamus, bound to Malaga. After exchanging fire for an hour and a half, Espoir seized the opportunity to board Africa. The British captured the xebec after a 20-minute fight on board. Africa's two consorts effected their escape; the fleeing brig alone had 18 guns.James (1837), Vol. 2, p.324. Espoir lost two seamen killed and two wounded. Africa lost one officer and eight seamen killed, and her commander, two other officers and 25 seamen wounded. was in sight and her commander, Captain Cuthbert, transmitted Sanders's letter, adding his own endorsement extolling \\"the meritorious Conduct of Captain Sanders and his Ship's Company on the Occasion.\\" Espoir and Majestic shared the prize money for the xebec, whose full name was Nostra Senora de Africa. On 12 May Espoir arrived at Palermo bearing the news that the French fleet had been sighted off Oporto and was believed to be sailing to the Mediterranean. In June Espoir was off Cape delle Melle with Lord Keith's fleet. Although the frigate had run into Espoir during the night, stoving in her larboard side, Espoir still took part in Keith's squadron's pursuit of a French squadron in the Action of 18 June 1799. Espoir later shared in the prize money for the capture of the three frigates , Alceste, and Junon, and the two French brigs Alerte and Salamine. While at Gibraltar Sanders observed Spanish gunboats capture a merchant brig between Cabrita Point and Ceuta. He set out at sunset and recaptured the brig, while sinking one of the gunboats. He went on to save several English merchant vessels from the Algeciras flotilla and captured or destroyed several privateers and trading vessels. Some of these encounters involved an action but none resulted in material injury or damage to Espoir. Fate Espoir arrived in Sheerness on 14 October and was paid off in December. She then went into dock. Here several feet of her counter fell out when the copper was removed, bearing out Bland's earlier condemnation of her condition. Espoir was laid up in December. She was sold at Sheerness in September 1804.

He is currently Artistic Director and Chief Conductor of the Saint Petersburg Symphony Orchestra.  Biography = Childhood and the beginning of the career  Sergei Stadler was born on May 20, 1962 in Leningrad. He began to study music at the age of 5. His mother, a pianist and accompanist of the St. Petersburg Conservatory, taught him how to play the piano. He started to play the violin under the guidance of his father, the violist of the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra. Stadler graduated from the Special Music School under the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. Then he entered the Saint Petersburg Conservatory and graduated in three and a half years due to a busy concert and tour schedule. Later he was enrolled on postgraduate course of the Moscow Conservatory, after which Sergei Stadler began teaching violin art at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. His professors were B. Sergeev, M. Wayman, B. Gutnikov, L. Kogan, V. Tretyakov, one of his teachers was D. Oistrakh.  World fame  In 1984, after a tour with the Orchestra of the Saint Petersburg Philharmonic around Austria and Germany, his European fame came to the musician. 30 concerts were played, at which the music of Tchaikovsky, Brahms, Sibelius, Glazunov, Prokofiev was performed. H. von Karajan attended the concerts in Vienna. During this period, Sergei Stadler has been playing the Stradivarius violin, owned by the State Collection. Before Stadler, David Oistrakh had been playing the same instrument for sixteen years. December 13, 1985 was a remarkable day, because a joint concert with Svyatoslav Richter was held at the Museum A.S. Pushkin in Moscow, where Caprices by Paganini and Caprices by Schumann after Paganini sounded. Being the most welcomed guest on the 300th Bach‚Äôs anniversary, he played all the sonatas and partitas in the Church of St. Thomas in Leipzig in 1985.

The frontier was composed of a road following the border, a military stronghold, a three-metre vallum 10‚Äì12 metres wide, reinforced with wood palisades on stone walls, and also a ditch. The Transalutanus limes was 235 km long, parallel to Olt river at a distance varying from 5 to 30 km east of the river. The construction was started in 107 under the command of Marcius Turbo, and developed under Iulius Severus (120‚Äì126); the final stage of the construction was performed under Septimius Severus (193‚Äì211 d.C.).Transalutanus - red dotted line Between 244‚Äì247, under Philip the Arab, after the Carpian and Getae (or Goths, confusion due to Jordanes) attacks, the Roman Imperial army abandoned the limes for some time.

These three mounds form an east-west line on a small ridgeline in a farm field. Believed to have been built by Hopewellian peoples, the mounds are important because they may reveal information about daily life in the Hopewell culture. Archaeologists who study the Hopewell have generally concentrated on their largest ceremonial centers: as a result, while the mortuary customs of the Hopewell are well known, other aspects of their culture are little understood. For this reason, a site such as Ellis that bears the potential of yielding information about such aspects is valuable indeed, especially because its date has not yet been established: Ellis may have been built as early as 300 BC and as late as AD 600. Furthermore, the location of the mounds outside of the Hopewellian heartland farther south may demonstrate the spread of Hopewell influence, since excavations in numerous locations have demonstrated the necessity of assembling a complex society with many workers in order to construct the ceremonial mounds for which the Hopewell are well known. In 1974, the archaeological significance of the Ellis Mounds was recognized when they were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. They are one of seven National Register sites in Union County and the only one in the county's northern regions: three of the other six are within Marysville's city limits; the other three are south and west of Marysville.

Located north of Bowling Green in Wood County, the site was inhabited by Middle Woodland and Upper Mississippian peoples. Among the artifacts discovered at the site are ceramics and stone tools. The site's stratigraphy is obvious: the Middle Woodland village site and cemetery can easily be distinguished from the Upper Mississippian occupation zone that sits on top of it. While only a small portion of the 2.2 acre (0.89 ha) site has been excavated, the artifacts that have been discovered at Dodge have contributed significantly to an understanding of the western basin of Lake Erie around AD 1300. Enough material has been recovered to facilitate radiometric dating, as well as identifying the peoples who once inhabited the site. The excavations also revealed the intensity of occupation: the Middle Woodland layer was substantially larger than the exceptionally thin Upper Mississippian component.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1412.

Career Carr started her career by appearing as a dancer in Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In. Her first prominent role came in 1971, replacing actress Sandra Ego as Betty Ann Sundown in the western series Cade's County until 1972. Besides appearing in the series, she taught to Indian actors at Jay Silverheels's drama school in San Fernando Valley. On this work, she commented in a 1973 interview: :\\"Indians never were schooled in drama. If we want good actors we must begin by training the young; so I teach kids, 18 and under. For a while we had a busload of students from 12 to 16 coming in weekly from the Sherman Institute, but that stopped when the Institute ran out of money to pay the driver.\\" Carr, however, did not consider herself as an 'Indian actress' until casting directors rejected her at auditions because she looked \\"too ethnic\\" or \\"too dark\\" for non-Indian parts.\\"Indian Talent Finds Outlet In Theater Arts\\", Reading Eagle, October 11, 1973, p. 54 Carr is probably best remembered for appearing as Monica Bell in the daytime soap opera Return to Peyton Place, for which she flew from San Diego to Los Angeles.

J. Finnis (1966), Bull, John Wrathall (1804-1886) History= Early Life and Emigration  Born in St Paul's Cray, Kent, England, Bull was a dairy farmer in Cheshire and Bedfordshire, before applying as a farmer and shepherd for free passage to the new colony of South Australia. In May 1838, Bull arrived in Adelaide aboard Canton with his wife and two infant sons. He acted as an agent for absentee landholders in South Australia and farmed in the Mount Barker and Rapid Bay districts. In 1852, he visited the Victorian goldfields but returned to South Australia the following year.  Invention  Bull was known for his creation of the agricultural stripping machine which he developed but was controversially beaten to the title of the inventor by John Ridley. The controversy was revived in 1875, when the University of Adelaide proposed to establish a \\"Ridley\\" chair of agriculture. Bull successful petitioned parliament in 1880 for a grant of recognition of his invention and after a long inquiry, was given ¬£250 in 1882 \\"for services in improving agricultural machinery\\". Later research has supported Ridley's claim.  Military Service  Also involved in South Australia's colonial militia, Bull was made lieutenant in command of the companies at Mitcham and Glen Osmond.  Authorship  Bull's major contribution to the history of colonial South Australia was the publication of his Early Experiences of Colonial Life in South Australia (Adelaide, 1878), a series of more-or-less coherent reminiscences originally published in serial form over eight months in The South Australian Chronicle and Weekly Mail, the earliest installments having first appeared in the associated daily The Advertiser. Revised and enlarged with more of the same, the work was republished in Adelaide and London in 1884.  Death  Bull died at College Park on 21 September 1886 and was survived by two of his ten children. Family Three children of Rev. J.

It is a tufted, perennial herbs with narrow, linear leaves and between three and twenty large, drooping, cylindrical to bell-shaped flowers. The flowers are brownish red with yellow tips. It is one of four species of Blandfordia known as Christmas bells, this one growing on the coast and ranges south of Sydney. Description Blandfordia nobilis has thick, fibrous roots that can form strong, long-lived clumps. The leaves are stiff and grassy, up to long and wide, sometimes with small teeth. The flowering stems is unbranched, up to long and wide with between three and twenty flowers, each on a pedicel stalk up to long with a small bract near its base. The three sepals and three petals are fused to form a cylindrical flower usually long and about wide. The base of the flower is narrowed and the end has six pointed lobes about long. The flower is usually brownish red with yellow lobes. The stamens are attached to the inside wall of the flower tube, just below its middle. Flowering occurs from late spring to summer and is followed by the fruit which is a capsule about long on a stalk up to long. Taxonomy and naming Blandfordia nobilis was first formally described in 1804 by English botanist James Edward Smith who published the description in Exotic Botany from dried specimens sent from Sydney by the colonial surgeon, John White. The type specimen was collected from Port Jackson about the year 1800. Blandfordia nobilis was first published in 1804 by English botanist James Edward Smith, and it still bears its original name. The specific epithet (nobilis) is a Latin word meaning \\"well- known\\", \\"celebrated\\" or \\"noble\\". Distribution and habitat Blandfordia nobilis grows on poor sandstone soils and swampy areas, between the towns of Sydney, Milton and Braidwood. In wet heathland it is associated with sundews (Drosera) and Schoenus brevifolius. Use in horticulture Seeds of B. nobilis were sent to English plant nurseries at about the same time as dried specimens were sent to the botanist, Smith. However, it was not until 1818 that the plants first flowered. It is not clear which species had flowered as at least some species called B. cunninghamii were in fact B. nobilis. Culture Blandiflora nobilis is the subject of a Christmas Song \\"My Little Christmas Belle\\" published in 1909 by Sydney's popular song composer Joe Slater (1872-1926) with lyrics by Scottish entertainer Ward McAlister (1872-1928). The copy in the National Library of Australia bears a cartoon depiction of the blossom.

Youth  Carmen Romero Rubio was born on January 20 of 1864 in Tula, Tamaulipas to a wealthy family. Her parents were prominent liberal polititian and lawyer Manuel Romero Rubio, and Agustina Castell√≥. Her godfather was Sebasti√°n Lerdo de Tejada. She had two sisters, Mar√≠a Luisa (Luisa) and Sofia (Chofa). Known as \\"Carmelita,\\" she celebrated her saint's day on the feast of the Virgin of Mt. Carmel, on 16 July. Her friends and family members organized festivals in her honor in Carmelite convents during her lifetime.  Marriage  Carmen's father was active in Mexican politics during the late 1860s and 1870s. The Rubios were acquaintances, and frequent guests, of the American ambassador, John W. Foster. It was during a reception at the American embassy that General Porfirio D√≠az met Carmen Romero Rubio. She agreed to teach him English, and a closer relationship evolved. On November 5, 1881, don Porfirio married Carmen Romero Rubio in a civil ceremony, with the President of Mexico Manuel Gonz√°lez serving as witness, according to the new secular Reform Laws. The next day, the religious ceremony took place. The couple received the blessing of Archbishop Antonio de Labastida y D√°valos. They honeymooned in the United States, traveling across the country, using the opportunity to establish important contacts with American politicians and businessmen whom D√≠az hoped would invest in Mexico. Mexican historians have seen the marriage as an important alliance between two rival factions of the Liberal Party (D√≠az's and Lerdo's), but also as the beginning of D√≠az's conciliatory rapprochement with the Roman Catholic Church. The apocryphal memoirs of Sebasti√°n Lerdo de Tejada stress the importance of her mother‚Äîand not Carmen‚Äîin aiding D√≠az's relations with the Church.  First Lady of Mexico  A year and a half year after the death of Delfina Ortega, first wife of General Porfirio D√≠az, Carmen Romero Rubio succeeded her in the role of First Lady of the Nation. Romero Rubio modeled her activities as First Lady on the traditional role of rulers' wives. In Mexico, the Spanish vicereine had long been the patron of religious and social affairs, and this role had been expanded by empress Carlota during her brief reign, to include the protection of the arts and the encouragement of social reforms. Carmen expanded on this, accompanying D√≠az at public events. Her copious correspondence was managed by a special department of the President's office and she helped to host visiting personages. She attended religious, civic, and cultural events. Working with the wives of cabinet members, governors, and regional oligarchs, she formed and chaired relief committees responding to natural disasters. Her work on behalf of the children of working class women in the nation's capital established a number of day care centers, schools, and benevolent associations, including \\"La Casa Amiga de la Obrera\\" founded in 1887. She also saw to the upbringing of D√≠az's children, arranging marriages to prominent families. Rubio Romero served as First Lady for three decades, from when Diaz took office on December 1 by 1884 until his resignation on May 25 of 1911.  The exile, return, last years and death  In Paris, Carmelita accompanied her husband in his exile to France in 1911. They lived in Paris in rented apartments, never buying a home, frequently moving and traveling. They toured Europe and visited Egypt. After the general's death in 1915, Carmen remained in France for nearly two decades, living from investments in Mexican oil companies and rental income. She played an important role in the rituals of the Mexican colony in Paris, organizing memorial masses for D√≠az and for the feast of the Virgin of Guadalupe. Carmelita spent much of her time traveling around France and Spain, and frequently summered at her stepson Porfirio's chateau de Moulins, close to Landes-le-Gaulois. Carmen returned to Mexico in 1934, accompanied by her sister Chofa aboard the French steamer \\"Mexique.\\" She resided for some time in Mexico City's Colonia Roma, on no. 20 Tonal√° Street, in a home that belonged to her niece Teresa Castell√≥. On June 25, 1944, Carmen Romero Rubio y Castell√≥ died in Mexico City at eighty years of age. She was buried at the Pante√≥n Franc√©s (French Cemetery), and the mass was officiated by the Archbishop Luis Mar√≠a Mart√≠nez. Salvador Novo wrote an excellent cr√≥nica of her funeral.

The first case of the virus was obtained from a colony of rhesus monkeys in Yaba, Lagos, Nigeria. The virus caused the formation of tumors on the bodies of the monkeys. From these tumors the virus was isolated and determined to be its own species of virus. It is a species of the Yatapoxvirus genus and is closely related to the tanapox. The virus gets its name from the suburb of Yaba, Lagos.  Signs and symptoms  The Yaba monkey tumor virus is characterized by the formation of cutaneous histiocytomas. These cutaneous histiocytomas may form on the face, palms, digits, forearm, surfaces of the nose, sinuses, lips, palate. The tumors are visible within 4‚Äì5 days after infection of the virus. In rhesus monkeys the virus has a tendency to affect the face and sinuses causing large tumors to form. In general the only symptoms of the virus will be the formation of tumors.  Virus  The Yaba monkey tumor virus (YMTV) is considered a chordopoxvirus due to its ability to infect vertebrates and consists of linear double-stranded DNA. Being a part of the genus Yatapoxvirus, the YMTV is only able to infect primates - which includes humans. The virus can be transmitted by direct contact on the skin or by transmission from mosquitos. The vaccinia virus is a known prevention method for the Monkey Poxvirus through intradermal inoculation, it has been found that intradermal inoculation of the vaccinia virus does not provide resistance to the Yaba monkey tumor virus however. For more information on the virus the Tanapox virus similar.  Treatment  The tumors are known to resolve on their own after between 2‚Äì3 months after infection. Currently the best known treatment for the virus is the removal of the cutaneous tumors and subsequent treatment with antibiotics to prevent infection of the open wounds. The best method of preventing infection is to wear gloves and protective clothing while handling infected primates.  Epidemiology and history  The virus was first visualized after an outbreak of cutaneous histiocytomas in rhesus monkeys which were kept outdoors in 1956 Yaba, Lagos Nigeria. The virus has not been yet been observed in wild animals. This virus is transmittable to humans and has been transmitted in the past through handling of the monkeys, the symptoms are generally the same observed in the monkeys. There have only been a few cases of the virus transmitting to humans, with little documentation.

The NWDC is a 501 (c)(3) tax-exempt corporation which includes a mountain park, lodge, gift shop, and museum in Beulah, a small museum and educational center as well as an open-space park on the Arkansas River in Pueblo, and an adjacent raptor education and rehabilitation facility. The Nature and Wildlife Discovery Center offers access to two unique areas of Pueblo County. The NWDC's River Campus is located in Rock Canyon on the banks of the Arkansas River, and includes a blend of aquatic, riparian, transition, and semi-arid shortgrass prairie habitats. The Raptor Center is adjacent, just up the bluffs from the river. The NWDC Mountain Campus is located in Beulah, CO, offering visitors a blend of ponderosa pine and mixed fir forests as well as foothills transition habitats and access to the adjacent San Isabel National Forest. The mission of the Nature and Wildlife Discovery Center is to provide a variety of outdoor experiences in education, conservation and recreation that appeal to all ages and enhance the quality of life in Pueblo County, as well as to foster environmental stewardship and an appreciation of natural habitats. In addition, the NWDC encourages self-directed outdoor activities at each of its locations, and welcomes residents and visitors alike to come enjoy the magic of Southern Colorado on its beautiful lands. History The Arkansas Valley Audubon Society founded the Audubon River Trails Nature Center in 1979 to preserve an area where people from Pueblo and the surrounding areas could observe, explore, and enjoy nature. In 1981, the Raptor Center was added. In 1983 the nature center incorporated as a 501 (c)(3) tax-exempt organization as \\"The Greenway and Nature Center of Pueblo.\\" In 2008 the name was again changed to \\"Nature and Raptor Center of Pueblo.\\" Meanwhile, the Pueblo Mountain Park was operated as a property owned by the City of Pueblo, CO, which first purchased the land in 1920 at the behest of the San Isabel Public Recreation Association, itself inspire by the United States Forest Service visionary Arthur Carhart. During the aftermath of the Great Depression, crews from the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) constructed several facilities at the Mountain Park, including the original Horseshoe Lodge, the Pavilion, the Ballfield, and many road grades and bridges. As the 20th century wore on, the property went through periods of disuse, and at times the City of Pueblo considered selling it. In 1999, the Mountain Park Environmental Association was formed by a group of Pueblo citizens, with the intent of facilitating development of programs and access to the mountain park property. Since 2000, this organization, which became the Mountain Park Environmental Center and later merged with the Nature and Raptor Center of Pueblo to form the current Nature and Wildlife Discovery Center, has managed the park on behalf of the City of Pueblo, which retains ownership of the land. \\"Mountain Park Environmental Center\\" and the \\"Nature and Raptor Center of Pueblo\\", which combined into one organization in early 2018. Previously, these organizations were known as the Pueblo Mountain Park and Greenway and Nature Center of Pueblo, respectively. They operate as the Nature and Wildlife Discovery Center (NWDC), and run a variety of programs at two campuses to engage the public with nature and expand access to natural spaces. Facilities The Nature and Wildlife Discovery Center hosts a wide variety of opportunities at its two campuses. The River Campus offers a blend of aquatic, riparian, transition, and semi-arid grassland habitats, and offers picnicking, wildlife viewing, fishing, kayaking, and nature walks, as well as access to the Pueblo River Trail System, Honor Farm Open Space Park, and the Pueblo Motorsports Park. Users may also access the Pueblo Whitewater Park, Valco Ponds and Lake Pueblo State Park from the trails adjacent to the River Campus. The Raptor Center, which was founded in 1981 and forms part of NWDC's River Campus, specializes in rehabilitation of birds of prey. Injured and orphaned birds of prey from throughout southeastern Colorado are admitted to the facility and cared for with the hope that they can be returned to the wild. The Raptor Center hosts thousands of visitors annually, including out- of-town visitors, college students, K-12 students, and the interested public. Through a partnership with the Pueblo Zoo, some birds of prey which are unable to be successfully released are able to live at the zoo, providing educational opportunity for the public and a good life for the bird, who may not otherwise survive if released to the wild. Horseshoe Lodge in Pueblo Mountain Park The Mountain Park Campus is located in beautiful Beulah, CO, just 25 miles and a 30-minute drive WSW of Pueblo on CO-78. Though close to town it is a world apart, offering access to miles and miles of trails, both within the park's boundaries and on adjacent federal land owned and managed by the United States Forest Service as part of the San Isabel National Forest. The park also features Works Progress Administration-era construction of bridges and other structures, including the renovated Horseshoe Lodge, which hosts a small museum, gift shop, and overnight lodging to suit a variety of tastes. The park extends across a variety of ecosystems in the foothills transition zone, showcasing forests of ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, white fir, and juniper and oak shrublands. Events The Nature and Wildlife Discovery Center hosts the Colorado Owl Festival each fall, showcasing the variety of species present in our area with an eye toward education and fundraising for rehabilitation programs. Another annual event is the Raptor Resolution Run, a 5-mile run and 2.5 mile walk through Rock Canyon which kicks off with the release of a live raptor each December. In February, the Nature and Raptor Center along with Colorado Parks and Wildlife and the Pueblo Zoo team up to put on Eagle Days at the River Campus. In April, the Nature and Raptor Center puts together their annual Earth Day Events to honor their environmental heroes in the community. In November, NWDC hosts their annual fundraising breakfast. Education The Nature and Wildlife Discovery Center provides a wide variety of experiential education to local K-12 students, college and university students, interest groups, and the general public. There are Weekend Raptor Talks at 11:30am on Saturdays and Sundays at the River Campus, a monthly 4th Saturday Birdwalk (led by members of the Arkansas Valley Audubon Society) and full-day Summer Nature Camps for children entering Kindergarten to 12th grade. Registration for camps begins in March and continues through May. Throughout the academic year, NWDC staff design and lead a signature environmental science program called Earth Studies, which uses the outdoor spaces at both campuses to teach concepts in the natural sciences. Students visit each campus a number of times and experience the seasons, the wildlife, the plants and the land across the year. NWDC also operates an early-childhood preschool program called Earthkeeper Nature School. For children ages 4‚Äì7, it offers a progressive, nature-based curriculum at both campuses. Both the Earthkeeper Nature School and Earth Studies have received awards for excellent programming. Students from Pueblo Community College and Colorado State University-Pueblo also visit NWDC's campuses to develop skills in outdoor education. Conservation Each year, the Raptor Center admits, rehabilitates and releases hundreds of injured, orphaned or otherwise compromised eagles, hawks, owls, falcons, vultures, and other birds of prey. NWDC has partnered with Southern Colorado Trail Builders to design and construct the Carhart Trail, a multi-use trail at the Mountain Campus which connects to Squirrel Creek campground and trail system in the San Isabel National Forest. The Carhart trail is the first trail at the Mountain Campus accessible to mountain bikers as well as pedestrians and horseback riders. The Carhart Trail is named for Arthur Carhart, an early pioneer in the design of recreational access points for National Forest lands. NWDC also hosts annual river cleanups at the River Campus, coordinating volunteers in cleaning the banks of the Arkansas River through Rock Canyon.

Billy Boyle books This series of books centers on fictional Boston Police Department detective Billy Boyle. He comes from a family line of cops with Irish Republican leanings. When America enters World War Two his father and others fear he will be killed defending the hated British, as was his uncle in World War One. Calling on family connections they arrange for Billy to be assigned to the staff of a cousin's husband, a little- known Army officer named Dwight D. Eisenhower. ‚ÄúUncle Ike‚Äù, as he is called in private, is soon promoted and takes Boyle with him as a staff investigator to solve crimes that require not only professionalism but discretion. Far from the safe stateside job his family back in Boston hoped for, Billy finds himself in great danger on every assignment. Other characters * Lieutenant Baron Piotr Augustus Kazimierz: Known as \\"Kaz\\", he was attending school in the United Kingdom when the Germans invaded Poland in 1939. His family all killed by the Nazis, Kaz joins the Polish government-in-exile and is assigned to Eisenhower's staff as a translator. He quickly develops a strong friendship with Billy and can often be found at his side in times of danger. * Daphne Seaton: Assigned to the Allied staff, she becomes the love interest of Kaz as well as Billy‚Äôs assistant in the first investigation. * Diane Seaton: Daphne‚Äôs sister, and Billy Boyle‚Äôs love interest. Haunted by memories of the Dunkirk evacuation, Diane joins the British SOE. A series of brutal missions behind enemy lines put not only her life in danger but her love with Boyle. * Sam Harding: Major, later Colonel, Sam Harding is a by-the- book West Pointer who is Boyle‚Äôs immediate commander. As the book series progresses he proves to be not only an able leader but someone of great loyalty, willing to take risks to protect Billy, Kaz, and the others under his command. The books * 1) The first novel in the series, Billy Boyle, was published by Soho Press in 2006. Second Lieutenant Boyle is charged with investigating a crime that endangers Allied operations in Norway and the Norwegian government-in-exile as well. Having hardly been out of Boston in his life, Billy ultimately finds himself behind the lines in occupied Norway, bent on stopping treason and avenging the death of a friend.

It is the naturally occurring form of bismuth oxychloride. The name was derived from its chemical constituents. It is a secondary bismuth mineral first thought to be composed of bismuthyl ions (BiO+) and chloride anions, however, the existence of the diatomic bismuthyl ion is doubtful. It is a member of the matlockite group. It was first described in 1935 from alluvium near bismuth-bearing pegmatites in South Africa. It has been found in association with granite pegmatite and in greisen. Associated minerals include bismutite, mica, jarosite, alunite, cerussite, atacamite, connellite. Occurrences include the type locality at Jackals Water, SW of Prieska, South Africa; Bygoo, Australia; the Tintic district in the East Tintic Mountains of Utah; and from Dalbeattie, Scotland.  Crystal structure  The crystal structure of bismoclite was found to be composed of linked decahedrons, specifically a square antiprism. These decahedrons consist of 2 squares with sides of 3.487 √Ö (O-O-O-O and Cl- Cl-Cl-Cl) connected by 8 isosceles triangles (O-Cl-O and Cl-O-Cl), with a bismuth atom at the centre. The Bi-O distances and Bi-Cl distances are 2.316 √Ö and 3.059 √Ö, respectively. The O-Cl distances in the triangles are 3.249 √Ö. The decahedrons are linked to each other through shared O-Cl sides.

History and achievements  Khartron Corp. was established in 1959 in Kharkiv, Ukraine. Founded as a government enterprise, Khartron Corp. changed its names several times, albeit remaining an intact entity. The main trend of its activity was development and implementation of control systems for ballistic missiles, carrier-boosters and space vehicles. It is Khartron that developed control systems for the formidable missiles SS-18 and SS-19, for the all scientific and technical modules of the MIR Space Station, and for the Zarya cargo module of the International Space Station. It was the main developer enterprise of the Energia rocket. Khartron is the only company in the world that provides automatic docking of the heavy 20-tons space vehicles in space environment. Under a radically changing economic environment, Khartron Corp. has had to adapt to civilian applications, thus executing the Government conversion Program. SS-18 and SS-19 were converted into space launchers Dnepr and Eurokot to orbit Ukrainian and foreign satellites. Khartron boasts several joint ventures and projects with companies in the USA, Germany, Italy, Russia, providing successful launches of commercial satellites. In 1994, a joint venture between Westinghouse Electric Company and Khartron - WestronWestron official website \\\\- was established. Westron JV has been successfully operating from its inception to this day modernizing I&C; systems for Ukrainian nuclear power plants. During his trip to Europe to Ukraine in June 2000, U.S. President Bill Clinton noted the importance of this particular cooperative effort to improve the safety of Ukraine's nuclear power plants.  Current state  Khartron is one of Ukraine's enterprises for reconstruction of Instrumentation and Control (I&C;) systems for Ukrainian nuclear power plants. Today's Khartron is a mini-conglomerate; parent of several partially owned subsidiary enterprises involved in their own businesses. Meeting the requirements of the national economy, Khartron's business segments range from control systems for fossil-fuel power plants to gas and oil pipelines to sugar plants to air traffic to agriculture to railroad stations and cars. Over ten years, Khartron has moved from an exclusively state-owned enterprise, to a joint stock company, whose products among others include commercial industrial control systems for fossil-fuel and nuclear power plants, transport, gas and oil pipelines.

Background On 21 October 1993, Burundi's first democratically elected Hutu president, Melchior Ndadaye, was assassinated by Tutsi extremists. As a result of the murder, violence broke out between the two groups, and an estimated 50,000 to 100,000 people died within a year. In 1994, Ndadaye's successor Cyprien Ntaryamira was assassinated in the same plane crash with Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana. This act marked the beginning of the Rwandan genocide, while in Burundi, the death of Ntaryamira exacerbated the violence and unrest, although there was no general massacre. Sylvestre Ntibantunganya was installed to a 4-year presidency on 8 April, but the security situation further declined. The influx of hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees and the activities of armed Hutu and Tutsi groups further destabilised the regime. Resolution After considering a report from a fact-finding mission to Burundi, the Council noted that an international committee would play a role in the investigation of the coup in 1993 and the subsequent massacre. The inquiry was a recommendation of the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and the Government of Burundi itself had called for its establishment and the massacres to be termed genocide. Violations of international humanitarian law had been committed in Burundi and the country's judicial system had to be strengthened. There was also serious concern about the resumption of radio broadcasts that called for ethnic hatred, and those responsible for violations would be held responsible. The Security Council then asked the Secretary- General to establish an international inquiry with the following mandate: :(a) to investigate the murder of the President of Burundi on 21 October 1993 and the subsequent massacre; :(b) to propose measures to bring those responsible to justice. The international commission would consist of five jurists selected by the Secretary-General. All countries and organisations with information were asked to provide it to the committee. Within three months, Boutros-Ghali was requested to report on the workings of the commission. All parties and institutions in Burundi were urged to co-operate with the commission of inquiry, by: :(a) adopting measures so that the committee can work freely; :(b) providing information to the commission that it requests; :(c) permit the commission to collect all relevant information; :(d) allow the commission to interrogate anyone; :(e) allow the commission to visit any place at any time; :(f) guaranteeing the safety, security and to respect freedom of witnesses.

Listed at 5' 7\\", 140 lb., she batted and threw right-handed. Overview profile A native of Cincinnati, Jochum was one of the sixty original founding members of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. An ideal leadoff hitter, she was one of the fastest runners in the early years of the league and rarely struck out, fanning only 104 times in 2,401 plate appearances, which combined with a stellar defense and a strong and secure throwing arm. In addition, she was an All-Star, won a batting title, collected 354 stolen bases, and pitched a full season during her six seasons in the league. Brief history Chewing gum magnate and Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley decided, in 1942, to start a women's professional baseball league, concerned that the 1943 Major League Baseball season might be canceled because of World War II. Since the only organized ball for women in the country was softball, the league created a hybrid game which included both softball and baseball. Wrigley had scouts all over the United States, Canada and even Cuba signing girls for tryouts. About 500 girls attended the call. Of these, only 280 were invited to the final try-outs in Chicago, where 60 of them were chosen to become the first women to ever play professional baseball. The girls were placed on the rosters of four fifteen-player teams: Kenosha Comets, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox. The first spring training was set for May 17, 1943, at Wrigley Field. By then, the average full-time worker made $1,299 a year or about $25 a week, according to one estimate. Players in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League were offered between $50 and $125 a week during a three-month, 108-game season. Of the six girls from Ohio who went to Chicago, Betsy Jochum and Dorothy Kamenshek were selected for the new league. Jochum was allocated to the Blue Sox and Kamenshek joined the Peaches. Early life Betsy was the daughter of Frank and Katherine Jochum, German-speaking Hungarians who immigrated to United States, landed at Ellis Island, and eventually arrived to Cincinnati, just before the World War began in 1917. Her father worked as a carpenter and cabinetmaker. She had an older brother, Nicholas, and her younger sister Frances. The siblings grew up together in a close household that held the value of family over anything else.Biographical Dictionary of American Sports ‚Äì David L. Porter. Publisher: Greenwood Press, 2000. Format: Hardcover, 2064pp. Language: English. Jochum started playing sandlot ball by the time she turned eight and organized softball at age 12. During her student years at Hughes Center High School, she took part in many intramural athletic events offered for girls: basketball, volleyball, track and field and softball.Encyclopedia of Women and Baseball ‚Äì Leslie A. Heaphy, Mel Anthony May. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2006. Format: Paperback, 438pp. Language: English. After graduating from high school, Jochum attended Cincinnati Business School and learned to operate the comptometer, the first commercially successful key-driven mechanical calculator. But Jochum came of age during the Great Depression when jobs were hard to find. She was forced to take an employment in a meat packing house, and played semi-professional softball on the company team in the Cincinnati League. The team participated in several national softball tournaments, including Chicago, Illinois.Biographical Dictionary of American Sports She also liked competing in Amateur Athletic Union track and field events such as the baseball throw. During a competition held in Connecticut in 1938, she posted a 276 feet mark which placed second only to Babe Zaharias, who threw the ball a national record of 296 feet. Later, she found a job in a dairy company doing comptometer work, earning $16 a week, before signing a contract for $50 per week to become an original member of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. AAGPBL career Betsy Jochum during the 1947 SeasonJochum entered the league in 1943 and spent her entire six-year career with the South Bend Blue Sox, one of two teams to play in every AAGPBL season, being the other the Rockford Peaches. Jochum appeared at center field and left, pitched, and also played first base for a long time when the regular was hurt. Because she played in a league that progressively expanded the length of the base paths and pitching distance and decreased the size of the ball until the final year of play in the 1954 season. Incidentally, the relatively low batting averages in the early years reflect mainly the high quality of AAGPBL pitchers, rather than a lack of skills by the hitters. In her rookie season, Jochum posted a .273 average and led the league in at-bats (439), hits (120), singles (100), and doubles (12). She also stole 66 bases, scored 70 runs, and led all hitters in the second half of the season with a .295 average. She was selected to the All-Star Game, which coincidentally was the first night game played at Wrigley Field, on July 1, 1943. The game was played under temporary lights between two teams composed of Blue Sox and Peaches players against Comets and Belles players.ESPN ‚Äì Reel Life: 'A League of Their Own', article by Jeff Merron Jochum led the circuit in her sophomore year of 1944 by hitting a respectable .296 average, considering the league's dead-ball era. She also posted career-numbers in games (112), runs (72), hits (128) and stolen bases (127), including seven steals in a game on August 2. Jochum dropped to .237 with 40 runs and 25 stolen bases in 1945 but rebounded in 1946 with a .250 average, including 64 runs, 73 stolen bases, 64 runs and a career-high 63 runs batted in. In that season, Dorothy Kamenshek led the league with a .316 average, while Bonnie Baker tied Sophie Kurys for second place at .286. With her .250 average, Jochum ranked third in her team and tenth overall for girls playing 90 or more games. She also tied with Kamenshek for the fewest strikeouts (10) and ranked second in RBI behind Elizabeth Mahon (72). Often a second-division team, the Blue Sox advanced to the playoffs for the first time in 1946, being beat in the first round by the Racine Belles, the eventual Championship Team after defeating the Rockford Peaches in six games.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book ‚Äì W. C. Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2000. Format: Paperback, 294pp. Language: English. In 1947, the league moved its spring training camp to Havana, Cuba. Two hundred girls made the trip to Havana, and for many, like Jochum, the flight was their first airplane trip. As she recalled in an interview with Jim Sargent, I took my first airplane flight, we stayed at the Seville-Biltmore Hotel, and we played our games at the Gran Stadium. All the teams were filmed for Fox News going down the steps at the University of Havana. The new rules applied during the regular season permitted a full sidearm pitching delivery, and many players who developed hitting underhand pitching had problems adjusting to the new pitching style. As a result of the innovation, Dorothy Kamenshek was the champion bat with a significant .306 average, Audrey Wagner was the leader with seven home runs, and Elizabeth Mahon topped all hitters with 53 runs batted in. Jochum was not an exception, as she slipped to .211, 42 RBI, 36 runs, and 44 stolen bases. For the second consecutive year South Bend made the playoffs, but again lost in the first round, this time to the Grand Rapids Chicks, who defeated the Racine Belles in seven games.All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Record Book The AAGPBL grew to an all-time peak of ten teams in 1948, the first year the league shifted to overhand pitching. Showing her versatility, the strong-armed Jochum was a natural choice to become a pitcher in her final season. She debuted against the Fort Wayne Daisies and limited them to a pair of hits, allowing only four batters to get on base (two by errors) while striking out five. At one point during the season, Jochum had a 13-6 record, but she lost seven of her last eight decisions to finish with a 14-13 mark. When she was not pitching, South Bend manager Marty McManus used her to fill at outfield, first base and pinch hit, even though she batted a low-career .195 average. Nevertheless, Jochum provided 14 of the 57 victories of her team, including a sparkling 1.51 earned run average, and striking out 103 batters while walking just 58 in 215 innings of work. Nevertheless, for the second straight year South Bend lost to Grand Rapids in the first round of the playoffs.

While playing for South Bend, she resumed her comptometer job in Cincinnati during the off-season. Jochum learned about the trade unofficially through a teammate, and she ultimately decided to retire. She had many good friends in South Bend, plus a new comptometer job at Bendix Home Appliances. Jochum also was disappointed because the Blue Sox boasted figures as Charlotte Armstrong, Bonnie Baker, Doris Barr, Margaret Berger, Lois Florreich, Rose Gacioch, Lillian Faralla, Elizabeth Mahon and Dorothy Schroeder, who were part of strong winning teams during her years there, but never was able to win a regular season title or a championship crown.A League Of My Own: Memoir of a Pitcher for the All-American Girls ‚Äì Patricia I.

The technique is related to conventional high-resolution laser spectroscopy for sensing and spectroscopy of gas (e.g. tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy, TDLAS), but the fact that the gas here is \\"hidden\\" inside solid materials give rise to important differences.  Basic Principles  Free gases exhibit very sharp spectral features, and different gas species have their own unique spectral fingerprints. At atmospheric pressure, absorption linewidths are typically on the order of 0.1 cm‚àí1 (i.e. ~3 GHz in optical frequency or 0.006 nm in wavelength), while solid media have dull spectral behavior with absorption features thousand times wider. By looking for the sharp absorption imprints in light emerging from porous samples, it is thus possible to detect gases confined in solids ‚Äì even though the solid often attenuates light much stronger than the gas itself. The basic principle of GASMAS is shown in figure 1. Laser light is sent into a sample with gas cavities, which could either be small pores (left) or larger gas-filled chambers. The heterogeneous nature of the porous material often give rise to strong light scattering, and pathlengths are often surprisingly long (10 or 100 times the sample dimension are not uncommon). In addition, light will experience absorption related to the solid material. When travelling through the material, light will travel partly through the pores, and will thus experience the spectrally sharp gas absorption. Light leaving the material will carry this information, and can be collected by a detector either in a transmission mode (left) or in a reflection mode (right). In order to detect the spectrally sharp fingerprints related to the gas, GASMAS has so far relied on high-resolution tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS). In principle, this means that a nearly monochromatic (narrow-bandwidth) laser is scanned across an absorption line of the gas, and a detector records the transmission profile. In order to increase sensitivity, modulation techniques are often employed. The strength of the gas absorption will depend, as given by the Beer-Lambert law, both on the gas concentration and the path-length that the light has travelled through the gas. In conventional TDLAS, the path- length is known and the concentration is readily calculated from the transmittance. In GASMAS, extensive scattering renders the pathlength unknown and the determination of gas concentration is aggravated. In many applications, however, the gas concentration is known and other parameters are in focus. Furthermore, as discussed in 2.2, there are complementing techniques that can provide information on the optical pathlength, thus allowing evaluation also of gas concentrations. File:GasmasPrinciple2.pdf  Challenges = Diffuse light  Unknown interaction pathlength  Optical interference noise  It is well known that optical interference often is a major problem in laser-based gas spectroscopy. In conventional laser-based gas spectrometers, the optical interference originates from e.g. etalon-type interference effects in (or between) optical components and multi-pass gas cells. Throughout the years, great efforts have been devoted to handle this problem. Proper optical design is important to minimize interference from the beginning (e.g. by tilting optical components, avoiding transmissive optics and using anti-reflection coating), but interference patterns can not be completely avoided and are often difficult to separate from gas absorption. Since gas spectroscopy often involves measurement of small absorption fractions (down to 10‚àí7), appropriate handling of interference is crucial. Utilised countermeasures include customized optical design, tailored laser modulation, mechanical dithering, signal post-processing, sample modulation, and baseline recording and interference subtraction. In the case of GASMAS, optical interference is particularly cumbersome. This is related to the severe speckle-type interference that originates from the interaction between laser light and highly scattering solid materials. Since this highly non-uniform interference is generated in same place as the utility signal, it cannot be removed by design. The optical properties of the porous material under study determines the interference pattern, and the level of interference is not seldom much stronger than actual gas absorption signals. Random mechanical dithering (e.g. laser beam dithering and/or sample rotation ) has been found effective in GASMAS. However, this approach converts stable interference into a random noise that must be averaged away, thus requiring longer acquisition times. Baseline recording and interference subtraction may be applicable in some GASMAS applications, as may other of the methods described above.  Applications = Medical diagnostics  See  Optical porosimetry  See  Monitoring of drying processes  See  Pharmaceutical applications  See  Monitoring of food and food packaging  Much of the food that we consume today is put in a wide variety of packages to ensure food quality and provide a possibility for transportation and distribution. Many of these packages are air or gas tight, making it difficult to study the gas composition without perforation. In many cases it is of great value to study the composition of gases without destroying the package. The perhaps best example is studies of the amount of oxygen in food packages. Oxygen is naturally present in most food and food packages as it is a major component in air. However, oxygen is also one of the great causes or needs for aging of biological substances, due to its source for increase of chemical and microbiological activity. Today, methods like [Modified atmosphere] (MAP) and [Controlled atmosphere] packaging (CAP) are implemented to reduce and control the oxygen content in food packages to prolong [shelf life] and ensure safe food. To assure the effectiveness of these methods it is important to regularly measure the concentration of oxygen (and other gases) inside these packages. GASMAS provides the possibility of doing this non-intrusively, without destroying any food or packages. The two main advantages of measuring the gas-composition in packages without perforation is that no food is wasted in the controlling process and that the same package can be controlled repeatedly during an extended time period to monitor any time-dependence of the gas composition. The studies can be used to guarantee the tightness of packages but also to study food deterioration processes. Much food itself contains free gas distributed in pores within. Examples are fruit, bread, flour, beans, cheese, etc. Also this gas can be of great value to study to monitor quality and maturity level (see e.g. and ).

It is a lustrous white solid used since antiquity, notably in ancient Egypt. Light wave interference from its plate-like structure gives a pearly iridescent light reflectivity similar to nacre. It is also known as pearl white. Structure The structure of bismuth oxychloride can be thought of as consisting of layers of Cl‚àí, Bi3+ and O2‚àí ions (in the image Bi = grey, O = red, Cl = green). These ions are ordered as Cl-Bi-O-Bi-Cl-Cl-Bi-O-Bi-Cl, i.e., with alternating anions (Cl‚àí, O2‚àí) and cations (Bi3+). The layered structure gives rise to the pearlescent properties of this material. Focusing on the coordination environment of the individual ions, the bismuth centers adopt a distorted square antiprismatic coordination geometry. The Bi3+ ion is coordinated to four chloride, forming one of the square faces, each at a distance of 3.06 √Ö from Bi, and four oxygen atoms forming the other square face, each at a distance of 2.32 √Ö from Bi. The oxygen atoms are tetrahedrally coordinated by four bismuth atoms. Synthesis and reactions BiOCl is formed during the reaction of bismuth chloride with water, i.e. the hydrolysis: :BiCl3 \\\\+ H2O ‚Üí BiOCl + 2 HCl When heated above 600 ¬∞C, BiOCl converts to the Bi24O31Cl10, called the \\"Arppe compound\\" which has a complex layer structure.

European countries have had varying policies that confine women and military service or the extent of their participation in the national armed services of their respective countries, especially combatant roles in armed conflicts or hostile environments. While most of the countries have always allowed women to participate in military activities involving no direct aggression with the enemy, most began seeing the value of servicewomen in the armed services during the First World War when they began losing unprecedented numbers of servicemen. In modern times many of the European countries now allow women to voluntarily pursue a career path or profession in the national armed services of their country as well as permit conscription equality, with minimal or no restrictions at all. Denmark Women were employed in the Danish armed forces as early as 1934 with the Ground Observer Corps, Danish Women's Army Corps and Naval Corps in 1946 and the Women's Air Force since 1953. In 1962 the Danish parliament passed laws allowing women to volunteer in the regular Danish armed forces as long as they did not serve in units experiencing direct combat. 1971 saw the enlistment of women as non- commissioned officers, with military academies allowing women in 1974. In 1978, based on the reports of studies on the topic, women were allowed to enlist in an all areas of the Danish armed forces, with combat trials in the eighties exploring the capabilities of women in combat. In 1998 laws were passed allowing women to sample military life in the same way as conscripted men, however without being completely open to conscription. Women in the Danish military come under the command of the Chief of Defense.NATO/IMS: Committee on Women in the NATO Forces: Denmark the highest rank reached by a woman in the Danish armed forces is Colonel (Susanne Bach Bager, Telegrafregimentet), with 5.2% (832) women in the services: 153 officers, 176 NCOs, and 503 privates (not counting women serving as \\"concripts\\").http://forsvaret.dk/FPT/Nyt%20og%20Presse/fakta/kvinderiforsvaret/Pages/default.aspx From the summer 2007 to July 2009 a total of 84 women have served in the Danish Battalion in Helmand province, Afghanistan. This includes frontline service in infantry units and active participation in combat. However recent recruitment of women has been low in Denmark due to rising job opportunities elsewhere. NATO reports also indicate that the Danish military does not promote women to positions of leadership. As with many nations with women in their armed forces, Denmark has different basic physical requirements for men and women in their armed forces, however the requirements for the more physically demanding jobs do not differ for either sex. Finland Finnish female soldiers swearing their military oath alongside male conscripts. The Finnish Defense Forces does not conscript women. However, since 1995, women between 18 and 30 years of age have the possibility of voluntarily undertaking military service in the Defence Forces or in the Border Guard. Females serve under the same conditions as men, with the exception that during the first 45 days of service they have the option to leave the military without consequences. After that, they must complete the service which lasts 6, 9 or 12 months. After the service, the females face the same reserve obligations as the males who have done the obligatory military service. If the female in national service experiences a conscientious crisis which prevents her from fulfilling her military service or reserve obligations, she is ordered to the alternative civilian service, which lasts 12 months.Law on the voluntary military service for women (194/1995) Retrieved 2-20-2007 All services and units in the Finnish Defence Forces and the Finnish Border Guard accept females.

During the Finnish Civil War, the Reds had several Naiskaarti (Women's Guard) units made of voluntary 16- to 35-year-old women, who were given rudimentary military training. The reactions on women in military were ambivalent during the Civil War.

Since the introduction of the voluntary military service, the women have mostly the same training as the men which has lessened the problems. Only a handful of women without military training, mostly nurses or social service personnel, are serving with the Finnish peace-keeping forces.

Painting by Edouard Moreau. In the 1800s, women in the French military were responsible for preparing meals for soldiers, and were called Cantini√®res. They sold food to soldiers beyond that which was given to them as rations. Cantini√®res had commissions from the administrators of the regiments, and they were required to be married to a soldier of the regiment. They served near the front lines on active campaigns, and some served for as long as 30 years. The role of women in the French military grew in 1914 with the recruitment of women as medical personnel (Service de Sant√© des Arm√©es). In 1939, they were authorized to enlist with the armed service branches, and in 1972 their status evolved to share the same ranks as those of men. Nonetheless, women are still not permitted to join the field combat units or to be aboard the submarines of the French navy. Val√©rie Andr√©, a neurosurgeon, became the first woman in France to attain the rank of three-star general as M√©decin G√©n√©ral Inspecteur. A veteran of the French Resistance, she served overseas in Indochina. During that period, she learned how to pilot a helicopter so that she could reach wounded soldiers who were trapped in the jungle. Andr√© is the first woman to have flown a helicopter in combat. She received many decorations for her achievements, including the highest rank of the Legion of Honour. She retired from active service in 1981. Many other French women were involved in the French Resistance. Germany Ulrike Flender‚Äîin 2007 became the first female German Air Force jet-fighter pilot and first German female Panavia Tornado pilot. Since the creation of the Bundeswehr in 1955, Germany had employed one of the most conservative gender-policies of any NATO country. That was generally regarded as a reaction to the deployment of young women at the end of World War II. Though women were exempt from direct combat functions in accordance with Nazi-ideology, several hundred thousand German women, along with young boys and sometimes girls (as Flakhelfer), served in Luftwaffe artillery units; their flak shot down thousands of Allied warplanes.D'Ann Campbell, \\"Women in Combat: The World War Two Experience in the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union\\" Journal of Military History (April 1993), 57:301-323 online. In the year 1975 the first female medical officers were appointed in the Sanit√§tsdienst (Medical corps) of the Bundeswehr. Since 1994, two women, Verena von Weymarn and Erika Franke, attained the rank of Generalarzt (Surgeon General). But it was not until January 2001 that women first joined German combat units, following a court ruling by the European Court of Justice. The change in the law was prompted after a qualified female electronics technician argued her case to the European Court of Justice after her application to join the Maintenance- Recovery Service (Electronics) technical unit of the German Armed Forces was rejected in 1996, citing \\"it is barred by German law for women to perform armed services\\". The court ruled that preventing women from occupying combat roles in the armed forces was against sexual equality principles. 244 of the first 1,900 women who signed up following the law change were admitted on the first day of the new rules, the majority of them joining the army and air force.Women join German fighting forces There are no restrictions regarding the branch of service, and there are women serving in the Fallschirmj√§ger (paratrooper), aboard submarines and jet-fighter aircraft. Before the law change 4,400 women only occupied military medicine or military-band roles within the German armed forces. The new legislations initially did not receive full military support. A report on the subject commented that, regarding the older male soldiers, \\"The way they see themselves as male fighters is shattered\\". Like many countries who have accepted women into combat roles, Germany conducts special courses on preventing sexual harassment. After several years of experience the commotion inside the Bundeswehr has now remarkably decreased. Today women are regularly being sent to foreign deployments.Germany Marks Five Years of Women in Armed Forces As of January 2010 about 16,900 female soldiers serve in the Bundeswehr, representing a share of 9 percent of all troops except conscripted soldiers. The German Bundeswehr now expects the percentage of all female personnel to rise to about 15 percent in the middle-term future.Starke Truppe ‚Äì Immer mehr Frauen entscheiden sich f√ºr die Bundeswehr (Powerful troop - more and more women join the Bundeswehr) In 2007 the first woman in the German air force received her jet-fighter licence.First woman to attain air force qualification as jet pilot A handful more are flying helicopters and transport planes. Ireland Women in the Irish Defence Forces may be assigned to \\"the full range of operational and administrative duties\\" and policy is to encourage increased female participation. , 601 of 8,957 personnel (6.7%) of the Permanent Defence Forces were female. Historically, the Defence Act 1954 allowed for women only in the Army Nursing Service. Exceptionally, Brigid Lyons Thornton was a medical officer in the nascent Free State Army in 1923 to 1924. Fianna F√°il's manifesto in the 1977 general election proposed \\"a Women's Service Corps, \\"; when it formed the next government it duly passed the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1979, which removed statutory prohibition on women in enlisted ranks and commissioned officers.; Conservatism from the general staff meant that until the early 1990s women were trained separately and restricted to light duties. The first female Irish Army recruits to the cadet school were in 1980 and the enlisted ranks in 1982.Clonan 2000 p.101 The first mixed-sex recruitment was in 1994. The 1990s saw integration, and the first women officers in the Naval Service in and the Air Corps.

Italy Italian parachutist During World War II, the Italian Social Republic established the Female Auxiliary Service () as an auxiliary service and their soldiers were known as Female Auxiliary Unit (). The law that introduced this unit provided that its existence be limited to war periods. Its equivalent in Southern Italy during World War II, was the CAF, , that was on the side of the Allies. This unit was also dismissed at the end of the war. Those who belonged to this unit were equivalent to sub-lieutenants and wore military uniforms made in Great Britain. In 1959, the Female Police unit () was established. In 1981, Diadora Bussani was the first woman who asked to be admitted into the Italian Naval Academy of Livorno (). She was born in 1962 in Trieste and started to try to join the academy in 1981. After being excluded from the application, Italy's regional administrative court upheld the appeal; however, Italy's State Council overturned the judgment. The enlisting of a woman seemed to be legally feasible because of the Italian law Legge 1963 n. 66, which allowed the enrollment of women in public positions, but Italy's State Council excluded the military because of biological differences between male and female human bodies. When Diadora Bussani became famous and the case was well- known, the United States Navy symbolically granted her enlistment on 2 November 1982.http://www.bloogger.it/2018/06/italiane-in-armi/ Voluntary female military service was introduced in 1999 with the Italian law Legge 20 ottobre 1999 n. 380, which introduced the possibility of being admitted to the army for women.Informagiovani Italy was the last country among NATO members to allow women to deploy.L'impatto del servizio militare femminile.

During the Second World War both enlisted women and female officers served in all branches of the military. However, in 1947 political changes commanded that women only serve in civilian posts, with reservists allowing women to join in 1959. Between 1977 and 1984, the Norwegian Parliament passed laws expanding the role of women in the Norwegian Armed Forces, and in 1985 equal opportunities legislation was applied to the military. In 1995, Norway became the first country to allow women to serve on its military submarines In a further step in favour of gender equality in the armed services, the Norwegian parliament voted, with a strong majority, the 14th of June 2014, a bill to extend compulsory military service to females from mid-2016. Norway is the first NATO member and first European country to make national service compulsory for both sexes.Girls in the army: Norway passes bill on mandatory military service for women It will apply to all medically fit Norwegian citizens between age 19-44 born from 1997 onwards.

Of all the conscriped soldiers the same year, the female percentage was 23%. chttps://forsvaret.no/fakta_/ForsvaretDocuments/Forsvarets_aarsrapport_2017.pdf On 26 January 2017, major general Tonje Skinnarland became the first-ever appointed woman to be the head of the Royal Norwegian air force. Poland Women have taken part in the battles for independence against occupiers and invaders since at least the time of the Napoleonic Wars. During the occupation by the Nazis, 1939‚Äì1945, several thousand women took part in the resistance movement as members of the Home Army. The Germans were forced to establish special prisoner-of-war camps after the Warsaw Rising in 1944 to accommodate over a thousand women prisoners.Women in Home Army In April 1938 the law requiring compulsory military service for men included provisions for voluntary service of women in auxiliary roles, in the medical services, in the anti-aircraft artillery and in communications. In 1939 a Women's Military Training Organization was established under the command of Maria Wittek. In present Poland a law passed April 6, 2004 requires all women with college nursing or veterinary degrees to register for compulsory service. In addition it allows women to volunteer and serve as professional personnel in all services of the army. As of June 30, 2007 there are 800 women in the army, of which 471 are officers, 308 non-commissioned officers and 21 other ranks, in addition 225 are in military training schools.Women in army - in Polish Russia The first woman known to have enlisted in the Russian Army was Nadezhda Durova who, pretending to be a man, fought with distinction in the Napoleonic Wars. At that time, however, she was very much of a unique exception in an all-male army. During the First World War, heavy defeats led to the loss of millions of Russian Imperial soldiers. To psychologically energize morale Alexander Kerensky (leader of Russia of the Russian Provisional Government) ordered the creation of the Woman‚Äôs Death Battalion in May 1917. After three months of fighting, the size of this all-female unit fell from 2,000 to 250.Women's Death Battalion In November 1917, the Bolsheviks dissolved the unit. Shortly after Russia became part of the Soviet Union (see above for the role of woman in Soviet military) till December 1991. The current tally of woman in the Russian Army is standing at around 115,000 to 160,000, representing 10% of Russia‚Äôs military strength. They're not allowed in combat roles, however. The Russian army runs the Miss Russian Army beauty contest for attractive female Russian soldiers. Colonel Gennady Dzyuba, of the Defense Ministry, said of the 2005 contest that \\"Those who have served, especially in hot spots, know the importance of women in the armed forces.\\" Soviet Union: 1917‚Äì1991 Women had the legal right to serve in the Soviet Armed Forces throughout the post Second World War period, with many all-female units existing as far back as World War One. By the early 1990s, 100,000 women made up 3% of the Soviet Armed Forces. During the Second World War, the Soviet Union had a female military strength of over one million women who served as snipers, machine gunners, and tank crew members. Very few of these women, however, were ever promoted to officers. In 1942 the Soviet Union formed three regiments of women combat pilots to fly night bombing missions over Germany, the 588th Night Bomber Regiment, later called the 46th Taman Guards Night Bomber Aviation Regiment. These women took part in regular harassment bombing against the Germans in Polikarpov Po-2 biplanes, and participated in the final onslaught against Berlin. The regiments, collectively known to the Germans as the \\"Nachthexen\\" (\\"Night Witches\\"), flew more than 24,000 sorties and won in total 23 Hero of the Soviet Union medals. Some of the most talented women pilots were assigned day fighter duties. \\"Lily\\" Litvak and Katya Budanova became fighter aces flying the Soviet Union's best fighter designs alongside men in day attacks. Both were killed in their aircraft. Meanwhile, in the ground combat role Lyudmila Pavlichenko, made 309 confirmed kills including 36 enemy snipers. Pavlichenko was one of the many female snipers of the Soviet Army. In 1967, the Soviet Universal Military Duty Laws concluded that women offered the greater source of available combat soldiers during periods of large-scale mobilisation. Thus, several programs during the height of the cold war were set up to encourage women to enlist. Participation in military orientated youth programs and forced participation in the reserves for ex-servicewomen up to the age of 40 are some examples. Universities contained reservist officer training which accompanied a place in the reserves themselves. In the Soviet Union civil universities, in addition to professional education, gave basic military training to the youth of both sexes. Many secondary schools in post-Soviet countries still have defense lessons, both for boys and girls. Serbia Although the Serbian combat forces were traditionally exclusively male (with exception of nurses and some other non-combat roles) there were some exceptions. Several women are known to have fought in the ranks in the Balkan Wars and the First World War, often by initially hiding their gender to work around the draft regulations. The most notable of them was Milunka Saviƒá. In the Second World War Yugoslav partisan units accepted female volunteers as combatants as well as medical personnel. After the war the practice was abandoned, but was reintroduced recently with professionalisation of the army. In Yugoslavia (including Serbia and other states), two million women were directly involved in non-combat support roles with Yugoslavia's partisans, and 100,000 served in the partisan army during World War II.Barbara Jancar, \\"Women in the Yugoslav National Liberation Movement: An Overview,\\" Studies in Comparative Communism (1981) 14#2 pp 143-164. Sweden In the Military Articles of 1621, which organized the Swedish Army, military men on all levels were explicitly allowed to bring their wives with them to war, as the wives were regarded to fill an important role as sutlers in the house hold organisation of the army: prostitutes, however, were banned. This regulation was kept until the Military Article of 1798, though the presence of women diminished after the end of the Great Northern War. In the Military Article of 1798, the only women allowed to accompany the army was the professional unmarried female sutlers, in Sweden named marketenterska. Unofficially, however, there were females who served in the army posing as male the entire period, the most famous being Ulrika Eleonora St√•lhammar. In 1924, the Swedish Women's Voluntary Defence Organization (\\"Lottorna\\") was founded: it is an auxiliary defense organization of the Home Guard, a part of the Swedish Armed Forces. Since 1989 there are no gender restrictions in the Swedish military on access to military training or positions. They are allowed to serve in all parts of the military and in all positions, including combat. in Swedish, Retrieved 04-23-2007 Turkey Sabiha G√∂k√ßen was the first female pilot to fly during a conflict, 1937 When Turkish history is examined, it is apparent that Turkish women have voluntarily taken tasks in the defence of their country, showing the same power and courage as men. Nene Hatun, whose monument has been erected in the city of Erzurum (Eastern Turkey) because of her gallant bravery during the Ottoman-Russian War, constitutes a very good example of this fact. Furthermore, the Independence War has taken its place in history with the unsurpassed heroism of Turkish women.http://www.nato.int/ims/2001/win/turkey.htm Sabiha G√∂k√ßen was the first female combat pilot in the world, as well as the first Turkish female aviator.

Women civilian personnel have been assigned to the headquarters staff, technical fields, and social services without sexual discrimination. Women officers serve in all branches except armour, infantry, and submarines. Assignments, promotions and training are considered on an equal basis with no gender bias.

Previously they could be in any role that was not ground close combat (CGC). This change was started in 2016, when the ban on women in ground close combat roles was lifted by the then prime minister, David Cameron. The first CGC branch to accept women was the Royal Armoured Corps, in November 2016. The RAF was next to open its doors in September 2017. There are 15,340 female personnel as of the 1st of April 2019, which is roughly 11% of the British armed forces. Plenty of female combatants can be found throughout Britain‚Äôs military historyBBC news article on Women in Combat, retrieved on March 29, 2007, including Queen Elizabeth II, who joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service in 1945 and trained as a driver and mechanic. An early example is Queen Boudica, who led warriors of the Iceni tribe against Roman forces occupying Britain around AD 62, her legacy being often quoted in support of arguments calling for the full opening up of the British Armed forces to women. In the medieval period, Queens and noblewomen such as Ethelfleda of Mercia, Matilda of England, Isabella of France and Margaret of Anjou commanded armies in battle, although they did not fight themselves. Many women including Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine accompanied their husbands on Crusade. In the 16th century Mary, Queen of Scots, accompanied troops in several campaigns. Women continued to lead armies or organise the defense of castles in the absence of their male relatives until the close of the English Civil War. Charles I's consort, Henrietta Maria of France was the last English queen to command troops in battle in northern England in 1643. Auxiliary Territorial Service, 1940 During the 1776 American War of Independence, it is estimated that over 5,000 women accompanied British forces. Many of these would have been the wives of high-ranking officers, with a large proportion being the wives of serving soldiers. While as much as possible women were left in the camp, they sometimes accompanied forces in their baggage trains serving as cooks or nurses, and were occasionally caught in combat and killed or taken prisoner. Similarly women accompanied men in ships of the Royal Navy, in combat being employed as powder monkeys or assisting surgeons. During World War I the British Women‚Äôs Army Auxiliary Corps was formed; Lieutenant-General H Lawson recommended using it in France in 1917. Sir Neville Macready, the Adjutant-General, supported the idea that women and men should be treated the same at the front. Women served in the British Army during World War One as cooks, medical staff and clerical staff, however women were not permitted to be officers, and there were many disputes over pay. In 1917 the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS) was formed, although then disbanded in 1919 It provided catering and administrative support, communications and electrician personnel. Prior to World War II, in 1938 the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) was created, with 20,000 women serving in non-combat roles during the conflict as well as serving as military police. Some women took part in direct combat roles as part of mixed gender teams manning heavy anti-aircraft batteries and gun crews within Britain. Women members of the teams might sight and aim anti-aircraft guns and even give the command to fire, but the actual release of the trigger was always (officially at least) reserved for a male soldier. A number of women operated on active service in wartime Europe with special services, engaged in intelligence, sabotage and laison with local resistance groups. During the war, the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry was incorporated into the ATS. The WRNS was reformed at the outbreak of war in 1939, with an increased range of shore-based opportunities available. In 1949 women were officially recognized as a permanent part of British Armed forces, although full combat roles were still available only to men. In this year, the Women's Royal Army Corps was created to replace the WAAC, and in 1950 the ranks were normalised with the ranks of men serving in the British Army. The 1991 Gulf War marked the first deployment of British women in combat operations since 1945. Women were engaged in a broad range of support operations up to 8 km from the front line. In 1992 British Army units devoted only to women were disbanded, and women were distributed amongst the same units in which men served. During the 1990s an increasing number of roles were opened up to women including direct combat support roles in intelligence, artillery, engineering and signals.Rachel Woodward, Trish Winter, Sexing the soldier: the politics of gender and the contemporary British Army, Routledge, (2007) pp. 33-35 In 1991 seagoing opportunities were opened to WRNS personnel leading to the full integration of the WRNS with the Royal Navy in 1993. To date several female personnel have commanded small ships of the RN and a recently retired Commanding Officer of HM Naval Base, Clyde, Commodore Carolyn Stait, is a former WRNS Officer. The seizure of Royal Navy sailor Faye Turney in 2007 by the naval forces of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard led to some media comment on the role of women and mothers in the armed forces. The commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces is a woman (Queen Elizabeth II) though her position is only nominal.

Molluscs of central Europe. accessed 14 April 2010. is a species of air-breathing land snail, a terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusk in the family Hygromiidae. It is also often known as Trochoidea geyeri.  Taxonomy  Xerocrassa geyeri was originally described under the name Xerophila geyeri by the Hungarian malacologist Lajos So√≥s (1879-1972) in 1926. The specific name geyeri is in honor of the German zoologist David Geyer (1855-1932). The type specimens are stored in the Natural History Museum of Geneva.Gittenberger E. (1993). \\"On Trochoidea geyeri (Soos, 1926) and some conchologically similar taxa (Mollusca: Gastropoda Pulmonata: Hygromiidae)\\". Zoologische Mededelingen 67(19): 303-320. Figures 1-29. PDF.  Shell description  Xerocrassa geyeri is a small land snail. The height of the shell is 3.4-6.0 mm, usually 3.5‚Äì5 mm. The width of the shell is 5.1(5.0)-8.0 mm. The shell is globular in its shape. The shell has 4.5-5 whorls. Sometimes there are radial ribs on the surface of the shell forming its shell sculpture. There are usually no periostracal structures, but there can in some cases be hairs and in these cases, after the hairs are gone pits remain on the shel surface especially on the whorl below the apex. The color of the shell is greyish-white sometimes with one or a few brownish spiral bands. { apical view apertural view. umbilical view }  Anatomy  The reproductive system of Xerocrassa geyeri was described by Gittenberger (1993): there is no appendage in the genital atrium, that is the distinguishing characteristic of the genus Xerocrassa Monterosato, 1892. There are two rudimentary dart-sacs near the mucus glands. The flagellum and the epiphallus have approximately the same length.  Distribution  Xerocrassa geyeri lives in Europe, showing a discontinuous, patchy distribution. Today, the species range is mainly Central Europe: parts of Germany and the south of France. Verified recent localities of Xerocrassa geyeri include: * Gotland, Sweden * Belgium * Germany. It is on the Red List of Germany:Armbruster M. & Pfenninger M. (2003). \\"Simulated bottlenecks and loss of rare alleles: implications on the conservation genetics of two gastropod species\\". Journal for Nature Conservation 11(2): 77-81. . critically endangered * Switzerland: endangered * France * Spain  Fossil distribution  Fossil evidence suggests that current populations of Xerocrassa geyeri are relicts of a much more widespread distribution during more favourable climatic periods in the Pleistocene era. Xerocrassa geyeri fossils are relatively abundant and Xerocrassa geyeri was one of main land snails in the western and southern Europe in glacial periods. In loess deposits, the presence of Xerocrassa geyeri shells has been reported since the early Pleistocene. The subfossilised shell deposits in southern England and large parts of France are correlated with the widespread occurrence of rather arid cold steppe vegetation formations. These formations are associated with transitional phases of Pleistocene climate cycles, covering parts of Europe even during maximal glacial expansion thus providing the potential for local refugia. Both Pleistocene interstadial and pleniglacial periods resulted in altitudinal and latitudinal shiftings of these formations, as well as in reductions in their extent. The fossil record suggests that the population history of Xerocrassa geyeri is linked to palaeoclimate changes. The latitudinal shifts of suitable habitat during Pleistocene across Europe, driven by climate change, were anticipated by Xerocrassa geyeri in the fossil record with remarkably short time lags. In other words, the species can be detected in the fossil record very soon after the onset of a suitable climate phase. Research by Pfenninger et al. (2003) suggested that the origin of the species is in the Provence from where it expanded its range first to Southwest France and subsequently from there to Germany. Xerocrassa geyeri seems to have survived in local refugia the reduction of the favourable steppe-like habitat due to climatic extremes during the pleniglacial and interstadial periods, as it is the case today. Pfenninger & Bahl (1997)Pfenninger M. & Bahl A. (1997). \\"Influence of habitat size on the viability of spatially structured populations of the land snail Trochoidea geyeri\\". Verhandlungen der Gesellschaft f√ºr √ñkologie 27: 469-473. suggested that snail species with restricted dispersal might survive in habitats of a size in the magnitude of few square meters. There is increasing evidence that such small spots with a favourable microclimate existed in the periglacial area of central Europe and were presumed to have provided refuges for comparatively cold resistant snail species. Southern and eastern European refugia were also supplemented by cryptic sanctuaries in northern Europe during the late Pleistocene in shaping present day species composition. Localities with fossil Xerocrassa geyeri are summarized in Magnin (1989)Magnin F. (1989). \\"Les distributions pl√©istoc√®ne et actuelle de Trochoidea (Xeroclausa) geyeri (So√≥s 1926) dans le Sud de la France: un exemple de disjonctions d'aire li√©e au r√©chauffement post- glaciere\\".

It had to move to mountains where it survives today.  Ecology  Xerocrassa geyeri is xerophilous species and it is found today in open calcareous or loessic grass and scrublands with a sparse vegetation cover on mountaintops, karstic highland plateaus and disturbed pastures, which are thought to constitute ecological refuges. In southeastern France it inhabits localities from 900 to 1000 m above sea level,Magnin F. (1993). \\"Trochoidea geyeri (So√≥s, 1926) (Pulmonata, Helicidae) in south-eastern France; ecology, biogeography and Quaternary history\\". Scripta Geol. (Spec. issue 2): 291-295. PDF but as anomaly it was found also in 370 m above sea level in Mont Vertoux. Xerocrassa geyeri is hermaphroditic species and fertilisation is obligately outcrossing. The main reproduction period is from March to June and from September to October (according to the table values). It lays usually less than 10 uncalcified egss, but sometimes more (according to the table values). Juveniles are hatching from eggs in less than two weeks (according to the table values). They reach sexual maturity in one year and longevity of this species is 1‚Äì2 years. Xerocrassa geyeri feeds on dead plants, but rarely also on living plants, epilithic lichens and on algae. Its active dispersal capacity is about 3 m during its one-year lifetime. Its competitor may be Candidula unifasciata.

Description Examples of this form of fiction are now rare, surviving only in a few collections. One of the collections where a number of gothic bluebooks have been preserved is the Corvey Library. Gothic bluebooks were descendants of the chapbook, trade in which had nearly disappeared by 1800. Print. They measured about three and a half to four inches wide and six to seven inches high. Many of the bluebooks contained outright plagiarism, being as they were merely plot summaries of full-length gothic novels. Print. Almost all were abridgements of full-length gothic novels, usually without change of the title or characters' names from the original. Print. Gothic bluebooks were usually either thirty-six or seventy-two pages long, selling for either sixpence or a shilling respectively. It is from their price that they derived the nicknames, \\"Shilling Shockers\\" and \\"Sixpenny Shockers\\". While full-length gothic novels written by authors like Horace Walpole, Matthew Lewis, and Ann Radcliffe were expensive, these \\"Sixpenny Shockers\\" were affordable versions of the same stories. Print. These short forms of the Gothic were not popular with critics, with some deeming them as the toxic literary waste of their time period. Like the gothic novel, gothic bluebooks fell into two general groups. One featured a background with a monastery or convent, following novels like The Monk or The Italian, and the other group featured the gothic castle, following novels such as The Castle of Otranto and The Mysteries of Udolpho. One of the reasons for the appeal of these abridgements was their ability to tell the same story as a three to four volume novel in 36 or 72 pages, successfully bringing the characters to the altar or to the grave. The fiction was highly predictable, and readers could hardly miss the point of the story because the narration was straightforward. Given their reasonable prices, they were said to have been sold by 'every other bookseller in the United Kingdom' and therefore, readily available. Gothic bluebooks lured the consumer with engravings and woodcuts on their title pages and frontispieces; these illustrations were often fearsome, with a prototypical image being that of a maiden in flight down a dark path glancing over her shoulder. It was common for these books to have two titles, with the first highlighting the love interest and the second emphasizing the horrid element. An example is the title, \\"A Gothic Romance: The Cavern of Horrors\\". Important publishers of gothic bluebooks, who often referred to the works as \\"pamphlets\\", included Thomas Tegg, Dean and Munday, Robert Harrild, and John Aliss, who each had distribution networks throughout Britain. If a bluebook story was not long enough to fill the allotted page length, publishers had versions of shorter stories on hand that they would attach to the end. One story that was commonly attached was \\"Mary, A Fragment\\",Print. which was just one page long. Gothic bluebooks remained a popular trade through the first decade of the 19th century. Popularity among writers From autobiographies, it appears that gothic bluebooks were read by writers like Percy Shelley, Robert Southey, and Sheridan Le Fanu in their youth.

Career=With Rory Gallagher De'Ath was playing with the band Killing Floor when, at short notice, he was offered the job as a temporary substitute for Rory Gallagher's drummer Wilgar Campbell for a leg of a European tour in 1972. When Campbell left permanently, de'Ath was asked to join full-time. He stayed with Gallagher, performing on several albums, until 1978 when he and keyboard player Lou Martin left the band. Gallagher's bass guitarist Gerry McAvoy stated that de'Ath \\"was the most undrummer-like drummer I ever played with. His technique was so strange that it added a whole new dimension to Rory's sound.\\" Later career and accident After leaving Gallagher's band, de'Ath joined Ramrod (with Martin) and then he played with the Downliners Sect before moving to the United States. In 1981, he played on Screaming Lord Sutch's new recordings of All Black and Hairy and Jack the Ripper. In the mid-1980s, he returned to the UK to produce an album for a band called Road Erect. Around this time, he suffered a serious accident while running to catch a train, which led to the loss of one eye and some brain damage. Deciding to return to the UK permanently, he eventually made a near-complete recovery, although he was no longer able to play. He had also been told by doctors that his brain damage would kill him within four years, and although this prognosis proved incorrect, he did not want to contact friends only to tell them that he was terminally ill. Later life When Gallagher died in 1995, many obituaries claimed that de'Ath was also dead, and for this reason he stayed away from Gallagher's funeral. McAvoy had heard that de'Ath had been killed in an accident in 1987. However, he appeared at a memorial service a few months later, having \\"waited for a suitable moment\\" to show that he was still alive. McAvoy remembered that de'Ath looked very frail and walked with the aid of a stick. Little or nothing was known of de'Ath's whereabouts after 1996, until an interview with him was published in Classic Rock magazine in May 2012, within a feature about Rory Gallagher. A few months later in August, de'Ath attended the funeral of former Rory Gallagher and Ramrod band member Lou Martin. Death De'Ath died on 1 August 2014, aged 64, after a long illness.

Minicomputer The K 1820 was a clone of the MicroVAX II made by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). The import of western 32-bit computers to the COMECON area was impeded by the CoCom technology embargo.

Subsequent to this Robotron's traditional markets in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe collapsed. At least one prototype of the K 1820 is owned by the Technische Sammlungen Museum.

It grew out of the earlier BCS-FTAM protocol that was developed in 1995, with the aim of being able to use internet connections and TCP/IP. It is mandated for use by German banks and has also been adopted by France and Switzerland. EBICS is used in the Single Euro Payments Area: the standard can be used as the secure communication channel to initiate SEPA Direct Debits and SEPA Credit Transfers using the Internet. SEPA concentrates on standardisation of clearing protocols in the inter-bank networks. The SEPA-Clearing guidelines do not supplant any national clearing transmission protocols. Theoretically the national banking transmission standards could be prolonged for decades. History In 2005, the German Zentraler Kreditausschuss (ZKA / Central Credit Committee) initiated a project to replace the national banking clearing system based on FTAM (short BCS-FTAM). The design goals were specifically set to create a transmission protocol that can be used by other countries as well. On 1 January 2006, the new EBICS transmission protocol was included in the German DF√ú-Abkommen (EDI-Agreement - enacted first on 15 March 1995). Since 1 January 2008, all German banks must support the EBICS transmission protocol and support for BCS-FTAM ended on 31 December 2010. On 14 November 2008, a cooperation with the French \\"Comit√© Fran√ßais d‚ÄôOrganisation et de Normalisation Bancaire\\" (CFONB - standardisation office in the banking sector of France) was pronounced such that EBICS would be adopted for usage in France. On 5 May 2009, a joint committee was created to resolve a modified EBICS. On 12 February 2010, a common EBICS for Germany and France was published. Most changes on the common EBICS involved to embed the French ETEBAC-3 message types and ETEBAC-5 signature elements into the EBICS transmission format. Previously ETEBAC was transported via X.25 packet network lines (in Germany the BCS-FTAM protocol used ISDN direct lines). French Telecom closed its X.25 network in November 2011. The EBICS protocol is based on an IP network. It allows use of standard HTTP with TLS encryption (HTTPS) for transport of data elements. The routing data elements are encoded in XML and optionally signed and encrypted with X.509 PKI certificates (replacing older RSA keys). The EBICS transmission protocol can be used to wrap SEPA-XML statements as they come forward. The standard does include two major areas - for usage in the bank-client transmission including statements of account (MT940/STA) and for interbanking clearing. The German Bundesbank has adopted the EBICS transmission protocol on 28 January 2009 to accept clearing information to be routed to the SWIFTnet interbanking network. The Bundesbank will only accept SEPA statements via SWIFTnet FileAct or EBICS submissions. \\"SCT Verfahrensregeln\\" / \\"Procedural Rules for credit transfers\\", section 3.1, quote \\"Deliveries from the SEPA Clearer are made only by data telecommunication via EBICS or SWIFTNet FileAct. This is governed by the specifications on communication set out in the Procedural Rules for Communication via SWIFTNet FileAct for the Deutsche Bundesbank‚Äôs Retail Payment System (RPS) SEPA Clearer (SCL) and the Procedural Rules for Communication with Credit Institutions/payment institutions with a bank sort code via EBICS.

Biography  Jean Malaurie was born in Mainz, occupied by French forces, into a French Catholic family of history scholars of Norman and Scottish descent. In 1943, while studying at the Lyc√©e Henri-IV in Paris, he was drafted into the Service du travail obligatoire (STO - Compulsory Work Service for the Germans). Refusing to join, he went into hiding until August 1944. He did his postgraduate studies in the Institut de G√©ographie de l‚ÄôUniversit√© de Paris, under Professor Emmanuel de Martonne who, some 15 years earlier, had also taught to Julien Gracq. In 1948, Emmanuel de Martonne granted Malaurie the title of geographer/physicist of the French Polar Expeditions led by Paul Emile Victor along the West coast of Greenland and on its ice cap. He accomplished two missions in the Skansen Mountain, in the south of Disko Island, with the French Polar Expeditions (spring/autumn 1948 and 1949). After two geomorphological and geocryological missions for the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique ‚Äì CNRS (\\"French National Centre for Scientific Research\\"), he spent two winters alone in the Hoggar desert in 1949 and 1950 (Algeria, Sahara). Then, in July 1950, he left on a mission to Thule, Greenland, where he led the \\"first French geographical and ethnological mission to the North of Greenland\\" for the CNRS. There, he established the first genealogy, covering four generations, of a group of 302 Inughuit, the northernmost people on earth. He also implemented a planning of trends in order to avoid the risks of consanguinity (banning marriage up to the 5th degree). As a geomorphologist in the Great North of Greenland, he raised the map of the coast to 1:100 000 (topography, geomorphology of screes and nivation, sea ice). The map covers a 300 kilometre long and 3 kilometre wide region from Inglefield Land and the north of the Humboldt Glacier, to the south of Washington Land (Cape Jackson, 80¬∞ N). He discovered various fjords and unknown littorals, which he was authorized to name himself after French names, like the Paris Fjord, or after his Inuit travel companions such as the famous shaman, Uutaaq. He conducted a detailed geomorphological study of the screes and high latitude geocryological ecosystems, of which he described the cyclic and strata organization. He later made this the subject of his thesis: Th√®mes de recherche g√©omorphologique dans le nord-ouest du GroenlandParis : CNRS, 1968. (Geomorphological research in Northwest Greenland). On April 9, 1962, he was named Docteur d‚Äô√âtat de g√©ographie of the Institut de g√©ographie de la Facult√© des lettres de l'universit√© de Paris. He was the first man ever to reach the geomagnetic North Pole (78¬∞29‚Ä≤N 68¬∞54‚Ä≤W) on May 29, 1951, with two dog sleds, together with the Inuit man Kutsikitsoq. On June 16, 1951 he discovered the American military base of Thule (Thule Air Base), built in secret to host nuclear bombers, and he decided to publicly stand up against the establishment of this base, for which the local population wasn't consulted. His book Les Derniers rois de Thul√© (The Last Kings of Thule) was published in 1955 as the founding book of the Terre Humaine series (Ed. Plon, Paris). It was soon followed by other classics such as Tristes Tropiques by Claude L√©vi-Strauss, Les Imm√©moriaux by Victor Segalen, Affables Sauvages by Francis Huxley, Soleil Hopi by Don C. Talayesva, Pour l‚ÄôAfrique, j‚Äôaccuse by Ren√© Dumont and Carnets d‚Äôenqu√™tes by √âmile Zola. The Terre Humaine series intends to move the focus away from our Western way of looking at things. In 1957, he was recommended by Fernand Braudel and Claude L√©vi-Strauss, and elected to the Chair of Polar Geography, the first ever in the history of the French University, created for this occasion within the √âcole des hautes √©tudes en sciences sociales ‚Äì EHESS (School for Advanced Studies in Social Sciences). He then founded in 1958, the Centre d'√©tudes arctiques (Center for Arctic Studies) and launched in 1960 the great CNRS journal on the Arctic: Inter-Nord. In 1968‚Äì1969, he led the French section of the Governmental Commission of France and Quebec during the creation of the autonomous territory of New Quebec, now called Nunavik. His recommendations, published in the book Du Nouveau-Qu√©bec au Nunavik, 1964-2004, une fragile autonomieLead by par Jacques Rousseau and Jean Malaurie, Collection Polaires, Economica, Paris, 2004. (From New Quebec to Nunavik, 1964‚Äì2004, a Fragile Autonomy) and in the special section ¬´ Nunavik/Ungava ¬ª of the Inter-Nord publication n¬∞20,June 2003, Paris, CNRS Editions. aimed to establish the immediate autonomy of this territory and a deep pedagogical reform of the education system. They contributed to elaborating the status of the current Canadian Arctic Territories, mainly inspired by Charlie Watt, an Inuit Federal Senator. Jean Malaurie led the first Franco-Soviet expedition in Siberian Chukotka in 1990, at the request of the Soviet government and of the Academician Dmitry Likhachov, Scientific Counsellor to Mikhail Gorbachev. He was also the first Westerner to discover the Whale Alley in 1990 in Northeast Siberia; a monument that had remained ignored until it was first identified by the Soviet archaeologist Sergue√Ø Arutiunov in 1977. In 1992, Jean Malaurie founded the State Polar Academy in Saint-Petersburg, of which he was named Honorary President for life. In this school of Siberian executives, that hosts around a thousand boarder students, representing forty-five ethnic groups, in five faculties, French is taught as the first foreign language in a compulsory course. In the course of his 31 missions, from Greenland to Siberia, he taught a method ‚Äî called \\"anthropogeography, from stone to man\\" ‚Äî reminding how the history, rituals and sociology of the Arctic peoples can only be understood in the frame of a given physical environment. These observations are linked to cybernetics with the Gaia principle, based on the conclusions of James Lovelock, shared by Jean Malaurie: the Earth would be \\"a dynamic physiological system that includes the biosphere and has kept our planet fit for life for over three billion yearsJames Lovelock, La revanche de Ga√Øa, J'ai Lu, coll. ¬´ J'ai Lu Essai, n¬∞ 8579 ¬ª, 2008, (2d ed.) p. 30.\\". Jean Malaurie is an ardent defender of the rights of Arctic minorities, currently threatened by the development of industries and oil activities in the Great North. He has been an advisor to the four capital cities: Washington, Ottawa, Copenhagen and Moscow. In 2007, he was named UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador for Arctic polar issues (Fields of Sciences and Culture), and was invited to chair the first UNESCO International Experts Meeting on the Arctic: Climate change and Arctic sustainable development: scientific, social, cultural and educational challenges, which took place in Monaco from the 3rd to the 6th of March 2009. He is currently preparing, in collaboration with UNESCO, the upcoming International Congress on Circumpolar Peoples, to be held in 2011 in Greenland. In 2007, he was appointed Honorary President of the Uummannaq Polar Institute, an institution that aims to preserve local Greenlandic culture and promote educational programmes for Inuit youth. In 2010, he founded the P√¥le Inuit ‚Äì Institut Jean Malaurie in Uummannaq (Greenland). As a writer, he is the author of, among other publications, The Last Kings of Thule (\\"Les derniers rois de Thul√©\\", Paris, 1955; first published in English in 1982), translated into 23 languages and now the most widely distributed book about the Inuit people. This book has been adapted into a movie and the cartoon version is in progress. Overall, Jean Malaurie published ten books and over five hundred scientific papers, which have just been assembled, together with previously unpublished ones, into a six volumes edition to be published by the CNRS √âditions. A leading light of French polar research, in the lineage of Commander Jean-Baptiste Charcot, captain of the Pourquoi-Pas ?, he is now living in Dieppe, Normandy, and getting ready to finish his life in Uummannaq, northwest coast of Greenland, where a Jean Malaurie Museum has been created that features a reconstitution of his former wintering base in a peat house. He was awarded the French title of \\"Commandeur de la L√©gion d'honneur\\" and the Great Gold Medal of Saint-Petersburg, and received the Gold Medal of the Royal Geographical Society of London from the Queen herself. He was also granted the Medal of the Bear, a high distinction of the Greenlandic government, as well as many other foreign distinctions such as the Mungo Park Medal, awarded to him in 2005 by The Royal Scottish Geographic Society.

He is credited with making the first derailleur with a collapsible parallelogram. A hinged frame swung in and out from the frame and fed the chain to one of a number of sprockets attached to the hub. Juy's derailleurs, sold as Simplex derailleurs, were novel in having a jockey wheel to correct the tension of the chain as it moved across differently sized sprockets. History Lucien Juy owned a bicycle shop in Dijon, C√¥te d'Or, France. It was there that he made the first Simplex derailleur in 1928.Stone, Hilary, Simplex plunger/push-rod derailleurs http://www.classiclightweights.co.uk/designs/simplex-hs.html Cyclotourisme Tandem Noir, http://pagesperso-orange.fr/tandem.noir/pages/tandem-d.htm The bicycle historian Hilary Stone said: \\"It used a single pulley to tension the chain and a pair of guide plates to push the chain to each one of two sprockets. The whole arm was spring-loaded in order to tension the chain ‚Äì this was the first use of the sprung top pivot which was to become an essential part of the modern indexed derailleur as we know it today. The pulley and guide plates were moved sideways on a push-rod by means of a chain pulling through the centre of the push-rod. Lucien Juy managed to persuade the management of the Alcyon racing team to fit his Le Simplex gear to their machines for the 1928 Paris‚ÄìRoubaix ‚Äì unfortunately the riders revolted and refused to use the new unproven gears.\\"Stone, Hilary, Simplex plunger/push-rod derailleurs, http://www.classiclightweights.co.uk/designs/simplex-hs.html By 1933 Juy claimed he was making 40,000 derailleurs a year. The derailleur was used to win four French national championships that year.Stone, Hilary, Simplex plunger/push-rod derailleurs Simplex plunger/push-rod derailleurs, http://www.classiclightweights.co.uk/designs/simplex-hs.html His five-speed Champion du Monde model in 1936 was the first to use a chain of 3/32 rather than 1/8-inch. Antonin Magne, after whose title it was named, used the gear to win the world championship in 1936.V√©loparis: Les meilleures d√©railleurs des ann√©es 50, In 1962 Juy broke with tradition and made his front and rear derailleurs with nylon frames.L.C.H. Juy, \\"Change Speed Gear Control Devices for Bicycles and Similar Chain Driven Vehicles,\\" US Patent 3,181,383, 4-May-1965. A historian of bicycle derailleurs, Michael Sweatman, says: \\"He did not do things by halves - instead of dipping in a toe and using the odd plastic part - he jumped in up to his neck and made the entire parallelogram - both knuckles and both parallelogram plates - out of polyoxymethylene (which Du Pont branded as 'Delrin'). It was a bold, dynamic, modern and, ultimately, disastrous move.\\"Sweatman, Michael: Simplex Prestige 532,http://www.disraeligears.co.uk/Site/Simplex_Prestige_derailleur_(532).html Production of all Simplex gears ended in the 1990s.

After Nikolassee and the neighbouring Schlachtensee, it is the southernmost of the Grunewald chain of lakes. Overview To the north east, the Riemeistersee flows into the Riemeisterfenn nature reserve, the Langes Luch nature reserve, the Grunewaldsee and ultimately the Hundekehlesee. Krumme Lanke is 1,100m long with a circumference of 2.5 km, is up to 6.6m deep and has a surface area of 154,000m¬≤. A path running along the edge of the lake is popular with joggers and walkers. There are also two bathing spots on the lake, one of which is used for naturism. There is also an exercise area for dogs on the northern bank, although this is currently overgrown. Unlike other lakes in the area, which contain eels, tench, pike, carp, catfish and perch, the Krumme Lanke is home only to asp. On the northern bank is a memorial to Sergeant Fritz G√∂hrs, who was killed there in 1928. Whilst riding around the lake, G√∂hrs' horse was startled and threw him into the lake. The horse then fell on top of him and G√∂hrs drowned. Around a kilometre from the lake is the Krumme Lanke station of the Berlin U-Bahn, on the U3. History=Crumense Having already bought the then villages of Zehlendorf, Schlachtensee and Nikolassee in 1242, the monks of the influential Cistercian Lehnin Abbey sought nine years later to expand their estate further north into Teltow. In 1251, they bought the village of Crumense by the Krumme Lanke for one hundred and fifty marks from the Ascanian Margraves Johann I and Otto III, who ruled the area together. As the village is not recorded in the Land Book of Charles IV of 1375, it is very likely that the village was abandoned soon after the purchase. As excavations in the abandoned site have uncovered remnants of Slavic pottery, it is thought the settlement was originally a Slavonic foundation. Crumense in Middle Low German indicates a site by a crooked lake, meaning the village was named after the lake. There are references to the lake itself in documents from 1543 and 1591, in which it is referred to as the Krummensee. SS colony Between 1938 and 1940, the GAGFAH property company built an SS colony by the Krumme Lanke. The firm worked in co-operation with the Office for Race and Settlement to create what Reichsf√ºhrer of the SS Heinrich Himmler called \\"a closed community for the officers of the SS.\\" Since 1945, almost all of the streets have been renamed: Sigstra√üe was renamed B√ºrstadter Weg (after the town in southern Hesse); Treuepfad became Alsbacher Weg (the name of several places in Germany); and Ahnenzeile became Jugenheimer Weg (after Jugenheim in Rheinhessen). The name of one street, Im Kinderland (In the land of children) remained. The name was suggested by the wife of an SS officer, on the grounds that \\"the men, who represent the racial elite of the German people, pass on their high-quality genetic material to a large number of genetically wealthy offspring.\\" Music *In 1923, Berliner folk singer Fredy Sieg wrote Das Lied von der Krummen Lanke (The Song of Krumme Lanke).Das Lied von der Krummen Lanke *In 1973, the quartet, Insterburg & Co., sang about the Krumme Lanke in song of that title on their album, Die Hohe Schule der Musik (The High School for Music).Insterburg & Co. - Krumme Lanke *Indie artist Ducktails included an instrumental on his album St. Catherine by the name Krumme Lanke.

Description and biology Pebbled butterflyfish reach maximum lengths of . The body is spotted and white, though it may bear shades of green and yellow. There are five light brown bands crossing the side of the body. On the ventral side, a dark line extends from the anal fins, gradually lightening to yellow as it moves towards the pelvic fins. Though often mistaken for the crochet butterflyfish (Chaetodon guentheri) or speckled butterflyfish (Chaetodon citrinellus), the pebbled butterflyfish can be distinguished by its vertical bands. On the dorsal and anal fins, there is a black line running lengthwise, approximately one-third the total height of the fin from the outer margin. The pelvic fins are white, and the pectorals are transparent. The caudal fin bears a black crescent at its middle and a dark ring at its base. They form pairs, especially for breeding, and lay eggs. Pebbled butterflyfish are monogamous and are aggressively territorial. They will mate to defend a feeding territory. The diet of the pebbled butterflyfish is fairly specialist, and is composed of coral polyps, polychaete worms, and small shrimps.

Geography and climate The town is located along the upper part of the River Ter, in the valley of the same name, and enclosed by the Serra Cavallera to the north and the mountain of Sant Antoni to the south. It has an inland, continental climate, with abundant precipitation and notable temperature variability. Economy Most of the economy of Sant Joan de les Abadesses is centered on industry and manufacturing. However, there have more recently been increases in tourism to the town, with a corresponding increase in the service industry. Rural areas of the municipality are largely occupied by farms, usually raising cows. History=Ancient times Human settlement in the valley around Sant Joan de les Abadesses dates to prehistoric times, and archeological research has found evidence of settlements in the region from the Lower Paleolithic era. It seems that the area was not very much Romanized, despite the fact that a branch of the Via Augusta went up the valley to the Coll d'Ares. Middle Ages The origins of the present town lie in the founding of the Monastery of Sant Joan de les Abadesses by Wilfred the Hairy in 887. This was one of the first nunneries founded in Catalonia, and its first abbess was Emma of Barcelona, daughter of Wilfred. The Benedictine community grew in wealth and importance throughout the 10th century. However, in 1017, the nuns, accused of violating the rules by which they were supposed to be living, were expelled in a bull by Pope Benedict VIII. This expulsion initiated a period of instability that lasted until the re-establishment of canons of the order of Saint Augustine in the 12th century and with the patronage of Ramon Berenguer III. The new Augustinian monks largely rebuilt the monastery, including new churches for the monastery itself and the parish of Saint Pol. New cultural importance and splendor was brought to the monastery in this period, as evidenced by its extensive archive of troubadour songs from this era. Around the monastery, the town of Sant Joan was founded. Initially, the laypeople lived around the Church of Sant Pol, in the neighborhood today known as El Raval. But the town's growing population necessitated the construction of a walled town (the Vila Vella) on land that had been known as El Vinyal. This part of the town was home to numerous medieval guilds. As time passed, power in the town shifted from religious to secular. The town became a Carlist capital, and suffered the consequences of wars with nearby France, as well as industrialization and social change. Contemporary era In the mid-19th century, coal mining was begun in Ogassa, precipitating the construction of a railroad from Sant Joan to Barcelona. The railroad was finished on October 17, 1880. This accelerated the town's growth and industrialization. Like other towns along the Ter River, numerous factories and industrial colonies were built to take advantage of hydrological power from the river. A native citizen of the town introduced concrete to the Iberian Peninsula, and the town itself pioneered concrete manufacturing. During the Spanish Civil War of the 1930s, the town renamed itself Puig-Alt de Ter (High-Hill of the Ter). And as Republican forces retreated in defeat, many passed through the town on their way to the French border. However, Republican soldiers destroyed bridges and the train station as they passed, to cover their retreat. After the war, the town recovered and diversified its industries.

His father, Carl Christian Jensen, was a civil servant and the family were keen amateur musicians. Borgstr√∏m showed an early aptitude for music and by the age of fifteen was a talented violinist. After studying composition and music theory in Oslo with Johan Svendsen and Ludvig Mathias Lindeman, he went to the Leipzig Conservatory in Germany for two years. On his return to Norway in 1889, he worked as a music critic for several newspapers and successfully premiered his cantata, Hv√¶m er du med de tusene navne (Who are you with a thousand names). However, in 1890, he left Norway and was to live for the next thirteen years in Leipzig and Berlin, where he became a friend of the Italian composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni whose musical philosophy he shared.Guldbrandsen, Simax Classics Borgstr√∏m returned to Norway in 1903, the year in which his symphonic poem for piano and orchestra, Hamlet, premiered to great acclaim in Oslo. The soloist at the premiere was the pianist Amalie M√ºller. Borgstr√∏m and M√ºller married the following year and she was to become a champion of his works. The period between 1903 and Amalie's death in 1913 marked Borgstr√∏m's most intense period of composition. Although, he is primarily known for his symphonic works, written in a late Romantic style with influences of Expressionism, he also composed 45 songs, most notably \\"Svalerne\\" (The Swallows), \\"R√∏d valmue\\" (Red Poppy), and \\"Frossen skog\\" (Frozen Forest), as well as two operas, neither of which was performed in his lifetime.Benestad He also became a highly regarded music critic, writing for Verdens Gang from 1903 to 1913 and Aftenposten from 1913 to 1925. Borgstr√∏m died in Oslo in on 5 July 1925 at the age of 61. His works were regularly performed until World War II, and were then largely ignored. However, the 21st century saw a resurgence of interest in him.

Most were built in England in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The threshing barn held a small threshing machine which was connected to the gin gang via wooden gears, drive shafts and drive belt, and was powered by a horse which walked round and round inside the gin gang. Operation and structure The gin (short for \\"engine\\") was the motive power driving a small threshing machine, and the horse did the gang, or going. The gin gang was always attached to the main threshing barn, where the gin was situated. It was almost always of one storey and it could be circular, polygonal or square. There was a hole for a drive‚àíshaft or drive‚àíbelt, linking it with the threshing barn. The gin was connected by cogs to a vertical spindle. The spindle was connected to a horizontal arrangement including a shaft attached to a horse, which turned the spindle and powered the machine by ganging or walking round and round the cogs and vertical spindle inside the walls of the gin gang. This arrangement was necessary in locations where there was no power for a water wheel, hence in Wales and Ireland there is evidence of fewer gin gangs. Gin gang at Hepple, Northumberland Gin gangs were not usually thatched but were stone‚àíflagged, tiled or pantiled, possibly because the gin damaged potential thatching straw. Its structure tended to reflect locally available materials and hence local vernacular building style, because railways had not generally distributed brick and slate. Building materials include thatch in Sussex, pantiles in North Yorkshire, stone tiles and sandstone in Northumberland, granite pillars in Devon, wooden poles and flint in Norfolk, weatherboarding in Berkshire, brick in the East Riding of Yorkshire, white Magnesian Limestone in West Yorkshire, ironstone in Bedfordshire, and one instance of hexagonal ashlar pillars salvaged from Finchale Priory in Finchale, County Durham. Gin gangs were required to shelter the wooden gears, and not to protect the horse; hence in some places there is evidence of horse‚àíwalks or open‚àíair horse‚àípowered threshing machines instead. The horse in the gin gang could also power machinery outdoors. History and distribution Gin gang at Stapleton, Richmondshire Local names for covered gin gangs were covered gin‚àíhouse, covered horse‚àíwalk, enginehouse, gin‚àícase, gin‚àígan, gin‚àígang, gin‚àíhouse, gin‚àírace, horse‚àígear, horse mill/horse-mill, round‚àíhouse, track‚àíshed, four‚àíwheelhouse, wheel‚àírig, wheel‚àíshade and wheel‚àíshed. These are not to be confused with the uncovered ones which were called gin‚àícircle, ginnyring, horse‚àícourse, horse‚àígang, horse‚àípath, horse‚àítrack and horse‚àíwalk. In Scotland, Wales, and Warwickshire a gin gang was commonly called a horse engine house. In 1976, 1,300 gin gangs were identified in Great Britain, and a few others in Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands, and East Germany. Most gin gangs were built from around 1785 to 1851, peaking in 1800 to 1830. The most recent ones were built in the Isle of Wight and Cornwall from 1845 to 1868. In the 19th century there were 575 gin gangs in Northumberland and 227 in West Cumberland, but between the 1890s and the 1960s, hundreds of these were destroyed. In the 1970s, 276 survived in Northumberland and 200 in County Durham. In the same decade a survey found most remaining gin gangs were in the north‚àíeast and south‚àíwest of England, and it was suggested that this distribution could have been affected by the 1830 Swing Riots which destroyed most threshing machines in the south‚àíeast of England. As a result of this, in the 1970s Scotland still had 150 gin gangs, North East England had 800 and Cornwall had 100 remaining, but Wiltshire and Berkshire had 8 between them. Conversely, the Napoleonic Wars of 1803 to 1815 created a dearth of labour and a corresponding demand for gin gangs in Cornwall, Devon, and Dorset. The truly portable horse engine was invented around 1840; this obviated the necessity for building further gin gangs. Existing gin gangs No gin gang remains in operation commercially; the known examples outside museums are either derelict or have been renovated as barn conversions. These are Hutton AHR, Keys farm buildings, Scran horse engine house, Scran Friars Croft Dunbr, Carsegour gingang, Westruther gingang, RCAHM Skildinny, horse engine house Perth and Kinross, Sanday, Muggleswick gin gang, Holbeck farmhouse, Colton farmhouse, Ystum Colwyn farm Meifod, Beamish, and Brewers House Museum. Remnant or derelict Semi-octagonal gin gang with horse mill inside, at Beamish Museum The surviving Low Walworth gin gang was built around the late 18th century. In Northumberland examples exist in Harlow Hill, Hepple, Redesmouth and Stanton. In North Yorkshire two remain at Burn Bridge and Stapleton (see Commons link below). Scottish examples survive at St Quivox, South Ayrshire, at Dunbar, East Lothian, and at Carsegour, Kinross, but the one at Westruther, Westertown in Berwickshire appears to have been destroyed since 1974. The site of a former gin gang exists at Kildinny steading at Forteviot in Strathearn, Scotland. However quite a few do survive in Perth and Kinross, and there is one at Tresness Farm on Sanday in Orkney. There is a listed gin gang at The Grange farmhouse at Muggleswick in County Durham, and there used to be one in 1979 at Holbeck farmhouse in Barrow-in- Furness. There is an example at Nettlecombe in Somerset. There is an extant gin gang at Ystum Colwyn Farm, Meifod, in Wales. The Beamish Museum in County Durham contains a restored gin gang. Another has been preserved at Weald and Downland Open Air Museum but is now labelled as a horse whim for raising water, as is the one at Brewers' House Museum in Antwerp. Barn conversions In Chopwell in Tyne and Wear a gin gang is part of a barn conversion.Image of Chopwell gin gang barn conversion Another one was renovated to become holiday cottages in the face of local controversy at Lanchester, County Durham. A barn conversion development, from a group of farm buildings known as a steading including an octagonal gin gang, was completed in 2010 at Longhorsley, Northumberland. Another example survives as a barn conversion at Southstoke, Somerset. Another recent renovation completed in January 2013 is The Wheelhouse in Barton North Yorkshire, now a holiday let. Gin gang at Beamish Museum=Building Home Farm at the Beamish Museum, County Durham, contains an early 19th-century, semi-octagonal gin gang with sandstone or millstone grit walls and slate roof. The renovated internal roof structure is based on a traditional space frame truss with its primary plane in line with the tie beam (or joist), and with members fixed between king post and rafters to support the semi-octagonal plan of the roof. There is one main transverse oak tie beam on which the king post of the main truss is based. The king post is in tension to prevent sagging of the horizontal tie beam, so neither the king post nor the tie beam are resting on the mill below. The roof construction is not structurally dependent on the horse mill, or connected with it.See images in Commons categoryGin gang and Commons categoryHorse mill, or for further information contact the agricultural department of Beamish Museum . There is no printed or online citation for this building.

The gin gang survived because its original mill was removed and it was converted for other uses. The present mill was brought by the museum from Berwick Mills Low Farm in Northumberland. The museum has repaired and installed it as a museum exhibit, but it is not currently fit for purpose. The top of the mill's main vertical axle and the end of the main drive shaft are pivoted at the centre of their own separate tie beam, which is below and parallel with the main roof tie beam and set in the gin gang's side walls at either end. The mill's tie beam has to be stabilised with two massive oak beams which run, either side of the drive shaft, from tie beam to barn wall. A large and basic engine like this can create great stresses from the torque engendered.

His beliefs centered on people being honest about their negative feelings. He was locally famous in Berkeley, California, where he lived since 1973. In the late 1970s he was a regular presence in upper Sproul Plaza on the University of California, Berkeley campus, and often gave speeches in Leopold's fountain. In addition to being known as \\"Hate Man\\", he was also called \\"Berkeley Baby\\".  Career  Hawthorne was born in Maryland, raised in Stamford, Connecticut and graduated from Stamford High School in 1954 and from the University of Connecticut in 1958 with a Bachelor of Arts in English. While at UCONN he was Managing Editor of The Daily Campus, the University newspaper. Hawthorne was also a member of ROTC and received his commission in the United States Air Force upon graduation, subsequently serving at a Strategic Air Command base in Morocco. He also served as a Peace Corps volunteer. He started at The New York Times as a copy boy and worked as a reporter in the Metro section from 1961 to 1970 before he quit his job, divorced his wife, and \\"started being downward mobile\\".  Philosophy  Hawthorne created a philosophy he called oppositionality, which is centered on treating people kindly even though one is in a bad mood. The reason he greeted people with, \\"I hate you,\\" he explained, is because saying \\"I love you\\" is too often used as a form of manipulation. He created his own following. The group has a practice, initiated by Hawthorne, of pushing one another for what they want. Hawthorne indicated that this is about feeling out the other person's energy and communicating something to the other person about \\"where they are coming from\\". The idea is to avoid negative conflict by bringing such differences out in the open, rather than creating situations where people rob or con one another for what they want. For a couple of years, he initiated a nightly \\"hate camp\\" drum circle at Sproul Plaza, where local people released their animosity. \\"Hate camp\\" was known as the camp that formed around him. Camping there made you a \\"hate camper\\", with a \\"true hate camper\\" being someone who believed in the camp and took an active role in helping the community it created. A documentary about his life and philosophy entitled The Hate Man, Street Philosopher was released in August 2017.  Personal life  Hawthorne was married, but later divorced. He was homeless by choice. He died on April 2, 2017, at the age of 80. He also had two daughters  See also  References  Category:20th-century American philosophers Category:21st- century American philosophers Category:1936 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Culture of Berkeley, California Category:People from Maryland Category:Writers from Stamford, Connecticut Category:Street people Category:United States Air Force officers Category:University of Connecticut alumni Category:Writers from Berkeley, California Category:Writers from Washington, D.C.

It is similar in beauty to Mystic Vale, the forested ravine located to the south east and outside of the University of Victoria (UVIC) campus. Mystic Vale is on the list of protected areas of British Columbia. Geography and Location The total area of Haro Woods is about 9 hectares (approx. 22.25 acres). The northwest half (4.5 hectares, or 11.1 acres) is owned by the Queen Alexandra Foundation for Children's Health. The southeast half of Haro Woods is now split between the Municipality of Saanich (3 hectares, or about 7.4 acres) and UVIC (1.5 hectares, or about 3.7 acres). Controversy CRD purchased the northwest half of the Woods from the Queen Alexandra Foundation for Children's Health so that it would possibly be available to use for sewage treatment by the region. The QA Foundation leases some of their land to VIHA to provide medical services to children at the Queen Alexandra Centre for Children's Health. Concerned citizens realize Haro Woods might face a new threat, that of the destruction of its central core, in order to build one of CRD's secondary sewage treatment plants. The construction of such a plant in this area runs against urban planning as most settlements and cities show forethought and conscious design in their layout and functioning. Haro Woods is of historical significance as a public wild woodland in the Queenswood neighbourhood with many citizens and members of the Cadboro Bay Residents Association working to remove invasive species (blackberry, broom etc.) from one of its sections. In the spring of 2008 in a three-week period, thousands of signatures were gathered in a petition to save the area from inappropriate development. UVIC has already committed in their Campus Plan to retain their part of Haro Woods as protected greenspace \\"in perpetuity\\". It now appears, in 2011, that sewage treatment will be developed at other sites in the Greater Victoria region.

Life  Otto was born on 24 August 1495 as the eldest son of Henry the Middle and his wife, Margarete of Saxony. Like his brothers, Ernest and Francis he studied at Wittenberg and was affected early on by the reformatory ideas of Martin Luther and was later a driving force behind the introduction of the Reformation in the Principality of L√ºneburg. When his father had to leave the state in 1520 as a result of his role in the Hildesheim Diocesan Feud and go into exile in France, Otto took over the reins of power in the principality jointly with his brother Ernest.

Djedefre had four sons (Hornit, Baka, Setka and Nikaudjedefre) and two daughters (Hetepheres C and Neferhetepes) but it is not known if Khentetka or Hetepheres (or even another woman) was the mother of these children.Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton, The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt 2004 It has been suggested that Princess Neferhetepes was the daughter of Djedefre by Hetepheres.Grimal, A History of Ancient Egypt, pg 72 Statues and burial Khentetka is known from statues found at Abu Rawash. She is depicted kneeling beside the foot of king Djedefre. (Because of Egyptian art's use of hierarchical proportion, her figure is unnaturally tiny compared to the king's.) A structure in the southwest corner of Djedefre's pyramid complex at Abu Rawash has been suggested as a possible burial place for Khentetka. Maragioglio and Rinaldi believe it may be the pyramid belonging to the Queen consort, and that could point to the pyramid belonging to Queen Khentetka. It is not entirely clear however what the purpose of the pyramid was. Stadelmann and Jonosi believe it to be a cult pyramid. The cult pyramid usually stood in the southeast corner of the pyramid complex. The general orientation of the pyramid complex of Djedefre is north-west however and not east-south as is more common. The difference in orientation may mean the cult pyramid may not be located in its usual position, and the structure could be the cult pyramid for Djedefre's pyramid complex.

Plot Set in Arakawa, Tokyo, the series tells the story of Kou Ichinomiya, a man who has accomplished everything by himself. Ever since he was little, his father has taught him one rule: to never be indebted to another person. One day by accident, he falls into the Arakawa River and almost drowns. A girl by the name of Nino rescues him and, in return, he owes her his life. Unable to accept the fact that he is indebted to her, he asks her about a way for him to repay her. In the end, she tells him to love her, beginning Kou's life of living under a bridge. However, as Kou starts to learn, Arakawa is a place full of weirdos and all of the people living under the bridge are what society would call \\"denpasan\\". Characters ; : :Played by: Kento Hayashi :Kou is the future owner of the Ichinomiya corporation. He is 22 years old and a university student before living under the bridge.

If she becomes frightened or angry, she'll pull her sweatsuit over her head and climb on top of a streetlamp. ; : :Played by: Shun Oguri :The village chief is a self- proclaimed 620-year-old kappa (despite him obviously wearing a green kappa costume). As chief, anyone who wants to live in the village has to get his approval and have him give the person a new name. His face changes when he is running very fast, as shown in the village's annual race. It is unknown if he is faster than Shiro, since every year, he always loses interest in the race and drops out by default. Using the excuse of preparing for the trip to Venus, he tricked the villagers into building him a villa under the river. He seems to have some secret and is protecting Nino. He does realize that he is not really a kappa, and in times of seriousness, he will stop wearing his suit. He has great influence with the local government, as shown when he single handedly stopped Ric's father's plan to destroy Arakawa. He is very protective of Nino, even threatening Shimazaki, who was researching Nino, with death. ; : :Played by: Takayuki Yamada :A 24-year-old singer and a self-proclaimed superstar. He is in love with Nino and is always jealous of Kou for their relationship. Under his star mask is a moon mask and under that is his real face, which has red hair. When he becomes depressed, he'll start calling himself a starfish, and wears his star mask backwards. He likes to go to the nearby convenience store and buy cigarettes. Four years prior, he was a top- notch singer and supposedly constantly topped the Oricon charts. But he was bothered by the fact that he could never come up with his own songs. While battling with this feeling, he met Nino and realized that what he wanted was music that he created himself. His job is to provide music during special events in the village, but his songs' lyrics are mostly weird and complete nonsense. His name literally means \\"Star.\\" ; : :Played by: Yuu Shirota :A strong man that dresses like a nun. Twenty-nine years old and British, Sister is a war veteran with an affinity for artillery and always has a gun with him. He has a scar on the right side of his face, whose origin is unknown. He cares for Nino's wellbeing as well as asking Kou if his love for Nino was real. Every Sunday, he holds a mass that usually lasts only a few seconds in the church under the bridge. This involves having his congregation run to line up, firing his machine gun in the air, and asking if anyone did anything wrong. If he gets no response, the service ends and everyone present gets a bag of cookies. It is unknown what would happen if anyone has done something wrong. Strangely, while Sister is dressed as a Catholic sister, his church is adorned with an Orthodox cross. Under his robe is a military outfit from his days as a soldier. He may still believe himself to be in the middle of a war, as he lays down booby traps all the time and is shown to always be thinking in terms of military strategics. He is in love with Maria, whom he met during the last war he was in, whose insults are the only things that can unnerve him, causing his scar to open up. Surprisingly, he is good at making cookies and other sweets. ; : :Played by: Toru Tezuka :A cordial, 43-year-old man who is obsessed with always stepping on a white line (since he believes his wife will turn into a white cornish if he doesn't, something he fears above anything else), therefore he always walks around pushing a line painter so that he always has something white to walk on. According to him, he has had this obsession six years prior to the start of the series and has not seen his family since. His real name is and he used to be an office worker at a major corporation before he started living under the bridge. He does not have a job for the village though. He is married to a wife who understands his obsession and has a high school-aged daughter. Despite being estranged with his family, they seem to still be very close, with his wife lining up and mailing him the forms for stepping on white lines tournaments. Though usually polite with everyone in the village, he is shown to be fiercely competitive; he spends the entire year training for the village's annual race, because \\"it's the only time [he] gets the spotlight.\\" It is hinted that he may be the strongest person in the village. During the village's Sumo Wrestling competition, Sister and Maria, both being war veterans and heavily experienced fighters, and the Chief, a self proclaimed kappa and the reigning master of Sumo Wrestling at the village, all forfeited when they saw Shiro obsessively chanting his determination to stay in the shikiri-sen, the two white lines at the centre of a Sumo wrestling ring. His name literally means \\"White.\\" ; : :Played by: Takuto Sueoka / Raito Mashiko : and are a pair of young boys in sailor suits who wear metal helmets. Like Hoshi, they are jealous of Kou's relationship with Nino. They are self-proclaimed espers, saying that they have psychic powers and that their helmets are so that they won't float away or be detected by the military, with the unfortunate side-effect of them being unable to use their powers. The only powers they have said they have so far are flight and the ability to travel through time and space. Their jobs are being in charge of the hot baths in the oil barrels. Oddly enough, they are first shown to be teenagers and later seemed to regress to children. ; : :Played by: Natsumi Abe :A young red-haired girl who grows vegetables for the village. The epitome of a klutzy girl, she is literally dangerously clumsy, often turning what should be a simple accident into a massive disaster.

Kou is strongly against this and in their argument, he learns much to his horror that she already possesses a motorcycle license. She has a crush on the village chief, but he is unaware of her feelings. Her hair grows extremely quick, and she needs a hair cut every week. ; : :Played by: Nana Katase :Maria is a pink haired woman who runs a nearby farm where all the Arakawa residents get their dairy and produce from. While having a beautiful appearance, she casually passes out incredibly harsh insults to other people and is a sadist that can not stand a week without insulting someone. She looks down on males and only acts mean to them. She met Sister during the last war that they had and was an opposing spy that tried to get information from him. ; : :Played by: Eri Tokunaga :Stella is a little blonde girl from an orphanage in England that Sister ran. While initially thought to be small and cute, she is a powerful fighter and sometimes speaks in a threatening tone to show her superiority. When she is angry, she has the ability to turn into a giant and look extremely masculine, very closely resembling (and also often parodying) Raoh from Fist of the North Star. She has a crush on Sister, which made her hostile towards Maria initially. But after meeting and fighting Maria, she grows fond of her, and looks up to her. She considers herself the boss of Arakawa, and sees the twins as her underlings. ; : :Played by: Takaya Kamikawa :Kou's strict father, who adheres to his family's rules and looks down on Kou.

He comes from a samurai family and the sword that he has was an inheritance passed down from his ancestors. Before he started living under the bridge, he was a famous hairdresser that captured the hearts of all his female customers. At the time, in order to prevent them from turning around and looking at him, he needed to put eye covers on all of them. He listened to all the comments of his female customers and felt that he had lost his way as a hairdresser. One night, he went to the bridge to swing his sword around and suddenly met the chief. After a brief conversation, his samurai blood boiled up and he regained his confidence. He seems to be in love with P-KO. ; : :Played by: Norihisa Hiranuma :A man with a parrot head. He was formerly a member of a yakuza group and was well respected among the people. However, he fell in love with the wife of his boss.

(born Anna Felicia Viti; 10 February 1827 ‚Äì 20 November 1922) was an Italian Benedictine nun who has been beatified by the Roman Catholic Church. Life Anna Felicia Viti was born in Veroli, a comune in Italy's Province of Frosinone, on 10 February 1827. Her father was Luigi Viti, a landowner who was a gambling addict and a heavy drinker, and her mother Anna, n√©e Bono, died when Maria was fourteen years old. The third eldest of nine children, Maria was saddled with the responsibility of raising the other children upon the death of her mother. In order to support her family, she worked as a housekeeper. Her father's alcoholism grew worse, and so Maria's employment constituted the majority of the family's income. For a while, she was wooed by a young man from Alatri, but she decided to enter religious life instead. An English engraving of a Benedictine nun: Sr. Maria Fortunata lived as a nun for more than seventy years. Maria joined the Benedictines at the Monastery of San Maria de'Franconi in Veroli on 21 March 1851, at the age of 24. After her religious profession, she took the name Maria Fortunata. Though she spent more than seventy years in the Order, she never progressed beyond the office of housekeeper: she served the monastery by spinning, sewing, washing, and mending clothing. Sister Maria remained illiterate her entire life, but she had great devotion to the Blessed Sacrament. At the age of 95, Sister Maria died on 20 November 1922 in Veroli, of natural causes. Veneration After Sister Maria's death, miracles were reported at her gravesite. Also, reports of miracles were attested to during her lifetime, including certain episodes that suggest she had a gift of prophecy. According to one story, she began to cry during Mass, because she had seen that the celebrating priest would leave his calling, and she was filled with sorrow for him. She also predicted that another priest would leave the priesthood, but that he would repent and come back. In addition, two women who had been healed of meningitis in their childhood attributed their cures to her prayers. In 1935, her remains were transferred from a mass grave to the abbey church, and the process of her canonization was begun. Sister Maria Fortunata was declared venerable on 8 April 1964 by Pope Paul VI, and beatified on 8 October 1967 by the same pope. Her feast day is on 20 November. The cause for the canonization of Sister Maria is pending. Notes * In the original Italian: Umilt√†: Maria Fortunata personifica questa virt√π. La sua grandezza √® questa piccolezza.

Climbing the mountain Marich Pass Field Studies Centre represents a good base from which to explore the mountain and guides are available to help you with the ascent. It is a three-day hike to the top and back, and it is advised that hikers stay a night or two at the wonderful Mount Mtelo Viewpoint Camp , a campsite with cottage accommodation run by the Ywalasiwa family. However, it is possible to get to the campsite by vehicle, an amazing drive up the Sekerr escarpment. No specialist equipment or training is required for the climb, and there are different trails that can be taken to the campsite and peak passing through cultivated areas of the Pokot, forest, bamboo and open moorland, with extensive views of eastern Uganda and north- west Kenya on a clear day. The mountain is considered sacred, as it is described as the cradle of pastoral Pokot according to oral traditions . Mount Mtelo is home to black-and-white colobus monkeys, small antelope, 3 species of turaco and 10 sunbird species. The altitude means the temperature and humidity is lower than in Marich, making hiking far more comfortable as well as being unfavourable for mosquitoes. Community and development projects The area is home to six clans Chapin, Kamket, Ngusurot, Silokot, Talai and Tungo with an overall population of over 30,000. However, the area is isolated, and most people are involved in subsistence farming (maize and beans). In recent years local people, with outside assistance, have worked to set up a number of community projects aimed at helping the Pokot people of the Mbara sub- location. These projects have included: the creation of a number of water pipeline projects which provide safe drinking water to the local population; the building of a new clinic; and a tree nursery controlled by a local women's group. Mtelo ","title":"Mount Mtelo"},{"id":"26918492","text":"The Amphibamidae are an extinct family of dissorophoid temnospondyls known from Late Carboniferous-Early Permian strata in the United States.  Classification  Amphibamidae has traditionally included small-bodied, terrestrial dissorophoids. The name is attributed to Moodie (1909), but it was rarely used because it originally referred only to Amphibamus. Similar monogeneric families were also erected for other small, terrestrial dissorophoids (e.g., Doleserpetontidae), and most of the taxa now recognized as amphibamiforms were placed within the Dissorophidae. Clack & Milner (1993) revived the Amphibamidae to include Amphibamus, Platyrhinops, Doleserpeton, and Tersomius. Daly (1994) further expanded the composition of the Amphibamidae to include the newly described Eoscopus as well as the Early Triassic form Micropholis. She suggested that the micromelerpetids were also amphibamids, which has not been validated by more recent workers. Subsequent phylogenetic work verified the monophyly of the Amphibamidae, with recent analyses also recovering the branchiosaurids nested within the amphibamids. Schoch (2018) erected the new clade Amphibamiformes to include the traditional amphibamids and the nested branchiosaurids and subsequently restricted the Amphibamidae to two taxa: Doleserpeton annectens from the Dolese Brothers Limestone Quarry near Richards Spur, Oklahoma and Amphibamus grandiceps from Mazon Creek, Illinois. These taxa are united by several features, such as a medially expanded choana.  Phylogeny of amphibamiforms from Schoch (2018) Relationship to the Batrachia The Amphibamidae have typically been recovered close to some or all of the lissamphibian crown. Until the description of Gerobatrachus, Doleserpeton was considered to be the closest extinct relative to the crown group. Below is a modified cladogram from Anderson et al. (2008) showing Batrachia nested in the Amphibamidae, with Gerobatrachus as the sister taxon of Batrachia (anurans and caudates) and Doleserpeton and Amphibamus as successive outgroups: There is continued debate over the origin of lissamphibians, including whether they are monophyletic or whether batrachians and caecilians are descended from different clades of tetrapods or temnospondyls. If they are monophyletic, there is also a debate about which clade they are nested in, with some hypotheses suggesting a lepospondyl origin, in which case amphibamids would not be closely related to any extant amphibians.

Eschewing any grandiose view of his literature and his way of life, he wrote for the layman and general reading entertainment as a raconteur. As such his writings, though well populated with researched fact through his wide travels and many hours of research in the South African and British archives, do not constitute in any strict sense historical or academic reference works. Nevertheless, he remains frequently cited as a recorder of little remembered or noted fact of some historical or cultural significance in the southern African domain. Early life and education Green was born in Kimberley, South Africa, the only son of George Alfred Lawrence Green (a newspaper editor who went on to become a member of parliament in the first Union of South Africa and editor-in-chief of the Cape Argus) and Katherine (n√©e Bell). He was educated at private schools in Grahamstown and Cape Town, completing his secondary education at South African College Schools. Against his father‚Äôs wishes, he did not gain any tertiary education. In 1917 he was accepted as an air cadet in the Royal Flying Corps at Denham, England. He however never graduated as a pilot, allegedly because of a poor grasp of mechanical aspects of aircraft operation. On his return to SA at the end of World War 1, while contemplating a life in the merchant navy, he settled on a career in journalism with the Cape Argus. Although Green never married, he maintained a close and well documented platonic relationship with Luise (‚ÄúLulu‚Äù) Yates-Benyon, the mother of his biographer-to-be, John Yates-Benyon. On his death in 1972 from metastasized melanoma, he was survived by two sisters, Rita and Rosemary. The latter was a successful UK author of adolescent literature, for example Pyewacket (novel), under her married name of Rosemary Weir. Literary career Early signs of Green‚Äôs writing talents are evidenced by his winning of an international essay competition at the age of nine with a piece titled, ‚ÄúA Day in the Country‚Äù. Little is documented about Green‚Äôs subsequent literary ambitions until he drifted into journalism with the Cape Argus during his father‚Äôs tenure as editor. While showing talent as a journalist he declined offers of promotion or new postings to advance his newspaper career, being content to fulfil his duties as contributor to the Cape Argus‚Äôs daily ‚ÄúWanderer‚Äôs‚Äù column, and other assignments, on the proviso he could remain in Cape Town. For a brief period he left the newspaper to try his hand in London as a Fleet Street reporter, but soon returned to the Argus. In the formative phase of his writing career he experimented briefly with fiction writing but discarded this in favour of travelogues and other non- fiction, claiming to have little of value to offer the reader in the former genre even though an admirer of novelists such as Ernest Hemingway, Graham Greene and W. Somerset Maugham. Instead, he gained popular renown for his evocative tales on southern African travels, discovery and 18th, 19th and 20th century local history. His first success came with the publication of short stories in foreign magazines from 1929 onwards. His first book was published in 1933 in the UK, as were his next five books. By virtue of restricting his writings to popular non-fiction, Green is seldom mentioned in either local or international references as an African writer of note. However, amongst cognoscenti of travelogues and cultural history and collectors of Africana, he remains highly regarded and is sometimes cited as belonging to a select group of English travel writers of the 20th century such as Eric Newby and Wilfred Thesiger, though he cannot be considered a writer in the heroic travel idiom. Even though an intrepid traveller in especially Europe and Africa, he had a predilection to travelling in style and declined any rough travel where he could so. His writing more correctly typifies the mid 20th century colonial and post-colonial era non-fiction writing of Southern Africa, along with others of note such as F.C. Metrowich, T.V. Bulpin and Eric Rosenthal. In a number of respects his literary career ran concurrent with that of Laurens van der Post though there is no record of the two literary figures ever meeting. Inherently conservative and Eurocentric in style, Green's work nevertheless encompasses all the cultural diversity of the sub-continent, often alluding to changes in the social and political milieu but rarely judgemental in regard to socio-political issues under debate at the time. Unlike many of his contemporaries of South African literature, he is however devoid of any political commentary or critique. He employed mainly first and third person narrative style in short story chapter form, usually contained within a book with particular thematic content. Green ranks as one of the most prolific writers to come out of Africa. Sales of all his published books amount to more than 750,000 copies. In all, he produced 34 books (including a writer's guide), at least 16 stories for foreign and local magazines and many newspaper articles and letters. Six of his best-selling books were subsequently reproduced and published under different titles in the UK and at least three translated into a foreign language. He published on average a book a year between 1933 and 1972, other than the World War 2 years where his duties with the Royal and South African Air Force in north Africa impacted on his free time. His publications in his earlier writing career ran concurrently with his duties as journalist for the Cape Argus. By 1954, earnings from his books were such that he was able to retire from journalism to pursue writing full-time and he continued to publish at the rate of a book a year thereafter up to his death. Personality and reputation All who knew Green characterised him as a retiring, solitary figure who studiously avoided publicity, other than through his published writing. He however was willing to grant time and advice to aspiring writers when called on to do so, as attested by private correspondence. While one biography on Green exists (Memories of a Friendship, John Yates-Benyon, Howard Timmins, 1973) he remains, despite his stature as a man of letters and popular literature, an enigma. According to lifelong friend and confidant, Scott Haigh, he professed on a number of occasions to be about to commence his autobiography, but never formally did so, a fact corroborated by Yates-Benyon. Green's reminiscences in Where Men Still Dream: The life and memories, travels and encounters of a South African writer (1945) and When the Journey's Over (1972) come as close to autobiographical as his long writing career allowed. Howard Timmins, previous head of the Cape Town-based but now defunct Howard Timmins & Co. publishing firm, was also ranked as close friend of the author. Timmins was responsible for the bulk of the writer‚Äôs book publishing in South Africa. He and Haigh similarly, in tributes to Green contained in The Best of Lawrence Green, a book of collected writings and reminisces of Green, edited by Haigh, alluded to the author‚Äôs reserve and shunning of publicity.

Background By 1324, Edward II was ruling England with his royal favourite Hugh Despenser the Younger in an increasingly despotic manner.Doherty, pp80-1. Although Edward had defeated his Lancastrian opponents in 1322, many of his enemies had escaped to France from where they still conspired against Despenser and him. Already during 1324 there had been an attempt to murder the pair, although the conspiracy had been foiled.Doherty, p.80. The conspiracy John of Nottingham was said to have been hired to kill the unpopular Edward II, shown here in a contemporary picture, and several of the king's key supporters with magic. According to the case brought by the prosecution, twenty eight citizens of Coventry had become particularly discontented with the Prior of Coventry, who had been extracting considerable taxes from the city with the backing of the Despensers.Lea, p.458. In November 1323 they had approached John of Nottingham, a famous magician based in Coventry, to request his assistance in killing the King, Hugh Despenser and his father, along with the prior, using magic.Wright, p.16. John had set about doing this using necromantic ceremonies involving wax effigies of his targets. Using seven pounds of wax and two yards of cloth, John allegedly made effigies of the four main targets, the prior's unpopular caterer and his steward, along with one of Richard de Lowe, a local man on whom the magic was to be first tested.Wright, p. 17. John was said to have worked with his assistant Robert Marshall in a deserted house just outside Coventry on the magical effigies, which he ultimately tested in 1324 by driving a lead pin first into the head, and then the heart of de Lowe's effigy; de Lowe apparently died as a result. Unfortunately for John, his assistant Marshall then turned him into the authorities, potentially as the result of a grievance against his master, before any further attacks could be made. The case against John and his sponsors came up before the King's Bench later in the year, in which the group were tried for the murder of de Lowe. They were found innocent by the jury.Lea, p. 458. Consequences Hugh Despenser became extremely concerned for his personal safety after this case. He wrote to Pope John XXII asking for his assistance in protecting him against magical attack.Doherty, p.81. The Pope, who was not favourably inclined towards the Despensers, curtly advised him to \\"turn to God with his whole heart and make a good confession and such satisfaction as shall be enjoined. No other remedies are necessary beyond this general indulgence which the Pope grants him.\\" The case added to the febrile atmosphere that led to the overthrow of Edward II and the Despensers two years later.

The club was the product of the post World War II Soviet-occupation of East Germany and, unlike most German clubs, lays no claim to any earlier tradition. Throughout its history, SV has been a multi-sports club and at various times has included departments for athletics, billiards, bowling, boxing, canoeing, cycling, gymnastics, handball, ice hockey, sailing, table tennis, tennis, volleyball, and weightlifting. Many of these departments were lost following German reunification in 1990.  History  SV was established 12 May 1951 as Betriebssportgemeinschaft Aufbau Wei√üensee serving as the sports club for a number of small civil engineering firms that were later grouped together as VEB Tiefbau Berlin, then Kombinat Tiefbau Berlin. In 1954, Wei√üensee merged with BSG Vorw√§rts Gosen to become BSG Aufbau Tiefbau Berlin which played lower tier city football. Three years later, the club was joined by BSG Motor Wei√üensee-S√ºd and the football department of Sportclub Aufbau Berlin and took up the place of SC in the fourth division Bezirksliga Berlin. The following season the team was renamed BSG Tiefbau Berlin and in 1960 won promotion to the 2. DDR-Liga (III) where they would spend three seasons before being sent down through league restructuring. They made their first appearance in FDGB- Pokal (East German Cup) play in the 1963‚Äì64 tournament and were quickly eliminated in the first round.Gr√ºne, Hardy (2001). Enzyklop√§die des deutschen Ligafu√üballs 7. Vereinslexikon. Kassel: Agon-Sportverlag. . Tiefbau remained a fifth-division side over the next two decades until advancing to the Berziksliga Berlin (IV) in 1984. They gradually improved their standing until finally earning a second-place result in 1990 on the eve of the reunification of Germany. The separate football competitions of East and West Germany were combined and, like many former East German clubs, the team abandoned its old name becoming Sportverein Blau-Gelb Berlin. Blau-Gelb spent 1991‚Äì93 as part of the Landesliga Berlin (V) before slipping all the way down to ninth-tier play in subsequent seasons. It was during this period that the club made three more cup appearances ‚Äì in each case going out in the first round ‚Äì in the FDGB- Pokal in 1989‚Äì90, the transitional NOFV-Pokal in 1990‚Äì91 and the DFB-Pokal (German Cup) in 1991‚Äì92. A first-place finish in 2007 in the Kreisliga Berlin (VIII) saw the team promoted to the Bezirksliga Berlin (VII). League restructuring in 2008 following the creation of the 3. Liga (III) saw the leagues below it, including the Bezirksliga and Kreisliga, demoted by one level. Another first-place finish in 2012 earned Blau-Gelb a place in the Landesliga Berlin (VII) but was moved back to the Bezirksliga after finishing bottom in 2015.

He was a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. During World War I, he had served in the Luftstreitkrafte and shot down a total of 7 aircraft between July and October 1918. From 1921 to 1934, he also served in the German police, reaching the rank of Hauptmann. Georg Ritter von Hengl was captured by Allied troops in May 1945 and was released in 1947. Life and career=World War I Hengl joined the German army as an ensign in 1914, aged 16, serving initially in Reserve Infantry Battalion Nr. 21 near Ypres in 1914. The following year saw him transferred to the Eastern Front to serve in Russia. In October 1915, he was transferred south to the Serbian sector. He transferred back to France in 1916, to serve near Verdun; on 23 March he was promoted into the officer's ranks as a Leutnant. He then returned to duties in Russia. After requesting a transfer to aviation duty, he started aerial observer's training on 23 February 1918. Upon graduation, he was posted to the Kingdom of Bavaria's FA(A) 295. His usual pilot in the two-seater reconnaissance aircraft was Johann Baur. The duo were credited with six confirmed aerial victories together, beginning with a double victory over SPADs on 17 July 1918 over Courton Wood. The aircrew of Hengl and Baur were shot down behind British lines during the Third Battle of the Aisne; however, they were rescued from captivity by troopers from W√ºrttemberg. The pair would score another four victories in October 1918, with Hengl scoring a seventh while crewing for another pilot. Georg Hengl emerged from World War I having been awarded both classes of the Iron Cross and the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern. His native Kingdom of Bavaria also bestowed the Military Order of Max Joseph upon him; one of the entitlements of this decoration was an award of lifetime nobility for him, signified by the addition of the phrase \\"Ritter von\\" to one's name. Georg Hengl thus became George Ritter von Hengl.The Aerodrome website: page on Hengl (Retrieved 16 February 2013) Inter-war and World War II In 1919 Hengl left the army and entered the police. Recalled for military service, in 1936 he was given command of a battalion of the 99th Gebirgsjager Regiment, leading this unit in the first campaigns of World War II. For much of the war, Hengl was stationed on the Arctic front against the Soviet Union. Initially he commanded the 137th Gebirgsjager Regiment, receiving the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross in August 1941. From March 1942 to October 1943 he commanded the 2nd Mountain Division, and then the XIX Mountain Corps until April 1944. In February 1945 he was designated to take over command of LIX Army Corps on the Eastern Front, but he did not take up the post. Hengl ended the war with the rank of General of Mountain Troops ().

It can be divided into three forms, depending upon age of onset: congenital lymphedema, lymphedema praecox, and lymphedema tarda. Congenital lymphedema presents at birth. Lymphedema praecox presents from ages 1 to 35. This type of lymphedema accounts for 77‚Äì94% of all cases of primary lymphedema. Lymphedema tarda presents after age 35. This type of lymphedema usually develops as a result of a developmental abnormality being precipitated by some insult such as trauma, illness, or physical immobility. Compared to secondary lymphedema, primary lymphedema is more likely to involve the face, conjunctiva, and genitalia in association with any limbs involved.Burkhart CN, Adigun C, Burton CS.

Mockado was usually constructed with a woollen pile on a linen or worsted wool warp and woollen weft, although the ground fabric could be any combination of wool, linen, and silk. Mockado was used for furnishings and carpeting, and also for clothing such as doublets, farthingales, and kirtles.Montgomery (2007) pp. xiv-xv Mockado was introduced to England from Flanders in the mid-sixteenth century. Dutch and Walloon weavers fleeing Spanish rule in the Low Countries were creating mockadoes and other fabrics combining silk and linen with combed woollens in the weaving center of Norwich by 1571. Varieties included plain, with an even pile, and \\"tuft\\" or voided mockado. Mockadoes were woven in solid or changeable colours, and were sometimes stamped with patterns in imitation of more expensive Utrecht velvets Mockado was always a rough fabric, and by the 1580s, the term \\"mockado\\" was synonymous with \\"inferior\\" or \\"tawdry\\". In discussing the old English tradition of new clothes at Easter, folklorist Peter Opie cites Thomas Lodge's 1596 pamphlet Wits Miserie : > \\"The farmer that was contented in times past with his Russet Frocke & > Mockado sleeues, now sels a Cow against Easter to buy him silken geere for > his Credit\\". In the seventeenth century, the term mockado ends was used for a wool yarn, probably a worsted yarn similar to crewel yarn of that period, likely used for embroidery and making braids and fringes. Mockadoes continued in use for furnishings such as wall hangings, chair covers, and stools, as well as carpeting.

Although it has been open for well over one hundred years, it remains in strong structural condition, and it served daily traffic into the late twentieth century. A single-span structure completed in 1875, the bridge was constructed under the leadership of Marietta bridge builder William Meredith. One of his primary employees was stonemason Billy Gamble, who used locally quarried stone to construct the abutments. The source for this stone was the farm of James Harrah, whose name (minus its final letter) was given to the bridge. The plan for the bridge used the Long truss design; fewer than ten historic Long truss bridges remain in Ohio today.

According to one reviewer: \\"Out of such exacting, precise working methods he produces music of an often breathtaking spontaneity.

It's this sense of spontaneity which adds to Wall's standing as one of the most original composers working in the last decade of the twentieth century, and Fractuur his most essential work to date.\\"Sonomu review of Fractuur Fractuur is on the syllabus for the Christoph Cox's \\"Contemporary Music and Musical Discourse\\" course at Hampshire College along with recordings by King Tubby and Miles Davis.Syllabus for \\"Contemporary Music and Musical Discourse\\" unit at Hampshire College Constructions I-IV and Constructions V-II After Fractuur, the CDs and compositions have both become progressively shorter. Writing in The Wire, Phil England noted that Constructions V-VII \\"develops his tendency towards the quiet, the sparse, the minimal. (...) Wall has largely dropped the tension and release, and the play between the real and the artificial (...) [Constructions provides] evidence that Wall's considerable aural sensitivity allows him to feel increasingly at ease with a relatively unforced drama of pure sound.\\"England, Phil (May 2001) review of Constructions V-VII, The Wire issue 207 Other commentators have however referred to \\"the edginess in his music, its restlessness, its often ambiguous nature, its rarely resolved tension.\\" With Consctructions I-IV the composer's own recordings of musicians took precedence over fragments sampled from CDs and the composer showed a preference for improvising musicians over musicians who specialise in interpreting written work. According to Marley: \\"He wanted to retain [free improvisation‚Äôs] key features ‚Äì the feeling of spontanaeity, of unpredictability, and the music's sheer raw intensity. He wanted to tweak each moment until it sang; even if that took countless hours to achieve.\\" Hylic His most recent work includes very little sampling from CDs and one critic suggested that Wall's work now has more in common with the meticulous constructions of tape composers like Bernard Parmegiani. Marley: \\"Like Parmegiani, Wall constructs transformative electroacoustic soundscapes of remarkable individuality. His is a muscular, energetic music that seems to contradict itself by being perpetually on the verge of doubt and disintegration (...) Even the most minimal of the soundscapes has, for example, an astonishing degree of inbuilt complexity, although it may consist of little more than the endlessly varied colouration, weight and placement of bumps and clicks.\\"Marley, Brian (April 2003), review of Hylic, The Wire issue 230 cphon cphon features a single piece that ran to just over 20 minutes in length. Writing in The Wire, Julian Cowley described the work as follows: \\"Shrill needle points of sound, whisps and shadows, punctuating clicks, muted thuds and clangs edge to and from that pivotal centre where the keyboard briefly and equivocally asserts itself. It's austere rather than chaste, conveying a sense of cryptic narrative rather than pure abstracted shape. No invitation to relax is offered at any point; tension is Wall's forte. From the high pitch signal that initiates the piece's progression to the odd hobbling rhythm that draws it to a conclusion, the listening ear is kept at a pitch of alertness.\\"Cowley, Julian (December 2005), review of cphon, The Wire issue 262 Work 2006‚Äì2011 Wall returned in 2011 with a document of his collaboration with spoken word artist Alex Rodgers. Richard Pinnell interviewed the pairing for The Wire magazinePinnell, Richard (2011) \\"Failing Better\\" The Wire issue 329 and wrote in a separate review: \\"While Wall‚Äôs anger can be heard in the music, Rodgers‚Äô spoken word parts are equally acerbic. He sounds constantly on edge, his voice slurs in places, growls in others and has a gruff bite to it that is only amplified by the cheap dictaphones used to record many of his parts. His words move between a bitterly spat-out stream of angry obscenity-ridden disgust and a carefully worked out and scripted sense of surrealism all wrapped up in a Beckettian verbal sensibility.\\"Pinnell, Richard \\"Thursday 19th May\\" Live realisations John Wall has presented his work as tape playbacks at various events including at BBC Radio 3's Mixing It and London Musicians Collective (LMC)'s \\"New Aura\\" concert series at South Bank Centre in 1997Potter, Keith (26 March 1997) \\"Review: Avant-Garde: Hyperion Ensemble\\", The Independent and Sonic Arts Network's \\"Cut & Splice\\" at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in 2006.BBC Radio 3 Hear and Now programme listings archive page Both of these were broadcast by BBC Radio 3.

It was developed in the mid 2000s and is the fastest non-motorized sport on Earth. The speed, achieved by the human body in free fall, is a function of several factors; including the body's mass, orientation, and skin area and texture.While none of these matter in free fall in the absence of friction by Newton's Laws, they are significant when dealing with air resistance. In stable, belly-to-earth position, terminal velocity is about 200 km/h (120 mph). Stable freefall head down position has a terminal speed of 240‚Äì290 km/h (around 150‚Äì180 mph). Further minimization of drag by streamlining the body allows for speeds in the vicinity of 500 km/h (310 mph). Competition Participants compete for the best Meet Result and attempt to set World Records. A Meet Result is made up of 3 jumps from ‚Äúregular‚Äù skydiving altitude : 4,000 meters (13,124 ft). Meet Results and World Records can only be set during a sanctioned ISSA competition. Terminal Velocity The terminal velocity of a falling body occurs during free fall when the force due to gravity is exactly balanced by the force due to air resistance, such that the body experiences zero acceleration. The formula for terminal velocity (where buoyancy in air is negligible) is given by the thrust : v_\\\\mathrm{t}= \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2mg}{\\\\rho A C_\\\\mathrm{d} }} where * is the mass of the falling object * is the acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s2) * is the drag coefficient (~0.7 for head down position, ~1 for belly-to-earth position) * is the density of the fluid through which the object is falling (1.23 kg/m3 for air at sea level, and ~0.99 kg/m3 at the middle of the measurement zone (2200m)) * is the projected area of the object, or area cross-section (~0.18 m2 for head down position, ~0.7 for belly-to-earth position) So, for a human in belly-to-earth position ( m2, kg, ) this gives 50.6 m/s, about the terminal velocity of the typical skydiver of 55 m/s. The skydiver cannot increase their mass easily enough to significantly increase terminal velocity, and the skydiver's area cross-section is limited by their helmet and shoulders in a head-down dive position. The most significant difference comes from the skydiver reducing their coefficient of friction. The head-down body position has to be carefully managed to be as streamlined as possible, while special helmets and slick body suits reduce skin friction, which is a function of surface area and texture. The shape and rigidity of the suits also have to be designed to minimize the coefficient of drag. Finally, a skydiver must reach their maximum speed at as high an altitude as possible so that the density of air is at a minimum. Rules The International Speed Skydiving Association rules have altered over the years to accommodate the changes necessary. Some Speed Skydiving jargon involved is: The Measurement Zone: A vertical kilometer where speed measurements are taken. It starts at 2,700 m and ends at 1,700 m above the ground The Speed Measuring Device: Measurements are made by two free fall computers (Pro-Tracks) placed on the lateral webbing or in a line from it on the competitors rig. Speed Measurement: Speed is averaged over the measurement zone using two Pro-Tracks. Qualification Jump: Minimum qualification speed for men is 300 km/h and 250 km/h for women. The result is not used in the competition itself. Qualified Competitor: One who has met or exceeded the speed requirements, or who has previously participated in a competition qualifies to compete. Qualified Meet: No special conditions. Out of Boundaries (OB): When the speed difference between 2 Pro-Tracks is greater than 30 km/h Qualified Jump: Exit altitude is about 4,000 meters. Meet Result: The average of the best competition jumps, depending on the number of rounds completed The competition is held over a course of 3‚Äì4 days. Every competition consists of 6 individual rounds. The best 3 rounds are considered for the meet result (average speed). Out of bounds runs will result in a zero and there is no limitation to how many OBs a competitor can have, although they will affect the average result. The judges in speed skydiving competitions are the speed measuring devices, although the ISSA race commission will check each competitor to ensure that their gear is acceptable. Anything found dangerous is prohibited, as are the use of weights. The Race Commission is elected before every meet and is composed of a representative of every country competing. Their job is to ensure that both the competition and competitors follow the rules. They have no authority to change the rules, and refer to the FAI/PC Sporting Code. There is also a download team responsible for measuring the device handling, data download, and documentation of the use of the devices. Weather Weather can have an extraordinary effect on a competition as well as individual divers. In the event of bad weather or air traffic circumstances, the exit altitude is lowered. In addition, thick cloud conditions may cause a delay in the jump time altogether.

In some literature electromerism is equated to valence tautomerism, a term usually reserved for tautomerism involving reconnecting chemical bonds. One group of electromers are excited electronic states but isomerism is usually limited to ground state molecules. Another group of electromers are also called redox isomers: metal ions that can exchange their oxidation state with their ligands (see non-innocent ligand). One of the first instances was a cobalt bis(quinone) complex described by Buchanan and Pierpont in 1980 with a cobalt(II) complex in chemical equilibrium with the cobalt(III) complex. Ligands commonly found are based on dioxolenes, phenoxyl radicals and polychlorotriphenylmethyl radicals. Metalloporphyrins have also been studied.

He last worked for the #41 Stewart-Haas Racing Ford driven by Kurt Busch in the NASCAR Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series. He was the crew chief for Busch's 2017 Daytona 500 victory. Gibson worked as car chief on Alan Kulwicki‚Äôs title team of 1992 and was also the car chief on Jeff Gordon‚Äôs title teams of 1998 and 2001. With Dale Earnhardt Incorporated, Gibson, was the crew chief for racers such as Steve Park, Michael Waltrip, Dale Earnhardt, Jr, Mark Martin and at Stewart-Haas Racing for Ryan Newman from 2009 to the majority of 2012 and Danica Patrick for 2013 to most of 2014 before swapping drivers. Early life Gibson was born in Daytona Beach, Florida, United States. He, along with his father, built and maintained cars with his brother Mark as the driver. The Gibson family found success at short tracks around central Florida and even won a 1978 track championship at New Smyrna Speedway. While attending Daytona Beach Community College, Gibson continued to race with his family but after graduating with a Tool and Die making degree, he moved to North Carolina to pursue a NASCAR career. Racing career Gibson started in the 1980s hanging car bodies for various NASCAR Grand National and Winston Cup Series teams. While working as a body hanger he was befriended by Alan Kulwicki, a driver and owner in the Winston Cup Series, who was working in a nearby shop space. This led to Gibson becoming a mechanic on Kulwicki‚Äôs team in 1986. Kulwicki‚Äôs underdog team achieved a surprising Winston Cup championship win in 1992 with Gibson as car chief. After Kulwicki's death in 1993, until 1995, Gibson worked for former champion Bill Elliott helping him win the 1994 Southern 500 at Darlington. From 1998 to 2001, Hendrick Motorsports hired Gibson to work on the 24 car with driver Jeff Gordon. In his 1st year with Hendrick, he scored 13 wins and the 1998 Winston Cup title. In his last season, he scored 6 wins and the 2001 Winston Cup title. The combination scored a total of 29 victories, and 2 championships (the 2 titles were ironically in his 1st and last seasons respectively) in 4 years. Gibson moved to Dale Earnhardt Inc. in 2002 where he worked various roles. As a crew chief he worked with Steve Park and later Michael Waltrip. In 2005, he moved to the car chief position for Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and later worked as his crew chief for 12 races in 2007. Gibson moved over to Dale Earnhardt Inc.‚Äôs #8 Chevrolet, in 2008, driven part-time by Mark Martin and rookie Aric Almirola. His first full season as a Sprint Cup crew chief saw him help earn 4 top-five and 12 top-10 finishes. A new race team, Stewart-Haas Racing, created by a joint venture between Tony Stewart and Gene Haas, hired Gibson to lead the #39 of Ryan Newman. A decision to pit for just 2 tires led to his first victory with Newman on April 10, 2010 in the Subway Fresh Fit 600 at Phoenix. In 2017, Gibson was the winning crew chief at the Daytona 500, with Kurt Busch winning the race. In 2018, Gibson came out of retirement and became the crew chief for the 4 of Kevin Harvick after crew chief Rodney Childers got suspended for the final 2 races of the season due to a L1 spoiler penalty.

His league and championship career with the Cork senior team spanned eleven seasons from 1984 to 1994. Born in Midleton, County Cork, Hartnett first played competitive hurling at St. Colman's College in Fermoy. Here he was a member of the senior team that played in the Harty Cup. Hartnett later lined out with University College Cork, winning a Fitzgibbon Cup medal in 1985. Hartnett first appeared for the Midleton club at juvenile and underage levels, winning county under-21 championship medals. He later joined the club's senior team and won an All-Ireland medal in 1988. Hartnett also won two Munster medals and four county senior championship medals. In spite of never having played minor hurling for Cork, Hartnett made his debut on the inter-county scene at the age of nineteen when he was selected for the Cork under-21 team. He enjoyed two championship seasons with the under-21 team, winning an All-Ireland medal as a non-playing substitute in 1982. Hartnett subsequently joined his brother, John, on the Cork senior team, making his debut during the 1984 championship. Over the course of the next ten years, he won two All-Ireland medals, beginning with a lone triumph in his debut season in 1984 before adding a second winners' medal in 1986. Hartnett also won four Munster medals and one National Hurling League medal. After being chosen on the Munster Munster inter-provincial team for the first time in 1985, Hartnett was an automatic choice on the starting fifteen for three consecutive seasons. During that time he won one Railway Cup medal. After being involved in team management and coaching with the Midleton under-21 hurling team, Hartnett was appointed as a selector to the Cork minor team in 2014. He became a senior selector as part of Kieran Kingston's management team in 2015.

Research overview Dr. Miller's line of research in part emphasizes the sex trade industry in Sri Lanka. She has also examined the Sex Industry in the Netherlands. In addition, much of her work follows another line of research that focuses on females in gangs, as well as victimization experiences of urban African American girls. She looks particularly at female involvement in gangs due to the lack of research there is in this line of study. In particular, Dr. Miller makes a strong motion towards getting other feminist researchers to help contribute to the general study of gender and crime, particularly in underrepresented or unexplored areas of research.http://www.umsl.edu/services/academic/assets/PDFs/Miller_Service_Award_07.pdf Major works The following are two select article reviews of Miller's work: One of the Guys: Girls, Gangs and Gender. New York: Oxford University Press. This book, One of the Guys: Girls, Gangs and Gender is of particular importance on two levels; Randall G. Shelden reviews Dr. Miller's goals for this book: > What is especially unique about Miller's study is that it is comparative in > two ways: she includes two different cities ‚Äì St. Louis and Columbus ‚Äì and > compares gang and non-gang girls. She presents comparative data about > important socio-economic variables in each city (percent unemployed, percent > living in poverty, etc.) and how some of the differences ‚Äì and similarities > ‚Äì relate to gang participation. In the opening chapter by Miller, she describes the old paradigms that continue to restructure feminist criminology in new ways. Dr Miller states that the \\"...[Helpless] victim characteristic of early writings on girls in gangs and women who offend has been replaced by a 'resisting' one. Here women's criminal offending and girls' participation in gangs are characterized as response or resistance to victimization. And this is no doubt part of what's going on. Nonetheless, it's only part. The overemphasis on women's gendered victimization‚Äîand with it, the accentuation of gender differences‚Äîcontinues to permeate much of the feminist literature on women and crime, to the exclusion of other important issues.\\"pg. 199 In the foreword of her book, Malcolm W. Klein, a fellow leading researcher in American street gangs, states that Dr. Miller's work is of high importance in the understanding of street gangs, in particular to this research, the formation of urban female street gangs and memberships: > I am grateful for the publication of Dr. Miller's One of the Guys for many > reasons.

In the conclusion to Dr. Miller's book, she states a final summary to her book: > In this book, I most often have places young women's gang involvement within > the context of crime and criminology, specifically within the broader > criminological literature on youth gangs.

Violence Against Urban African American Girls: Challenges for Feminist Advocacy. New York: Oxford University Press In this article, Violence Against Urban African American Girls: Challenges for Feminist Advocacy (In the Journal of Contemporary Criminal Justice. 24: 148‚Äì162), Dr. Miller begins the article with an opening statement of how the pioneering effects of second wave feminism have problematized the issues relating to violence against women. In this discussion, Miller describes the challenges that result from the evolution from the academia, policy and the governmental expertise on violence against women, including tendencies to narrowly frame the problem as an issue relating to public health and criminal justice; moving away from the broader, and more predominate, issues of equality and justice. Dr. Miller draws from her research on violence against African American girls in troubled urban- central neighbourhoods; thus leading to her argument that feminist advocacy is the overarching goal of gendered related violence. The notion of violence against women has gained recognition as a serious social problem; based on the advancement of second wave feminism from the 1960s and 1970s. Second wave radical feminism moves to problematize violence against women have undoubtedly succeeded based on what Miller calls stakeholders, for whom are the academics, politicians, policy makers and other practitioners that claim this problem as their own. It is from this that Miller draws her two major claims of the article. The first claim is there is a shift away from the \\"women-defined understandings of violence that [guide] feminist consciousness-raising efforts towards the 'expert' understandings of various stakeholders\\" (pg. 149). Dr. Miller expresses here that there seems to be little attention has been paid towards the social impact of the overreliance of experts and expertise in the various social / political contexts by which these understandings are recognized. The latter claim argues that there is a tendency to decouple violence against women from its 'embeddedness' in other forums of violence and structural inequalities in society and to treat various forms of violence against women as a discrete, rather than interrelated, phenomena (pg. 149). Dr. Miller's argument draws on a qualitative study/investigation that she had recently completed (in 2008) on violence against adolescent African American girls in disadvantaged urban neighbourhoods. D. Miller states that in order for her to start this line of research a, \\"...[S]ystematic, ecologically embedded [approach is] necessary. This means offering remedies that attend to the root causes of urban disadvantage, addressing the resultant costs and consequences and also improving institutional support for challenging gender inequalities and strengthening young women's efficacy\\" (pg. 154-55). Miller states that in keeping with the feminist advocates' faith in mind, youths themselves offer a parallel of recommendations concerning changes that they would like to see in their lives; she lists four of those changes that these youth need to see happen in their lives (155‚Äì57): * Improving Neighbourhoods ‚Äì From her findings, Dr. Miller believes that since public policies have created certain concerted disadvantages for these youth, new policies can also improve the situation by stabilizing communities. It is here that Dr. Miller believes that a fostered of collective efficacy of community members through the production of social ties can, in turn, can increase protective mechanisms; such as the willingness to intervene on behalf of neighbours and monitor the behaviour of youth in general. * Increasing institutional accountability ‚Äì This recommendation by Dr. Miller focuses on the aspect of the police involvement with troubled neighbourhoods. Though policing cannot end violence against women, Dr. Miller acknowledges that police can create strategies that treat community members with respect rather than suspicion, engage residents and work to identify and meet their needs, and are more sensitive to the overall dynamics and significance of violence against women would go far in making law enforcement seem more credible/accountable. * Stabilizing community agencies and facilitating relationships with caring adults ‚Äì There are two aspects here that Dr. Miller would like to see changes in. First is community programs should engage in structured activities, jobs, and job training that can offer opportunities that serve as alternatives to the street. Much of findings in Dr. Miller's study emerged when youth participated in both unsupervised parties and delinquency. By providing young people with alternative opportunities, Miller believes that it could avert them from the social contexts that heighten the risk for violence against young women. Secondly, youth often lack stable relationships with adults that they could in turn to in times of need. Dr. Miller's findings state that young girls were suspicious of victim services which they associated with social service agencies. It is found that stable and trusted community agencies are an important avenue for providing young women with the support and resources they need when they are victimized. * Changing gender ideologies and challenging gender inequality ‚Äì According to Dr. Miller's findings, without broader social or institutional supports for addressing violence, the youth saw that the ultimate responsibility for protecting themselves was heavily relied upon themselves. An important goal here is to find ways by which young women generalize sympathetic recognition of their own friend's experiences to women in general. The way to achieve this goal is through a promising look at education and prevention; by bringing such programming to schools and community agencies, it may help young women recognize the commonalities of their own experiences in relation to gender inequalities.pg. 155-57 Research articles The following articles and abstracts reflect Dr. Miller's work in Sri Lanka: Miller, Jody and Kristin Carbone-Lopez. 2013. ‚ÄïGendered Carceral Regimes in Sri Lanka: Colonial Laws, Post-Colonial Practices, and the Social Control of Sex Workers.‚Äñ Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society. 39(1).

(Special issue on LGBT Sex Work). This article investigates the complex and contradictory ways in which gender identity, sexuality, and desire are configured in nachchi understandings of their lives in Sri Lanka. Nachchi was an insider term used by a group of sex workers best conceptualized using western understandings as both transgender and homosexual: nachchi celebrate their feminine gendered subjectivity, but also embrace key facets of their biological 'maleness,'and are ardent in their sexual desire for men. We examine the relationships between nachchi gender and sexual subjectivities, including how they compare and distinguish themselves from women and men. Particularly in the context of transactional sexual exchanges, we investigate the intersections of economics, desire, stigma and exploitation in shaping nachchi experiences. http://sex.sagepub.com/content/15/5-6/554.short Miller, Jody. 2011. ‚ÄïBeach Boys or Sexually Exploited Children? Competing Narratives of Sex Tourism and their Impact on Young Men in Sri Lanka's Sex Industry.‚Äñ Crime, Law and Social Change. 56: 485‚Äì508. Sex trafficking and the commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) are widely identified as global social problems, but each remain politically charged, especially given the disproportionate emphasis on sexual slavery. The current investigation is a case study of CSEC within the context of Sri Lanka's international tourism industry. I draw from data collected during a multi-year field study to analyze and compare those understandings of sex tourism and CSEC driven by local \\"moral crusaders\\"‚Äîwhich dominated policy and public discussion‚Äîwith the experiences of adolescent boys and young men who participated in these markets. Moral claims-making, focused as it was on cultural purity, morality, Western perversions, sexual slavery, and deviance, shifted attention away from the global political and economic contexts in which transactional sex took place. This resulted in both distortions and harms to marginalized youth in tourism communities, and a failure to address the economic realities of those involved in the informal tourism economy, including transactional sex with tourists. The current study thus adds additional support to the concerns raised by scholars and activists about the scope, nature, and impact of efforts to ameliorate commercial sexual exploitation, including the harms that result from narrow foci on individual deviance and sexual slavery. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10611-011-9330-5#page-1 Miller, Jody. 2002. ‚ÄïViolence and Coercion in Sri Lanka's Commercial Sex Industry: Intersections of Gender, Sexuality, Culture and the Law.‚Äñ Violence Against Women. 8(9): 1045‚Äì1074. This study examines the local conditions facing commercial sex workers in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Based on findings from a 3-year field comparative field study, the author investigates the widespread nature of violence, coercion, and harassment against women (including transgender women) and gay men in an illicit sex market whose primary clientele are Sri Lankan men. Specifically, the author examines the relationship between cultural definitions of gender/sexuality and the implementation of existing legal frameworks and its impact on the treatment and experiences of sex workers. The author provides an overview of pathways into the sex industry as well as variations in the nature of coercion, violence, and abuse across industry sectors, focusing specifically on street-level versus \\"indoor\\" (i.e., brothels, lodges, massage clinics) sectors of the local sex industry. http://vaw.sagepub.com/content/8/9/1044.abstract Miller, Jody. 2000. ‚ÄïThe Protection of ‚ÄóHuman Subjects' in Street Ethnography: Ethical and Practical Considerations from a Field Study in Sri Lanka.‚Äñ Focaal. 36: 53‚Äì68. (Special Issue on Contemporary Street Ethnography) Humanitarian work=The University of Missouri-St. Louis tsunami reconstruction project During her tenure as a Professor of Criminology & Criminal Justice at the University of Missouri-St. Louis (1998‚Äì2010), Dr. Miller began a new line of research examining the commercial sex trade in Sri Lanka, a notable location in South Asia for sex tourists seeking young children as their victims. She was supported by a Fulbright fellowship for this research, where she has acquired here use of fieldwork and interviewing techniques for her research. Given Dr. Miller's close relational ties to Sri Lanka, the Asian tsunami of December 2004 hit close to home. Immediately following the devastating tsunami, Dr. Miller began private fundraising relief efforts, which sequentially lead to colleague Dr. Bob Bursik donating his trademark ponytail to her cause; a local charity event that raised $4,000. Capitalizing on this opportunity, Dr. Miller sought out to seek help from the university as well. Working closely with colleague Dr. Joel Glassman and staff at the Center for International Studies, have developed the University of Missouri-St. Louis Tsunami Reconstruction Project. In its formation, Drs. Miller and Glassman had designed this project to set up to create and maintain three goals: * To develop a tangible long- term project in which the UMSL community could make a significant contribution to help build a sustainable future for children and communities affected by the tsunami; * To include UMSL students in the reconstruction effort, in order to foster their engaged global civic participation; * To develop long-term international exchange between UMSL and the educational community in Sri Lanka.http://www.umsl.edu/services/academic/assets/PDFs/Miller_Service_Award_07.pdf Contribution to feminist criminology In the foreword of the book One of the Guys, Dr. Malcolm W. Klein briefly discuss about Dr. Miller's contribution to feminist criminology in how female gangs are related to male gangs: > One can study male gangs without reference to their female constituents, but > only at a cost to a world that does, after all, contain two sexes. Anyone > can study female gangs or gang members‚Äîas many have done‚Äîwithout reference > to the male in their worlds. But the fault is the same, as is the loss. Dr. > Miller's research, clearly emphasizing the perspective of her female > respondents, makes it clear nonetheless that many of those perspectives are > affected by necessary accommodations to male gang members. There is a > serious attempt here, in the author's words, 'to expand feminist accounts of > female offenders by providing a nuanced portrayal of the complex gender > experiences of girls in gangs.'Miller, Jody. 2001. One of the Guys: Girls, > Gangs and Gender. New York: Oxford University Press. The quote from Klein illustrates how feminist advocates have been trying to answer why there is such a research gap between studies on male gangs and members compared to female gangs and members. There is little to no research about females in this category of feminist theory; Dr. Miller's research is an attempt to fill the empty research on female gangs and members. Her research is an attempt to get other feminist researchers to contribute to this area of research to help level the lack of research for female gangs and members with their male counterparts.

Dr. Dhallan received doctorates in medicine and biomedical engineering at The Johns Hopkins University as well as an MBA from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. The CEO and founder of the company held residency positions in oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital and in emergency medicine at York Hospital in York, PA before becoming an attending physician in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring, MD. Dr. Dhallan left his position at Holy Cross in 2000 in order to start his own company, Ravgen, with the pursuit of developing a safer prenatal diagnostic exam. At the time the only options available to patients were invasive with a chance of miscarriage or lacked in accuracy. Since its start in 2000, Ravgen has developed and patented a variety of safe, accurate prenatal diagnostic tests that simply require a blood draw from the mother. The company's core technology is based on its ability to increase the percentage of fetal DNA that is found in the maternal bloodstream, something that scientists have attempted to do for decades with little success. With this breakthrough in medicine, Ravgen is able to offer safe, noninvasive, pre- birth testing alternatives for expectant mothers and give them the knowledge they need to prepare for their pregnancies.

The Sac traditionally referred to themselves as \\"People of the Yellow Earth,\\" while the Foxes called themselves \\"Red Earth People.\\" In 1804 the tribes ceded their traditional homelands to the United States. The Sac and Fox Nation of Missouri was established by an 1815 treaty, and they relocated from Iowa and Illinois to northeastern Missouri. In 1824, they moved again to the Platte Valley. Sac leader, Black Hawk led his people in a war against the United States in 1832. An 1837 treaty relocated the tribe to the Great Nemaha Reservation in Doniphan and Brown counties in Kansas.\\"Kansas Tribes . . . Past & Present: Sac and Fox Nation of Missouri in Kansas and Nebraska\\" , The Brown Quarterly, 6,1. Retrieved April 13, 2010. After several treaties ceded more land, the Dawes Act broke tribal lands into individual allotments. In the 1880s, 360 members lived on the Sac and Fox Reservation, consisting of a 61.226 km¬≤ (23.639 sq mi) tract in southeastern Richardson County, Nebraska and northeastern Brown County, Kansas, near Falls City, Nebraska. The tribe organized in 1934 under the Indian Reorganization Act. The reservation had a resident population of 217 people at the 2000 census. During the period from the 1940s - 1960s, in which the Indian termination policy was enforced, four Kansas tribes, including the Sac and Fox Nation were targeted for termination. One of the first pieces of legislation enacted during this period was the Kansas Act of 1940 which transferred all jurisdiction for crimes committed on or against Indians from federal jurisdiction to the State of Kansas. It did not preclude the federal government from trying native people, but it allowed the state into an area of law in which had historically belonged only to the federal government. On 1 August 1953, the US Congress passed House Concurrent Resolution 108 which called for the immediate termination of the Flathead, Klamath, Menominee, Potawatomi, and Turtle Mountain Chippewa, as well as all tribes in the states of California, New York, Florida, and Texas. Termination of a tribe meant the immediate withdrawal of all federal aid, services, and protection, as well as the end of reservations.US Statutes at Large 67:B132 A memo issued by the Department of the Interior on 21 January 1954 clarified that the reference to \\"Potawatomi\\" in the Resolution meant the Potawatomi, the Kickapoo, the Sac and Fox Nation of Missouri in Kansas and Nebraska and the Iowa tribes in Kansas. Because jurisdiction over criminal matters had already been transferred to the State of Kansas by the passage of the Kansas Act of 1940 the government targeted the four tribes in Kansas for immediate termination. In February, 1954 joint hearings for the Kansas tribes were held by the House and Senate Subcommittees on Indian Affairs. The Prairie Band of Potawatomi Nation tribal leader, Minnie Evans (Indian name: Ke-waht-no-quah Wish- Ken-O)http://genealogytrails.com/kan/butler/1927potawatomiindians.htmlhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/96078296 led the effort to stop termination. Tribal members sent petitions of protest to the government and multiple delegations went to testify at congressional meetings in Washington, DC. Tribal Council members Vestana Cadue, Oliver Kahbeah, and Ralph Simon of the Kickapoo Tribe in Kansas traveled at their own expense to testify as well. The strong opposition from the Potawatomi and Kickapoo tribes helped them, as well as the Sac & Fox and the Iowa Tribe, avoid termination.

Up to number 5000, only a small group of Jupiter trojans and near-Earth asteroids remain unnamed: * * * * * * '''''' * *  Physical characteristics  ' is an assumed C-type asteroid. It has a V‚ÄìI color index of 0.85, slightly below that seen for most Jovian D-type asteroids (also seen table below).  Rotation period  A rotational lightcurve of ' was first obtained by Stefano Mottola in November 1991, using the Loiano 1.52-meter telescope at Bologna Observatory in Italy. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.46 magnitude (). In September 2012, it was also observed in the R-band by astronomers at the Palomar Transient Factory in California (). Since January 2015, several photometric observations by Robert Stephens at the Center for Solar System Studies in California confirmed Mottola's period determination from 1991, and measured a brightness amplitude of 0.50‚Äì0.53, which is indicative of a non-spherical, possibly elongated shape ().  Diameter and albedo  According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, ' measures between 62.10 and 65.93 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.060 and 0.079. It has not been observed by the Supplemental IRAS Minor Planet Survey. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for a carbonaceous asteroid of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 63.91 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.7.

He played college football for the University of Michigan from 1890 to 1893 and coached the University of Iowa football team in 1894. In late 1895, he was implicated in a series of articles by Caspar Whitney alleging that the schools of the Western Conference had been corrupted by \\"professionalism\\" involving the payment of money to athletes for their services in playing football. Sherman practiced law in Chicago, Illinois, and served as a master of chancery of the Superior Court and president of the Chicago Bar Association and Illinois State Bar Association. Biography=Early years Sherman was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1872 and attended Chicago's Hyde Park High School. He played two years of football for Hyde Park in the Cook County High School League. He was captain of a Hyde Park team that \\"was never defeated and won the pennant.\\" Michigan Sherman enrolled at the University of Michigan, where he played at the quarterback and end positions for the Michigan Wolverines football team in 1890, 1891 and 1893. At 5 feet, 7 inches, he was the shortest player on the Michigan team. In November 1891, the Chicago Daily Tribune wrote: \\"Sherman at quarter back, although not a swift passer, is cool-headed and is nearly always to be found near the ball.\\" Sherman cropped from the 1890 Michigan team photograph While attending the University of Michigan, Sherman was also a member of the school's banjo club. In April 1892, Sherman performed with Michigan's banjo and glee clubs at Chicago's Central Music Hall. At the time, the Chicago Daily Tribune reported: \\"Sherman is equally handy at football or at a banjo, but, as the former game is out of season, it is reasonable to suppose that his present efforts in Chicago will be confined to music.\\" Sherman completed five years' of study in four years, earning a bachelor's degree in 1894 while simultaneously completing the first year of law school. Iowa In 1894, Sherman was hired as the head football coach at the University of Iowa. One of Sherman's players, Michael L. McKinley, recalled: \\"In 1894 the athletic committee made arrangements with Roger Sherman, a famous Michigan end, to coach the team for the fall season.\\" Sherman coached the entire team at Iowa‚Äîline, ends and backs.McKinley, Playing the Game, p. 206. He led the Hawkeyes to a 4‚Äì4‚Äì1 record in his one year as head coach. Sherman from the 1891 Michigan team photograph 1895 recruiting scandal In the fall of 1895, Caspar Whitney wrote a series of articles in Harper's Weekly contending that \\"professionalism\\" had corrupted collegiate athletics among the Western Conference schools, including Wisconsin, Northwestern, Minnesota and Michigan. One of Whitney's accusations was that Sherman, who he described as \\"Michigan's manager,\\" had on October 6, 1895, while riding on a Chicago cable car, offered a Chicago Athletic Association player named Stevenson the sum of $600 to finish the season with the Michigan team. Sherman denied Whitney's charge in an interview with the Chicago Daily Tribune: > Stevenson had said he expected to go to Michigan to take a law course, and > it was naturally expected he would join the team. When the Michigan team > went into training at Omena early in the season, it was expected Stevenson > would join the team, and when it was learned he would play for the athletic > association Baird, the manager, wrote to me to see him and find out if he > was coming to Michigan. I went to the Athletic club to see him and met him > starting for a game at the Athletic Association field. I got on the car and > rode with him and had a talk with him. I wanted to know if he was going to > Michigan, as they had expected him. I made him no offer and held out no > inducements to him, as I had no authority to do so, even had I wanted to, > from Baird or any one else. Michigan supporters denied Whitney's charges and, as proof that Whitney's account was wild and unreliable, noted that he had erroneously identified Sherman as Michigan's manager. Whitney stood his ground and explained: > As to Stevenson, I have charged he was offered $600 by Roger Sherman, as > manager of the Michigan team, to play with that eleven. I erred in an > immaterial detail, which Michigan men have seized upon in order to dodge the > issue. They deny that he made such an offer, or that he was manager of the > eleven. The facts are as follows: Sherman managed the summer trip and > training of the team at Omena, a summer resort on Traverse Bay, Michigan. > Charles Baird was the regular manager, and was the one who originally > conducted the negotiations with Stevenson, which Sherman knew about and > talked over with Stevenson in the Chicago cable car Oct. 5, 1895. Mr. > Sherman admitted this to me before a witness in Chicago Dec. 17, 1895. Mr. > Sherman is a young lawyer of excellent repute and will not deny this > statement. Besides, Stevenson has admitted it. Later, Sherman responded by challenging the assertion that matters were purer in the East and with a pragmatic defense of professionalism as \\"an evil, but not an unmixed evil,\\" and \\"a bad means to a good end.\\" In an essay published by The Inlander, Sherman wrote: > In order to get the support of the college body and the public in general a > team must first win at almost any cost. Students will not support a losing > team be it ever so pure, nor will the public pay to see such a team play > ball. ... To declare for purity at the outset means a weak team and, as a > consequence, defeat and lack of support, moral and financial, for years to > come, maybe for ever. The power that a manager has to help men through > college, if judiciously exercised, is productive of a great deal of good. > Many of the best players are in the neediest of circumstances. It is only > right that they should be helped through college in return for their > sacrifices on the football field. ... The actual facts in this case are > these: The most successful teams in the country today have built up their > reputations and their successes by the judicious expenditure of money in > securing the services of good players. That nearly all of them cling to this > practice is well known to those who are in the possession of the true state > of facts. Legal career Sherman enrolled at the Northwestern University School of Law and received a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1895. He began the practice of law in Chicago with his father, Penoyer L. Sherman, a master in the chancery court. In 1897, he practiced law with two other attorneys in the firm of Church, McMurdy & Sherman. Sherman was active in politics in Chicago's Sixth Ward and was appointed master in chancery of the Superior Court in 1906. He served as a chancery master from 1906 to 1907 and as the Assistant State's Attorney in Chicago from 1907 to 1908. As of 1918, he was in private practice as one of three partners in the firm of Tenney, Harding & Sherman. He later served as the president of the Chicago Bar Association (1922‚Äì1923) and president of the Illinois State Bar Association (1923‚Äì1924). He continued in private practice for many years thereafter with the firm of Tenney, Sherman, Rogers & Guthrie. Later years In his later years, Sherman lived at 213 Linden Street in Winnetka, Illinois. He also had a winter home in Pompano Beach, Florida. In 1957, Sherman died at age 85 at his winter home in Pompano Beach. He was survived by his wife, the former Grace Buttolph, and two daughters, Mrs. Philip M. Watrous and Mrs. Robert K. Vincent.

It aired on April 29, 2010 on NBC. The series‚Äîpresented as if it were a real documentary‚Äîdepicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Pam and Jim work on their first sales pitch together to Donna, the manager of a local restaurant, but Michael keeps misreading the signals she's putting out. Dwight encourages Kelly to try out for the minority training program, but is forced to work against her after finding out her future plans after she is accepted into the program. \\"Body Language\\" has received positive reviews from critics and was viewed by 7.09 million viewers. Synopsis Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) work on their first sales pitch together to Donna (Amy Pietz), the manager of a local restaurant. Michael Scott (Steve Carell) employs several tactical dating and psychology moves to flirt with her, including juxtaposing pictures of himself with attractive people. He also gives Donna a Victoria's Secret catalog and flashes subliminal messages of the word \\"SEX\\" in his presentation. Throughout the day, he makes numerous unsuccessful attempts to kiss her. Michael discusses these attempts with the office workers, who largely interpret Donna as uninterested. Only Pam argues that she may have some interest, pointing out that Donna had opportunities to leave earlier in the day. At the end of the sales pitch, Donna leaves hurriedly, but remains in her car. Michael finds one of Donna's accessories in the office, giving him a pretext to chase after her. Though even Pam argues against it, Michael takes the opportunity and shares two kisses with Donna in the parking lot. He returns to the office and brags to the office workers, who are skeptical of his story. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) learns that Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) is interested in applying for the Sabre minority executive training program \\"Print in All Colors\\". He encourages Kelly (Mindy Kaling) to apply for the position, preferring that a \\"malleable simpleton who can be bought for a few fashion magazines\\" fill the role rather than a competent worker. Later, Kelly mentions to Dwight that she and Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) are planning to make Ryan the Scranton office manager once Kelly has assumed a position of authority, thus confounding Dwight's plans. Dwight attempts to sabotage the arrangement using racial semantics, uncovering that Indians are, in fact, Caucasians by definition. However, Gabe tells him that Darryl has decided not to apply as it would leave him no time for his softball league, leaving Kelly as the only applicant. Dwight turns to Stanley and Oscar, but they are both too scared of Kelly to compete with her for the position. In a last desperate attempt, he interrupts Kelly's interview to present Hide from the warehouse as a new applicant. Outraged by Dwight's betrayal, she storms out of the room. Kelly ultimately is accepted into the program. Though Dwight congratulates her, she promises revenge on him for introducing Hide as an applicant. Production Mindy Kaling who plays Kelly Kapoor on The Office marked her television directorial debut with this episode. It was written by Justin Spitzer, his second writing credit of the season after \\"Shareholder Meeting\\" and directed by Mindy Kaling, which marks her television directorial debut (she previously directed the \\"Subtle Sexuality\\" webisodes), she also portrays Kelly Kapoor on the series. The episode also features the second guest appearance of Amy Pietz as Donna (her first being in \\"Happy Hour\\") and Zach Woods as Gabe Lewis.

It is inscribed on the back \\"Lych Gate The Deserted Village\\" E.M.B. and includes four handwritten lines from the poem. This appears to be the earliest known example of her work; created when she was just 14 years old. Lakeview through the Trees (watercolor) Emily Mary Bibbens Warren (1869 ‚Äì 1956) was a British Canadian artist and illustrator. She worked in ink, watercolour, oil, gouache, and graphite. Her favourite subjects included gardens, landscape, and interiors and exteriors of buildings. She is known for sunlight beaming through stained glass windows. Early career Emily Warren instigated a successful movement to have John Ruskin's home, Brantwood, made into a museum. She lectured before Ruskin Societies. She took a course in architecture by Sir Bannister Fletcher. She graduated from the Royal College of Art, South Kensington in 1887 at the age of 18. In 1897 she received her Art Masters Certificate from that same college. She took certificates in biology, botany and geology. She moved to Canada in 1919 and lived in Ottawa, Ontario. She lived in Montreal, Quebec from 1928 to 1934. She died in Dunrobin, Ontario in 1956. Memberships She was a member of the Royal Society of British Artists, the Royal Watercolour Society, the Old Dudley Arts Society, the Aberdeen Society of Arts and the Society of Women Artists. She was a member of the Committee for Preservation of Memorials in London. Critical success National Gallery of Canada purchased her oil painting Placing the Canadian Colours on Wolfe's Monument in Westminster Abbey, an oil 19 √ó 37\\". In 1921 she was commissioned by Sir Robert Borden to come to Canada to complete two large canvasses 6'6\\" √ó 11'6\\", oil painting entitled Canada's Tribute, The Great War 1914‚Äì1919 and Placing the Canadian Colours on Wolfe's Monument in Westminster Abbey. The Canada Tribute paintings were initially hung in the Parliament Buildings but have been hung in the Sir Arthur Currie Memorial Hall of the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario since 1947. Final years She travelled and painted in British Columbia, Belgium, Scotland and France. She exhibited in England. She illustrated Homes and Haunts of John Ruskin by E.T. Cook. She gave lectures in Canada in the 1920s and 1930s illustrated by 1900 handcoloured glass slides reproducing her own paintings. Half of the 1900 slides are in the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library, University of Toronto, along with an extensive collection of correspondence, lecture notes, and biographical material. Two boxes of slides of drawings of individual generals' faces and of flags, preliminary drawings for her paintings, Canada's Tribute and Placing the Canadian Colours on Wolfe's Monument in Westminster Abbey, are in the Canadian War Museum, Ottawa. She held an annual sale of watercolours in Ottawa. There was a demand for her paintings of Canada, England and the continent of Europe. Illustrations for books * E.T.

Publicly traded corporations typically have an internal audit department, led by a chief audit executive (\\"CAE\\") who reports functionally to the audit committee of the board of directors, with administrative reporting to the chief executive officer. The profession is unregulated, though there are a number of international standard setting bodies, an example of which is the Institute of Internal Auditors (\\"IIA\\"). The IIA has established Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing and has over 150,000 members representing 165 countries, including approximately 65,000 Certified Internal Auditors. The CAE is intrinsically an independent function; otherwise it may become dysfunctional and of low quality (but there are many degrees in the level of independence and efficiency). The CAE function exists only to constitute a third-level of control in the organisation, which must be independent from the first-level control (the first-level layer belongs to the management of an organisation, who is responsible in the first instance for acting in compliance with the organisation‚Äôs rules) and consecutively second- level (which are the supporting units i.e. legal, HR, risk function, financial control etc.). An effective independence is the result of both an attitude of CAE, and of prerogatives/guarantees conceded by the organisation or given by the organisation‚Äôs principals (e.g., the board of directors or audit committee). Because the CAE understands risks and controls, company strategy and the regulatory environment the CAE may assume additional organizational responsibilities beyond traditional internal auditing. Independent attitude The CAE should be independent in the performance of his/her duties, so that he/she can carry out his/her work freely without admitting interference, and as objectively as possible. Independence permits him/her to render impartial and unbiased judgements, which are essential to the proper evaluation of management and controls. It also allows him/her to view the financial actions, procedures and decisions in a detached way. This may become of an importance when providing objective assurance about the internal control framework. Organizational independence To perform their role effectively, CAEs require organizational independence from management, to enable unrestricted evaluation of management activities and personnel. This can be analysed in the different points below: * (for a different analysis of independence, see organizational independence analysed by the IIA) All the elements below should be granted to the CAE in the basic rules of the organisation, or stated in the charter of audit approved by the audit committee and promulgated in the organization (IIA Standard 1110 Organizational Independence, and standard 1000C1). Independent function: no conflict of interest allowed Even though the CAE may be formally part of the management structure of the organisation (among the ‚Äúchief executives‚Äù), he/she does not participate in any management decision process or accept any responsibility in the execution of company activities. CAEs may advise management (must, when it is about compliance, risk management, internal controls...) and the board of directors (or similar oversight body) regarding how to better execute their responsibilities. But she/he remains independent of the activities observes or audits. Hierarchical independence The primary customer of internal audit activity is the entity charged with oversight of management's activities. This is typically the audit committee, a sub-committee of the board of directors. To provide hierarchical independence, most chief audit executives report to the chairperson of the audit committee as to the performance of his/her duties. The definition (and regular revision) of the scope of the function should be agreed between the CAE and the audit committee. The internal audit‚Äôs annual work plan, which for practical reasons must be discussed with the auditees, is subject to the approbation of the sole audit committee, board of directors, or other appropriate governing authority (IIA Standard 1110 Organizational Independence). The internal rules and practices of the directorate of internal audit (audit manual) are of the responsibility of the CAE. Independent status The independence of the CAE in the performance of his duties should be guaranteed in the staff rules. The audit committee should have sole competence for the final decision on appointment and dismissal of the CAE‚Äù, and for his remuneration, activity appraisal and career advancement. The CAE is liable to disciplinary action but only with the concurrence of the audit committee. This could happen if he/she is negligent in the performance of his duties. Independent communication right The CAE reports directly to the audit committee and the board. There should be a report from the CAE to each ordinary audit committee meeting and if deemed necessary to the board. Such reports should be addressed directly to the chairman of the audit committee with parallel copy to the director- general. However, the CAE in the performance of his daily work communicates and liaises with the director-general and the staff of the organisation. Independent budgeting Although CAEs and internal auditors are paid by the company, the human resource budget of the directorate of internal audit, in particular, should be protected from interference from the audited organisation. The typical risk is that the audit's budget subject to the approval of director of HR and of the DG is a source of potential interference or friendly pressure to self-limit the CAE‚Äôs critic exercise of an independent viewpoint. An appeal to the board, even expressly foreseen as part of the communication right of the CAE, is often ineffective on short-term imposed constraints, given the time constraints of the budget process. The best practice is that the audit committee's opinion is required on the CAE‚Äôs draft budget, well in advance of the normal budgeting process of the organisation. Access to information Information is of key importance to organize, prepare and perform internal audits. Independent auditors are generally granted full access to any and all information they require to discharge their responsibilities. Reasonable restrictions would be limited to things such as personal information in personnel records such as health information. Unduly restricted access to information is a major impediment to an independent auditor and indicates that an organization is not truly supportive of the auditor's mandate and its commitment to sound governance should be questioned. Typical duties=Status, strategy and organisation of the internal audit department * Ensure that the status (e.g. stipulated in an audit charter), strategy, resources of the internal audit department are aligned and are consistent with the organization's objectives and governance policy. * Establish appropriate policies and procedures to guide the internal audit function, and ensure the quality of the assurance services delivered. Management, supervision of the internal audit activity * Obtain (or manage the production of) a risk analysis; ** Ensure that the risk assessment is done at least annually; ** Establish risk-based audit plans to set out the priorities of the internal audit function, consistent with the organizational objectives. * Considers the input of senior management, senior departmental management, of the audit committee; * The internal audit plan usually addresses financial reporting and other fundamental controls, to be coordinated with the audit plan of the statutory auditor * Coordinate internal auditing activities and plans with other internal and external providers of assurance and consulting activities to ensure proper coverage and minimize duplication of effort. * Communicate plan of engagements and resource requirements for the internal audit function, including significant interim changes to the audit committee. This communication shall include the impact of resource limitations. *Ensure that internal audit resources are appropriate, sufficient and effectively deployed to achieve the internal audit plan approved by the audit committee or the board. Ensure that internal auditors have appropriate professional qualifications and skills, and opportunities for sufficient training and development to maintain and develop their internal auditing competence and to obtain Certified Internal Auditor certification. *Ensure the timely completion of internal auditing engagements. *Ensure that reports on internal auditing engagements are provided to the audit committee with a minimum of delay. *Provide an annual holistic opinion on the effectiveness and adequacy of risk management, control, and governance processes. Quality management The CAE is responsible for assuring that appropriate engagement supervision is provided. Supervision is a process begins with planning and continues throughout the examination, evaluation, communication, and follow-up phases of the engagement. *Develop and maintain a quality assurance and improvement program that covers all aspects of the internal audit function, and continuously monitor its effectiveness. *In collaboration with the audit committee, ensure that a practice inspection or other external review of the internal audit function is conducted at least every 3 years, by a qualified, independent external review team, and that the results of this external assessment are communicated to the audit committee. * Ensure that professional internal auditing standards are followed (e.g. IIA standards or local standards). NB: Generally accepted auditing standards and International Standards on Auditing are external audit standards. * Report at least annually to the audit committee on the internal audit function's conformance with professional internal auditing standards. Reporting of critical findings Inform the Audit Committee without delay of any issue of risk, control or management practice that may be of significance. The chief audit executive (CAE) reports the most critical issues to the audit committee quarterly, along with management's progress towards resolving them. Critical issues typically have a reasonable likelihood of causing substantial financial or reputational damage to the company. For particularly complex issues, the responsible manager may participate in the discussion. Such reporting is critical to ensure the function is respected, that the proper \\"tone at the top\\" exists in the organization, and to expedite resolution of such issues. It is a matter of considerable judgement to select appropriate issues for the audit committee's attention and to describe them in the proper context. Survey results Various consulting and public accounting firms perform research on audit committees, to provide benchmarking data.KPMG AC Survey 2007 Some results are identified below: *54% of committee members surveyed felt the audit committee was \\"very effective,\\" while 38% indicated \\"somewhat effective.\\" *Risk management, internal control, and accounting estimates and judgments were the top priority areas for 2007. *41% were \\"very satisfied\\" with the internal audit function, while 52% were \\"somewhat satisfied.\\" *Two- thirds felt the chief internal audit position was for a professional internal auditor, rather than as a \\"stepping stone\\" to other roles.

Kinder House, sometimes known as \\"The Headmaster's House\\"Headmaster's House - aucklandartgallery.govt.nz was built in 1857, commissioned by Bishop George Selwyn and designed by Frederick Thatcher, architect of many Anglican buildings in Auckland. The house is a Gothic-style, double-storey mansion built of grey volcanic stone quarried from nearby Mount Eden. The house was the residence of London-born John Kinder, a teacher, painter, photographer and reverend of the Church of England Grammar School, Parnell. He occupied the house with his wife and the six children of his brother Henry Kinder, who was murdered by John's sister-in-law and her lover. The house was opened to the public as a gallery in 1982.Kinder House - Grammar School At Parnell - Kinder.org.nz The house is also used for wedding receptions and other functions.

Early life and education Dhallan earned an M.D. and a Ph.D. in biomedical engineering at Johns Hopkins University, then began a residency in radiation oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital. Later, after deciding to found the startup firm Ravgen, he studied business at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, receiving an MBA in 2007. Career According to a 2007 CNN profile, after Dhallan had begun his residency and fathered two children, his wife suffered two miscarriages, which caused him to be ‚Äústruck by how little information was available to women who experienced complications during pregnancy....so he resolved to invent a better prenatal diagnostic exam.‚Äù Amniocentesis provides 100% accurate results, but has a one-in-200 risk of causing a miscarriage and cannot be carried out until 15 or 18 weeks into the pregnancy; existing non-invasive prenatal screenings, meanwhile, have low accuracy rates. As an alternative to these procedures, Dhallan developed and patented Rapid Analysis of Variations in the Genome, which involves drawing two tablespoons of blood from the expectant mother, isolating fetal DNA cells, and checking them for chromosome 21, the marker for Down syndrome. The method is 99% accurate and can be performed eight weeks into a pregnancy. In order to develop and exploit his procedure, Dhallan founded and incorporated the biotech startup firm RavGen. Meanwhile, he left oncology to do a residency in emergency medicine at York Hospital in York, Pennsylvania. He then became an attending physician in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring, Maryland. According to CNN, he discovered that ‚Äúthe emergency room turned out to be great training for the daily high-wire act of running a startup. 'You get perspective,' says Dhallan. 'Once you've dealt with life and death day in and day out, other problems seem trivial.' The ER also helped him develop strong leadership skills. 'If someone has been shot six times, everyone is looking at the physician's response,' Dhallan says. 'If I didn't look confident, then everyone would lose confidence.'‚Äù RavGen RavGen is based in Columbia, Maryland. Dhallan founded it in 2000 after raising $15 million for research and development. According to its website, it was founded ‚Äúwith the goal of changing the paradigm of prenatal diagnostics.‚Äù While the current paradigm focuses on Downs syndrome testing, ‚Äúthere are many other genetic conditions and reasons to offer patients prenatal diagnosis,‚Äù among them cystic fibrosis and sickle-cell anemia. Dhallan and his colleagues have developed ‚Äúsafe, noninvasive tests to expand upon the current options available to patients.‚Äù In an article for the Journal of the American Medical Association, ‚ÄúMethods to Increase the Percentage of Free Fetal DNA Recovered From the Maternal Circulation,‚Äù Dhallan and his colleagues maintained that ‚ÄúAn alternative to existing methods for prenatal diagnosis is to use fetal cells and fetal DNA that exist in the maternal circulation.‚Äù Dhallan's method of non-invasive prenatal testing was described in a 2007 article in The Lancet (Lancet. 2007; 369:474-81). ‚ÄúCurrently,‚Äù explained a Lancet press release, ‚Äúavailable tests for prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities‚Äîeg, trisomy 21, which causes Down‚Äôs syndrome‚Äîare limited by several factors. Screening tests, such as ultrasound, are non-invasive, but diagnosis requires further invasive testing. Invasive diagnostic tests, such as amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling, are associated with risks to the pregnancy.‚Äù Now, however, Dhallan and his colleagues had extracted fetal DNA from blood samples of pregnant women and examined them for chromosomal abnormalities ‚Äúby analysing an array of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, pronounced ‚Äúsnips‚Äù)‚Äîtiny variations in the DNA sequence of individuals. The researchers established the ratio of SNPs on different chromosomes, which enabled them to determine whether the fetus had chromosomal abnormalities. Of the 60 samples tested, the technique identified the number of chromosomes correctly in 58, including two cases of trisomy 21. Although one case of trisomy 21 was not identified, and one normal sample was incorrectly identified as being trisomy 21, the researchers stress that this is a preliminary study, and that further trials are needed to fine tune the technique.‚Äù The Lancet article was followed by a letter in which Dhallan replied to critics questioning the value of the procedure. The Washington Post and Los Angeles Times reported on Dhallan's innovation in February 2007. Ravgen has developed a new paternity test, described in a 2012 letter by Dhallan and several of his colleagues at Ravgen that was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM. 2012; 366:1743-1745). In the letter, entitled ‚ÄúA Non-Invasive Test to Determine Paternity in Pregnancy,‚Äù Dhallan and his team wrote that their ‚Äúapproach shows that noninvasive prenatal paternity testing can be performed within the first trimester with the use of a maternal blood sample.‚Äù A June 2012 New York Times article discussed Raygen's new paternity test, noting that it had been used to establish a motive in a 2008 murder case in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Another 2012 article quoted Dhallan as saying, ‚ÄúIt's not knowing who the father is that makes a pregnancy challenging and stressful for the mother....Knowing who the father is allows them to make informed decisions about their pregnancies. We've found it can be done very simply and eventually, inexpensively.‚Äù He added that ‚ÄúA quarter of women tell me straight up that my answer will impact whether they keep the pregnancy....By the time I did four cases, we had saved one baby.

A British ship of the line, HMS Swiftsure under Captain Benjamin Hallowell was passing westwards through the Southern Mediterranean near Cape Derna when it encountered a much larger French squadron under Contre-Amiral Honor√© Ganteaume that was also returning westwards after a failed attempt to reinforce the besieged French garrison in Egypt. Although Hallowell immediately recognised the danger his vessel was in and turned to flee, the French ships were much faster and soon closed with his ship. At 14:00, three French vessels were within long gunshot and Hallowell decided that his only hope of escape lay in disabling the three ships before the rest of the French squadron could join the engagement. Turning towards the enemy, Hallowell found that his sluggish ship was unable to respond rapidly to French manoeuvres and within two hours Swiftsure was surrounded. Threatened with complete destruction and unable to escape, the British captain surrendered. The action was a rare victory for the French in the Mediterranean Sea, which had been largely under British control since the French Mediterranean Fleet had been destroyed in 1798 at the Battle of the Nile. This had trapped the French army in Egypt on the African side of the Mediterranean, and all efforts to reinforce and resupply them had ended in failure, including three separate expeditions by Ganteaume's squadron. Swiftsure was later commissioned into the French Navy and fought at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, where the ship was recaptured by the British and rejoined the Royal Navy. Hallowell was subsequently court martialed for the loss of his ship, but was honourably acquitted and returned to naval service. Background On 1 August 1798, during the Battle of the Nile, a British fleet under Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson destroyed the French Mediterranean Fleet at Aboukir Bay on the Egyptian coast.Gardiner, p. 39 The battle completely reversed the strategic situation in the Mediterranean: British forces had evacuated the region in 1796 after the Treaty of San Ildefonso brought Spain into the war on the French side, but they were now able to return in large numbers. As French maritime lines of communication were cut, the French Arm√©e d'Orient under General Napoleon Bonaparte became trapped in Egypt. Unable to return to Europe by sea, the army attempted and failed to pass overland through Palestine and was subsequently abandoned by Bonaparte, who returned to France with his closest advisors in the frigates Muiron and Carr√®re in November 1799, promising to send reinforcements to the forces that remained in North Africa.Gardiner, p. 66 By 1801, the Arm√©e d'Orient was on the verge of collapse. No supplies or support had arrived from France, their commander Jean Baptiste Kl√©ber had been assassinated, and a British invasion was impending. Frustrated at his failure to assist his men in Egypt, Bonaparte ordered a squadron of ships of the line to sail from Brest in January 1801 under the command of Contre-Amiral Honor√© Ganteaume.James, p. 88 This force was instructed to sail to the Eastern Mediterranean and land over 5,000 troops at Alexandria. In February, Ganteaume's force reached Toulon, the admiral concerned that his ships would be outnumbered further east where the British expeditionary force was gathering. Bonaparte sent him back to sea to complete the operation but again he returned, driven back by bad weather and a patrolling British squadron off Sicily under Rear-Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren.James, p. 93 On 27 April Ganteaume made a third attempt to reach Egypt, and reached Benghazi before pressure from larger British forces under Admiral Lord Keith drove his squadron back westwards. On 24 June, Ganteaume's ships were retreating along the North African coast, passing close to Cape Derna.James, p. 94 Also in the region was the British 74-gun ship of the line HMS Swiftsure under Captain Benjamin Hallowell, a veteran of the Battle of the Nile three years earlier. Swiftsure was passing slowly along the North African coast after being detached from Keith's fleet to join Warren's squadron off Malta, escorting a small convoy en route. Hallowell's ship was understrength as more than 80 men had been removed from the ship for service in Egyptian waters and illness rendered another 59 unfit for duty, while the vessel itself was in a poor state of repair and leaking badly.Clowes, p. 453 Progress had been slow, and a northeasterly wind had also significantly delayed Hallowell's passage. When he learned from a passing vessel that there was a French squadron in the region, he ordered the convoy to separate and sailed for Malta alone in an effort to join Warren more rapidly and warn him of Ganteaume's return.Woodman, p. 159 At 03:30 on 24 June his lookouts sighted sails to the southwest. Hallowell immediately assumed that the distant ships were the enemy and he turned away from the French and tacked into the wind. By 05:30, lookouts on the nearest French ships, the ships of the line Jean Bart and Constitution had spotted the distant British vessel and were ordered to give chase. Battle The French ships followed Swiftsure by tacking into the wind and a complicated chase developed, with Jean Bart and Constitution maintaining the pressure on the slow moving British vessel, while the rest of Ganteaume's squadron used the prevailing wind to push far ahead of the ongoing chase before tacking at 08:00 across Hallowell's intended course. Unless Hallowell could escape the trap, his ship would be caught between the two French divisions and overwhelmed. For six hours Hallowell continued his efforts to escape, but the French ships were too fast, Ganteaume's force passing some distance ahead of the British ship and then turning back towards him so that by 14:00 Swiftsure was at serious risk of being surrounded. Hallowell determined that his only option was to attempt to drive through those ships of Ganteaume's division that blocked his passage to leeward, the ships of the line Indivisible (under Pierre-Paulin Gourr√®geQuintin, p.157) and Dix-Ao√ªt (under Louis-Marie Le GouardunQuintin, Dictionnaire des capitaines, p. 221) and the frigate Cr√©ole. At 15:00, with the detached division rapidly approaching from astern, Hallowell turned his ship towards the ships sailing ahead of Swiftsure and attempted to pass across the stern of the rearmost ship in an effort to rake and disable it, creating enough confusion to mask an escape. The manoeuvere was recognised by the French captains, and all three vessels turned to face the British ship as it approached. By 15:30 the ships of the line had opened a mutual fire, during which the faster French warships were able to easily outmanoeuvre the lumbering Swiftsure. At 16:37, after more than an hour of fruitless firing at long range, the arrival of Jean Bart and Constitution within gunshot convinced Hallowell that further resistance was hopeless and he struck his flag to signal his surrender. Swiftsure had taken significant damage to its masts, rigging and sails during the exchange of fire, a deliberate ploy by the French captains to limit the ship's movement and prevent its escape. This had minimised casualties on deck by distracting the gunfire, and as a result, only two men were killed and eight wounded, two of whom subsequently also died. French losses were more severe, with four casualties on Indivisible and six killed and 23 wounded on Dix-Ao√ªt, although neither ship was significantly damaged in the action.James, p. 95 Aftermath Ganteaume's fleet remained off the Cape Derna for the next six days, performing repairs to the captured vessel to make it seaworthy. Detachments of sailors were taken from all of the ships in the squadron and transferred to the prize, and on 30 June Ganteaume's force was ready to sail northwest once again, eventually reaching Toulon without further incident on 22 July. Ganteaume used the capture of Swiftsure to excuse the failure of his effort to reinforce Egypt, which was invaded and captured by a British expeditionary force in the spring and summer of 1801.Gardiner, p. 83 While in captivity, Hallowell wrote a letter that was published in Britain praising the treatment he and his men had received while prisoners of war under Ganteaume, and he and his officers were released on parole the following month. On 18 August they faced a court martial on board HMS Genereux at Port Mahon in Menorca to investigate the loss of their ship, and were all honourably cleared of any blame. He was also praised for detaching the convoy, which otherwise might have also been lost. Hallowell subsequently returned to naval service in 1803 at the start the Napoleonic Wars, operating in the Caribbean and Mediterranean and eventually becoming a rear-admiral in 1811. Swiftsure, one of only five British ships of the line to be captured by the French during the entire war, was subsequently commissioned into the French Navy and remained in service for the next four years until recaptured at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.

Her research and teaching concerns feminism and criminology. Brockman holds a Bachelor of Arts degree with Honours from the University of Saskatchewan, a Master of Arts from the University of Alberta, and took her L.L.B at the University of Calgary and her L.L.M at the University of British Columbia. She is a member of the Law Society of British Columbia and of the Law Society of Alberta. She is an advocate for gender equality within the legal profession.https://www.sfu.ca/~brockman/ Contributions to feminist criminology Brockman has argued that gender equality is developing only slowly within the field of law, and that more can be done to eliminate gender inequality in this area. She has advised societies on methods for improving gender equality, including code of conduct amendments relating to sexual harassment, clauses regarding parental leave, workplace accommodation and professional development. Brockman won the 2008 CBA Cecilia Johnstone Award. Veronica Jackson, National Chair of the CBA Women Lawyers forum, was quoted of saying on the occasion \\"It is impossible to enter a serious discussion about the advancement of women in the legal profession without mentioning Joan Brockman. She has demonstrated exceptional leadership in this area through her scholarship, her policy related work, and her teaching and mentorship ... her career has directly supported the advancement of women lawyers and encouraged the retention of women lawyers in the profession\\". Research and teaching interests Brockman's research interests include women in the legal professions, feminist jurisprudence, methodology, and perspectives, as well as white collar crime, corporate financial crimes and misconduct, wrongful convictions, the sociology of professions, and criminal law, procedure and evidence. Brockman currently teaches on criminal procedure and evidence, wrongful convictions, gender in the courts and the legal profession, and corporate and professional financial crimes and misconduct.https://www.sfu.ca/~brockman/ Major works=Feminist Perspectives for the study of Gender Bias in the Legal Profession Brockman, Evans and Reid examine gender bias within the legal profession in this article and they acknowledge that there is gender discrimination that does exist and that this is important however with this acknowledgment must come a proposed solution to the problem. This solution must advocate real changes to be implemented within the system in order to better the advancement of women within law. The authors conclude that in order to actually eliminate or minimize gender bias within the courts to some degree the studies surrounding the issues should be broad enough as to follow the three characteristics that Sandra Harding maintains is essential to feminist research. The first characteristic of feminist research maintains that it should ask real women questions about their experiences to uncover what they deem as genuine concerns instead of what is assumed to be their concerns. The second characteristic is that the data that is collected from these questions from women should directly result in research that is designed for women and the third characteristic says that gender should be investigated from the bottom up in the sense that those without the power should be the ones to analyze those in a position of power who are contributing to gender bias. The authors also draw on Sandra Harding's work when examining how gender produces itself in different ways, which she categorizes as three important levels. The first is gender symbolism, which refers to how traits are associated with gender according to how they are perceived traditionally and how traits associated with the male gender are often valued more than the traits traditionally associated with the female gender. The example of men who reason vs women who use emotion was offered in explaining gender symbolism. The second characteristic involved in how gender produces itself is gender structure, and this simply refers to when actual weight is given to the gender symbolism, so when something is done differently according to the traits associated with gender, and example of this is how men worked in the public sphere and women in the private sphere because those were the traits associated with each gender. The third level in which gender is produced is the socially constructed image of how males and females are portrayed for example in the media. Having analyzed and acknowledged the ways in which gender bias does exist, the authors look for answers surrounding how to eliminate gender bias within the legal profession. The question they address relates to women being important to law and having made an impact on the profession so when will the system change to accommodate them rather than letting normal life events like having children be a disadvantage for them? Even though the structural barriers have been removed, and women are allowed to participate within the legal system the invisible barriers remain as well as the question, to fit in or break the mould?Brockman, Joan, Denise Evans and Kerri Reid (1992). Feminist Perspectives For the Study of Gender Bias in the Legal Profession. 5(1) Canadian Journal of Women and the Law 37-62. Gender in the Legal Profession: Fitting or Breaking the Mould The introduction chapter looks at a historical perspective and women were excluded from the legal profession in the past as well as other groups of people such as Aboriginal people, and the underprivileged. The legal profession began as one that was dominated by middle to upper class English men and a great deal of pressure was required to allow these excluded groups to have equal opportunity to participate within the legal system. Women didn't account for 40% of students in law programs until 1983 and even once the structural barriers had been removed it was not without resistance from males. Brockman draws on Fiona Kay's work and her studies on women lawyers in Ontario that discovered that women exit the law profession 60% faster than men leave the profession. The foundation for the entire book rests on the interviews that Brockman did with 50 men and 50 women that had been called to the bar in British Columbia. The interviews referred to her four main interests surrounding the project which included career advancement, the conciliatory-adversarial way of practicing law, gender bias, discrimination and sexual harassment and how they balance roles of careers children and chores. Chapter 2 is where Brockman gets at the reasons why the participants went to law school in the first place and the things that they like or don't like about practicing law. 32% of the men and 38% women went into law because they were genuinely interested in pursuing law as a profession and had always felt that way and 34% of men and 34% of women went to law school simply because they were not sure what else to do, it was an unplanned choice. 10% of men and 10% of women went to law school to help society, and 14% of women and 6% of men went to challenge themselves. When it comes to financial security 10% of women went into law for this reason and 18% of men. Overall the reasons cited by men and women for entering the legal profession were quite similar. Chapter 3 looks at the participants educational backgrounds their previous employment history and what they aspire to be in the future. Men and women's experiences of educational history were found to be quite similar however Brockman did discover that women were the most likely to be work within family law. As far as career advancement plans, 30% of women and 24% of men anticipated being a judge as a future career. After examining the details of the participants Chapter 4 comes into the topic of gender and analyzes to what extent the participants experienced discrimination or sexual harassment within the legal profession. This section of the text looks at how while women and men may be similar in their reasons for wanting to practice law but that the real difference is the things they experience once they are in law and the barrier to women are discrimination and sexual harassment. This assumption is supported by the number of studies that show how high of a percentage of women actually experience sexual discrimination, for example 92% of women compared to 12% of men in Saskatchewan, and 70% of Ontario women lawyers compared with 6% of male Ontario lawyers. In Brockman's study she found that 60% of women had experienced some kind of discrimination and even more alarming is that 88% of women and 66% of men thought that discrimination against women was a factor limiting the advancement of their career. Chapter 5 is where the participants describe how they see themselves and whether they fall under the category of trying to work with the system or whether they are on the side combatting the system, Brockman found that only 12% of women and 14% of men worked near the adversarial end of the continuum. 62% of women 54% of men fall under the conciliatory end of things meaning they attempt to work with the system and the study found that most felt they worked this way because it was more beneficial when settling arguments between parties who needed to remain in some form of a relationship. Chapter 6 looks at how legal professionals, specifically women struggle with balancing the roles of lawyer, wife, mother and maid. Brockman claims that within the data collected marriage seems to present women with disadvantages in the professional workforce as she found that 7 females and 6 males said that being a lawyer was a factor in their decision to remain single. She also claims that having children is a decision that as a woman, is heavily influenced by their profession within the legal system. With respect to chores, she claims that women experience a double shift in their life, they go to work and they come home and do household chores as 60-76% of chores fall on the women‚Äôs list of responsibilities. Brockman's main claim is that the ultimate barrier to women in law is the balancing of these activities and the hours that they work and it is that which keeps women from being able to compete with equal opportunity against men in law. Chapter 7 looks the question of fitting or breaking the mould and what is needed in order to achieve and maintain gender equality within the legal profession. One solution Brockman offers refers to the economics of employment and how perhaps sharing the workload would relieve the healthcare system and make the experience of law easier on those who participate and deal with the current barriers. She concludes that while 'accommodations' have been made for women in law, a complete restructuring of the way the old family mould is portrayed is necessary in order for the mould of the legal system to give equal opportunity to women.Brockman, Joan.

The term \\"concubine\\" has many definitions, referring to any illicit lasting relationship with an unmarried woman, or an \\"unmarried wife\\", or an extra- marital partner to a married man. Much of the political debate has tried to first define the term being used, followed by the legal arguments setting out its place in society. History In New France, the institution of common-law or informal unions between French men and aboriginal women (known as marriages according to the ways of the land) had an ambiguous legal status. The practice was generally regarded by colonial authorities and the Church as a form of concubinage. Individual cases Often the issue of concubinage has appeared in insurance law, when the mistress of an apparent extramarital affair has laid claim, typically as a commonlaw spouse, to the estate of a man who has a legally-wedded wife, or no wife at all.Canada Department of Insurance, Report of the Superintendent of Insurance of the Dominion of Canada, 1943. p. x Monogamous concubinage Concubines in Canada were traditionally native women who were not believed suitable to become full wives to the European settlers. Elizabeth \\"Molly\\" Brant, the sister of the famed native chief Joseph Brant is believed to have served as the concubine to Sir William Johnson;\\"Review of Historical Publications Relating to Canada\\", Volumes 3-4. 1899. page 82 although his sexual promiscuity was widely known. In July 1867, controversy broke out over the case of Connolly v. Woolrych, wherein a Canadian working for the North West Company had taken a 15-year-old native wife and lived with her for 28 years, before leaving her to partake in a traditional Christian marriage ceremony with his cousin, Miss Woolrich, with whom he lived another 17 years. After the death of Connolly and his \\"concubine\\" Suzanne, one her many children sued for the right to his estate claiming that the second marriage was invalid and seeking to \\"vindicate his mother's name from the stain of concubinage\\", while his proper wife argued that he had never been married to Suzanne.Kirby, James. \\"The Canada Law Journal\\", Volume 3, 1867 The court noted that Suzanne and Connolly had omitted the traditional words \\"legitimate marriage\\" from the baptism of their children by Fr. Turcotte, instead asking him just to refer to their parenthood, but not to any marriage. The court ultimately found that the territory in which he lived with Suzanne had been under native self-rule and therefore not bound to English law and proper registration of marriage would not have been necessary to establish a marriage, but that the native tribes had no marriage ceremonies, and the couple appeared to have \\"lived exactly as Christian man and wife, and not as a Christian living with a barbarian concubine\\", making pointed reference to the fact that Suzanne had entered a convent after Connolly's \\"act of selfish cruelty\\" in abandoning their relationship, and was subsequently sent regular stipends for support by Connolly and his wife. Under the Revised Statutes of British Columbia, it was legal under the Administration Act, Cap. 5 for a resident of British Columbia to \\"support his concubine\\".Law Society of British Columbia, \\"The British Columbia Reports: Being Reports of Cases\\", 1946. Volume 61. Page 9 Since the Canadian military forbade enlisted members from marrying during their service in World War I, individual cases like that of Sgt. W. H. Sharpe roused public sentiment. Sharpe had listed Alma Freed as his wife when he enlisted, yet a year later in 1916 held a marriage ceremony with her after she gave birth to a son.

He has worked with Lenine, Nan√° Vasconcelos, Chuck Silverman, Manu Katch√©, and Jonathan Mover. He was a member of Mallavoodoo, BPM Trio, and Mandinga. Biography Ebel Perrelli started playing drums when he was teenager in a school band. His first studies were based on Stick control method, by George Lawrence Stone. He continued his studies in the Conservat√≥rio Pernambucano de M√∫sica and in 1993 he graduated from the Musicians Institute of London, after completing the One Year Diploma Course. He then became a teacher in the same conservatory where he studied and started his musical career, playing with many artists and bands of Pernambuco. In 1996, Perrelli joined the band Mallavoodoo with Thales Silveira (bass), M√°rio Lobo (keyboards and saxophone), and Alexandre Bicudo (guitar). With them, he did many shows around Pernambuco and recorded an album in 2001 named O inverno e a gar√ßa. In 1998, Perrelli participated in Zildjian Day Recife, playing with Manu Katche. One year later he won IV Batuka Music Festival in Best Improvisation category. In 2000, he recorded his only solo album, named Portal, which is considered a landmark for instrumental music in Pernambuco, since it was the first independent album recorded by a non-vocal instrumentalist in that state. In 2001, he joined the group Anynote Jazz Quartet, with Fred Andrade (guitar), Sidor Hulak (guitar), and H√©lio Silva (bass), which attracted many music students during its shows. In 2002, also with Andrade, he started a musical project, with the objective of combining rock and Brazilian rhythms. It was called Projeto Mandinga and lasted some months. During this period, Perrelli and Andrade did many shows in Brazil and recorded an album. In 2004, Perrelli played with the singer Nando Cordel, accompanying him during his tours for some years. Parallel to this work, he also created the instrumental band BPM Trio around 2006, which counted on Luciano Magno (guitar) and Nando Barreto (bass). The name of the band was created with the initials of the second name of each musician: Barreto, Perrelli and Magno. However, it can be interpreted as 'beats per minute'. The band rescued some ideas created by Quarteto Novo: create a Brazilian instrumental music from Brazilian rhythms, like bai√£o and xote. In fact, they were positively criticized by experts and played with Heraldo do Monte, one of the member of the group which inspired them. During his career, Perrelli worked with Luciano Magno, Beto Kaiser, Aratanha Azul, and Sa Grama. He is a member of the group Cascabulho, which was nominated for Latin Grammy in 2004. He also teaches in the Conservat√≥rio Pernambucano de M√∫sica and organizes many shows and workshops around Brazil and the world, spreading Brazilian rhythms and their applications in contemporary music.

It is said that the Portuguese called Akbar the Grand Mughal and sent Jesuit missionaries to convert him to Catholicism. The Mughal empire was romanticized in Europe, particularly from the sixteenth century onward. The empire's court at Agra, for instance, was often described in glowing terms. An account stated that it is not uncommon for Britons living in India to adopt the Mughal culture. The Mughal rule persisted until the mid-nineteenth century, ending in 1737 with the death of the sixth Mughal emperor, Aurangzeb (an account also cited Nadir Shah's invasion as the cause of the empire's demise).
