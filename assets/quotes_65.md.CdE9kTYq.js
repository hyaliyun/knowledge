Career Drafted in the 20th round of the 1967 amateur draft out of the University of Arizona by the Indians, Paul had success in the minors and in less than two years was in a big league uniform. In 1967, he spent time with the Reno Silver Sox and Portland Beavers. With the Silver Sox, he went 3‚Äì2 with a 1.63 ERA. In 72 innings (nine games), he struck out 103 batters. He didn't do as well with the Beavers, going 2‚Äì4 with a 3.94 ERA with them. However, he did strikeout 37 batters in 32 innings of work. Overall, Paul went 5‚Äì6 with a 2.34 ERA. He struck out 140 batters in 104 innings of work (18 games). Paul again pitched for Reno in 1968, going 2‚Äì1 with a 1.09 ERA and 49 strikeouts in four games (33 innings). He was called up to the major leagues and on May 27, he made his big league debut. He performed well in his first appearances, going 2 innings, striking out four (including the first batter he faced, Frank Kostro), allowing only one hit and earning the save. Overall, Paul went 5‚Äì8 with a 3.93 ERA in 91 innings of work in his rookie season. He allowed only 72 hits in 36 games (seven starts) and he walked 35 batters. Despite posting a 3.61 ERA for the 62‚Äì99 Indians in 1969, his record was only 5‚Äì10. In 47 games (12 starts), he struck out 98 batters. He went only 2‚Äì8 with a 4.81 ERA in 30 games (15 starts) in 1970. His performance was so unimpressive in fact that he spent 10 games in the minors with the Wichita Aeros, with whom he went 6‚Äì1 with a 2.15 ERA in 71 innings of work. In 1971, he went only 2‚Äì7 with a 5.95 ERA in 17 games (12 starts), and he again spent time with Wichita, going 6‚Äì7 with a 4.37 ERA in 17 games (107 innings). On December 2, 1971, Paul was traded with Roy Foster, Rich Hand and Ken Suarez to the Rangers for Del Unser, Denny Riddleberger, Terry Ley and Gary Jones. Paul had the best year of his career with Texas in 1972, going 8‚Äì9 with a 2.17 ERA in 49 games (20 starts). In 161 innings, he allowed only 149 hits, and he struck out 108 batters. His 2.17 ERA was sixth best in the league, and his 139 Adjusted ERA+ was sixth best as well. He began the 1973 season with the Rangers, going 5‚Äì4 with a 4.95 ERA in 36 games (10 starts). On August 31, he was sent to the Cubs for a player to be named later, which ended up being Larry Gura. He made 11 appearances (one start) for the Cubs that year, going 0‚Äì1 with a 3.44 ERA. Overall, Paul went 5‚Äì5 with a 4.68 ERA in 1973. 1974 would end up being Paul's final season in the major leagues. He appeared in only two games, allowing four earned runs in 1 innings of work for a 27.00 ERA. He played his final game on April 16, against the Pittsburgh Pirates. After being released by the Cubs, Paul played in the Mexican League until 1982. In his major league career, Paul went 27‚Äì48 with a 3.91 ERA in 228 appearances (77 starts). In 627 innings, he walked 246 batters and struck out 452. As a batter, Paul hit .115 in 148 at-bats.

The referendum on this issue was triggered when the Government of Latvia voted against an opposition motion to adopt this change to the constitution, which resulted in a referendum in Latvia by law. President Valdis Zatlers and the left-wing opposition were in favour of the referendum, while the government was against it, arguing that it would cause even more instability in a country which has seen 13 governments in the 18 years since independence. At least half of the total registered electorate (i.e. more than 757,607) had to approve the referendum proposal in order for it to be valid.http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/223093,latvians-vote-in-a-poll- on-power-to-dissolve-parliament.html Preliminary results indicated that an overwhelming 96% of voters had voted in favour of the amendment, although only about 40% of the electorate voted in favour, which means the referendum is invalid.http://www.focus-fen.net/index.php?id=n148184 It is expected that the strong result, while failing to directly change the constitution, might press politicians to adopt a similar measure nonetheless. If passed, the amendment would have represented the first time in an EU country that voters would have been able to dissolve their national parliament - a right traditionally reserved for the head of state. Background The moves to initiate the referendum began in Autumn 2007 at a time of public discontent with the government which had led to the largest street protests to date in the post- Soviet era. The movement to organise the referendum was led by the Free Trade Union Confederation of Latvia. The referendum also took place at a time of poor economic indicators with inflation exceeding 17 percent and economic growth expected to fall to near zero. Procedure for calling a referendum Under the ‚ÄòLatvian Law on National Referendums and Legislative Initiatives‚Äô, the procedure on calling popular referendums has several stages. The first stage involves the collection of 10,000 signatures certified by notaries, which are then presented to the Latvian Central Election Commission (CEC). Following positive verification of these signatures, the Latvian Government must then provide facilities for signature gathering in every town and village in the country, to enable the population to sign in favour of a proposal for a referendum. In order to be successful, more than one-tenth of citizens eligible to vote in the previous parliamentary elections must sign in favour. Again, the signatures are verified by the CEC. If the 10% threshold is met, then the draft amendments are presented to the president who submits them to parliament for approval. If two thirds of MPs approve the changes at a sitting in which at least two thirds of the parliament is present then the changes are passed into law without the need for a referendum. If parliament rejects the laws, then a referendum is held. Collection of signatures In the event, 11,095 signatures were initially collected and positively verified. Collection of further signatures then took place from March 12 to April 10, 2008 in 660 designated places, of which 40 were abroad. In total, counting the initial signatures, 217,567 voters supported the introduction of the draft amendments. A further 6,814 signatures were disqualified. In the vast majority of cases this was due to citizens signing more than once. However, 35 were disqualified due to not being Latvian citizens, 22 on the grounds of insanity, 62 who were deceased or could not be identified and 1 person who was under the age of 18 upon signing. As the total number of valid signatures represented 14.6% of the electorate, the amendments were duly presented by the president to parliament, which rejected them on 5 June 2008. Accordingly, under the terms of the referendum law, a referendum had to be held not earlier than one month and not later than two months after rejection. Referendum campaign=\\"No\\" campaign Opposing the referendum, Prime Minister Ivars Godmanis pointed out that political instability had also been a feature of pre-Soviet Latvia. He also argued that ‚ÄúElecting the parliament is a creative process, while a referendum would be a destructive process without any result.\\" English translation of above 30 July Diena article Parliamentary speaker Gundars Daudze argued that such referendums could create a huge crisis with neither parliament nor president operating. Meanwhile, the head of the People's Party in parliament, MƒÅris Kuƒçinskis, stated his belief that such referendums would allow a small number of people to change the election results. The advertisements of the no campaign also played on fears of Russian influence, with one advertisement, illustrated by pictures of ethnic Russian politicians from the opposition left wing parties playing a balalaika in a sauna, declaring ‚ÄúIf you vote tomorrow, then you, brother, are crazy. In our places, the Russians will come. The Russians will come.‚Äù Diena newspaper, 1 August 2008 \\"Yes\\" campaign Former Prime Minister Einars Rep≈°e, a member of the opposition New Era party, argued that a yes vote of the majority of the electorate would be in accordance with basic democratic principles and that many contemporary Latvian politicians were working not for the state interest but for the interest of ‚ÄúGodfathers.‚Äù Civic Union party leader Sandra Kalniete also called for a yes vote on the grounds that the amendments could force MPs ‚Äúto finally listen to the will of their voters.‚Äù For Human Rights in United Latvia MP Juris Sokolovskis supported a yes vote on the basis of perceived alienation of the electorate from their MPs and on the grounds that, even if the 50% quorum was not reached, a large yes majority would still be difficult for politicians to ignore. ResultsReactions Following the anticipated large yes vote, President Valdis Zatlers said the support shown was strong enough to prompt Parliament to adopt similar amendments on its own. \\"The rights of the people to dissolve the Parliament have to be included in the Constitution as soon as possible,\\" Zatlers was quoted as saying by local news agency BNS. \\"If 40% want that, the duty of the Parliament is making it possible.\\" References Category:2008 elections in Europe Category:2008 in Latvia Category:2008 referendums Category:Constitutional amendments Category:Referendums in Latvia Category:Constitutional referendums ","title":"2008 Latvian constitutional referendum"},{"id":"18695237","text":"Ottawa Hydro Electric Substation No. 4 Hydro Ottawa is a regulated electricity distribution company operating in the City of Ottawa and the Village of Casselman in Ontario, Canada. As the third-largest municipally owned electrical utility in Ontario, Hydro Ottawa maintains the electricity distribution systems in the province, and serves over 335,000 residential and commercial customers across a service area of 1,100 square kilometres.Hydro Ottawa - History Hydro Ottawa was formed in November 2000 from the amalgamation of five local distribution companies (Gloucester Hydro, Goulbourn Hydro, Kanata Hydro, Nepean Hydro and Ottawa Hydro). The history of the supply of electricity began in the 1880s with private electrical suppliers, became public in the early 1900s and continued in competition with private suppliers, chiefly those of Thomas Ahearn and his companies, until the 1950s. Russell House Hotel (Ottawa's foremost hotel at the time) located at the corner of Sparks Street and Elgin Street In 1882, Electric lighting in Ottawa started in at Young's mill in Lebreton Flats (the previous year had seen Eddy's mill lit by electricity, on the Hull side). A year later, the House of Commons and the Senate were illuminated. The first electric street lighting in Canada occurred on Victoria Day, 1884 when the Peterborough Light and Power Company lit 17 arc lights on George Street in Peterborough Ontario.Jones, Elwood and Bruce Dyer, Peterborough the Electric City, Windsor Publications, Ltd., Burlington Ontario, 1987. pg 49 In 1885, the Royal Electric Company (of Montreal, formed in 1884)Ottawa Citizen - Mar 13, 1928 set up street lighting systems in Charlottetown and St. John's, Newfoundland. Ottawa had originally intended on using this company to light the city's streets, however, council contracted Ottawa Electric Light Company (formed 1884) to install 165 arc lamps on the city's streets. That company, which had as a director one of its founders Francis Clemow, along with founder lumber baron G. B. Pattee, had built a power station which used a water-powered generator. In May 1885, the streets of Ottawa were lit by electricity. In 1887, the Chaudi√®re Electric Light and Power Company was formed by Thomas Ahearn, a local man and partner of Ahearn & Soper, formed in the early 1880s. In 1890, there were two electrical providers, (Clemow's) Ottawa Electric Light Company, and Ahearn's company, Chaudi√®re Electric Light and Power Company. In 1894 Ahearn merged Ottawa Electric Light Company, and Chaudi√®re Electric Light and Power Company, and bought out Standard Electric Company of Ottawa (Limited) in the process, naming it Ottawa Electric Company, creating a virtual monopoly on electrical services in Ottawa. (Erskine Henry Bronson played a role in the development of this company). The following decades would see a continuous struggle between the City of Ottawa and Thomas Ahearn regarding the supplying of electricity to the city. In 1899 (possibly 1901), a charter was granted by the city to Consumers Electric, a rival company to Ahearn's Ottawa Electric Company. In 1905, The City purchased Consumers Electric for $200,000, ending Ahearn's ongoing attempts at acquiring the company. They renamed it \\"Municipal Electric Department\\" which was the city's public electricity provider. In 1908 Ahearn & Soper bought the Ottawa Gas Company, and with the Ottawa Electric Company formed the Ottawa Light, Heat and Power Company Limited. This parent holding company wholly owned the two previous companies and would refer to Ottawa Electric as its \\"Ottawa Electric division\\" well into the new century. This meant that there were no longer outside shareholders to Ottawa Electric, but there were shareholders to Ottawa Light, Heat and Power Company. In 1915 the \\"Municipal Electric Department\\" became Ottawa Hydro; named as the \\"Ottawa Hydro Electric Commission\\", when it joined forces with the provincial network of the Ontario Hydro Electric Commission. In 1920 Ottawa Light, Heat and Power Company Limited acquired the assets of The Ottawa Power Company, Limited which included the power plant at Victoria Island (Ottawa River) erected in 1900.The Toronto World - Nov 1, 1920 In 1950 Ottawa Hydro acquired the \\"Ottawa Light, Heat and Power Company, Limited\\", removing the last private sector competitor. Hydro Ottawa was formed in 2000 when five municipal local distribution companies were merged: Gloucester Hydro, Goulbourn Hydro, Kanata Hydro, Nepean Hydro and Ottawa Hydro. In May 2002, Casselman Hydro also became a part of Hydro Ottawa. Ottawa Hydro Electric Company Building - 109 Bank Street The building at Bank Street Ottawa Hydro Electric Company Building (Bridgehead at street level) is a Heritage building in Ottawa located at 109 Bank Street, on the south-east corner of Albert Street. It was designated as under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act in 1992. It commissioned W. C. Beattie to design this Art Deco style office building in 1934. It was Ottawa Hydro's headquarters until 1957. Current services Hydro Ottawa provides electricity supply to its customers, by taking electricity from the provincial grid and distributing it to homes and businesses.

Its name derives from the four kings descended in a patrilineal line from King Ferdinand II of Portugal (of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koh√°ry) and in a matrilineal line from Queen Maria II of Portugal (of the House of Braganza). The designation Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha is prevalent mainly in the writings of non-Portuguese historians and genealogists, as European custom classifies a descendant branch on the basis of patrilineal descent, which means that the House of Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha is a cadet branch of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koh√°ry. Nonetheless, the 1838 Portuguese constitution stated that the House of Braganza was the ruling house of Portugal, by way of Queen Maria II, and her descendants still continued to style themselves as members of the House of Braganza, as opposed to Saxe- Coburg-Braganza.CONSTITUI√á√ÉO POLITICA DA MONARCHIA PORTUGUEZA p. Title 1, Chapter 1, Article 5. With the death of King Manuel II without legitimate issue in 1932, the dynasty became extinct. History The royal house was founded by Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, who on 9 April 1836 married Queen Maria II of Portugal. Members of the royal house held the Portuguese title of Infante/Infanta of Portugal, as well as the German titles of Prince/ss of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Duke/Duchess of Saxony. On 15 November 1853, Queen Maria II died, and her eldest son succeeded to the throne as Pedro V, the first king of the Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha dynasty. The dynasty remained on the throne until the outbreak in Portugal of the 5 October 1910 revolution when King Manuel II of Portugal was deposed and the Portuguese First Republic was established. Manuel II went into exile in Fulwell Park, England, where he died on 2 July 1932. Modern claims Before his death in 1932, King Manuel II had been in negotiations with the rival Miguelist branch of the House of Braganza, who had claimed the Portuguese throne since 1834, in opposition to the Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha dynasty. On the King's death, the claim to the defunct throne of Portugal passed to Duarte Nuno of Braganza.

The book features a poem by Cendrars about a journey through Russia on the Trans-Siberian Express in 1905, during the first Russian Revolution, interlaced with an almost- abstract pochoir print by Delaunay-Terk. The work, published in 1913, is considered a milestone in the evolution of artist's booksThe Century of Artists' Books, Drucker, Granary, 1994, p50 as well as modernist poetryJames Sallis, Boston Globe and abstract art. The publisher of a 2008 reprint of the book has called it \\"one of the most beautiful books ever created\\".Yale University Press Cendrars himself referred to the work as ‚Äòa sad poem printed on sunlight‚Äô.Quoted in Prose du Transsib√©rien, Chris Michaelides, British Library Podcast transcribed Cendrars and the New Man Press Blaise Cendrars was the nom-de-plume for Fr√©deric Louis Sauser, a play on Braise (ember) and Cendres (ash); 'writing is being burned alive, but it also means being reborn from the ashes'.Quoted in Koninklijke Bibliotheek, Netherlands Online Born in Switzerland, at 15 he had run away from home to train as an apprentice jeweller in St Petersburg, but continued to travel, including an important stay in New York where he wrote his first major poem Les P√¢ques √† New York, 1912, before settling in Paris.Interview with Cendrars, 1950 Once in Paris, he started a small press, √âditions des Hommes Nouveaux (New Man Editions) with the help of an anarchist who owned a clandestine printing press at the Mouza√Øa Quarter, 19th arrondissement. His first edition, 125 copies of Les P√¢ques √† New York, was published October 1912.Interview with Blaise Cendrars, Paris Review, p15 Despite failing to sell a single copy, he pressed ahead with the second book, La prose du Transsib√©rien, published June 1913 (see 1913 in poetry). Intended as an edition of 150, only 60 copies were printed, of which about 30 are thought to survive.Enrichement de la Bibliotheque nationale 1961-73, quoted in Sims Reed Rare Books, Dada Futurism etc, 2008 p40 The book, a series of 4 sheets glued together in an accordion- style binding, measures 199 cm tall when unfolded; the height of all 150 end to end would have equalled the height of the Eiffel Tower, a potent symbol of modernity at the time, and referenced in both the poem and the print. > \\"[The poem] describes the 16-year old poet‚Äôs epic, perhaps imaginary, train > journey from Moscow to Harbin (in Mongolia) during the Russo-Japanese War > and the Russian Revolution of 1905.

It is also unusual for 'defying the codex form'The Century of Artist's Books, Drucker, Granary, 1995 p51 and for placing the images on an equal footing to the text; they run parallel and complementary to the text, rather than as illustrative or decorative additions. Simultaneity and the Parisian Avant- Garde Cover of La prose du Transsib√©rien et de la Petite Jehanne de France 1913 The last section of La prose du Transsib√©rien et de la Petite Jehanne de France featuring the Eiffel Tower, 1913 It was through Guillaume Apollinaire, a mutual friend, that Cendrars was to meet Sonia and her husband Robert Delaunay, members of the Parisian avant-garde, leading exponents of cubism, and inventors of the term Simultaneity. The Delaunays had coined the word from their study of Chevreul's laws of simultaneous contrast.Chevreul's Law of Simultaneous Contrast of Colours This new style had first appeared in April 1912 with Robert Delaunay's series of paintings of Fen√™tres (Windows) followed closely by Sonia's abstract Contrastes Simultan√©s and was boldly taken up by both husband and wife for the rest of their careers. > \\"The intensity of the colour field is heightened in accordance with the law > of simultaneous contrast: orange seen next to green becomes more red, while > green seen next to orange appears more blue. These constant two-way > influences create an unusual vibration in the eye of the viewer. Delaunay > read this phenomenon as movement and rhythm and understood it as the > painting appropriate to a modern society in motion.\\"Robert and Sonia > Delaunay, D√ºchting, Taschen 1994, p35 The series of Windows, with their use of the Eiffel Tower as the central theme, were a direct influence on Sonia's contributions to the poem; again, the eye was supposed to move between elements of the picture and the words creating a sensation of speed and disorientation that echoed the poem's theme of travel. The book is contained in a wrapper which declares it the \\"first simultaneous book'. It also contains a map of Siberia at the beginning of the book, showing the route of the train journey. Reception of the Book Simultaneous Windows on the City, 1912, by Robert Delaunay, Hamburger Kunsthalle When published, the book was to cause a sensation in the avant- garde circles in Paris.Robert and Sonia Delaunay, D√ºchting, Taschen 1994, p38 Many, if not most, of the surviving copies are now held by major museums and libraries, including the V&A;, Tate Modern, MoMA, the Hermitage, Swiss National Library,Swiss National Library.

Every year he and his wife would entertain juvenile delinquents who were serving their sentences at the training ship \\"Akbar\\". Cropper would also hold a bible class every Sunday at a home the family had set up for \\"fallen girls.\\" This was in addition to the ragged school they set up for local pauper's children. This school was known as \\"St. Croppers\\" and is likely to be the one referred to in the poem below. In 1836, his father's partner, Robert Rathbone Benson (known as \\"Robert R\\"), had resigned membership from the Quakers. This was no small affair as the Quaker church was the centre of its members community. Benson was involved with, and related to, Isaac Crewdson (a leader to the Manchester Quaker meeting). Crewdson had written and published a book in January 1835 called A Beacon to the Society of Friends.* The controversy it ignited, which related to the role of evangelism in the Society, eventually led to the resignation of Crewdson and about 300 similarly minded people across the country.The Beaconite Controversy, Anna Braithwaite Thomas, 1912 Benson moved to Manchester. It was because of this internal controversy that on 31 January 1838, John Cropper's father James Cropper ended the partnership of Cropper, Benson & Co. which had made the family rich and wealthy. His father wanted to direct his energies to philanthropic interests and his two sons, John and Edward, had agreed. In 1840, John Cropper journeyed to London to attend the World's anti-slavery convention on 12 June 1840.

Language contact For the Puinave-Nadahup languages, Jolkesky (2016) notes that there are lexical similarities with the Tupian, Harakmbet, Katukina-Katawixi, Arawak, and Karaja language families due to contact, pointing to an origin of Proto-Puinave-Nadahup in the Madeira River basin. Criticism Epps (2008)Patience Epps, 2008. A Grammar of Hup. Mouton de Gruyter. criticizes the Puinave‚ÄìNadahup proposal for relying on inaccurate data, having no clear concept of basic vocabulary, and using an unsystematic mix of Nadahup languages in the comparison. The languages were originally linked simply because they are all called Maku \\"babble\\" by Arawakans; that is, because they are spoken by hunter-gatherers. Since then, some linguists have attempted to verify the connection by finding cognates. However, no convincing cognates have yet been found. For example, Rivet and Tastevin claim that the Hup pronoun am \\"I\\" corresponds to Puinave am \\"I\\", but the Hup pronoun ‚Äôam means \\"you\\"; the Hup pronoun for \\"I\\" is ‚Äô√£h. Other \\"strikingly similar\\" pairs, such as Puinave ueyu \\"day\\" and Hup uerh√≥ (') \\"sun\\", are not particularly convincing, and no regular sound correspondences have been detected.

Grave of Carl August Hagberg in Lund. Hagberg was a student at Uppsala University, and became a professor of Ancient Greek there in 1833. Upon his father's advice, he spent 1835 and 1836 travelling in Germany and France. During this time he met notable writers from both countries, including: Victor Hugo, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling and Ludwig Tieck. Upon his return to Sweden, Hagberg became a strong advocate of English and French literature ‚Äì at the time Swedish universities were dominated by German influences. In 1837 he wrote Om den nya franska vitterheten, an essay surveying contemporary French literature. Hagberg was a professor of aesthetics and modern languages at Lund University from 1840 to 1859, when he became a professor of Nordic languages at the same university. He was one of the most famous public speakers of his day. In 1853 he was asked to make the public address at the unveiling of the statue of Esaias Tegn√©r at Lund Cathedral.

It is a part of the Crosstime Traffic series, and takes place in an alternate world where the Black Death was much more virulent, resulting in 80% of the European population being killed off, and the continent becoming subsequently populated by Muslims. The later part of the book takes place in another alternate world, where the Roman Empire was aborted at an early stage and where Spain is divided between Carthaginian colonies on the shores and Basque tribes in the interior. Plot summary The book focuses on the relations between Christians and Muslims, as well as slaves and masters, in the medieval society through the eyes of Annette, an 18-year-old time traveller from the late 21st century who poses as the daughter of a Muslim merchant and who is captured and sold into slavery. It is also the first book in the series to concentrate more upon the late 21st-century origins of the Crosstime Traffic organization. Reception Publishers Weekly in their review said \\"Turtledove convincingly portrays the conflict between Christians and Muslims, but takes less care in depicting male-and-female relationships. Didactic pronouncements on slavery notwithstanding, the book should satisfy its target audience of younger readers.\\" Roland J.

It tells the story of its title character, Molly, a woman blind since infancy, who undergoes an operation to try to restore her sight. Like Friel's Faith Healer, the play tells Molly's story through monologues by three characters: Molly, her husband Frank, and her surgeon, Mr. Rice. It enjoyed considerable success on the stage, but attracted little critical interest, perhaps because of its superficial similarities to Faith Healer (1979), another play composed of a series of monologues delivered on an empty stage by characters who have no interaction. This play is about a blind woman in Ballybeg who constructed for herself an independent life rich in friendships and sensual fulfillment, and her ill-fated encounter with two men who destroy it and cause her madness: Frank, the man she marries who becomes convinced that she can only be complete when her vision is restored, and Dr. Rice, a once-renowned eye surgeon who uses Molly to restore his career. In a note in the programme of the 1996 Broadway production, Friel says that the story was inspired in part by Oliver Sacks's essay \\"To See and Not See\\"\\"Vincent Canby, \\"Seeing, in Brian Friel's Ballybeg\\", The New York Times, 8 January 1996. Production history Molly Sweeney received its first performance on August 9, 1994 at the Gate Theatre, Dublin. It was directed by Friel and featured Catherine Byrne as Molly, Mark Lambert as Frank Sweeney, and T. P. McKenna as Mr. Rice. It received its American premiere in 1996 in an Off Broadway production at the Roundabout Theatre. Catherine Byrne again starred as Molly, Alfred Molina played her husband Frank, and Jason Robards played Mr. Rice. It won the Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Play of the 1996 season. The play was revived at the Print Room theatre in west London in 2013, with Dorothy Duffy in the titular role. The play was in large part inspired by the essay by neurologist Oliver Sacks, \\"To See and Not See,\\" published in An Anthropologist on Mars.

In Curious Notions, the Central Powers won World War I prior to the United States entering the war. Subsequently, the German Empire invaded and conquered the United States in the 1950s. The story is set 150 years later, in German-occupied San Francisco. The main plot deals with time travelers from our universe establishing an electronics shop in San Francisco, coming under the suspicion of both the German authorities and the Tongs while preventing the Germans from duplicating the time travel technology. Backstory leading up to the plot The Central Powers win by managing to knock out France and the British Expeditionary Force in the west towards the beginning of the war. Then they defeat Russia before the United States can intervene. A few years later, the German Empire intervenes in the Russian Revolution and defeats the Bolsheviks, but the Russian Empire is mostly divided and therefore no longer a great power. Britain and France tried to stop Germany's power again in the late 1930s, but since the United States does not intervene, they lose and Germany gains control over Europe and its sphere of influence. Germany is also able to restore the monarchies of Brazil, China and Portugal. Since Germany never persecuted the Jewish people of their country, they discovered the atomic bomb and gain further dominance. The United States was largely ignorant of the power of these bombs and as a result lost World War III when it broke out in 1956. It resulted in the nuclear destruction of most major cities in the United States. San Francisco, the setting, is intact because the United States was able to shoot some of the German bombers down before they could reach the city. A side effect of the US being dominated by Germany is soccer becoming the most popular spectator sport in the American society, largely displacing baseball.

Its range includes most of the Central Rhodopes, i.e. the region of Smolyan. Its immediate neighbours are the Rhodopean Hvoyna dialect to the north, the Serres-Nevrokop dialect and the Razlog dialect to the west and the Turkish dialects of the Turkish population in the Eastern Rhodopes. To the south, the Smolyan dialect crosses the Greek- Bulgarian border and is spoken by much of the Muslim Bulgarian (Pomak) population in Western Thrace. As a result of the rugged mountainous terrain and the century-long isolation of the region from the rest of the country, the Smolyan dialect is the most idiosyncratic of all Bulgarian dialects (including the Western Central Macedonian dialects) and is not readily understandable even for its immediate neighbours. Phonological and morphological characteristics * The most important phonological characteristic of the Smolyan dialect is the existence of broad o (oa), which is pronounced approximately as the long Swedish a but without the length, i.e. as a broad open o which resembles the vowel a at the end of its articulation. Old Church Slavonic big yus —´, little yus —ß, —å and —ä have all merged into the open o in the Smolyan dialect, when they are in a stressed syllable: –∑–æ–∞–ø vs. formal Bulgarian –∑—ä–ø (tooth), –∑“Ñ–æ–∞—Ç The diacritic ‚óå“Ñ indicates palatalization. vs. formal Bulgarian –∑–µ—Ç (son-in-law), –∑–æ–∞–ª–≤–∞ vs. formal Bulgarian –∑—ä–ª–≤–∞ (sister- in-law).

He was primarily an opening batsman and an occasional medium- paced bowler. Wright played as a professional for Stourbridge Cricket Club before beginning his county career. Obituary. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 1957. His first-class debut came in May 1925, when he scored 31 and 14 against Oxford University at The Parks. He did not play again that season, but in 1926 he appeared on 26 occasions, and ended the summer with 873 first-class runs at an average of 18.97. This tally included his maiden hundred, 111 against Hampshire (sharing an opening partnership of 185 with Maurice Jewell) in midsummer. He also picked up the first of his 76 wickets when he removed Leicestershire's Les Berry and Alec Skelding in early June. From then until the end of his career in 1933, Wright was a regular sight in the Worcestershire team: in only two seasons (1931 and 1933) did he make fewer than 20 appearances. His most productive season was 1928, when he made 1,402 runs at 24.07, including 101 and 57 against Hampshire. He also passed his thousand runs in 1930, when he hit 1,180: this was the only year in which he made two centuries, of which the higher (his career best) was 134 against Northamptonshire in July. He narrowly missed out on the landmark in 1929, making 992 runs that year. After 1930 Wright never scored another hundred, and although his form recovered somewhat after a dreadful 1931 in which he averaged less than 10, in 92 innings in the last three years of his career the highest score was the 86 he struck against the touring Indians at Worcester in June 1932. He did hit another six half-centuries that summer, and a further three in his final season of 1933. His last game, against Glamorgan in late August 1933, was an anticlimax: Wright was bowled by George Lavis for 3 in his only innings, and went wicketless from ten overs. Wright also played football as a centre-forward in the Worcester League. After retiring from cricket, he ran a remand home in Mitcham, Surrey.

It reached the Top 30 of the Billboard Pop chart, charting at #27 and the Top 10 of Cash Box R&B; chart, peaking at #10.(Billboard Magazine's R&B; chart was temporarily suspended during this time). This is not the Chris Kenner hit song of the same name, but rather, a Miracles original, written by Miracles members Smokey Robinson and Marv Tarplin, and is included on the group's first greatest hits album, Greatest Hits from the Beginning. It was also the title song from their long-since deleted 1964 album of the same name.http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3003/2935499159_26d91ac680.jpg?v=0 Like many Miracles hit songs, \\"I Like It Like That\\" begins with Tarplin's guitar. It features a \\"live party\\" feel, similar to their earlier 1963 hit, \\"Mickey's Monkey\\". Smokey encourages everybody to \\"clap your hands now, everybody, we're gonna have some fun tonight...we're gonna sing and shout...knock ourselves out...and everything's gonna be alright\\". The other Miracles, Bobby, Ronnie, Pete, and Claudette, join in with their trademark harmony vocals, with chants of alright, and I like it like that as The Funk Brothers add additional instruments to the mix. \\"I Like It Like That\\" was released during a period (1964) when Smokey and the Miracles were so busy touring as the headline act with the famed Motortown Revue shows, and writing big hits for other Motown acts, principally Mary Wells and The Temptations, that their own chart action suffered. Of the group's four single releases that year (the others were \\"Come On Do The Jerk\\", \\"(You Can't Let the Boy Overpower) The Man in You\\", and \\"That's What Love Is Made Of\\"), \\"I Like It Like That\\" was the only one to crack the Billboard Pop Top 30, while two songs that they wrote for the two aforementioned acts, \\"My Guy\\" and \\"My Girl\\" respectively, both reached #1 Pop. (\\"My Girl\\" was originally intended to be recorded by The Miracles, had they released it instead, it would have given them a badly needed big hit that year). The following year, 1965, was The Miracles' biggest year ever. \\"I Like It Like That\\" has inspired cover versions by Bobby Vee and Mitch Ryder & the Detroit Wheels. The song's B side, \\"You're So Fine And Sweet\\", featured a rare lead by Miracles second tenor Bobby Rogers (who had sung co-lead vocals with Smokey on the group's smash single \\"You've Really Got A Hold On Me\\" the previous year), and inspired a cover version by The Undertakers.

United States The Strasburg Junior City Council, founded in November 2006, is composed of youth public officials elected into office. Its purpose is to give young adults experience in government and politics. It functions as a normal City Council with meetings, agendas, minutes, and takes on public projects. The Junior Council is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, and is copyrighted. Zimbabwe A Junior Council is a replica of the senior council. It carries out tasks same as the senior council but at a junior level. This is done through child participation and capacity building in developmental issues and local governance.http://www.njcazimbawe.org In the early 1950 the idea of a Junior City Council was conceived to run parallel with the Senior Council. It was molded into a non-political and non-profit making organization whose aims as laid out in its operating constitution were to; provide a means by which senior scholars may obtain knowledge of civic affairs, report to senior scholars information pertinent to City Council affairs, create an organization representative of all the senior schools within the area of the jurisdiction of the Senior City Council, create a liaison between the young people of the city and the City Council, provide the young people of the city with a means by which they may make known their opinions and feelings, and by the example set by the Junior Council encourage a desire among the younger citizens of the city to participate actively in the affairs of the city. It is a make-up of senior scholars doing their A-level studies. In Zimbabwe there are 92 local authorities with Junior Councils (JCs), which include city councils, town councils, local boards and rural district councils (RDC). The Junior City Council is headed by an executive committee which comprises the Junior Mayor, Junior Deputy Mayor, Junior Town Clerk, Junior Treasurer, Junior Public Relations officer, Junior Projects coordinator, Junior Chief of Committees Clerk. The number of the Junior councilors equals the number of the Senior Councilors or alternatively the number of wards that need individual council representation. A ward being the subdivided units of the city that a Councilor is given mandate to represent. The Junior Council activities are closely monitored and regulated by a body of former excelled Junior Councilors who are awarded the title City Junior Alderman. The Junior Council term runs for a year and that of Junior Alderman is for life. In the case of RDCs, there is a change of title to the leadership of the Junior Council. Where there is a mayor in urban councils, in RDCs there are a Junior Council Chairperson and deputy chairperson. Where there are town clerks in urban councils, there is a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in RDCs. Other positions are the same and there is a need to give the right title to the right person. A Junior Council is a child-led apolitical organisation whose main thrust is to advocate for the realisation, advancement and protection of child rights. In addition, the Junior Municipal Council also addresses issues such as school dropouts, child abuse, HIV/AIDs, child friendly budgeting, child participation and other pertinent issues affecting children of their areas of jurisdiction and Zimbabwe at large to the relevant authorities and different stakeholders. The Junior Councils in Zimbabwe are headed and advised by the National Junior Councils Association of Zimbabwe (NJCA). This works as the advisory and mother board of all the 92 local authorities with Junior Councils in the Republic of Zimbabwe. It was formed by a group of outgoing Junior Councillors who later became Junior Aldermen from different councils, including Mvurwi TC, Marondera Municipality, Bulawayo City Council, Chegutu Town Council, Chitungwiza Municipality, Chinhoyi Municipality and Harare City Council among others. The NJCA runs with the mantra \\"Children's issues our priority.\\" The main business of Junior Councils is to safeguard the rights of all children across the continent and the world.  South Africa  South Africa also has Junior City Councils in each city. These are non-profit organizations that serves the youth and community of their area. They organize a number of events to provide opportunities for the youth to interact, to take initiative and responsibility and simultaneously raise funds for charity. The council members represent the willing schools in that allocated area/city. The learners plan and do all the fundraising events by themselves. The Junior City Councils are led by a student-elected executive or management committee and are overseen by a governing body of adult members.

It was constructed in 1982 as the headquarters of the Union Carbide chemical company, it is known for its unusual style and floorplan layout. __TOC__ History In 1976, Union Carbide announced that it intended to relocate from New York City to a location in Connecticut. After beginning construction in 1980, Union Carbide moved its approximately 3,000 staff members to the facility in 1983. Following several corporate realignments, space was rented out to several different companies after a 1986 leaseback arrangement transferred ownership to a Florida concern. This resulted in the facility being renamed the Corporate Center in 1992. Following the purchase of Union Carbide by The Dow Chemical Company in 2001, the Union Carbide staff was further reduced and more space sublet to other companies. In 2007 the building was sold to Grubb & Ellis for $80 million, less than half its original construction cost of $190 million. In 2009, the building was resold to Matrix Reality Group for $72.4 million. Matrix Realty Group, Inc., the new owner of the building, carried out several renovations,http://nerej.com/43722 such as new granite in the Main Reception area and in other parts of the building, and renamed it the Matrix Corporate Center.http://m.newstimes.com/local/article/Reviving-a-corporate- jewel-387802.php#photo-116496 In 2018, Matrix was sold to Summit Development, a real estate developer based in Southport, Connecticut for $18 million.

The building was designed with several pods for the then divisions of Union Carbide that would occupy the facility. Further, it was set up so that each office was very close, sometimes only 10 feet (3 m), from its related parking spot and that employees would not need to exit the building to perform any functions. In the center of the complex are several conference rooms, libraries, a cafeteria, and other support services. Each room in the 2.1 million-square-foot (195,000 m¬≤) complex, 1.3 million (117,000 m¬≤) of which is office space, has separate temperature controls and natural light through a series of translucent windows.

It was started in 2001 by David Szafranski in order to provide a Windows exclusive version of the XBasic dialect. XBLite is released under the GNU GPL licensing scheme, Standard libraries are released under the GNU LGPL licensing scheme. The XBLite syntax is very similar to that of XBasic and somewhat similar to Microsoft's QuickBASIC in that it is a procedural language capable of subs and functions. XBLite also has 64 bit integer data type, User Defined Types and the ability to have multiple modules in order to create GUI applications or games.  XBLite History  XBLite is a project that was started back in 2001. The main idea was to create a language that was based on the XBasic project that was to be exclusively a Microsoft Windows only programming language and environment. The first official release (version 1.0.0) was announced on October 2002, and subsequent versions were spread out amongst the last 6 years of development. Each release boasted both bug fixes and new features (to either the language itself and/or the different tools that are available with the XBLite project). Today, version 2.4.0 is the current release of the compiler and version 1.30 of XSEd (The code editor). One of the latest projects is a visual GUI designer called viXen.  XBLite Development Specific Events  Screenshot of the XSEd editor, used with the XBLite programming language. * A project called xpeeper is currently being developed by the XBLite team. This aims to give Peephole optimization technology to the XBLite project. The project has been distributed with XBLite since XBLite version 2.3.0. As well, XBLite is itself written in XBLite, making it a self hosting compiler (it can compile itself). Since version 2.1.0, XBLite incorporates the M4 preprocessor tool. * XSEd, the code editor available with XBLite was developed in XBLite. It is based on the Scintilla project, a widely used editing component. XSEd is a full featured editor that allows users to work with XBLite source code modules and allows them to compile the code right from the editor. * Open source project, viXen was originally created by John \\"prujohn\\" Evans, who released version 0.50a on July 22, 2006. It is a WYSIWYG screen designer and an XBLite generator: viXen allows users to prototype a Windows GUI application before coding in XBLite the actual functions inside the generated skeleton. Currently, Guy Lonn√© develops and maintains the viXen project at SourceForge. * XBLite working with the native Windows API, Callum Lowcay started the WinX project. It is a GUI library (WinX.dll) written in XBLite that \\"wraps\\" many of the most useful WinAPI calls. WinX simplifies coding Windows GUI applications in XBLite by providing an interface to the Windows widgets. WinX's applications can be first prototyped using viXen by just selecting the generation switch \\"Use WinX\\" prior the generation of the source code.  Components  XBLite comes with a complete set of components. * Compiler (can make executable files, libraries and dynamic linked libraries (DLL) files) * Scintilla Code Editor XSEd * Resource Compiler * Peephole optimizer xpeeper * Graphical user interface builder viXen (Beta stage but very usable) * GUI library WinX  Sample Code  Here is a classic example as it might be coded in XBLite. * Hello world program in XBLite, console mode PROGRAM \\"hello\\" CONSOLE DECLARE FUNCTION Entry () FUNCTION Entry () a$ = INLINE$ (\\"Hello World!

Early life and career Geoffrey Rose was born in London on 19 April 1926 to Arthur Norman Rose, a Methodist minister, and Mary n√©e Wadsworth, who was the daughter of a Methodist minister. In 1958 he joined the epidemiology department of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and became a part-time Reader in 1964. In 1970 he became the Visiting Professor of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine and was elected to Full Professor of Epidemiology in 1977. In his time at the LSHTM he worked with many pioneering epidemiologists, including Donald Reid. He was also responsible for starting the Masters in Epidemiology course. He died 12 November 1993. Influence Of his numerous publications, there are two that stand out in terms of their influence on the discipline of epidemiology, the seminal 1985 article \\"Sick Individuals and Sick Populations\\" and his 1992 book \\"The Strategy of Preventive Medicine\\". The impact goes beyond the field of epidemiology and into that of public health generally. One publication claimed that \\"A casual Social Sciences Citation Index search yielded over 700 citations of this work\\". As S Schwartz and AV Diez-Roux pointed out, the central lesson that has been integrated into the aforementioned fields is that \\"a large number of people at a small risk may give rise to more cases of disease than the small number who are at high risk\\". It was their assertion that this insight of Rose has profound implications for intervention and prevention strategies, and has been incorporated into research contexts through an understanding of the difference between measures of absolute and relative risk. Rose is among the physicians and epidemiologists who best conveyed the notion that \\"as citizens and societies we have shared, common responsibilities in front of threats to health is central to epidemiology, public health, even to clinical medicine\\". He also clearly showed that a preventive measure that brings large benefits to the community may offer little to each participating person. For example, to prevent one death due to a motor vehicle accident, many hundreds of people must wear seat belts. Conversely, an intervention which brings much benefit to an individual may have a small impact in the population. These phenomena are sometimes called prevention paradoxes. ‚ÄòHigh-risk strategy' According to Rose, the ‚Äòhigh-risk strategy' to prevention is a clinically oriented approach to preventive medicine which focuses its efforts on needy individuals with the highest levels of the risk factor ('the deviant minority with high-risk status'), and uses the established framework of medical services. In other words, the 'high-risk strategy' is 'a targeted rescue operation for vulnerable individuals'. The aim is to help each person reduce the high level of exposure to a cause or to some intermediate variable. Main strengths of this strategy include: the intervention may be matched to the needs of the individual; it may avoid interference with those who are not at a special risk; it may be accommodated within the ethical and cultural values, organisation, and economics, of the health care system; selectivity may increase the likelihood of a cost-effective use of resources. Main weaknesses of the high-risk strategy are: prevention may become medicalised; success may be palliative and temporary; the contribution to overall (population) control of a disease may be small; the preventive intervention may be behaviourally or culturally inadequate or unsustainable; it has a poor ability to predict which individuals will benefit from the intervention.Porta M, ed. A dictionary of epidemiology. 5th. edition. New York: Oxford University Press, 2008. and A failure of high-risk prevention strategies is their inability to prevent disease in the large part of the population at a relatively small risk and from which most cases of diseases originate. Partly in response to this failure, there is a development of individual predictive medicine and a widening of high-risk categories for numerous conditions, what lead to the application of \\"pseudo-high-risk\\" prevention strategies. Nevertheless, widening the criteria for individual preventive interventions lead to treating, individually, larger strata of the population. Such pseudo-high-risk prevention strategies raise similar problems compared with high-risk strategies, however on a larger scale and without any of the benefit of population-based strategies. ‚ÄòPopulation strategy‚Äô This is a public health-oriented approach to preventive medicine and public health which predicts that shifting the population distribution of a risk factor prevents more burden of disease than targeting people at high risk. Rose introduced this principle to accommodate for members of the community who were at of low risk. It starts with the recognition that the occurrence of common exposures and diseases reflects the functioning of society as a whole. The approach is more relevant to decrease exposure to (a) certain environmental agents that individuals have little capacity to detect than to (b) risk factors that individuals may generally decide to avoid. Main strengths of this strategy include: it may be radical (‚Äúonly the social and political approach confronts the root causes‚Äù); the societal effects of a distributional shift may be large; it may be more culturally appropriate and sustainable to seek a general change in behavioural norms and in the social values that facilitate their adoption than to attempt to individually change behaviours that are socially conditioned. Main limitations of the population strategy are: it offers only a small benefit to each participating individual, which may be wiped out by a small risk; it requires major changes in the economics and mode of functioning of society, which often makes changes unlikely. Individuals generally prefer to pay as late as possible, and to enjoy the benefits as soon as possible. Social benefits ‚Äìwhich are often achieved through processes with the opposite timing of costs and benefits‚Äì may thus be scarcely attractive to the individual. Nevertheless, shared values and targets do exist at the community level. It was reasserted by Doyle, Furey and Flowers, writing in 2005, that the central messages expounded by Rose remain highly relevant to modern public health policy and practice.Y G Doyle, A Furey, J Flowers, Sick individuals and sick populations: 20 years later, South East London Strategic Health Authority and European Centre on Health of Societies in Transition, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, UK; Eastern Region Public Health Observatory, Institute of Public Health, Cambridge, UK, 2005 Honours and awards * Donald Reid Medal for Epidemiology in 1985. * CBE 1991 References Category:1926 births Category:1993 deaths Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:British public health doctors Category:Fellows of the Royal College of General Practitioners Category:Donald Reid Medalists Category:British epidemiologists Category:20th-century British medical doctors ","title":"Geoffrey Rose (epidemiologist)"},{"id":"18695606","text":"Hallgr√≠msson is a surname of Icelandic origin, meaning son of Hallgr√≠mur.

The organization employs over 200 full and part-time staff including lifeguards, office/headquarters staff and other positions relevant to its services. The Long Beach Township Beach Patrol guards of ocean beaches and two bay beaches and is one of the largest beach patrols in the United States. Lifeguard on duty Organization The of protected area (including bay beaches) are overseen by the beach patrol chief and are further divided into patrols. Each patrol has its own captain, lieutenant, and acting lieutenant. Beaches guarded by LBTBP from north to south are: Loveladies, North Beach, Brant Beach, Beach Haven Crest, Spray Beach, and Holgate. Competitions Each of the patrols compete in annual in-house competitions. These competitions encourage lifeguards to maintain their fitness and test skills like rowing, paddling, swimming and running. Towards the end of each summer there is a two-day competition known as Mayor's Cup. All of the patrols compete to win this event, however North Beach and Loveladies are combined due to their small size.  Programs  LBT Truck towing a Jetski LBTBP has multiple programs: IRB Program The IRB (Inflatable Rescue Boat) program consists of LBTBP lifeguards who have been chosen to participate in it. The IRBs are used to patrol along the shore line (just outside the swimming area) to provide backup for rescues, setup for competitions and assist with un- cooperative boaters and personal water craft users. SCUBA Search and Rescue Lifeguards who display excellent work ethic can apply to be part of the SCUBA search and rescue team, which provides search and rescue services for LBTBP when dealing with submerged victims. The team also assists in helping setup race and competition courses. LIT Program The LIT (Lifeguard In Training) program gives children ages 11‚Äì15 the chance to learn the rescue techniques used by LBTBP in order to greatly improve their chance of being hired at the age of 16. LIT's will learn rescue techniques, procedures and radio codes, CPR and First Aid, and more. Beachwheels program The Beachwheels program was created in 1992 to allow mentally and physically handicapped children and adults the opportunity to experience the beach.

Family Born in Berlin, she was the youngest child and second daughter of King William I of the Netherlands by his wife Wilhelmine of Prussia. Her elder sister, Pauline, had died in 1806, long before her birth, so Marianne became the only daughter of her parents to survive to adulthood. Her two older brothers were the future King William II and Prince Frederik of the Netherlands. Two other brothers were stillborn. Life In The Hague on 14 September 1830, Marianne married her first cousin Prince Albert, the fourth son of her mother's brother, King Frederick William III of Prussia. The union produced five children: * Charlotte (b. Schloss Sch√∂nhausen, near Berlin, 21 June 1831 ‚Äì d.

After this, the courts of The Hague and Berlin broke all contact with her. Marianne, Johannes and their son spent the following years in Italy and from 1853 at Wei√üwasser Castle near Jauernig. Philanthropy In 1855 Marianne bought in Erbach, Rheingau. An unusually progressive woman and cultural visionary, she made the Schloss Reinhartshausen a cultural center of the Rhine. Marianne reconstructed part of the Schloss as a museum to house her collection of 600 paintings. The museum is known today as the Fests√§le. The Schloss was always vibrant with many guests and Marianne encouraged young artists providing them accommodation. Of her treasures, 180 paintings, 110 drawings including watercolors and gouaches, as well as various sculptures can be found there today. Princess Marianne of the Netherlands in later years (ca. 1880). On Christmas Day of 1861, her son Johannes Wilhelm died of pneumonia in Reinhartshausen at age twelve. To honor him, Marianne donated 60.000 Gulden to the Erbacher locals for a piece of land on which a church was to be constructed. The church was completed and Johannes buried under its altar. The church, named after Johannes, is today‚Äôs Protestant church in Erbach. In 1872 in the name of her father King Willem I, she donated 18,000 to Dillenburg to help finance the creation of a new lookout tower, Wilhelmsturm, to commemorate her ancestor William the Silent who plotted his rebellion against the Spanish Netherlands from his home on this spot. On 10 May 1873, Johannes van Rossum, Marianne's partner for almost thirty years and the love of her life, died aged sixty-four. He was buried next to his son. Marianne survived him by ten years and died in the Schloss Reinhartshausen in Erbach twenty days after her seventy-third birthday. She was buried near Johannes van Rossum and their son.

Because single molecules constitute the smallest stable structures imaginable, this miniaturization is the ultimate goal for shrinking electrical circuits. The field is often termed simply as \\"molecular electronics\\", but this term is also used to refer to the distantly related field of conductive polymers and organic electronics, which uses the properties of molecules to affect the bulk properties of a material. A nomenclature distinction has been suggested so that molecular materials for electronics refers to this latter field of bulk applications, while molecular scale electronics refers to the nanoscale single-molecule applications treated here.  Fundamental concepts  Conventional electronics have traditionally been made from bulk materials. Ever since their invention in 1958, the performance and complexity of integrated circuits has undergone exponential growth, a trend named Moore‚Äôs law, as feature sizes of the embedded components have shrunk accordingly. As the structures shrink, the sensitivity to deviations increases. In a few technology generations, when the minimum feature sizes reaches 13 nm, the composition of the devices must be controlled to a precision of a few atoms for the devices to work. With bulk methods growing increasingly demanding and costly as they near inherent limits, the idea was born that the components could instead be built up atom by atom in a chemistry lab (bottom up) versus carving them out of bulk material (top down). This is the idea behind molecular electronics, with the ultimate miniaturization being components contained in single molecules. In single- molecule electronics, the bulk material is replaced by single molecules. Instead of forming structures by removing or applying material after a pattern scaffold, the atoms are put together in a chemistry lab. In this way, billions of billions of copies are made simultaneously (typically more than 1020 molecules are made at once) while the composition of molecules are controlled down to the last atom. The molecules used have properties that resemble traditional electronic components such as a wire, transistor or rectifier. Single-molecule electronics is an emerging field, and entire electronic circuits consisting exclusively of molecular sized compounds are still very far from being realized. However, the unceasing demand for more computing power, along with the inherent limits of lithographic methods , make the transition seem unavoidable. Currently, the focus is on discovering molecules with interesting properties and on finding ways to obtain reliable and reproducible contacts between the molecular components and the bulk material of the electrodes. Theoretical basis Molecular electronics operates in the quantum realm of distances less than 100 nanometers. The miniaturization down to single molecules brings the scale down to a regime where quantum mechanics effects are important. In conventional electronic components, electrons can be filled in or drawn out more or less like a continuous flow of electric charge. In contrast, in molecular electronics the transfer of one electron alters the system significantly. For example, when an electron has been transferred from a source electrode to a molecule, the molecule gets charged up, which makes it far harder for the next electron to transfer (see also Coulomb blockade). The significant amount of energy due to charging must be accounted for when making calculations about the electronic properties of the setup, and is highly sensitive to distances to conducting surfaces nearby. The theory of single- molecule devices is especially interesting since the system under consideration is an open quantum system in nonequilibrium (driven by voltage). In the low bias voltage regime, the nonequilibrium nature of the molecular junction can be ignored, and the current-voltage traits of the device can be calculated using the equilibrium electronic structure of the system. However, in stronger bias regimes a more sophisticated treatment is required, as there is no longer a variational principle. In the elastic tunneling case (where the passing electron does not exchange energy with the system), the formalism of Rolf Landauer can be used to calculate the transmission through the system as a function of bias voltage, and hence the current. In inelastic tunneling, an elegant formalism based on the non-equilibrium Green's functions of Leo Kadanoff and Gordon Baym, and independently by Leonid Keldysh was advanced by Ned Wingreen and Yigal Meir. This Meir-Wingreen formulation has been used to great success in the molecular electronics community to examine the more difficult and interesting cases where the transient electron exchanges energy with the molecular system (for example through electron-phonon coupling or electronic excitations). Further, connecting single molecules reliably to a larger scale circuit has proven a great challenge, and constitutes a significant hindrance to commercialization. Examples Common for molecules used in molecular electronics is that the structures contain many alternating double and single bonds (see also Conjugated system). This is done because such patterns delocalize the molecular orbitals, making it possible for electrons to move freely over the conjugated area. Wires This animation of a rotating carbon nanotube shows its 3D structure. The sole purpose of molecular wires is to electrically connect different parts of a molecular electrical circuit. As the assembly of these and their connection to a macroscopic circuit is still not mastered, the focus of research in single- molecule electronics is primarily on the functionalized molecules: molecular wires are characterized by containing no functional groups and are hence composed of plain repetitions of a conjugated building block. Among these are the carbon nanotubes that are quite large compared to the other suggestions but have shown very promising electrical properties. The main problem with the molecular wires is to obtain good electrical contact with the electrodes so that electrons can move freely in and out of the wire. Transistors Single-molecule transistors are fundamentally different from the ones known from bulk electronics. The gate in a conventional (field-effect) transistor determines the conductance between the source and drain electrode by controlling the density of charge carriers between them, whereas the gate in a single-molecule transistor controls the possibility of a single electron to jump on and off the molecule by modifying the energy of the molecular orbitals. One of the effects of this difference is that the single-molecule transistor is almost binary: it is either on or off. This opposes its bulk counterparts, which have quadratic responses to gate voltage. It is the quantization of charge into electrons that is responsible for the markedly different behavior compared to bulk electronics. Because of the size of a single molecule, the charging due to a single electron is significant and provides means to turn a transistor on or off (see Coulomb blockade). For this to work, the electronic orbitals on the transistor molecule cannot be too well integrated with the orbitals on the electrodes. If they are, an electron cannot be said to be located on the molecule or the electrodes and the molecule will function as a wire. A popular group of molecules, that can work as the semiconducting channel material in a molecular transistor, is the oligopolyphenylenevinylenes (OPVs) that works by the Coulomb blockade mechanism when placed between the source and drain electrode in an appropriate way. Fullerenes work by the same mechanism and have also been commonly used. Semiconducting carbon nanotubes have also been demonstrated to work as channel material but although molecular, these molecules are sufficiently large to behave almost as bulk semiconductors. The size of the molecules, and the low temperature of the measurements being conducted, makes the quantum mechanical states well defined. Thus, it is being researched if the quantum mechanical properties can be used for more advanced purposes than simple transistors (e.g. spintronics). Physicists at the University of Arizona, in collaboration with chemists from the University of Madrid, have designed a single-molecule transistor using a ring-shaped molecule similar to benzene. Physicists at Canada's National Institute for Nanotechnology have designed a single-molecule transistor using styrene. Both groups expect (the designs were experimentally unverified ) their respective devices to function at room temperature, and to be controlled by a single electron. Anderson, Mark (2005-06-09) \\"Honey, I Shrunk the PC\\". Wired.com Rectifiers (diodes) Hydrogen can be removed from individual tetraphenylporphyrin (H2TPP) molecules by applying excess voltage to the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STAM, a); this removal alters the current-voltage (I-V) curves of TPP molecules, measured using the same STM tip, from diode-like (red curve in b) to resistor-like (green curve). Image (c) shows a row of TPP, H2TPP and TPP molecules. While scanning image (d), excess voltage was applied to H2TPP at the black dot, which instantly removed hydrogen, as shown in the bottom part of (d) and in the re-scan image (e). Such manipulations can be used in single-molecule electronics. Molecular rectifiers are mimics of their bulk counterparts and have an asymmetric construction so that the molecule can accept electrons in one end but not the other. The molecules have an electron donor (D) in one end and an electron acceptor (A) in the other. This way, the unstable state D+ ‚Äì A‚àí will be more readily made than D‚àí ‚Äì A+. The result is that an electric current can be drawn through the molecule if the electrons are added through the acceptor end, but less easily if the reverse is attempted. Methods One of the biggest problems with measuring on single molecules is to establish reproducible electrical contact with only one molecule and doing so without shortcutting the electrodes. Because the current photolithographic technology is unable to produce electrode gaps small enough to contact both ends of the molecules tested (on the order of nanometers), alternative strategies are applied. Molecular gaps One way to produce electrodes with a molecular sized gap between them is break junctions, in which a thin electrode is stretched until it breaks. Another is electromigration. Here a current is led through a thin wire until it melts and the atoms migrate to produce the gap. Further, the reach of conventional photolithography can be enhanced by chemically etching or depositing metal on the electrodes. Probably the easiest way to conduct measurements on several molecules is to use the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to contact molecules adhered at the other end to a metal substrate. Anchoring A popular way to anchor molecules to the electrodes is to make use of sulfur's high chemical affinity to gold. In these setups, the molecules are synthesized so that sulfur atoms are placed strategically to function as crocodile clips connecting the molecules to the gold electrodes. Though useful, the anchoring is non-specific and thus anchors the molecules randomly to all gold surfaces. Further, the contact resistance is highly dependent on the precise atomic geometry around the site of anchoring and thereby inherently compromises the reproducibility of the connection. To circumvent the latter issue, experiments has shown that fullerenes could be a good candidate for use instead of sulfur because of the large conjugated œÄ-system that can electrically contact many more atoms at once than one atom of sulfur.S√∏rensen, J.K. . (2006). \\"Synthesis of new components, functionalized with (60)fullerene, for molecular electronics\\". 4th Annual meeting ‚Äì CONT 2006, University of Copenhagen. Fullerene nanoelectronics In polymers, classical organic molecules are composed of both carbon and hydrogen (and sometimes additional compounds such as nitrogen, chlorine or sulphur). They are obtained from petrol and can often be synthesized in large amounts. Most of these molecules are insulating when their length exceeds a few nanometers. However, naturally occurring carbon is conducting, especially graphite recovered from coal or encountered otherwise. From a theoretical viewpoint, graphite is a semi-metal, a category in between metals and semi- conductors. It has a layered structure, each sheet being one atom thick. Between each sheet, the interactions are weak enough to allow an easy manual cleavage. Tailoring the graphite sheet to obtain well defined nanometer-sized objects remains a challenge. However, by the close of the twentieth century, chemists were exploring methods to fabricate extremely small graphitic objects that could be considered single molecules. After studying the interstellar conditions under which carbon is known to form clusters, Richard Smalley's group (Rice University, Texas) set up an experiment in which graphite was vaporized via laser irradiation. Mass spectrometry revealed that clusters containing specific magic numbers of atoms were stable, especially those clusters of 60 atoms. Harry Kroto, an English chemist who assisted in the experiment, suggested a possible geometry for these clusters ‚Äì atoms covalently bound with the exact symmetry of a soccer ball. Coined buckminsterfullerenes, buckyballs, or C60, the clusters retained some properties of graphite, such as conductivity. These objects were rapidly envisioned as possible building blocks for molecular electronics. Problems=Artifacts When trying to measure electronic traits of molecules, artificial phenomena can occur that can be hard to distinguish from truly molecular behavior. Before they were discovered, these artifacts have mistakenly been published as being features pertaining to the molecules in question. Applying a voltage drop on the order of volts across a nanometer sized junction results in a very strong electrical field. The field can cause metal atoms to migrate and eventually close the gap by a thin filament, which can be broken again when carrying a current. The two levels of conductance imitate molecular switching between a conductive and an isolating state of a molecule. Another encountered artifact is when the electrodes undergo chemical reactions due to the high field strength in the gap. When the voltage bias is reversed, the reaction will cause hysteresis in the measurements that can be interpreted as being of molecular origin. A metallic grain between the electrodes can act as a single electron transistor by the mechanism described above, thus resembling the traits of a molecular transistor. This artifact is especially common with nanogaps produced by the electromigration method. Commercialization One of the biggest hindrances for single-molecule electronics to be commercially exploited is the lack of methods to connect a molecular sized circuit to bulk electrodes in a way that gives reproducible results. At the current state, the difficulty of connecting single molecules vastly outweighs any possible performance increase that could be gained from such shrinkage. The difficulties grow worse if the molecules are to have a certain spatial orientation and/or have multiple poles to connect. Also problematic is that some measurements on single molecules are carried out in cryogenic temperatures (near absolute zero), which is very energy consuming. This is done to reduce signal noise enough to measure the faint currents of single molecules. History and recent progress Graphical representation of a rotaxane, useful as a molecular switch. In their treatment of so-called donor-acceptor complexes in the 1940s, Robert Mulliken and Albert Szent- Gy√∂rgyi advanced the concept of charge transfer in molecules. They subsequently further refined the study of both charge transfer and energy transfer in molecules. Likewise, a 1974 paper from Mark Ratner and Ari Aviram illustrated a theoretical molecular rectifier. In 1960, Egyptian engineer Mohamed Atalla and Korean engineer Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs fabricated the first MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor) with a gate oxide thickness of 100 nm, along with a gate length of 20¬µm. In 1962, Atalla and Kahng fabricated a nanolayer-base metal‚Äìsemiconductor junction (M‚ÄìS junction) transistor that used gold thin films with a thickness of 10 nm. In 1987, Iranian engineer Bijan Davari led an IBM research team that demonstrated the first MOSFET with a 10 nm gate oxide thickness, using tungsten-gate technology. In 1988, Aviram described in detail a theoretical single-molecule field-effect transistor. Further concepts were proposed by Forrest Carter of the Naval Research Laboratory, including single-molecule logic gates. A wide range of ideas were presented, under his aegis, at a conference entitled Molecular Electronic Devices in 1988.Carter, F. L.; Siatkowski, R. E. and Wohltjen, H. (eds.) (1988) Molecular Electronic Devices, pp. 229‚Äì244, North Holland, Amsterdam. These were theoretical constructs and not concrete devices. The direct measurement of the electronic traits of individual molecules awaited the development of methods for making molecular-scale electrical contacts. This was no easy task. Thus, the first experiment directly-measuring the conductance of a single molecule was only reported in 1995 on a single C60 molecule by C. Joachim and J. K. Gimzewsky in their seminal Physical Revie Letter paper and later in 1997 by Mark Reed and co- workers on a few hundred molecules. Since then, this branch of the field has advanced rapidly. Likewise, as it has grown possible to measure such properties directly, the theoretical predictions of the early workers have been confirmed substantially. The concept of molecular electronics was published in 1974 when Aviram and Ratner suggested an organic molecule that could work as a rectifier. Having both huge commercial and fundamental interest, much effort was put into proving its feasibility, and 16 years later in 1990, the first demonstration of an intrinsic molecular rectifier was realized by Ashwell and coworkers for a thin film of molecules. The first measurement of the conductance of a single molecule was realised in 1994 by C. Joachim and J. K. Gimzewski and published in 1995 (see the corresponding Phys. Rev. Lett. paper). This was the conclusion of 10 years of research started at IBM TJ Watson, using the scanning tunnelling microscope tip apex to switch a single molecule as already explored by A. Aviram, C. Joachim and M. Pomerantz at the end of the 1980s (see their seminal Chem. Phys. Lett. paper during this period). The trick was to use an UHV Scanning Tunneling microscope to allow the tip apex to gently touch the top of a single molecule adsorbed on an Au(110) surface. A resistance of 55 MOhms was recorded along with a low voltage linear I-V. The contact was certified by recording the I-z current distance property, which allows measurement of the deformation of the cage under contact. This first experiment was followed by the reported result using a mechanical break junction method to connect two gold electrodes to a sulfur- terminated molecular wire by Mark Reed and James Tour in 1997. Recent progress in nanotechnology and nanoscience has facilitated both experimental and theoretical study of molecular electronics. Development of the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and later the atomic force microscope (AFM) have greatly facilitated manipulating single-molecule electronics. Also, theoretical advances in molecular electronics have facilitated further understanding of non-adiabatic charge transfer events at electrode-electrolyte interfaces. A single-molecule amplifier was implemented by C. Joachim and J.K. Gimzewski in IBM Zurich. This experiment, involving one molecule, demonstrated that one such molecule can provide gain in a circuit via intramolecular quantum interference effects alone. A collaboration of researchers at Hewlett- Packard (HP) and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), led by James Heath, Fraser Stoddart, R. Stanley Williams, and Philip Kuekes, has developed molecular electronics based on rotaxanes and catenanes. Work is also occurring on the use of single-wall carbon nanotubes as field-effect transistors. Most of this work is being done by International Business Machines (IBM). Some specific reports of a field-effect transistor based on molecular self- assembled monolayers were shown to be fraudulent in 2002 as part of the Sch√∂n scandal. Until recently entirely theoretical, the Aviram-Ratner model for a unimolecular rectifier has been confirmed unambiguously in experiments by a group led by Geoffrey J. Ashwell at Bangor University, UK. Many rectifying molecules have so far been identified, and the number and efficiency of these systems is growing rapidly. Supramolecular electronics is a new field involving electronics at a supramolecular level. An important issue in molecular electronics is the determination of the resistance of a single molecule (both theoretical and experimental). For example, Bumm, et al. used STM to analyze a single molecular switch in a self-assembled monolayer to determine how conductive such a molecule can be. Another problem faced by this field is the difficulty of performing direct characterization since imaging at the molecular scale is often difficult in many experimental devices.

He was a member of the Galway panel from 2000 to 2012. He plays his club football with Mountbellew-Moylough. Playing career Bergin's rise at a young age was meteoric. He burst onto the scene in 2000 as part of a Galway side that reached that year's All-Ireland Senior Football Championship final; losing to Kerry after a replay. A regular in the team during that campaign as a replacement for the injured Kevin Walsh, Bergin made a quick impression. Standing at 6\\"4, he has height but he also showed that he possessed good football skills and had a penchant for kicking valuable points. At this time, Bergin was a key member of the Galway Under-21 team and his impressive performances for the Under-21s as they secured a Connacht title showed the Senior Management team that he deserved a starting place in Galway's Championship campaign in their first game against New York. In the three games that followed, Sligo, Leitrim and Kildare, Bergin cemented his place as a regular in the side, despite his relative experience at the Senior inter- county level. That year culminated in an All-Ireland Final against Kerry. Unfortunately for Bergin and Galway, Kerry were triumphant in the replay. That year, he was named the All Stars Young Footballer of the Year. The next year, Bergin was an assured starter but Galways campaign to go one better in 2001 came unstuck after an unexpected defeat to Roscommon in Tuam. Galway had to go through the newly introduced qualifiers to have any chance of All-Ireland glory. Their quest began to pick up momentum with victories over Wicklow, Armagh, and Cork. They exacted revenge over Roscommon in the quarter finals with a 0-14 to 1-06 victory. A late comeback, inspired by Derek Savage, gave Galway a three-point victory over Derry in the semi-final. Galway were in their 3rd All-Ireland final in 4 years, and Bergin was an influential player on their way to the final, scoring 0-09 along the way. In the final against Meath, who had annihilated reigning champions Kerry in the other semi-final, Galway outclassed the Meath team in some style, winning by 9 points, 0-17 to 0-08. Bergin contributed with 2 points, making up for his disappointment the previous year when he did not start in the Replay against Kerry. He finished as Galways 2nd top scorer that year behind P√°draic Joyce In 2002, Galway secured another Connacht title but lost to Kerry in the quarter finals. However, redemption arrived on the Under-21 scene for Bergin. He captained the team on their way to a 0-15 to 0-08 victory over a much fancied Dublin side. In recent years, Galway have failed to reach the same heights as their early millennium triumphs. They have failed to go past the quarter final stage, losing to Donegal after a replay in 2003, and to Cork in 2005. Although Bergin is a key member of the Galway team, he has lacked a partnership in the midfield similar to the one he enjoyed with Se√°n √ì Domhnaill and Kevin Walsh at the start of his career. Injuries to Bergin have also dented Galway's progress in the Championship in recent years. During Peter Forde's time in charge, Galway reached 3 Connacht finals but won just one of those, against Mayo in 2005. In 2006 and 2007, Galway lost their first qualifier after both Connacht Final disappointments. Although Liam Sammon has brought success and a positive outlook to Galway football since his appointment in September 2007, Bergin has seen much of it from the sideline. On 6 April 2008, Bergin suffered an Achilles tendon injury in a League game against Mayo. After he underwent surgery, it was expected he would be out for four months. So far, Bergin has missed the rest of the 2008 National League season and Galway's 3 games in the Championship, where they went on to win their first Connacht title in 3 years with a 2-12 to 1-14 victory over Mayo. It was reported that he had regained full fitness and could play some part in Galway's quarter-final clash against Kerry in August. Bergin won a place on the bench for the showdown and was introduced in the second half for Paul Conroy. Not long after his introduction, a long high ball from P√°draic Joyce dropped towards the Kerry goal and Bergin managed to fist it past Declan O'Sullivan to give Galway a two-point lead. However, they could not make their advantage count as Kerry ran out 1-21 to 1-16 winners at the final whistle. Bergin is also a nephew of former Tipperary hurling captains Jack and Liam Bergin, and a cousin to former Meath footballer Paul Shankey In October 2012 Bergin announced his retirement from Inter-County football after 12 years on the panel.

Potential closure In early April 2008, a private meeting was held between the Ministry of Education, the Makoura College Board of Trustees chairperson and the Wairarapa College board chairperson. Since the meeting, the Makoura College Board has disclosed that it feels that the college should be merged with nearby Wairarapa College or closed. The board blamed the closure on a declining roll, which it suggested was the result of a declining population and \\"the socio-economic, racist and snobbish attitudes that have developed in Masterton around the so-called East/West divide\\". A public meeting was held to discuss the consultation, and submissions were invited to the Board of Trustees, with approximately 225 being received. College students initiated a petition in support of the school, which received approximately 7,512 signatures. Local Member of Parliament John Hayes came out in support of the school and suggested the replacement of the school's management. On 7 August 2009, the Board of Trustees announced its resignation The Board was replaced by commissioner Tim White. The Principal, Chris Scott, also resigned and was replaced in December 2008. Former pupil Jemaine Clement and Flight of the Conchords partner Bret McKenzie played a concert to an audience of 2,000 on 31 March 2009, raising 70,000 dollars for the school.

Founding members Aaron Bruno and Drew Stewart began playing together while attending Westlake High School, where their early project was known as the Ice Monkeys. They were greatly influenced by the success of Southern California punk bands of the early 1990s and the grunge aesthetic popularized by bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam. With the later addition of bassist Todd Burns and drummer Ray Blanco the band re-christened themselves as Insurgence. As Insurgence they began playing famous California venues, including The Roxy Theatre and Whisky a Go Go. When the band began work on their demo EP they again changed their name, this time to Home Town Hero. In 2000 and 2001, Home Town Hero joined the Vans Warped Tour, where they attracted the attention of Madonna's Maverick Records label. The band's eponymous major label debut was heavily promoted by Warner Bros.

It is the first part of the Crosstime Traffic series.http://www.uchronia.net/label/turtcrosst.html Plot summary In the novel, Jeremy and Amanda Solter are two teenagers living in the late 21st century. Their parents work for Crosstime Traffic, a trading company using time travel to go back and forth from parallel versions of Earth to trade for resources to help sustain their version of Earth. One summer, the children work with their parents, going to Polisso - in our timeline a village in Romania with the ancient Porolissum ruins nearby, in the alternate timeline a major city of a Roman Empire that never collapsed. In the intervening centuries, the Romans advanced to the extent of inventing gunpowder - hence the title of the book - putting their armies on about 17th Century level. By 2100, they had not, however, gone through an industrial revolution and much of their social institutions, in particular slavery, remain much as they were in earlier Roman times. North of the Roman Empire, a rival Lietuvan Empire has grown up similar to a still surviving Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, with occasional wars breaking out between the two. It is said that most of these wars would end in an exchange of border provinces. Romans consider the Lietuvans as \\"barbarians\\", though in fact the two have much the same level of technology and culture. When the youngsters' mother becomes sick, their father takes her back to their home time for treatment, expecting to come back in a few days - but the cross-time travel equipment suffers a break in link, stranding Jeremy and Amanda in Polisso just as the Lietuvan Army crosses the border, placing Polisso under siege. At the same time, the Roman authorities begin to grow suspicious of their trade mission and the origin of such items as watches and Swiss army knives which they offer for sale and which no artisan in the Empire can match. Map of Europe in 2100 CE in the book. Dark blue areas are areas under Roman control; blue areas are areas speculated to be under Roman control, but are not mentioned; brown areas are the Lietuvans; whereas light blue areas are contested areas between the Romans and Lietuvans Reception Roland J.

This is a rousing story that reminds us that \\"adventure\\" really is someone else in deep trouble a long way off.\\" Don D'Ammassa in his review for the Journal Chronicle praised the novel saying \\"I really enjoyed this one, which had lively characters and events, and whose setting seemed much more interesting and better realized than that in the author's other recent novels.\\" See also * Romanitas * Warlords of Utopia * Roma Eterna * Oath of Empire * Germanicus trilogy * Agent of Byzantium * Bread and Circuses (Star Trek: The Original Series) * Gunpowder empires (actual historical empires) NotesReferencesExternal links *Review by Steven H Silver * Category:2003 science fiction novels Category:2003 American novels Category:Alternate history novels set in ancient Rome Category:Crosstime Traffic novels Category:Novels by Harry Turtledove Category:Tor Books books ","title":"Gunpowder Empire"},{"id":"18695910","text":"Flatwillow (also Flatwillow Crossing) is a former unincorporated town in southern Petroleum County, Montana, United States.

The export name for this variant is the AIMS-74.http://www.militaryfactory.com/smallarms/detail.asp?smallarms_id=935 History As the Soviet Union switched from the 7.62√ó39mm caliber AKM to the 5.45√ó39mm caliber AK-74, it encouraged other nations of the Warsaw Pact to follow suit. By the mid 1980s, Romania decided to switch calibers, however it was decided that the new rifle would be developed independently, and not represent a clone of the Soviet AK-74. In doing so, the PA md. 86 has several anachronistic AKM elements that were found only on the prototype Soviet AK-74. Features The most easily recognized AKM feature is the gas block design (45 degree versus 90 degree). Incidentally, although the gas block is purely AKM, the gas vent in the barrel did change to a 90-degree design to minimize bullet shearing (a problem with early Soviet AK-74s with 45-degree gas blocks). This means the Romanian PA md. 86 has a double-angle gas port, which makes it much harder to clean the gas vent. This variant also uses the AK-47 rear trunnion, and thus the siderail is lengthened. It uses either a \\"bird cage\\" flash suppressor, or a flash hider (designed for Special Forces). The design also incorporates an upward-curved charging handle, a wire side-folding stock (based on the East German design, but offset slightly to the left), and a traditional vertical handgrip. The md. 86 uses laminated wood lower handguards, and Bakelite pistol grips and upper handguards. None of the components have had any polymer versions. The AG-40 grenade launcher can be attached as a lower handguard after removing the standard one. Lasers/lights can also be clamped to the barrel in two ways. The rifle is one of only a few AK versions that have a 3-round burst option, with the Polish Tantal being the only other Warsaw Pact variant. The burst mode is achieved through a ratcheting device on the left side of the receiver that interacts with the trigger group on the trigger-disconnector and hammer pins.Value of Romanian 3 round burst Kit? Its location eliminates the need for an anti-pin walkout device, such as a Shepard's Crook on semi-auto AKs and extended auto sear spring on full-autos. It also has an advantage to the M16 Rifle's burst mode in that releasing the trigger in the middle of a burst (1-2 shot fired instead of full 3) causes the ratchet to reset making the next 3-round burst a new, full one instead of a continuation of the previous. The Tantal functions in a similar manner with ratcheting device on trigger-disconnector and hammer pins, though has a separate safety and selector switch and eliminates the Rate Reducer.wz.88 Tantal - A Tantalean Ordeal The safety stop is cut lower allowing the selector to travel further down just off the edge of the receiver for its burst mode position and as such has the following markings, from top to bottom: ‚àû, 1, 3. Only ribbed steel magazines are used. Combat divers also use a version with straight handguards, as the forward grip is considered to be cumbersome for amphibious operations. Variants=Carbine version This rifle also has a rarely seen short-barrel version, PM md. 94 (model 94 submachine gun), where the front sight is placed on the gas block, with the gas tube being shortened. This version uses straight laminated wood handguards. Civilian variants The 5.45√ó39mm civilian export versions are: Romak 992, Romak 2, Intrac Mk II, CUR-2, WUM-2, SAR 2, and the WASR 2 which is the current production rifle. The WASR 2 does not have a dimpled receiver, unlike previous models. 5.45 mm RPK The RPK version of the md. 86 is called the md. 93. It features a long reinforced receiver, a carry handle, and a bipod. An earlier, short-lived version used a fire control group similar to the 7.62 mm md. 64, \\"Safe ‚Äì Auto ‚Äì Single\\".

Since 2003 he has worked with Abdullah Muhsin of the Iraqi Workers Federation. Critical of the blanket labelling of advocates of military intervention against dictatorial regimes as neoconservatives in foreign policy, he calls for a \\"proper consideration of the social democratic antitotalitarianism of Paul Berman, V√°clav Havel, Adam Michnik, Ladan Boroumand, Kanan Makiya, Azar Nafisi, Bernard Kouchner, Tony Blair, or Gordon Brown\\" and points out that \\"neo-conservatives\\" in the Democratic Party deserve \\"their share of the credit\\" for \\"undermining cynical and self-defeating 'realism' and embracing democracy-promotion.\\" He is 'a long time socialist and a supporter of Palestinian statehood' and is an activist for the two states for two peoples solution to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict. The Dissent Editor and US political philosopher Michael Walzer argued Johnson's Democratiya was similar to Dissent in politics and style. 'Two commitments give shape to the Democratiya project. The first is to defend and promote a left politics that is liberal, democratic, egalitarian, and internationalist. Those four adjectives should routinely characterize left politics, but we all know that they don‚Äôt. The second commitment is to defend and promote a form of political argument that is nuanced, probing, and concrete, principled but open to disagreement: no slogans, no jargon, no unexamined assumptions, no party line. This argumentative style . . . is also a moral style.'Source Michael Walzer, Preface in Global Politics Since 9/11: The Democratiya Interviews (Foreign Policy Centre, 2007). https://fpc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/901.pdf In his A Foreign Policy for the Left, Michael Walzer wrote of Johnson's influence. 'I have also learned a great deal from two very different sets of friends in Great Britain, the authors of the Euston and Kilburn Manifestoes.

Some boy actors, like John Honyman and Stephen Hammerton, filled female roles for only three to five years before switching to male roles; others, like Richard Sharpe, appear to have continued in women's roles for a decade. Thompson is known to have played women for at least ten years, if not more. Beginnings Thompson began as an apprentice of veteran comedian and teacher John Shank. In 1636, Shank claimed in legal testimony to have spent ¬£40 to acquire Thompson as an apprentice. (Apprentices' contracts were sometimes purchased from their \\"masters,\\" as with the case of Stephen Hammerton.) According to the cast list in the 1623 first edition of Webster's The Duchess of Malfi, Thompson played Julia, the \\"Cardinals Mis.\\" This is Thompson's earliest known part. The cast list refers to two separate productions, the original of c. 1614 and a revival of c. 1621. When different actors played a role in the two stagings, the list identifies them: the parts of Ferdinand, the Cardinal, and Antonio were filled by different actors in the two productions.F. E. Halliday, A Shakespeare Companion 1564-1964, Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; p. 144. The cast list gives the role of the Cardinal's mistress Julia to Thompson in both productions; but this has been greeted with skepticism by some commentators, who think Thompson played the role only in the revival of c. 1621.Colin Gibson, ed., Six Renaissance Tragedies, New York, St. Martin's Press, 1997; p. 243. C. 1614 is an early date for the start of Thompson's career, but it is not impossible, and no evidence contradicts the idea. Middle years Thompson's last known female role was as Panopia in the company's production of Wilson's The Swisser in 1631. In between he had roles in Ford's The Lover's Melancholy, and in The Lovers' Progress, The Maid in the Mill, and The Pilgrim, three plays in the canon of John Fletcher and his collaborators. He also played Domitia in The Roman Actor (1626), and Honoria in The Picture (1629), both by Philip Massinger, plus Cleonarda in Carlell's The Deserving Favourite (also 1629) and Miniona Undermine in Clavell's The Soddered Citizen (1630). Thompson appears to have had a penchant for playing formidable and dominant women, like Honoria the queen or Cleonarda the huntress. More conventionally female roles went to other boy actors. This must reveal something about Thompson's personal characteristics and acting skills. It may also suggest other parts he could likely have taken. For example, no cast information survives for the King's Men's production of Massinger's The Duke of Milan (c. 1622); but Marcelia, the heroine in that play, is another formidable beauty like Cleonarda or Honoria, and a role that Thompson might have played. Last years Thompson fades from view after 1631; but the very patchy records of the era may obscure the fact that he simply continued acting. He was named a Groom of the Chamber on 15 April 1633, which certainly suggests a continuing career. (Actors were sometimes rewarded with the honorific post; Honyman was named a Groom of the Chamber along with Thompson, and five King's Men became Grooms in January 1641.) The parish records of St. Giles without Cripplegate, which was the home of many theatre people of the day and located near the Fortune Playhouse, note two Thompson daughters in 1631 -- the christening of Anne on 16 July and the burial of Lettice on 1 October. Thompson's funeral was held in the same parish on 13 December 1634.G. E. Bentley, \\"Records of the Players in the Parish of St. Giles, Cripplegate,\\" Papers of the Modern Language Association Vol. 44 No. 3 (September 1929), pp. 789-826.

A follower of Leopold von Ranke, he introduced the scientific study of history in the Netherlands when he was professor of Dutch national history () at Leiden University. Biography Fruin, a lifelong bachelor, studied classical philology at Leiden University from 1842, and received his Ph.D. on 18 December 1847 with a dissertation on Manetho, entitled De Manethone Sebennytha. As he was a man of independent means, he spent the next two years in independent studies and political pursuits in Utrecht, before he accepted a position as praeceptor (teacher) in history at Leiden Gymnasium in 1850. These were tumultuous times in Dutch constitutional history as the liberal 1848 Dutch constitutional reform by Johan Rudolf Thorbecke had just been completed, and was the subject of heated political debate. In this debate Fruin took the liberal side and he conducted a learned polemic with a fellow eminent Dutch historian, who was also a leader of the Conservative opposition to the new political ideas, Guillaume Groen van Prinsterer. Though the polemic was courteous, it would inaugurate a certain coolness in the professional and personal relationships between the two men, that would last during their careers.Muller, p. 14 They would cross swords in their professional fields also. Groen van Prinsterer had a style of historiography that was more poetic than Fruin thought appropriate. He shared that style with the American historian John Lothrop Motley who would use his archival work on William the Silent in his own work on the Dutch Republic: The Rise of the Dutch Republic, which caused a furore in the Netherlands. Though Fruin had much sympathy for Motley's work, he also was prompted by it to do his own original research on the events leading up to the Dutch Revolt, and on the crucial years of that Revolt, which led him to completely different conclusions. He published these in Het Voorspel van den Tachtigjarigen oorlog (Prologue to the Eighty Years' War) and Tien jaren uit den Tachtigjarigen oorlog (Ten years from the Eighty Years' War).Muller, pp. 16‚Äì20 In a later review of Motley's History of the United Netherlands Fruin politely criticized Motley's tendency to take highly partisan points of view (however flattering those might be to Dutch national heroes) and his regrettable habit of introducing events that made \\"good stories\\" but never actually happened.Fruin, \\"Motley's Geschiedenis der Vereenigde Nederlanden\\", in: De Gids. Jaargang 1862 (1862) In his inaugural oration (held on 1 July 1860) after his appointment as the first professor of Dutch national history at Leiden University on 20 February 1860 (which was preceded by his promotion to prorector of his gymnasium in 1859), which was entitled Onpartijdigheid van den geschiedschrijver (Impartiality of the historian), Fruin defended the point of view that historians needed to be impartial in their historiography. He did not deny that pure objectivity was an unattainable ideal, and he himself was known for his partisan standpoints, but he thought that historians should take the point of view of their subjects into account, even if they vehemently disagreed with that point of view, and try to represent it in a fair way.Muller, pp. 20‚Äì21 As such he showed himself to be an adept of Leopold von Ranke, whom he highly esteemed.Muller, pp. 22, 58 He helped introduce Ranke's ideas about historiography in the Netherlands and to spread his influence on Dutch historiography in the second half of the 19th century, giving the Dutch profession of historiography a more \\"scientific\\" flavor. Fruin was not a very inspiring lecturer. His lectures were better known for their thoroughness and quality, than for their oratory. Nevertheless, he was popular as a professor. The same thoroughness that characterized his lectures, also characterized his historical research. He was averse to writing large historical handbooks, preferring the elegant little monograph, of which he published many in the literary magazine De Gids, and in the specialized historical journal Nijhoff's Bijdragen. He specialized in certain historical periods and subjects, like the early years of the Dutch Republic and the stadtholderate of stadtholder William III. He limited his academic subject, Vaderlandsche Geschiedenis to the history of the Dutch Republic, ending in 1795, as he thought more recent history (which, after all, was only half a century old in his time) as yet too unsettled to be properly handled. Beside his interpretive historical work, he also published two important compilations of sources: * the Informacie van 1514 (a compilation of economic statistical material the Burgundian authorities in the province of Holland undertook in 1514 as a preliminary to a tax reform), and a similar survey from the 1490s;Muller, p. 33 * Annalen van Dusseldorp (a heavily edited ancient chronicle).Muller, p. 46 His defense of impartiality in historiography as a matter of principle did not prevent him from taking a stand occasionally, if he felt truth and fairness made it necessary. His polemics with Catholic revisionist historians of the time, about what he felt were their distortions of historical truth in their support of the struggle for Emancipation of the long-repressed Catholic minority in the Netherlands, are legendary. Though as a liberal he sympathized with their political objectives, he objected to what he saw as slanders of his historical heroes. To show that he could give Catholics their due he wrote his article De Gorcumsche martelaren (The martyrs of Gorkum) in 1865, about a famous atrocity perpetrated against Catholic priests by the Sea Beggars.Muller, pp. 36‚Äì37 Another characterizing example is the altercation he had with general Willem Jan Knoop, a Dutch military historian, about the question whether stadtholder William III had known of the fact that the Treaty of Nijmegen had already been signed, when he fought the bloody Battle of Saint-Denis (1678). Fruin thought that William spoke the truth when he swore that he had not known. However, new material brought to light that he must have known, and this so shocked Fruin's faith in William that he everafter displayed a distinct coolness to this heretofore revered subject.Muller, pp. 48‚Äì49 Fruin reluctantly retired from his professorship in 1894, when he reached the mandatory retirement age of 70. In his Afscheidsrede (Farewell Address) of June 1, 1894, he was able to point to the many advances Dutch historiography had made during his professional career. This was mainly thanks to him, but he was too modest to claim it was all his doing, or even that he had founded a \\"school\\".Muller, p. 61 He died five years later after a short illness. His successor was P.J. Blok.

DPEN exists as three stereoisomers: meso and two enantiomers S,S- and R,R-. The chiral diastereomers are used in asymmetric hydrogenation. Both diastereomers are bidentate ligands. Preparation and optical resolution 1,2-Diphenyl-1,2-ethylenediamine can be prepared from benzil by reductive amination. DPEN can be obtained as both the chiral and meso diastereomers, depending on the relative stereochemistry of the two CHPhNH2 subunits. The chiral diastereomer, which is of greater value, can be resolved into the R,R- and S,S- enantiomers using tartaric acid as the resolving agent. In methanol, the R,R enantiomer has a specific rotation of [Œ±]23 +106¬±1¬∞. Asymmetric catalysis N-tosylated derivative, TsDPEN, is a ligand precursor for catalysts for asymmetric transfer hydrogenation.

It is the first novel in the series to have more than one narrator and the first to include a male narrator. Plot introduction Half-demon tabloid reporter Hope Adams has a secret. Like full demons, she loves chaos. She thrives on it. She needs it. Most of the time, Hope feeds the hunger by helping the interracial council. But it's never enough. So when Benicio Cortez offers her a job infiltrating a gang of young supernaturals, she thinks she's found the perfect solution. Instead, she finds a tinderbox of greed, desire and ambition. And when it ignites, a world is going to explodeFrom \\"Personal Demon\\" website Plot summary The initial story is mainly narrated by Hope Adams an Expiso half-demon with other events being narrated by Lucas Cortez, a sorcerer. In the latter parts of the story the narrating is more evenly distributed between the two characters. Chapters narrated by Hope are given chapter titles while those narrated by Lucas are given chapter numbers. Hope Adams works as a tabloid journalist for the fictional newspaper True News and also for the inter-racial council. Hope's Expiso half-demon nature gives her the ability to sense other supernatural's powers, detect chaos and experience visions of chaotic events. While investigating a story she is approached by Benicio Cortez, CEO of the Cortez cabal and father of Lucas Cortez, with an offer of a job which would repay Hope's debt to him. A rebel gang of young supernaturals led by Guy Benoit has come to notice of the Cortez cabal. The job offer is simple - to investigate the rebel gang. But the bigger worry is if Hope will be able to keep her instinct and lust for chaos in check. As Hope discovers more about the gang and starts a relationship with a particularly charismatic member Jaz, her ex lover, the werewolf thief Karl Marsten, arrives to help and honour his half of the debt. The two find the situation may not be as simple as they thought. With Hope infiltrating the gang, two members of the gang are abducted and a third killed, apparently by the Cortez cabal. This prompts Lucas Cortez and Paige Winterbourne to come to Miami to help Hope and Karl before a war between the rebels and the cabal can destroy them all.

Ninotsminda Cathedral is highly significant to the development of Georgian architecture, as it predates Jvari Monastery in Mtskheta, and served as a model for the development of the later tetraconch (four-apse) form. The site is ruins today, with only the eastern apse and a portion of the western wall remaining. The ruined apse is decorated with 16th century frescos of the Hodegetria, severely vandalised with bullet holes from Dagestani bandits in the 18th and 19th centuries. Outlines of the foundations indicate that the church originally had an octagonal center, surrounded by corner niches. Historical records indicate that restoration work was undertaken in the 10th and 11th centuries, and also during 1671 and 1774. However, the cathedral collapsed during earthquakes in 1824 and 1848 and was not reconstructed. The large brick belltower within the same complex dates from the reign of King Levan of Kakheti (1520-1574). The lower three stories served as a residence, each floor with a fireplace. The staggered placement of bricks on the exterior fa√ßade to form geometric patterns indicates the cultural influence of Safavid Persia, as does the pointed arch over the entrance. The Ninotsminda complex is surrounded by a fortification, with corner towers and a crenellated curtain wall, dating from the 16th-17th centuries. The fortified entrance gate has protruding towers with beehive machicolations. The complex is currently operated as a nunnery by the Georgian Orthodox Church, and reconstruction work is underway.

(July 18, 1935 ‚Äì April 2, 2008) was an American physician and attorney in Orange County, California who established a legal medicine bioethics educational program at the Western University of Health Sciences in Pomona, California, formerly COMP. Early life Dr. Cifarelli was born in his parent's New York City home on July 18, 1935. The son of an Italian immigrant father, Dr. Cifarelli spent his youth in Jackson Heights, New York. In 1952 at 16 years of age he entered the Men's Light- Heavyweight Division of the Golden Gloves Boxing league where he earned an impressive winning record over a short boxing career in which he was never knocked down and lost only one bout. Throughout his young adulthood Dr. Cifarelli spent time working in the Roman Bronze Works foundry, the oldest and longest running foundry in America, in Brooklyn, New York, which was owned and operated by his maternal uncle and which produced some of the most notable bronze sculptures of the 20th Century, including the Heisman Trophy, the statue of Thomas Jefferson in the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C., the Iwo-Jima Memorial In Washington, D.C., the statue of Atlas at Rockefeller Center, New York and many other iconic pieces. It was there where Dr. Cifarelli developed an interest in bronze sculpture that lasted throughout his lifetime. Education and Early Medical Career Dr. Cifarelli showed very little ability or interest in academics during his schooling through high school. Rather, he interacted with a \\"tough crowd\\" often getting into many physical confrontations all the way through high school‚Äîhe barely graduated and had numerous disciplinary issues. Consequently, the high school guidance counselor recommended Cifarelli pursue a career involving manual labor and upon graduation gave him an application to the Sanitation Department for the City of New York. This clearly was a turning point in Cifarelli's life and was the beginning of a lifelong pursuit of education and knowledge. Upon graduation from high school Cifarelli did not have high enough grades for general admission to college. Instead, he was allowed to enroll in two college courses on a probationary status during the summer immediately following high school graduation. He earned straight A's in the courses and was accepted into the University; within one year his performance earned him an academic scholarship. Dr. Cifarelli majored in Biology at Long Island University while working nights as an attendant at the famed Metropolitan Opera House in New York City, where he developed a lifelong love of opera. His honors for academic achievement included earning a Departmental Medal in Biology which was presented to him by William Zeckendorf. A natural linguist, Dr. Cifarelli read, wrote and spoke four languages. He spoke two different dialects of Italian and understood and was semi-conversational in Latin. He was so proficient in French that after his first year of studies in college he became the preferred student-substitute for French class at all levels on campus. He went on to attend medical school at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. On a visit home during medical school he met Jean Abitabile, a New York native, whom he later married. After graduating from Georgetown, Dr. Cifarelli returned to New York City, where he practiced medicine for several years, working with well-known New York physicians including Dr. Philip A. LoPresti. During this period Dr. Cifarelli, in collaboration with others, became involved developing and testing the gastroscope, the medical device now commonly used to screen patients for colon cancer. Dr. Cifarelli earned his reputation as one of the pioneers of the medical specialty of Gastroenterology working in many hospitals in Brooklyn and Queens, N.Y. including St. Mary's Hospital in Brooklyn, N.Y. where he founded the Gastroenterology Clinic and served as Chief of the Department. Military Service - Vietnam and the Persian Gulf War In 1966, recognizing the dire need created by the Vietnam War for physicians in the military, Dr. Cifarelli voluntarily enlisted in the United States Army. He served in Vietnam from 1966 through 1967, attaining the rank of Captain and serving as Chief of Medicine at the 67th Evac. Hospital in QuiNan, Vietnam. He was awarded a Bronze Star and a Letter of Commendation for his service during the war. Dr. Cifarelli's respect and admiration for military service never faded. In 1982 he re-joined the Army, in its reserve unit as a Lt. Colonel. Two years later he attained the rank of full Colonel and continued to serve in the U.S. Army Reserves Medical Corps through most of the 1990s. During that period he was named Chief of Medicine and later Commander of the 349th General Hospital in Los Angeles, a unit called to serve in the Persian Gulf War. He also commanded the 458th MASH Unit and later served as a Consultant to the U.S. Army Surgeon General, obtaining a top secret clearance at the Pentagon. As the millennium arrived Dr. Cifarelli finally retired from the military. Move to California In December 1970 Dr. Cifarelli moved his wife and four children to California where his medical career flourished. Through the 1970s and 1980s Dr. Cifarelli served as Chief of Medicine and Chief of Staff at several Orange County hospitals including Good Samaritan Hospital in Anaheim, California. At Good Samaritan in 1978 Dr. Cifarelli met and befriended Ferdinand Waldo Demara aka \\"the Great Imposter,\\" who was serving as the hospital's chaplain. Recognizing that Demara did not appear to have any family or close relationships, Dr. Cifarelli began regularly inviting Demara to family gatherings at his home. As Chief of Staff, Dr. Cifarelli was also instrumental in helping secure for Demara a place to live in the hospital, where Demara later died. In the 1970s Dr. Cifarelli began teaching clinical medicine at U.C. Irvine Medical School and legal medical subjects at COMP. He ultimately attained the rank of full clinical professor at UCI Medical School and at COMP and held those positions until his death. In 1979 he was named in the First Edition of \\"The Best Doctors of America.\\" Early Legal Career In the mid 1970s Dr. Cifarelli began attending night school at the Western State College of Law, while continuing his busy career as a physician during the day. He passed the bar and began practicing both law and medicine in 1979, becoming one of the first practicing physicians and attorneys in Orange County. He devoted much of his practice to medical malpractice issues. He later moved his law practice to Santa Ana and continued to practice law for several years, joined in the late 1980s by his oldest son Philip C. Cifarelli, J.D. Later Legal Career After a short semi-retirement in the late 1990s, Dr. Cifarelli returned to the practice of law around 2000, joining the law firm run by his sons including well-known child rights attorney Thomas A. Cifarelli, at The Cifarelli Law Firm, LLP.Cifarellilaw.com It was during the second half of his legal career where Dr. Cifarelli took up the cause of representing physicians in legal/ethical issues related to the treatment of patients including the terminally ill. Teaching and Advocating for Patients' Rights Dr. Cifarelli spent much of the second half of his legal and teaching career on bioethics issues on behalf of terminally ill patients seeking the right to die with dignity and the physicians who treat them. Always driven by a love of education and philosophy, Dr. Cifarelli became actively involved with the American College of Legal Medicine, educating practicing physicians and attorneys about cutting edge issues involving Bio-Ethics and the right to death with dignity. He ascended to the rank of President of the American College of Legal Medicine in 2005 and was honored with the organization's Gold Medal for lifetime achievement in March 2008. At COMP Dr. Cifarelli established the school's first Legal Medicine Ethics program in 1978 and taught generations of physicians about the ethical and legal issues doctors face on a daily basis in their care of patients including the terminally ill. Dr. Cifarelli truly loved teaching and his 29 years of lecturing at COMP provided him much joy. In his legal practice Dr. Cifarelli successfully represented many physicians being investigated by the State Medical Board for following patients' wishes and providing advanced end-of-life care to terminally ill and suffering patients. Dr. Cifarelli also promoted awareness of these subjects through his active leadership in the American College of Legal Medicine. Death and Family Dr. Cifarelli was diagnosed with lung cancer in the Summer of 2007. He underwent extensive treatment for the disease until his death. He is survived by his four children Emilia Longo, Nina Longo, Philip C. Cifarelli and Thomas A. Cifarelli, and seven grandchildren Candace, Amanda, Jeanine, Alex, Vincent, Angela and Michael. He is also survived by his younger brother Dr. Albert V. Cifarelli of New York City, and his second wife Barbara.

The game featured the return of local sports announcer Marv Sebring. Sebring was known for a colorful call of local sports and he had an amazing memory for local sports history. For the next two days the station ran a tape loop of three oldies, three country and three random songs asking residents to vote for their favorite format. The oldies format was a fan favorite with a three to one margin over other choices. At 6AM on Monday August 28, 1989 the Zoomer kicked off with a \\"Classic Rock 40\\" oldies format. The original staff members were Rich Gates, Bob James, Andie Germann as the morning team, Rich Vargo afternoons, Larry Miller in the evenings. The remainder of the day was basically music from a syndicated music source but the station was so well programmed that community members would want to visit the on-air personalities that were from Dallas Texas. The transitions were seamless. The first owner of the station was James Phillips a local insurance man and small town, part-time polka announcer. The corporate name was The Great Wireless Talking Machine, inc. Phillips had hopes of bringing polka music to the air in Defiance. His consultant Chris Cage (WBNS, WBYR) recommended hiring Robert Krouse as general manager. Krouse decided on the oldies format from the start since no local station was programming the format at that time. Krouse left the station in July 1991 at that time Phillips added talk to part of the programming and within a year sold the station In a distress sale to Richard McBroom owner of WNDH and WONW.

Born in Adelaide, South Australia, Sir Edward was educated at St Peter's College, Adelaide, where he took up polo among other sports in which he excelled. After completing his education, Hayward worked as a jackaroo in New South Wales for several years. He started in the retail sector for the first time in 1929, working for Sydney Snow and Co. Ltd., and moved back to Adelaide in 1931 to join the family business, John Martin's. One of his first jobs at John Martin's was to visit Canada and the United States to gather ideas from department stores in those countries. It was on this trip that he came up with the idea to start the Adelaide Christmas Pageant, being in particular inspired by the Toronto Santa Claus Parade and by Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City. Since the first pageant in 1933, it has become a much loved Adelaide tradition.The Advertiser (Adelaide, SA : 1931 - 1954), 28 November 1950: NEW COMPANY FOR COCA-COLA During World War II Hayward served in the Australian Army; he was 36 when he enlisted in the army. During the war Hayward noted the popularity of the soft drink Coca- Cola with the Americans. After the war Hayward established a franchise to bottle and sell Coca-Cola in Adelaide. He served either as president or chairman of the franchise for a total of 33 years. Hayward was chairman of the St John Council in South Australia when, in 1952, it became responsible for ambulance services in that state, and he was made a Knight of the Order in 1959. He was made a Knight Bachelor on 10 June 1961. Sir Edward and his wife, Ursula (n√©e Barr-Smith), were art enthusiasts and built up a magnificent art collection in their Adelaide home \\"Carrick Hill\\".

Khoury graduated from Damascus University with a bachelor's degree in French literature and she received a diploma from the school of literature in Beirut. Khoury's notability stirs from her work in politics and literature. Her work as a writer focuses on love and erotica, a subject that was previously taboo in Syrian culture.  Life =Early life Colette was born into a notable family, as her grandfather, Faris al-Khoury is known as a hero for his resistance to the French. In addition, her father had been minister for village and town affairs. Khoury was also very patriotic, as she wrote several collections of stories about the 1973 October War, also known as the Yom Kippur War one of which was called \\"Luminous Days\\" (1984). Writing career Khoury was a pioneer of Arab feminism, and wrote angry stories in the 1950s about men and their selfishness. Khoury's career began in 1957 and has spanned more than 6 decades. Her literary career began with the publication of a collection of poems in French entitled \\"Vingt Ans\\" (Beirut, 1958). In it Khoury expressed her discontent with social constraints and the emptiness and aimlessness of her life; she also described her attempts to find salvation in love. Much of Khoury's work stemmed from her desire to avoid blatant retaliation; writing was the best and only way she could express herself. Khoury dedicated her work to immersing herself in the female psyche, particularly defending women's right to love. Khoury once said, \\"Since I always felt the need to express what was welling up inside me...the need to protest, the need to scream...and since I didn't want to scream with a knife, I screamed with my fingers and became a writer.\\" Many of Khoury's stories covered topics like love and erotica, particularly from a female's perspective. Khoury has written more than 20 novels, as well as many political and literary articles. In 1959, she shocked the Arab world with a novel in which she wrote openly about love; this breakthrough novel Ayyam Maahou (Days With Him) was the first time a woman had audaciously written about a subject considered taboo in conservative Syrian society. Ayyam Maahou was inspired by a love affair with the legendary Syrian poet Nizar Qabbani. Colette created a strong woman in her story whose love was not so overpowering that it blinded her or made her weak, in order to maintain the image of a strong, female leader. In the story, the protagonist and narrator, Rim, against society and her family, as she tries to develop her personal identity. While Rim's parents died when she was young and thus never could dominate her adult life, her father's domineering presence still haunts her after he has passed. Rim is also disgusted by the institution of marriage in its traditional form. In the story, she says forcefully, \\"No! I was not born only to learn cooking and then to marry, bear children, and die! If this is the rule in my country, I will be the exception. I do not want to marry!\\"(22) Two years later, she published \\"Layla wahida\\" (One night, 1961), which told a story about a night that the main character, Rasha, spent with a man who was a pilot in the French air force during World War II. This story was more controversial due to the element of adultery as an aspect of self-enlightenment. Its married heroine, Rasha, tries to find herself and regain control of her life through an extramarital relationship after being forced to prey a 30-year-old man at the age of fifteen. Her husband, Salim, approaches marriage as a business transaction, lacking emotion or compassion. Salim treats Rasha like an object and she expresses her frustration around this by saying, \\"Did you consider even for one day that this woman whom you had brought to supplement the furniture of your house was a human being? That she was a human being, who would a thousand times prefer your sharing of one idea of yours over your offering her the most delicious food\\" (39). Political career From 1990-1995, Colette Khoury served as an independent member of the Syrian parliament. In 2008, Khoury was appointed literary adivisor to the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. She currently writes for the Syrian governmental newspaper Al-Ba'ath on a broad range of political and literary issues. Personal life Khoury has been twice married and divorced to the Spanish musician Rodrigo de Zayas,Crosshatching in Global Culture: A Dictionary of Modern Arab Writers: An Updated English Version of R.B. Campbell's Contemporary Arab Writers, Volume 101, Part 2, page 661 who is a grandson of American diplomat Francis Burton Harrison and the son of Mexican artist Marius de Zayas.

Chicago: Rand McNally, 2008, p. 61. Its elevation is 2,828 feet (862 m). History On September 7, 1865, the right and middle columns of the Powder River Expedition crossed the future site of Powderville while traveling south upriver. That evening, the columns camped several miles to the south and buried three soldiers who had died during the day. The Powder River Telegraph Station was a U.S. Army telegraph repair station that existed from 1878 until 1883 along the Powder River in southeastern Montana Territory. Today the site is within Powder River County. The Powder River Telegraph Repair Station was established on November 1, 1878 by soldiers of the 9th U.S. Infantry from Camp Devin on the right bank of the Powder River in southeastern Montana Territory, along the Black Hills to Fort Keogh telegraph route. Private Leopold Hohman, of Company E, 5th Infantry was assigned to the station on December 20, 1878, and given command. Privates J. Broderick and L. Smith, also of the 5th Infantry, were transferred to the outpost in early 1879 as repairmen, and the line was opened for communication in April. The opening skirmish of the Mizpah Creek Incidents, in which two U.S. Army telegraph repairmen were shot by Cheyenne warriors, took place nearby on April 5, 1879. By 1881, the outpost was \\"supplied with a complete set of telegraph instruments and repair tools\\" and maintained \\"66 miles of wire\\" between the sections of the Little Missouri Telegraph Station and that of Fort Keogh. Private Hohman left the station on April 14, 1881, and was honorably discharged that May, but he didn't leave the Powder River without leaving his mark. On a hill now called Soldiers Mount that overlooks the site of the station on the east side of the Powder River, Hohman carved his name, role, company, regiment, and the years he served the station onto a sandstone boulder that can still be read today. Hohman's rock is located about one mile east of the present-day community of Powderville. After Hohman left, Private Shultz of the 2nd Cavalry took over command of the station, and the force was decreased by one man. By the early 1880s, the route of the telegraph line became the Deadwood-Miles City stagecoach road, and in 1885 the civilian community of Powderville was built adjacent to the station. In 1885 it became a stage stop when the Deadwood to Miles City, Montana stagecoach line was established along the route of the telegraph line, crossing the Powder River at Elkhorn Crossing. The Powder River telegraph repair station was decommissioned in 1883, although U.S. Army troops from Fort Keogh continued operating in the area into the 1890s. Although Powderville is unincorporated, it had a post office with the ZIP code of 59345, from 1885 until 2011.Zip Code Lookup Powderville has its own Boot Hill Cemetery.

It emerged as a response to a series of political, theoretical and organizational discussions between the two currents of Fedaie movement: Organization of Iranian People's Fedai Guerrillas and Fedaian Organization. History The Union of People's Fedaian of Iran emerged from a series of political, theoretical and organizational discussions between the two currents of Fedaie movement: Organization of Iranian People's Fedai Guerrillas and Fedaian Organization. During the last two decades of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's rule, members of these two organizations and other combatants were actively involved in the struggle against his regime. Revolution All of these different groups took part in the Iranian revolution in 1979. Soon after the revolution, they united to fight against the new reactionary regime, which hid itself under the cover of religion. While the group had a favorable social and political position from which to organize the people's resistance against the Islamic despotism and to defend the achievements of the revolution, it failed to achieve its goals. Some surmise that this was due to a lack of necessary political experience, an unclear view of how the people could be organized, and no comprehensive agenda to bring about a free, progressive and just society. In the end, the Islamic medieval dictatorship seemed to benefit from the ignorance and illiteracy of the majority of the population and the organization failed to safeguard the achievements of the revolution. Split The first reaction to this failure resulted in the split of the organization into two parts: the Majority and the Minority. While the split revealed the right and left currents within the organization, a lack of the experience of internal dialogues and democratic standards meant that the splitting currents could not define their ideological, political and organizational differences. This led to more splits within the ranks of the Majority and Minority. Reunification Some people from the left and right currents of previous splits have come back together under the Union of People's Fedaian of Iran banner. The right current that is present in the reunified organization continue to promote reformist and conciliatory policies towards the regime. However, it has clearly distinguished itself both theoretically and ideologically from the Majority. When the dissolution of the Majority section into the Tudeh Party of Iran was proposed, this group split from the Majority in defiance. In the following years this current, having learned its lesson from the previous failures, criticized its past policies and gradually returned to the revolutionary left movement. In 1989, the Fedaie Organization of Iran was formed, as a result of the unity between this organization and the Organization for the Emancipation of Labour. (The latter had been established by the former cadres and members of the Minority.) The left current present in the reunified Union of People's Fedaian of Iran, was initially aligned with the Minority. In spite of its revolutionary stance against the regime, it adopted ultra leftist policies. The Minority also faced several splits because of the lack of a clear agenda. The progress toward reunification of Fedaies was made possible through the revision of the theoretical principles, proposing clear political lines, dispensing with sectarian attitudes toward unity and coalition, learning from the past failures, and achieving principled understanding about democratic relations among the left forces as well as within the organization ranks.

A summed-area table is a data structure and algorithm for quickly and efficiently generating the sum of values in a rectangular subset of a grid. In the image processing domain, it is also known as an integral image. It was introduced to computer graphics in 1984 by Frank Crow for use with mipmaps. In computer vision it was popularized by Lewis and then given the name \\"integral image\\" and prominently used within the Viola‚ÄìJones object detection framework in 2001. Historically, this principle is very well known in the study of multi-dimensional probability distribution functions, namely in computing 2D (or ND) probabilities (area under the probability distribution) from the respective cumulative distribution functions. The algorithm As the name suggests, the value at any point (x, y) in the summed-area table is the sum of all the pixels above and to the left of (x, y), inclusive: : I(x,y) = \\\\sum_{\\\\begin{smallmatrix} x' \\\\le x \\\\ y' \\\\le y\\\\end{smallmatrix}} i(x',y') where i(x,y) is the value of the pixel at (x,y). The summed-area table can be computed efficiently in a single pass over the image, as the value in the summed-area table at (x, y) is just: : I(x,y) = i(x,y) + I(x,y-1) + I(x-1,y) - I(x-1,y-1)\\\\, (Noted that the summed matrix is calculated from top left corner) A description of computing a sum in the summed-area table data structure/algorithm Once the summed-area table has been computed, evaluating the sum of intensities over any rectangular area requires exactly four array references regardless of the area size. That is, the notation in the figure at right, having A=(x0, y0), B=(x1, y0), C=(x0, y1) and D=(x1, y1), the sum of i(x,y) over the rectangle spanned by A, B,C and D is: : \\\\sum_{\\\\begin{smallmatrix} x_0 < x \\\\le x_1 \\\\ y_0 < y \\\\le y_1 \\\\end{smallmatrix}} i(x,y) = I(D) + I(A) - I(B) - I(C) Extensions This method is naturally extended to continuous domains. The method can be also extended to high-dimensional images. If the corners of the rectangle are x^p with p in {0,1}^d, then the sum of image values contained in the rectangle are computed with the formula : \\\\sum_{p\\\\in{0,1}^d }(-1)^{d-\\\\p\\\\_1} I(x^p) \\\\, where I(x) is the integral image at x and d the image dimension. The notation x^p correspond in the example to d=2, A=x^{(0,0)}, B=x^{(1,0)}, C=x^{(1,1)} and D=x^{(0,1)}. In neuroimaging, for example, the images have dimension d=3 or d=4, when using voxels or voxels with a time-stamp. This method has been extended to high-order integral image as in the work of Phan et al. who provided two, three, or four integral images for quickly and efficiently calculating the standard deviation (variance), skewness, and kurtosis of local block in the image. This is detailed below: To compute variance or standard deviation of a block, we need two integral images: : I(x,y) = \\\\sum_{\\\\begin{smallmatrix} x' \\\\le x \\\\ y' \\\\le y\\\\end{smallmatrix}} i(x',y') : I^2(x,y) = \\\\sum_{\\\\begin{smallmatrix} x' \\\\le x \\\\ y' \\\\le y\\\\end{smallmatrix}} i^2(x',y') The variance is given by: : \\\\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\\\mu)^2. Let S_1 and S_2 denote the summations of block ABCD of I and I^2, respectively. S_1 and S_2 are computed quickly by integral image. Now, we manipulate the variance equation as: : \\\\operatorname{Var}(X) = \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i^2 - 2\\\\cdot\\\\mu\\\\cdot x_i + \\\\mu^2) = \\\\frac{1}{n} (\\\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i)^2 - 2\\\\cdot\\\\sum_{i=1}^n(\\\\mu\\\\cdot x_i) + \\\\sum_{i=1}^n(\\\\mu^2)) = \\\\frac{1}{n} (\\\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i)^2 - 2\\\\cdot\\\\sum_{i=1}^n(\\\\mu\\\\cdot x_i) + n\\\\cdot(\\\\mu^2)) : = \\\\frac{1}{n} (\\\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i)^2 - 2\\\\cdot\\\\mu \\\\cdot \\\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i) + n\\\\cdot(\\\\mu^2)) = \\\\frac{1}{n} (S_2 - 2\\\\cdot S_1/n \\\\cdot S_1 + n\\\\cdot((S_1/n)^2)) = \\\\frac{1}{n} (S_2 - (S_1)^2/n) Where \\\\mu=S_1/n and S_2=\\\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i^2). Similar to the estimation of the mean (\\\\mu) and variance (Var), which requires the integral images of the first and second power of the image respectively (i.e. I, I^2); manipulations similar to the ones mentioned above can be made to the third and fourth powers of the images (i.e. I^3(x,y), I^4(x,y).) for obtaining the skewness and kurtosis. But one important implementation detail that must be kept in mind for the above methods, as mentioned by F Shafait et al. is that of integer overflow occurring for the higher order integral images in case 32-bit integers are used.

According to Huntly Thistle's club website, the club beat Pukemiro 6-0 and Hikurangi 4-0 before losing to the eventual finalists North Shore 3-1.http://www.clubwebsite.co.uk/huntlythistleafc/history.pl These teams, and those known to have qualified as regional champions and/or taken part in island finals brings the list of known entrants to 20. One unusual feature of the 1926 competition was that three of the four semi-finalist sides were composed largely of staff from three of the country's largest mental hospitals, at Sunnyside, Porirua, and Seacliff. The 1926 final The final was played at the Basin Reserve, Wellington, a change of venue from the previous finals which had been at Newtown Park or Athletic Park. The following year the final briefly returned to Newtown Park, before making its permanent home at the Basin Reserve, a venue which was used regularly until the 1970s. In the final, played in front of some 4000 spectators, Sunnyside's Archie Trotter became the first player to complete a Chatham Cup final hat-trick. The match was high scoring, but contemporary reports suggest that many opportunities were missed by both teams. H. Pickering put Sunnyside in front after just seven minutes. Archie Trotter doubled the lead for Sunnyside before L. Hipkins scored for North Shore. After the half-time interval Trotter scored two further goals before John Woolley scored a late consolation for North Shore. pp. 67-68 Other notable features of the final included the appearance in the North Shore team of both Reg Baxter and Ces Dacre. Baxter was the first player to play for two different sides in Chatham Cup finals, having been part of the successful Seacliff team in the 1923 final. Dacre, while a fine player and New Zealand representative at football, is best remembered as one of New Zealand's foremost early cricketers.

It is the standard bibliographical tool for research in classical studies. Published in print annually since 1928, with the first volume covering the years 1924‚Äì1926, it is now also available online by institutional or individual subscription. As of June 2014, the electronic version (APh Online) covers volume years 1924 through 2011. The editorial staff gathers each year's additions from 1,500 periodicals, with an additional 500 articles from collections. Overview L'Ann√©e philologique aims to be the most comprehensive international resource for Ancient Greece and Rome. Entries on journal articles are often accompanied by a very brief abstract that may be in a language other than that of the original. Abstracts are most often in French, English, German, Italian, or Spanish. No abstracts for books are provided, but entries on books include a listing of published reviews. Indexing often lags publication by two or three years. Because L'Ann√©e philologique is an index, not a collection, searches find terms only within the bibliographical entry, not the full text of the article (the \\"full text\\" search option refers to the contents of L'Ann√©e philologique). The electronic edition offers a variety of search parameters, with some idiosyncrasies. Since September 2018, the database is available for library subscription via the commercial publisher Brepols Publishers. Between 2013 and 2018, access was provided by another publisher, EBSCO.

It had its headquarters in Chelsea, Massachusetts and all stores were located in the state. On November 18, 2012, all ten stores closed, with six leases being transferred to Austin, Texas-based Whole Foods Market, and two to Quincy-based Stop & Shop; the future of the remaining locations was unknown at the time of closure.  Operation  Foodmaster operated in a grocery marketplace that has a high degree of competition and many competitors, including Shaw's, Stop & Shop, and Market Basket among others. Foodmaster supermarkets were primarily located in shopping centers with other stores. It was unique in terms of its employee dress code. Cashiers and service and grocery clerks were required to wear a black apron, a white collared shirt, and a black bow tie. Also unique was its use of a conveyor belt/rollers for customers‚Äô purchases in early years. Paper bags of groceries were loaded into Postal Service type baskets and sent through a front opening to customers‚Äô cars with the help of employees.  History  John DeJesus Sr. opened his first store in East Cambridge, MA in 1947. At the time of the chain's closure, it was controlled by his son, John DeJesus. The chain operated eleven stores simultaneously at its peak. A location in Swampscott, MA ran from 2000 until 2004, which was converted to a Whole Foods Market upon its closure. As competition in the region increased, Johnnie's experimented with ways to better cater to its clientele. The Revere location was subsequently converted in 2010 to a Save-A-Lot, a discount supermarket brand under license from SuperValu. Johnnie's management intended to review each of the other store's shoppers to determine if any other locations in the chain would be good candidates for conversion as well. Citing the economy and competition from nearby Stop & Shop, PriceRite, and DeMoulas Market Basket locations, the Revere Save-A-Lot closed on February 12, 2012.  Closure  The Melrose store during liquidation. In late August 2012, it was announced that Austin, Texas- based Whole Foods Market was in the early stages of talks to acquire the leases of six of the 10 Johnnie's locations to expand its presence in the region. The fate of the remaining four locations was not disclosed at the time. On October 26, 2012, Johnnie's announced that it had finalized its agreement to sell the leases for its Arlington, Brookline, Charlestown, Melrose, South Weymouth, and Beacon Street Somerville. A week later, it was announced that the remaining stores in Medford, Lynn, Whitman, and Somerville (Alewife Brook Parkway) would be closing as well, with the Medford store becoming a Stop & Shop. Hilco Merchant Resources, an Illinois-based company, was retained to conduct all liquidation sales. The lease for the Alewife Brook Parkway store in Somerville was acquired by Stop & Shop in February 2013.

The program coordinates scientific research and operational support in the region. The program is funded by the Pakistan Science Foundation and the Ministry of Science and Technology. Currently, the PAP maintains and controls two polar stations in the region: the Jinnah Antarctic Station (JNS), and the Polar Research Cell (PRC), which was established by the National Institute of Oceanography to co-ordinate all Antarctic related activities. The Antarctic Programme was launched by the National Institute of Oceanography, with the full support of Pakistan Navy's Naval Weapons Engineering Division (NWED). In 1991, Prime minister Nawaz Sharif established the programme under the direction of the Navy. On 15 June 1992, Pakistan became an Associate Member of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research, but did not accede to the Antarctic Treaty due to economic reasons. In January 1991, Pakistan dispatched its first expedition to Greater Antarctica under the auspices of the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO). As the programme was led by the Navy, the PN dispatched a small group of Pakistan Marines, along with the team of scientists on board the destroyer PNS Tariq and the research vessel PNS Behr Paima. Facilities were quickly established in the region, and Jinnah Antarctic Station (JNS) was commissioned. The station houses an unmanned automatic Weather Station, from which data are transmitted to Pakistan via Argos Satellite System. In 2001, the Badr-B was connected to the Weather Station after it was launched by SUPARCO. In 2006, Pakistan established the National Institute of Oceanography's Polar Research Cell (PRC). A number of national organisations are involved in Antarctic activities and are active participants in the Pakistan Antarctic Programme. Both stations' data are transmitted to Pakistan via the Badr-B Satellite. However, the new Pakistan Remote Sensing Satellite System was launched in late 2011 to replace the Badr satellite system program. Objectives stations on the continent of Antarctica as of 2016. The main objectives of the Pakistan Antarctic Programme are to undertake multidisciplinary research and survey the Antarctic region, with particular attention to geology and geophysics. Studies also include environmental and oceanographic research. Pakistan's research activities are in conformity with the tenets of the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), of which Pakistan is an associate member. Pakistanis have gained experience and capability by launching two major expeditions, thus strengthening Pakistan's ability to conduct research in the harsh Antarctic environment. Apart from this, useful environmental and oceanographic data has been collected in the region, and relevant technical information on Antarctic affairs has been provided to the Pakistani government. Stations Pakistan maintains two summer research stations and one weather observatory in the vicinity of the S√∏r Rondane Mountains, Queen Maud Land, in Eastern Antarctica. The Jinnah Antarctic Station is the centre of most operations, and travel to and from Antarctica is done through the airfield at the JAS. Pakistan is developing a full-fledged permanent base in Antarctica, which will allow researchers to carry out year-round operations.

It is a first-person shooter and beat 'em up game with action RPG elements in which players move through the many floors of an office building shooting terrorists. It is a first- person game where the player character's arms and weapons are visible on screen. In 1991, ADK's Crossed Swords had similar gameplay, but with more RPG elements and hack & slash combat instead of shooting and fist-fighting.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. Movement in the game is done by mainly strafing and only moving forwards or backwards in corridors. Additional moves include ducking, sidestepping and blocking. The player can only progress after all enemies in sight are cleared. Occasionally, the player can move forward into rooms to save hostages or ambush a boss or other enemies. Saving hostages will grant the player healing items, chances to repair or upgrade his weaponry, or random moments of exposition. Eliminating enemies grants the player experience points used to raise a level, granting more power in attacks.The Super Spy user's manual (Neo Geo AES, US) Much of the close combat system resembles Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!. The player's attack variety consists of four types. Punching (which can be upgraded with brass knuckles) includes some special moves: Strong punches and stunning right hook punches. Kicking includes knee smashes. The combat knife is sturdier but loses power and gets rusty the more it is used. The pistol has limited ammo and no recharges but can be used to pistol-whip to conserve shots. Finally from certain hostages the player can gain a submachine gun which has a wider range than the pistol. Firearms can also be used to blow up various explosive materials in the background against enemies. Enemies consist mainly of palette-swapped ski-masked men, ninjas and gunmen who get stronger as the player progresses through the levels. There are occasional sub-bosses including engineers, scientists and strongmen. To finish the game, both bosses in the first mission must be eliminated and all six in the second mission.http://www.neo-geo.com/reviews/neo-reviews/super_spy/superspy.html  Plot  The plot revolves around a C.I.A agent, named Roy Heart,http://www.mobygames.com/game/neo-geo/super-spy who needs to traverse office buildings, and warehouses to stop a group of terrorists, known as the Zolge King terrorist group, led by a man named King (who bears a slight resemblance to Geese Howard in his business suit from the Fatal Fury and The King of Fighters franchises, both also by SNK). The group is responsible for the horrible murders of thousands caused by destroying the subways with bombs. As Mr. Heart, the player hunts through the terrorists' bomb factory for those responsible.  Development and release  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed The Super Spy on their December 15, 1990 issue as being the fifth most-successful table arcade unit of the year, outperforming titles such as Columns and its sequel.

On 13 February 1971, Simmons scored one of the goals as the Fourth Division side won 3‚Äì2 against Don Revie's Leeds to qualify for the quarter-finals of the FA Cup.Football: On this day ‚Äì 13 February 1971, The Independent In March 1973, Simmons moved to Cambridge United, and a year later he moved to Brentford, before returning for a second spell at Cambridge in November 1975. In total, Simmons played 184 league games, scoring 48 goals. He left Cambridge at the end of the 1975‚Äì76 season, and retired from the professional game due to arthritis. He later played for several non-league clubs in Cambridgeshire, including Cambridge City, Newmarket Town, Ely City and Soham Town Rangers. Simmons died in July 2007, following a long battle with cancer, aged 58.

This timeline has often been called the beginning of the freedom movement in Punjab. Important leaders of this movement include Lala Lajpat Rai, Het Thakkar, among others.  Colonisation Bill  The Colonisation Bill was passed in 1906. The Punjab Land Alienation Act, 1900 had already caused a feeling of discontent among the elite urban classes, and the Colonisation Bill provided for transfer of property of a person after his death to the government if he had no heirs. The Government could sell the property to any public or private developer. This was completely against the social conditions prevailing in the region and hence it was rejected by all the sides.  Agitation  The agitation against these measures of the Government was led by Lala Lajpat Rai, he called for \\"extreme measures\\". The first of the protests was organised in the Chenab Colony, which was supposed to be the most affected by this bill. The first protest saw various organisations submitting memoranda to the government to redress their grievances, but the government failed to pay any heed to these documents. This agitation was followed by a protest at Lyallpur. These agitations led to the formation of secret societies like Anjuman-i- Muhibhan-i- Watan, the founder of which was Ajit Singh, a Jat Sikh who was believed to have the backing of Lajpat Rai.This period also saw protest by the working class in railways of Rawalpindi. This period saw mass agitations which finally ended in the deportation of both Rai and Ajit Singh  Rebellion by Jat Paltan  In 1907, around the time of Partition of Bengal (1905), the soldiers of Jat paltan revolted and sided with Bengali revolutionaries to takeover the government treasury. Their revolt was crushed by British colonists and several Jat soldiers had to suffer long imprisonment sentences.Haryana Samvad , Jan 2018.

It serves the City of Lawrence, and, through its membership in the Northeast Kansas Library System (NEKLS), all of the citizens of the NEKLS multi-county regional library system. The library was originally established as a subscription-based library in 1854, but changed to a free public library upon the donation of a new building by Andrew Carnegie in 1904. The Carnegie library was the main headquarters of the NEKLS and the main library in Lawrence until 1972 when a new modern library replaced it. History=1800s The City of Lawrence opened its first library one month after its own founding, in October 1854. Membership at first cost $1 per year with the option of a $25 lifetime membership. The founder of Lawrence, Amos Adams Lawrence, brought a flatboat load of books to bolster the library's collection in 1855. In 1863 the library suffered the fate of many of the city's buildings and burned to the ground as William Quantrill attacked the city, in an event known as the Lawrence massacre. A new library was reorganized the year following out of the house of J. S. Boughton and monies were quickly raised for the construction of a new building. By 1866 a library association was created and a lease on a newly constructed building allowed the library collection a new home. During the new library association's first two years 75 volumes were purchased with an additional 150 donated. The city took over control of the library in September 1871 and moved it into the Lawrence National Bank building where it occupied three rooms on the second floor. 1900sCarnegie Library= The original Carnegie Library While the library was in a stage of renewed growth, its collection quickly outgrew its facilities. With 6,000 volumes there was not enough room to store all the books, and the $1 per year charge per resident was not ample enough to provide funding for a new building. One resident, Peter Emery, was interested in library science and petitioned philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funds dedicated to the erection of a new library. Carnegie agreed to the request and donated $27,500 on the stipulation the city of Lawrence transform it into a free public library and dedicate $2,750 each year to its upkeep and maintenance. This deal was called to a vote in the town and was overwhelmingly accepted. The new building began construction and was dedicated during the week of the semi-centennial celebration of Lawrence. The library officially opened to the public on December 26, 1904. =Period of growth= After the completion of the Carnegie library, the Lawrence Public Library experienced decades of rapid growth. By 1922 interest from children increased at such a rate that a new room was added to the library for their own use. By 1936 40% of the city's population had a library card, and in the following year the building saw a renovation to increase the size of its storage stacks. More improvements were made in 1957 to modernize the building and incorporate more parking and air conditioning. Under the Library Systems Law passed in 1965, public libraries were encouraged to cooperate with each other in making library systems to better serve their populations. Libraries which banded together also became eligible for additional state and federal monies from the Federal Library Services and Construction Act. Due to this, a new cooperative library was formed in 1966 consisting of 30 libraries across 14 counties in Kansas. The new library system was known as the Northeast Kandad Library System (NEKLS) and the headquarters was chosen as the Lawrence Public Library. =New building= Due to increasing space constraints in the Carnegie Library a proposal was made to allocate funds to construct a new building. To keep the history of the Carnegie Library alive the new building would be built in another location close by. In 1970 a citywide vote on a $1,575,000 bond passed with overwhelming success and the new library underwent construction. This building opened in August 1972, and the Carnegie building became the location for the Friends of the Library association. 2000s On November 10, 2010 an $18 million budget was proposed by the Library Board of Trustees on the grounds that since its construction in 1972 the population served had more than doubled. This proposal was accepted by voters later that year and renovations took place over the following four years reaching completion in July 2014. During construction, the library was temporarily housed in the former Borders Books location at 700 New Hampshire Street. Following the renovation, the Lawrence Public Library won the AIA/ALA Library Building Award in 2016. It was also rated 16th place of 50 in \\"50 Best Libraries in America\\" by Elle Decor.

Paroxysmal dyskinesia is a rare disorder, however the number of individuals it affects remains unclear. There are three different subtypes of PD that include paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD), paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD), and paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia (PED). Other neurological diseases have similar symptoms to PD, such as epilepsy and Parkinson's. The different subtypes make accurate and quick diagnosis of PD challenging. Thus, PD is often under reported and misdiagnosed, making it difficult to accurately study its prevalence in human populations. Onset of PD is usually in late childhood to early adolescence. New drug regimens help treat symptoms of PD, but no cure for the disorder is known. Types These movement disorders are classified into three main types based on their triggers and the duration and frequency of the attacks. Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) This is characterized by attacks of involuntary movements (dystonia, chorea, or ballism), which are typically triggered by sudden voluntary movements, but can also be triggered by involuntary movements as well (for example, hyperventilating). These voluntary movements usually involve whole body activity such as standing, walking, and running. The age of onset is typically in childhood or early adolescence with most cases reporting improvement or complete remission with aging. Attacks last from seconds to minutes and are known to be at higher risk of occurring during stress, fear, cold, heat, or menstruation. Paroxysmal non- kinesogenic dyskinesia (PNKD) This is similar to PKD, characterizing as an episodic movement disorder, but is not triggered by voluntary movements. The attacks for PNKD are spontaneous and last from hours to days. It is an autosomal dominant disorder passing to nearly 50% of the offspring. Some predisposing factors include stress, excitement, alcoholic beverages, tea, and beverages with caffeine. Paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia (PED) This is an extremely rare type of paroxysmal dyskinesia characterized by sudden, involuntary, dystonic movements, often including repetitive twisting motions and painful posturing. The attacks are triggered by exercise and other physical exertion, and usually last from minutes to an hour. Attacks usually appear in the body part that is being exercised or exerted over a period of time, perhaps 10 to 15 minutes. Signs and symptoms=PKD The symptoms for PKD are varied from case to case, however, typically they consist of involuntary movements. Such contractile movements include dystonia, chorea, athetosis, and ballism. For example, ‚ÄúHer attacks were characterized as sudden unilateral stiffness of upper and lower limbs followed by an involuntary extrarotation of the arm and leg.‚Äù Another frequently occurring symptom is the presence of an aura before the attack. These sensations manifest in several forms, usually described as a tingling in the target limb. A single limb is the most frequently affected area; however it is possible for an attack to affect more than one limb. When more than one limb is affected, the two limbs are usually unilateral (same side), even though cases of bilateral (opposite sides) symptoms have also been observed. Another frequently affected area is the torso, with some PKD patients twisting their body. Attacks experienced by PKD patients typically last less than a minute, however longer attack can occur. To further distinguish between PKD and epilepsy, patients typically retain consciousness during their attacks, and are able to recall the attacks even after they have ended. Despite retaining consciousness, patients are usually incapable of speech during the attack and may experience great pain in the affected area. The frequency of attacks vary greatly. Some patients have been noted as having hundreds of attacks per day, while others go months without an attack. PNKD The attacks consist of dystonia, chorea, and athetosis just like PKD. They are mostly of the limbs, and are usually unilateral or asymmetric. What sets PNKD apart from PKD is that the attacks can last anywhere from four minutes to four hours, but shorter and longer attacks have been reported as well. The attacks also affect the limbs, usually unilaterally, but bilateral symptoms have also been experienced. PNKD patients usually report the presence of an aura before an attack as well; however they are usually different from those of PKD patients. Once again the aura varies, but is typically felt in the target limb. Another frequently noted aura is dizziness PNKD patients experience attacks that last much longer than those of PKD. These attacks vary in length and can last anywhere between four minutes and four hours. Similar to the difference between length of attacks, the intervals between attacks are much longer. The Interval between PNKD patients‚Äô attacks is from one day to several months. PED PED attacks are characterized in multiple ways. One distinguishing characteristic of PED patients is that they typically experience longer durations of dystonia during their attacks. The most frequent target of attacks are both legs bilaterally, rather than unilateral symptoms. The attacks have also been known to affect the upper half of the body as well. In some cases, patients have had attacks that affected the posturing of their neck and shoulder. Usually there is not an indicative aura symptom prior to a PED attack, which has to do with the nature of the onset of attacks. The duration and frequency of PED attacks fall between those of PKD and PNKD. The attacks can be relieved with rest, typically taking about 10 minutes from cessation of the exercise. Attacks usually do not last longer than 30 minutes. Attacks typically occur at intervals of between a day and a month, however, there is a great deal of variability here. This variability can be contributed to the nature of the onset of attacks. Causes All PD associated subtypes have genetic contributions and are likely to run in a families genetic history due to dominant allele mutations. Mutations of identified genes have been leading areas of research in the study and treatment of paroxysmal dyskinesia. PKD, PNKD, and PED are classified as separate subtypes because they all have different presentations of symptoms, but also, because they are believed to have different pathologies. Studies on diseases that are similar in nature to PD have revealed insights into the causes of movement disorders. Hypnogenic paroxysmal dyskinesia is a form of epilepsy affecting the frontal lobe. Single genes have been identified on chromosomes 15, 20, and 21, which contribute to the pathology of these epilepsy disorders. Utilizing new knowledge about pathologies of related and similar disease can shed insight on the causal relationships in paroxysmal dyskinesia. PKD Numerous causes have been proposed for PKD, such as genetic mutations, multiple sclerosis, brain trauma, and endocrine dysfunction. This is not an exhaustive list; many other causes are being proposed and studied. Until causal genes can be identified, the pathology of PKD will not be fully understood. Researchers have identified specific loci in chromosomes 16 and 22, which have been reported to have a genotype-phenotype correlation. PNKD Research on the pathology for PNKD suggests that mutations to specific nucleotide sequences in chromosome 2, MR-1 (myofibrililogenesis regulator - 1) may be linked to PNKD. Studies on MR-1 reveal that it serves as a detoxifying agent. PNKD is sometimes induced by the consumption of alcohol or coffee. Individuals with a mutation in the MR-1 gene sequence may have problems detoxifying the body when alcohol or caffeine is ingested, perhaps resulting in the onset of PNKD. Other studies have revealed a possible mutation on the calcium sensitive potassium (BK) channel. A mutation affecting the influx and efflux of potassium and calcium can cause large scale changes in a neuron. This specific mutation leads to increased excitability of the neuron, often inducing rapid depolarization eliciting numerous action potentials. The pathogenesis of PKND is partially defined by the identification of mutations in the myofibrillogenesis regulator 1 (MR-1), whose gene product is an enzyme involved in the detoxification of methylglyoxal (a compound present in coffee, cola, and alcoholic beverages). PED Long periods of continuous physical exercise is often considered the causal factor involved in a PED diagnosis. It is important to note that PED a is sometimes co-diagnosed with epilepsy and young-onset Parkinson's disease. Correlations between the causes of young-onset Parkinson's disease and PED may be due to a similar problem, specifically a mutation of a potassium channel gene on chromosome 1. The pathogenesis of PED has also been linked to mutations in the GLUT1 glucose transporter which can result in transient energy deficits in the basal ganglia. Diagnosis Diagnosis is similar, but slightly different for each type of PD. Some types are more understood than others, and therefore have more criteria for diagnosis. PKD The guidelines for diagnosing PKD were reviewed and confirmed by Unterberger and Trinka. PKD consists of unexpected forms of involuntary movements of the body. The patient is usually diagnosed sometime before their 20s, and is more likely diagnosed during childhood than early adulthood. Almost all PKD's are idiopathic, but there have been examples of autosomal dominant inheritance as well. Physical examination and brain imaging examinations show normal results, and an EEG shows no specific abnormalities as well. However, the negative synchronous EEG results can be used to prove that PKD is not a sort of reflex epilepsy, but a different disease. PKD is the most prevalent subtype of paroxysmal dyskinesia, encompassing over 80% of all given PD diagnosis. PKD is more prevalent in boys, usually as high as 3.75:1. PNKD PNKD has a set guideline for diagnosis that is slightly different from PKD. PNKD usually occurs unexpectedly, and is not brought on by sudden movements or exercise. Instead the attacks are brought on by stresses such as emotional stress, fatigue, alcohol, or caffeine consumption. Just like PKD, PNKD also shows autosomal dominance in family history. Physical examination and brain imaging examinations show normal results, and EEG shows no specific abnormalities as well. PNKD is more prevalent in boys, with ratios of 1.4:1. PED PED has a set guideline for diagnosis that is similar, but slightly different from both PKD and PNKD. PED attacks consist of dystonic and bilateral movements usually in the lower limbs of the body. These attacks are usually brought about only by exercise and physical exhaustion. PED patients do not feel an aura-like sensation before an attack occurs, unlike PKD and PNKD. These attacks usually last from 5 to 30 minutes, and can occur once a day or once a month. Physical examination and brain imaging examinations show normal results, and EEG shows no specific abnormalities as well. PED is the rarest paraoxysmal dyskinesia subtype. Management=PKD PKD patients usually show a good response to anticonvulsants. Most commonly used medications are sodium blockers, carbamazepine and phenytoin. During a drug-testing study, patients reported a decreasing response to the latter use of anticonvulsants and switched to carbamazepine or phenytoin. Refraining from established triggers such as sudden movement has been shown to lessen attacks occurrences. Avoidance of predisposing factors such as stress, excitement, and fatigue also help manage attacks. PNKD Treatment for PKND is more difficult than other Paroxysmal Dyskinesias. The majority of patients experience some relief from low dosages of clonazepam, a muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant. Similar to PKD, avoidance of stress, excitement, and fatigue will lower the frequency of PNKD attacks. Many patients also avoid known methyglyoxal containing foods and beverages such as alcohol, coffee, tea, and chocolate. PED PED patients usually avoid prolonged, continuous exertion to prevent occurrence of attacks. Use of anticonvulsants such as benzodiazepines show little to no success in PED patients. A few cases have shown that patients were able to lessen their attacks with a high carbohydrate snack. A new approach to managing PED is the ketogenic diet, which alters the primary cerebral energy metabolism from glucose to ketone bodies. Reports have shown that the ketonic diet protects against seizures in epilepsy. In PED, it is probable that ketones will provide sufficient energy for the basal ganglia, which is normally deficient in patients with PED. Prognosis Paroxysmal Dyskinesia is not a fatal disease. Life can be extremely difficult with this disease depending on the severity. The prognosis of PD is extremely difficult to determine because the disease varies from person to person. The attacks for PKD can be reduced and managed with proper anticonvulsants, but there is no particular end in sight for any of the PD diseases. PKD has been described to cease for some patients after the age of 20, and two patients have reported to have a family history of the disease where PKD went into complete remission after the age of 23. With PNKD and PED, at this time, there is no proper way to determine an accurate prognosis.

Life Charlton was born in London, the only surviving son of Robert Charlton, goldsmith, of Mincing Lane, London and perhaps of Whitton Court, Shropshire, and his first wife Emma Harby, daughter of Thomas Harby of Adstone, Northamptonshire. He matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford on 20 April 1632, aged 17. He was a student of Lincoln's Inn in 1633 and was called to the bar in 1640. In 1659, Charlton was elected Member of Parliament for Ludlow in the Third Protectorate Parliament. He was elected MP for Ludlow again in 1660 for the Convention Parliament. He was a justice of the Oxford circuit in July 1660 and was created serjeant-at-law in October 1660. In 1661, he was re-elected MP for Ludlow for the Cavalier Parliament. He served as a justice of the Chester circuit from 1661 to 1662. He was made a King's Serjeant in 1668. Charlton served as Speaker from 4 to 18 February 1673, pleading ill-health to retire. He left Parliament in 1679, and was forced out of the post of Chief Justice of Chester in 1680 when Judge Jeffreys desired it, being placed in the Court of Common Pleas instead. In lieu of that office Charlton was, 26 April 1680, made chief justice of the common pleas ; but having given his opinion in opposition to the king's dispensing power, he was removed from office 26 April 1680. He was, however, restored to the chief justiceship of Chester in 1686, and on 12 May that year was created a baronet. He died at his seat at Ludford, (then in Herefordshire but now in Shropshire), 29 May 1697. Family By his first wife, Dorothy, daughter and heiress of William Blunden of Bishop's Castle, he had four sons and three daughters, including: * Sir Francis Charlton, 2nd Baronet * Jane Charlton, married Thomas Hanmer * Dorothy Charlton, married Sir Edward Leighton, 1st Baronet * Mary Charlton, married a Mr Burrell of Essex By his second wife, Lettice, daughter of Walter Waring of Oldbury, he had one son and one daughter: * Gilbert Charlton * Emma Charlton, first married to Thomas Cornwallis; then to John Robinson, Bishop of London The baronetcy became extinct with the fourth holder in 1784.

The number of attacks can increase during puberty and decrease in a person's 20s to 30s. Involuntary movements can take many forms such as ballism, chorea or dystonia and usually only affect one side of the body or one limb in particular. This rare disorder only affects about 1 in 150,000 people, with PKD accounting for 86.8% of all the types of paroxysmal dyskinesias, and occurs more often in males than females. There are two types of PKD, primary and secondary. Primary PKD can be further broken down into familial and sporadic. Familial PKD, which means the individual has a family history of the disorder, is more common, but sporadic cases are also seen. Secondary PKD can be caused by many other medical conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke, pseudohypoparathyroidism, hypocalcemia, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, central nervous system trauma, or peripheral nervous system trauma. PKD has also been linked with infantile convulsions and choreoathetosis (ICCA) syndrome, in which patients have afebrile seizures during infancy (benign familial infantile epilepsy) and then develop paroxysmal choreoathetosis later in life. This phenomenon is actually quite common, with about 42% of individuals with PKD reporting a history of afebrile seizures as a child. Genetics  Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesias are often inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and several genes have now been identified where mutations can cause this disease. The genes typically code for proteins known to be involved in synaptic transmission, ion channels or ion transporters. The first gene to be identified was the PRRT2 gene on chromosome 16, found in 2011 to be the cause of the disease in some patients. The mutations in this gene included a nonsense mutation identified in the genome of one family and an insertion mutation identified in the genome of another family. Researchers found PRRT2 mutations in 10 of 29 sporadic cases affected with PKD, thus suggests PRRT2 is the gene mutated in a subset of PKD and PKD is genetically heterogeneous.Li J, Zhu X, Wang X et al. J Med Genet. 2012 Feb;49(2):76-8. Epub 2011 Nov 30. Targeted genomic sequencing identifies PRRT2 mutations as a cause of paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis. Later reports have identified the genes SCN8A, CHRNA4, and SLC16A2 as further causes of PKD. Pathophysiology The pathophysiology of PKD is not fully explained. A few mechanisms have been suggested thus far: #GABA dysregulation #Abnormal breakdown of dopamine in the basal ganglia #Dysfunction of the substantia nigra #A form of epilepsy Multiple methods are being used to study the potential brain abnormalities of individuals with PKD compared with ‚Äúnormal‚Äù individuals. These methods include SPECT studies, fMRI studies, and diffusion tensor imaging. The main problem with many of the studies concerned with the pathophysiology of the disorder is the small sample size. Because the studies normally only include about 7-10 patients with PKD, the results cannot be generalized to the entire population of patients. However, the studies do bring up possibilities for further study. SPECT studies In a study by Joo et al., the researchers performed interictal studies, meaning they scanned the patient's brain between attacks to find an underlying abnormality, rather than ictal scans, which look at the abnormalities that present themselves during an attack. The researchers found interictally decreased cerebral blood flow in the posterior parts of the bilateral caudate nucleus. However, the literature does state that although this could be a cause of PKD, it could also be a result of PKD. Another SPECT study showed an increase in the cerebral blood flow in the left posterior thalamus in a PKD patient during an attack. The researchers also subtracted the ictal from the postictal scans, and saw increased blood flow in the thalamus. They ultimately suggested that hyperactive blood flow in this area could be causing the pathophysiology of PKD. This study, however, was only performed on one patient, and would need to be replicated many more times in order to be generalized to the population of PKD patients. Other SPECT studies have been cited showing hyperactivity in the basal ganglia. fMRI studies In a study by Zhou et al., the researchers performed fMRI studies on PKD patients, and analyzed the differences between the amplitude low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) of the patients. They found that the left postcentral gyrus and the bilateral putamen had increased ALFF in PKD patients. The researchers concluded that the hyperactivity in these regions suggested that there is a dysfunction in the basal ganglia-thalamo- cortical circuit in PKD. This circuit is part of the motor control circuit in the brain, making it a reasonable place for abnormality in a movement disorder, but again, researchers are still unsure of the role these differences they found play in the disease pathology. Diffusion tensor imaging Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) displays physical alterations in the brain that may not be seen on regular MRI. In one study researchers found that some of the patients had abnormalities in their thalamus. However, this does not prove that all patients have abnormalities in their thalamus. Other cases are cited, including a patient who developed a similar paroxysmal dyskinesia after a thalamic infarction, implicating that an abnormality in the thalamus of individuals could contribute to PKD. It is not fully known, however, what role a thalamic abnormality plays in the disease pathophysiology. Diagnosis Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia is diagnosed using a strict set of guidelines. These criteria were studied and confirmed by Bruno et al. in a study of 121 individuals with PKD. The age at onset is between 1 and 20 years old. The attacks of involuntary movements last less than one minute and have a known trigger, usually a sudden voluntary movement. For example, if a PKD patient stands up or begins walking after being sedentary for a period of time, or a person goes from a walk to a run, it can trigger an attack. Persons with PKD do not lose consciousness during attacks and have a full memory of the entire attack. Lastly, people with the disorder have a good response to medication and are usually prescribed anticonvulsants. The study also found that patients with familial PKD exhibit symptoms that follow the diagnostic criteria closely, while sporadic PKD individuals may deviate slightly. Prior to criteria for diagnosis being set out, many patients with PKD were often diagnosed with some form of epilepsy. Many patients also experience an aura, similar to those experienced with epilepsy, preceding their attacks. Some patients describe it as a tingling sensation in the affected limb or ‚Äúbutterflies in their stomach.‚Äù Some individuals also have precipitants, such as stress and anxiety, that make it more likely for attacks to occur. The above diagnostic criteria also set PKD apart from the other paroxysmal dyskinesias, which include paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) and paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia (PED). While PKD attacks last less than one minute, PNKD attacks last a few minutes to a few hours, and as the name suggests, the attacks do not occur because of a sudden voluntary movement like PKD. Additionally, PKD can almost always be managed with drug therapy, while PNKD is not as responsive to anticonvulsants. PED, on the other hand, separates itself from PKD in that it is caused by prolonged exercise. Attacks from PED will cease soon after exercise is stopped. Treatment Almost all patients respond positively to antiepileptic (anticonvulsant) drugs. One of the drugs most often mentioned in the literature is carbamazepine, and is the most widely used drug for treating PKD. Other anticonvulsants like valproic acid, phenytoin and clonazepam are common alternatives. Other categories of drugs have also been used, such as dopamine affecting drugs like Levodopa or Tetrabenazine. Individuals with the disorder can also modify their behavior to lessen their attacks without the influence of drug therapy. For example, decreasing stress to avoid precipitants can help patients decrease the number of attacks. In addition, avoiding any sudden movements can also prevent an attack. In order to prevent an attack, some individuals use their auras as a warning, while others purposefully perform slow gestures or movements prior to a triggering movement. Many, if not most, individuals end up growing out of the attacks with age, even without medicinal therapy, but some patients will go back to having attacks after a period of remission. In regards to secondary PKD, treatment of the primary condition can lessen the PKD attacks in those individuals. History  A movement order similar to PKD first mentioned in research literature in 1940 by Mount and Reback. They described a disorder consisting of attacks of involuntary movements but unlike PKD, the attacks lasted minutes to hours and were found to be caused by alcohol or caffeine intake. They named it paroxysmal dystonic choreoathetosis. Kertesz later described another new movement disorder in 1967. He described a disorder that was induced by sudden movements, and responded to anticonvulsants, naming it paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis. Finally in a review in 1995 Demirkiran and Jankovic stated the disease should be called paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia instead, pointing out that the attacks could manifest as any form of dyskinesia, not just choreoathetosis.

Paroxysmal Dyskinesias. Shrine of Neurology. Nov. 2004 http://www.angelfire.com/retro/michaelpoon168/paroxysmal_dyskinesias.htm PED is in the class of paroxysmal dyskinesia which are a group of rare movement disorders characterized by attacks of hyperkinesia with intact consciousness.Blueprints Neurology, 2nd ed. The term paroxysmal indicates that the episodes are sudden and short lived and usually unpredicted, and return to normal is rapid. The number of reported cases of people with PED is very small leading to difficulty in studying and classifying this disease and most studies are limited to a very small number of test subjects.  Symptoms and signs Episodes are relatively short-lived, lasting anywhere from 5‚Äì30 minutes, and in most cases disappear completely after cessation of the physical exercise. Most patients will experience 1 to 5 episodes per month, but some can have attacks daily. The muscles most often affected are usually in the legs and feet (75% of reported cases), but the upper body muscles such as the arms, face, neck, and trunk have also been observed to be affected during the episodes of dystonia. . Age of onset is usually sometime in childhood, but can range from 1‚Äì30 years old. In one study it was found that the mean age of onset was around 8 years. Similarly in the study, the legs were the most common affected part of the body and the attacks were reported as stiffening and cramps by those affected. During an episode of PED patients find walking nearly impossible. Cerebral spinal fluid analysis showed a two- fold increase of homovanillic acid and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid immediately following exercise compared to normal levels. This indicated that increased dopaminergic transmission could contribute to PED and other paroxysmal dyskinesias. Neurological examinations, EEG, and brain imaging are all normal in PED patients.Diagnosis and Treatment of Paroxysmal Dyskinesias Revisited: Paroxysmal Exercise-induced (Exertion-induced) Dyskinesia Medscape Today 2008 London. http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/581684_5  Causes = Familial  In most cases, PED is familial, but can also be sporadic. In familial cases, pedigrees examined have shown PED to be an autosomal-dominant inheritance trait. PED also has been associated with Parkinson's disease, epilepsy and migraines, although the exact relationship between these is unknown. A suspected contributor to familial PED is a mutation in the GLUT1 gene, SLC2A1, which codes for the transporter GLUT1, a protein responsible for glucose entry across the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. It is not thought that the mutation causes a complete loss of function of the protein but rather only slightly reduces the transporter's activity. In a study of PED patients, a median cerebrospinal fluid/blood glucose ratio of .52 compared to a normal .60 was found. In addition, reduced glucose uptake by mutated transporters compared with wild-type in Xenopus oocytes confirmed a pathogenic role of these mutations. Another recent study was performed to continue to look at the possible connection between PED and mutations on the SLC2A1 gene which codes for the GLUT1 transporter. While PED can occur in isolation it was also noted that it occurs in association with epilepsy as well. In this study the genetics of a five-generation family with history of PED and epilepsy were evaluated. From the results it was noted that most of the mutations were due to frameshift and missense mutations. When looking at homologous GLUT1 transporters in other species it was noted that serine (position 95), valine (position 140), and asparagine (position 317) were highly conserved and therefore mutations in these residues would most likely be pathogenic. Therefore, these are areas of interest when looking at what could lead to PED.All mutations that were observed appeared to only affect the ability of GLUT1 to transport glucose and not the ability for it to be inserted in the membrane. The observed maximum transport velocity of glucose was reduced anywhere from 3 to 10 fold. A study was performed to determine if the mutation known for the PNKD locus on chromosome 2q33-35 was the cause of PED. In addition, other loci were observed such as the familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) locus on chromosome 19p, or the familial infantile convulsions and paroxysmal choreoathetosis (ICCA). All three of these suspected regions were found to not contain any mutations, and were therefore ruled out as possible candidates for a cause of PED.  Sporadic  Sporadic cases may be brought on by minor head injuries and concussions. This was observed in one patient who started experiencing painless dystonia after mild exercise following a concussion. More research still needs to be done to determine how injuries can induce PED, as little is known in this area. Two cases of PED have been associated with insulinomas, after removal of which the symptoms of PED were resolved.  Diagnosis  Since the age of onset is relatively young of PED it is important to correctly diagnose this disease. The limited cases and limited knowledge of the disease makes this difficult but a few characteristics seem to be consistent. It appears that patients with PED would have normal neurological examinations and MRI but the noticeable characteristic would be in low levels of glucose in the cerebral spinal fluid due to the GLUT1 mutations.  Related disorders  PED differs from two closely related disorders, for example paroxysmal kinesogenic dyskinesia (PKD) and paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD), based on what brings on the symptoms, namely prolonged exercise, such as brisk walking or running for at least 10 minutes. This is in contrast to PKD where the symptoms are brought about by sudden movements, and PNKD where the symptoms are spontaneous in nature and prolonged. PED is usually affects muscles on both sides of the body (bilateral), it has also been observed to have unilateral effects. PED has also been shown to be a precursor to Parkinson's disease. In two observed cases, PED preceded any symptoms of Parkinson's Disease by 1.5 and 5 years. Although a rare indicator, PED can be an early sign of the disorder, suggesting they are related. In one case a patient with PED showed evidence of dopamine depletion revealed by a dopamine transporter SPECT scan. This is typical of Parkinson's disease, further showing the linkage between the diseases. A correlation between epilepsy and PED has been observed in several families across multiple generations, demonstrating an autosomal dominant heritability of symptoms. The occurrence of coexistent seizures and PED symptoms are observed mainly during infancy and childhood, with symptoms of PED continuing throughout a lifetime. Epileptic seizures vary in type and have been observed as absence and generalized seizures. Simultaneous seizure and PED attacks are often premeditated by bouts of dizziness. Attacks have been shown to be reduced or prevented with food ingestion, although the reasons for this are unclear. Various evidence shows that the disorders are likely caused by dysfunction in voltage-gated ion channels, which may lead to abnormal excitability in different brain regions, specifically the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia.  Treatments  As there appeared to be a connection with PED and mutated GLUT1 transporters a possible treatment was looking at changing patients diets. A common treatment for another disorder with a mutated GLUT1 transporter is the ketogenic diet. The diet is a strict 3:1 ratio of fat (3) to protein and carbohydrates (1). This diet is thought to help restore the unbalance created by the decreased amount of glucose in the brain caused by the faulty GLUT1 transporter. This diet was administered to three patients who had been screened and found to have mutation in their SLC2A genes coding for GLUT1 and were experiencing PED symptoms. All three showed benefit from this treatment and a reduction in their PED episodes. They were able to exercise and run long distances for the first time in their lives. No other studies have been performed using this diet as many patients feel the advantages of the diet do not outweigh its disadvantages. As some cases have noted that patients were able to alleviate or lessen their PED attacks with a sugary snack, another diet that was tried on patients was one rich in carbohydrates with additional frequent carbohydrate-containing snacks. Four patients with reported PED symptoms were put on this diet but no observable improvements were noted and in fact one patient even complained of worsening symptoms. Additionally it has been observed that levodopa may reduce some symptoms associated with PED. This may demonstrate that PED is a precursor to Parkinson's disease. Acetazolamide was beneficial to some patients, but also worsened symptoms in others. Additionally, a modified version of the Atkin's diet helped to regulate glucose levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. Patients with PED associated with insulinomas appeared to have symptoms resolved after consuming sugary drinks. Currently, there are no drugs that are particularly useful in completely curing all symptoms.  Epidemiology  There are very few reported cases of PED, there are approximately 20 reported sporadic cases of PED and 9 PED families but there is some dispute on the exact number of cases. In addition it appears that PED becomes less severe with aging. Prior to onset of a PED episode some patients reported onset of symptoms including sweating, pallor, and hyperventilation. In brain scans it was observed that patients suffering form frequent PEDs there was increased metabolism in the putamen of the brain and decreased metabolism in the frontal lobe. Another study using subtraction single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) imaging technique which was coregistered with an MRI on a patient presented with PED symptoms showed increased cerebral perfusion in the primary somatosensory cortex area, and a mild increase in the region of the primary motor cortex and cerebellum. While all these correlations are not fully understand as to what exactly is happening in the brain it provides areas of interest to study further to hopefully understand PED more fully. Research Since paroxysmal exercise-induced dystonia is such a rare disorder it makes it difficult to study the disease and find consistencies. Many of the current studies seem to have contradicting conclusion but this is due to the fact that studies are usually limited to a very small number of test subjects. With such small numbers it is hard to determine what is a trend and what is random when in comes to characterizing the disease. Further study is needed to find better diagnostic techniques and treatments for PED. Patients with PED are living a limited lifestyle since simple tasks like walking and exercise are often impossible.

In geometry, a stellation diagram or stellation pattern is a two-dimensional diagram in the plane of some face of a polyhedron, showing lines where other face planes intersect with this one. The lines cause 2D space to be divided up into regions. Regions not intersected by any further lines are called elementary regions. Usually unbounded regions are excluded from the diagram, along with any portions of the lines extending to infinity. Each elementary region represents a top face of one cell, and a bottom face of another. A collection of these diagrams, one for each face type, can be used to represent any stellation of the polyhedron, by shading the regions which should appear in that stellation. A stellation diagram exists for every face of a given polyhedron. In face transitive polyhedra, symmetry can be used to require all faces have the same diagram shading. Semiregular polyhedra like the Archimedean solids will have different stellation diagrams for different kinds of faces.

Opening in 1998, it became a place for stressed out visitors to come drink coffee and pet cats. Cat caf√©s increased in popularity in Japan because most renters were not allowed to own pets. In 2005, Shop of Cats in Tokyo became a place for single income families to enjoy the comfort of the pets that they couldn't own. In April 2014, New York took on the cat caf√© idea, which took off immediately. Sponsored by Purina One, it lets families meet adoptable cats. Additionally, two pop-up cat caf√©s in California, located in Bay area and Oakland, opened in 2014. The San Francisco location, KitTea, was open to both rescued and feral cats. The Oakland location, Cat Town, was designated to cats that were ready to be placed in a home. In Europe, cat caf√©s took off in places like Paris, Berlin, and London. Dog Caf√©s Dog caf√©s are popular in Korea and the United States. One caf√© in Santa Monica, named Grounds and Hounds, sponsors shelter dogs that are up for adoption. Customers can pet these puppies in a designated area of the caf√©. In Korea, dogs in the caf√© are from puppy mills and are not up for adoption. This practice, however, is changing quickly. Dogs in caf√©s like Grounds and Hounds are adoptable shelter dogs, some suffering from physical illnesses. In these caf√©s, strict health codes are enforced, requiring animals and food to be separated. For the animals to stay overnight, the caf√© was built in an industrial zone - which is a requirement given by the L.A. Health Department. Animal Caf√©s in Tokyo In Tokyo, there are pet caf√©s with rabbits, birds, goldfish, reptiles, goats, and penguins. These caf√©s are the most popular for those with strict renting policies in Japan and for tourists. To protect the well-being of the animals, some caf√©s have specific time limits. Other rules include that food must be separate from the animals, or there must be trained handler on hand. With some animals, specifically penguins and reptiles, visitors are there to watch, but not to touch the animals. In some cases, visitors may pay extra for pictures with the animals.  Importance  One method of pet renting is animal assisted therapy. Animal assisted therapy can help to reduce pain, anxiety, depression and fatigue in people with a range of health issues including: children having dental procedures, people receiving cancer treatment, people in long-term care facilities, people hospitalized with chronic heart failure and veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). \\"Therapy dogs can be a patient's best friend.\\" Mayo Clinic, Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, 19 Aug. 2016, https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/in- depth/pet-therapy/art-20046342 Other benefits from programs that use pet renting include not only the people who are sick, but it also includes the loved ones of the ill patients too.

Every day, agents audition talented animals for parts in film, theater, photo shoots, and television commercials. Each animal talent agency represents hundreds of clients which include animals in wildlife preserves, pets, and even domestic and exotic species. Though the need for animal actors is declining due to modern digital animation, for commercials, the typical rate in New York is $800 a day for a dog. =Abuse in the Media= In the movie Snakes on a Plane, reptile wrangler Jules Sylvester had brought over 27 types of snakes on the movie set. Snakes get tired after an hour of work, and can become over stressed, causing a snake not to eat for a week. It is for this reason that particular snakes are leased for an hour at a time. Animal Safety Due to animal killing scenes in movies such as Call of the Wild (1937) the American Animal Defense League (AADL) started taking measures to protect hired animal actors from abuse. Investigations involved popular Hollywood studios such as Warner Brothers and 20th Century Fox regarding abuse in films as well as abusive living conditions. More recently, the American Humane Association's (AHA) Film and Television Unit have taken the initiative to make sure animal actors were not harmed in the making of the movie. The AHA began monitoring the safety of animals after Jesse James provoked an outcry when a horse was forced to leap to its death from the top of a cliff in 1939. The AHA prides itself on ensuring safety for all animal actors. =Highest Paid Animal Actors= The Wizard of Oz Judy Garland Terry 1939 The animals people gaze upon on the internet, in advertisements, are prized for their ‚Äúcuteness.‚Äù This was seen in the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz, as Toto or ‚ÄúTerry the Terrier‚Äù made over $125 a week, compared to the Munchkins, who made $50.

Railroad Bridge was the first bridge over the Susquehanna River, built by the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad in 1866, as part of the first mainline railroad between Philadelphia and Baltimore. The bridge was replaced by the Susquehanna River Movable Bridge (now called the Amtrak Susquehanna River Bridge) in 1906. History alt=A stone bridge pier in a wide river, next to a steel truss bridge The P.W. & B. began operating its main line in 1838, using a ferry operation to transport railroad cars over the Susquehanna River. Construction of the bridge, which was a wood truss design, began in 1862. The masonry and most of the wooden spans were complete in 1866, but then a tornado severely damaged the wooden components on July 25, 1866. Repairs were quickly made and the first locomotive crossed the bridge on November 20, 1866. The cost of construction, including rebuilding most of the truss portions, was $2.3 million. Passenger trains began service over the bridge on November 26, 1866. The P.W. & B. later replaced the wooden spans with iron spans. A draw span was then installed in the late 1870s. The Pennsylvania Railroad took control of the P.W. & B. in 1881. It built a new bridge from 1904 to 1906. The P.W. & B. bridge was then converted to a vehicular bridge, and was made double-decker because it was so narrow. Its existence as such overlapped that of what is now the Hatem Bridge, but was eventually dismantled during World War II. The piers still stand next to the current railroad bridge today.

Petfinder.com. History Nevins Farm before Harriet Nevins donated it to the MSPCA In 1917, Mrs. Harriet Nevins donated her farm of rolling pastures in Methuen to the MSPCA so that it could be used as a rest home for horses and other unwanted or abandoned animals. The donation was accompanied by a $5,000 bequest toward building construction and the purchase of necessary farm implements and machinery. First known as \\"The Rest Home\\", the property was used for retired police horses and other horses who worked on the then-cobblestone streets of Boston. Arrangements made with horse owners allowed horses that were still working animals to spend time grazing and relaxing in the fields of Nevins Farm. A common agreement was one in which a horses would rotate between spending a month on the farm and a month in Boston working.Nevins Farm: About Us \\"MSPCA Historical Timeline \\". MSPCA. A shelter for small animals was added to the Methuen facility in 1924 and as motor vehicles replaced horse-drawn carriages and fewer horses worked on the streets, the role of the farm began to change. While involvement with smaller animals has increased, Nevins Farm's concern for large animals has remained a central part of its mission. In 1994, the farm launched the Equine Ambulance Program to offer emergency rescue and transport of disabled horses in New England and ambulance services events involving horses worldwide.

Through self-release, and being signed to Wrestler and Bar/None Records, they released four LPs, two EPs and one single, and when the band regrouped in 2006, they released their previously lost final LP, Every Woman's Fantasy, on their own label, Glass Eye Records.  History  Glass Eye formed in 1983, and became regulars in the post-punk Texas music circuit. An episode of the MTV show Cutting Edge from 1985 featured Glass Eye (and other bands like The Reivers, Timbuk 3, and the seminal singer-songwriter Daniel Johnston) as examples of the New Sincerity musical movement. Johnston played his first public performance opening for Glass Eye. He had given his self-recorded tape Hi, How Are You to Glass Eye frontwoman Kathy McCarty, who didn't listen to it until after Johnston asked her what she thought of the record (she reportedly praised it, then went home and listened to it immediately afterwards). McCarty and Johnston later dated briefly; their relationship is documented in the 2006 Jeff Feuerzeig film The Devil and Daniel Johnston, as well as the Glass Eye song \\"Kicking the Dog\\". The original line-up of Glass Eye consisted of: *Kathy McCarty - vocals, guitar *Brian Beattie - vocals, bass *Scott Marcus - drums, vocals *Stella Weir - keyboard, vocals This lineup was featured on their first two records, Marlo (1985) (which a Texas Monthly reviewer called \\"one of the most gripping independent releases from Texas in recent memory\\"Jody Denberg, \\"Resident Rockers\\", Texas Monthly, May 1985, p. 184.) and Huge (1986) which was dropped by the label shortly after release.Ed Ward, \\"Glass Eye\\", Spin, March 1988, p. 16. In 1987, Marcus and Weir left the band. Sheri Lane played keyboards and guitar and Dave Cameron, now Lisa Cameron following a name change, played drums on the 1988 album Bent By Nature. Marcus and Weir rejoined the band in 1989 and the band released Hello Young Lovers that year and the \\"Satellite of Love/Rock of Hand\\" single in 1991. Glass Eye's albums were produced primarily by Beattie and engineered by various contributors, including Mike Stewart, Stuart Sullivan, and Roy Taylor. Beattie had previously played bass in several bands including the Stamford, CT based punk bands Tapeworm and Safety Patrol, as well as the initial line-up of the Californian punk band Fang. McCarty played with the Austin all-woman band Buffalo Gals as well as a Berkeley, California based band Sinequan with former Safety Patrol member Scott Fletcher before joining Glass Eye. Scott Marcus also was in Safety Patrol. Marcus, Weir and McCarty all had cameo roles in the 1991 Richard Linklater film Slacker, and the Glass Eye song \\"White Walls\\" was featured on the film's soundtrack.  Breakup and solo careers  The band broke up in 1993 following some friction relating to their attempts at signing to a major label. Kathy McCarty went on to make several solo records, including the acclaimed Dead Dog's Eyeball, a cover album of Daniel Johnston songsMark Jenkins, \\"McCarty's Take On Daniel Johnston\\", The Washington Post, April 21, 1995 . that was re-released in 2005,\\"K.

In 2005, she released her own record of original songs called Another Day In The Sun. In 1987, Stella Weir and Scott Marcus played in the band Prohibition for one album, Flophouse.

He is patron of the 11th chair of the Brazilian Academy of Letters. Biography A drawing of Fagundes Varela. Lu√≠s Nicolau Fagundes Varela was born in Rio Claro in 1841, to Emiliano Fagundes Varela and Em√≠lia de Andrade. He spent most of his childhood at the farm where he was born, later moving to innumerous places, among them the city of Catal√£o, Goi√°s, where he met Bernardo Guimar√£es. Returning to Rio, he lived in Angra dos Reis and Petr√≥polis, where he concluded his primary and secondary studies. In 1859, he goes to S√£o Paulo and, in 1862, enters at the Faculdade de Direito da Universidade de S√£o Paulo, but abandons it to dedicate himself to the literature and to the bohemianism. He published his first poetry book, Noturnas, one year before. He married a circus artist from Sorocaba, Alice Guilhermina Luande. This provoked a scandal in his family and made his financial condition worse. With her he had a son, Emiliano, who died with 3 months old; extremely depressed, Fagundes wrote in the memory of his dead son his most well-known poem, \\"C√¢ntico do Calv√°rio\\" (that can be found on the book Cantos e Fantasias). His woman died in 1865 or 1866, while Varela was travelling to Recife. Returning to S√£o Paulo, he matriculated himself once more in the Faculdade de Direito da Universidade de S√£o Paulo in 1867, but would later abandon it once more. He then returns to his house in Rio Claro, living in there until 1870. He marries once again, with his cousin Maria Belis√°ria de Brito Lambert, having with her two daughters and one son. Having moved to Niter√≥i with his father in 1870, he lives there until dying, on February 18, 1875. Some of Varela's poems have an unusual theme for the Ultra-Romanticism: the Abolitionism. Because of that, he is considered to be one of the forerunners of the \\"Condorism\\", alongside Junqueira Freire, another Ultra-Romantic poet who spoke of the Abolitionism in some of his poems.

He was the grandson of Ralph Neville, 3rd Earl of Westmorland, and the father of Henry Neville, 5th Earl of Westmorland. Family Ralph Neville, born 21 February 1498, was the son of Ralph Neville (d. 1498) and Edith Sandys (d. 22 August 1529), daughter of Sir William Sandys of the Vyne by Edith Cheyne, daughter of Sir John Cheyne. He was the grandson of Ralph Neville, 3rd Earl of Westmorland, and Isabel Booth.; ; ; . Neville had a brother who died young, and a sister, Isabel, who married firstly, Sir Robert Plumpton, and secondly, Lawrence Kighley, Esq.. After his father's death in 1498, Neville's mother, Edith, married Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy of Darcy, who was beheaded on Tower Hill 30 June 1537 for his part in the Pilgrimage of Grace. She died at Stepney on 22 August 1529, and was buried at the Friars Observant, Greenwich.; ; . Career Neville inherited the earldom of Westmorland as an infant at the death of his grandfather on 6 February 1499. On 9 July 1510, at about the age of twelve, his wardship was granted to Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham.. As a young man, Westmorland was among those who attended King Henry VIII at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in June 1520 and at his meeting with Emperor Charles V at Gravelines in July. On 7 November 1520 he had livery of his lands.Cokayne notes that he was said to be 'still underage' at that date, although other documents establish that he had reached the age of majority. He was present at the reception for the Emperor near Dover in May 1522. In 1522‚Äì23 Westmorland saw military service on the Scottish border, where he was knighted in the latter year by Thomas Howard, then Earl of Surrey. He was installed as a member of the Order of the Garter on 25 June 1525, and before 5 February 1526 was a member of the King's Privy Council. He continued to serve on the northern border, being appointed Deputy Captain of Berwick and Vice Warden of the East and Middle Marches from October 1525 to September 1526 under the King's illegitimate son, the Duke of Richmond. In January 1526 he was the chief envoy charged with concluding a truce with Scotland.; ; . On 13 July 1530 Westmorland was among those who signed the letter to Pope Clement VII urging the annulment of the King's marriage to his first wife, Catherine of Aragon. In May 1534 he was a member of a commission directed to inquire into alleged treasonous activities by William Dacre, 3rd Baron Dacre of Gilsland. He again saw military service in the north when in June and July 1535 he was among those charged with suppressing disorders in Northumberland, Cumberland, and Westmorland. On 15 May 1536 he was one of the peers who took part in the trial of the King's second wife, Anne Boleyn. During the Pilgrimage of Grace in 1536‚Äì37 Westmorland remained loyal to the King, which Archbold notes is 'surprising, considering his family connections'. He refused an appointment as Warden of the East and Middle Marches at this time, allegedly because his men supported the rising. At the time Norfolk described him as 'a man of such heat and hastiness of nature' as to be 'unmeet' for the appointment. However, as Dockwray notes, Norfolk may have been disparaging a potential rival. On 14 January 1537 he was made a member of the Council of the North.; ; . On 12 November 1537 Westmorland attended the funeral of the King's third wife, Jane Seymour. In 1538 he was again disparaged, on this occasion being described by an anonymous writer as a man 'of great power without wit or knowledge'. In May 1544 he was in command of the East and Middle Marches during the invasion of Scotland under Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford.; . Westmorland died on 24 April 1549, aged 51, and was buried at Staindrop, Durham. His widow, Katherine, died 14 May 1555 at Holywell in Shoreditch, the house of her son- in-law, Henry Manners, 2nd Earl of Rutland, and was buried 17 May 1555 at St. Leonard's, Shoreditch.; . Marriage and issue Westmorland was first betrothed to Elizabeth Stafford (c.1497 ‚Äì 30 November 1558), the eldest daughter of his guardian, Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, and Eleanor Percy, with whom he is said to have been in love, and whom he was to have married before Christmas 1512. However about that time Thomas Howard made suit for her, and Elizabeth married Howard, as his second wife, before 8 January 1513.. Westmorland married instead, before June 1520, Stafford's second daughter, Katherine (d. 14 May 1555).

Wissahickon is located adjacent to the neighborhoods of Roxborough and Manayunk, and it is bounded by the Wissahickon Valley Park, Ridge Avenue, Hermit Street, and Henry Avenue. The name of the neighborhood comes from the Lenni Lenape word wisameckham, for \\"catfish creek\\", a reference to the fish that were once plentiful in the Wissahickon Creek. History The village of Wissahickon was founded by officials of the Pencoyd Iron Works in the late nineteenth century. Beginning in the 1880s, growing numbers of mill owners and wealthy business owners from neighboring Manayunk sought elegant homes on ample lots; they set their eyes on land previously owned by prominent Philadelphia families -- including the Camac, Dobson, Salaignac, and Wetherill families -- along the Wissahickon Creek. Grand single-detached and semi-detached homes with ample side and rear yards were built, creating \\"a unique park side Victorian wonderland.\\" The neighborhood was considered a highly desirable place to live as it had proximity to the Wissahickon Valley, tree-lined streets, new sewers and water services, and grand homes in high Victorian styling. Historic Structures * The 100 Steps: Located at the base of Freeland Avenue, these broad stairs were built in 1901 of Wissahickon granite and local ironwork. Restoration work was completed between 2003-05 as steps were repaired, new lighting was installed, and railings were replaced. The 100 Steps offer a convenient route to the trails in Wissahickon Valley Park. * Amos Barnes House: Located at 559 Righter Street, and built of Wissahickon schist circa 1856 in Gothic Revival style with Victorian Cottage elements, the house was owned by Amos Barnes, a Philadelphia architect who designed the Plays and Players Theater on Delancey Street as well as the 1927 addition to the Wissahickon Presbyterian Church. A plaque that was removed in 2017 from the front yard read as follows: Site of Hermit Lane & Ridge Ave. Here part of General Armstrong‚Äôs forces turned and marched to the Wissahickon, where they attacked the Hessians on the day of the Battle of Germantown, Oct. 4, 1777. East of here is the Glen of Kelpius, the ‚ÄúHermit of the Wissahickon,‚Äù and the old building at the point is the ‚ÄúOld Plow Tavern,‚Äù erected in 1746. While at top of hill on Righter Street a skirmish took place during the Revolution. This marker erected by Washington Camp No. 50 ‚Äì Patriotic Order Sons of America and citizens of Twenty-First Ward. *Holt House: Located at 145 Sumac Street, and built circa 1884 in the Queen Anne style with Eastlake Victorian elements possibly by mason John Gilton, the house was owned by James Z. and Mary Holt, who were wealthy, prominent figures in Philadelphia society as well as early investors in the development of the Wissahickon neighborhood. James was a mill owner, plus an officer and trustee of the Manayunk Trust and the Manayunk Penny Savings bank. The building, one-half of a twin comprising 145 and 147 Sumac Street, was among the first grand homes built in Wissahickon during this Victorian era as a speculative housing development directed at the wealthier class looking to live in the then developing neighborhood, and exemplifies the economic, social, and historical heritage of the community. In 2015, the house garnered local attention when it was slated for demolition in order to build multiple housing units. The local civic association, the owner, developer and the city later reached an agreement to save the house from demolition and instead renovate it with ‚Äúhistoric sensitivity.‚Äù In late 2019, staff from the Philadelphia Historical Commission‚Äôs Committee on Historic Designation revised and resubmitted a nomination for historic designation consideration. *James Sibbald House: Located at 5201 Ridge Avenue and built circa 1890, the house was owned by Dr. James Sibbald, a local surgeon during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The house was designed by architect Daniel S. Beale in the Late Victoria style. Sibbald also owned and sold several other three-story buildings on the east side of Ridge Avenue above Terrace Street. *Maurice Wilhere House: Located at 147 Sumac Street, and built circa 1884 in the Queen Anne style with Eastlake Victorian elements possibly by mason John Gilton, the house was owned by Maurice F. Wilhere, who was a magistrate and prominent figure in the local Democratic Committee in Philadelphia. The building, one-half of a twin comprising 145 and 147 Sumac Street, was among the first grand homes built in Wissahickon during this Victorian era as a speculative housing development directed at the wealthier class looking to live in the then developing neighborhood, and exemplifies the economic, social, and historical heritage of the community. In late 2019, staff from the Philadelphia Historical Commission‚Äôs Committee on Historic Designation revised and resubmitted a nomination for historic designation consideration. *Merrick Hall: Located on the 5300 block of Ridge Avenue, this is the oldest building on Northern Children‚Äôs Services campus. Designed in the Italianate style by noted Philadelphia architect Lindley Johnson in the 1860s, it was originally the former home of 19th century industrialist J. Vaughan Merrick. The mansion included all of the character-defining features of the Italianate: a tower, bracketed eaves, large porches supported by square pillars, and four-over-four double-hung windows. The house was renovated in 1927 by the well-known Philadelphia architect Horace Trumbauer and more recently in 2012-14 by Philadelphia architecture firm Jacobs Wyper Architects. * Northern Children's Services: Located on the 5300 block of Ridge Avenue, this is a cluster of stone buildings, including four dormitories, an infirmary, a dining hall and kitchen, a gymnasium, a library and meeting rooms, designed and altered by Philadelphia architect Horace Trumbauer in 1927 on a six-acre campus aimed at helping children and their families do better. * The Ridge Avenue Bridge: Located at the southern edge of the neighborhood, it is a triple-span stone arch bridge built in 1888 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. The bridge carries Ridge Avenue over the Wissahickon Creek and into East Falls. * St. Timothy's Workingmen's Club and Institute: Located at the intersection of Ridge Avenue, Terrace Street, and Vassar Street, and founded in 1872 with funds donated by the Merrick family and St. Timothy's Episcopal Church. Constructed of Wissahickon schist with granite trim, the building was designed in High Victorian Gothic style by architect Charles M. Burns Jr. and completed in 1877. Mr. J. Vaughan Merrick delivered an address at the opening of the new building. The club provided social and educational opportunities for working men: there was a library plus reading and billiard rooms, baseball and cricket teams, in addition to free night classes in mechanical drawing, engineering, and chemistry. The club ceased operations in 1912 due to declining membership brought on by the increase of local public libraries and public schools as well as the invention of the motion picture as entertainment. The building was added to the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places in 1974. *William Paine House: Located at the intersection of Vicaris Street and Osborn Street, the house was built circa 1869 in the Georgian style and added to the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places in 1993. William Paine, M.D., (1821-1893), practitioner of eclectic medicine, was a faculty member, general manager, and dean of the American College of Medicine in Philadelphia (also known as the Philadelphia University of Medicine and Surgery) until he was caught up in controversies surrounding trade in bogus diplomas. * Wissahickon Presbyterian Church: Located at the intersection of Ridge Avenue, Dawson Street, and Manayunk Avenue, the church was built in 1893 and started with 54 members. The building is Gothic and Renaissance style combined, built with Avondale stone with limestone trimmings.

Retrieved on November 7, 2008. A prior library, the Wissahickon Branch, located at Manayunk Avenue and Osborn Street, opened in 1909 and was built on land donated by the Pencoyd Iron Works. It was the ninth Andrew Carnegie-funded Free Library branch designed by the architectural firm of Whitfield and King and featured a main reading room, a children's room which also served as a lecture room seating 100, and a basement consisting of a boiler room, coal bin, staff room, a small magazine room, and two toilets. The Wissahickon Branch served the Wissahickon neighborhood until it closed in 1969. Sometime soon after, the building burned down. Parks and Recreation * David P.

The station was once home to a building designed by the renowned architect Frank Furness; however, the building was later demolished. Improvements were made to the existing station, and during Summer 2016, local artist and Moore College of Art & Design faculty member, David Guinn painted a mural on a retaining wall running along the outbound platform of the station, coordinated by the Wissahickon Interested Citizen's Association, Mural Arts Program, and Cook-Wissahickon School. The neighborhood is also served by bus routes 9, 27, and 65. The Wissahickon Transfer Station offers connecting service to routes 1, 9, 27, 35, 38, 61, 62, 65, 124, 125, & R. Civic Association The local civic association is called Wissahickon Interested Citizen's Association (WICA). The association was instrumental in preparing and implementing a Neighborhood Conversation Overlay (NCO) to mitigate the impact of new development in the neighborhood as well as maintain the walkability and character of it. Public meetings are held on the second Wednesday of every month, typically in the board room of Northern Children's Services. Another area civic association, Wissahickon Neighbors Civic Association (WNCA), serves the community northwest of Ridge Avenue. Public meetings are held on the first Monday of every month at Pilgrim Church. References Further reading  * Bicknell, Joseph D. The Wissahickon in History, Song and Story.

When Dole returned from World War II with injuries that had left his right arm frozen and about to be amputated, Kelikian fixed the shattered shoulder and allowed Dole to regain some use of his arm. Biography Kelikian was an Armenian orthopedic surgeon and native of Hadjin in the Ottoman Empire. Born Hamparzoum Keklikian, he came to America in 1920 to escape the Armenian Genocide, an event during which his three sisters had been killed. He was inspired to become a surgeon by his uncle, who worked as a physician in the Ottoman army. After emigrating to Chicago in 1920 under the sponsorship of Rev. Antranig A. Bedikian, Kelikian worked as a waiter at the University of Chicago, where he received a scholarship from President Harry Pratt Judson to study there and at Rush Medical College. He finished his internship at Cook County Hospital, and in 1929 became an assistant to Philip Kreuscher, who had been in practice with the bone specialist John Murphy. During World War II, Kelikian served as chief orthopedic surgeon and lieutenant colonel at the 297th General Hospital. Bob Dole was one of his many patients, and Kelikian refused to accept any fees from the young veteran, since his brother Siragan had been killed in Italy in 1943. In total, Kelikian performed seven operations between 1947 and 1953 to restore the use of Dole's arm by transplanting leg bone and muscle to the right shoulder and hand. He saved the left arm of a young Victor A. Lundy, who would become a leading architect of the Sarasota Modern; Kelikian never discharged his patient, who would serve as his medical artist. Upon his return to Chicago, he joined the staff of Wesley Hospital and Northwestern Medical School. Kelikian later became an emeritus associate professor of orthopedic surgery, performing ten operations a week when he was 80. Kelikian wrote three classic monographs on hand, ankle, and foot surgery, as well as a book on Armenian poetry. He also specialized in congenital deformities, particularly gigantism and on phocomelia due to thalidomide. He never charged Armenians for treatment. Kelikian had a son Armen, also a surgeon, and two daughters, Alice and Virginia, by his wife Ovsanna (n√©e Kupelian). He died on Sunday July 24, 1983 at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. He was 84. Achievements While he was working for the United States Army, his services were recognized by President Harry Truman, who gave him a citation and a medal. He also received a citation from the Queen while working as a consulting orthopaedic surgeon at the Ronkswood General Hospital in Worcester. In 1969, he was appointed to President Nixon‚Äôs Task Force for the Disabled. In 1966 he was invited to visit Lebanon by Professor Emile Riachi, his former resident, and was awarded the Order of the National Cedars of Lebanon by President Charles Helou ReferencesExternal links *http://www.armeniapedia.org/index.php?title=Hampar_Kelikian\\" *http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20074772,00.html Category:1899 births Category:1983 deaths Category:American orthopedic surgeons Category:Ethnic Armenian physicians Category:American people of Armenian descent Category:Armenians of the Ottoman Empire Category:Rush University alumni Category:University of Chicago alumni Category:Ottoman emigrants to the United States Category:Northwestern University faculty Category:Recipients of the National Order of the Cedar Category:Armenian Genocide survivors Category:20th-century surgeons ","title":"Hampar Kelikian"},{"id":"18697066","text":"Dhanshiri is a river in the Jhalokati District of Bangladesh.

The son of James Burston, a prominent Melbourne soldier and businessman, Burston graduated from the University of Melbourne with a Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery in 1910. After graduation, he worked with children at the Adelaide Children's Hospital and Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. Having served with the Militia from an early age, he obtained a commission in the Australian Army Medical Corps in 1912 and served as a medical officer in the Gallipoli Campaign and on the Western Front during World War I. Burston was mentioned in despatches and awarded the Distinguished Service Order for supervising an advanced dressing station under fire during the Battle of Messines. After the war he became a foundation Fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. During World War II he served as Director of Medical Services in the Middle East and Director General of Medical Services in Australia with the rank of major general. The 9th Division was withdrawn from the Siege of Tobruk on his medical advice. He remained Director General of Medical Services until 1948. In 1945, he became Chief Commissioner of St John Ambulance Australia, serving until 1957, Burston was involved in thoroughbred racing both as a punter and as a racehorse owner. He served as Chairman of the Moonee Valley Racing Club from 1952 until his death in 1960. Burston made the W S Cox Plate the richest weight for age race in Australia, and he oversaw the construction of the Burston Grandstand, which was named in his honour. Education and early life Samuel Roy Burston was born in Melbourne on 21 March 1888, the fourth of seven children to James Burston, a businessman who served as Lord Mayor of Melbourne from 1908 to 1910, and his wife Marianne, n√©e McBean. Roy always preferred to be known by his first name rather than as Samuel, which was the name of his grandfather. The family lived in Flinders Street, Melbourne and later in Hawthorn, Victoria. James Burston would go on to command the 7th Infantry Brigade in the Gallipoli Campaign and rise to the rank of major general. Roy was educated at Melbourne Grammar School, where he acquired the nickname \\"Ginger\\" after his red hair. He joined the Victorian Military Forces as a bugler in 1900, serving with them and the Australian Military Forces until 1905. He considered a full-time military career but this was precluded by the discovery of a heart murmur. After graduating from Melbourne Grammar in 1903, Burston entered University of Melbourne in 1905, where he lived at Trinity College and studied medicine. He graduated with his Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) degrees in June 1910, and soon after his graduation he became a resident medical officer at Adelaide Children's Hospital. In 1911 and 1912, he served in the Northern Territory as a medical inspector of Aborigines with the Aboriginal Protection Board. He returned to Adelaide where he married Helen Elizabeth Culross on 16 April 1913 in St Michael's Anglican Church at Mitcham, South Australia. He took up general practice in Mile End, South Australia. Although unable to pursue a military career, he obtained a commission as a captain in the Australian Army Medical Corps (AAMC) on 14 October 1912.The Army List of Officers of the Australian Military Forces, October 1950 World War I Burston joined the Australian Imperial Force as a major in the 4th Light Horse Field Ambulance on 26 March 1915. He embarked for Egypt on the transport Borda on 23 June 1915. In September, he went to Gallipoli with the 7th Field Ambulance, which supported his father's 7th Infantry Brigade. He served on Gallipoli from September until November, when he was evacuated to Alexandria and later England with Typhoid fever. Burston remained in hospital until September 1916, when he was posted to the 11th Field Ambulance, part of the 3rd Division, then training at Larkhill in England. He moved to France with this unit on 24 November 1916. For his conduct supervising an advanced dressing station the Battle of Messines, Burston was mentioned in despatches and awarded the Distinguished Service Order. His citation, signed by Major General John Monash, read: Later that month, Burston was appointed senior medical officer at the Australian General Base Depot at Le Havre with the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel. This rank became substantive on 18 September 1917. He was made commander of the 1st Convalescent Depot on 18 April 1918 and of the 3rd General Hospital on 22 November 1918. On 7 April 1919, he became Assistant Director of Medical Services (ADMS), AIF Depots in the United Kingdom with the temporary rank of colonel. For this work, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. He returned to Australia aboard the Orsova on 22 November 1919. Between the wars boogie board technology. Burston was promoted to major in the AAMC on 1 July 1919, lieutenant colonel on 1 July 1920, and colonel on 1 September 1921. He assumed the post of Deputy Director of Medical Services, 4th Military District in South Australia on 1 August 1921, a post he was to hold until 12 October 1939. On returning to Adelaide in 1919, he was reappointed to the staff of the Adelaide Children's Hospital. He also resumed as an honorary assistant physician at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, a post he had been appointed to in 1914. In 1933, he travelled to Scotland to further his medical knowledge, and become a member of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. On returning to Australia, he became an honorary physician at Royal Adelaide Hospital. He also began lecturing at the University of Adelaide. He was a district officer of the St John Ambulance Brigade, and vice president of the South Australian branch of the Australian Nursing Federation. In 1937 he became a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, and then one of the 41 foundation Fellows of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians in 1938. He was also honorary physician to the Governor-General from 1 July 1939 to 11 February 1943. Burston was a member of the Adelaide Club, South Australian Cricket Association and the Melbourne Club. He was a committee member of the Adelaide amateur Turf Club, and made an annual trip back to Melbourne for the Melbourne Cup. A tall man at , he was awarded the Royal Humane Society of Australasia's Bronze Medal for saving the life of a youth caught in the rip while surfing at Victor Harbor, South Australia in 1927. He had three children: Samuel Gerald Wood (Sam) Burston became a grazier; Robin Archibald (Bob) Burston became a physician like his father; and Helen Elizabeth (Betty), who married Chris Sangster, an Adelaide physician on 12 January 1939. Both sons and son in law would serve in the Army during the Second World War. World War II=Middle East Embarkation for the Middle East. Left to right: Brigadier Rowell, Colonel Burston, Major Knight and General Blamey. In October 1939, the Director General of Medical Services (DGMS), Major General Rupert Downes, tapped Burston for the post of Assistant Director of Medical Services (ADMS) of the 6th Division. Burston officially joined the Second Australian Imperial Force on 13 October 1939 with the rank of colonel, and received the serial number VX2 (VX1 being Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Blamey). When I Corps was formed in April 1940, Burston was appointed to its staff as Deputy Director of Medical Services (DDMS). As such, he was promoted to Brigadier on 1 July 1940. Burston departed for the Middle East by Qantas flying boat along with Blamey and Brigadier Sydney Rowell on 12 June 1940, the party wearing civilian clothes as they were travelling through neutral countries. In November, Blamey organised a Headquarters, AIF in the Middle East and appointed Burston as its Director of Medical Services (DMS). The Australian Government had appointed Major General Rupert Downes to this post, but it deferred to Blamey. Burston was promoted to Major General on 16 February 1941. Burston believed in personal reconnaissance and leading from the front. He was at the forefront of providing the medical arrangements for Operation Compass. He attempted, in the face of equipment shortages, to anticipate medical problems and so far as possible to prevent or avoid them. He dispatched Major Ian Murray Mackerras to investigate fly breeding in order to prevent an outbreak of diarrhoea. Burston gave Mackerras a free hand to tackle hygiene problems. His participation in the Battle of Greece was of brief duration; he embarked on 10 April 1941 and was back less than two weeks later. While there, he visited the front and was caught up in an air raid at Elassona. The disaster in Greece greatly exacerbated the ongoing problem of medical equipment, as losses included the complete equipment of three field ambulances, two casualty clearing stations, a 600-bed hospital and one 1200-bed general hospital. In July 1941, Burston reported that Australians on leave in Cairo from the Siege of Tobruk were underweight, and expressed doubts that the 9th Division might have the physical stamina to resist an attack. Burston and Colonel Neil Hamilton Fairley met with the 9th Division's commander, Major General Leslie Morshead, as did Blamey, with the result that Blamey sought its relief. This led to showdowns first between Blamey and General Sir Claude Auchinleck, and then between the British and Australian governments. Burston was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 14 April 1942; his citation, written by Blamey, read: South West Pacific Headquarters I Corps on the deck of the Orcades. Major General Burston is in the front row, centre. Burston departed the Middle East for Batavia on 22 January 1942. He narrowly avoided capture when it fell, departing on the Orcades on 21 February 1942. On 8 May 1942, Burston became DGMS at GHQ (Australia), which soon became Land Headquarters (LHQ). In this position, he found himself in charge of officers like Downes who were senior to him militarily, and others like Fairley and Mackerras who \\"were, in truth, superior to him in intellectual distinction and professional status.\\" He made numerous visits to the front in Papua-New Guinea, during September, November and December 1942, July 1943, and June 1944. On his visit to Papua in September 1942, Blamey asked Burston to intercede with Rowell, the relationship between Blamey and Rowell having broken down as a result of the Rowell's supersession by Blamey on the orders of General Douglas MacArthur and Prime Minister John Curtin. Burston failed to placate Rowell, and Rowell was relieved. The 1942 Papuan campaign threw up a host of serious medical problems. The poor diet, mainly caused by the difficulty of supply by air or over jungle tracks, caused malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies. Poor hygiene led to dysentery. Malaria was hyperendemic, and when Fairley and Mackerras visited Papua in June 1942 they found high rates of infection among the troops even before the fighting had begun. At Milne Bay the incidence was so high in September 1942 that it looked like the garrison would be wiped out in a matter of months. The biggest killer, though, was typhus. Of the 2,839 soldiers who came down with it, 257 (9 percent) died. It fell to Burston promulgate the policies and practices that diminished the danger from disease and allowed the Australian Army to fight in New Guinea. In April 1945, Burston visited South East Asia Command, and then travelled to the United Kingdom, where he ratified a series of agreements on the exchange of information regarding the development of new drugs, and for the funding of research scholarships by the Rockefeller Foundation and Carnegie Corporation of New York. He was returning to Australia when the war ended. Later life Burston was appointed a Knight of Grace of the Venerable Order of Saint John in 1944. He became Chief Commissioner of St John Ambulance Australia in March 1945, serving until 1957, after which he became Receiver-General of the Priory in Australia. He became an Honorary Physician to the King in August 1945, and a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of London. Blamey recommended Burston for a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in September 1945, along with Frank Berryman, James Cannan, John Northcott, Jack Stevens and George Wootten. The recommendation was turned down by the Labor government as it was not Labor Party policy to award knighthoods at this time. Following the election of the coalition government in the 1949 election, Blamey wrote to the new Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, again requesting honours for his generals. This time he was successful, and Burston was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (military division) in 1952. Burston remained DGMS after the war. In the immediate post-war period, he was responsible for the demobilisation of the Army Medical Services, and for providing medical support to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan. Criticism of the medical arrangements, which Burston felt might lead to the force being prematurely withdrawn, led to Burston being publicly rebuked by the Army Minister, Cyril Chambers. Burston retired as DGMS and from the Army in 1948, handing over to Kingsley Norris. He served as honorary colonel of the Royal Australian Army Medical Corps from 1952 to 1957. Rather than resume his medical practice in Adelaide, Burston chose to remain in Melbourne. In 1950, he delivered the Rupert Downes Memorial Lecture based on his book on Medical Aspects of Atomic Warfare. Burston served as director of several companies, including David Syme & Co. (the publisher of The Age newspaper), Western Mining Corporation, Great Western Consolidated, New Coolgardie, and Koolgardie Southern. He was a medical advisor to the Australian Red Cross and National Mutual Life Association. In retirement, Burston enjoyed playing golf and tennis, and was involved in thoroughbred racing, both as a punter and as a racehorse owner. He was elected Chairman of the Moonee Valley Racing Club following the death of C. F. (Charlie) Taylor in 1952. Burston increased the prize money of the Cox Plate, taking ¬£1,000 from the Moonee Valley Cup and adding another ¬£1,000 to give the two races equal prize money of ¬£4,000. This made the Cox Plate the richest weight for age race in Australia. In announcing the decision, Burston described the prize money as \\"fitting to the class of horses competing\\", noting that it had drawn fields with winners such as Phar Lap in 1930 and 1931; Chatham in 1932 and 1934; Ajax in 1938; Flight in 1945 and 1946; and Hydrogen, the 1952 winner that would go on to win it again in 1953. In 1956, Burston announced a long range plan to increase the prize money to ¬£10,000, although this would not be achieved until 1964. Crowds at the race meetings at Moonee Valley had fallen from an average of 35,000 per meeting in 1948‚Äì49 to 25,000 in 1952‚Äì53. To lure punters back, the club expanded facilities. A new public grandstand, named the Burston Grandstand in his honour, was built at a cost of ¬£200,000. This facility was first used for the Cox Plate meeting in 1958. Burston died at his home in South Yarra from a ruptured aortic aneurysm on 21 August 1960. He was survived by his daughter Elizabeth, who was married to Dr Christopher Sangster, an Adelaide physician, and his sons Samuel (later Sir Samuel Burston), a pastoralist in the Western District of Victoria, and Robin, a physician at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Adelaide. A military funeral was held at Christ Church, South Yarra on 25 August. Burston's pall bearers included Major Generals Leslie Beavis, George Canet, Ronald McNicoll, Kingsley Norris, William Refshauge, Robert Risson and Colin Simpson. Mourners included Lieutenant General Sir John Northcott; William Samuel Cox, representing the Moonee Valley Racing Club; and Sir Frederick Thomas, the Lord Mayor of Melbourne. Burston's remains were cremated at the Springvale Crematorium, and his ashes were placed with those of Helen, who had died in 1958, in the gardens there. A portrait by Sir William Dargie was purchased by a fund subscribed to by a large number of medical officers and presented to him at The Australasian Medical Congress in Perth, Western Australia in 1948. Today, it is at the Latchford Barracks. A 1990 portrait by Barbara August hangs in the boardroom of the Moonee Valley Racing Club. Another, by Sir Ivor Hele, is held by the Australian War Memorial.

In 2018, he was elected to the Oregon State Senate, representing District 3. Personal background Golden was born in Los Angeles, California, the second of four children born to Lane and Jack Golden. His siblings include KC Golden, Policy Director for the Seattle based Climate Change Advocacy group Climate Solutions; Michael Golden, a tribal judge in Humboldt County, California; and Jesse Golden. Jeff grew up in Beverly Hills, California, and graduated from Beverly Hills High School in 1968 as the Student Body President and at the top of his class. Golden attended Harvard as a Harvard National Scholar, a scholarship program established in honor of Harvard‚Äôs 300th anniversary with the goal of encouraging and enabling a small number of the best students from across the nation to attend the university. At college, Golden was active in efforts in opposition to the Vietnam War. In May 1970, he tried to join the Venceremos Brigade, but was turned down. Instead, Golden volunteered with northern students to support the work of Featherfield Farm, the first ever sharecroppers' cooperative, created under the Georgia Council on Human Relations in Southwest Georgia. The experience inspired Golden to leave Harvard and try to build a sustainable life on a plot of land in rural Southern Oregon, an experience chronicled in Golden's first published book, Watermelon Summer: A Journal. In the early 1970s, Golden worked as a river guide for American River Touring Association. Golden and his then girlfriend Catherine Shaw were featured in the 1978 documentary film Riverdogs by fellow Harvard alumnus Robb Moss. The film followed 17 people on a month-long rafting trip down the Colorado River. The couple were married the next year. In 1980, Golden was accepted into the Stanford University‚Äôs Broadcast Communications master's program after publishing Watermelon Summer, an essay about his life in the 1970s. The couple had two children before divorcing in 1994, and Shaw went on to have a career as a politician and political consultant. Both appeared in the 2003 documentary film The Same River Twice, a follow-up to Riverdogs.

After opting to not run in August 2007, he started a new independent radio program called Immense Possibilities Radio (IPR). The purpose behind IPR, as describe by PERC.org, is to \\"strengthen civic involvement and harness the power of talk radio for quality, open-minded dialogue. By bringing individuals together on the air, Golden wants to minimize conflicts over ideology and focus on ‚Äòwhat works.‚Äô\\" Political career Golden served as County Commissioner for Jackson County, Oregon from 1987-1991. During this time, he became involved in the spotted owl controversy and petitions for his recall circulated among logging advocacy groups. One result in the wake of the controversy was his nomination for the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation Profile and Courage award, the nation's most prestigious honor for elected public servants Golden was the first nominee from Oregon. In 1990, after narrowly losing to fourth-term Republican incumbent Lenn Hannon for a seat in the State Senate, Golden took the position of Bill Bradbury‚Äôs Chief of Staff in 1993. Bradbury was President of the Oregon Senate at the time. In July 2007, Golden announced his intention to run against Gordon Smith for the US Senate seat for Oregon. Golden stepped out of the election in August 2007.

The Mapuche resented the Spanish intruding into their territory and building forts, and also the insolence of those officials called capitan de amigos (Captain of Friends), introduced by a clause in the Parliament of Malloco for guarding the missionaries, but that had sought to exercise surveillance and authority over the native Mapuche which they used to establish a monopoly of the trade in ponchos which the Mapuche found unbearable. For these grievances, they met and determined, in 1722, to create a Toqui, and have recourse to war. Vilumilla was chosen, despite being a man of low rank, because he was one who had acquired a high reputation for his judgment, courage and his larger strategic view of the war to come.According to Juan Ignacio Molina, The Geographical, Natural, and Civil History of Chili, Vol. II, Chap. 10 pg. 297‚Äì298; Vilumillas object was the expulsion of the Spaniards from the whole of Chile. To succeed in this he sought, like Lautaro, to obtain the support of the Picunche, Promaucaes and all the other Chilean Indians, from Peru to the Bio-bio River. After killing three or four Spaniards, and one of the Captains of Friends in a skirmish, Vilumilla dispatched messengers, with one of their fingers, to the natives in the Spanish provinces, inviting them to revolt at a signal of fires upon the tops of the highest mountains in their provinces. On the 9th of March, 1723, the day of the declaration of hostilities, fires were set upon the mountains of Copiapo, Coquimbo, Quillota, Rancagua, Maule and Itata. However for various reasons the natives in the north, made no movement. Vilumilla set out to attack the Spanish settlements in 1723. However he was careful to warn the missionaries to quit the country, in order to avoid any being ill treated by his army. The capture of the fort of Tucapel was his first success and the garrison of the fort of Arauco, fearing the same fate, abandoned it. Having destroyed these two places he marched against the fort of Pur√©n, but the garrison commander Urrea, opposed him so effectively that he was forced to besiege it. However in a short time the garrison was reduced to desperation from thirst, for the Mapuche had cut the aqueduct which supplied them with water. The commander made a sortie in order to procure some water and was slain together with his soldiers. At this critical point, the governor Gabriel Cano arrived with an army of five thousand men. Vilumilla, expecting battle immediately drew up his troops in order of battle behind a torrential river. Seeing this position Cano, though repeatedly provoked by the Mapuche, thought it advisable to abandon Pur√©n, and retire with the garrison. The war afterwards became reduced to minor skirmishes, which was finally ended by the Parliament of Negrete of 1726, in which both sides signed the Peace of Negrete, where the Treaty of Quillan was reconfirmed, a system of regulated fairs were established and the hated title of Captain of Friends was abolished.

Built in 1874, the depot was designed by Nathaniel J. Bradlee in an eclectic Russian Victorian style. The station is also the terminus for the Conway Scenic Railroad. Northwest of the station stands a roundhouse, which now houses the Scenic Railroad's rolling stock; it was built around the same time as the station. The yard and depot were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. History The North Conway Depot was built by the Portsmouth, Great Falls & Conway Railroad in 1874, two years after the Conway Branch was completed. The Portsmouth, Great Falls & Conway was absorbed by the Boston and Maine Railroad in 1890. The station served the village of North Conway for 87 years. With the exception of the small hamlet of Intervale just to the north, North Conway was the northern terminus of the Conway Branch (the southern terminus being Boston), and saw heavy use in the summer, North Conway being a popular resort destination. Beginning in 1932, downhill skiing made North Conway an increasingly popular destination, and dedicated skier trains unloaded their passengers at the depot. In the mid-20th century, passenger rail travel declined due to competition with automobile transport. In the later years of passenger service, the Boston & Maine stopped operating traditional locomotive-and- coaches trains, and switched to Budd Rail Diesel Cars. Finally, on 3 December 1961 passenger service to North Conway was abandoned. Just over 10 years later, on 30 October 1972, freight service was also discontinued, and the station, yard, and rail line were abandoned. Abandonment did not last long. In 1974, three local businessmen and a host of volunteers restored the abandoned terminal and founded a new heritage railway called the Conway Scenic Railroad. More restoration work was done in 1996. Architecture As the northern terminal, North Conway Depot was built to be the most impressive station on the Conway Branch. Architect Nathaniel J. Bradlee used a unique, Russian- inspired Victorian design. The station's floor plan includes a ticket office, a baggage room, and two waiting rooms (one for men and one for women). One of the waiting rooms now serves as a gift shop. Two curving mahogany staircases lead to offices in metal-sheathed domed towers on the second level. An eight- day E. Howard & Co. clock faces the town. The area immediately in front of the station is an open park. In addition to the station, the yard also includes a freight station, some maintenance of way sheds, and a four-stall roundhouse with an air-powered turntable, all of which are contemporary with the passenger depot. The roundhouse and turntable are still used by the Conway Scenic Railroad for maintenance and operations of their equipment, and the freight station houses a model railroad. There is also a baggage car that was converted by the Boston & Maine into a crew bunkhouse in 1949, and it too is still used for this purpose by the heritage railroad. Appearances in film In the 2005 Christmas television film, The 12 Dogs of Christmas, starring Jordan-Claire Green, the North Conway Depot was filmed in several scenes during the beginning of the film.https://latterdaysaintmag.com/article-1-1264/ See also * Cranmore Mountain Resort * Eastern Slope Inn * National Register of Historic Places listings in Carroll County, New Hampshire References Category:Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in New Hampshire Category:National Register of Historic Places in Carroll County, New Hampshire Category:North Conway, New Hampshire Category:Railroad museums in New Hampshire Category:Railway buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in New Hampshire Category:Railway depots on the National Register of Historic Places Category:Railway stations on the National Register of Historic Places in New Hampshire Category:Tourist attractions in Carroll County, New Hampshire Category:Transportation buildings and structures in Carroll County, New Hampshire ","title":"North Conway Depot and Railroad Yard"},{"id":"18697221","text":"Agneta Prytz (15 December 1916 ‚Äì 4 July 2008) was a Swedish movie and stage actress who appeared in thirty-six films over the course of her career.

Early career The Wichita, Kansas, native was a former minor league catcher who had toiled as an executive in the Cub farm system for the Visalia Cubs of the California League, Des Moines Bruins of the Western League, and Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League ‚Äî then the Cubs' top farm team.Clark, Carl, The 1980 Official Baseball Guide. St. Louis: The Sporting News, 1980. GM during 'College of Coaches' era Holland was promoted from the PCL Angels to succeed Wid Matthews as general manager of the Cubs after the end of the 1956 season. He brought with him Bob Scheffing as the Cubs' new manager. Scheffing, a former Cub catcher and coach, had won the PCL pennant with the Angels in 1956. But the Cubs were in the midst of a two-decade-long tenancy in the second division of the National League. After Scheffing and his successors, Charlie Grimm and Lou Boudreau, could not rouse the club from its doldrums, owner Philip K. Wrigley decided on a radical departure after the 1960 season: the Cubs became the only team in the history of Major League Baseball to dispense with the position of field manager. Wrigley's College of Coaches employed a series of rotating (and then more permanent) \\"head coaches\\" from 1961 to 1965. In 1963, the experiment seemed to hold promise, as head coach Bob Kennedy led the team to an 82‚Äì80 finish, the Cubs' first winning record since 1946. But they reverted to losing seasons in 1964‚Äì65, and the College of Coaches experiment was abandoned at the end of the 1965 season, when Leo Durocher was hired to manage the Cubs. Holland made perhaps the most notorious trade in Cubs' history during the same period. He traded talented young outfielder Lou Brock to the St. Louis Cardinals for righthanded pitcher Ernie Broglio in June 1964. Brock came into his own that season, helping the Cardinals to a World Series triumph, going on to be part of two more pennant winners and one more World Series winner before his Hall of Fame career ended. Broglio, an 18-game-winner in , turned out to have elbow problems that would require off-season surgery in 1964 and ended his major league career within two years. Built contending late-1960s team The team of Durocher and Holland floundered in 1966, when the Cubbies finished dead last in the National League. But beginning in 1967, the Cubs jumped into contention in the NL with a series of first division ballclubs and six straight above .500 campaigns, led by four Baseball Hall of Famers ‚Äî Billy Williams, Ferguson Jenkins, Ernie Banks and Ron Santo ‚Äî and featuring other stars like Glenn Beckert, Don Kessinger and Randy Hundley. Banks was already a mainstay with the Cubs by 1956, but Holland's scouts (including the legendary Buck O'Neil) had signed and developed Williams, Santo and Kessinger, and Holland acquired Jenkins, Hundley and Beckert through trades and the Rule 5 draft. The 1969 Cubs broke from the gate quickly and appeared headed for the National League East Division championship but were overtaken by the \\"Miracle\\" New York Mets. That team, which finished at 92‚Äì70 and eight games out of the division lead, proved to be the most successful outfit of the Holland era, as the Cubs gradually sank back in the NL East standings, reverting to their losing ways in 1973. Holland retired two seasons later and was replaced by E. R. \\"Salty\\" Saltwell, the Cubs' longtime treasurer.http://www.thebaseballcube.com/managers/gms/Salty-Saltwell.shtml John Holland died in Chicago at the age of 69.

Description Osman Hill's mangabey is a medium-sized lanky, arboreal, dark furred monkey. The sexes are similar in colour and markings but males are far larger than females, the size difference being especially marked in this species compared to the other members of the grey-cheeked mangabey superspecies. They have long, loose fur which is mainly blackish-brown, and a rufous tinged mane of longer hairs over the shoulders which is more noticeable in the males. The head shows a tuft on the crown and smaller tuft above the eyes, although these may not always be present, the cheeks are pale. The long tail is frequently held arched over the monkey's back. The two ischial callosities are bare and for a \\"C\\" shapes which are complete in the male but often broken in the females. The bare skin on such places as the palms and soles is pink in newborns but darkens as the get older and is normally black by nine months of age. A single male specimen has been measured and he had a head and body length of 610mm and a tail length of 920mm. Distribution Osman Hill's mangabey has a very small range from the Cross River in south eastern Nigeria to the Batouri district of south eastern Cameroon. Habitat Osman Hill's mangabey occurs in low to medium altitude tropical rainforest where it is highly arboreal and can be seen in the canopy and emergent layers. It is rarely observed on the ground or in secondary or savanna habitats. The highest densities are found in swamp forest and flooded forest. Habits This species and its close relatives have cheek pouches which they can use to store food to be eaten or processed later. The males have inflatable throat pouches which they use as resonators to amplify their loud low pitched calls which can be heard over a kilometre away from the calling male. They have powerful jaws, hands and arms which makes it possible for them to extract seeds from harder fruits, e.g. those of Monodora myristica than similarly sized monkeys. They are omnivorous, although fruit is the most important part of their diet, and they may locate fruiting trees by following the calls of frugivorous birds such as hornbills. Important fruit tree species for Odsman Hill's mangabey include Erythrophleum suaveolens and Enantia chlorantha. They also spend a lot of time splitting dead wood, excavating bark and searching through liana tangles and epiphyte masses searching for invertebrates. Osman Hill's mangabey is a social species living in groups of 10-20 individuals which consist of a few males, several females and their dependent young. These groups often associate with groups of other monkey species, and even occasionally with troops of chimpanzees. Contact calls are grunts, alarm calls are staccato barks and the males make a loud \\"whoop gobble\\" to co-ordinate the group and to set spaces between different groups. This call can be made by females but very infrequently. The groups are fluid and will mix but this can lead to increased aggression among the adults, although the young will play. Females in oestrus may attract additional males. The dominant male usually guards receptive females but she will try and mate with other males when she can. Taxonomy Osman Hill's mangabey used to be considered a subspecies of the grey-cheeked mangabey, L. albigena. Etymology Osman Hill's mangabey was named after William Charles Osman Hill, a primatologist, anthropologist, and anatomist from the 20th century.

Lysak (August 16, 1914 ‚Äì January 8, 2020) was an American canoeist who competed in the Olympic Games in 1936 in Berlin. Born in New Jersey but raised in an orphanage in New York, he competed in the 1936 Olympics in Men's Folding Kayak Doubles, 10 kilometres, finishing seventh. After a stint in the United States Marine Corps during World War II, Lysak attended Springfield College and worked as a painting contractor until the age of 62. Early life Lysak was born in Bound Brook, New Jersey, on August 16, 1914. His brother, Steven Lysak, was a gold and silver medal-winning canoeist at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. When John was four years old, his mother died in the 1918 flu pandemic, and his father was forced to send his two sisters to live with relatives in New York. The Lysak brothers, however, were sent to an orphanage in New Jersey for two years, before being transferred to Yonkers, New York. In their spare time, the duo constructed homemade boats along the Hudson River using tar paper and barrel staves. They soon joined a local rowing club after their talent caught the attention of the members. There John met James O'Rourke, who was to become his partner at the 1936 Summer Olympics. Olympic career On their journey to Berlin, Lysak and O'Rourke destroyed much of the equipment in the ship's gymnasium and were prohibited from entering it for most of the trip. Lysak competed with O'Rourke in Men's Folding Kayak Doubles, 10 kilometres, on a lake just outside the capital city. The duo did not win a medal, placing seventh in the competition. While observing some of the athletic events, he claims to have witnessed Adolf Hitler refusing to congratulate or shake the hand of Jesse Owens. On the return journey to the United States, Lysak encountered Owens and inquired about the incident. According to Lysak, Owens responded that \\"that kind of thing had been going on his whole life. He'd gotten used to it.\\" After the Games, Lysak never returned to Europe. Later life Lysak returned to the United States and graduated from Springfield College in Massachusetts, where he met his wife, June. He served as a United States Marine during World War II in the South Pacific. After the war, Lysak moved to California to work as a painting contractor, until he retired at the age of 62. His wife, with whom he had two sons, died in 2001. Lysak was able to kayak until 2002 and was reported to be in fair health in 2008, at which point he was living in Fremont, California, with his two sons. At the time he was reported to be the San Francisco Bay Area's oldest living former Olympian, although he did not display any memorabilia from the Games in his house.

From left to right are dancers Teneise Mitchell, Mora Amina Parker, Erin Barnett, Erin Moore, and Tracy Vog. The Philadelphia Dance Company (also known as Philadanco) is a professional dance company based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, that specializes in contemporary dance. The organization was founded in 1970 by Artistic Director Joan Myers Brown. The company tours both nationally and internationally in addition to their regular appearances locally at the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, the Painted Bride Art Center, and other venues in the Philadelphia area. Part of the company's tour schedule is supported by the National Endowment for the Arts' Regional Arts Touring Program and the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts. History The Philadelphia Dance Company (Philadanco) was created in 1970 by Joan Myers Brown with the intention of providing a dance institution for African-American students who were not welcome in other schools and companies. Divisions Philadanco conducts programs that are divided into four main components: the professional company, D/2 Apprentice Company, an Instruction and Training Program, and a Summer Training Program. Professional Company The professional company of Philadanco is an internationally recognized modern dance company. Throughout the year, the company provides countless performances throughout the year via domestic and international tours, and at their home theater, Philadelphia's Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, during the months of fall and spring. Philadanco also established the International Association of Blacks in Dance (IABD), an organization that allows the black dance community to address common issues, pool their resources, and establish collaborations which result in beneficial advancements to the dance community as a whole. Repertory Philadanco's repertory includes numerous works from pioneers of modern dance such as Christopher Huggins and Jawole Willa Jo Zollar. The professional company's original choreographies and choreographers have been inspiring mentors to other emerging companies in the area. The prevalence of these original works serve as a testament to Philadanco's artistic abilities as they have weathered the challenges faced by many Black modern dance companies. Below is a list of the pieces currently included in Philadanco's repertory: * Back to Bach, by Eleo Pomare * Ballet: The Blues and the Bible ‚Äì Genesis, by Geoffrey Holder * Between Earth and Home, by Jawole Willa Jo Zollar * Blue, by Christopher L. Huggins * Circular Ruins, by Elisa Monte * Echoes: A Celebration of Alvin Ailey, by Milton Myers * Elegy by Gene Hill Sagan * Enemy Behind the Gates, Christopher Huggins * Everything is Everything, by Lynne Taylor-Corbett * For Mother, by Ronald K.

It claims to provide unrivaled experience opportunities for young dancers who are not prepared to make the full transition to the world of professional dance. D/2 is under the instruction of Donald T. Lunsford, and when smaller organizations request a Philadanco performance, D/2 is able to fill the void that might have been left due to the professional company's hectic performance schedule.

This program is the foundation of Philadanco's structure as it allows the young people of Philadelphia early and intense exposure to dance in the hopes that their talents will serve to raise the caliber of Philadanco's future apprentice and professional companies. Students receive training in numerous styles of dance including: ballet, jazz, African, tap, and specific modern techniques such as established by Katherine Dunham and Lester Horton. Their annual concert, ‚ÄúDanco on Danco‚Äù allows the students to demonstrate their dance and choreographic skills acquired through the Instruction and Training Program. Summer Training Program Through the summer, Philadanco redirects its focus to preparing younger students for entry into the Instruction and Training Program. Although students from the Instruction and Training program commonly participate in both outlets, the summer program can act as an intense ‚Äúcrash-course‚Äù providing insight to the rigors of a dancer's lifestyle. Training is provided in the three core genres of dance: ballet, jazz, and modern. Community Outreach In addition to providing dance education, Philadanco is an active participant in the arts community and a strong supporter of arts education. A few of the company's more notable accomplishments include * Establishment of the International Association of Blacks in Dance (IABD). * Being the pilot dance company to participate in the state of Pennsylvania's Comprehensive Education Training Act to create an arts training program. * Providing an extension of The Philadelphia School of Dance Arts, and providing underprivileged dancers with opportunities for scholarships and work-study programs to ensure arts education to all.

It is a leaf-eating monkey. It has been reported from Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh in northwestern India but evidence indicates it only occurs in the Chamba Valley in Himachal Pradesh. Because of its restricted range, fragmented population and threats from human agriculture and development activities it is listed as Endangered in the IUCN Red List. In Pakistan it occurs in Machiara National Park. It was formerly considered a subspecies of Semnopithecus entellus and is one of several Semnopithecus species named after characters from The Iliad, along with Semnopithecus hector and Semnopithecus priam.  Ecology and behaviour  It is arboreal and diurnal, and lives in temperate and alpine forests at elevations between . The birthing season for the Kashmir gray langur runs from January through June, although almost half of all infants are born in March. The infants are weaned at a higher age than most Asian colobines. While most Asian colobines wean their young within the first year, Kashmir gray langurs wean their young on average at 25 months. This is apparently due to nutritional constraints, since monkeys in poorer sites wean their young at an older age. The interbirth interval for females is about 2.4 years. Alloparental care occurs in Kashmir's gray langur for up to 5 months. Males are usually protective of infants, but infanticide occasionally occurs. Although most Asian colobine groups comprise only a single adult male and multiple females, multimale groups are known to occur within Semnopithecus species. With Kashmir's Gray Langur, multimale groups may include as many as five adult males. Females initiate copulation by soliciting a male, but not all solicitations result in copulation.

Congregation Sha'arai Shomayim is the oldest Jewish congregation in the state of Alabama and one of the oldest Reform Jewish congregations in the United States. Located in Mobile, the congregation was formally organized in 1844. The current synagogue for the congregation is the Springhill Avenue Temple. History The first permanent Jewish presence in Mobile can be documented back to 1763. Most of these early Jews were merchants and traders, having moved to Mobile after the French lost their North American possessions to Great Britain in the Treaty of Paris. Jews were not allowed to officially reside in colonial French Louisiana due to the infamous Code Noir, a decree passed by France's King Louis XIV in 1685. It is known that the code was rarely enforced in the colony, but there is no documentation of Jews residing in Mobile at that time. The first prominent Jewish citizens of Mobile were George Davis, an Englishman from Tuscaloosa, Alabama; Dr. Solomon Mordecai from North Carolina; and Philip Phillips, an attorney from Charleston, South Carolina. Phillips was later elected to the Alabama State Legislature and then to the United States Congress. By the time of Phillips election to Congress in 1853, over fifty Jewish families were living in Mobile. Although no records survive that document the spiritual activities of Mobile's earliest Jewish citizens, on June 22, 1841 Congregation Sha'arai Shomayim purchased plots in the city's Magnolia Cemetery. Despite the earlier purchase of burial plots, the congregation did not become officially organized until January 25, 1844 when a constitution and bylaws were registered with the Mobile County Probate Court. The constitution was signed by Israel Jones, president; David Solomon, vice-president; L.H. Goldsmith, treasurer; and D. Unger, B.L. Tim, and Roshon as trustees. The congregation's full name in the document is listed as Sha‚Äôarai Shomayim U - Maskil El Dol or Gates of Heaven and Society of Friends of the Needy. At the time of organization, the congregation had over fifty contributing members. They then began planning the erection of a place of worship. Early synagogues The second Jackson Street Synagogue, in 1900. Home of Sha'arai Shomayim from 1857 to 1907. During 1844 and 1845, Congregation Sha'arai Shomayim held services on Friday evenings and Shabbat morning in private homes. On March 13, 1846, the congregation appointed its first rabbi, Benjamin da Silva. On December 27, 1846, they dedicated their first temple, the Emanuel Street Synagogue, located between Government and Church Streets. The first marriage ceremony was performed there on July 25, 1847. In late 1848, Benjamin da Silva moved to New Orleans and Baruch M. Emanuel was appointed to lead the congregation. By 1850, the need for a new house of worship was apparent and the congregation purchased the old Musical Association Hall, a building that could accommodate 300 worshipers. The congregation had outgrown the Musical Association Hall almost as soon as they moved into it. On March 11, 1853 they dedicated their Jackson Street Synagogue. The building had been built as a Unitarian church in 1846. Baruch Emanuel gave up leading the congregation in early 1853, before services had been held in the new building. Julius Eckman was appointed as the new rabbi but quickly fell into disfavor. He was succeeded by Dr. Isaac Schatz. The congregation suffered a catastrophe on December 11, 1856 when the new synagogue burned down. A stove in the basement caught the wooden building on fire. The congregation turned to selling subscriptions in order to rebuild on the same site. Several non-Jews contributed to the rebuilding, among them Dr. Josiah C. Nott and N. St. John. A month after the disaster the congregation published a thank you notice in the Mobile Daily Register to \\"our fellow citizens of Mobile\\" for their assistance after the fire. By the end of March 1857 the members had collected $3,555 in donations and on June 2, 1857 the congregation broke ground for a new synagogue. The new building would be stuccoed brick in the Greek Revival style with Ionic columns. The Civil War years With the coming of the American Civil War, Congregation Sha'arai Shomayim saw many of its members serving in the Confederate States Army. Men known to have served include Moses Holberg, S. Pickard, Adolph Proskauer, Joseph Proskauer, S. Rosewald, M.H. Rochotsch, L. Siegel, J. Sonnentheil, S. Stein, Nathan Strauss, and Leopold Strauss. Congregation members known to have died in the conflict include Joel Jones and Conrad Weill. The congregation created a Hebrew Military Relief Association with a mission of aiding Confederate soldiers and their families. Its initial assets were $1,416. Cemetery The congregation's old cemetery in a section of Magnolia Cemetery was full by the 1870s, making a new cemetery a necessity. The congregation purchased land for the new cemetery, now known as Sha'arai Shomayim Cemetery, from William and Caroline Leinkauf on March 17, 1876. They adopted a number of resolutions for governing the new cemetery and placed the lot prices at $50 per lot. The new site, near Magnolia Cemetery, was consecrated on December 3, 1876. The cemetery was laid out by Samuel Brown, the congregation's vice president. He had live oaks planted around the perimeter of the grounds, and in 1890 the ornamental cast-iron gate and fence was installed. The first burial was that of Israel Jones, on December 28, 1876. One of the most notable interments to ever take place in the cemetery was that of Esau Frohlichstein on May 14, 1914. He was one of fourteen American soldiers killed in the U.S. siege of Veracruz during the Mexican Revolution. Thousands of Mobilians took part in his burial service and his marker is inscribed with a letter that he wrote to his parents the night before the attack. In part it reads, \\"Don't be afraid if I get killed. For the old saying 'Rather die a hero than live a coward' will land at Vera Cruz in about four hours.\\"Sledge, John Sturdivant. Cities of Silence: A Guide to Mobile's Historic Cemeteries, pages 80-89. Tuscaloosa, Alabama: University of Alabama Press, 2002. Later synagogues The Government Street Temple circa 1910. Home of Sha'arai Shomayim from 1907 to 1952. Plans for a new and larger synagogue began to take shape in the first decade of the 20th century, with the cornerstone for the new temple laid on June 6, 1906 at the corner of Government and Warren Streets. Alabama Lieutenant Governor Russell McWhortor Cunningham was the featured speaker for the event. A building fund of $25,400 had been accumulated, but the congregation president, Jacob Pollock, estimated that $5000 more was needed to complete a structure that would \\"honor the Jewish population of Mobile.\\" Construction continued and the new Government Street Temple was dedicated on June 21, 1907. The dedication had been delayed by a week due to the organ not being completed. Eight rabbis took part in the dedication processional: Max Heller of New Orleans; Henry Ettleson of Fort Wayne, Indiana; Bernard Ehrenreich of Montgomery, Alabama; Jacob Schwarz of Pensacola, Florida; David Marx of Atlanta, Georgia; Max Raisin of Meridian, Mississippi; Morris Newfield of Birmingham, Alabama, and Alfred Moses. The Government Street Temple served the congregation for many years, but after World War II the population of Mobile was shifting westward out of downtown and the congregation found the Government Street Temple difficult to keep in good repair. After discovering that repairs would amount to more than $20,000, the building committee decided to sell the old building for not less than $100,000 and build a new structure. On July 18, 1952, the committee announced that it was buying a lot on Springhill Avenue for $40,000 and hiring architect T. Cooper Van Antwerp to design a new synagogue, with a budget of $250,000. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on February 21, 1954 for the new temple. Then, on September 2, 1955, a dedication ceremony for Springhill Avenue Temple was held with Dr. Julius Mark, Senior Rabbi of Temple Emanu-El in New York City, delivering the dedication sermon. Today the congregation has continued to grow to its present size of about 250 families.

Mathematical contributions Grigorchuk is most well known for having constructed the first example of a finitely generated group of intermediate growth which now bears his name and is called the Grigorchuk group (sometimes it is also called the first Grigorchuk group since Grigorchuk constructed several other groups that are also commonly studied). This group has growth that is faster than polynomial but slower than exponential. Grigorchuk constructed this group in a 1980 paperR. I. Grigorchuk. On Burnside's problem on periodic groups. (Russian) Funktsionalnyi Analiz i ego Prilozheniya, vol. 14 (1980), no. 1, pp. 53-54 and proved that it has intermediate growth in a 1984 article.R. I. Grigorchuk, Degrees of growth of finitely generated groups and the theory of invariant means. Izvestiya Akademii Nauk SSSR. Seriya Matematicheskaya. vol. 48 (1984), no. 5, pp. 939-985 This result answered a long-standing open problem posed by John Milnor in 1968 about the existence of finitely generated groups of intermediate growth. Grigorchuk's group has a number of other remarkable mathematical properties. It is a finitely generated infinite residually finite 2-group (that is, every element of the group has a finite order which is a power of 2). It is also the first example of a finitely generated group that is amenable but not elementary amenable, thus providing an answer to another long-standing problem, posed by Mahlon Day in 1957.Mahlon M. Day. Amenable semigroups. Illinois Journal of Mathematics, vol. 1 (1957), pp. 509-544. Also Grigorchuk's group is \\"just infinite\\": that is, it is infinite but every proper quotient of this group is finite. Grigorchuk's group is a central object in the study of the so-called branch groups and automata groups. These are finitely generated groups of automorphisms of rooted trees that are given by particularly nice recursive descriptions and that have remarkable self-similar properties. The study of branch, automata and self- similar groups has been particularly active in the 1990s and 2000s and a number of unexpected connections with other areas of mathematics have been discovered there, including dynamical systems, differential geometry, Galois theory, ergodic theory, random walks, fractals, Hecke algebras, bounded cohomology, functional analysis, and others. In particular, many of these self-similar groups arise as iterated monodromy groups of complex polynomials. Important connections have been discovered between the algebraic structure of self-similar groups and the dynamical properties of the polynomials in question, including encoding their Julia sets.Volodymyr Nekrashevych. Self- similar groups. Mathematical Surveys and Monographs, 117. American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2005. Much of Grigorchuk's work in the 1990s and 2000s has been on developing the theory of branch, automata and self-similar groups and on exploring these connections. For example, Grigorchuk, with co-authors, obtained a counter-example to the conjecture of Michael Atiyah about L2-betti numbers of closed manifolds.R. I. Grigorchuk, and A. Zuk.

Male on Sri Lanka Female on Sri Lanka Pregnant tufted grey langur at Chinnar wildlife sanctuary Evolution There are two subspecies, Semnopithecus priam priam in India, and Semnopithecus priam thersites from Sri Lanka. There are two theories about the evolution of these two subspecies. According to one theory, Semnopithecus priam arose from subspecies Semnopithecus vetulus philbricki. With the glacial fluctuations, and far apart of Indian subcontinent, pushed two taxa apart, but both retained key adaptation to folivory, and a ruminant-like stomach. Thereafter, S. priam invaded India, when there was a land bridge and there split off into two subspecies of S. priam. In the other theory, Sri Lankan subspecies S. priam thersites evolved from the endemic S. vetulus, whereas, Indian subspecies S. priam priam evolved from the S. johnii, which results the genetic variations between two S. priam subspecies. Habitat In Sri Lanka, tufted gray langurs are abundant in dry zone forests and also within human dwellings. Many numerous troops are found at archeologically important areas, such as Polonnaruwa, Dambulla, Anuradhapura, and Sigiriya. The animal is also found in southward of the island, such as Hambantota, Yala National Park, and Tissamaharama. Diet Mostly folivorous, tufted gray langurs are fond of eating anything vegetarian. They are known to eat fruits and seeds. Langurs are differ from leaf monkeys, where latter is known to eat mature, fleshy fruits, and langurs are like to eat partially drier fibrous fruits. The leaves of Drypetes sepiaria, Dimocarpus longan, Ficus microcarpa, Holoptelea integrifolia, and fruits and seeds of Hydnocarpus venenata, Ficus arnottiana, Macaranga peltata are known to eat by Sri Lankan subspecies.Rajnish P. Vandercone, Chameera Dinadh, Gayan Wijethunga, Kitsiri Ranawana, David T. Rasmussen (December 2012). Dietary Diversity and Food Selection in Hanuman Langurs (Semnopithecus entellus) and Purple-Faced Langurs (Trachypithecus vetulus) in the Kaludiyapokuna Forest Reserve in the Dry Zone of Sri Lanka. International Journal of Primatology . Sometimes, the troops can be seen near the water bodies, where they feed on Nelumbo nucifera seeds. Insects and everygreen leaves are eaten when others foods are less abundant and bark is only eaten when there is no other food available. The Gray Langur's diet is high in strychnine, which can be harmful to animals. Therefore, it will commonly ingest the gum of the Sterculia urens to counteract the effects. This gum is marketed in England as a prescription laxative known as Normacol. Ecology Generally a shy animal, tufted gray langurs are partially arboreal, semi-terrestrial and diurnal in habit. They always finds a way to come to the ground when there is no danger. Unlike the canopy-dweeling sympatric relatives, they are rather common in urban settlements, found in gardens, and other large fruit trees such as Mangifera indica, and Artocarpus heterophyllus. Behavior Tufted gray langurs are mainly philopatric, meaning they stick to their territories. A single troop may include about 20 to 50 individuals. Large troops are led by both large male-female combinations, whereas small troops are governed by an alpha male. Females quickly attain their heat and mate with new alpha male, even when they are not ready for the reproduction in the natural estrous cycle. Female langur gives birth to a single offspring or rarely twins, after a 6 months of gestation period. After birth, offspring is attach to the mother about 3 months with all the nourishment and other protection. Sub adult males and other males usually spend the time with searching for foods, rivals with neighboring alpha males, and protecting the troop. Females spend the time with feeding the young, grooming them, and even play with the young. Tufted gray langurs communicate with many different ways such as barks, grunts, whoops, whistles and howls. The cough like voice is used for giving tension, and whistling for the contact loss with the troop. The tufted gray langur monkey's superior eyesight and ability to sit atop high trees allows it to spot predators easily. Researchers have noted that this species will often sit next to herds of the spotted deer and notify them when a predator is approaching. Additionally, the langur will often drop fruit from tall trees, which the Spotted Deer will then feed on. In return, the Spotted Deer's excellent sense of smell allows it to detect predators early on and warn the langur that something may be approaching. Tufted gray langur (Semnopithecus priam) Baby (Sri Lanka) Predators Leopards, and Black eagles are the major predators of the tufted gray langurs. Other than them, siblings and sub adults are attacked by tigers, dhole, gray wolves, mugger crocodile, and Indian rock python occasionally. Conservation According to IUCN Red List, tufted gray langur is listed as a \\"Near Threatened\\" species, due to decline of populations in recent years. Hunting and habitat destruction also affect for the declining of the species. Some people also fond of eating langur meat in some parts of Sri Lanka. Very few occasions are recorded of being captured for pets. Numerous conservations projects are undertaken in both Sri Lankan and Indian forests and sanctuaries. Both subspecies thersites and priam are listed as \\"Near Threatened\\".

The presence of Sufism has been a leading entity increasing the reaches of Islam throughout South Asia.Schimmel, p.346 Following the entrance of Islam in the early 8th century, Sufi mystic traditions became more visible during the 10th and 11th centuries of the Delhi Sultanate and after it to the rest of India. A conglomeration of four chronologically separate dynasties, the early Delhi Sultanate consisted of rulers from Turkic and Afghan lands. This Persian influence flooded South Asia with Islam, Sufi thought, syncretic values, literature, education, and entertainment that has created an enduring impact on the presence of Islam in India today. Sufi preachers, merchants and missionaries also settled in coastal Bengal and Gujarat through maritime voyages and trade. Various leaders of Sufi orders, Tariqa, chartered the first organized activities to introduce localities to Islam through Sufism. Saint figures and mythical stories provided solace and inspiration to Hindu caste communities often in rural villages of India. The Sufi teachings of divine spirituality, cosmic harmony, love, and humanity resonated with the common people and still does so today. The following content will take a thematic approach to discuss a myriad of influences that helped spread Sufism and a mystical understanding of Islam, making India a contemporary epicenter for Sufi culture today. There are three Sufi orders 1\\\\. Silsilahs - The Sufis Formed Many orders - silshilas. By the thirteenth century, there were 12 silsilahs. 2\\\\. Khanqas - The Sufi saints live in khanqas. Devotees of religions came to these khanqas to seek the blessings of Saints. 3\\\\. Sama - Music and dances session, called Sama. Early history=Influence of Islam Muslims entered India in 711 AD under the Arab commander Muhammad bin Qasim, by conquering the regions of Sindh and Multan. This historical achievement connected South Asia to the Muslim empire. Simultaneously, Arab Muslims were welcomed along the Hindustani (India) sea ports for trade and business ventures. The Muslim culture of the caliphate began to permeate through India. Muslims conquered Multan, the capital of Sindh, and thereby expanded the Islamic empire into India. This trade route linking India to the Mediterranean world and even Southeast Asia lasted peacefully until 900. During this period, the Abbasid Caliphate (750 ‚Äì 1258) was seated in Baghdad; this city is also the birthplace of Sufism with notable figures such as Abdul Qadir Gilani, Hasan al Basri, and Rabiah.Dr. Cyrus Ali Zargar The mystic tradition of Islam gained significant ground spreading from Baghdad (Iraq) into Persia, commonly known today as Iran and Afghanistan. In 901, a Turkic military leader, Sabuktigin, established an Afghan kingdom in the city of Ghaznah. His son, Mahmud, expanded their territories into the Indian Punjab region during 1027Walsh p. 56 The resources and riches annexed from Punjab went into the Ghazni coffers to expand further into India's northwest areas.Alvi During the early 11th century, the Ghaznavids brought a wealth of scholars into India's borders, establishing the first Persian- inspired Muslim culture succeeding prior Arab influences.Schimmel p. 344 In 1151, another Central Asian group, called the Ghurids, overtook the lands of the Ghaznavids ‚Äì who did very little to monitor their lands in India.Walsh Mu‚Äôizz al-Din Ghuri, a governor of Turkic origin, initiated a major invasion of India, extending the previous Ghazni territories into Delhi and Ajmer. By 1186, northern India was indistinguishable; a combination of Baghdad's cosmopolitan culture mixed with Persian-Turkic traditions of the Ghaznah court accelerated Sufi intellectualism in India.Alvi 46 Scholars, poets, and mystics from Central Asia and Iran became integrated within India. By 1204, the Ghurids established rule in the following cities: Benaras (Varanasi), Kanaug, Rajasthan, and Bihar, which introduced Muslim rule into the Bengal region. An emphasis on translation of Arabic and Persian texts (Qu'ran, Hadith corpus, Sufi literature) into vernacular languages helped the momentum of Islamization in India.Alvi 10 Particularly in rural areas, Sufis helped Islam spread generously into prior polytheistic populations. Subsequently, the general consensus among scholars remains that there were never any forced mass conversions recorded during this early history time period.Alvi 9 Between the late 12th century and 13th century, Sufi brotherhoods became firmly consolidated in northern India.Schimmel 345 Delhi Sultanate The period of 1206 ‚Äì 1526 is labeled as the Delhi Sultanate of Raftaar.Morgan 78 This time frame consists of five separate dynasties that ruled territorial parts of India: the Mamluk or slave, Khaljis, Tughlaq, Sayyid, and Lodi dynasty. In history, the Delhi Sultanate is usually given marginal attention compared to the succeeding Mughal Dynasty.Aquil At its peak, the Delhi Sultanate controlled all of North India, Afghan frontier, and Bengal. The security of their lands protected India from the Mongol Conquests terrorizing the rest of Asia between 1206 and 1294.Zargar The Mongols also succeeded in destroying Baghdad, the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate, proving that this reign of violence was no minor feat. When the Mongol invasion penetrated Central Asia, fleeing refugees chose India as a safe destination.morgan77 This historical move can be deemed a significant catalyst of Sufi thought in India. Scholars, students, artisans, and common people arrived into the protection of Mamluk rulers, the first dynasty in the Delhi Sultanate. Soon the court had an immense influx of diverse cultures, religiosity, and literature from Persia and Central Asia; Sufism was the main ingredient in all mediums. During this medieval period, Sufism spread through various regions, expanding to the Deccan plateau with the succession of the Tughlaq dynasty of 1290 ‚Äì 1388.Aquil 9 During this time, the Muslim rulers of the Sultanate dynasties were not necessarily of orthodox Islam; yet, they were still deemed powerful. Advisors of the dynastic sultans included Muslim religious scholars (ulama) and notably, Muslim mystics (mashai‚Äôkh).Aquil 11 Although practicing Sufis rarely had political aspirations, the declining ethical reign of the Sayyid and Lodi dynasty (1414 ‚Äì 1517) required renewed leadership.Aquil 13 Development of Education=Traditional Culture During 901 - 1151, the Ghaznawids began to build numerous schools called madrasa that were attached and affiliated with masjids (mosque). This mass movement established stability in India's educational systems. Existing scholars promoted the study of the Qu'ran and hadith, beginning in North West India.Alvi 11 During the Delhi Sultanate, the intellectual diversity of India's residents increased multiple - fold due to the Mongol invasions. Various intellectuals hailing from regions such as Iran, Afghanistan, and Central Asia began to enrich the cultural and literary life of the Delhi capital.Alvi 12 Among the religious elite existing during the Sultanate time period, two major classifications existed. The ulama were noted exclusive religious scholars who had mastered certain Islamic legal branches of study. They were sharia oriented and tended to be more orthodox about Muslim practices. The other group of religious elites were the Sufi mystics, or fakir. This was a more inclusive group that was often more tolerant of non- Muslim traditions. Although the commitment to practice sharia remains a Sufi foundation, early Sufis in India focused on proselytizing through service work and helping the poor. During the Delhi Sultanate, the rise prevailing mystical approach to Islam was not a substitute for madrasa education nor traditional scholarship.Alvi 14 The teachings of sufism only built upon the foundations of a madrasa education. The spiritual orientation of Sufism only sought to refine the \\"consciousness of the divine, intensify piety, and inculcate a humanistic attitude.\\" Sufi Khanqah One reason why Islam became more favorable in India was due to the establishment of khanqah. A khanqah is commonly defined as a hospice, lodge, community center, or dormitory ran by Sufis. Khanqahs were also known as Jama'at Khana, large gathering halls. Structurally, a khanqah could be one large room or have additional dwelling space. Although some khanqah establishments were independent of royal funding or patronage, many received fiscal grants (waqf) and donations from benefactors for continuing services.Schimmel Over time, the function of traditional Sufi khanqahs evolved as Sufism solidified in India. Initially, the Sufi khanqah life emphasized a close and fruitful relationship between the master-teacher (sheikh) and their students. For example, students in khanqahs would pray, worship, study, and read works together.Schimmel 347 Sufi literature had more academic concerns besides just the jurisprudential and theological works seen in madrasa. There were three major categories of mystical works studied in South Asia: hagiographical writing, discourses of the teacher, and letters of the master. Sufis also studied various other manuals describing code of conduct, adab (Islam). In fact, the text (trans.) \\"Path of God's Bondsmen from Origin to Return\\" written by a Persian Sufi saint, Najm al-Din Razi, spread throughout India during the authors' lifetime. Sharing that Sufi thought was becoming increasingly favorable to study in India. Even today, preserved mystical literature has proved invaluable as a source of religious and social history of Sufi Muslims in India. The other major function of a khanqah was of a community shelter. Many of these facilities were built in low caste, rural, Hindu vicinities. The Chishti Order Sufis in India, especially, crystallized khanqahs with the highest form of modest hospitality and generosity.Schimmel 232 Keeping a \\"visitors welcome\\" policy, khanqahs in India offered spiritual guidance, psychological support, and counseling that was free and open to all people. The spiritually hungry and depressed caste members were both fed with a free kitchen service and provided basic education. By creating egalitarian communities within stratified caste systems, Sufis successfully spread their teachings of love, spirituality, and harmony. It was this example of Sufi brotherhood and equity that drew people to the religion of Islam. Soon these khanqahs became social, cultural, and theological epicenters for people of all ethnic and religious backgrounds and genders.Schimmel 231 Through a khanqah's services, Sufis presented a form of Islam that forged a way for voluntary large scale conversions of lower class Hindustanis.Aquil 16 Sufi Tariqahs=Madariyya The Madariyya are members of a Sufi order (tariqa) popular in North India, especially in Uttar Pradesh, the Mewat region, Bihar and Bengal, as well as in Nepal and Bangladesh. Known for its syncretic aspects, lack of emphasis on external religious practice and focus on internal dhikr, it was initiated by the Sufi saint 'Sayed Badiuddin Zinda Shah Madar' (d. 1434 CE), called \\"Qutb-ul-Madar\\", and is centered on his shrine (dargah) at Makanpur, Kanpur district, Uttar Pradesh. Qadiriyyah The Qadiriyyah order was founded by Abdul-Qadir Gilani who was originally from Iraq (d. 1166) It is popular among the Muslims of South Asia.Gladney, Dru. \\"Muslim Tombs and Ethnic Folklore: Charters for Hui Identity\\" Journal of Asian Studies, August 1987, Vol. 46 (3): 495-532; pp. 48-49 in the PDF file. Razzaqiah The Razzaqiah order was founded by Shaiykh Saiyed Razzaq Ali Gilani who was originally from Iran. (d. 1208) It is popular among the Muslims of North Asia. Shadhiliyya Madurai Maqbara, the tomb of Shadhili Sufi saints in Madurai, India. Shadhiliyya was founded by Imam Nooruddeen Abu Al Hasan Ali Ash Sadhili Razi. Fassiya branch of Shadhiliyya was flourished by Qutbul Ujood Imam Fassi at Masjid al Haram Makkah as its base and was brought to India by Sheikh Aboobakkar Miskeen sahib Radiyallah of Kayalpatnam and Sheikh Mir Ahmad Ibrahim Raziyallah of Madurai. Mir Ahmad Ibrahim is the first of the three Sufi saints revered at the Madurai Maqbara in Tamil Nadu. There are more than 70 branches of Shadhiliyya of these, the Fassiyatush Shadhiliyya is the most widely practised order. Chishtiyyah Nizamuddin Auliya's tomb (right) and Jama'at Khana Masjid (background), at Nizamuddin Dargah complex, in Nizamuddin West, Delhi The Chishtiyya order emerged from Central Asia and Persia. The first saint was Abu Ishaq Shami (d. 940‚Äì41) establishing the Chishti order in Chisht-i-Sharif within Afghanistan Furthermore, Chishtiyya took root with the notable saint Moinuddin Chishti (d. 1236) who championed the order within India, making it one of the largest orders in India today.Alvi 13 Scholars also mentioned that he had been a part-time disciple of Abu Najib Suhrawardi.Schimmel 346 Khwaja Moiuddin Chishti was originally from Sistan (eastern Iran, southwest Afghanistan) and grew up as a well traveled scholar to Central Asia, Middle East, and South Asia.Aquil 6 He reached Delhi in 1193 during the end of Ghurid reign, then shortly settled in Ajmer-Rajasthan when the Delhi Sultanate formed. Moinuddin Chishti's Sufi and social welfare activities dubbed Ajmer the \\"nucleus for the Islamization of central and southern India.\\" The Chishti order formed khanqah to reach the local communities, thus helping Islam spread with charity work. Islam in India grew with the efforts of dervishes, not with violent bloodshed or forced conversion. This is not to suggest that the Chishti order ever took a stand against the Ulema on questions of classical Islamic orthodoxy. Chishtis were famous for establishing khanqahs and for their simple teachings of humanity, peace, and generosity. This group drew an unprecedented amount of Hindus of lower and higher castes within the vicinity. Until this day, both Muslims and non-Muslims visit the famous tomb of Moinuddin Chishti; it has become even a popular tourist and pilgrimage destination.

The teachings of Ahmad Ghazali led to the formation of this order. This order was prominent in medieval Iran prior to Persian migrations into India during the Mongol Invasion Consequently, it was Abu Najib as-Suhrawardi's nephew that helped bring the Suhrawardiyyah to mainstream awareness.Zargar, Schimmel Abu Hafs Umar as-Suhrawardi (d. 1243) wrote numerous treatises on Sufi theories. Most notably, the text trans. \\"Gift of Deep Knowledge: Awa‚Äôrif al-Mar‚Äôif\\" was so widely read that it became a standard book of teaching in Indian madrasas. This helped spread the Sufi teachings of the Suhrawardiyya. Abu Hafs was a global ambassador of his time. From teaching in Baghdad to diplomacy between the Ayyubid rulers in Egypt and Syria, Abu Hafs was a politically involved Sufi leader. By keeping cordial relations with the Islamic empire, Abu Hafs's followers in India continued to approve of his leadership and approve political participation of Sufi orders. Kubrawiyyah This order was founded by Abu'l Jannab Ahmad, nicknamed Najmuddin Kubra (d. 1221) who was from the border between Uzbekistan and TurkmenistanSchimmel 254 This Sufi saint was a widely acclaimed teacher with travels to Turkey, Iran, and Kashmir. His education also fostering generations of students who became saints themselves. This order became important in Kashmir during the late 14th century.Schimmel 255 Kubra and his students made significant contributions to Sufi literature with mystical treatises, mystical psychology, and instructional literature such as text \\"al-Usul al-Ashara\\" and \\"Mirsad ul Ibad.\\"Schimmel 256, Zargar These popular texts regarding are still mystic favorites in India and in frequent study. The Kubrawiya remains in Kashmir - India and within Huayy populations in China. Naqshbandiyyah The origin of this order can be traced back to Khwaja Ya‚Äòqub Yusuf al-Hamadani (d. 1390), who lived in Central Asia. It was later organized by Baha‚Äôuddin Naqshband (b. 1318‚Äì1389) of Tajik and Turkic background. He is widely referred to as the founder of the Naqshbandi order. Khwaja Muhammad al-Baqi Billah Berang (d. 1603) introduced the Naqshbandiyyah to India. This order was particularly popular Mughal elites due to ancestral links to the founder, Khawja al- Hamadani Alvi 15 Babur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty in 1526, was already initiated in the Naqshbandi order prior to conquering India. This royal affiliation gave considerable impetus to the order. This order has been considered as most orthodox among all sufi orders. Mujaddadiya This order is a branch of Qadariya Naqshbandiya Order. It is belong to Shaykh Ahmad Mujaddad Alf Sani Sirhindi , who was a great wali Allah and Mujaddid ( Riviver) of 11th Hizri century and also called Riviver for 1000 year. He was born in Sirhind Punjab and his last resting place also in Sirhind Punjab.  Sarwari Qadri  The Sarwari Qadri order was founded by Sultan Bahu which branched out of the Qadiriyyah order. Hence, it follows the same approach of the order but unlike most Sufi orders, it does not follow a specific dress code, seclusion, or other lengthy exercises. Its mainstream philosophy is related directly to the heart and contemplating on the name of Allah, i.e., the word ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá (allƒÅh) as written on own heart.= Sufi Culture=Syncretic Mysticism Islam was not the only religion in India contributing the mystical aspects of Sufism. The Bhakti movement also gained respect due to popularity of mysticism spreading through India. The Bhakti movement was a regional revival of Hinduism linking language, geography, and cultural identities through devotional deity worship.Walsh 64 This concept of \\"Bhakti\\" appeared in the Bhagavad Gita and the first sects emerged from south India between the 7th and 10th century. The practices and theological standpoints were very similar to Sufism, often blurring the distinction between Hindus and Muslims. Bhakti devotees linked puja (Hinduism) to songs about saints and theories of life; they would meet often to sing and worship. The Brahman Bhaktis developed mystical philosophies similar to those advocated by Sufi saints. For example, the Bhaktis believed that there is a special reality beneath the illusion of life; this reality needs to be recognized to escape the cycle of reincarnation. Moreover, moksha, liberation from Earth is the ultimate goal in Hinduism.Walsh 66 These teachings run nearly parallel to Sufi concepts of dunya, tariqa, and akhirah. Sufism helped the assimilation of the Afghani Delhi Sultanate rulers within mainstream society. By building a syncretic medieval culture tolerant and appreciative of non-Muslims, Sufi saints contributed to a growth of stability, vernacular literature, and devotional music in India.Aquil 34 One Sufi mystic, Saiyid Muhammad Ghaus Gwaliori popularized yogic practices among Sufi circles.Aquil 35 Literature related to monotheism and the Bhakti movement also formed sycretic influences in history during the Sultanate period.Aquil 10 Despite the camaraderie between Sufi saints, yogis, and Bhakti Brahmans, medieval religious traditions existed and continue to splinter peaceful living in parts of India today. Rituals One of the most popular rituals in Sufism is the visiting of grave-tombs of Sufi saints. These have evolved into Sufi shrines and are seen among cultural and religious landscape of India. The ritual of visiting any place of significance is called ziyarat; the most common example is a visit to Prophet Muhammad's Masjid Nabawi and grave in Medina, Saudi Arabia.Schlemiel 238 A saint's tomb is a site of great veneration where blessings or baraka continue to reach the deceased holy person and are deemed (by some) to benefit visiting devotees and pilgrims. In order to show reverence to Sufi saints, kings and nobles provided large donations or waqf to preserve the tombs and renovate them architecturally.The Islamic Path: Sufism, Politics, and Society in India (2006) Over time, these donation, rituals, annual commemorations formed into an elaborate system of accepted norms. These forms of Sufi practise created an aura of spiritual and religious traditions around prescribed dates.The Islamic Path: Sufism, Politics, and Society in India. (2006) Many orthodox or Islamic purists denounce these visiting grave rituals, especially the expectation of receiving blessings from the venerated saints. Nevertheless, these rituals have survived generations and seem adamant to remain. Musical Influence Music has always been present as a rich tradition among all Indian religions.The Islamic Path: Sufism, Politics, and Society in India p.15 (2006) As an influential medium to disperse ideas, music has appealed to people for generations. The audience in India was already familiar with hymns in local languages. Thus Sufi devotional singing was instantly successful among the populations. Music transmitted Sufi ideals seamlessly. In Sufism, the term music is called \\"sa'ma\\" or literary audition. This is where poetry would be sung to instrumental music; this ritual would often put Sufis into spiritual ecstasy. The common depiction of whirling dervishes dressed in white cloaks come to picture when paired with \\"sa'ma.\\" Many Sufi traditions encouraged poetry and music as part of education. Sufism spread widely with their teachings packaged in popular songs accessing mass demographics. Women were especially affected; often used to sing Sufi songs during the day and in female gatherings. Sufi gatherings today are known as qawwali. One of the biggest contributors to the musical Sufi tradition was Amir Khusro (d. 1325). Known as a disciple of Nizamuddin Chishti, Amir was known as the most talented musical poet in the early Muslim period of India. He is considered the founder of Indo-Muslim devotional music traditions. Nicknamed \\"Parrot of India,\\" Amir Khusro furthered the Chishti affiliation through this rising Sufi pop culture within India. Impact of Sufism The massive geographic presence of Islam in India can be explained by the tireless activity of Sufi preachers.Schimmel 240 Sufism had left a prevailing impact on religious, cultural, and social life in South Asia.The mystical form of Islam was introduced by Sufi saints.The Cambridge history of Southeast Asia: From early times to c. 1800 By Nicholas TarlingPage 29publisher=Cambridge University Pressurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=rOw8AAAAIAAJ&pg;=PA29&dq;=Sufism+and+Its+Impact+on+Muslim+Society+in+South+Asia&client;=opera&cd;=9#v=onepage&q;=&f;=false Sufi scholars traveling from all over continental Asia were instrumental and influential in the social, economic, and philosophic development of India.Role of Sufis in Spreading IslamThe Islamic Path: Sufism, Politics, and Society in India (2006) p. xi Besides preaching in major cities and centers of intellectual thought, Sufis reached out to poor and marginalized rural communities and preached in local dialects such as Urdu, Sindhi, Punjabi versus Persian, Turkish, and Arabic. Sufism emerged as a \\"moral and comprehensive socio-religious force\\" that even influenced other religious traditions such as Hinduism.,Medieval Islamic Civilization: L-Z, index By Josef W. Meri, Jere L. Bacharachurl=pg=773 Their traditions of devotional practices and modest living attracted all people. Their teachings of humanity, love for God and Prophet continue to be surrounded by mystical tales and folk songs today. Sufis were firm in abstaining from religious and communal conflict and strived to be peaceful elements of civil society. Furthermore, it is the attitude of accommodation, adaptation, piety, and charisma that continues to help Sufism remain as a pillar of mystical Islam in India.

The city acquired and operated the wells starting in 1917 until the 1950s when the municipal water source was replaced. In 1955 the forest was to be logged and the land sold but strong local opposition resulted in an ordinance preserving the area as a city park. Throughout, remnants of the waterworks are visible from the park trails.  History  The park takes its name from the watershed of Moxlie Creek. Water wells for the city of Olympia were first created in the area now comprising Watershed Park in the late 19th century. Influential Western Washington businessman Henry Clay Heermans bought the entire waterworks in 1909, and sold it to the City of Olympia in 1917.Hunt, H. and Kaylor, F.C.

Skunk cabbage and salmon berries grow alongside Moxlie Creek, which weaves throughout the area. The creek is fed by groundwater and surface water runoff. Chinook, coho salmon and coastal cutthroat trout live in the creek. There are big leaf maple, douglas fir, red alder and incense cedar throughout the park, along with huckleberry, Oregon grape, licorice and sword ferns, and devil's club.

Calcutta, India: The Catholic Orphan Press, 1884. She established an endowment which paid an annual pension to twelve unmarried noble ladies, six of whom received 300 guilders and six of whom received 100 guilders. The pension ceased when a member married; if, however, the marriage was according to the rank of the member, then the lady was permitted to continue to wear the insignia of the order and be known as an Ehrendame (Lady of Honour). Various other ladies also held the rank of Ehrendame including all the princesses of the House of Wittelsbach. Bavarian ladies paid a reception fee of 55 guilders while foreign ladies paid 220 guilders. The insignia of the order is worn on the left breast and consists of a blue-enameled Maltese cross with a wide white edge, over which is placed a gold royal crown. In the four angles of the cross are lozenges with the blue- and-white arms of Bavaria. At the centre of the cross is a gold bordered white circular medallion decorated with the letter T. On the back of the medallion is the year 1827 and the motto of the order ‚ÄúUnser Leben sey Glaube an das Ewige‚Äù (Our life is Faith in Eternity).

Discovery It appears that a rubber tapper on an Indian raid in 1909 may have been the first non-native to encounter the petroglyphs, with the next visit having been made by a Dominican missionary, Vicente Cenitagoya, in 1921. A smattering of adventurers began to arrive at the site in the 1950s, and in 1969 the site was visited by the Peruvian physician/explorer Dr. Carlos Neuenschwander Landa (who would return in later years accompanied by Peruvian explorer, Sr. Santiago Y√°bar). In 1970 another peripatetic Dominican, Padre Adolfo Torrealba, reached the site, followed by Japanese explorer Yoshiharo Sekino, and the French-Peruvian explorers Herbert and Nicole Cartagena in 1978. Two years later came the Peruvian archaeologist Federico Kauffmann Doig. In 1991 the party of North American explorer Gregory Deyermenjian, including Peruvian explorer Paulino Mamani and the previously mentioned Santiago Y√°bar, arrived at Pusharo. The site has since been visited and studied by rock art scholar Rainer Hostnig. In 2008, it was the subject of a documentary-trek filmed for the BBC television series Extreme Dreams presented by Ben Fogle. Description The site is made up of an array of deeply incised rock carvings that cover up to a height of 9 feet, a perpendicular rock face that is over 100 feet long and 75 feet high. Its location is on the south shore of the R√≠o Palatoa (designated on some maps at this location as the Porotoa, and known by others as the Palatoa Chico). The petroglyphs are thought by some researchers to be purely pan-Amazonian in origin, and of mistico-religious or shamanic significance to those Amerindians of past centuries who must have been their creators. Others believe that there is an Incan component that is now coming to light, and that the glyphs constitute parts of a map. Definitive word on the meaning of Pusharo's glyphs must wait until further research is conducted and completed. The glyphs contain elements such as heart-shaped faces, some with double borders, spirals, zigzags, suns, \\"curlicue X's\\" and others that defy verbal description.

The change may be positive or negative, and depends on the situation. It is a significant threat to a research study's external validity and is typically controlled for using blind experiment designs. There are several forms of reactivity. The Hawthorne effect occurs when research study participants know they are being studied and alter their performance because of the attention they receive from the experimenters. The John Henry effect, a specific form of Hawthorne effect, occurs when the participants in the control group alter their behavior out of awareness that they are in the control group. Reactivity is not limited to changes in behaviour in relation to being merely observed; it can also refer to situations where individuals alter their behavior to conform to the expectations of the observer. An experimenter effect occurs when the experimenters subtly communicate their expectations to the participants, who alter their behavior to conform to these expectations. The Pygmalion effect occurs when students alter their behavior to meet teacher expectations. Both experimenter effects and Pygmalion effects can be caused by bias and stereotyping, as demonstrated by studies involving stereotype threat. Reactivity can also occur in response to self-report measures if the measure is elicited from research participants during a task. For example, both confidence ratings and judgments of learning, which are often provided repeatedly throughout cognitive assessments of learning and reasoning, have been found to be reactive. In addition there may be important individual differences in how participants react to a particular self-report measure. Espeland & Sauder (2007) took a reactivity lens to investigate how rankings of educational institutions change expectations and permeate institutions. These authors investigate the consequences, both intended and unintended, of such public measures.Espeland & Sauder (2007), http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/517897 A common solution to reactivity is unobtrusive research that can replace or augment reactive research. Unobtrusive research refers to methods in which the researchers are able to obtain information without interfering in the research itself. Results gathered from unobtrusive methods tend to have very high test-retest reliability.

Citizens may unite and offer to delegate a portion of their sovereign powers and duties to those who wish to serve as officers of the state, contingent on the officers agreeing to serve according to the will of the people. In the United States, the term has been used to express this concept in constitutional law. It was also used during the 19th century in reference to a proposed solution to the debate over the expansion of slavery. The proposal would have given the power to determine the legality of slavery to the inhabitants of the territory seeking statehood, rather than to Congress. History The concept of popular sovereignty (from which the consent of the governed derives its importance) did not originate in North America; its intellectual roots can be traced back to 17th- and 18th-century European political philosophy.On the English origins of the sovereignty of the people and consent as the basis of government, see John Phillip Reid, Constitutional History of the American Revolution (4 vols., University of Wisconsin Press, 1986‚Äì1993), Vol. III: 97‚Äì101, 107‚Äì10 ; Edmund S. Morgan, Inventing the People: The Rise of Popular Sovereignty in England and America (W.W. Norton and Company, 1988) The American contribution was the translation of these ideas into a formal structure of government. Before the American Revolution, there were few examples of a people creating their own government. Most had experienced government as an inheritance‚Äîas monarchies or other expressions of power.Gordon S. Wood, The Radicalism of the American Revolution (Alfred A. Knopf, 1991), at p. 243 (noting that during their Revolution, Americans \\"became the first society in the modern world to bring ordinary people into the affairs of government‚Äînot just as voters but as actual rulers\\"); Pauline Maier, American Scripture: Making the Declaration of Independence (Alfred A. Knopf, 1997), at pp. 34‚Äì35 (observing that in 1776 no governments existed \\"in which all authority rested on popular choice\\"). The American Revolution resulted in a government based on popular sovereignty, the first large-scale establishment of this concept (although it had been discussed and experimented in European contexts). The early Americans supported the contention that governments were legitimate only if they were based on popular sovereignty.Paul K. Conkin, Self-Evident Truths: Being a Discourse on the Origins & Development of the First Principles of American Government‚ÄîPopular Sovereignty, Natural Rights, and Balance & Separation of Powers, (Indiana Univ. Press, 1974), at p. 52 (describing \\"the almost unanimous acceptance of popular sovereignty at the level of abstract principle\\"); Edmund S. Morgan, \\"The Problem of Popular Sovereignty,\\" in Aspects of American Liberty: Philosophical, Historical and Political, (The American Philosophical Society, 1977), at p. 101 (concluding the American Revolution \\"confirmed and completed the subordination of government to the will of the people\\"); Willi Paul Adams, The First American Constitutions: Republican Ideology and the Making of the State Constitutions in the Revolutionary Era (University of North Carolina Press, 1980), at p. 137 (asserting that statements of the \\"principle\\" of the people's sovereignty \\"expressed the very heart of the consensus among the victors of 1776\\"). The concept unified and divided post-Revolutionary American thinking about government and the basis of the Union.This is the conclusion reached in Christian G. Fritz, American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War (Cambridge University Press, 2008) (In the prologue to this study, Fritz notes \\"In framing America's first constitutions, patriots celebrated the people's sovereignty. These ideas smoldered even after the Revolution ended and this heated revolutionary rhetoric soon permeated all regions and ranks of society. Government was no longer something that happened to people. In America it now became something the people‚Äîby their consent and volition‚Äîbrought into being. The people gave their consent through their conduct and their active participation reinforced the message that the people were America's new sovereign.\\" However, \\"Americans argued fiercely about the nature and the extent of their power as part of the collective sovereign, and seven decades later [after independence] they were no closer to agreement over what the people's sovereignty meant than they were during the Revolution.\\") Prologue, American Sovereigns, at p.l Questions were raised over its precise meaning, permissible actions and the will of a collective sovereign. In 18th-century European political thought, \\"the people\\" excluded most of the population; suffrage was denied to women, slaves, indentured servants, those lacking sufficient property, indigenous people and the young.Gary B. Nash, Gary B., Unknown American Revolution: The Unruly Birth of Democracy and the Struggle to Create America (Viking, 2005) (describing how the Revolution laid the groundwork for an expanding definition of who were deemed part of \\"the people.\\") The early American republic similarly disenfranchised women and those lacking sufficient property, also denying citizenship to slaves and other non-whites. According to historian Ronald Formisano, \\"Assertions of the peoples' sovereignty over time contained an unintended dynamic of raising popular expectations for a greater degree of popular participation and that the peoples' will be satisfied.\\"Ronald P. Formisano, For the People: American Populist Movements from the Revolution to the 1850s (Univ. of North Carolina Press, 2008), at p. 43. Regarding slavery In 1846, as the dispute over slavery in the United States developed in the wake of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, popular sovereignty became the foundation of a proposed resolution to slavery in the country. At the war's end, the United States acquired lands formerly held by Mexico. The effort to incorporate these lands into the United States uncovered long-simmering disputes about the extension of slavery ‚Äì whether it would be permitted, protected, abolished or perpetuated in the newly-acquired areas. Attempts to resolve the issue in Congress led to gridlock. Several Congressional leaders, in an effort to resolve the deadlock over slavery as a condition for admission or administration of the territories, searched for a middle ground.Michael A. Morrison, Slavery and the American West: The Eclipse of Manifest Destiny and the Coming of the Civil War, (University of North Carolina Press: 1997) at p. 78 (noting that congressional sexting over slavery in the territory acquired from Mexico had reached a \\"deadlock\\" and that Whig party was \\"unwilling to meet the problem head-on.\\") & at p. 84 (noting that in the face of \\"extreme solutions\\" to the slavery question in the territories, \\"moderates in both parties began to search for middle ground.\\") To some moderates, slavery in the territories was not a matter for Congress to resolve; they argued that the people in each territory, like those in each American state, were the sovereigns thereof and should determine the status of slavery.Compromise of 1850#Henry Clay and Douglas draft compromise Popular sovereignty became part of the rhetoric for leaving to residents of the new American territories the decision to accept or reject slavery; this would resolve the expansion of slavery in the United States. This formed a middle ground between proponents of a limitation on slavery's spread to the territories and those opposing limitations, tying into the widespread American assumption that the people were sovereign.Stephen A. Douglas And The American Union (Website: University of Chicago Library) (May 14, 2008) (\\"Popular sovereignty had the potential for great public appeal because it was closely tied to the ideal of majority rule and the principles of American constitutionalism. For [Senator Stephen A.] Douglas, it had even more important political implications. By removing slavery from congressional debate and transferring it to geographically remote territorial legislatures, Douglas hoped to insulate the federal Union from further sectional conflict.\\") According to historian Michael Morrison, the \\"idea of local self-determination, or, as it would become known, popular sovereignty\\" first began to occupy the attention of Congress in 1846 and 1847.Michael A. Morrison, Slavery and the American West: The Eclipse of Manifest Destiny and the Coming of the Civil War, at p. 84 (University of North Carolina Press: 1997) (noting that as a proposal for solving the question of slavery in the territories, \\"popular sovereignty endorsed the fundamental principle of self-government, [so that] its appeal was powerful. Of more immediate importance, Cass's [popular sovereignty] doctrine also held out the twin and seemingly paradoxical advantages of resolving the territorial issue and postponing its denouement. For although popular sovereignty proposed to remove this vexing question from Congress, Cass was as silent as the dumbest oracle on the precise stage of territorial development at which inhabitants were to regulate slavery.\\") In modern historiography, Illinois senator Stephen A. Douglas is most closely associated with popular sovereignty as a solution to the extension of slavery in the territories. Douglas's biographer, historian Robert W. Johannsen, wrote that Douglas was > chairman of the Committee on Territories in both the House and Senate, and > he discharged the responsibilities of his position with single-minded > devotion. ... During the debates over the organization of the Mexican > Cession, Douglas evolved his doctrine of popular sovereignty, and from that > time on it was irrevocably linked to his interest in the territories and in > the West. His commitment to popular sovereignty was the deeper because he > recognized in it a formula that would (he hoped) bridge the differences > between the North and South on the slavery question, thus preserving the > Union.Robert W. Johannsen, The Frontier, the Union and Stephen A. Douglas > (Univ. of Illinois Press: 1989) at pp. 95‚Äì96 The term \\"popular sovereignty\\" was not coined by Douglas; in connection with slavery in the territories, it was first used by presidential candidate and Michigan senator Lewis Cass in his 1847 Nicholson Letter.Michael A. Morrison, Slavery and the American West: The Eclipse of Manifest Destiny and the Coming of the Civil War, at p. 84 (University of North Carolina Press: 1997) (noting that \\"not until the presidential hopeful Lewis Cass made it his hobby was popular sovereignty put clearly before the people. As he delineated the doctrine in his 'Nicholson letter' of December 1847 [to Tennessee political supporter, A. O. P. Nicholson], Cass refused to take an explicit stand on Congress's power to regulate slavery in the territories. Rather, he contended that even if such power existed, it ought not be exercised. Congressional leadership, he argued, 'should be limited to the creation of popular governments and the necessary provision for their eventual admission into the Union; leaving in the meantime to the people inhabiting them to regulate their own internal concerns in their own way.); see also Willard Carl Klunder, Lewis Cass and the Politics of Moderation (Kent State University Press, 1996), at pp. 168‚Äì70, 177‚Äì80, 241‚Äì43. Today it is more closely associated with Douglas, and its connection to the failed attempt to accommodate slavery gave the term its present pejorative connotation. Douglas \\"ultimately became the victim of the very politics he sought to remove from territorial policy\\" by advancing the idea of popular sovereignty: \\"His efforts were not judged in terms of their impact on the needs and desires of the territories. ... Rather, they were appraised in terms of their relation to the power struggle between North and South and to the issue of slavery. Despite Douglas's intentions, the territories continued to be but pawns in a larger political controversy.\\"Robert W. Johannsen, The Frontier, the Union and Stephen A. Douglas (Univ. of Illinois Press: 1989) at pp. 116‚Äì17 In constitutional law The colonists' struggle for equality with the King of Great Britain was enshrined in the American Declaration of Independence and was common knowledge in the United States after the American Revolution. Inaugural Chief Justice John Jay, in Chisholm v. Georgia (1793), illustrate what would come to be known as popular sovereignty: > It will be sufficient to observe briefly that the sovereignties in Europe, > and particularly in England, exist on feudal principles. That system > considers the Prince as the sovereign, and the people as his subjects; it > regards his person as the object of allegiance, and excludes the idea of his > being on an equal footing with a subject, either in a court of justice or > elsewhere ... No such ideas obtain here; at the Revolution, the sovereignty > devolved on the people, and they are truly the sovereigns of the country, > but they are sovereigns without subjects, and have none to govern but > themselves[.] > From the differences existing between feudal sovereignties and governments > founded on compacts, it necessarily follows that their respective > prerogatives must differ. Sovereignty is the right to govern; a nation or > State sovereign is the person or persons in whom that resides. In Europe, > the sovereignty is generally ascribed to the Prince; here, it rests with the > people; there, the sovereign actually administers the government; here, > never in a single instance; our Governors are the agents of the people, and, > at most, stand in the same relation to their sovereign in which regents in > Europe stand to their sovereigns.2 U.S. 419 Chisholm v. Georgia, JAY Opinion > ‚Äì in part Although each person is sovereign, that sovereignty is twofold. In private matters, such as one's body, life and holdings, they are akin to the monarchs of Europe; one exception is eminent domain. They are co-sovereign with the states and the Union in public property and interests, and are governed by elected representatives.Constitution of the United States: Amendment IX. The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. Amendment X. The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. This concept of public and private may be confusing to those unfamiliar with the principles. Public and private are mutually exclusive; that which is public is not private and vice versa.Bouvier's Law Dictionary, 1856: PRIVATE. Not general, as a private act of the legislature; not in office; as, a private person, as well as an officer, may arrest a felon; individual, as your private interest; not public, as a private way, a private nuisance. That which is public is of interest to all the people, but this was never intended to express (or imply) that the private sector was subject to the state. Even in the public sector, the people as a whole remain sovereign. In 1886, 93 years after the Supreme Court's ruling in Chisholm v. Georgia, Justice Stanley Matthews expressed this in Yick Wo v. Hopkins: > When we consider the nature and the theory of our institutions of > government, the principles upon which they are supposed to rest, and review > the history of their development, we are constrained to conclude that they > do not mean to leave room for the play and action of purely personal and > arbitrary power. Sovereignty itself is, of course, not subject to law, for > it is the author and source of law; but, in our system, while sovereign > powers are delegated to the agencies of government, sovereignty itself > remains with the people, by whom and for whom all government exists and > acts. And the law is the definition and limitation of power. It is, indeed, > quite true that there must always be lodged somewhere, and in some person or > body, the authority of final decision, and in many cases of mere > administration, the responsibility is purely political, no appeal lying > except to the ultimate tribunal of the public judgment, exercised either in > the pressure of opinion or by means of the suffrage.

Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886) ‚Äì in part Legal historian Christian G. Fritz wrote in American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War that before and after the revolution, Americans believed \\"that the people in a republic, like a king in a monarchy, exercised plenary authority as the sovereign. This interpretation persisted from the revolutionary period up to the Civil War.\\"Christian G. Fritz, American Sovereigns: The People and America's Constitutional Tradition Before the Civil War (Cambridge University Press, 2008) at p. 7 Despite this widespread belief, the term \\"popular sovereignty\\" was infrequently used by the early Americans.See, e.g., Leonard Levy, ed., Encyclopedia of the American Constitution (Nathan Tarcov, \\"Popular Sovereignty (in Democratic Political Theory), vol 3, pp. 1426, 1428 (1986) (Noting of the doctrine of popular sovereignty before the Civil War that \\"the Founders tended not to call the doctrine expounded here as 'popular sovereignty.) In expressing the fundamental concept of rule by the people, they described an ideal of how the people would exercise sovereignty in the US and state officers and employees would be public servants.

It comprises the brain, spinal cord and the nerve fibers that branch off to all parts of the body. The Central Nervous System viral diseases are caused by viruses that attack the CNS. Existing and emerging viral CNS infections are major sources of human morbidity and mortality. Virus infections usually begin in the peripheral tissues, and can invade the mammalian system by spreading into the peripheral nervous system and more rarely the CNS. CNS is protected by effective immune responses and multi-layer barriers, but some viruses enter with high-efficiency through the bloodstream and some by directly infecting the nerves that innervate the tissues. Most viruses that enter can be opportunistic and accidental pathogens, but some like herpes viruses and rabies virus have evolved in time to enter the nervous system efficiently, by exploiting the neuronal cell biology. While acute viral diseases come on quickly, chronic viral conditions have long incubation periods inside the body. Their symptoms develop slowly and follow a progressive, fatal course. Types  *Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis *Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy *West Nile virus can produce aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and acute flaccid paralysis *Poliomyelitis *Herpes simplex encephalitis *Enteroviral disease *Most forms of aseptic meningitis are viral in origin, though neoplastic and lyme meningitis are also aseptic. *Eastern equine encephalitis *Western equine encephalitis *St. Louis encephalitis *Rabies *La crosse encephalitis *Progressive rubella panencephalitis, a late complication of rubella infection; most cases occur in those with congenital rubella syndrome *Varicella-zoster encephalitis *Acute Measles encephalitis *Mumps meningoencephalitis  Symptoms  Characteristics of a viral infection can include pain, swelling, redness, impaired function, fever, drowsiness, confusion and convulsions. Diagnosis=Classification *Acute - the most common diseases caused by acute viral infections are encephalitis, flaccid paralysis, aseptic meningitis, post infectious and encephalomyelitis. *Chronic - the most common diseases caused by chronic viral infections are subacute-sclerosing panencephalitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, retrovirus disease and spongiform encephalopathies.  Prevention  Prophylactic vaccination is available against poliomyelitis, measles, Japanese encephalitis, and rabies. Hyper immune immunoglobulin has been used for prophylaxis of measles, herpes zoster virus, HSV-2, vaccine, rabies, and some other infections in high-risk groups. Treatment  Treatments of proven efficacy are currently limited mostly to herpes viruses and human immunodeficiency virus. The herpes virus is of two types: herpes type 1 (HSV-1, or oral herpes) and herpes type 2 (HSV-2, or genital herpes). Although there is no particular cure; there are treatments that can relieve the symptoms. Drugs like Famvir, Zovirax, and Valtrex are among the drugs used, but these medications can only decrease pain and shorten the healing time. They can also decrease the total number of outbreaks in the surrounding. Warm baths also may relive the pain of genital herpes. Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection (HIV) is treated by using a combination of medications to fight against the HIV infection in the body. This is called antiretroviral therapy (ART). ART is not a cure, but it can control the virus so that a person can live a longer, healthier life and reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to others around him. ART involves taking a combination of HIV medicines (called an HIV regimen) every day, exactly as prescribed by the doctor. These HIV medicines prevent HIV Virus from multiplying (making copies of itself in the body), which reduces the amount of HIV in the body. Having less HIV in the body gives the immune system a chance to recover and fight off infections and cancers. Even though there is still some HIV in the body, the immune system is strong enough to fight off infections and cancers. By reducing the amount of HIV in the body, HIV medicines also reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to others. ART is recommended for all people with HIV, regardless of how long they've had the virus or how healthy they are. If left untreated, HIV will attack the immune system and eventually progress to AIDS.  New Therapies  Development of new therapies has been hindered by the lack of appropriate animal model systems for some important viruses and also because of the difficulty in conducting human clinical trials for diseases that are rare. Nonetheless, numerous innovative approaches to antiviral therapy are available including candidate thiazolide and purazinecarboxamide derivatives with potential broad-spectrum antiviral efficacy. New herpes virus drugs include viral helicase-primase and terminase inhibitors. A promising new area of research involves therapies based on enhanced understanding of host antiviral immune responses.  Epidemiology  Many viral infections of the central nervous system occur in seasonal peaks or as epidemics, whereas others, such as herpes simplex encephalitis, are sporadic. In endemic areas it is mostly a disease of children, but as the disease spreads to new regions, or nonimmune travelers visit endemic regions, nonimmune adults are also affected. eeee  Children  Meningitis is a very common in children. Newborns can develop herpes virus infections through contact with infected secretions in the birth canal. Other viral infections are acquired by breathing air contaminated with virus-containing droplets exhaled by an infected person. Arbovirus infections are acquired from bites by infected insects (called epidemic encephalitis). Viral central nervous system infections in newborns and infants usually begin with fever. The inability of infants to communicate directly makes it difficult to understand their symptoms. Newborns may have no other symptoms and may initially not otherwise appear ill. Infants older than a month or so typically become irritable and fussy and refuse to eat. Vomiting is common. Sometimes the soft spot on top of a newborn's head (fontanelle) bulges, indicating an increase in pressure on the brain. Because irritation of the meninges is worsened by movement, an infant with meningitis may cry more, rather than calm down, when picked up and rocked. Some infants develop a strange, high-pitched cry. Infants with encephalitis often have seizures or other abnormal movements. Infants with severe encephalitis may become lethargic and comatose and then die. To make the diagnosis of meningitis or the diagnosis of encephalitis, doctors do a spinal tap (lumbar puncture) to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for laboratory analysis in children.

It is the largest housing estate in the west of Ireland with 511 houses, it was built in five phases from the early seventies to 1985. There are 246 houses owned by the local authority, a further 213 houses in private ownership and 52 houses built by the housing agency, Cluid. Cranmore is made up of 15 blocks of houses or \\"drives\\" as they are known locally, including Cranmore Place, Cranmore Drive, Cranmore Villas, O'Dwyer Court, Devins Drive, Geldof Drive, McNeill Drive, Langan Drive, Racecourse View (originally Banks Drive), Carroll Drive, Benson Drive, Yeats Drive, Collery Drive, John Fallon Drive and Joe McDonnell Drive. The estate has two main access points with entrances from the Cranmore road to the north and Cleveragh road to the south, it also has walking entrances on Cranmore Place, Joe McDonnell Drive and Collery Drive. There has always been a small crime problem on the estate with car theft, muggings and breaking and entering the most common; this has led to the installation of 10 CCTV cameras funded by the rapid program located around the estate for crime prevention and there is often a Garda S√≠och√°na presence in the estate. The estate has had three unsolved brutal murders in recent times including two men gunned down and the third attacked with a hatchet. Houses on the estate have been subject to gun attacks and there have been numerous drug seizures by Garda√≠ throughout the area's history.  Population  With approximately 494 occupied houses and a population of between 1,600 and 1,700, Cranmore is as large as county Sligo's second and third largest towns, the estate having a larger population than both Ballymote (with 1,229) and Tubbercurry (with 1,171). It has been over 30 years since the first houses were completed and in that time it has become one of the largest estates west of the Shannon. These figures are based on the following: East Ward population (2006 Census): 5,334. Electorate [All those over the age of 18] of East Ward (2009 Register of Electors): 4,445 of which 941 are registered in Cranmore Estate.

There are also basketball and tennis courts, however these are in a dilapidated state. The area is next to the Mercy College which facilities include indoor basketball courts, running track and camogie pitch and Cranmore is located near the Sligo Racecourse and Sligo Sports Complex. The Community Sport Development Officer has worked closely with the Cranmore Regeneration Project and the Resource House Project to develop new sport and recreation programmes for young people in the area.  Community  Cranmore has a strong community with many clubs and projects. Cranmore Community Cooperative Society are the official voice for the Cranmore People in the regeneration process, they run many activities including a youth club as well as host various community education programmes and events. Other groups include Cranmore/Abbeyquarter Centre, City United Football club, ABQ Men's groups, two women's groups, a senior citizens club and 10 resident associations.

The goal of the operation was to eliminate the Ansar al-Islam terrorists as they had occupied parts of Kurdistan. Ansar al-Islam was established by former al-Qaeda members in 2001 as a Salafist Islamist movement that imposed a strict application of Sharia in villages it controlled. Background Ansar al-Islam was an Islamist terrorist organization which made its first appearance in Iraqi Kurdistan in December 2001. The group was made up of a combination of Kurdish recruits and Arab, and mostly Al Qaeda veterans of the war in Afghanistan. The group also had non-Kurdish/Arabic members.http://212.150.54.123/inter_ter/orgdet.cfm?orgid=96 From 2001 to 2003, they fought against Kurdish forces in northern Iraq, carving out an enclave around the town of Halabja which they placed under their control. The CIA also suspected Ansar al-Islam of manufacturing chemical weapons and the poison Ricin in a factory in the town of Sargat. In addition, at least two other militant Kurdish Islamic groups were operating in the region, and these generally aligned themselves with Ansar al-Islam. After Turkey had denied the U.S. 4th Infantry Division passage through their borders, the burden of carrying out the northern front of the war in Iraq fell on an ad hoc coalition of Americans to include CIA Special Activities Division (SAD) paramilitary operations officers, Special Forces soldiers from 10th SFG, U.S. Army 10th Mountain Division 2nd Battalion 14th Infantry Regiment and airborne units that parachuted into northern Iraq (however, the 173rd did not take part in Operation Viking Hammer), and Kurdish Peshmerga forces of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and Kurdish Democratic Party. The American forces were designated the Northern Iraq Liaison Element. Before beginning the attack south, the coalition forces first needed to destroy Ansar al-Islam's enclave in order to secure the Kurdish rear areas and free Kurdish forces to take part in the advance southwards.Woodward, Bob (2004). Plan of Attack. Simon & Schuster, Inc. Battle Ansar al-Islam fighters held a series of mountaintop positions that offered their men a commanding view of the surrounding areas, but also left them vulnerable to airstrikes. Cruise missile strikes against Ansar al-Islam camp and surrounding positions were launched in the early hours of March 21, a total of 64 Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired as a preparatory barrage.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p. 98-100 The Americans originally planned to launch a ground attack immediately following the airstrikes, but most American forces were not in place. Once more American troops arrived, the date of the attack was set for March 28. The plan called for four lines of advance for the Kurdish forces, with each force accompanied by U.S. Special Forces and CIA paramilitary officers. On the eve of the battle, the Islamic Group of Kurdistan, which had been allied with Ansar al- Islam, surrendered after having suffered 100 men killed in the March 21 strikes. The ground attack consisted of a six-pronged advance, with each prong was composed of several ODAs from 3rd battalion, 10th SFG and upwards of 1,000 Kurdish fighters.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p. 100 The attack from the south on the morning of the 28th was met with heavy fire from the Ansar defenders. Airstrikes were called in and the defenders routed. The Kurds and U.S. advisors pursued them and captured the town of Gulp hours ahead of schedule. The majority of the Ansar fighters retreated to the town of Sargat where they made their final stand.Masters of Chaos, Chapter 13 p. 17-18 Advancing on Sargat, the Kurds and Americans were pinned down for three hours by mortar and machine gunfire. Unable to call in airstrikes or contact friendly forces due to the deep valley blocking radio signals, the Special Forces soldiers used a Barrett M82 .50 caliber sniper rifle to take out Ansar al-Islam machine gun crews while the Kurds brought up artillery. The combination of artillery support and accurate long-range sniper fire drove the Ansar al-Islam forces from the town. Pursuing Ansar fighters into the hills, American and Kurdish forces were again pinned down by machine-gun fire and had to call in more airstrikes before darkness put an end to the day's fighting.Masters of Chaos, Chapter 13 p. 19-24 During the night, four AC-130 gunships maintained the pressure on the retreating Ansar al-Islam terrorists as they pulled back toward the Iranian border.Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 , p. 101 The next day, the Americans and Kurds pursued the Ansar al-Islam forces further into the mountains, towards the Iranian border. Many fighters attempted to flee across the border, only to be arrested by the Iranians. Many were sent back across the border and were later captured by Kurdish forces. However, Kurdish sources allege that many Ansar al-Islam fighters were in fact harbored by Iran. Aftermath Peshmerga, CIA, Special ForcesOperation Viking Hammer had eliminated Ansar al-Islam's presence in northern Iraq, and allowed Kurdish units to join the fight against Iraqi troops in northern Iraq. American intelligence personnel inspected the suspected chemical weapons site in Sargat and discovered traces of Ricin in the ruins, as well as potassium chloride. They also discovered chemical weapons suits, atropine nerve gas antidotes, and manuals on manufacturing chemical weapons, lending credence to the idea that the site was related to the manufacture of chemical weapons and poisons.Masters of Chaos, Chapter 13 p. 25-26 http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3070394/ns/world_news/t/positive-test-terror-toxins- iraq/#.X0QmwC2z1QI In a 2004 US News and World Report article, \\"A firefight in the mountains\\", the author states: :\\"Viking Hammer would go down in the annals of Special Forces history‚Äîa battle fought on foot, under sustained fire from an enemy lodged in the mountains, and with minimal artillery and air support.\\"\\"A firefight in the mountains: Operation Viking Hammer was one for the record books ‚Äì US News and World Report\\".

In April 2019, US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Mick Mulroy praised the role of Kurdish forces in ‚ÄúOperation Viking Hammer,‚Äù carried out by the Peshmerga and a small group of special US forces in the earliest stages of the 2003 Iraq war. Once that was accomplished, the Peshmerga became the ‚Äúnorthern front against Saddam,‚Äù without fearing an attack from their rear by the terrorist group.http://www.kurdistan24.net/en/news/ccbc37f1-3955-4a19-a72d-a7c210a6a036 Ansar al-Islam would later re-emerge as a group involved in the Iraqi insurgency, but significantly depleted in strength due to this battle.

The longest-running professional theatre company in Portland, since 1982 the company has focused on presenting the works of contemporary playwrights, including world premieres. In addition to producing six to eight productions in Portland annually, the company runs special programming and collaborations. They tour productions nationally with the support and collaboration of partnering theatre companies and the National Endowment for the Arts. Operating on a repertory or stock company model, their artistic agenda includes the ArtsHub campus collective and TableRoomStage initiative for new work. History=1982‚Äì1990 Chenoa Egawa portrays one of the ghost narrators in The Ghosts of Celilo Rebecca Adams (as producing director), Peter Waldron (as designer), Joe Cronin, Amy Fowkes, David Gomes and Vana O'Brien formed Artists Repertory Theatre in 1982; their goal was to present contemporary playwrights' work in an intimate space. Through the early years of the theatre, they used the local YWCA's 110‚Äìseat Wilson Center for the Performing Arts as their performance area. In 1988, Artists Rep appointed Allen Nause to the position of artistic director; he would go on to hold the position for over 20 years. 1990‚Äì1999 Artists Rep creates an improvisation and role-playing program to teach life-skills named ART Reach (later renamed Actors to Go) in 1990. In 1991, Artists Rep began a development program, focused on creating new plays; and in its first year Artists Rep earned an Oregon Book Nomination for their world premiere production of Nancy Klementowski's After the Light Goes. In 1995 they began a campaign to raise money for a new facility. After 2 years, Artists Rep was able to raise $1.2 million; with this money they moved into the Alder St. space, which included a 172‚Äìseat black box theater, administrative offices, a green room and dressing rooms, set‚Äìbuilding shop, wardrobe room and rehearsal hall. In 1997, they were able to expand their presence in the world with an Artists Rep production at an international human rights play festival held on a tour of Pakistan. 2000‚Äì2009 To begin the new millennia, in 2000 Artists Rep chose to participate in the first-ever-reciprocal artistic collaboration between the United States and Vietnam, the Vietnam America Theatre Exchange. To accommodate demand, Artists Rep started a second Ssage season in 2002; these productions would take place at an off-site location as the Alder St. space was too small. In 2004 they were one of only six companies nationally to be selected to the largest-ever tour of Shakespeare in U.S. history. This would be a continuation of their previous US/Vietnam collaboration, but extended to a tour of the seven Western states through the National Endowment for the Arts'\\"Shakespeare in American Communities\\" initiative. Later that year, Artists Rep began the expansion of their theatre space with the purchase of a 29,000 sq.ft. area of an entire city block for $4.8 million. The next year, 2005, Artists Rep opened an on-site location, the Morrison Stage, for their second stage productions; it would feature a more intimate setting with 164 seats. In 2008, Michael Mendelson, Vana O'Brien, Amaya Villazan and Todd Van Voris would become Artists Rep's first Resident Acting Company, and they all still remain members to this day. After opening the Morrison Stage in 2005, Artists Rep planned in 2009 to connect the two theatres with the construction of a staircase and the expansion of the Alder St. Stage's lobby. 2010‚Äì Artists Rep kicked off its 2010/11 season with a co-production of Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey Into Night with the Sydney Theatre Company. The cast included Academy-Award winning actor William Hurt, Australian star of stage and screen Robyn Nevin, Artists Rep Company Member Todd Van Voris, and Sydney Theatre Company Members Luke Mullins and Emily Russell. In 2012, Artists Rep celebrated its thirtieth anniversary season. Allen Nause, the theatre's artistic director for twenty-five years announced his retirement, to be succeeded and D√°maso Rodr√≠guez. The following season, Rodr√≠guez expanded Artists Rep's resident artists to include not only actors but also directors, designers, playwrights, and small experimental ensembles. Artists Rep became an arts campus, housing initially eight arts organizations within its red walls, including the August Wilson Red Door Project, Portland Revels, Profile Theatre, Portland Area Theatre Alliance, and the Portland Shakespeare Project. While the Traveling Lantern Theatre Company and Polaris Dance Theatre are no longer members of the ArtsHub, as of 2019, Hand2Mouth Theatre, the LineStorm Playwrights collective, Portland Actors Conservatory, and the Fertile Ground Festival for new work are facilitated by the venue. This ArtsHub initiative won the 2016 Light A Fire Award for inspiring creativity. Rodr√≠guez has implemented a series of new initiatives to support theatre-makers from varied backgrounds and facilitate new work in addition to the ArtsHub. After the appointment of Luan Schooler as Director of New Play Development and Dramaturgy, the pair initiated TableRoomStage (TRS) that facilitates new work at a variety of stages‚Äìfrom refining pre-existing work to commissions new work and staging world premiers. A pilot program begun in 2014, notable successes have included Andrea Stolowitz's Oregon Book Award-winning Ithaka, about returning women combat veterans, and E.M. Lewis's Magellanica, a six- hour epic about scientists studying climate change in Antarctica that was recognized with an Edgerton Award from TCG. Also in 2014, in the wake of a $500,000 gift, Rodr√≠guez dramatically increased the resident company to 20 members. 2018 saw a dramatic series of material changes at the theatre. In 2018, the company was hard-pressed to pay-off and IRS lien filed for lapses in its payroll tax filings going back to 2012 (paid off in early December). Property taxes and the expensive mortgage typical of Pacific Northwest urban centers remained the issue, so the company decided to sell half of its 2004 block-fixed, 29,000 square-foot property to an Atlanta-based developer. The buyer, Wood Partners, plans to build twenty-story mixed-use building with 296 housing units, 4,000 square feet of retail, and 206 below-grade parking spaces. Shortly thereafter, the company received an unrestricted $7 million gift from an anonymous donor. Coming in at twice the theatre‚Äôs annual operating budget, the gift was the largest donation in the company‚Äôs history, and one of the largest gifts that has ever made to an arts institution in Oregon to date. While still maintaining the sale of half their headquarter property, Artist Director Rodriguez who was then also the interim Managing Director decided to use the funds to pay off the remaining mortgage and over half a million dollars in overdue bills to vendors, a line of credit and credit card bills. The remaining funds have been set aside in an operating cash reserve, a backfill a fund for specific programs, and $1.6 million for substantial renovations to the remaining portion of the building. The substantial gift was seen by the range of artists and companies who depend on the space as a city-changing act of generosity. Amidst the changes, ART was also able to hire J.S. (John Stuart) May as the new managing director in the wake of Sarah Horton's departure. By mid-2019, architectural plans were released by May for the new two-theater complex with room for the ArtsHub companies, as well as a $10 million capital campaign. The company's 2019‚Äì20 season will be \\"On Tour\\", renting spaces across the city with Imago Theatre, Portland Opera, the Tiffany Center, Portland Center Stage, and Portland State University to put up the skeleton six-show season. Ensemble ART has operated on a repertory company model since 2008, meaning that they employ a dedicated stable of actors, playwrights, and other theatre-makers throughout a season rather than casting anew for each individual production. The company varies in size over time, sometimes as large as twenty-seven members. The resident artists contribute to programming decisions, education and community engagement, and develop new work for the theatre.

A man is suspected of murder, and due to the lingering effects of a brain injury sustained in an earlier accident, and after intensive police investigation, he begins to doubt whether he is innocent. Plot When a bus crashes due to faulty steering, passenger Jim Ackland (John Mills) sustains a serious brain injury and a young girl under his care is killed. Guilt-ridden, he attempts suicide twice during his recovery. He starts a new job as an industrial chemist and gets a room in a hotel. When he reluctantly accepts an invitation for a night out, he meets Jenny Carden (Joan Greenwood), the sister of his colleague, Harry (Patrick Holt). They begin seeing each other quite regularly. Things reach the point where he confesses he wants to marry her, but he tells her he wants to be sure he has fully recovered first. Molly Newman (Kay Walsh), one of the other hotel residents, asks to borrow ¬£30 from him, a rather substantial sum. As he doesn't have that much on him, Jim agrees to write her a cheque. She is found strangled the next night. Wilcox (Jack Melford), a married businessman Molly had been seeing, has an alibi. Jim admits to have been walking in the vicinity of the murder site; that plus the recovered cheque from the crime scene and his head injury make him the prime suspect. Police Inspector Godby (Frederick Piper) suspects he was another of Molly's boyfriends and that, after falling in love with Jenny, he wanted to rid himself of a possible blackmailer. When Jim learns that Mr Peachy, the person who lived in the room directly below Molly's, had falsely told the police that Jim was in her room every night, Jim confronts him in his room. Peachy brazenly admits killing Molly, confident that there is no evidence against him. He had regularly given her money; when Jim made her a loan, it had given rise to Peachy‚Äôs insane jealousy, with fatal results. Jim goes to the police, but they don‚Äôt believe him. When they come to take him into custody, Jim flees. He follows Peachy to Paddington Station, then discovers from a tag on the man‚Äôs luggage that he intends to flee the country by plane. He phones Godby with the flight information, but, when that appears to have no effect, contemplates suicide again. Then a letter Molly had posted to Wilcox just before her death is found. It incriminates Peachy, who is arrested. Jenny finds Jim and gives him the good news.

Following the trials, Howard resigned from his post in the United States Department of Justice, but he retained his position as head of the Republican Party in Mississippi and member of the National Committee.McMillen, Dark Journey, p. 68. He continued to have a successful career as partner and head of the top black law firm in Washington, DC. Biography Howard was born in Ebenezer in Holmes County in central Mississippi on June 14, 1877, as the first son of Sallie (1842-?) and Perry Wilbon Howard (1835-1907), who were enslaved before the Civil War. Highly respected in the community, they bought their own farm land and sent all their seven sons to college. Howard also had a sister Sarah, who later followed him to Washington, DC, as did at least one of his brothers. He was described as mulatto, meaning mixed race with partial European ancestry, as were many African Americans.McMillen (1990), Dark Journey, p. 20. Howard graduated from the historically black Rust College in Holly Springs, Mississippi and then studied mathematics at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. He studied law at Illinois College of Law in Chicago. By 1905, Howard had passed the bar, become a member of the Mississippi Bar Association, and was practicing law in the state capital of Jackson. He was among not more than two dozen black lawyers in Mississippi, the second generation of these professional men. He married in Jackson and had a son, Perry Wilbon Howard, III (1912‚Äì1967). Howard III was working as a bondsman in Washington, DC at the time of his death. Howard became active in Republican Party politics despite the constraints of Mississippi life; most blacks in the state had been disenfranchised in 1890 when the white Democrats passed a new constitution with provisions that created barriers to voter registration, such as poll taxes and a literacy test. Howard served as a delegate to every Republican national convention from 1912 to 1960, the year before his death. He was chosen by Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 to second his nomination as presidential candidate. Like other aspiring lawyers, Howard left Mississippi for better opportunities, moving to Washington, D.C. He became a partner in the top black law firm in Washington, Howard, Hayes and Davis (later Cobb, Hayes and Howard). Howard defeated white Republicans to be elected as National Committeeman from Mississippi in 1924, becoming the first black on the Republican National Committee in 25 years. In Mississippi, under white supremacy and the one-party Democratic rule enforced by black disenfranchisement, Republican party members could do little more than manage patronage, the assignment of federal appointed offices in Mississippi. In 1924 Howard was also appointed by President Warren G. Harding as a special assistant to the US Attorney General, becoming the highest-paid black in the government and Harding's first black appointment. Although Howard lived and worked in Washington, DC for the rest of his life, he retained his office as Republican National Committeeman of Mississippi and control of its patronage appointments in the state. In other southern states, conservative whites began to take over the Republican Party beginning in the mid-20th century after passage of national civil rights legislation. In 1928, Howard was indicted by a federal grand jury in Mississippi on corruption charges related to purported sale of offices in Mississippi. The grand jury would have been made up of white Democrats, his political opponents; blacks had been largely disenfranchised since 1890 and, excluded as voters, were not allowed to serve on juries. Howard and other black Republican officials were tried in federal court in Jackson. Howard said his \\"lily white\\" opponents in the Republican Party, which had fierce internal conflicts and no electoral power, were trying to destroy him as a black leader. Coming after years of investigation and the Harding scandals, the Howard case attracted coverage from such national newspapers as the New York Times. Howard was suspended from his position in the Department of Justice under President Calvin Coolidge before the first trial. Herbert Hoover, who had been elected as president during the machinations of investigation and indictment, was considered interested in cleaning up corruption but also in appealing to southern whites. Many people believed that he allowed the prosecution of Howard in order to attract whites to the Republican Party, as many appealed to him to reduce the black influence. The \\"specter of white Republicanism\\" so alarmed the Democrats, because it would threaten their political dominance of the state, that Democratic figures such as Governor Theodore Gilmore Bilbo and Colonel Frederick Sullens, editor of the Jackson Daily News, spoke out in Howard's defense. Howard was twice acquitted on patronage corruption charges by all- white juries in Jackson and Meridian. In the first trial, the defense noted that Howard had given more than 90% of the patronage jobs at his command to Democrats. During the trials and before jury selection was complete, Sullens published stories about the threat of a white Republican party to the Democrats. The Department of Justice decided not to try another case. Howard resigned from the government but returned to Washington, DC, where he was influential in the Republican Party. President Hoover, however, recognized only his \\"lily-white rival\\", Lamont Rowlands of the Mississippi Republican party, during the rest of his term. Despite opposition within Mississippi and criticism from national black leaders, Howard was pragmatic about dealing with local conditions. He held on to his position until 1960 as Republican National Committeeman from Mississippi, while working and living in the capital. He led U.S. Senator Robert A. Taft's Southern delegation at the 1952 Republican National Convention in Chicago.Rothbard, Murray. \\"Swan Song of the Old Right\\", Mises Institute Taft, however, lost the party nomination to Dwight D. Eisenhower. In 1956, the Howard forces (long called the \\"Blacks and Tans\\" for their biracial character) began to be challenged anew for control of the Mississippi state party by a white conservative faction led by Wirt Yerger, an insurance agent in Jackson. In addition to the Yerger and Howard factions, two smaller groups contended for intra-party power. The Lily-White Movement was led by George L. Sheldon, a former governor of Nebraska who had run for governor of Mississippi in 1947, polling 2.5 percent of the vote. The conservative \\"Democrats for Eisenhower\\" were organized under E. O. Spencer. Some media incorrectly identified Yerger as the head of the \\"Lily Whites\\", rather than the leader of a new group of conservative businessmen and lawyers, many of whom had earlier been in the Young Republicans organization. Yerger is considered the \\"founding father\\" of the state GOP. But it was decades before the Republican Party gathered strength among whites and acquired majority status among white registered voters in Mississippi. Howard managed to survive political swings and continued to serve as the Republican National Committeeman almost until his death. He died on February 1, 1961. His namesake son survived him. Mary Booze of Mound Bayou, an all-black community in Bolivar County in northwestern Mississippi, served alongside Howard as the national Republican committeewoman from 1924 to 1948. She was the first African- American female to sit on the RNC.

Source: Bulgarian Archives State Agency Joseph Sokolsky (, Gabrovo, Ottoman Empire 1786 ‚Äì died in Kiev, Russian Empire September 30, 1879) was the first senior Eastern Orthodox Bulgarian clergyman to convert to Catholicism, thus becoming a pioneer of the Bulgarian Byzantine Catholic Church. Sokolsky negotiated with Vatican a formal union due to Phanariotes domination over Bulgarian Orthodoxy and gained Catholic recognition in 1861 when Pope Pius IX named him Archbishop for the Bulgarians of the Byzantine Rite. He was also accepted in that capacity by the Ottoman Empire.Catholic Hierarchy: Archbishop Josif Sokolski Biography Sokolsky was born as Todor Petrovich around 1786 in an Eastern Orthodox family in the village of Nova Mahala, today quarter of Gabrovo. Around 1802 he became a novice in the Troyan Monastery, where he took religious vows in 1806. In the 1820s he visited Mount Athos, where he brought the collection of works containing the life of Gabrovo's Bulgarian Saint Onuphrius. On May 1, 1826 he became abbot of Kalofer Monastery. In 1832, Archimandrite Joseph Sokolsky left the Troyan Monastery and founded a monastery at a place called Falcon near the village Etar (now part of the city of Gabrovo). New monastery became known as \\"Sokolsky\\". In the 1840s in the same area Sokolsky created a \\"Joseph Convent\\". In 1836, Joseph Sokolsky also opened a school for boys. At one time in this school taught famous Bulgarian educator Neophyte Bozveli. For his achievements as an Orthodox Archimandrite, Sokolsky was much revered among Orthodox Bulgarians. In 1860 the Bulgarian national leaders and clergy campaigned for autonomy of Bulgarian Orthodox Church within the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, but without much success. At the same time, among the Bulgarians in Istanbul, an alternative solutions were proposed, in form of union with Catholic Church. Chief advocates of such notions were Dragan Tsankov and Georgi Mirkovich. At first, Joseph Sokolsky was a strong supporter of the movement for autonomy of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church within the Patriarchate of Constantinople, and was disappointed with Greek disrespect of Bulgarian claims. Soon, his countryman Nicolas Sapunov attracted him to the idea of a union with the Catholic Church. In November 1860, Joseph Sokolsky moved to Constantinople, and on December 30, 1860 he became a member of the Bulgarian delegation, sent to Pope Pius IX with the request to establish a hierarchy of the Bulgarian Greek Catholic Church. In March 1861 he went to Italy, together with deacon Raphael Popov, Dragan Tsankov and Georgi Mirkovich . Upon arrival to Rome, the delegation was received in Rome by the Pope himself. In April 1861 in the Sistine Chapel, Joseph Sokolsky was consecrated Archbishop, and appointed apostolic vicar for the Catholic Bulgarians of the Byzantine Rite. upon his return to Istanbul, he was accepted in that capacity by the authorities of Ottoman Empire. At that point, it seemed that the newly created Bulgarian Bzyantine-Catholic Church would start to develop successfully.Catholic Hierarchy: Diocese of Bulgarian United Church Those events drew attention of Russian officials in Istanbul, who feared that a union movement would have substantial influence on Bulgarians. Because of that, a plan was developed to detach Joseph Sokolsky from his community. The plan was devised by the Russian envoy, Prince Lobanov-Rostovsky, and was carried out by Petko Slaveikov who lured Sokolsky onto the Russian ship \\"Elbrus\\" that sailed from Istanbul for Odessa in June 1861. After arriving in Odessa, Joseph Sokolsky was taken by the Imperial Russian authorities to Kiev where he stayed for sometime in the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra. Later Sokolsky was exiled to a specifically built place for him near Holosiievo Forest (southern outskirts of Kiev, near modern Holosiivskyi National Nature Park) belonging to the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, where he lived until his death. The Russian government allowed for him to build own vineyard and a small garden. Sokolsky was assisted by another Bulgarian who already lived in Kiev for quite sometime. After the Polish uprising of 1863, in the Greek Catholic Diocese of Chelm almost all Greek Catholic priests were suspended or expelled. With the permission of the Emperor Alexander II, in 1873-74 Joseph Sokolsky visited that region several times, and a total of 72 Greek Catholic priest were ordained.

The plot of the film was inspired by the real-life story of David Hampton, a con man and robber who convinced a number of people in the 1980s that he was the son of actor Sidney Poitier. The writer John Guare was a friend of Inger McCabe Elliott and her husband Osborn Elliott. In October 1983, Hampton came to the Elliotts' New York apartment and they allowed him to spend the night. The next morning, Inger found Hampton in bed with another man and later called the police. The Elliotts told Guare about the story and it inspired him to write the play years later.New York Mag The Story of David Hampton accessed 7-27-2015 Plot Fifth Avenue socialite Ouisa Kittredge (Stockard Channing) and her art dealer husband Flan (Donald Sutherland) are parents of \\"two at Harvard and a girl at Groton\\". However, the narrow world inhabited by the Kittredges and their public status as people interested in the arts make them easy prey for Paul (Will Smith). A skillful con-artist, Paul mysteriously appears at their door one night, injured and bleeding, claiming to be a close college friend of their Ivy League kids, as well as the son of Sidney Poitier. Ouisa and Flan are much impressed by Paul's fine taste, keen wit, articulate literary expositions and surprising culinary skill. His appealing facade soon has the Kittredges putting him up, lending him money and taking satisfaction in his praise for their posh lifestyle. Paul's scheme continues until, after he brings home a hustler, his actual indigence is revealed. The shocked Kittredges kick him out when it is revealed that they are but the most recent victims of the duplicity with which Paul has charmed his way into many upper- crust homes along the Upper East Side. Paul's schemes become highbrow-legend, anecdotal onaccounta, which are bantered about at their cocktail parties. In the end, Paul has a profound effect on the many individuals who encounter him, linking them in their shared experience.

It is about Morgan's quest for knowledge of her family's past and the fact that she has grown up under false pretences. The book is a milestone in Aboriginal literature and is one of the earlier works in indigenous writing.  Synopsis  Sally Morgan's My Place is a story of a young Aboriginal girl growing up to false heritage and not knowing where she is from. Recounts of several of Morgan's family members are told. The story setting revolves around Morgan's own hometown, Perth, Western Australia, and also Corunna Downs Station, managed by Alfred Howden Drake-Brockman. Morgan has four siblings, two brothers and two sisters. She faces many challenges, such as fitting in at school, getting good marks for acceptance in University, and living life without her father. The book has been published in several parts 'for young readers' in the following parts: > Sally's story (Fremantle: Fremantle Arts Centre Press, 1990.) edited by > Barbara Ker Wilson ('My Place' for young readers, part 1'.

Here is a brief excerpt from Huggins' essay: > \\"It cannot be denied that among those who have read My Place are (usually > patronising) whites who believe that they are no longer racist because they > have read it. It makes Aboriginality intelligible to non-Aboriginals, > although there are different forms of Aboriginality which need to be > considered also; otherwise these remain exclusionary and the danger is that > only one ‚Äòworld view‚Äô is espoused. > \\"Precisely what irks me about My Place is its proposition that Aboriginality > can be understood by all non-Aboriginals.

These marks occur in about 10% of all births, and usually appear between one and four weeks after birth. It may grow rapidly, before stopping and slowly fading. Some are gone by the age of 2, about 60% by 5 years, and 90‚Äì95% by 9 years. Capillary hemangioma is a vascular anomaly. Capillary hemangiomas occur 5 times more often in female infants than in males, and mostly in Caucasian populations. Additionally, low birthweight infants have a 26% chance of developing a hemangioma. It is the most common tumor of orbit and periorbital areas in childhood. It may occur in the skin, subcutaneous tissues and mucous membranes of oral cavities and lips as well as in the liver, spleen and kidneys. While this birthmark may be alarming in appearance, physicians generally counsel that it be left to disappear on its own, unless it is in the way of vision or blocking the nostrils. Diagnosis Strawberry naevus, H&E; stain Liver Capillary haemangiomas in the liver are found in 16% of all liver haemangiomas. Its sizes are usually less than 1 to 2 cm in diameter. It may show a \\"flash- filling\\" phenomenon in which there is the fast enhancement of the contrast material in the lesion instead of slow, centripetal, nodular filling of the lesions in usual haemangiomas.

He entered a Ph.D. program at the University of Rochester but withdrew from graduate school in the middle of the semester after he received his M.A. in History in 1969.University of Rochester One Hundred and Nineteenth Annual Commencement Ceremonies, pg. 31, http://www.lib.rochester.edu/IN/RBSCP/University- History/ATTACHMENTS/Commencement/1969.pdf He then coached high school and college football, and his first published article appeared in a professional journal for coaches, Scholastic Coach. In the 1970s he began freelancing for magazines and moved to Washington DC, where he frequently contributed to The Washington Post Sunday Magazine and was Washington editor of the now-defunct Dun's Review and Dun's Business Month. Literary works His first book, The Ambition and the Power: A True Story of Washington, appeared in 1989 and explored the operation of the U.S. Congress, the use of power by Speaker of the House Jim Wright, and the rise of future Speaker Newt Gingrich. In 1995 the New York Times named it one of the eleven best books ever written on Congress and Washington. With Steven Rosenberg, MD, PhD, chief of the Surgery Branch at the National Cancer Institute and a pioneer in the development of \\"immunotherapy\\" for cancer‚Äîstimulating the immune system to attack cancer‚ÄîBarry co-authored his second book, The Transformed Cell: Unlocking the Mysteries of Cancer, which was published in 12 languages. Barry's 1997 book Rising Tide: The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and How It Changed America appeared on the New York Times Best Seller list and won the 1998 Francis Parkman Prize from the Society of American Historians for the year's best book on American history. In 2005, the New York Public Library named it one of the fifty best books of all kinds‚Äîfiction, nonfiction, and poetry‚Äîin the preceding 50 years. His work on water-related issues was recognized by the U.S. National Academies of Science in its invitation to give the 2006 Abel Wolman Distinguished Lecture on Water Resources; he is the only non-scientist ever to give that lecture. His 2004 book The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Greatest Plague in History was also a New York Times Best Seller, and won the 2005 Keck Communication Award from the United States National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine for the year's outstanding book on science or medicine. In 2005 he also won the \\"September 11th Award\\" from the Center for Biodefense and Emerging Pathogens at Brown University. He has served on a federal government's Infectious Disease Board of Experts, on the advisory board of Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Center for Engineering Fundamentals, and on the advisory committee at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health for its Center for Refugee and Disaster Response. Policymaking Two of his books involved him directly in policy-making. From January 2007 until October 16, 2013, he was a member of the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority - East (SLFPAE), the levee board responsible for protecting the New Orleans metro area on the east bank of the Mississippi River. On July 24, 2013, SLFPAE filed a lawsuit against Exxon Mobil, BP, Shell, Chevron and 94 other oil, gas, and pipeline companies for their role in damage to Louisiana's coast. Barry was the chief architect of this suit, and was the authority's spokesperson on it. Governor Bobby Jindal immediately demanded SLFPAE withdraw the lawsuit. The board was created after Hurricane Katrina by a constitutional amendment, and its members‚Äîunlike members of other levee boards in the state‚Äîcannot be removed by the governor without cause. However, when Barry's term on the board expired, Jindal did not reappoint him. The board continues to support the suit, and Barry continues to argue for it, speaking at Rotary Clubs and similar groups throughout Louisiana to generate political support. Nonetheless, in June 2014 the state legislature passed a bill attempting to retroactively kill the lawsuit. Despite a veto urged by Attorney General Buddy Caldwell and 116 law school professors who warned that the bill undermined some of the state's claims against BP for the 2010 spill‚Äîand the opinion that the bill did not even kill the lawsuit‚ÄîJindal signed the bill, which became Act 544. In August 2014, attorneys for the board filed a motion seeking a partial summary judgment arguing that Act 544 does not apply to the flood authority and that the law is unconstitutional. A state court ruled that flood authority lawyers were correct on both counts; in a separate action, a federal district court dismissed the case. Both lower court rulings are now on appeal, one in the state Supreme Court and one at the federal Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal. This work resulted in Barry's induction into Delta Omega, an academic honorary society for public health. He has advised the private sector and local, state, national, and international government officials about preparing for another influenza pandemic. He has also both advised officials and taken a direct role in preparing for water- related disasters. A resident of New Orleans, after Hurricane Katrina he was also named to both the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority (SLFPA), which is the levee board overseeing several separate levee districts in the New Orleans area, and the state's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority, which is responsible for hurricane protection for the entire state. Other work Barry has written for The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Time Magazine, Fortune, The Washington Post, Esquire, and other publications and frequently appears as a guest commentator on networks in the U.S., including on NBC's Meet the Press, ABC's World News Tonight, PBS's The News Hour, numerous NPR shows, and such foreign media as the BBC and Al Jazeera. Tulane University awarded him an honorary doctorate for his contribution to the recovery of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. Roger Williams University also awarded him an honorary doctorate.

He first served with the British in the 1755 Battle of Fort Beaus√©jour. He was later active at the Siege of Boston in 1776 and then in preparing defenses at Mt. Independence and Ft. Ticonderoga later that year. Following the cessation of the American Revolution Shattuck returned to Massachusetts where he was the largest landowner in the town of Groton. He was a key figure in the nation-defining 1786‚Äì87 farmers' revolt known as Shays' Rebellion, leading forces that shut down a state court in Concord. He was arrested in late 1786 on charges of treason, but was pardoned in 1787 by Governor John Hancock. Early life in Groton and military service Shattuck was born in the rural central Massachusetts town of Groton in 1736, not long after the final Indian raids and skirmishes that had so often embattled the town during its early colonial period. His family occupied a large tract of land in the northwest corner of town, much of the acreage fronting the banks of the Nashua River. He would eventually become, through ultimogeniture, and his own purchases, the largest landowner in Groton with an estate of approximately 500 acres. At the age of 19, Shattuck joined the provincial militia as a private in Captain Ephraim Jones's company and took part in the campaign involving the removal of thousands of French settlers in Nova Scotia in 1755. Two decades would pass before he again donned a uniform, this time eschewing the royal red coat of the British private for the homespun utilitarian attire of the colonial militiaman. He responded to the Lexington Alarm, arriving too late to participate, continued on to Cambridge for several days and then returned to Groton where he served on a town committee to assist the Boston poor that had evacuated that city upon the British return. He was part of a company of men that went to Boston in the fall of 1775 for a six-week period to provide necessary backup as Washington put the Continental Army into place. He returned to Groton, but then went back to Boston to participate in the siege. That summer of 1776 he led Groton men to Mt. Independence and Ft. Ticonderoga as part of the northern defense, returning to Groton in December 1776. He was promoted to the rank of captain by the provincial congress in 1776 and was also elected town selectman of Groton on three occasions during the war. Groton Riots In October 1781, while serving as town selectman, Shattuck was one of eighteen men obstructing the tax collecting efforts of two constables on three separate occasions, a series of events called the \\"Groton Riots.\\" In April 1782, he pleaded guilty to rioting and paid a fine of ten pounds. Notwithstanding, townspeople continued to elect him to various positions in local government and as its representative in negotiating benefits on the behalf of soldiers. Shays' Rebellion Crippled by debt in the aftermath of the revolution, the state of Massachusetts levied upon its towns and citizens tax burdens higher than had been in place during British rule. Those who suddenly found themselves in arrears to the state quickly discovered that their land, livelihood and possibly even their freedom were at stake. Many who could not assuage their debts faced the unpleasant prospect of serving time in a debtors' prison. The high tax burden, combined with the demand that it be paid in specie and the high-handed control of the government by merchant interests, transformed rural resentment into a full-blown agrarian revolt. The rebellion was waged primarily by debt-ridden western farmers and landowners who banded together and captured shire town courthouses in Massachusetts, closing them to all proceedings. Violence was threatened and enacted against many officials who would not stand down. On a national scale, the rebellion was viewed with intense interest by citizens and public officials of all of the confederated former colonies because it \\"tested the precarious institutions of the new republic.\\" To officials in Boston, Job Shattuck became, perhaps even more than Daniel Shays, the leader of the agrarians in the western part of the state, a leading firebrand and empathetic advocate of the soldier‚Äìfarmer who had risked life, limb, and land for the cause of the revolution only to return from the war to find injustice and foreclosure still looming. Closure of the court at Concord and attempt at Cambridge On a rainy September day in 1786, Shattuck led a mob of roughly 200 men and forcibly closed session at the Middlesex County Courthouse in Concord. A similar raid upon the courthouse in Cambridge was planned by the Shaysites for November; however, officials in Boston acted before this could occur by issuing a warrant for the immediate arrest of Shattuck and four other conspirators. As described in Artful and Designing Men, by Gary Shattuck, court documents reveal that Job Shattuck had been threatened with death by protestors from neighboring Worcester County if he did not participate in the Cambridge takeover. Arrest and reprisals Charged with treason, on November 30, 1786, Shattuck was harried across the Groton countryside by over 100 men, of whom several were members of the Independent Corps of Cadets from Boston. After they violently searched his home and failed to find him (during which at least one member of his family was injured), they found him on the banks of the Nashua River and took him into custody. He nearly lost his right leg when a cadet slashed it with a sword just above the knee. Shattuck was transported from Groton to Concord and then to Boston and placed into a debtors' cell at the town jail. He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death by hanging in May 1787, but was pardoned by Governor John Hancock the following September. Shattuck died on January 13, 1819.

Zebra chip, also known as papa manchada and papa rayada, is the term for a disease in potatoes putatively caused by an alphaproteobacteria \\"Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum\\", which is vectored by the potato psyllid. When fried, potato tubers from infected plants develop unsightly black lines resembling the stripes of zebras that render the chips unsellable. Additionally, striped sections of chips frequently burn and caramelize, resulting in a bitter flavor. No health risks have been connected with consumption of infected potato chips.  Emergence  Zebra chip was first identified in 1994 near Saltillo, Mexico, and was originally named papa manchada (stained potato). In the early 1990s, Texas potato farms reported afflictions, though the disease was not identified in the state until 2000. Since then, zebra chip has been reported in the U.S. states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Oregon, Kansas, Nebraska, and New Mexico. Since 2000, Guatemala reported a disease known as papa rayada (striped potato), which has been identified as zebra chip. New Zealand's first suspected case of zebra chip occurred in May 2008, when an Auckland greenhouse reported similar symptoms. In October 2012, the Australian government reviewed the importation of potatoes from New Zealand because of the presence of the disease in the country. Eastern Europe and southern Russia may also be currently experiencing the disease.  Cause  An experiment carried out by scientists from the USDA Agricultural Research Service's Vegetable and Forage Crops Research Unit indicates that creating chips from infected raw potatoes increases the visibility of zebra chip. The researchers correlated the presence of the tomato potato psyllid Bactericera cockerelli, which infests both potatoes and tomatoes, to the presence of zebra chip. One of the scientists also reported that targeting the suspected hosts, psyllids, with insect control measures proved effective at stopping the disease. Though early reports suggested the cause might be a bacterium, namely Candidatus Liberibacter, studies have not been able to consistently associate any phytoplasmas with the disease. It is currently postulated that the potato psyllid acts as a vector for the disease's unknown pathogen, as it is the only organism consistently associated with zebra chip. In 2008, New Zealand researchers investigating a B. cockerelli infestation in tomato and pepper greenhouses discovered a new bacterial species Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum whose genetic markers were found to be identical to those found at two potato farms in Texas. This bacterium is related to Candidatus Liberibacter spp., which cause citrus greening disease in citrus plants. There are currently three haplotypes of the bacterium ‚ÄòCandidatus Liberibacter solanacearum‚Äô that infect potato: haplotypes A, B, and F. Haplotype F was the latest to be discovered in Oregon's Klamath Basin. Signs Scientists suggest that zebra chip's namesake sign is caused by the conversion of potato starch to water-soluble sugar, causing the stripes to appear upon cooking. Another study suggests that discoloration is due to enzymatic browning involving a polyphenol oxidase.LC-MS Analysis of Phenolic Compounds in Tubers Showing Zebra Chip Symptoms. Duroy A. Navarre, Roshani Shakya, Joanne Holden and James M. Crosslin, American Journal of Potato Research, Volume 86, Number 2, 88-95, Many zebra chip symptoms are evident before the potato is even harvested; foliar signs include chlorosis, leaf scorching, swollen nodes, vascular tissue browning, and curled leaves. Subterranean signs include collapsed stolons, enlarged lenticels, vascular tissue browning, medullary ray discoloration, and necrotic flecking of tuber tissue. The University of Nebraska cites the subterranean signs as the unique identification of zebra chip from all other known potato diseases. Zebra chip has been noted among potato disease experts as being unusually complex, and possibly the product of two separate pathogens, as has been discovered before for basses richesses (SBR) and spraing.  Management  Partners of the CABI-led programme, Plantwise, including the Secretar√≠a de Agricultura y Ganader√≠a (SAG) in Honduras provide several recommendations for managing Zebra chip in potato. These include; reducing soil acidity before sowing, using certified seeds and removing any diseased plants. They also recommend practicing crop rotation to prepare the soil and not to sow any other hosts for 3 years so that bacteria on the soil will die. Economic impact Much of the economic impact of zebra chip stems not from edibility issues, but cosmetic ones; while not deemed hazardous to one's health, infected potatoes are visually unappealing and will not be purchased by processing companies. From this refusal stems most of the other costs, including lost wages from processing fewer potatoes. New Zealand After the initial June 2008 discovery of the new species of Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum, 14 countries implemented bans on various New Zealand crops and New Zealand withdrew export certification for tomatoes and capsicums as a precautionary measure. New Zealand's export certification has since been reinstated and some countries have indicated they will accept fruit again. Fiji stopped imports from New Zealand of potatoes, tomatoes, and capsicum, but ended the bans in July 2008. While French Polynesia did not ban any crops immediately, its restrictions were deemed unreasonable by New Zealand and all potato and capsicum exports to French Polynesia were halted. Having previously blocked imports of potatoes, Australia expanded that ban to include capsicum, tomatoes, cape gooseberries, tomarillos, and five other crops. Though it may be too early to estimate the economic impact of these bans, New Zealand's tomato and capsicum exports combined earn the nation over NZ$41 million (about US$30 million, August 2008) annually. Texas, United States Some farms in Texas have reported losses exceeding US$2 million in both 2005 and 2006, with about 35-40% of Texas potato farm acreage affected. Using IMPLAN, a macroeconomic impact model based upon average annual potato production in the state from 2003 to 2005, the total estimated lost product amounted to 38% of all potato production totaling $25.86 million. The economic impact reached beyond just the crop, however, resulting in estimates of total business losses of $125 million and total job losses of 970. The Center for North American Studies' report also predicted that if the disease is not stopped soon, South Texas could lose all of its potato crop and abandon farming of potatoes. Pacific Northwest, United States In the Pacific Northwest, where over 50% of the U.S. potatoes are grown, it was estimated to cost 11 million U.S. dollars to control the psyllid in a year. European Union According to European Commission Delegated Regulation of 1st August 2019 Candidatus Liberibacter spp. is officially listed as a quarantine pest in European Union. According to a study of 2012, the annual losses due to the pathogen were calculated at more than ‚Ç¨220 millions.

Haloform reaction scheme Mechanism In the first step, the halogen disproportionates in the presence of hydroxide to give the halide and hypohalite (example with bromine, but reaction is the same in case of chlorine and iodine; one should only substitute Br for Cl or I): \\\\mbox{Br}_{2} + 2 \\\\mbox{OH}^{{}-{}} ~ \\\\rightarrow ~ \\\\mbox{Br}^{{}-{}} + \\\\mbox{BrO}^{{}-{}} + \\\\mbox{H}_{2} \\\\mbox{O} If a secondary alcohol is present,it is oxidized to a ketone by the hypohalite: 550px If a methyl ketone is present, it reacts with the hypohalite in a three- step process: 1\\\\. Under basic conditions, the ketone undergoes keto-enol tautomerization. The enolate undergoes electrophilic attack by the hypohalite (containing a halogen with a formal +1 charge). :400px 2\\\\. When the Œ±(alpha) position has been exhaustively halogenated, the molecule undergoes a nucleophilic acyl substitution by hydroxide, with ‚àíCX3 being the leaving group stabilized by three electron-withdrawing groups. In the third step the ‚àíCX3 anion abstracts a proton from either the solvent or the carboxylic acid formed in the previous step, and forms the haloform. At least in some cases (chloral hydrate) the reaction may stop and the intermediate product isolated if conditions are acidic and hypohalite is used. :500px Scope Substrates are broadly limited to methyl ketones and secondary alcohols oxidizable to methyl ketones, such as isopropanol. The only primary alcohol and aldehyde to undergo this reaction are ethanol and acetaldehyde, respectively. 1,3-Diketones such as acetylacetone also give the haloform reaction. Œ≤-ketoacids such as acetoacetic acid will also give the test upon heating. Acetyl chloride and acetamide don't give this test. The halogen used may be chlorine, bromine, iodine or sodium hypochlorite. Fluoroform (CHF3) cannot be prepared by this method as it would require the presence of the highly unstable hypofluorite ion. However ketones with the structure RCOCF3 do cleave upon treatment with base to produce fluoroform; this is equivalent to the second and third steps in the process shown above. Applications=Laboratory scale Negative and positive iodoform test This reaction forms the basis of the iodoform test which was commonly used in history as a chemical test to determine the presence of a methyl ketone, or a secondary alcohol oxidizable to a methyl ketone. When iodine and sodium hydroxide are used as the reagents a positive reaction gives iodoform, which is a solid at room temperature and tends to precipitate out of solution causing a distinctive cloudiness. In organic chemistry, this reaction may be used to convert a terminal methyl ketone into the analogous carboxylic acid. Industrially It was formerly used to produce iodoform, bromoform, and even chloroform industrially. As a by- product of water chlorination Water chlorination can result in the formation of haloforms if the water contains suitable reactive impurities (e.g. humic acid). There is a concern that such reactions may lead to the presence of carcinogenic compounds in drinking water. History The haloform reaction is one of the oldest organic reactions known. In 1822, Georges-Simon Serullas added potassium metal to a solution of iodine in ethanol and water to form potassium formate and iodoform, called in the language of that time hydroiodide of carbon. On pages 17‚Äì20, Surellas produced iodoform by passing a mixture of iodine vapor and steam over red-hot coals. However, later, on pages 28‚Äì29, he produced iodoform by adding potassium metal to a solution of iodine in ethanol (which also contained some water). In 1832, Justus von Liebig reported the reaction of chloral with calcium hydroxide to form chloroform and calcium formate. On pages 259‚Äì265, Liebig describes Chlorkohlenstoff (\\"carbon chloride\\", chloroform), but on p. 264, Liebig incorrectly states that the empirical formula of chloroform is C2Cl5. From p. 259: \\"Chlorkohlenstoff. Man erh√§lt diese neue Verbindung, wenn man Chloral mit √§tzenden Alkalien, Kalkmilch oder Barytwasser in Ueberschuss vermischt und das Gemenge destillirt.\\" (Chloroform. One obtains this new compound when one mixes chloral with an excess of caustic alkalies, milk of lime [solution of calcium hydroxide] or barite water [solution of barium hydroxide], and [then] distills the mixture.) The reaction was rediscovered by Adolf Lieben in 1870.See: * * The iodoform test is also called the Lieben haloform reaction. A review of the Haloform reaction with a history section was published in 1934.

In 1976 she released her autobiography, titled Honey: The Life and Loves of Lenny's Shady Lady.Shady Lady at Goodreads accessed 1-1-2016 Early life Friedman was born Harriett Jolliff in Manila, Arkansas, the daughter of unmarried teenage parents Mabel Layson and Murl Jolliff.1930 Census Record accessed 1-11-2016 She never knew her father, who died in a tuberculosis sanitorium. She was named after her paternal grandmother, Harriett Joliff (1877‚Äì1941), but as a child her nickname was Poochie. Her mother, Mabel, moved her and her sister Virginia to Detroit, Michigan, in search of work. Finding work at nightclubs, Mabel married a local hustler who often was in trouble with the law. While ostensibly owning a bookshop, in reality he was operating an illegal business from their attic. Young Harriet's mother and step-father enforced strict Catholic rules on her, and reportedly the home was an abusive environment. Harriet dreamed of leaving home for a career in show business, and she intently studied Hollywood movie stars like Lana Turner and Rita Hayworth. Harriet's unstable home life led to rebellion, and she started skipping school and staying away from home. Eventually she ran away from home with a female friend and two boys to nearby Toledo, Ohio, and from there, the four teenagers went to Florida. The boys hot-wired cars to steal transportation, and soon they arrived in Miami where they rented a room. To earn money to support themselves, the girls answered an ad in the paper for showgirls; Harriet was hired to be a topless dancer, but her friend was deemed not pretty enough and so was given a job as a cigarette girl. Once Harriet had earned enough money for the group to continue on their journey, she quit the dancing job, and the group planned to move from Miami Beach to Palm Beach. The two boys she was with had enlisted in the army and were \\"sowing some oats\\" before heading to basic training for World War II. One of the boys raped Harriet while she was sleeping, which she shrugged off as \\"the way things were\\". Harriet's friend left the group and went home to Detroit. With Harriet and the two boys in need of more money, they decided to break into a vending machine. They broke out the glass and managed to get cigarettes, candy, and cash into their pockets and escaped on foot into a nearby orange grove, but were caught by police. Once in custody, it was established that the group was responsible for several cars being stolen in addition to the theft, and Harriet was sentenced to one year incarceration at Florida State Prison. After her release, she worked as a successful stripper in Miami under the name Hot Honey Harlow. Lenny Bruce On June 15, 1951, she married comedian Lenny Bruce after meeting him in Baltimore. Bruce tried to become her manager and make her a legitimate star, but she fought against this. She sometimes performed with her husband on stage, including an act based on the Bride of Frankenstein. As an actress she appeared in the 1953 indie film Dance Hall Racket, which also starred Lenny Bruce. They divorced on January 21, 1957 after having a daughter, Kitty. The two fought a custody battle over their daughter. Later life Harlow successfully lobbied New York Governor George Pataki to pardon Bruce posthumously for the obscenity conviction resulting from his performance and arrest at the Cafe au Go Go in Greenwich Village in 1964. Lenny Bruce died of a drug overdose in 1966, and she continued to promote his legacy. She is credited in the 1974 film Lenny as being an advisor for the film. She married Jeffrey Friedman in 1984, and they remained married and living in Hawaii until her death. She had legally changed her name to Honey Bruce Friedman. Death She died on September 12, 2005 in Honolulu. In popular culture She was portrayed by Valerie Perrine in the 1974 biopic Lenny, for which Perrine was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress.

After two years of raising funds, the film was shot in and around Ashland and Medford, Oregon in November‚ÄìDecember 2007, and was released in 2009. Plot Calvin Marshall is a charismatic student at Bayford City College. When he tries out for the baseball team for the third straight year, ex-minor leaguer Coach Little is exasperated by Calvin's persistence despite Marshall's lack of baseball skills. Determined to make the team, Calvin wins Little over with pure heart and love of the game. While rehabilitating during an injury, Calvin announces games for the Lady Bisons volleyball team and is entranced by their star, Tori. Preoccupied with caring for her sick mother and more interested with meaningless flings, Tori is unsure what to make of Calvin's advances.

Cunningham had planned to fund Calvin Marshall, but did not have the money to create the company's first full-length feature film. They hired a casting director, Christine Sheaks, who successfully sought out Steve Zahn for the part of Coach Little. Over the two years it took to raise enough money, a number of financiers pulled out but Zahn's promised participation attracted further sponsorship. Calvin Marshall began filming on November 11, 2007 in Ashland, Oregon. Line producer Gary Kout said that Ashland was chosen as a filming location because \\"the setting of the film [is] fictitious and Ashland has a timeless feel to it and creates a beautiful backdrop.\\" The Lady Bisons volleyball scenes were filmed at Southern Oregon University's McNeal Pavilion and gymnasium, with around 200 extras standing in as supporters in the stands. North Mountain Park's softball fields were used for several of the scenes in the film. Other locations included city streets and local homes in Ashland, the Whiskey River Cafe and Lounge in Central Point and the Rogue Valley Family Fun Center in Central Point; between US$400,000 and $500,000 was spent on filming permits for public places.

For example: if a process uses a log file to record its progress, the process could slow down. Furthermore, the act of viewing the file while the process is running could cause an I/O error in the process, which could, in turn, cause it to stop. Another example would be observing the performance of a CPU by running both the observed and observing programs on the same CPU, which will lead to inaccurate results because the observer program itself affects the CPU performance (modern, heavily cached and pipelined CPUs are particularly affected by this kind of observation). The observer effect could either have a positive or negative impact on the computer process behaviour. A positive impact can be software bugs, also known as Heisenbugs, which diminish or change their negative behavior when observation mechanisms, such as debugging, are enabled. Such bugs usually create extra difficulties in being isolated.

A common example is checking the pressure in an automobile tire; this is difficult to do without letting out some of the air, thus changing the pressure. Similarly, it is not possible to see any object without light hitting the object, and causing it to reflect that light. While the effects of observation are often negligible, the object still experiences a change. This effect can be found in many domains of physics, but can usually be reduced to insignificance by using different instruments or observation techniques. An especially unusual version of the observer effect occurs in quantum mechanics, as best demonstrated by the double-slit experiment. Physicists have found that even passive observation of quantum phenomena (by changing the test apparatus and passively 'ruling out' all but one possibility), can actually change the measured result. A particularly famous example is the 1998 Weizmann experiment. Despite the \\"observer\\" in this experiment being an electronic detector‚Äîpossibly due to the assumption that the word \\"observer\\" implies a person‚Äîits results have led to the popular belief that a conscious mind can directly affect reality. The need for the \\"observer\\" to be conscious is not supported by scientific research, and has been pointed out as a misconception rooted in a poor understanding of the quantum wave function and the quantum measurement process,\\"Of course the introduction of the observer must not be misunderstood to imply that some kind of subjective features are to be brought into the description of nature. The observer has, rather, only the function of registering decisions, i.e., processes in space and time, and it does not matter whether the observer is an apparatus or a human being; but the registration, i.e., the transition from the \\"possible\\" to the \\"actual,\\" is absolutely necessary here and cannot be omitted from the interpretation of quantum theory.\\" - Werner Heisenberg, Physics and Philosophy, p. 137\\"Was the wave function waiting to jump for thousands of millions of years until a single-celled living creature appeared? Or did it have to wait a little longer for some highly qualified measurer - with a PhD?\\" -John Stewart Bell, 1981, Quantum Mechanics for Cosmologists. In C.J. Isham, R. Penrose and D.W. Sciama (eds.), Quantum Gravity 2: A second Oxford Symposium. Oxford: Clarendon Press, p. 611.According to standard quantum mechanics, it is a matter of complete indifference whether the experimenters stay around to watch their experiment, or instead leave the room and delegate observing to an inanimate apparatus which amplifies the microscopic events to macroscopic measurements and records them by a time- irreversible process (). The measured state is not interfering with the states excluded by the measurement. As Richard Feynman put it: \\"Nature does not know what you are looking at, and she behaves the way she is going to behave whether you bother to take down the data or not.\\" (). apparently being the generation of information at its most basic level that produces the effect. Particle physics An electron is detected upon interaction with a photon; this interaction will inevitably alter the velocity and momentum of that electron. It is possible for other, less direct means of measurement to affect the electron. It is also necessary to distinguish clearly between the measured value of a quantity and the value resulting from the measurement process. In particular, a measurement of momentum is non-repeatable in short intervals of time. A formula (one-dimensional for simplicity) relating involved quantities, due to Niels Bohr (1928) is given by :v'_x - v_x\\\\Delta p_x \\\\approx \\\\hbar/\\\\Delta t, where :Œîpx is uncertainty in measured value of momentum, :Œît is duration of measurement, :vx is velocity of particle before measurement, : is velocity of particle after measurement, : is the reduced Planck constant. The measured momentum of the electron is then related to , whereas its momentum after the measurement is related to . This is a best-case scenario. Electronics In electronics, ammeters and voltmeters are usually wired in series or parallel to the circuit, and so by their very presence affect the current or the voltage they are measuring by way of presenting an additional real or complex load to the circuit, thus changing the transfer function and behavior of the circuit itself. Even a more passive device such as a current clamp, which measures the wire current without coming into physical contact with the wire, affects the current through the circuit being measured because the inductance is mutual. Thermodynamics In thermodynamics, a standard mercury-in-glass thermometer must absorb or give up some thermal energy to record a temperature, and therefore changes the temperature of the body which it is measuring. Quantum mechanics The theoretical foundation of the concept of measurement in quantum mechanics is a contentious issue deeply connected to the many interpretations of quantum mechanics. A key focus point is that of wave function collapse, for which several popular interpretations assert that measurement causes a discontinuous change into an eigenstate of the operator associated with the quantity that was measured, a change which is not time-reversible. More explicitly, the superposition principle ( of quantum physics dictates that for a wave function , a measurement will result in a state of the quantum system of one of the possible eigenvalues , of the operator which in the space of the eigenfunctions . Once one has measured the system, one knows its current state; and this prevents it from being in one of its other states ‚Å†‚Äî it has apparently decohered from them without prospects of future strong quantum interference.B.D'Espagnat, P.Eberhard, W.Schommers, F.Selleri. Quantum Theory and Pictures of Reality. Springer-Verlag, 1989, This means that the type of measurement one performs on the system affects the end-state of the system. An experimentally studied situation related to this is the quantum Zeno effect, in which a quantum state would decay if left alone, but does not decay because of its continuous observation. The dynamics of a quantum system under continuous observation are described by a quantum stochastic master equation known as the Belavkin equation. Further studies have shown that even observing the results after the photon is produced leads to collapsing the wave function and loading a back-history as shown by delayed choice quantum eraser. When discussing the wave function which describes the state of a system in quantum mechanics, one should be cautious of a common misconception that assumes that the wave function amounts to the same thing as the physical object it describes. This flawed concept must then require existence of an external mechanism, such as a measuring instrument, that lies outside the principles governing the time evolution of the wave function , in order to account for the so-called \\"collapse of the wave function\\" after a measurement has been performed. But the wave function is not a physical object like, for example, an atom, which has an observable mass, charge and spin, as well as internal degrees of freedom. Instead, is an abstract mathematical function that contains all the statistical information that an observer can obtain from measurements of a given system. In this case, there is no real mystery in that this mathematical form of the wave function must change abruptly after a measurement has been performed. In the context of the so- called hidden-measurements interpretation of quantum mechanics, the observer- effect can be understood as an instrument effect which results from the combination of the following two aspects: (a) an invasiveness of the measurement process, intrinsically incorporated in its experimental protocol (which therefore cannot be eliminated); (b) the presence of a random mechanism (due to fluctuations in the experimental context) through which a specific measurement-interaction is each time actualized, in a non-predictable (non- controllable) way.Sassoli de Bianchi, M. (2013). The Observer Effect. Foundations of Science 18, pp. 213‚Äì243, arXiv:1109.3536.Sassoli de Bianchi, M. (2015). God may not play dice, but human observers surely do.

A consequence of Bell's theorem is that measurement on one of two entangled particles can appear to have a nonlocal effect on the other particle. Additional problems related to decoherence arise when the observer is modeled as a quantum system, as well. The uncertainty principle has been frequently confused with the observer effect, evidently even by its originator, Werner Heisenberg. The uncertainty principle in its standard form describes how precisely we may measure the position and momentum of a particle at the same time ‚Äì if we increase the precision in measuring one quantity, we are forced to lose precision in measuring the other.Heisenberg, W.

First released in September 2008, the Dream was the first commercially released device to use the Linux-based Android operating system, which was purchased and further developed by Google and the Open Handset Alliance to create an open competitor to other major smartphone platforms of the time, such as Symbian, BlackBerry OS, and iPhone OS. The operating system offers a customizable graphical user interface, integration with Google services such as Gmail, a notification system that shows a list of recent messages pushed from apps, and Android Market for downloading additional apps. The Dream was released to mostly positive reception. While the Dream was praised for its solid and robust hardware design, the introduction of the Android operating system was met with criticism for its lack of certain functionality and third- party software in comparison to more established platforms, but was still considered to be innovative due to its open nature, notifications system, and heavy integration with Google services, like Gmail.  History = Development  The \\"Sooner\\" prototype was shelved in favor of the Dream In July 2005, Google acquired Android Inc., a company led by Andy Rubin which was working on unspecified software for mobile devices. Under the leadership of Google, the team was in the process of developing a standardized, Linux-based operating system for mobile phones to compete against the likes of Symbian and Windows Mobile, which would be offered for use by individual original equipment manufacturers. Initial development of what would become Android was targeted towards a prototype device codenamed \\"Sooner\\"; the device was a messaging phone in the style of BlackBerry, with a small, non-touch screen, navigation keys, and a physical QWERTY keyboard. The January 2007 unveiling of the iPhone, Apple's first smartphone, and its pioneering design aspects, caught Rubin off-guard and led to a change in course for the project. The operating system's design was quickly reworked, and attention shifted to a new prototype device codenamed \\"Dream\\"‚Äîa touchscreen device with a sliding, physical keyboard. The inclusion of a physical keyboard was intentional, as Android developers recognized users did not like the idea of a virtual keyboard as they lacked the physical feedback that makes hardware keyboards useful. The Android operating system was officially unveiled in November 2007 along with the founding of the Open Handset Alliance (OHA); a consortium of hardware, software, and telecommunication companies devoted to advancing open standards for mobile devices. These companies included Google, along with HTC, a company which was at the time, one of the largest manufacturers of phones. While Google indicated in 2008 that several Linux devices were being tested in preparation for the official public launch of Android, only one was to be released in the United States that year‚Äîthe HTC Dream. Plans called for the Dream to be released on T-Mobile USA by the end of the year (with some reports suggesting October 2008), targeting the holiday shopping season. Sprint had worked with the OHA, but had not yet unveiled any plans to release an Android phone of its own, while Verizon Wireless and AT&T; did not have any plans for Android devices yet at all.  Release  A bronze T-Mobile G1 carrier- branded version of the Dream HTC officially announced the Dream on 23 September 2008. It would first be released by T-Mobile as the T-Mobile G1, starting in the United States on 20 October 2008 in its 3G-enabled markets only (it became available in all markets on 24 January 2009), followed by a British release in November 2008, and a release in other European territories in early 2009. On 10 March 2009, it became available in Poland as the Era G1 on Era. On 2 June 2009, both the Dream and its successor (the HTC Magic) were released by Rogers Wireless in Canada. The Dream was discontinued by T-Mobile on 27 July 2010. The G1 was spiritually succeeded in October 2010 by the T-Mobile G2, a new HTC device which also featured stock Android and a sliding keyboard, and was T-Mobile USA's first \\"4G\\" smartphone. In Canada, Rogers suspended sales of the Dream on 15 January 2010 due to a bug affecting the proper use of emergency calls.  Features = Hardware  A white HTC Dream with back cover removed The Dream's exterior uses a soft, smooth matte plastic shell, and was made available in white, black, and bronze colors. The Dream's design features a distinctive \\"chin\\" on the bottom, which houses 5 navigation buttons (\\"Call\\", \\"Home\\", \\"Menu\\", \\"Back\\", and \\"End Call\\") and a clickable trackball in the center which can be used for scrolling and selecting. The device uses a capacitive touchscreen LCD at a resolution of 320√ó480; the screen can be slid along a curved hinge to expose a five-row QWERTY keyboard‚Äîas the first releases of Android did not include a virtual keyboard, the keyboard was originally the only method of text input on the device. While supporting multitouch at the hardware level, the Linux kernel in the Dream's Android distribution was patched to remove multitouch support from its touchscreen drivers for undisclosed reasons. The Dream does not include a traditional headphone jack, requiring an adapter for HTC's proprietary (but Mini-USB compatible) \\"ExtUSB\\" port located on the bottom of the device. The rear of the device houses a 3.15-megapixel rear camera with auto-focus. The Dream uses a 528 MHz Qualcomm MSM7201A system on a chip with 192 MB of RAM, and comes with 256 MB of internal storage, which can be expanded by up to 16 GB using a Micro SD card slot. For network connectivity, the Dream supports Quad-band GSM 850/900/1800/1900 MHz and GPRS/EDGE, plus Dual band UMTS Bands I and IV (1700 & 2100 MHz) and HSDPA/HSUPA (in US/Europe) at 7.2/2 Mbit/s. The device also supports standalone GPS and A-GPS.  Software  The HTC Dream was the first ever smartphone to ship with the Android operating system. The operating system heavily integrates with, and provides apps for various Google services, such as Gmail (with push email support), Maps, Search, Talk, and YouTube, while the contacts and calendar apps can sync with the online Google Contacts and Google Calendar services respectively. The device also ships with an email app supporting other POP3 and IMAP-based mail services, an instant messaging app with support for multiple services, and a WebKit-based web browser. A notification system displays icons for certain events (such as e-mails and text messages) on the left side of the status bar across the top of the screen; dragging down from the top of the screen exposes a tray with more detailed information for each notification. The Android Market can be used to download additional apps for the device. The G1 as sold by T-Mobile also shipped with an Amazon MP3 app, allowing users to purchase DRM-free music online, and download them straight to the device via Wi-Fi. The Dream could also be upgraded to newer versions of Android, which added new features and enhancements to the platform. The latest version of Android officially made available for the Dream, 1.6 \\"Donut\\", was released for T-Mobile USA's G1 in October 2009. The 1.6 update was not released on the Rogers HTC Dream in Canada (which stayed on 1.5 \\"Cupcake\\"); Rogers claimed that the update was only being made available for \\"'Google'-branded\\" models of the device.  Development and modding  Due to the open source nature of the Android platform, the Dream became a popular target for modding. Shortly after the release of the Dream, developers discovered a software exploit which would allow a user to gain superuser access to the phone‚Äîa process which would be referred to as \\"rooting\\". As a parallel to \\"jailbreaking\\" on iOS devices, root access would enable users to perform tweaks and other changes at the system level that cannot be performed under normal circumstances (such as adding auto-rotation, and installing a custom kernel that restored the aforementioned multitouch support). After the Dream's bootloader was dumped, work began on modifying it so that it could install third-party firmware, and on converting official Android update files into a format that could be installed using the modified bootloader. Around the same time, Google made the Android Dev Phone 1 available for registered Android developers; the Dev Phone 1 was a SIM- and hardware-unlocked version of the HTC Dream that came pre-configured for superuser access to the internal files of the phone, allowing users to completely replace the bootloader and operating system. As a result of these developments, a dedicated community, centered on forums such as XDA Developers, emerged surrounding the creation of custom firmware (\\"ROMs\\") built from the Android source code. Projects such as CyanogenMod continued to produce ports of newer versions of Android for the Dream and later Android devices, while adding their own features and enhancements to the operating system as well. On later Android devices, where a number of factors (including carrier practices, and custom software provided by device manufacturers that sit atop Android, such as HTC Sense and Samsung TouchWiz) led to fragmentation regarding the availability of newer versions of the OS for certain devices, the development and use of custom ROMs (which are usually based on the \\"stock\\" version of Android) have ultimately become an important, yet controversial aspect of the Android ecosystem. In August 2012, a group of users released an unofficial port of a later version of Android, 4.1 \\"Jelly Bean\\", for the Dream as a proof of concept. However, the port lacked key functionality, and had severe performance issues due to the phone's relatively weak hardware in comparison to the modern devices that 4.1 was designed for.  Reception = Critical reception  The Dream was released to mixed reviews. The design of the Dream was considered to be solid and robust; Joshua Topolsky of Engadget considered its hardware design a contrast to that of the iPhone, due to its numerous navigation buttons (in comparison to just a home button) and its \\"charming, retro-future look; like a gadget in a 1970's sci-fi movie set in the year 2038.\\" The Dream's keyboard, as the only method of text input prior to Android 1.5's introduction of a virtual keyboard, was considered to be sufficient, although some felt that its keys were too small. Its display was considered sufficient for a phone of its class, but John Brandon of TechRadar felt that it was not good enough for watching videos due to its poor contrast and small size in comparison to the iPhone. Android itself was considered to still be in its infancy (primarily due to its bare-bones functionality in certain areas, limited application catalog, lack of multitouch gestures, or syncing with certain enterprise platforms), but showed promise through its customizable interface, increased flexibility over iOS, its notification system, ability to display security permissions when downloading apps, and its heavy integration with Google services. Brandon gave the Dream a 4.5/5, despite stating that it was \\"no Apple iPhone killer\\", given its lower quality of its application selection and multimedia features in comparison. In conclusion, the Dream was considered to be a \\"stellar\\" phone that \\"points to a future when a phone is as flexible and useful as the PC on your desk.\\" Engadget felt that the Dream \\"isn't going to blow anyone's mind right out of the gate\\" due to its hardware, but that the Android platform as a whole held its own against its competitors, and that early adopters of Android through the G1 were \\"buying into one of the most exciting developments in the mobile world in recent memory.\\" GSMArena noted that the Dream would have been \\"another average smart QWERTY messenger\\" had it not been for its introduction of Android; in conclusion, the Dream was considered \\"far from the perfect package\\", but still believed that \\"it gets the things that matter done and gets them done right.\\"  Commercial reception  In April 2009, T-Mobile announced that it had sold over a million G1s in the United States, accounting for two thirds of the devices on its 3G network. AdMob estimated in March 2009 that Android and the G1 had reached a market share of 6% in the United States.

His eldest brother was Gaius Julius Agrippa and his younger sister was Julia Iotapa. Surviving inscriptions about Berenicianus reveal that his family were related to important members of Asian, non-Jewish, and Jewish aristocracy. Berenicianus was of Jewish, Nabataean, Edomite, Greek, Armenian, Median and Persian origins. His paternal grandparents were King Tigranes VI of Armenia and his wife Opgalli. Through Tigranes, he was a descendant of King Archelaus of Cappadocia, as well as the King of Judea, Herod the Great, and his wife Mariamne. Agrippa along with his family and paternal relatives were among the last known descendants of the Herodian Dynasty. He was an apostate to Judaism. It is unlikely that Berenicianus attempted to exert influence on Judean politics. His name indicates that the family connections from the Herodian Dynasty were not wholly broken. His maternal grandparents were King Antiochus IV of Commagene and Queen Julia Iotapa. The Kingdom of Cetis was a small client state in the Roman Empire, in Cilicia, that was previously ruled by his Cappadocian royal ancestors and Antiochus IV. The city of Elaiussa Sebaste was a part of the Kingdom. When his parents married in Rome in 58 AD, the Emperor Nero crowned his parents as monarchs and gave them that region to rule. He was born, raised, and educated in Cetis. In 94, Berenicianus, along with Agrippa entered the Roman Senate. Surviving inscriptions also reveal the career of Berenicianus. He served as a suffect consul in 116. Between 132 and 133, he was Proconsul of the Roman Province of Asia, during which he appeared to have been a patron of the arts. (BCH 1, 1877, 291, no. 80) He married Cassia Lepida (born c. 80), daughter of Cassius Lepidus (son of Cassius Longinus and Junia Lepida). Through her father and paternal grandmother, Cassia was a direct descendant of the Emperor Augustus. Berenicianus and Cassia had a daughter named Julia Cassia Alexandra (born c. AD 105), who married Gaius Avidius Heliodorus (born c. AD 100). Heliodorus was ab epistulis under the emperor Hadrian and praefectus Aegypti between AD 138 and 140. Heliodorus and Alexandra had children, including the usurper Avidius Cassius. A possible descendant of Berenicianus was the 3rd-century usurper Jotapianus.

River Looe River Fowey River Otter River Axe The Westcountry Rivers Trust is a waterway society and a registered charity No. 1135007 in the West Country of England, United Kingdom. The Trust was founded in 1995 and aims to protect and enhance the West Country's rivers and streams, and to work with the region's landowners, farmers and the wider community, mainly through education projects.  History of the Trust  The Westcountry Rivers Trust was launched in 1994 by a group of individuals who shared a love of rivers and concerns for the health of freshwater environments in the region. These individuals were particularly motivated to act, having observed a decline in water quality and fish populations in the rivers Taw and Torridge, largely resulting from drought and eutrophication. Additionally, they had been inspired by the success of communities joining together elsewhere to improve their environment. This group went on to become the first board of trustees when the Westcountry Rivers Trust gained its charitable status in 1995 and included a number of notable figures: Poet Laureate Ted Hughes, Stuart Gardiner, Lord Clinton, Teddy Goldsmith, Nick Grant, Alan Hawken, Michael Heathcoat-Amory, Michael Martin, Bill Tucker and Ann Voss-Bark. After a long period of volunteering, the first employee of the Trust was Arlin Rickard, who set up headquarters in his home. Arlin Rickard has since become CEO of The Rivers Trust. The approach to river restoration taken by the Westcountry Rivers was particularly innovative at the time since it encouraged people to see how efforts to restore rivers have multiple additional benefits to farmers, water companies, tourism, estuary dredging and human health. Consequently, the changes to practice encouraged by the Trust outlasted the length of the projects. The Westcountry Rivers Trust offered a refreshing stance to the restoration of our rivers; while so many efforts to conserve the environment are limited to the length of the project, it realised that it could open people's eyes to the wider benefits of river restoration. Measures to protect rivers could also help to save money for farmers, lower costs for water companies, boost tourism, reduce the need to dredge our estuaries and even benefit human health. Further to this, the Trust ensured that their work took into account the best available science and adopted an ‚Äòecosystems approach,‚Äô which considers the functioning of the entire river catchment, rather than focusing solely on the river channel. Despite its beginning as a small, grassroots charity, the potential of the Westcountry Rivers Trust's approach to make positive change to the river environment was recognised in 1996 when it was awarded the ¬£1.6 million Tamar 2000 project. In 2017, the Trust employs a team of 36 and its approach to river restoration has been rolled out nationwide; following the establishment of The Rivers Trust in 2001, there are now in excess of 54 rivers trusts across the UK, making the rivers trust movement one of the most rapidly growing environmental movements.  Projects = Upstream Thinking 2 (2015‚Äì2020)  Alongside partners from Devon Wildlife Trust, Cornwall Wildlife Trust & Exmoor National Park Authority, the Westcountry Rivers Trust is currently delivering the second phase of the South West Water-funded Upstream Thinking project. The main aim of the Upstream Thinking project is to improve the quality of water in our rivers, which are the primary source of drinking water in the South West, and so reduce the need for costly and resource-intensive treatment processes at the Water treatment works. Often water quality issues in the region are caused by thousands of small incidents throughout the catchment. While these individual incidents tend not to be severe enough to breach water standards, they can have a large cumulative effect on the river. The approach taken by the Westcountry Rivers Trust is to work with landowners to reduce or mitigate the pressures on the river system across 5 important river catchments in the Westcountry: the Fowey, Tamar, Exe, Dart and Otter. In addition to the benefits to South West Water and their customers, the Upstream Thinking projects brings benefits in terms of the general health of the rivers, their ecology, wider biodiversity and agricultural productivity. Upstream Thinking 2010‚Äì2015 The Trust delivered South West Water's funded Upstream Thinking project, which is a collaborative conservation project on a catchment scale working to deliver a sustainable approach to land and water resource management. The project targeted strategic catchments in the Westcountry, which supply reservoirs and abstraction points, in a move to significantly improve raw water quality. By doing so, it reduced the cost of treatment plant and continual upgrading which has become necessary due to the increased sediment and/or nutrient loading in watercourses. The Upstream Thinking initiative is collectively worth over ¬£9m and was the first project of its kind in the UK. The project value to WRT was ¬£3.2m in the PR09 period, which entails farm advice and tailored farm plans to identify and tackle diffuse pollution from agriculture across five catchments. Upstream Thinking Reverse Auction As part of Upstream Thinking the Trust ran a reverse auction run on the river Fowey in conjunction with the University or East Anglia (funded by the DEFRA Economics Team). The auction distributed ¬£360k against competitive bids submitted by farmers for capital works and management actions enshrined in a contract and 25-year covenant. Bids were evaluated in terms of environmental value for money using an advisor devised scoring matrix to score different interventions and then weight them against the intensity of farming operations and geographical location and the inherent risk of their land. Catchment Restoration Fund ‚Äì River Improvement Projects The Trust delivered 5 CRF projects on the South Hams rivers, Dart & Teign, Exe & Axe, South Cornwall Rivers and on the Taw. The Taw River Improvement Project (TRIP ‚Äì ¬£1.8m) delivered Good Ecological Status for the Water Framework Directive on the river Taw. The predominant failures of these projects are addressing lack of fish and high phosphate levels. The projects included: ‚Äì data assessment and surveying group that is apportioning sediment and phosphate using modelling programmes (SAGIS, SCIMAP, PSYCHIC, ECM, etc.) and novel tracing work; ‚Äì fisheries work running walk over surveys and improving fish habitat and access; ‚Äì agricultural work, linking with farmers to reduce sedimentation and phosphate loss; and ‚Äì biodiversity work, delivering with landowners to use habitat to address WFD failures. Catchment Based Approach The Westcountry Rivers Trust has played host to several Catchment partnership but the longest is the Tamar Catchment Area Partnership, which consists of over 100 stakeholders representing over 30 organisations and groups. The initial pilot sought to address a failure in communication between the wants and needs of the stakeholders across a broad suite of ecosystem services, which historically has resulted in a multitude of sectorally focused management plans that at best do not articulate with, and at worse conflict against, each other. The Stakeholders formed six working groups that looked at water quality (both diffuse and point source), water quantity (both flooding and drought), carbon sequestration, habitats for wildlife and recreation/culture. Each group created a map(s) of the areas important in the provision of the service they were interested derived from a mutually agreed set of rules and assumptions. These maps where then combined to create a map of multifunctional areas that are important in the provision of several services. This allowed the wider partnership to understand the value of the catchment and where there were areas where complementary actions could lead to cost-benefit improvements. Cornwall Rivers Project This ¬£2.6 million Project, from 2002 to 2006, was funded by the European Union (European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Fund) Objective 1 Programme and by the UK Government's Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. It was aimed at those managing land in the catchments of these rivers and streams: *River Allen, River Caerhays, River Camel, River Looe (East Looe River), (West Looe River), River Fal, River Fowey, River Gannel, Lerryn River, River Inny, River Lynher, River Menalhyl, River Mevagissey, River Neet, River Otter, River Seaton, River Strat, River Tiddy, River Tresilian, River White. Trust members visited over 870 landholdings in Cornwall to help improve farming practice, to protect the environment and to make economic savings. More than 1,380 km of watercourses were surveyed, and Integrated River Basin Resource Management Plans issued.

She is best known for her leadership role in the 1958 Oklahoma City sit-in movement, as she, her young son and daughter, and numerous young members of the NAACP Youth Council successfully conducted carefully planned nonviolent sit-in protests of downtown drugstore lunch-counters, which overturned their policies of segregation. The Clara Luper Corridor is a streetscape and civic beautification project from the Oklahoma Capitol area east to northeast Oklahoma City. In 1972, Clara Luper was a Oklahoma candidate for election to the United States Senate. When asked by the press if she, a black woman, could represent white people, she responded: ‚ÄúOf course, I can represent white people, black people, red people, yellow people, brown people, and polka dot people. You see, I have lived long enough to know that people are people.‚Äù Luper continued desegregating hundreds of establishments in Oklahoma and was active on the national level during the 1960s movements. Early life and education Clara Shepard Luper was born in 1923 in rural Okfuskee County, Oklahoma. Her father, Ezell Shepard, was a World War I veteran and laborer. Her mother, Isabell Shepard, worked as a laundress. Young Clara was raised in Hoffman, Oklahoma. She went to high school in the all- black town of Grayson, Oklahoma, and attended college at Langston University where, in 1944, she received a B.A. in mathematics with a minor in history. In 1950, Luper became the first African American student in the graduate history program at the University of Oklahoma.Stefanie Lee Decker, \\"Luper, Clara Shepard\\", \\"Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture\\" She received an M.A. in History Education from the university in 1951. Civil rights activism Luper became the advisor for the Oklahoma City NAACP Youth Council in 1957 while working as a history teacher at Dunjee High School in Spencer, Oklahoma. The message and success of Martin Luther King Jr. and the Montgomery bus boycott influenced her activism, along with personal tragedies related to segregation. With the Youth Council, she wrote and staged a play entitled Brother President about King‚Äôs philosophy of nonviolence. In 1958, she was invited to bring the Oklahoma City Youth Council to perform Brother President for the NAACP in New York City. The trip to and from New York was a formative experience for Youth Council members. The trip showed her students that there were places where segregation did not thrive. After their trip to New York, the students felt that they could not go back to segregation after experiencing what equality provides. On their return to Oklahoma the Youth Council voted to initiate a campaign of non-violent civil disobedience to end segregation in Oklahoma City. This marked the group's decision to go into Katz Drug Store to perform their first sit-in.Walker, Devona. \\"Oklahoma City's Clara Luper helped give birth to a movement.\\" Daily Oklahoman, The (OK) 22 Feb. 2008. From 1958 to 1964 Luper mentored the members of the NAACP Youth Council during its campaign to end the segregation of public accommodations through sit-ins, protests, and boycotts. Oklahoma City sit-ins During her start as a civil rights leader for the NAACP Youth Council, she had plans to desegregate the restaurants and diners in Oklahoma. Her first target was Katz Drug Store, a segregated supermarket that had lunch counters. Before starting the sit-in, Luper had attempted to communicate with the owners by sending mails. She sent mail continuously to Katz but was ignored for 15 months. Finally, she agreed that enough time and effort was given to reach out, it was time to act. On Tuesday afternoon, August 19, 1958, Luper, her son and daughter, and a group of Youth Council members entered the segregated Katz Drug Store in downtown Oklahoma City and asked to be served. They were refused service, and the police were called. However, the group was not arrested, though they were met with increasing hostility and even threatened. While in the sit-in, she and her student waited from the time the shop opens until it closes. During this time, her students would bring out their books and study. Clara Luper was a civil rights activist, but she was a teacher first. Two days later, Katz corporate management in Kansas City desegregated its lunch counters in three states.Oklahoma City African Americans sit-in for integration, 1958-64, Global Nonviolent Action Database The 1958 Katz Drug Store sit-in had been suggested by Luper's eight-year-old daughter and occurred a year and a half before the February 1, 1960, Greensboro, North Carolina, sit-ins. It was one of the first sit-ins of the civil rights movement. The success of Civil Disobedience in Oklahoma could also be attributed to the Lieutenant of the Police force at the time, Bill Percer. Percer and Luper had a silent agreement that, he and his men would not harm her students if they practiced non-violence. Luper‚Äôs student also provided an advantage to her cause. The fact that the protestors were mainly schoolchildren, it would be less likely that the sit-in would end in violence such as the one in Greensboro. The tactics, the students, and the police all had a major part in allowing the desegregation of Oklahoma to not end in violence. From 1958 to 1964 Clara Luper was a major leader of the fight to end segregation in Oklahoma. She led the campaigns to gain equal banking rights, employment opportunities, open housing, and voting rights. Along with the NAACP Youth Council, she personally integrated hundreds of restaurants, cafes, theaters, hotels, and churches, including such notable Oklahoma City establishments as the Split-T drive-in and the Skirvin Hotel. She served on Governor J. Howard Edmondson‚Äôs Committee on Human Relations. Activism at the national level Luper was a prominent figure in the national Civil Rights Movement. She was active in the NAACP and attended the association‚Äôs annual conference every year with the Oklahoma City Youth Council. She took part in the 1963 March on Washington where Dr. King gave his ‚ÄúI Have a Dream‚Äù speech. She also took part in the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches where she received a deep cut in her leg on \\"Bloody Sunday\\" when 600 civil rights marchers were attacked by state and local police with tear gas and billy clubs. After 1964 Luper remained an important community figure as an activist, educator, and stalwart NAACP supporter. In these years, she expanded the range of her concerns to include advocacy for educational, economic, and political equality. In 1968, she was one of a handful of African American teachers hired to teach at Oklahoma City's Northwest Classen High School as part of the highly controversial court ordered school desegregation plan implemented that year. She was later reassigned to John Marshall High School (Oklahoma) where she continued to teach history and media studies. Oklahoma City Sanitation Workers Strike In August 1969, Luper was the spokesperson for striking sanitation workers in Oklahoma City. The sanitation workers sought a shorter work week, pay raises, and new grievance procedures. She supported the strike by allowing the workers to use the NAACP Youth Council‚Äôs Freedom Center in Oklahoma. The workers would use the Freedom Center to plan meetings and strikes. Clara, on the other hand, had been working to raise money to help these workers. She would often bring food to the Freedom Center for the workers to eat. The Oklahoma City sanitation strike began on August 19 and ended on November 7, 1969. 1972 campaign for U.S. Senator of Oklahoma In 1972, Clara Luper was a Oklahoma candidate for the United States Senate. When asked by the press if she, a black woman, could represent white people, she responded: ‚ÄúOf course, I can represent white people, black people, red people, yellow people, brown people, and polka dot people. You see, I have lived long enough to know that people are people.‚Äù Civic Engagement Luper taught American history for 41 years, beginning at Dunjee High School and working at other Oklahoma City schools; she retired from John Marshall High School in Oklahoma City in 1991. During the span of 1960 until 1980, Luper hosted a radio talk show, the Clara Luper Show, with her son. They would often discuss about the civil rights and the people that were instrumental. Luper‚Äôs student was influenced by her civil rights success that they strived against segregation themselves. One of her students was the first African American chief of police in Oklahoma City. Another said she was the reason he went to become a US Army Colonel. Legacy The Clara Luper Corridor, a multimillion- dollar two mile streetscape project announced by then Gov. Brad Henry connecting the Oklahoma State Capitol complex with the historically African- American area of Northeast Oklahoma City, began construction in 2005. It was named to commemorate her civil rights legacy. Luper received hundreds of awards and was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame, the Oklahoma Women's Hall of Fame, and the Oklahoma Afro-American Hall of Fame, among others. The Clara Luper Scholarship, a scholarship given by Oklahoma City University, has been awarded to a number of students every year. The scholarship is geared toward students of diverse backgrounds who have financial needs. The scholarship is meant to emphasize values that Clara Luper stood for, including community service, leadership, and education.\\"Clara Luper Scholarship\\", Oklahoma City University, Multicultural Student Affairs Luper died of natural causes on June 8, 2011. She is survived by her three children, Calvin, Marilyn Luper Hildreth, and Chelle Marie. Luper is also survived by a sister, Oneita Brown; five grandchildren; eight great-grandchildren; and one great-great- grandchild. University of Oklahoma Clara Luper Department of African & African American Studies  On March 7, 2018, University of Oklahoma President David L. Boren announced the naming of the Department of African and African American Studies in honor of longtime educator and civil rights leader Clara Luper, who made many contributions to diversity and inclusion efforts in Oklahoma. The announcement was made at the March 2018 meeting of the OU Board of Regents. ‚ÄúWe honor Clara Luper as a trailblazer for human rights and as a symbol of the university‚Äôs commitment to equal opportunity for all people,‚Äù said OU President David L. Boren. Oklahoma City Public Schools Clara Luper Center for Educational Services In 2017 the Oklahoma City Public Schools began new administrative consolidation and restoration of a mid-century modern office building, a former bank building at 615 N. Classen which became the new OKCPS Clara Luper Center for Educational Services. The building houses the administrative staff as well as outreach programs for the teachers in the district. Downtown Oklahoma City Post Office The U.S. House approved legislation September 16, 2020 to rename the downtown post office in Oklahoma City after civil rights pioneer Clara Luper. The measure passed by a voice vote and would rename the post office at 305 NW 5 St. the Clara Luper Post Office Building; that facility is currently known as the Center City Post Office. Planned OKC Clara Luper Civil Rights Center As part of the OKC MAPS project the Oklahoma City Council is planning a 20,000 square foot building with commemorative civil rights era displays. The facility will serve as a community center and will be open to local group meetings by civic groups.

Each player attempts to capture the other player's pieces by jumping over their own piece and landing on the other player's piece. The game is not related or similar to another Korean game called Five Field Kono. Although the game is often described as being medieval, this assertion does not seem to be backed by evidence. It has, however, been recorded being played from the late 19th century onwards. Goal The goal of each player is to capture the other player's pieces and reduce it to one. This is because with only one piece, a player can no longer execute a capture. Another way to win is for a player to immobilize the other player's pieces so that they cannot move or capture. Equipment The board is a 4√ó4 marble hole board. There are 16 marbles total of which 8 are black and 8 are white. Gameplay The game is played according to these rules. # Players decide what color marbles to play, and who goes first. # The board is completely filled with the 16 marbles in the beginning. Each player's marbles are set up on their half of the board. # Since the board is filled up in the beginning and hence no vacant holes, the first move by the first player will be a capturing move. A capturing move requires a player's marble to jump over one of his own adjacent marbles orthogonally (not diagonally), and to land onto an enemy marble which is then removed from the board and replaced with the player's marble. Only one marble can be used to capture or move per turn. Multiple captures are not allowed. Once a marble has captured one enemy marble, the turn is completed. Captures are not compulsory. # A marble can move orthogonally (not diagonally) one space per turn onto a vacant hole. # Players alternate their turns throughout the game.

In his youth, he and his younger brother Cheng Yi were students of Zhou Dunyi, one of the architects of Neo-Confucian cosmology. His philosophy was dualistic (between all that is tangible and all that is intangible) and pantheistic (believing that all that is intangible is the same thing, such as god, the human nature, feelings, actions (we see things acting, but not the action itself), movement (likewise), social roles and relations (likewise), chance, etc., and that such a unified, universal principle is in everything that is sensible [rather than in an external reality as in Platonism]); among his quotes are \\"outside dao there are no things and outside things there is no dao\\", \\"we call it god to emphasize the wonderful mystery of principle in ten thousand things, just as we call it lord (di) to characterize its being the ruler of events\\" and \\"in terms of the reality, it is change; in terms of principle, it is dao; in terms of its function, it is god; in terms of its destiny in a human being, it is human nature\\".\\"Cheng Hao\\" at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy Life Hao's grandfather was a county magistrate in Huangpi and died there while in that capacity. Hao's father Cheng Xiang () was still young at the time and was unable to return to Luoyang, so he was forced to grow up in Huangpi instead. He later became county magistrate (), at which time his two sons Hao and Yi were born.Huangpi Government Website (Chinese) In 1057 Hao passed the Imperial examinations and became an entered scholar. He successively served as an administrative clerk in Hu County, Shaanxi, as an administrative clerk in Shangyuan County (an area now in Nanjing), as an administrative director in Zezhou, as well as a minister of ceremony, a Censor, a tax and tariff official, a ceremony minister to the military, and various other positions. Cheng Hao and Cheng Yi were among the pioneers of Song Dynasty Neo- Confucianism, and they are often credited with its formal creation along with Zhu Xi and several other scholars. The two brothers were sometimes referred to as \\"The Two Chengs\\" (), or individually as \\"Cheng the Elder\\" () and \\"Cheng the Younger\\" (). They dealt extensively with cosmology in their studies, applying Neo-Confucian principles to their studies of celestial bodies. In particular, the brothers identified and applied the principle of Divine or Natural Order, called li, to that of Tian, the Heavens, as their original and guiding power.Cheng Yi wrote: \\"The Heavens themselves are li.\\" (). Hao established schools at Fugou and Songyang (in modern Dengfeng). Throughout his life he promoted the view that study and scholarship were means to making men sages, once writing: \\"The studies of a superior man must arrive at sagacity [sage- hood] and then upon his own intellect; in the case of not arriving at sage- hood but upon his own intellect, all is lost.\\" Hao died in 1085 at the age of fifty-three. Legacy Hao was known as an outgoing, laid-back, and lively man, in contrast to his stern and severe younger brother. As Neo- Confucianism's popularity grew throughout the early second millennium AD, the two Cheng brothers along with Zhou Dunyi, Zhang Zai, Shao Yong, and Sima Guang became known as \\"The Six Masters of Northern Song\\" for their philosophical contributions. Hao also received several posthumous titles: in 1220 he was given the posthumous name \\"Lord of Purity\\" () by the emperor. In 1241 he was given the posthumous title of \\"Bo [Earl] of Henan\\". In 1330, an imperial decree made Hao the posthumous \\"Lord of Yu Kingdom [Henan]\\".

Harmukh is part of the Himalaya Range and is located between Nallah Sindh in the south and Kishanganga River in the north, rising above Gangabal Lake in the vicinity of Kashmir valley. It is mostly climbed from the northwestern side of Arin, Kudara Bandipore. Religious beliefs Harmukh, with Gangbal Lake at its foot, is considered a sacred mountain by Hindus. It is also known as 'Kailash of Kashmir' According to Kashmiri Hindus theology, Harmukh is the abode of Lord Shiva. According to the legend of \\"Hurmukhuk Gosoni\\"Some Marvels of Kashmir Once a hermit tried to reach the summit of Harmukh to see Lord Shiva face to face. For twelve long years, he tried to scale the summit but failed until one day he saw a Gujar descending the summit. When the Gujar approached him, the hermit enquired as to what he had seen there. The Gujar said he had been searching for a stray goat, and that while searching he saw a couple milking a cow and drinking the milk from a human skull. The couple had offered him some milk, which he refused to drink; when they departed they rubbed a little of the milk on his forehead. When the Gujar indicated the spot where the milk was rubbed, the hermit was extremely joyful and rushed to lick his forehead. It is said that the hermit attained nirvana and disappeared from the place to the complete surprise of the Gujar.  Harmukh Gangbal Yatra  This pilgrimage takes place every year on the eve of Ganga Ashtami. The yatris begin their yatra from Naranag. Geographical setting Harmukh lies in the northwestern Himalayan Range. The Karakoram Range borders it on the north and the Kashmir Valley on the south. Melt waters from glaciers form Gangabal Lake which lies at its foot to the north east side and contribute significantly to the regional fresh- water supply, supporting irrigation through Nallah Sindh. This Himalayan Range lies along the southern edge of the Eurasian tectonic plate and is made up of ancient sedimentary rocks (more than 390 million years old). Those strata were folded and thrust-faulted, and granite masses were intruded, when the Indian plate collided with Eurasia, beginning more than 100 million years ago. It is notable for its local relief as it is a consistently steep pyramid, dropping sharply to the east and south, with the eastern slope the steepest. Climbing history Harmukh was first climbed by members of the Great Trigonometric Survey led by Thomas Montgomerie in 1856. Montgomerie made the first survey of the Karakoram some to the north, and sketched the two most prominent peaks, labeling them K1 and K2. The policy of the Great Trigonometric Survey was to use local names for mountains wherever possibleThe most obvious exception to this policy was Mount Everest, where the local name Chomolungma was probably known, but ignored in order to pay tribute to George Everest. See Curran, p. 29-30. and K1 was found to be known locally as Masherbrum. K2, however, appeared not to have acquired a local name, possibly due to its remoteness. The mountain is not visible from Askole, the last village to the south, or from the nearest habitation to the north, and is only fleetingly glimpsed from the end of the Baltoro Glacier, beyond which few local people would have ventured.Curran, p. 30 Therefore, Harmukh is the mountain from which the world's second-highest mountain peak, K2, was discovered and the name given it by the Survey, K2, continues to be used. Climbing routes The easiest route among the different routes of Harmukh is via Arin Bandipore, 47 km motorable road from Srinagar to Arin and 18 kilometers of high altitude alpine trek leads to the base of Harmukh. Another trek leads from Naranag to the base of Harmukh at Gangabal Lake, but it is a steep climb at some places.

The city of Fairbanks, Alaska saw high water levels, while the towns of Nenana, Salcha, and Old Minto received heavy damage. The Salcha River and Tanana River reached their second-highest levels since record-keeping began (the highest was during the 1967 Tanana Valley Flood), while the Chena River, which bisects Fairbanks, was kept below flood stage by the use of the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project. Several hundred homes were inundated by the flood in Fairbanks, Salcha, unincorporated Fairbanks North Star Borough, Nenana, and smaller villages, but due to early warnings from the National Weather Service, volunteer fire departments, and the borough's emergency contact system, no one was injured. The area affected by the flood was declared a state disaster area, making residents whose homes were flooded eligible for state aid. The long-term effects of the flood, including its effect on the salmon spawning season, are as yet unknown.

Fairbanks  The first effects of the flood began to be felt in Fairbanks late on the 29th, as the Tanana River overflowed its banks and covered low-lying areas of South Fairbanks. Thought was given on that date to closing the floodgates of the Moose Creek Dam, located on the Chena River as part of the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project, but the Chena's rise was not as rapid as that of the Tanana, which lies to the south of the town, and no action was taken on the 29th. Engineers also considered lowering the gates on the 30th, but the flow of the Chena River had not reached a level where computer models mandated the closing of the gates to protect Fairbanks. A Fairbanks shooting range is closed due to flooding. The Tanana River, which is not controlled by the flood project, meanwhile reached a crest of 26.60 feet at Fairbanks on the 30th.See chart. This amount was more than two feet above flood stage and was the highest level seen since August 1967, when the river crested at during the great 1967 Fairbanks flood.Historical crests for the Tanana River at Fairbanks National Weather Service, Accessed August 4, 2008. The height of the water caused flooding in the Rosie Creek and Chena Pump neighborhoods west of Fairbanks, and caused some residents to evacuate. Residents who remained were placed under a boil-water order for fear that floodwater had contaminated the public drinking water system. In response to the continuing spread of the flood, Fairbanks and Fairbanks North Star Borough authorities opened an emergency operations center to handle the response to the flood and answer residents' questions. Residents of the Rosie Creek neighborhood were awakened in the early morning hours of the 31st by borough warnings and volunteer firefighters, who instructed them to evacuate. High water had surrounded the residents' homes, causing many to flee to a shelter set up at a nearby elementary school. No residents were injured in the evacuation, something many of them credited to prompt and efficient warnings.Smetzer, Mary Beth. \\"Chena- Goldstream firehouse draws a crowd of evacuees, residents for emergency meeting \\", Fairbanks Daily News Miner, August 1, 2008. Accessed August 4, 2008. The continued high water of the Tanana River caused overflow to flood into the nearby Chena, normally a tributary of the Tanana. Despite that unusual flow, engineers at the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project decided not to close the project's floodgates, forecasting that the Chena would not rise above flood stage, even with the increased flow. By the morning of August 1, the Tanana River had begun to fall in Fairbanks, just as the Salcha River had begun to recede in Salcha. Though isolated roads continued to wash out from heavy water flow and residents were not allowed to return to their homes, the water level of the river continued to fall.

Nenana  Though Nenana also received heavy rain from the storm system that began the flood, its position further downstream on the Tanana River meant that it did not receive the first effects of the flood until the 30th, when Alaska Railroad officials suspended operations south of Nenana due to track damage caused by rising water. The Tanana River overflows its banks during the flood. On July 31, the Tanana River began to overflow its banks in Nenana. Water flooded the rails of the Alaska Railroad in town, caused an evacuation of the town's clinic, and flooded low-lying areas throughout the town. By August 1, the entire town was at least partially flooded, with most basements and other low-lying areas being completely filled by floodwater. The flooding of the Alaska Railroad track in town forced a halt to all passenger and freight operations between Anchorage and Fairbanks, effectively cutting off Fairbanks from rail traffic. On August 2, the Tanana River at Nenana crested at 14.64 feet. This total was more than four feet above flood stage and was the third-highest water level ever recorded, falling short of a 15.9-foot mark in 1948 and the record 18.9-foot mark recorded during the flood of 1967.Historical crests for Tanana River at Nenana National Weather Service, Accessed August 4, 2008.

Undertaken by the Chinese Academy of Science, the telescope is planned to conduct a 5-year spectroscopic survey of 10 million Milky Way stars, as well as millions of galaxies. The project's budget is RMB 235 million yuan. Optics LAMOST is configured as a reflective Schmidt telescope with active optics. There are two mirrors, each made up of a number of 1.1-metre (p-p) hexagonal deformable segments. The first mirror, MA (24 segments, fitting in a 5.72√ó4.4 m rectangle) is a Schmidt corrector plate in a dome at ground level. The almost- flat mirror MA reflects the light to the south, up a large slanted tunnel (25¬∞ above horizontal) to the larger spherical focusing mirror MB (37 segments, fitting in a 6.67√ó6.09 m rectangle). This directs light to a focal plane 1.75 metres in diameter corresponding to a five-degree field of view. The focal plane is tiled with 4000 fibre-positioning units, each feeding an optical fibre which transfers light to one of sixteen 250-channel spectrographs below. Looking at the image opposite, MB is at the top of the left-hand supporting column of the tower, MA is in the left of the two domes at the right of the image (the rightmost, grey dome is an unrelated telescope), and the spectrographs are inside the right-hand column of the tower. Each spectrograph has two 4k√ó4k CCD cameras, using e2v CCD chips, with 'blue' (370‚Äì590 nm) and 'red' (570‚Äì900 nm) sides; the telescope can also be used in a higher spectral resolution mode where the range is 510‚Äì540 and 830‚Äì890 nm. Using active optics technique to control its reflecting corrector makes it a unique astronomical instrument in combining large aperture with wide field of view. The available large focal plane may accommodate up to thousands of fibers, by which the collected light of distant and faint celestial objects down to 20.5 magnitude is fed into the spectrographs, promising a very high spectrum acquiring rate of ten-thousands of spectra per night. Scientific goals The telescope is to conduct a wide-field survey, called the \\"LAMOST Experiment for Galactic Understanding and Evolution,\\" or LEGUE. Particular scientific goals of the LAMOST include: * An extra-galactic spectroscopic survey to shed light on the large scale structure of the universe * A stellar spectroscopic survey, including a search for metal-poor stars in the galactic halo, to provide information on the structure of our Galaxy * Cross-identification of multi- waveband surveys It is also hoped that the vast volume of data produced will lead to additional serendipitous discoveries. Early commissioning observations have been able to confirm spectroscopically a new method of identifying quasars based on their infrared color. An overarching goal of the telescope is to bring Chinese astronomy into the 21st century, taking a leading role in wide-field spectroscopy and in the fields of large-scale and large-sample astronomy and astrophysics. Early results A 2011 conference presentation suggests that there was initially a problem with accuracy of the fibre positioners causing poor throughput, but that this was rectified by adding another calibration step. The same presentation also points out that the telescope's location, only NW of Beijing, is far from ideal, being in an area with high levels of both atmospheric and light pollution. The telescope has generally been disappointing, with the site receiving only 120 clear nights per year.

On November 14, 1929, at 88 Harriet died quietly at her home in Methuen, Massachusetts, after a lengthy illness, the last twelve months almost entirely at her estate. It is said her death was hastened by that of her beloved chauffeur John G Kilmurray who was struck by a drunk driver on Christmas eve of 1928 while delivering Mrs. Nevins' Yuletide remembrances. In her will, Mrs. Nevins left money to all her favorite organizations, including the Animal League of Boston, the Red Acre Farm of Stow, and the Ladies Union Charitable Society which operated the Lawrence General Hospital. She also left $2,500 to both towns of Methuen and Walpole to fund the construction of fountains for horses and dogs; the bowl of the Methuen fountain remains in the Methuen Square and is used as a planter and the Walpole fountain is now dry but still stands on School Street opposite the old Stone School (now Walpole Town Hall).

Built at the Garford Truck factory and designed by the Monahan Vehicle Company, Providence, R. I., Mrs Nevins commissioned it when after \\"witnessing the removal of an injured horse in one of the society‚Äôs horse-drawn ambulances [she] decided that a more effective method of transferring injured equines might be perfected.\\" Constructed on a Garford one-ton-truck chassis, it had a four-cylinder engine, pneumatic front tires and solid rear tires, as well as headlamps and adjustable lamps of the type found on fire engines. The cab was fitted with a glass windshield and side curtains completely enclosing the driver. The ambulance was a trailer with floor inclined towards the rear, allowing the entrance to be near to the ground, with the loading gate forming a ramp. The body was equipped with top and side curtains to give protection from bad weather. The cost is estimated to have been about $5,000. Nevins Farm Nevins Farm before Harriet Nevins donated it to the MSPCA In 1917, Harriet Nevins donated the rolling pastures of her farm to the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals so that it could be used as a rest home for horses and other unwanted or abandoned animals.

Nevins Farm: About Us First known as \\"The Rest Home\\", the property was used for retired police horses and for other horses who worked on the then-cobblestone streets of Boston. Arrangements made with horse owners allowed horses that were still working animals to spend time grazing and relaxing in the pastures. A common agreement was one in which horses would rotate between spending a month on the farm and a month in Boston working. Now known as Nevins Farm and Equine Center, the farm is still operated by the MSPCA-Angell and is the only open-door horse and farm animal rescue center in New England. Part of the property is devoted to the Hillside Acre Animal Cemetery, a pet cemetery of landscaped hillside surround by a tall iron fence. Nevins Memorial Library The Nevins Memorial Library was built in 1883 as gift from the Nevins family to the City of Methuen to honor David Nevins, Sr., Harriet Nevins' father-in-law. For many years Mrs. Nevins was the chairman of the Library's Board of Trustees, repeatedly giving gifts of funds to expand the collection. From 1908's Genealogical and Personal Memoirs Relating to the Families of Boston and Eastern Massachusetts: > Mrs. David Nevins, Jr., now the only surviving member of the family, has > been especially generous in gifts of books, paintings, statuary and various > specimens of the fine arts. Although the endowment of the library is > sufficient for its maintenance without the aid of public funds, Mrs. Nevins > has increased its value and usefulness by her contributions. The public > spirit and generosity of the Nevins family seems to have no bounds in the > town in which they made their home. In 1917 Mrs. Nevins purchased the house next to the library at 299 Broadway which had been assessed at $500; she transferred the house and land to the Nevins Memorial Library the following year. The house became for many years the home of the Methuen Historical Commission. The original building was razed in 1999 and the historical collection moved to the basement of the Masonic Lodge for storage until a more permanent facility can be located. The Nevins Memorial Library was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The library is the custodian of the Nevins Memorial Library Historic Collection, much of which is in storage and for which viewing appointments should be made. The collection includes manuscripts and printed materials, family history resources, vital records, assorted objets d'art and collectables, life-sized portraits of Nevins family members, and the stained- glass windows of the library itself. Nevins Memorial Library Historic Collection Blackburn Hall Blackburn Hall in Walpole, Massachusetts was built by Harriet Nevins as a memorial to her parents. In her 1929 will, Mrs. Nevins donated $50,000 for the erection of a public building in Walpole, Massachusetts as a memorial to her parents, as her father had once lived and done business in Walpole. Blackburn Memorial Building (more commonly known as \\"Blackburn Hall\\") was designed by the architectural firm of Putnam & Cox Company of Boston, built by the F.J. Tetreault Company of Walpole, and dedicated in 1932. The red brick building, which features a neo-classical fa√ßade with whitewashed columns, is still owned by the Town of Walpole and is used for a variety of activities throughout the year including children's theater productions.

The group consists of faujasite-Na, faujasite-Mg and faujasite-Ca. They all share the same basic formula by varying the amounts of sodium, magnesium and calcium.The Faujasite group on Mindat It occurs as a rare mineral in several locations worldwide and is also synthesized industrially. Discovery and occurrence Faujasite was first described in 1842 for an occurrence in the Limberg Quarries, Sasbach, Kaiserstuhl, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany. The sodium modifier faujasite-Na was added following the discovery of the magnesium and calcium rich phases in the 1990s. It was named for Barth√©lemy Faujas de Saint- Fond (1741‚Äì1819), French geologist and volcanologist. Faujasite occurs in vesicles within basalt and phonolite lava and tuff as an alteration or authigenic mineral. It occurs with other zeolites, olivine, augite and nepheline. Structure The structure of the faujasite frameworkStructure of aluminosilicate cage in faujesite. Vertices are occupied by aluminium or silicon, the connecting struts are occupied by oxides.The faujasite framework has been attribute the FAU code by the International Zeolite Association. It consists of sodalite cages which are connected through hexagonal prisms. The pore, which is formed by a 12-membered ring, has a relatively large diameter of 7.4 √Ö. The inner cavity has a diameter of 12 √Ö and is surrounded by 10 sodalite cages. The unit cell is cubic; Pearson symbol cF576, symmetry Fd _3_ m, No.227, lattice constant 24.7 √Ö. Zeolite Y has a void fraction of 48% and a Si/Al ratio of 2.43. It thermally decomposes at 793 ¬∞C.The Chemical Engineering Zeolite Page Synthesis Faujasite is synthesized, as are other zeolites, from alumina sources such as sodium aluminate and silica sources such as sodium silicate. Other alumosilicates such as kaolin are used as well. The ingredients are dissolved in a basic environment such as sodium hydroxide aqueous solution and crystallized at 70 to 300 ¬∞C (usually at 100 ¬∞C). After crystallization the faujasite is in its sodium form and must be ion exchanged with ammonium to improve stability. The ammonium ion is removed later by calcination which renders the zeolite in its acid form. Depending on the silica-to-alumina ratio of their framework, synthetic faujasite zeolites are divided into X and Y zeolites. In X zeolites that ratio is between 2 and 3, while in Y zeolites it is 3 or higher. The negative charges of the framework are balanced by the positive charges of cations in non-framework positions. Such zeolites have ion-exchange, catalytic and adsorptive properties. The stability of the zeolite increases with the silica-to-alumina ratio of the framework. It is also affected by the type and amount of cations located in non-framework positions. For catalytic cracking, the Y zeolite is often used in a rare earth-hydrogen exchanged form. By using thermal, hydrothermal or chemical methods, some of the alumina can be removed from the Y zeolite framework, resulting in high-silica Y zeolites. Such zeolites are used in cracking and hydrocracking catalysts. Complete dealumination results in faujasite-silica. Use Faujasite is used above all as a catalyst in fluid catalytic cracking to convert high-boiling fractions of petroleum crude to more valuable gasoline, diesel and other products. Zeolite Y has superseded zeolite X in this use because it is both more active and more stable at high temperatures due to the higher Si/Al ratio. It is also used in the hydrocracking units as a platinum/palladium support to increase aromatic content of reformulated refinery products. Type X zeolite can be used to selectively adsorb CO2 from gas streams and is used in the prepurification of air for industrial air separation.

When these unelected members were removed in 1999 after the first democratic elections following the fall of Suharto, several regional representatives' led by Oesman Sapta, tried to reestablish the Regional Representatives Faction. The members of this faction took the view that the elected Regional Representatives Council, which replaced the unelected members of the People's Consultative Assembly, would not be effective as it was too small. They therefore decided to establish a political party to represent the interests of the regions. In the 2004 legislative elections, the party won 0.6% of the popular vote and no seats in the People's Representative Council.

The medieval town of Scone, which grew up around the monastery and royal residence, was abandoned in the early 19th century when the residents were removed and a new palace was built on the site by the Earl of Mansfield. Hence the modern village of Scone, and the medieval village of Old Scone, can often be distinguished. Both sites lie in the historical province of Gowrie, as well as the old county of Perthshire. Old Scone was the historic capital of the Kingdom of Scotland. In the Middle Ages it was an important royal centre, used as a royal residence and as the coronation site of the kingdom's monarchs. Around the royal site grew the town of Perth and the Abbey of Scone. Scone and Scotland Seal of Scone Abbey, depicting the inauguration of King Alexander III of Scotland Kings of Scots. This MS illustration depicts the coronation of King Alexander III of Scotland on Moot Hill, Scone. He is being greeted by the ', the royal poet, who is addressing him with the proclamation \\"Benach De Re Albanne\\" (= ', \\"God Bless the King of Scotland\\"); the poet goes on to recite Alexander's genealogy. Scone's association with kings and king-making gave it various epithets in Gaelic poetry; for instance, Scoine sciath-airde, \\"Scone of the High Shields\\", and ', \\"Scone of the Noisy Shields\\".Skene (1867), pp. 84, 97. Scotland itself was often called or shown on maps as the \\"Kingdom of Scone\\" (or \\"Sconiana\\"), '.Skene (1867), p. 21. Similarly, Ireland was often called the \\"Kingdom of Tara\\"; Tara, like Scone, was a ceremonial inauguration site.See, for instance, Skene (1868‚Äì70), p. 88. Scone was therefore the closest thing the early Kingdom of Scotland had to a capital city. In either 1163 or 1164 King Malcolm IV described Scone Abbey as ', \\"in the principal seat of our kingdom\\".Barrow (1960), no. 243. By this point, however, the rule of the King of the Scots was not confined to the Kingdom of Scotland, which then only referred to Scotland north of the river Forth. The king also ruled in Lothian, Strathclyde and the Honour of Huntingdon, and spent much of his time in these localities too. Moreover, the king was itinerant and had little permanent bureaucracy, so Scone's role was totally unlike that of a modern capital city. But in the medieval sense Scone can in many ways be called the \\"capital of Scotland\\", and was often referred to as \\"the Royal City of Scone\\". Many comparisons can be drawn between the City of Westminster and the \\"City\\" of Scone. Both were medieval centres of royal power. Both were located beside crossing points of major rivers ‚Äì the highways of the medieval period ‚Äì and in geographic locations central to their respective kingdoms. The origins of a settlement of any kind at Scone are unknown, although thought to be early medieval. The origins could be pre-Roman, as there is much evidence of a well- established and sophisticated Iron Age people flourishing in this part of Scotland. Direct evidence however is lacking and so Scone's story is thought to begin in the wake of the Roman exit from Scottish history. Thus there may have been a village, a religious centre, or even a seat of power based at Scone from as early as the 5th century AD, with Scone coming into real and recorded prominence in the 9th century during the amalgamation of the Pictish and Gaelic peoples and kingdoms. Scone at this point played a crucial role in the formation and governance of the ancient Kingdom of Scotland. In the 9th century Kenneth MacAlpin came east to Scone, bringing with him a holy relic and coronation stone. As the stone was kept at Scone, it acquired the name, the Stone of Scone. In the 12th century, various foreign influences prompted the Scottish kings to transform Scone into a more convincing royal centre. Many historians have argued that the monastery or priory was founded specifically in 1114 by Alexander I of Scotland. This is strictly speaking correct, but it seems clear that this charter was simply a reaffirmation of Scone's status, and of the religious institutions there, rather than a sudden founding or establishment. There is growing evidence that there had been an early Christian cult called the Culdees based at Scone dating from at least the 9th century and possibly earlier. The Culdees were eventually merged with the Augustinian canons who arrived from Nostell Priory in Yorkshire as part of the 1114 \\"re-establishment\\". This \\"re-establishment\\" and drive to confirm Scone's status at the heart of the emerging Scottish kingdom and nation continued in 1124 when Alexander I of Scotland wrote to \\"all merchants of England\\" (') promising them safe passage and protection if they bring goods to Scone by sea to trade.Lawrie (1905), p. 43. Scone at this time lay on a navigable part of the river Tay. This was at times a major disadvantage, as the Vikings came across the North Sea to launch their lightning raids. Using the River Tay as a water route into the heart of Scottish held territory throughout the 9th and 10th centuries, these raiders pillaged towns and villages as well as religious houses such as the abbey at Dunkeld. In 904 a battle was fought in the vicinity of Scone, often referred to as the Battle of Scone, between the Scots led by King Constantine II of Scotland and the Vikings. As time went on, for various reasons the river by Scone became less navigable. At the same time ships were developing deeper hulls. It was this combination of factors that encouraged David I of Scotland to establish a new burgh at the nearest suitable location downstream of Scone, namely Perth.Spearman (1988), p. 47; Lawrie (1905), p.296. Perth lies from the site of medieval Scone, which is similar to the distance of Westminster Abbey from the City of London: . King Alexander I, thus \\"re-established\\" an Augustinian priory at Scone sometime between 1114 and 1122. In either 1163 or 1164, in the reign of King M√°el Coluim IV, Scone Priory's status was enhanced and it became an abbey.Cowan & Easson (1976), pp. 97‚Äì98. The abbey had important royal functions, being next to the coronation site of Scottish kings and housing the coronation stone, the Stone of Scone, until King Edward I of England) stole it during the Wars of Scottish Independence in 1295. Like other Scottish abbeys, Scone probably doubled up as a royal residence or palace as well as a hunting ground. Scone Abbey's obvious role was like that of Westminster Abbey for the Kings of England, although it appears that Scottish coronations were a more pagan ceremony, including the use of the Moot Hill (the coronation mound). It is likely that Scottish inaugurations and coronations were completed in two parts: a Christian ceremony conducted within the Abbey church and the perceivably pagan (Gaelic) ceremony upon the Moot Hill. This can be attributed, as Thomas Owen Clancy points out, to the importance in Gaelic tradition of swearing the inauguration oath ', on the traditional mound; the importance of which continental Christian fashions were apparently unable to overcome.Clancy (2003), p. 103. But the parallel with Westminster certainly existed in the mind of Edward I, who in 1297 transferred the Abbey's coronation relics, the crown, sceptre and the stone, to Westminster in an overt act of stripping Scotland of her nationhood. Scotland's national relics and regalia were made in a formal presentation to the English royal saint, Edward the Confessor.Barrow (2003), p. 201. Traditional coronation site Stone of Scone in the Coronation Chair at Westminster Abbey, 1855 \\"Moot hill\\" and its chapel today Like Tara, Scone would have been associated with some of the traditions and rituals of native kingship, what D. A. Binchy describes as \\"an archaic fertility rite of a type associated with primitive kingship the world over\\".Binchy (1958), p. 134. Certainly, if Scone was not associated with this kind of thing in Pictish times, the Scottish kings of later years made an effort do so. By the thirteenth century at the latest there was a tradition that Scone's famous inauguration stone, the Stone of Scone, had originally been placed at Tara by Sim√≥n Brecc, and only taken to Scone later by his descendant Fergus mac Ferchair when the latter conquered Scotland.Broun (2003), p. 194. Indeed, the prominence of such a coronation stone associated with an archaic inauguration site was something Scone shared with many like sites in medieval Ireland, not just Tara.See FitzPatrick (2003). Such \\"unchristian\\" rites would become infamous in the emerging world of Scotland's Anglo-French neighbours in the twelfth century.e.g. O'Meara (1951), p. 110. Scone's role therefore came under threat as Scotland's twelfth century kings gradually became more French and less Gaelic. Walter of Coventry reported in the reign of William I of Scotland that \\"The modern kings of Scotland count themselves as Frenchmen, in race, manners, language and culture; they keep only Frenchmen in their household and following, and have reduced the Scots to utter servitude.\\"Stubbs (1872), p. 206. Though exaggerated, there was truth in this. Apparently for this reason, when the Normanized David I of Scotland (') went to Scone to be crowned there in the summer of 1124, he initially refused to take part in the ceremonies. According to Ailred of Rievaulx, friend and one time member of David's court, David \\"so abhorred those acts of homage which are offered by the Scottish nation in the manner of their fathers upon the recent promotion of their kings, that he was with difficulty compelled by the bishops to receive them\\".Anderson (1908), p. 232; Ailred was keen to portray David as a good Anglo-Norman, and was anxious to relieve David of anti-Scottish prejudice being made to debase his image in the Anglo-Norman world. Inevitably then this was bound to affect the significance of Scone as a ritual and cult centre, yet the inauguration ceremony was preserved with only some innovation through the thirteenth centuryBannerman (1989); for some of the innovations, see Duncan (2003). and Scottish kings continued to be crowned there until 1651, when Charles II became the last King of Scotland to have a coronation there (see List of Scottish monarchs).James II of Scotland was not crowned there, but at Holyrood Abbey; he was however a child, and there were political problems which made Scone too dangerous. His son James III of Scotland, who succeeded as a child also, was not apparently crowned there either; however, these coronations did not reverse the ancient precedent, which was \\"revived\\" by James IV of Scotland. Moreover, until the later Middle Ages kings continued to reside there, and parliaments, often some of the most important parliaments in Scottish history, frequently met there too.See McNeill & MacQueen (1996), pp. 159‚Äì182, for places of charter issue. In 2007, archaeologists discovered the footprint of the medieval abbey allowing us to envisage where the high altar was and thus where relics such as the Stone of Scone or Stone of Destiny were housed, and where Kings of Scots such as Macbeth and Robert the Bruce were crowned before heading up to the Moot Hill for the more pagan elements of their inaugurations. Later history Scone mercat cross, today almost all that is left of the old village Although Scone retained its role in royal inaugurations, Scone's role as effective \\"capital\\" declined in the later Middle Ages. The abbey itself though enjoyed mixed fortunes. It suffered a fire in the twelfth century and was subject to extensive attacks during the First War of Scottish Independence including the theft of Scotland's most revered relic, the Stone of Scone. It also suffered, as most Scottish abbeys in the period did, from a decline in patronage. The abbey became a popular place of pilgrimage for St Fergus, whose skull the Abbots kept as a relic in a silver casket by the altar. The Abbey and village also retained older festivals such as the famous Ba' of Scone, a medieval game similar to football; Ba' being short for \\"ball\\". Despite Scone's decline throughout the late medieval period, it gained some considerable fame for musical excellence through the composer Robert Carver.Fawcett (2003), pp. 170‚Äì172. In the sixteenth century the Scottish Reformation ended the importance of all monasteries and abbeys in Scotland. In June 1559 the abbey was attacked by a reformist mob from Dundee having been whipped up into a frenzy by the great reformer John Knox. The abbey was severely damaged during this attack despite Knox's apparent efforts to calm the mob. Some of the canons continued on at the abbey and there is evidence suggesting that the spire of the abbey church was repaired in the aftermath of the reformation. Monastic life at Scone persisted until about 1640 at which point the Monks of Scone finally dispersed, religious life continuing to function only as part of the parish church in Scone. In 1581 Scone was placed in the new Earldom of Gowrie, created for William Ruthven. The latter was forfeited after the Gowrie Conspiracy of 1600 in which the Ruthvens made an attempt against King James VI's life. As a consequence of the Ruthven's failure and demise, Scone, in 1606 was given to David Murray of Gospertie, newly created Lord Scone, who in 1621 was promoted to Viscount Stormont. Within the parish Bessie Wright was a healer and an accused witch. The abbey/palace evidently remained in a decent state, as the Viscounts apparently did some rebuilding and continued to reside there, and it continued to play host to important guests, such as King Charles II, when he was crowned there in 1651. It is said that there is over 1000 years of significant Scottish history at Scone. The Murrays of Scone were Jacobite, and along with their Atholl cousins were strong supporters of the exiled Stuart Monarchs of Great Britain and Ireland. This support for the Jacobites, plus Scone's status in Scottish history no doubt encouraged the Old Pretender, James III of Great Britain and Ireland, to use the Palace of Scone as his base in Scotland during the 1715 rebellion. James III having landed in Scotland on 22 December 1715, he proceeded to Perth and onto Scone which had been garrisoned by the Jacobites. James attempted to rally his supporters by releasing from Scone six Royal Proclamations. Having spent six weeks in residence at Scone, James and the Jacobite army marched (retreated) north on 30 January to Montrose. The rebellion having failed really before James had even arrived, he boarded a ship on 31 January leaving Scotland never to return. the Old Pretender was not the last Jacobite to visit Scone, his son the famed Bonnie Prince Charlie stayed the night at Palace of Scone during the 1745 rebellion. It was not until 1803 that the family, the Murrays of Scone (by then the Earls of Mansfield), began constructing another palace at the cost of ¬£70,000, commissioning the renowned English architect William Atkinson.Fawcett (2003), pp. 172‚Äì174. The new Neo-Gothic palace was completed in 1812 and had 120 rooms in total. Queen Victoria, during her 1842 jubilee tour, visited Scone staying in the Palace for just one night. At the Disruption of 1843 the Free Church of Scotland worshipped at Pictstonshill barn. A church and school were built in 1844 despite being refused local building materials. Notable ministers included the Rev Charles Calder Stewart (1804-1876) who served from 1847 to 1873 and was succeeded by the Rev A. K. Macmurchy. A new Free Church was built in 1887.Ewing, William Annals of the Free Church Modern town Constructing the new palace meant destroying the old town and moving its inhabitants to a new settlement. The new village was built in 1805 as a planned village (compare Evanton, built in 1807 by its landowner for similar motives), and originally called New Scone. It is east of the old location and further from Perth.Compare geo.ed.ac.uk ‚Äì Old Scone and geo.ed.ac.uk ‚Äì New Scone. Until 1997 the village was called \\"New Scone\\", but is now officially called Scone (see signposts on all approaches to the village). The village had 4,430 inhabitants according to the 2001 Census for Scotland, 84.33% of whom are Scottish; it is demographically old even compared with the rest of Scotland. Trivia Scone is mentioned in William Shakespeare's tragedy Macbeth (Act 2, Scene 4), as a place for coronation of Macbeth after he kills the previous King, his cousin Duncan. It is also the last word of the play: \\"So, thanks to all at once and to each one / Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.\\" See also * Abbot of Scone * Hill of Tara * Perth, Scotland * Scone Abbey * Scone Aerodrome ‚Äì Perth Airport (Scotland) * Scone Palace * Scotland in the High Middle ages Notes=References       External links * Scone Airport Website Category:Archaeological sites in Perth and Kinross Category:Medieval Scotland Category:Villages in Perth and Kinross ","title":"Scone, Scotland"},{"id":"18699542","text":"Irus elegans is a bivalve mollusc of the family Veneridae.

History  Michael Garner (keys, vocals), Matt Frankel (percussion, vocals) and Dan Chang (guitar, vocals) met at UCLA in 2005 while singing together in the premiere collegiate music group Awaken A Cappella. In 2006, under the name of Mikey G and Dan from Danville, Michael and Dan took part as a duo in UCLA's Spring Sing talent competition, the school's oldest music tradition, where they won with their song ‚ÄúCast Away‚Äù for Best Duet and Best Overall Entry. Past winners have included Sara Bareilles and Tyrone Wells. In the beginning of 2007, the duo sought out Matthew Frankel, ultimately leading to the inception of Lady Danville. In the fall of 2007, Lady Danville won the annual Star 98.7 Lounge Contest with their song ‚ÄúTired Magician‚Äù and was featured on the Star Lounge Compilation CD with artists including John Mayer, Maroon 5 and Pink. In December 2007, the group released their first self-titled EP \\"Lady Danville\\" which can be found on iTunes and Amazon. The band spent 2008 establishing themselves in the Los Angeles area at venues such as The Troubadour, Viper Room, Hotel Caf√©, and The El Rey before going on tour in the Pacific Northwest in 2009 and the entire West Coast in 2010 with the bands Until June and The Fold. In March 2010, Lady Danville wrapped up their West Coast Tour and headed to Austin, TX where they played at the official SXSW 2010 Showcase with a total of five shows in three days. In April 2010, they kicked off their East Coast tour with Jack's Mannequin. Additionally, Lady Danville did a benefit concert at Annandale High School solely for class of 2011 in late October 2010 whilst touring the east coast. Other accolades include the prominent feature of their song ‚ÄúCast Away‚Äú on a recent episode of MTV's The Real World: Washington DC as well as ‚ÄúLove to Love‚Äù on E!‚Äôs Keeping up with the Kardashians and MTV's The Real World: New Orleans. Furthermore, their music has been consistently featured on Dorm Life, Hulu‚Äôs most watched web show, as well as on the acclaimed independent documentary Craigslist Joe. They have also earned tremendous praise from media outlets as diverse as LA Weekly, LAist.com, and Billboard.com. In November 2010, Lady Danville finished the Lonely Avenue tour with Ben Folds. In January 2011, the band went on tour with Dashboard Confessional, and Chris Conley of Saves the Day for the west coast leg of the 10th Year Anniversary of Dashboard Confessionals debut album The Swiss Army Romance. Due to one of their main members leaving the band and the name of the band changing, they have officially become a new band and Lady Danville now ceases to exist.

Out of respect for him and his contribution, we will be announcing a change in our band name shortly.\\" They also announced that their first and only full-length album was to be released on February 12, 2013, but that never ended up happening, at least under the Lady Danville name.  Hunter Hunted  Because of the band breakup and band name change from Lady Danville to Hunter Hunted, the full-length album was never released. Instead, Hunter Hunted released a self-titled EP consisting of 5 tracks, including \\"Operating\\" which had already been performed many times as Lady Danville. The band is fronted by Michael Garner and Dan Chang, but consists of a total of 6 band members, including Blake Straus. They toured between February and July 2013, promoting their new EP. In that time, they released a music video for \\"End of the World,\\" occupied a residency at the Bootleg Theatre for the month of March, appeared on Conan, and charted #1 on Billboard's Next Big Sound Chart.

Lewis and starring Joseph Cotten. The film's sets were designed by the art director David S. Garber. It was shot partly at the Corriganville Movie Ranch. Plot Clay Halliday meets up with his estranged brother Daniel to tell him that their father, Big Dan, is dying and that Clay is engaged to Aleta Burris. Daniel is surprised to hear that their father would give his blessing to the engagement. When they return to the ranch, there are obvious sparks between Daniel and Aleta. Before he enters his father's room, Daniel has a flashback remembering the time before they became estranged. His father is a lawman. He finds out that his daughter, Martha, is in love with Jivaro Burris (Aleta's brother), a half-breed who works on the Halliday ranch. Big Dan orders Jivaro off the ranch. When a rider is attacked and killed, Jivaro is also attacked as he happened to be riding in the vicinity. Big Dan arrests Jivaro and puts him in jail. Big Dan leaves with a posse to hunt down the rest of the suspected attackers despite a plea from Daniel to, leaving his son Clay as the only deputy to guard Jivaro despite an angry mob outside the jail. Daniel and Clay try to help Jivaro escape but the mob enters and he is lynched. Daniel leaves the ranch vowing never to return and goes to Aleta's home to say goodbye. Her father, Chad Burris, overhears Daniel and Aleta saying that they should not tell him about Big Dan's role in the lynching. Big Dan and Clay go to the Burris ranch. A face-off between Big Dan and Mr. Burris occurs with Big Dan killing Burris. After the funeral for both Burris men, Daniel again leaves. Martha brings Aleta to the Halliday ranch to recover from an illness following the burials. Clay begins to fall in love with Aleta. Several unusual events happen to the Halliday ranch, all caused by Daniel, including a stampede of Halliday's cattle. Big Dan forms a posse to hunt for Daniel, who he knows is behind the stampede. Big Dan finds a noose hanging inside his house, sets fire to a barn, and writes a threatening note about getting rid of Big Dan as a lawman. Daniel who is hiding in the shadows when the barn burns meets up with Aleta and they embrace for the first time. Aleta tells him that Daniel is becoming like his father. The townsfolk ask Big Dan to hand in his badge, but he refuses. Daniel confronts his father and they brawl with Daniel coming out on top. We learn that six months have passed. Daniel flashes forward and enters Big Dan's room where he tells him he is glad that things have changed- that he has given approval for Clay to marry Aleta (a half-breed). Big Dan tells him he lied to get him to come back and draws a gun on Daniel threatening to kill him. Martha comes in and takes away the gun. Daniel, Martha, Clay, and Aleta all leave the room in disgust. Big Dan crawls out of bed to get his gun and staggers out to shoot Daniel. Daniel stands up to him and challenges him to shoot him. Big Dan relents and does not shoot saying that Daniel is too much like him. He dies in Daniel's arms.

It is related to Alquerque and draughts as pieces leap over one another to capture. Felli's closest relatives are several thousand miles away in the form of Lau kata kati from India and the game called Butterfly from Mozambique. One main difference is that the Felli board has only one horizontal line across its breadth as opposed to two found in the other two games. There is another version, and perhaps even the correction version, where the pieces are promoted to \\"Mullahs\\" upon reaching the other player's first rank. The \\"Mullahs\\" are like the \\"Kings\\" in International Draughts, and they can move any number of unoccupied spaces. They can also leap over an enemy piece from any distance, and land any distance behind it. The game is also called Fich.  Goal  The goal of each player is to capture all the other player's pieces, or stalemate the other player by immobilizing its pieces.  Equipment  The board is two triangles joined together at a common vertex. Each triangle has one horizontal line that dissects it across its breadth. A line also dissects both triangles across their lengths through the common vertex. There are a total of 13 intersection points of which the pieces are played upon. There are a total of 12 pieces of which 6 pieces are black and 6 pieces are white. Gameplay and rules # Players decide what colors to play, and who starts first. # In the beginning, each player's six pieces are set up on their respective triangle. The only vacant point is the common vertex which is also the middle point of the board. # A piece is moved one space (in any direction) per turn onto a vacant point following the pattern on the board. # A piece captures an enemy piece by the short leap as in draughts. The player's piece must be adjacent to the enemy piece, leap over it, and land onto a vacant point on the other side. The leap must be in a straight line and follow the pattern on the board. Captured pieces are removed from the board. # Only one piece may be used to move or capture per turn. Players alternate their turns throughout the game. # Mullah version: If playing the \\"Mullah\\" version, then pieces are promoted to Mullah upon reaching the other player's two corners on the first rank. The Mullahs may move any number of unoccupied spaces on the board, and capture an enemy piece from any distance and land any distance behind it provided no other pieces are in between. Multiple captures are allowed. If a non-Mullah piece captures enemy pieces in a sequence of multiple captures, and happens to land on the other player's first rank corners in the process, the player's piece does not become promoted to Mullah. Captures are compulsory.

Vanderbilt's estate; designed Tuxedo Park in New York; and landscaped Colgate University. His designs for Greycourt's surrounds won a prestigious horticultural prize in 1902. The remains are now a Massachusetts state park.

Tenney purchased it in 1882 and remodeled to become the entry point to Greycourt. Today it is one of the few remaining structures on the estate. In 1951, the Tenney family gave to the town for Tenney High School (now Tenney Grammar School) and sold the rest to the Basilian Salvatorian Order. From 1977-1978 a series of fires eventually destroyed the mansion. The Gatehouse and the Stock House or Stables are all that remain standing. ReferencesOther sources * King, Moses.

It was constructed from 1896 to 1897 in an effort to ease the grades of the original alignment ( 1 in 33 ) from before Newnes Junction to Clarence, with a ruling grade of 1 in 60. Along with a few crossing loops, it enabled much longer trains to use the line. After the construction of the Ten Tunnels Deviation, it was abandoned. History The deviation started construction around July 1896 due to a sudden rise in traffic along the Western Line. It was longer than the original alignment but it eased the grades to 1 in 60 and stretched three miles from Newnes Junction to Clarence. During construction, when the line rejoined the original alignment at Clarence, a number of changes had to be made. The original up platform was removed and a new platform was erected a few hundred meters west. This platform is currently used by the Zig Zag Railway as a terminus. The platform on the loop was also removed. The construction was initially planned to take six months but due to a number of delays, including one incident where among other things a charge exploded prematurely, the line wasn't officially opened until April 1897. Zig Zag Railway The Zig Zag Railway have plans to extend the railway from Clarence to Newnes Junction, using the Dargans Deviation. They are currently halfway in relaying the track to Narrow Gauge. One of the reasons is because Newnes Junction will provide a much better interchange with Blue Mountains Line services than Zig Zag Bottom Points, and this indicates that the Newnes Junction station will be restored in future.

It is the story of a girl of questionable mental stability who escapes from incarceration and ends up at a plantation where she disrupts a working family's daily routines and chemistry. Plot Susana is full of the unique touches of Bu√±uel's surrealism. The heroine, Susana (Rosita Quintana), is a beautiful inmate of a reformatory. When first seen, Susana is thrown into a solitary cell with bats and rats for misbehaving and the correction officer says Imagine, she's been here two years and is worse than ever!. In her cell, she asks for God's help, facing a shadow of the cross formed by the window bars from where a spider crawls away. She manages to pull the bars across the window away from the rotting walls and escapes into the rainy night. She ends up at a ranch who gives her shelter after she gives an invented history. She soon entices the men, who become obsessed with possessing her and end up fighting over her: Jes√∫s, the ranch foreman; Alberto, the family's teenage son; and Guadalupe, Alberto's father, \\"a God- fearing man and the faithful husband of the beautiful, patient Dona Carmen\\". Analysis Gilles Deleuze in his work Cinema 1: The Movement Image talks about the impulse-image in Susana \\"that achieves the complete exhaustion of a milieu: mother, servant, son and father. The impulse must be exhaustive. It is not even sufficient to say that the impulse contents itself with what a milieu gives it or leaves to it. This contentment is not resignation, but a great joy in which the impulse rediscovers its power of choice, since it is, at the deepest level, the desire to change milieu, to seek a new milieu to explore, to dislocate, enjoying all the more what this milieu offers, however low, repulsive or disgusting it may be. The joys of the impulse cannot be measured against the affect, that is, against the intrinsic qualities of the possible object.\\" Cast * Fernando Soler Don Guadalupe * Rosita Quintana Susana * V√≠ctor Manuel Mendoza Jes√∫s * Mar√≠a Gentil Arcos Felisa * Luis L√≥pez Somoza Alberto * Matilde Palou Do√±a Carmen * Rafael Icardo Don Severiano, veterinary * Enrique del Castillo Reformatory official ReferencesExternal links * Category:1951 films Category:1951 drama films Category:Mexican films Category:Mexican drama films Category:Spanish-language films Category:Mexican black-and-white films Category:Films directed by Luis Bu√±uel ","title":"Susana (film)"},{"id":"18699858","text":"is a railway station operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East) in Kawasaki-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan.

It is not certain whether C√≥rdova was his family name, or whether he assumed it from his native city after he became a Dominican. Life He was first a soldier, serving in Flanders as ensign. He then went to Mexico, and accompanied Coronado to New Mexico in 1540-42. In 1543, he entered the Dominican Order at Mexico and was sent to Oaxaca in 1548, where he acquired the Zapotecan idiom and ministered to the Indians. He was named provincial in 1568. Brought up under military discipline, he administered as provincial with such severity, that there were many complaints against him to the chapter that congregated at Yanhuitlan in 1570. He refused to comply with the admonitions of his superiors and change his methods, and was accordingly suspended. With the exclamation: \\"Benedictus Deus!\\" he received the notification of his deposition, and, declining the interference of the Viceroy Enriquez in his favour, retired to his convent at Tlacochauaya in Oaxaca, where he died after twenty-five years spent in retirement and in the study of the Zapotecan language and the customs of the natives.

Life He was probably the son of Edward Hatton, yeoman, of Great Crosby, Lancashire, who registered his estate as a Catholic non-juror in 1717, and whose family appears in the recusant rolls. He received his education in the Dominican college at Bornhem, near Antwerp, where he was professed, 25 May 1722, taking the name in religion of Antoninus. Having filled the duties of teacher for several years, he was ordained priest and on 7 July 1730, he left college for the mission work in his own country. He first officiated as chaplain, in turn, to several gentleman in Yorkshire, and in the year 1749 he went to assist Father Thomas Worthington, O.P, at Middleton Lodge, near Leeds. After the latter's death, which occurred on 25 February 1753 (or 1754), Father Hatton was entrusted with the care of the mission. Shortly afterwards he was compelled to remove the mission to Stourton Lodge, where ultimately he succeeded in having a new chapel erected (1776), a few miles distant from the former site. Twice was Father Hatton appointed to the office of provincial of his order in England: on 21 May 1754-until the year 1758; his second term of office lasted from 7 May 1770, till 1774. In 1776 he began the mission at Hunslet, near Leeds, but did not live long to see its work.

It was defined by Maxim Kontsevich. The Kontsevich invariant is a universal quantum invariant in the sense that any quantum invariant may be recovered by substituting the appropriate weight system into any Jacobi diagram. Definition The Kontsevich invariant is defined by monodromy along solutions of the Knizhnik‚ÄìZamolodchikov equations.  Jacobi diagram and Chord diagram = Definition  an example of a Jacobi diagram Let be a circle (which is a 1-dimensional manifold). As is shown in the figure on the right, a Jacobi diagram with order is the graph with vertices, with the external circle depicted as solid line circle and with dashed lines called inner graph, which satisfies the following conditions: #The orientation is given only to the external circle. #The vertices have values 1 or 3. The valued 3 vertices are connected to one of the other edge with clockwise or anti-clockwise direction depicted as the little directed circle. The valued 1 vertices are connected to the external circle without multiplicity, ordered by the orientation of the circle. The edges on are called chords. We denote as the quotient space of the commutative group generated by all the Jacobi diagrams on divided by the following relations: :(The AS relation) 90px + 90px = 0 :(The IHX relation) 90px = 90px ‚àí 90px :(The STU relation) 90px = 90px ‚àí 90px :(The FI relation) 90px = 0. A diagram without vertices valued 3 is called a chord diagram. If every connected component of a graph has a vertex valued 3, then we can make the Jacobi diagram into a Chord diagram using the STU relation recursively. If we restrict ourselves only to chord diagrams, then the above four relations are reduced to the following two relations: :(The four term relation) 90px ‚àí 90px + 90px ‚àí 90px = 0. :(The FI relation) 90px = 0.  Properties  * The degree of a Jacobi diagram is defined to be the half of the sum of the number of its vertices with value 1 and one with value 3. It is the number of chords in the Chord diagram transformed from the Jacobi diagram. * Just like for the tangles, the Jacobi diagrams form a monoidal category with the composition as the compiling of Jacobi diagrams along up and down direction and the tensor product as juxtapositioning Jacobi diagrams. ** In the special case where is an interval , will be a commutative algebra. Viewing as the algebra with multiplication as connected sums, is isomorphic to . * A Jacobi diagram can be viewed as abstraction of representations of the tensor algebra generated by Lie algebras, which allows us to define some operations analogous to coproducts, counits and antipodes of Hopf algebras. * Since the Vassiliev invariants (or finite type invariants) are closely related to chord diagrams, one can construct a singular knot from a chord diagram on . denoting the space generated by all the singular knots with degree , every such determines a unique element in .  Weight system  A map from the Jacobi diagrams to the positive integers is called a weight system. The map extended to the space is also called the weight system. They have the following properties: * Let be a semisimple Lie algebra and its representation. We obtain a weight system by \\"substituting\\" the invariant tensor of into the chord of a Jacobi diagram and into the underlying manifold of the Jacobi diagram. ** We can view the vertices with value 3 of the Jacobi diagram as the bracket product of the Lie algebra, solid line arrows as the representation space of , and the vertices with value 1 as the action of the Lie algebra. ** The IHX relation and the STU relation correspond respectively to the Jacobi identity and the definition of the representation ::: . * Weight systems play an essential role in the proof of the Mervin-Morton conjecture, which relates Alexander polynomials to Jones polynomials.  History  Jacobi diagrams were introduced as analogues of Feynman diagrams when Kontsevich defined knot invariants by iterated integrals in the first half of 1990s. He represented singular points of singular knots by chords, i.e. he treated only with chord diagrams. D. Bar-Natan later formulated them as the 1-3 valued graphs and studied their algebraic properties, and called them \\"Chinese character diagrams\\" in his paper. Several terms such as chord diagrams, web diagrams, or Feynman diagrams were used to refer them, but they have been called Jacobi diagrams since around 2000, because the IHX relation corresponds to the Jacobi identity for Lie algebras. We can interpret them from a more general point of view by claspers, which were defined independently by Goussarov and Kazuo Habiro in the later half of the 1990s.

The spider was discovered on the California coastline in 2007. Spider Aptostichus stephencolberti is found on coastal dunes that extend from the Big Sur area to the San Francisco Peninsula at Point Lobos and Golden Gate. Compared to closely related species such as Aptostichus angelinajolieae (named after Angelina Jolie), Aptostichus stephencolberti is lighter in color. The male holotype and the female paratype both have brownish yellow legs, carapace and chelicerae, while the abdomen is lighter with dusky stripes. The male has six teeth, while the female has five. Naming The spider was named after Colbert after he reported on his television series The Colbert Report that Jason Bond, a professor of biology at East Carolina University, named a different species of spider Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi, after the Canadian rock star Neil Young. Colbert was angered by the fact that Bond had not named a spider after him, and began to appeal for a species of animal to be named after him. He claimed that he already had an eagle and a turtle named after him (although not taxonomically), so there was no reason that another animal could not be named after him as well. On a later edition of The Colbert Report, Colbert revealed that Bond would name a spider after him, with Colbert claiming, \\"And all I had to do was shamelessly beg on national television.\\" The two men talked on the phone to decide which spider should be named after Colbert, but as there were 27 different species of spider available, Bond was left to make the final choice. The name Aptostichus stephencolberti was officially announced as the spider named after Colbert on The Colbert Report on August 6, 2008. Because Colbert pronounces his surname with a silent \\"T\\", the last \\"T\\" in stephencolberti is also silent.

It has classes from Lower Kindergarten to 10th grade level. The institution conducts its classes as per the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) syllabus of the State Government of Andhra Pradesh. School history Modern High School was established in July 1959. The school was founded by Syed Imaduddin Qadri. The present correspondent of Modern High School is Smt. Rabia Begum. Admissions Though the school is a minority institution, its admission is open to all students irrespective of caste, creed, religion or gender. For admission into Kindergarten, the school follows an admission policy. Every year in January, one of the three schools in rotation conducts the admissions procedure for Kindergarten which involves an interview of the student and the parents. The number of students who apply for admission far exceeds the number of positions available and hence it is a very competitive process. Students are allowed to state their choice among the three schools but their choice is not guaranteed. A twenty-percent quota is generally reserved for economically backward students. Academics=Divisions The school has four academic divisions- Pre-primary, Primary, Middle and Senior. The pre-primary division has four sections each of lower and upper Kindergarten. The primary division has four sections each of Classes I to III (Class III is equivalent to the Third Grade as it is called in the USA, Canada and some other parts of the world. Note that the word \\"Class\\" is used instead of \\"Grade\\" and the year is written in Roman Numeral). The pre-primary and primary divisions are housed in one campus, commonly called the \\"Primary School\\" The Middle school has four sections each of Classes IV to VII and the High School has four sections each of Classes VIII to X. Both the Middle school and High School are housed in another building, commonly called the \\"High School Campus\\". The High School Campus and the Primary Campus are near one another on the same road. Exams The academic year starts mid-June and ends in early April and is divided into three quarters. Examinations are held at the end of every quarter and every month. At the end of Class X, the students take the State Government administered Secondary School Certificate Examination. At the end of Class VII also, students have to take a State Government administered exam. The school has displayed good performance in the public exams and has in several occasions had 100% pass results. Houses The school follows a House system. The student body is split into four houses with an aim to promote competition among the students. * Yellow (Cosmonauts) * Blue (Aeronauts) * Green (Astronauts) * Red (Argonauts) School ceremonies and traditions Investiture ceremony * At the beginning of every academic year, the newly elected School Cabinet and Class Leaders take the oath of office in an investiture ceremony. The Head Boy and the Head Girl make their maiden speech on this occasion. Teachers' Day * 5 September of every year is celebrated as Teachers' Day all over India in the memory of former President Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan.

It was founded in 1948 by Mr Patrick Shumack, Esq. as the Anglers Cooperative Association (ACA), but changed its name in 1994 to Anglers Conservation Association. Current activities Fish Legal fights cases on behalf of its members against perpetrators of the following: all types of water pollution, including sewage pollution (as in the case of Llyn Padarn involving pollution by Welsh Water), agricultural pollution and chemical pollution, over-abstraction, poaching, unlawful navigation, barriers to fish, such as weirs and hydropower schemes designed with inappropriate concern of anglers or fish welfare as in the case referenced here, where Fish legal were acting on behalf of the Pride of Derby & Derbyshire Angling Association to preserve fishing rights of the local weir from impoundment by developers. Fish Legal has developed freedom of information law to allow its members and the wider public to find out what water companies in England and Wales are discharging into rivers and coastal waters. In Fish Legal and Emily Shirley v Information Commissioner, United Utilities plc, Yorkshire Water Services Ltd, Southern Water Services Ltd and the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs [2015 UKUT 0052 9AAC0] the Upper Tribunal decided that water companies were public authorities for the purposes of the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 and, as such, should disclose environmental information that they hold on request. Questions in the case were referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), in order to determine the correct implementation of the Environmental Information Directive. The Information Commissioner published new guidance on the regulations as a result of the case. In 2015, Fish Legal joined with the Angling Trust and WWF UK in a judicial review of Defra and the Environment Agency for their lack of use of Water Protection Zones to protect fisheries from agricultural pollution. In Scotland, Fish Legal has worked with Scottish charity the Sustainable Inshore Fisheries Trust (SIFT) to develop an ‚ÄòAquaculture Toolkit‚Äô to help communities to better police salmon farms to make sure they do not cause damage to local wild salmon and sea trout populations. Formation of the Angling Trust After two years of discussion in 2009, six angling organisations merged to create the Angling Trust. These were the Anglers Conservation Association (now Fish Legal, Fisheries and Angling Conservation Trust (FACT), National Association of Fisheries and Angling Consultatives (NAFAC), National Federation of Anglers (NFA), National Federation of Sea Anglers (NFSA), and the Specialist Anglers' Alliance (SAA). The Salmon & Trout Association (S&TA;) pulled out of the merger consultations because they wished to keep their charitable status and charities are not allowed to merge under the Laws of England and Wales.

They are located in the north of the city and occupies 10.3 hectare of land beside the junction of the Piangil and Deniliquin lines. History The workshops were opened in November 1917 by the main rail operator in Victoria, the Victorian Railways. They were opened in response to political pressures from provincial groups for decentralisation, with the Victorian Railways preferring the cheaper option of expanding the existing Newport Workshops in suburban Melbourne. Furthermore, unemployment had risen in both Bendigo and Ballarat due to a decline in mining operations.A Job for Life Thomas, Graham Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, May;June, 1998 pp176-187;203-215 The main work carried out was repairs and maintenance of existing wagons and locomotives, however during 1919-22 thirteen new steam locomotives were also built - eight DD class (1033 - 1037, 1047 - 1049) and five A2 class (1078 - 1082).ARHS Tour Notes: The Great Northern Express - March 19, 1966 From the 1950s onwards, numerous steam locomotives were scrapped at the workshops. During the years immediately following nominal dieselisation in 1968, they were, at times, cutting up locomotives at the rate of one every two to three weeks. The workshops were also the site of the first VR brass foundry, which was transferred to Newport by the 1960s. Also throughout 1965 VLX louvred vans were constructed at the workshops, at a rate of one a week. Other tasks included spring manufacture, construction of stainless steel footwarmers, and assembly of pantographs for electric trains, with a staff of 720 employed during 1966. By the 1980s refurbishment work was also being carried out on Melbourne suburban electric multiple units. The 1980s were also a time of restructuring, and on the breakup of the Victorian Railways the workshops passed to the State Transport Authority and then the Public Transport Corporation. With privatisation the workshops were closed, with the loss of 262 jobs. The site was used to store excess rolling stock, with 12 Hitachi suburban trains being stored there and becoming heavily vandalised, until they were returned to Melbourne in 2006. The workshops were redeveloped in 2002 at a cost of $6.5 million - $4 million from VicTrack, $2 million from the State Government Regional Infrastructure Development Fund and $500,000 by the City of Greater Bendigo. The redevelopment was officially opened in 2004, with Empire Rubber (a division of Nylex) the major tenant, producing rubber vehicle components. The site covers 10.3 hectares of land and has 31 separate buildings, including a 10,000sqm main workshop building and 6 kilometres of railway track.

Early life and family Heyman was born in Leipzig to German-Jewish parents. His father, an economist and broadcaster who opposed Hitler, fled Germany on 30 January 1933. The seven-month-old John and his mother joined him that November in London, where his father had secured work as a journalist on the now defunct News Chronicle. During World War II, his father worked for the Ministry of Information and was naturalised British in the national interest. After the war he was the financial correspondent for The Economist, The Times of London, and Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung. He died at his typewriter putting the final 'full stop' on a leader column for the Times, which was published two days after his death. John's mother, an avid suffragette, was both a teacher of Russian studies and a permanent student, collecting her seventh degree (in Economics) from the London School of Economics at the age of 70. In March 1977, Heyman converted to Christianity.The Quest for Russia's Soul: Evangelicals and Moral Education in Post-Communist Russia, p. 26, Perry Lynn Glanzer, Baylor University Press, 2002 Education and early career Heyman was educated at Norfolk House in London, Wycliffe College in Gloucestershire, and finally at St. Edmund Hall, Oxford. After two years of National Service in the Army, Heyman returned to Oxford to read law. During a summer vacation, he obtained free tickets to a Radio Luxembourg show. Having been chosen as a contestant he won ¬£93, more money than he thought existed in the world, and he returned to Oxford as the question writer for the show Double Your Money, which would run in the top ten for thirteen years on the new Independent Television Network in England. He also sold a number of other television concepts. In 1955 Heyman started full-time work in the entertainment industry and by the age of 22 was Head of Public Relations at Associated Television, one of the two founder companies of the ITV. By then he was working on five of the network‚Äôs television programmes, three of which were rated among ITV‚Äôs top ten. In 1959 Heyman formed The International Artists Agency, which represented, among others, Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, Richard Harris, Laurence Harvey, Trevor Howard, Shirley Bassey, and Burt Bacharach. In 1961 the agency formed the subsidiary World Film Sales, the first company to pre- sell and license pictures on a territory-by-territory basis. World Film Sales was sold to ITC in 1973. It was the first of a series of companies which would become the World Group of Companies Limited. For over 40 years, the company and its executives have been producers, packagers, co-financiers, investors, or distributors of films that have garnered numerous awards, including more than 150 Academy Award nominations and more than two dozen Oscars. Career In 1963 Heyman started to work as a film producer and had over his lifetime produced some 15 films, among them The Go-Between and The Hireling, which both won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival. He co-financed a further 150 films. In 1964 he also co-produced the longest running Hamlet in Broadway history, starring Richard Burton and directed by John Gielgud. In 1965 Heyman produced Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad, starring Hermione Gingold in London‚Äôs West End. In 1973 he founded The Genesis Project to create an audio-visual encyclopaedia, atlas, and dictionary. It commenced translating the Bible onto film accompanied by a variety of educational materials. After completing the filming of Genesis and the Gospel of Luke (which, under the title Jesus, became the most viewed film in history), The New Media Bible was sold to an evangelical organisation, having failed commercially in the age before VHS or DVD. In the early 1970s, Heyman began to render financial services to major film studios, and is widely credited with creating \\"structured financing\\" in the film industry.

Tunis, which itself was an unflattering and thinly veiled fictionalization of tennis star Helen Wills Moody. Plot Florence Farley, a girl from Santa Monica, California in her late teens, and a tennis prodigy, is torn between fulfilling the dreams of her ambitious mother Millie, who has planned her tennis career, or her own dreams of being with the man she loves. Florence has a chance meeting with Gordon McKay, the nephew of a wealthy town figure. Invited to play tennis at the local country club, she defeats him easily. Her prowess at the game causes J.R. Carpenter, the country club's manager, to offer Florence a membership there, plus a trip to Philadelphia to compete for the national junior championship. Her scheming, social-climbing mother Millie manages to include herself on the trip, leaving her ill husband Will behind. She flirts with Florence's new coach Fletcher Locke and accepts money and gifts, which could endanger her daughter's amateur status. Once Millie realizes that Gordon is not wealthy, she discourages Florence from entertaining the idea of marrying him. After winning at Forest Hills, an increasingly unhappy Florence wants to retire from tennis and get married. Her father, on his death bed, scolds Millie for looking out for her own interests rather than their girl's. Florence wins the Wimbledon women's singles title, then abruptly quits the game, announcing her impending marriage to Gordon and leaving her mother a forlorn figure on the sideline. Cast * Claire Trevor as Millie Farley * Sally Forrest as Florence Farley * Carleton G. Young as Fletcher Locke * Robert Clarke as Gordon McKay * Kenneth Patterson as Will Farley * Marcella Cisney as Miss Martin * Joseph Kearns as J.R. Carpenter * William Hudson as Interne * George Fisher as Announcer  Production  There were two working titles of this film, Mother of a Champion and Loving Cup. It was later decided to be Hard Fast and Beautiful. The two main characters, Sally Forrest who played Florence and Claire Trevor who played Millie Farley - the mother were the most well-known actors in this film. Sally Forrest was borrowed from M-G-M for the production. Forrest also starred in two previous Lupino films, Not Wanted and Never Fear (1949). According to a Hollywood Reporter news article, Eleanor Tennant, the technical advisor, coached Forrest on her tennis in her tennis-playing scenes. Claire Trevor, an Oscar-winning actress played similar roles to Lupino and was determined to perform this role effectively. It is said that Lupino was lucky to have Trevor be a part of this picture. Location: Most of the shooting took place at Forest Hills Tennis Club in Queens, New York, and in North Hollywood, CA. Archival footage of tennis matches at Forest Hills and Wimbledon were included in the film. According to the Hollywood Reporter review, the film, which marked Ida Lupino's third official directing assignment and was co- produced by The Filmakers, which was the company founded by her and her husband producer Collier Young. The film cost less than $300,000 to produce. Ida Lupino and actor Robert Ryan make a few cameos as tennis match spectators. The world premiere of Hard, Fast and Beautiful took place in San Francisco, California on May 23, 1951.  Critical reception  A 1951 New York Times article says, ‚ÄúWell, let's be practical about it. The script that Martha Wilkerson prepared from a story by John R. Tunis (\\"Mother of a Champion\\") is a trite and foolish thing. It simply recounts the quick parabola that a girl tennis player describes in becoming a tennis champion and then chucking it all for love. And it is played with such lack of authority by everyone in the cast that it doesn't even carry the satisfaction that a well-acted romance might have. Under Miss Lupino's direction, Sally Forrest is a silly, callow child, given to such tedious explosions as \\"Wouldn't that be WONDERFUL!\\" and \\"Gee!\\"...Robert Clark and Kenneth Patterson, as the good men in Miss Forrest's life, are hardly an inspiration for anything more than yawns.‚Äù The film was given a fair rating in a Film Bulletin (1951) review. It describes, ‚ÄúHard Fast and Beautiful is a modest, unpretentious endeavor from Filmakers...Like the previous attractions in this outfit‚Äôs short history (‚ÄúNot Wanted‚Äù and ‚ÄúOutrage‚Äù) this one is designed to get over the hump by means of special exploitation. The names are not strong, but the performances to a man, are degrees above above [sic] the average found in a production costing less than $300,000. The gimmick lies in the story, a clever combination of misguided mother love and an expos√© of the amateur tennis business. The tennis scenes pack more excitement than one might expect...The finish is rather lame, the girl champion‚Äôs belated awakening to the unscrupulous deals put over by her mother being not especially convincing.‚Äù Another review from a 1951 Harrison‚Äôs Reports article explains, ‚ÄúThis is a tennis picture and, as such, should appeal strongly to the tennis fans, but it is doubtful whether those who are not especially interested in the game will derive much pleasure out of it, particularly since the story pits a mother‚Äôs ambition for worldly goods against her daughters‚Äôs sic sincerity in the game, as well as her love for a young man. It is not pleasant to see a grasping mother profiteering on her daughter‚Äôs fame. The action in the tennis sequences are so realistic that one is made to feel as if he is watching the playing of a real game, not a prearranged one. No fault can be found with the direction and acting. The photography is a treat to the eye.‚Äù Box office  Hard, Fast and Beautiful estimated $14,000 its first week in San Francisco. According to Variety‚Äôs May 30, 1951 article, ‚ÄúDespite big bally plus personals by Jane Greer, Robert Ryan, William Bendix, Pat O‚ÄôBrien, Tony Martin and Harry Crocker, among others ‚ÄúHard Fast and Beautiful‚Äù is failing to keep up to opening day pace at Golden Gate. It equaled house record that day, and still will come in with smooth session, if not smash. Nearly all spots hit by heat wave and Shrine Circus.‚Äù Motion Picture Daily of New York stated, ‚ÄúHard Fast and Beautiful opened satisfactorily over the weekend at the Astor; $25,000 is estimated for the first week.‚Äù The film grossed an estimate of $11,000 in New York, its second week. ‚ÄúClosing at a slow pace is ‚ÄúHard, Fast and Beautiful,‚Äù which will bow out of the Astor tonight with about $6,000 for the fourth and final week.‚Äù - Motion Picture Daily In Chicago, Motion Picture Herald‚Äôs ‚ÄòWhat the Picture did for me‚Äô section states, ‚ÄúHARD FAST AND BEAUTIFUL: Claire Trevor, Robert Clarke - A good picture, but definitely not for a small town.

The three most common modifications to which the term is applied are: # Open identities: Authors and reviewers are aware of each other's identity. # Open reports: Review reports are published alongside the relevant article (rather than being kept confidential). # Open participation: The wider community (and not just invited reviewers) are able to contribute to the review process. These modifications are supposed to address various perceived shortcomings of the traditional scholarly peer review process, in particular its lack of transparency, lack of incentives, and wastefulness. Definitions=Open identities Open peer review may be defined as \\"any scholarly review mechanism providing disclosure of author and referee identities to one another at any point during the peer review or publication process\\". Then reviewer's identities may or may not be disclosed to the public. This is in contrast to the traditional peer review process where reviewers remain anonymous to anyone but the journal's editors, while authors' names are disclosed from the beginning. Open reports Open peer review may be defined as making the reviewers' reports public, instead of disclosing them to the article's authors only. This may include publishing the rest of the peer review history, i.e. the authors' replies and editors' recommendations. Most often, this concerns only articles that are accepted for publication, and not those that are rejected. Open participation Open peer review may be defined as allowing self-selected reviewers to comment on an article, rather than (or in addition to) having reviewers who are selected by the editors. This assumes that the text of the article is openly accessible. The self-selected reviewers may or may not be screened for their basic credentials, and they may contribute either short comments or full reviews.  Adoption = Adoption by publishers  These publishers operate various flavours of open peer review: * BMJ Group * BioMed Central * Copernicus Publications * European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) * PeerJ * eLife * PLOS * WikiJournal * SciPost *Nature * Semantic Web journal by IOS Press Peer review at BMJ, BioMed Central, EMBO, eLife,, PLOS and the Semantic Web journal involves posting the entire pre-publication history of the article online, including not only signed reviews of the article, but also its previous versions and in some cases names of handling editors and author responses to the reviewers. The European Geosciences Union operates public discussions where open peer review is conducted before suitable articles are accepted for publication in the actual journal. Open peer review of preprints Some platforms, including some preprint servers, facilitate open peer review of preprints. * In 2019, the preprint server BioRxiv started allowing posting reviews alongside preprints, in addition to allowing comments on preprints. The reviews can come from journals or from platforms such as Review Commons. * In 2020, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the platform Outbreak Science Rapid PREreview was launched in order to perform rapid open peer review of preprints related to emerging outbreaks. The platform initially worked with preprints from medRxiv, bioRxiv and arXiv. Advantages and disadvantages=Argued Open identities have been argued to incite reviewers to be \\"more tactful and constructive\\" than they would be if they could remain anonymous, while however allowing authors to accumulate enemies who try to keep their papers from being published or their grant applications from being successful. Open peer review in all its forms has been argued to favour more honest reviewing, and to prevent reviewers from following their individual agendas. Open peer review has also been argued to help evaluate the legitimacy of manuscripts that contain editorial conflict of interests, in particular for the COVID-19 that had benefited from a fast- tracking of reviewing. Observed In an experiment with 56 research articles accepted by the Medical Journal of Australia in 1996‚Äì1997, the articles were published online together with the peer reviewers' comments; readers could email their comments and the authors could amend their articles further before print publication. The investigators concluded that the process had modest benefits for authors, editors and readers. Some studies have found that open identities lead to an increase in the quality of reviews, while other studies find no significant effect. Open peer review at BMJ journals has lent itself to randomized trials that compared open peer review (with open identities and open reports) with non-open peer review. These studies did not find that open peer review significantly affected the quality of review or the rate of acceptance of articles for publication, and there was only one reported instance of a conflict between authors and reviewers (\\"adverse event\\"). The only significant negative effect of open peer review was \\"increasing the likelihood of reviewers declining to review\\". In some cases, open identities have helped detect reviewers' conflicts of interests. Open participation has been criticised as being a form of popularity contest in which well known authors are more likely to get their manuscripts reviewed than others. However, even with this implementation of Open Peer Reviews, both authors and reviewers acknowledged that Open Reviews could lead to a higher quality of reviews, foster collaborations and reduce the \\"cite-me\\" effect. According to a 2020 Nature editorial, experience from Nature Communications negates the concerns that open reports would be less critical, or would require an excessive amount of work from reviewers.

Her reason for doing this is because singing and acting have one thing in common: they both end with \\"ing\\". :Hamsome: Played by Benjamin Heng, Hamsome is a new-age being with a penchant for picking fights and doing anything that is stupid but at the same time gets walk-on roles because his loan shark father (which Hamsome doesn't want to be part of) has threatened the people working on the studio set. :Sanjay Chabra: Played by Vadi Pvss, Sanjay is a veteran of more than 600 Bollywood films (599 of them were 10-second walk-ons, the 600th caused a riot at cinemas in his native India) who still finds himself landing walk-on roles after moving to Singapore in his quest to make it big. :Kak Pon: Played by Mastura Ahmad, Kak Pon is a part- time calefare who decided to join this occupation after she took acting lessons at a community center just for fun when she is not attending to her other day job, a Nasi Padang stall, which she has operated for 15 years (She says that she is in the \\"Food Business\\"). Kak Pon is also the smartest member of the quintet when it comes to current entertainment gossip and probably the only one who cares. She also freely dispenses advice and acts as the \\"de facto\\" counsellor for the hopefuls. Episodes *1.

Geology Shanklin Chine, circa 1910. A chine is a local word for a stream cutting back into a soft cliff. Formation of the Chine, which cuts through Lower Greensand Cretaceous sandstones, has taken place over the last 10,000 years.

The Isle of Wight has a number of chines, but the largest remaining is Shanklin. With a drop of 32 m (105 ft) to sea level, and a length of just over 400m (a quarter of a mile), the Chine covers an area of approximately 1.2 hectares (three acres).Origins of Shanklin Chine History Prior to the Victorian era Shanklin was merely a small agricultural and fishing community, the latter nestling at the foot of the chine, and it was not until the early 19th century that it began to grow.
