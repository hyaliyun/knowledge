It is one of several genera of ferns adapted to an aquatic existence. C. richardii was previously regarded as being part of the species Ceratopteris thalictroides.  \\"C-Fern\\"  This particular species is of special scientific interest because a patented strain, called \\"C-Fern\\", was developed as a scientific aid and teaching tool in biology in 1995. The use of \\"C-Fern\\" is facilitated by the fact that it grows readily in a cell-culture dish on agar media, reaching sexual maturity within 2‚Äì3 weeks of spore inoculation, with motile sperm cells being visible at this time. Over the course of about 6 weeks germination, sex determination and development of gametophytes, fertilization, embryogenesis, organogenesis, and sporophyte growth can all be observed, allowing an incredibly comprehensive study of the life cycle of homosporous ferns in a relatively short time period. In addition, due to the small size of the plant many specimens can be observed growing simultaneously, allowing for larger sample sizes in research studies. Following the culture of \\"C-Fern\\" in dishes it can be transplanted to a dirt substrate, where it can be further allowed to grow and future generations can be used for subsequent studies. Monilophytes are generally studied far less than other groups of plants and a full genome sequence is not yet available, however due to the development of \\"C-Fern\\" research into fern biology has been more prevalent and C. richardii has been used as a model organism to study vascular plant cell walls, alternation of generations (and associated mutations), genetics, population dynamics, and the effects of mitotic disrupter herbicides, among other topics. Despite being genetically identical the inoculated spores can give rise to both hermaphrodites and male gametophytes, depending on the secretion of Antheridiogen; this phenomenon has been used to study plant pheromones and the cascade of events that leads to epigenetic changes in ferns. The ability to switch from bisexual to all male spores may provide an evolutionary advantage by promoting outbreeding.Timothy Walker, Plants: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press, 2012. p. 49 The use of C. richardii in genetic research studies has been valuable to understanding fern and plant evolution as a whole, and in 2019 \\"C-fern\\" became the first homosporous fern to have its genome partially assembled, thus acting as a reference genome to which other ferns can be compared. C. richardii spores germinated in space in 1999 on shuttle mission STS-93, making them one of the few plants to be grown in space.

She was two years old when her parents moved to Phoenix, Arizona, and she lost her sister, Elizabeth, and her father at an early age. Armstrong grew up in Phoenix, playing sandlot ball with the boys of her neighborhood when she was a little girl. \\"They stuck me in the outfield, so l had to learn to throw\\", she recalled. As a youngster, she was befriended by local big leaguer Hank Leiber, who taught her to pitch. At the age of 14, Armstrong was scouted by the Phoenix professional softball team, the A-1 Queens, and began her sports career. Armstrong developed into a record- breaking pitcher as she toured with the Queens throughout the West, as well as Madison Square Garden and international tours to Mexico and Canada. Later, during World War II, she was recruited by Philip K. Wrigley to join the All- American Girls Professional Baseball League for the 1944 season.Encyclopedia of women and baseball - Leslie A.

She owned and operated one of the early shops in Old Town Scottsdale in the 1950s, The Paint Bucket, in which she sold everything from hand-painted blouses and boxer shorts to wastepaper baskets, handmade cards and invitations. At the time, her shop was a favorite of visiting guests from the Elizabeth Arden spa and Camelback Inn, including singer Peggy Lee, actress Alice Faye and polifacetic entertainer Phil Harris. Her work at the Paint Bucket attracted the owners of O'Brien's Art Emporium in Scottsdale, and with their encouragement, she began a career as a fine artist, creating Trompe-l'≈ìil still life and wildlife images, landscapes and more. Her works were sold in art galleries and shown at the Phoenix Art Museum, being collected by art lovers across the Southwest.

Meteorological history Severe Tropical Cyclone Chris was first identified by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) on 1 February 2002 as a weak area of low pressure over the Timor Sea. Over the following day, the system tracked towards the southwest, eventually reaching a point roughly 340 km (210 mi) northwest of Broome, Western Australia, at which time it was classified as a tropical low. Situated in a region of moderate wind shear and good upper- level divergence, the system gradually intensified. The low initially tracked towards the southeast in response to a monsoonal flow; however, this later shifted towards the south-southwest as system intensified. On 2 February, the low intensified into a minimal tropical cyclone. Operationally, the system was not classified as a tropical cyclone until 3 February, at which time it was given the name Chris by the BoM. Although already considered to have obtained gale-force winds by the BoM, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed the system to have become a tropical depression late on 2 February. Chris reached peak intensity with 1-minute sustained winds of as it approached the coast late on 5 February. The storm made landfall early on 6 February near peak intensity, between Pardoo Station and Wallal, Western Australia. Preparations and impact Off the coast of Indonesia, two motorboats capsized amid turbulent waters. The twelve people on these boats were listed as missing. Naval vessels from Indonesia were deployed to search for the missing people on 7 February. Heavy rains throughout southern Indonesia triggered flooding and mudslides in numerous towns and villages. Some areas were inundated by up to of water as a result of the storm. Significant coastal damage was also reported from large swells. Ahead of the storm, residents throughout the Pilbara region were placed on high alert as the Category 5 cyclone neared landfall. By 5 February, towns from Bidyadanga to Port Hedland and inland to Marble Bar were placed on yellow alert. The city of Port Hedland (pop. 14,000) was one of the larger population centres in the path of Chris. Throughout the threatened region, workers were sent home early to be with their families and make final preparations for the storm. All businesses were closed and roads were likely to be shut down across the area. In Western Australia, Chris resulted in large losses of cattle herds. One farmer reported that roughly 20% of the 6,000 cattle he owned died during the storm. Losses from the cattle were estimated at A$1 million (US$929,000). In aboriginal communities along the coast, emergency assessment teams discovered that a 500,000 acre cattle farm was completely wiped out. In remote communities in the Pilbara region, heavy rains, exceeding in several locations, triggered flooding. Residents in the Warralong community were forced to evacuate their homes after the local creek flooded. However, as rescue crews attempted to reach those still in the town, it was found to be completely isolated by flood waters. At the town of Bonney Downs, along the Nullagine River, of rain produced by the storm caused the river to burst its banks, inundating parts of Nullagine, Western Australia. Significant structural damage was reported in Pardoo where the town's makeshift shelter lost its roof and some of its walls; a shed was destroyed and several homes were damaged. Several buildings in the town were destroyed by the floods, including a preschool. Power lines throughout the area were downed. At the height of the storm, communications were lost with Marble Bar. Throughout the town, only one home sustained roof damage and several fences were knocked over. By 7 February, emergency crews were deployed to the region to assist the local Aboriginal community. In some areas, rain produced by Cyclone Chris was seen in a positive way as the region was experiencing a prolonged drought, with a few places not receiving any rain within the previous 12 months. As a result of its damage, the name Chris was retired subsequent to its usage; its name was replaced with Clancy. Historical perspective As Cyclone Chris neared the Western Australian coastline, national media noted the storm's extreme intensity and compared it to several of Australia's worst cyclones. It was noted that Chris was more intense than the country's costliest natural disaster, Cyclone Tracy in 1974; almost as strong as the most intense to strike the region Cyclone Vance in 1999; and similar to that of Cyclone Annette in 1994 which killed thousands of cattle in Western Australia.

White, 484 U.S. 219 (1988), was a case decided on by the United States Supreme Court.. The case restricted judicial immunity in certain instances.  Facts  Respondent Howard Lee White served as Circuit Judge of the Seventh Judicial Circuit of the State of Illinois and Presiding Judge of the Circuit Court in Jersey County. Under Illinois law, Judge White had the authority to hire adult probation officers, who were removable in his discretion. In addition, as designee of the Chief Judge of the Seventh Judicial Circuit, Judge White had the authority to appoint juvenile probation officers to serve at his pleasure. In April 1977, Judge White hired petitioner Cynthia A. Forrester as an adult and juvenile probation officer. In July, 1979, Judge White appointed Forrester as Project Supervisor of the Jersey County Juvenile Court Intake and Referral Services Project, a position that carried increased supervisory responsibilities. Judge White demoted Forrester to a nonsupervisory position in the summer of 1980. He discharged her on October 1, 1980. Forrester filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois in July, 1982. She alleged violations of various civil rights statutes based on sexual discrimination. A jury found that Judge White had discriminated against Forrester on account of her sex, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The jury awarded her $81,818.80 in compensatory damages under ¬ß 1983.. Judge White moved for summary judgment on the ground that he was entitled to \\"judicial immunity\\" from a civil damages suit. This motion was granted. Forrester appealed. The Court of Appeals affirmed the \\"judicial immunity\\" holding from the lower court. The Supreme Court then granted certiorari.  Issue  Whether a state court judge has absolute immunity from a suit for damages under 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983 for his decision to dismiss a subordinate court employee. Also, is there a difference in judicial and administrative function when it comes to \\"judicial immunity.\\"  Holding  Judges have been given judicial immunity to preserve their important governmental function. If judges were personally liable for erroneous decisions, the resulting avalanche of suits, most of the frivolous but vexatious, would provide powerful incentives for judges to avoid rendering decisions likely to provoke such suits. Truly judicial acts, however, must be distinguished from the administrative, legislative, or executive functions that judges may occasionally be assigned by law to perform. Here, the promoting and demoting of aids can be classified as an administrative act, not a judicial one. Absolute immunity cannot be extended to judges who perform administrative acts. Justice O'Connor applied a \\"functional\\" approach under which the nature of the functions entrusted to particular officials is examined in order to evaluate the effect that exposure to particular forms of liability would likely have on the appropriate exercise of those functions. Administrative acts are indistinguishable from those of an executive branch official responsible for making similar personnel decisions, which, no matter how crucial to the efficient operation of public institutions, are not entitled to absolute immunity from liability in damages under ¬ß 1983. O'Connor dismissed the Court of Appeals reasoning that the threat of vexatious lawsuits by disgruntled ex-employees could interfere with the quality of a judge's decisions. She argued that it does not serve to distinguish judges from other public officials who hire and fire subordinates. Neither case should afford absolute immunity towards the actor.

The accident happened 130 km outside of Lae, in Morobe province. It was described as \\"one of the saddest days in the history of road accidents\\", occurring in an \\"impoverished\\" country. The local morgue was unable to cope with demand as bodies from the crash piled up. Two of the dead may have been taken elsewhere which would leave the death toll at 42 if confirmed. Crash The two buses were intended to carry only twenty-five people each but were overloaded at the time of the incident. They were also said to have been speeding, travelling as fast as . The drivers encountered potholes on the road and could not avoid a collision. Bodies were thrown through windows and across the road, some onto tar, some onto grass. Broken heads, limbs and necks were seen by onlookers. A policeman later said: \\"This accident appears to have occurred when both drivers tried to avoid potholes, and in the process collided\\". Some local people rushed to assist those in need of attention, claiming they had never before seen such a \\"bloody and macabre\\" scene. Many of those injured died on the scene quite quickly. Eight others received serious wounds. Many more died before emergency services arrived on the scene. Eighteen people were hospitalised in the aftermath of the accident. Eight of these people were left in intensive care. Some of these eight are not expected to survive. One passenger, 22-year-old Gideon Jack, said he was asleep at the time of the crash and woke up to find his bloodied body being loaded into a truck. Media in Papua New Guinea posted what were described by ABC Radio Australia's News as \\"shocking photographs of bodies hanging out of the mangled wreckage of the two buses\\". The buses were described by media in Australia as \\"mangled wrecks\\". Angau Hospital in Lae saw its morgue packed with bodies and relatives came to check if anyone they knew was amongst them. The morgue was unable to cope as bodies kept coming in, prompting requests for refrigerator donations. Response Assistant Police Commissioner Giossi Labi described the crash as follows: \\"It is one of the saddest days in the history of road accidents where we have such a number of commuters die at once\\". He also accused bus drivers of speeding so they could make more money by getting to their destinations quicker and picking up more passengers. Peter Guinness, a superintendent, said: \\"There are so many potholes along the highway. Some of these potholes are like craters. Now they basically wanted to avoid those potholes\\". Koni Iguan, a parliamentarian, said it was \\"the most horrific accident\\" ever witnessed and described it as \\"This is the nastiest and bloodiest of accidents on the highway\\".

Carried over from Late Night Many sketches originated on O'Brien's original show, Late Night with Conan O'Brien and were carried over to, and continued on The Tonight Show during O'Brien's short reign. The sketches include: *In the Year 3000 (originally as 2000 on Late Night) *Moral Outrage *Celebrity Survey *Noches de Pasion con Se√±or O'Brien *The Audiencey Awards *Movie Casting *Mike Merritt's Inner Thoughts *New Coins/Stamps *Photo Gallery *Hanging Out with Jordan Schlansky *Conan and Andy On The Aisle *Brian McCann on the Spot *Pender Sings *The Interrupter *Small Talk Moment Twitter Tracker In this sketch, Conan is interrupted by an overzealous announcer (voiced by show writer Brian McCann) while lamenting the increasing number of celebrities who are using Twitter. The announcer attempts to prove to Conan that celebrity tweets are exciting by reading some of his favorites, which all describe mundane activities or are bland statements. Some examples include Ashton Kutcher reporting that he is going to the grocery store, and Jennifer Love Hewitt saying that the weather is beautiful. The sketch is always accompanied by increasingly elaborate animations in which the bird from the Twitter logo is repeatedly killed. It also includes the announcer trying to persuade Conan to play a game by using a rhyming sentence in which he refers to him as CoCo. Past games have included Complete the Tweet, Trick or Tweet, and Beat the Tweet. On Thanksgiving, The Tonight Show celebrated Tweetsgiving, during which the announcer read celebrity twanks (tweets that give thanks). Christmas and Chanukah-themed tweets were read during the holiday season. The Tweetsgiving game was \\"Pilgrim or Pornstar?\\", where Conan had to guess if the following tweet was by a pilgrim or a porn star. Conan's Tabloid Moment Having acknowledged the higher profile that comes with being host of The Tonight Show, Conan schemes to beat the paparazzi at their own game by photographing himself in embarrassing situations and selling the pictures directly to the tabloids. To manufacture these moments, Conan makes use of a green screen and some inexpensive props. Past moments have included Conan running over a bible salesman, stealing underwear from Barbara Walters, loading a corpse into the trunk of a car, and kicking babies at a playground (all while drunk). Traffic Copter As Conan discusses L.A.'s chronic traffic problems, he calls for a view from The Tonight Show's traffic copter. The scene then shifts to a fake road filled with gridlocked toy cars. The cause of the traffic jam would always be something absurd, such as a dog celebrating its bar mitzvah, a marauding robot, or a giant Amy Winehouse passed out on the road. Based on a former sketch used on his previous show in similar fashion. Trump Properties After discussing something topical, Conan will present a video from Donald Trump. In the video, Trump divulges his plans as they relate to the topic. These plans always include constructing something ridiculously expensive, such as a parking space paved with imported marble or a resort on the moon. Andy'll Try It In this sketch, Andy is given a product to test and review. Past products have included Bacon vodka, a flaming bra worn by Lady Gaga, and a skydiving simulator. On one occasion, Andy was presented with a Tofurky and Gravy flavored Jones Soda. After refusing to try it, the sketch was renamed \\"Just Shut Up and Drink It\\" and the unpleasant task was passed along to LaBamba, who instantly gagged and regurgitated the beverage. Live Via Satellite After discussing an interesting news story, Conan would sometimes introduce a tangentially related guest who he would claim was appearing live via satellite. At the beginning of the interview Conan would often note the surprisingly good quality of the satellite feed or simply call the technology very expensive. In reality, the guest would actually be in front of a false wall or green screen just a few feet away from Conan and in full view of the studio audience. At the end of the interview, the guest would sometimes walk off camera while still in split-screen format and cross in front of Conan's camera, clearly demonstrating that he was there the whole time. Wax Fonzie and Wax Tom Cruise While visiting a warehouse full of poor quality celebrity wax figures, Conan identified two as his favorite and purchased them. One was of Henry Winkler as his Happy Days character Arthur Fonzarelli (whose hand positioning caused Conan to comment that he had just finished up at the urinal), and the other was a creepy-looking figure of Tom Cruise. Both wax figures made several appearances on the show. In addition to appearing in various places around the studio (such as at the urinal in the men's washroom), Wax Fonzie and Wax Tom Cruise were also spotted at the Los Angeles Lakers' 2009 NBA championship celebration and were incorporated into many recurring sketches on the show (such as an installment of \\"Conan's Tabloid Moment\\" where Wax Fonzie played a corpse and Wax Tom Cruise played a murderous accomplice). Both figures were routinely placed in dangerous situations and sustained damage. Wax Tom Cruise was decapitated and dismembered while testing out Universal's skydiving simulator during an installment of \\"Andy'll Try It\\". Meanwhile, Wax Fonzie was stabbed while acting as Conan's assistant during a knife-throwing segment. Both figures later were shot out of circus cannons. Wax Tom Cruise emerged unscathed, but Wax Fonzie landed on his face and was horribly mangled. When he was brought out at a later date as part of a \\"Prop Auction\\" sketch, the audience audibly gasped in amusement at his appearance. Wax Fonzie was last seen sitting in the car that was blown up at the conclusion of the \\"Conan, Please Blow Up My Car\\" contest, and was presumably destroyed after the explosion. Wax Tom Cruise was stationed nearby to say farewell. Wax Tom Cruise eventually returned during an installment of \\"America's New Oprah\\" and was made to re-enact the real Tom Cruise's infamous couch-jumping incident. Toward the end of the Tonight Show controversy in January, Wax Tom Cruise was featured on Twitter in a picture, wearing a \\"Team Conan\\" shirt. A Message from All On TV After reaching significant milestones in his career, Conan would present a message he claimed was sent to him from his peers in the television industry. The message would consist of a series of clips from various news and talk shows that had been spliced together to create the message to Conan. The message would usually close by insulting either Andy or Max. A Rebuttal from Conan's Father After Conan says something respectful and thoughtful about senior citizens, he will receive a video rebuttal message from his dad. In the message, Conan's dad belittles Conan's achievements and describes him as insincere and uncaring. He also notes how Conan pales in comparison to his older brother. It is sometimes even suggested that Conan's brother has died as a result of Conan's stupidity. Conan Visits His Neighbors Conan visits various businesses near the Universal Studios lot, poking fun at the bizarre establishments he finds. Past businesses have included a pornography studio, a tattoo parlor operated by a man named Freak Show, and a store that exclusively sells items decorated like the American flag. Wing Pang On August 7, 2009, a remote piece aired featuring Conan's visit to an NBC/Universal Studios Gift Shop. During the filming of the remote, Conan interviewed an NBC employee by the name of Wing Pang. Conan was visibly impressed by the man's natural comedic timing and sincere personality and the focus of the remote shifted from the NBC store to Wing Pang, himself. Directly after the airing of the segment, Conan brought Wing Pang on stage and thanked him for his participation in the remote. Wing Pang went on to make two more appearances, the first of which aired on Nov. 5 which was another remote piece featuring an interview between Conan and Wing followed by a fencing match between the two. Wing's third and final appearance was on Nov. 26, which was another remote, this time featuring Conan's Thanksgiving dinner with Wing as well as Jordan Schlansky and Pierre Bernard. Bon Voyage, Max Whenever Max Weinberg goes on tour with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, Conan will imply that Max must leave the show immediately in order to make his flight. The entire platform on which Max sits will then start moving as Max continues to drum. The motorized platform goes out into the street, presumably on its way to the airport. Various things might occur along the way, such as Max stopping at a drive-thru or Max being hit by a large truck. Checking in on Max in Europe In this sketch, Conan reveals that Max Weinberg has allowed a camera crew to follow him while touring in Europe with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. Conan then decides to check and see what Max is doing at that particular moment. A stock footage clip of a person involved in an altercation with police is then shown. The intent is for the audience to believe this person is Max. Tonight Show Tour-iffic Tram-tacular When their studio was added to the Universal Studios Tour, Conan acknowledged that it could not compete with the other stops on the tour. In order to compensate for this, Conan and Andy would act out exciting scenarios as the tour passed the studio. Past scenarios have included Conan delivering Andy's baby and Conan curing Andy's paralysis. Back Row Entertainment Feeling that those audience members seated at the back of the studio did not get as good an experience as those seated near the front in \\"the Cone Zone\\", Conan would arrange for some special entertainment in the back row. This entertainment was usually something underwhelming, such as a hamster race or a bodybuilder posing. Kiss Cam Inspired by a recent trip to Dodger Stadium, Conan introduces the concept of couples sharing a kiss when the camera settles on them. These sketches typically deviate from this standard formula by including several odd pairings, such as a hunter making out with a bear or a nerdy Harry Potter fan groping an imaginary woman. Conan and Andy Do Anime In response to the immense popularity of Japanese anime, Conan and Andy went to the studios of Bang Zoom! Entertainment to record voiceovers for some of their films. These voiceovers consisted primarily of improvising comical dialogue based on literal interpretations of the scenes. Dumbledore Goes Hollywood Following the release of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Conan reports that one the film's main actors has let success go to his head. Footage of Albus Dumbledore (played by Brian Stack) harassing partygoers in Hollywood is then played. Throughout the video, Dumbledore uses many Harry Potter-themed innuendoes, such as asking women if he can Slytherin to their Gryffindor. At the end of each sketch, Dumbledore is either beaten or pursued by the police and his mug shot is displayed. Shatner Recites Palin After former Alaska governor Sarah Palin used flowery language during her resignation speech (and later on her Twitter account), Conan called on William Shatner to recite some of her most poetic statements in a dramatic, exaggerated fashion reminiscent of his musical career. During these sketches, Shatner would be accompanied by Mike Merritt on bass and Ronnie Gutierrez or James Wormsworth on bongos. During one installment, after Shatner had read from Palin's autobiography, Palin appeared and read from Shatner's autobiography (which includes a description of riding an elephant in his underwear). In later occurrences, Shatner instead recited statements from Levi Johnston's Twitter account, which were crude and pointless rather than poetic. Conan's Fake Endorsements After mentioning that Oprah Winfrey is suing companies for using her name and image without permission, Conan claims to be a victim of similar unauthorized endorsements. He then shows a commercial made up of clips that were spliced together to give the impression he was endorsing a certain product (while making other inappropriate remarks). Conan would later admit that he would be okay with the endorsement if he was being paid for it. In one installment, Max claimed to be a victim of unauthorized endorsements as well, only to later admit that his endorsement of a male enhancement cream was legitimate. Puppies Dressed as Cats Conan gives his audience a Mini Dose of Joy by bringing out puppies that are wearing cat costumes. The sketch is accompanied by an annoyingly repetitive song. For Halloween, the sketch was changed to \\"Puppies Dressed as Frankensteins\\". For Thanksgiving, the sketch was changed to \\"Puppies Dressed as Thanksgiving Dinner\\". Clinton Chart 2009 proved to be a successful year for former President Bill Clinton and occasionally Conan would use a chart to illustrate fluctuations in his popularity. The chart consisted of a picture of Clinton and an arrow that was attached at his crotch. As positive statistics were presented, the arrow would thicken and elongate, simulating an erection. When negative statistics were presented, the arrow would shrink and shrivel up. Elmo PSAs In this sketch, a PSA featuring Elmo would be shown, in which his voice had been dubbed over. While his human counterparts offered sincere advice to children regarding ways to prevent the spread of illnesses (such as Swine Flu), Elmo would announce that death was inevitable and instead urge children to make peace with their God or to stay home and smoke cigarettes. Tonight Show PSAs In response to current events, the staff of the Tonight Show present a series of PSAs they have recorded. Following a pair of humorous messages from Conan and Andy, a third message is shown, which usually stars either Max or LaBamba. This final message features information that is just barely related to the subject matter being discussed. For example, Max recorded a Swine Flu PSA in which he suggested that everyone wear surgical masks, but only so women would have a harder time identifying him after he exposes himself to them on the subway. Similarly, LaBamba recorded an Environmentalism PSA in which he eats spaghetti from a dumpster and then simply shouts \\"Environment!\\" Conan's Hunky Vampire Assistant Due to the popularity of vampire-themed films and shows such as Twilight, True Blood, and The Vampire Diaries, Conan hired a vampire assistant named Cody Deveraux. Stereotypically brooding and overly dramatic, Cody's appearance is always accompanied by melancholy emo music. The sketches always end with Cody fleeing the studio in despair after receiving some mildly upsetting information. Once outside, sunlight causes Cody to ignite, leaving only a pile of charred clothes on the sidewalk. After one such appearance (and subsequent death), Tonight Show announcer Andy Richter questioned Cody's ability to repeatedly die, only to later reappear unharmed. Cody's true fate was then revealed, as he was shown backstage drinking coffee and smoking a cigarette. In later occurrences of the sketch, Cody becomes distraught upon learning that Conan has hired additional assistants based on popular films. This included hiring a zombie due to the popularity of Zombieland, hiring an invisible presence due to the popularity of Paranormal Activity, hiring a wolf boy due to the popularity of The Twilight Saga: New Moon, hiring a football player due to the popularity of The Blind Side, and hiring a Na'vi after the success of Avatar. Another assistant to appear alongside Cody was Frankenstein's monster (played by Brian Stack) from Late Night with Conan O'Brien. In one skit, Jerry Springer was called in to break up a fight between Cody and Wolf Boy. When Cody inevitably committed suicide, Jerry followed suit, revealing that he, too, had been a vampire all along. New Trends Conan takes the time to let his viewers know what is in and what is out for the coming season. The items that are out are usually a bizarre variation of a current trend, such as being touched by an iPod salesman rather than buying an iPod Touch. High Definition Wizard of Oz Following the release of The Wizard of Oz in High Definition, Conan complained that the film had been ruined. He then presented examples of scenes that had been worsened by the incredible level of detail. These scenes included things that had supposedly gone unnoticed in previous versions of the film, such as the Cowardly Lion's penis or a smoking munchkin. LA Weather Update During a time when Los Angeles was experiencing light rain, Conan's commentary about the weather would be interrupted by updates from a weather reporter (played by Brian McCann). The weather reporter was often surrounded by individuals who reacted to the rain in extreme fashion, such as emergency crews, a robotic mop, and roving bands of warriors. The sketches were meant to exaggerate Los Angeles residents' fear of the rain. New Smoky Ads When the United States Forest Service released new ads featuring Smoky the Bear, Conan noted their aggressive tone and disturbing content. He then presented the ads, in which Smoky's voice had been dubbed over. In each installment, Smoky would confront someone who was being careless with fire and threaten to do terrible things to them, like bury them alive or bite off their genitals. Andy's Motorized Podium Inspired by a man who garnered media attention for motorizing his recliner, Andy revealed that he'd motorized the podium from which he watches each episode. For the next few moments Andy would pilot his podium around the stage, often cutting in front of the camera and distracting Conan as he attempts to continue with the show. America's New Oprah Following the announcement that Oprah Winfrey's talk show would be concluding in 2011, Conan dubbed himself the new Oprah and commanded his audience to buy obscure products. His recommendations included the 1974 made-for-TV movie Killdozer, a calendar of extraordinary chickens, and an album of music from action film star Steven Seagal. Conan would later refer to the Amazon.com pages for these items to prove that customers had indeed been purchasing them together. On one occasion, Max was called upon to provide relationship advice in the style of Dr. Phil. Max happily reminded viewers to ask prostitutes if they are actually cops before requesting services. Other past recommendations have included Cool as Ice, several films from the Leprechaun franchise, Troll 2, and a Christmas-themed VHS starring Kathie Lee Gifford (which was so terrible that Conan revoked his recommendation). Sucking up to Comcast After NBC had been purchased by Comcast, Conan would announce that no jokes would be made at his new employers' expense, opting instead to list the various accomplishments that made them worthy of respect. Andy, sometimes wearing Comcast merchandise, would offer similar sentiments. At the end of the sketch, LaBamba would usually be called upon to provide his opinion of Comcast, but would instead announce something childish and unrelated, such as \\"I like pancakes!\\" Tiger Woods Joke Caddy Following the revelation that Tiger Woods had been cheating on his wife with several different women, Conan insisted that he needed professional help to determine which of the numerous possible jokes he should tell with regards to Woods' infidelities. A caddy would then enter, carrying with him a golf bag full of cue cards. After evaluating the audience for things such as temperature and wind speed, the caddy would select a joke for Conan to read. Prior to the reading of the joke, Andy would comment on the situation in the hushed voice of a golf announcer. During one installment, Conan and his caddy were interrupted by Bob Saget, who appeared with his own joke caddy and asked to play through. Sketches introduced during the Tonight Show conflict=Classic Tonight Show Moment In the weeks leading to O'Brien's departure following a seven-month tenure, Conan began showing \\"classic\\" moments from their seven months at The Tonight Show. The sketch was a joke, as a show usually runs for a number of years before it starts showing classic clips, rather than a few months, as was Conan's tenure as host. Such sketches included: when the wax figures of Tom Cruise and Fonzie were shot from a cannon, or Tom Hanks was hit with a meteorite. Conan asks why one of the vignettes in the opening shows him suffering a concussion. Writer Deon Cole Saying that one of the staff members wants to share his thoughts about what is happening, Conan introduces writer Deon Cole, who described, in successive episodes, how Conan is a ho, a pimp, or black, asking Conan such questions as \\"Has Charlie Sheen/Paris Hilton ever been on your couch?\\" The routine ends with the word of the day (such as \\"BLACK MAN\\" or \\"PIMP\\") being stamped over Conan's face, similar to the \\"Ass\\" stamp. I Put The Tonight Show on Craigslist Saying, \\"I do not know if I'm even legally allowed to do this, but screw it,\\" Conan says he put The Tonight Show up for sale on Craigslist, and shows the \\"real\\" responses he received, and that these are real photos of what was offered, such as a 1970 AMC Gremlin, or someone's brother. No element of The Tonight Show was actually sold. Crazy Expensive Comedy Bits During the final week of his Tonight Show tenure, Conan decided to unveil new characters that were designed to be more expensive than funny since NBC is required to pay for everything used in the show's segments. The first night, Conan introduced the 'Bugatti Veyron Mouse', an actual model of the car dressed in mouse whiskers and ears accompanied by the master recording of The Rolling Stones '(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction' at a purported cost of $1.5 million. In reality, the car was donated for use by the Petersen Automotive Museum, however NBC was forced to remove all web clips of the sketch from its website and Hulu in order to avoid paying the royalty fees for 'Satisfaction'. The following night, Conan acquired 2009 Kentucky Derby winner Mine That Bird, dressed the horse in a mink Snuggie and had it watch restricted NFL Super Bowl coverage at a purported cost of $4.8 million. Repeated viewings by internet viewers revealed though that the horse was similar looking stand-in and that the football footage shown was actually from the USFL. The final show featured a purchased fossil of a ground sloth from the Smithsonian spraying an original Picasso with beluga caviar at a cost of $65 million. After this, Conan addressed the fact that internet users believed the purchases to be real, stating that they were all supposed to be obvious fakes.

The reverse depicts an oath: a Samnite (left) and Roman (right) touch with their swords a pig held by a kneeling man, who is about to sacrifice the animal in order to sanctify the oath. The gens Veturia, originally Vetusia, was an ancient patrician family of the Roman Republic. According to tradition, the armourer Mamurius Veturius lived in the time of Numa Pompilius, and made the sacred ancilia. The Veturii occur regularly in the Fasti Consulares of the early Republic, with Gaius Veturius Geminus Cicurinus holding the consulship in 499 BC. Like other old patrician gentes, the Veturii also developed plebeian branches. The family declined in the later Republic, with the last consular Veturius holding office in 206 BC, during the Second Punic War.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 1251 (\\"Veturia Gens\\", \\"Veturius Mamurius\\"). Origin The nomen Veturius belongs to a class of gentilicia in which the old, medial 's' has been replaced by 'r', as in Valesius, Fusius, Papisius, and Numesius, which in later times were Valerius, Furius, Papirius, and Numerius.Chase, p. 127. Some scholars suppose, both from the fact that Mamurius Veturius had two gentile names, and from his connection with Numa, that the Veturii were of Sabine origin; but Chase classifies the name with those that were either of Latin origin, or which cannot be shown to have originated elsewhere; he derives the name from vetus, \\"old\\".Chase, pp. 129‚Äì133. Veturia was one of the 35 tribes of Rome, principally named after ancient patrician families, but it was originally spelled Voturia, perhaps an initial variant of the name. Lily Ross Taylor mentions that the gens were from the region of Ostia, on the left bank of the Tiber, as there was a shrine of the Veturii there.Taylor, Voting Districts, pp. 42, 265. Praenomina The main praenomina of the Veturii were Gaius, Titus, Spurius, and Lucius, but there are also examples of Publius, Tiberius, Marcus, and Postumus. Publius seems to have been one of the earliest names of this gens, but it does not appear in later generations, while Tiberius and Marcus appear in one family of the Veturii Crassi. Lucius, which seems to have been the dominant praenomen of the later Veturii, first appears in the second century of the Republic. Postumus was an uncommon praenomen, presumably because its original meaning, \\"hindmost, last\\", referring to a youngest child, was easily confused with the similar sounding post humus, \\"after burial\\", with the implication that the child's father was dead. Branches and cognomina The main family of the Veturii bore the cognomen Cicurinus, which the antiquarian Varro derived from cicur, quiet or patient. The Veturii who occur in the fasti from the outset of the Republic to the middle of the fifth century BC bore the additional surname of Geminus, a twin. From the time of the Decemvirs, this surname was replaced by Crassus, thick, sometimes with the implication of \\"dull\\" or \\"stupid\\". The Veturii Cicurini flourished down to the middle of the fourth century BC. Calvinus, bald or balding, occurs in the latter part of the fourth century BC, after which the Veturii fell into obscurity until the Second Punic War, when the surname Philo, one of the earliest cognomina borrowed from Greek, briefly appears. After this, the Veturii vanish from the consular fasti.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, p. 586 (\\"Titus Veturius Calvinus\\"), 747, 748 (\\"Cicurinus\\"), vol. III, p. 298 (\\"Veturius Philo\\"). The last Veturii appearing in history came from the Sempronii Gracchi, whose cognomen they adopted; they were thus plebeian. Coins of this gens bear no cognomen. One curious example, issued by Tiberius Veturius Gracchus, depicts the head of a helmeted man on the obverse, and on the reverse, two men with staves and swords, on either side of a kneeling man holding a pig. The coin seems to commemorate a treaty, but the precise occasion is unknown.Joseph Hilarius Eckhel, Doctrina Numorum Veterum, v. 337. Michael Crawford suggests that the coin depicts an oath, adding that it might be a reference to the treaty made by Titus Veturius Calvinus with the Samnites at the Caudine Forks, as an example of Roman integrity.Crawford, \\"Foedus and Sponsio\\", pp. 1‚Äì7. He also links the scene depicted to the treaty of 137 negotiated by Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus‚Äîthe moneyer's cousin‚Äîduring the Numantine War, although this view is disputed.Stannard, \\"Numismatic evidence\\", pp. 47‚Äì80.

It was originally drawn very broadly, including all ferns that had sori apparently \\"acrostichoid\\", or distributed in a uniform mass across the back of the frond, rather than organized in discrete sori. This led Linnaeus to include such species as Asplenium platyneuron in the genus, because the specimen he received had sori so crowded that it appeared acrostichoid. Since Acrostichum aureum is regarded as the type for the genus, it is now narrowly circumscribed only to the natural genus of three species, that are allied to the genus Ceratopteris. They are collectively known as the leather ferns or leather swamp ferns, genus members commonly being found in swamps. The species of Acrostichum are massive ferns, with fronds up to 12 feet (3.5 meters) tall, that depend on a semi- aquatic existence. They do not withstand prolonged immersion, but require wet roots. The species Acrostichum aureum is known to have a high saltwater tolerance, growing in mangroves.

Located near Mechanicsburg, it lies on a small ridge in a pasture field in southeastern Union Township. In 1974, the mound was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a potential archaeological site, primarily because of its use as a burial mound. Archaeology of Champaign County The valleys of the Scioto and Miami rivers were rich with prehistoric earthworks when whites settled Ohio.Mills, William C. Archeological Atlas of Ohio. Columbus: Ohio State Archeological and Historical Society, 1914. Champaign County lies midway between these rivers,DeLorme. Ohio Atlas & Gazetteer. 7th ed. Yarmouth: DeLorme, 2004, 55-57. . and accordingly its earthworks are fewer than those of the counties located along those two rivers. A 1914 study observed only six mounds and a total of eighteen archaeological sites countywide, in contrast to thirty-three mounds and a total of fifty-nine sites in Logan County to the north, and twenty-two mounds and a total of ninety-six sites in Miami County to the west. Unknown to this survey was the Carl Potter Mound: although it is one of several mounds and many burial sites that have been recorded on a single farm in Union Township, the only sites observed by the survey were located in the western part of the township. Nearby investigations In the late nineteenth century, a kame in the farm's barnyard was excavated for gravel and found to contain multiple burials and artifacts, which have since been assessed as dating from the Cole period. Also located on the Potter farm is the site of a smaller mound, known as \\"Hodge Mound I.\\" Intensive cultivation over the mound has reduced it to ground level; its location can only be observed when the site is plowed, at which time remnants of charcoal can be seen in the newly cultivated soil. In contrast, the Potter Mound is not plowed; although it has been reduced in height by cultivation in the past, the site is no longer being so used. During the 1930s, a group of young boys decided to dig into the Potter Mound; their primitive investigation yielded a group of bones and a grooved stone axe. No other excavations, whether crude or rigorous, have been conducted since that time: accordingly, it is believed that the mound still contains burials and other artifacts. This axe alone is insufficient to identify the builders of the mound: grooved axes have been discovered both at early Adena sites and at the sites of the earlier Late Archaic period. Nevertheless, it is believed that the mound was built by the Adena, due to its location: like the Potter mound, many confirmed Adena sites are located on small ridges near brooks. If the mound were built by an Adena group, it is likely the work of a clan that was isolated from the main Adena regions in the Scioto River valley to the east. Preservation In 1970, Ohio State University archaeologist Stephen C. Koleszar carried out a survey of archaeological sites in southwestern Ohio. Although six mounds had been recorded in Champaign County in 1914 ‚Äî not including the Potter mound ‚Äî only three mounds, including the Potter mound, were still in existence by 1970. Four years later, the Potter mound was added to the National Register of Historic Places as part of a preservation effort. As part of its nomination to the Register, it was designated the \\"Carl Potter Mound\\" for its owner, Carl Potter; its previous name of \\"Hodge Mound\\" is a reference to a former owner, James A. Hodge. See also * List of burial mounds in the United States ReferencesFurther reading *Koleszar, Stephen C. An Archaeological Survey of Southwestern Ohio. Columbus: Ohio Historical Society, 1970.

Abdagus, Duke of Frisia, appointed by Louis the German, headed in 873 the Frisians against the Danes, who had invaded Frisia under the Danish leader Rudolf, and destroyed and plundered large parts of the country. The battle was fierce, but Rudolf fell early with 500 compatriots (or 800, the sources disagree on this). The remainder fled to a stronghold, where they were besieged by the Frisians. One Norman, who had converted to Christianity and lived amongst the Frisians, and who has been said to have been Roruk, Rudolf's uncle, convinced them to end the siege and sign a pact. The Danes promised to return their plunder and never to return to the territory of King Louis. Theerafter, the sieged were allowed to return to their ships, keeping a few as hostages to maintain the pact.

PSV schemes became popular after 2000 when forces were expanding and needed to be more connected to the community. At the start few forces had a civilian volunteer scheme but by 2010, 32 of the 43 police forces have PSV schemes. In the UK there are over 6,250 volunteers, who contribute over 500,000 hours a year voluntarily. It is estimated that the number of PSV's will increase by 70% next year to over 10,000 volunteers. The first PSV scheme was started in 1992 by Kent Police. South Wales Police run a similar scheme alongside PSV, called Police Student Volunteer, a scheme that encourages students to help local policing teams.http://www.ourbobby.com/en/content/cms/Volunteer/Police_Student_Volun/Police_Student_Volun.aspx  Duties  PSV's generally take on office based roles such as administration assistants or operations assistants, with tasks including paperwork, computer- based work, CCTV operators, Police Information Point assistant or frontdesk duties. However, if a PSV has specific skills that can be applied to an alternative role they could find themselves redesignated to a role that benefits from their talents such as roadside camera operations, photographic sections, force counsellor or force chaplain.  Recruitment  23 of the 32 participating forces have a dedicated paid PSV manager or co-ordinator that manages and recruits volunteer on request from the requiring department. The recruitment process for PSV's involves an application form and an informal interview where the candidate will usually meet their supervisor. New recruits have no formal training, they have inductions that are specific to their role, and they have no formal uniform, although they are unofficially expected to dress respectfully. Due to the sensitive nature of a PSV's placement they are required to sign the Official Secrets Act and the Data Protection Act, and are expected to behave honourably whilst on and off duty.  Benefits  The benefits of being a volunteer can include a chance to help out in the local community, benefit the police service the PSV is volunteering for, to gain work experience, particularly in a police environment and to gain an insight into the police service the PSV is volunteering for. Although being a PSV has no official direct advantage in regards to career progression, it shows dedication and experience with the police service.  Disambiguation  PSV's are not to be confused with Special Constables, who are also volunteers, the difference being that 'specials' are frontline police and have the powers of arrest which PSV's do not have. PSV's are also not to be confused with civilian employees of police forces who do similar work, the difference being that they are paid for the work they do. This distinction is important as not to give the illusion that volunteers will be paid or receive any benefits that employees do.  Similar programmes  * United States has a similar programme called Volunteers in Police Service, that allows volunteers to help out local law enforcement agencies. The scheme comes under the Citizen Corps programme of President Barack Obama, which comes under the USA Freedom Corps initiative of President George W. Bush. This program focuses on co-ordinating volunteers to create safe and strong that are ready to deal with large scale emergencies and terrorism.http://www.policevolunteers.org/about/ * Australia has some police forces, particularly New South Wales Police, with programmes called Volunteers in Policing. The program is very similar to the British counterpart except volunteers wear a uniform of blue shirt and black trousers.

In 1941, Szymoniak earned a bachelor's degree in education and speech pathology from the University of Wisconsin. She married Casimir (Chuck) D. Szymoniak on December 7, 1943. Together they were to raise five children. Career She worked in public school systems in the states of Wisconsin, New York and Kansas before moving to Iowa in the 1950s after her husband's military service came to an end. She also put her skills to use in the medical field, at one point working at Army Hospital Aural Rehabilitation Center in Oklahoma. Elaine was a speech and hearing specialist, counselor, and administrator for the Iowa Department of Vocational Rehabilitation from 1957 to 1988 and she was dedicated to working for the benefit of those with disabilities. She actively worked with the deaf community and at one time was the state's sole rehab counselor for the deaf. In 1977, Elaine earned her master's degree in family environment from Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. Purportedly, an avid outdoor enthusiast, Elaine canoed and whitewater rafted throughout the West with a group of women called the River Spirits. She loved sleeping outside under the stars, walking in the woods, and learned to pilot a whitewater raft when she was 77. Political life She served on the Des Moines City Council from 1977 to 1988 representing the First Ward. Szymoniak won a seat on her first attempt by defeating a twelve-year incumbent. She was the second woman to ever serve on the City Council and the only woman serving during her time on the council. As a member of the Des Moines City Council she worked to meet the needs of her constituents with a special emphasis in economic development, equality, and justice. She unsuccessfully campaigned to become the mayor of Des Moines in 1979 and again in 1987. Following eleven consecutive years on the Des Moines City Council, Szymoniak set her goals on a different political office and started campaigning for the State Senate. In the Iowa State Senate from 1988 to 2000, Szymoniak has represented both the forty-second and thirty-sixth districts. Szymoniak‚Äôs main areas of concern while serving in public office were in health, education and human resources. This is reflected in the committees she served on in the Senate: Appropriations Committee on Human Services (vice- chair), Education, Human Resources (chair), Judiciary, Local Government and the Ways and Means Committee Many of the bills that she authored and sponsored concerned education, family welfare, or care of the elderly and disabled. Szymoniak played a key role in revamping Iowa's Welfare System in the early 1990s. Reported on the Iowa State University website is the following information: \\"One of her more significant events as a State Senator was to shepherd through the Senate Iowa's Welfare Reform efforts of 1993. In her typical fashion, she read about an idea and decided Iowa was the place to attempt such a reform. She organized a process to design a program based upon the needs and expectations of Iowans. She played an active role in keeping all parties at the table and in finally passing the Iowa Human Investment Act with no dissenting votes in the Senate.\\" Elaine was known for her significant public service including crafting the legislation that funded and brought the World Food Prize to Iowa. She served on many nonprofit boards of directors or was a member of The Chrysalis Foundation, Iowa Council for International Understanding, United Way, Girl Scouts, the Nexus Executive Women's Alliance, and the Task Force for Iowa's Responsible Fathers program. She received numerous honors including the YWCA Woman of Achievement and she was inducted into the Iowa Women's Hall of Fame in 1999. While acknowledging anguish on the issue, Szymoniak, a devout Roman Catholic, believed that abortion was a matter that should be left up to the conscience of the individual woman. A parental notification bill on abortion passed in the Iowa House of Representatives in 1994 and Szymoniak kept the bill in committee once it reached the Senate. A few lauded her for political savvy, but most criticized the move as an attempt of three committee members to forestall legislation by denying the Senate an opportunity to vote for or against the bill. At the end of her legislative term in 2000, Szymoniak did not seek re-election. Additional information A 1992 Des Moines Register editorial endorsing her re-election summed up Szymoniak's political service: \\"Szymoniak has been an extremely hardworking, dedicated and conscientious lawmaker who is regarded at the Statehouse as one of the more effective legislators.\\" \\"She is a woman who has done it all ‚Äî she has been a wonderful, successful mother; has had a career; has been a dedicated volunteer and public servant; and has been a mentor and a role model. She is a woman who has truly made a difference.\\"‚ÄîConnie Wimer, 1991 Recreational interests: Travel, Camping, Canoeing, Whitewater rafting, Reading.

They were descendants of the Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi who was consul in 133 BC and who established the addition of Frugi as an agnomen that was passed down through the family.Anna A. Novokhatko, The Invectives of Sallust and Cicero (de Gruyter, 2009), p. 183. The Calpurnii Pisones who distinguished themselves by the name Frugi were one of three main branches of Pisones active from the mid-2nd century BC into the 1st century AD.The other two were the Pisones Caesonini descended from the Lucius Calpurnius Piso who was consul in 148 BC, and the branch descended from Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, the consul of 139 BC; Edward Champlin, \\"The Life and Times of Calpurnius Piso,\\" Museum Helveticum 46 (1989), pp. 119‚Äì120. There were four unbroken generations who kept the name Frugi, but the nomenclature of the family line is complicated by adoption in adulthood, a practice of elite Roman families to preserve their heritage, religious traditions (sacra gentilicia), influence and property. One member of this family line (who became the praetor of 112 BC) had been adopted by a Marcus Pupius, and also used the name Marcus Pupius combined with Piso Frugi. His name was rendered Marcus Pupius Piso Frugi Calpurnianus. The name Frugi was used for three more generations, in one case again kept by an adoptee. A fifth-generation descendant of the praetor adopted by M. Pupius went back to using the original form Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi, along with Licinianus in reference to a grandfather's adopted name.Stephen Wilson, The Meaning of Naming: A Social and Cultural History of Personal Naming in Western Europe (UCL Press, 1998), p. 13.

He made five Scottish Cup appearances for the club. Early life William McBeath was born in Callander, Perthshire on 7 May 1856; the third of four children to Peter and Jane McBeath (although the youngest child did not survive past infancy). McBeath also had a further four half-brothers and sisters from his father's previous relationships. At age eight, soon after the death of his father; William's mother moved with William and his older sister Jane to Glasgow, no doubt attracted by the rapidly expanding industrial city. The census of 1871 lists William, then aged fourteen, as an assistant salesman and living on Cleveland Street in the Sandyford area of Glasgow and close to five members of the McNeil family, two of whom would later join with McBeath and Peter Campbell to form Glasgow Rangers. Playing career In 1872, McBeath along with three friends Peter Campbell (15), Peter McNeil (the oldest at 17) and Moses McNeil saw a group of men playing football on Glasgow Green's Flesher's Haugh. Indeed, the club's first game was played at Flesher's Haugh against a now-defunct Glasgow team named Callander, which resulted in a 0‚Äì0 draw. His exertions in the game were said to have been so great and taxing on his fitness, that he spent the next week 'laid up' in bed.\\"Rangers: The forgotten history\\" Herald (20 August 2009) McBeath was listed in the Roll of Office Bearers as the first president of the club for the 1874‚Äì75 season. He played his last game for Rangers in November 1875 and left the club soon after. Private life In 1878, at the age of 22, William McBeath married Jeannie Yates Harris (21). They had three children, William Duncanson McBeath (born 1880), Agnes Isabella (1882), Norman Douglas (1890). In 1881 the family had moved from Glasgow to Bristol; however some time after 1893 the family unit had collapsed and there is little or no trace of Jeannie and the young family, and preciously little of William (Sr). A hard life began to befall William with accusation of fraud arising in 1896 which resulted in trial in 1897. He was cleared of falsely selling advertisements for a newspaper that was never distributed. He soon married in 1898, but this was most likely a bigamous marriage.\\"Revealed: The curse of the Rangers pioneers\\" Daily Record (14 July 2009) as no evidence exists of a divorce. William lived the majority of his later years in a Poorhouse in Lincoln, branded an \\"imbecile\\", although today he would have been probably diagnosed as suffering from Alzheimer's disease. McBeath died on Sunday 15 July 1917 aged 61; he had spent his last seven years in the poorhouse. He was buried in an unmarked grave in a Lincoln cemetery. Legacy The headstone of William McBeath 1 May 2018 Willam McBeath's contribution to the creation of Rangers Football Club was not considered to be as celebrated or honoured as much as the other founding members of the club. His grave remained unmarked at the back end of a Lincolnshire cemetery until a Rangers fan placed a solitary Saltire and a simple plaque bearing the inscription: \\"In this place lies William McBeath who in 1872, Along with three friends, had an idea to start a football Team. That team became Rangers F.C.\\" In summer 2010, members of the Rangers supporters' internet forum Vanguardbears bought a 50-year lease on the grave, thanks to co-operative Lincoln City Council, and purchased and dedicated a gravestone to honour McBeath and his final resting place.\\"Glasgow Rangers pioneer buried in city\\", This is Lincolnshire, 27 July 2009 On 22 February 2010, William McBeath was inducted into the Rangers Hall Of Fame alongside Lorenzo Amoruso, Derek Parlane, Ian McMillan and George Brown.

He was the first Pentecostal Holiness recording artist to be signed to a major recording label for strictly sacred music and songs.Ely II, Macel. \\"Ain't No Grave: The Life & Legacy of Brother Claude Ely.\\" (2010) Atlanta: Dust-to-Digital. Receiving fame for his song \\"There Ain‚Äôt No Grave (Gonna Hold My Body Down)\\", Ely's musical style and spiritual influence still exist today among both secular and sacred music enthusiasts. Although Bozie Sturdivant was the first to record Brother Claude Ely's tune in 1941 with the help of the US Library of Congress' field recordings, Ely had written the song in 1934. King Records of Cincinnati helped Brother Claude Ely copyright the song in 1953. Many Hollywood entertainers and musical artists have acknowledged their admiration and fascination for Brother Claude Ely. Often music historians attest that other musical artists cite Brother Claude Ely as having been a positive influence on their works as well. Elvis' mother Gladys brought Elvis Presley to Ely's tent revivals. Artists recording Brother Claude Ely's songs include Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash. Robert Duvall's self-produced movie entitled The Apostle also integrated Brother Claude Ely's music on its soundtrack. Ely pastored various churches in Kentucky, Virginia and the Cincinnati, Ohio area. Ely also hosted a radio program entitled \\"The Gospel Ranger Show\\", which aired across the southeastern portion of the United States. Many of Ely's religious followers and numerous admirers still exist today in the Appalachian mountains. Ely's great nephew Dr. Macel Ely II wrote an official biography on Brother Claude Ely's life. The book is based upon oral history ascertained from over 1,000 personal interviews Dr. Ely conducted with musical artists, ministers, and Appalachian residents who remembered the singer/preacher. The book is a \\"set\\" consisting of the earlier mentioned book and a music CD. The set, entitled Ain't No Grave: The Life & Legacy of Brother Claude Ely, was released in 2010 by Dust-to-Digital out of Atlanta, Georgia. American VI: Ain't No Grave is a posthumous album by Johnny Cash. It was released on February 23, 2010, just three days before what would have been Cash's 78th birthday. Using Brother Claude Ely's song \\"Ain't No Grave\\" as the title track, the LA Times reports that the song would have been Johnny Cash's last recorded song before his death.

Pioneer While living in Illinois, Ricks met missionaries from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (LDS Church) and was baptized in 1841. He eventually moved to Nauvoo, Illinois to be with other members of his faith. Later persecutions forced him to leave Nauvoo and join the Mormon Pioneers in a migration to the Salt Lake Valley. Utah life Ricks helped lead his pioneer company and arrived in Bountiful in September 1848. He began farming in Centerville, and later started a tannery in Farmington. In 1852 he married another wife. He moved his family to Logan, Utah in 1859, where he continued tanning and was involved with the area's first sawmill and gristmill. Ricks was active in the early Cache Valley community and helped establish the city of Logan.

She had briefly sailed as Princesa for the Spanish Navy, until her capture off Cape Finisterre in 1740 during the War of the Austrian Succession. After being chased down and captured by three British ships, she was acquired for service by the Royal Navy. Her design and fighting qualities excited considerable interest, and sparked a series of increases in the dimensions of British warships. She went on to serve under a number of commanders in several theatres of the War of the Austrian Succession, including the Mediterranean, where she was at the Battle of Toulon, and in the Caribbean and off the North American coast. She was then laid up and being assessed, was not reactivated for service during the Seven Years' War. She was instead reduced to a hulk at Portsmouth, in which capacity she lasted out both the Seven Years' War and the American War of Independence, being sold for breaking up in 1784, shortly after the end of the latter conflict, after a career in British service lasting 44 years. Spanish career and capture 8 April 1740 Princesa was built in 1730 in the shipyard of El Astillero, Guarnizo in Cantabriahttps://cvc.cervantes.es/actcult/museo_naval/sala3/navios/navios_03.htm, being nominally rated at 70 guns, but carrying 64. On 25 March 1740 news reached the Admiralty that two Spanish ships had sailed from Buenos Aires, and were bound for Spain. Word was sent to Portsmouth and a squadron of three ships, consisting of the 70-gun ships , and , under the command of Captain Colvill Mayne of Lenox, were prepared to intercept them. The ships, part of Sir John Balchen's fleet were briefly joined by and , and the squadron sailed from Portsmouth at 3 am on 29 March, passing down the English Channel. Rippon and St Albans fell astern on 5 April, and though Mayne shortened sail, they did not come up. On 8 April Mayne's squadron was patrolling some 300 miles south-west of The Lizard when a ship was sighted to the north. The British came up and found her to be Princesa, carrying 64 guns and a crew of 650 under the command of Don Parlo Augustino de Gera. They began to chase her at 10 am, upon which she lowered the French colours she had been flying and hoisted Spanish ones. Mayne addressed his men saying 'When you received the pay of your country, you engaged yourselves to stand all dangers in her cause. Now is the trial; fight like men for you have no hope but in your courage.' After a chase lasting two and a half hours, the British were able to come alongside and exchange broadsides, which eventually left the Spanish ship disabled. The British then raked her until she struck her colours. The Spanish ship had casualties of 33 killed and around 100 wounded, while eight men were killed aboard both Kent and Orford, and another one aboard Lenox. Total British wounded amounted to 40, and included Captain Durell of Kent, who had one of his hands shot away. The commander of Orford during the engagement had been Lord Augustus FitzRoy. According to the Spanish version of the facts, the ship Princesa was seriously damaged before the combat. The Spanish ship Princesa begun a hard battle against the three English ships chasing her. The combat lasted six hours. Princesa caused serious damages to Lenox and obliged Kent to leave the battle, but could not face the encounter against Orford and surrendered. There were 70 killed and 80 wounded on board Princesa, which was taken to Portsmouth for reparation. Afterward, she was used by the Royal Navy. British service Princesa was brought into Portsmouth on 8 May 1740. An Admiralty order of 21 April 1741 authorised her purchase, and this was duly done on 14 July 1741 for the sum of ¬£5,418.11.6¬æd. After a great repair she was fitted at Portsmouth between July 1741 and March 1742, for a total sum of ¬£36,007.2.10d. Her spirited resistance to three ships of equal rating attracted much comment. A contemporary description noted that she was larger than any British first rate and carried unusually large guns, many of them brass. She was described as the finest ship in the Spanish Navy, with her high build allowing her to open her lower gunports in conditions in which her opponents could not. The Admiralty finally had the ammunition to rouse Parliament from its complacency and fund a series of increases in British warship dimensions. Engraving of the Battle of Toulon Princess was commissioned under her first commander, Captain Perry Mayne, in July 1741. He was succeeded in 1743 by Captain Robert Pett, who took her out to the Mediterranean in December that year. She was part of Admiral Thomas Mathews' fleet at the Battle of Toulon on 14 February 1744. She came under the temporary command of Commander John Donkley in July 1745, though he was soon replaced by Captain Joseph Lingen, all the while continuing in the Mediterranean. Thomas Philpot took command in 1746, and Princess sailed for the Leeward Islands with Admiral George Townshend. Captain John Cokburne took over in July 1746 and Princess first sailed to Louisbourg and then home after a gale. She became the flagship of Admiral Richard Lestock later in 1746 and was present at the operations off Lorient from 20 to 25 September 1746. In May 1747 Captain the Hon. Augustus Hervey took over command, and sailed to the Mediterranean, where in October 1747 she briefly became the flagship of Vice- Admiral John Byng. Later years Princess was paid off in November 1748. She was surveyed the following year, but no repairs were reported. After a period laid up and inactive, she was reported to be unfit for service on 15 November 1755; she was converted to a hulk at Portsmouth between August 1759 and July 1761. She was recommissioned in 1759 under Captain Edward Barber, and continued as a hulk during the Seven Years' War and the American War of Independence. Princess was finally sold at Portsmouth on 30 December 1784.

Constructed in 1965, the observatory is a red brick building with a 16-inch Cassegrain reflector optical telescope. It is used for several community events and is regularly open for public viewing on Thursday nights. Originally the observatory was home to a 20‚Äù telescope, given to the department by an avid amateur who lived in central Massachusetts. It was a 1/10 scale model (loosely) of a larger 200‚Äù scope. Eventually, a crack was spotted during one of the re-aluminizings of the 20‚Äù mirror and the scope was no more. In the meantime, the department had been granted money associated with its move from Hasbrouck to the Grad Research Tower to buy a small telescope and put in on top of the GRC. The GRC had a small \\"isolation\\" pad built on its roof, which was supposed to be a mount for the scope, which could be accessed via a small open elevator. However, the GRC had terrible noise and gross vibration problems. The isolation pad never worked and there were too many safety concerns about using the roof of the building for observing. A 16\\" telescope was later bought from Competition Associates (a racing car company). That scope arrived in 1976 but because of the problems with using the top of the GRC, the scope was never mounted there. In fact, it sat in the basement of Hasbrouck for perhaps 10 years, becoming known as the \\"Subterranean Telescope.‚Äù This situation finally led to the 20\\" being disassembled and the 16\\" scope being moved to Orchard Hill and installed in the dome there. The 16\\" was a major improvement in usability. As to what happened to the 20\\", the mirror may have been stored in the Astronomy Research Facility but the drive was most likely not kept. Special thanks to Professor Thomas Arny for much of the recent history of the facility. Hours The observatory does not have a regular schedule.  Administration  It is maintained and operated by the UMass Astronomy Department. The observatory is supported by members of the Five College Astronomy Club.

Five College Astronomy Club The Five College Astronomy Club is a club for those interested in astronomy, regardless of major. The club utilizes the Orchard Hill Observatory to host observing nights on clear Wednesday and Thursday nights. The club also travels to other observatories, planetariums, and other sites of interest related to astronomy. The club spans between the Five Colleges (UMass Amherst, Amherst College, Hampshire College, Smith College, and Mount Holyoke College) to further their experiences and connect with other students who share their interest in astronomy. The club sometimes hosts informational sessions geared towards students looking to propel into research positions or achieve specific academic goals within the astronomy major. However, the main objective of the club is to have fun and meet other people with a shared interest in astronomy. * Meets: Thursday Nights at 7:00PM Usually in LGRT 1033 OR Clear Wednesday and Thursday Nights at dusk at the Orchard Hill Observatory * Chartered: Fall 2011 https://umassamherst.collegiatelink.net/organization/astronomy_club/about Five College Astronomy Department The Five College Astronomy Department is a collaborative program of Amherst College, Hampshire College, Mount Holyoke College, Smith College, and the University of Massachusetts, which are all located in the Connecticut River valley of western Massachusetts.http://www.astro.umass.edu/about/fcad/ See also * List of astronomical observatories * List of radio telescopes ReferencesExternal links * Orchard Hill Observatory Homepage Category:Astronomical observatories in Massachusetts Category:Buildings and structures in Hampshire County, Massachusetts Category:University of Massachusetts Amherst buildings ","title":"Orchard Hill Observatory"},{"id":"25805990","text":"Margery Beddow (December 13, 1937 - January 3, 2010) was an American actress, dancer, director and choreographer.

Life The second son of Isaac Gilpin of Strickland Ketel, in the parish of Kendal, Westmorland, and Ann, daughter of Ralph Tonstall of Coatham-Mundeville, County Durham, he was born at Strickland, and baptised at Kendal on 23 October 1625. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh, graduating with an MA on 30 July 1646, and studying first medicine, then divinity. Neither the date nor the manner of his ordination is known. He began his ministry at Lambeth, continued it at the Savoy as assistant to John Wilkins, and then returning to the north preached at Durham. In 1650 William Morland had been sequestered from the rectory of Greystoke, Cumberland. For about two years the living had been held by one West, a popular preacher, who died of consumption. Gilpin succeeded him in 1652 or early in 1653. In the parish of Greystoke there were four chapels, which Gilpin supplied with preachers. His parish was organised on the congregational model, having an inner circle of communicants and a staff of deacons; the presbyterian system had not been adopted in Cumberland. In August 1653 Gilpin set on foot a voluntary association of the churches of Cumberland and Westmorland, on the lines of Richard Baxter's Worcestershire 'agreement' of that year, but giving to the associated clergy somewhat larger powers. The organisation worked smoothly and gained in adherents; the terms of agreement were printed in 1656; in 1658 Gilpin preached (19 May) before the associated ministers at Keswick. His chief trouble was with the Quakers, who abounded in his district; one of his relatives at Kendal had been for a short time a Quaker. Gilpin was in the habit of giving medical advice as well as spiritual counsel to his flock. By his purchase of the manor of Scaleby Castle, some twenty miles north of Greystoke, beyond Carlisle, he acquired a public position in the county. He was appointed Visitor to Durham College, for which Oliver Cromwell issued a patent on 15 May 1657. At the Restoration, Gilpin was one of the most prominent religious leaders in the north of England, and was offered the see of Carlisle, which he refused. He preached at Carlisle at the opening of the assize on 10 September 1660. When Richard Sterne became bishop (2 December), Gilpin was not called upon to vacate his living, but resigned it on 2 February 1661 in favour of the sequestered Morland, retired to Scaleby, and preached there in his large hall. He is also said to have preached occasionally at Penruddock, a village in Greystoke parish, where John Noble, one of his deacons, gathered in his own house a nonconformist congregation, afterwards ministered to by Anthony Sleigh (died 1702). Shortly after the passing of the Uniformity Act of 1662 Gilpin moved to Newcastle-upon-Tyne, to minister to the hearers of the ejected lecturer, Samuel Hammond. By 1663 John Cosin was complaining of him. He did not wait for the indulgence of 1672, but openly disregarded the Conventicle Acts (1664, 1670) and the Five Mile Act (1665). He was several times fined for holding a conventicle, but does not seem to have been interfered with after 4 August 1669. At Newcastle, he acquired a good practice as a physician, and graduated M.D. at Leiden University on 6 July 1676. He was an effective preacher and drew a diverse congregation. From 1694 to 1698 Gilpin had as assistant William Pell, ejected from Great Stainton, Durham. Pell was followed by Timothy Manlove (died 3 August 1699), and Manlove by Thomas Bradbury. After Bradbury was Benjamin Bennet. Gilpin died on 13 February 1700. Works He published: * 'The Agreement of the Associated Ministers and Churches of Cumberland and Westmerland' (sic), &c.;, 1646, (anon.). * 'The Temple Rebuilt,' &c.;, 1658, (sermon, Zach. vi. 13, to associated ministers). * 'Disputatio Medica Inauguralis de Hysterica Passione,' &c.;, 1676. * 'D√¶monologia Sacra; or, a Treatise of Satan's Temptations,' &c.;, 3 pts., 1677; 2nd edit. Edinburgh, 1735; new edition, by A. B. Grosart, Edinburgh, 1867, (a work of religious experience, the first title somewhat misleading). * 'The Comforts of Divine Love,' &c.;, 1700 (funeral sermon for Manlove). Posthumous was * 'An Assize Sermon ‚Ä¶ at Carlisle,' &c.;, London and Newcastle, 1700 (preached in 1660, see above). Among Gilpin's manuscripts was a treatise on the 'Pleasantness of the Ways of Religion,' which Calamy desired to see in print; it has since been lost. Family He was twice married; his second wife, who survived him, was Susanna, daughter of William Brisco of Crofton, Yorkshire. She moved to Scaleby Castle, and died on 18 January 1715. His children were: # William, born 5 September 1657, remained a churchman, became recorder of Carlisle (1718), was noted for artistic and antiquarian tastes, married Mary, daughter of Henry Fletcher of Tallantire, Cumberland, and was buried 14 December 1724. William's daughter, Susanna Appleby, was also an antiquarian and excavated a Roman bath house near Camboglanna in 1741. # Isaac, born 12 July 1658, died 21 February 1719. # Susanna, born 17 October 1659, married Matthias Partis. # Anne, born 5 December 1660, married Jeremiah Sawrey of Broughton Tower, Lancashire; buried 11 April 1745. # Elizabeth, born 3 August 1662. # Richard, born 4 May 1664, died young. # Mary, born 28 December 1666. # Dorothy, born 13 August 1668, married, first, Jabez Cay, M.D., of Newcastle-upon-Tyne; secondly, on 29 December 1704, Eli Fenton; died April 1708. # John, born 13 February 1670, merchant at Whitehaven, made a fortune in the Virginia trade; married Hannah, daughter of Robert Cay of Newcastle-upon-Tyne; buried 26 November 1732. # Frances, born 27 July 1671, died young. # Bernard, born 6 October 1672, died young in Jamaica. # Frances, born 27 January 1675, died young. # Thomas, born 27 July 1677, died 20 June 1700.

Such sports also have a vibrant community of amateur players, from whom the best rise to become professionals. Association football American and Canadian football  Rugby football in Canada had its origins in the early 1860s, and over time, a unique code of football known as Canadian football developed. Both the Canadian Football League (CFL), the sport's top professional league, and Football Canada, the governing body for amateur play, trace their roots to 1882 and the founding of the Canadian Rugby Football Union (later reorganized as the Canadian Rugby Union). In 1909, the Grey Cup was donated by the then Governor General of Canada Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey, to recognize the top amateur rugby football team in Canada. From the 1930s to the 1950s, the two senior leagues of the CRU (the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union and the Western Interprovincial Football Union) gradually evolved from amateur to professional leagues, and found they had less and less in common with the amateur leagues, and consequently in 1956 formed a new umbrella organization, the Canadian Football Council. In 1958, the CFC left the CRU altogether and was renamed the Canadian Football League. By this time, teams from the amateur Ontario Rugby Football Union had stopped challenging for the Grey Cup, and ever since, it has been exclusively awarded to CFL teams. Since 1965, university teams have competed for the Vanier Cup. Australian rules football Unlike other sports, Australian rules football has not resisted becoming a professional sport. Although the sport began as amateur competition, the Australian Football League is an elite professional league and has been for nearly 80 years since its initial formation as the Victorian Football Association and then the Victorian Football League in 1897. The league changed its name to the Australian Football League (AFL) in 1990 amid the increasing professionalism and national expansion of the game. Auto racingBandy Bandy is played professionally in Russia, Sweden, and Kazakhstan. BaseballBasketball The game was invented in the United States in the 1890s, in Springfield, Massachusetts. The first professional basketball leagues emerged in the 1920s in the United States. Prominent among these were the American Basketball League, which formed in 1925, and the National Basketball League, which was launched in 1937 by General Electric, Firestone and Goodyear as a way to improve their national profile.\\"Steve Dimitry's Extinct Sports Leagues.\\" In 1946 the Basketball Association of America was founded by the owners of major sports arenas, particularly the Madison Square Garden. The BAA later merged with the NBL in 1949 to become the National Basketball Association, the preeminent league in the world with 29 teams in the United States and one in Canada. The American Basketball Association, founded in 1967, subsequently joined the NBA in the 1976 ABA-NBA merger. The second-oldest professional basketball league in the world is the Philippine Basketball Association. The PBA was long considered to be the best league in Asia, but the Chinese Basketball Association has grown tremendously in recent years. The league was born on April 9, 1975 at the Araneta Coliseum, Cubao, Quezon City, Philippines. Outside of the NBA, the top professional leagues in the world are those of FIBA Europe. According to the official league rankings produced by Euroleague Basketball, the body that conducts the continent-wide Euroleague, the top five national domestic leagues on the continent (from 1 to 5) are those Liga ACB (Spain), the Russian Professional Basketball League, the Greek Basket League, Lega Basket Serie A (Italy), and the Turkish Basketball League. European basketball is also characterized by its long established and well-developed transnational club competitions, most notably the Euroleague, which features top clubs from as many as 18 different domestic leagues. Two other continental club competitions, the ULEB Eurocup and EuroChallenge, are also conducted annually. Europe also has transnational regional leagues, such as the Liga ABA (Adriatic League, formerly Yugoslavian League), and Baltic Basketball League (originally limited to the Baltic states, now also including Kazakhstan).

However professionalism has a long history in English cricket. The first professionals had appeared by the first half of the eighteenth century, when heavy gambling on the game encouraged wealthy patrons to draft the best players into their teams. They would often offer these players full- time employment as gardeners or gamekeepers on their estates. In the second half of the century, the famous Hambledon Club paid its players match fees. In the middle of the nineteenth century William Clarke's All-England Eleven was a highly successful all-professional venture which did much to popularise the game. The earliest overseas tours were also all-professional affairs. In the early 21st century cricket is as lucrative as some other sports, and domestic cricketers typically earn several times the average salary in their country. Regular members of the English cricket team earn several hundred thousand pounds a year. However, the highest paid cricketers in the world are the star members of the Australian cricket team or the Indian cricket team who make most of their income from endorsement contracts. Players in T20 leagues such as the Indian Premier League make significant sums of money without having to play international cricket.

Disc Golf Professional Disc Golfers compete in Professional Disc Golf Association (PDGA) sanctioned events. Disc golf is among the fastest growing sports in the world. Its rules are similar to ball golf, with the throwing of discs replacing the hitting of balls and a specialty chain link network suspended above a basket replacing the cup. eSports Pro gamers compete in many leagues and tournaments throughout the world. Golf Horse Racing  Main article: Horse racing Ice hockey It is played with two teams, while 5 skaters and 1 goalie are allowed on the ice at a time. In NHL rules, the periods are 20 minutes long. There are three periods. The 81-member governing body is the International Ice Hockey Federation, (IIHF). Ice hockey has been played at the Winter Olympics since 1924, and was in the 1920 Summer Olympics. North America's National Hockey League is the strongest professional ice hockey league, drawing top ice hockey players from around the globe. The NHL rules are slightly different from those used in Olympic hockey. Ice hockey sticks are long L-shaped sticks made of wood, graphite, or composites with a blade at the bottom that can lie flat on the playing surface when the stick is held upright and can curve either way as to help a left- or right-handed player gain an advantage. There are early representations and reports of hockey-type games being played on ice in the Netherlands, and reports from Canada from the beginning of the nineteenth century, but the modern game was initially organized by students at McGill University, Montreal in 1875 and, by two years later, codified the first set of ice hockey rules and organized the first teams. Lacrosse Lacrosse is played mainly in North America, however, countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia have small lacrosse leagues. It has also expanded into both Europe and Asia, with the latter forming the Asia Pacific Lacrosse Union (APLU) in May 2012. The United States currently has three top-level professional lacrosse leagues in operation, Major League Lacrosse, the Premier Lacrosse League, and the National Lacrosse League. Rugby league Rugby league came into existence due to the very issue of professionalism. Rugby football split into 'union' and 'league' over the issue of payment to player. Rugby league favoured payments and has thus been a professional sport since its beginnings in 1895, when 22 clubs based in northern England split from the more amateur-minded Rugby Football Union. The officially amateur RFU had previously brought charges of professionalism against some clubs for their use of \\"broken time\\" payments to compensate players for missing work due to matches or injuries received whilst playing. On August 29, 1895 in a meeting at the George Hotel, Huddersfield, the clubs decided to break away and form the Northern Rugby Union, which later would become the Rugby Football League. The rules of rugby league were gradually changed so that now it and rugby union are distinctly different games, however rugby union has since turned professional as well. On 17 December 1967 the first professional Sunday matches of rugby league were played.  Rugby union  Rugby union continued with its amateur ideals past the schism between union and league and throughout much of the 20th century. This position changed in 1995. The threat of big payments from professional rugby league clubs in countries where rugby league had a significant following was becoming too great. A committee conclusion decided that the only way to end this threat, the hypocrisy of Shamateurism and keep control of rugby union was to make the sport professional. On August 26, 1995 the International Rugby Board declared rugby union an \\"open\\" game and thus removed all restrictions on payments or benefits to those connected with the game. Rodeo/bull riding The PBR is different from the classic rodeo as it consists of only bull riding.

Today it has also become a major source of pollution in the region as well the main Sutlej river, as it get polluted after entering the highly populated and industrialized Ludhiana city, turning it into an open drain. Also, since large area in south-western Punjab solely depend on the canal water for irrigation, and water from Buddha Nullah enters various canals after Harike waterworks near Firozpur, thus affecting far-reaching areas such as Malout, Zira, upper Lambi, while the areas being fed by Sirhind feeder, are the most-affected by its pollution. In 2006, a Ludhiana-based human rights organisation, filed a case regarding the state of the nullah in the Punjab State Human Rights Commission (PSHRC) and even invited environmentalist, Balbir Singh Seechewal, who had earlier cleaned the 164-km-long highly polluted Kali Bein rivulet with the help of his followers and without the government aid, to take the cause of cleaning up the nullah. A study conducted by Punjab Agricultural University in 2008, revealed presence of toxins and heavy metals in the food chain due to use of its water, to cultivate vegetables and other crops. This was followed by another study by the School of Public Health, Department of Community Medicine, PGIMER, Chandigarh, and the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB), which also showed heptachlor, beta- endosulphan and chlorpyrifos pesticides in concentrations exceeding the maximum residue limit in samples of ground and canal water used for drinking, the pesticides were also detected in fodder, vegetables, blood, bovine and human milk samples, indicating that these have entered the food chain due to the use of agricultural run-off and irrigation of field with drain water. With increasing poisoning of the soil, the region once hailed as the home to the Green Revolution, now due to excessive use of chemical fertilizer, is being termed the \\"Other Bhopal\\", and \\"even credit-takers of the Revolution have begun to admit they had been wrong, now that they see wastelands and lives lost to farmer suicides in this \\"granary of India\\". Geology Buddha Nullah, literally, means Old rivulet or watercourse,It originates at village koom Kalan of Ludhiana and it runs parallel to the Satluj on its south for a fairly large section of its course in the Ludhiana district and ultimately joins the Satluj at Wajipur Kalan in the northwestern corner of the district. Cities of Ludhiana and Machhiwara are situated to the south of the Buddha Nala. Pollution The water of the stream is polluted after it enters Ludhiana City.Baba Seechewal plays on environment issue The Times of India, 6 Apr 2009. Buddha Nullah used to be a fresh water channel with about 56 types of fish species prior to 1964. Now it has no fish because of the high level toxicity in the water. It is now an open sewer rather than a stream. Once an asset to the city, the Nullah is now a source of public nuisance and poses a serious health hazard. The megacity has no sewage treatment plant. Untreated domestic and industrial sewerage of the city is emptied into Buddha Nullah.Near Haibowal, cause is Buddha Nullah stench, The Tribune, 1 May 2007. The nullah, in turn, empties into the mighty Sutlej flowing nearby. Hundreds of tonnes of raw sewage from Ludhiana flows into the Sutlej every day and is distributed all over the state through irrigation canals. This polluted water is in turn used for growing food crops, vegetables and fruits and is a known carrier of diseases. According to the State Department of Fisheries the pollution of the Buddha Nullah has led to the drastic reduction in the fish yield in river Sutlej.Ludhiana heading for a Bhopal-like tragedy Punjab rivers are now heavily polluted by A. S. Prashar. The Tribune, August, 1997. A joint study by PGIMER and Punjab Pollution Control Board in 2008, revealed that in villages along the Nullah, calcium, magnesium, fluoride, mercury, beta-endosulphan and heptachlor were more than permissible limit (MPL) in ground and tap waters. Plus the water had high concentration of COD and BOD (chemical and biochemical oxygen demand), ammonia, phosphate, chloride, chromium, arsenic and chlorpyrifos. The ground water also contains nickel and selenium, while the tap water has high concentration of lead, nickel and cadmium. According to PPCB, the nullah water requires a sewage treatment capacity of at least per day for treatment while present sewage treatment plants at Jamlapur, Nalloke and Bhattian have a combined capacity of 311 MLD. In 2010, water samples taken from the Nullah, showed heavy metal content as quite high and the presence of uranium 1¬Ω times the reference range. For example, chromium was 50 times the reference range, aluminum and iron 20 and 60 times higher, while concentration of silver, manganese, nickel and lead was equally high. Presently, sewage treatment plants of 466 MLD (48 MLD at Jamalpur, 111 & 50 MLD at Bhattial and 152 & 105MLD at Balloke) are operational for the treatment of the sewage of Ludhiana citty. Response In June 2009, Ludhiana district administration imposed article 144 around the nullah, banning the throwing of garbage in it, but in the following months it was scarcely implemented, despite public outcry. In the following month, the Government of Punjab, allocated Rs. 500 million for the cleaning up of the nullah., and in August, the municipal corporation in a demolition drive, removed a large number of illegal encroachments from both sides of the nullah.

That season, he led the team in games played (159), batted .297, with a career-high 10 HR. In Game 6 of the 2011 World Series, Jay had a key hit in the 10th inning and later scored the tying run on a line drive into centerfield by Lance Berkman. On May 15, 2012, Jay was moved to the 15-day disabled list due to lingering shoulder soreness after running into the outfield wall the month before, but he returned shortly thereafter. For the year, he finished with career-bests in batting average (.305) and OBP (.373), both of which placed tenth in the National League (NL). His 19 stolen bases (SB) were another career best. He hit four HR, collected 40 RBI, 22 doubles and scored 70 runs. Between August 24, 2011 and July 30, 2013, Jay established a new NL all-time errorless streak record for center fielders at 245 games against the Pittsburgh Pirates. It is also the longest streak for all Cardinals outfielders. Curt Flood, a former Cardinal, owned the previous center field record of 226 games spanning from Sep 3, 1965 to Jun 2, 1967. With increased playing time in 2013, Jay established career-highs in PA (628), doubles (27), runs (75), and BB (52), and RBI (67). However, his batting average (.276) and SLG (.370) slumped to a career-lows. Jay was third among NL center fielders in games played (153), fourth in putouts (335), first in double plays (three), and second in fielding percentage (.997). Conversely, advanced defensive metrics showed he was ten runs below average for center fielders for defensive runs saved (DRS), ranking 32nd in MLB. From 2011‚Äì13, Fangraphs rated his arm at 21st out of 21 centerfielders who played at least 2,000 innings. Runners advanced for extra bases on Jay in 60 percent of plays. Jay with St. Louis, 2014 The Cardinals agreed with Jay on a one-year $3.25 million contract on January 17, 2014, to avoid arbitration. Through 2013, Jay had a career batting average of .300 with a .356 OBP and a .400 SLG. After the Cardinals acquired outfielder Peter Bourjos in a trade with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim during the offseason of 2013, Jay's role on the club was expected to be reduced during 2014. Bourjos' impressive defensive ability was one of the main reasons of the trade, as Jay's 2013 defensive campaign was probably the worst of his career. But after a poor offensive April for Bourjos, Jay's playing time started to increase throughout the season, as Bourjos found himself on the bench more and more. By the end of the season, Jay finished batting .303, with three home runs while driving in 46 runs. Although appearing in only 17 fewer games in 2014 than in 2013, Jay had 135 fewer at-bats, and could not contend for the batting title, where at one point in September he was batting well over .320, which was higher than the final .319 batting average of Justin Morneau, who won the batting title. He led the major leagues in hit by pitch, with 20.2014 Regular Season MLB Baseball Batting Statistics and League Leaders - Major League Baseball - ESPN During the postseason, where Jay had historically struggled throughout his career, he batted .478, going 14-29 throughout the NLDS and NLCS. In the off-season preceding the 2015 season, Jay had surgery on the left wrist, which did not heal completely. He struggled through other injuries on the same wrist, such as a bone bruise and tendinitis, hampering his ability to hit effectively. Jay missed a number of games in the month of May, and another 57 from July 1 to September 4. San Diego Padres On December 8, 2015, Jay was traded to the San Diego Padres in exchange for Jedd Gyorko. After a productive first couple of months of the season for the Padres, Jay suffered a broken forearm on June 19 and was placed on the DL on June 28. He was reactivated on September 6th and finished the season with a .291 batting average in 90 games played. Chicago Cubs Jay hit .287 in seven seasons with the Cardinals and Padres. As a free agent, Jay signed a one-year, $8 million contract with the Chicago Cubs on November 29, 2016. On July 6, 2017, Jay pitched a scoreless 9th inning in an 11-2 defeat by the Milwaukee Brewers. Jay had a batting average of .296 in 379 at bats for the Cubs in 2017. Kansas City Royals On March 6, 2018, Jay signed a one year, $3 million, contract with the Kansas City Royals. Arizona Diamondbacks On June 6, 2018, the Royals traded Jay to the Arizona Diamondbacks in exchange for Elvis Luciano and Gabe Speier. For the season, he had the lowest fly ball percentage of all major league hitters (16.5%).Major League Leaderboards ¬ª 2018 ¬ª Batters ¬ª Batted Ball Statistics  FanGraphs Baseball Chicago White Sox Jay signed a one-year contract with the Chicago White Sox on January 10, 2019.Jon Jay officially becomes a White Sox  Chicago Sun-Times He began the season on the 60-day disabled list, and was activated on June 24, 2019.

In December 2015, Jay accompanied an expedition to Cuba with former Cardinals player and manager Joe Torre, and then-Cardinals catcher Brayan Pe√±a. It was MLB's first visit there since 1999, and one anticipated as an important step to help normalize relations with the United States that had begun to ease earlier in the year.

The Bedford Village Archeological Site (36BD90) is an archaeological site in central Bedford County, Pennsylvania, United States. Located in Bedford Township north of the borough of Bedford, it was once occupied by a Monongahela culture village. Today, the site is the location of Old Bedford Village, an open-air museum. Profile The Monongahela village once located at the site was composed of circular houses surrounded by a stockade, an arrangement common in such villages.George, Richard L. National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: Deffenbaugh Site (36FA57). National Park Service, 1981-07-31, 3. It was built at the highest point of a terrace along the Raystown Branch of the Juniata River, above the marshy areas of the river's floodplain. This location is atypical for the Monongahela culture, whose bearer typically settled in upland areas for defensive purposes. The villagers' houses were similar to those in other settlements; one house in the village is known to have been of a diameter of , like those in many other Monongahela villages. Based on archaeological evidence, it is believed that the site was occupied for a short period of time ‚Äî perhaps two generations ‚Äî at some point between the years 1250 and 1600. Historical period After European settlement of the area, the hardwood forest at the site was cleared and the area was farmed for many years. Agriculture ended at the site in the mid-1970s, when the Bedford County Redevelopment Authority received a federal grant to construct a living history museum at the site. The resulting attraction, known as Old Bedford Village, was built in 1975 and 1976. Excavation Before the creation of Old Bedford Village, the site was locally known as a source of artifacts, but no wider attention was paid to the site's archaeological potential until after the museum was established. Testing at the northern portion of the site in 1977 revealed evidence of a village from the Monongahela period and of pre-Monongahela occupation dating back to the Late Archaic period. In the summers of 1979 and 1980, Pennsylvania State University conducted much more extensive excavations at different locations in Old Bedford Village, revealing stockade trenches around much of the site. It is believed that the site was extensively impacted by the construction of Old Bedford Village: buildings and utility lines were erected atop much of the site, and a gravel road now runs across the area. Moreover, the heavy machinery used in construction may have buried middens on the edge of the village's terrace. However, approximately three-fourths of the site remained undamaged after construction, and it is unlikely that any more areas will be affected by the museum. Significance The Bedford Village Site represents an unusual mix of phases in Native American history in the region. As one of the most eastern Monongahela sites ever discovered, it represents the possibility of transition between the Monongahela and other peoples of central Pennsylvania. Moreover, the site's location in a floodplain has been cited as evidence for climate change in North America: it has been proposed that cooling weather around the year 1500 caused the bearer of the Monongahela culture to abandon their hilltop homes in favor of warmer weather in river valleys. Questions of influence from other cultures are especially significant because artifacts have also been found at the site of the Shenks Ferry culture of eastern Pennsylvania. While such evidence is minimal, it suggests a short- term Shenks Ferry occupation at a date later than that of the Monongahela; among the remains of the Shenks Ferry occupation is a large midden located on top of the Monongahela stockade. The wide range of artifacts and the high degree of preservation at the Bedford Village site led to its listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

Founded by local farmers but now a subsidiary of French company Lactalis, it was the United Kingdom's first certified organic dairy. Background The Williams family took over Brynllys farm in Ceredigion, West Wales, in 1942, and started developing a herd of Guernsey cows. Dinah Williams was the daughter of Abel Jones, Professor of Agriculture at Aberystwyth University, and his wife Bessie Brown MBE, the university‚Äôs first dairy instructor and organiser of the Women's Land Army in Wales during World War I. After World War II, Dinah often appeared with Lady Eve Balfour, trying to dissuade farmers from using artificial fertilisers and pesticides, leading to the formation of the Soil Association. As a result, in 1952 Brynllys became one of the earliest members of the Soil Association, and established the farm as the first certified organic dairy farm. After the death of her husband in 1966, Williams handed over the farm to her middle daughter Rachel and son-in-law Gareth Rowlands. At this time they were supplying premium organic milk to the Milk Marketing Board. In the mid-1980s, after a scriptwriter for BBC Radio 4 visited Brynllys, it inspired a storyline in The Archers when Pat and Tony Archer ‚Äúwent organic‚Äù at Bridge Farm. In 2009, Teleri Bevan published a book They Dared to Make a Difference, detailing the lives of the three family generations at Brynllys. History The company was born out of the need for farming diversification. When heavy snow hit Aberystwyth in 1982, preventing milk tankers from reaching the isolated farm, the Rowlands were forced to find other uses for their milk. Using an old butter churn, they made cream and butter by hand. After the snow cleared, the Rowlands discovered they had inadvertently created a market for their dairy goods and they were spurred on to extend their range of products. Rachel began researching old recipes, including yogurt, and the Rachel‚Äôs Dairy brand was born as a company in 1984. The home for the company‚Äôs production stayed on Brynllys farm, but between 1985 and 1990 the company experienced considerable growth, which resulted in a purpose-built dairy being built at Glanyrafon, Aberystwyth. Present In 1999, the company was bought for ¬£1.5M in an agreed takeover by United States dairy company Horizon Organic, their only presence in the UK. In 2004, Horizon was bought by Dean Foods based in Texas, the largest dairy distributor in the USA. The company dropped the ‚Äúorganic‚Äù from its name in 2009 becoming simply Rachel‚Äôs. However, all products currently remain organic and include milk, butter, rice pudding, cream, cr√®me fraiche and a variety of yogurts. On the 28 July 2010, it was confirmed that Dean Foods as part of their restructuring programme had agreed to sell a package of European dairy products companies including Rachel's to BSA International of Belgium, the holding company for France-based Lactalis Groupe, which itself will take operational control of Rachel's. The company has since moved production of all of its rice-based desserts to France.http://www.walesonline.co.uk/business-in-wales/business- news/2012/01/04/wales-based-yoghurt-producer-rachel-s-dairy-writes- off-1m-after-supermarket-reduces-its-products-91466-30056002/ In May 2012, Rachel's was moved into Lactalis Nestl√© Chilled Dairy (LNCD), which is a joint venture with Nestl√©. Lactalis owns 60% of LNCD and Nestl√© 40%. Hence Rachel's is now the subject of a boycott call by baby milk action. Recycling To save natural resources and increase recycling, in 2007 the company launched a 2-layer yogurt pot. The inner sleeve was a thinner mould using polystyrene, the outer sleeve made from recycled cardboard, and the over-cap made of polypropylene. In 2009, the inner sleeve was changed to be made from 60% recycled polyethylene terephthalate, which is recyclable. Awards Rachel‚Äôs has won numerous awards for the quality of its products and its innovation including Great Taste awards, and Wales the True Taste awards. In 2007 Rachel‚Äôs was recognised as one of Britain‚Äôs most environmentally friendly brands in a YouGov poll conducted by Marketing Week, and in 2009 was given Coolbrand status in the UK list of Superbrands. In July 2010, Rachel's received eight awards in the Dairy Produce Category at the Royal Welsh Show. Rachel's received a Gold award at Wales the True Taste Food & Drink Awards 2010, for their Wholemilk Gooseberry Yogurt.

It was developed by MetaQuotes Software and released in 2005. The software is licensed to foreign exchange brokers who provide the software to their clients. The software consists of both a client and server component. The server component is run by the broker and the client software is provided to the broker‚Äôs customers, who use it to see live streaming prices and charts, to place orders, and to manage their accounts. The client is a Microsoft Windows-based application that became popular mainly due to the ability for end users to write their own trading scripts and robots that could automate trading. In 2010, MetaQuotes released a successor, MetaTrader 5. However, uptake was slow and as of April 2013 most brokers still used MT4. While there is no official MetaTrader 4 version available for Mac OS, some brokers provide their own custom developed MT4 variants for Mac OS. History Its developer, MetaQuotes Software, had previously released a number of versions of the MetaTrader platform starting in 2002. MetaTrader 4 was a significantly enhanced version and was released in 2005. Between 2007 and 2010, a number of brokerages added the MT4 platform as an optional alternative to their existing trading software due to its popularity with traders and the large number of third party scripts and advisors. In October 2009, a significantly re-coded MetaTrader 5 went into public beta testing. The first MT5 live account was subsequently launched by InstaForex in September 2010. In 2013 and 2014, the MQL4 programming language was completely revised eventually reaching the level of MQL5. Starting from build 600, MQL4 and MQL5 use unified MetaEditor. Although MT5 was introduced in 2009, according to a study conducted in September 2019, MetaTrader 4 was still the most popular Forex trading platform in the world at the time.\\"Forex Trading Industry Statistics and Facts 2020\\". DailyForex.com. 9 September, 2020 Functionality A chart from the MT4 trading screen The client terminal includes a built-in editor and compiler with access to a user contributed free library of software, articles and help. The software uses a proprietary scripting language, MQL4/MQL5, which enables traders to develop Expert Advisors, custom indicators and scripts. MetaTrader's popularity largely stems from its support of algorithmic trading. Yahoo! hosts a large group (over 12,000 members) devoted to development of free open source software for MetaTrader. MT4 is designed to be used as a stand-alone system with the broker manually managing their position and this is a common configuration used by brokers. However a number of third party developers have written software bridges enabling integration with other financial trading systems for automatic hedging of positions. In late 2012 and early 2013, MetaQuotes Software began to work towards removing third-party plugins for its software from the market, suing and warning developers and brokers. MetaTrader provide two types of trading orders, Pending Orders and Market Orders. Pending orders will be executed only when the price reaches a predefined level, whereas Market orders can be executed in one of the four modes: Instant execution, Request execution, Market execution, and Exchange execution. With Instant execution, the order will be executed at the price displayed in the platform. Its advantage is that the order will be executed at a known price. However, a good trading opportunity can be missed when the volatility is high and the requested price cannot be served. Request execution mode enables trader to execute a Market order in two steps ‚Äî first, a price quote is requested, then, a trader decides whether to buy or sell using the received price. A trader has several seconds to decide if the received price is worth trading. Such mode offers a certain knowledge of price combined with guaranteed execution at that price. The tradeoff is the reduced speed of execution, which can take a lot longer than other modes. With Market execution, the orders will be executed with broker's price even if it is different from that displayed in the platform. The advantage of this mode is that it allows trading without any sort of requotes. However, deviation can get considerable during volatile price changes. In Exchange execution mode, the order is processed by the external execution facility (the exchange). The trade is executed according to the current depth of market. Components The complete MetaTrader 4 package includes the following components: * MetaTrader 4 Client Terminal - the client part. Provided free by brokerages for real-time online trading and as Demo (practice trading) accounts. This provides trade operations, charts and technical analysis in real time. The internal C-like programming language allows users to program trading strategies, indicators and signals. 50 basic indicators are included, each of which can be further customized. The software runs on Windows 98/2000/XP/Vista/7. Some users have reported success using Wine on Linux for the client terminal and on Mac using WineBottler. * MetaTrader 4 Mobile - controls a trading account via mobile devices such as mobile phones or PDAs. Runs on Windows Pocket PC 2002/Mobile 2003, iOS, and Android. * MetaTrader 4 Server - the core of the system, the server part. Designed to handle user requests to perform trade operations, display and execution of warrants. Also, sends price quotes and news broadcasts, records and maintains archives. Works as a service. Does not have a separate interface. * MetaTrader 4 Administrator - is designed to remotely manage the server settings. * MetaTrader 4 Manager - designed to handle trade inquiries and manage customer accounts. * MetaTrader 4 Data Center - a specialized proxy server and can be an intermediary between the server and client terminals. It reduces the price quote sending load on the main server. Products The platform is focused on margin trading. Some brokerages use MetaTrader 4 to trade CFD but it is not designed for full-time work in the stock market or exchange-traded futures. At the same time, MetaTrader 5 also works with equities and commodities exchange-traded commodities. Both MetaTrader 4 and 5 can use custom indicators and trading programs (called Expert Advisors) for trading automation.

Early life In 1914 Schrader graduated as teacher and enlisted voluntarily in the Prussian Army where he served throughout World War I. Demobilized in 1920 with the rank of Oberleutnant (first lieutenant) he worked as teacher. From 1924 to 1927 he taught History and German at an army technical school in Wolfenb√ºttel.Oberstleutnant Werner Schrader Axis history Forum At approximately the same time, Schrader became a member of Der Stahlhelm (, a veterans organisation after the First World War. There he rose to the rank of regional leader for Braunschweig. After the Nazi takeover of power in Weimar Germany he vehemently opposed aligning the Stahlhelm with Hitler‚Äôs storm troops, eventually losing both his leadership position in the institution and his teaching post.Werner Schrader at Gedenkst√§tte Deutscher Widerstand (in English) An action which clearly led to his downfall occurred in October 1931. That month Werner von Schrader attended the Harzburg Congress; in the presence of the up-and-coming Adolf Hitler, he denounced the excesses of the SA or Storm Troopers. Thus after Adolf Hitler came to power in January 1933, later that year he was detained and then tortured in one of the newly built concentration camps. He managed to successfully escape the camp by May 1934. Nazi Germany and the Second World War After his escape, he rejoined the army as a Hauptmann or Captain with seniority dating from May 1 of 1934; in 1936, with re-arrest now possible, he was personally recruited into the German military intelligence service or Abwehr by Admiral Wilhelm Canaris as Captain. He was stationed first to Munich, then to Vienna, then back to Germany to the army headquarters at Zossen, where he was promoted to Oberstleutnant (Lieutenant Colonel). While in Munich, he met fellow resister Rudolf von Marogna-Redwitz; while in Vienna, he began to collect documentary evidence of Nazi crimes. After the invasion of Poland in September 1939, Werner von Schrader was transferred to German Army High Command Headquarters where he put together a secret archive - complete with reports and photographs - of SS atrocities in Poland (See: http://www.gdw- berlin.de/bio/ausgabe_mit-e.php?id=186). Wilhelm Canaris had successfully lobbied for an Abwehr presence at Army High Command Headquarters at Zossen. The small four-man sub-unit called the Special Duties Section was completely staffed by anti-Nazis - including Werner von Schrader. While in the Special Duties Section, in 1939‚Äì1940, Schrader prepared detailed plans and briefings for a coup; he left the small section in September 1940 for a promotion to Major and a posting in Vienna but returned to Zossen and the Special Duties Section in 1941 where he would remain for the rest of his life. During the 1939 to 1944 period, Schrader had acted as the main custodian of various resistance-related files and documents, becoming one of the archivists to the German resistance. In 1944, he also took on the responsibility of the detailed documents put together by Hans von Dohnanyi and Hans Oster. He particularly took care of the personal diary of his boss Admiral Canaris, chief of Abwehr and head of the German resistance movement against Hitler. 20 July Bomb Plot Werner Schrader was involved in the procurement and handling of explosives for the 20 July conspiracy. In June 1944, Oberst Wessel von Freytag-Loringhoven became Chief of Abwehr II. By the end of June 1944, Werner von Schrader had provided him with explosives and with fuses; these were passed on to Claus von Stauffenberg. At the same time due to his placement in the military secret service, he was in charge of investigations into finds of similar explosives. He had managed to sabotage these investigations. In early July 1944, Schrader met with Canaris and briefed him on what he knew of Claus von Stauffenberg's intended plot. After the assassination attempt on July 20 of 1944 had failed, Schrader ended his life on July 28, 1944. He left a note saying ‚ÄúI will not go to prison; I will not let them torture me...‚Äù. The Zossen-based copy of Canaris' diary was discovered on April 4 of 1945 by the pro-Hitler General Walther Buhle and other important resistance documents were also discovered by the Gestapo after Schrader's suicide. As a result, the Canaris group was executed on April 9, 1945 at Flossenburg and Sachsenhausen concentration camps. Schrader's wife Cornelia and his son Werner Wolf were arrested.

Born in Chester, Maine of a mediumistic mother, Barwise became an attorney and nationally prominent member of the National Spiritualist Association (N.S.A.).Iowa governor and US senator Harold E. Hughes (1922-1996) was also a one-time spiritualist and self-described \\"seeker,\\" which became an issue when he was being considered as a possible candidate for President of the United States in the 1972 election. James Risser and George Anthan, \\"'Personal' Religion of Senator Hughes,\\" The Des Moines Register 11 July 1971, p1; National Spiritualist Association, Centennial Book of Modern Spiritualism in America (1948), p. 123 He wrote extensively on spiritualism, represented the church in court cases, served on its board of trustees, and became Curator of its Bureau of Phenomenal Evidence. Despite his leadership position in a religion outside the American mainstream, he was elected to the Maine House of Representatives from Bangor (Penobscot County) in 1921-24, and in 1925-26 to the Maine State Senate. Political career Barwise's political career was defined by his championing of a controversial amendment to the state constitution prohibiting the use of any public funds by private institutions. \\"The Barwise Bill\\" was widely interpreted as an attack on Maine's growing Catholic school system by the Protestant majority, and was called a \\"Klan measure\\" by one newspaper. Although Barwise's ties to the Ku Klux Klan (if any) are unknown, Maine saw significant Klan activity in the 1920s, directed against the local Catholic population, which the controversy surrounding the Barwise Bill only helped inflame. It is entirely possible, also, that Barwise was happy to help inflame this controversy. Within Spiritualist publications, Barwise was an outspoken opponent of the Catholic Church in America, particularly when any representative of the Church opposed legislation Barwise championed. For example, when Cardinal O'Connell declared the Church's opposition to compulsory prohibition, Barwise accused Catholic Church officials of requiring American Catholics to \\"regard themselves as Catholics first and Americans second,\\" and be willing to oppose civil law when it conflicts with church doctrine. \\"Real Americans,\\" Barwise argued, have \\"first allegiance . . . to the Constitution, and not to a Prince of a Foreign Potentate who happens to live in a cathedral palace in Boston.\\"Barwise, Mark Alton. 'The Catholic Church v. The Constitution,' \\"National Spiritualist.\\" 8:87 (1926) page 9. Whatever his opinions of the Catholic Church were, however, Barwise's relationship to the Klan remained ambiguous. In 1923, during what one politician called \\"temporary hysteria\\" over increased Klan activity in the Maine, Barwise contributed to the downfall of an anti-Klan bill that he had helped author (\\"an act to prevent crime by persons masked or disguised\\") by giving it only \\"half-hearted support\\" when it was presented.'No Sensation over Ku Klux Shown in Maine State House,' \\"Portsmouth Herald.\\" 28 March 1926, page 3. When asked whether he believed the bill should be enacted, he stated that, while he did care about law and order, he did not care \\"about the squabbles between the Klan and the Knights of Columbus.\\" \\"I do not think this legislation is really necessary,\\" he concluded. The bill died in committee. The Barwise Bill, on the other hand, was defeated in the Maine House in 1923 after heated debate. It was defeated a second time in 1925 after then-Senator Barwise re-introduced a modified version of it. Barwise may have been considered an effective sponsor and spokesman for an anti-Catholic measure precisely because he was not a mainstream Protestant.Lewiston Evening Journal, November 16, 1926, p. 2; Ibid, May 15, 1923, p. 17 The year Barwise left state office (1925), his Senate colleague Owen Brewster, who had introduced a similar bill on the same issue, was elected Governor of Maine with Klan support. Despite its sectarian effects, the Barwise Bill may also have originated from Barwise's personal convictions that church (and not just the Catholic Church) and state be fully separated. He had begun his political career, in 1921, by introducing a bill to repeal an old yet widely violated law requiring businesses to close on Sunday. This was as unpopular with the Protestant majority as with Catholics, and was defeated in the Maine House by a wide margin (107 to 15).Lewiston Daily Sun, February 28, 1971, p. 17 Regardless of whether he was tied to the Klan, Barwise was clearly a racist. At the 1924 NSA convention in Los Angeles, Barwise led the faction which moved to expel the church's many black members and force them to establish a separate association.Nevada State Journal, Sept. 26, 1924, p. 1 Religious Activities Barwise published numerous essays and short articles on spiritualism, including the 64-page booklet \\"A Preface to Spiritualism\\" (1938), and the chapter on spiritualism in Charles Samuel Braden's Varieties of American Religion (1936). With Rev. Thomas Grimshaw, Superintendent of Education of the N.S.A., he organized a correspondence course on spiritualism in the 1930s.National Spiritualist Association, Centennial Book of Modern Spiritualism in America (1948), p. 116 He was also associated with \\"Camp Etna\\", a prominent spiritualist summer camp outside of Bangor in Etna, Maine, whose charismatic leader was the medium Mary Scannell Pepper Vanderbilt.

Davies, was a Welsh Congregationalist minister, theologian, author and professor of religion in England and the United States. Life Davies was born in 1911 in Glanamman, Carmarthenshire, Wales. Educated at the University of Wales (BD, 1938) and at Cambridge (MA, 1942), he was ordained to the ministry of the Congregational Church in 1941 and served churches in Cambridgeshire until 1946. Concurrently, he engaged in research at the University of Cambridge under the dean of British New Testament scholars, C. H. Dodd, and David Daube, a Jewish scholar who became Regius Professor of Civil Law (Oxford), but who wrote extensively on the New Testament from the vantage point of rabbinic sources. Davies was then appointed Professor of New Testament Studies at Yorkshire United College in Bradford, Yorkshire, a post he held till 1950. In 1948, the University of Wales granted him the degree of Doctor of Divinity operis causa, the first time for that degree to be so granted. That year saw the publication of his first major book, Paul and Rabbinic Judaism: Some Rabbinic Elements in Pauline Theology, and in 1950 Davies was named Professor of Biblical Theology at Duke Divinity School. In 1955 he became professor of religion at Princeton University, where he was one of three professors (R. Y. B. Scott and Horton Davies the other two) who helped to inaugurate a graduate study program leading to a Doctor of Philosophy degree in religion ‚Äì the first such program in a secular university in the United States. (See New York Times, July5, 1955.) He then became Edward Robinson Professor of Biblical Theology at Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York, where he had important relationships with Reinhold Niebuhr and, across the street, with Louis Finkelstein (Pharisaism), Neil Gillman, Abraham Joshua Heschel (narrative and law), and Saul Lieberman (Hellenism in the land of Israel) ‚Äì all housed at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America ‚Äì as well as Salo Wittmayer Baron of Columbia University, up the hill. At Union, he supervised the dissertation of E. P. Sanders, which became the book The Tendencies of the Synoptic Tradition. Davies later returned to Duke as George Washington Ivey Professor of Advanced Studies and Research in Christian Origins. Davies died on 12 June 2001 in Durham, North Carolina. Work Davies's period of study and research in Cambridge and his participation in Dodd's seminar led to his editing, together with Daube, of the volume of essays presented to C. H. Dodd in 1956, The Background of the New Testament and Its Eschatology. In his own published works, Davies's double interests ‚Äì in the Jewish background of the New Testament and in the theological implications of this background ‚Äì are especially exhibited. His books on Paul's writings and on the Sermon on the Mount (in Matthew) explore Pharisaic understandings of the Law (or Torah) in the \\"age to come\\" or messianic era ‚Äì against the backdrop of developments and thought in Judaism not only during the time of Jesus but also in the closing decades of the first century (especially the destruction of Jerusalem and the Council of Jamnia). 'Paul and Rabbinic Judaism is one of the first books to rescue the apostle from the purely Greek background which earlier scholars had assumed for him. In The Setting of the Sermon on the Mount (1964), Davies sees a law which remains even under the covenant of grace and thus spans the canonical tensions between James and Paul. Theologically, then, by reorienting views on Paul, and by bringing Pharisaic, nomistic themes in Matthew to the fore, Davies sought to pull together the various New Testament strands and aims at a comprehensive combination of Law and Gospel. As for church life, in Christian Origins and Judaism Davies comes to the conclusion that, in the New Testament (rather like the Old), there is no single fixed pattern of church order that is to be regarded as normative, only certain criteria to guide. The Dodd-Daube-Davies troika led, in many ways, to the so-called New Perspective on Paul ‚Äì probably what Davies meant when he eulogized Daube by saying that, when Daube called Christianity \\"a New Testament Judaism\\", he ushered in a \\"near-revolution\\" in New Testament studies.W. D. Davies, A Gentle Hawk eulogy for David Daube The leading light of the new/originalist Paul movement, E. P. Sanders, was a student of Daube and Davies, and Sanders's first book, Paul and Palestinian Judaism, is very much in dialogue with Davies's earlier Paul and Rabbinic Judaism. By no means are the two in agreement on all things, but Davies's work in de-Hellenizing Paul allowed for Sanders to approach the apostle dusted, scrubbed, and ready for fresh analysis.

His first directorial role and foreign posting saw him based in South Africa as Marketing Director between 1995 and 1997. He continued to gain international experience between 1998 and 1999, as Vice President of Marketing for Land Rover North America.http://www.media.landrover.com/php/biographies.php?biography_id=157, accessed 2010-01-28 He then left Land Rover to become Head of Operations, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles from 1999 to 2001, before being lured back by the attractions of Land Rover‚Äôs UK Sales Directorship. Two years of record sales and profits helped propel him to appointment as Managing Director Jaguar and Land Rover (UK) in March 2003. A promotion to Director of Global Operations for Land Rover followed in February 2006, leading almost immediately (April 2006) to his being elevated to the Managing Director role.

The company employs 10,000 workers (and supports a further 40,000 in the extended supply chain). Over 70% of models are sold abroad in over 160 countries, with the UK being the company‚Äôs largest single market. Popham has also overseen the introduction of \\"the world‚Äôs leading carbon offset programme\\" offsetting all CO2 produced by Land Rover manufacturing (and for UK, France, Belgium, Austria, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, China, the Gulf region drivers - the first 45,000 miles on the road). When allied to the introduction of fuel-efficient diesel across the range, Popham notes that \\"we are as serious about sustainability as we are confident about the continuing relevance and desirability of our vehicles.\\"LRX Concept press release, accessed 2009-12-10 Having witnessed shifts of ownership from BMW to Ford to Tata, Popham is on record as saying that Land Rover‚Äôs success is self- sustaining. \\"We are in the middle of a sales phenomenon\\" he has noted, adding \\"we are solidly in the black, very profitable and the future looks extremely bright for the brand.\\" Greg Strange, Frankfurt Motor Show 2007, accessed 2009-12-10 Personal Popham is married with two children and lives in Warwickshire.

Whisper jokes in Nazi Germany Whisper jokes spread in Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler, and served different purposes. Inside Germany, the jokes voiced criticism against the totalitarian regime, which would otherwise have been subject to persecution. They could thus be seen as a form of resistance. In the occupied areas, and especially in the Nazi ghettos, whisper jokes can be interpreted as a means of a survival mechanism. The following is an example of a whisper joke in Nazi Germany, parodied from the children's prayer: \\"Dear God, make me good / so I can go to heaven\\" (Lieber Gott, mach mich fromm / Da√ü ich in den Himmel komm), rephrased as \\"Dear God, make me dumbNote: \\"dumb\\" (for stumm) here means \\"speechless\\", \\"mute\\", rather than \\"stupid\\". In the cited translation the word was chosen for a rhyme. / so I don't come to Dachau\\" (Lieber Gott, mach mich stumm / Da√ü ich nicht in Dachau kumm). There have been quite a few whisper jokes about Adolf Hitler: Hitler is visiting an asylum. The patients lined up by their beds greet him with \\"Heil Hitler!\\". Only one man stands aside and does not greet. Hitler gets angry and asks him why. He answers: \\"I'm not crazy, I am the head of the ward.\\" Hans- Jochen Gamm, Der Fl√ºsterwitz im Dritten Reich. 2nd edition. List Verlag, M√ºnchen 1964, pp.. 104‚Äì116.

Below is the example of a joke featuring the General Secretary Erich Honecker, a variant from the 2006 Oscar-winning movie The Lives of Others: > Early in the morning, Erich Honecker arrives at his office and opens his > window.

After the fall of Napoleon I in 1814, and again after Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo in 1815, Paris was occupied by foreign forces. To counter new invasion and occupation, defensive works were planned. In 1841 a new fortified enclosure of Paris was proposed, becoming known as the Thiers wall after its chief proponent, prime minister Adolphe Thiers. The plan involved the construction of a new fortified wall around an expanded Paris, the Thiers wall proper, and the building of sixteen new forts a few kilometers farther out. The Fort de Charenton was planned as part of this system. Presently occupied by the National Gendarmerie, the fort saw passing regiments as well as foreign occupation forces at the time of the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 and the Second World War.  History of the Thiers Wall  The Poterne des Peupliers, one of the few vestiges still visible of the Thiers Wall Before the Napoleonic Wars, Paris had not been invaded by an enemy army since the Hundred Years' War. Louis-Philippe, proclaimed king of the French in 1830, was convinced that the key to the defense of France was to prevent Paris from falling too easily into the hands of foreign armies, as in 1814. He conceived a project to build an enclosure of fortifications around the capital that would make the city impregnable. The first project was presented to the Chambre des D√©put√©s at the beginning of 1833 by Marshal Soult, President of the Council and Minister of War. The proposal was sharply opposed by the Left, which suspected, or pretended to suspect, ulterior motives on behalf of the government with respect to internal policy. The Left claimed that the fortifications were actually intended not to defend France, but to threaten Parisians if they revolted against the royal powers. With the walls surrounding Paris a system of 16 detached forts was added, placed a few kilometers away as a first line of defence. Among them was the Fort de Charenton.  Fort de Charenton  The Fort de Charenton is a defensive work located in the town of Maisons-Alfort, by whose name it was originally known. It later took the name of the town it was to defend, Charenton-le-Pont. The fort cost 5 million francs at the time, equivalent to 9 million current euros. Construction lasted five years.  Choice of location  The fort was originally proposed for the plateau of Charenton-Saint-Maurice, where land was purchased, but the military administration changed its opinion and moved the project to its present site. In the middle of the 19th century, Maisons-Alfort was open country. The hill finally chosen, the Butte de Gramont, had clear lines of fire, apart from the National Veterinary School of Alfort, to the northwest. The fort is located at a strategic point that was contested in 1814, where forces under Frederick of W√ºrttemberg attacked the bridges of Charenton, defended by veterinary students and some regular troops, and the bridges of Saint-Maur-des-Foss√©s, obligatory passages on the Marne.Chenal, p.52 The fort commands Route Nationale 6 to Geneva and Route Nationale 19 to Belfort along with the Pont de Charenton on the Marne and the Pont √† l'Anglais on the Seine.  Construction  The fort = Aerial view of the Fort de Charenton, with buildings of the Republican Guard in the foreground, built in the 1930s The fort was built according to the Vauban system. Construction required a site of about 26 hectares, with accompanying difficulties with expropriation from the existing owners. The fort itself occupies an area of approximately 10 hectares with a perimeter of about 1500 metres. The first stone was laid by Louis-Philippe on 19 April 1841 only two weeks after construction was authorized, and the walls were finished the following year. = The caserne = View of one of the fort's two casemates Accommodating several hundred men, the fort's buildings were laid out in 1843 according to the following program: > \\"The barracks will be laid out to accommodate four companies of > approximately 110 men with their warrant officers ... They will be two > stories high above the ground floor and will be composed of a series of bays > with a span of 6.5 metres, with two windows on each frontage They will be > high of two stages above the ground floor, and will be composed d' a series > of spans of 6,50 m width, informed by two windows on each fa√ßade, and are > served two by two, three meters wide and leading directly to the principal > fa√ßade. Moreover, two other staircases entered at the gable ends are located > on each end bay, which are divided into small rooms. The troop quarters are > located on the long sides with communicating openings between them ... they > will have a length of 14.1 metres and a ceiling height of 3.45 metres, and > will accommodate twenty-four beds.\\" \\"The pitched roof will be zinc-covered > with gables at the ends to avoid costs for trusses, on top of the cross > walls starting from the attic floor and supported by masonry pillars, on > which will rest the roof purlins. Moreover, due to the span of the members, > they would otherwise need to be especially heavy, so they have been > augmented by bracing that permits a reduction in their dimension to those > ordinarily found in commercially available timbers.\\" Casemate built by the > Germans during the Second World War on the Fort de Charenton \\"Chimney flues > will be installed in the cross walls at each floor that will be offset to > meet at a single chimney on the ridge of the building.\\" \\"The stairs will be > of wood, with one or two additional steps between the ground and first > floors compared with the flight between the first and second floors, with > sufficient height at the landings to allow access to small rooms behind the > stairs.\\" In 1930 barracks were built outside the fort to accommodate the 3rd cavalry group of the 1st Legion of the Mobile Republican Guard. Ten of these buildings remain along Boulevard Charles de Gaulle. During the German occupation from 1940, small pillboxes with machine guns were built in the point of each bastion.  History  Completed in 1845, the fort was used as a prison following the Revolution of 1848. A few years after the rise of Napoleon III the fort's armament was updated with rifled guns. The long-range guns had a firing range of 3000 metres. During the Franco-German War the fort took part in the defence of Paris against the Prussians. The fort fired at targets in Moulins-Saquet, the Gare-aux-b≈ìufs, Mont-Mesly, and destroyed part of Choisy- le-Roi, which had been occupied by the Prussians.No fire was returned in the direction of the fort or town.Chenal, p.75 After the Prussian victory, the fort was handed over to occupation troops in February 1871, and was evacuated in September the same year. In 1910 the garrison was provided by the 1st group of the 59th artillery regiment. By the First World War the garrison was the 3rd regiment of colonial artillery. In 1914 the fort was occupied by the 32nd divisional regiment, which stayed until the Second World War, when it was sent to the front, and where it was practically destroyed in combat.  After the Second World War  Little information is available concerning the German occupation. The fort was used during this time as an ammunition dump and radio transmitting station. As the Allies advanced on Paris, the fort was abandoned by the Germans on 25 August 1944. Before leaving the Germans set up a timed- detonation device in the hundreds of tons of explosives using an acid-fuse device. The device was defused by bomb disposal expert Roger Fran√ßois and the destruction of the fort and the potential destruction of the town was averted. A plaque commemorates the deed. After 1944 the fort was used by the Gendarmerie and was employed as a center for political prisoners and for juvenile delinquents. The fort was formally transferred to the Gendarmerie in 1950. It was used as a training and assembly center for units destined to the French war in Indo-China, with more than 6000 gendarmes passing through. After the war, other Gendarmerie units were installed at the fort, with the training command occupying the fort from 1959 to 2000. The Groupe d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale (GIGN) was established in 1974 and housed at the Fort de Charenton until 1983, when it moved to Satory. Presently the fort is occupied by various services of the directorate of the Ministry of the Interior and by the regional direction of the Gendarmerie for Ile-de-France.

Born in Beckenham, he lived in Southwark, London, UK and died in Clyst Hydon, Devon, UK. Piers Wardle had a longstanding interest in fractal patterns and found objects, especially sweet packaging Biography After Exeter School where he illustrated the school magazine, designed stage sets for productions and painted a mural of a crow (inspired by Ted Hughes) on the sixth form common room wall, and Exeter College of Art and Design (1978‚Äì79), he went to Oxford's Ruskin School of Drawing (1979‚Äì82), where his friends included the artists William Latham, Adam Lowe, and Helen Elwes. There too he met the poet Stephen Micalef who was at the other Ruskin College. He was member of St Edmund Hall, Oxford. Wardle was perhaps the first British painter to experiment artistically with the ideas of Benoit Mandelbrot and other 'chaos' mathematicians, exploring in his work how 'the complexity associated with natural and organic forms can be generated, in appearance at least, by simple rules' (from Piers Wardle's catalogue for an exhibition held at the Pomeroy Purdy Gallery in April 1989). An interest in chaos and fractals is present throughout Wardle's work as is a love of found objects especially sweet wrappers, packaging and signage. He would go on to explore the artistic potential of computer-generated chaotic patterns. He was the great-grandson of the painter Arthur Wardle. He participated in numerous one man shows and group exhibitions of painting and conceptual art. Initially represented by Purdy Hicks, later Wardle moved to Joshua Compston's Factual Nonsense Gallery. Wardle also contributed a print to Compston's limited edition book Other Men's Flowers. He subsequently exhibited at, amongst others, the Decima Gallery and the Courtauld Institute, and for thirty years collaborated with Stephen Micalef, providing piano accompaniment to the latter's poetry. In addition they produced works on paper; Wardle as Micalef's illustrator. Wardle scanned this painting and installed a copy in its original home in Venice, 2009 Wardle also worked as a picture editor for the Redstone Diary. Recent more formal activities included 'printing' concrete for Anish Kapoor, fixing a Marc Quinn, analysing Caravaggio's brush work in Rome, and scanning both Tutankhamun's tomb and Paolo Veronese's Marriage at Cana, (all of which arranged by Factum Arte).

The purpose of the Institute is \\"To set and promote standards of excellence and lifelong learning for employee benefits and retirement savings professionals and trustees through qualifications, membership and ongoing support services.\\" PMI's members, represented in 8 regions, are responsible for managing and advising some of the largest institutions in the world, accounting for ¬£1trillion invested in pensions. History The PMI was formed in June 1976 by four bodies: The National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF) - now the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, the Society of Pension Consultants (SPC) - now the Society of Pension Professionals, the Association of Consulting Actuaries (ACA) and the Life Insurance Council of the Association of British Insurers (ABI.) These organisations felt that there should be a professional institute dedicated to setting educational standards and qualifications for those advising upon and managing UK pension schemes. Each of those bodies contributed four senior people to sit on the first PMI council. The PMI (in conjunction with the Chartered Insurance Institute) held its initial examinations in 1978. In September 2015, Chief Executive Vince Linnane announced that he would be stepping down after more than thirty years with the PMI, and over ten years in the CEO role. Gareth Tancred was announced as the new CEO in February 2016.

Accessed on 10 May 2011. It is a karst cave developed in dolomite strata that is part of the Zechstein.  History  It was first mentioned in the records in 1541. In 1686 Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz visited the cave and wrote a report about it mentioning the local trade with unicorn artefacts. In those days fossilized bones supposed to be from unicorns were ground and used for making medicine. In the 17th century Otto von Guericke, the mayor of Magdeburg, wrote a newspaper article about the finding of some ancient animal bones in the Zeunickenberg, a Harz mountain near Quedlinburg, in which he held the opinion that the bones were the remains of a unicorn. Based on Guerickes writings Leibniz drew a fictional reconstruction of the unicorn's skeleton using the bones that had been found in the cave and published the drawing in his book Protagaea. In 1872 Rudolf Virchow carried out an excavation there and determined that the unknown bones actually stem from extinct animals like mammoths and cave bears. Over 70 species of animal have been identified from the many bones that have been found, including 60 species of mammal; amongst them the cave lion and the wolf. In 1905 the Unicorn Cave was made accessible to visitors by the construction of an entrance gallery. Since then 270 metres of the total length of 610 metres have been opened up as a show cave. The Unicorn Cave is one of the three information centres of the Harz - Brunswick Land - Eastphalia National Geopark. The Unicorn Cave has a checkpoint (no. 101) which is part of the Harzer Wandernadel network of hiking trails.  Legend  According to a legend the discovery of the cave was linked to the nearby rock church at Scharzfeld. In the cave-like rock church it is said that in heathen times there lived an old and wise woman, who helped people looking for advice. One day she was driven away by a monk in a black habit in the company of Frankish warriors. A unicorn was supposed to have protected her from her pursuers. The woman joined the witches' community on the Witches' Dance Floor on the Brocken mountain. Thereafter the black monk disappeared into a hole in the ground which led to the discovery of the Unicorn Cave. In fact the cave had been known about since the Stone Age and had never been forgotten.

The nomen Caelius is frequently confounded with Coelius and Caecilius, with some individuals referred to as Caelius in manuscripts, while appearing as Coelius or Coilius on coins. Although the Caelii asserted their great antiquity, none of them attained any of the higher offices of the Roman state until the praetorship of Publius Caelius in 74 BC, and the first of this gens who obtained the consulship was Gaius Caelius Rufus in AD 17. The emperor Balbinus was a descendant of the Caelii.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, p. 532 (\\"Caelia or Coelia Gens\\"). Origin The Caelii claimed descent from the Etruscan hero, Caelius Vibenna, whose adventures were legendary in Etruria, but largely forgotten at Rome; the emperor Claudius, who was deeply interested in Etruscan culture, described the adventures of Caelius, his brother, Aulus Vibenna, and their companion, Macstarna, whom Claudius maintained was the same person as Servius Tullius, the sixth King of Rome. The famous Fran√ßois Tomb discovered at Vulci includes a fresco depicting one such episode, in which, aided by a companion, the three heroes and their friends escape from captivity, and slay an enemy named Gnaeus Tarquinius of Rome. Subsequently Vibenna and his followers settled at Rome, on the Querquetulan, or oak-covered hill, which in later times was generally known as the Caelian Hill, one of the famed seven hills of Rome.Varro, De Lingua Latina, v. 46.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, p. 532 (\\"Caeles or Caelius Vibenna\\").Oxford Classical Dictionary. Praenomina The main praenomina of the Caelii during the Republic were Marcus, Publius, Gaius, and Quintus, all amongst the most common names throughout Roman history. In imperial times, some of the Caelii used Gnaeus, also a common praenomen, and Decimus, which was somewhat more distinctive. Branches and cognomina The only cognomen of this gens under the Republic was Rufus, originally typically given to a person with red hair.Chase, p. 110.Cassell's Latin & English Dictionary, s. v. rufus. A variety of surnames are found in imperial times, including Cursor, a runner, Pollio, originally a polisher of armor, and Sabinus, designating someone of Sabine descent or habits.Chase, pp. 111, 114.

He is also a permaculture teacher, designer, consultant and co-founder of Desert Harvesters, a non-profit organization. Lancaster lives on an eighth of an acre in downtown Tucson, Arizona, where rainfall is less than per annum. In such arid conditions, Lancaster consistently models that catching over of rainwater to feed food- bearing shade trees, abundant gardens, and a thriving landscape is a much more viable option than the municipal system of directing it into storm drains and sewer systems.Telis, Gisela. \\"The Care and Watering of a Neighborhood\\", Tucson Green Magazine, January 2008, p.13 Lancaster helped legalize the harvest of street runoff in the city of Tucson, Arizona, with then-illegal water- harvesting curb cuts at his and his brother‚Äôs home and demonstration site that made openings in the street curb to enable street runoff to freely irrigate street-side and in-street water-harvesting/traffic-calming landscapes of food- bearing native vegetation. After proving the concept, Brad then worked with the City of Tucson to legalize, enhance, and incentivize the process. Lancaster co-created and now co-organizes the Neighborhood Foresters program which since 1996 has coordinated volunteer crews of neighbors to plant and steward over 1,500 native food-bearing trees and hundreds of native food- bearing understory plantings within or beside water-harvesting earthworks in his neighborhood, while helping and training volunteers from other neighborhoods to lead similar efforts in their neighborhoods. Desert Harvesters, a non-profit organization Brad co-founded, teaches the public how to identify, harvest, and process many of the native-plant foods neighbors are planting in their neighborhoods. Desert Harvesters also makes the utilization of native foods easier by organizing community milling events that mill native mesquite pods into nutritious and delicious mesquite flour which is utilized by a growing number of restaurants, breweries, and home kitchens.

In 2006 he suffered an assassination attempt in Russia and was severely injured. He recovered and is living in New York City. Russo is an international artist who has recorded songs in a number of languages. He shot to fame with \\"Daleko Daleko\\" a Russian cover of a big Arabic language hit, \\"Tamally Maak\\" by Amr Diab. He has four platinum albums recorded in Russia Amor (2001), Tonight (2002), Prosto Lyubit' (2003) and Obruchalnaya (2006) with songs in Russian and English. Amor, a No. 1 smash in Russia and throughout Eastern Europe. He has sold millions of album copies worldwide. His most recent album is an all-English spiritual album Resurrection (2010) recorded in the United States where he resides with his wife Morela and daughter Emanuela. Early years Born as Apraham Ipjian in the Syrian city of Aleppo to an Armenian family with three brothers. His father was from the city of Ayntab (nowadays Gaziantep) in Cilicia, (√áukurova in modern-day Turkey). Avraam lost his father at an early age and his mother had to serve other households for the survival of the family. His singing talent was discovered while he was performing Armenian liturgical songs during his monastic studies in Aleppo. He also studied in an Armenian Orthodox seminary in Lebanon for a couple of years. After leaving the studies, he was quickly involved in several amateur bands, making part-time appearances in Arab venues and outdoor restaurants (such as \\"Ramaya\\", \\"Aleppo Family Swimming Pool\\", \\"Somar\\", Orouba Club, etc.) and in hotels like \\"Al Amir\\" in Aleppo.AZAD-Hye Middle East Portal During these years he was affectionately known as Apig or Apo, derivatives of his birthname Apraham. In 1993 he went to Cyprus and worked in night clubs for two years earning meagre salaries. But his presence in Cyprus proved important for his future career, as he got the attention of a Russian Azerbaijan-Jewish tycoon Telman Ismailov (originally from Baku, Azerbaijan SSR and now Vice President of the Euro-Asian Jewish Congress) who, during one of his business trips to Cyprus, attended Avraam's performance and liked his work very much. Being owner of big retail businesses and entertainment outlets including \\"Prague Restaurant\\" and a well connected entrepreneur, he invited Avraam to take part in multilingual performances in Russia taking the Russian name Avraam Russo. Russian career Avraam's first trip to Moscow in 1995 landed him fame in a relatively short time. With the help of a girlfriend, he quickly learned the Russian language and prepared a repertoire in many languages, exactly the way he used to do in Syria and Cyprus with Middle Eastern and European influences. His command of European languages was also impressive. There was always a kind of mystery about his origin and he was subject of many speculations as to his origins. But despite pressure from his Syrian compatriots, he himself did not explicitly refer to his ethnic background, due to an informal agreement he made with his management team even before receiving wide recognition. American career After his miraculous recovery and ability to walk again after his serious injuries and after a hiatus of 4 years in New York, Avraam Russo released his fifth studio album entitled Resurrection in early 2010 conveying his faith in Christianity which he credits for his survival. Resurrection is also his first-ever all-English Christian spiritual record recorded in Nashville, Tennessee. He infuses great spiritual depth and passion into the work produced by Dove Award winner Joe Beck and by Jim Frazier, In December 2009 he released the first single \\"Peace\\"Music video for \\"Peace\\" by Avraam Russo taken from the album. The song is about child soldiers and released in aid of the Invisible Children charity.Invisible Children Official website In 2009 he officially opened his own restaurant \\"Heaven\\" in New York. In January 2010, Avraam Russo returned to Russia and gave a series of concerts in various Russian cities. He is currently preparing to release a new album in Russian language. Abraham also recorded a duet in Amsterdam named \\"–õ—É–Ω–Ω–∞—è —Å–æ–Ω–∞—Ç–∞\\" (\\"Moonlight Sonata\\") with Kazakh singer Diana Shik. Awards In 2002 Avraam Russo won the Russian national top award for \\"Song of the Year\\" (\\"Pesnya Goda\\") for his international hit \\"Daleko Daleko\\"Music video for \\"Daleko Daleko\\" by Avraam Russo (Far Away in Russian), a cover version of the 2000 Arabic language massive hit \\"Tamally Maak\\"YouTube performed by Egyptian pan-Arab superstar Amr Diab.

Known as Ridgely Avenue, the highway runs from Maryland Route 435 in Annapolis north to the end of state maintenance in Parole. MD 436 was constructed along part of MD 435 in the late 1920s. MD 436 was moved to its present course in two steps in the mid-1950s and mid-1970s. Route description View south at the north end of MD 436 south of Bestgate Road in Parole MD 436 begins at an intersection with MD 435 (Taylor Avenue) near the campus of the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis. The highway heads northwest as a two-lane undivided street through the West Annapolis neighborhood. MD 436 crosses Weems Creek on a drawbridge and leaves the city of Annapolis. The highway crosses over U.S. Route 50 and US 301 immediately to the east of the freeway's interchange with MD 70. The bridge over the freeway is between intersections with Riverside Avenue and Acorn Drive, which are unsigned MD 783 and MD 784, respectively. MD 436 reaches its northern terminus just south of Ridgely Avenue's intersection with Bestgate Road and Wilson Road in Parole. History What is now Ridgely Avenue was laid out by West Annapolis developer George T. Melvin in 1889, and a wooden swing bridge across Weems Creek was constructed shortly thereafter. The Maryland State Roads Commission paved several streets with concrete in West Annapolis in 1929 and 1930; those streets became part of four state highways. MD 436 was constructed along Annapolis Street from Taylor Avenue to MD 2 (now MD 450). MD 436 followed a piece of what is now MD 435; MD 435 originally followed Taylor Avenue north to Annapolis Street, followed Annapolis Street to Severn Avenue (now Melvin Avenue), then followed Severn Avenue to Wardour Drive. The two other state highways in West Annapolis were MD 437, which followed what is now MD 436 along Revell Street (now Ridgely Avenue) from Taylor Avenue to Severn Avenue, and MD 438, which followed Severn Avenue west one block from Annapolis Street then north along what is now MD 436. The wooden bridge across Weems Creek was also replaced with a more modern concrete structure at that time. West Annapolis on the 1956 Maryland State highway map. MD 436 was placed on much of its modern routing in 1954, the same year MD 435 assumed its modern course between intersections with MD 450. MD 436 replaced MD 435 on Annapolis Street from Taylor Avenue to Melvin Avenue and superseded MD 438 west one block along Melvin Avenue and north along Ridgely Avenue to its present terminus. The Melvin Avenue part of MD 435 became MD 438. MD 437 remained along Ridgely Avenue between Taylor Avenue and Melvin Avenue. MD 436 replaced MD 437 on the portion of Ridgely Avenue between MD 435 and Melvin Avenue and MD 437 and MD 438 were removed from the state highway system in 1975. MD 436's original bridge across US 50 was constructed when the Annapolis Bypass was built between 1952 and 1954. MD 436 had access with the freeway via a pair of right-in/right-out ramps at the end of MD 783 and MD 784 on the eastbound and westbound sides of the freeway, respectively. The right-in/right-out interchanges were removed when US 50 was reconstructed at its MD 70 interchange in 1991; MD 436's modern bridge across US 50 was constructed the same year. The state highway's current swing bridge across Weems Creek was completed in 1997, replacing the structure built in 1929.

Built c. 1830, the building is in a sparsely populated neighborhood and is accessed via an unpaved road north of Fox Hollow Road. The lot covers of land, characterized by hills and open fields with lightly wooded areas. The building itself sits at the crest of a knoll overlooking two large ponds. The ponds were created by the Fallsburg Creek, which forms the eastern boundary of the property. It is a two-story building with features of the late Federal and early Greek Revival styles. Its interior displays a high level of architectural integrity. A barn and shed complex is located north of the main house. The one-and-a-half-story barn, a contributing aspect to the property, was built in the late nineteenth-century. The shed is attached to the southwest corner of the barn, and was built in the twentieth century. A contributing nineteenth-century corn crib lies east of the barn and shed. It is believed that John Barringer acquired the property in 1806. The Barringer family were early settlers of Rhinebeck. Based on its design features, the house is thought to have been erected around 1930. Whether it was built by John Barringer or another Barringer is unknown. It is considered a historically significant example of distinctive late Federal/early Greek Revival residential architecture in Rhinebeck. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 9, 1987.

Rev. 191, 197-98, 205-14 (2010). to apply to financial firms with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets. The fee would have been payable until the firm had paid off all money provided to it under the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP).http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press- office/president-obama-proposes-financial-crisis-responsibility-fee-recoup- every-last-penn Approximately 50 banks and similar firms would have been charged the fee, raising a total of roughly $9 billion a year for at least 10 years. The fee would continue to be payable for longer if required to fully recover TARP costs. The fee would only apply to those U.S. firms, or firms that received TARP subsidies, with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets. The fee would be calculated by taking the total assets, subtracting that amount from Tier 1 capital and insured deposits, and then tax the remaining amount at a 0.15% rate. In February 2010, the Obama Administration made an announcement to further justify the imposition of the fee: > \\"Excessive risk undertaken by major financial firms was a significant cause > of the recent financial crisis. . . . The fee would . . . provide a > deterrent against excessive leverage for the largest financial > firms.\\"http://www.docstoc.com/docs/24029384/Administration%E2%80%99s-Fiscal- > Year-2011-Revenue-Proposals As of February 2012, the fee had still not been enacted.In His Budget, President Obama Backs A 'Responsibility Fee' For Financial Firms The fee was proposed to satisfy the requirement in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which authorized TARP, to propose specific measures to recoup TARP losses from the financial industry.The Proposed ‚ÄúFinancial Crisis Responsibility Fee‚Äù If the proposal had passed, the proceeds would have gone into general government revenue and been used to pay the TARP costs of the 2008 financial crisis rather than gone into an insurance fund in anticipation of the next one. Evaluation This proposal has received mixed support. It was endorsed in a Tulane Law Review article that evaluated it along with other financial- industry tax-reform proposals, including the Defazio Financial Transactions Tax. The author favorably noted that the plan would (1) \\"eviscerate . . . a preexisting tax law preference for debt financing,\\" and (2) \\"discourage the [concentration of power in] massive banks.\\" Nonetheless, the author expressed concern that the Fee would (1) increase tax-compliance costs and (2) be unfair to stockholders of the affected banks.

Bassir is bordered from the east by Lejah, from the south by Khabab, from the west by Al-Sanamayn and from the north by Jebab. It is situated in the middle of three main cities in Syria: Damascus, Daraa and As-Suwayda. Etymology The word Bassir comes from the word \\"Pethera\\" that means in Greek \\"high\\" or \\"elevated\\" being situated in a relatively high location. History Bassir was built as a military base for Roman forces in order to aid the military regiments scattered in the adjacent region. This region is a rocky area, consisting of volcano and lava stones and is known as \\"Lajah\\". Bassir was also a pit stop for caravans traveling between Babylon and Palestine. In 1596 Bassir appeared in the Ottoman tax registers as Busayr al-Kubra and was part of the nahiya of Bani Kilab in the Hauran Sanjak. It had an entirely Muslim population consisting of 4 households and 3 bachelors. The villagers paid a fixed tax-rate of 25% on wheat, barley, summer crops, goats and beehives; a total of 2,900 ak√ße.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 210 Demographics=Population People from this area are known to be part of the Ghassanid Christians tribes that immigrated in the early 3rd century CE from Yemen to Hauran in southern Syria and established the kingdom of the Ghassanids. The population is about 3000, but unlike other neighboring villages, Bassir has a very low birth rate and significantly declined through the years. Many people originally from Bassir live in Damascus but yet own homes in the village. As in many other areas of Syria during the time of Ottoman Empire and due to the lack of resources, a notable number of civilians were immigrated to South America including Brazil and Argentina. Other people also were immigrated to adjacent countries i.e. Lebanon and currently live in Beqaa Valley and Alcoura region near Tripoli. Religion Bassir's inhabitants are Christians and follow the Melkite Greek Catholic Church. It is similar to what is seen in their neighboring sister villages: Khabab, Izra', Tubna, Shaqra that all their current citizens originally immigrated from Salkhad. There used to be two ancient Byzantine churches in Bassir: One of them, was built after the conversion to Christianity and entirely demolished. The other church is still buried under the church that is built during the late 19th and early 20th century and is newly renovated. The latter church believed to be first used by the new settler of Bassir. Education Bassir is a well known of highlight educated people and it was once called \\"home of light\\", because of the high number of educated people that spread the knowledge and education to other surrounding towns throughout the years. During the last 50 years, some people immigrated to many countries such France and United States mostly to pursue higher education. Many famous scientists and scholars were born in this small town including physicians, engineers and politicians. Architecture The houses in Bassir are made of volcanic and Lava stones that are currently used to build the new houses of the village.

Most of the lawsuits took place between 1508 and 1536. Background The Capitulations of Santa Fe, between Christopher Columbus and the Catholic Monarchs Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon, signed in Santa Fe, Granada on April 17, 1492 granted Columbus, among other things, the tenth part of all riches to be obtained from his intended voyage.John Michael Francis, Will Kaufman. Iberia and the Americas, ABC-CLIO, 2005, p. 176 Although not a formal agreement, the capitulations resulted from negotiation. During Columbus's third voyage, he encountered hostility from other Spaniards in Hispaniola, who felt deceived by Columbus's promises of riches. On several occasions, Columbus attempted to ally with the rebellious Ta√≠nos and Caribs against other Spaniards. Others, returning separately from America, accused him before the royal court of poor governance. The king and queen sent royal administrator Francisco de Bobadilla to Hispaniola in 1500, and upon his arrival (23 August), Columbus and his brothers were arrested and sent back to Spain in chains. Link is to Google Books. Upon arriving in Spain, he regained his liberty but lost a great deal of his prestige and power. Link is to Google Books. Upon Columbus's death in 1506, he was succeeded as Admiral of the Indies by his oldest son, Diego. In 1508, King Ferdinand in his capacity as regent of Castile, gave Diego Col√≥n the additional office of Governor of the Indies \\"for the time my mercy and will would have it\\" (el tiempo que mi merced e voluntad fuere). Link is to Google Books. Diego Col√≥n held that it was \\"in perpetuity\\" and initiated a lawsuit against the Crown.  Lawsuit  In 1511 the first verdict was given, in Seville. The judges recognized for the line of Columbus the position of viceroys in perpetuity and the right to a tenth of the benefits obtained from the Indies. The Crown received, among other things, the right to name appellate judges. Neither party was satisfied, and both sides appealed. In 1512, the suit was combined with the pleito del Dari√©n, a suit over whether the jurisdiction of Columbus's heirs extended to the mainland of America (the tierra firme). The name Dari√©n, still used for the Dari√©n Gap in Panama near Colombia, then referred to a far larger and somewhat indefinite region extending further into Central America. In 1520 was a new verdict, known as the \\"Declaration of La Coru√±a\\" (after the Galician city, now A Coru√±a). In 1524, Diego Col√≥n was deposed from his position as governor and instituted a new suit against the Crown. He died two years later, but his widow continued the suit in the name of their son, Luis, a minor at the time. The primary representative of the family at this time, if not the one with the standing for the suit, was Diego's brother, Fernando Col√≥n. A verdict in Valladolid on 25 June 1527 declared the previous verdicts annulled and ordered a new trial. The new royal prosecutor attempted to demonstrate that the discovery of the West Indies had principally been achieved thanks to Mart√≠n Alonso Pinz√≥n, not Columbus. He called as witnesses surviving members of the crew of the first voyage to America. Two verdicts were given: in Due√±as (1534) and in Madrid (1535), but both were appealed. Arbitration Both parties finally submitted to arbitration. On 28 June 1536 the president of the Council of the Indies, Bishop Garc√≠a de Loaysa, and the president of the Council of Castile, Gaspar de Montoya. delivered the following arbitration: * They confirmed the title of Admiral of the Indies in perpetuity to the line of Columbus, with privileges analogous to those of the Admiral of Castile. * They removed the titles of Viceroy and Governor General of the Indies. * They established a seigneury for Columbus's heirs consisting mainly of the island of Jamaica (with the title of Marquess of Jamaica), a territory of 25 leagues square in Veragua (with the title of Duke of Veragua). * They confirmed the heirs' possession of their lands in the Hispaniola and the perpetuity of the titles of alguacil mayor (\\"high sheriff\\") of Santo Domingo and of the Audiencia (tribunal) of the island. * They ordered a payment of 10,000 ducats annually to the heirs of Columbus as well as 500,000 maraved√≠es per year to each of the sisters of Luis Col√≥n.  Minor lawsuits  After the arbitration of 1536, minor lawsuits between the Columbus family and the Crown continued, but they were not of comparable importance. Lawsuits occurred between 1537 and 1541, between 1555 and 1563, and sporadically until the end of the 18th century.  Historical interest  Both the Columbus family and the Crown took testimony from witnesses to the various Castilian voyages of discovery to America. It has been a fundamental source of information for historians who study the era, but the accuracy of some of the testimonies is open to doubt.

It is particularly noteworthy because it grew out of practical application and was relatively detached from the scientific community. Introduction Sepp Holzer started reorganising his father's property according to ecological patterns in the early 1960s after he took over the farm. As an adolescent he conducted layman experiments with plants native to the area and learned from his own observations. Since having taken over his father's property, he has expanded it from 24 to 45 hectares. according to his methods together with his wife. His expanded farm now spans over 45 hectares of forest gardens, including 70 ponds, and is said to be the most consistent example of permaculture worldwide. In the past he has experimented with many different animals. As a result of these experiments, there is a huge role for animals in the Holzer Permaculture. He has created some of the world's best examples of using ponds as reflectors to increase solar gain for passive solar heating of structures, and of using the microclimate created by rock outcrops to effectively change the hardiness zone for nearby plants. He has also done original work in the use of H√ºgelkultur and natural branch development instead of pruning (see Fruit tree pruning) to allow fruit trees to survive high altitudes and harsh winters. Comparison to regular permaculture It is difficult to make out differences between the methods and practices of Sepp Holzer in contrast to the more scientific and theoretical permacultural mainstream. Nevertheless, here are some major points to consider: * His designs are mostly aimed at raising temperatures and creating micro-climates with rocks, ponds and living wind barriers, in an area with 4 ¬∞C on the average and -20 ¬∞C in the winter. The ponds he makes do not contain any pond liner. Instead, he makes the ponds watertight by sifting the fine from the coarse soil in the earth pile dug up with the excavator. The excavator is then used to pile only the coarse soil up into walls which are then tamped down using the excavator's bucket. The bottom of the pond, he makes watertight by vibrating the excavator's bucket when the pond has been filled with 30‚Äì40 cm of water. * Another aspect was the necessity of creating terraces on his farm's hillsides leading him to the use of heavy machinery (like excavators). Many of the terraces he construct are also given a humus storage ditch (placed in between the terraces). * Famous is his H√ºgelkultur technique, which is basically the use of raised beds in which he uses bulky material such as tree trunks. On his farm, he made a pick-your- own area where visitors can pick their own produce from the raised beds and then pay for it at a counter upon leaving the area. * He uses animal labor alongside human labor, working his farm with only two people. He optimizes the natural patterns of animal behavior to reduce human or machine-driven labor. As an example: he uses swine to \\"plow\\" new beds for sowing. This is a very effective way of digging, as the only thing he has to do is to throw some corn and fruit on the spot he wants dug up. A couple of days later, he can bring the pigs back to their enclosure and plant new plants in the bed. Holzer is able to successfully grow his plants without using any fertilizer. The animals he uses are all heirloom races, which are hardy and require (almost) no maintenance. Some races of swine he uses are Mangalitza, Swabian Hall Swine, Duroc, and Turopolje. He also keeps quail, capercaillie, hazel grouse, wisent, Scottish highland cattle, Hungarian steppe cattle, Dahomey miniature cattle, American bison, yak, water buffalo. He has the animals live outside, in paddocks/shelters and has them share space with orchards and forests. Many of the fruit trees in the orchards (especially those on very sloped terrain) are used exclusively to feed the animals. They collect it as it falls to the ground (those trees are hence not being picked/ nor is produce of it sold) * He also does not prune fruit trees much nor does he cut the lower branches on fruit trees (as this can hurt the tree -due to the lignification not being able to complete before frost and the fact that the unpruned fruit trees survives snow loads that will break pruned trees.Ferguson, Julia. Ecological farming, permaculture; Alpine Garden of Eden proves Mother Nature knows best. Reuters. Retrieved August 7, 2011.-. He also says that leaving the branches on protects the tree against browsing by animals. He does however makes a point of using deep-rooted pioneer plants such as lupins, sweet clover, lucerne and broom. These crops are said to aerate the soil and make sure no water is left standing near the tree. No use is made of wire meshes as protection against voles, since he states they are not efficient in preventing damage from voles using this technique anyway. He makes no use of contemporary fruit tree cultivars, but only uses (very strong/hardy) old, local (heirloom) cultivars. In addition to (old cultivars of) regular fruit trees, he also plants much fruit tree species that are specific to use in phytotherapy or which can only function as animal feed (i.e. crab apple, wild pear, wild cherry, blackthorn, rowan, wild service, service tree, cornelian cherry, snowy mespilus, ...). Similar to mainstream permaculture, he makes no use of chemical fertiliser or pesticides, at all.Sepp Holzer's permaculture by Sepp Holzer] Due to the altitude he's at, his trees bear fruit later, meaning he can sell it after most (sealevel) farmers sold their produce. Due to this (and the fact that he produces heirloom fruit varieties, and not regular varieties), he is often able to get a better price for it. In some cases, customers (like distilleries) are even willing to pick the fruit themselves, eliminating the labour expense for him. * He grows many old cereals on his farm, such as einkorn, emmer, black emmer, spelt, fichtelgebirgshafer, wild rye, black oats, naked oats, barley, Siberian grain (secale cereale, Russian cultivar), tauernroggen, ... * He also makes much use of green manure crops (like stinging nettle, phacelia, yellow, white and narrow-leaved lupin, garden pea, grass pea, fodder & Kidney vetch, yellow, subterranean, Crimson, Persian, Egyptian, red & white sweet clover, Birdsfoot trefoil, lucerne, black medick, Sainfoin, Serradella, fiddleneck, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichoke, Gold-of- pleasure, ...)and grows these crops extensively on his farm. He leaves them standing in autumn, rather than digging them in. He instead relies on natural decay of the plants. He often relies on the natural spreading of the seeds of the crops for their re-sowing. * Another aspect is the abandonment of other horticultural principles such as intercropping plants with very high and very low pH requirements (for example, Rhododendron with roses). Instead, Holzer mixes thirty or more different types of seeds in a bucket and tosses the mix richly onto a larger area. The Krameterhof Situated in Ramingstein on the slopes of Mount Schwarzenberg his farm (Krameterhof) lies at varying elevations ranging from 1100 to 1500 metres above sea level. The exceptionally harsh climatic conditions in the area are generally considered inappropriate for farming. Nevertheless, he has managed to cultivate a variety of crops and even exotic plants like Kiwis and Sweet Chestnut. The Krameterhof is less an operational enterprise, in terms of crop-yield (although it does provide numerous sorts of produce for the community), and more a fully functional showcase or research station for permaculture. Endangered livestock species and rare alpine- and cultural plant species are integrated into the farm.

The crab is found along the north and northwest coast of Australia (approximately from Dampier to the Gulf of Carpentaria and on Papua New Guinea's northwest coast). According to Crane, the species U. mjoebergi should be classified as a subspecies of Uca lactea, which in turn is a member of the subgenus Celuca. More recent works, however, classify the species separately in the subgenus Paraleptuca or subgenus Austruca. Claw bluffing Male U. mjoebergi rely heavily on their enlarged claw to signal dominance and fighting prowess. Crabs which lose their large claw will occasionally regenerate a lighter, cheaper claw (requiring less energy to produce). Research has shown that, while crabs with these 'cheap' claws are worse fighters than crabs with strong claws of a similar size, they are just as effective at intimidating other crabs based on claw size alone.

There are three venues in the Guildhall catering for various event formats: the Guildhall itself, the Solent Suite and a lecture theatre. History The Guildhall, which was designed with a large portico with six Ionic order columns with pediment above, was intended to complement the rest of the Civic Suite and was opened by the Earl of Derby on 13 February 1937. Internally, the principal room was the main hall which was long, wide and high. It contains a pipe organ, designed by John Compton, which was installed shortly before the opening of the building. The organ is unusual in that it has two distinct consoles: a classical concert organ and a theatre organ. The consoles share the same body of pipes which are housed in chambers above the proscenium arch. At some 4,000 pipes it was also the largest organ ever made by Compton. The guildhall was used to accommodate French troops, who had escaped from France in June 1940 during the Dunkirk evacuation. During the Southampton Blitz in November 1940, the Guildhall was damaged by a bomb that fell at the rear of the hall causing damage to the rooms behind the stage and killing one person. Another bomb penetrated into the basement below the stage before exploding. The building was also hit by numerous incendiary devices. The Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, visited the guildhall during a tour of the city in January 1941 and it was used for high-level military conferences in spring and summer 1944 in anticipation of the Normandy landings which were coordinated from Southwick House. A new sprung floor was installed in the main hall in 1955 enabling the guildhall to become a major music venue. Leading performers at the guildhall included rock bands, The Rolling Stones, in March 1964, and The Who, in October 1971, and singer-songwriter, David Bowie, in March 1972 during his Ziggy Stardust Tour. On 7 October 2013, the venue was renamed to the O2 Guildhall Southampton, reflecting a partnership between Live Nation UK and O2 Telef√≥nica.

Biography  Nikolay Slavyanov was born on 5 May 1854 in the village of Nikolskoye, Zadonsky Uyezd, Voronezh Governorate. Nikolay's father, Gavriil Nikolayevich Slavyanov, was part of the Volyn regiment, where he participated in the Crimean War, during the Battle of Malakoff (part of the Siege of Sebastopol) against French forces. His father retired in 1856 for health reasons. Nikolay's mother, Sofia Alekseyevna (n√©e Shakhovskaya), was the daughter of a Kursk landowner. Nikolay Slavyanov graduated from the Voronezh gymnasium. From 1872, he studied at the St. Petersburg Mining Institute. Immediately after graduating from the institute in 1877, he was sent to the private Votkinsk State Mining Plant, where progressed from a trainee position to that of inspector of the mechanical and lathe shops, and then went on to become the chief mechanic of the plant. In the autumn of 1877, he married Varvara Vasilyevna Olderogge. Between 1881-1883, he worked at the Omutninsk factories. Then he moved to Perm. From December 1883 until the end of his life, he worked at the Perm cannon factories, where he made most of his inventions. In 1887, at the Perm cannon factory, he opened a power plant that worked with dynamo machines and arc lamps. The power plant was assigned to illuminate the plant at night. In Yekaterinburg, in the summer of 1887, a dynamo-car, arc lamps, and various of his electrical measuring instruments were exhibited at a two-week Ural- Siberian scientific and industrial exhibition. He died on 5 October 1897 from heart rupture. He was buried in the grounds of the Holy Trinity Church. In 1948 he was reburied near the Perm Polytechnic College named after N. G. Slavyanov.  Scientific studies  In November 1888, N.G. Slavyanov made practical use of arc welding for a metal, for the first time in the world. This meant keeping the surface of the metal fluid during casting in order to better degas the casting to avoid blowholes. An electric arc is used for this purpose in the process. In connection with this process, he chosen not to call his method \\"welding\\" but rather \\"electric casting of metals\\" (). Before him only carbon electrodes had been used in such processes. Slavyanov worked on improving the quality of the metal needed to forge gun barrels. Metal was poured into a hollow cast, from above, then with the help of the electric arc the metal was heated. The resulting gas bubbles went from bottom to top and the metal lay tightly without seams and slits, the procedure being referred to as the \\"electrical compaction of metals\\" (). He used this process, for example, to weld the crankshaft of the steam engine in one of the shops of the Perm cannon factories. To demonstrate the capabilities of the welding machine, Nikolay Gavrilovich, having shaped a glass, welded seven non-melting metals and alloys: bell bronze, tombac, nickel, steel, cast iron, copper, nickel silver, and bronze (\\"Slavyanov's glass\\", ). For this innovative contribution to engineering, he received a gold medal at the world electrotechnical exhibition in 1893 in Chicago, with the citation: \\"For producing a technical revolution.\\" In metallurgy, N.G. Slavyanov proposed a \\"vanishing method\\": in order to eliminate the leakage of molten base and electrode metal, the workpiece consisted of coke or quartz moulding. To protect against the harmful effects of the atmosphere, he proposed closing the welding site with slag, the thickness of which would not prevent the passage of electric current. Slavyanov proposed an automatic regulator of the length of the welding arc, which he called an \\"electric smelting device,\\" which enabled the use of a dynamo car in place of a storage battery.

Part of the Battle of Malaya, it was the first notable naval engagement since the sinking of the battleship Prince of Wales and the battlecruiser Repulse on 10 December 1941, and the last effort by the Royal Navy to intercept Japanese convoy shipping around the Malay Peninsula.Dull 2007, p. 40 A Japanese convoy approaching Endau was detected by reconnaissance aircraft on 26 January and was ineffectually attacked multiple times by Allied aircraft as it was landing its troops. The Allies suffered heavy casualties, while the Japanese lost only a single aircraft. The Royal Navy committed two destroyers later that day to break up the Japanese landings, despite the much larger Japanese escort force. Sailing under the cover of darkness, they were able to locate the convoy anchored there without being detected, but could not find the troopships in the darkness. The ships attempted to disengage, but were fired upon by the convoy's escorts and one destroyer was sunk in the early morning hours of 27 January. Background The sinking of and in the opening stages of the Malayan Campaign left the task of intercepting Japanese convoys in the Gulf of Siam to the submarines of the Royal Netherlands Navy as the surface ships were occupied escorting Allied convoys to and from Ceylon and the Dutch East Indies.Gill, p. 502 The Dutch recorded their first success when the troopship was sunk off Kota Bharu on 12 December 1941, probably by . On 24 December, sank the destroyer Sagiri off the coast of Kuching, Borneo.Rohwer 2005, p. 126 Several other vessels were also damaged or sunk during the early weeks, but losses were high for the Dutch submarines and they could do little to stem the Japanese advance. Endau Seribuat, circled in red; Endau is at far left An amphibious landing at Mersing was originally planned by the Japanese to sever the lines of communication between the British forces and Singapore, but the Southern Expeditionary Army Group decided to land the rest of the 18th Division at Singora instead, believing that the Allied defences at Mersing were too formidable. Although ground forces captured Endau on 21 January, they lacked the strength to break through the Australian defences at Sungei-Mersing. On 20 January 1942, a convoy of eleven troopships departed Cam Ranh Bay, Indochina, to unload ground forces at Singora, of which two would proceed to Endau.Rohwer 2005, p. 137 The two transports, Kansai Maru and Canberra Maru, were carrying troops of the 96th Airfield Battalion, assigned to bring the airfields of Kahang and Kluang into operation. They were escorted by the 1st Escort Unit, which was formed around Torpedo Squadron 3, which consisted of the light cruiser Sendai, flagship of Rear-Admiral Shintar≈ç Hashimoto, and six s, , , , , , and . The squadron was augmented with the five s of the 1st Minesweeper Division, three s of the 11th Submarine Chaser Division, and four converted patrol boats.Cannon, pp. 62‚Äì64 Air attacks An Australian Hudson, c. 1940 Malaya Command anticipated that the Japanese force would soon be reinforced by a naval convoy, a suspicion confirmed on 26 January when two Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Lockheed Hudson aircraft sighted them north of Endau. Although they spotted the Japanese convoy at 07:45, their radio transmissions were jammed, and news did not reach higher command until they landed in Singapore at 09:20. The RAF decided to attack the convoy with all available aircraft. The attack had to be delayed until that afternoon, however, to allow the crews of the Vickers Vildebeest and Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers of No. 36 Squadron RAF and No. 100 Squadron RAF to rest after their night missions.Shores, Cull and Izawa 1993, pp. 18‚Äì19 The decision to use the elderly Vildebeest biplanes against the ships in daylight came as a shock to the pilots, who had been restricted to the relative safety of night sorties following the first day of the invasion.Shores, Cull and Izawa 1992, pp. 83‚Äì84 Vickers Vildebeest of No. 100 Squadron RAF making a torpedo drop during target practice, c. 1936 The first air attack was carried out by the Vildebeests of Nos. 36 and 100 Squadrons and the Hudsons of Nos. 1 and 8 Squadron RAAF. Twelve Vildebeests and nine Hudson bombers took off from Singapore in the early afternoon of 26 January, with a fighter escort composed of twelve Brewster F2A Buffalos and nine Hawker Hurricanes.Shores, Cull and Izawa 1993, pp. 19‚Äì20 The Japanese landings on Endau had been in progress for over four hours by the time the planes arrived at 15:00.Warren 2007, p. 188 The Japanese naval force had air cover consisting of 19 Nakajima Ki-27s from the 1st and 11th Squadrons and a single Nakajima Ki-44 fighter.Shores, Cull and Izawa 1993, p. 20 Despite heavy opposition, the two transports were bombed, and men and equipment on the beach were strafed.Dull 2007, pp. 40‚Äì41 Five Vildebeests were lost in the attack, including the commanding officer of No. 100 Squadron, while one Ki-27 was shot down.Shores, Cull and Izawa 1993, pp. 22‚Äì29 A second wave set off from Singapore at 16:15, consisting of seven Vildebeests and three Albacores of No. 36 Squadron and two Vildebeests of No. 100 Squadron. They arrived over Endau at 17:30, but their escort of seven Hurricanes and four Buffalos were late and the British biplanes were set upon by ten Ki-27s and two Ki-44s before their escorts could reach them. Five Vildebeests, two Albacores and one Hurricane were lost from this wave.Shores, Cull and Izawa 1993, pp. 29‚Äì37 Of the 72 aircrew from Nos. 36 and 100 Squadrons who participated in the raids, 27 were killed, seven were wounded and two were captured. The returning pilots were congratulated by Air Vice-Marshal Paul Maltby, who promised them that further daylight attacks were unnecessary.Warren 2007, p. 189 A third raid, consisting of six unescorted Hudsons of No. 62 Squadron RAF, flying from Palembang, Sumatra, attacked shortly afterwards, losing two of their number, with their entire crews, to six Ki-27s. A fourth raid, made up of five Bristol Blenheims of No. 27 Squadron RAF, set off from Palembang later in the day, but had only got as far as Singapore by sunset, so aborted the mission.Shores, Cull and Izawa 1993, pp. 37‚Äì38 Despite claims to have scored multiple hits on both transports and a cruiser, neither the transports, nor any of their escorts were damaged; the former were hit by splinters that killed 8 and wounded 18, but Sendai and the smaller ships were untouched.Cannon, p. 64 Naval battle The minesweeper W-4 at anchor, July 1930 Rear-Admiral Ernest Spooner, commander of naval forces at Singapore, ordered his only combat-ready warships, the elderly destroyers and , to attack the shipping off Endau later that night. Commander William Moran was captain of Vampire while Thanet was under the command of Lieutenant Commander Bernard Davies. The destroyers departed Singapore at 16:30 with Moran in charge of the two ships and headed north. Initial intelligence reports assessed the Japanese strength defending the convoy as a dozen destroyers, but this was revised downward to a pair of destroyers at 22:55, based on inaccurate reporting by surviving RAF aircrew. The 1st Escort Unit was prepared for a surface attack based on an incorrect intelligence report that two British light cruisers were at sea and Hashimoto oriented his ships' patrol sectors to the north.Cannon, pp. 64‚Äì65, 69 Moran led his ships between the Seribuat Archipelago and the coast of Johor in brilliant moonlight and then altered course northeast to search the area north of the archipelago. When dark clouds obscured the moon at 01:51, he turned southwestwards at a speed of for Endau, keeping Tioman Island behind him to ensure that his ships were not silhouetted against the horizon. At 02:37, Vampire saw a Japanese destroyer (probably Amagiri), but was not spotted in return and the Allied ships continued on their course. Three minutes later, they located another Japanese ship (the minesweeper W-4) dead ahead at point- blank range. Moran decided to attack, as discovery was inevitable at such short range, and increased his speed to , simultaneously firing two of his three torpedoes at a distance of . One torpedo missed ahead by and the other passed underneath the minesweeper. W-4, in the middle patrol zone, was trying to identify the two destroyers when Moran attacked, but failed to alert any other Japanese ships to the Allied presence in their midst for 20 minutes before giving a location away. W-4 did not return fire and Moran resumed his search for the transports, reducing his speed again to 15 knots to reduce the visibility of his wakes. A half-hour later, with shallow water approaching, and no transports spotted, the Allied destroyers altered course to the north to clear the shallows and increased speed to 25 knots at 03:13 before turning southeast by east.Cannon, pp. 68‚Äì71 Shirayuki at anchor, 1931 At 03:18, Vampire sighted the destroyer Shirayuki off the port bow and another ship astern. Vampire and Thanet made minor course adjustments to fire their torpedoes at Shirayuki at a range of ‚Äì one from Vampire and all four of Thanets ‚Äì but all missed as Shirayuki, having spotted the Allied ships at the same time, altered course to come behind the Allied destroyers and then signalled to confirm their identities. Not receiving a reply, the Japanese ship illuminated the Allied ships with her searchlight and finally opened fire at 03:31 despite the smoke screen being laid by both ships. Moran ordered both his ships to return fire with their four-inch guns while retiring southeast at maximum speed. Thanet only fired three volleys from her guns before she was hit in the engine room. The hit fractured both the main and auxiliary steam lines to the engines, causing the ship to go dead in the water and lose all electrical power. Constantly making small changes of course to throw off Japanese gun layers, neither ship hit any Japanese ships during the battle.Cannon, pp. 70‚Äì75, 78‚Äì79 Allied and Japanese accounts of the gunnery action are difficult to reconcile, particularly as neither of the Allied destroyers recorded any times after firing their torpedoes at 03:18. Shirayuki fired 18 rounds at Vampire at a range of before the muzzle blast from her rear gun mounts tripped the circuit breakers in her main electrical switchboard, causing complete electrical failure throughout the ship. While electrical service was restored within two minutes, the ship had a series of smaller electrical failures that bedeviled her for the next 15 minutes. When she resumed firing, Vampire was no longer visible and Shirayuki targeted Thanet instead at a range of , firing 82 rounds at her. Yugiri opened fire at 03:38 at Thanet away and both ships observed their target slowing down at 03:45. At that same time, Yugiri radioed Hashimoto that \\"The enemy is two destroyers\\" so she had spotted Vampire as she fled, although Yugiri lost sight of Vampire 10 minutes later. Sendai, Fubuki, Asagiri, Amagiri, Hatsuyuki and W-1 all subsequently opened fire, mostly at Thanet, although Vampire reported being under fire for a considerable time. All told, the Japanese ships fired 469 rounds at the Allied destroyers, failing to hit Vampire even once. Shirayuki reported that Thanet had sunk at 04:18 and rescued an officer and 30 ratings from the water; another officer and 11 ratings died in the battle. The Japanese did not pursueCannon, pp. 71‚Äì77 and Vampire reached Singapore at 10:00 that morning. Aftermath Shirayuki handed over the rescued seamen to troops on Endau the following day. They were never seen again, but are believed to have been executed in retaliation for losses sustained by the Japanese in an ambush by the Australian 2/18th Battalion, which occurred south of Mersing about the same time as the naval action off Endau. Davies, four other officers, and 61 ratings from Thanet managed to reach shore and made their way to Singapore, together with shot down aircrew.Shores, Cull and Izawa 1993, pp. 39‚Äì42 The Japanese were able to finish landing their troops, which may have contributed to the impression of significant forces in front of the Australian defenders and their subsequent withdrawal. The heavy losses suffered by the Allied aircraft and aircrew virtually eliminated their ability to influence the subsequent ground battles.Wigmore, p. 266 Moran's report on Japanese incompetence at night fighting was the most important result of the battle. Since few details about the subsequent night combats off Java survived, Moran's assessment influenced Allied thinking about the IJN until the stunning victory during the nighttime Battle of Savo Island in August flipped the Allied beliefs about the Japanese ability at night fighting on their heads.Cannon, p. 79 NotesBibliography   * * Category:Conflicts in 1942 Category:1942 in British Malaya Battle off Endau Category:Naval aviation operations and battles B Category:Naval battles of World War II involving Australia Category:Naval battles of World War II involving Japan Category:January 1942 events ","title":"Battle off Endau"},{"id":"25808096","text":"The Nokia 5230 (also known as the Nokia 5230 Nuron) is a smartphone manufactured by Nokia, running Symbian OS v9.4, S60 5th Edition.

John Mackay was born in Boston and he participated in the Mackay family business of shipping started by his father and uncle. He partnered with and financed Alpheus Babcock and Jonas Chickering in early piano manufacturing by using some of his legacy from his wealthy uncle Mungo Mackay. Early life John Mackay was the son of the Scottish immigrant Alexander Mackay (1747‚Äì1801) and his Boston born wife Ruth Decoster(1742‚Äì1833). John Mackay learned the shipping trades as a young man from his father and his uncle Mungo Mackay. John Mackay became a member of the Boston Marine Society on February 3, 1796.Baker, William A. A History of the Boston Marine Society 1742-1967. Boston. Boston Marine Society. Page 338. During this early period he sailed ships to foreign ports to obtain cargo for the Boston market. He was aided by the trade contacts his uncle Mungo Mackay had built up, and by some of the sons of Mungo Mackay who were located on islands in the Caribbean as agents. He also had an aunt and several cousins in London. In November 1798 the Massachusetts Mercury newspaper carried an announcement of the eminent sailing for London of the new ship Galen with John Mackay as Master. John Mackay was described as an \\"old experienced Master\\".Massachusetts Mercury John Mackay's father died in 1801, when John was 27. He assumed the responsibility for his father's business and the care of his mother and sister Jennet. There is a scant record of a brother Mungo, but no birth or death record has been found. Marriage and children John Mackay married Mungo Mackay's youngest daughter Fanny (1785-1870) in January 1807. They were first cousins. Fanny lived with her mother and father on Cambridge Street in the developing West End of Boston. John lived in his parents' house on Federal Street, and the couple moved to a home on Hancock Street in the West End. John Mackay and his partner Thomas Prince had a store at 66 State Street, near Faneuil Hall. Their first child was Frances, born in 1807, who died in 1858. Their second child was Caroline, born in 1810, who died in 1888. Their third and final child was William Harvey, born in 1817, and who died in 1850, all in Boston. With the death of John Mackay's uncle Mungo Mackay in 1811, John Mackay became the executor of his estate, sharing duties with Samuel Parkman and Mungo's widow Ruth. It was a large and complex estate and it took many years to settle all the details. His mother in law, Ruth Coney Mackay, died in 1820, adding to his estate and legacies. Mackay Piano Manufacturing During Mungo Mackay and Alexander Mackay's lifetimes a shipping and privateering fortune was accumulated by both families. John Mackay's father Alexander died in December 1801. He left his wife Ruth DeCoster a considerable estate. When Mungo Mackay's widow Ruth Coney died in 1820 at age 77 in the mansion house on Cambridge Street in Boston's West End she left, in addition to her daughter Fanny, a son Samuel who lived in the Barbados, a son Joseph who lived with her and no other direct male descendants other than the members of the family of Samuel Hunt who had married her daughter Ruth and had 12 children. These two wealthy widows named Ruth Mackay have confused historians to this day as to who was who. Without businessmen in their families other than John Mackay, they relied on him to invest their money, which was comingled in some ventures. The family apparently invited one young relative to come from London to learn American business. This was George Mackay Dowling (1792‚Äì1824), son of Mungo Mackay's sister Nicolap and her husband George Dowling. George Mackay Dowling is listed as a Member of the Boston Sea Fencibles in the August 1814 Signal Roll.New England Historic Genealogical Society To be a member he had to be over the age of 21, and served as first mate or supercargo on a foreign voyage. As an accommodation to his family in America he modified his name to George Dowling Mackay or G. D. Mackay. He lived with Ruth Coney Mackay on Cambridge Street near Parkman's Market. In 1815, the firm known as \\"Boston Musical Instrument Manufactory\\" was opened at 6 Milk Street by the Hayt brothers, Babcock and Appleton.Grafing, K.G. Alpheus Babcock American Pianoforte Maker (1785-1842), his life, instruments and patents. Dissertation. University of Missouri at Kansas City. 1972 In October 1815 merchant John Mackay and his partner Thomas J. Prince took in William M. Goodrich, formerly of the Boston Musical Instrument firm, as a third partner, and they started manufacturing church organs.Buckingham, J. T. William Goodrich, Organ Builder. Boston. New England Magazine. January 1834 Over the next five years they made at least 12 instruments for South Carolina, North Carolina, Rhode Island and Massachusetts churches including Mr. Young's Church Green on Summer Street in Boston, and one for the Handel and Haydn Society.Perkins, Charles. History of the Handel and Haydn Society (1815). Boston. Alfred Mudge and Son. 1883 John Mackay had been an original member of the Society. He loaned the Society the organ, intending to sell it and replace it if necessary. This was his way of advertising the company and its products. In 1818 Jonas Chickering became a member of the Handel and Haydn Society, the same year they performed Handel's Messiah for the first time in Boston.Perkins Members of the Mackay and Hunt families were also members. By 1820 the Mackay family, including G. D. Mackay, Ruth Mackay, John Mackay, and perhaps others, were manufacturing pianos with Alpheus Babcock. The location was Parkman's Market, in the West End, near Mungo Mackay's mansion house. Boston newspapers carried an announcement of the loss of Master Mariner G. D. Mackay in the editions of December 16, 1824. At the time of his death he was the Master of the schooner Hayti.Boston papers citation G. D. Mackay's will, which had been written in 1823, and probated in 1825, inventoried many items of interest to piano manufacturing in the United States.State of Massachusetts, County of Suffolk, Probate Roll 54, Estate 27461 John Mackay was the executor of G. D. Mackay's estate. Thomas Dawes, Junior, Alpheus Babcock and Thomas Appleton were the appraisers. Of the several completed instruments in the factory at the time of G. D. Mackay's death several were sold to people in the Boston area including Harrison Gray Otis. Ruth Mackay of Weston, the widow of Alexander Mackay received about $9000 in repayment of loans she had made to the firm. Ruth Mackay died on April 10, 1833, age 90, having lived the latter part of her life in Weston Massachusetts. John Mackay partnered with Jonas Chickering in a piano manufacturing enterprise in Boston, starting in 1830. In 1837 the firm built a modern factory on Washington Street in Boston. John Mackay was one of the subscribers to the Boston Athenaeum in 1840.Boston Athenaeum He was also a longtime member of the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association. That organization claimed to have had portraits of John Mackay and his son William in their collection.Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association Death and legacy John Mackay died at sea in 1841 while on a voyage to South America, apparently to procure wood for his piano cases that he was manufacturing with Jonas Chickering. His will left his considerable fortune to his daughter Caroline. The relationship of the Mackay family with Jonas Chickering continued, with other members taking some part in the operation of the business until Chickering's death in 1853. From 1841 until 1853 Chickering gradually bought out the remaining members of the Mackay family, although a devastating fire in 1852 cost all partners a large sum of money.

The main characters in the books discover they have special powers in the Dream World and must use them to fight off enemies and protect loved ones. The central story revolves around five cousins we are recruited by their uncle to fend off a coming attack and how they discover their powers and learn to work together. The series is designed to entertain along with improving the reader's vocabulary. Premise The books revolve around Haley, Jack, Braden, Jillian, and Gabby, five cousins who are asked to join the legendary Dream Fighters, of which all their parents were members as children. They each have a special power. Haley can float through the air, Jack can run at super speeds, Braden moves things with his mind, Jillian brings anything she wants into the Dream World, and Gabby has to power to charm. They must train to perfect these powers as well as discover other ones. Over the course of the series, the children develop more and more powers, and fight off several different types of enemies. Book One: Discovery! tells the story of how they discover their powers and their first battle with the evil Gorgons. Books There are six proposed books in the series, coordinated into two trilogies. The Sarlak Trilogy The first three books in the Dream Fighter Chronicle series deal with Sarlak, an evil leader trying to take over the galaxy. In his latest effort, he has taken control of the Gorgons, a race of 7 ft tall warriors. The Dream Fighters must train to fight Sarlak and the Gorgons, all while trying to free the Gorgons from Sarlak's grasp. They will need help from many different sources and learn that the best way to victory is through joining together and trusting each other. =Book One: Discovery!= Released 10/2009 Five cousins thought they were just spending another day at their grandmother's house. Instead, they all fall asleep, then wake up in a dream world. They don't realize this at first, not until strange things start to happen. Haley leaps through the air to catch something. Braden is able to move a game controller with his mind. And Jillian uses her power, and thinks of her favorite doll and her Uncle Johnny at the same time. She makes both of them appear at the same time, sort of. Now, their only guide through the Dream World is Uncle Johnny, trapped in Baby-Wets-A-lot, something the children find very amusing. They discover their powers and then must fight off a Gorgon invasion. The first book introduces the characters and offers many funny moments as Uncle Johnny discovers just what Baby-Wets-A-lot's 'talents' are. The children also practice their powers and face this Gorgon invasion together, learning a lot about teamwork and their own inner abilities. The story ends with them going to the Dream Fighter Academy, where they will continue their training and become real Dream Fighters. =Book Two: Sarlak's Revenge= Released 1/2011 The Dream Fighters, after fighting off the Gorgon attack, have now been training at the academy for six months. They have bettered their powers and understand more about the Dream World. New characters are introduced. They are taught by their long-lost cousin, Danny, who is one of the head teachers at the academy. They also learn a new game, Speedball, which helps them practice their powers and learn battle strategy. Sarlak will not rest, and they must prepare for the predicted final battle against the Gorgons. The book starts off with each Dream Fighter (except one) having a vision of the future where they see their cousins fighting a huge battle, but can do nothing to help. The leader of the academy, Kal, thinks this is caused by fear and must be controlled. Jillian has a deeper vision: the loss of Uncle Johnny in battle. The kids must do their best to control their fear as they prepare for what's in store. Book 2 involves much betrayal, as the fighters realize one of their own has joined Sarlak, and the identity of Sarlak himself is revealed. The academy is attacked and several key characters are lost or must retreat away from the battle. Sarlak exacts his revenge, and things do not look good for the Dream Fighters. =Book 3: United We Stand= Braden, Jillian, and Gabby were forced to retreat to a safe area to train and learn new powers so they can return to defeat the Gorgons. Danny is locked in a one on one battle he cannot win with Sarlak. Uncle Johnny is out of commission, no longer able to help. New friends will come forward and a face from the past returns to save the day, but in the end, it is the Dream Fighters who must figure out how to free the Gorgons and defeat Sarlak once and for all. The Zyrvie Trilogy The Zyrvie Trilogy tells the story of the new academy, new leaders, and a slew of new Dream Fighters. It brings in stories old and new in the Dream Fighter Universe, and ends with a final battle against the Zyrvie Fleet, which comes for revenge from battles long past. =Book 4: The Nowhere Kids= A new academy has been built where the old one stood. After the defeat of Sarlak and the release of the Gorgons, it is supposed to be a time of peace for the Dream Fighters. Six months have passed and it has been a bittersweet quiet. With Kal and Uncle Johnny both gone from the academy, it is up to Danny to lead, with the help of A.L.L.I. (The Academy Library Learning Intelligence) Together they train the Dream Fighters. All seems to be going well, though Danny struggles with leading, something he thinks he might be too young for. And Jillian has a chilling vision. She sees the destruction of a bridge by a terrible force and is told she must prevent it from happening. She doesn't know where to begin. Haley trains at another facility as a Shadow Knight, people who must save the lives of others who are destined for great things. Jack and Braden still train at the academy, with Jack taking trips here and there to practice flying Gorgon Warbirds. Gabby does not train, as Danny tries to protect her after having to fight against the Gorgons at such a young age. Braden and Jack learn of a large group of Dream Fighters who have disappeared over the years, known as The Nowhere Kids. One of them, Xavier, has the ability to strip an enemy's powers, something he did years before in the first Zyrvie War. Little do the Dream Fighters know that the Nowhere Kids are closer than they think, and that they have something planned for them. =Book 5: Hearts Burst Into Fire= Coming off a difficult battle with Xavier and the Nowhere Kids, the Dream Fighters now must prepare for a coming invasion. The Zyrvie Battle Brain, defeated decades ago, has been reactivated and has sent this once peaceful and forgotten race into a war frenzy. Danny gets a mysterious message to meet with an ambassador who promises to stop the invasion before it happens. He brings Braden and Jillian along. Once there, they realize they have been set up and Danny must make a horrible decision: he can only save Braden OR Jillian, not both. He makes his hard choice and Braden is left in the hands of an old enemy. Jillian becomes obsessed with revenge and trains harder, improving her skills and embarking on a quest to rescue her brother's dream essence so that he can be restored. This quest will take her deep into the Outlands where she will meet a familiar Dream Fighter with a grand plan to change the Dream World. Jack trains with the Gorgons, flying their ships. When the invasion seems certain, he asks the Gorgon leader to help by sending his fleet to protect the academy. Lord D'Raygon refuses, not wanting war so soon after finally finding peace. Jack must then take matters into his own hands. Two Dream Fighters have been captured in the real world by the mysterious Dr. Z. His warning is simple: The Dream Fighters must not defend themselves against the Zyrvie attack. If they do, those they love in the real world will suffer. All of the Dream Fighters have been exposed and they must now prepare for battle both in the Dream and real worlds. Jillian and Jack will join forces to defeat the might Zyrvie fleet and in the end, Jillian will be given two tremendous choices that will affect the very fabric of the Dream World. The power to shape the future will be in her hands. =Book Six: The Heroes Among Us= Braden's dream essence is lost. Uncle Johnny has surrendered to the Zyrvies to end the conflict. The academy is once again about to be destroyed. The Dream Fighters have done something they have never done before: they've lost. No one sees a chance to fend off the destruction of the academy. The one thing they always clung to, even in the worst of times, was hope. It's all but gone now. Or is it? Jack races toward the academy in his warbird, trusted Gorgon co-pilot next to him. Danny evacuates the academy, making sure every recruit is gone before the Zyrvie fleet arrives. While doing so, he comes across a holocube left by Uncle Johnny. All is not as it seems, Danny discovers, and a plot to save the Dream Fighters can be hatched, if the timing is right. Meanwhile, Dylan and the Zyrvies have figured out how to cross over into the real world, and the first o0f a wave of attacks strikes close to Gabby's home. Immediately, several men appear at her mother's door, whisking her and Timmy into safety, telling her Uncle Johnny sent them. These people have been hiding in plain sight, waiting for the time to carry out their mission. That mission: Protect the Dream Fighters in the real world at all costs. Jillian searches the Outlands for her brother, Braden, trapped in a game with himself and unable to get free. Once she finds him, she will hunt down Dylan with her newfound powers and destroy him once and for all. So long as the anger within her does not lead to her own destruction first. The conclusion to The Zyrvie Trilogy contains plenty of surprises as the Dream Fighters, now spread far apart from each other, attempt to come together once more in a final battle to save all beloved to them.

His breakthrough achievement was development of the electrodes for underwater welding in 1932. Their successful test at the Black Sea in the same year was the first practical realization of underwater welding.The Rise of the Soviet Navy In this method, the gas bubbles formed as a result of welding reactions were generating a stable flow which shielded the arc from water., same in Electricity and Gas Used in Under-Water Cutting, (1945) Science news, Vol. 47‚Äì48, p. 152 Underwater welding had quickly found practical application and already in 1936‚Äì1938 was used in the lifting of the ship Boris sunk in the Black Sea, as well as in the repair of bridges and other ships, especially during World War II.–ü–æ–¥–≤–æ–¥–Ω–∞—è —Å–≤–∞—Ä–∫–∞ –∏ —Ä–µ–∑–∫–∞ (Underwater welding and cutting (in Russian)John Turkevich Soviet men of science: academicians and corresponding members of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, Van Nostrand, 1963, p. 160 Awards For his pioneering work in underwater welding, Khrenov was awarded the State Stalin Prize in 1946.

Population in 2011 was 245. Acreage 1053.Normanton on the Wolds Appraisal Plan Overview The name \\"Normanton\\" (Norwegian's village ‚Äì Place Names of Nottinghamshire, Gover, Mawer and Stenton (intro pxx)) is attributed to several settlements in Midlands of England. The \\"on the Wolds\\" distinguishes it and places it firmly in the Nottinghamshire Wolds Character Area.Normanton- on-the-Wolds Appraisal and Management Plan, Rushcliffe Borough Council Normanton on the Wolds is a small village six miles (10 km) south east of Nottingham very close to the village of Plumtree with which it has been associated, ecclesiastically and civilly, throughout its history. Its main street was once the main road route from Nottingham to Melton Mowbray but was bypassed in 1930 with the turnpike of the A606 which now passes just to the south of the village. The housing off Clipston Road and The Leys to the north of the village is only accessible, by vehicle, by driving onto, and shortly thereafter off the busy A606. This seclusion within a very short distance of a major road, along with the presence of many houses set in their own grounds, protected by red brick walls and mature trees and hedgerows, along the length of the village makes the south end of the village a particularly attractive place. Although the village is essentially constructed along the old Melton Road it has a Back Lane. The village consists of more exclusive homes including substantial manor houses, converted cottages and farm houses with many a large garden and long driveway. Normanton on the Wolds was designated one of ten local conservation areas by Rushcliffe Borough Council in 1990 and extended in 2009. This small village contains many historic buildings, no less than four are listed. Normanton on the Wolds presently has 7 Parish Councillors. Facilities The Plough, Normanton on the Wolds The Plough, Normanton on the Wolds Llamas There is no school or church in this small village but the Parish church of Plumtree, dedicated to St Mary the Virgin, is very close in the nearby village of Plumtree. This ancient church, the parish church also serving Normanton and Clipston, is believed to be one of the oldest churches in Nottinghamshire.St. Mary the Virgin, Plumtree ‚Äì University of Nottingham Plumtree Methodists built a chapel in the village in 1797 (which was enlarged in 1827) but is now a private dwelling. There are no shops, nor any other modern facility in Normanton, the inhabitants relying on mobility to reach nearby Tollerton, Keyworth, Cotgrave or other sources for their supplies. There are, however, businesses such as the working Avenue Farm providing stabling. Also the Ives family's Rushcliffe Breeders farm to the north of the village keeps a small, but conspicuous, Llama herd.British Llama Breeders, British Llama Society) alt= Spring on Hoe Hill from Normanton One of the better known buildings in the village is the Plough Inn; a substantial ivy clad country road inn with extensive gardens. This deservedly popular pub offers good cuisine and is very hospitable. Regular bus services between Nottingham and Melton Mowbray detour off the A606 to pass along Old Melton Road through the village To the east of the village a pretty stream, straggled by timber footbridges, flows from the south and east off the Wolds toward the Trent. The land here is mainly agricultural and Green Belt designated. To the north and east towards nearby Tollerton, Clipston and Cotgrave is farmland which includes crop land as well as grazing for sheep and horses. The large woods less than a mile directly east are a plantation. There are extensive and well marked public footpaths in the area affording, especially on the well used path over the Wold edge to Clipston and Cotgrave, impressive views over a large area of the city of Nottingham to the North West. North of the village is the distinctive, partially wooded, Hoe Hill, which is visible for miles around and forms one of the most westerly outcrops of the Wold's northernmost Trent Valley edge. History * c1066 Before the Norman conquest of England, the manor associated with the village that would become Normanton was held by Unfac. Saxon burials have been found off the nearby A46 originally the Fosse Way Roman Road. * 1086 Following the Norman conquest, the Norman baron Roger de Busli (c.1038 ‚Äì c.1099) was granted what became Normanton on the Wolds and also the nearby Normanton on Soar and Normanton on Trent. De Busli is recorded in the Domesday Book as holding these lands, but he died without an heir, his son having died in infancy. * 1099 De Busli's lands were given to Robert de Belleme, who lost them in 1102 after leading a rebellion against Henry I. * 1154 ‚Äì Seventeen acres of arable land given by Simon of Keyworth to Haveholme Priory of Lincolnshire. Thereafter this land passed into the hands of the Crusading Hospitaliers (Knoights of Malta). * 1201 ‚Äì \\"a royal charter decreed that land was confirmed by King John to Geoffrey Luteral (Loteral) 'the gift to him by Gerbode de Escaud of fifteen burates of land in Gamston and Normanton-on-the-Wolds'.\\" * 1530 Dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VII led to the lands becoming crown property. * 1548 Lands bought by Thomas Brende. The area farmed by tenants. * 1553 Lands bought by John, Earl of Bedford and Edmund Downing. The ownership of the land then changes often over the next two centuries. * 1790 Enclosure of the village. \\"to the great loss of the church of Plumtree, to which it is parish.\\" (Thoroton, 1790). At this time there are 20 recorded dwellings in the village and around of land. By the 1830s the village had grown to 33 dwellings. * 1848 recorded as a township, in the parish of Plumtree, union of Bingham, N. division of the wapentake of Rushcliffe, S. division of the county of Nottingham, 6 miles (S. E. by S.) from Nottingham; containing 230 inhabitants. The tithes have been commuted for ¬£225. 15. 6.\\" (A Topographical Dictionary of England ‚Äì Editor Samuel Lewis, 1848.) The population of the village varies greatly according to censuses records: The 1891 census1891 Census, Normanton-on-the-Wolds cites a population at that time of 206. The occupations of the heads of families vary from \\"own means\\" to \\"servant\\" and \\"domestic\\". There are many farm related occupations such as \\"agi labourer\\" maybe serving Wolds Littlewood Farm. Many road and place names such as Normanton Lane, Chapel Yard and Hawker's Yard have disappeared. There are three railway related professions included: signalman, railway porter and station master. The latter, the family Harvey, numbered eight and lived in the Railway Station. The station, closed to passengers as early as 1949Plumtree railway station served the Nottingham Melton line (closed in 1968). The station house is slightly nearer to the centre of Plumtree than it is to Normanton. In 1910, nine trains each way stopped at Plumtree Station. Earliest train to Nottingham was 7.02, to Melton Mowbray 6.55. A passenger catching this latter could expect to be in London St Pancras by 10.55 am. Sunday services were virtually non ‚Äìexistent, with only the morning milk train (7.49) to Nottingham (and no way getting back that day!). [Keyworth and Plumtree on old picture postcards Brian Lund] The 1901 census1901 Census, Normanton-on-the-Wolds shows little change, still a very agriculturally orientated but includes a \\"cottager milksitter\\" in the listed occupations as well as a dentist. The village had always been centred on the farming in the area of both crops and livestock. Surrounding land shows much evidence of ridge and furrow farming prevalent throughout the Middle Ages and the recurring use of the term \\"platt\\" (plot) in the area in early records points to tenanted division of the land. There are also signs of a water mill complex by the stream.

It was entered into the 10th Berlin International Film Festival. It is an adaptation of the 1842 French play Le Verre d'eau by Eug√®ne Scribe and is set in London in 1710 during the War of the Spanish Succession. It was shot at the Wandsbek Studios in Hamburg. The film's sets were designed by the art director Albrecht Becker and Herbert Kirchhoff. Plot Still young and inexperienced, Anne, Queen of Great Britain is a weak puppet-queen under the influence of Sarah Churchill, whose intrigues are an attempt to paint her warlike husband the Duke of Marlborough in a better light. However, Henry St. John, a noble journalist and leader of the opposition, is also trying to influence the queen - he wants to end the war with France as soon as possible and by any means necessary. Sarah is not averse to romantic adventures and so becomes the patron of the young country lord Arthur Masham, unceremoniously making him an ensign in the queen's guards. However, Henry St. John sees through the plan, knowing that Masham is engaged to Abigail, a jealous shop assistant in a jewellery store, who he wants to win for himself. Masham kills a very rich cousin of Henry in a duel. Henry thus inherits a huge fortune and the title Lord Bolingbroke. He wins the next round of intrigues, getting a position in the queen's court for Abigail and thus gaining influence there for himself. Via Abigail he learns that the queen has her eye on Masham without him being aware of it. As a signal for a planned rendezvous, she wants to pass him a glass of water during a ball. Henry thus explains to Sarah that she has a rival, but does not name names. However, at the queen's next ball she vies with the queen for Masham's favour and then panics, meaning both she and Masham have to resign their roles as the queen's confidantes. Even so, the tide seems to be turning in Sarah's favour when she and a few other ladies surprise the queen during a night-time meeting with Masham. However, Henry is ready - he arrives immediately and saves the queen with a white lie. He thus becomes her sole advisor and Sarah's fate is sealed - she is banished from court and Marlborough is dismissed - leaving Henry as prime minister at the head of a new cabinet, whose first task will be to resume peace negotiations with France.

After Octavian had succeeded in capturing the Egyptian Queen Cleopatra VII in her Mausoleum in Alexandria she was strictly guarded by Epaphroditus and some other guardians under his command, first in her Mausoleum, then in the palace (early August 30 BC).Plutarch, Life of Antony 79.6; Cassius Dio, Roman History 51.11.4-5 (according to this author Epaphroditus also participated in the capture of Cleopatra) Because Octavian allegedly wanted to present Cleopatra in his triumphal procession in Rome he instructed Epaphroditus to prevent Cleopatra from killing herself. But the Queen was able to feign her will to live so that Epaphroditus observed her less strictly. Then she gave him an urgent sealed letter that he should deliver personally to Octavian and while he was absent she succeeded in committing suicide.Cassius Dio, Roman History 51.13.3-5; compare Plutarch, Life of Antony 85.4-6 Some modern historians do not believe this ancient tradition, but assume that Octavian had no interest that Cleopatra survived. Because the Emperor knew that she rather wanted to die than to be presented in a triumph he ordered Epaphroditus ‚Äì according to this theory ‚Äì to control Cleopatra only apparently, so that she could easily commit suicide. Later he pretended to be angry that Cleopatra had been able to kill herself.This theory is supported for example by Michael Grant, Cleopatra, p. 310-311  Notes  References  * Michael Grant, Cleopatra 1972 and 1974, German edition 1998, p. 309 and 311.

Besides creating photographs for the promotion of a film, the still photographer contributes daily to the filming process by creating set stills. With these, the photographer is careful to record all details of cast wardrobe, set appearance and background. Cornel Lucas, a pioneer of film portraiture in the 1940s and 1950s, was the first still photographer to be awarded a BAFTA, in 1998, for work with the British Film Industry.  Uses in the industry  Using individual frames from film or recorded video material is not practical due to their relatively low quality. Much higher resolution images are therefore used. Typically, the end uses of these still photos include the film's theatrical release poster, DVD box artwork, the official web site photos, billboards, bus stop adverts, point-of-purchase displays, key art image sets released to the press and media, and other printed and online collateral materials. Unit still photographers are also responsible for creating \\"photo props\\" and \\"set dressing images\\", the photos and images used on-camera to create various illusions such as forensic photos, crime drama booking photos, character driver's licenses, passport and I.D. photos, on-screen family photos, surveillance photos, computer screen displays, and any other image a producer may require in the course of a production. In North America in particular, and some international locations, a unit still photographer must be a member of IATSE Local 600 International Cinematographers Guild in order to perform services on union productions and union studio lots and locations. The most prestigious of these unit still photographers are members of The Society of Motion Picture Still Photographers, an organization which promotes the work of those within the industry. In the past, the director, costumer or the director of photography may have referred to these still images for continuity purposes as the unit stills photographer was the only crew member permitted to take still photographs on set, but with the introduction of instant cameras such as the Polaroid, and subsequent digital photo cameras, this job of taking continuity images has fallen to the continuity and script supervisor. While often perceived as a \\"glamour\\" job for photographers, the reality is often long hours (70-plus hours per week) on remote locations under difficult and often extreme conditions. The unit still photographer often coordinates with the unit publicist, but physically works in close proximity to the film's camera crew, director and actors, and also in close proximity to the film's boom microphone operator. Unit still photographers go to great lengths to muffle the sound of their camera's motor drive and shutter to avoid distracting the actors, and to remain inaudible on the film's recorded dialogue soundtrack. Typically, this is accomplished using a sound blimp, which is a sound-absorbing, foam-filled metal case in which the still camera body is fitted with a proprietary remote operation cable. This allows the camera to be activated and operated from a two-button (activation, focus and shutter release) exterior control. Limitations exist once the blimp is closed around the camera, as one can no longer access the cameras controls (f-number, shutter speed, ASA/ISO settings) or menu displays directly. The LCD display for reviewing the images will also be obscured in the closed position. This requires the photographer to make control selections in advance, and use with those settings until the take in progress has been \\"cut\\", making adjustments only between takes or set-ups. Unit still photographers in this field typically produce over 2000 marketable images per week for their major-studio clients. Since 2010, high-end DSLR cameras, which can be remotely controlled with mobile apps on smartphones and tablet computers, using the built-in 2-way Wi-Fi radio-controlled interface between the tablet and the DSLR camera, and offer internal active noise reduction technologies, have increased the ability of the unit still photographer to work quietly on the set.

Rijksmuseum Hendrik (Hendrikus) van de Sande Bakhuyzen (2 January 1795, The Hague ‚Äì 12 December 1860, The Hague) was a 19th-century Dutch landscape painter and art teacher. He was a prominent contributor to the Romantic period in Dutch art and his students and children founded the art movement known as the Hague School. Like his contemporaries Edward Williams, Jacob Maris, and Jozef Israels, he was part of a family of prominent painters, including son Julius van de Sande Bakhuyzen, daughter Gerardina Jacoba van de Sande Bakhuyzen, and nephew Alexander Hieronymus Bakhuyzen. Personal life He was born under the name Hendrikus Bakhuyzen in the Hague in 1795, the son of prominent publisher Gerrit Bakhuysen (1758‚Äì1843) and Jacoba van de Sande (1757‚Äì1815). In 1819 he obtained a Royal Decree granting legal permission to add his late mother's surname to his own and became known as Hendrikus van de Sande Bakhuyzen. His wife was Sophia Wilhelmine Kiehl (1804‚Äì1881). He lived principally in The Hague in the Netherlands. He died on December 12, 1860. His son, Julius van de Sande Bakhuyzen (1835‚Äì1925), became a well-known landscape painter as well. His daughter, Gerardine Jacoba van de Sande Bakhuyzen (1826‚Äì1895), was a painter of still life, flowers, and fruit. His son Henricus Gerardus van de Sande Bakhuyzen (1838‚Äì1923) became a prominent astronomer, member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, and director of the Leiden Observatory. His son Ernest-Frederich van de Sande Bakhuyzen was also an astronomer at the Leiden Observatory. Career Gelders landscape Ruin on a Mountain. 1810‚Äì1860 Winter landscape Hendrik v.d.S. Bakhuyzen learned drawing and painting first from Jan Willem Pieneman and his pupil J. Heymans and then later from Simon Andreas Krausz at the Hague Academy, recently endowed by Willem I. His fellow students included Andreas Schelfhout and Bart van Hove, each of them significant for the development of the Hague School.Marius p. 60De Leeuw et al. p.38 He was successful while still quite young, with his painting Gelders landschap acquired by the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam in 1818. In 1821 he received a medal of honor from the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Fine Arts at an exhibit in Brussels, followed in 1822 by a medal and 300 guilder prize from the Society of Encouragement of Fine Arts in Antwerp. In the same year he became a member of the Royal Academy of Arts in Amsterdam and a board member of the Art Academy in The Hague. He was later elected Director of the Hague Academy. He traveled to paint in Belgium in 1824 and in Germany in 1834.Sande Bakhuyzen, Hendrikus van de at the Netherlands Institute for Art History, retrieved 13 July 2014 In 1840 he became one of the early members of the Arti et Amicitiae artists society in Amsterdam. In 1841 he traveled along the Rhine river in Germany with his pupil Willem Roelofs. He also painted landscape scenes from Noorden and the area around Oosterbeek, an artists' colony that later became known as the Dutch Barbizon. He was an active teacher and continued to take in pupils until shortly before he died. Some of these pupils, notably Ter Meulen became pupils of Hendrikus' son Julius upon his death. Even after his death, Hendrik's work continued to be displayed prominently in the family studio where his artist son and daughter painted. Art Shepherd and shepherdess with cattle in mountain landscape by H. van de Sande Bakhuyzen He is known for his Romantic pastoral scenes (especially paintings of livestock) with detailed landscapes, notably inspired by Golden Age artist Paulus Potter and continuing the Realist tradition of that era. He emphasized drawing as essential to truthful painting, quoting the motto le dessin est the probite de l'art (drawing is the integrity of art) after French painter Ingres. He required his students to learn to sketch natural scenes in great detail before permitting them to hold a brush. This emphasis on work en plein air presaged the landscape work of Hague School artists. He has been described as \\"an honest landscape painter\\" whose scenes are \\"entirely free from mannerism and artificiality\\". His works often emphasized animals on the landscape, driven in part by their commercial success. His son Julius later relayed the story of one of Hendrik's paintings of a landscape near Oosterbeek that featured what was to his father an ordinary brown horse but which so caught the fancy of his customer's neighbors in Philadelphia that Hendrik received at least ten orders for similar pictures with that particular horse, as if the horse itself were somehow special. Most of van de Sande Bakhuyzen's work was summer landscapes, but he also painted a small number of winter scenes, often of quintessentially Dutch scenes including windmills, ice skaters, and cottages built in traditional Dutch architectural style. In this vein his work closely resembled that of Andreas Schelfhout (1787‚Äì1870), a close friend who was famous for his winter landscapes and with whom v.d.S. Bakhuyzen collaborated, including at least one joint canvas that bears both artists' signatures. His work is displayed in the Rijksmuseum, the British National Trust, Teylers Museum in Haarlem, Museum Fodor, Museum of Fine Arts Bern, and the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, among others. Influence Hendrik v.d.S. Bakhuyzen was profoundly influential in 19th Century Dutch art, both through his own landscapes and through his students. His students helped to establish the Dutch art movement the Hague School.  Influence on The Hague School  The Hague School of artists sought to transition from the romantic realism of the preceding generation to a new style that emphasized mood and movement. For instance, Gerard Bilders wrote to Johannes Kneppelhout that \\"It is not my aim and object to paint a cow for the cow's sake or a tree for the tree's, but by means of the whole to reproduce an impression which nature sometimes gives.\\" The painters of the Hague School used muted tones and more diffuse brushstrokes to add a sense of weather and often somber moods to their landscapes and genre scenes.  Interactions with the Van Gogh Family  The van de Sande Bakhuyzens were related to the famed Van Gogh family through Hendrik's grandfather Hendrik Bakhuyzen, who married Jannetje van Gogh (1731‚Äì1796). Hendrik taught Vincent van Gogh's mother Anna Carbentus van Gogh to paint, and Vincent van Gogh felt that there was clear thematic convergence among his work and that of the van de Sande Bakhuyzen's. In his Dec. 23, 1889 letter to his mother from the San Remy-de-Provence asylum he wrote: In his letters, Vincent van Gogh notes that the sketches he observed by Pieter ter Meulen in 1881 were much better than when he had observed Ter Meulen \\"struggling and swotting\\" in Bakhuyzen's studio.  Family Recognition  In 1996 the Bakhuyzen family was entered in the Nederland's Patriciaat or Blue Book, recognizing families who have been leading members of society for 150 years and six generations.

It is credited with boosting the careers of its leads, Barbara La Marr and Ramon Novarro. It has been described as Ingram's most personal film. The film is considered lost. Plot Leon de Severac is fed up with his daughter Jacqueline, who is constantly seducing men. Hoping to discourage her from her flirtatious behavior, he tells her the story of Zareda, an attractive fortune teller who is having an affair with Ivan de Maupin. Ivan's father, the Baron, lusts after her as well and Ivan eventually grows convinced that Zareda is cheating on him. Giving her up, he leaves for war shortly after. A short period later, Zareda finds out the Baron is about to poison Marquis Ferroni. Trying to save the marquis, she switches the wine glasses and the Baron dies instead. The marquis, a powerful millionaire, is very grateful to Zareda and they soon marry. For a short period of time, Zareda is a happy woman, until the return of Ivan. Jealous, Ivan makes sure he is not giving the marquis any rest. It eventually leads to a duel, where the marquis is mortally wounded. As he is about to die, he notices his wife embracing Ivan. Realizing she is using her body to get what she wants, he uses his last seconds alive to kill them both. The movie director, Michael Powell, described the film as: \\"Moonlight on tiger skins and blood dripping onto white faces, while sinister apes, poison and lust kept the plot rolling.\\" Cast *Barbara La Marr as Jacqueline de S√©verac/Zareda *Ram√≥n Novarro as Henri/Ivan de Maupin *Pomeroy Cannon as L√©on de S√©verac *Edward Connelly as Baron Fran√ßois de Maupin *Lewis Stone as The Marquis Ferroni *Hughie Mack as P√®re Alphonse Bidondeau *Eugene Pouyet as Col. Roybet *John George as Achmet *Jess Weldon as Caesar *Bynunsky Hyman as Hassan Production The film is a remake of the 1917 film Black Orchids, also directed by Rex Ingram. Back then, the studio thought the film was too erotic and did not encourage its release. Therefore, Ingram remade the film in 1922, making it \\"twice as erotic\\". Trifling Women starred Barbara La Marr and Ram√≥n Novarro, who were reteamed from The Prisoner of Zenda (1922), a highly successful film which was recently released. The reunion made the audience suspect they were a couple, but it was later revealed that they were no more than close friends. The role La Marr played was specially written for the actress. Shortly before the film's release, Novarro's name, which was Ramon Samaniegos, was changed to 'Novarro'. Reception Trifling Women premiered at the Astor Theatre in New York City on October 2, 1922, and had its general release on November 6. It received mixed reviews. Harrison's Report called it \\"an unquestionable masterpiece\\". On the other hand, the reviewer for Variety felt it was a let-down compared to The Prisoner of Zenda, and the New York Times called it \\"an impossible rigmarole\\". Samuel Goldwyn saw an advance screening of the film and was especially impressed by Novarro. He offered him a contract of $2,000 a week. This would certainly have been a major career step, since his salary for Trifling Women was $125. Novarro refused, however, deciding to remain loyal to Ingram, who gave him his \\"big break\\", according to the actor. When Trifling Women became a worldwide financial success, La Marr's salary was raised to $6,500 a week. She became a worldwide superstar, only surpassed in popularity by Gloria Swanson. Ingram later said that Trifling Women was the best movie he made. Although the film was criticized for not living up to its enormous budget, the director, story and actors' performances were praised. Critic Carlos Clarens wrote of the film that it \\"contained enough poisoning, Satanism, and necrophilia to make it one of the commercial disasters of 1922.\\" Carlos Clarens. Horror Movies: An Illustrated Survey. London: Secker & Warburg, 1968 (expanded/revised ed from the 1967 publication by GP Putnams, New York) p. 72 Preservation Though some production stills survive, Trifling Women is believed to be lost.

Early years Koch was born in Wichita, Kansas. His paternal grandfather, Harry Koch, was a Dutch immigrant, who founded the Quanah Tribune-Chief newspaper and was a founding shareholder of Quanah, Acme & Pacific Railway. Among his maternal great-great- grandparents were William Ingraham Kip, an Episcopal bishop; William Burnet Kinney, a politician; and Elizabeth Clementine Stedman, a writer. Beginning in eighth grade, Koch attended a boarding school called Pembroke-Country Day School in Kansas City, Missouri. He attended high school at Hackley School in Tarrytown, New York. Koch studied humanities at Harvard College and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1955. His father and his three younger brothers, Charles G. Koch and twins David H. Koch and William I. Koch, studied chemical engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and pursued business careers. After college, Koch enlisted in the U.S. Navy, serving in Millington, Tennessee and then on the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga. Upon his return to civilian life, Koch enrolled at the Yale School of Drama, where his focus was playwriting. He received a Master of Fine Arts degree from the school in 1961.  Philanthropy  Through personal and foundation acquisitions, Koch assembled large and important collections of photographs, rare books, literary and musical manuscripts, and fine and decorative arts. Works of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries predominated in his collections. Among his private collections is the archival estate of George Platt Lynes and a vast archive of the works of society photographer Jerome Zerbe. The foundation Koch founded, the Frederick R. Koch Foundation, is a major donor in New York City to the Pierpont Morgan Library and the Frick Collection, and, in Pittsburgh, to the Carnegie Museum of Art. Of particular note are The Frederick R. Koch Collections at the Harvard Theater Collection, Houghton Library at Harvard University, and at Yale University's Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library. Yale president Richard C. Levin described the Koch collection as \\"one of the greatest collections to come to Yale since the year of its founding\\".Statement appears in the Beinecke's collection catalog Since the 1980s, Koch has bought, restored and maintained a number of historic properties in the United States and abroad. These properties include the Donahue house, a Woolworth mansion in Manhattan; the Habsburg hunting lodge near Salzburg, Austria;Architectural Digest, January 1994, article by Brendan Gill. the Romanesque Villa Torre Clementina in Cap Martin, France; and Elm Court, a Tudor Gothic manse in Butler, Pennsylvania. Koch financed the reconstruction of the Royal Shakespeare Company's Swan Theater in England from its 1879 remains, although his role as the project's patron was kept secret for years. In 1990, Koch bought Sutton Place near Guildford, Surrey, England. Sutton Place is the former residence of J. Paul Getty and the meeting place of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. Koch purchased the property from another reclusive art collector, Stanley Seeger. He \\"redecorated the house and hung his art collection, but is said never to have spent a night under its roof before selling it for ¬£32m\\" in 1999. Other sources say he operated it as the Sutton Place Foundation, open to the public for more than 25 years,Country Life Magazine, June 13, 1996 and that he ultimately sold the property in 2005. Koch served for many years on the boards of directors of the Spoleto Festival and The Royal Shakespeare Company. In 2010, The New Yorker reported that Koch had \\"moved to Monaco, which has no income tax\\". Despite lavish philanthropy and millions spent on art acquisitions and property restoration, Koch was said to have a frugal streak. He reportedly \\"prefers taking the public bus in New York and typically flies commercial\\", according to Vanity Fair. Legal battles Frederick Koch and his younger brother Bill had inherited stock in Koch Industries. In June 1983, after a bitter legal and boardroom battle, the stakes of Frederick and Bill were bought out for $1.1 billion and Charles Koch and David Koch became majority owners in the company.\\"Koch's wife granted order of restraint\\". Pittsburg (KS) Morning Sun, July 21, 2000. Legal disputes against Charles and David lasted roughly two decades. Frederick and Bill sided with J. Howard Marshall III, J. Howard Marshall II's eldest son, against Charles and David at one point, in order to take over the company. In 2001, Bill reached a settlement in a lawsuit where he had alleged that the company was taking oil from federal and Indian land; this settlement ended all litigation between the brothers.\\"Judge Clears Koch Brothers' Settlement Pact\\".

The software works without an internet connection and with a cell phone and computer. History The software was originally developed in 2005 by Ken Banks for conservationists to keep in touch with communities in Kruger National Park in South Africa. The 2.0 release is a deep redesign and is the first version to install a browser-based interface to the Java FrontlineSMS backend. Usage FrontlineSMS enables users to connect a range of mobile devices to a computer to send and receive SMS text messages. The software works without an internet connection by connecting a device such as a cell phone or GSM modem with a local phone number. FrontlineSMS can send and receive messages, group contacts, respond to messages, and trigger other events. If internet access is available, FrontlineSMS can be connected to online SMS services and set up to feed incoming messages to other web or e-mail services. FrontlineSMS includes different features which enable messages to be filtered by keyword, or allows the submission of Java based forms with FrontlineSMS Forms. It has been used to monitor national elections in the Philippines, Afghanistan and Nigeria. For example, in April 2007 it was used by the Network of Mobile Election Monitors (NMEM) to oversee the 2007 Nigerian general election. Volunteers with mobile phones sent back reports from election booths to a central hub in an effort to prevent vote rigging. A similar system was deployed to monitor the 2009 Afghan presidential election, where it was combined with the crisis-mapping tool Ushahidi, to plot the reports on an online map. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, FrontlineSMS team members helped establish the 4636 Short Code through other related organizations (Ushahidi, InSTEDD) to allow people on the ground to report emergency information. FrontlineSMS and its sister organizations are also improving the provision of healthcare in developing countries, where bad roads, long distances, and a shortage of healthcare workers make delivering care difficult. FrontlineSMS:Medic uses the FrontlineSMS software to gather health data and assist in patient follow-up. Community health workers use FrontlineSMS:Medic to transmit information about symptoms and follow up with patients much more quickly and efficiently (by sending a text message rather than driving long distances over bad roads). When FrontlineSMS:Medic was first introduced in one area of Malawi, the local hospital doubled the number of tuberculosis patients treated over six months, while saving 2,100 hours in travel and work time and $3,500 in costs. The tool is now being used in 11 countries, mostly in sub Saharan Africa. In June 2010, FrontlineSMS:Medic team released a public beta of PatientView, which allows hospitals to manage patient information in rural settings where there is no Internet access. The FrontlineSMS:Medic team is also working on a monitoring system to capture symptoms across different languages and spellings and detect disease hotspots, and are working with a researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles to develop an addition that would allow remote diagnosis of malaria and some sexually transmitted diseases, including potentially HIV.

Baluschek was a prominent representative of German Critical Realism, and as such he sought to portray the life of the common people with vivid frankness.Hans Baluschek: Im Kampf um meine Kunst, in: Die Gartenlaube Nr. 27, 1920; Seiten 447‚Äì450. His paintings centered on the working class of Berlin. He belonged to the Berlin Secession movement, a group of artists interested in modern developments in art. Yet during his lifetime he was most widely known for his fanciful illustrations of the popular children's book Little Peter's Journey to the Moon (German title: Peterchens Mondfahrt). Hans Baluschek, after 1920, was an active member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, which at the time still professed a Marxist view of history.  Life  Hans Baluschek, 1930 Rain, 1917  Childhood and youth (1870‚Äì1889)  Hans Baluschek was born on 9 May 1870 in Breslau, then Germany's sixth-largest city (now Wroc≈Çaw, Poland), to Franz Baluschek, a surveyor and railroad engineer and his wife.Ein echter Berliner aus Breslau 1870‚Äì1893. In: Br√∂han 2002, S. 14‚Äì24 He had three sisters, two of whom died of tuberculosis in childhood. After the Franco-Prussian War and foundation of the German Empire in 1871, Franz became an independent engineer of railways, and lived for a time in the much smaller town of Haynau (now Chojn√≥w, Poland). It was during his childhood that Hans Baluschek developed a fascination with railroads that later would be shown in his paintings. In 1876 the family, with 6-year-old Hans, moved to Berlin, where during the next decade they changed their residence five times, living in a succession of newly built apartments developed expressly for workers. Berlin found itself in the midst of an economic crisis following the Panic of 1873, but Franz Baluschek was fortunate in maintaining railroad employment and was able to support his family in kleinb√ºrgerlich (petite bourgeois) style amid the family's less affluent proletarian neighbors. Following primary school, Hans Baluschek at age 9 entered the Askanische Gymnasium, a secondary school in the Tempelhof-Sch√∂neberg district of Berlin, which offered curricula in the humanities and natural sciences. During the 1880s, young Baluschek was profoundly impressed by a Berlin exhibition of paintings by Russian artist Vasily Vereshchagin, whose works portrayed the horrors of war, particularly the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì78. These paintings were widely debated in Berlin artistic circles, where their graphic realism came as a shock to some. Baluschek began to copy pictures and to paint his own war scenes in the manner of Vereshchagin, whose influence may be detected in some of Baluschek's later works. In 1887, his father took a job with the railroad on the large German island of R√ºgen, and the family moved to nearby Stralsund, where Baluschek completed his Gymnasium education. In Stralsund he was influenced by instructor Max Sch√ºtte, who taught his students the principles of socialism, particularly emphasizing the relationship of economic and social issues ‚Äî and who was ultimately fired because of his left-wing political views. Baluschek and his classmates devoted themselves to studying the then-popular political works of Tolstoy and Zola. When Baluschek passed his Abitur (school-leaving exam) in 1889 and graduated from the Gymnasium, he stated that he wished to become a painter.  Early years as an artist (1890‚Äì1894)  After graduating, Baluschek was admitted to the Berlin University of the Arts (Universit√§t der K√ºnste), where he became acquainted with the German painter Martin Brandenburg, with whom he was to maintain a lifelong friendship. The university, however, remained quite conservative despite many new trends in the arts, such as the widely popular French Impressionism. Instruction focused on traditional techniques and art history. Baluschek lived in the Sch√∂neberg district of Berlin. His earliest known sketch book dates from 1889 and includes a self-portrait showing him in student dress. Among his early works are military and war scenes, along with portrayals of street life in Stralsund and Berlin. In the 1890s he produced illustrations of class differences and proletarian life in Berlin, in which he finally departed from traditional techniques. Baluschek left the arts university in 1893 and began to work as an independent artist, now focusing almost exclusively on social-class differences ‚Äî which made him an outsider in the conservative arts scene of Wilhelmine Germany. Meanwhile, he was reading the left-leaning works of Gerhart Hauptmann, Tolstoy, Ibsen, Johannes Schlaf und Arno Holz and was heavily influenced by the literature of Naturalism.  Artistic development (1894‚Äì1914)  Big City Train Station, 1904 Hasenheide Amusement Park, 1895 City of Workers, 1920 Here the family can make coffee, 1895 The main period of Bakluschek's artistic development began in 1894 and extended for two decades, until the beginning of World War I in 1914. Baluschek identified with opposition to traditional representative art and forged relationships with artists in the circle dominated by impressionist Max Liebermann (later classified by the Nazis as a practitioner of \\"degenerate art\\"). Baluschek's paintings from this period show life on the outskirts of Berlin, where construction of factories, apartment complexes and railroads was booming. His favorite themes included factories, cemeteries and above all the common working people of Berlin. For example, his 1894 work Noon (Mittag) depicts women with children bringing lunch baskets to their men employed at the factories, and evokes the \\"endless drudgery\\" of working-class life, with its constant repetition of daily tasks.Bilderbuch des sozialen Lebens 1894‚Äì1914. In: Br√∂han 2002, S. 25‚Äì54 With Railwayman's Evening Free (Eisenbahner- Feierabend) in 1895, this theme is represented by an individual worker who returns exhausted from work against a backdrop of railroad installations, smoke stacks and overhead tram wires, and is greeted by anxious children. At the time Baluschek maintained a friendly relationship with the avant-garde poet Richard Dehmel, known for poems such as The Working Man (Der Arbeitmann) and Fourth Class (Vierter Klasse).Richard Dehmel: Der Arbeitmann. In: Weib und Welt, Berlin 1896, S. 123‚Äì125. Baluschek produced a cover illustration for Dehmel's Woman and the World (Weib und Welt), a collection of poems that appeared in 1896. Baluschek developed relationships with several left-leaning writers, among them the poet and playwright Arno Holz, best known for Phantasus (1898), a poetry collection describing the starving artists of the Wedding district of Berlin. Holz was for Baluscheck a key figure of literary naturalism and a spiritual mentor. About this time, Baluschek developed his own painting style, using watercolor and gouache techniques; he seldom painted in oils. The surface was first prepared with oil-chalk pencil, which Baluschek believed was particularly receptive to the gray urban tones of working-class Berlin.nach E√üwein, S. 14, und Br√∂han, S. 30. In the second half of the 1890s Baluschek progressively gained recognition in the Berlin arts scene, especially after exhibitions in 1895, 1896 and 1897 with Martin Brandenburg. Although Baluschek had been shown earlier in small galleries, these were his first exposure to a larger public. While Liebermann and other artists had painted proletarian themes, Baluschek's work now was seen as new and unusual. The Berlin art collector Karl Br√∂han noted that the \\"direct honesty\\" of Baluschek's \\"slices of life\\" were \\"disturbingly provocative.\\" His portrayal of the inhumane living environment and bleak working conditions behind society's often glitzy facade showed, said art critic Willy Pastor, \\"that more was hidden behind the scenes than a cozy story.\\"Willy Pastor: Studienk√∂pfe. Berlin 1902. Zitiert nach Br√∂han 2002, S. 39. At these exhibitions, art critics wandered with amazement from picture to picture, which some of them found lacking in taste and refinement. In such works as Hasenheide Amusement Park (1895), a superficial holiday mood contrasts with the sour expressions of the supposed merrymakers. In Here a family can make coffee (1895), the worn and lined faces of the women evoke a similar mood, while in Tingle-tangle (1890), the patriotically decorated interior of a nightspot contrasts with a risqu√© performance by a prostitute. In Berlin Amusement Park, a cigarette-smoking adolescent worker contrasts with a child blowing up a balloon, and the watercolor New Houses (1895) depicts monotonous rows of empty new tenements near a factory. At the end of the 19th century the Berlin art scene split into two camps due to the dissatisfaction of innovative artists with officially sanctioned exhibits in the city's museums. Under the leadership of impressionist Walter Leistikow, \\"The XI\\" art group was established in 1892, and Baluschek was invited to participate in XI exhibits. In 1898 many members of XI, also led by Leistikow, formed the Berlin Secession ‚Äî among them Baluschek, who became the group's secretary. The Secession also enlisted German artists K√§the Kollwitz, Otto Nagel and Heinrich Zille, and championed French impressionism, pointillism and symbolism. Baluschek regularly debuted his work in Secession exhibitions, becoming a foil for conservative critics. For example, Waldemar Count von Oriola, a Reichstag deputy from the National Liberal Party, termed his work a \\"rampant travesty of aesthetic norms. In 1900 Baluschek fell in love with stage actress Charlotte von Pazatka-Lipinsky. He painted an artistic declaration of love for her in the form of a fairytale picture, in which he appeared as an elf giving a rose to a lady resembling Pzatka-Lipinsky. They were married in 1902 and moved into a house in the Tiergarten district of Berlin. However, their initially romantic marriage proved childless and personally unsatisfying, and they were divorced in 1913. Baluschek was profiled in 1904 as the first in a monograph series by Hermann Esswein titled Modern Illustrators, which later included Edvard Munch, Toulouse-Lautrec and Aubrey Beardsley. Esswein highlighted not only Baluschek's popular fairytale illustrations, but also his gritty renderings of Berlin working-class life.Hermann Esswein: Hans Baluschek. Piper, M√ºnchen und Leipzig 1910. In 1908 Baluschek became a member of the board of directors of the Berlin Secession, in which capacity he became involved in increasingly contentious debate. The advent of Expressionism led to arguments among Secession members. For example, Max Beckmann complained of \\"one brazen impudence after another\\" by the new breed of painters, and Liebermann obstructed a Secession exhibit featuring Henri Matisse. In 1910, a more avant- garde splinter group, the New Secession, led by Georg Tappert and Max Pechstein, staged an \\"exhibition of works rejected by the Berlin Secession.\\"Anke Daemgen: Die Neue Secession in Berlin, in Ausst. Kat.: Liebermanns Gegner ‚Äì Die Neue Secession in Berlin und der Expressionismus, Stiftung Brandenburger Tor, Max Liebermann Haus, Berlin 2011, S. 22 Internal controversy peaked in 1913, precipitating the resignation of 42 artists from the Secession, including the entire board of directors, among them Baluschek. That same year Baluschek, then 43, married Irene Dr√∂sse, a 25-year-old former art student. Their marriage endured and during World War I Irene gave birth to two daughters.  Development during World War I (1914‚Äì1918)  War Winter, 1917 The First World War had a profound influence on the arts scene in Berlin and on individual artists. Germany's declaration of war on Russia and France led to a release of pent-up tensions that had been building for decades due to strained international relations and repeated crises. Even in the artistic community there were optimistic patriotic expressions, although a few German artists, such as Kollwitz and Nagel, did not participate in the wave of popular enthusiasm. Baluschek and Liebermann were among those who contributed to art critic Paul Cassierer's journal Wartime (Kriegszeit), an attempt to show support for the war effort by the artistic community, and to the weekly publication Artists Journal of the War (K√ºnstlerbl√§tter zum Krieg). Several former Secession members, including Beckmann and Erich Heckel, volunteered for the German Army.Kriegszeit 1914‚Äì1918. In: Br√∂han 2002, S. 69‚Äì79. Baluschek's patriotic stance was at odds with his longstanding aversion to the Hohenzollern monarchy, but perhaps reflected an underlying resentment of the pervasive influence of French art in Germany. In 1915, he contributed nearly two dozen drawings to a war map published under the auspices of a hospital association. It included illustrations of modern weapons accompanied by a \\"glowing patriotic text,\\" and grisly depictions of battle scenes and field hospitals.Hans Baluschek, : Der Krieg 1914‚Äì1916. Hugo Berm√ºhler Verlag, Berlin-Lichterfelde 1915. (Digitalisat) Although in his 40s, Baluschek volunteered for military service, and in 1916 was posted as a reservist first to the Western Front, then to the Eastern Front. During his hitch in the Army he drafted more solemn depictions of battle scenes. (His close friend Martin Brandenburg, a fellow Secessionist, was severely wounded in the fighting, losing an eye, and was to die from his wounds after the war in 1919.) Baluschek's 1917 painting To the Homeland (Zur Heimat) depicts a soldier's coffin bearing medals being loaded for transport to Germany, and evokes the soldier's patriotic sacrifice. The end of the war in 1918, with its catastrophic outcome for Germany, shook Baluscheck deeply, and he kept his distance from the revolution that spawned the Weimar Republic. His artistic output shrank to a few illustrations and a Self-portrait showing him with a somber expression.

Phantasie und M√§rchen. In: Br√∂han 2002, S. 80‚Äì85 Baluschek illustrated other children's books, among them What the Calendar Tells Us (Was der Kalender erz√§hlt), Into Fairytale-land (In's M√§rchenland) and About Little People, Little Animals, and Little Things (Von Menschlein, Tierlein, Dinglein), appearing in 1919, 1922 and 1924 respectively. He also illustrated a 1925 edition of Grimm's Fairytales. Meanwhile, he produced posters and promotional materials for the theater and cinema, along with drawings of costumes for producers, and imaginative scenes of Berlin life for the famed Lutter & Wegner wine bar. Like many other artists, Balluschek found himself in crisis after the war, but he seized opportunities, and decided to become active in cultural education. He supported production of the film Mother Krause's Journey to Happiness (1919), which depicted the cruelty of poverty and lauded Communism as a saving force. In 1920, he was among founders of the People's School of Greater Berlin (Volkshochschule Gross-Berlin) and taught painting there.F√ºr die Republik. 1920‚Äì1935. In: Br√∂han 2002, S. 86‚Äì109 Baluschek also was among founders of the League for Proletarian Literature (Bund f√ºr proletarische Literatur), and in 1924 was appointed to the literary advisory board of the Social Democratic Party's \\"book circle.\\" He joined the party in 1920 and served as chairman of the artists representatives from the Sch√∂neberg district. He became an advisor to Social Democratic Mayor Gustav B√∂ss, and played a leading role in foundation of the Welfare Bureau for Berlin Artists, of which he was for a time chairman.

He belonged to the left wing of the Social Democrats, and was comfortable with activities of the Communists, a sizeable political force in Weimar Germany. His painting Future (Zukunft) appeared as the title page of the Communist journal Hammer and Sickle in 1920. Baluschek was among 10 German left-leaning artists who contributed to a 1924 international antiwar conference in Amsterdam.Friedegund Weidemann: Die Sammlung proletarisch-revolution√§rer und antifaschistischer Kunst im Otto-Nagel-Haus als dritte Abteilung der Nationalgalerie.

He was dismissed from all his posts and banned from exhibiting. Hans Baluschek died on 28 September 1935 in Berlin, aged 65, and was buried in the Wilmersdorf Forest Cemetery in Stahnsdorf, south of Berlin near Potsdam.  Postwar events  Hans Baluschek is not among the most well- known artists of the Berlin Secession. In postwar West Germany he received comparatively little attention, while in East Germany he was lionized for his left-leaning themes, and his works frequently were reproduced as illustrations in various publications. Exhibits of his works were staged on anniversaries of his death, notably in the M√§rkisches Museum in East Berlin.M√§rkisches Museum zeigt Bilder Hans Baluscheks. In: Neues Deutschland, 27.

He played second base and center field in two games for the 1873 Baltimore Marylands. He was a Baltimore native like most of his Maryland teammates. Kernan previously played for the Marylands in the second of their three professional seasons, 1870. While the team won 2 and lost 14 pro matches, he appeared at third base and second base in five of the eleven games on record, and he scored four runs, the lowest rate on the team.Wright, Marshall D.

Coverage of NABBP play, even the list of a player's teams, is generally limited to the record that Wright has published, which is compiled from various sources and commonly limited to regular and important substitute players. Little is known about baseball in the 1870s, outside the leagues, but it seems sure that many NABBP clubs continued to operate; thus adult players outside the leagues, such as Joe Kernan, continued to play competitively. Kernan may have played for the Marylands between 1870 and 1873.The Maryland club of Baltimore is one of the strongest candidates for continuation, of course, because a club of that name tried league membership in 1873. Among 19 men who played at least one of the Marylands six league games that season, five had played for the Maryland club in the NABBP including Kernan and three regulars from the 1870 team.

Early life Rottb√∏ll was born on the H√∏rbygaard estate at Holb√¶k, the son of Christen Michelsen Rottb√∏ll (died 1729) and Margrethe Cathrine Friis. His father was the manager of the estate but died in 1729. His mother was married second time to manager of Hagestedgaard Ole Nielsen Fax√∏e. Education and career Rottb√∏ll studied at the University of Copenhagen, first theology, then medicine, in which he took his doctorate degree in 1755 (De morbis deuteropathicis seu Sympathier). He then travelled abroad 1757‚Äì1761 to further his studies of medicine, and to study chemistry and botany ‚Äì the latter subject at Uppsala University with Linnaeus. From 1761, he was executive at the Botanic Garden in Copenhagen, and succeeded Georg Christian Oeder as its director in 1770. He was appointed professor at the Chair of Medicine in 1776 and received the title of \\"royal adviser\\" (konferensr√•d) in 1784.  Work on smallpox  As a medical doctor, he studied smallpox and reformed the vaccination programme that had run in Copenhagen since 1755. He abolished pre and post treatment and instead advised systematic weakening of the inoculum before application.  Botany  As a botanist, Rottb√∏ll gave out the first comprehensive list of the Flora of Greenland, Based on collection of missionaries, e.g. Paul Egede. he published descriptions of plants from the Danish colonies in India collected by Johann Gerhard K√∂nig, and similarly of plants from Suriname collected by Daniel Rolander. Corresponding with Lorenz Praetorius (1708-1781) of the Danish Moravian Church, Rottb√∏ll also solicited the collection of plant specimens in 1766 by Moravians in North America.See, especially, Manuscript list of American plants, to be collected by the Brethren and sent to Professor Friis in Copenhagen, 1766, BethCong 428, Moravian Archives, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Rottb√∏ll named the plant genus Rolandra (Asteraceae) after Rolander and the genus Kyllinga (Cyperaceae) after Peder Kylling. Carolus Linnaeus the Younger named the genus Rottboellia (Poaceae) after him. Personal life Rottb√∏ll married three times. His first wife was Ursula Schnabel (1732-1767), a daughter of rector Bernhard Schnabel (1691‚Äì1754) and Sophie Rasmusdatter (1700‚Äì52). They married on 10 May 1762 in Roskilde. His second wife was Johanne Elisabeth Mangor (1740-1771), a daughter of pharmacist Christopher Heerfordt Mangor (1704‚Äì82) and Anna Saur (c. 1715‚Äì83). They married on 18 May 1768 in Trinitatis Church in Copenhagen. His third wife was Catharina Hedvig Wohlert (1750-1811), a daughter of turner Daniel Jacob Wohlert.

Petrus Theodorus Valentinus Rusticius Boraides Germanus Iustinus,The Mar. could be an abbreviation of either Marcellus, Marcianus or Marianus. . simply and commonly known as Justin (, ; ), was an East Roman (Byzantine) aristocrat and general. A member of the Justinian Dynasty and nephew of Emperor Justinian I (), he was appointed as one of the last Roman consuls in 540, before going on to assume senior military commands in the Balkans and in Lazica. He fought against the Slavs, the Sassanid Persians and supervised the Byzantine Empire's first contacts with the Avars. At the time of Justinian's death, he was seen as a probable successor, but was beaten to the throne by his cousin, Justin II (), who exiled him to Egypt, where he was murdered. Biography=Early life and campaigns Justin was born around 525, the eldest son of Germanus and his wife Passara. Germanus was a cousin of the Byzantine emperor Justinian I () and thus a member of the wider Justinian dynasty and cousin to Justinian's successor, Emperor Justin II ().. In 540, he was named ordinary consul at a very young age; he is illustrated as beardless in his consular diptych, and is still mentioned as a \\"young man\\" by Procopius nine years later. At this point, he already held the title of vir illustris and the honorary office of comes domesticorum. In the same year, he accompanied his father to the East against the Sassanid Persians, but saw no action. In 549, he was instrumental in the revelation of the plot to overthrow Emperor Justinian by the Armenian general Artabanes and his associates. The conspirators intended to assassinate Emperor Justinian and his favourite general Belisarius, and raise Germanus to the Byzantine throne. Notified of their intentions, Justin informed his father, who then told Marcellus, the Count of the Excubitors, leading to the plotters' arrest.; ; . The northern Balkans in Late Antiquity. In 550, together with his younger brother Justinian, he joined their father in his expedition against Ostrogoth Italy, but Germanus died suddenly in the autumn of 550, before the army had left the Balkans, where it was assembling... After this, Justinian and Germanus's son- in-law, John, led the army towards Salona (modern Split, Croatia), where the eunuch Narses assumed command in late 551.. In early 551, Justin was attached to a force under the eunuch Scholasticus that campaigned against a Slavic raid in the eastern Balkans. The Byzantines were initially defeated near Adrianople but went on to score a victory, after which the Slavs left Byzantine lands.. In early 552, Justin and Justinian were placed at the head of another expedition against a Slavic raid against Illyricum, but their forces were too small to confront the raiders directly. Instead, the brothers had to content themselves with harassing them. Shortly after, they were ordered north to assist the Lombards against the Gepids along with Aratius, Suartuas, and Amalafridas, but the Byzantines were detained from advancing too far north by the need to suppress religious strife in the city of Ulpiana.. High command in Lazica and the Danube Map of Lazica In 554, now experienced in military affairs, Justin was sent east to Lazica to join the Byzantine forces under Bessas, Buzes, and Martin. His first encounter with the Persians was unsuccessful. Along with Bessas, Justin and his troops were encamped at the plain of Chytropolia, near the strategically important fortress of Telephis, which was held by Martin. The Persian general Mihr-Mihroe, however, succeeded in dislodging Martin from Telephis. Martin withdrew to join the other two generals at Chytropolia, but there again the Byzantine army, too slow to take up position, was forced to flee in disarray before the advancing Persians, retreating along the Phasis river to the fortified island of Nesos (ŒùŒÆœÉŒøœÇ, Greek for \\"island\\").; . Bessas was dismissed from high command as magister militum per Armeniam after this debacle, and succeeded by Martin with Justin as his second in command. Justin was ignorant of Martin's intention to assassinate their ally, the Lazic king Gubazes II; when he learned of the deed, he was shocked, but did not reprimand Martin because he believed ‚Äì wrongly ‚Äì that the murder had been carried out at the orders of Emperor Justinian.; ; . The Byzantines then launched an attack on the Persian fort of Onoguris, but they were forced to abandon it at the unexpectedly quick arrival of Persian relief forces under Nachoragan. In spring 556, Justin was with the rest of the Byzantine forces at Nesos, when Nakhoragan invaded western Lazica, making for the town of Phasis. The Byzantines hastily departed for the town, managing to reach it before the Persian army and then proceeded to successfully defend it during a prolonged siege.; ; . Following this success, in early 556 Justin returned to Nesos to guard it together with Buzes, while the rest of the army marched against the Misimians, a tribe that had recently allied itself with the Persians and killed the Byzantine general Soterichus. Justin's only activity during this time was to dispatch one of his officers, Elminzur, to capture Rhodopolis (modern Vartsikhe) with 2,000 cavalry.; ; . In the next year, a general truce was agreed, which was finalized into a peace treaty in 562.; . Soon after, an imperial investigation into Gubazes's murder brought to light Martin's culpability. His military successes spared his life, but cost him his command; he was replaced as magister militum per Armeniam by Justin in spring 557.. It was in this capacity that in late 557 Justin received the first Avar embassy to the Byzantine Empire. The Avars, who had fled their ancestral lands in Central Asia before the rise of the G√∂kt√ºrks, asked for imperial protection and for land to settle on. Justin forwarded them to Constantinople, where they arrived in December. Turned away from the Empire and towards the plains of the Ukraine by Justinian, the Avars defeated enemy after enemy and eventually reached the northeastern bank of the Danube in 561/562.; . There they again encountered Justin, who had just been transferred to the command of the quaestura exercitus covering the lower Danubian limes (the Limes Moesiae). At this time, the Avars demanded to settle in Byzantine imperial territory in Scythia Minor, whose defences had been devastated by a recent Kotrigur invasion led by Zabergan. Here, Justin played a crucial role and gained great fame, by learning of the Avars' intentions and warning Justinian. Consequently, the Avar embassy to Constantinople was detained while the Byzantine defences were put in order. With Justin continuing to maintain a careful watch over the Danube river, the Avars contented themselves with the annual subsidy paid by Byzantium, and left the Empire in peace for some years to come.; . Exile and death At the time of Emperor Justinian's death in 565, due to his titles and reputation as a commander, as well his army's proximity to the imperial capital, he was the leading contender for the vacant throne, along with his cousin Justin, the curopalates. The latter, however, was already present at Constantinople, and could count on the support of the Byzantine Senate, and especially of Patriarch John Scholasticus and the Count of the Excubitors Tiberius, whom he had helped secure his post. Thus Justin was hastily elevated to the throne on the same day that Justinian died.. According to the contemporary historian Evagrius Scholasticus, the two Justins had reached an agreement whereby whoever would be crowned emperor would make the other the \\"second man\\" in the empire. When Justin II recalled his cousin to Constantinople, it seemed that this was the reason. The general was warmly received at first, but soon the new emperor began to make accusations against him, dismissed his bodyguard and placed him under house arrest, before sending him to exile in Alexandria, ostensibly as the new augustal prefect of Egypt. There, he was murdered in his sleep, ostensibly because he was plotting to seize the throne, and his head was cut off and brought to Constantinople. In reality, he was too great a threat to the new emperor to be left alive; the Visigoth chronicler John of Biclaro explicitly attributes the murder to Justin II's wife, the Empress Sophia.; .

He also occasionally participated in the daily confession, Dedicoat retired from newsreading and continuity announcing duties on BBC Radio 2 on Friday 27 March 2015, but briefly returned on Monday 30 March 2015 for one final confession. Rebecca Pike Rebecca Pike presented the business news at 17:30 and 18:40 every day, and at the end of the 17:30 bulletin also reports on the FTSE market data and exchange rates. On Fridays she interviewed a guest with a new invention, known as the Innovation Slot. Pike was known as 'Sister Rebecca' when participating in the daily confession. She left the programme and the station on 17 December 2015. Stand-in Presenters Stand-in presenters on the show included Patrick Kielty, Liza Tarbuck, Ryan Tubridy, Richard Allinson, Richard Bacon, Mark Goodier, Sara Cox and Amol Rajan. Show Features The show's opening and closing theme tune was a 2003 recording by Jools Holland and Prince Buster of the 1948 song \\"Enjoy Yourself (It's Later than You Think)\\" by Carl Sigman and Herb Magidson. Before the theme plays, a re-written, a cappella version of \\"Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)\\" by Harry Belafonte played, with \\"Day-O, me say Day-O\\" replaced with \\"Mayo, Simon Mayo\\". Previously, some editions of the show also used the 1950 hit version by Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians, or occasionally the version by The Specials from their 1980 album More Specials. The instrumental \\"Garden Party\\" by Mezzoforte was used as a backing track during one of the show's features. Monday-Thursday Regular Features * Three Word-ers: Listeners sent in a summary of their day in no more than three words, which were read out sporadically throughout the show. There was also a \\"talking text service\\" where listeners read out their three word-er live on air. * The Oldies: A selection of five or six songs all related to a particular topic relevant to that day's events were played throughout the show, chosen by readers of the show's blog and followers of the show's official Twitter and Facebook accounts. * \\"Subject\\" Guest: At around 17:20, a guest was introduced and they discuss an issue raised in the previous day's show, or in the news on that day. The guest was generally an expert in the subject area under discussion. The music used in this section was usually an instrumental version of Ray LaMontagne's \\"Repo Man\\" from his 2010 album God Willin' & the Creek Don't Rise, although occasionally the theme to children's sci-fi series Joe 90 was used. * Homework Sucks: Listeners were invited to send in questions to see if other listeners could answer them. These could be any form of question, and two or three per day were selected to be answered (to varying degrees of success) by the general public. Previously, only one question was selected per show with a definitive answer provided by an academic or other expert in whatever subject area the question relates to. The original premise of the feature was that it was only open to children wanting help with their homework (hence the title) but was soon expanded to general questions from anyone. The music used in this section was Chicken Man by Alan Hawkshaw, best known in the UK as the theme tune to children's school-based drama Grange Hill. Latterly the interview with an expert was dropped and three potential answers from listeners were read out. During this time the feature was also known as The Radio 2 Search Engine or Twoogle. * Confessions: Carried on from Mayo's previous radio shows on BBC Radio 1, listeners sent in embarrassing or funny stories about them injuring, or playing practical jokes on people, that they never owned up to at the time it happened, Mayo still broadcasts to the nation over Tomaso Giovanni Albinoni's Adagio for Organ and Strings in G minor. Mayo's co-presenters offered forgiveness (or not, as the case may be) before listeners being invited to text or email in their verdicts on the story, some of which were read out over the course of the rest of the show. The confessions from the week were compiled into a weekly podcast, released on Fridays. * Celebrity Guests: On most days, the show invited a celebrity guest(s) on in the second hour of the show (when it was not taken up by Nigel Barden's food slot, or the Book Club), who were there to plug a newly released film, TV series or book. * The Drivetime Live Sessions: Occasionally, an artist or band would perform a number of their tracks live in the studio. In between songs, they were interviewed by Mayo. * The Radio 2 Book Club: (fortnightly, Mondays) An author was interviewed about a recently published book that they had written, and the team reviewed and discussed the book. Listeners also sent in their reviews, and a preview chapter was usually uploaded onto the show's webpage. * Tunesday: (fortnightly, Tuesdays) In lieu of a guest, the half-hour between 18:00 and 18:30 was given over to songs over 5 minutes long that aren't usually played on the radio in their full length versions. Listeners sent in suggestions for tracks and 3 or 4 are played. * Foodie Thursday: (weekly, Thursdays) The show's resident chef, Nigel Barden, cooked the team some (sometimes unusual) dishes. * Matt's Middle-Aged Midweek Mosh: (weekly, Wednesdays) Sports reporter (and rock fan) Matt Williams announced a weekly classic rock record, played at around 18:45, and encouraged everyone listening to act as if they were in a mosh pit, and \\"rock out\\". * The Showstopper: Listeners were invited to email in their suggestions for the last song to be played on the show, which was in the same musical genre as the specialist music show following Drivetime on any particular day. Previously, a listener vote decided the choice but this was replaced in September 2012 with the current system. The different genres were: ** Monday ‚Äì Rhythm and blues (preceding Paul Jones, later Cerys Matthews) ** Tuesday ‚Äì Jazz (preceding Jamie Cullum) ** Wednesday ‚Äì Folk (preceding Mike Harding, later Mark Radcliffe) ** Thursday ‚Äì Country (preceding Bob Harris) * All-Request Rollover: Monday-Thursday the show featured a listener who didn't manage to get on the Friday All-Request show with their chosen song as a 'rollover' from Friday's show. * Secret Santana: Every year, in the run up to Christmas the team played a round of 'Secret Santana' in which Mayo got one of the presenters or guests to pick a name out of the 'Secret Santana Fez' to randomly choose a track to play by Carlos Santana. * Brucie Bonus: For the first three months of 2015, every show featured at least one track by Bruce Springsteen. The name is a reference to one of British TV host Bruce Forsyth's many catchphrases from Play Your Cards Right. * Facts of the Day: After the news at 6 o'clock, humorous \\"facts of the day\\" were read relating to the specialist subject area of each of Mayo, Williams and Pike. Each fact had its own title relating to the content of the fact. This feature was dropped in spring 2015. * The Quiz: At around 18:35 Mayo, Pike and Williams quizzed each other on their respective specialist subjects, and a score was kept throughout the week. The music used in this feature is a 1970 cha-cha-ch√° rendition of The Doors' \\"Light My Fire\\" by Edmundo Ros and his Orchestra. This feature was dropped during the summer of 2015. All-Request Friday To allow Mayo time to continue to present Kermode and Mayo's Film Review on 5Live and following on from Chris Evans' Drivetime show, on Fridays all records played were chosen by the listeners ‚Äì hence the name. The regular features from Mondays-Thursdays did not appear. Regular background music used on Fridays included \\"On the Rebound\\" by Floyd Cramer, \\"Tom Hark\\" by The Piranhas, \\"A Swingin' Safari\\" by Bert Kaempfert, \\"Giorgio by Moroder\\" by Daft Punk and \\"House of the King\\" by Focus, as well as other stock instrumentals in different musical styles. * Mah N√† Mah N√†: A regular song on All Request Friday was the 1976 Muppets version of Piero Umiliani's Mah N√† Mah N√† (although the version played was the remastered version from the soundtrack to the 2011 film The Muppets). Introduced as \\"that song\\", it was usually the second track played on the show. * Friday Fixture: In his 18:50 bulletin, sports reporter Matt Williams had the Friday Fixture where a participant in an \\"obscure\\" sport (i.e. one which is not widely reported in the media) was interviewed. Special shows Occasionally there was a special edition of the show, covering special events in the UK. Such events included pre-show coverage of the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards, a fortnight of special shows for the London 2012 Olympics and a special programme from the Science Museum in London to commemorate the BBC's 90th anniversary on 14 November 2012. Other media=Podcasts As with several other shows across BBC Radio, highlights from the show were released as a podcast, which could be downloaded from the BBC's website and from other sources (such as iTunes). Two weekly podcasts were produced, both released on Fridays. The Weekly Mayo featured highlights of the interviews from the preceding week, whilst Simon Mayo's Confessions was a collection of the confessions. Books Two books have been released by Bantam Press, both based on features from the show. The first, Confessions, was released on 13 October 2011 featuring a collection of the best confessions featured on the programme, and the second, entitled Homework Sucks!, was released a year later on 11 October 2012 featuring a selection of the \\"Homework Sucks\\" questions and answers. Album An album featuring a selection of live tracks performed on the show, alongside other tracks picked by Mayo was released on 24 February 2014. =Track listingAwards The show won the title of Best Music Programme in the 2011 Sony Radio Academy Awards.

Biography Simmons was born in Twist, Arkansas. In his youth, he befriended James Cotton, and both learned to play the harmonica as they were growing up. Simmons relocated to St. Louis, Missouri, at the age of 18 and worked on the railroad. Around this time he made his stage debut with Robert Nighthawk. In 1954, he moved to Chicago, Illinois, put together his own backing band, and had a five- year residency at Cadillac Baby's. He commenced recording in 1959, issuing records on several labels, including Chess. In the late 1950s and early 1960s Simmons recorded several more obscure singles, often simply billed as Little Mack (or Mac). He owned and managed the Zodiac Lounge, in Chicago, from the mid- to late 1960s, providing opportunities for other artists. He also owned a recording studio and recorded on his own labels, PM Records and Simmons Records. Simmons left the music industry for the ministry in the 1960s and was rarely heard for the next 30 years, notwithstanding an album he recorded in 1975 in Paris. His returned to blues music with High & Lonesome (1995), an early success for St. George Records, an independent record label. His energetic style, accompanied by Studebaker John, belied his years. Come Back to Me Baby (1996), with featured sidemen John Primer, Willie Kent and Jake Dawson (guitarist), was also well received. Simmons died of colon cancer on October 24, 2000, in his adopted hometown of Chicago; he was 67.

Operation principle The telescopic pixel design is based on the optical telescope. 'Telescopic' indicates that each pixel acts as a miniature telescope consisting of a primary and secondary mirror that can both be deformed by application of specific voltage. When the pixel is turned off, the primary and secondary mirrors are parallel, therefore both block the passage of light, reflecting it back to the backlight, so that the pixel appears dark. When the pixel is on, the primary mirror deforms into a parabolic shape that focuses light onto the secondary mirror. After reflecting from the secondary mirror, light propagates through the hole in the membrane and the pixel appears bright. Advantages Performance tests on arrays of telescopic pixels suggest they hold substantial promise for future displays. Backlight transmission was measured at 36 percent, and simulations indicated that this could reach 56 percent with design improvements. In a modern laptop with a five-hour battery life, this increase in efficiency could lead to almost 45 extra minutes of battery time without reducing screen brightness. Pixel response time was 0.625 ms‚Äîfast compared to LCDs, which have 2 to 10 ms response times. These response times may also be fast enough to allow sequential color processing where colors are displayed as rapid pulses of red, blue, and green from each pixel, streamlining fabrication and device design. Other advantages of the telescopic pixel are potential low cost as well as relative ease of fabrication and control. Disadvantages The only drawback of TPD would be the contrast ratio. Experimental measurements conducted with non-collimated light showed a very low contrast ratio of 20:1. Simulations indicate that contrast ratios of up to 800:1 may be possible, which is also possible with current LCD technology. Plasma & organic light- emitting diode have much higher contrast ratios, so a lot needs to be done to compete with these technologies.

Early life Crowe was the only child of Mr. and Mrs. Edward Crowe of Saltburn-by-the-Sea, Yorkshire, He was educated at Mill Hill School from 1907 until 1911. World War I service Crowe was granted Aviator's Certificate No. 898 on 8 September 1914 after flying at the Grahame-White Flying School at Hendon Aerodrome. On 1 October, he was commissioned in the Royal Flying Corps as a probationary second lieutenant, was appointed a flying officer on 22 December, and confirmed in his rank on 6 January 1915. On 24 April 1915, he was promoted to lieutenant. Crowe was appointed a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain on 14 October, and 1 December was promoted from temporary captain to captain. When the founding Officer Commanding of No. 56 Squadron, Major Richard Blomfield, went recruiting pilots for the new unit, Crowe was chosen on the basis of his skills to be a flight commander. He came aboard as leader of \\"B\\" Flight on 19 April 1917.Bowyer (1977), p.164. He scored his first victory on 24 April 1917; by 30 April, his count stood at four. Crowe was involved in Albert Ball's last dogfight on 7 May, and was the last British pilot to see Ball still alive. Crowe reported that Ball was last seen flying into a thunderhead. Between 23 May and 16 June, Crowe increased his number of aerial victories by five, to bring his total to nine. On 26 October 1917 Crowe was appointed a squadron commander, with the temporary rank of major, to serve as an instructor at the Central Flying School, remaining in that post until 21 February 1918, when he also relinquished his temporary rank. Crowe returned to No. 56 Squadron, accounting for five more enemy aircraft between 18 March and 1 July. Upon James McCudden's death on 9 July, Crowe took over as commander of No. 60 Squadron, with another appointment to the temporary rank of major. By then, his tally stood at 14 victories. On 29 July, he crashed a car into a tree while returning from a party in Dieppe. The accident killed his old schoolmate Owen Scholte, as well as Major Foggin. The resultant court-martial reduced Crowe to the rank of captain for a month. He was then reinstated in the rank of major and given command of No. 85 Squadron. He scored his fifteenth and last victory for them on 16 September 1918. Crowe's talents as a fighter pilot were described by Arthur Rhys-Davids, one of the pilots in \\"B\\" Flight, 56 Squadron: \\"Crowe is not afraid of anything and goes after old Huns like a rocket and yet he is extraordinarily prudent.\\" Crowe eventually left the RAF, being transferred to the Unemployed List on 25 September 1919. Between the wars Crowe married Elena Temperley at Saint John's Anglican church in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 21 September 1929. They went on to have four children: Robin, Peter, Sally Eyrielle, and Bettina Frederica. Crowe was granted a commission as a flight lieutenant (and honorary squadron leader) in the Reserve of Air Force Officers on 20 November 1937. World War II On 1 September 1939 Crowe relinquished his reserve commission and joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve as a flight lieutenant, with seniority from 13 March. He rose to the rank of wing commander.

Myles Dillon was born in Dublin; he was one of six children of John Dillon and his wife Elizabeth Mathew; James Matthew Dillon, the leader of Fine Gael, was his younger brother. Myles Dillon graduated from University College Dublin, than travelled to Germany and France, where he studied in deep Old Irish and Celtic philology under Joseph Vendryes and Rudolf Thurneysen. Dillon taught Sanskrit and comparative philology in Trinity College, Dublin (1928‚Äì1930) and University College, Dublin (1930‚Äì1937). In 1937 moved to USA, where he taught Irish in the University of Madison (his son John M. Dillon was born in Madison), in 1946-1947 taught in Chicago. On his return to Ireland worked in the School of Celtic Studies in Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies; was the director of the School from 1960 till 1968, edited Celtica. Volume 11 of Celtica is dedicated to his memory. From 1966 to 1967 he was President of the Royal Irish Academy. Myles Dillon is the author of a number of important scholarly books, handbooks and translations from Old Irish. Among his most notable works are The Cycles of the Kings (1946), Early Irish literature (1948), The Celtic realms (1967, with Nora Kershaw Chadwick). M. Dillon published a modern translation and commentary of The Book of Rights (, 1962). He also translated Dieux et h√©ros des Celtes by Marie-Louise Sjoestedt into English, thus making the book available for a wider scholarly audience. The monograph Celts and Aryans, published posthumously by the Indian Institute of Advanced Study reflects Dillon's interest in the traces of the shared heritage in the Indian and Irish cultures deriving from Proto-Indo-European society based on a period of research Dillon spent in Simla, India.

As of 2018, South Africa was the seventh largest producer and consumer of coal in the world. This large industry, means that as of 2015 about 80,000 workers, or .5% of total employment, was from the coal industry, down from a peak in 1981 of 135,000 workers. Around 77% of South Africa's energy needs are directly derived from coal. South Africa is the 5th largest exporter of coal in the world, with 30% consumed overseas. 92% of coal consumed on the African continent is produced in South Africa. 80% of South Africa's CO2 emissions come from the energy supply which is dependent on coal, which produced the vast majority of the country's energy, or 42GWs. The use of coal in South Africa dates back to the Iron Age (300‚Äì1880 AD), when charcoal was used to melt iron and copper, but large-scale exploitation of coal did not occur until the mid-19th century. Geology The surface exposure of the rocks belonging to the Karoo Supergroup. South Africa's coal occurs in the Ecca group (coloured mustard yellow). These rocks were deposited in a vast inland lake or sea, when Africa was part of Gondwana. It was only along the northern and north-eastern shores of this body of water where marshes formed peat, and eventually turned into coal. The largest coal deposits in South Africa are to be found in the Ecca deposits, a stratum of the Karoo Supergroup, dating from the Permian period, between 280 and 250 Ma. The Ecca Group is extensive, covering around two thirds of South Africa (much of it covered by slightly younger rocks - see diagram on the left). Only the northern and north-eastern portion of these Ecca deposits is coal-bearing, but it nevertheless contains more than a third of all coal reserves in the Southern Hemisphere.Schl√ºter & Trauth 2006, p. 214 Notable coalfields are: * Waterberg Coalfield * Highveld Coalfield * Witbank Coalfield * Ermelo Coalfield * Utrecht Coalfield * Klip River Coalfield Economic impact South Africa is one of the seven largest coal-producing and one of the top five coal-exporting countries in the world. More than a quarter of coal mined in South Africa is exported, most of which leaves the country via Richards Bay. Coal is South Africa's third largest source of foreign exchange; platinum being the largest and gold second. Around 15% of the country's GDP (2000 estimate) is spent on energy and 77% of that is derived from coal. In 2004, the coal and lignite mining industry generated a gross income of R39 billion and directly employed 50,000 people. The Witbank Coalfield accounts for 40% of South Africa's coal production.Schl√ºter & Trauth 2006, p. 216 Mining The five largest coal mining companies account for around 85% of all production. They are Anglo American plc, South32's South Africa Energy Coal, Sasol Mining, Glencore Xstrata, and Exxaro . Open-pit mining account for roughly half of South African coal mining operations, the other half being sub-surface. Coal consumption=Electricity generation Electricity generation accounts for 43% of all coal consumed in South Africa (1997 estimate). Many of the country's coal-fired power station are located in close proximity to a coal mine and are supplied with fuel directly from the mine. The Grootegeluk open cast mine on the Waterberg Coalfield in Limpopo is one of the largest in the country and feeds the Matimba Power Station with about 14.6 million tons of coal a year via a conveyor system. The mine is also contracted to supply the new Medupi Power Station. Liquid fuel Around 35% of liquid fuel used in South Africa is derived from coal mined by Sasol Mining at the Secunda CTL plants. Household use In 1995 around a million lower-income households in South Africa depended on coal as their primary energy source for cooking, lighting and heating. This number has been decreasing steadily during the first decade of the 21st century due to the expansion of electricity supply to lower-income households and rural regions. Environmental impact Environmentalists in South Africa and abroad have criticized the decision of the World Bank's approval for a $3.75 billion loan to build the world‚Äôs fourth-largest coal- fired power in South Africa. The plant will increase the demand for coal mining and production. Protesters are urging the bank to stop supporting the development of coal plants and other large emitters of greenhouse gas and polluting operations from coal mining.World Bank approves coal plant is South Africa 9 April 2010 Democracy Now! Usage of coal and liquid fuel derived from coal accounts for around 86% of the 113 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions South Africa produces annually (2006 estimate) and represents around 40% of Africa's total coal derived CO emissions. The largest contributor to coal-derived air pollution, in Gauteng, is household coal usage (65%), followed by industry (30%) and electricity generation (5%). Some coal mines have been abandoned by their owners, mainly due to companies ceasing to exist. Many of these mines, such as the Transvaal and Delagoa Bay Collieries (T&DB;) outside Witbank, have not been rehabilitated prior to being abandoned and are a major source of water and air pollution. It is estimated that clean-up and rehabilitation of the T&DB; Collieries will cost around R100 million. Coal seam fires were common, but controlled, at T&DB; Collieries during the mine's operation, but the fires have been left to burn out of control since the mine was closed in 1953, to the extent that in 1995 flames could be seen above ground.

The idea of the multi-level technique is to reduce the magnitude of a graph by merging vertices together, compute a partition on this reduced graph, and finally project this partition on the original graph. In the first phase the magnitude of the graph is reduced by merging vertices. The merging of vertices is done iteratively: of a graph a new coarser graph is created and of this new coarser graph an even more coarse graph is created. This is done until a certain small magnitude is reached. Thus graphs with different magnitudes are induced. In the second phase a partition of the graph with the smallest magnitude - the coarsest graph - is computed. In the third and last phase, the computed partition is iteratively projected back to the original graph. In each iteration a refinement heuristic is applied. The merging of vertices induces a map between vertices of a graph and vertices of its coarser graph which is used for the back projection. A rebalancing to ensure the size of the partition may be needed since vertices not belonging to the same partition may be merged. The multi-level technique has shown to significantly improve the results, in terms of both quality and running time. Especially when used on heuristics considering the graph only locally, as the multi-level technique constitutes a more global view on the graph.

It is one of the oldest churches in the city and has undergone numerous changes since its foundation. The present building is the result of a major reconstruction project which was undertaken in 1575. The church is notable particularly for the Cornaro Chapel, an important example of Early Renaissance architecture, added by Mauro Codussi during the 1490s. The chapel is the burial place of several members of the powerful Cornaro family (), including Catherine Cornaro, Queen of Cyprus and Armenia. The church houses several works of art including pieces by Giambattista Tiepolo and Paolo Veronese. History In the 7th century Venice was not yet a city, but a collection of small communities scattered throughout the lagoon. St Magnus (), the Bishop of Oderzo, came to the lagoon and founded eight churches.Giordano, Venice Described, p. 85 According to a legend recounted by the historian Flaminio Cornaro, St Magnus had a vision of the Twelve Apostles who commanded him to build a church on a site where he saw twelve cranes. This location, eventually to be in the ' of Cannaregio, became the site of the church of San Apostoli. The church stands on the ' at the beginning of the ' (New Road). During the 1490s the ', built as a burial place for the wealthy Venetian Cornaro family, was added to the church.Biucchi, Venice: An Architectural Guide, p. 2.22 It is considered one of the most important Early Renaissance chapels in Venice. It is unknown exactly who designed the chapel, although it is most often attributed to the architect Mauro Codussi.Huse, The Art of Renaissance Venice, p. 86 At the same time a porch was added to the front of the church and a sacristy was built. These alterations were also overseen by Codussi. In the middle of the 16th century the church briefly housed the Catecumeni, a Venetian fraternity for those wishing to convert to Christianity, before they established a permanent home at San Gregorio in 1571.Pullan, The Jews of Europe, p. 262 Shortly after this, in 1575, the church was completely rebuilt. Only parts of the earlier structure were retained, including some frescos and the Cornaro Chapel. During the early 18th century, Andrea Tirali added detailing, including the onion dome, to the campanile which itself had been a late 17th-century addition. Interior The church retains its 16th century layout: a single nave supported by two rows of columns. One chapel has the funeral monument of Count Giuseppe Mangilli, designed by Luigi Trezza with bust by Angelo Pizzi. The main altarpiece is a Custodian Angel by Bernardo Strozzi.Nuova Guida di Venezia by Giannantonio Moschini, 1842, page 83.

Storey (born October 23, 1949) is a Canadian scientist whose work draws from a variety of fields including biochemistry and molecular biology. He is a Professor of Biology, Biochemistry and Chemistry at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. Storey has a world-wide reputation for his research on biochemical adaptation - the molecular mechanisms that allow animals to adapt to and endure severe environmental stresses such as deep cold, oxygen deprivation, and desiccation. Biography Kenneth Storey studied biochemistry at the University of Calgary (B.Sc. '71) and zoology at the University of British Columbia (Ph.D. '74). Storey is a Professor of Biochemistry, cross-appointed in the Departments of Biology, Chemistry and Neuroscience and holds the Canada Research Chair in Molecular Physiology at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. Storey is an elected fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, of the Society for Cryobiology and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He has won fellowships and awards for research excellence including the Fry medal from the Canadian Society of Zoologists (2011), the Flavelle medal from the Royal Society of Canada (2010), Ottawa Life Sciences Council Basic Research Award (1998), a Killam Senior Research Fellowship (1993‚Äì1995), the Ayerst Award from the Canadian Society for Molecular Biosciences (1989), an E.W.R. Steacie Memorial Fellowship from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (1984‚Äì1986), and four Carleton University Research Achievement Awards. Storey is the author of over 844 research articles, the editor of seven books, has given over 500 talks at conferences and institutes worldwide, and organized numerous international symposia. Research Storey is one of the most cited researchers in the world. Storey's research includes studies of enzyme properties, gene expression, protein phosphorylation, and cellular signal transduction mechanisms to seek out the basic principles of how organisms endure and flourish under extreme conditions. He is particularly known within the field of cryobiology for his studies of animals that can survive freezing, especially the frozen \\"frog-sicles\\" (Rana sylvatica) that have made his work popular with multiple TV shows and magazines. Storey's studies of the adaptations that allow frogs, insects, and other animals to survive freezing have made major advances in the understanding of how cells, tissues and organs can endure freezing. Storey was also responsible for the discovery that some turtle species are freeze tolerant: newly hatched painted turtles that spend their first winter on land (Chrysemys picta marginata & C. p. bellii). These turtles are unique as they are the only reptiles, and highest vertebrate life form, known to tolerate prolonged natural freezing of extracellular body fluids during winter hibernation. These advances may aid the development of organ cryopreservation technology. A second area of his research is metabolic rate depression - understanding the mechanisms by which some animals can sharply reduce their metabolism and enter a state of hypometabolism or torpor that allows them to survive over the long term under difficult environmental stresses. His studies have identified molecular mechanisms that underlie metabolic arrest across phylogeny and that support phenomena including mammalian hibernation, estivation, and anoxia and ischemia tolerance. Control mechanisms include transcription factor changes that alter gene expression, and reversible phosphorylation of key metabolic enzymes by protein kinases and protein phosphatases. These studies across multiple species also hold key applications for medical science, particularly for preservation technologies that aim to extend the survival time of excised organs in cold or frozen storage. Additional applications include insights into hyperglycemia in metabolic syndrome and diabetes, and anoxic and ischemic damage caused by heart attack and stroke. Furthermore, Storey's lab has created several web based programs freely available for data management, data plotting, and micro RNA analysis.

There are two subtypes divided by symptoms: Type 1 and Type 2, depending on the stability of the patient's maximum speed of expiration, or peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). Type 1 is characterized by sustained, chronic variability of PEFR, while type 2 is distinguished by sudden unpredictable drops in PEFR where asthma symptoms are otherwise well controlled and the function of the lungs is not substantially impaired. Brittle asthma is one of the \\"unstable\\" subtypes of \\"difficult asthma\\", a term used to characterize the less than 5% of asthma cases that do not respond to maximal inhaled treatment, including high doses of corticosteroids combined with additional therapies such as long-acting beta-2 agonists. Diagnosis=Types The 2005 Oxford Textbook of Medicine distinguishes type 1 brittle asthma by \\"persistent daily chaotic variability in peak flow (usually greater than 40 per cent diurnal variation in PEFR more than 50 per cent of the time)\\", while type 2 is identified by \\"sporadic sudden falls in PEFR against a background of usually well-controlled asthma with normal or near normal lung function\\".Warrell, 1347. In both types, patients are subject to recurrent, severe attacks. The cardinal symptoms of an asthma attack are shortness of breath (dyspnea), wheezing, and chest tightness. Individuals with type 1 suffer chronic attacks in spite of ongoing medical therapy, while those with type 2 experience sudden, acute and even potentially life-threatening attacks even though otherwise their asthma seems well managed.Holgate et al., 292. When first defined by Margaret Turner-Warwick in 1977, the term brittle asthma was used specifically to describe type 1, but as studies into the phenotype were conducted the second type was also distinguished. Treatment In addition to any issues of treatment compliance, and maximised corticosteroids (inhaled or oral) and beta agonist, brittle asthma treatment also involves for type 1 additional subcutaneous injections of beta2 agonist and inhalation of long acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist, whilst type 2 needs allergen avoidance and self-management approaches. Since catastrophic attacks are unpredictable in type 2, patients may display identification of the issue, such as a MedicAlert bracelet, and carry an epinephrine autoinjector. Epidemiology The condition is rare. 1999's Difficult Asthma estimates a prevalence of approximately 0.05% brittle asthma sufferers among the asthmatic population.Holgate et. al, 293. Though found in all ages, it is most commonly found in individuals between the ages of 18 and 55; it is present in both sexes, though type 1 has been diagnosed in three times as many women as men. Hospitalization is more frequent for type 1 than type 2.

It lived in what is now Russia, during the Late Cretaceous. It was described in 2010 by Alifanov and Bolotsky. The type species is A. heterocoelica. Description The holotype material consists of a single anterior caudal vertebra. Also, a tooth and a few proximal tail vertebrae (from near the base of the tail) were originally described as belonging to this species, but these probably belong to an indeterminate hadrosaur. The vertebrae are unusual in being weakly heterocoelous, which means that the centrum or body of a vertebra has saddle-shaped surfaces where it meets the vertebrae in front or behind it. Classification Arkharavia was originally classified as a titanosauriform sauropod, thought to be related to Chubutisaurus, a sauropod from the Cretaceous of Argentina. However, further study showed that the referred vertebra in fact belonged to a hadrosaurid. The holotype vertebra is currently considered an indeterminate somphospondylan. Contemporaries Arkharavia lived in the Amur Region, which was a 'hot spot' for dinosaurs in Russia. Other dinosaurs from the area include the lambeosaurines (hollow-crested duckbills) Amurosaurus, Olorotitan, and Charonosaurus, and the saurolophine (duckbills without hollow crests) Kerberosaurus and Wulagasaurus.

He developed railcar-launched ICBM RT-23 Molodets and other Soviet rockets.  Early life  Utkin was born in the village of Pustobor, Yerakhtursk area of Ryazan region, Russia. After graduation, he was drafted into the army. He fought in the Great Patriotic War, earning medals. He graduated from the Jet Armament department of Leningrad military engineering institute in 1952. He earned his Doctorate of Engineering in 1967.  Career  RT-23 Molodets in the Saint Petersburg railway museum. Utkin was sent to Special Design Bureau #586 in Dnepropetrovsk, where he worked on the organization of series production of first Soviet ballistic missiles R-1, R-2, R-5 designed by Sergey Korolev. After the foundation of Yuzhnoye design office, he worked as an engineer, senior engineer, group head, sector head, department head, Deputy and First Deputy Chief Designer. In 1971, he became Chief Designer, and then General Designer of Yuzhnoye design office. In 1990‚Äì2000, Vladimir Utkin worked as General Director of TsNIIMASh, Russia. As Yuzhnoye's General Designer, Utkin helped materialize the concepts and projects conceived by his predecessor Mikhail Yangel. Under Utkin's leadership, Yuzhnoye developed and put into service strategic missile systems that formed the basis of the Strategic Rocket Forces. Among these missiles were the SS-18, one of the most powerful and efficient liquid-propellant intercontinental ballistic missiles, called Satan by the Americans, and the solid-propellant SS-24 ICBM (Scalpel) in silo-based and rail-mobile versions. The Cyclone and Zenit space launch systems and military, scientific, and civil application spacecraft were among the systems developed and put into service. Scientific and technical problems solved during development include leak- tightness of propellant system, leaving fueled missiles on stand for a long time, heavy missiles were launched from containers \\"mortar style\\", anti- ballistic missile systems were developed. Silos were superhardened, missiles were hardened against nuclear strike; a high degree of combat readiness and high missile firing accuracy were achieved. Vasiliy Utkin placed emphasis on environmental protection, automation of prelaunch operations, missile firing rates, and other topical issues. Solution of a number of scientific and technical problems led to the development of Zenit, the best medium-lift launch vehicle in the world, which subsequently became the basis of big international projects Sea Launch and Land Launch. Vasiliy Utkin was an active participant in international cooperation in space research and exploration, including the Interkosmos program: the Arcade project with the Aureole satellite was implemented jointly with French specialists; Aryabhata and Bhaskara satellites were built and launched into orbit in cooperation with India. A lot of the credit must go to Vasiliy Utkin for using decommissioned missiles to launch spacecraft (under the Dnepr program, etc.). Vasiliy Utkin is the author and co-author of more than 200 scientific studies: projects, articles, inventions. He took an active part in social life, management of the state affairs. He was repeatedly elected to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR (1972‚Äì1991); he was a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the USSR (1976-1991). Twice Hero of Socialist Labor (1969, 1976), winner of Lenin Prize (1964) and the USSR State Prize (1980). Utkin was decorated with the Medal for Labor Valor (1956), Order of the Red Banner of Labor (1959), Orders of Lenin (1961, 1966, 1969, 1973, 1976, 1983). Vasiliy Utkin rests in Troyekurovskoye cemetery, Moscow. The Golden and the Silver medal were established in memory of Vasiliy Utikin. Today, these medals are awarded to scientists and designers for outstanding achievements in aerospace technology development.
