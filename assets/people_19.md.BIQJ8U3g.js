The channel is about long and runs from Weurt (west of Nijmegen) to the south and ends at Heumen. The connection of the Meuse and the Maas‚ÄìWaal Canal is the tripoint between the provinces of Gelderland, Limburg and North Brabant.  History  Construction on the canal began in 1920. On 27 October 1927, the waterway was officially opened by HM Queen Wilhelmina. Before the canal was dug, ships had to make a detour of about to change from Heumen to Nijmegen to reach the German hinterland; the new route shortened the trip to ~. The consequences for the village of Heumen were unmistakable. It became isolated in a hard to reach corner between the Meuse and the canal. The village of Neerbosch was cut in half, and the centre of the village of Hatert was torn down to make room for a bridge across the canal. The village also lost its church and both pubs. In 1970, it was decided to widen the canal at an estimated cost of 117 million Dutch guilders (53 million euro). At around the same time, the city of Nijmegen decided to construct a new neighborhood, Dukenburg, on the far (Western) side of the canal. Less than 10 years later, another neighborhood, Lindenholt, was added in the area where the older part of Neerbosch had been. This left the canal lying largely inside the built-up area of Nijmegen. In 2002, H. van Eeuwijk and G. J. Nillesen published their booklet Three-quarter Century of Maas‚ÄìWaal Canal 1927‚Äì2002 on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the connection between the Maas and Waal.  Water level  Maas and the Maas‚ÄìWaal Canal near Heumen Although the canal is located entirely in Gelderland, the management is in the hands of Rijkswaterstaat directorate Limburg. There is a lock in Weurt, and another one in Heumen, but the latter is almost always open. This is because the water of the Maas at Heumen is maintained at a constant level through a weir in Grave. In 2007 and 2008 several bridges were jacked up by , so the water level in the channel could be increased. This allowed container ships with four layers of containers to use of the canal.City of Nijmegen ‚Äì Bridges over Maas‚ÄìWaal Canal jacked up Raising the water level in the canal will lead to higher groundwater levels in areas directly adjacent to the canal. Rijkswaterstaat will construct a drainage system to prevent possible negative consequences.

Early history Dollar was born in 1917 in a small town outside Saint John, New Brunswick as the first and only son for a young fisherman who died the same day Dollar was born. As brother to 14 younger half-siblings (although two died during childhood), Dollar would often listen to American radio thanks to a neighbor who would open the window so the children could listen. One night while listening to the radio, Dollar heard a sermon preached by British evangelist Gypsy Smith and immediately trusted in Jesus Christ for his salvation. He was ordained to the gospel ministry in 1942 by the Second Baptist Church of Newton, Massachusetts, and also pastored Bethany Baptist Church of Madison, Georgia and State Street Baptist Church in Cayce, South Carolina. Education Dollar was a graduate of Gordon College and Gordon Divinity School. He received the Master of Theology degree in church history from Emory University and received a Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees from Boston University. he served as professor at Columbia Bible College, Chairman of the Department of Church History at Dallas Theological Seminary and Bob Jones University and vice-President of Piedmont Bible College.

On 4 February 1918 he was granted Royal Aero Club Aviator's Certificate No. 5703 and also confirmed in his rank. Payton was posted to No. 210 Squadron RAF as a Sopwith Camel fighter pilot in France in April 1918. His first success came on 20 May, when he drove down a German Albatros D.V fighter out of control over Menen, Belgium. The next day, with squadron mates Solomon Clifford Joseph and Albert Leslie Jones, he destroyed a German observation balloon at Pont Riquen. On 26 May, another Albatros D.V fell under his guns. The following day, he and Lawrence Coombes, drove down a Pfalz D.III fighter over Bailleul. On 1 June 1918 he and Coombes shared in the destruction of a German two-seater reconnaissance aircraft, and Payton joined Coombes as an ace. On 15 June, Payton drove down an Albatros D.V out of action.

Snapper is a rather scrawny, barefoot, troll child from a forest filled of magic creatures. He is generally pretty disliked by just about everyone in the forest due to the constant pranks he plays on anyone he comes across. He is very cunning (although he might seem dumb, as he cannot even count to two!). He is also a master at every kind of music instrument he learns the basics off (He learned to play violin like a pro just like \\"Snap!\\"), but favours the flute. While he generally doesn't care about the consequences of his actions, he often resolves bad situations he played a part in instigating. He has a little troll named Willy Wee living in his hat. He has a really big ego. Unlike the other trolls, Snapper goes barefoot.  Tumbler  Voiced by Cathy Weseluck. Tumbler is a fat little troll child. He is rather dull and mostly just tags along with Snapper, agrees with him, when he compliments himself, and takes part in his pranks. He is rather shy.

Huldra is the laughing stock of her tribe, being kinda clumsy (while still being just as agile as any other vittling), and short-thinking sometimes, as well as being one of Snappers main targets for pranks. She yearns to prove that she can be just as good a hunter as the adult Vittlings (though she is a kid). She seems to have some kind of liking for Snapper, as she enjoyed kissing him just to see his reaction, as well getting pretty jealous when a mermaid flirted with him.  Scuttlebutt  Huldra's pet moose/elk. He is very gluttonous and has a sweet tooth. He is also rather dumb.  Trollmum  A troll woman who desperately wants children and will even steal human children.

The mission of the foundation is to raise research funds for Dravet's syndrome and related epilepsies, while providing support to affected individuals and families. The Dravet Syndrome Foundation is listed as a research and support organization on National Organization of Rare Diseases's (NORD) database.  History  The Dravet Syndrome Foundation was founded by parents with the purpose of expediting research to find a cure and better treatments for their afflicted children. It was established in the state of Connecticut and was designated a tax-exempt public charity in the United States in September 2009 by the Internal Revenue Service under Section 501(c)3.  Programs  The Dravet Syndrome Foundation focuses its work in four areas: Research Grants; Research Roundtable; International Ion Channel Epilepsy Patient Registry (IICEPR); and the International Patient Assistance Grant (PAG) Program.  Research Grant & Postdoctoral Fellowship Program  Grants are offered for research projects and postdoctoral fellowships directly related to Dravet syndrome and associated epilepsies. These grants fund initial research hypotheses that have not been fully explored. The results extracted from this type of research will help bring untested research to the point that it can qualify for larger governmental funding. Research applications are judged principally on novelty of the hypotheses, innovative approaches with a direct relevance and application to Dravet syndrome and related conditions, scientific quality, strength of approach, and likelihood of success.  Research Roundtable  This annual meeting allows researchers, geneticists, neurologists, and other professionals with a strong interest in Dravet syndrome and related epilepsies to establish a ‚Äúresearch roadmap‚Äù. By allowing this consortium of specialists to establish a plan, the Dravet Syndrome Foundation can facilitate the development and implementation of better treatments by funding research projects that address the critical challenges of this syndrome and which will offer the most promising breakthroughs at the fastest pace possible. This meeting takes place each year just prior to the commencement of the American Epilepsy Society (AES) Conference. DSF Biennial Family & Professional Conference This 3-day event is designed to unite all groups committed to improving the lives of those with Dravet syndrome ‚Äì including families, caregivers, clinicians, researchers and professionals in the pharmaceutical industry. There are speaker presentations on the latest advances in research as well as sessions with up to date information impacting patient care. This event allows the opportunity to foster new relationships and collaborations, both for families and professionals. It is held on even-numbered years at locations across the U.S.  International Ion Channel Epilepsy Patient Registry (IICEPR)  This registry (co-funded with ICE Epilepsy Alliance) is owned by University of Michigan Neurology Department and Miami Children's Hospital Brain Institute but is available to all interested researchers. It will collect basic information and genetic test results of individuals with Dravet syndrome and related epilepsies worldwide. The establishment of this registry will expedite future clinical trials and will serve to improve communication of ideas amongst interested researchers, as well as assure rapid distribution of any new information that may benefit patients and their families.  International Patient Assistance Grant (PAG) Program  This program offers grants to patients with Dravet syndrome and associated epilepsies for necessary medical equipment needs associated with these conditions that are not covered through private insurance or other assistance programs. angel/2078610.aspx  Advisory Boards  The Dravet Syndrome Foundation‚Äôs Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) oversees the organization‚Äôs research activities. They review and approve all research grant applications and meet annually with other interested researchers and scientists to discuss innovative and promising research in the field of Dravet syndrome and associated epilepsies at DSF‚Äôs Research Roundtable.  Fundraising  In addition to private donations, private fundraising events, corporate sponsorships and grants, the Dravet Syndrome Foundation produces annual fundraising events. City Bash is the Dravet Syndrome Foundation's annual signature event where money is raised for research while honoring a professional who has gone above and beyond in the field of Dravet syndrome and related epilepsies. Steps Toward A Cure consists of family-friendly fundraising walks across the U.S, organized by families. Race for Research allows athletes to participate in an event of their choosing, while raising funds for DSF.  Delegations  In 2011, a group of parents formed a delegation of the Dravet Syndrome Foundation in Spain (DSF Spain). Both organizations work closely together, but have separate Boards of Directors and Scientific Advisory Boards. DSF Spain announced its first research grant award in Summer 2011.  Partner Organizations  The Dravet Syndrome Foundation works with the following like-minded organizations to assure rapid distribution of information and to avoid duplication of efforts and research dollars. * CURE - Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy *Dravet Italia Onlus *Dravet Syndrome UK *Dravet Syndrome Foundation Spain *ICE Epilepsy Alliance  Research Projects Funded by the Dravet Syndrome Foundation  The Dravet Syndrome Foundation (DSF) was established in 2009 to increase research for Dravet syndrome. Their strategy has been to invest in researchers with $50,000-150,000 grants for 1-2 year projects, with the hope that they will use those preliminary studies to apply for larger NIH grants, establishing their place in the field of epilepsy research and DS in particular. Since its inception in 2009, DSF has awarded over $3.6M in research grants and postdoctoral fellowships. In the 8 years prior to DSF‚Äôs founding, from 2002-2009, NIH spent only $6.3 million on projects mentioning Dravet syndrome (DS) or Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy of Infancy (SMEI). Only about 30 studies were published on DS. In the 8 years since DSF‚Äôs founding, from 2010-2017, NIH spent $44.6 million on projects mentioning DS or SMEI, or 7x the research dollars. Over 300 studies were published on DS. There was an explosion of federal dollars spent on DS between 2010 and 2014, when DSF was first raising awareness and funding in the research world while investing in researchers. Of the 19 researchers DSF invested in through 2015, 6 of them went on to receive large NIH grants, for a return rate of 32%. Research Awards can be broken down in the following categories for total funding of $3,698,000: SUDEP - $300,000; Gene Therapy - $703,000; Drug Discovery, Screening, or Treatment - $1,063,000; Genetics - $714,000; Epidemiology -$273,000; Neuronal Network - $345,000; Other - $300,000  See also  *Severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy *Epileptic seizure  References External links * Website * Organizational video overview * Guidestar listing Category:Health charities in the United States Category:Organizations established in 2009 Category:Neurology organizations Category:Charities based in Connecticut Category:Medical and health organizations based in Connecticut ","title":"Dravet Syndrome Foundation"},{"id":"31569638","text":"Interior of the church. Photo by Paolo Monti, 1973. San Michele in Bosco is a religious complex in Bologna, central Italy, including the church with the same name and the annexed Olivetan monastery.

The complex in a 1954 postcard. Religious center Located on a hill not far from the city's historical center, the area housed monastic structures as early as the 4th century AD. As was typical for shrines on remote sites or mountain tops, it was dedicated to the Archangel Michael. Tradition holds that the cenobitic community here was dispersed by the Goths in the early 5th century. After reforming, it was again destroyed by the Hungarian invasions of 906. Slowly recovering habitation, by 1107 it had begun to house Augustinian monks. Documents from 1120 and 1204 refer to this monastery.Indicazione storico-artistica delle cose spettanti alla Villa Legatizia di San Michele in Bosco, by Luigi Arze, page 12. Between 1348 and 1359, the combination of plague and the occupation of the town by the Visconti, depopulated the monastery. The site often became a fortress defending the town. Olivetan monks may have played a role in the monastery by the mid 14th-century, however the fortunes of the site were adverse. In the 1540s, it was partially occupied by Spanish armies of the Holy Roman Emperor. Only after almost two centuries of much neglect, in 1564 the papal legate Cardinal Androvino della Rocca, formally consigned the monastery to the order of Monte Oliveto.Arze, page 15. Over the next two centuries, the monastery flourished as a host a number of schools of learning and music. The large complex was expropriated in 1797 during the Napoleonic occupation of the state. The monks were expelled and the structure was used as a barrack. In 1804, it was used as a prison (\\"house of strength\\") for those sentenced to life imprisonment.Arce, page 47-48. In 1838, Franciscan friars were brought to the site. After the church was destroyed in 1430, they rebuilt it in different period, mostly finishing it by 1523. Gaspare Nadi was one of those who did work on it. The church has a Renaissance-style fa√ßade designed by Biagio Rossetti and his workshop. The marble portal (1521) was designed by Baldassarre Peruzzi, and sculpted by Giacomo da Ferrara and Bernardino da Lugano.Arce, page 53. The interior has a nave with four side chapels, and a presbytery. The convent was finished in the late 16th century.

Biology of the species=Morphology Adults are usually long, cylindrical and robust, black or brownish-black. Elytral declivity is slightly shiny, with 4 teeth on each margin side. The third tooth is the biggest and club like on its top. The egg is yellowish-white. The larva is white and legless. The pupa is also white. Life cycle and interactions Bark beetles are so named because they reproduce in the inner bark, living and dead phloem tissues, of trees. Adult beetles hibernate in forest litter and host trees when environmental conditions are not favorable for reproduction. When conditions are right, they travel up to half a mile in search of a vulnerable host. Once the host is located, the adult burrows through the weakened bark in order to build tunnels where they can mate and lay eggs. They release pheromones to attract more individuals to the host tree. Two to five weeks after contamination, they may migrate to another host and repeat the process. Once the larvae hatch, they feed and pupate under the bark. Up to three generations are produced per year. Bark beetles communicate with one another using semiochemicals, compounds or mixtures that carry messages. Some electrophysiological and behavioral statistics show that bark beetles can not only sense olfactory signals directly from other bark beetles, but also some compounds from trees. It is also possible that beetles are attracted to the pheromone ipslure. They are also thought to be attracted to ethanol, one of the byproducts of microbial growth in dead woody tissues. Bark beetles can form a symbiotic relationship with certain Ophiostomatales fungi. These phloem-feeding bark beetles use phloem-infesting fungi as an addition to their diet. Dispersal ability European bark beetles have the ability to spread quickly over large areas. Some scientists hypothesize that long-distance movements originating from the Iberian Peninsula may have contributed to their invasion of northern Norway spruce forests. Movements like this can happen when various environmental factors such as severe storms, drought, or mass fungal infections damage or kill host trees. Trees in the genera Picea (spruce), Abies (fir), Pinus (pine), and Larix (larch) are the bark beetles' trees of choice. The most recent spruce bark beetle invasive outbreaks are found mainly in fallen, diseased or damaged Norway spruce. Healthy trees use defenses by producing resin or latex, which might contain several insecticidal and fungicidal compounds that kill or injure attacking insects. However, under outbreak conditions, the beetles can overwhelm the tree's defenses. Though it specializes on Norway spruce, it is not found throughout the tree's range. It may not be able to persist in the northernmost spruce forests due to inadequate climatic oscillations. Other researchers argue that the beetle populations that have evolved in such regions have an active, directed host searching ability and are not equipped for long-range dispersal. Impact Gallery in wood Ecological The European spruce bark beetle has a significant impact on both the ecological and economic environment of Norway spruce forests. Together with storm events, bark beetle outbreaks are thought by some to be one of the most important natural disturbances in this region. Some scientists consider this beetle to be a keystone species, in part because it has an unusually high number of relationships with other organisms in the community and because it changes its environment so drastically. Outbreak species, in general, assist in the renewal of the forest. Spruce beetles are detritivores. They feed on and break down dead plant matter, returning essential nutrients to the ecosystem. Also, they further the evolution of stronger, more resistant trees by instigating a range of adaptations to ward off their attacks. Economical The bark beetles of the Norway spruce forests are associated with various types of fungi, who each have different basic ecological roles. Several fungal pathogens can be transmitted to spruces by the invasive beetles. One of the most damaging is a species of blue stain fungus, Ophiostoma polonicum, which can kill healthy trees by hindering the upward flow of water, wilting its foliage. It also stains the wood with blue streaks, which destroys its commercial value. The results of such beetle outbreaks could be devastating for the lumber industry in that area because of the amount of time required for natural regression to take place. When this cycle affects the lumber industries by attacking spruce tree farms, they become known as serious pests. Detection Spruce beetles usually infest the lower and middle parts of trunks. Trees that have been attacked are easy to recognize by concentrations of brown dust from bark at the basal areas of stems and trunks. However, sometimes apparently infected trees with green crowns can be without bark because of larval and woodpecker activity. Other common ways that infection can be detected is the presence of red-brown dust (frass) in bark crevices, many round exit holes, or small pitch tubes extruding from the bark. Large populations can be detected from a distance by patches of red foliage. Conservation Interventions for beetle outbreaks are controversial in locations such as the ≈†umava National Park in the Bohemian Forest of the Czech Republic. Some authorities suggest that outbreaks be allowed to run their course, even at the expense of most of the forest. Others, including the lumber industry, request intervention. Some experts argue that salvage logging tends to have a greater negative effect on the vegetation than the bark beetle outbreak alone. A study of the effects of forestry interventions on the herb and moss layers of infested mountain spruce forests suggest that without intervention the forests do eventually recover. Salvage logging also had negative effects on the composition of species, delaying recovery. Prevention and control methods Several methods have been proposed to prevent the start of beetle outbreaks. Some suggest using ‚Äútrap trees‚Äù at the beginning of each reproductive cycle. This should be done in March, May, and in late June or early July. The trap trees should be debarked when distinct larval galleries with small larvae are found. Another method is clearcutting, removing sections of trees at the first signs of infestation. Pheromone traps can be used. Removal of attractive material, such as logs with bark, weakened trees, and windthrow, may help prevent outbreaks.

Renown internationally during her lifetime for her unconventional approach to Orientalism, Henriette Browne specialized in genre scenes that represented the Near East in a less sensationalized, albeit still exotic, manner than her contemporaries. Her sex, social position, and influence from her mother were pivotal to her development as an artist. While many of her works have been lost to time; those that remain are a testament to the skill and sensibility of a painter who has largely been overlooked by history. Personal life Sophie de Bouteiller was born in Paris on June 16, 1829, to the Comte de Bouteiller and his wife. Her father was an amateur musician and her mother an accomplished singer. Browne attained a privileged position in society because of her father, who descended from an old Breton Family. Sophie's mother was widowed at a young age prior to becoming the Comtesse de Bouteiller, and for a time gave music lesson to support herself and her son from this previous marriage. For this reason, the Countess encouraged Sophie to pursue an education in the arts from a young age: in the event that she have the need to economically sustain herself. She insisted that Sophie study music and drawing, and she was homeschooled by the Countess and other tutors in their Paris home. In 1849, Sophie decided to pursue more serious study in drawing by becoming a pupil of Monsieur Emile Perrin, who later became the director of Theater-Francais. In 1851, Sophie entered Monsieur Charles Joshua Chaplin‚Äôs class for female artists. Here she had the opportunity to study from live models, gaining indispensable knowledge on the depiction of body proportions and movements. Between 1851 and 1853, Sophie adopted the pseudonym Henriette Browne, the name of her maternal grandmother. In 1853, under her newly chosen pseudonym, Browne submitted her first work to the Paris Salon, where she exhibited regularly until 1878, the year before her husband's death. With this pseudonym, Browne sought to keep her professional and personal life separate. Furthermore, by distancing herself from her artistic career, Browne wished to preserve her social standing, as it was not deemed appropriate at the time for a lady to also be a professional artist. Henriette Browne married Monsieur Henry Jules de Saux, a French diplomat and secretary of Count Walewski, in 1853. Browne accompanied her husband on the many trips that his job required, traveling extensively to places such as Italy, Holland and Constantinople. These voyages proved to be vital to her artistic formation, exposing Browne to new environments. The trip to Constantinople was of particular importance, as it was during this trip that she visited a Turkish harem, gaining firsthand experience on what this private space was truly like. It is believed that this experience contributed to the unique manner in which she would later portray the Orient in her paintings and engravings. By 1879 Browne had largely given up exhibiting, and could look back upon a productive career as an internationally sought genre and Orientalist artist. She became an honorary member of London's Royal Institute of Painters in Watercolours in 1894. Henriette Browne had a successful career as an artist and although many of her works are untraced, the surviving works in private collections testify to her popularity. Today, her paintings offer an intervention into the type of 19th century Orientalism that largely catered to and reaffirmed the status of the dominating male gaze. She died in 1901 in Paris. Early career and work Browne's early work consisted of portraiture, domestic genre scenes, and French religieuse. Her capacity for realism was evident at the beginning of her career. Browne was a naturalistic artist, who had a reputation for painting from observable fact. She became known for her boldness with which she depicted genre scenes. Their scale, realism, and frontal figure presentation were unusual characteristics for the time. Browne first appeared at the Paris Salon of 1853. She exhibited Lecture de la Bible, a painting of an old woman reading a heavy Bible on her lap. She received moderate success and drew the attention of an art critic who was well known in both French and English art circles. After striking up a rapport with Browne, he was invited to her studio to view more of her work. The visitor was immediately able to discern that her Parisian studio was adorned with a level of taste and luxury that did not equate to the sale of her artworks, which at that time were selling for around 500 francs. After witnessing her skill, the collector decided to purchase the works he has previously discussed as well as the promise to purchase more works in the future. He then submitted these works and others to future Salons which accrued around 7,000 francs. She next exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in 1855, where she immediately became a success. All five of her paintings were sold including Ecole de Pauvres a Aix purchased by Emperor Napoleon. The art dealer Ernest Gambart saw her work at the Exposition and promoted her at the French Gallery in London. From 1857 to 1859, Browne received more success. Empress Eugenie bought her work Les Puritaines for 6,000 francs from her five exhibited paintings in 1859. One of her other five contributions that year, Les Soeurs de Charit√©, was particularly successful and won her a third class medal. Les Soeurs de Charit√© was a large painting portraying two nuns tending a sick child. The work caused a sensation only second to Rosa Bonheur's paintings and was purchased for 12,000 francs. Charles Kingsley described the painting as a perfect combination of realism and naturalism. Also in 1859, an exhibition of her work was held at the French Gallery in Pall Mall. The exhibition was well reviewed with the principal characteristic of her work being ‚Äúrealistic simplicity‚Äù. As opposed to Rosa Bonheur, Browne was viewed as a model of femininity and her paintings as expressions of womanly virtue. Many of her early genre scenes focused on the subjects of religion and/or children. Her early works often contained themes of pathos and sentiment. There were three other key characteristics to her paintings. First, her paintings were often extremely large for genre scenes and her figures were placed toward the front of the picture. Second, certain aspects recalled elements of Dutch art from the 17th century. These aspects included her division of the receding plane and the centralization of light in her interiors. Lastly, her work contained realism. While her paintings were creations of her mind, all the elements and details were borrowed from real life. One review of her work in Woman's English Journal stated ‚Äúshe observes, combines, and reproduces‚Ä¶every detail is copied from Nature‚Äù. Additionally, Browne was a professional engraver. She was the first to make steel engravings of Alexandre Bida‚Äôs work, which consisted of Eastern and scriptural drawings. She took the liberty of making alterations in her copies, such as removing objects, lightening the clothing, and ‚ÄúOrientalizing‚Äù the scene. Orientalism The nineteenth century saw a dramatic increase in Orientalist fascination, particularly in France and Great Britain. Henriette Browne exhibited numerous Orientalist paintings in the 1860s, and during this period, enjoyed a time of travel and success. In 1862, she was one of three women listed as founder-members of the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Browne traveled to Turkey in 1860, Morocco in 1864, and Egypt and Syria during the winter of 1868-1869. During these travels, which were enabled by diplomatic and royal connections, Browne focused her art on more Eastern subjects, especially school scenes. Her first Orientalist subjects exploded onto the French art scene in 1861, when she exhibited two paintings at the Paris Salon: Une Visite and Une Joueuse de Flute. These two paintings, possibly Browne's most famous works, are progressive paintings of the Oriental harem in Constantinople. In these images, women greet visitors and listen to music. They are shown performing everyday activities as opposed to being undressed, smoking, or catering to men. After these paintings, Browne turned her attention largely to the subjects of schools and children, in the Orientalist fashion. By the 1870s, her reputation was well established and she was given a distinguished position among Orientalist painters. Henriette Browne's work would soon become a touchstone for all subsequent female Orientalist painters. Henriette Browne was most famous for her subjects of Eastern harems and convents. In her paintings, the harem is shown as a space for social interaction among women as opposed to a space of sexual pleasure for men. She represented female labor, sexuality, and space, and prioritized the female gaze. Because of her female gender, Browne was able to personally interact with the Eastern harem and its inhabitants, witness the gender politics that governed the harem, and depict the interaction among women in the harem that other male artists could not. Representations of the Eastern harem by male artists were largely based on fantasy as men could not enter these womanly spaces, therefore their sexuality was exaggerated to conform to male fantasies. Her ability to visit a harem allowed her to paint harem scenes differently than men. She does not objectify the women, but rather presents a calm and controlled domestic space, excluded men from the scenes, and painted with a more subdued color palette (Inge 13). Browne's greatest contribution was that she debunked cultural and sexual myths about the harem as she desexualized and domesticated the site. Browne's paintings were uncontroversial in terms of style and were truthful representations of female community that broke with male Orientalist tradition. Reception of work Browne's paintings had popular appeal. Her work fetched high prices and attracted influential patrons such as Emperor Napoleon III and Empress Eug√©nie in the 1850s. Her paintings were well received in Britain and France, although her genre scenes had greater importance in Britain and her Orientalist paintings held higher praise in France. Browne's works were celebrated, as they broke with the male Orientalist tradition but were also uncontroversial in terms of style. The artist's reputation among critics as a serious artist was never under threat. Britain Browne's early genre scenes of nuns and children were exceedingly popular in Britain despite the widespread anti-Romanism at the time. After its success at the Paris Salon of 1859, her painting Les Soeurs de Charit√© was shown in London, where it was identified as a masterpiece. The painting commenced her successful reputation in Britain. The English liked the painting especially for its strong moral message; it showed extreme pathos and sentiment, which allowed the viewer to feel sympathetic as these nuns care for a child. In reference to this painting, Charles Kingsley upheld her technique as one between idealists and realists. He commented on her paintings‚Äô realist style and feminine vision. To him and other English art enthusiasts, a person who can paint scenes of moral value must be of good moral stature him or herself. It was not about her gender, but rather her technique and the moral content of her works. The article on Browne in the English Woman's Journal in 1860 further enhanced her reputation. The article portrayed Browne as a professional artist and a good wife and mother. It stressed her position as a diplomat's wife without compromising her aptitude and attentiveness as an artist. The article also went into further detail on her paintings. In 1859, she also had her own exhibition at the French Gallery in Pall Mall owned by Gambart, who continued to exhibit her work years after. By 1860, at least eight of her works had been purchased by the English. The British interest in her genre paintings far exceeded the interest in her Orientalist works. While Orientalist subjects were popular in Britain, the British tradition of Orientalism was more typified by archeological landscapes and topographical paintings compared to French Orientalist paintings. Therefore, only a moderate interest was expressed in Britain for her Orientalist paintings. France Browne became well established in France as well. In 1855, she exhibited five works at the Exposition Universelle, all of which were sold. In 1855 and 1857 Browne was awarded third-class medals for painting at the Paris Salon. While her early paintings proved to be highly successful and were well received and established her as an artist, they weren't significant enough to allow her to excel in the genre of French religious painting. Her later fame was more closely attributed to her Orientalist paintings. Browne's first Orientalist subjects exploded onto the French art scene in 1861. The two paintings called Interiors immediately received critical coverage. This was the first and last time she painted this type of scene. After these two paintings, she continued to produce Orientalist subjects of children, schools, scholars, and individuals of Oriental society. Her Orientalist paintings continued to be popular in France throughout her lifetime.

Widely recognized examples of Melodic Learning include using the alphabet song to learn the alphabet and This Old Man to learn counting.  Overview  In 2004, Dr. Susan Homan, Dr. Robert Dedrick and then doctoral student, Marie C. Biggs of the University of South Florida's College of Education began researching the use of a non-standard approach to reading remediation that used repeated singing of grade leveled songs with struggling, middle school readers. When the results of their pilot study as well as further research over the following five years consistently showed significant gains, Dr. Homan, et al. began searching the literature for an explanation as to why this non-traditional approach was effective. After reviewing recent findings in the fields of literacy, neuroscience and anthropology, Dr. Homan, in collaboration with Dr. Eliot Levinson, identified this use of repeated singing to accelerate learning as a form of, \\"Melodic Learning\\". Dr. Homan posits that other forms of Melodic Learning include the singing of hymns in organized religions and the use of oral tradition to pass on important information from generation to generation in pre-literate societies  Multi-media Learning Theory  Melodic learning combines melody with visual imagery to enhance learning. Melodic learning is an extension of Multimedia Learning Theory because it focuses specifically on the addition of music to learning. Research indicates that multiple types of media have positive effects on a learner however, multimedia learning can encompass as few as two senses whereas melodic learning explores how music embeds learning deeper into the human brain. The neuroscience about how music affects learning is a relatively new area of research. Music is a part of every known culture including in the very distant past. Dr. Patel‚Äôs research links music to linguistics, to early learning, to language learning, and to literacy learning. Music engages all of the following brain functions: * Emotion * Memory * Learning and Plasticity * Attention * Motor control * Pattern perception * Imagery  Multiple Modalities  Learning with Sesame Street on the television is an example of melodic learning. Through Sesame Street, young children experience and advance emergent literacy processes through poems, jingles, chants, word games and singing songs. Several of the principles of literacy learning interact. Rhyming and singing are high-level multi-modal interactions of visual, auditory/aural, and kinesthetic modalities. Rhythmic and tonal processing also contribute to the success of this learning process. Jumping rope is an example of melodic learning. Tonal, rhythmic, aural and visual elements interplay as children sing and rhyme. The rope‚Äôs motion supplies the kinesthetic element to enhance the process. This may explain why many children learn jump rope rhymes faster and retain them longer than they do for many of their classroom lessons. A combination of five specific modalities or Learning styles affect how a child learns while playing or while watching Sesame Street or jumping rope: *Aural - The child says, hears and processes audio content as he listens to Grover singing a song on Sesame Street. *Visual ‚Äì The child sees and processes the images of Grover and what he is singing about. *Kinesthetic learning‚Äì The child is animated, possibly singing, while processing the audio and visual content from Grover‚Äôs song. *Rhythmic ‚Äì As the melody and accompaniment to the song are played, the child feels both the rhythm of the song and the rhythm of the language. This feeling of the rhythm can lead to kinesthetic involvement. *Tonal ‚Äì The child feels the beat of the music (rhythm) and is often moved to sing along. Singing encourages the child to modulate her tone as she tries to follow the tune of the melody. Tone or pitch helps transmit the meaning. The integration of these modalities creates more powerful and permanent measurable learning outcomes and can accelerate learning, especially struggling learners. Neuroscience evidence Melodic learning appears to derive its effectiveness from the special nature of music and singing's activity pattern in the human brain. A series of books published in the 2000s by noted neuroscientists document the unique relationship between music and our brains, including Musicophilia by Oliver Sacks, This Is Your Brain On Music by Daniel Levitin, and Music, Language, and the Brain by Aniudh Patel. History An earworm is a portion of a song that repeats itself inside one's head. As recently as 2005, researchers discovered that the earworm is engraved in the auditory cortex and instantly retrieved. Industrial psychologists have made good use of this link between music and learning by creating catchy jingles to sell products. More recently earworms are being used in training products. Nearly every civilization uses music to share information. Australia‚Äôs aboriginal tribesmen used songs to detail complex routes to important places. Although this was not a feat of memory alone and that rock art serve as tangible manuscripts for these musicians. In Africa, drums were used to communicate. Throughout Europe roving minstrels and troubadours sang ballads retelling the news and politics of the day. In churches, temples and mosques, chanted prayers etch religious words into memory. The connection between music and learning runs deep inside the brain. The patterns reinforce each other resulting in a greater learning effect. Adults and children can recognize a wrong note in a simple melody. If one note of the simple five-note opening to The Star-Spangled Banner is played incorrectly, those who‚Äôve heard the song before can instantly recognize that it is wrong. Westerners recognize standard chord progressions that are ‚Äúwrong‚Äù even though they have never heard them before. Researchers link the phenomena of identifying the wrong note and identifying the wrong word (syntactically) to the same part of the brain, thereby demonstrating how music and words are intertwined.

Early life Tillou was born circa 1795. His family was said to have been descended from Pierre Tillou, a Huguenot who fled Saint-Nazaire, France in 1681. Career In August 1835, the Federal Land Office at Green Bay put up for sale the area which would become Madison, Wisconsin, and on October 7, 1835, Tillou bought the first 100 acres. Tillou lived at a country estate which he named \\"Tillietudlem\\", in a place then known as Pleasant Valley in Hackensack Township, Bergen County, New Jersey. The house stood where now the Edgewater Public Library is located, at the corner of Undercliff and Hudson Ave. in Edgewater, New Jersey. On March 1, 1849, Tillou was granted the right to run a ferry-boat service from his estate's landing on the Hudson River to New York City. The landing was located approximately at the place of the present-day Edgewater Marina and Ferry Stop. He ran a law practice with Francis B. Cutting (1804‚Äì1870), known as Tillou & Cutting. Public service In November 1851, Tillou was elected on the Democratic ticket Recorder of New York City, and remained in office from 1852 until the end of 1854, serving under Mayors, Ambrose C. Kingsland and Jacob A. Westervelt. In November 1854, Tillou was nominated on the Municipal Reform and the Temperance tickets for re-election, but was defeated by James M. Smith, Jr. who had been nominated jointly by Hard and Soft Democrats, while most other offices were won by the Whigs, defeating the split Democrats. In November 1861, Tillou ran on the Union ticket (a fusion of Republicans and War Democrats) for the New York State Senate (4th D.) but was defeated by Democrat Christian B. Woodruff. Personal life On February 15, 1822, he married Caroline M. \\"Cara\\" Drake (ca. 1793).

History  The Becontree estate was the largest public housing project in the world when it was completed in the mid-1930s. Recognising the need for education but with no responsibility to provide it, the London County Council transferred 24 acres on the western edge of the estate to Essex County Council, who built a technical college (the South East Essex Technical College) and a secondary school (South East Essex County Technical High School) on the site. The College opened in 1936, in a building designed by J.Stuart. During World War II, the College was commandeered by the British Army and the Royal Air Force. The secondary school moved to a new site in Cannington Road in 1960 and was renamed the South East Essex Technical High School. The technical college was renamed Barking Regional College of Technology in 1965, following the creation of the London Borough of Barking. In 1969 it became the Barking Campus of the North East London Polytechnic, which in turn became the Polytechnic of East London in 1988 and the University of East London in 1992. In 2006 the campus was closed and sold for redevelopment by Taylor Wimpey. The agent for the sellers, being the University of East London, was Graham Bridgeman-Clarke of Bridgeman Clarke Chartered Surveyors, who coincidentally was a former pupil.

The paper is infused with essences, fragrances or essential oils in order to achieve a perfuming or cleansing effect. Examples of Armenian paper include Papier d'Arm√©nie, which is produced in France, and Carta d'Armenia, which is produced in Italy. History At the end of the 19th century, Auguste Ponsot discovered that Armenian households would burn Styrax as a fragrance and disinfectant. Ponsot adopted this habit, and, with the help of the pharmacist Henri Rivier, created his own recipe wherein benzoin resin was dissolved in alcohol then let to soak into blotting paper. The \\"alchemy\\" inherent in Papier d'Arm√©nie became a huge success with the emerging importance of hygiene from 1888‚Äì1889, and has been steadily produced in Montrouge, France since 1885. In 2006, during the Year of Armenia in France (Ann√©e de l'Arm√©nie en France), the celebrated French perfumer of Armenian origin Francis Kurkdjian gave his own recreation of the historical recipe.‚ÄúPapier d'Arm√©nie‚Äù, Arm√©nie, mon amie. Ann√©e de l'Arm√©nie en France, 21 septembre 2006 - 14 juillet 2007, p. 133. Use Sheets can be torn out for individual use Typically, a strip of Papier d'Arm√©nie is torn from the booklet, folded accordion-style, and placed on a heat-resistant support. The strip is lit and blown on until the paper begins to glow and release the vanilla scent characteristic of resin compounds. The smell is pleasant and subtle, underscoring its primary use as a \\"purifier\\". This belief began with the practice of burning Papier d'Arm√©nie on a bell set above a piece of raw meat, which would not rot by the end of a week (as normal meat almost certainly would). Today Papier d'Arm√©nie is sold primarily as a form of incense or perfume, or as a form of air freshener; strips tucked between the books of a library will keep the air from turning stale for much longer than a conventional product.

Biography Dissard was born in Tarbes, France, and grew up in the countryside near the French city of Toulouse before moving at the age of 16 to Mesa, Arizona in the United States following her parents. Dissard relocated to Los Angeles in 1989, briefly roommating to musician Howe Gelb while attending film school at the University of Southern California. Active in Los Angeles' independent film-making scene, she collaborated with directors Clay Walker (filmmaker) and Gregg Araki as well as French distribution company Haut Et Court with the selection of the \\"In√©dits d'Am√©rique\\" film series by Jon Jost, Allison Anders and Alex Cox. In 1994, Dissard arrived in Tucson, Arizona to direct a documentary on Howe Gelb's alt-Americana band Giant Sand. She remained in Tucson for nearly two decades, taking an increasingly active part in the city's music scene, from lyricist and muse, to full-fledged producer and performer with her own touring career. Her eleven-year marriage with French musician Na√Øm Amor ended in 2008. Dissard left Tucson and moved back to Europe in 2013. She has been based in Ramsgate, England since 2017, with one foot still in Tucson, Arizona and another in Paris, France. Creative life Dissard has collaborated with Tucson band Calexico's Joey Burns, who composed her first two albums: lo-fi demo debut 'Dedicated To Your Walls' (2006) and 'L'Entredeux' (2008), which he also produced. An album of bitter love songs, L'Entredeux won a Coup de Coeur prize from France's Acad√©mie Charles Cros in 2009 and was released in Europe by labels Le Pop Musik and Vacilando'68. Dissard's second album, L'Abandon (2011), also garnered worldwide accolades. Co-produced by BK-One, it tackled subject matters such as her hometown of Tucson, abortion, Mexican porn comic books and marriage. Third album The Cat. Not Me (2013) was co-written by Dissard and composer Sergio Mendoza of the Tucson mambo ensemble Orkesta Mendoza. Dealing with emotional and physical exhaustion, nightmares, addiction and botched connections, the nonetheless upbeat album premiered at SXSW in 2013, with Seattle producer/musician Budo and violinist Andrew Joslyn. The live studio album, 2009 Paris One Takes (City Series) (\\"a fantastic album\\") is the first in the ongoing Cities Series of albums recorded with band while on tours. Berlin Two Takes (City Series), the series' second album, was released in 2012 and included a duet with Belgian singer Arno. Third in the series, Cologne Vier Takes (City Series) was recorded in Germany in 2015 with guitarist Yan P√©chin and vocalist Allyson Ezell. A compilation album Cibola Gold: Best Of 2008-2015 was released in 2016, tracklisted by BK-One. Marianne Dissard has performed from Europe to North America, China as well as Turkey, New Zealand and Australia. Most notable live shows include those at The Museum of Modern Art in New York City in July 2010 and in Europe, at the Dortmund's KonzertHaus in 2010, but also a walking tour of the Pyr√©n√©es with donkey in 2010. Festival performances include New Zealand's Sounday in 2010, South By Southwest in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, Joshua Tree Roots Festival, USA (2010) and Split Works' Black Rabbit Festival in China (2011). As a documentary filmmaker, Marianne Dissard has collaborated with Tucson band Giant Sand and Howe Gelb on the music documentary 'Drunken Bees' (1996) and with artists Robbie Conal ('Post No Bills' (1993, co-producing credit), funded by ITVS/PBS), Robert Kramer on camera for French TV-funded film 'Low Y Cool' (2006) and Keja Kramer. Dissard's first fiction film, 'Lonesome Cowgirls', a remake of Andy Warhol's 'Lonesome Cowboys', was conceived as a conceptual companion piece to album 'L'Abandon' and shot in Tucson, Arizona over a strictly-timed 24hrs period in June 2010. Several music videos and short video pieces are also credited to Dissard, including collaborations with Orkesta Mendoza, Bones & Beeker and Amor Belhom Duo. Marianne Dissard's performance collaborations with American-born, Berlin-based choreographer Ami Garmon have been presented at Mus√©e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (exhibit Hiver de l'Amour by Purple Prose 1994), Fondation Cartier (1994), Galleries D'Art Contemporain de Marseille (in residency, 1994) and Videoteca de Lisbon (1994), Arte TV Lounge (2010), Dortmund Konzerthaus (2011), Zurich's Rote Fabrik (2011), Tanz Im August Festival in Berlin (2013).

Plot Oswald is playing piano in his apartment room, singing a swing song. Just then, a disturbed bear from another room comes in and confronts him. When the bear opens the door, he sternly drags Oswald off the piano, choking him while his fingers being stuck on keys, and tells Oswald to quit playing and ensure silence. Oswald hesitantly agrees to the demands. A moment later, a frog from a glass bowl jumps out and lands on some piano keys before leaping out of the scene. In this, the bear picks up the piano and tosses it out the window. Before the bruin leaves, Oswald is given a reminder. Hours later, Oswald receives a phone call. Speaking to him is a stray kitten who is a friend of his. The kitten is looking to come visit Oswald as well as bring in a pack of other stray kittens. Oswald rejects the offer because of the deal he made with his grumpy neighbor. Nevertheless, the stray kittens marched and jumped with joy (the movement of the jumping animation is mixed between 2 different frames of the jump, and a frame of the marching) on sidewalks and roads as one of the kittens in Walter Lantz's voice told the other strays to follow him. To Oswald's dismay, They jumped with joy and marched inside and begin rough-housing. They jump on beds while yelling \\"whoopie\\" (as they later broke the bed making bed bugs, gibberish in chipmunk voices scrambled out of the bed), perform acrobatics on chandeliers, catapult Oswald around with a blanket, and even one of the kittens opened Oswald's mouth by using his ears and another one puts an umbrella inside his mouth, making him acting like a balloon in the hallway. The umbrella was later hooked, and drags Oswald down to the ground making the umbrella come out of his mouth. As they are having their wild fun, one of them decides to play a prank on the bear by putting a clothes iron in the latter's trousers. Oswald tries to intervene but to no avail. The bear twitches in pain and frantically runs around before sitting in a bucket filled with water. Minutes afterward, one of the stray kittens plays a trombone. As the tiny cat performs, the slide of his instrument starts striking the ceiling, and its impact is felt by the bear who is bathing straight upstairs. Eventually, the floor of the bathroom crumbles and collapses. The bruin plummets to the floor below and figures this is the last straw. Learning that they are in hot water, Oswald and the stray kittens lock themselves in an apartment room. Immediately, the bear comes up with a successful method of sucking them all including a mouse waiter who is holding some food with a cover on a plate, and Oswald (acting like Oswald's tongue goes through his body) under the door using a vacuum cleaner. The bear removes the vacuum bag and dumps it outside where it opens automatically somehow. Although they are excluded, the stray kittens have had a good time and Oswald cannot believe it. And when the stray cats saw Oswald feeling dazed (moving his head all around in a circle), the stray cats sang Oswald's short theme and pointed to Oswald. Cast * Pinto Colvig as Oswald the Lucky Rabbit and the Bear * Walter Lantz as the stray kittens Publicity flaws The second edition of Jeff Lenburg's Encyclopedia of Animated Cartoons mistakenly mentions Hen Fruit as the working title for this short.

It was founded in March 2011 by Kevin Scannell, who does research in computational linguistics in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Saint Louis University in St. Louis, Missouri, United States. The website's purpose is to enable minority language speakers to communicate on the Internet. On its homepage, the website displays a list of minority languages it has cached. After selecting a language, the user is brought to a table of everyone who is tweeting in that language. Indigenous Tweets provides the profile picture of each Twitter user and statistics about each person's number of followers. In addition to providing statistics about the percentage of tweets a person writes in different languages, Indigenous Tweets has a selection of the trending topics in the various minority languages. History At the website's inception in March 2011, it cataloged 35 languages. On April 16, 2011, it recorded tweets in 76 minority languages. By April 26, 2011, the website supported 82. The cataloged languages include the \\"esoteric\\" Gamilaraay and the \\"better-known\\" Haitian Creole and Basque, which have the first and second most Tweeters, respectively. Welsh is ranked third on Indigenous Tweets. Kapampangan, which was ranked seventh in the last week of April 2011, was the first Philippine language supported by the website. Data mining Indigenous Tweets employs a data bank of words and phrases from the minority languages to locate people who speak those languages. In an April 2011 interview with BBC News, Scannell said that he has spent 8 years building a data bank of around 500 languages by reviewing blogs, newspapers, and websites. Indigenous Tweets gathers data through Twitter's API by searching a data bank of words and phrases from the minority languages. The website's search engine cannot decipher the language of a tweet when a word is in more than one language. To avoid this conundrum, Scannell inputs words that are unique to the language.

It was traditional Catholic in outlook, supporting the Tridentine Mass and critical of the European Union. It was founded as The Democrat in 1992 after the X Case. Shortly thereafter it changed its title to The Irish Democrat, which was later changed to The Irish Family to avoid confusion with the paper of the same name run by the Connolly Association. In its first years it was run by Dick Hogan, a Mullingar-based local newspaper proprietor and Catholic activist. It published a regular column on Marian devotion by the theologian Fr Michael O'Carroll. It was strongly hostile to European integration and supported attempts to establish an independent Catholic political party. Other contributors included Donna- Marie Cooper O‚ÄôBoyle and Ann-Marie Madden. Editor until early 2006 was Gerry McGeough, an IRA activist who until 2003 was on the Sinn F√©in executive, and who had spent a number of years in prison for various arms offences. He left to set up a new nationalist newspaper, The Hibernian. He was jailed in February 2011 for the shooting of an off-duty UDR soldier in 1981 and membership of the IRA.

This essentially made the city in charge of the assets used in the management of the river including: weirs (used to divert water from the river into a canal), floodgates, measuring stations, etc. At acquisition, almost all the assets in the river were in a state of disrepair. Some of the weirs were lined with boulders, others with sandbags. The first point of measurement was a cable across the river where a measuring device could be placed and the second point of measurement had completely washed away.Kern River Purchase. Bakersfield Department of Water Resources. December 2003. Page 17. Accessed: 04-22-2011. In 1977 the Department of Public Works, began a long term project which would rebuild all of the infrastructure. It would be the largest construction/reconstruction effort in the history of the Kern River. In addition to rebuilding existing infrastructure, other construction projects were carried out. These include constructing new weirs and the \\"2,800 Acre Water Bank\\", and inter-basin levee system. Most projects were completed in 1983, but the Second Point of Measurement was not finished until 1985. Wastewater Treatment Plant No. 3 expansion In the early 2000s, Bakersfield was nearing the capacity for wastewater treatment. The city had two plants, which were Treatment Plant No. 2 and Treatment Plant No. 3. At the time, Plant 3 had room for expansion. As a result, in 2004, plans were started for the doubling of the capacity of the plant, from per day to per day. It would become the largest project in Bakersfield's history (by capital dollars) at $234 million. An additional $3 million were spent on installation of solar panels to offset future energy cost. Some of the treated water from the plant will be used to irrigate the adjacent Bakersfield Sports Village.Wastewater Treatment Plant No. 3 Ribbon Cutting. Bakersfield Department of Public Works.

Westside Parkway Since 1980, California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has tried to construct a freeway through west Bakersfield which would eventually connect State Route 58 with Interstate 5. Named the Kern River Freeway, the project had opposition with the city over the eastern (SR 58) connection. Caltrans would drop the eastern connection and give the remaining segment to the city. Since that time, Caltrans has restarted the eastern segment while the city constructs the remaining freeway. The Westside Parkway is the largest freeway project undertaken by the city. It has a total estimated construction cost of $250 million, which would make it the city's largest construction project.Westside Parkway in Full Swing . KBAK - TV, Original Air Date: July 8, 2010. Web Site Accessed: 04-22-2011. It is a four to six-lane freeway on 8-lane right-of-way, constructed to Interstate standards. There will be five interchanges, four in the first construction phase. The project also includes a 1 3/4 arterial extension. The roadway will be six lanes and elevated over most of its route. Construction of the initial phase, which includes all but the last two miles (3 km) of freeway and one interchange, is expected to be completed by late 2012.Westside Parkway . Thomas Roads Improvement Program. Accessed: 04-22-2011. Thomas Roads Improvement Program In 2005, Bakersfield would receive an over $600 million earmark from the Federal Government for transportation projects throughout the city. In addition, both the state and local government would also contribute funds for other projects. Because of the size of many of the projects (several are typically carried out by state or federal agencies), it was decided to create a department specifically for the design and construction of the projects. The Thomas Roads Improvement Program (TRIP) was created for that purpose. It was named after Bill Thomas, the congressman responsible for obtaining the federal funds.History . Thomas Roads Improvement Program. Accessed: 03-31-2011 Between 2005 and 2018, the agency will be responsible for 10 projects and one route adoption.

There is an admission charge, and it is visited by over 25,000 people every summer between the months of May and September.  History  The Yukon Suspension Bridge was completed in 2006 by Surespan Construction Group. The bridge's initial estimated cost for construction was one million Canadian dollars but due to the remote location and limitations on building supplies upon completion costs grew to three million Canadian dollars. In 2011 the bridge was privately acquired and now is locally owned and operated.  Construction and Design  Due to the Yukon Suspension Bridge's isolated location there were challenges in the construction. The bridge was erected using galvanized steel cables, and required a helicopter to install the far side towers before it could be suspended over the river. This costly method was the only way to get the cables across because the other side of the canyon was completely inaccessible. Design of the interpretive areas and main building are done entirely in wood, since concrete is not available in these remote conditions where temperatures during winter reach -38¬∞ Celsius (-36.4¬∞ Fahrenheit).Kemp, Scott M.

He was possibly a son of Ljutovid, the strategos of Serbia (fl. 1039-1042). Life According to the Chronicle of the Priest of Dioclea (a dubious manuscript allegedly written at the turn of the 14th century), when Stefan Vojislav, the Grand Prince of Duklja, died, the lands were divided between his widow and five sons.The early medieval Balkans, p. 212; Byzantium's Balkan frontier, p. 139 Gojislav received the Trebinje region.

Mihailo I, the holder of Duklja (the crownland), and two of his brothers, led an attack into Travunia, capturing the murderers and giving \\"them a horrible death\\". Domanek fled the lands, and Saganek, another brother of Mihailo, succeeded as the rightful Prince of Travunia. Domanek returned shortly after Mihailo's departure, and expelled Saganek. Mihailo offered the office to Radoslav, who declined, afraid of losing Lu≈°ka ≈æupa (future Zeta). Radoslav perhaps distrusted his brother, thinking he would seize Zeta, but Mihailo seems to have offered him a deal.

At this time, the four remaining brothers made peace and established an alliance. The treaty concluded is the oldest in Serbian history. After the agreement, Radoslav attacked Trebinje, killing Domanek. Radoslav went on to conquer Zahumlje.

Mysorean rockets were an Indian military weapon, the first iron-cased rockets successfully deployed for military use. The Mysorean army, under Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan, used the rockets effectively against the British East India Company during the 1780s and 1790s. Their conflicts with the company exposed the British to this technology, which was then used to advance European rocketry with the development of the Congreve rocket in 1805.  Technology and deployment  There was a regular rocket corps in the Mysore Army, beginning with about 1,200 men in Hyder Ali's time. During the Second Anglo-Mysore War, Colonel William Baillie's ammunition stores are thought to have been detonated by a hit from one of Hyder Ali's rockets at the Battle of Pollilur (1780), which contributed to a humiliating British defeat. Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan deployed them effectively against the larger British East India Company forces during the Anglo-Mysore Wars. These missiles were fitted with swords and traveled hundreds of metres through the air before coming down with edges facing the enemy. The British took an interest in the technology and developed it further during the 19th century. The Mysore rockets of this period were much more advanced than what the British had seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant; this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missile (up to 2 km range). Rockets also existed in Europe, but they were not iron-cased and their range was far less than their South Asian counterparts.Biography, Mysore History Tipu These hammered soft iron rockets were crude, but the bursting strength of the container of black powder was much higher than the earlier paper construction, and a greater internal pressure was possible. These rockets were used with considerable effect against the British in battles at Srirangapatam in 1792 and 1799. Tipu Sultan wrote a military manual called Fathul Mujahidin in which 200 rocket men were assigned to each Mysorean cushoon (brigade). Mysore had 16 to 24 cushoons of infantry. The rocket men were trained to launch their rockets at an angle calculated from the diameter of the cylinder and the distance to the target. In addition, wheeled rocket launchers were used in war that were capable of launching five to ten rockets almost simultaneously. Rockets could be of various sizes but usually consisted of a tube of soft hammered iron about long and 1.5 to 3 in (3.8 to 7.6 cm) in diameter, closed at one end and strapped to a shaft of bamboo about long. The iron tube acted as a combustion chamber and contained well-packed black powder propellant. A rocket carrying about one pound (~500 gm) of powder could travel almost 1,000 yards (~900 m). In contrast, rockets in Europe could not take large chamber pressures, not being iron cased, and were consequently not capable of reaching such distances.Tipu, Biography, Mysore History The entire road alongside Jumma Masjid near City Market and Taramandalpet, Bangalore was the hub of Tipu's rocket project where he had set up a laboratory.  Use in Mysorean conflicts  A painting showing the Mysorean army fighting the British forces with Mysorean rockets. Use of rockets in an assault by Mysorean troops on Travancore Line fortification (29 December 1789) Rocket being lighted by Mysorean soldier (Illustration by Robert Home) Two rocket units were fielded by Tipu Sultan in 1792 during the Third Anglo-Mysore War, one of 120 men and the other of 131 men. Lt. Col. Knox was attacked by rockets near Srirangapatna on the night of 6 February 1792 while advancing towards the Kaveri River from the north. The Rocket Corps ultimately reached a strength of about 5,000 in Tipu Sultan's army. Mysore rockets were also used for ceremonial purposes. The Jacobin Club of Mysore sent a delegation to Tipu Sultan, and 500 rockets were launched as part of the gun salute. Rockets were again used on several occasions during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War. One of these involved Colonel Arthur Wellesley, later famous as the First Duke of Wellington. Wellesley was almost defeated by Tipu's Diwan Purnaiah at the Battle of Sultanpet Tope.Forrest D (1970) Tiger of Mysore, Chatto & Windus, London Wellesley launched a fresh attack with a larger force the following day, and took the whole position without losing a single man. Rocketeers worked their way around to the rear of the British encampment on 22 April 1799, 12 days before the main battle, and fired a great number of rockets at the same moment to signal the beginning of an assault by 6,000 Indian infantry and a corps of Frenchmen, all directed by Mir Golam Hussain and Mohomed Hulleen Mir Mirans. The rockets had a range of about 1,000 yards. Some burst in the air like shells, while others (called ground rockets) would rise again on striking the ground and bound along in a serpentine motion until their force was spent. A young English officer named Bayly observed: \\"So pestered were we with the rocket boys that there was no moving without danger from the destructive missiles\\". He continued: > The rockets and musketry from 20,000 of the enemy were incessant. No hail > could be thicker. Every illumination of blue lights was accompanied by a > shower of rockets, some of which entered the head of the column, passing > through to the rear, causing death, wounds, and dreadful lacerations from > the long bamboos of twenty or thirty feet, which are invariably attached to > them. A British shot struck a magazine of rockets within Tipu Sultan's fort during the conclusive British attack on Srirangapattana on 2 May 1799, causing it to explode and send a towering cloud of black smoke with cascades of exploding white light rising up from the battlements. Baird led the final attack on the fort on the afternoon of 4 May and was again met by \\"furious musket and rocket fire\\", but this did not help much; the fort was taken in about an hour's time. Perhaps within another hour Tipu had been shot (the precise time of his death is not known), and the war was effectively over.Narasimha Roddam (2 April 1985) Rockets in Mysore and Britain, 1750‚Äì1850 A.D., National Aeronautical Laboratory and Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore 560017 India, Project Document DU 8503,  British adoption of the technology  After the fall of Srirangapattana, 600 launchers, 700 serviceable rockets, and 9,000 empty rockets were found. Some of the rockets had pierced cylinders, to allow them to act like incendiaries, while some had iron points or steel blades bound to the bamboo. By attaching these blades to rockets they became very unstable towards the end of their flight causing the blades to spin around like flying scythes, cutting down all in their path. These experiences eventually led the Royal Woolwich Arsenal to start a military rocket research and development program in 1801, based on the Mysorean technology. Several rocket cases were collected from Mysore and sent to Britain for analysis. Their first demonstration of solid-fuel rockets came in 1805 and was followed by publication of A Concise Account of the Origin and Progress of the Rocket System in 1807 by William Congreve, son of the arsenal's commandant. Congreve rockets were systematically used by the British during the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812. They were also used in the 1814 Battle of Baltimore, and are mentioned in The Star Spangled Banner, the national anthem of the United States: And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air. Discovery In 2002, a cache of metallic shells was unearthed during restoration of an old well in Nagara, 60 kilometres from Shivamogga. About hundred of these rusted cylindrical shells were stored in Shivappa Nayaka Palace Goa Museum identified only as 'shells' and without being registered in museum catalog. In 2010 these shells were identified to have a possible link to Tipu's rockets. And only in 2013 these shells were recognized for their significance. In April 2017, 102 unused rockets of varying sizes were found in Shimoga district. In July 2018, another 500 rockets (or 1,000, according to one source) were found in an abandoned well in the same area, confirming it as a major repository and fort under the Tipu Sultan. , more than 3,000 such rockets have been recovered during debris clearances undertaken in Nagara.

Early life and education and career Sattar was born into a Sunni Muslim family in the multicultural and multireligious town of Tartus in 1958. He has a Degree in Economy and Trade (1980) and PhD in Islamic Studies (2000) from Damascus University.  Career  From 1985 until 2002 he was the Director of Religious Endowments and Mufti of Tartous Province. He was subsequently appointed Assistant Minister of Religious Endowments for Religious Affairs in 2002. In 2007 he became the Minister of Religious Endowments for Religious Affairs (Awqaf) of Syria. President Bashar al-Assad is a member of the Alawites sect of Shia Muslims who are in the minority yet form the elite of the military officers. They rule over the majority religious group the Sunni. When the Syrian uprising began in March 2011 Sattar was one of several Sunni who supported the regime. In July 2016 President Bashar al-Assad announced the make up of the new Syrian government in Decree no. 203 of 2016. Dr Mohammed Abdul-Sattar al-Sayyed retained his position. As minister he has participated in several conferences and delivered lectures. At the Kiwan mosque during the 2015 International Media Conference Against Terrorism Sattar spoke of the martyrs who have defended the faith in Syria in the war against Takfiri Terrorism. Sattar has been on the U.S.Department of the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List since 2012. This means their assets are blocked and United States citizens are not permitted to have dealings with them. He is also listed on the Consolidated list of Financial Sanctions Targets in the UK last updated 2 June 2016. The European Union also has \\"restrictive measures against Syria\\" and added Dr. Mohammad Abdul Sattar Al Sayed to the list of persons 16 October 2012 as he \\"shares responsibility for the regime‚Äôs violent repression against the civilian population.\\"  Contact with other religious groups in Syria  The religious majority in Syria are Sunni Muslims who are around 70% of the population while Christians are around 10%. Although Christians are a minority they have been politically influential and after the uprising many militant Christians supported Bashar al-Assad in the hope that this will offer some protection against Islamists coming to power. Sattar has worked with Christians to keep the lines of communications open and to encourage Christian support for the government and its aims. In March 2013 at the Preachers and Imans in the Middle and Coastal Regions Forum held in Tartous the Minister spoke of Christians and Muslims working together to spread tolerance and friendship. In June 2014 Sattar with a delegation of Muslim scholars visited the newly installed Patriarch of Antioch Mor Ignatius Aphrem II of the Syrian Orthodox Church. Both expressed the view that Muslims and Christians should cooperate and work together for peace. Personal life Sattar is married and has three children.

Somatic embryos are formed from plant cells that are not normally involved in the development of embryos, i.e. ordinary plant tissue. No endosperm or seed coat is formed around a somatic embryo. Cells derived from competent source tissue are cultured to form an undifferentiated mass of cells called a callus. Plant growth regulators in the tissue culture medium can be manipulated to induce callus formation and subsequently changed to induce embryos to form the callus. The ratio of different plant growth regulators required to induce callus or embryo formation varies with the type of plant.http://www.accessexcellence.org/LC/ST/st2bgplant.html Plant Tissue Culture Somatic embryos are mainly produced in vitro and for laboratory purposes, using either solid or liquid nutrient media which contain plant growth regulators (PGR‚Äôs). The main PGRs used are auxins but can contain cytokinin in a smaller amount.E.F. George et al. (eds.), Plant Propagation by Tissue Culture 3rd Edition, 335-354. Shoots and roots are monopolar while somatic embryos are bipolar, allowing them to form a whole plant without culturing on multiple media types. Somatic embryogenesis has served as a model to understand the physiological and biochemical events that occur during plant developmental processes as well as a component to biotechnological advancement.Quiroz-Figueroa, F.

Planta 53:318‚Äì333 Direct and indirect embryogenesis Somatic embryogenesis has been described to occur in two ways: directly or indirectly.Sharp et al. (1980). In: Horticultural Reviews, Vol. 2. (janick, J., ed.). AVI Publishing Co, Westport, Conn., USA, p. 268.  Direct embryogenesis  occurs when embryos are started directly from explant tissue creating an identical clone.  Indirect embryogenesis  occurs when explants produced undifferentiated, or partially differentiated, cells (often referred to as callus) which then is maintained or differentiated into plant tissues such as leaf, stem, or roots. 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 6-Benzylaminopurine (BAP) and Gibberellic acid (GA) has been used for development of indirect somatic embryos in strawberry (Fragaria ananassa) Waghmare, S.

Plant regeneration by somatic embryogenesis Plant regeneration via somatic embryogenesis occurs in five steps: initiation of embryogenic cultures, proliferation of embryogenic cultures, prematuration of somatic embryos, maturation of somatic embryos and plant development on nonspecific media. Initiation and proliferation occur on a medium rich in auxin, which induces differentiation of localized meristematic cells. The auxin typically used is 2,4-D. Once transferred to a medium with low or no auxin, these cells can then develop into mature embryos. Germination of the somatic embryo can only occur when it is mature enough to have functional root and shoot apices Factors influencing Factors and mechanisms controlling cell differentiation in somatic embryos are relatively ambiguous. Certain compounds excreted by plant tissue cultures and found in culture media have been shown necessary to coordinate cell division and morphological changes.Warren, G.S., Fowler, M.W. 1981. Physiological interactions during the initial stages of embryogenesis in cultures of Daucus carota L. New Phytol 87:481-486. These compounds have been identified by Chung et al.Chung, W., Pedersen, H., Chin, C-K. 1992. Enhanced somatic embryo production by conditioned media in cell suspension cultures of Daucus carota.

Several signaling molecules known to influence or control the formation of somatic embryos have been found and include extracellular proteins, arabinogalactan proteins and lipochitooligosaccharides. Temperature and lighting can also affect the maturation of the somatic embryo.  Applications  Applications of this process include: clonal propagation of genetically uniform plant material; elimination of viruses; provision of source tissue for genetic transformation; generation of whole plants from single cells called protoplasts; development of synthetic seed technology.

Forestry related example  The development of somatic embryogenesis procedures has given rise to research on seed storage proteins (SSPs) of woody plants for tree species of commercial importance, i.e., mainly gymnosperms, including white spruce. In this area of study, SSPs are used as markers to determine the embryogenic potential and competency of the embryogenic system to produce a somatic embryo biochemically similar to its zygotic counterpart (Flinn et al. 1991, Beardmore et al. 1997).Flinn, B.S.; Roberts, D.R.; Webb, D.T.; Sutton, B.C. 1991.

Seedling shoot height, root collar diameter, and dry weight increased at a greater rate in seedlings than in emblings during the first half of the first growing season, but thereafter shoot growth was similar among all plants. By the end of the growing season, seedlings were 70% taller than emblings, had greater root collar diameter, and greater shoot dry weight. Root dry weight increased more rapidly in seedlings than in emblings during the early growing season During fall acclimation, the pattern of increasing dormancy release index and increasing tolerance to freezing was similar in both seedlings and emblings. Root growth capacity decreased then increased during fall acclimation, with the increase being greater in seedlings. Assessment of stock quality just prior to planting showed that: emblings had greater water use efficiency with decreasing predawn shoot water potential compared with seedlings; seedlings and emblings had similar water movement capability at both high and low root temperatures; net photosynthesis and needle conductance at low root temperatures were greater in seedlings than in emblings; and seedlings had greater root growth than emblings at 22 ¬∞C root, but root growth among all plants was low at 7.5 ¬∞C root temperature.

For both seedlings and emblings, osmotic potential at saturation (œàsat) and turgor loss point (œàtip) increased from a low of -1.82 and -2.22 MPa, respectively, just prior to planting to a seasonal high of -1.09 and -1.21 MPa, respectively, during active shoot elongation. Thereafter, seedlings and emblings (œàsat) and (œàtip) declined to -2.00 and -2.45 MPa, respectively, at the end of the growing season, which coincided with the steady decline in site temperatures and a cessation of height growth. In general, seedlings and emblings had similar œàsat and œàtip values through the growing season, and also had similar shifts in seasonal patterns of maximum modulus of elasticity, sympalstic fraction, and relative water content at turgor loss point. Grossnickle and Major (1992) found that year-old and current-year needles of both seedlings and emblings had a similar decline in needle conductance with increasing vapour pressure deficit. Response surface models of current-year needles net photosynthesis (Pn) response to vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) showed that emblings had 15% greater Pn at VPD of less than 3.0 kPa and PAR greater than 1000 Œºmol m‚àí2s‚àí1. Year-old and current-year needles of seedlings and emblings showed similar patterns of water use efficiency. Rates of shoot growth in seedlings and emblings through the growing season were also similar to one another. Seedlings had larger shoot systems both at the time of planting and at the end of the growing season. Seedlings also had greater root development than emblings through the growing season, but root:shoot ratios for the 2 stock types were similar at the end of the growing season, when the survival rates for seedlings and emblings were 96% and 99%, respectively. Tracking and fate maps Understanding the formation of a somatic embryo through establishment of morphological and molecular markers is important for construction of a fate map. The fate map is the foundation in which to build further research and experimentation. Two methods exist to construct a fate map: synchronous cell-division and time-lapse tracking. The latter typically works more consistently because of cell-cycle-altering chemicals and centrifuging involved in synchronous cell-division.Yang, Xiyan and Zhang, Xianlong(2010) 'Regulation of Somatic embryogenesis in Higher Plants', Critical Reviews in Plant Sciences, 29: 1, 36 ‚Äî 57 Angiosperms Embryo development in angiosperms is divided into several steps. The zygote is divided asymmetrically forming a small apical cell and large basal cell. The organizational pattern is formed in the globular stage and the embryo then transitions to the cotyledonary stage.Von Arnold S, Sabala I, Bozhkov P, Dyachok J and Filonova L (2002) Developmental pathways of somatic embryogenesis. Plant Cell Tiss Org. Cult. 69: 233‚Äì249 Embryo development differs in monocots and dicots. Dicots pass through the globular, heart- shaped, and torpedo stages while monocots pass through globular, scutellar, and coleoptilar stages.Jime ÃÅnez VM, Thomas C (2005) Participation of plant hormones in determination and progression of somatic embryogenesis. in: Mujib A, ≈†amaj J (eds) Somatic embryogenesis. Springer, Berlin, pp 103‚Äì118. Many culture systems induce and maintain somatic embryogenesis by continuous exposure to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Abscisic acid has been reported to induce somatic embryogenesis in seedlings. After callus formation, culturing on a low auxin or hormone free media will promote somatic embryo growth and root formation. In monocots, embryogenic capability is usually restricted to tissues with embryogenic or meristematic origin. Somatic cells of monocots differentiate quickly and then lose mitotic and morphogenic capability. Differences of auxin sensitivity in embryogenic callus growth between different genotypes of the same species show how variable auxin responses can be.Feh√©r, Attila. Why somatic plant cells start to form embryos? In: Mujid, Abdul and Samaj, Josef. eds. Somatic Embryogenesis. Plant Cell Monographs, Springer; Berlin/Heidelberg, 2005, vol. 2, p. 85-101. Carrot Daucus carota was the first and most understood species with regard to developmental pathways and molecular mechanisms. Time-lapse tracking by Toonen et al. (1994) showed that morphology of competent cells can vary based on shape and cytoplasm density. Five types of cells were identified from embryonic suspension: spherical cytoplasm-rich, spherical vacuolated, oval vacuolated, elongated vacuolated, and irregular shaped cells. Each type of cell multiplied with certain geometric symmetry. They developed into symmetrical, asymmetrical, and aberrantly-shaped cell clusters that eventually formed embryos at different frequencies.Toonen, M. A. J., Hendriks, T., Schmidt, E. D. L., Verhoeven, H. A., van Kammen, A., and De Vries, S. C. 1994. Description of somatic-embryo- forming single cells in carrot suspension cultures employing video cell tracking. Planta 194: 565‚Äì572. This indicates that organized growth polarity do not always exist in somatic embryogenesis. Gymnosperms Embryo development in gymnosperms occurs in three phases. Proembryogeny includes all stages prior to suspensor elongation. Early embryogeny includes all stages after suspensor elongation but before root meristem development. Late embryogeny includes development of root and shoot meristems. Time-lapse tracking in Norway Spruce Picea abies revealed that neither single cytoplasmic-rich cells nor vacuolated cells developed into embryos. Proembryogenic masses (PEMs), an intermediate between unorganized cells and an embryo composed of cytoplasmic-rich cells next to a vacuolated cell, are stimulated with auxin and cytokinin. Gradual removal of auxin and cytokinin and introduction of abscisic acid (ABA) will allow an embryo to form. Using somatic embryogenesis has been considered for mass production of vegetatively propagated conifer clones and cryopreservation of germplasm. However, the use of this technology for reforestation and tree breeding of conifers is in its infancy.H√§ggman H.; Vuosku J.; Sarjala T.; Jokela A.; Niemi K.

The episode was written by Henry Alonso Myers and Kristin Newman, and directed by Peter Lauer. It originally aired on May 9, 2011. In the episode, Chuck Bartowski (Zachary Levi) and Sarah Walker's (Yvonne Strahovski) wedding preparation includes one final detail: ensuring that the mother-of-the-groom, Mary (Linda Hamilton), makes it to the ceremony alive. Meanwhile, Morgan Grimes's (Joshua Gomez) responsibilities as best man include his most dangerous mission yet, as he faces Vivian Volkoff (Lauren Cohan). Elsewhere, Ellie Woodcomb (Sarah Lancaster) tends to the last details of the rehearsal dinner and seeks help from an unlikely source. \\"Chuck Versus the Last Details\\" received generally positive reviews from critics. According to the Nielsen ratings system, it drew 4.1 million viewers, the third-lowest number in Chuck history, after \\"Chuck Versus the Family Volkoff\\" and \\"Chuck Versus Agent X\\". It had a 2.4/4 share among all households and 1.4/4 share among those aged 18‚Äì49. Plot Mary Elizabeth Bartowski (Linda Hamilton) sneaks into a mine in Amacayacu, Colombia to retrieve the fully assembled \\"Norseman\\" weapon, only to be captured by Vivian Volkoff (Lauren Cohan) and Riley (Ray Wise). To ensure that Mary is at his wedding, Chuck Bartowski (Zachary Levi) travels to the mine and rescues Mary, leaving best man Morgan Grimes (Joshua Gomez) in charge of creating a video montage as his wedding present to Sarah Walker (Yvonne Strahovski). Morgan allows Jeff Barnes (Scott Krinsky), Lester Patel (Vik Sahay), and Big Mike (Mark Christopher Lawrence) to create the first cut so that he can partake in the mission, but John Casey (Adam Baldwin) forces Morgan to stay in Burbank due to Alex McHugh's (Mekenna Melvin) worry for his safety. Later, Morgan is assigned to infiltrate the meeting where Vivian intends to sell the Norseman, posing as a recently captured criminal he closely resembles. At the meeting, Riley uses the Norseman to kill all the buyers, eliminating all \\"competition\\" to Volkoff Industries. Because the Norseman was attuned to the DNA of the buyer Morgan was impersonating, rather than Morgan himself, Morgan pretends to be dead and is able to escape unharmed, but the team is forced to confront Riley and Vivian, who believes Chuck to be \\"Agent X\\". Chuck then reveals the truth that Vivian's father Alexei Volkoff was Agent X. Riley twists the information to further manipulate and shape Vivian, only to be shot and killed by Sarah. Vivian, however, manages to escape. At Chuck and Sarah's rehearsal dinner, Morgan tells Alex that he will stop going on missions and simply become an analyst. Chuck's sister Ellie (Sarah Lancaster) is unable to make her own video montage, having previewed and rejected Lester's deeply disturbed first cut. However, Jeff offers his own flawless cut of the montage, being rewarded with a kiss from Ellie. During the video, Chuck gets a phone call from Vivian, who intends to make him suffer. Vivian activates the Norseman device on a target at the dinner, who Chuck initially fears is his mother. Suddenly, Sarah's nose starts to bleed and she collapses in Chuck's arms as he calls out for help. Production Linda Hamilton guest starred in this episode. \\"Chuck Versus the Last Details\\" was directed by Peter Lauer, based on a script by Henry Alonso Myers and Kristin Newman. The episode originally aired in the United States on May 9, 2011, on NBC as the 23rd episode of Chuck fourth season and the 77th episode overall. Zap2it confirmed in April 2011 that Linda Hamilton, Lauren Cohan, Mekenna Melvin, and Ray Wise would reprise their recurring roles of Mary Elizabeth Bartowski, Vivian Volkoff, Alex McHugh, and Riley, respectively. Michael Bailey Smith also guest starred as a Volkoff security guard, Vlad. Series co-creator Chris Fedak revealed at the 2011 Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo that the series would focus less on the band Jeffster! than on Jeff and Lester's \\"other obsession\\" as amateur film makers, saying that the \\"two young \\"au-teurs\\" will \\"ma-ture\\" right in front of [the audience].\\" Cultural references Multiple references are made to the Star Wars saga throughout the episode. Chuck directly compares their attempting to sneak in to Vivian's base to the same method used by Luke Skywalker and Han Solo to rescue Princess Leia in the original film, by referring to the bound Casey as \\"Chewie.\\" During the same scene Casey mutters \\"I have a bad feeling about this,\\" a catch-phrase used by characters throughout the film series. The series is twice referenced directly, by Chuck when Sarah fails to understand his \\"Chewie\\" reference, and by Casey, who says, \\"This is what happens when you draw your plans from Star Wars.\\" Chuck and Morgan also make use of \\"The Imperial March\\" as a means to prepare Morgan for his mission to pose as a villain while infiltrating a meeting with Vivian. The episode contains a number of other references. Sarah comments that she has \\"finally\\" watched Mannequin. Mary is later shown doing pull-ups from her bed frame in her prison cell, referencing the film Terminator 2: Judgment Day, where Sarah Connor (also portrayed by Hamilton) did the same thing. While practicing his Italian accent, Morgan quotes video game character Mario's catchphrase \\"It's me, Mario!\\" Morgan later comments that buckets of acid are going to be used in the same way as on Breaking Bad, recommending the series to Casey. Reception \\"Chuck Versus the Last Details\\" received the third-fewest viewers of any episode in the season. According to the Nielsen ratings system, it drew 4.099 million viewers, higher only than \\"Chuck Versus the Family Volkoff\\" and \\"Chuck Versus Agent X\\". The episode had a 2.4/4 share among all households and 1.4/4 share among those aged 18‚Äì49. The episode received positive reviews from critics. HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall wrote, \\"It wasn't a perfect episode, mainly because Vivian remains a fairly muddled, bratty villain, and because I don't feel like the show ever really used Ray Wise to his full potential. But so much of it was so satisfying, both emotionally and comedically, that, until Vivian called Chuck during the rehearsal dinner, I actually thought to myself, 'You know, this would be a pretty damn good finale in and of itself. Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club rated the episode a B on an A+ to F scale. McGee wrote, \\"The last act was fairly phenomenal, but we had to get through a lot of troubling material in order to achieve true liftoff on the hour. With so many loose ends to wrap up, the hour felt overstuffed: the impending wedding, The Norseman, Agent X, Morgan's first field assignment...I mean, that's a lot of stuff. And it doesn't help that Vivian Volkoff is at the center of three of those things, and inserted herself into the fourth at the last moment. And in thinking about the clunkiness of aspects of this episode, I thought about the clunkiness of this latter half of the season as a whole.\\" Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8.5 out of 10, writing that it was a mistake not to include Timothy Dalton as Alexei Volkoff after the plot twists of the previous episode. Sarah Stegall of SFScope wrote, \\"Chuck is killing me by inches. So close, so close to the Chuck/Sarah wedding, but things keep going wrong.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Last Details Category:2011 American television episodes ","title":"Chuck Versus the Last Details"},{"id":"31571049","text":"Xochimilco was the most important city of the Xochimilca people, one of the Nahua tribes that migrated to the Mesoamerica region. At the same time it was the name of the altepetl of this group and historically referred to both interchangebly.Lockhart. The Nahuas After the Conquest The city was founded around 900 AD. It grew to become an important city in the Valley of Mexico, until in 1430, the Mexica of Tenochtitlan succeeded in conquering the city. Etymology Xochimilco's Aztec glyph The name ‚ÄúXochimilco‚Äù comes from Nahuatl and means ‚Äúflower field.‚Äù This referred to the many flowers and other crops that were grown here on chinampas since the pre-Hispanic period. History Petroglyph at Cuauhilama The first human presence in the area was of hunter gatherers, who eventually settled into farming communities. The first settlements in the Xochimilco area were associated with the Cuicuilco, Copilco and Tlatilco settlements during the Classic period. The Xochimilca people, considered to be one of the seven Nahua tribes that migrated into the Valley of Mexico, first settled around 900 CD in Cuahilama, near what is now Santa Cruz Acalpixca. They worshipped sixteen deities, with Chantico, goddess of the hearth and Cihuacoatl, an earth goddess and Amimitl, god of chinampas the most important. The Xochimilcas were farmers and founded their first dominion under a leader named Acatonallo. He is credited for inventing the chinampa system of agriculture in order to increase production. These chinampas eventually became the main producer with crops such as corn, beans, chili peppers, squash and more. The city of Xochimilco was founded in 919. Over time, it grew and began to dominate other areas on the south side of the lakes such as Mixquic, Tl√°huac, Culhuacan and even parts of what is now the State of Morelos. Xochimilco had one woman ruler, which did not happen anywhere else in Mesoamerica in the pre-Hispanic period. She is credited with adding a number of distinctive dishes to the area‚Äôs cuisine, with inclusions such as necuatolli, chileatolli (atole with chili pepper), esquites and tlapiques. In 1352, then emperor Caxtoltzin moved the city from the mainland to the island of Tlilan. In this respect it was like another island city in the area, Tenochtitlan. Although no longer an island, the city center is still in the same spot. In 1376, Tenochtitlan attacked Xochimilco, forcing the city to appeal to Azcapotzalco for help. The conquest was unsuccessful, but Xochimilco was then forced to pay tribute to Azcapotzalco. Tenochtitlan succeeded in conquering Xochimilco in 1430, while it was ruled by Tzalpoyotzin. Shortly thereafter, Aztec emperor Itzcoatl built the causeway or calzada that would connect the two cities over the lake. During the reign of Moctezuma Ilhuicamina, the Xochimilcas contributed materials and manpower to construct a temple to Huitzilopochtli. They also participated in the further conquests of the Aztec Empire such as in Cuauhn√°huac (Cuernavaca), Xalisco and the Metztitl√°n and Oaxaca valleys. For their service, Ahuizotl, granted the Xochimilcas autonomy in their lands, and the two cities coexisted peacefully. Aztec emperors would pass by here on royal barges on their way to Chalco/Xico, then an island in Lake Chalco. Aztec emperor Moctezuma Xocoyotzin imposed a new governor, Om√°catl, onto Xochimilco due to the arrival of the Spanish, but this governor was forced to return to Tenochtitlan, when the emperor was taken prisoner. He was then succeeded by Macuilxochitecuhtli, but eighty days later he too went to Tenochtitlan to fight the Spanish alongside Cuitl√°huac. He was followed by Apochquiyautzin, who remained loyal to Tenochtitlan. For this reason, Hern√°n Cort√©s decided to send armies to subdue Xochimilco before taking Tenochtitlan. This occurred in 1521. During the battle, Cort√©s was almost killed when he fell off his horse, but he was saved by a soldier named Crist√≥bal de Olea.Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, The battle was fierce and left few Xochimilca warriors alive. According to legend, it was after this battle that Cuauht√©moc came to Xochimilco and planted a juniper tree in the San Juan neighborhood to commemorate the event. Pre-Hispanic Xochimilco was an island connected to the mainland by three causeways. One of these still exists in the form of Avenida Guadalupe I.Ramirez, one of the city‚Äôs main streets. This causeway led to the main ceremonial center of the town, which was called the Quilaztli. The Spanish destroyed the Quilaztli during the Conquest, and replaced it with the San Bernardino de Siena Church, which would become the social and political center of the colonial city. It became a settlement of Spanish, criollos and mestizos, with the indigenous living in rural communities outside of the city proper. After the Conquest, Apochquiyauhtzin, the last lord of Xochimilco, was baptized with the name of Lu√≠s Cort√©s Cer√≥n de Alvarado in 1522 and he was allowed to continue governing under the Spanish. Evangelization was undertaken here by Mart√≠n de Valencia with a number of others who are known as the first twelve Franciscans in Mexico. Their monastery was built between 1534 and 1579, along with many chapels and churches in the Xochimilco area, a hospital in Tlacoapa and a school. Xochimilco was made an encomienda of Pedro de Alvarado in 1521 and remained such until 1541.

The victory scores of the pilots represented at List of World War I flying aces (pilots with at least five victories to their credit) often cannot be definitive, but are based on itemized lists that are the best available sources of information. Loss of records (especially records of casualties and lost aircraft, which are at their best a very good guide to the degree of over-claiming), by mischance and the passage of time ‚Äì and the detail to which such records were kept in the first place ‚Äì often complicates the reconstruction of the actual count for a given ace.Above the Trenches: A Complete Record of the Fighter Aces and Units of the British Empire Air Forces 1915‚Äì1920. p.7 Additionally, the German victory confirmation system began to buckle in February 1918; after August 1918, such records as survived were unit records.Above the Lines: The Aces and Fighter Units of the German Air Service, Naval Air Service and Flanders Marine Corps, 1914‚Äì1918. p. 6. World War I began the historical experience that has shown that approximately five percent of combat pilots account for the majority of air-to-air victories in warfare, thus showing the importance of flying aces.How to Make War: A Comprehensive Guide to Modern Warfare in the Twenty-first Century, p. 149.  Allies of World War I = Belgium  Enemy aircraft had to fall within friendly lines in a nation partially occupied by the enemy, or be seen by friendly ground troops falling within German lines, to be counted. Confirmation by fellow friendly pilots was not allowed. Thus, unconfirmed claims outnumbered official victories. Although the Belgian system of counting victories supposedly mirrored the French system more than the British one, victory lists for Belgian aces still contain confirmed claims for FTL (forced to land) and OOC (out of control) victories. Inspection of the Belgian pilots' victory lists also show victories being shared without being fractionally divided.  France  French victory confirmation standards were strict. Credit was given only for the destruction of an enemy aircraft, and the destruction had to be witnessed by an independent witness, such as an artillery observer, infantryman, or another pilot. The victories certified generally fell into one of four categories of destruction: #An enemy aircraft independently witnessed falling in flames; #An enemy aircraft independently witnessed crashing to earth; #An enemy aircraft independently witnessed disintegrating while in flight; #An enemy aircraft falling into captivity behind the battle lines of the French or their allies. Probable victories would not count on a pilot's score, although they would be noted. Examples of probable victories could be enemy aircraft falling out of control but not seen to impact, or a claim lacking independent confirmation. Observers as well as pilots could become aces. Victories could be shared, and counted as an addition of one to the score of each 'victor' rather than being divided fractionally. In some cases, a single destroyed German or Austro-Hungarian aircraft could add to the scores of half a dozen or more French fliers.  Great Britain and the British Commonwealth  Counting of \\"aerial victories\\" by the British was shaped by the high command's determination to sustain an ongoing aerial offensive, as well as the prevailing westerly winds on the Western Front. From the start, the British counted actions that foiled German intentions as victorious. Their count system was skewed toward recognizing the moral victory of thwarting enemy offensive actions as well as the physical one of destroying his aircraft. #A British or Commonwealth pilot of the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service, or Australian pilots of the Australian Flying Corps could be credited with a victory for destroying an enemy plane, for driving it down out of control, capturing it, or destroying an enemy observation balloon. In the earliest days of aerial combat, in 1915 and 1916, victories could also be awarded for forcing an enemy aircraft to land in either Allied or enemy territory. #By 1917, the number of \\"out of control\\", \\"driven down\\" and \\"forced to land\\" victories were overloading the scoring system. As aerial combat soared to the point where British pilots might submit 50 claims on a given day, the count system became overwhelmed. By May 1918, the new Royal Air Force supposedly ceased reporting \\"out of control\\" victories as part of pilots' scores, but still credited them to pilots for the purposes of awarding decorations. Victories were limited to enemy aircraft destroyed, enemy airplanes driven down out of control if they seemed so damaged they would crash, and airplanes captured. Squadron, Brigade, and Wing headquarters all kept track of individual and unit scores. #The approval system began with a Combat Report from the Squadron submitted to Wing HQ. They in turn passed the report on to Brigade HQ. Either Wing or Brigade could approve or disapprove it; sometimes one would confirm the victory while the other would not. #Victories were reported by RFC HQ via Communiqu√©. The deadline for the daily Communiqu√© (nicknamed \\"Comic Cuts\\" by RFC pilots) was 1600 hours (4 PM). Following a system that did not always report an event on the day it actually occurred added to the confusion caused by dual reporting. #In cases where more than one pilot (or observer) was involved in a British victory, practice was especially inconsistent. Since after all only one enemy aircraft had been destroyed, the victory at unit level (to the squadron or wing for instance) was counted as one. On the other hand, in some cases all pilots concerned might receive a full credit to his personal score, as victories at this time were not divided fractionally, in the way that became common practice later. As a striking example of this, no fewer than twelve Royal Flying Corps pilots each claimed a victory because they helped destroy an Albatros D.III on 8 April 1917.Retrieved on 3 August 2010. However, some squadrons counted such victories only to the unit concerned without crediting them to an individual, or counted \\"shared\\" scores separately from a particular pilot's 'solo' victories. In the case of two-seater crews, both pilot and observer might each receive credit for a victory. The usual rule of thumb credited all victories to the pilot of a Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter or Bristol F.2 Fighter two-seater, but the observer/gunner was credited only for those instances where he fired his weapon. Some squadrons kept separate lists of pilot and observer aces; some did not. #Unlike other air forces of the time, British authorities did not necessarily require independent ground verification of a victory to award credit.  Italy  #The enemy aircraft fell in Italian-held territory and could be confirmed, or #Other Allied Powers pilots and/or ground observers could independently confirm an enemy's destruction. #Victories could be shared, with more than one pilot and/or gunner receiving full credit for a victory. #The system codified by Pier Piccio (an ace and by then the Inspector of Fighter Units) in Istruzione provvisoria di impiego delle Squadriglie da Caccia (\\"Provisional Instruction for the Use of the Fighter Squadrons\\") in June 1918 called for at least two confirmations from artillery, balloon, or frontline observers. #In January 1919, the intelligence branch of Commando Generale di Aeronautica (\\"General Command of Aeronautics\\") hastily drew up a list of pilots credited with any aerial victories during the war, which came to a close in November 1918; evaluative criteria is unknown, thus casting doubt on the final totals.  USA  Pilots from the USA had their victory totals defined several different ways. If and when they served with British aviation, their victories were determined via British methods; indeed, no fewer than 40 American aces served solely in British units. It was equally true that Americans serving in French units were evaluated via French standards; there were just four American aces who served solely in French units. The US Army Air Service would adopt French standards for evaluating American victories scored for the USAAS, with one exception‚Äìduring the summer of 1918, while flying under operational control of the British, the 17th Aero Squadron and the 148th Aero Squadron naturally used British standards. American observers could become aces. Victories could be shared between aviators. USAAS records, which tracked only those victories scored by Americans in the USAAS, showed 1,513 victories were credited to individual pilots or observers for the destruction of 756 German airplanes and 76 observation balloons; 341 of the victories were shared to some extent, proving that the sharing of victories was common enough to be the norm. However, the USAAS did not track victories won by Americans in other countries' air forces. Russian Empire The Russian Empire had no known victory standards.  The Central Powers of World War I = Austria-Hungary  Every aircrew member significantly contributing to the defeat of an enemy aircraft was credited with a full victory. All victories counted equally, whether the aviator scored them as a fighter pilot, a reconnaissance pilot, or an aerial observer/gunner.  Germany  At the start of the era of the Fokker Scourge in July 1915, no dedicated \\"fighter\\" aviation units existed within what was then called the Fliegertruppe serving the German Army ‚Äî the pioneering Fokker Eindecker fighters were distributed singly or in pairs, to protect the six two-seat aircraft that each Feldflieger Abteilung Army aerial observation unit used for front-line reconnaissance. When future \\"ace\\" pilots like Leutnant Kurt Wintgens and Leutnant Otto Parschau began accumulating victories over Allied aircraft from their early Eindecker fighters, the downed Allied aircraft had to fall on the German side of the front lines to be counted as a \\"confirmed\\" aerial victory, or be seen to fall from the sky by either fellow Fliegertruppe aviators aloft with the fighter pilots, or fellow army ground observers. On July 15, 1915, Wintgens achieved the first confirmed German victory over a Morane-Saulnier Type L \\"parasol\\" monoplane, despite his previous pair of victories on July 1 and 4 against other French-flown Type L \\"parasol\\" two- seaters, both of which fell on the Allied side of the lines, and thus not counting as \\"confirmed\\" aerial victories by official German standards of the time. The two most famous 1915‚Äì16 era aces of the German Empire's Fliegertruppe, Oswald Boelcke and Max Immelmann would achieve a six-victory total each to earn the House Order of Hohenzollern by early November 1915 for those confirmed victories, and when each of their totals reached eight, the much-coveted Pour le M√©rite was awarded to each ace on the same day, January 12, 1916. The Germans did not use the term 'ace' but referred to German pilots who had achieved 10 kills as Kanone (\\"big gun\\") and publicized their names and scores, for the benefit of civilian morale ‚Äì this term is not known to have come into use before May 1916, however, as when a pilot before that time achieved a total of four confirmed victories, they were most likely to start being cited in official Army communiqu√©s. As mentioned previously, the German military's verification methods for scoring a \\"confirmed\\" aerial victory were rigorous, and became more so later in the war. By 1916, as the dedicated Jasta fighter squadrons were forming within the newly named Luftstreitkr√§fte in October of 1916, every victory had to be claimed in a combat report to his commanding officer. The report was passed up the chain of command for evaluation. Downed enemy aircraft that landed behind the German lines of trenchwork were easily confirmed. Those that fell behind enemy lines had to be verified by a German observer. All victories were credited to a single specific pilot. In case of insoluble disagreement over a given victim, the victory would be credited to a unit, but not to an individual. The sole exception to this was the awarding of a victory each to the pilot and observer of a successful two-seater.

He did his early schooling in Shantipur and went on to the Presidency College, Calcutta to acquire his degree in science in the early 1900s. Later he obtained a degree in law from the University of Calcutta and practiced in Raiganj and the Sealdah courts as an advocate. He was elected as one of the Commissioners of Shantipur Municipality in Dec 1913. He was literarily inclined. Being well versed in Sanskrit and influenced by the M√ºllerian wave of exploring the ancient Indian language, he translated and edited papers on Sanskrit literature.Supp. Catalogue of Bengali books in the library of the British Museum; compiled by James Fuller Blumhardt; British Museum.

In 1919, he was a member of the 'moderate' Indian National Liberation Foundation led by Surendranath Bannerjee - one of the founders of the Indian National Congress; but who left the Congress, since he favoured accommodation and dialogue with the British . He went on to support the Congress Modern Review (Calcutta),vol.44,p684, Calcutta, 1928 and joined as a senior leader during his tenure at the Raigunj Court. When the Civil disobedience broke out in the 1930, Sudhamoy took an active role as a Congress member from Raigunj . Raigunj celebrated Independence day (Purna Swaraj) on 26 January, 1930 against the British Raj - he and Umeshchandra Bhowmik were the Congress leaders enacting the historic Lahore resolution of the CWC.Amrita Bazar Patrika, 29 January 1930 In March 1930, as mass disobedience gathered momentum in Bengal, several Congress leaders (including Netaji - then Bengal Provincial Congress Committee President), were arrested. On 15 April, on the occasion of the Bengali New Year, Sudhamoy presided over public meetings in Raigunj as a part of the Civil Disobedience Movement in blatant violation of the Salt Laws. Braving arrests by the British, volunteers from all over the district, including women, paraded the streets of Raigunj.Malay Sankar Bhattacharya : Studies in microhistory: political movements in some parts of India and Bangladesh, 1857-1947; Indian Institute of Oriental Studies and Research, Kolkata (2007), Pg 116, 119 & 229, .Amrita Bazar Patrika, 18 April 1930 Article from Newspaper Amrita Bazar Patrika, Apr 1930 Few years later he moved to Calcutta.

The four festivals, occurring during the summer of 2011, took the place of DMB's usual summer tour, after the band announced its intentions to take time off from touring the previous year. The first festival took place at Bader Field in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The second festival was at Chicago's Lakeside. The third stop of the DMB Caravan took place at Governors Island in New York, New York, but was rescheduled after Hurricane Irene hit the New York area the same weekend. On September 1, it was announced that the dates were rescheduled, while the venue changed to Randall's Island. The last stop was The Gorge in Washington. Each festival was three days long, with each show featuring a full set from the Dave Matthews Band. Various other acts performed on different stages prior to DMB's set. DMB played a very diverse catalog at these shows, and also played many new covers, including Led Zeppelin's \\"Good Times Bad Times\\" and Aerosmith's \\"Sweet Emotion\\". DMB also widened their own personal catalog of songs by performing older, rarer numbers such as Kill The King, Shotgun, Joy Ride, and The Best Of What's Around. The set lists, as of Atlantic City and Chicago, had an almost climactic sense to them, with sets building up to the third and final night. Bader Field On March 9, 2011, Dave Matthews Band Caravan announced that its first performance would take place at Bader Field in Atlantic City, New Jersey on June 24‚Äì26.

The new dates are September 16‚Äì18, with DMB still headlining all three nights. Fans who purchased a three-day ticket to Governors Island will be permitted to attend all three concerts at Randall's Island. Single day ticket holders who purchased tickets for August 27‚Äì28 (who were also allowed to attend the August 26 show) were allowed to attend the Randall's Island show on either September 17 or 18, depending on which ticket was purchased. For three day Governors Island ticket holders who did not attend any shows, there is also an option for a full refund. A three-day ticket holder who attended the show on August 26 can receive a two-thirds refund. A new lineup of artists will be announced in the near future, along with other information pertaining to the venue and concerts. Tickets Tickets for the Caravan festivals were sold through Dave Matthews Band Warehouse Fan Association, as well as Ticketmaster. There were two types of tickets available for the DMB Caravan. One was a 3-day pass that allowed the ticket-holder entry to all three festivals; that was $195. The other option was a VIP pass, that allowed the ticket-holder entry to all three festivals. It also gave the ticket-holder access to a sectioned-off area of each stage, VIP restrooms, free snacks, beer, and water, and a dinner buffet. Warehouse members that purchased the VIP pass also received a voucher that allowed them to get one souvenir for free. The VIP passes were $825. Payment plan In response to fans complaining of high ticket prices, DMB Caravan released a ticket payment plan to help fans who wanted to attend the shows. The payment plan consists of three payments over a schedule of dates, rather than paying the full price all at once. The payment plan is for both the three-day pass and the VIP pass. The first payment contains all shipping and convenience fees, while the second and third are flat payments with no additional charges. The three-day pass (which is usually $195), is now broken into three payments of $65, while the VIP pass (which is usually $825), is now three payments of $275.

Nicole had also participated in the Cyprus Final for the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 with the song \\"Like a Woman\\".  1991‚Äì2010: Early life  Nicole was born on 16 December 1991 in Sydney, Australia to Yiannis and Helen Paparistodemou and spent her childhood between Sydney and Paphos, Cyprus. She has an older and a younger brother, Marinos and Raphaellos -correspondingly. Having expressed a genuine interest towards music from a very young age she began taking piano, theory, solf√®ge and harmony classes at the age of 6 as well as vocal-coach lessons at the age of 8.http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/14961 During her teenage years, she participated in numerous local singing competitions as well as in the Junior Eurovision Song Contest twicehttp://www.esctoday.com/news/read/14653 and, although aspiring to become a lawyer, her love for music led her to apply for a scholarship to Berklee College of Music in Boston which she had managed to obtain. Nonetheless, her participation in Greek Idol I had changed her plans and she saved her place for a later stage.  Cyprus National Final for Eurovision  Nicole's attempt for winning the Cyprus Final in the Eurovision Song Contest may have not been successful but her song, \\"Like a Woman\\", a powerful ballad written by the infamous Eurovision composer Mike Connaris, had won the hearts of the audiences who were introduced to her just before the beginning of the Greek Idol.  2010: Greek Idol  thumb As she had missed the opportunity to represent Cyprus in the Eurovision Song Contest in 2010, Nicole decided to give Greek Idol a go. The following day after the Cyprus National Final, she went for the Greek Idol audition and the judges had been left amazed with her vocal abilities.(Nicole's Audition) Having been chosen in the final 10 of the show, week by week her performances were applauded by the judges and the public. However it was not only her voice that won their hearts but also her petite-frame and childish naiveness. No Greek Idol fan can forget her nickname \\"Fraoulitsa/Œ¶œÅŒ±ŒøœÖŒªŒØœÑœÉŒ±\\" (little strawberry), given to her by one of the judges, Petros Kostopoulos. Greek Idol I ended with Nicole winning 2nd place.  2011: Post-Greek Idol era  Straight after the end of Greek Idol I in June 2010, Nicole began her journey in the music pathways in Greece. In July 2010 she accompanied Anna Vissi in her Cyprus tour, after Anna had given her and Valando Tryfonos this opportunity, during the Greek Idol final. In August 2010, Nicole had appeared next to Giannis Ploutarchos/Melisses/Valando Tryfonos and Stergios Ntaousanakis in Thessaloniki for two months and consequently, from October 2010 up until the beginning of March 2011, she had been singing next to Despoina Vandi at Vox in Athens. In addition, she was asked to perform among other talented musicians on the Michael Jackson \\"Dangerous\\" Tribute, held in December 2010 in Athens.http://www.newstoday.gr/article/13207/dangerous-michael-jackson-fan- tribute In the end of May 2011, she was signed to the Greek Music Label Lyra and her first single \\"Mono i agapi\\" (Only love) was released.  2012‚ÄìPresent: Nikki Lee  In the beginning of 2012, Nicole was signed to Down2Earth Records and since then, she switched her stage name to \\"Nikki Lee\\" while adopting a different image, influenced by the Japanese fashion. Her song \\"Chiki Chiki\\" was released in June 2012 and was a huge success in many different countries. Her biggest moment of success though in 2012 was her collaboration with Claydee on the hit \\"Mamacita Buena\\" which became one of the most viewed Greek songs on YouTube. In May 2013, almost a year after \\"Chiki Chiki\\", her second single \\"Heleya\\" was released with promising success. In 2014 she moved to Sydney, in order to pursue her studies at the JMC Music Academy in Music (Contemporary Performance).

The organization has three main goals: improving access to coverage and care, promoting high-value care, and investing in people, knowledge, and networks that help to make meaningful change possible in California‚Äôs health care system. Established in 1996, CHCF operates with an endowment of more than $750 million in assets and has paid out more than $500 million to support its programmatic work. Inception The California Health Care Foundation was one of two philanthropies created in 1996 as a result of Blue Cross of California‚Äôs conversion from a nonprofit health plan to a for-profit corporation, WellPoint (now Anthem). CHCF‚Äôs first responsibility was managing the sale of WellPoint Health Networks stock. Of the $3 billion yielded from this process, four-fifths of the proceeds went to create The California Endowment and the remainder, some $600 million at the time, stayed with CHCF. From its inception, CHCF has looked for opportunities to improve health care in California by supporting higher quality, greater efficiency, and broader access to care. Leadership Sandra R. Hern√°ndez became president and CEO of the California Health Care Foundation in January 2014. Prior to joining CHCF, Hern√°ndez was CEO of The San Francisco Foundation, which she led for 16 years. She previously served as director of public health for the City and County of San Francisco. Hern√°ndez is an assistant clinical professor at the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine. She practiced at San Francisco General Hospital in the AIDS clinic from 1984 to 2016.

Grant, 486 U.S. 414 (1988), was an important decision by the United States Supreme Court on paid petition circulation.. Colorado was one of several states with a process for citizens to propose initiatives for the ballot, which if passed became law. One of the requirements was to get the signatures of a significant number of registered Colorado electors. Colorado prohibited initiative sponsors from paying for the circulation of these petitions. The state argued this was necessary to \\"protect[...] the integrity of the initiative.\\" In 1984, Coloradans for Free Enterprise, an interest group, proposed an initiative to deregulate the motor industry by removing it from the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Commission. After the title and summary were approved by the state, they began unpaid circulation. They eventually concluded that they would not be able to get the 46,737 required signatures by the deadline. They then filed suit under 42 U.S.C. 1983 against the Secretary of State of Colorado, Natalie Meyer, and the Attorney General of Colorado, Duane Woodard, in their official capacities. The plaintiffs alleged that the Colorado statute infringed on their First Amendment rights. The district court, with Judge John P. Moore sitting, declined to overturn the law, finding that \\"the evidence did not indicate that plaintiffs were prevented in any way from espousing their cause simply because they could not obtain paid petition circulators.\\" The plaintiffs appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Judges James Barrett and William Doyle affirmed in a panel opinion. The court granted a rehearing en banc at the plaintiff's request, and vacated the panel's opinion. The full court of appeals reversed and remanded, determining that Colorado's law \\"impede[d] the sponsors' opportunity to disseminate their views to the public.\\" The state appealed to the Supreme Court, which heard oral argument on April 25, 1988. The Supreme Court unanimously affirmed the decision, ruling that \\"the State has failed to demonstrate that it is necessary to burden appellees' ability to communicate their message in order to meet its concerns.\\"Meyer, 486 U.S. at 426.

It is about 27 km from Taluka headquarters Mundra and barely a kilometer away from the seashore. History Bhadreshwar is the site of the ancient city of Bhadravati.Bhadravati is mentioned in epic Mahabharata. It is mentioned in the works of Kantavijay, a Jain monk. The earliest source of information regarding this place is an inscription on the Ajitnath statue in Vasai Jain temple which records Samvat 622 (555 AD) which may be marking Samvat 1622 (1565 AD) also. The Vasai Jain Temple is said to have been founded in the 21st year of the Vairat era, and dedicated to Vasai by Siddhasen of the race of Hari. His successors were Mahasen, Narsen, Bhojraj, Vanraj, Sarangdev, Virasen, and Harisen, who lived in the time of Vikram (57 BC). Harisen had left his kingdom to his widow Lilavati. Lilavati was succeeded by his nephew Kirtidhara. Then came Dharnipal, Devdatt and Danjiraj. In the time of Dhaniraj, the country was plundered by many chiefs. In 156, (Samvat 213), Vanraj Vaghela of Munjpur, who was Jain, seized the country. He was succeeded by Yograj, Ratnadatta or Shivaditya and Vijayarao or Vaisiddha. Next, after a time of misrule, the Kathis of Pavargadh seized Bhadravati and kept it for 147 years. After them, 651 (Samvat 618), Kanak Chavda of Patan took the country, built the temple, and in 555 (Samvat 622) set up the statue of Ajitnath which may be brought in to fit the date on the statue. Kanak's successor was Akad Chavda, a Shaiva. During his time, the village was invaded by Sayyid Lal Shah and Mughuls. He was followed by his son Bhuvad who lost his kingdom to the Solanki Rajputs of Bhangadh. The new rulers changed the name of the place to Bhadreshwar in 741 (Samvat 798), and continued to hold it until 1132 (Samvat 1189). Navghan, the son of Bhimrao, was the last of them. The other statues of the Jain temple mark Samvat 1232 (1175 AD) as their dates. Perhaps the earliest historical fact is that in Samvat 1182 (1125 AD), Jagdusha, a Jain merchant and philanthropist who had made a fortune as a grain dealer in a time of famine, received a grant of Bhadreshwar and had the temple so thoroughly repaired that all traces of antiquity were removed. He died without heirs in 1181 (Samvat 1238) and the village fell into the hands Naughan Vaghela and his vakils Ajjaramal Shantidas and Nagandas Tejpal. Vastupal-Tejapal, the ministers in court of Viradhaval of Vaghela dynasty visited the temple with Sangha in Samvat 1286 and was well received by Navghan. They managed to convince Viradhaval to get his daughter married with Sarangdev, the grandson of Navghan. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries this was a most popular place of pilgrimage among Jains. Under the Hala Jadeja, it was seized by Jam Jadeja and afterwards by Jam Raval in 1535 (Samvat 1592). Since then it has been neglected. In 1763, the walls of the old fort began to be pulled down and the stones used for building. About 1810 even the old temples were razed to supply stones to build the seaport town of Mundra. On 15 December 1815, the army of Cutch State was defeated near Bhadreshwar. The army of the British East India Company was led by Colonel East and the army of Cutch was led by a Muslim commander, Hussain Miyan met near Bhadreshwar. The British army was behind the Vasai Jain Temple and the temple was in between them. Husain Miyan respected the sanctity of the temple and he didn't fire on the British, fearing the temple might be damaged. The British army won and occupied the fortified town of Anjar, port of Tuna and adjacent villages by 25 December 1815. This led to negotiations between the Cutch and British rulers. The Jadeja rulers of Kutch accepted the suzerainty of the British in 1818 and Captain James MacMurdo was posted as British Political Resident stationed at Bhuj. The Anjar district, however, remained under direct occupation of British forces for seven years until 25 December 1822, when it was handed back to Cutch State by an agreement. After the independence of India in 1947, Cutch State acceded unto the dominion of India and was constituted an independent commissionaire, Kutch State. In 1956, Kutch State was merged with Bombay state, which in 1960 was divided into the new linguistic states of Gujarat and Maharashtra, with Kutch becoming part of Gujarat state. Bhadreshwar now falls under Mundra Taluka of Kutch district. Places of interest Rebuilt Vasai Jain Temple after 2001 earthquake Vasai Jain Temple Vasai Jain Temple is believed to be one of the oldest Jain temples in India, although they have been renovated and rehabilitated from time to time. It is said a Jain layman named Devchandra laid the foundation stone of this temple centuries ago. In 13th century, the temple was renovated extensively by Jagdusha. The temples have been destroyed many times due to natural calamities like earthquakes. The chronicles of Mistris of Kutch, mention that they were the architects and artisans, who renovated temples during the earthquakes of 1819, 1844‚Äì45 and 1875.Kadia Kashtriya Itihas.

The general plan is like that of the Dilwara Temples on mount Abu. It stands in a court about 48 feet wide by 85 long, surrounded by a row of forty-four shrines with a corridor in front. The temple stands in a courtyard, which, from the line of the temple front, is covered by three pillared domes. The temple, facing the east, is entered by a flight of steps that rise from the outer door to the covered area in front of the sanctuary. Over the porch is another large dome covering an area separated by a low screen wall from the area of the entrance hall, mandap, between it and the front of the temple itself. At the south-west corner and behind the cells on the left side is a row of chambers with cellars entered by lifting up flagstones in the floor. In the shrine are three white marble images. The central image is Ajitnath, the second of the Tirthankars, with the date 622 probably for Samvat 1622 or AD 1565. On his right is Parshwanath with the snake hood marked 1175 (Samvat 1232), and on his left Santinath, the 16th Tirthankar, also marked 1175 (Samvat 1232). On the extreme right is the image of the black or Shamla Parshwanath. Lal Shahbaz Dargah The Shrine of Ibrahim, is locally known as Pir Lal Shahbaz Dargah, and is said to be that of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, whose shrine is actually located in the Pakistani city of Sehwan Sharif. It is a small walled enclosure that has a square pyramid shaped dome. It is round in the inside and supported on eight pillars set against the wall. The roof of the porch is flat and divided into 9√ó3 small squares, each with lotus flowers inside. Round the architrave, above the vine-ornamented wall-head course, there is a deep line of Arab inscription in large square Kufic characters, and on the right end of the wall there are two lines of inscription. In the court some graves also have Kufic inscriptions. These epigraphs constructed in AH Dhi‚Äôl-hijja 554 (December 1159-January 1160 AD) marked the first use of Kufic script as well as the first epigraphic evidence of Muslim settlement in India. Chhoti Masjid Duda stepwell Chhoti Masjid is a very old mosque which is reliably dated to the late 12th century, meaning they predate the well known Islamic architecture of Ahmedabad by 250 years or so, making them in all likelihood the first mosques built in India.  Solahkhambhi Mosque ruins left Chokhanda Mahadev Temple; OPG power plant is visible in the background On the south-west of Vasai Jain temple, there are ruins of another mosque known as Solahkhambhi Mosque which is partially buried in the sand and is no longer in use. The original entrance is on the east side, within which is built a small chamber, apparently never finished. The porch is raised on eight pillars, with pilasters against the walls. At the back is a mehrab, a plain semi-circular recess, and two neat doors leading into an inner apartment, possibly a second place of prayer for a select number. It has four doors, two at each end. This mosque is built of pretty large stones, most accurately jointed, and all the roofs are of flat slabs. The doors have drips over them, and the two into the front apartment have semi-circular arches, the others lintels. The architraves are carved with neat veli or creeper patterns and with large flowers below. The pillars are square at the base, octagonal in the middle and circular above having bracket capitals above to support lintels which are 9 feet long. In the front of the mehrab are two rows of pillars in good condition followed by two rows of pillars with disturbed condition. It followed by a wall and four more rows of pillars and some other pillars, probably of porch. Duda stepwell Duda Vav is a large and substantial though plain stepwell with a lintel about 17 feet 7 inches long by 2 feet 1 inches square. It was constructed by placing heavy blocks of stones on one another. The stepwell is now partially collapsed and is ruined. There was a dome of Shiva Temple near it in the 1850s. It was 15 feet 18 inches overall and the pillars are 1 foot 4 inches long. Alt URL Chokhanda Mahadev Temple There is also an ancient Shiva temple known as Chokhanda Mahadev situated at the seashore.

The Eagle Lock Company (established 1833) was, at one time, the largest trunk and cabinet lock maker in the world. It was based in Terryville, Connecticut. The Eagle Lock Company was at the forefront of padlock security at the time. History The Eagle Lock Company was formed by the consolidation of several early nineteenth-century enterprises. The most notable began in 1832, when an English immigrant and locksmith opened a small lock manufacturer in Watertown, Connecticut. This was one of the first American lock works. After two years, his small shop and skills were acquired by the Terryville, Connecticut firm of Lewis, McKee and Company, which was run by Eli Terry, son of the clock maker. In 1841, after Eli Terry's death, the business was bought by the Lewis and Gaylord Company, and then consolidated in 1854 with the James Terry Company (a maker of carpet bag frames) as the Eagle Lock Company. Production grew so much that, by the 1890s, the firm was one of the largest trunk lock manufacturers in the world, employing nearly 500 workers. Products included trunk and cabinet locks, as well as high quality security-grade padlocks, and, in the early twentieth century, screw-machine products. The company experienced precipitous growth with the onset of the First World War, and even greater expansion during the Second World War, nearly doubling the number of employees to 800. With major defense contracts, it became an attractive takeover target for large firms looking to create subsidiary industries. In 1943, with the largest profit margins in company history, Eagle Lock was sold to F. Bowser Inc., of Fort Wayne, Indiana, however it continued to operate under its original name and location in Terryville, Connecticut. After the War, the board of Eagle Lock deliberated, but never initiated, a move to the southeastern United States for tax purposes. The company‚Äôs financial situation began to deteriorate and the company was sold in the 1960s to the Delaware firm of Penn-Akron Corporation. The Eagle Lock Company continued to flounder after the sale, and by the 1970s, faced foreclosure and bankruptcy. While there were attempts to purchase the manufacturing complex, none succeeded, and the company closed in 1975. The majority of the plant was demolished and the land redeveloped. After the company closed, the employees were honored for over 65 years of work in the town's 175th birthday. Factory Complex The Terryville factory had a manufacturing line of over 2000 different kinds of locks. The factory consisted of one main office building, and later in 1889 and 1905, extra work space was added including two five-story buildings on either side of the office. The factory had a boarding house on Prospect Street for male employees, which was torn down in the early 1900s. A sales room was once operated on Chambers Street in New York City. The lock company housed four ponds including upper pond (now Terryville Fish and Game), middle pond (now privately owned), lower pond (no longer in existence but once held water to power the Eli Terry Waterwheel), and Reservoir One (once filling up all of the land behind the congregational church and along Eagle Street, it was drained and removed after a fire in 1975). The factory had buildings where the Terryville Rite Aid currently is located. The remnants of the former Eagle Lock Company factory complex are located at the east and west corners of the intersection of South Main and Main Streets in Terryville, Connecticut. It is not known exactly when company first moved to this site, but its location on the Pequabuck River, which runs directly through the site, shows that the original operations were water powered. Today, only four of the buildings out of some 50 remain. Of the four remaining buildings, only one has not been altered, while the other three were disconnected and had floors removed. The first surviving building is a one story brick production shed with gable roof on the corner of South Main Street and East Orchard Street; this building held such operations as packing, stocking and shipping, buffing and plating and pin-lock production. The second survivor is a two-story brick power house between East Orchard Street and South Eagle Street; the smokestack has been partially demolished. The five-story brick loft building on the north side of South Main Street and the south bank of the Pequabuck River was constructed c.1924. To the southeast is a small one-story, storage shed built during the same period. On the north side of the Pequabuck is a one-story brick structure likely constructed during the 1940s.

From culture to culture, perceptions about women and related gender expectations differ greatly. In recent years, there has been a great shift in attitudes towards women globally as society critically examines the role that women should play, and the value that women have. Attitude towards woman scale The Attitude Towards Women Scale was created in 1972 by Dr. Janet T. Spence and Dr. Robert Helmreich. This scale consisted of 55 items that gauged attitudes of American undergraduate college students, both male and female, towards gender roles. Since 1970, both men and women have demonstrated a more liberal attitude, meaning they perceive the role of women as more equal to that of man than they did in 1970. Culture is suggestive of how students will respond, with Southern students more likely to reflect a more traditional or conservative attitude. The scale has received criticism in that it evaluates attitudes towards equal rights for women rather than just the participants' feelings towards women. Historical influences on Attitudes towards women= Women and family  One of the most profound differences between men and women is the role each plays in reproduction. Menstruation and gestation have historically influenced and limited the role that women played in society. In some societies, a woman's value was measured in her ability to bear children, and raising children became the focus of many women's lives. However, in the twentieth century, these issues have been alleviated by several factors. First, a shift from an agrarian to an industrial society meant that people began having children at much lower rates, and women played an increasingly important role in the labor force. Secondly, advocates for contraception, such as Margaret Sanger, transformed the lives of women everywhere by giving them control over when and how often they would give birth. Gradually, these changes led to a shift in attitude where women were viewed as an integral part of the workforce and began to gain equality with men. Women gained substantial respect in the workforce and increased participation in education in the last decades of the 20th century. Even still, a 1991 study employing data from the 1988 International Social Survey Program (ISSP) showed both men and women in West Germany, Great Britain and the United States preferred a primary familial role for women when they have young children.

The dessert dates back to the Spanish colonial period. It is one of the desserts believed to have been the result of the repurposing of the discarded egg yolks from the use of egg whites for mortar and plaster in Spanish colonial architecture. Description Unlike other types of Filipino pianonos which are made with rolled chiffon or sponge cakes, brazo de Mercedes is made from meringue and thus does not use flour. The meringue is made from egg whites, cream of tartar, and granulated sugar. The filling is traditionally custard made from egg yolks, sugar, and milk cooked in low heat in a double boiler. Other ingredients like calamansi zest, butter, and vanilla extract can also be added to the custard. Once the meringue is baked, the custard is spread evenly on one surface then it is carefully rolled into a cylinder. It is usually chilled and dusted with powdered sugar before being served.

The international school was founded in 1991. It uses a North American curriculum as its academic foundation while also incorporating selected international curricula for its culturally diverse students. The school groups its educational levels into nursery, kindergarten, elementary, middle, and high school levels. Teachers come from Asia, America, Australia, Africa, and Thailand. NIVA celebrated its 25-year anniversary in 2016 and will celebrate its 30th anniversary on 2021.  History  NIVA was first established in September 1991 as a private non-church affiliated Seventh-day Adventist (SDA) Christian school named NIVA Overseas School (NOS). There were only six international schools in Thailand at that time. NOS restricted its admissions to international students and overseas Thai students. In August 1997, NIVA extended its operation by opening NIVA International Kindergarten (NIK). Five years later, in 2002, NOS and NIK were merged and relocated to the present site as NIVA International School. In 2018 after providing American-based education for fifteen years, the school was rebranded and the name was changed to NIVA American International School  Name  The name ‚ÄúNIVA‚Äù was coined from the first two letters of Nicholas and Vanisara, the children of the school‚Äôs founders. The current meaning of ‚ÄúNIVA‚Äù stands for Nurturing, Innovative, Virtuous, and Achieving: the hallmarks of NIVA American International School.  Curriculum  Originally a British curriculum school, Niva first offered private studies to overseas students who wanted to sit for the International General Certificate of Secondary Education examinations, though in time, it expanded to include younger students. Over time, it incorporated American and other international elements in its program. In 2004, the Thai Ministry of Education approved the school's American curriculum from Kindergarten through grade 12, allowing its students to follow an American/International path to graduation.

For the left and right bands of the sound content, there are a series of vertical faders, which can be used to boost or cut specific frequency ranges. This equalizer is set to the widely used \\"happy face\\" setting, in which the mid-range sound frequencies are cut. Equalizers are also made in compact pedal-style effect units for use by electric guitarists. This pedal is a parametric equalizer. Equalization or equalisation is the process of adjusting the balance between frequency components within an electronic signal. The most well known use of equalization is in sound recording and reproduction but there are many other applications in electronics and telecommunications. The circuit or equipment used to achieve equalization is called an equalizer. These devices strengthen or weaken the energy of specific frequency bands or \\"frequency ranges\\". In sound recording and reproduction, equalization is the process commonly used to alter the frequency response of an audio system using linear filters. Most hi-fi equipment uses relatively simple filters to make bass and treble adjustments. Graphic and parametric equalizers have much more flexibility in tailoring the frequency content of an audio signal. Since equalizers \\"adjust the amplitude of audio signals at particular frequencies,\\" they are, \\"in other words, frequency-specific volume knobs.\\" In the field of audio electronics, the term \\"equalization\\" (or \\"EQ\\") has come to include the adjustment of frequency responses for practical or aesthetic reasons, often resulting in a net response that is not actually \\"flat\\". The term EQ specifically refers to this variant of the term.Ballou, pp.875-876. Stereos and basic guitar amplifiers typically have adjustable equalizers which boost or cut bass or treble frequencies. Mid- to high-priced guitar and bass amplifiers usually have more bands of frequency control, such as bass, mid-range and treble or bass, low- mid, high-mid, and treble. Some amps have an additional knob for controlling very high frequencies. Broadcast and recording studios use sophisticated equalizers capable of much more detailed adjustments, such as eliminating unwanted sounds or making certain instruments or voices more prominent. Equalizers are used in recording studios, radio studios and production control rooms, and live sound reinforcement and in instrument amplifiers, such as guitar amplifiers, to correct or adjust the response of microphones, instrument pick-ups, loudspeakers, and hall acoustics. Equalization may also be used to eliminate or reduce unwanted sounds (e.g., low hum coming from a guitar amplifier), make certain instruments or voices more (or less) prominent, enhance particular aspects of an instrument's tone, or combat feedback (howling) in a public address system. Equalizers are also used in music production to adjust the timbre of individual instruments and voices by adjusting their frequency content and to fit individual instruments within the overall frequency spectrum of the mix. The most common equalizers in music production are parametric, semi-parametric, graphic, peak, and program equalizers. Graphic equalizers are often included in consumer audio equipment and software which plays music on home computers. Parametric equalizers require more expertise than graphic equalizers, and they can provide more specific compensation or alteration around a chosen frequency. This may be used in order to remove unwanted resonances or boost certain frequencies. For example, an acoustic guitarist who finds that their instrument sounds too \\"boomy\\" may ask the audio engineer to cut the low frequencies to correct this issue; or a guitarist who finds that the amplified instrument sound has too much finger noise may ask the engineer to reduce the high frequencies. Terminology The very uneven spectrum of white noise played through imperfect speakers and modified by room acoustics (top) is equalized using a sophisticated filter using digital hardware (bottom). The resulting \\"flat\\" response fails, however, at 71 Hz where the original system had a null in its response which cannot be corrected. The concept of equalization was first applied in correcting the frequency response of telephone lines using passive networks; this was prior to the invention of electronic amplification. Initially equalization was used to \\"compensate for\\" (i.e. correct) the uneven frequency response of an electric system by applying a filter having the opposite response, thus restoring the fidelity of the transmission. A plot of the system's net frequency response would be a flat line, as its response at any frequency would be equal to its response at any other frequency. Hence the term \\"equalization.\\" Much later the concept was applied in audio engineering to adjust the frequency response in recording, reproduction, and live sound reinforcement systems. Sound engineers correct the frequency response of a sound system so that the frequency balance of the music as heard through speakers better matches the original performance picked up by a microphone. Audio amplifiers have long had filters or controls to modify their frequency response. These are most often in the form of variable bass and treble controls (shelving filters), and switches to apply low-cut or high-cut filters for elimination of low frequency \\"rumble\\" and high frequency \\"hiss\\" respectively. Graphic equalizers and other equipment developed for improving fidelity have since been used by recording engineers to modify frequency responses for aesthetic reasons. Hence in the field of audio electronics the term \\"equalization\\" is now broadly used to describe the application of such filters regardless of intent. This broad definition therefore includes all linear filters at the disposal of a listener or engineer. A British EQ or British style equalizer is one with similar properties to those on consoles made in the UK by companies such as Amek, Neve and Soundcraft from the 1950s through to the 1970s. Later on, as other manufacturers started to market their products, these British companies began touting their equalizers as being a cut above the rest. Today, many non-British companies such as Behringer and Mackie advertise British EQ on their equipment. A British style EQ seeks to replicate the qualities of the expensive British mixing consoles. History Filtering audio frequencies dates back at least to acoustic telegraphy and multiplexing in general. Audio electronic equipment evolved to incorporate filtering elements as consoles in radio stations began to be used for recording as much as broadcast. Early filters included basic bass and treble controls featuring fixed frequency centers, and fixed levels of cut or boost. These filters worked over broad frequency ranges. Variable equalization in audio reproduction was first used by John Volkman working at RCA in the 1920s. That system was used to equalize a motion picture theater sound playback system.H. Tremaine, Audio Cyclopedia, 2nd. Ed., (H.W. Sams, Indianapolis, 1973) The Langevin Model EQ-251A was the first equalizer to use slide controls. It featured two passive equalization sections, a bass shelving filter, and a pass band filter. Each filter had switchable frequencies and used a 15-position slide switch to adjust cut or boost. The first true graphic equalizer was the type 7080 developed by Art Davis's Cinema Engineering. It featured 6 bands with a boost or cut range of 8 dB. It used a slide switch to adjust each band in 1 dB steps. Davis's second graphic equalizer was the Altec Lansing Model 9062A EQ. In 1967 Davis developed the first 1/3 octave variable notch filter set, the Altec-Lansing \\"Acousta-Voice\\" system. Daniel N. Flickinger introduced the first parametric equalizer in early 1971. His design leveraged the high performance op-amp of his own design, the 535 series (USPTO #3727896) to achieve filtering circuits that were before impossible. Flickinger's patent (USPTO #3752928) from early in 1971 showed the circuit topology that would come to dominate audio equalization until the present day, as well as the theoretical underpinnings of the elegant circuit. Instead of slide potentiometers working on individual bands of frequency, or rotary switches, Flickinger's circuit allowed completely arbitrary selection of frequency and cut/boost level in three overlapping bands over the entire audio spectrum. Six knobs on his early EQ's would control these sweepable filters. Up to six switches were incorporated to select shelving on the high and low bands, and bypassing for any unused band for the purest signal path. His original model boasts specifications that are seldom met today. Other similar designs appeared soon thereafter from George Massenburg (in 1972) and Burgess McNeal from ITI corp. In May 1972 Massenburg introduced the term Parametric Equalization in a paper presented at the 42nd convention of the Audio Engineering Society. Most channel equalization on mixing consoles made from 1971 to the present day rely upon the designs of Flickinger, Massenburg and McNeal in either semi or fully parametric topology. In the late 1990s and in the 2000s, parametric equalizers became increasingly available as Digital Signal Processing (DSP) equipment, usually in the form of plug-ins for various digital audio workstations. Standalone outboard gear versions of DSP parametric equalizers were also quickly introduced after the software versions and are typically called Digital Parametric Equalizers. Filter types Two first-order shelving filters: a -3 dB bass cut (red), and a +9 dB treble boost (blue) Second-order linear filter functions. Blue: a 9 dB boost at 1 kHz. Red: a 6 dB cut at 100 Hz having a higher Q (sharper bandwidth) Although the range of equalization functions is governed by the theory of linear filters, the adjustment of those functions and the flexibility with which they can be adjusted varies according to the topology of the circuitry and controls presented to the user. Shelving controls are usually simple first-order filter functions which alter the relative gains between frequencies much higher and much lower than the cutoff frequencies. A low shelf, such as the bass control on most hi-fi equipment, is adjusted to affect the gain of lower frequencies while having no effect well above its cutoff frequency. A high shelf, such as a treble control, adjusts the gain of higher frequencies only. These are broad adjustments designed more to increase the listener's satisfaction than to provide actual equalization in the strict sense of the term. A parametric equalizer, on the other hand, has one or more sections each of which implements a second-order filter function. This involves three adjustments: selection of the center frequency (in Hz), adjustment of the Q which determines the sharpness of the bandwidth, and the level or gain control which determines how much those frequencies are boosted or cut relative to frequencies much above or below the center frequency selected. In a semi- parametric equalizer there is no control for the bandwidth (it is preset by the designer) or is only selected between two presets using a switch. In a quasi-parametric equalizer, the bandwidth is depending on the gain level. With rising gain, the bandwidth gets wider. A graphic equalizer also implements second-order filter functions in a more user-friendly manner, but with somewhat less flexibility. This equipment is based on a bank of filters covering the audio spectrum in up to 30 frequency bands. Each second-order filter has a fixed center frequency and Q, but an adjustable level. The user can raise or lower each slider in order to visually approximate a \\"graph\\" of the intended frequency response. Since \\"equalization\\" in the context of audio reproduction is not used strictly to compensate for the deficiency of equipment and transmission channels, the use of high and low pass filters may be mentioned. A high-pass filter modifies a signal only by eliminating lower frequencies. Thus a low-cut or rumble filter is used to remove infrasonic energy from a program which may consume undue amplifier power and cause excessive excursions in (or even damage to) speakers. A low-pass filter only modifies the audio signal by removing high frequencies. Thus a high-cut or hiss filter may be used to remove annoying white noise at the expense of the crispness of the program material. A first-order low or high pass filter has a standard response curve which reduces the unwanted frequencies well above or below the cutoff frequency with a slope of 6 dB per octave. A second-order filter will reduce those frequencies with a slope of 12 dB per octave and moreover may be designed with a higher Q or finite zeros in order to effect an even steeper response around the cutoff frequency. For instance, a second- order low-pass notch filter section only reduces (rather than eliminates) very high frequencies, but has a steep response falling to zero at a specific frequency (the so-called notch frequency). Such a filter might be ideal, for instance, in completely removing the 19 kHz FM stereo subcarrier pilot signal while helping to cut even higher frequency subcarrier components remaining from the stereo demultiplexer. In addition to adjusting the relative amplitude of frequency bands, an audio equalizer may alter the relative phases of those frequencies. While the human ear is not as sensitive to the phase of audio frequencies (involving delays of less than 1/30 second), music professionals may favor certain equalizers because of how they affect the timbre of the musical content by way of audible phase artifacts. High-pass and low-pass filters A high-pass filter is a filter, an electronic circuit or device, that passes higher frequencies well but attenuates (cuts or decreases) lower frequency components. A low-pass filter passes low-frequency components of signals while attenuating higher frequencies. Some audiophiles use a low-pass filter in the signal chain before their subwoofer speaker enclosure, to ensure that only deep bass frequencies reach the subwoofer. In audio applications these are frequently termed \\"low cut\\" and \\"high cut\\" respectively, to emphasize their effect on the original signal. For instance, sometimes audio equipment will include a switch labeled \\"high cut\\" or described as a \\"hiss filter\\" (hiss being high-frequency noise). In the phonograph era, many stereos would include a switch to introduce a high-pass (low cut) filter, often called a \\"rumble filter\\", to eliminate infrasonic frequencies. Shelving filter While high and low pass filters are useful for removing unwanted signal above or below a set frequency, shelving filters can be used to reduce or increase signals above or below a set frequency. Shelving filters are used as common tone controls (bass and treble) found in consumer audio equipment such as home stereos, and on guitar amplifiers and bass amplifiers. These implement a first order response and provide an adjustable boost or cut to frequencies above or lower than a certain point. A high shelf or \\"treble control\\" will have a frequency response H(f) whose square is given by: : H(f)^2 = {{1 + (f/f_z)^2} \\\\over {1 + (f/f_p)^2}} where fp and fz are called the pole and zero frequencies, respectively. Turning down the treble control increases fz and decreases fp so that frequences higher than fp are attenuated. Turning up the treble control increases fp and decreases fz so that frequencies higher than fz are boosted. Setting the treble control at the center sets fz = fp so that H(f)2=1 and the circuit has no effect. At most, the slope of the filter response in the transition region will be 6 dB per octave (thus a doubling of signal voltage and a consequent quadrupling of signal power for every doubling of frequency). Similarly the response of a low shelf (or \\"low shelving or \\"bass control\\") can be represented as : H(f)^2 = (f_z/f_p)^2 \\\\; {{1 + (f/f_z)^2} \\\\over {1 + (f/f_p)^2}} . In this case the inclusion of the leading factor simply indicates that the response at frequencies much higher than fz or fp is unity and that only bass frequencies are affected. A high shelving control in which fz is set to infinity or a low shelve response in which fz is set to zero implements a first order low-pass or high-pass filter respectively. However, usual tone controls have a more limited range, since the purpose is not to eliminate any frequencies but only to achieve a greater balance when, for instance, the treble is lacking and the sound is not crisp. Since the range of possible responses from shelving filters is so limited, some audio engineers considered shelving controls inadequate for equalization tasks. On some bass amps and DI boxes, the units provide both low and high shelving controls and additional equalization controls. Graphic equalizer 400px In the graphic equalizer, the input signal is sent to a bank of filters. Each filter passes the portion of the signal present in its own frequency range or band. The amplitude passed by each filter is adjusted using a slide control to boost or cut frequency components passed by that filter. The vertical position of each slider thus indicates the gain applied at that frequency band, so that the knobs resemble a graph of the equalizer's response plotted versus frequency.UREI graphic and parametric EQs; the device on top is a Power conditioner The number of frequency channels (and therefore each one's bandwidth) affects the cost of production and may be matched to the requirements of the intended application. A car audio equalizer might have one set of controls applying the same gain to both stereo channels for convenience, with a total of five to ten frequency bands. On the other hand, an equalizer for professional live sound reinforcement typically has some 25 to 31 bands, for more precise control of feedback problems and equalization of room modes. Such an equalizer (as shown above) is called a 1/3-octave equalizer (spoken informally as \\"third-octave EQ\\") because the center frequency of its filters are spaced one third of an octave apart, three filters to an octave. Equalizers with half as many filters per octave are common where less precise control is required‚Äîthis design is called a 2/3-octave equalizer. Parametric equalizer The equaliser section from the Audient ASP8024 Mixing console. The upper section has high and low shelving EQ, the lower section has fully parametric EQ. Parametric equalizers are multi-band variable equalizers which allow users to control the three primary parameters: amplitude, center frequency and bandwidth. The amplitude of each band can be controlled, and the center frequency can be shifted, and bandwidth (which is inversely related to \\"Q\\") can be widened or narrowed. Parametric equalizers are capable of making much more precise adjustments to sound than other equalizers, and are commonly used in sound recording and live sound reinforcement. Parametric equalizers are also sold as standalone outboard gear units. A variant of the parametric equalizer is the semi- parametric equalizer, also known as a sweepable filter. It allows users to control the amplitude and frequency, but uses a pre-set bandwidth of the center frequency. In some cases, semi-parametric equalizers allow the user to select between a wide and a narrow preset bandwidth. Filter functions A first order low-pass (high-cut) filter implemented using only a resistor and capacitor. The responses of linear filters are mathematically described in terms of their transfer function or, in layman's terms, frequency response. A transfer function can be decomposed as a combination of first order responses and second order responses (implemented as so-called biquad sections). These can be described according to their so-called pole and zero frequencies, which are complex numbers in the case of second-order responses. First order filters Two first-order shelving filters: a -3dB bass cut (red), and a +9dB treble boost (blue) A first order filter can alter the response of frequencies above and below a point. In the transition region the filter response will have a slope of up to 6 dB per octave. The bass and treble controls in a hi-fi system are each a first order filter in which the balance of frequencies above and below a point are varied using a single knob. A special case of first order filters is a first order high-pass or low-pass filter in which the 6 dB per octave cut of low or high frequencies extends indefinitely. These are the simplest of all filters to implement individually, requiring only a capacitor and resistor. Second order filters Second order filter responses Second order filters are capable of resonance (or anti-resonance) around a particular frequency. The response of a second order filter is specified not only by its frequency but its Q; a higher Q corresponds to a sharper response (smaller bandwidth) around a particular center frequency. For instance, the red response in the accompanying image cuts frequencies around 100 Hz with a higher Q than the blue response which boosts frequencies around 1000 Hz. Higher Q's correspond to resonant behaviour in which the half-power or -3 dB bandwidth, BW, is given by: :BW \\\\ = \\\\ F_0 / Q where F0 is the resonant frequency of the second order filter. BW is the bandwidth expressed in the same frequency unit that F0 is. Low Q filter responses (where Q < ) are not said to be resonant and the above formula for bandwidth does not apply. It is also possible to define the Q of a band-pass function as: :Q \\\\ = \\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2^N}}{2^N - 1} \\\\ = \\\\ \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\sinh\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\ln(2)}{2} N \\\\right)} , where N is the bandwidth in octaves. The reverse mapping is : N \\\\ = \\\\ 2 \\\\log_2\\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{2Q} + \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1}{4Q^2} + 1} \\\\right) \\\\ = \\\\ \\\\frac{2}{\\\\ln(2)} \\\\operatorname{arcsinh}\\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{2Q} \\\\right) . A second-order filter response with Q of less than 1/2 can be decomposed into two first-order filter functions, a low-cut and a high-cut (or boost). Of more interest are resonant filter functions which can boost (or cut) a narrow range of frequencies. In addition to specifying the center frequency F0 and the Q, the specification of the filter's zeros determines how much that frequency band will be boosted (or cut). Thus a parametric equalizer section will have three controls for its center frequency F0, bandwidth or Q, and the amount of boost or cut usually expressed in dB. The range of second-order filter functions is important because any analog filter function can be decomposed into a (usually small) number of these (plus, perhaps, simpler first order responses). These are implemented directly by each section of a parametric equalizer where they are explicitly adjusted. And each element of a graphic equalizer based on a filter bank includes one such element whose Q is not adjustable by the user.  Uses  In sound recording, equalization is used to modify an instrument's sound or make certain instruments and sounds more prominent. For example, a recording engineer may use an equalizer to make some high-pitches in a vocal part louder while making low-pitches in a drum part quieter. Equalization is commonly used to increase the 'depth' of a mix, creating the impression that some sounds in a mono or stereo mix are farther or closer than others, relatively. Equalization is also commonly used to give tracks with similar frequency components complementary spectral contours, known as mirrored equalization. Select components of parts which would otherwise compete, such as bass guitar and kick drum, are boosted in one part and cut in the other, and vice versa, so that they both stand out. Equalizers can correct problems posed by a room's acoustics, as an auditorium will generally have an uneven frequency response especially due to standing waves and acoustic dampening. The frequency response of a room may be analyzed using a spectrum analyzer and a pink noise generator for instance. Then a graphic equalizer can be easily adjusted to compensate for the room's acoustics. Such compensation can also be applied to tweak the sound quality of a recording studio in addition to its use in live sound reinforcement systems and even home hi-fi systems. During live events where signals from microphones are amplified and sent to speaker systems, equalization is not only used to \\"flatten\\" the frequency response but may also be useful in eliminating feedback. When the sound produced by the speakers is picked up by a microphone, it is further reamplified; this recirculation of sound can lead to \\"howling\\" requiring the sound technician to reduce the gain for that microphone, perhaps sacrificing the contribution of a singer's voice for instance. Even at a slightly reduced gain, the feedback will still cause an unpleasant resonant sound around the frequency at which it would howl. But because the feedback is troublesome at a particular frequency, it is possible to cut the gain only around that frequency while preserving the gain at most other frequencies. This can best be done using a parametric equalizer tuned to that very frequency with its amplitude control sharply reduced. By adjusting the equalizer for a narrow bandwidth (high Q), most other frequency components will not be affected. The extreme case when the signal at the filter's center frequency is completely eliminated is known as a notch filter. An equalizer can be used to correct or modify the frequency response of a speaker system rather than designing the speaker itself to have the desired response. For instance, the Bose 901 speaker system does not use separate larger and smaller drivers to cover the bass and treble frequencies. Instead it uses nine drivers all of the same four-inch diameter, more akin to what one would find in a table radio. However, this speaker system is sold with an active equalizer. That equalizer must be inserted into the amplifier system so that the amplified signal that is finally sent to the speakers has its response increased at the frequencies where the response of these drivers falls off, and vice versa, producing the response intended by the manufacturer.Stereophile magazine, Bose 901 Loudspeaker Review, 1995. Tone controls (usually designated \\"bass\\" and \\"treble\\") are simple shelving filters included in most hi-fi equipment for gross adjustment of the frequency balance. The bass control may be used, for instance, to increase the drum and bass parts at a dance party, or to reduce annoying bass sounds when listening to a person speaking. The treble control might be used to give the percussion a sharper or more \\"brilliant\\" sound, or can be used to cut such high frequencies when they have been overemphasized in the program material or simply to accommodate a listener's preference. A \\"rumble filter\\" is a high pass (low cut) filter with a cutoff typically in the 20 to 40 Hz range; this is the low frequency end of human hearing. \\"Rumble\\" is a type of low frequency noise produced in record players and turntables, particularly older or low quality models. The rumble filter prevents this noise from being amplified and sent to the loudspeakers. Some cassette decks have a switchable \\"subsonic Filter\\" feature that does the same thing for recordings. A crossover network is a system of filters designed to direct electrical energy separately to the woofer and tweeter of a 2-way speaker system (and also to the mid-range speaker of a 3-way system). This is most often built into the speaker enclosure and hidden from the user. However, in bi-amplification, these filters operate on the low level audio signals, sending the low and high frequency components to separate amplifiers which connect to the woofers and tweeters respectively. Equalization is used in a reciprocal manner in certain communication channels and recording technologies. The original music is passed through a particular filter to alter its frequency balance, followed by the channel or recording process. At the end of the channel or when the recording is played, a complementary filter is inserted which precisely compensates for the original filter and recovers the original waveform. For instance, FM broadcast uses a pre-emphasis filter to boost the high frequencies before transmission, and every receiver includes a matching de- emphasis filter to restore it. The white noise that is introduced by the radio is then also de-emphasized at the higher frequencies (where it is most noticeable) along with the pre-emphasized program, making the noise less audible. Tape recorders used the same trick to reduce \\"tape hiss\\" while maintaining fidelity. On the other hand, in the production of vinyl records, a filter is used to reduce the amplitude of low frequencies which otherwise produce large amplitudes on the tracks of a record. Then the groove can take up less physical space, fitting more music on the record. The preamp attached to the phono cartridge has a complementary filter boosting those low frequencies following the standard RIAA equalization curve.

Dmitry Nikolaevich Shipov (14 May 1851 ‚Äì 14 January 1920) was a Russian liberal Slavophile politician of the 19th and 20th century.Figes, pp. 164‚Äì5 Shipov acted as a political mentor of Georgy Lvov, Russia's future first Prime Minister.Figes, p. 194 Biography=Early life Shipov was a graduate of St. Petersburg University. He was elected Chairman of Volokolamsk Uezd Zemstvo Board in 1891, and of Moscow Gubernia Zemstvo Board in 1900. Shipov was a deep conservative Christian.Pipes, p. 172 Career Dmitry Shipov organised the zemstvos at a national level. Despite the zemstvos crucial role in bringing about the 1905 Revolution, the zemstvo men being 'unlikely pioneers', Shipov himself was strongly opposed to the demands for a constitution by the liberals, and was himself a devoted monarchist. He saw it as his mission to strengthen the Tsar's autocracy by bringing the Sovereign 'closer to his people', organised through the zemstvos and a consultative parliament. He believed in a Russia which was a 'locally self-governing land with an autocratic Sovereign at its head', and was a believer in the ancient 'communion' between the Tsar and his subjects, a union he viewed only had been broken by the 'autocracy of bureaucracy'. He argued for more political and civil liberties, but also viewed Tsarism as morally superior to democracy.Pipes, p. 171 He viewed the state as an 'indispensable institution for the realisation of Christian ideals'. Despite his views, he was respected even by those who disagreed with him in the zemstvos, and was the unchallenged leader of the conservative wing in the zemstvo movement.Pipes, p. 173 He was the founder of the All-Zemstvo Organization, which was banned shortly after it was founded in 1896. This drove the 'reluctant revolutionary' Shipov into the ranks of the more 'radical constitutionalists'. He was one of the founders of Beseda in 1899, which was a clandestine discussion circle which consisted of some of the most prominent members of the Russian aristocracy, among them his friend Prince Georgy Lvov. After initially limiting the topic of discussion strictly to the affairs of the zemstvos. After the resumed persecution of the zemstvos from 1900, however, it became an arena for political discussion. It would from 1900 become the 'leading force in the constitutional movement'. He was elected chairman in the first Zemstvo Assembly from 6‚Äì9 November 1904 during the Zemstvo Congress (almost unanimously), when 103 representatives of the zemstvos assembled in various buildings, after finally getting a reluctant Pyotr Dmitrievich Sviatopolk-Mirsky to give permission for their assembly. This was 'in effect' the first national assembly of Russia, and it was compared to the Etats Generaux of 1789 in France. Over 5000 congratulatory arrived the assembly from all over the country, despite Mirsky's ban on publicity.Figes, p. 172 He failed to persuade the Zemstvo Congress of appealing for a consultative rather than legislative representative parliament, and the motion was voted down three-to-one. This caused a split in the liberal movement, between the majority going on to form Constitutional- Democratic Party (\\"Kadets\\"), and the minority founding the Union of October 17 (\\"Octobrists\\") Shipov was one of the principal founders of the Octobrist Party, who uttered 'declarations of loyal support' to the Tsar and government in the wake of the Tsar's October Manifesto. When the first cabinet government was to be gathered in October 1905, Sergey Witte offered Shipov the position of Ministry of Agriculture. He, among other liberals, refused the offer. He later joined the Party of Peaceful Renovation in 1908. He was elected member of the State Council by Moscow zemstvo (1907‚Äì1909). Russian Revolution and Death He was part of the member of the National Center after the Bolshevik Revolution. For this, he was arrested by the Cheka on the grounds of being a counterrevolutionary. He was imprisoned by the Bolsheviks in Butyrka prison in 1919. He died January the following year. ReferencesBibliography  V.I. Gurko. Features And Figures Of The Past.

The school opened in 1998 and closed in 2015. It received accreditation in 2001 as a college preparatory high school. The school was located on a 5-acre site near 19th Avenue and Northern in Phoenix, with student housing adjacent to the campus. The school was an International Baccalaureate World School from 2010 until its closure. It also had an international division approved with SEVIS, and 20% of its students attended on a tuition basis. Basketball In 2007, WPA added a basketball post grad program (sometimes known as a prep program) designed to help basketball players further develop athletically and academically before starting their university experience. Student athletes are required to take academic classes either at the high school level or dual enrollment college classes, in addition to their training and competition. In 2009, WPA's prep program was ranked 6th in the country by ESPN. To date, three WPA alumni have gone on to the NBA: Greg Smith, Jamaal Franklin and Tony Snell. Alum Kiwi Gardner is currently playing in the NBA D-League. Over 45 WPA alumni have gone on to play at the collegiate level. During the 2012‚Äì13 season, there were only two Chinese players competing at the Division One level, one of which, Ted Wang, is a WPA alumni. During the 2015‚Äì2016 season, most notably Bo Barnes (ASU), Que Johnson (WSU), and Gary Payton II (Oregon State) are playing for Division I schools. The international facet of the school received attention in 2011 after the school's basketball team won the Arizona Interscholastic Association 2A state title. The composition of the team was heavily international. The situation with Westwind and The Orme School of Arizona prompted changes in AIA policies about international students on sports teams. In its final few years, Westwind Prep moved to the Canyon Athletic Association, which allows international students to compete in athletics. Closure Westwind was shuttered after the 2014‚Äì2015 school year due to low enrollment. As of 2019, the entire site where the school once stood has been completely demolished, making way for new developments in the area.AGENDA ITEM: Surrender Agreement ‚Äì Westwind Children's Services, ASBCS, 2015 References Category:Public high schools in Arizona Category:High schools in Phoenix, Arizona Category:Charter schools in Arizona Category:Defunct schools in Arizona ","title":"Westwind Preparatory Academy"},{"id":"31571873","title":"Local government in California"},{"id":"31571889","text":"Westwind Children's Services is a nonprofit operator of several charter schools in the state of Arizona, founded in 1996.

Hunter had resigned a reserve infantry commission in 1933 when he could not obtain an appointment in the Sanitary Corps Reserve in spite of a Ph.D. in parasitology and microbiology. Hunter suggested using the outline of the course as the basis for a textbook. It was published by the National Research Council in 1945 as the Manual of Tropical Medicine and became the standard reference in its field. Hunter's name was not listed first among the principal authors because the company believed that a physician's name would improve sales, but it was retitled Hunter's Tropical Medicine in later editions. With the printing of the sixth edition in 1984, Hunter, then a professor in the School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, was recognized as \\"the glue that has held this book together from the very first edition.\\"Book idea: Hunter, Ginn telephone interv 1 Feb 86.

Hunter III, MSC, gained international recognition for his work with schistosomiasis. United States forces occupying Japan required food handlers to be free of parasites, and Hunter fielded a mobile laboratory outfitted in railroad cars that tested nearly nineteen thousand Japanese over a four-month period in 1949. The researchers found that 93.2 percent of those tested were infected with some form of intestinal parasite. Demand always creates a supply, and the team also found that there was a black market for parasite- free stools. One of the parasitic diseases was schistosomiasis, a disabling and potentially fatal disease. Hunter concentrated his research effort on that endemic problem, and by 1951 his team had eliminated it in the Nagatoishi district of Kurume City, Japan, using a landmark program of molluscicides to control the snail host. Japan adopted Hunter's methods and by 1970 had virtually eliminated the disease. Hunter became a public figure in Japan, and in 1952 the townspeople of Kurume erected a bust of him as a permanent tribute to their \\"great benefactor.\\"Hunter's team: Speech, Yamashita Kuranosuke, Chief, Construction Committee for Hunter Statue, sub: Congratulatory Address, Kurume City Hall, 15 Jul 52 (translation), DASG-MS; George W.

To divert the American convoy into the path of the kaiten, Cdr. Oba released a dummy mine which was observed and engaged by the guns of Underhill. After several direct hits, the mine was determined to be a dud by the Americans and they continued on with their patrol. At this time, one of the submarine chasers lost power and had to be towed by PCE-872. Shortly thereafter, a sonar contact was made, so Underhill and PC-804 began depth charging the area. The destroyer escort is credited with sinking one of the kaiten at this point while another attacked PC-804. It missed the chaser and the kaiten turned around for a surface attack on Underhill. But as soon as the mini submarine was out of water, Lt. Cdr. Newcomb ordered a ramming maneuver because the kaiten was too close for his guns to bear. Underhill then sailed right over the kaiten and it exploded at 15:15 along with the escort's boilers and readied ammunition. Underhill was torn in two, the bow section of the ship quickly sank with all hands, the aft section remained afloat until being sunk by American gunfire the following day. All 122 survivors were wounded in action and each sailor received a Purple Heart. Lt. Cdr. Newcomb was killed and he was posthumously awarded the Silver Star. Two of the remaining American warships depth charged the area for an hour after Underhill was destroyed, but I-53 escaped and arrived back in Japan a month later, just before the end of the war. The last of the American survivors were picked up after at least an hour of being in the water though rescue operations continued until 18:30 that night. Most of the survivors were in need of urgent medical assistance which they received on PC-803 and . The engagement was one of the last in the Pacific War and was one of the few victories of the Japanese kaiten program.http://combinedfleet.com/ships/kaitenhttp://www.ussunderhill.org/html/about_uss_underhill.html See also *Kamikaze *USS Mississinewa (AO-59) * References Category:Naval battles of World War II involving the United States Category:Naval battles of World War II involving Japan Category:Submarine warfare in World War II Category:July 1945 events ","title":"Action of 24 July 1945"},{"id":"31571981","text":" Islam  Lala Mustafa Pasha Mosque in Famagusta Muslims make up about 99% of the Northern Cypriot population. Talip Atalay is the current Head of The Department of Religious Affairs of Northern Cyprus (DRA). There are 7 representatives of the Department: 5 of them in the 5 districts of Northern Cyprus, one in Lefka village, one in the south part of the Cyprus.The Department of Religious Affairs of Northern Cyprus Islam was first introduced to Cyprus when Uthman, the third Caliph of the Arab Rashidun Empire, conquered the island in 649. Cyprus remained a disputed territory between the Greeks and Arabs for the following centuries, until it passed to Latin authority during the Crusades. The island was conquered by the Ottoman general Lala Mustafa Pasha from the Venetians in 1570. This conquest brought with it Turkish settlement from 1571 until 1878. During the 17th century especially, the Muslim population of the island grew rapidly, partly because of Turkish immigrants but also due to Greek converts to Islam. Turkish Cypriots are the overwhelming majority of the island's Muslims, along with Turkish settlers from Turkey and adhere to the Sunni branch of Islam. Sufism also plays an important role. Historically, Muslims were spread over the whole of Cyprus, but since 1974 they have lived primarily in the north. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community itself has a presence in north. Several important Islamic shrines and landmarks exist on the island including: * The Arabahmet Mosque in Nicosia (built in the 16th century) * The Hala Sultan Tekke/Umm Haram Mosque in Larnaca (built in the 18th century) * The Lala Mustafa Pasha Mosque, Selimiye Mosque and the Haydarpasha Mosque; former Catholic cathedrals left from the Crusader era, which were meant to cater exclusively to the Catholic minority which ruled the island and were converted to mosques after the Muslim conquest in the Middle Ages. All of the listed, apart from the Hala Sultan Tekke, are in Northern Cyprus. Christianity Locations of the remaining predominantly Orthodox Greek Cypriots and Catholic Maronite Cypriots in Northern Cyprus. Orthodoxy Orthodox Christians in Northern Cyprus make up 0.5% of the population. The Greek Cypriots are members of the Autocephalous Greek Orthodox Church of Cyprus (Church of Cyprus). In addition to the Orthodox Christian and Sunni Muslim communities, there is also small Maronite (Eastern Rites Catholic) community. In Northern Cyprus are the historical churches of Notre Dame de Tyre in Nicosia (1308) and Ganchvor in Famagusta (1346). Maronite Church Out of 209,286 Cypriots 1,131 were Maronites in 1891. The Maronites were 2,752 in 1960, in four villages all situated in currently Northern Cyprus. The origin of the Maronite Church is Lebanon. The others Turkish Cypriot Protestants and Anglicans are a very small community. The leader and Pastor of the community is Kemal Ba≈üaran. The vast majority are Anglican and use Anglican churches in the Kyrenia area along with the island's British expatriate community.

It runs mostly along the Freiberger Mulde from Borsdorf via D√∂beln and Meissen to Coswig near Dresden. It is part of a long-distance connection from Leipzig to Dresden, but is now used for local traffic only. History  Meissen had been linked since 1 December 1860 to the Leipzig‚ÄìDresden railway by a branch line from Coswig. On 7 July 1864 the Leipzig‚ÄìDresden Railway Company ( submitted an application to build a second rail link between Leipzig and Dresden. It provided for a route along the Freiberger Mulde from D√∂beln to Meissen to connect with the existing branch line from Coswig. On 16 January 1866 the company was granted a concession for the construction of the line. Work began on 4 August 1865 near Borsdorf. The line was opened as follows: *14 May 1866: Borsdorf‚ÄìGrimma *27 October 1867: Grimma‚ÄìLeisnig *2 June 1868: Leisnig‚ÄìD√∂beln *25 October 1868: D√∂beln‚ÄìNossen *22 December 1868: Nossen‚ÄìMeissen On 1 July 1876, the Leipzig-Dresden Railway Company was nationalized and the line was then controlled by the Royal Saxon State Railways. Between 1898 and 1909, the Borsdorf‚ÄìGro√übothen and D√∂beln‚ÄìCoswig sections were duplicated. Duplication was also later started between Gro√übothen and D√∂beln, but only the Gro√übothen‚ÄìTanndorf section was completed because of the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. Meissen Elbe bridge (in background) S-Bahn in Meissen One of the largest construction projects of the interwar period was the rebuilding of the bridge over the Elbe in Meissen. Between 1925 and 1926, the Lauchhammer-Rheinmetall company rebuilt it with a new steel truss superstructure. The bridge escaped demolition in 1945, so the original bridge is now preserved, but it has only had a single track since 1946. After the Second World War one track of the line was dismantled to provide reparations to the Soviet Union. In 1970, the Coswig‚ÄìMeissen- Triebischtal section was electrified for Dresden suburban services. On 18 December 1970, electric train operations started. A little later‚Äîin September 1973‚Äîthe section was included in the network of the newly established Dresden S-Bahn. After that all rail services were broken in Meissen, with services operating between the Leipzig and Meissen and between Meissen‚ÄìTriebischtal and Dresden, requiring a change of trains. Even express trains on the line only ran between Leipzig and Meissen. In December 1981, the second track was returned to service between Meissen and Coswig. In 1989, the short Borsdorf‚ÄìBeucha section was electrified. On 30 September 1989, the electrical equipment on this section was removed. A completely new situation emerged after the political changes in East Germany in 1989‚Äì90. For the first time in decades express trains ran between Leipzig and Dresden via D√∂beln. Together with the two S-Bahn services every hour between Leipzig and Meissen there were hourly express services. The Dresden S-Bahn service ‚Äî now running as line S1 (Meissen-Triebischtal‚ÄìSch√∂na) ‚Äî operated after that at continuous 30-minute intervals from Meissen through Coswig to Dresden and Sch√∂na. Only in 2000, with the formation of the transport authorities of the Verkehrsverbund Oberelbe (Upper Elbe Transport Authority) and the Mitteldeutscher Verkehrsverbund (Central Germany Transport Authority), was this timetable abandoned. The express trains, which last ran between Leipzig and Zittau, were cancelled on 9 June 2001. The line was broken at several points between Gro√übothen and Coswig during the flood in August 2002. The most serious cases were with damage between Tanndorf and Leisnig. In addition to several smaller damaged areas, a total of 500 metres of track including the railway embankment were completely destroyed at Tanndorf. The line was restored to use on 21 August 2004. According to a town council, the federal government had invested ‚Ç¨45 million in the line after the 2002 floods. Trains crossing in Nossen By December 2015, the service consisted of Regionalbahn trains running at two- hour intervals between Leipzig and Mei√üen, with additional trains providing an hourly services in the morning and afternoon peaks. Outside of the peaks and on the weekend, the hourly service from Leipzig ends in Grimma. Siemens Desiro Classic diesel multiple units are used; at peak times running in double sets. The Symmetry minute of the timetable is between Leipzig and Nossen about three minutes earlier than usual, so that the transfer times of trains running in one direction and trains running in the other direction at crossing points, e.g. in Leipzig, may differ by up to eight minutes. Other trains run on weekdays in the morning and late afternoon in an alternating cycle between Leipzig and Grimma. In freight transport the line does not have much significance any more. This is essentially limited to the operation of the Rh√§sa tank farm on the former line to Riesa. The newly built two-track section between Mei√üen Altstadt and Mei√üen (November 2013) On 2 May 2010, the first construction phase of the electronic interlocking (Elektronischen Stellwerk, ESTW) Mulde Valley (ESTW Muldental) was put into operation with the ESTW-A Gro√übothen and the ESTW-A Leisnig. They are controlled from the sub-center in Geithain, which has been converted into an ESTW-Z control centre. At the end of July 2012 the connection of the Gro√üsteinberg and Grimma ob Bf stations to the ESTW Muldental was completed. Naunhof station was integrated into the ESTW Muldental at the end of November 2013 after the construction of a second outside platform in the autumn of 2013. On 9 August 2015, Borsdorf-Naunhof was included as the last section of the ESTW with the converted Beucha station. The Upper Elbe Transport Association (Verkehrsverbund Oberelbe, VVO) has been considering the permanent closure of local rail services between Nossen and Mei√üen-Triebischtal since autumn 2010. A citizens' initiative collected 14,000 signatures to maintain services on the route in 2010. According to the citizens' initiative, more than 1,000 passengers per day were counted on the section of the line in 2001; the count was 400 at the beginning of 2014. Meanwhile, the direct connections to Dresden had been lost and the hourly service had been reduced to a two-hourly service. On 3 June 2013, the service between Gro√übothen and Mei√üen had to be stopped due to a flood. After repairing the damage, train traffic between D√∂beln and Mei√üen-Triebischtal was resumed on 8 June 2013. In 2013, the upgrade of the section used by the S-Bahn Dresden was carried out, which involved blockading of the line between Mei√üen Triebischtal and Mei√üen. The new Mei√üen Altstadt station was built near the centre of Mei√üen. In addition, the second track was restored in the section between Mei√üen Altstadt and Mei√üen. With the completion of the work, the S1 service to Mei√üen-Triebischtal was restored on 30 November 2013. From November 2013 to mid-2014, the line between Gro√übothen and Leisnig was interrupted for the reconstruction of the viaduct across a gully near K√∂ssern. On the affected section, there was a substitute bus. On 28 November 2013, the board of the VVO decided to discontinue the RB 110 passenger service between Mei√üen and Nossen for economic reasons from December 2015 and replace it with buses. With an average of 13 passengers per train, the section between Nossen and Mei√üen was among the most vulnerable in the VVO area; since 2012, passenger numbers have continued to decline. With the replacement of the trains by an \\"optimised bus network\\", the VVO hoped for a significant reduction in the subsidy requirement. The VVO estimated the cost of maintaining traffic at ‚Ç¨1.6 million per year. An investigation of the expansion of the railway services showed that it would have doubled passenger numbers and tripled the subsidies required. On 7 March 2014, the Verkehrsverbund Mittelsachsen (Mid-Saxon transport association) decided not to run services between D√∂beln and Nossen from December 2015 onwards. Recently, 200 to 300 passengers per day had used the trains. The association also decided to establish a new D√∂beln K√∂rnerplatz station near the centre of D√∂beln. A citizens' initiative had collected 7,000 signatures against the closure plans by March 2014. On 12 December 2015, the RB 110 service ended on the Mei√üen Triebischtal-D√∂beln section. Prospects The Zweckverband f√ºr den Nahverkehrsraum Leipzig (\\"Joint Association for regional transport in the Leipzig area\\", ZVNL) will continue to procure local rail services between Leipzig and D√∂beln. On 17 September 2015, the ZVNL also published a change to the invitation to tender for the Dieselnetz Nordwestsachsen / Teil B (\\"Diesel network Northwest Saxony/part B\\"), which covers transports services from 12 June 2016 to 13 December 2025, to include services to D√∂beln-Zentrum station. Politicians and citizens advertise in a position paper that the passenger services should be extended to Ro√üwein instead of D√∂beln-Zentrum, as this was possible in the planned working timetable. In the 1980s the integration of Grimma into the then Leipzig S-Bahn network was planned, but this failed because of the low clearance of the A 14 overbridge. In 2009 the A 14 bridge was rebuilt higher, so the possibility was again considered in 2012. The Saxon Minister of Economic Affairs, Sven Morlok, however, has stated that the integration was not to be expected before 2025.  New infrastructure operator  On 28 June 2013 DB Netz AG offered the 37.1 kilometre section of the line between D√∂beln, Nossen and Mei√üen-Triebischtal for sale or rent due to the line's poor returns. According to these figures, it incurred annual infrastructure revenues of around ‚Ç¨1.3 million while its costs amounted to ‚Ç¨2.3 million (approximately ‚Ç¨1.4 million for staff and ‚Ç¨0.8 million for maintenance). Between 2014 and 2018, investment of around ‚Ç¨24.8 million would also be expected. The sale price was ‚Ç¨627,990 (net) and the annual rent was ‚Ç¨50,239. DB Netz decided in the middle of 2015 to transfer this section to the Nossen-Riesaer Eisenbahn-Compagnie GmbH (\\"Nossen-Riesa Railway Company\\", NRE) as railway infrastructure owner. The company is already a tenant of the Nossen‚ÄìRiesa and Nossen‚ÄìAusschlichstelle Rh√§sa (to the Neubodenbach tank farm) sections. The transfer, which was originally scheduled for 13 December 2015, was delayed until 16 April 2016, after an earlier delay to February 2016, announced in 2015. The NRE intends to operate the D√∂beln‚ÄìMei√üen‚ÄìTriebischtal section using the Direct traffic control operating procedure.  Route description= Course The line branches off at Borsdorf towards the southeast from the Leipzig‚ÄìDresden Railway and runs without sharp curves through agricultural areas. The line then passes through Beucha and the branch to the Beucha-Trebsen railway, which is only used for freight, and under the A14 and goes through the landscape protection area of the Naunhofer Forst (Naunhof forest), while on the eastern side is a recreational area with lakes in old quarries. The line crossed the newly built bypass road B 107n before Grimma, where it reaches the course of the Mulde for the first time. Before Gro√übothen the northern part of the landscape protection area of the Colditzer Forst (Colditz forest) is crossed, before the 1.5 kilometre-long station operating facilities are reached and federal highway 107 is crossed. The Glauchau‚ÄìWurzen railway, which crosses the Borsdorf-Coswig line at the exit from the station and runs parallel for about one kilometre, begins on the north side of the Inselbahnhof (\\"island\\" station building, that is, surrounded by rail tracks) before heading south to Colditz. Near K√∂ssern, the line changes for the first time to the north bank of the Mulde, until it changes back to the south near R√∂da. At the exit from Leisnig station, the line returns to the northern bank and then runs through the landscape protection area of Freiberger Mulde-Zschopau. After about 400 metres, the ruins of the Buch Abbey (Kloster Buch) are passed before the line switches again to the south side of the Freiberger Mulde at the mouth of the Zschopau. Before D√∂beln, the line crosses the line from Chemnitz together with federal highway 169. The line leaves the Keilbahnhof (\\"wedge station\\") of D√∂beln in a southeastern direction and crosses the southern urban area, while the Riesa line branches off to the northeast. Federal highway 175 is crossed at the station exit. The line crosses the narrowing valley of the Freiberger Mulde several times after D√∂beln Zentrum station. After Niederstriegis, the dismantled line of the former Ro√üwein‚ÄìNiederwiesa railway approaches and follows the Borsdorf‚ÄìCoswig railway for about two kilometres to Ro√üwein station. After crossing and recrossing the Freiberger Mulde, the connecting line from the Rh√§sa tank farm approaches from the north and the two lines runs parallel past the Altzella Abbey (Kloster Altzella) and meet the Zellwald railway, which comes from the south, pass under the B 175 and enter Nossen station. The line crosses federal highway 101 at a level crossing and passes along a sloping section and reaches the Meissen highland in the Waldhufendorf (\\"forest village\\") of Eula. From Deutschebora, the highest point, the line turns north-east, crosses the A 14 and turns into the landscape protection area of the valley of the Triebisch. From here, it follows the river through the Garsebacher Schweiz (\\"Garsebach Switzerland\\") over a length of about 10 kilometres, past the G√∂tterfelsen (\\"God's rocks\\"), which rise 60 metres above the valley, to Mei√üen-Triebischtal station, where the wiring for the Dresden S-Bahn begins. After crossing the Elbe together with federal highway 6 and passing through Meissen station, the now two-track line turns south-east, rules through a sparsely-built flatland and rejoins the Leipzig‚ÄìDresden railway between Weinb√∂hla and Coswig.  Operating points Grimma ob Bf () Grimma ob station Grimma ob Bf was opened on 1 June 1866 with the name Grimma. After the opening of the Gro√übothen‚ÄìWurzen section of the Glauchau‚ÄìWurzen railway (Mulde Valley Railway) in 1877, the Grimma station was renamed Grimma ob Bf (short for oberer Bahnhof‚Äî\\"upper station\\") since the Mulde Valley Railway had a station in the town on the right bank of the Mulde called Grimma unt Bf (short for unterer Bahnhof‚Äî\\"lower station\\"). With the discontinuation of rail traffic on the Mulde Valley Railway (Grimma unt Bf‚ÄìNerchau section) in 1967, Grimma ob Bf is the only railway station in the town. Gro√übothen () } Gro√übothen station was opened in 1867 with the Grimma‚ÄìLeisnig section of the Borsdorf‚ÄìCoswig railway of the Leipzig‚ÄìDresden Railway Company. Although the station is in the Kleinbothen area, it was initially planned as the ‚Äústation for Colditz in Gro√übothen‚Äù. The connection to Colditz was made by stagecoach. With the opening of the Glauchau‚ÄìWurzen railway (9 December 1875: Rochlitz‚ÄìGro√übothen section; 30 June 1877: Gro√übothen‚ÄìWurzen section), Gro√übothen became a railway junction and the entrance building was built as an Inselbahnhof (\\"island\\" station building) at that time. On the north side are the tracks of the Glauchau‚ÄìWurzen railway and on the south side are the tracks of the Borsdorf‚ÄìCoswig railway. Already at that time, the Borna‚ÄìGro√übothen railway was planned, although it was only opened in 1937 after a long construction period. After the commissioning of the Borna‚ÄìGro√übothen line, there were four mechanical signal boxess in the station. For the Borsdorf‚ÄìCoswig line, signal box 1 was located on the western end (towards Borsdorf) and signal box 3, which was also controlled the whole station, was located at the eastern end. Gro√übothen station now After the Second World War, Gro√übothen lost importance because of a break in the line to Wurzen and the dismantling of the Borna‚ÄìGro√übothen line. Signal box 2 was closed by 1980; the western end on the Mulde Valley Railway side received electrically-actuated, remotely-controlled points and colour light signals; these were connected to signal box 1. Shortly after 1990, the middle of the three railway platforms of the Mulden Valley Railway was closed. Traffic on the Colditz‚ÄìGro√übothen section of the Mulden Valley Railway was discontinued on 27 May 2000. In the rationalisation of the facilities, in preparation for the construction of the electronic interlocking system, the connections between the Mulde Valley Railway and the Borsdorf‚ÄìCoswig railway at the eastern end were omitted. Since 2010, an Alcatel electronic signal box has been put into operation; it is controlled from Geithain station. The central platform of the three platforms on the Borsdorf‚ÄìCoswig side was retained, but the points were locked, which made it no longer usable. Since 2014, there are again three platform faces on the Borsdorf‚ÄìCoswig line side of the station and one of the tracks leased to the DRE on the Mulde Valley Railway is accessible by train to and from Grimma ob station. Signal box 4 was not included in the electronic signalling and was retained. D√∂beln Hauptbahnhof () D√∂beln Hbf entrance building of 1868 The diesel-worked Borsdorf‚ÄìCoswig and the electrified Riesa‚ÄìChemnitz lines cross in D√∂beln Hauptbahnhof. It was opened on 2 June 1868. Sidings on the Coswig line north-east of the Hbf are electrified. The station building of 1868, unchanged to this day, is a heritage listed building. Between 1892 and 1926 the D√∂belner Stra√üenbahn, a horse tramway, ran for from the station to central D√∂beln. D√∂beln Zentrum () Entrance building of D√∂beln Zentrum station In 1868 the station was opened as D√∂beln halt (Haltepunkt) and renamed D√∂beln Ost (D√∂beln east) in 1905. In the meantime, the halt had been upgraded to a station with local goods facilities for the supply of the local industry. After the dismantling of the second track between D√∂beln and Mei√üen, only the northern platform was used; after the reconstruction of the station buildings in the middle of the 1970s, only the southern platform was used. In the 1990s, the station became a halt again (now meaning that is it has no sets of points). Since 21 August 2004, the station has been called D√∂beln Zentrum. The tracks originally ran at street level until 1904, when the line was tunnelled under Ro√üweiner Stra√üe and the tracks were lowered around six metres. Since the (now unused) station building remained at street level, the platform is only accessible by stairs from the Ro√üweiner Stra√üe bridge. The abandoned pedestrian bridge from the entrance building to the southern platform was removed as part of the rebuilding of the station superstructure in the 1970s. Ro√üwein () Ro√üwein station Ro√üwein station was opened on 25 October 1868 with the completion of the D√∂beln‚ÄìNossen section of the Borsdorf‚ÄìCoswig railway. Between 1872 and 1998, the Ro√üwein‚ÄìNiederwiesa railway ran via Hainichen and Frankenberg towards Niederwiesa. Nossen () Nossen station Nossen station was opened by the LDE on 25 October 1868 as part of the Borsdorf‚ÄìCoswig railway. With the construction of lines to Freiberg (1873) and Riesa (1877/1880) it became an important regional junction with a large railway operation, which existed until the 1990s. Since the discontinuation of regular rail passenger transport between D√∂beln and Mei√üen in December 2015, it has only been used for goods traffic. Mei√üen () Meissen station, opened in 1860, is located in the C√∂lln district. The entrance building, which was built in 1928, is a protected monument and is regarded as an important building of its time. After the end of long-distance traffic in the 1960s, the station now has only a regional significance.

The franchise subsequently expanded to other games, including Sunless Sea and its sequel Sunless Skies. The game has been running continuously since October 2009. In June 2018, the website received a major graphical update, with a page redesign as well as better scaling across devices and HTTPS integration.  Setting  Forty years ago London, First City of the British Empire, became the fifth city stolen into the Neath‚Äîa vast cavern beneath the earth. The city's streets twisted into a labyrinth centred on the Echo Bazaar, who serves as the centre of commerce and covets stories of love. While London retains a monarch, a parliament, and a mayor, the true power lies with the Masters of the Bazaar‚Äîcloaked inhuman beings who oversee domains of trade and enact mysterious agendas. Even physical laws lose their supremacy beyond the sunlight; clocks and maps can no longer be trusted, rats and cats wag tongues as well as tails, and death is often a temporary inconvenience. While the industry, poverty, and high-class society of Victorian London remain, its strict social mores have been disrupted by strange new factions roaming its streets. Hell maintains an embassy in the city and trades in souls, to the consternation of the church. Artists and academics explore new possibilities unimaginable before the fall. Urchins, criminals, and revolutionaries hide from constables in the rooftops while hidden conflicts unfold below in shadows and reflections. Across the vast ocean of the Unterzee lies the Khanate empire, the impenetrable Elder Continent, and the screaming island of Polythreme, which exports clay labour to London. Individuals mired in scandal are exiled to the Tomb Colonies, where the not-quite-dead live out their final days. Convicted criminals serve their sentence in New Newgate prison - constructed in a stalactite amongst the roof's false-stars. The temporarily deceased find themselves transported to a slow boat near the land of the dead. Those who succumb to nightmares and madness are welcomed to the Royal Bethlehem hotel or slip into a dream-realm, Parabola, which is closer to London than to surface locations and is sometimes visible through mirrors.  Gameplay  Players take the role of new arrivals to the underground down on their luck, and make their way to the cream of the crop of the city's various legal and illegal activities. Players are gentlebeings of leisure, plumbing the vices and secrets of Fallen London. They have no living expenses, and though players may choose a profession for a periodic income, they can publish a newspaper, serve out repeated prison sentences and feed deliverymen to a man-eating plant without harming their job security. Stats are used to track the player character's abilities and their position in the questlines; a character may accumulate hundreds. Four of these are the character's main attributes (Watchful, Shadowy, Dangerous, Persuasive) and constantly used for succeeding in actions, though failure may also increase the corresponding menace (Nightmares, Suspicion, Wounds, Scandal). If any menace rises too high, the character is removed to a side location (such as Disgraced exile in the Tomb-Colonies for Scandal) to work it off. The game can't be won, but can be lost. A questline to \\"Seek Mr. Eaten's Name\\", about destructive obsession, requires the player to damage their character in like manner repeatedly, until its completion leaves the character permanently unplayable. The game requires players to opt into this questline and warns them against playing it. Development Alexis Kennedy began solo development of Fallen London as an amateur project in June 2009, creating the setting, building the site and writing the initial content. He had originally intended the game to be an entirely text-based experience, but quickly realised that art would enhance the project, and recruited a friend, Paul Arendt. > \\"Paul came on board because I wanted to write and code but I can't draw,\\" > says Kennedy. The original plan was to pay Arendt outright for his > illustration work. \\"I said, 'I want to pay you as I want this to be a > professional thing.' He said, 'Cut me in for a percentage,' and I said, > 'Sure, that's great! I don't need to give you any money now! But you realise > we're probably not going to make any actual money out of it?'\\" He claps his > hands together. \\"We've been on salary for three years now, so... so that > worked out.\\" The site launched initially in October 2009 as an entirely free site, and introduced free-to-play elements in January 2010. Kennedy and Arendt recruited a number of other friends to write additional content, and over the years, the writing of Fallen London became a collective endeavour. Fallen London is built on Failbetter's StoryNexus engine. Kennedy has explained that creating StoryNexus was the original motivation behind the creation of Fallen London. The company's plan was to develop StoryNexus as an open platform, but later described StoryNexus as a \\"failure\\".  Release  Fallen London was released in 2009 as a browser game. An iOS and Android version was released in 2016, but was retired in 2018.  Reception  Fallen London has received positive reviews, with much praise going to its writing and worldbuilding. Dan Zuccarelli of Gamezebo, calling the game \\"one of the best browser games [they'd] ever played\\", pointed to the game's \\"compelling but not overwhelming\\" story as its main feature. Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Adam Smith wrote in favour of its writing style along with its \\"inventive setting\\", \\"dripping with lore\\". He noted how most of the discovery comes from the player working things out for themselves. Emily Short found it \\"almost entirely about setting\\". She gave credit to the quality of the game's prose and its \\"reasonably consistent\\" worldbuilding, though thought the game could be used for \\"something plottier\\". Short noted the \\"grinding\\" in the game, but found the daily time investment to play the game small enough to overlook its gameplay's \\"slightness\\". However, Short subsequently went on to become a writer for the game, and in late 2019 joined Failbetter as creative director. The game won The Escapist \\"Best Browser-Based Game\\" award for the year 2009.  Spin-off media  Sunless Sea and its sequel, Sunless Skies, are roguelike spin-offs of Fallen London. On 22 September 2018, Failbetter Games released Skyfarer RPG, a rules light, highly narrative indie pen-and-paper role-playing game to accompany Sunless Skies. Tales of Fallen London: The Silver Tree, a prequel to Fallen London, was released on 23 October 2012. The Silver Tree is also a browser-based choose- your-own-adventure game, but occurs roughly five hundred years before the time of Fallen London and focuses on the events surrounding the fall of the Fourth City, Karakorum, capital of the Mongol Empire. A tabletop game titled Knife & Candle (named for the competitive sport within the setting that combines elements of tag and a free-for-all murder spree) was in development, but John Harper stated that the game \\"didn't come together\\".

Following this assignment he became commander of the 436th Troop Carrier Group and remained as such throughout the remainder of World War II. This group pioneered in the early assault glider operations, participating in all major airborne assault operations in the European Theater. These included the Normandy invasion (D-Day), of southern France, the Nijmegen-Eindhoven, the Netherlands operation, resupply to the beleaguered 101st in Bastogne, and the crossing of the Rhine. Following V-E Day, Williams returned to the United States with the 436th Troop Carrier Group, where the unit was to be reequipped with C-46s for duty in the Pacific theater. However, the war ended while the changes were being made and the 436th Troop Carrier Group was inactivated. Williams was then assigned as commander of the 434th Troop Carrier Group, located at George Army Air Field, Lawrenceville, Illinois, and later Greenville Air Base, South Carolina.

Reichleitner rarely showed his face in the camp, and it has been claimed that he was a heavy drinker, but his reign of Sobib√≥r was even more strict than that of his predecessor. Moshe Bahir, a camp inmate, wrote: > Reichleitner, a man in his late forties, with an Austrian accent, was > dressed always with great elegance and wore gloves.

Sobibor revolt After Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler visited Sobib√≥r on 12 February 1943, he promoted Reichleitner to SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer (Captain). Reichleitner was on leave on the day of the successful Sobib√≥r revolt, 14 October 1943. With about 300 of the 600 prisoners having escaped, the remainder were shot dead per the direct orders of Himmler. Sobib√≥r was closed within a few days and the Nazis attempted to remove any traces of its existence. In autumn 1943, like so many of the perpetrators of Operation Reinhard, Reichleitner was then transferred to the Fiume area of Italy to kill Jews and quell the partisan resistance movement there. Reichleitner was killed by partisans on 3 January 1944 at Fiume, Italy.

After a year, still under a draft deferment, he left the city and drove west with a family fortune of $1,200. At a turn in the road he decided to go to Aspen. Career Soon after arriving in Aspen, he rented a trailer to live in. He bought some pans and groceries and started selling cr√™pes from the red Popcorn Wagon, which is still used for that purpose in Aspen today. This earned him enough money to buy the trailer. and, four months later, a ranch. This was the beginning of a career in real estate. With a partner, he bought land on the shores of Ruedi Reservoir outside nearby Basalt, recently created by damming the Fryingpan River, and subdivided it into Ruedi Shores. In 1971, he persuaded Robert Orville Anderson, then chairman of Atlantic Richfield, to lend him $170,000 ($ in contemporary dollars) to buy the aging Brand Building in downtown Aspen, across from Aspen City Hall. Built in 1891, near the end of the Colorado Silver Boom that had spurred the city's initial growth, it had been used as a gas station for much of the 20th century and was slated for demolition. After the purchase, Baldwin restored it. Also that year, Baldwin married Lee Webster. The following year, 1972, feeling local opposition to some of his other projects was too great to overcome, he and Webster moved to New York to pursue opportunities there. They maintained their properties and residence in Aspen, and continued to look after those investments. The couple divorced in 1977. In New York, he was primarily involved in developing Bridgemarket, a food store under the Manhattan approach to the Queensboro Bridge. The process took longer than Baldwin anticipated, and during it the plans were changed considerably from Baldwin's original vision. It finally opened in 1999, with other developers involved. His apartment in The Dakota became the subject of a lawsuit in 1992. Earlier that year, Michelle Pfeiffer had agreed to sublet it from him while she filmed The Age of Innocence. When her movers arrived the day before principal photography began, they were refused entrance, ostensibly because the service entrance was closed for the day. She later discovered, she claimed, that Baldwin had not had obtained the permission of the Dakota's co- op board before subletting the apartment, as he was required to, and that he was about to default on the mortgage. Baldwin tried to persuade her to move in again, but refused to return her money when she decided to abandon the sublet. She moved into a hotel instead for the duration of the film, and later won a default judgement against him. Back in Aspen in 1988, he bought the Brand's neighbor, the Collins Block, another historic building from the city's boom years. He used them to join with other developers to effect a transformation of Aspen's image. Where a funeral parlor and hardware store had once been, luxury boutiques like Louis Vuitton, Dior and Bulgari are now located. In the basement of the Collins he opened the Caribou Club, a members-only nightspot. The second floor of the Brand was given over to high-end hotel and apartment space. Similarly, he renovated the upper floor of the Collins into a penthouse for himself and his companion Richard Edwards that Architectural Digest featured in 1996. The emergence of the Caribou and the boutiques disturbed some Aspenites, who saw it as a challenge to the egalitarian mentality that had long predominated locally despite the area's many rich and famous residents. The buildings were referred to as \\"Glitter Gulch\\", a nickname later applied to Aspen itself . Baldwin saw it as inevitable and logical. \\"Aspen is for the most successful people in the world.\\" he said in a 2001 Vanity Fair article. \\"It so happens that they like to wear Gucci. Where's the problem?\\" George Hamilton, a friend, defended him as \\"what Aspen is all about ... He understands classic good taste and at the same time is irreverent about it.\\" He started more businesses, bringing the total he owned in Aspen to 12. One sold silver belt buckles he had designed himself. The other was an art gallery, a conscious attempt on his part to raise the cultural profile of his adopted hometown, already known in the classical music community for the annual Aspen Music Festival and School, to which he contributed money and sat on the board. Very quickly, the Baldwin Gallery, in the Brand's South Galena Street frontage, had the effect he had hoped, selling work by internationally prominent contemporary artists like Jennifer Bartlett and Ross Bleckner. Death In 2004 Baldwin became ill with kidney cancer. He and Edwards began spending more time in Manhattan. On January 23, 2005, he died at Memorial Sloan‚ÄìKettering Cancer Center.

It is told that it is named after fox because rapos means fox in Portuguese Algarve, Portugal. In 2013, the parish merged into the new parish Vila do Bispo e Raposeira. It has an area of 25.71 km¬≤ and 441 inhabitants (2001). It is one of the parishes covered by the Southwest Alentejo and Vicentine Coast Natural Park. Raposeira was one of the places where the 15th- century Portuguese prince Henry the Navigator set up residence during his lifetime. Henry was known to have attended mass at the isolated but spacious chapel dedicated to the cult of Our Lady of Guadalupe, believed to have been originally erected by the Templar knights in the latter part the 13th century, and one of the few Medieval structures in this region of the Algarve to have survived the 1755 earthquake intact. There are several groups of megalithic menhirs on the way to beach. It has been a very friendly place to stay for nomad groups, surfers and many had done retirement settlement here. People from Germany, England, Holland and more of Europe enjoy happy days here. The place is windy in summer because of the beach nearby. Wind blows mostly from two sides and it is really interesting because when the wind blows from Monchique a nearby area popular for medroneah (a very strong local alcoholic drink) it feels cold but on the other side is Morocco from where the very hot wind blows. There are not many choices to eat like in the centre of Raposeira but there are local Portuguese bars and small cafe restaurant. There is a pizza restaurant called Pizza Point which normally opens after 3:00 pm. The village is very calm with kind-hearted people. Bus transport is available from 6:00 in the morning to 8:00 in the evening sometimes differing on public holidays. But it is always better with your own means of transportation because if you want to travel to Sagres and Lagos from there you have to meet the bus timetable.

There are many aspects to work intensity including multitasking, time poverty, health implications, and policy considerations. Multitasking is the overlap of many activities, usually care and informal work, that negatively impacts the livelihood of people, especially women, in the developing world. Time Poverty is defined as the lack of time for leisure and rest activities after time spent working. High work intensity coupled with multitasking and time poverty has a negative correlation with health outcomes.Jackson, Cecile and Richard Palmer-Jones. \\"Work Intensity, Gender and Well-being.\\" United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) 96 (1998): 18 Work intensity is seldom considered when proposing new policy and legislation. As more women enter the workforce, work intensity and its implications are being brought to the forefront of policy, development, and empowerment debates. Multitasking Due to the nature of work intensity and multitasking, women tend to be more affected than men. Work intensity is amplified by multitasking as women put forth more effort per unit of time through the performance of two or more tasks simultaneously. Women assume productive, reproductive, and managing roles in their communities, thus the demand for their time is greater. Each role requires a different amount of intensity, and the magnitude of the amount of work that women in the developing world complete is often disregarded. Current time use data and research ignores the multiplicity of roles and duties performed by women in developing nations, thus, the extent in which women multitask is vastly underreported. This creates an unfair distribution of work between men and women as women chiefly deal with the functioning of the familial unit. While multitasking and its effects influence all socioeconomic classes, the lower, working classes tend to bear the burden of its distresses. Multitasking, more often than not, is used to mitigate the effects of low incomes. Families that cannot afford other means to take care of the daily ins and outs of running a household rely on women to complete everyday chores and care. In addition, families suffering from poverty are more likely to have both parents work, compounding the amount of labor done by women. However, the alternative to multitasking can leave women and their families in deeper poverty. Economists are beginning to take note of the importance of correctly quantifying multitasking by looking at the role of care and unpaid work. Care work, done predominantly by women, is a main component of multitasking. Care work includes, but is not limited to, caring for children, the elderly, partners, and oneself. Unpaid work, while it includes care work, also includes activities such as cooking, cleaning, and fetching water.Chen, Martha, Joann Vanek, Francie Lund, James Heintz with Renana Jhabvala, and Christine Bonner. 2005. ‚ÄúThe Totality of Women‚Äôs Work,‚Äù in Progress of the World‚Äôs Women, pp. 22‚Äì35. New York: United Nations Development Fund for Women There is an enormous overlap between childcare and multitasking, leading to a never ending workday for many women. If employed, she returns from her job and is again put to work cooking, cleaning, and caring for others in her household. Women complete over sixty percent of unpaid household work, which is almost never factored into any productive measure and overlooked. Time poverty Time poverty is defined as the lack of time for leisure and rest activities after time spent working. As women often serve productive, reproductive, and managing roles in their communities they are more likely to be time poor than men as their time is spread out over many activities. Especially in rural areas, women tend to work more hours than men although the time work gap varies by country. Additionally, there is a correlation between time and income poverty which further widens the time and income gap between men and women. It is the combination of informal domestic work on top of market labor that puts women at a disadvantage. Unfortunately, the alternative to being time poor is even deeper consumption poverty. This grim alternative leaves women with no other choice than to be incessantly working, often on several projects at once (internal link to multitasking). Time poverty and multitasking are extremely interconnected in that women are so time impoverished that they must do many tasks simultaneously. In household units, women are more likely to make sacrifices for the rest of the family. In sacrificing their time for more work, women are less healthy, poorly rested, and have diminished capabilities. The feminization of labor can be seen as partly responsible for the time impoverishment of women in developing countries. Joining the formal labor market means that women have more work to do in addition to the informal care work already done within the home. As women are often paid lower wages than men, the feminization of labor contributes to income inequality and thus general gender inequality. This leaves women with few options: find gainful employment and thus increase bargaining power while at the same time becoming more time poor, or slide further into consumption poverty. This lack of leisure time reduces the capabilities of women who are time poor. One of the ten essential human capabilities Martha Nussbaum lists in her 2004 article on women's capabilities is play, which is the capability to enjoy life and all that it has to offer. Women who are time poor are severely deficient in the play capability. As development policy slowly transitions from an income-based approach to one that is capability-based, the reduction of capabilities in time impoverished women becomes increasingly important. Health implications Because of the time and workload associated with work intensity, there is a negative correlation between work intensity and health.Jackson, Cecile and Richard Palmer-Jones. \\"Work Intensity, Gender and Well-being.\\" United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) 96 (1998): i-28 While these health patterns occur in the developing and developed worlds, they manifest differently. An increase in work hours and multitasking may lead to higher monetary income and completed household tasks (for example, meals are cooked, clothes are washed, children are cared for), however the way in which women workers spend their time can lead to a deterioration in health due to stress, chronic fatigue, and a lack of recreation and sleep. In addition, working long hours in agriculture and in factories can cause nutritional deficiencies and physical strain.Jackson, Cecile and Richard Palmer-Jones. \\"Work Intensity, Gender and Well-being.\\" United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) 96 (1998): ii Lower classes tend to bear the burden of the negative health implications associated with work intensity, and they are more likely to take undesirable jobs that cause said health problems. In addition, lower class women generally take on higher degrees of work intensity. The capabilities approach emphasizes nutrition and health as fundamental freedoms, as do many other developmental goals and approaches freedom. Health and bodily integrity are essential human capabilities vital to living a full life. A lack of health, especially unnecessarily, can be seen as an infringement on human rights. Work intensity coupled with rest has been proven beneficial in regards to health outcomes. Rest is a form of productive consumption. Productive consumption enables the satisfaction of current needs and simultaneously increases the productive potential of labor.Jackson, Cecile and Richard Palmer-Jones. \\"Work Intensity, Gender and Well-being.\\" United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) 96 (1998): iii Rest, improved nutrition, and education can help ease the problems associated with work intensity. Policy considerations Of the poverty eradication policies currently in place, very few of them incorporate work intensity into their reduction strategies and can often actually worsen conditions for citizens of developing countries. A common development strategy is to increase the size of a plot of land used for agriculture. While this increases a family's output, it also increases the amount of work women have to do. Another example would be moving a water source closer to a village. While women spend less time collecting water, their free time is rarely allocated to leisure and is instead allocated to more work that can often be more strenuous than the initial task of water collecting.Jackson, Cecile and Richard Palmer- Jones. \\"Work Intensity, Gender and Well-being.\\" United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) 96 (1998): 26 The two development projects listed above are common in developing countries, however neither takes time poverty nor multitasking into account. A potential solution to these two problems is to include improved nutritional programs when work intensity increases. This way, women aren't forced to choose between more work and more food as the nutrition program will be improved as work intensity increases. Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen lists adequate nutrition as an essential human freedom, and at the moment women are spending more time working that receiving sufficient nutrition and rest. Another potential policy solution is to include rest into the workday as a form of productive consumption. Many economists want to tangibly see the reallocation of work after a certain labor-saving technology has been incorporated. However, individuals need time to recover and thus rest is as important as physical work. A big issue facing policymakers is the inadequacy of the way gender equality and time use are currently measured. Two current methods to quantify gender equality are the Gender-related Development Index (GDI) and the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM). Although each index takes different factors into account, neither addresses time poverty or work intensity. Better economic measures to quantify care and informal work are necessary for more effective policy implementation.

The game has been ported to several platforms, including iOS and PlayStation Minis. The gameplay revolves around pressing the shift key to flip the room. The games have had critical success with Shift 2 having a score of 87/100 on Metacritic. Gameplay In Shift, the player is in a room that is half black, half white, one of which is solid. When the player presses the Shift, the room flips upside down, and the opposite color becomes solid. The player tries to get keys and get to doors while avoiding spikes and other objects. Shift makes a few references in some levels to the popular Valve game Portal, with the phrases 'the timer is a lie!' and 'Now you're thinking with shifting'. In Shift, Keys are used to move Doors around, which can either serve as platforms or obstacles. Starting in Shift 2, your character(s) would pause once they touched a key. In Shift:Freedom, Keys and Doors were color-coded. In Shift 2, Lightbulbs, Checkered Barriers, and Directional Arrows were added. Lightbulbs were used to remove Checkered Barriers that would serve as obstacles. Directional Arrows, when touched, would change the directional gravity of the level. This would result in some Exit Doors be positioned side-ways. The player character would need to be rotated in the same direction relative to the exit door in order to access it. In Shift 3, levels had both Entrance and Exit Doors, allowing the user to retrace their steps and access previous levels. In addition, some levels had multiple Doors, resulting in the user navigating a maze of levels. Some keys would serve to move Doors in other levels. In Shift 4, the Levels and Exit Doors would be numbered, making it easier to navigate. In Shift 4, the mechanic of multiple characters had been added, although the user could only control one character at a time. Buttons and Pressure Pads were added, which only worked if a character was holding them down. One character could move to a button/pressure pad to move a door(s), while another character could then get to the Exit Door. Only one character needed to reach the Exit Door in order to go to the next Level. In Shift : Freedom, boxes were added. Boxes were either black or white, and could be pushed or pulled by the player. The box would be a solid object if the same color as the player, or act as space if it was the opposite color. The box could also be affected by Directional Arrows, as well as certain markers that would cause the Box to Shift. History=Main series * Shift was released February 1, 2008.

Smith and starring Ronald Reagan. It is the second of four films in the U.S. Secret Service Agent Brass Bancroft series, having been preceded by Secret Service of the Air (1939) and followed by Smashing the Money Ring (1939) and Murder in the Air (1940). The series was part of a late 1930s effort by Warner Bros. to produce films depicting law enforcement in a positive light under pressure from Homer Stille Cummings (Franklin D. Roosevelt's Attorney General) and Will H. Hays (creator of the Motion Picture Production Code, the movie industry's censorship guidelines), due to the studio's part in producing early 1930s films glamorizing gangsters. The series also enabled Warner Bros. to create Reagan's screen persona, with Reagan even showing up to the set of Code of the Secret Service and asking director Noel M. Smith, \\"When do I fight and whom?\\" Plot United States Secret Service Lieutenant Brass Bancroft (Ronald Reagan) and his partner, Gabby Watters (Eddie Foy, Jr., producer Bryan Foy's brother), seek engraving plates stolen from the U.S. Treasury Department, and the investigation leads Bancroft and Watters to pursue a counterfeiting ring in Mexico. Along the way, Bancroft is falsely blamed for the death of a fellow Secret Service agent, escapes from jail, captures the leader of the counterfeiting ring, and wins the heart of his love interest, Elaine (Rosella Towne). Cast The cast included: * Ronald Reagan as Lieutenant Brass Bancroft * Rosella Towne as Elaine * Eddie Foy, Jr. as Gabby Watters * Moroni Olsen as Parker * Edgar Edwards as Ross * Jack Mower as Decker * John Gallaudet as Dan Crockett * Joseph King as Tom \\"Jim\\" Saxby * Steve Darrell as Butch, a henchman * Sol Gorss as Dutch, a henchman * George Regas as Mexican police officer Reception Reagan called Code of the Secret Service \\"the worst picture I ever made\\" and commented on it, \\"never has an egg of such dimensions been laid.\\" Producer Bryan Foy attempted to shelve the film. Warner Bros. refused to do so, but did agree to not release it in Los Angeles. Commenting on the film, a ticket taker at a movie theater in another city reportedly told Reagan, \\"You should be ashamed.\\" In a 1939 review, the Calgary Herald called the movie \\"quite far-fetched in places and not very interesting as a whole.\\" Ronald Reagan assassination attempt After seeing the movie repeatedly as a child, Jerry Parr was inspired to join the Secret Service. Parr would go on to save the life of the President of the United States in a 1981 assassination attempt. The President was Ronald Reagan, the star of Code of the Secret Service.

Flowering trees were special to van Gogh. They represented awakening and hope. He enjoyed them aesthetically and found joy in painting flowering trees. The works reflect the influence of Impressionism, Divisionism, and Japanese woodcuts. Almond Blossom was made to celebrate the birth of his nephew and namesake, son of his brother Theo and sister-in-law Jo. Southern France In 1888 van Gogh became inspired in southern France and began the most productive period of his painting career. In connection with his painting Farmhouse in Provence (1888), the National Gallery of Art notes that > \\"It was sun that van Gogh sought in Provence, a brilliance and light that > would wash out detail and simplify forms, reducing the world around him to > the sort of pattern he admired in Japanese woodblocks. Arles, he said, was > \\"the Japan of the South.\\" Here, he felt, the flattening effect of the sun > would strengthen the outlines of compositions and reduce nuances of color to > a few vivid contrasts. Pairs of complements‚Äîthe red and green of the plants, > the woven highlights of oranges and blue in the fence, even the pink clouds > that enliven the turquoise sky ‚Äî almost vibrate against each other.\\" When van Gogh arrived in Arles in March 1888 fruit trees in the orchards were about to bloom. The blossoms of the apricot, peach and plum trees motivated him, and within a month he had created fourteen paintings of blossoming fruit trees. Excited by the subject matter, van Gogh completed nearly one painting a day. Around April 21 he wrote to Theo, that he \\"will have to seek something new, now the orchards have almost finished blossoming.\\" Japonaiserie Flowering Plum Tree (after Hiroshige) by Vincent van Gogh, 1887 Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F371) Van Gogh's work reflected his interest in Japanese wood block prints. Hiroshige's Plum Park in Kameido demonstrates portrayal of beautiful subject matter with flat patterns of colors and no shadow. Van Gogh used the term Japonaiserie to express this influence; he collected hundreds of Japanese prints and likened the works of the great Japanese artists, like Hiroshige, to those of Rembrandt, Hals, and Vermeer. Hiroshige was one of the last great masters of the Japanese genre called ukiyo-e. Van Gogh integrated some of the technical aspects of ukiyo-e into his work as his two 1887 homages to Hiroshige demonstrates. The Japanese paintings represent Van Gogh's search for serenity, which he describes in a letter to his sister, \\"Having as much of this serenity as possible, even though one knows little ‚Äì nothing ‚Äì for certain, is perhaps a better remedy for all diseases than all the things that are sold at the chemist's shop.\\" The southern region and the flowering trees seem to awaken van Gogh from his doldrums into a state of clear direction, hyper-activity and good cheer. He wrote, \\"I am up to my ears in work for the trees are in blossom and I want to paint a Proven√ßal orchard of astonishing gaiety.\\" While in the past a very active period would have drained him, this time he was invigorated. Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass with a Book Vincent wrote to Theo, \\"Down here it is freezing hard and there is still snow in the countryside,\\" and he has \\"two small studies of an almond-tree branch already in flower in spite of it.\\" The two studies are Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass and Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass with a Book. Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass Although fruit trees were about to bloom when Vincent arrived in Arles, the town had just received a layer of snow, driving van Gogh inside for his first week in Arles where he worked on still life, such as a branch from an almond tree. To reflect the early signs of spring, he used delicate brushstrokes and pastel shades for Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass. In Art Inspiring Transmutations of Life, Bruce Ross evaluates the Impressionists' effect on van Gogh's work, > \\"Van Gogh's bright Sprig of Flowering Almond in a Glass embodies these > streams* while exploring Japanese aesthetic values. A broken-off sprig is > set in a simple glass. The sprig is highlighted by a red line along the > beige wall and lavish empty space. There is no formal decorative intent. Van > Gogh's name, also in bright red, hovers above a sprig in the upper left as > if a symbol of hope. Van Gogh has transformed the still life with the help > of these values. He has imbued a form predicated on death to one focused on > life and possibility. His use of bright color reflects this. There is an > individual, and hence essential, character to his subject, a sprig of almond > buds and opening blossoms. This still life resembles the Japanese art of > flower arrangement, ikebana, in its simplicity and evoked hopefulness as > well as in its formal use of empty space.\\" File:Van Gogh - Bl√ºhender Mandelbaumzweig in einem Glas.jpegBlossoming Almond Branch in a Glass 1888 Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam (F392) File:Vincent van Gogh - Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass with a Book.jpgBlossoming Almond Branch in a Glass with a Book 1888 Private Collection (F393) Almond Blossom Almond blossom, 1890 Van Gogh Museum, (F671) In mid-March 1888 van Gogh writes of the weather and that the almond trees are coming into full flower, \\"The weather here is changeable, often windy with turbulent skies, but the almond trees are beginning to flower everywhere.\\" Mancoff says of flowering trees and this work, > \\"In his flowering trees, Vincent attained a sense of spontaneity, freeing > himself from the strict self-analytical approach he took in Paris. In Almond > Tree in Blossom, Vincent used the light, broken strokes of impressionism and > the dabs of colour of divisionism for a sparkling surface effect. The > distinctive contours of the tree and its position in the foreground recall > the formal qualities of Japanese prints.\\" The rendering of Almond Blossom is positioned close and accessible to the viewer and the branches appear to reach out beyond the painting's frame. Theo wrote to his brother Vincent on January 31, 1890, to announce the birth of his son, Vincent Willem van Gogh. As a means of celebration, Vincent began work on a painting for Theo and his wife. He was very close to his brother and he sought to symbolize new life in the flowers of the almond tree for the birth of baby Vincent. Vincent wrote to his mother of the birth of Theo and Jo's baby, > \\"How glad I was when the news came... I should have greatly preferred him to > call the boy after Father, of whom I have been thinking so much these days, > instead of after me; but seeing it has now been done, I started right away > to make a picture for him, to hang in their bedroom, big branches of white > almond blossom against a blue sky.\\" The composition is unlike any other of van Gogh's paintings. The branches of the almond tree seem to float against the blue sky and fill the picture plane. The close-up of the branches brings to mind Delacroix's proposition that \\"even a part of a thing is kind of a complete entity in itself.\\" Dark lines outline the branches. This is a feature that Van Gogh had admired in Japanese floral studies that, for example, may depict a portion of a stalk of bamboo in an empty space. The bright color is reflective of the paintings made in Arles and the transformational work van Gogh had on the still life genre.

Plot The story revolves around a miserly couple Parandamaiah Urbagal (Bank Janardhan) and Subbalakshmi (Satyabhama), who want their son Santhosh Urbagal (Jaggesh) to marry a rich girl, for want of dowry. Santhosh, however, marries a girl from a poor financial background, antagonizing them. How son changes his parents outlook forms rest of the story. Parandamaiah owns a general store, 'Oorubaglu General Stores'. Santhosh likes to keep the shop as he loves Sangeetha, the daughter of Shankar Shastry, a musician, whose house is opposite the shop. Santhosh spends his time sightseeing (the subject is mostly Sangeetha) and he is hostile towards customers when he is sightseeing (he calls it 'Dove Hodiyodu', one of his popular dialogues). His friends - 'Chitke' Seena, Raja, 'Razor' Manja, Nanja and 'nanjappan maga' Gunjappa. They help Santhosh to gain Sangeetha's affection. However, Parandamaiah and Satyabhama decide to marry Santhosh to his uncle's daughter Sundari for dowry. However, Santhosh disagrees to marry any girl for dowry as he wants his wife to be the love of his life. Santhosh succeeds in marrying Sangeetha by hoodwinking his parents. Later, with the help of his friends, he starts to enjoy his married life. But, Parandamaiah and Satyabhama decide to cheat Santhosh and create a feud between Santhosh and Sangeetha. They make Sangeetha assume that Santhosh is having a sexual relationship with Sundari. Meanwhile, they make Santhosh assume Sangeetha is having an extramarital affair. Santhosh investigates this and he assumes that Sangeetha is having an affair (the assumed boyfriend was paid by Parandamaiah). Due to this, Sangeetha goes back to her maternal home. Soon Santhosh finds out about this, and, with the help of his friends, makes his parents realize that good values are more important than money. Later, after he makes his parents realise their mistake, his uncle finds that Sundari is pregnant. He allegedly accuses Santhosh of impregnating Sundari. However, this is not the case as he had told his friends to loaf and flirt with Sundari to enlighten his parents. Later, Santhosh arranges for the marriage of Sundari. In the climax, Santhosh finds that Gunjappa had impregnated Sundari and he is forced to marry Sundari. Thus the movie ends on a happy note.

This \\"inventive and not at all flippant little festival\\" offered performances mounted on a shoestring budget, which were held in a hall at Ledlanet, then the home of the publisher John Calder.Ledlanet, a baronial country mansion, was situated near Milnathort. History Ledlanet Nights, described at some length in Calder‚Äôs autobiography, Pursuit, developed as a general festival from modest beginnings. Many art forms were offered, among which were opera, theatre, recitals and orchestral concerts. An early, if unexpected addition, were folk evenings. As well as art exhibitions, the mix included one- or two-person shows of different types ranging from those of Geraint Evans to Ian Wallace or Donald Swann. Initially these were mostly produced especially for Ledlanet, but as the seasons grew in ambition, later shows were often 'bought in' from a tour. In the immediate post-war period, professional opera could be found in Scotland mainly through the offerings of touring companies. Arts activity in country houses was not unknown but festivals generally were nowhere near as widespread as they have since become. In 1963 when opera was found in Scotland largely at the Edinburgh International Festival, and when Scottish Opera had only just been founded, any additional opera on a small scale was welcomed. Handel works, then much less well known, featured prominently at Ledlanet with productions including Agrippina and Alcina. Jill Gomez and Josephine Barstow were among several singers appearing who made an impression there at a relatively early stage in their careers, in Il Re Pastore and Una cosa rara, respectively. Ledlanet Nights remained small scale; even at its peak in 1973 there were seats for only 155 people. Performers and audience members alike remember well the intimate atmosphere. With little support from public coffers, the Festival was heavily dependent on fundraising by regular patrons and supporters. By 1973 this was no longer sustainable. Calder attributes the sudden end of Ledlanet Nights to the financial consequences of his divorce from his second wife.

The newspaper was of the opinion Ida Lupino and James Blakeley were moderately good in their roles, but any merited praise for acting was to the credit of Lynne Overman, Jessie Ralph, and to the actor in the lesser role of the Chez Simone manager. Reviewer Graham Greene praised Milestone's emulation of Ernst Lubitsch in his ability to create a film that was a \\"silly, charming tale\\", and make something \\"light, enchanting, and genuinely fantastic\\" out of a nonsense plot device.

Novel is about Milutin, Serbian peasant and former soldier who tells his story from jail after World War II. He talks to imaginary listener about tragic fate of Serbian people, his family and Serbia. Published in 1985. Content Milutin Ostojiƒá, a Serbian peasant and a martyr from some ≈†umadija village was a real person. The book shows a true face of village and peasant, it discovers a source of true moral sensitivity in a peasant and martyr (Milutin), his sense for justice, his spirit which follows an original approach to life. Milutin's spirit shows that a life that follows strong sense of human dignity is not an invention of moralists. Milutin is a ≈†umadijan farmer, a World War I Thesalloniki Front infantry soldier. His father was killed in Serbo-Bulgarian War, his two brothers died in the Balkan Wars. As a war hero he returns home in order to experience maltreatment of him by the tax men of the state he defended and participated in her creation. In the war and after it, he learned what a human not obeying to the law and the customs could and dare to do. Fighting for his country and her freedom in his youth, Milutin was not able to predict what he might expect in his old age. His son, at a teenager age, was recruited and sent on Srem Front in 1944. Milutin protested by offering himself as a replacement for his son. Asked why young men, still children, inexperienced in the war fights, should be sent in war. The consolation he offered to himself (It's not just about his son, there are many other sons recruited and sent into the war, too) was ridiculed by his wife Zivana, \\"Is it easier to bear a misfortune if the misfortune is far greater?\\". The news about their only son's death, Milutina and Zivana met petrified. Old warrior Milutin, after the World War II, was arrested innocent in the time of the \\"grain redemption\\", thrown into a jail to be maltreated by a gang of criminals and nobodies there. Perception of the book by historians Historian J. Dragoviƒá-Soso wrote Milutin's common sense and his naivete provide the vehicle through which the main events of the first half of the 20eth century are apprehended, and his commentary on the creation of the common Yugoslav state, the corruption and disunity of that state, the resurgence of war in 1941 and the immorality of the new communist authorities, illuminates the absurdity of the struggle and sacrifices of the Serbian people. Milutin noticed that the Slav brothers did not rise up, they did not experience the same as us, they lived and cooperated with Serbian enemies, and look upon their 'liberators' Serbs with a haughty disdain.Saviours of the Nation: Serbia's Intellectual Opposition and the Revival of Nationalism by Jasna Dragoviƒá-Soso McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, 2002 page 93 While Dragoviƒá-Soso is willing to represent the Serbs' doubts in their unity with Slav brothers and the meaning of that brotherhood, the price they paid and they are paying for that unity and brotherhood without her opinion about the same, the others are willing to interpret the Serbs existential questions little more than a pretext on which to string a litany of complaints and questions, most of which have to do with Serbia's alleged tendencies to sacrifice its own interest for the sake of othersConfronting the Yugoslav Controversies: A Scholars' Initiative by Charles Ingrao, Thomas A.

Originally from Llanfihangel Glyn Myfyr, Jones had moved to London as a young man and had earned his fortune as a furrier.Davies 2008, p. 429. Other notable early members included Iolo Morganwg (Edward Williams), William Owen Pughe, Jac Glan-y-gors (John Jones), Si√¥n Ceiriog (John Edwards), Edward Jones (\\"Bardd y Brenin\\"), and Twm o'r Nant (Thomas Edwards). Although the society's name (meaning \\"Gwynedd scholars\\") suggests a particular link with the region of Gwynedd, its affiliations were from the start with the whole of North Wales, and later with all parts of Wales.Leathart 1831, pp. 11‚Äì12.Davies 2008, p. 346. It seems likely that the society was formed in part in reaction to the perceived social and intellectual elitism of the existing London Welsh societies, notably the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion (although there was in practice considerable overlap between the membership and the officials of the various societies). The emphasis in the early years was on sociability, music (including harp-playing and penillion-singing), and pleasure.Jones 2001, p. 75. The society's principal meeting-place was the Bull's Head Tavern in Walbrook, and one member, David Samwell, wrote: > In Walbrook stands a famous Inn Near ancient Watling Street Well stored with > brandy, beer and gin, Where Cambrians nightly meet.Quoted in Jenkins and > Ramage 1951, p. 115. Under rules adopted in 1777, every member had to be Welsh-speaking, and had to avow a fondness for singing, or at least for hearing poetry sung to the harp.Jenkins and Ramage 1951, p. 112. However, the society rapidly adopted a more broadly cultural, and specifically a literary, role. When the Cymmrodorion Society was dissolved in 1787, its Presidential Chair was passed to the Gwyneddigion Society.Jenkins and Ramage 1951, p. 119. One member described the Bull's Head between 1790 and 1815 as the \\"centre of Welsh literary life\\" (\\"canolfan bywyd llenyddol ein gwlad\\").Jones 2001, p. 76. The society promoted annual eisteddfodau in Wales, the precursors of the National Eisteddfod (the first being held at Bala in 1789); but these experienced difficulties, and the experiment was abandoned after 1793.Jenkins and Ramage 1951, pp. 123‚Äì7. It had its own library, and maintained contact with scholars across Wales, such as William Jones, to aid them in their knowledge gathering. It also offered an annual prize for literature, in the form of a silver medal. Most significantly, the society (with the financial backing of Owen Jones) published important Welsh literary texts, including Barddoniaeth Dafydd ab Gwilym (1789) and The Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales (1801‚Äì07). A noteworthy event in the society's early history was its funding in the 1790s of John Evans' exploration of North America in search of the legendary \\"Welsh Indians\\", the supposed descendants of Madog ab Owain Gwynedd. From the beginning of the 19th century the society began a slow decline, and by the mid-1830s it had been effectively subsumed into the Cymreigyddion Society (founded in 1795). It was formally dissolved in 1843.Jenkins and Ramage 1951, pp. 127‚Äì8. Revival A new Gwyneddigion Society was formed in London in 1978, but it is not known to have survived.

History The tower was built in the early 13th century. It protected the Gotthard road (Gotthardstrasse) and housed an Imperial customs post. In the 14th century, the right to collect Imperial customs was owned by the Lords of Attinghausen. The first known owner of the tower was Baron Johann von Attinghausen. After Baron Johann von Attinghausen's death around 1360, ownership passed to the Haslital Knight of Rudenz (by virtue of marriage). The tower thus came to be known as the Castle of Rudenz. The Knights of Rudenz were in the service of the Freiherr of Brienz- Ringgenberg and owned castles in Meiringen and Giswil before inheriting the tower at Fl√ºelen. The inheritance was disputed and Johann von Rudenz finally took possession of the castle in the 1370s. As part of receiving the inheritance on 19 June 1365 he granted half the collected tolls to the Canton of Uri. He ruled there for only a few years and died, the last of his line, before 1383. After the death of Johann von Rudenz, the castle passed through a number of owners. In the first half of the 17th century it was owned by Landammann Johann Heinrich von Brunnen. In 1727 it was acquired by Johann Joachim Epp. Then, in 1815 the Zgaggen family purchased it for 1,900 gulden. They repaired the old tower and returned it to a livable condition. They filled in the old dry moat and planted extensive gardens around the castle. However, over the following centuries, they had to sell off parts of the land and the gardens were replaced with streets and buildings as Fl√ºelen grew. The castle was later sold to the municipality of Fl√ºelen. In 2005 the municipality opened a public park on the castle grounds and opened the great hall for events. Castle site The tower is located near the center of Fl√ºelen. The tower has a rectangular floor plan. The walls are unevenly thick, the eastern wall is while the other three are . The tower was surrounded by curtain walls with defensive towers at the corners. However, the towers and much of the walls have been demolished. Today the tower is only partially surrounded by a low wall. By the 17th century, the tower was topped with the current four gabled roof topped with a pointed spire. The wrap around balcony and new windows were added in the 18th century. In the 19th century the pointed spire was replaced with the current onion dome spire. In 1931 the tower was repaired and restored, bringing the original stone to light. The castle contains eleven rooms, a great hall, a large kitchen and cellars.

The cemetery contains approximately 36,000 burials, nearly all of them African Americans. The cemetery was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 20, 1996. History The District of Columbia was established in 1791, and for the first 160 years of its existence nearly all cemeteries in the city were segregated by race. Many cemeteries refused to bury African Americans, while others separated whites from \\"colored people\\" (African Americans, Native Americans, and Asians). By the 1880s, most of the city's African American population lived in the eastern part of the Federal City and Washington County and east of the Anacostia River. Just two cemeteries met the needs of the city's black populace: Graceland Cemetery (what is now Hechninger Mall at the corner of Maryland Avenue NE and Bladensburg Road NE) and Payne's Cemetery (now the site of Fletcher-Johnson Elementary School and the Fletcher-Johnson Recreation Center). Woodlawn Cemetery was founded because of a crisis among the black burying grounds. Graceland Cemetery, founded in 1871 on the edge of the Federal City, was rapidly engulfed by residential development. By the early 1890s, the decomposition of bodies in the partially filled cemetery was polluting the nearby water supply and creating a health hazard. The Commissioners of the District of Columbia (the city's government) pressed for the closure of Graceland to accommodate the need for housing. With Graceland on the verge of closing, a number of white citizens decided that a new burial ground, much farther from any development, was needed. Woodlawn's incorporators consisted of five white men: Jesse E. Ergood, president; Charles C. Van Horn, secretary-treasurer; and directors Seymour W. Tullock, William Tindall, and Odell S. Smith. They formed the Woodlawn Cemetery Association, and were incorporated on January 8, 1895. A plot of land adjacent to Payne's Cemetery was purchased, a portion of which was the site of the American Civil War's Fort Chaplin. Burial plots were quickly laid out, and Woodlawn Cemetery opened on May 13, 1895. Between May 14, 1895, and October 7, 1898, nearly 6,000 sets of remains were transferred from Graceland Cemetery to several mass graves at Woodlawn Cemetery. Over the years, the closure of smaller churchyard cemeteries in the Federal City as well as some large burying grounds resulted in more mass graves. The last major transfer occurred from 1939 to 1940, when 139 full and partial sets of remains were relocated to Woodlawn. In all a dozen mass graves eventually came to exist at Woodlawn Cemetery. Closure, reopening, and current status Woodlawn Cemetery remained the preeminent cemetery for the city's African Americans into the 1950s. Nonetheless, records at the site were badly kept, and bodies were often buried in the incorrect plots. Woodlawn was an integrated cemetery, in that it accepted burials of both whites and blacks. Internally, however, it was segregated, with Caucasians being buried in a whites-only section. As the cemetery filled and space for burial became available in desegregated cemeteries, income from the sale of burial plots dropped significantly. White burials at Woodlawn, once a significant source of income, plummeted after 1912. Lacking a perpetual care trust, the cemetery fell into disrepair. The last burial was made there about 1969, with the total number of dead at the cemetery about 36,000. The Woodlawn Cemetery Association passed into the control of local resident Louis H. Bell and his son Richard Bell in 1961. They planned to restore the cemetery by advertising its historic nature and importance to the African American community, and generate income for the restoration. But they discovered that empty sections of the cemetery contained burials. Lacking the funds to fully explore the cemetery and determine which spaces remained free, the Bells abandoned their restoration efforts and the cemetery fell further into disrepair. In 1967, angry lotholders and their heirs decided to seize control of Woodlawn Cemetery. The group was led by lotholder Willard Wimp; his son-in- law, attorney Emanuel Lipscomb; lotholder Bruce O. Hawkins; and attorney Harry B. Thornton. They incorporated the Woodlawn Cemetery Perpetual Care Association (WCPCA), and sued the Bells. After a five-year legal battle, during which the cemetery association was declared bankrupt and the cemetery ruled to be abandoned, Louis Bell agreed to turn Woodlawn over to the WCPCA in 1972. With little funds and relying primarily on volunteer help, the WCPCA worked for two decades to restore Woodlawn Cemetery. Reclamation went slowly. When the Washington Metro began laying the route for the Blue Line in the early 1970s, the WCPCA offered to sell the western half of the cemetery to Metro to accommodate the Benning Road station. But Metro declined the offer. Woodlawn reopened for burials in 1975, but by 1987 the cemetery was still decrepit. The WCPCA only raised enough money to pay for a twice-a-year grass and weed cutting. In 1981, the association approved a plan to improve Woodlawn by having more than of fill dirt delivered to the cemetery. The goal was to use the earth to fill sunken graves and make it easier to maintain the grounds. Lacking funds for labor and equipment, however, a backhoe was used to move the fill dirt. This left a number of headstones buried under as much as of earth, and many others were damaged. The WCPCA acknowledged the situation was unfortunate, but made no plans to uncover the now-buried headstones. Financial problems at Woodlawn continued into the late 1980s. The Washington Post declared the cemetery so choked with weeds in 1987 that it was impassable. The WCPCA established a five-year fundraising plan in 1987 to put the cemetery on a more even financial footing. Some financial assistance came in the form of a small annual grant from National Harmony Memorial Park, a predominantly African American cemetery in Landover, Maryland. The cemetery received a major boost when Congress appropriated $300,000 in 2000 to help the WCPCA clean up the burying ground. The grant allowed the WCPCA to lease (for $30,000) a ground penetrating radar (GPR) system. Tyrone F. General, president of the WCPCA, was trained for two years in the operation of the GPR system. Beginning in 2009, the WCPCA began scanning the entire cemetery to accurately determine the location of graves‚Äîa process that was estimated to take three years. According to the Internal Revenue Service, the WCPCA's 501(c)(3) charitable status was revoked on May 15, 2013 and reinstated the same day. In April 2016, a crew of 180 plus volunteers, organized by the U.S.Coast Guard Liaison to Washington D.C, dedicated hours to clearing brush and other debris as part of an effort to restore historically important veteran's cemeteries in the region. In popular culture Woodlawn, a play about the cemetery, was produced by the Young Playwrights' Theater in 2011. Notable interments Woodlawn Cemetery in 2010. There are many nationally and locally prominent African Americans buried at Woodlawn Cemetery. Among these are eight people for whom local public schools are named. Richard H. Cain, a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from South Carolina's at-large congressional seat in 1873 was initially buried at Graceland Cemetery in 1887. He may have been moved to Woodlawn Cemetery in 1895, but if so then his grave is unmarked. John Willis Menard of Louisiana, the first African American ever elected to Congress, was also buried at Graceland and later moved to Woodlawn. His grave, however, is marked. Other notable burials include: * Amanda Bowen, founder of the Teachers' Benefit and Annuity Association * Blanche K.

Original Concept and Design When Imagineers were working on the creation of the European Disney resort, they had to envision a Main Street that would cope with the changing climate of the region of Paris. Although a huge Victorian-style glass roof covering the street could be built as in Tokyo Disneyland's World Bazaar, the decision was made to build two covered walkways parallel to Main Street instead. In the very early days of Disneyland in Anaheim, Walt Disney had imagined two streets adjacent to Main Street, respectively named Liberty Street (themed to American values and history) and Edison Square (themed to this inventor's achievements). Although they were never made reality, these ideas became inspiration for both arcades in Paris. As such, Imagineers came up with Liberty Arcade, themed to the lasting friendship between France and the United States and embodied by Lady Liberty, and Discovery Arcade, themed to inventions of the 19th century. Discovery Arcade The arcade is a long walkway, from Town Square to Edison Avenue, which also gets behind Main Street shops and restaurants. It features many showcase windows, each one displaying models and sketches from the U.S. Patent Office. These models were originally made in the 19th century. The arcade also presents a series of posters representing American cities of the late 20th century, as they were envisioned a century ago.

These were usually commissioned for sentimental reasons and were often worn as bracelets, brooches, pendants or rings with richly decorated frames, serving the same emotional need as lockets hiding portraits or locks of hair. This fad started in the late 1700s and miniaturists such as Richard Cosway and George Engleheart were responsible for some of the first pieces.Sentimental Jewelry History Maria Fitzherbert, (1756‚Äì1837), circa 1788. Eye miniatures are believed to have originated when the Prince of Wales (later George IV) felt the need to send the widow Maria Fitzherbert a token of his love. This gesture and the romance that went with it was frowned upon by the court, so a miniaturist was employed to paint only the eye and thereby preserve anonymity and decorum. The couple went through a form of marriage on 15 December 1785, though all present knew the marriage was invalid by the Royal Marriages Act, since George III had not approved. Reportedly Maria‚Äôs eye miniature was worn by George IV, hidden under his lapel. This is regarded as the event which led to lovers' eyes becoming fashionable,Art of Mourning appearing between 1790 and the 1820s in the courts and affluent families of England, Russia, France and more rarely, America. These portraits could also be found on various other trinkets, framed by precious stones on the lids of toothpick containers, snuffboxes and other small vessels. They would sometimes contain locks of hair gifted by the sitter to further accentuate the sentimentality of the piece. The hair could either be incorporated into the portrait itself or encased behind glass or crystal on the piece of jewellery. The high prices fetched by these items has generated a thriving market in imitations.Antiques Roadshow A note in Lady Eleanor Butler's diary recorded the arrival of a young man who had made the Grand Tour, and had brought \\"an Eye, done in Paris and set in a ring ‚Äì a true French idea.\\"Candice Hern ‚Äì Romance novelist NotesReferences * *Grootenboer, H.

It was made up of members of the Australian Labor Party in the Australian Parliament from 1941 to 1945. Background John Curtin was first elected leader of the Australian Labor Party and became leader of the opposition in 1935. Defence issues were becoming increasingly dominant in public affairs with the rise of Fascism in Europe and militant Japan in Asia. Curtin led Labor to the 1937 election against Joseph Lyons' United Australia Party which resulted in a comfortable victory to the UAP. Lyons died in office in April 1939 and the UAP selected Robert Menzies to succeed him as Prime Minister.http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/lyons/after- office.aspx On 3 September 1939, Prime Minister Menzies announced Australia's declaration of war on Nazi Germany. Australia had entered World War II, following the Nazi invasion of Poland. The Labor Party declined to enter a war cabinet led by Menzies, though Curtin offered co-operation ‚Äì though not to the extent of supporting conscription for overseas service. The Labor Party experienced a split along pro and anti Communist lines over policy towards the Soviet Union for its co-operation with Nazi Germany in the invasion of Poland and Labor narrowly lost the September 1940 Election. The Menzies Government relied upon the support of two Independents, Alex Wilson and Arthur Coles to continue in office. Curtin took a seat on the newly created Advisory War Council in October 1940 and agreed to a plan by Menzies to travel to Washington and London. In January 1941, Menzies flew to Britain to discuss the weakness of Singapore's defences and sit with Winston Churchill's British War Cabinet. In Menzies's absence, Curtin co-operated with Deputy Prime Minister Arthur Fadden in preparing Australia for the expected Pacific War. Returning to Australia, with the threat of Japan imminent and with the Australian army suffering badly in the Greek and Crete campaigns, Menzies re-approached the Labor Party to form a War Cabinet. Menzies had planned a further trip to Britain to influence the conduct of the Allied campaign. Unable to secure Curtin's support, and with an unworkable parliamentary majority, Menzies resigned as Prime Minister. The UAP-Coalition held office for another month with Arthur Fadden of the Country Party as its leader, before the independents switched allegiance and John Curtin was sworn in as Prime Minister on 7 October 1941.http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/fadden/in- office.aspx Eight weeks later, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. In Office John Curtin (8 January 1885 ‚Äì 5 July 1945) served as the 14th Prime Minister of Australia.http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A130616b.htm?hilite=john%3Bcurtin Labor under Curtin formed a minority government in 1941 after independents crossed the floor, bringing down the Coalition minority United Australia Party-Country Party Coalition government which resulted from the 1940 election. Curtin went on to lead federal Labor to its greatest win with two- thirds of seats in the lower house and over 58 percent of the two-party preferred vote at the 1943 election. Labor won 49 seats to 12 United Australia Party, 7 Country Party, 3 Country National Party (Queensland), 1 Queensland Country Party, 1 Liberal Country Party (Victoria) and 1 Independent in the Australian House of Representatives. The Labor Party also won all 19 of the seats contested for the Australian Senate.http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/curtin/elections.aspx Curtin led Australia when the Australian mainland came under direct military threat during the Japanese advance in World War II. He is widely regarded as one of the country's greatest Prime Ministers. General Douglas MacArthur said that Curtin was \\"one of the greatest of the wartime statesmen\\".General Douglas MacArthur, Reminiscences, Heinemann, London, 1967. Page 258. With most of Australia's best forces committed to fight against Hitler in the Middle East, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, the US naval base in Hawaii, on 8 December 1941 (eastern Australia time). The British battleship and battlecruiser sent to defend Singapore were sunk soon afterwards. Australia was ill-prepared for an attack, lacking armaments, modern fighter aircraft, heavy bombers, and aircraft carriers. While demanding reinforcements from Churchill, on 27 December 1941 Curtin published an historic announcement: > PoWs of the Japanese at Tarsau, in Thailand in 1943. The Fall of Singapore > followed soon after Curtin became Prime Minister of Australia. British > Malaya quickly collapsed, shocking the Australian nation.

She is a writer, artist and politician based in Stockholm, Sweden. However, the first female pilots in Iran were flying in the 1940s.  Aviation  She was born in Tehran on 1946. In 1974 while married and with five children, Akram Monfared Arya began taking lessons in gliders at the Royal Aviation Club in Doshan-Tapeh. Located next to the Air Force Base, Doshan- Tapeh was filled with students who were interested in learning to fly. After receiving her glider license, she went to the Ghaleh-Morghi School of Flight in October of the same year in order to take lessons in single and twin-engine aircraft. She started her training with the Cessna 172 and after only 14 hours of flight she successfully completed her first solo flight. Her next phases of training consisted of night and long distance flights to a number of cities such as Tabriz, Kermanshah, Ahwaz, Isfahan and Rasht. In her four years of flying, she flew 150 hours with an instructor and 50 hours solo in both day and night time. In addition to following the practical phase of training, she attended ground school where she took subjects like aerodynamics, engines, precision instruments, meteorology, navigation, and English. Upon obtaining her license, she received two job offers: one as a flight-instructor at the Royal Aviation Club, and the other as a co-pilot for twin-engine planes with the Air-Asseman Airline. However, she was unable to pursue a career or further her training in this field due to the revolution in Iran. Later on in 1989 and while living in Sweden, she took flying lessons along with theory lessons at Bromma Flight-School, (Bromma Flygskola), in Stockholm and received her Swedish pilots license.

He began very early to work with new technologies to create unique abstract and graphic forms, employing a series of chance techniques at the limits of technology, which he transforms into video films, graphics, installations and sculptures. Pajic follows progress in the sciences and adopts the latest concepts and technology in a quest for new forms, new materials and new artistic possibilities.  Biography  Born August 16, 1943 in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Slobodan Pajic arrived in Paris in 1966 to study art history at the Sorbonne, but was soon prompted to reorient himself to his own painting. He lives and works in Paris and has become a French citizen. At the beginning of the 1970s, his abstract, geometrical art brought him success, but his passion for new media, as ‚Äúnew supports‚Äù for creation, soon won out. One of his early solo shows was the organization of space with laser light (Square root in a square) at the American Center in Paris in 1972. As soon as 1/2 inch video equipment was available, Pajic began to work on a series of short videos unlike anything done before: Exploiting the incapacity of the video scanning pattern to register isolated instants in their entirety, Pajic introduced abrupt changes by breaking reflective surfaces before the camera. (Dany Bloch) The new Centre Georges Pompidou, in Paris lent their post- production facilities for a compilation of these short films, Untitled 76: Destruction of Sound and Image, and provided some of the first showings. The enthusiastic reaction of the art world prompted the Mus√©e national d‚ÄôArt moderne to commission Pajic to produce the first artist‚Äôs video in their new, two-inch video studios. (Moisdon) Untitled 77 : Passage From Closed To Open Space, an abstract film in saturated color, continues to occupy a unique position in the history of video art. In 1980, after a stay in New York, and a year of travel throughout Europe, Pajic settled into a new studio in Paris and began a series of installation pieces employing video screens and projections. An Image Reflector installation consists of a mirrored video screen on the wall, before which is placed a video monitor with an abstract, repetitive film, accompanied by an electronic signal. As the spectator approaches the screen to see the film, his or her own reflection becomes part of the experience. (Nieto & Wilson-Pajic) The Image Captors installations are typically composed of a large video screen on a wall, before which is placed a projector on a Plexiglas pedestal. The screen has been prepared with materials that capture the projection and restitute it in the dark. The image fades slowly, in the same way as an impression in short-term memory, and is replaced by another. (Nieto & Wilson-Pajic) In 1996, the French National Museum of Modern Art commissioned an installation from the Image Captors series. The result, a large multi-screen installation M√©moires was presented in the anniversary exhibition Made In France. To the sound of a rocket-launcher called Stalin‚Äôs Organ, images of war on 16 mm film decomposed motion and imprinted a prepared video screen, then abruptly disappeared, leaving the after-image to slowly fade in silence. On the other side of the room, 4 projections of fixed images of combats and refugees appeared in violent bursts and disappeared into darkness. (Fran√ßoise Parfait) The piece is an altogether moving indictment of war and aggression. In the early 80s Pajic began a series of pictorial works exploiting the inability of laser light to pass through certain distortions of materials, by which he produced abstract, chance patterns and transformed them into arresting pictorial works (Graphismes). A series of installations followed, in which laser beams confront transparent and reflective forms to create abstract figures in space. (Official site) At the beginning of the 90s, he constructed a high-frequency device and started work on a series of Electrophotograms. Based on the Tesla effect, the images are composed of minute points of light emanating from the material itself. The use of computer technology restores to the image all its brilliance and complexity. (Official site) Since then, Pajic has continued to develop a body of work composed of installations, videos, films, graphic and photographic images. He has participated in numerous personal and collective exhibitions: Maastricht Museum, Ev√©nement 03.23,03 in Montr√©al, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne in Paris, Biennale de S√£o Paulo, Video 79 in Rome, Biennale de Paris, Serpentine Gallery in London, Vor- Film Video in Munich.

Part of a network of such features, the Tyne Stop Line formed what would have been the principal defensive front for North East England against any attack coming from the north. In the event of invasion, the intention was that the advancing German forces would have been held up at the Coquet Stop Line 30 miles to the north in Northumberland, enabling the British GHQ field army to take up positions on the Tyne. In the event of the Tyne line being overwhelmed, defending forces were to withdraw to the Derwent Stop Line, 10 miles or so to the south. Tyne Stop Line defensive plan As soon as an invasion was confirmed, members of the 280th Field Company, Royal Engineers (based in Yorkshire), would rapidly advance north via Durham, Leadgate, Ebchester and Hexham and blow up more than 100 road, rail and foot bridges on the Tyne from the Rede Valley to Scotswood. The holes for the charges were already drilled (and the traces of many can still be seen to this day). Road approaches were to be mined and blocked by craters. The major bridges at Newcastle were to be mined but not blown up until the last minute; this was to enable any withdrawal of British forces southwards. One exception was the Swing Bridge, which was to be disabled. Militarily Tyneside itself would be divided into eighteen districts, each with its own detailed plan of action. Beaufront Castle, between Hexham and Corbridge, was designated as the regional HQ. Industrialists met with the Regional Commissioner and the Military to arrange a scorched earth plan for Tyneside's major industries. Each was given a code word and, on receipt of their particular word, all machinery in their premises would be disabled by removing essential parts. Other signals, such as the ringing of church bells, would activate other plans: makeshift road blocks would appear all over Tyneside, in Newcastle itself at the West Road, Nuns Moor Road, Fenham Hall Drive, Shields Road, Walker Road, Heaton Road and Chillingham Road, for example; electricity would be cut by exploding charges at nodal points on the network; L.N.E.R. locomotives would disappear along country lines south of the Tyne (such as the Victoria Garesfield branch line) and then be disabled; on the Tyne and along the coast docks would be blocked and machinery disabled; fuel stores would be destroyed; the ferry landings at North and South Shields would be blown up and the ferries scuttled; and all major explosive and ammunition dumps would have their stocks either blown up or otherwise destroyed. A network of local HQs and supply stores were set up at locations such as Manors Railway Station, the Royal Grammar School and the Newcastle Co- op premises on Newgate Street.

Life Mykhaylo Olshavskyi was born in about 1700 in the village of Oƒæ≈°avica, from which he took his surname (which originally was ≈Ωidik). He studied philosophy in Ko≈°ice and than in the Jesuit college of Trnava. At the end of his studies, he was ordained asecular priest in 1725 and assigned to the Eparchy of Mukacheve, where he later became vicar of the eparchs (bishops) Stefan Olshavskyi (who was his older brother) and Havryil Blazhovskyi. At the death of his predecessor, he was appointed on 8 February 1743 as general vicar by the Latin bishop of Eger: actually at that time, following the Union of Uzhhorod, the eparch of Mukacheve was formally an apostolic vicar of the Latin diocese. In a few months he was elected to the position by the clergy, designated by the Empress Maria Theresa, and so confirmed by Pope Benedict XIV on 5 September 1743. He received the titular see of Rhosus and was consecrated bishop on 9 December 1743 by the bishop of FƒÉgƒÉra≈ü, Inocen≈£iu Micu-Klein. A short time before consecration, Mykhaylo Olshavskyi entered the Order of Saint Basil the Great and took the religious name of Manuil. In 1746 Manuil Olshavskyi was requested by Empress Maria Theresa to undertake a pastoral visit in Transylvania, that was at the time without Byzantine bishop due to the exile of Micu-Klein. He again returned in Transylvania in 1761 to address, with his authority and predication, the disturbance of the Orthodox monk Sofronie. In 1756 he completed and consecrated the sanctuary of M√°riap√≥cs which was started by his predecessor Gennadius Bizanczy. To serve the sanctuary, he built a monastery and assigned it to the Basilian monks. He also built schools in Mukachevo and in M√°riap√≥cs for the instruction of the clergy, and succeeded in obtaining the necessary funding. While his predecessors in Mukachevo lived in the Saint Nicholas Monastery, on request of the monks he built an episcopal residence in town. In 1764 he built, with his own money, a school of theology and one for cantors in Mukachevo. In 1759 he could write to Propaganda Fide that in his eparchy there remained no Byzantine faithful who were not in communion with the Catholic Church. However, the jurisdictional situation of his eparchy, formally an apostolic vicariate under the Latin bishop of Eger, was not satisfactory. So Manuil Olshavskyi contested the authority of the Bishop of Eger and tried to persuade Empress Maria Theresa to give full independence to the eparchy. He could not see the results of his work, but four years after his death, in 1771, the Eparchy of Mukacheve got its independence. Manuil Olshavskyi died in Mukachevo on 5 November 1767, and he was buried in the sanctuary of M√°riap√≥cs. Among his works, most memorable might be his .

Its long sandy beach and natural forest attract tourists, particularly in the summer months. The locality The locality of Ulvshale (which literally means \\"Wolf's Tail\\") stretches from Hegnede Bakke in the south east to Ulvshaleg√•rd in the north west. It consists mainly of summer houses along the sandy beach lined with small sand dunes. The earliest summer houses date from 1918, but many more were built in the 1930s and especially towards the end of the 20th century. √òsters√∏badet was built in 1930 as a seaside hotel but has since been used as a training centre for adults.

These were felled after a change in ownership in 1769 when the area began to be used as pasture for cattle and pigs. Despite complaints from local farmers, the forest was protected in 1839 under Danish regulations calling for the maintenance of all forests. New trees were planted in the middle of the 19th century, reviving the old forest.\\"Ulvshale M√∏n\\", Naturstyrelsen. Retrieved 23 April 2011. Now covering half the peninsula, the forest has since been allowed to grow freely for a considerable time. Narrow paths take visitors through all the most common Danish trees including beech, birch, elm, aspen, ash, alder, rowan and above all oak.Mabritt Levinsen, \\"Ulvshale\\", insula-moenia.dk. Retrieved 23 April 2011. Pastures The western side of the forested area is covered with extensive pastures offering excellent breeding grounds for a wide variety of birds including ducks, geese and herons as well as many migratory birds. The cattle and sheep grazing here improve conditions for the birds who feel safer when they can see all around thanks to the short grass. Flint Driven by sea currents, the flintstone pebbles in the Ulvshave area stem from M√∏ns Klint. A number of firms have exploited the resource, especially Ulvshave Stenv√¶rk. M√∏n is one of the few places in the world where flint is available for industrial use. Interest in exporting the resource began at the beginning of the 20th century and expanded especially in the 1920s and 1930s.

Its boiler is mounted on the centre frame, and two steam engines are mounted on separate frames, one on each end of the boiler. Articulation permits larger locomotives to negotiate curves and lighter rails that might restrict large rigid-framed locomotives. Many Garratt designs aimed to double the power of the largest conventional locomotives operating on their railways, thus reducing the need for multiple locomotives and crews. The initial plan had been to use these engines on the proposed air-conditioned trains that were being designed at the time. This never eventuated, although they did regularly haul The Midlander, mainly between Emerald and Bogantungan for some years. They were used on the Rockhampton Mail and Sunshine Express in the early 1950s.Information Sheet Beyer Garratt No. 1009 Workshops Rail Museum Builders The first 10 engines were constructed by Beyer, Peacock & Co. Ltd, Manchester. Owing to a full order book the company subcontracted the remaining 20 to Soci√©t√© Franco-Belge, Raismes, France. Livery All were painted Midland red and had chrome yellow lining with large QR monograms on the sides of the front tank and bunker. Unfortunately this attractive livery easily discoloured particularly as a result of priming. The engines were not regularly cleaned when relegated to goods train working in latter years and their appearance rapidly deteriorated. Service Originally trialled on the Brisbane to Toowoomba line, they were soon withdrawn from this section due to problems with limited clearances in the tunnels. They were used extensively on North Coast Line between Brisbane and Rockhampton. By 1956, this working had become restricted to mainly north of Bundaberg. They did not work north of St Lawrence on the North Coast Line. On the Central West Line they initially ran between Rockhampton and Emerald, and from 1957 their range was extended to Bogantungan. A few were based at Mayne until 1955 and some at North Bundaberg until 1956, when all were allocated to Rockhampton. In later years they worked Moura coal trains via Mount Morgan, prior to the opening of the short line to Gladstone. One of their last regular tasks was on limestone trains between Tarcoola and Gladstone. Increasing numbers of diesels saw mass withdrawals of these engines. Twenty two were written off in June 1968. Advantages and disadvantages They were subject to much positive publicity when introduced but failed to live up to all expectations. They were attributed with saving 19,500 miles of assistant and goods engine running on the Bundaberg ‚Äì Rockhampton ‚Äì Emerald sections between October 1950 and June 1951. Steaming difficulties were encountered with South Queensland coals; however they performed well on Blair Athol coal. The boilers had a tendency to prime. Limited coal and water capacity caused worries. General overhauls cost about three times those for a B18¬º class. Features They had a number of unique features (for QR steam engines) including Ajax air operated butterfly fire doors, Hadfield power reverse gear, speedometers and also flow meters; the latter being fitted to the class in 1955. The outer bogies and inner trucks had roller bearings but the coupled axles has plain bearings. Several engines received fabricated stove pipe chimneys to replace the original cast ones that had been damaged. Preservation No. 1009 was preserved as a static exhibit at the Redbank Locomotive Museum, was taken into North Ipswich Railway Workshops in 1993 and restored to working order. Subsequently, due to a leaking fusible plug, it was taken out of service.1009 Australian Steam Overhaul of the locomotive subsequently started but was halted due to costs. On August 3, 2020, it was announced by the Workshops Rail Museum that No. 1009 has been loaned from Queensland Rail to become a permanent exhibition at the museum which will be available to the public from the 8th of August in 2020.

It was found in the Lifua Member of the Manda Formation in the Karoo Supergroup. It was named and first described by Sidney Henry Haughton in 1932. The type species is Stenaulorhynchus stockleyi, a beaked herbivore measuring 1‚Äì6 meters in length.  Description = Dentition  The teeth of Stenaulorhynchus were conical, pointed, and composed mostly of dentine, although new unworn teeth may have had a thin layer of enamel. They were set deeply into and fused with the jaw bones. They are arranged with two-to-several rows of teeth on top and only a few on bottom. The middle row of maxillary teeth only occupied the posterior third of the jaw while the other rows extended all the way forwards and sometimes down the crest of the jaw. The teeth at the front of the mouth, by the beak, were smaller with larger teeth in the middle portion of the jaw. The lower teeth included one raised row of buccal teeth and several rows running diagonally on the medial and lingual portions. The teeth continued to grow throughout the animals life but, unlike with reptiles, the new teeth formed at the back of the tooth row. That happened within the groove on the surface of the lower jaw and three grooves on the maxilla. The lateral As they grew in, the teeth moved forward in the jaw through a combination of growth and remodeling. Instead of occluding their teeth together, Stenaulorhynchus had teeth that occluded against bone, which would wear the teeth down. Over time, the surfaces of the jaw bones would erode as well, causing the maxillary grooves to become shallower and more rounded.  Cranial  Some of the cranial features of Stenaulorhynchus include afrontal bone that is broader than it is long, the presence of a pineal foramen and a lack of ornamention on the jugal bone. Their postorbital The occipital condyles are significantly anterior to the quadrates and the quadrate and articular fit tightly together to form a jaw joint that wouldn't have allowed for much rotation. They area also known for their beak, formed at the front of their upper and lower jaws.  Postcranial  The dorsal vertebrae have a centrum that is taller than it is wide and slightly amphicoelous in shape. The parapophyses and prezygapophyses are distinct that have articular surfaces about 30 degrees above horizontal. The caudal vertebrae have tall neural spines and the second cervical rib has a backwards pointing spine. Their ischium fans out towards the rear of the animal. The humerus is robust. At the proximal end, the shaft is bent backwards and expanded along the coronal plane. The distal humerus has a flat posterior surface and a curved ectepicondylar groove. The radius and ulna are the same length. The femur is circular in cross-section and, as with the humerus, the proximal end is bent backwards. Both ends of the femur are expanded and the proximal end has no neck and a prominent greater trochanter. The distal end has thickened condyles with a groove on the lateral side.  Paleobiology  Microscopic analysis of thin-sections of bone have shown that Stenaulorhynchus had an determinant growth pattern, reaching 2/3 of their adult size within one year. The rate of bone deposition in the tibia and femur were 7-10 times higher within that year than in years 2-5. After 5 years of age, less than 1 micron of bone a day was deposited. It would have grown slower than archosauriformes, the South American rhynchosaur species, saurischian dinosaurs, and birds. Stenaulorhynchus continued to grow teeth throughout its life.Juveniles started out with three rows of upper teeth, with only one lateral to the main groove running along the upper surface of the maxilla. By the time they were adults, Stenaulorhynchus had several rows of maxillary teeth, one or more of which were lateral to the main maxillary groove. Older teeth would wear down with use and be resorbed where they contacted other teeth. Stenaulorhynchus may have been adapted for scratch- digging.  Discovery  The fossils were collected in 1930 by the British geologist G. M. Stockley during a survey commissioned by the Tanganyika Geological Survey Department. The goal was to better understand the ‚Äúeconomic possibilities‚Äù of the Ruhaha Basin within Tanganyika Territory. He primarily collected fossils that had weathered out of the rock on the surface. The fossil collection was then described by Sidney Henry Haughton. While Stenaulorhynchus is the dominant vertebrate in the Manda beds, they also included a Dicynodont and vertebrae from an unidentified Theropod. The specimens weren‚Äôt all correctly labeled since bones from different localities fit together. More surprisingly, a coprolite was mislabeled as a maxillary fragment. Haughton also described a species which he named Stenaulorhynchus major, which he said differed primarily in size, based on a distal left and right humerus fragments. Those specimens were later identified as Stagonosuchus nyassicus, a suchian archosaur from the same locality and horizon.  Classification  Stenaulorhynchus shares characteristics with other early rhynchosaurs, including their ankylothecodont dentition (teeth within deep sockets and fused to the bone) and precision-shear bite. They also have double-bladed dentaries and grooves on the upper surface of the maxilla. One of the differences between them is that Stenaulorhynchus had smaller maxillary teeth with a larger gap between the tooth rows. Stenaulorhynchus is differentiated from the later Hyperadapedon by its more lateral eyes, more forward braincase, and longer lower jaw with the teeth located more anteriorly. Hyperadapedons also lack the double-bladed dentary that the early genera have. The only absolute synapomorphy between all the rhynchosaurs is that the dentary is at least half the total length of the jaw. Stenaulorhynchinae, a subfamily of rhynchosaurs including Stenaulorhhynchus, has been proposed. Based on an analysis of morphological characteristics, one study defines it as including all taxa that are more closely related to Stenaulorhynchus stockleyi than Hyperodapedon gordoni. The defining traits include having many teeth on the tongue side of the maxilla and a reduced size of the maxillary occlusal teeth allowing more teeth per row. Stenaulorhynchus has also been labeled as a sister-taxa to the Brazilian genus Brasinorhynchus which also has three or more tooth rows medial to the main maxillary groove but lacks the centrum contribution to the parapophyses and diaphophyses.  Geology  Stenaulorhynchus is found in the Upper Bone Bed in the Njalili locality, part of the Lifua Member of the Manda Formation. It is composed of proximal floodplain paleosol deposits. Articulated specimens of Stenaulorhynchus have been found, suggesting that they may have mummified before burial. The surface of the bed has been exposed by tributaries eroding away the rock. During the Triassic, the floodplain would have been covered by springs and ponds. Rises in precipitation and mean annual temperature may have led to an increase in perennial vegetation, as well.

The Euthanasia Coaster would kill its passengers through prolonged cerebral hypoxia, or insufficient supply of oxygen to the brain. The ride's seven inversions would inflict 10 g on its passengers for 60 seconds ‚Äì causing g-force related symptoms starting with gray out through tunnel vision to black out and eventually g-LOC (g-force induced loss of consciousness). Subsequent inversions or another run of the coaster would serve as insurance against unintentional survival of passengers.

The display, designated as its 2011 'flagship exhibition' by the Science Gallery, aims to show the future of humans and technology. Within this theme, the Euthanasia Coaster highlights the issues that come with life extension. The item was also displayed at HUMAN+ exhibit at Centre de Cultura Contempor√†nia de Barcelona in 2015.

She is a Member of the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) Education Advisory Panel and regularly writes editorial for numerous publications, and has spoken at The Amazing Meeting Las Vegas, Dragon*Con (US), QED Con (UK). She was a presenter and Master of Ceremonies for the 2010 Global Atheist Convention and returned to the role in 2012. Her most recent book The Scope of Skepticism was released in 2012. She is a presenter at Perth's community radio station RTRFM, and a winner at the 2018 CBAA Community Radio Awards in the category of Talks, with the show Talk the Talk Influences From a young age Sturgess was influenced by art, literature and film. A background of non-fiction, documentary, comedy and human interest literature fostered her willingness to challenge authoritative statements concerning viewpoints said to be avoided. Her interest in investigative journalism exposed her to the negative results of scams and pseudoscience. Sturgess also credits the feminist writer Julie Burchill and popular science writer Mary Roach as being positive influences. Female skeptics Karen Stollznow, \\"Swoopy\\" Robynn McCarthy and Lynne Kelly are also important figures in Sturgess's skepticism background. Career Since 2003, Sturgess has gained Levels 1 and 2 accreditation in the Federation of Australasian Philosophy in Schools Association's ‚ÄòPhilosophy / Teacher Educator‚Äô. She went on to begin a Graduate Diploma in Psychology at Monash University by distance education in 2006. At the beginning of 2007 Sturgess had completed her first Masters of Education in Special Learning needs, with a particular focus on Gifted and Talented education and gender issues. For the final unit for her second Masters of Education, her thesis was on \\"Anomalistic beliefs in Australians : a Rasch analysis\\", and she was a co-author on a paper raising questions about the Wiseman and Watt‚Äôs short scales of positive and negative superstitions. Her professional background includes working for a number of private schools in Western Australia. In 2010 Sturgess taught Religious Education, Philosophy and Ethics. Currently, she is a volunteer at Perth's Scitech as she completes her Graduate Diploma in Psychology. Sturgess has created teaching resources and helped deliver professional development for the Curriculum Council and was a research assistant at Curtin University (on engagement in secondary schools in rural and remote areas). 6th World Skeptic Congress, 2012, Berlin \\"Why Can't a Teacher Be More Like a Scientist? ‚Äì Pseudoscience in Education\\"  Skepticism and speaking engagements  Sturgess' influence in skepticism began during The Amazing Meeting 3 where she helped as a volunteer. At the beginning of 2006, after an influential lecture on 'Teaching Critical Thinking in the Physical Sciences' by Liam McDaid of Sacramento City College, the West Australian Skeptic Association ran an Award for challenging pseudo-scientific and paranormal claims. Sturgess used this opportunity as a 'theme' for her Term 2 upper-ability English class (along with studies of Macbeth, GATTACA and The Chrysalids) who subsequently submitted six group reports. The class was commended with two awards and one honourable mention; later repeated in 2007 with two Awards and three honourable mentions. Sturgess was recognised for this work by a runner-up award by the Australian Skeptics in 2006. At that conference, she presented a speech written by the West Australian Skeptics regarding their project and their request for support. As a result, she was invited to present an essay for Radio National in December 2006, which also became an article in the Australian Skeptics. When she won the Australian Skeptics Critical Thinking Prize in 2007, she used the proceeds to begin her Graduate Diploma in Psychology. Sturgess was a presenter of a paper at the James Randi Educational Foundation's The Amazing Meeting 5, with the title \\"The West Australian Skeptics Awards for Young Critical Writers: Investigations and Questions about Future Directions when Studying High School Students‚Äô Beliefs in the Pseudoscientific and the Paranormal.\\".

He started in the field of specialized renovation. Since 2005 he researches and writes about personal development, intangible assets and human sustainable development. Today he is Professor at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Vesalius College, as expert in economic transition. Early life and career Michel de Kemmeter attended the Rijksuniversiteit Gent University in Belgium. Later on, he attended the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven for the degree in Sales Engineer. His works were published in French language, English and German. His first published books were reference books on construction materials, such as natural stone, blue stone and wood. In this field of work, he has started a business specialized on treatment and solutions to pathology of natural stone and chemistry/physics of the stone after installation. In 1996 he has started to invest on Real Estate in Belgium and since then has been sharing experiences as investor in private housing with Fortune de Briques at √âditions Racine. Human development work In 2001 he worked on the \\"Motivation Wheel\\", a psychological tool for a circular analysis of human characteristics, such as behavior, values, concerns, needs and desires for inner fulfillment. This work explained about an interpretative framework for connecting \\"doing\\" and \\"being\\" through aspirations, fears and internal strengths. The model was designed to be used for corporate aspects, such as corporate culture development, time management and values, evaluation of intangible assets, coaching and individual's mentoring. The 7D-Value approach, based on the 7 levels of value is also used to map excellence and potential of individuals. Later, in 2005, he published the book \\"The Value of Time\\" and the \\"Die Werte der Zeit\\" edition by the publisher Swinti Verlag GmbH, and \\"La Valeur du Temps\\" in 2006 by √âditions Racine. The book was a work of philosophy and psychology applied to management and life. It gave a different perspective to the Greek nations of chronos, kairos and aion in a way to find openness of self to life. Today, he is a consultant and trainer of this subject at the Free University of Brussels and at the University of Louvain-la-Neuve (Louvain School of Management). Present De Kemmeter has started in 2006 a network of reflection and innovation on human development and societal development, named UHDR (Universal Human Development and Research). This network of collaborators has been creating tools for development of human potential, self-connection and experiential conscious mentoring, in collaboration with medics, sportsmen, companies, universities, philosophers and therapists. Some works of the network were \\"7D-Value\\" (for purpose, knowledge, communication, processes and emotional balance sheets within companies), and \\"Culture Coherence\\" (approaching circles of coherence in organizations). These tools aim to give assessments of perceived corporate identity, positioning relative to competitors, values, strengths and development areas, assessment and quantification of intangible assets, customers satisfaction, and a consistency's degree of the company. In 2008, he has founded UniverseCit√© UHDR (UHDR UniverseCity) of Sustainable Human Development, which has the goal of bringing \\"soft skills development\\" based on concepts of collective intelligence and experimental learning. In his research, he works on transdisciplinarity, on systems theory, systemics, prospective, on sociology and applied psychology. He is the inventor of the \\"Resources Systemics\\" approach, new model for systemic economy and society. It is based on 3 principles: (1) Every project, company or organisation should contribute to common good. (2) Every company, person, team, city authority or other stakeholder has assets and liabilities on 7 levels (earth, material, processes, emotional, communication, knowledge, common good) (3) Every project should add value on different levels in its stakeholders ecosystem. It activates underused or hidden resources in its stakeholders ecosystem for the project. It creates \\"multiple value streams\\", and thus new solutions, new business models. The result is more agility, faster implementation, less risk, more output with less resources. These resources can only be activated if the project answers needs of stakeholders. He works on transition economy and transition methodologies based on metamorphosis principles. Specialized in updated transition economy principles and models, he brings these new principles to corporations and governments. He initiated the \\"Club of Brussels\\" inside the Economic Transition Center in Brussels, school of new economic thinking. A group of 250 experts worldwide. It is an international network of ready-for-change human beings. The idea is not only to think about the new economic models based on systemic use of resources, but also to implement actions for the promotion of economic transition.

As such, finding a new spot of land for Tom Sawyer Island became mandatory. In the end, Imagineers decided that an Adventureland-themed island, complete with the Swiss Family Treehouse, would fit as a centerpiece in Adventureland. Adventure Isle is divided into two smaller islands. Northern Island This island is home to the Swiss Family Treehouse. In this park, the attraction was given a more detailed environment. For example, under the tree guests can explore Le Ventre de la Terre (The Earth's Belly), a network of dark caves filled with roots from the tree above, which the Swiss Family uses as cellar. Also, in La Mer des Bretteurs (The Swordmen Sea) nearby lies the wrecked ship the castaways originally used. In this part, French is used as the main language. An elevated wooden bridge and another floating one link this island to the Southern one. Southern Island This is a more rocky landscape, featuring Captain Hook's Pirate Ship moored near Skull Rock. A small playground area lies near the ship, called La Plage des Pirates (Pirates Beach). A huge mountain, known as Spyglass Hill, stands on this part, and is mainly composed of mazes and caves. A treasure is hidden inside. Some caves refer to the Disney movie Treasure Island (one is called Ben Gunn's Cave). Here, English is the main language.

His state funeral was held in the capital city of Ankara on 21 November, and was attended by dignitaries from seventeen nations. His body remained at the Ethnography Museum of Ankara until 10 November 1953, the fifteenth anniversary of his death, when his remains were carried to his final resting place at Anƒ±tkabir.  Death and tributes  During 1937, indications of Atat√ºrk's worsening health started to appear. In the early 1938, while he was on a trip to Yalova, he suffered from a serious illness. After a short period of treatment in Yalova, an apparent improvement in his health was observed, but his condition again worsened following his journeys first to Ankara, and then to Mersin and Adana. Upon his return to Ankara in May, he was recommended to go to ƒ∞stanbul for treatment, where he was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver. During his stay in ƒ∞stanbul, he made an effort to keep up with his regular lifestyle for a while, heading the Council of Ministers meeting, working on the Hatay issue, and hosting King Carol II of Romania during his visit in June. He stayed on board his newly arrived yacht, Savarona, until the end of July, after which his health again worsened and then he moved to a room arranged for him at the Dolmabah√ße Palace. Atat√ºrk's death certificate, signed by nine medical professors, officially declared that the founder and President of the Turkish Republic had died at 09:05 local time on November 10, 1938 in the state residence of Dolmabah√ße Palace in Istanbul from his long-lasting illness.ƒ∞stanbul mayor's page  Services  Preparations started for the state funeral of Atat√ºrk organized by the leading officials. However, no decision was made yet for the final resting place. The next day on November 11, the parliament in Ankara convened and elected ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º as the new president.T√ºrkiye'nin 75 Yƒ±lƒ±, Tempo Yayƒ±ncƒ±lƒ±k, 1998, ƒ∞stanbul, p.79.  Religious service  No religious funeral service was at first foreseen. However, his sister Makbule Atadan, who stayed at the palace for several days, insisted on a religious funeral service to be held in a mosque, as is normally the case, before her brother's body was transferred to Ankara. She was subsequently convinced by the President of Religious Affairs Rƒ±fat B√∂rek√ßi that an Islamic funeral service may also be held outside of a mosque. The funeral prayer was conducted at 08:10 local time in the morning of November 19 by Prof. ≈ûerafettin Yaltkaya, Director of the Institute for Islamic Studies, in Turkish, not in the traditional Arabic. During the religious ceremony, photographs were not allowed. The funeral prayer was attended by people who were close to him, some generals, religious officials, palace servants and Hafƒ±z Major Ya≈üar Okur, who served with Atat√ºrk for fifteen years.  Catafalque  Prof. Mehmet K√¢mil Berk, one of the signers of the death certificate, bound Atat√ºrk's jaw with a silk handkerchief and his big toes with a bandage, as per Islamic rites. Since the burial would be delayed, his body was embalmed by pathologist Prof. L√ºtfi Aksu, who came for this purpose from the G√ºlhane Military Medical Academy (GMMA) in Ankara. His body then lay in repose while his sister Makbule Atadan, high-ranking government officials and officers, and other influential people came at specified times to pay their respects. Atat√ºrk's body was put in a zinc-lined mahogany casket of walnut wood. The flag-draped casket was placed on November 16 in the reception hall of the palace on a catafalque. It was flanked by three high torches at each side symbolizing the six pillars of Kemalist ideology and crowned by wreaths for lying in state. For three days, thousands of mourning people paid their respects passing by the catafalque, where an honor guard of officers stood vigil.  Transfer to the capital city  Following the funeral prayer, Atat√ºrk's casket was taken out the Dolmabah√ße Palace, placed on a horse-drawn caisson and brought in front of a cortege to G√ºlhane Park. From Seraglio Point, a torpedo boat forwarded it to the battlecruiser . Turkish navy ships and foreign vessels escorted TCG Yav√ªz with Atat√ºrk's casket aboard until off B√ºy√ºkada. Yav√ªz carried then Atat√ºrk's body to Izmit. Subsequently, Atat√ºrk's casket was transferred to a funeral train in Izmit that brought it to Ankara arriving the next day on November 20. In Ankara, President ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º, Speaker of the Parliament Abd√ºlhalik Renda, Prime minister Celal Bayar, government ministers, Chief of the General Staff Marshal Fevzi √áakmak, high- ranked officers and members of the parliament were all present during the arrival of the funeral train in the Ankara Central Station.  State funeral  Atat√ºrk's casket was brought on a caisson to the building of Turkish Grand National Assembly in Ulus, where it was placed on a catafalque in front of the parliament building for lying in state. Thousands of residents of Ankara paid their respects. The next day, on November 21, a grander funeral ceremony was held, at which dignitaries from seventeen countries attended. The cortege with Atat√ºrk's flag-covered casket on a horse-drawn caisson processed to the Ethnography Museum of Ankara escorted also by nine armed detachments from foreign nations, among them British, Iranian and Yugoslavian guards of honor.  Transfer to Anƒ±tkabir = Temporary resting place  Arrived at the Ethnography Museum of Ankara, Atat√ºrk's casket was placed inside a white marmor sarcophagus specially built along with the covering Turkish flag. Officials planned a monumental mausoleum for Atat√ºrk at the topmost hill in Ankara, Rasattepe as it was called that time. During the fifteen years required for the mausoleum's construction, the Ethnography Museum of Ankara became Atat√ºrk's temporary resting place.  Final resting place  Cumhuriyet 11 November 1938 issue announcing the death of President Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk After completion of Anƒ±tkabƒ±r in 1953, his sarcophagus was opened and his casket was taken out with the help of a trispastos in the presence of his sister Makbule Atadan, President Celal Bayar, Parliament speaker Refik Koraltan, Prime Minister Adnan Menderes, Chief of General Staff Nuri Yamut, Abd√ºlhalik Renda and some other high officials. The casket was placed on a catafalque. Pathologist Prof. Kamile ≈ûevki Mutlu from the Faculty of Medicine at Ankara University was tasked by Kemal Ayg√ºn, the governor of Ankara, with the opening of the casket, the inspection of the remains and the supervision of the preparations for the subsequent burial, which is required by funeral traditional customs. On November 9, her colleagues Dr. Cahit √ñzen and Dr. ≈ûeref Yazgan and ten teachers of the technical vocational high school assisted her at this operation attended by high state officials. After opening of the casket's zinc lining, a brown plastic sack holding his remains came into appearance supported by wood splints. Following the removal of the plastic sack and the shroud inside wrapping his body, it was seen that Atat√ºrk's body remained intact and unputrified thanks to the perfect embalming by Prof. L√ºtfi Aksu, who died in 1951. A sample of the embalming chemical used was found in the casket in a sealed bottle, labeled with the chemical's description. The dignitaries present climbed one by one to the catafalque and looked at Atat√ºrk's face. Following the advice of Mutlu, the casket was closed again after treatment of the remains with a special fixator and wrapping in shroud again. On November 10, the 15th anniversary of Atat√ºrk's death, his flag-covered casket was taken out the Ethnography Museum and carried on the shoulders of twelve soldiers onto a caisson. 138 young reserve officers in a procession that stretched for two miles (3 km) including the President, the Premier, every Cabinet minister, every parliamentary deputy, every provincial governor and every foreign diplomat, while at the same time 21 million Turks stood silently and motionless for five minutes all over the country. One admiral guarded a velvet cushion which bore the Medal of Independence; the only decoration, among many others held, that Atat√ºrk preferred to wear. The Father of the Turks finally came to rest at his mausoleum, the Anƒ±tkabir. An official noted: In the cortege, the leaders of different religious communities in Turkey as the Armenian Patriarch, Greek Orthodox Patriarch, Roman Catholic Bishop and Jewish Chief Rabbi marched along with the Muslim President of Religious Affairs of Turkey.

It is a fine example of the provincial Mughal style of architecture introduced in Bangladesh in the 17th century. The mosque's most notable features are its seven bulbous domes crowning the roof and covering the main prayer hall. Probably erected by Governor Shaista Khan, the monument stands in a romantic setting on a buttressed 15-foot-high bank overlooking an extensive flood plain.Ahmed, Nazimuddin (1984). Discover the Monuments of Bangladesh. UNESCO. pp. 174‚Äì175. History Sir Charles D'Oyly in 1814 A few kilometers to the north of Peelkhana, for long the end of Mughal Dhaka, was the Jafarbad or Katasur area, originally part of mouza Sarai Begumpur. Many of the mouzas (or revenue circles) were delineated during the reign of Shershah and later by Kartalab Khan. A small urban settlement on a route along the river, this was an alternative to reach Brahmaputra or Garh Jaripa without having to go through the hostile areas along the main stream of Sitalakhya and Brahmaputra on the east. This is evident from its geographic and strategic location, origin of the names of the locality, and the remnants around it. The place where the seven-domed mosque is was known as Sarai Jafarbad or Katasur, under Sarai Begumpur. There was a small agricultural community in between Pilkhana and Jafarbad where the Sat Gambuj Mosque was built. The area became like a jungle due to disuse, dereliction, and desertion mainly during the British period. However, in last 55 years, it has become one of the most planned and most expensive residential enclaves of Dhaka. The Sat Masjid Road is the major peripheral road of the district to its west and is believed to have been built roughly along where the old Bank river Turag was.Rahman, Mahbubur (2011). City of an Architect. Delivistaa Foundation. . pp. 293‚Äì294. Structure Picturesquely situated on the edge of a river, the Sat Gambuj Mosque's exterior is the most innovative of all the Dhaka Mughal-period monuments. The north and south ends of this three-domed rectangular mosque are each marked by two enormous double-storied corner pavilions; when viewed from the east these give the impression that the mosque has five exterior bays. On the east are three cusped entrances arches flanked by shallow niches. Slender engaged columns with bulbous bases demarcate the central bay (as seen as the Lalbagh Fort Mosque, although this mosque's colonettes are more prominent). Its interior compares favourably with that of others dating to the second half of the 17th century. The central mihrab has two rows of cusping, and its surface is embellished with moulded plaster relief, recalling the ornateness of the mihrab in the mosque of Haji Khwaja Shahbaz.Michell, George, The Islamic Heritage of Bengal, pg 61, UNESCO, , published in 1984 It used forms shapes‚Äîoctagon, square, rectangle and circle‚Äîall beautifully juxtaposed. Besides the typical three domes on the main prayer hall, there are four hollow double-storey domed corner towers that gave rise to its name (Seven-Domed Mosque). The corner turret provided structural stability and visual balance to the 38'√ó27' building on a river bank and was probably used as viewing galleries for enjoying the river. The upper level of the octagonal turrets starts from around half the height of the main prayer hall. Both levels have arched panels and windows, surmounted by cornice and capped by domes with kalasha (pitcher) finials planted on lotus base. Otherwise with a bigger dome in the middle flanked by two smaller ones, the mosque bears all the characteristic features of Shaista Khani style. However, though the qibla facades of most such buildings remain unadorned, that of the Sat Gambuj Mosque is decorated with recessions within moulded panels, the middle portion delineated by two slender pilasters slightly protruding. These are much bigger than those usually seen at the front. The three central panels have an arch- shape on the lower part. The mosque has three cusped entrance arches, the middle one being taller and edged with multi-foil arch, a late-Mughal refinement, flanked by shallow niches and rectangular panels and echoed by mihrabs on the qibla wall, slender engaged pilasters with bulbous base demarcating the central bay, mihrab surface embellished with moulded plaster relief, corner turret stretched above merlon parapet with pinnacles, single, openings on side walls, etc. The side entrances have mere decoration applied to their external faces some of which may not be original. All these elements emphasize the symmetrical and axial arrangement along with the central dome and the mihrab. The style is very common among most of the surviving historic mosques of Dhaka. Built on a spacious and solid podium, it has many elements resembling those in Khwaja Shahbaz Mosque, Khan Muhammad Mirdha's Mosque, and the mosque inside the Lalbagh Fort. The heights of the entrances and other openings have been distorted or dwarfed by elevation of the plinth level as the ground around was constantly elevated to remain above flood level. However, the two slender pinnacles rising on both sides of the panel provide a kind of vertically to this otherwise horizontal and stout structure. This element achieved a level of perfection and hence elegance in the Mridha's Mosque built quarter of a century later. There are eight small panels on each side of the door, all of which are enclose arched niches. The transition from the square to the circle of the dome base is made by pendentives. However, the domes are conventional, rest on octagonal drum shoulder, embellished with blind merlons. The brick lime walls of the naturally cool structures are 4 feet deep. There is a graveyard in front of the mosque used as late as the 1950s. It was originally inside a wider garden that was gradually eroded by river and encroached by buildings. A distinct gateway in front of the sahn that was now subsided because of gradual rise in the surrounding levels can be climbed over for azan (prayer call). The river Turag on which the picturesque structure was standing even few decades back, has now moved nearly a kilometer away from it due to silt, encroachment by filling up, and change of course. The surrounding reclaimed lands for many years were used by small scale manufacturers, semi-permanent houses and slums. But now heavier and more intensive uses can be seen. Present condition Sat Gambuj Mosque (interior), Dhaka, Bangladesh Nawab Khwaja Ahsanullah had the abandoned structure re-embellished as it was later listed in 1913 by the ASI. Due to its uninterrupted use and some care and maintenance since then, the mosque did not require any renovation. However, in the past, the DOA made several unacceptable modifications while carrying out periodic repairs that show the poverty of its mind. For example, the use of terrazzo on the floor of the main prayer hall and the courtyard is contrary to normal conservation practices that would have avoided using most modern materials to maintain an authenticity. Some recent renovation jobs, for example applying the thick white plaster, have also drawn criticism from experts. Like in and around many other heritage structures all over the country, the premises of Sat Gambuj Mosque is occupied by religious groups building illegal structures and extensions to the listed building, ignoring its heritage value, building codes and rules, fiercely protecting their possessions. Few travelers see Sat Gambuj Mosque because of its somewhat remote location.McAdam, Marika, Bangladesh, pg 51, Lonely Planet, , published in 2004 See also * List of mosques in Bangladesh * List of archaeological sites in Bangladesh ReferencesExternal links Category:17th-century mosques Category:Mosques in Dhaka ","title":"Sat Gambuj Mosque"},{"id":"31573649","text":"The First National Bank is a five-story building in Grand Forks, North Dakota, that was built in 1914‚Äì15 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It was built for the Scandinavian-American Bank, but has been identified as the First National Bank building since 1929. History When it was founded, the Scandinavian-American Bank had its offices in the Metropolitan Opera House in Grand Forks. The new bank building was constructed in 1914‚Äì15 and occupied in 1915. When the bank later obtained a charter as a national bank, it took the name Northwestern National Bank. In 1929, it merged with the First National Bank, and the combined bank located in this building. and First National Bank failed in 1933, during the Great Depression, but was replaced by a new First National Bank entity that later became Alerus Financial in 2000. The building is located on a corner lot, approximately in size, at the intersection of DeMers Avenue and North Fourth Street. It is considered an \\"outstanding example\\" of the use of Classical Revival architecture in the context of a large commercial building. The two sides that face the street have two-part facades in which the lower two stories are fronted by rusticated ashlar piers built on top of polished granite blocks and the three upper stories are faced with red brick. The top of the building is decorated with a stone cornice. The property was included in a 1981 study of the historical resources of downtown Grand Forks. It was damaged by flooding and fire in the 1997 Red River flood; it is the only building on the block that was not demolished as a result of flooding and fire.

She was named for the United States Navy Commodore Stephen Decatur, who served with distinction in many of America's earliest conflicts. She was the largest privateer out of Charleston. The Royal Navy captured Decatur in 1814. Career Decatur is best known for being commanded by Captain Dominique Diron, who captured several British ships during the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812. Captain Diron defeated the stronger Royal Navy schooner in an action off Bermuda on 5 August 1813. After a long engagement the Americans chased down Dominica and boarded, forcing down her colors and killing her commander in the process. The next day, Decatur captured the merchantman London Trader and sent her into Charleston, where she arrived on 20 August. London Trader, Sinclair, master, had been carrying a cargo of 200Hhds of sugar, 120Hhds of molasses, 70 bags of coffee, rum, cotton, and the like from Surinam to London.Lloyd's List, ‚Ññ4815 Accessed 8 August 2016.Lloyd's List, n¬∞4816 Accessed 8 August 2016. London Trader may have been in company with Dominica, and though armed, had taken no part in the battle. Similarly, the merchantman Princess Charlotte, also in company and also armed, had observed the battle and when she saw that Dominica had surrendered, had herself escaped. Decatur also captured General Hodgson, sailing from Surinam to Cayenne, and sent her into Charleston.Lloyd's List, n¬∞4821 Accessed 8 August 2016. In November Decatur went to sea again. However, after cruising for 80 days without success, returned to Charleston. On 22 May 1814, recaptured Dominica, and brought her into Halifax.Lloyd's List 9 August 1814. Dominica was lost in 1815. Fate On 5 June 1814 sighted and gave chase to an American privateer schooner. After an eleven-hour chase Rhin captured the privateer in the Mona Passage, about four leagues from Cape Enga√±o. She turned out to be Decatur, still under Diron's command. Decatur, of four guns and 90 men, had sailed from Charleston on 30 March and had made no captures.Lloyd's List 2 August 1814.

Dimensions Launch of Manx Maid, 23 January 1962 Tonnage 2724; length 325'; beam 50'; depth 18'; speed 21 knots; bhp 9,500. Construction costs were ¬£1,087,000, the first vessel of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company to cost over one million pounds. Manx Maid was launched by Mrs. A. Alexander at Birkenhead, on Tuesday 23 January 1962. Service life The \\"Maid\\", as she was always affectionately known, was certified for 1400 passengers and a crew of 60. In engineering terms she was very similar to her predecessor except for Babcock & Wilcox integral furnace boilers, installed instead of the sectional header type. Manx Maid was a great success and was of major importance in the history of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, as she was the first vessel to be designed as a car ferry; she had the capacity for up to 90 cars and light commercial vans. The design principle for vehicle loading was simple. A spiral set of ramps at the stern linked with the car deck, so that vehicles could be driven on or off from the appropriate level on departure or arrival. This patented system of ramps facilitated loading and unloading at any state of the tide, at any of the ports served by the company. Cars had been carried to the Isle of Man for many years prior to Manx Maid's arrival, but with the tidal range at Douglas being considerable, it necessitated taking the vehicle on and off by crane, a slow and irksome process. Consequently, the carriage of cars had never reached large proportions. The decision to construct a new generation of car-ferrying vessels was taken by the company in 1959, and in 1960 a contract was placed with Cammell Laird. Manx Maid was launched on 23 January 1962. The design of the 'side-loader' with a spiral ramp at the stern was a unique feature of the Steam Packet Company's car ferries (Manx Maid, , and ). She was the first Company vessel to be fitted with anti-roll stabilisers.Ships of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company (Fred Henry) p.43 In November 1974 Manx Maid collided with the Fort Ann Jetty in Douglas Harbour during rough conditions. No one was hurt in the collision, but the vessel had to be dry-docked at Birkenhead. During her repairs she was the focus of an industrial dispute and only returned to service on 27 May 1975, just in time for the busy T.T. Period.Ships of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company (Fred Henry) p.43 Manx Maid was the thirteenth vessel built for the Steam Packet by Cammell Laird; since the first was delivered by the yard in 1910. In 1979 Manx Maid was fitted with a 500 horsepower bow thruster mechanism, similar to that fitted to her younger sister Ben-my-Chree the previous winter. Disposal With the introduction of Manx Line's ro-ro service (operated by ) between Douglas and Heysham, the inefficiency of the Steam Packet's side-loading car ferries became increasingly apparent, and the decision was made to retire both the Manx Maid and her younger sister Ben-my-Chree. Whilst their higher fuel consumption would initially be seen as the cost to dispose, the reality was the steam plants were very expensive to maintain, and just not as efficient. The Steamers averaged 9 tons of fuel on a Douglas - Liverpool trip whilst the motor ships and less than 4. After over 20 years of reliable service, Manx Maid made her final sailing from Douglas on Sunday 9 September 1984, ten days before her younger sister.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church stands to the southeast of the village, some east of Aylesbury. History The earliest parts of the church are chancel and north chapel which date from about 1250. Some carved fragments of stone dating from the 12th century indicate that an earlier church stood on the site. The north and south aisles were added in the later part of the 13th century. During the 15th century the chancel was lengthened, the north vestry and the tower were added, the nave arcades were demolished and the north arcade was rebuilt. The church was restored in 1893. A further restoration took place during the 20th century. The church was declared redundant on 23 January 1973, and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 28 June 1974. It is cared for by a group known as the Friends of Pitstone Church. The church is open to visitors on Sunday afternoons in the summer. Events and occasional services are held in the church. Architecture=Exterior The church is constructed in limestone and flint. The upper part of the nave walls and the north aisle are roughcast. Brick repairs have been carried out to the chancel, and the roofs are covered in lead. The plan consists of a wide nave, incorporating the former south aisle, a north aisle, a south porch, a chancel with a chapel and a vestry to the north, and a west tower. The axis of the chancel is inclined to the north. The tower is in three stages, and has diagonal buttresses, an octagonal southeast stair turret, and an embattled parapet. In the bottom stage is a west doorway, above which is a three-light window. In the middle stage on the north, west and south sides is a slit window. On the south side of the top stage are two lancet bell openings; on the other sides the bell openings have two lights. The south wall of the nave has a plain parapet, two three-light windows, and a projection at the east for a stairway to the rood loft. The south porch also has a plain parapet. Along the wall of the north aisle are buttresses, two lancet windows, and a doorway. The north chapel has a plain parapet, and two Perpendicular style windows. At the east end of the vestry is a lancet window. The chancel is in Decorated style, with a battlemented brick parapet with a stone coping, a three-light east window, and three two-light windows in the south wall. Interior In the south wall of the nave near the door is a stoup, and to its east is the entry to the rood loft stairs. In the east wall is a squint. The north arcade has three bays with octagonal piers. In the north chapel is a piscina with a crocketted gable, a recess in the north wall, and a 19th-century grate in the northeast corner. The chancel is floored with tiles from the 14th and 15th centuries. The font dates from the 12th century and has a fluted bowl and stem. The 17th-century pulpit is hexagonal and has a sounding board. The triangular reading desk is dated 1685. The altar table and the pews also date from the 17th century; two of the pews are box pews. The 18th-century communion rails have twisted balusters.

The original house was built in 1717 as a hunting lodge for the Duke of Schomberg. It was destroyed by fire and the present house was built in its place in 1844. The British Government purchased Hillingdon House in 1915 and it became a military hospital. In 1917, what would become the Royal Air Force station RAF Uxbridge was established within the grounds. In military use, the house has served over time as the first headquarters for No. 11 Group RAF and RAF Bomber Command. The River Pinn passes through the grounds of the house from north to south, splitting the former RAF Uxbridge in two. The Hillingdon House Farm estate to the north of the house includes the Hillingdon Sports and Leisure Complex (formerly Uxbridge Lido). The farm ceased operations in 1965 after the local council served a notice to quit on the tenant. The farmhouse on Honeycroft Hill became a council depot, followed by a plant nursery, before it was sold for residential housing.Pearce 2009, p.66 Under plans approved in early 2011 for the redevelopment of the RAF station, the house will be renovated and converted to include a restaurant. As of 2014 it is not accessible to the public while the site undergoes redevelopment. History=First house The first house on the site was built as a hunting lodge in 1717 for the Duke of Schomberg, a British army commander of German origin.Pearce 2007, p.43 He is said to have been very argumentative, to the point where he would argue with all those around him bar the enemy.Sherwood 2007, p.97 The house eventually passed to the Chetwynd family, who sold it to the Marchioness of Rockingham, widow of Prime Minister The Marquess of Rockingham, in 1786 for ¬£9,000. The Marchioness lived there until her own death in 1804, upon which the estate passed to her stepsister Elizabeth, widow of William Weddell MP. Her husband had left her Newby Hall in Mayfair, therefore having no need of Hillingdon House, she sold it to Josias Du Pr√© Porcher in 1805. In 1810 the estate was sold to Richard Henry Cox, a member of the Cox banking family and the grandson of Richard Cox, founder of the travel company Cox & Kings.Crozier 2007, p.5 Second house Hillingdon House, c. 1900 After the first house burnt down, the present structure was built in 1844, in a classical Victorian style. In 1892, an area of the estate south of the house was established as Hillingdon Golf Club, founded by Charles Newton who lived at Hillingdon House, and Charles Stevens, a partner of a local timber company.Pearce 2007, p.40 The estate of Frederick Cox, Richard Henry Cox's grandson, placed the house on the market in 1914, describing it as \\"a brick and stone building, partly stuccoed, with extensive outbuildings and ornamental gardens.\\" The house and gardens, together with the surrounding parkland and artificial lake created by damming a section of the River Pinn, amounted to more . The southern entrance to Hillingdon House, c. 1900, later to become St Andrew's Gate of the former RAF Uxbridge. The British Government bought the house and grounds in 1915, intending to construct a prisoner of war camp within the grounds. Local opposition to the plan led to the house becoming the Canadian Convalescent Hospital to care for troops evacuated from the front line during the First World War.Crozier 2007, p.6 The hospital opened on 20 September 1915 and closed on 12 December 1917, having had four commanding officers and five sisters-in-charge. On 19 November 1917, 114 officers and 1156 men of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) Armament School moved into Hillingdon House, with the RFC making a donation of ¬£2289 12s 9d to the Canadian Red Cross. Needing a site for the training of recruits in ground gunnery, the RFC used parts of the estate not required by the Canadian hospital and established a firing range on the opposite side of the river from the house. When the Royal Air Force was formed on 1 April 1918, following the merger of the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service, the Uxbridge site came under the control of the new service, becoming known as the RAF Central Depot, Uxbridge. The site was then split to form administratively two RAF stations: the area east of the River Pinn including Hillingdon House became RAF Hillingdon and the remainder RAF Uxbridge.Sherwood 2007, p.66 Among the aircraftmen trained at Hillingdon was T. E. Lawrence ('Lawrence of Arabia'), whose book The Mint, initially censored for its frank use of four- letter words, describes his time there: \\"Hillingdon House looked forlorn, because of its black windows, behind whose wideness the clerks lounged with their first cups of tea. 'Jammy [cunts],' sneered Sailor enviously.\\" Second World War air raid siren from the roof of Hillingdon House On 1 March 1929, the Royal Observer Corps established its headquarters at Hillingdon House, where it remained until transferring to RAF Bentley Priory on 1 March 1936.Crozier 2007, p.8 No. 11 Group formed on the same day under the command of Air Vice Marshal Philip Joubert de la Fert√©, using Hillingdon House as its headquarters.Crozier 2007, p.9 On 13 July, RAF Bomber Command was formed from the old HQ Air Defence of Great Britain and was also based in the house, remaining there until 1940 when the command moved to RAF High Wycombe. No. 11 Group was relocated to RAF Martlesham Heath in 1958, when control of RAF Hillingdon passed from Fighter Command to RAF Technical Training Command and the entire site became known as RAF Uxbridge. The RAF School of Education moved into Hillingdon House from RAF Spitalgate on 10 November. Southern Region Air Traffic Services HQ and the Royal Observer Corps' South East Communications Centre moved into the house in 1960.Crozier 2007, p.20 On 1 November, the Southern Region Air Traffic Services headquarters moved into Hillingdon House. The station had been home since the end of the war to the London Area Control Centre, renamed the London Air Traffic Control Centre in 1948 and the Uxbridge Air Traffic Control Centre in 1957. This eventually transferred to RAF West Drayton, which operated as a satellite station of RAF Uxbridge.Crozier 2007, p.32 HQ Military Air Traffic Operations (HQ MATO) moved into Hillingdon House in January 1965.Crozier 2007, p.21 During the final years of military ownership, Hillingdon House was occupied by the Service Prosecuting Authority and the Civil Aviation Authority's Air Proximity Board.Crozier 2007, p.3 The house was Grade II listed on 5 June 1984. Redevelopment On 31 March 2010, RAF Uxbridge closed as part of a rationalisation of Ministry of Defence facilities in Greater London. Under redevelopment plans approved by Hillingdon Council in January 2011, the house will be converted to include a restaurant. Provision has also been made to retain the carpenter's block beside the house. References Citations Bibliography * Crozier, Hazel. (2007) RAF Uxbridge 90th Anniversary 1917 - 2007.

The school had an urban farm in its backyard and provided day care and preschool education for the students' children. CFA received awards and was the subject of documentaries and media coverage due to its academic success. During 2010, its last full year of operation as a school district-operated public school, it boasted a 97 percent attendance rate and a 90 percent high school graduation rate, with the vast majority of students going on to either a two or a four-year college. As a member of Detroit Public Schools, it was under control of an Emergency Manager and scheduled to be shut in June 2011 as part of a system-wide deficit reduction plan. Protests and national media attention focused on keeping the school open, and the school's operations were privatized under a new district created for Blanche Kelso Bruce Academy, a charter operator with local ties. As of August 2011, state and federal funds amounting to $13,500 per student were to be going to the charter operator who ran the school on a for-profit basis. Background Catherine Ferguson Academy was founded in Detroit, Michigan in 1986 as a public school for pregnant girls and teen mothers. It was named after a freed slave who dedicated herself to education, though she was never allowed to learn to read or attend school as a child. CFA was housed in a former elementary school building which is about 90 years old, and had an urban farm in its backyard where the students learn to grow vegetables as well as other skills required for self-sufficiency. Most students came from lower income backgrounds‚Äîabout 78 percent qualified for free or reduced meal programs‚Äîand 97 percent were of African American descent. During the 2010 school year, CFA had a 97 percent attendance rate and a 90 percent high school graduation rate, with the vast majority of students going on to either a two or a four-year college. CFA was converted from a public to a charter school in the fall of 2011. The Academy was profiled in Oprah Magazine in 2008, and on the Rachel Maddow Show of April 22, 2011. It won the Breakthrough High School award in 2004 given by the National Association of Secondary School Principals for outstanding achievement among schools with high poverty rates. CFA was the subject of a 2010 award-winning documentary, \\"Grown in Detroit\\" by Dutch filmmakers Mascha and Manfred Poppenk in 2010. In 2010 Rev. Jesse Jackson honored the film with the NCRC 'Community Empowerment Film Award'. Admissions Incoming students were required be pregnant or have children. Some students lied to gain admission to the school by borrowing infants and representing them as their own or by using forged urine samples with those of pregnant friends. Mark Binelli, author of Detroit City is the Place to Be, wrote that this was due to Ferguson's \\"sterling reputation\\".Binelli, p. 119. Curriculum Catherine Ferguson Academy, along with the other schools in the Blanche Kelso Bruce Academy School District, adopted a project-based learning model called \\"Big Picture Learning\\" beginning in the 2012-13 school year. In addition, it provided child care for infants and early education for toddlers. Closing controversy, conversion, and eventual closure CFA was slated to close at the end of the 2010-2011 school year by order of the Emergency Manager of the Detroit Public Schools, Robert Bobb, if a buyer could not be found. The closure or sale was part of the Emergency Manager's deficit reduction plan to consolidate public high schools and increase class sizes to 60 students by 2013. A buyer was not found by the spring of 2011, and the school was scheduled to be shuttered. CFA students and teachers protested the decision by staging a sit-in and occupying the school during spring break, with 10 of the protesters arrested by the Detroit Police on April 16, 2011. Several of those arrested were charged with trespassing, but all charges were dropped in August 2011. Additional community reaction to the announced closing of CFA, and national media publicity, resulted in weeks of protest. Staff from CFA were promised 20 minutes to present their arguments for keeping the school open at a meeting to be held before Emergency Manager Bobb in early May‚Äî but the meeting was cancelled. On June 16, 2011 one hour before a public protest and rally, which included Danny Glover, was to begin, it was announced that CFA would remain open as a charter school. Critics called the decision a partial victory only because the school would no longer be subject to the legal requirements of public schools. Evans Solutions, a for-profit educational management organization, was announced to run the school as part of its Blanche Kelso Bruce School District which runs charter schools in juvenile detention facilities and involuntary residential facilities. CFA remained tuition-free to students with operating funds of approximately $13,500 per student provided to the charter operator by state and federal programs. Blair Evans, CEO of Evans Solutions, announced that the school's programs would continue unchanged, however, the staff would have to work in a \\"non-union environment\\". Several teachers would not be returning to the school because it would no longer be part of the Detroit Public Schools system. G. Asenath Andrews, the school's principal since 1986, said new teachers would be hired and that as a result of the school's privatization, the students would have more access to funds and services than before. The school already had farm animals such as goats, chickens, roosters and seasonally a horse. CFA separated from the Blanche Kelso Bruce school district and was awarded an independent charter through Wayne RESA in 2013. As an independent charter, it was considered its own school district, and Asenath Andrews became superintendent; former assistant principal Darnetta Banks became principal. Enrollment declined, however, and CFA closed on June 30, 2014. The Detroit Public Schools have chartered a school, Pathways Academy, to replace CFA and serve the needs of pregnant Detroit students and their children, set to open in Fall 2014.

When the El Qauroun Dam was built on the Litani River (the longest river in Lebanon) in 1959, Qaraoun village, lying on its left bank transferred an area of 740 ha for the development of the project. The ecoregions habitat composition is a delicate interface of dry lands with the riverine and lacustrine zones. Demographics, economy and development The population of the village is around 7,000. The development activity near the village, consequent to land area the Qaraoun village transferred for building of the El Qaraoun Dam in the middle reaches of the Litani River, which created an artificial lake () with water spread area of 1190 ha (the largest body of freshwater in Lebanon). The dam, which created the artificial lake or reservoir, is the largest dam built in Lebanon for multipurpose uses of hydropower generation (190 MW), irrigation (28,500 ha) and drinking water supply. It is a concrete-faced rockfill dam (CFRD) of 61 m height built with crest level at EL 801 m with a dam length of 1090 m, over karstic limestone formations. The reservoir has a storage capacity of 220 million cubic metres at maximum pond elevation of 858 m. The lake environment includes woodland, orchards and low-growing scrubs; it attracts about 20,000 migratory birds such as storks, pelicans and wintering fowl. The ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca), pallid harrier (Circus macrourus), greater spotted eagle (Aquila clanga), eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca) and sociable lapwing (Vanellus gregarius) are some of the birds which are of conservation concern according to the 2008 IUCN Red List. Archaeology Heavy Neolithic pick of the Qaraoun culture found at Mtaileb I - Double ended pick, triangular section with narrowing, jagged edges at both ends. Light grey and streaky silicious limestone. The town gives its name to the Neolithic Qaraoun culture of the Beqaa Valley notable for the Heavy Neolithic flint industry.Fleisch, Henri., Nouvelles stations pr√©historiques au Liban, Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Pr√©historique Fran√ßaise, vol. 51, pp. 564-565, 1954. There are several archaeological sites in the area. Qaraoun I (Left Bank) Qaraoun I is a Heavy Neolithic archaeological site of the Qaraoun culture, located on the left side of the Litani river, a little downstream from the Qaraoun Dam. It is an open site on the slope overlooking the river, west of the road to Kaukaba in stony fields about 200 m before a descent in the road that passes the dam. It was recorded as being 100 m down from the branching point of the Litani and north Cheeta at 300 m north of cote 801. Flint tools were found on the top of limestone cliffs where some soil had fallen away into a wadi. The site was discovered by Dubertret and studied by Henri Fleisch in a publication of 1954Fleisch, Henri., Nouvelles stations pr√©historiques au Liban. BSPF, vol. 51, p. 564, 1954. along with Jacques Cauvin in 1963.Cauvin, Jacques., Le n√©olithique de Mouchtara (Liban-Sud). L'Anthropologie, vol. 65, 1-2, p. 72 & 509 Materials recovered include picks, scrapers and axes with an abundance of waste blades, flakes and Levallois cores amongst others. Material was confirmed as a Heavy Neolithic site by Henri Fleisch in a personal communication to Lorraine Copeland in 1965. It is stored in the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory at Saint Joseph University and resembles the finds from Qaraoun II. Another collection was made on a visit with J. King in 1966 that included long blades, a few tidy bifaces, picks, rabots and huge Levallois cores. Collections made at this site in 1900 are also held in Croatia at the Archaeological Museum, Zagreb Museum Laboratory and in Bosnia and Herzegovina at the Museum of Sarajevo. Qaraoun II (Right Bank) Qaraoun II is the type site of the Heavy Neolithic Qaraoun culture in the Beqaa valley. It is located on top of a gorge on the right of the river. It is 100 m west of the branching point of the Litani and the north Cheeta, 700 m northeast of the base of the west Beliete, 100 m west of cote 833. It was found by Dubertret and studied by Henri Fleisch with publications covering the site in 1951, 1954 and 1960.Fleisch, Henri., Pr√©histoire au Liban en 1950, BSPF, vol. 48, 1-2, p. 26, 1951Fleisch, Henri., Les industries lithiques r√©centes de la B√©kaa, R√©publique Libanaise, Acts of the 6th C.I.S.E.A., vol. XI, no. 1, Paris, 1960 A large number of flints were found in numerous collections in 1952, 1954, 1958, 1959, 1961, 1963, 1964, 1966, 1968 and 1970. Studies of the materials were carried out by Jacques Cauvin and Marie-Claire Cauvin. It was also discussed by W. Van Liere and Henri de Contenson in 1963.Van Liere, W. & Contenson, Henri de., A note on 5 early Neolithic sites in inland Syria, AAS, vol. 13, p. 179, 1963 A large area of the site was completely destroyed by construction of workmen's houses leaving only a small section of original surface when surveyed in 1966 when another collection was made in 1966 by Lorraine Copeland in July 1966 that rescued several quality pieces. The site was originally recorded by the Jesuits as Acheulean but the flint collections were later found to be of much later date. It comprised a full range of Heavy Neolithic material with oval, almond shaped and rectangular axes, trapezoidal and rectangular chisels, thick discoid, side and end scrapers on large blades, picks and burins and a full range of cores. The industry is characterized by large, round, flat bifaces that were noted by Fleisch to have similarities to those found at Douwara and various other sites. The material from this site was in a pale, smooth, grey- cream chert that had patinated and is now held at the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory at Saint Joseph University. The Cauvins suggested the material had similarities to the Neolithic moyen assemblage from Byblos and Andrew Moore theorized that Heavy Neolithic stations such as this were used during earlier and later periods. James Mellaart suggested the Heavy Neolithic industry of the culture dated to a period before the Pottery Neolithic at Byblos (10600 to 6900 BCE according to the ASPRO chronology).Mellaart, James, Earliest Civilizations in the Near East, Thames and Hudson, London, 1965. Qaraoun III (Ain el Barde) Qaraoun III is 300 m northwest of the village, on the left bank of the river near the track going south towards Joub Jannine at the edge of the Sahel Qaraoun plain. It was discovered and materials collected by Jacques Cauvin who suggested they were Acheulean. The bi-facial pieces recovered were of exceptional high quality with various forms showing a great level of skill and workmanship. They are now held by the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory at Saint Joseph University. The site was wiped from the face of the map by the waters of the Qaraoun lake which formed after the construction of the El Waraoun dam.1 Henri Fleisch remarked in a personal communication with Lorraine Copeland that several other prehistoric sites exist in the same area, but with smaller amounts of material. In February 2003, heavy rainfall in the southern Beqaa Valley raised the water level of the Litani river around lake Qaraoun and caused further damage to the sites close to the banks. Maya Ha√Ødar Boustani has indicated that urgent archaeological fieldwork is required to investigate and protect the condition of the archaeological sites concerned.

Tr B'al≈´l ) is a town located in the eastern Bekaa Valley of southeastern Lebanon. Geography Baaloul is located in a remote area in the middle of mountainous areas. It limits to the east with the village of Lala and to the west with the village of Karaoun. Its current population is approximately 200 native people from the village, considering that many residents are living abroad. The main religion is Sunni Islam, but there are also Shia Muslims and a Catholic Christian family in the community. History In 1838, Eli Smith noted Baaloul's population being predominantly Sunni muslims.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, 2nd appendix, p. 141 This town is known for being one of the many marked by emigration from Lebanon. The first wave of migration that emerged in Baaloul was during the 1890-1910 period, prior to Lebanese independence and during the Ottoman rule of Lebanon. Consequently the early immigrants were classified as Turks or Turcos by the authorities of the countries they migrated to. The second displacement of its inhabitants began during the 70s, when the country was facing the beginning of a power struggle in the political and social field between the factions Muslim and Christian. Finally this struggle gave as a result the start of the Lebanese Civil War (1975 - 1990). The situation in the country was unstable and a sluggish economy and an increasingly bloody civil war that prevented raising their children; Many people decided to again begin to migrate. The people emigrated mainly to countries of Latin America, among which are: Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil and Panama; there were also significant numbers who moved to Canada and US. These migrations are mostly round trips: after achieving a stable economic support the immigrant population Baaloul returns again to dedicate himself to building homes for their families. Colombia it was one of the main destinations of emigration of people. Among the 70, 80 and 90 the Department of Colombian Guajira, specifically the population of Maicao was one of the places where the community was established. Today you can see a strong presence of migrants from Baaloul in the area. Venezuela is another destination countries, with the Isla Margarita and the Economic Zone Paraguan√° in the city of Punto Fijo where migrants are highly concentrated, focusing mainly trade dry goods. Panama in the 80's and 90 received the community of Baaloul, which focused on the Colon Free Zone, on the outskirts of Panama Canal imposing a trade regime and business in the locality. Brazil is one of the countries with the largest Lebanese communities around the world, even higher than the current population of Lebanon. Baaloul villagers are in the triple border Foz do Iguacu in the Province of Parana. Today, the population is divided Baaloul and ranks twenty-four family names surnames. These families joined entirely to a population of more than 1,200 people. The official language of Lebanon is Arabic, and as a second language French; however Baaloul the main language spoken by the community, both within the town and beyond this is the Spanish, given the number of emigrants to Spanish-speaking countries. After the Spanish the most widely used languages are Arabic, the English and Portuguese.

In the Soviet time, the hospital was called the Leningrad Special Psychiatric Hospital of Prison Type of the USSR Ministry of Internal Affairs.  History  The year of the foundation of SPbPBSTIN is 1951 when the Leningrad Special Psychiatric Hospital Prison Type of the USSR Ministry of Internal Affairs was organized by order of the interior minister S. N. Kruglov.  Pre-revolutionary period  The psychiatric hospital was established in the building of a former female prison built in St. Petersburg between 1909 and 1913 on the Vyborg Side, in an area that was given the name Kulikovo Field. As early as the 1870s, on the proposal of the Commission for Arranging Prison Sector, the Saint Petersburg City Duma allocated a public land plot of 4,800 square sazhens to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In 1882, the Main Prison Department acquired 6,000 square sazhens of land more to construct residential buildings for the prison staff. The constructed female prison had 816 mass cells, 123 solitary cells, 79 medical cells, and workshops with a total area of 426.49 square sazhens. There was also an income-producing laundry affiliated with the prison.  Soviet period (1918-1950)  On 6 January 1918, all institutions subordinate to the General Administration of Places of Confinement, and their buildings including the Petrograd Female Prison were transferred to the Prison Board of the RSFSR People's Commissariat (Ministry) for Justice. A general hospital covering many branches and medical specialities, situated in the grounds of the prison, was transferred to the People's Commissariat for Popular Health. This situation continued until 1932 when the hospital was also transferred to the Prison Department. The Leningrad SPH From 1951 onwards, as the Leningrad Special Psychiatric Hospital or SPH the institution became part of the punitive apparatus of the Soviet State. One of those incarcerated in the hospital was the mathematician Revolt Pimenov.

The agency is also responsible for the enforcement of fish and game laws, including commercial and recreational harvesting of the living marine resources along the state's coastline.  Mission  The mission of the Office of Law Enforcement, more commonly known as the Massachusetts Environmental Police, is to protect the environment and natural resources of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts through enforcement, education, and public outreach. The Office is further charged with protecting the health, safety, and individual rights of the public and preserving our environment for future generations.  Leadership  The Massachusetts Environmental Police is led by Colonel Shaun T. Santos. Santos was appointed in 2020. The agency is under the supervision and control of the Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs, who is appointed by the Governor. The current Secretary of EOEEA is Kathleen Theoharides.  History = Conservation laws in the 1600s  Massachusetts has had a long history of protecting its natural resources. Some of the earliest hunting and fishing laws date back to 1627 when the Colony of New Plymouth created a law that declared hunting, fowling, and fishing shall be free. The Massachusetts Bay Colony also declared hunting and fishing to be free in 1641. \\"Every inhabitant who is an house-holder shall have free fishing and fowling in any great ponds, bays, coves, and rivers so far as the sea ebbs and flows within the precinct of the town where they dwell unless the freeman of the same town or general court have otherwise appropriated them.\\" The colony also created many laws that paid bounties for killing wolves. In 1630, the colony created a law that paid one schilling to any colonist who killed a wolf. In 1640, the Massachusetts Bay Colony passed a law which gave forty schillings to any man who killed a wolf with hounds. Many colonists hunted wolves because forty schillings was a sizeable bounty in 1640. The 1640 bounty was equivalent to 27 days of a laborer's pay. \\"Early Massachusetts laws encouraged residents to keep dogs, such as mastiffs and greyhounds, to use in hunting wolves and authorized town governments to use public funds to purchase and keep wolf-hunting dogs. Towns were also required to set out and bait specific numbers of wolf traps. Any town that neglected its obligation to trap wolves was assessed a fine.\\" In 1636, a law was created which stated that no guns or iron traps could be used near the highway. During the colonial period, alewives were a very important fish used for food and fertilizer. Plymouth colony created some of the country's earliest fishing regulations to protect the alewives. In 1645, the colony created a law that prohibited the use of nets to catch alewives in the Sandwich river with a fine of ten pounds. In 1661, the Plymouth Colony banned any foreigner without permission from fishing on Cape Cod. In 1668, to protect cod, haddock, and pollock during spawning the Massachusetts Bay Colony banned all fishing in December and January. Fishing of mackerel was also banned in May and June. The penalty for fishing during the spawning period was 5 schillings per barrel. In 1670, the position of water bailiff was created to regulate the Cape Cod Fisheries. Thomas Paine was appointed as the first water bailiff. The law required residents of the colony to pay a duty of six pence per barrel of mackerel caught. The duty on mackerel caught by foreigners was one schilling and 6 pence per barrel.  Water bailiff oath  \\"You shall faithfully serve in the office of Water Bailiff in the Jurisdiction of New Plymouth and shall carefully observe such orders of Court as concerns your said office with special reference unto the improvement thereof at Cape Cod and places adjacent. You shall faithfully discharge the trust imposed upon you in demanding and receiving whatsoever shall be due unto the Colony by such fish as shall be there taken; and shall seasonably give in a true account thereof unto the Treasurer yearly.\\" In 1672, a new law was created which gave the water bailiff authority to seize any fish caught by a vessel in Cape Cod Bay that did not pay its duty. \\"It is enacted by the Court that if any person or person that shall at any time hereafter ship or load on board any fish, caught at Cape Cod but such as he or they shall give an account of to the water bailiff: All such fish shall be forfeited to the colony's use. The water bailiff is hereby empowered to make seizure of all such fish as shall at any time become forfeit and is to give account thereof to the Treasurer or such as shall be appointed by the magistrates or any four of them to take the said account.\\" In 1673, a law passed which said that all profits from the Cape Cod fishery would be used to fund a public school. In 1684, the taking of mackerel ashore with seines or nets was prohibited under the forfeiture of the seines nets vessels and boats employed. The forfeitures were to be divided between the informer and the colony. Magistrates were authorized to issue warrants to persons empowering them as water bailiffs to make such seizures. The Massachusetts Bay Colony (situated around present day Boston and Salem) and the Colony of New Plymouth (situated around present day Barnstable County, Plymouth county and Bristol county) unified in 1692 to form the Province of Massachusetts Bay. In 1693, deer hunting was prohibited between January 1 and July 1. The first offense forty schillings, second offense three pounds, third offense five pounds. In 1710, a law was passed that banned the hunting of waterfowl from any boat, canoe, float, raft, or vessel. The penalty for breaking the law was a fine of forty schillings and a three-year prohibition from hunting any waterfowl. In 1727, the law was revised to include the prohibition of hunting waterfowl at night. The penalty from the crime was split between the person reporting the crime and the poor. In 1717, to increase the deer population, a law was passed which prohibited any killing of bucks, does, and fawns until August 1, 1721. \\"Whereas the depth of snow in some late winters hath been so great as hath occasioned the destruction of a great part of the deer in this province; to the intent that the said creature (which is both harmless and profitable) may be preserved and increased\\".  The first game warden  Massachusetts was the first in the nation to appoint game wardens in 1739. The first game wardens were first known as \\"Informers of Deer\\" and later on as \\"Deer Reeves\\". In 1739, the fine for killing a buck, doe, or fawn was increased from forty schillings to ten pounds. Along with the increased fine, every town in the province was now required to appoint two people to enforce the revised law. The two people chosen by the towns were known as \\"Informers of Deer\\" and they were sworn town officers \\"whose care and duty it shall be to inform of all breaches of this act, and to take care that the violators thereof be duly prosecuted and punished\\". The informers were the first game wardens in the country. The penalty for towns which did not choose Informers was thirty pounds. In 1763, the act to increase the deer population in the colony was revised to include moose. The revised law prohibited any hunting of deer and moose from December 21 to August 11 of each year. The law also required each town in the colony to appoint two deer-reeves. The deer reeves duties, like the \\"Informer of Deers\\", was to enforce the deer protection act and prosecute any offenders. An excerpt from court records: \\"At a court in Northampton, March, 1763 John Worthington Esq. Attorney for our sovereign lord the king, in this behalf, here instantly complains and gives this court to understand and be informed, that Azariah Selden of Hadley, in the county of Hampshire, yeoman, on the 8th day of March current, did at said Northampton, wittingly and willingly, with force and arms, kill one wild deer, and then and there had in his possession the raw flesh and raw skin of one wild deer, killed since the 21st day of December last, contrary to a law of this province, the peace of said lord the king, his crown and dignity. He was fined 10 pounds and costs 29 shillings, Noah Smith Jr of Hadley the informer, was to have half the fine\\".  Establishment of Fisheries Board of Commissioners  In 1865, the Board of Commissioners on Fisheries was created and composed of three members. Deputy commissioners were appointed by the commissioners. The deputy commissioners were given the power to arrest without warrant persons found violating laws. Fishing on Sundays was also banned by an act which said \\"Whoever attempts to take or catch any fish on the Lord's Day ... shall be punished by a fine not exceeding ten dollars\\". In 1886, the commission's authority was extended to the protection and preservation of birds and animals and its name was changed to Board of Commissioners on Fisheries and Game. In 1899, any hunting of birds and game on Sundays was banned. In 1901, the Attorney General, Hosea M. Knowlton, rendered a decision that the deputies of the commission are no longer allowed to enforce the Sunday fishing ban. The decision made by the attorney general was made because the Sunday fishing ban was not a law relating to inland fisheries. \\"Its authority for the enforcement of law being definitely limited to fish and game laws, and the recent rulings and decisions having been established the fact that the law relating to Sunday fishing is \\"An act for the better observance of the Lord's day\\" and not a fish law, it was manifestly our duty to instruct our deputies not to enforce a law which we have no right to enforce\\". In 1901, the deputy force consisted of paid deputies, special deputies, and unpaid deputies. The paid deputies were employed by the state and served as deputies all year long. The special deputies worked varying terms of service and were employed by the state, hunting clubs, and towns. In 1902, the Office of Inspector General of Fish was abolished and its power and duties are given to the Board of Commissioners on Fisheries and Game. The deputy force of 1911 consisted of 29 paid deputies, 15 special deputies, and 186 unpaid deputies. In 1912, a new law was passed which authorized that every town and city can appoint a fish and game warden with a salary not exceeding fifty dollars. The town wardens were given the same powers as the commission's deputies and were paid by the town. In 1919, the Board of Commissioners on Fisheries and Game was abolished and the Department of Conservation (DOC) was first established. With the creation of the Department of Conservation all of the states fish and game laws were now enforced by the Division of Fisheries and Game. In 1929, the Bureau of Marine Fisheries was established within the Division of Fisheries and Game. The new legislation also required wardens and deputies to wear a metallic badge when on duty and with authorization to carry a weapon. \\"The wardens and deputies, when on duty, shall wear and display a metallic badge bearing the seal of the commonwealth and the words \\"fish and game warden\\" or \\"deputy fish and game warden\\", as the case may be. The director, with the approval of the governor, may in writing authorize any warden to have in his possession and carry a revolver, club, billy, handcuffs and twisters, or such other weapon or article required in the performance of his official duty\\". In 1933, the name of the Division of Fisheries and Game was changed to the Division of Game and Inland Fisheries. The Bureau of Marine Fisheries separated from the Division of Game and Inland Fisheries in 1939. The new Division of Marine Fisheries was created to enforce the marine fisheries laws and to appoint coastal wardens. In 1941, a Bureau of Law Enforcement was created within the Division of Game and Inland Fisheries and the Division of Marine Fisheries. \\"There shall be in the division a bureau of law enforcement, under the charge of a chief conservation officer. All conservation officers, deputy conservation officers and fish and game wardens of the division shall be assigned to duty in said bureau\\". In 1945, the authority of officers to enforce game laws on public land including the Quabbin Reservoir without a permit was questioned. The Attorney General, Clarence A. Barnes, ruled in favor of the Division of Fisheries and Game. \\"Accordingly, I advise you that the officers of the Division of Fisheries and Game, referred to in G.L (Ter. Ed.) c. 131 S 18 as amended, have the power and duty of enforcing the game laws on the public lands, including those of the Quabbin Reservoir under the control of the Metropolitan District commission, and have the right to enter upon such lands when necessary for the purpose of such enforcement\\". In 1948, the Division of Law Enforcement was established within the Department of Conservation. The new division consisted of a director who was given the authority to appoint a chief coastal warden and chief conservation officer. The conservation officers enforced inland fish and game laws and the coastal wardens enforced marine fisheries laws. In 1953, the Department of Conservation changed its name to the Department of Natural Resources. The Division of Law Enforcement was also given the authority to enforce laws relating to marine fisheries, inland fisheries, game, forests, parks, fire, and dogs. In 1964, the law enforcement responsibilities of the coastal warden service and the conservation officer were combined. The new name of the coastal warden and conservation officer was changed to natural resource officer. In 1975, the Department of Natural Resources was reorganized and became the Executive Office of Environmental Affairs. The Division of Law Enforcement became the only statewide agency with the primary responsibility to prevent violations of the state's environmental laws. In 1978, the Department of Law Enforcement signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the National Marine Fisheries Service to enforce federal laws. In 1981, the Division of Law Enforcement was transferred back to the Department of Fisheries, Wildlife, and Recreation Vehicles.  Establishment of the Massachusetts Environmental Police  In 1985, the Division of Law Enforcement and the Division of Marine and Recreational Vehicles merged. After the merger, the new agency fell under the Department of Fisheries, Wildlife, and Environmental Law Enforcement. The new department was called the Massachusetts Environmental Police and officers were called Environmental Police Officers. After the 2001 September 11 attacks, the Environmental Police department's role changed to include homeland security. In 2003, the department was transferred back to the Executive Office of Environmental Affairs. The name of the department was also changed to the Office of Law Enforcement. Today, the police continue enforcement of fish and game laws including the commercial and recreational harvest of the living marine resources along the Massachusetts coastline. The department's responsibilities include the protection of natural resources, homeland security and law enforcement, safety education, and accident investigation. The department consists of six different bureaus. Criticism of management In 2016, media reports exposed questionable payroll practices at the Environmental Police, including allowing officers to split shifts so they could work overtime details in the middle of the day, allowing officers to use paid time off (sick days and vacation time) to trigger overtime payments for regular work, and not accounting for the time it takes employees to travel between work locations. The agency was also criticized for patronage hires and for removing GPS tracking devices from vehicles at the request of the officers' union.  Bureaus  The Massachusetts Environmental Police is divided into six Bureaus.  Coastal Bureau  Massachusetts coastal communities are divided into six enforcement regions encompassing approximately 1,500 square miles. Offshore enforcement adds an additional 2,500 square miles of territorial waters to the Environmental Police's jurisdiction. Coastal officers monitor fishing and other activities both on land and at sea. Officers patrol coastal waters conducting investigations of illegal fishing practices, marine theft cases, and enforcement of boat registration and titling requirements. The coastal force mediates disputes between competing fishing interests such as draggers, gill-netters, lobster men, and recreational anglers. In addition, coastal officers closely monitor fish markets, processing facilities, shellfish digging, and Off-Highway Vehicle use on beaches.  Inland Bureau  Environmental Police Officers serving in the inland regions are responsible for enforcing a wide variety of laws and regulations including the statutes regarding hunting, fishing, trapping, boating, and off-highway vehicles. Inland officers also investigate cases of illegal waste disposal, wetlands violations, and assist in search and rescue efforts. Officers patrol in cruisers, four-wheel-drive vehicles, boats, off- road vehicles, on foot, and in aircraft when necessary. Inland officers pay particular attention to state forests, parks, wildlife management areas, boat access sites and heavily used public waterways such as major rivers and great ponds.  Boat and Off-Highway Vehicle Safety Bureau  The Boat and Recreation Safety Bureau coordinates boating and recreation vehicle safety programs throughout the Commonwealth. Our boating safety training course, called \\"Boat Massachusetts\\", addresses fundamental safety concepts and emphasizes the operator's legal and ethical responsibilities. It targets the boating novice, especially young boaters (12 through 15 years of age), who are required by state law to complete such a course in order to operate a motorboat without adult supervision. Additionally, safety and legal demonstrations are offered to groups of boaters, snowmobile riders, and off- highway vehicle users, with programs tailored to a group's particular needs. The Bureau is also responsible for the investigation of all motorboat and recreational vehicle accidents that cause substantial property damage, serious injuries, or fatalities.  Environmental Crimes Bureau  The Environmental Crimes Bureau is part of a unique interagency investigative organization called the \\"Environmental Crimes Strike Force\\". Under the direction of the Attorney General and the Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs, the Strike Force combines the prosecutory expertise of the Attorney General's Office with the scientific and investigatory skills of the Department of Environmental Protection, the Environmental Police, and the State Police. The Strike Force investigates and prosecutes environmental crimes that have serious public health consequences‚Äîcases involving illegal hazardous and solid waste disposal, water pollution, air quality violations, illegal pesticide application, and violations of wetland protection statutes.  Marine Theft Bureau  The Marine Theft Bureau was established to combat intensifying theft problems involving vessels, motors, electronic devices, and other marine accessories. Marine Theft Bureau personnel work closely with the U.S. Coast Guard, federal enforcement agencies, state and local police, harbormasters and insurance agencies to prosecute criminals and recover stolen marine equipment. In addition, the Bureau's Questioned Documents Section cooperates with the Division's Registration and Titling Bureau on investigations involving disputed motorboat titles and registrations. Through cooperation with the Massachusetts Department of Revenue, the Marine Theft Bureau recovers substantial sales and excise tax revenue to the Commonwealth each year.  Registration Bureau  The Boat, Off-Highway Vehicle, and Snowmobile Registration Bureau is responsible for registering motorboats, snowmobiles, and recreation vehicles in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

(2007) Revision of the tadpole-gobies of the genus Benthophilus (Teleostei: Gobiidae). Ichthyol. Explor. Freshwaters, 18(1): 31-96. It is a small fish, with a length up to TL. It was listed as Least Concern by the IUCN in 2008: there are no known major threats. Granular pugolovkas are very abundant in their habitat due to their size and lack of natural predators. The common name 'pugolovka' is a Ukrainian word for tadpole. Description Benthophilus granulosus has a flat head with a flat barbel on the chin that is often described as being leathery. The body colors depend on the habitat in which the fish lives. Benthophilus granulosus can be distinguished from its relatives by their body being covered in thorny granules which are closely compacted, containing three dark blotches on their midline. Benthophilus granulosus also has black dots on the head and back Granular pugolovka starts its life cycle off as a tadpole, this tadpole stage of life is identified by the body of this fish and the absence of scales. The body of the tadpole stage also is covered with variable sized bony portions protruding out of the body, which will eventually disappear in only the males who have reached sexual maturity. Habitat Benthophilus granulosus lives in both brackish and fresh waters; low-salinity zones seem to be preferred. It prefers river deltas and estuaries as well as shallow coastal waters () in the summer, and moves deeper (down to ) in the winter. Granular pugolovka is abundant along northern and eastern coasts around Ural and Volga rivers. Life cycle Benthophilus granulosus has a life span of about a year, and reaches maturity at about 6‚Äì7 months. It spawns during April through July in shallow waters. Benthophilus granulosus starts life as a \\"tadpole\\" and matures into a goby fish. The granular pugolovka life cycle is about a year, which is normally how long it takes for their spawning season to start after their birth. The granular pugolovka all die shortly after spawning with the females dying before the males due to the more costly act of laying eggs as opposed to the males role of releasing sperm. Diet Benthophilus granulosus is a bottom dweller and has a fairly limited diet or zoobenthos. They eat mysids, amphipods, bivalves, insects, and other foods.

Her career as a graphic illustrator was interrupted by 15 months spent entertaining the troops in World War I, which left her passionately anti-war. During the 1920s, she gained fame for drawing \\"the New American Woman\\" image, but this contradicted her personal experiences as wife and mother. By the 1930s, she drew images that reflected her own life and beliefs. She was inspired by Gandhi's non-violence, and in Mao's China; but met rejection and censorship during the McCarthy era. Despite this, she continued painting until her death in 1984.

She studied at the Chicago Art Institute from 1909 to 1913, learning classic drawing; but also studying mural-painting with John W. Norton. While a student, she began her commercial art career drawing illustrations of hats for Gages, the largest millinery company in the United States. She then moved to New York City, where she worked as a graphic artist and commercial illustrator, initially sharing a studio with Neysa McMein. Between 1913 and 1929, her commercial graphics included covers for Saturday Evening Post, Colliers, Every Week, Fashion Art, McCalls, and Screenland; posters for the YMCA, and numerous advertising illustrations.For full details of Willcox's biography, see: JA. Seidman, ed, One Woman: sketches/diaries/letters/notes/ fragments from Anita Parkhurst Willcox, Createspace, 2010 She signed her commercial work throughout this period with her maiden name, \\"Anita Parkhurst\\". In New York, Willcox joined the social and intellectual group that after 1919 formed the Algonquin Round Table. (Willcox was an occasional participant in this group during the 1920s). She studied art briefly with George Bellows and Robert Henri (called the \\"Ashcan School\\" of art), but left after they objected to her \\"classic\\" drawing style. She married engineer Henry Willcox in 1918. Entertaining troops, World War I In 1918, two weeks after her marriage, Willcox went to France, to work with the YMCA to support American troops. She worked in a canteen stationed with the American First Division army during the Second Battle of the Somme (1918) in March 1918, then in the Gondecourt sector.see description of war experiences in One Woman: sketches/diaries/letters/notes/ fragments from Anita Parkhurst Willcox, pp. 55‚Äì89 With artist Neysa McMein and Jane Bullard, she developed and performed a vaudeville show which toured the troops on the front lines.Entertaining the American Army the American Stage and Lyceum in the World War by Evans, James W. And, Harding, Captain Gardner L.; Illustrated by Neysa McMein, Anita Parkhurst, Ethel Rundquist, 1921; reprint as ebook 2010, pp. 96‚Äì100 Willcox and McMein also painted elephants on an observation balloon and artillery guns. She remained with the US army when it entered Germany, returning to New York in March 1919. These experiences made her a committed pacifist. \\"New American Woman\\" image After the war, Willcox resumed both her commercial art career in New York, and her married life. She became known for creating the \\"New American Woman\\" image ‚Äì idealized pictures of women who were young, beautiful, fashionable, invariably white and economically successful. A feature newspaper article by Thompson Feature Services in 1921 reads: \\"The name of Anita Parkhurst is signed with greater frequency than that of any other artist . . .her work has a certain touch.\\"Thompson Feature Services clipping, reproduced in One Woman: sketches/diaries/letters/notes/ fragments from Anita Parkhurst Willcox', p. 92. Conflicts between art career and gender roles Between 1921 and 1926 Willcox gave birth to four children; she adopted a fifth in 1930. In 1923, following the birth of her third child, Willcox spent six months in bed with puerperal fever (childbirth fever). This led her to question the contradictions between the idealized images she produced, and the actualities of women's lives.see One Woman: sketches/diaries/letters/notes/ fragments from Anita Parkhurst Willcox', pp. 104‚Äì109. In 1925, Willcox wrote a book called \\"Between Jobs and Babies\\", exploring the changing nature of women's roles in industrial society.Excerpts from the manuscript \\"Between Jobs and Babies\\" can be found in 'One Woman: sketches/diaries/letters/notes/ fragments from Anita Parkhurst Willcox', pp. 106‚Äì108; the manuscript of \\"Between Jobs and Babies can be found in Anita Willcox papers, Schlessinger Library, Radcliff Leading women academics responded positively; Edith Stern, reviewing the book for Boni and Liveright, commented: \\"This is exactly the book I have wanted to have written.\\" Edith Stern letter cited in 'One Woman: sketches/diaries/letters/notes/ fragments from Anita Parkhurst Willcox', p. 109 Despite the reviews, Willcox was unable to find a publisher. Arguing that the idealized \\"pretty girls\\" she drew for commercial illustration were \\"socially pernicious\\", Willcox quit her career as a commercial artist.One Woman: sketches/diaries/letters/notes/ fragments from Anita Parkhurst Willcox', p. 113. League for Industrial Democracy poster by Anita Willcox, 1932 Towards gendered social realism From 1928, Willcox sought to create art that captured her own experiences and perceptions. In 1930, she studied briefly with John Sloan at the Art Student's League. She traveled extensively, sketching scenes, events, and people around her. She did not attempt to position this artwork within the \\"art world\\", and made few attempts to hold gallery exhibitions. All of her work from this period on is signed \\"Anita Willcox\\", or \\"AW\\". During the Depression, Willcox designed posters and graphics for Norman Thomas' League for Industrial Democracy, and for Masses magazine. She drew caricatures for Colliers of AFL leader W. Green, and John Lewis of the CIO. Sketch by Anita Willcox of peace conference at Mahatma Gandhe's ashram, Savagram,India, 1949 Against all wars A committed pacifist, Willcox saw World War II as incomprehensible. She wrote in 1939: \\"I am paralyzed, clinging to bare reason to find a pattern, any pattern, that I can accept.\\"One woman, sketches, diaries, letters, fragments from Anita Parkhurst Willcox, p. 147. Her depression was compounded by accidental carbon monoxide poisoning in 1940. For the next few years, she struggled to make any art, painting portraits of friends, and learning silkscreening. Towards the end of World War II, she drew posters for Americans United for World Organisation,For more on Americans United for World Organisation, see Johnstone,A, Americans Disunited: Americans United for World Organization and the Triumph of Internationalism . promoting the formation of the United Nations, and calling for an end to all wars. She publicly condemned the Korean War, and nuclear weapons. In 1949 Willcox traveled through India. Her sketches record the First All India Conference held in Jaipur after the end of British rule; and a peace conference at Sevagram, Mahatma Gandhi (Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi)'s ashram, on the first anniversary of his assassination. Anita Parkhurst Willcox, Cartoon of generals and McCarthy-era politicians, 1953 Harassment from McCarthyism In 1950, Anita and Henry Willcox, with three of their five children, founded a community in Norwalk, Connecticut called Village Creek. Conceived as a haven from racism, the Cold War, and McCarthy era red-baiting, Village Creek became the first inter-racial cooperative on the Eastern seaboard of the United States. Village Creek today comprises some sixty houses; in 2010 it was declared a National Historical Monument.The declaration is found at \\"Announcements and actions on properties for the National Register of Historic Places for August 6, 2010\\". Weekly Listings. National Park Service. August 6, 2010. In 1952 Anita and Henry Willcox represented the Quakers at the Asia and Pacific Rim Peace Conference in Peking China. Willcox sketched delegates to the conference. Afterwards she traveled throughout the People's Republic of China. Meeting Anna Louise Strong led to extensive correspondence which laid the basis for Strong's newspaper column in the US, Letter from China. Following this trip, the US State Department confiscated the Willcox's passports. The subsequent court case (a class action that included singer Paul Robeson) led to the 1958 Supreme Court ruling that the State Department cannot withhold a passport because of a citizen's beliefs or associations.In the Supreme Court judgement, Judge Charles Wyzanski ruled that \\"if an American was not allowed to travel because of what he had said in the United States, not only was his freedom of speech curtailed geographically, but also his freedom of speech at home was punished and therefore threatened, a violation of the First Amendment.\\" See David Caute, The Great Fear, The Anti-Communist purge under Truman and Eisenhower,(Simon and Schuster,1978), pp. 146‚Äì148 and p. 251 for a description of the passport case and judgement. (During the 1950s, when Robeson was unable to perform in public venues, he practiced on the piano in the Willcox house in West Greenwich.) Willcox became a target for McCarthy era censorship. At aged 70, she was called to testify before Eastland Committee (both for attending the China conference, and as the person who funded the legal defence of Harvey Matusow, an FBI informer jailed for publicly admitting perjury as a state witness against \\"communist\\" trade union officials).see Lichtman, Robert and Cohen,Ronald,Deadly farce: Harvey Matusow and the informer system in the McCarthy era,University of Illinois Press, Urbana, Il., 2004, p. 153; The full transcript of Willcox's interrogation by the Eastland Committee can be found at Harvey Matusow. Publicity around this meant she was unable to find a publisher for her book about India, and a Norwalk elementary school refused to take donated murals depicting Norwalk Harbor in the 17th century (the school accepted and hung the mural panel in 1977).For newspaper clippings on the school board's decision to reject Willcox's mural, see One Woman: sketches/diaries/letters/notes/ fragments from Anita Parkhurst Willcox, pp. 208‚Äì209. Henry Willcox, her husband, a professional engineer and president of Willcox Construction Company, was expelled from the company he himself had founded.David Caute, The Great Fear, The Anti-Communist purge under Truman and Eisenhower,(Simon and Schuster,1978), p.369 Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Willcox continued to travel and paint throughout the world.

The procedure was introduced in when the EPC was revised in 2000, to form the so-called \\"EPC 2000\\".Julian Cockbain, Petitions for review of European Patent Office (EPO) Appeal Board decisions by the EPO Enlarged Board of Appeal, Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice (2009) 4 (12): 876-892. . A petition for review can essentially only be based on a fundamental procedural defect. Its purpose is not to obtain a reconsideration of the application of substantive law, such as points relating to patentability.EPO web site, Frequently asked questions about the revised European Patent Convention (EPC 2000) , item 14. Consulted on October 31, 2007. The petition is a restricted form of judicial review, limited to examining serious errors of procedure which might have been committed by the Legal or Technical Boards of Appeal, prejudicing the right to a fair hearing of one or more appellants.Basic proposal for the revision of the EPC, MR/2/00 Before the entry into force of the EPC 2000 in December 2007, it was not possible for a party who did not have his requests granted in an appeal to challenge the final decision of the Legal or Technical Board of Appeal on any grounds.  Requirements and effects  A party to appeal proceedings may file a petition for review. To do so, the party must however have been adversely affected by the Board of Appeal's decision. The prescribed contents of the petition for review is laid out in . The petition must be filed with a time limit of 2 months from the notification of the Board of Appeal's decision, except when based on the grounds that a criminal act may have affected the decision of the Board of Appeal. In the later case, the petition must be filed \\"within two months of the date on which the criminal act has been established\\", but no later than five years after notification of the Board of Appeal's decision. Furthermore, a fee must be paid. The review procedure has no suspensive effect on the Board of Appeal decision. If the petition is allowable, the Enlarged Board of Appeal sets aside the decision and re‚Äëopens proceedings before the Boards of Appeal.  Obligation to raise objections (Rule 106 objection)  Under , \\"a petition under Article 112a, paragraph 2(a) to (d), is only admissible where an objection in respect of the procedural defect was raised during the appeal proceedings and dismissed by the Board of Appeal, except where such objection could not be raised during the appeal proceedings.\\" In other words, unless the reason for an objection comes into light only in the written decision of the Board of Appeal, not raising an objection under Rule 106 EPC as early as possible during the appeal proceedings may be fatal to the admissibility of a petition for review.Regarding the obligation to raise the objection as early as possible, see R 1/14, point 3: \\"That an objection is raised in good time is an indispensable prerequisite for the admissibility of a petition under Article 112a EPC. The wording of Rule 106 EPC does not say so explicitly, but it is in keeping with its spirit and purpose, which is that a party should draw the board's attention expressly, and separately from its other submissions, to any fundamental procedural defect to enable it to investigate and, if necessary, rectify the alleged defect while the proceedings are still pending ‚Äì as envisaged in Rule 106 EPC ‚Äì and thereby obviate the need for subsequent review proceedings under Article 112a EPC.\\" An objection under Rule 106 must be immediately recognizable by the Board of Appeal and it must be specific, i.e. \\"the party must indicate unambiguously which particular defect of those listed in paragraph 2(a) to (c) of Article 112a and Rule 104 EPC it intends to rely on\\".R 4/08, point 2.1, discussed in Cockbain, 2009.  Grounds for review  There are five sets of grounds for review as laid out in . The available grounds are strictly limited to these enumerated grounds. (referring to R 1/08 and R 2/08) The ground for review that a violation of occurred (violation of the right to be heard) is one of those most expected to be relied upon and, at the same time, it leaves much room for argument. However, a procedural error marring the appeal proceedings does not, by itself, suffice to guarantee a successful petition. There must be a causal link between the alleged procedural defect and the damaging decision. Otherwise, the defect was not decisive and hence not fundamental.Julian Cockbain, Petitions for review of European Patent Office (EPO) Appeal Board decisions by the EPO Enlarged Board of Appeal: part II, Journal of Intellectual Property Law & Practice (2011) 6 (2): 85-92. . (referring to R 1/08, and R11/08)  Procedure  The actual procedure for examination of the petitions for review involves two stages. First stage: Rejection of clearly inadmissible or unallowable petitions First, a three-member Enlarged Board decides whether the petition is clearly inadmissible or unallowable. If so, the petition is thrown out immediately. This first stage is \\"a quick screening process to be conducted by a three- member panel of the Enlarged Board in order to reject petitions which clearly cannot succeed.\\"Enlarged Board of Appeal decision R5/08 of February 5, 2009, Reasons 33. It is, in other words, a sifting process. To reject a petition as clearly inadmissible or unallowable, the three-member panel has to reach the decision unanimously. The decision is taken based only on what is in the petition, and R 5/08 and the other party or parties, if any, are not involved and not invited to oral proceedings during that first stage. Most petitions are rejected during this first stage. Second stage: Five-member examination Secondly, if the petition is not rejected during the first stage, a five-member Enlarged Board examines the petition as to its merits. If the petition is allowable, the decision is set aside, the case is re-opened and sent back to the Board which took the reviewed decision, and the fee paid upon filing the petition for review is reimbursed to the successful petitioner. The Enlarged Board of Appeal has also the power to replace members of the Board of Appeal who took the reviewed decision. and R 5/08  Statistics  The first petitions for review included R1/08 (application no 97600009), R2/08 (application no 00936978), R3/08 (application no 01943244) and R4/08 (application no 98116534).EPO web site, Petitions for review under Art. 112a EPC , consulted on December 3, 2008.

Several scholars have cited the influence of Sigmund Freud's thinking on theories of unit cohesion.\\"Why soldiers fight. Part I. Leadership, cohesion and fighter spirit.\\" Robert B. Smith, 1983, Quality & Quantity, Volume 18, Number 1, 1‚Äì32, A number of them noted that Freud wrote of cohesion breakdown among soldiers, asserting that it leads to panic, insubordination, self-interested rather than cooperative reactions to threats, and \\"a gigantic and senseless dread\\".Sigmund Freud (1922). Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego. Chapter V. Two Artificial Groups: The Church and the Army The later development of the concept is strongly informed by the work of Morris Janowitz, who, with Edward Shils, began writing on the topic in the late 1940s.Giuseppe Caforio, Handbook of the Sociology of the Military, p.63, Springer, 2006. . \\"The first attempt to establish a theory of cohesion and effectiveness within combat troops belongs to Edward Shils and Morris Janowitz (Shils and Janowitz, 1948). ...\\" Janowitiz continued to work in this area in his sociological work, as the disruptive policy of frequently rotating individual soldiers and officers during the Vietnam War came under scrutiny as a large factor behind low morale.Milam, John R. (2009). Not a gentleman's war: an inside view of junior officers in the Vietnam War, p. 142, UNC Press Books, Following the studies of several World War II armies, sociologists concluded that comradely ties between small combat units is a decisive factor in providing good morale, cohesion, and organization framework. The defeat of the Western forces by the poorly equipped Chinese People's Liberation Army in the Korean War in 1950 further generated interest on the role of \\"human elements\\" on modern battlefields.George 1967, p. vii. Although Western armies traditionally created ties between soldiers through informal means such as teamwork or shared hardships instilled by discipline,George 1967, p. 27. the Chinese army relied on formal methods to assimilate recruits into their units.George 1967, p. 29. The assimilation process involved features such as coercive persuasion, surveillance, and political control,George 1967, pp. 31‚Äì35. while military ranks and physical punishments were abolished to allow closer relations between officers and soldiers.George 1967, pp. 36-38. The stringent assimilation methods allowed the Chinese to create high morale and cohesion compared to the Western forces.George 1967, p. 5. However, high casualty rates and the lack of modern equipment later resulted in a significant erosion of morale and cohesion as the Korean War dragged on.George 1967, p. 164. One of the worst cases of this erosion was the partial disintegration of the Chinese army during the spring offensive in May 1951.George 1967, p. 195‚Äì196. In the late 1980s, one researcher stated that, regardless of whether unit cohesion was an actual motivator or merely a stabilizer, what mattered was that unit cohesion \\"enhanced fighting power\\", because it reduced \\"combat inhibitors (stress, fear, isolation)\\" and promoted \\"esprit de corps, morale and teamwork\\".Roger Kaplan (1987). \\"Army Unit Cohesion in Vietnam: A Bum Rap\\" , U.S. Army War College. Other research has, however, concluded that there is value in distinguishing the components of social cohesion and \\"[t]ask cohesion ... the commitment to working together on a shared goal\\", since some studies conclude that unit effectiveness correlates strongly with task cohesion, not with social cohesion. This debate about the relative importance, or even need for, the concepts of social cohesion and task cohesion is exemplified by an exchange between Anthony King and Guy Siebold in the journal Armed Forces & Society in 2006‚Äì2007.Anthony King, \\"The Word of Command: Communication and Cohesion in the Military,\\" Armed Forces and Society 32, 4 (2006): 493‚Äì512; Guy L. Siebold, \\"The Essence of Military Group Cohesion,\\" Armed Forces and Society 33, 2 (2007), 286‚Äì295; Anthony King, \\"The Existence of Group Cohesion in the Armed Forces: A Response to Guy Siebold,\\" Armed Forces and Society 33, 4 (2007): 638‚Äì645. One U.S. military researcher has drawn a distinction between teamwork and unit cohesion‚Äîclaiming teamwork as being merely \\"collaboration\\", while unit cohesion involves a bond that can sustain mutual commitment, not just to the mission, but to each other, and to the group as a whole. This added bond, he argued, enabled teamwork under conditions under which an organization might otherwise break down.van Epps (2008-12-31), \\"Relooking Unit Cohesion: A sensemaking approach\\", Military Review New uses of unit cohesion in research The concept of cohesion was originally used primarily to examine combat behavior. However, more recently models of cohesion have been applied to other phenomena characterized by stress, uncertainty, and the strategic interaction of groups.Guy L. Siebold, \\"The Evolution of the Measurement of Cohesion,\\" Military Psychology 11, 1 (1999). For an interesting example see Osiel, Obeying Orders: Atrocity, Military Discipline, and the Law of War. Uzi Ben-Shalom et al. looked at cohesion during Israeli Defense Force operations in the Occupied Territories during the al-Aqsa Intifada, while Paul Bartone and Amy Adler examined cohesion in a multi-national peacekeeping operation.Paul Bartone and Amy Adler, \\"Cohesion over Time in a Peacekeeping Medical Task Force,\\" Military Psychology 11, 1 (1999); Uzi Ben-Shalom, Zeev Lehrer, and Eyal Ben-Ari, \\"Cohesion During Military Operations: A Field Study on Combat Units in the Al-Aqsa Intifada,\\" Armed Forces and Society 32, 1 (2005). Terence Lee used a broad concept of cohesion to explain military behavior during events in China in 1989 and Indonesia in 1998 and, in another article, the Philippines in 1986 and Indonesia in 1998.Terence Lee, \\"Military Cohesion and Regime Maintenance: Explaining the Role of the Military in 1989 China and 1998 Indonesia,\\" Armed Forces and Society 32, 1 (2005): 80‚Äì104; Terence Lee, \\"The Armed Forces and Transitions from Authoritarian Rule: Explaining the Role of the Military in 1986 Philippines and 1998 Indonesia,\\" Comparative Political Studies 42, 5 (2009): 640‚Äì69. Lucan Way and Steven Levitsky also used a broad concept of cohesion in order to explain regime maintenance in the former Soviet Union.Lucan A.Way and Steven Levitsky, \\"The Dynamics of Autocratic Coercion after the Cold War,\\" Communist and Post- Communist Studies 39 (2006): 387‚Äì410. Jesse Lehrke developed a multi-level model to facilitate the use of both social and task cohesion for examining military behavior during revolutions.Jesse Lehrke, \\"A Cohesion Model for Assessing Military Arbitration of Revolutions.\\" Armed Forces & Society 0095327X12459851, first published on 22 January 2013 as doi: 10.1177/0095327 X12459851 (Print edition forthcoming 2013, OnlineFirst at: http://afs.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/01/18/0095327X12459851). Less elaborate versions of this approach can also be seen in work by Dale Herspring and earlier work by Jesse Lehrke.Dale R.

It aired May 8, 2011 on Fox in the United States. In this episode, Rallo and his friends perform in the school talent show, but their rap about fiscal responsibility is not well received by their classmates. Meanwhile, after Cleveland gets his own Public-access television cable TV show, the reviews are less than positive so he takes some tips from the most successful daytime talk shows that appeal to women. This episode was directed by Oreste Canestrelli and written by Matt Murray, Aseem Batra and Carl Reiner. It received mixed reviews from critics from the main storyline and the cultural references. According to the Nielsen ratings, the episode was viewed by 5.31 million viewers and garnered a 2.2 rating in the 18-49 demographic during its initial airing. It featured guest appearances from will.i.am and T-Pain, as well as several recurring voice actors and actresses for the series. \\"Your Show of Shows\\" was originally intended to air as the twenty second episode of the second season of The Cleveland Show, airing a week after Night of the Hurricane, a crossover event between The Cleveland Show, American Dad! and Family Guy. However, just two days before its planned airing, it was announced by Fox that Night of the Hurricane would be pushed back until next season, due to a series of real-life tornadoes that killed nearly 300 people in the Southern United States. Plot When Rallo and his pals Bernard and Theodore try to come up with an act for the school performance show, their idea for a karate act fails, they open up to Murray who writes them a song about fiscal responsibility that bombs with the kids at school. Meanwhile, after Cleveland impresses his co-workers with his impressions, they suggest he create his own late-night talk show to replace a cable-access series that recently was canceled. Reviews for the show after the first episode are scathing, so Cleveland decides to retool the late-night comedy show as an afternoon talk show. Despite Rallo, Bernard and Theodore's song striking out with the other students, the parents love it and Cleveland books them on his show. Backstage, Murray arrives with a new song to make amends for making Rallo and his friends outcasts with their classmates that shocks the audience with its obscene lyrics but does result in getting the respect of their friends back. Cleveland is fired from the show by Mr. Waterman but Donna auditions to be his replacement by playing her recorder. Production \\"Your Show of Shows\\" was directed by series regular Oreste Canestrelli, in his third episode of the season.

In Poland J√≥zef Kura≈õ, leader of the anti- communist resistance The 'cursed soldiers' (Polish: ≈ªo≈Çnierze wyklƒôci) is a name applied to a variety of Polish resistance movements that were formed in the later stages of World War II and afterward. Created by former members of the Polish underground resistance organizations of World War II, these organizations continued the struggle against the pro-Soviet government of Poland well into the 1950s. Their history and actions have been controversial, as they have been accused of anti-Semitism and mass murder. Most of these anti-communist groups ceased operations in the late 1940s or 1950s. However, the last known 'cursed soldier', J√≥zef Franczak, was killed in an ambush as late as 1963, almost 20 years after the Soviet take-over of Poland.‚ÄûLalek‚Äù ostatni partyzant Rzeczypospolitej In the Baltic States Ants Kaljurand, Estonian resistance fighter for the Forest Brothers The Forest Brothers (also: Brothers of the Forest, Forest Brethren; Forest Brotherhood; Estonian: metsavennad, Latvian: me≈æa brƒÅƒºi, Lithuanian: mi≈°ko broliai) were Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian partisans who waged guerrilla warfare against Soviet rule during the Soviet invasion and occupation of the three Baltic states during, and after, World War II. The Soviet Army occupied the independent Baltic states in 1940‚Äì1941 and, after a period of German occupation, again in 1944‚Äì1945. As Stalinist repression intensified over the following years, 50,000 residents of these countries used the heavily forested countryside as a natural refuge and base for armed anti-Soviet resistance. Resistance units varied in size and composition, ranging from individually operating guerrillas, armed primarily for self-defense, to large and well-organized groups able to engage significant Soviet forces in battle. Ion Gavrila Ogoranu, leader of Fagaras resistance movement In Romania An armed resistance movement against the communist regime in Romania was active from the late 40s to the mid-50s, with isolated individual fighters remaining at large until the early 1960s. The groups were concentrated in the Carpathian Mountains, although a resistance movement had also developed in Northern Dobruja.

Early life Laurence William Fraser Stark was born on 16 November 1920 in Bolton, Lancashire. Second World War Stark joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1940 as an aircraftman 2nd class (service number 1058229) and was sent for flying training in Canada. Returning to England in mid-1941 he flew the Boulton Paul Defiant until posted to No. 182 Squadron RAF flying the Hawker Typhoon. On 10 January 1943 Stark was posted to No. 609 Squadron RAF. The squadron had been tasked to counter the hit and run attacks over south-east England by Luftwaffe Focke-Wulf Fw 190s. On 12 March Stark had his first victory when he downed a Fw 190 over Dunkirk.

For the World War II flier, see Laurence Stark. Lawrence W. Stark (February 21, 1926 ‚Äì October 22, 2004) was a neurologist and a recognized authority in the use of engineering analysis to characterize neurological systems. He was a longtime professor of physiological optics and engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. Stark was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York. His father Edward Stark was a chemical engineer trained at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Lawrence credited his early interest in engineering to him.UC Berkeley Department of Mechanical Engineering obituary, November 1, 2004 Career Stark graduated from Columbia University in 1945 with majors in English, biology, and zoology. He received his M.D. in 1948 from Albany Medical College. He worked at Oxford and Yale and as a doctor in the U.S. Navy during the Korean War. From 1960 to 1965, he was head of the neurology section in the Center for Communication Sciences at MIT. In 1965, he became chairman of the biomedical engineering department at the University of Illinois- Chicago. In 1968, he went to UC-Berkeley, where he remained until his retirement in 1994. An occasional conference on Vision and Movement in Man and Machine is held, and they are nicknamed Starkfest, according to conference organizer John Semmlow of Rutgers University, who was one of Stark's students at both UIC and Berkeley. Stark was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1968. Scientific contributions Dr. Stark was best known for his research on the control of eye movements. He pioneered the application of Control Theory to neurological systems with his study in the 1950s and 1960s of the pupillary light reflex. He later studied the saccade (fast discrete changes of gaze) and the accommodation of the eye's focus. He trained many Ph.D. students, primarily in the fields of bioengineering and physiological optics (better known as visual neuroscience). Personal life Stark was the brother of civil rights activist Matthew Stark. Stark was married and divorced twice. He had three daughters. He died in Berkeley in 2004 and is buried in Dutch Flat, California.

Social Issues Dozens of Nepalese men are being cheated out of their wages by employers in Kuwait, despite laws designed to protect them. Many of them can barely survive on what they are paid once they get to Kuwait. For Nepalese women, working in Kuwait can be even more hazardous than for the men. Due to past cases of abuse, the Nepalese government forbids them from working there as housemaids. While many succeed in earning the high salaries of their dreams, many more fall victim to physical and sexual abuse. Many of these women show up at the Nepalese embassy in Kuwait bearing clear signs of sexual assault, claiming that their former employers owe them payment, and describing inhumane and illegal working conditions.Nepali Domestic Workers Enslaved in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia However, despite the frequency of these claims, families are rarely investigated by the authorities.

Data collection began in response to findings by the National Statistical Coordination Board that 30% of Filipino families have an income below that needed for \\"basic requirements\\". It is intended to inform government departments and policy- makers on the socio-economic status of nearly 400,000 households. Outcomes The use of the NHTSPR has led to 4.4 million poor households being enrolled in Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program or the Philippine conditional cash transfer program, and the poor elderly receiving social pensions. It has also led to 4,000 health cards being distributed which provide state-run health insurance for poor families. Current operations The database has identified a total of 5.25 million households below the poverty threshold of their respective provinces. With such information, national government agencies, local government unit, and non-government organizations can direct resources to the ones who need them the most. With the use of the database, projects like electrification can be concentrated on areas with high incidence of poverty, uplifting the community economic sustainability and reducing poverty. The system can also correlate other poverty related problems like human trafficking in order to prevent them from even happening. Driving mechanism Since the NHTS-PR is technically an information management system, it is very reliant on technology. It uses Open Technologies as the primary software backbone and the latest multiple processor servers available at the time. A major challenge inherent to data sharing is porting since different agencies are using different proprietary software. To overcome such challenge, data porting software are developed in-house from existing Open Source systems.

Life  Litice Castle Boƒçek's parents were the later King of Bohemia George of Podƒõbrady and his wife Kunigunde of Sternberg. His exact birth date is not known. Following the family tradition, Boƒçek received, as his baptismal name, the name of many of his ancestors from the house of the Lords of Kunstadt. Although he was the firstborn, his father did not expect Boƒçek to succeed him as Count, because of a mental disability. Unlike his three younger brothers, Victor, Henry the Elder and Henry the Younger, Boƒçek was not created an Imperial Prince and he was not made Count of Kladsko. Since he also was not a Duke of M√ºnsterberg, he could claim that, by title, he was the last member of the noble family of Podƒõbrady. In 1458, after George had been elected as King of Bohemia, he transferred the Podƒõbrady possessions of N√°chod and Hummel to his sons Boƒçek and Victor, though he reserved the right to appoint the captains. A year later, the brothers confirmed N√°chod's existing privileges and granted more. In 1465, King George transferred parts of the former possessions of the monastery at Opatovice nad Labem to common ownership of Boƒçek and his brothers. However, when later in the same year, he transferred possession of M√ºnsterberg and Kladsko to the three brothers, Boƒçek was not included. After King George's unexpected death in 1471, his sons agreed on 1 February 1472 at Podƒõbrady Castle to divide the inheritance. Boƒçek received Litice Castle, which included Rychmberk Castle and the ƒåastolovice and ƒåern√≠kovice and the town of T√Ωni≈°tƒõ nad Orlic√≠ and half of each of the cities ≈Ωamberk and Choce≈à and the town of Kunvald. He also received the city of Jiƒç√≠n, the Lordship of Veli≈° u Jiƒç√≠na, the estates of the monastery Postoloprty and a number of smaller estates. His brothers received larger estates, but they committed themselves to paying Boƒçek 370 Prague groschens in compensation. Mount Zlat√©, with its mines, remained common property; its profits were to be divided among the brothers equally. Henry the Elder received the estates of N√°chod and Hummel, that had been joint property of Boƒçek and Victor until then. The inheritance division of 1472 is the last document that Boƒçek has personally and independently worked on. He is mentioned in later documents, but always in the context of someone else representing him or acting on his behalf. Since Victor spent most of his time in Hungarian captivity, Henry the Elder probably acted as Boƒçek's guardian. Around 1491, Henry the Elder acquired some of Boƒçek's larger East Bohemian possessions, belonging to the Lordship of Litice nad Orlic√≠. Henry sold these during Boƒçek's lifetime to William II of Pernstein. It is believed that Henry the Elder, when he assumed ownership of Litice, committed himself to caring for Boƒçek for the rest of his life. Boƒçek died on 28 September 1496 on Henry the Elder's castle in Kladsko. He was not married and had no children. There he was buried, in the church of the Franciscan monastery that Henry the Elder had built. In 1558, Boƒçek and eight relatives who had also been buried there, were reburied in main church in Glatz.  References  * Ond≈ôej Felcman, Radek Fukala et al.: Podƒõbradov√©.

It was formed in 1904 by the brothers William, Isaac and Thomas Massey, timber merchants and building contractors based in Pemberton, Greater Manchester, two miles west of Wigan. During the first fifteen years they built schools, mills, cinemas and houses and in 1919 started with the construction of bodies for cars, vans and charabancs. In the early 1920s they were agents for Ford cars and passenger vehicles, Tilling Stevens Petrol Electric buses and Columbia Six motor cars. A number of trams and buses were built for Wigan Corporation and their coachbuilding activities increased rapidly with many new customers being supplied by the end of the decade. Their building and construction activities continued throughout this period. By the mid thirties Masseys were supplying bodies on buses and trolleybuses mainly for municipal undertakings with occasional orders coming from independent operators. In the late thirties they built railcars for the Trujillo Railway in Peru and Railcar Cabs for The Sao Paulo Railway in Brazil. They were very active during the second world war with the building of Ministry of Supply \\"utility\\" bodies for many operators in England, Scotland and Wales plus fire brigade utility vehicles.

Shortly after the turn of the century, Albert and his brother, Arthur O. were building and very successfully racing speed boats. Their dreams and ambitions were turned to aviation by the work of the Wright Brothers. However, they felt that an airplane should have only one pair of wings like a bird. Construction was started in 1909, and in May 1910 it was successfully flown. Albert, age 21, was the pilot on the first flight. Arthur, age 23, piloted the second flight. They had to teach themselves to control their plane and did so after becoming airborne. Every airplane they built was a success. They built trainers and operated two flying schools. During the first World War, they built a number of airplanes for the U.S. Army. When his brother died in 1958, Albert retired and moved to Florida. Later he went to live in Fort Ashby, West Virginia.

Thomas Farrall, author, teacher and agriculturalist Education Thomas Farrall was born at Bassenthwaite, Cumberland in 1837. After a basic education he began life as an agricultural servant, working under his father for Sir Henry Vane, of Armathwaite Hall. He later enrolled at the Durham Training College to train as a teacher. He graduated with honours in 1858 and commenced his teaching career at the tiny village school at Isel, where he stayed for two years. Lavendale was his next appointment, where he remained for a further five years. He taught for seven years at Wetheral and three at Dovenby before accepting the head position from the newly formed Aspatria and Brayton School Board in 1874. He also taught part-time at the Aspatria Agricultural College.West Cumberland Times 22 August 1894 Agricultural matters He began writing on agricultural matters for both the Carlisle Journal and the Carlisle Examiner, and later the West Cumberland Times and a wide variety of other Cumberland publications. Although a great deal of his writings appeared anonymously under the pseudonyms, ‚ÄòRusticus‚Äô, ‚ÄòAgricola‚Äô, ‚ÄòRover‚Äô, and ‚ÄòThe Mud Student‚Äô. He won many prizes, writing essays on agricultural related subjects. From the Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland he obtained prizes for compositions, amongst which appeared. * The West Highland Breed of Cattle - Fourth series Vol. VIII 1876 * The Ayrshire Breed of Cattle - Fourth series Vol. VIII 1876 * The Galloway Breed of Cattle * The Comparative Advantages of Autumn and Spring Cultivation * The Agriculture of Arran and Bute * The Agriculture of Edinburgh and Linlithgow County - Fourth Series Vol. IX 1877 * The Dairies of Edinburgh Some of these were printed in the Society's Transactions. Shortly before the Society precluded non-Scots from their competitions, they made him an honorary award of a Gold Medal for a work entitled ‚ÄòThe Agriculture of the Island of Orkney‚Äô. He also received prizes from the Royal Agricultural Society of England. Perhaps his greatest achievement occurred when he won the ¬£20 prize for an essay documenting the agricultural improvements that occurred in the 35 years prior to the time of writing. He also received several awards from the Royal Agricultural Society of Ireland. In 1877, Farrall helped the Ayrshire Cattle Society to compile the Ayrshire Herd Book, which contained a portrait of the famous Ayrshire cow, ‚ÄòColly Hills‚Äô, considered at the time the finest specimen of its breed. He received the original painting from the Duchess of Athlone, and later donated the copyright to the Ayrshire Cattle Society. In 1878, he wrote a series of long essays on the subject of Modern Farming in West Cumberland, where after visiting neighbouring farms he wrote about their various techniques and methods.

Huber (born January 25, 1956) is an American lawyer, politician, and judge. He is currently serving as a judge of the Wisconsin Circuit Court in Marathon County (since 2004) and Chief Judge of the 9th District of Wisconsin Circuit Courts (since 2016). Previously, he represented northern Marathon County as a Democratic member of the Wisconsin State Assembly. Biography Born in Wausau, Wisconsin, Huber graduated from Watertown High School, in Watertown, Wisconsin. He received his bachelors and law degrees from theUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison in 1978 and 1981, respectively. In his early legal career, Huber worked as an assistant district attorney in Marathon County, and a law clerk for the Wisconsin Circuit Court in Outagamie County. In 1988, after incumbent assemblymember John H. Robinson resigned his seat to take office as Mayor of Wausau, Huber announced his candidacy to replace him. Huber narrowly won a three-way race in the Democratic primary, finishing 168 votes ahead of county planner Larry Saeger. He went on to another close victory in the November general election, which, after a recount, produced a final margin of 203 votes for Huber over Republican David M. Torkko. After his narrow 1988 victory, Huber was re-elected seven times, serving until 2004. He served for several sessions on the influential Joint Finance Committee and the Joint Legislative Council. During the democratic majorities in the 1991 and 1993 sessions, he was chairman of the committees of Reapportionment (1991), Tax Delinquent Contaminated Land (1991) and Elections, Constitutional Law and Corrections (1993). Huber's path to the Circuit Court judgeship started with the July 2003 announcement by incumbent judge Raymond F. Thums that he would retire by the end of the year. A special election was scheduled for April of 2004 with a primary in February. Huber topped the primary with nearly 50% of the vote, and went on to win election over lawyer and counselor Coleen Kennedy. After his election, he was appointed to begin his term early, in June 2004, since the seat was already vacant. He was re-elected in 2010 and 2016 without opposition. In 2016, the Wisconsin Supreme Court appointed him to be Chief Judge of the 9th District of Wisconsin Circuit Courts, replacing Judge Neal Nielsen of Vilas County. He was subsequently re-appointed in 2018 and 2020. Under current law, he is not eligible for another term as Chief Judge and will have to relinquish the position no later than July 31, 2022.

Photograph taken by Fritz Kapp in 1904. The hospital, originally named after the philanthropist Robert Mitford of the civil service, who served many years in Dhaka as collector and later, as judge of the Provincial Court of Appeal, was the most important medical institution, not only in Dhaka, but in the whole of Eastern Bengal and Assam in the mid-19th century. Robert Mitford died in Europe in 1836, but before his death he bequeathed the bulk of his property (about eight lakh rupees) to the Government of Bengal for public works in Dhaka. This was, however, disputed by his successors in England and finally the Chancery Court partially decreed in favor of the Bengal Government in 1850. With Mitford's benevolent gift, the construction of this hospital was started in 1854 on its present site, which was then known as Babu Bazar. Prior to this, the site was earlier occupied by a Dutch kuthi.  History  In 1887 a European ward (in patient department) was established in the hospital. The hospital, in addition to the main wards, accommodated lecture halls, dissecting rooms, an out-patients department and a European ward for in-patients. A medical school attached to the hospital was built in 1875. The present building was erected in 1889 which was mainly raised through private subscriptions. It accommodated two lecture halls, two separate dissecting rooms one for males and one for females, a laboratory, gymnasium and a hostel was added later.  Architectural value  Occupying an oblong area of about 12.8 acres of land on the river bank, the hospital complex comprises more than fourteen different blocks of no particular architectural significance but historically important and eminently of utilitarian character. Most of these blocks, built at different times in the last hundred years or more, and which originally were single-storeyed, have now been raised to four storeys. The Medical College block is a fairly handsome large building located at the south-eastern corner near the river bank with an attractive large garden in front. It was originally erected in 1889, toughly in the shape on English ‚ÄòH‚Äô with two symmetrical projections in the middle on the north and the south, one accommodating a verandah and the other, a staircase. It presents a 225‚Äô-0‚Äù long frontage to the north. Its foundation stone was laid by W.A. Larminie, M.I.C.S., commissioner of the Dhaka division, on 2 April 1887. Originally a single-storeyed building, three more storeys have now been added in the same style, together with a staircase In the middle of the projected southern side. A 15‚Äô-0‚Äù wide verandah in front of the building is carried on a series of semi-circular arches with prominent key-stones, alternated by dwarf rectangular brick pillars. A short wing on the west accommodates the principal's two chambers. Abutting these on the east is a large lecture hall measuring 50‚Äô-0‚Äù X 30‚Äô-0‚Äù with a 10‚Äô-0‚Äù wide verandah on the south and a corridor on the east. Across the corridor and further to the east is another large lecture hall and beyond that are two more halls. The most eastern wing has another large hall measuring 50‚Äô-0‚Äù x 25‚Äô-0‚Äù. Corresponding to the western bay the eastern wing also has two apartments. The Ahsanullah Ward, consisting of a group of old buildings across a lane on the west, has now been pulled down to accommodate a modern eleven-storeyed building. To its north is the Lady Duffering Ward, a 135‚Äô-0‚Äù long east-west running block facing north, the Hare Ward which is 142‚Äô-0‚Äù long and the Manmatha Nath Ward. Further to the west, away from the river bank is the lady student's hostel which is 120‚Äô-0‚Äù X 55‚Äô-0‚Äù and the larger nurses home block measuring 180‚Äô-0‚Äù X 80‚Äô-0‚Äù. The King Edward Memorial Ward which measures 328‚Äô-0‚Äù X 80‚Äô-0‚Äô is an impressive three-storeyed building with a 40‚Äô-0‚Äù broad projecting portico which is located to the north of the nurses‚Äô home. At its east and west ends the building is relieved with two semi-octagonal turrets, carrying a round kiosk on top with projected eaves. Two domes, crowning the terminal bays, further relieve the skyline. The porch leads to a foyer through a cloister. A marble plaque, on the entrance wall, depicts the portrait of King Edward VII to whom the building was dedicated. A staircase located in the right corner of the foyer leads to the upper storey. On either side of the covered corridor are a set of apartments which are used for a variety of purposes. The foyer gives access to two symmetrical wings on the east and west, each of which accommodate two large halls and a set of smaller apartments. This block was formally opened by John Lumley Dundas, Earl of Ranaldshay, G.C.I.E. and Governor of Bengal on 19 August 1920. The Administrative block in front of the Edward Memorial Ward is a plain three- storeyed building connected by a covered passage. The residential medical officer's quarters, now operating as the blood bank, is a simple two-storied building situated to the north of the main hospital. The labour ward, a single-storeyed 70‚Äô-0‚Äù long building, which was erected by Zamindar Revati Mohan Das Bahadur, is located to the north of the Ahsanullah Ward. The Prem Chand Roy Ward and the Johnson Wards are behind the main Hospital block. In front of the hospital and adjoin the city-road is the Eye Infirmary building with was erected in 1893 by raja Srinath Roy Chaudhury of Bhaggyakul in memory of his mother Subhadra Moni Chaudhruy. Other minor blocks of buildings within the premises, such as the resident medical officer's quarters, the rankin Outdoor Dispensary, the European ward, Johnson Ward and the civil surgeons‚Äô office are scattered around the compound. The nucleus of this institution of great public utility, established over a century back was the generous gift of Mitford, after whom it was originally named. It has now been renamed after Nawab Salimullah Bahadur in the 1960s and has developed and expanded with the time and with the donations of a number of public-spirited luminaries of Dhaka, after whom several isolated block of buildings have been dedicated. However, it is a great pity that the name of the original patron, Robert Mitford who bequeathed a substantial part of his life's savings for the founding of this institution has now been completely forgotten and not a single block of the existing buildings has been allowed to cherish his memory.

Geography The park and biosphere reserve complex is located in the country's centre-north, west of N'D√©l√© and close to the border with Chad. Reachable from Bangui, the capital city, it is situated to the west of Manovo- Gounda St. Floris National Park, and holds a higher density and a larger number of wild animals than Manovo-Gounda. The national park is 1,070,000 ha in size, and lies within the mid-Sudanian phytogeographic domain of the Central African Republic. The park is situated on a plateau at an elevation of to above sea level. Its waterways drain north-westwards to the Chari River. The left bank floodplain of the Bamingui River is protected for as are of floodplain on the Bangoran River. A relatively small section, approximately section on the Bangoran's right bank, is excluded from protection. The climate includes a rainy season of May‚ÄìOctober in the southern reaches while diminishing to June‚ÄìSeptember in the northern areas. It can be muggy all year. Flora and fauna Bamingui-Bangoran's major ecosystem is characterized as tropical dry or deciduous forests while the major habitats and land covers are dry forests, wooded savannas, edaphic savannas, and gallery forests. Trees include the Terminalia, Isoberlinia doka and Anogeissus. Red faced lovebird The sub-specific endemism seen in the large mammals appears to link to Chari- Logone River system Pleistocene isolation. One mammal is considered endangered, the Chadian wild dog, while the Sudan cheetah, Central African lion, and African manatee are classified as vulnerable. According to Spinage, antelope populations have declined markedly since 1960 within the park. The park reserve's amphibians include the Mascarene ridged frog, sharp-nosed ridged frog, Schilluk ridged frog, Galam white-lipped frog, cryptic sand frog, ornate frog, crowned bullfrog, flat-backed toad, shovelnose frog, Senegal kassina, and Natal puddle frog. The red faced lovebird is found here and in Nigeria's Gashaka Gumti National Park. Threats Ecological threats to the park reserve include foreign timber and mining concessions, poaching, and agriculture land-clearance.

Funded largely by the American Family Association (AFA), Lane has organized political briefings with appearances by fundamentalist pastors such as David Barton and politicians such as Mike Huckabee, Newt Gingrich, Michele Bachmann and Haley Barbour. In his behind-the-scenes work for right-wing politics, Lane has been described by The New York Times as \\"something of a stealth weapon for the right\\". Activism=Pastor meetings In the 1990s Lane organized his first pastor meetings in California, where he lives, and in Texas. In the 2000s, the effort was greatly expanded, with funding from the AFA. Each meeting, which is nearly free to participants, costs the AFA \\"many tens of thousands of dollars\\". AFA spokesman Bryan Fischer said that, as co-sponsor of the pastor meetings, the AFA maintained an expanding email list of some 40,000‚Äì60,000 pastors across the U.S. From 2005, Lane served as the executive director of The Texas Restoration Project, a program founded by Barton and the AFA to help conservative religious leaders in Texas become more politically aware and active. The Texas Restoration Project spent $1.26 million on six pastor briefing meetings in 2005 in support of Governor Rick Perry, and \\"Judeo- Christian values\\". A nonprofit group, the Niemoller Foundation, using money from wealthy Texans such as businessman James R. Leininger, and money from the AFA, paid for Lane's salary and for the pastor briefings through 2007. Liberal watchdog Texas Freedom Network (TFN) called for an investigation of the Niemoller Foundation's tax-free nonprofit status in early 2008, but in May 2009 the Internal Revenue Service sent a letter to the Niemoller Foundation ruling that they did not violate their tax-exempt status, and that ministers and pastors may advocate political action on behalf of moral values in their congregations without risk to their tax-exempt status, as long as they do not endorse a specific candidate or spend substantial funds on political issues. Dan Quinn of the TFN said, \\"this ruling is disappointing because it will embolden wealthy special interests who want to funnel money into nonprofits as a backdoor way to drag churches into partisan campaigns.\\" Lane said in response, \\"What we're doing is the mobilization of pastors and pews to restore America to her Judeo-Christian heritage. That's our goal.\\" In 2010 Lane coordinated politically oriented pastor meetings in Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee and Iowa; several of these considered \\"important battlegrounds in presidential politics.\\" Mark DeMoss, a former aide to Reverend Jerry Falwell, said that such mobilizing of pastors for political action is important work, with \\"people out there like David Lane, whose names we may not know, who are contributing to a large fabric of involvement.\\" In March 2011, Lane said of a two-day, 400-person meeting of Iowa pastors and spouses, \\"What we're doing with the pastor meetings is spiritual, but the end result is political. ... From my perspective, our country is going to hell because pastors won't lead from the pulpits.\\" Huckabee addressed the pastors in praise of Lane, saying he was \\"bringing pastors together so they go back to their pulpits and light them on fire with enthusiasm, to make America once again the greatest country on earth under God.\\" Opposition to same-sex marriage In the late 1990s, Lane worked against same-sex marriage in California, helping place California Proposition 22 on the ballot in 2000. In this effort, Lane worked with the California Restoration Project, founded by Edward Atsinger of Salem Communications, one of the largest Christian broadcast companies. The proposition passed, restricting California marriages to being only between one man and one woman. It was soon challenged, and overturned in 2008 by the California Supreme Court. Lane worked with Houston- based Lutheran pastor Laurence White to pass opposite-sex-only marriage amendments to the state constitutions of Ohio (in 2004), Texas (in 2005), and Florida (in 2006). The Texas campaign for Proposition 2 passed overwhelmingly. The Florida measure is known as Amendment 2, and Ohio's is referred to as State Issue 1. =Iowa Supreme Court justices= In November 2010, voters in Iowa removed three Iowa Supreme Court justices: David Baker, Michael Streit, and Chief Justice Marsha Ternus. The justices lost their seats primarily because of what they believed was their constitutional stance in a 2009 decision allowing same-sex couples to marry. The New York Times reported that Lane was the \\"unheralded mastermind\\" of the campaign against the justices, directing hundreds of thousands of dollars from Gingrich and from the AFA. A pastor from Iowa said, \\"God used David Lane and his sphere of influence to bring together all the elements\\" of a broad strategy to unseat the justices.

It is also one of the few developed countries that block pornography and material considered harmful to minors as they are illegal by law. However, this law is very loosely applied, with many pornography websites and nudity content still freely accessible. It also does not apply to social media websites, which is a common source of legal pornography in South Korea. In the first period, from 1995 to 2002, the government passed the Telecommunications Business Act (TBA), which was the first internet censorship law in the world. The act created a body called the Internet Communications Ethics Committee (ICEC), who monitored the Internet and made recommendations for content to be removed. The ICEC pursued criminal prosecutions of those who made unlawful statements and blocked several foreign websites. In the first eight months of 1996, the ICEC took down roughly 220,000 messages on Internet sites. In the second period, from 2002 to 2008, the government passed a revision of the TBA legislation. This allowed the ICEC to engage in more sophisticated internet policing and other bureaucratic entities to monitor the Internet for illegal speech or take down websites that violated the laws. During this time, there was a political drive to increase extensive internet censorship, in part because of many cases of suicide due to online rumors. In 2007, over 200,000 incidents of cyberbullying were reported. The third period started in 2008, when the presidential election of President Lee Myung-bak inaugurated major reforms of broadcast censorship. In 2008, the South Korean government passed a law that created a new agency called the Korea Communications Standards Commission (KCSC) to replace the ICEC, being the new South Korean Internet regulation and censorship body. The first major change by the Lee Myung-bak government was to require websites with over 100,000 daily visitors to make their users register their real name and social security numbers. A second change made by the government was to allow KCSC to suspend or delete any web posting or articles for 30 days as soon as a complaint is filed. The reason for the new law was to combat cyberbullying in South Korea. Every week, portions of the South Korean web are taken down by the KCSC. In 2013, around 23,000 South Korean webpages were deleted and another 63,000 blocked by the KCSC. South Korea's government maintains a broad-ranging approach toward the regulation of specific online content and imposes a substantial level of censorship on election-related discourse and on many websites that the government deems subversive or socially harmful. Such policies are particularly pronounced with regard to anonymity on the Internet. The OpenNet Initiative classifies Internet censorship in South Korea as pervasive in the conflict/security area, as selective in the social area, and found no evidence of filtering in the political and Internet tools areas. In 2011 South Korea was included on Reporters Without Borders list of countries Under Surveillance. This designation persisted in 2012, where the report suggests South Korea's censorship is similar to those of Russia and Egypt. In 2019, The South Korean government announced that it would use SNI snooping to censor HTTPS websites. This was met with strong opposition, but the opposition was outright disregarded by the Government. The Korean Government defended themselves by stating that the Korea Communications Standards Commission was an independent commission unrelated to them whatsoever, a claim which turned out to be false, as most members of the Commission were appointed by the president, in this case President Moon Jae-in. Relevant laws During the military dictatorships of Park Chung-hee and Chun Doo-hwan (1961-1987), anti- government speech was frequently suppressed with reference to the National Security Act (NSA, 1948) and the Basic Press Law (1980). Although the Basic Press Law was abolished in 1987, the NSA remains in effect. The government has used other \\"dictatorship-era\\" laws in order to prosecute critics in contemporary contexts; for example a law against the spreading of \\"false rumors\\" was used to charge a teenage protester during the 2008 US beef protest in South Korea. According to the Telecommunication Business Law, three government agencies in South Korea have responsibility for Internet surveillance and censorship: the Broadcasting Regulation Committee, the Korea Media Rating Board, and the Korea Internet Safety Commission (KISCOM, 2005). KISCOM censors the Internet through orders to internet service providers to block access to \\"subversive communication\\", \\"materials harmful to minors\\", \\"cyber defamation\\", \\"sexual violence\\", \\"cyber stalking\\", and \\"pornography and nudity\\". Regulators have blocked or removed 15,000 Internet posts in 2008, and over 53,000 in 2011. In April 2020, the national assembly passed a bill to handle the culprits of digital sex crimes. According to the bill, those who purchase, sell or watch media graphics of non-consensual sexual activity will be jailed for up to 3 years or fined up to 3 million Won (US$2,600). Political censorship Freedom to criticize government leaders, policies, and the military is limited to the extent that it \\"endangers national security\\" or is considered by censors to be \\"cyber defamation\\". The government has cited \\"character assassinations and suicides caused by excessive insults, [and] the spreading of false rumors and defamation\\" to justify its censorship. In May 2002, KISCOM shut down the anti-conscription website non-serviam on the grounds that it \\"denied the legitimacy\\" of the South Korean military. The Navy of South Korea accused an activist of criminal libel when he criticized plans to build a controversial naval base in the country. The government has deleted the Twitter account of a user who cursed the president, and a judge who wrote critically about the President's Internet censorship policies was fired. In 2010, the Prime Minister's Office authorized surveillance on a civilian who satirized President Lee Myung-bak. In 2007, numerous bloggers were censored and their posts deleted by police for expressing criticism of, or even support for, presidential candidates. This even led to some bloggers being arrested by the police. Subsequently, in 2008, just before a new presidential election, new legislation that required all major Internet portal sites to require identity verification of their users was put into effect. This applies to all users who add any publicly viewable content. For example, to post a comment on a news article, a user registration and citizen identity number verification is required. For foreigners who do not have such numbers, a copy of passport must be faxed and verified. Although this law was initially met with public outcry, as of 2008, most of the major portals, including Daum, Naver, Nate, and Yahoo Korea, enforce such verification before the user can post any material that is publicly viewable. YouTube refused to conform to the law, instead opting to disable the commenting feature on its Korean site. Discussion about North Korea South Korea has banned at least 65 sites considered sympathetic to North Korea through the use of IP blocking. Most North Korean websites are hosted overseas in the United States, Japan and China. Critics say that the only practical way of blocking a webpage is by denying its IP address, and since many of the North Korean sites are hosted on large servers together with hundreds of other sites, the number of real blocked pages increases significantly. Estimates are that over 3,000 additional webpages are rendered inaccessible. In September 2004, North Korea launched the website of , Our Nation School. Three days later, Internet providers in South Korea were ordered by the National Police Agency, National Intelligence Service (NIS) and the Ministry of Information and Communication (MIC) to block connections to the site, as well as more than 30 others, including Minjok Tongshin, Choson Sinbo, Chosun Music, North Korea Info Bank, DPRK Stamp and Uriminzokkiri. In September 2007, Democratic Labor Party activist Kim Kang-pil was sentenced to one year in prison for discussing North Korea on the party's website. In 2008, 5 South Koreans were arrested for distributing pro-North material online. In August 2010, the South Korean government blocked a Twitter account operated by the North. In January 2011, a South Korean man was arrested for praising North Korea through social networking sites. That same year another South Korean was arrested for posting 300 messages and 6 videos of pro-North content and sentenced to 10 months in jail. A further 83 South Koreans were arrested for distributing pro-North material on the Internet. In January 2012, a South Korean freedom-of-speech activist was arrested for reblogging a post from a North Korean Twitter account. South Korean president Lee Myung-bak's 2011 policies included cracking down on pro-North Korean comments on social network sites like Facebook and Twitter. Reporters Without Borders noted that the government \\"[had] intensified\\" its campaign to censor pro-North Korea material in 2012 as well. In 2018, a South Korean man was arrested for demanding abolishment of the National Security Law and praising North Korea. He was sentenced to one year in prison. Nudity and obscenity The Government of South Korea practiced censorship of gay-content websites from 2001 to 2003, through its Information and Communications Ethics Committee (Ï†ïÎ≥¥ÌÜµÏã†Ïú§Î¶¨ÏúÑÏõêÌöå), an official organ of the Ministry of Information and Communication, under its category of \\"obscenity and perversion\\"; for example, it shut down the website ex-zone, a website about gay and lesbian issues, in 2001. That practice has since been reversed. Since 2008, attempts by anybody to access \\"indecent Internet sites\\" featuring unrated games, pornography, gambling, etc., are automatically redirected to a warning page which states \\"This site is legally blocked by the government regulations.\\" Search engines are required to verify age for some keywords deemed inappropriate for minors. For such keywords, age verification using a national identity number is required. For foreigners, a copy of their passport must be faxed for age verification. As of 2008, practically all large search engine companies in South Korea, including foreign-owned companies (e.g. Yahoo! Korea), have complied with this legislation. In April 2009 when the Communication Commission ordered user verification be put on the system at YouTube, Google Korea blocked video uploading from users whose country setting is Korean. In September 2012, Google re-enabled YouTube uploads in Korea following a three-year block. On December 21, 2010, the Korea Communications Commission announced that it planned to create guidelines about monitoring Internet content in case of a tense political situation, such as automatically deleting any online anti-government message. Criticism The 2009 modification of the copyright law of South Korea introducing the three strikes policy has generated criticism, including regarding Internet freedoms and censorship. Tens of thousands of Korean Internet users have been disconnected from the Internet after not three, but one strike. On September 6, 2011, the Electronic Frontier Foundation criticized the Korea Communications Standards Commission for proposing censorship and restriction on the blog of an Internet free speech activist, Dr. Gyeong-sin Park. The United Nations Human Rights Council's Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression warned South Korea's government about its censorship, noting among other things that South Korea's defamation laws are often used to punish statements \\"that are true and are in the public interest\\". Korean officials' rhetoric about censored material, including that it is \\"subversive\\", \\"illegal\\", \\"harmful\\" or related to \\"pornography and nudity\\", has been noted as similar to that of their Chinese counterparts. Critics also say that the government takes prohibitions on profanity as \\"a convenient excuse to silence critics\\" and chill speech. South Korean conservative media outlets loyal to the Lee Myung-bak government are alleged of advocating further Internet censorship, because the Internet is the main source of information for progressive South Korean youths.
