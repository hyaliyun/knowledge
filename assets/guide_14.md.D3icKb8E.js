Career = Journalism = Prior to publication of his first book, Weaver was a videogames journalist. He was editor of cult gaming title, N64 Magazine and spent six years as Editor of Xbox World, leaving the magazine in 2011. More recently, he appeared as co-host of YouTube show GTA V O'Clock. In his wider career as a journalist, he has written about the long struggle he and his wife had to start a family. = Novels = Weaver's debut crime thriller Chasing the Dead – which took ten years to get published – was released in February 2010 and introduced the character of David Raker. Raker is a former journalist, who gave up his career in newspapers to care for his wife after she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. The book begins twelve months after her death, and centres on the mysterious reappearance of a man thought to have died in a car crash. The Guardian called it \\"an impressive debut\\", though questioned the characterisation of Raker. On a BBC Radio Somerset interview, when asked about Raker's background, Weaver described how he drew on his own traumatic battle to have a child. His fourth book, Never Coming Back, is the first in the series to move entirely away from London, and is set in Devon and Las Vegas. On 28 August 2013 it was announced that Never Coming Back had been selected for the Richard and Judy Autumn 2013 Book Club. On 18 November 2013, it was shortlisted for Crime & Thriller of the Year in the Specsavers National Book Awards, and on 16 December 2013 iTunes included it in their 'Best of 2013' list, naming it Best British Crime Thriller. On his decision to have David Raker specialise in missing persons cases, Weaver has said: \\"I just became very interested in the idea of a person going missing in an age where we have CCTV on every street, 24-hour rolling news channels, and constant access to cameras through our phones. It seemed like an intriguing starting point for a book. It sounds trite, but I was also struck by the human cost. Can you imagine how many stories must go untold when a person vanishes?\\" In October 2013, Weaver contributed a short story entitled Disconnection to #YouDunnit, a joint venture between Penguin and Specsavers. The major themes of the story – including the victim, crime scene location, and central character – were crowdsourced on Twitter. = Missing podcast = In September 2015, Weaver wrote and presented an eight-part podcast series called Missing, looking into how and why people disappear. It was selected by iTunes as one of the best podcasts of 2015. In August 2016, Weaver recorded three further episodes.  Personal life  Weaver attended Norton Hill School in Midsomer Norton, Somerset. He also describes himself as a \\"massive, massive football fan\\", and supports Arsenal and Bath City F.C.

Nicolas Dipre (sometimes also Nicolas d'Amiens, Nicolas d'Ypres, fl. c. 1495-1532) was a French early Renaissance painter. Among the Avignon artists of the late 15th and early 16th century, the name Nicola Dipre is among the most famous. Life and works Nicolas Dipre was born in Paris and probably came from a family of artists. The first written record of his existence dates from 1495 when he lived in Avignon, having lived and worked there his whole life, often working for the city government. In May 1508, he married Honorée Bigle, the daughter of joiner Jean Bigle, with whom he executed orders for the church and painted many pictures, the vast majority of which did not survive. Apart from commissions to design numerous altarpieces, Dipre also was hired to execute other forms of decorations, like processional banners and heraldry. An altarpiece executed for the Carpentras Cathedral, for which Dipre was paid 115 florins, has survived in fragments and with it as a basis, other works have been identified as having the same originator. Two of his most famous works are Jacob's Ladder, which symbolizes the epitome of the covenant of Abraham, the restoration of peace and communion between heaven and earth, and Gideon's Fleece, which illustrates the Old Testament story of Gideon, who called on the people of Israel to be their judge. He doubted his own abilities, by the Lord fulfilled his request.

Information Bulletin 99-1, September 1999. p. 103  Background  Schmidt was born in the Rhine Province of the Kingdom of Prussia in November 1860, son of Nicholas and Margaret Schmidt, and attended public school, but not high school. While training as a locksmith and machinist he attended night school to make up for his lack of a high school education. He traveled extensively in Europe while working in his trade before emigrating to the United States in 1880 alone, leaving behind his parents and four sisters (the youngest of whom later came to the United States and lived in Minnesota). His first home in the U.S. was in West Point, Nebraska, where he worked for six months. Homesick, he started to return to his homeland; but upon reaching Chicago, friends there persuaded him to remain there, working at his trade and again attending night school (to master the English language), until 1887, when a work accident left him with a damaged shoulder blade which made it impossible for him to continue work as a machinist, and he was forced to seek other work. He spent six years \\"in the flour, feed, coal and wood business\\" in Chicago, and later sold real estate there. While in Chicago Schmidt married at Chicago Mary Friedl, who died there, after having borne four children: Frederick M., Charles N., Thomas E., and Arthur, who was to die at Marathon City at the age of eleven. On May 2, 1899, Schmidt remarried to one Berta Gunjen, like himself a native of Germany.  Move to Wisconsin  In 1902 he bought the Marathon City Brewery; he moved to Marathon City and took control of the brewery in September of that year. In 1905 it became a public company, but he remained as president, treasurer and manager until December 31, 1910, when he gave up the management of the business for health reasons. During this time he helped organizing the State Bank of Marathon City, of which he was the first president, remaining so until December, 1911. He was one of the main organizers of the Marathon City Telephone Company and was like its first president, and also help organize the Marathon Excelsior Manufacturing Company and the Marathon Lumber Company. By 1913, his role in each of these companies was primarily as a stockholder.Marchetti, Louis.

Stubblefield (born 1940), is a retired NOAA Commissioned Corps rear admiral. He served as the director of the NOAA Commissioned Corps from 1995 to 1999. Early life and naval career A native of Medina, Tennessee, Stubblefield received his bachelor's degree from the Memphis State University. In 1962, he was commissioned an Ensign in the United States Navy after he completed Naval Officer Candidate School. A surface warfare officer, he served on a minesweeper (USS Frigate Bird MSC 191) and icebreaker (USS Burton Island AGB 1) at sea, and ashore at submarine tracking facilities (SOSUS) in Bermuda and in Grand Turk. Stubblefield left the Navy in 1968 to enroll at the University of Iowa, where he received an M.S. in geology in 1971. NOAA career In 1971, Stubblefield joined the NOAA Commissioned corps as a Lieutenant upon the completion of NOAA Corps Basic Officer Training. His first assignments were at sea on NOAAS Pathfinder and Rainier. He next served ashore as the Deputy Director of the Marine Geology and Geophysics Division at the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML), Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research in Miami. For his work while serving in Miami, Stubblefield was awarded the NOAA Corps Achievement Medal. Stubblefield subsequently returned to sea as the operations officer on board NOAAS Researcher. From 1978 to 1979, he attended Texas A&M; University, earning a Ph.D. in geological oceanography. His field of research was coastal processes along the Atlantic coast. His research resulted in over 30 peer reviewed professional papers in the field of marine geology. On several occasions, Stubblefield dove in the Deep Submersible ALVIN to advance his studies. After a stint back at AOML, Stubblefield returned to Researcher as Executive Officer. Following his assignments at sea Stubblefield served in a number of administrative and scientific positions with NOAA. He returned to sea in 1988 as the commanding officer of NOAAS Surveyor. Under his command Surveyor conducted research from the arctic to the Antarctic. At the time Surveyor gained the distinction of having traveled the farthest north and farthest south of any NOAA vessel to date. The Surveyor was in the vicinity of Point Barrow, Alaska when the three whales were caught in the ice. In 1990, Stubblefield was named as coordinator for the Fleet Modernization Study, a project to assess the life of the existing fleet and to predict the way forward for future NOAA ships. For his work on this study he was awarded the Department of Commerce Silver Medal, the second highest award for NOAA Corps Officers. Later in 1990, Stubblefield became the Executive Director, Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research. In 1992, he was promoted to Rear Admiral Lower Half and made the Deputy Director, Office of NOAA Corps Operations. On 22 May 1995, Stubblefield assumed the position of director of the Office of NOAA Corps Operations, the top commissioned officer in the NOAA Commissioned Corps and as Rear Admiral Upper Half. He served in this position until 2 March 1999.http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories/s134.htm Later life After leaving the NOAA Commissioned Corps, Stubblefield and his wife Dr. Bonnie McGregor Stubblefield, retired to Berkeley County, West Virginia in 1999. He was active in local politics serving on the Berkeley County Public Service Water District and subsequently as the president of the Berkeley County Council. He left office in 2012 with no intention of running for another elected office in the future, but does plan on remaining active in the community. Dr. Stubblefield currently serves on the Board of Directors for Blue Ridge Community and Technical College, Berkeley County Fire Board, Hospice of the Panhandle of West Virginia, Strategic Planning for Berkeley Health, Elder and President of Trustees for First Presbyterian Church in Berkeley County.

Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 116. Buildings The Hunter Farm comprises eleven historic buildings, centered on the high-style farmhouse. Built in 1850, the farmhouse is a two-story structure built of brick; architectural elements such as its pilasters and recessed entryway are constructed with evidence of influence from both the Greek Revival and Italianate styles. Three barns, three sheds, two other farm-related buildings, an additional storage building, and a garage form the rest of the farm complex; these ten outbuildings and a privy are placed in two clusters. Preservation In 1985, the Norvall Hunter Farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its distinctive historic architecture and because of its place as the home of a leading local citizen. It is one of twenty Mechanicsburg locations on the Register; all were listed at the same time as part of a multiple property submission because the village's high proportion of non-historic buildings frustrated locals' initial hopes of designating a larger historic district.Recchie, Nancy.

A temperamental filly who was sometimes difficult to train, she is best known for winning the International Stakes in 1998. After winning on her only appearance as a two-year-old she won both her races in 1997 including the Sun Chariot Stakes. She was beaten on her debut as a four- year-old but then won the Golden Daffodil Stakes before defeating male opposition in the International Stakes. She was beaten in her two remaining races and was retired to stud where she had modest success as a broodmare. Background One So Wonderful was a bay filly with a small white star bred by Egon Weinfeld's Meon Valley Stud in Hampshire. She was one of the best horses sired by Nashwan, the 1989 Epsom Derby winner. Her dam Something Special won once from five races and finished third in the Coronation Stakes. Her other foals included the Dante Stakes winner Alnasr Alwasheek and the Rockfel Stakes winner Relatively Special. Something Special was a daughter of the 1000 Guineas winner One in a Million and a close relative of the classic winners Full Dress and Commanche Run. Like the other horses raced by the Meon Valley Stud, One So Wonderful competed in the black and white colours of Helena Springfield Ltd a company owned by Egon Weinfeld. She was trained by Luca Cumani at his Bedford Lodge stables in Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career =1996: two-year-old season= One So Wonderful never contested a maiden race, beginning her racing career in the Milcar's Fillies' Conditions Stakes over seven furlongs at Kempton Park Racecourse in September. Starting at odds of 5/1 she took the lead approaching the final furlong and won \\"comfortably\\" by three and a half lengths from ten opponents. Following the race she was made favourite for the following season's 1000 Guineas. =1997: three-year-old season= One So Wonderful missed the early part of her three- year-old season and did not appear until 30 August, almost a year after her previous run. She had not been injured, but had been very slow to reach peak condition and was sent back to her owners for a break in May and June. Despite her absence she was made one of four 11/2 co-favourites for the Atalanta Stakes (now a Group Three race) over one mile at Sandown Park Racecourse. Ridden by the veteran Pat Eddery she took the lead a furlong from the finish and accelerated clear of her thirteen opponents to win easily by eight lengths. For her only other race of the year the filly was moved up in class and distance for the Sun Chariot Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket racecourse on 4 October, when she started second favourite behind the Oaks winner Reams of Verse. Ridden by John Reid she led for most of the way and got the better of what was described as a \\"thrilling battle\\" with Kool Kat Katie in the final furlong to win by a neck, with Reams of Verse three and a half lengths away in third. The runner-up went on to win the Grade I E. P. Taylor Stakes in Canada two weeks later. =1998: four-year-old season= On her first run as a four-year-old, One So Wonderful was matched against male opposition for the first time in the Brigadier Gerard Stakes at Sandown in May. She started 11/4 favourite but did not recover after being hampered two furlongs from the finish and finished seventh of the nine runners behind the five-year-old Insatiable. She had compromised her chance by becoming highly agitated before the race; according to Luca Cumani \\"she got her knickers in a twist\\". In attempt to calm the filly's nerves she regularly accompanied her stable companions to the racecourse in the following weeks even when he was not scheduled to compete. After a two-month break from racing, the filly was returned to all-female competition for the Listed Golden Daffodil Stakes over ten furlong at Chepstow Racecourse. She was made the 11/8 favourite and won by three and a half lengths from the Middleton Stakes winner Arriving. Cumani described the race as \\"a nice confidence booster\\". In August One So Wonderful was stepped up to Group One class for the first time when she was one of three fillies in a field of eight runners for the International Stakes over ten and a half furlong at York Racecourse. Ridden by Eddery, she was the 6/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Faithful Son (winner of the Prince of Wales's Stakes), Chester House and Limpid (Grand Prix de Paris). She was among the leaders in the start and despite coming under pressure in the straight but made steady progress along the inside rail and took the lead on the line to win in a three-way photo-finish from Faithful Sun and Chester House. After the race Cumani admitted that he thought the filly had finished second, but paid tribute to his winner, saying that \\"she has always been highly promising. You don't compile a record of wins like hers without being very good\\". Eddery said: \\"She's very honest and very game. They had her and she came back at them, just like she did in the Sun Chariot last year. She gave me everything and quickened all the way to the line.\\" The riders of the first three finishers all received riding bans from the racecourse stewards for excessive use of their whips. Frankie Dettori, the rider of Faithful Sun described the stewards' decision as \\"predictable and pitiful\\". The race was not considered a particularly strong edition of the International, with one journalist describing it as \\"a Group 2 race for a Group 1 prize\\". One So Wonderful ran in two more races, but failed to win. In September she finished fourth behind Swain, Alborada and Xaar in the Irish Champion Stakes, beaten a total of two lengths. A month later she ended her racing career by finishing fifth behind Alborada in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket. Cumani felt that she was unlucky in the race saying that the pace had been too slow and that \\"by the time she moved up, she got blocked and the race was over.\\" Assessment One So Wonderful was the highest-rated older female racehorse in Europe in 1998. Luca Cumani called her \\"a beautiful filly who's given enormous pleasure\\". Stud record At the end of her racing career, One So Wonderful returned to her birthplace to become a broodmare at the Meon Valley Stud, where she produced eight foals between 2001 and 2011. She died in February 2012. The best of her foals was Sun Boat, a gelding sired by Machiavellian who won the Grade II San Diego Handicap at Del Mar Racetrack in 2007.

The service suspended its operations on August 8, 2013 after the U.S. Federal Government ordered it to turn over its Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) private keys, in order to allow the government to spy on Edward Snowden's email.Edward Snowden’s E-Mail Provider Defied FBI Demands to Turn Over Crypto Keys, Documents Show. Wired Lavabit's owner and operator, Ladar Levison, announced on January 20, 2017 that Lavabit would start operating again, using the new Dark Internet Mail Environment (DIME), which is an end-to-end email encryption platform designed to be more surveillance-resistant. However, as of June 2017, while the DIME transition was being completed, service was only being offered to past customers and those who took advantage of the early signup offer. As of October 2017, the ability for new customers to purchase service was again being offered. History Lavabit was founded by Texas-based programmers who formed Nerdshack LLC, renamed Lavabit LLC the next year, who cited privacy concerns about Gmail, Google's free, widely used email service, and their use of the content of users' email to generate advertisements and marketing data.Lavabit High Scalability Writeup Lavabit offered significant privacy protection for their users' email, including asymmetric encryption. The strength of the cryptographic methods used was of a level that is presumed impossible for even intelligence agencies to crack. In August 2013, Lavabit had about 410,000 users and offered free and paid accounts with levels of storage ranging from 128 megabytes to 8 gigabytes.Lavabit chief predicts 'long fight' with feds CNET, August 9, 2013. Retrieved August 13, 2013. In January 2011, Lavabit had launched a shared web hosting service. Before the Snowden incident, Lavabit had complied with previous search warrants. For example, in June 2013 a search warrant was executed against a Lavabit account for suspected possession of child pornography. Connection to Edward Snowden Court documents (PDF) Lavabit received media attention in July 2013 when it was revealed that Edward Snowden was using the Lavabit email address Ed_Snowden@lavabit.com to invite human rights lawyers and activists to a press conference during his confinement at Sheremetyevo International Airport in Moscow. The day after Snowden revealed his identity, the federal government served a court order, dated June 10, 2013, and issued under 18 USC 2703(d), a 1994 amendment of the Stored Communications Act, asking for metadata on a customer who was unnamed. Kevin Poulsen of Wired wrote that \\"the timing and circumstances suggest\\" that Snowden was this customer.Poulsen, Kevin. \\"Feds Targeted Snowden’s Email Provider the Day After NSA Whistleblower Went Public.\\" Wired. September 27, 2013. Retrieved on October 2, 2013. In July 2013 the federal government obtained a search warrant demanding that Lavabit give away the private SSL keys to its service affecting all Lavabit users.Poulsen, Kevin. \\"Edward Snowden’s E-Mail Provider Defied FBI Demands to Turn Over Crypto Keys, Documents Show.\\" Wired. October 2, 2013. Retrieved on October 2, 2013. A 2016 redaction error confirmed that Edward Snowden was the target.  Suspension and gag order  On August 8, 2013, Lavabit suspended its operations, and the email service log-in page was replaced by a message from the owner and operator Ladar Levison. The New Yorker suggested that the suspension might be related to the US National Security Agency (NSA)'s \\"domestic-surveillance practices\\". Wired speculated that Levison was fighting a warrant or national security letter seeking customer information under extraordinary circumstances, as Lavabit had complied with at least one routine search warrant in the past. Levison stated in an interview that he has responded to \\"at least two dozen subpoenas\\" over the lifetime of the service. He hinted that the objectionable request was for \\"information about all the users\\" of Lavabit. Levison explained he was under gag order and that he was legally unable to explain to the public why he ended the service. Instead, he asked for donations to \\"fight for the Constitution\\" in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Levison also stated he has even been barred from sharing some information with his lawyer. Meanwhile, the Electronic Frontier Foundation called on the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to provide greater transparency to the public, in part to help observers \\"understand what led to a ten-year-old business closing its doors and a new start-up abandoning a business opportunity\\". Levison said that he could be arrested for closing the site instead of releasing the information, and it was reported that the federal prosecutor's office had sent Levison's lawyer an email to that effect. Lavabit is believed to be the first technology firm that has chosen to suspend or shut down its operation rather than comply with an order from the United States government to reveal information or grant access to information. Silent Circle, an encrypted email, mobile video and voice service provider, followed the example of Lavabit by discontinuing its encrypted email services. Citing the impossibility of being able to maintain the confidentiality of its customers' emails should it be served with government orders, Silent Circle permanently erased the encryption keys that allowed access to emails stored or transmitted by its service. Levison in September 2013 at the Liberty Political Action Conference In September 2013 Levison appealed the order that resulted in the closing of his website.Poulsen, Kevin. \\"Lavabit’s Owner Appeals Secret Surveillance Order That Led Him to Shutter Site.\\" Wired. September 11, 2013. Retrieved on October 2, 2013. Levison and his lawyer made two requests to Judge Claude M. Hilton to unseal the records, both of which were denied. They also launched an appeals case regarding legality of the original warrant. The appeals court then requested the records to be unsealed, and Judge Hilton granted the request. On October 2, 2013, the Federal District Court in Alexandria, Virginia unsealed records in this case, but only censored the name and detail of the target of the search order. Wired suggested the target was likely Snowden. The court records show that the FBI sought Lavabit's Transport Layer Security (TLS/SSL) private key. Levison objected, saying that the key would allow the government to access communications by all 400,000 customers of Lavabit. He also offered to add code to his servers that would provide the information required just for the target of the order. The court rejected this offer because it would require the government to trust Levison and stated that just because the government could access all customers' communication did not mean they would be legally permitted to do so. Lavabit was ordered to provide the SSL key in machine readable format by noon, August 5 or face a fine of $5000 per day. Levison closed down Lavabit 3 days later. On October 14, 2013, Levison announced he would allow Lavabit users to change their passwords until October 18, 2013, after which they could download an archive of their emails and personal data. The court documents stated that on July 13 Levison sent an open letter to the assistant US attorney, offering to give email metadata (without email content, usernames or passwords) to the FBI if it paid him $2,000 \\"to cover the cost of the development time and equipment necessary to implement my solution\\" and $1,500 to give data \\"intermittently during the collection period\\". Afterwards, Levison wrote that after being contacted by the FBI, he was subpoenaed to appear in federal court, and was forced to appear without legal representation because it was served on such short notice; in addition, as a third party, he had no right to representation, and was not allowed to ask anyone who was not an attorney to help find him one. He also wrote that in addition to being denied a hearing about the warrant to obtain Lavabit's user information, he was held in contempt of court. The appellate court denied his appeal due to no objection, however, he wrote that because there had been no hearing, no objection could have been raised. His contempt of court charge was also upheld on the ground that it was not disputed; similarly, he was unable to dispute the charge because there had been no hearing to do it in. He also wrote that \\"the government argued that, since the 'inspection' of the data was to be carried out by a machine, it was exempt from the normal search-and- seizure protections of the Fourth Amendment.\\"  Legacy  One year after the suspension of Lavabit, its founder Ladar Levison announced a specification for the Dark Internet Mail Environment (DIME) at DEF CON 22. It is under development by the Dark Mail Alliance. In April 2014, after a contempt of court conviction for providing the key as a printout was upheld by an appeals court, he described the initiative to Ars Technica as \\"a technological solution which would take the decision away from the will of man.\\" In November 2015, Levison said that work on DIME was still progressing, although slower than he would like. As of July 2016, posts to the Dark Mail Alliance forum suggest that all collaborators have left the project and Ladar has been working on DIME alone.  Relaunch  On January 20, 2017, Lavabit owner Ladar Levison relaunched the service. Per the wording of the announcement, this date was apparently timed to coincide with the inauguration of Donald Trump (though he was not mentioned by name). The service has been revamped to use the Dark Internet Mail Environment protocols and software that Ladar had been working on for the past few years. This DIME platform, and the associated Magma open source email server, are designed to use end-to-end email encryption in such a way that when operating with the highest security settings, subpoenas cannot force service providers to give governments access to customer email (or be forced to shut down in order to avoid this). When using the maximum security settings, even an attacker breaking into DIME servers would have no feasible way to access customer emails, leaving client-side attacks as likely the only potential points of vulnerability.

Largely based on demographic data from England and Wales, McKeown argued that the population growth since the late eighteenth century was due to improving economic conditions, i.e. better nutrition, rather than to better hygiene, public health measures and improved medicine . This became known as the \\"McKeown thesis\\". Personal life McKeown was born in Portadown, Northern Ireland and then moved to Vancouver, Canada with his parents. His parents were William McKeown and Mathilda (Duff) McKeown. McKeown graduated in physiology at the University of British Columbia (1932) and obtained his first doctorate at McGill University (1935) before returning across the Atlantic to study as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University where he gained his DPhil in 1938. During wartime, he studied medicine at London University where he obtained a Bachelor in Surgery in 1942. In the early 1940s, the Nuffield Provincial Hospital Trust offered to finance a chair of social medicine at the newly founded University of Birmingham McKeown was appointed in 1945 as professor, not yet 33 years old, and held the chair until his retirement in 1977. In Birmingham, he also did his MD graduation in 1947. He is also known for his work in geriatrics and maternal-fetal medicine. He was a consultant for the World Health Organization, Josiah Macy Foundation, Commonwealth Fund, and Rockefeller Foundation. He died in 1988, and was survived by his wife Esmé and their son and daughter. Scientific contribution Thomas McKeown. The Origins of Human Disease. Original book cover, Basil Blackwell/Oxford, 1988. McKeown developed his theories over a period of more than three decades between 1955 and shortly before he died in 1988. The seeds of his work can be found in four seminal papers published in the academic journal Population Studies, a book on Medicine in Modern Society in 1965, and a textbook (with C.R. Lowe) An Introduction to Social Medicine from 1966. These earlier publications did not attract much attention beyond the academic community until he merged these publications in two controversial books: The Modern Rise of Population and, endowed by a Rock Carling Fellowship of the Nuffield Trust, a lecture with the provocative title The Role of Modern Medicine: Dream, Mirage or Nemesis? In his last book, The Origins of Human Disease, published shortly after he died in 1988, he had found a milder tone to express his critical relativism of medicine and health. Here he had found the right balance between responding to legitimate criticism of the limitations of his thesis, without showing much mercy for unjust critics. McKeown challenged four theories about the increase of the western population since the 18th century: # McKeown stated that the growth in population, particularly surging in the 19th century, was not so much caused by an increase in fertility, but largely by a decline of mortality particularly of childhood mortality followed by infant mortality, # The decline of mortality could largely be attributed to rising standards of living, whereby he put most emphasis on improved nutritional status, # His most controversial idea, at least his most disputed idea, was that he questioned the effectiveness of public health measures, including sanitary reforms, vaccination and quarantine, # The sometimes very fierce disputes that his publication provoked around the \\"McKeown thesis\\", have overshadowed his more important and largely unchallenged argument that curative medical measures played little role in mortality decline, not only prior to the mid-20th century but also until well into the 20th century. Influence and Criticism The publication of The Modern Rise of Population (1976) provoked instant disagreement by demographers, but also yielded much acclaim from health critics. In the 1970s, an era wherein all aspects of social, economic and cultural establishment were challenged, McKeown found a receptive audience with other health critics such as Ivan Illich. By some researchers, including the economist and Nobel prize winner Angus Deaton, McKeown is considered as the founder of social medicine. It is remarkable that McKeown's work, even many years after publication and his death in 1988, still gives rise to severe criticisms. Sometimes his conclusions are being criticised by mild truisms: ‘His great virtue was to ask the right questions. He did not always provide the best answers.’ But others vehemently dismissed all his work as ‘having been largely discredited by subsequent research’. This criticism lead to equally fierce rebuttals defending McKeown's thesis. It is true that McKeown has repeatedly urged to rethink our public health system, medical care and social policy, and he righteously concluded that this will have political and financial consequences. However, both proponents and opponents from all political angles have either embraced or condemned his arguments for their own good. Or as one commentary poignantly phrased it: ‘Nevertheless they (and they are by no means alone) seem to feel a continuing need for a McKeown peg on which to hang their hat, while others want a McKeown target at which to aim their darts.’ This commentary suggested that the whole debate raised by McKeown is outdated: ‘Perhaps it is time to conclude that this cycle of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis has been played out, to give the ‘McKeown debate’ a dignified burial and to move on to other things.’ Despite this appeal to stop the McKeown debate, his work can still inspire admirers and infuriate opponents, even from within his own university. What makes it even more complicated to value McKeown's work and its consequences is that he himself shaped and reshaped his ideas in a career that spans more than five decades, from his first publication in 1934 to his last book on The Origins of Human Disease in 1988. In this last book, McKeown resumes the themes that he had explored in his earlier publications, but also responded to previous critics and incorporated their arguments when they were right. In 1988, many of his earlier provocations were now commonly shared ideas. Particularly the work of Noble laureates Robert W. Fogel (1993) and Angus Deaton (2015) have greatly contributed to the recent reappreciation of the McKeown thesis: McKeown's views, updated to modern circumstances, are still important today in debates between those who think that health is primarily determined by medical discoveries and medical treatment and those who look to the background social conditions of life. (Angus Deaton, page 91)  Theses  = Population Growth = Population size, fertility rate and mortality rate in the Netherlands from 1807 to 2015. Pre-industrial mortality and fertility showed major swings, largely dependent on period of prosperity, poverty, starvation and cholera epidemics until ~1870. Next, the mortality rate decreased more than the fertility rate, leading to a surge in population growth. The mortality peaks in the last year of the First and Second World Wars, are followed by birth peaks in the following year. (Merged data from Horlings, 1993 and Drukker & van Tassenaar, 1997 for data of the 19th century, and CBS-278x278px Nowadays, very few will disagree with McKeown that the late 19th century surge of the population in the western world can be mainly ascribed to a fall in mortality and not to a rise in fertility. This was not that evident when he first published The Modern Rise in Population in 1976. Benson (1976) in a critical review of his book wrote that McKeown had insufficiently shown that it was mortality that fell and not fertility that rose to cause the population growth. The present wealth of demographic data, both historical data from western countries dating back as early as the late 18th century, and more recent data from more recently developing countries consistently show similar patterns of a growing population with declining fertility, and declining mortality (see for example Figure 'Fertility, Mortality and Population Growth in the Netherlands). In 1981, Wrigley and Schofield published an authoritative study on The Population History of England 1541–1871. Among many valuable findings on historical demography, and for the pre-industrial time largely based on studies of parish registers, they may in hindsight have overinterpreted the frequent birth peaks as evidence that an increase of the birth-rate was the predominant influence before the mid-nineteenth century. Already in 1974, Flinn described that such birth peaks were usually preceded by a period of mortality crises; however, as Flinn extensively describes, in times of turmoil deaths may not always have been accurately registered. Furthermore, as McKeown explained, it is very hard to biologically understand how a higher standard of living in early industrialisation could have selectively favoured fertility without decreasing mortality. Although he may have been unduly critical by stating that I should therefore explain that I do not think there is any treatment of the deficient material from the registers that would make it reliable [McKeown, 1988, page 9], his criticism was well taken. Ten years later, Schofield and Reher (1991) were already far more appreciative of McKeown's work, not only that his controversial ideas had enormously boosted research of historical demography, but also that he proofed to be right on many points. The authors also appreciated the pre-industrial demographic patterns characterised by mortality peaks followed by fertility boosts. They however explained the initial phase of the population growth during the transition from late agricultural to early-industrial civilisation not so much by a decrease in mortality, as McKeown's had postulated, but by a stabilisation of mortality as Flinn (1974) called it. This early demographic transition characterised by The Attenuation of Mortality Crises started in Britain in the late 18th century and on the European continent about a half century later. Still in 2002, some critics of McKeown described this demographic controversy as one of his many flaws, not understanding that 'stabilisation of mortality' followed by 'decrease in both mortality and fertility' are perfectly complementary theories, as argued by Flinn (1971) and McKeown (1988) (and as illustrated by the Figure describing the population growth, fertility and mortality rates in the Netherlands from the pre- industrial early 19th century until the present day). = Wealth, Food and Health = 297x297px Wealth and health: nowadays it is hard to imagine that only forty years ago there were scientists who doubted seriously that an increased standard of living was the main drive behind the growth of population, better health and a longer life expectancy. This doubt was probably cast by an idealisation of the living conditions of pre-historical hunters and gatherers, or by a nostalgic call for a return to the flower power of ancient agricultural life. McKeown was not blind to the social misery which was introduced by industrialisation, which led to overcrowded cities, poor housing, worsening of personal hygiene, foul drinking water, child labour and dangerous working conditions. He was puzzled why the population of England and Wales did increase despite these Dickensonian misery and poverty during early industrialisation. An international comparison of present-day economies shows that average income and health are closely related, not only in poor countries, but also among rich countries, where life expectancy seems to have reached its biological ceiling (see Angus Deaton, 2013 for a detailed discussion). In 1798, Thomas Malthus published An Essay on the Principles of Population wherein he argued that population growth was necessarily limited by the means of substinence; because he assumed that the land could never produce nor provide sufficient food for everyone, population growth will inevitably lead to famine, starvation and death. This became known as the Malthusian trap. That Western population grew despite the vices of industrialisation was one of the main arguments why McKeown put so much emphasis on one of the few virtues of early industrialisation: the country was able to produce and provide more and better food for the people. Flinn (1971) already found for the pre-industrial 18th century that mortality crises were less than in the 17th century, and explained that by reduced fluctuations in food prices and fewer and less severe periods of famine by increased food imports during periods of failed crops, and by an agricultural transition from monoculture (grain) to more diverse products (rice, maize and buckwheat in the south, and potatoes in the north). Industrialization further improved the efficiency of food culturing, processing and transport. Back in 1976, McKeown was criticised for failing to convince ‘that an improvement in per capita nutrition actually did occur’. McKeown was thereby criticised for using sloppy methodology; McKeown himself was well aware that his theory was hampered by insufficiency of then available data, particularly data from the early industrialisation during the 18th century, and he confided that he had deduced some of his conclusions ‘on the principle enunciated by Sherlock Holmes: When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. [McKeown, 1988; pages 9–10] 294x294px Since McKeown first proposed his thesis, several historians of economics have gathered supportive evidence for the McKeown thesis. Particularly the valuable work on the technophysio evolution by Nobel prize laureate economist Robert Fogel and collaborators has contributed to the acceptance of McKeown's thesis. As summarised by Angus Deaton (2013, pp 91–92): Nutrition was clearly part of the story of early mortality decline. ... With the beginnings of the agricultural revolution, the [Malthusian] trap began to fall apart. Per capita incomes began to grow and, perhaps for the first time in history, there was the possibility of steadily improving nutrition. Better nutrition enabled people to grow bigger and stronger, which further enabled productivity to increase. ... Taller, bigger people lived longer, and better nourished children were less likely to die and better able to ward of disease. Knibbe (2007) combined physiological indicators of health with economical data and discovered a direct relation between food intake, food price and health in the Netherlands of the 19th century; he for instance described a consistent relation between caloric intake and body length of Dutch conscripts between 1807 and the late 19th century (see Figure). Up to about 1898, changes in the biological standard of living were closely related to changes in the availability of food. After ~1898, the curves start to diverge: although the average caloric intake did not further increase, both body-length and life expectancy did increase until 1940. This also corroborates McKeown’s assertion that public health measures started to boost the well-being of the population during the 20th century. However, the strong correlation between calorie intake and longevity is not a proof that nutrition was the only reason for the decline of mortality, although it is an indispensable condition. As Angus Deaton concluded (page 92): \\"There is no doubt that nutrition has improved and that people have become bigger, stronger, and healthier. But focusing entirely on food cannot provide a complete account for the decline in child mortality. Such an approach underplays the importance of the direct control of disease, and it focuses too much on the unaided role of the market economy and too little on the collective and political efforts that were behind the control of disease.\\" = Hygiene and Public Health = By stressing the role of more and better nutrition as the leading cause of the decline of mortality, McKeown was accused of being too simplistic and negligent about the role of other factors that at the same time or later have improved the health and well-being of the population. Particularly his two books published in 1976 provoked a plethora of reactions, but also boosted research in demography, epidemiology and public health. This accumulated in the international conference on Medicine and the Decline of Mortality in Paris on the 22 to 25 June 1988; the collection of conference papers in The Decline of Mortality in Europe from 1991 remains a classic reader for historical demographers and historians of medicine. Although critical about the McKeown thesis, the tone of the contributions was already far milder than some fifteen years before. Most contributors by now acknowledged the importance of an improved standard of living in the decline of mortality, both in 19th century Europe as in present-day developing countries. It was no longer disputed that food was indispensable for a decrease in mortality, but that other environmental improvements which came with more wealth, i.e. hygienic measures, had to work at the same time. Many studies gave convincing arguments that Public Health measures such as better housing, clean water supply, sewage and sanitation, vaccination and health education improving personal hygiene may, in western Europe, have become increasingly important since the end of the 19th century. McKeown himself, in The Origins of Human Disease, fully acknowledged this 20th century role of Public Health. Nevertheless, there remained critics who felt that McKeown was falling short, particularly for his negligence of the role of Public Health. A semantic problem, as pointed out by Simon Szreter (2002), is that Public Health is a poorly defined field of medicine in the twilight zone between the responsibility of the state or government and health care provided by physicians and nurses. The drilling of clean water wells, the construction of sewage systems, and legislation resulting in better housing, better education and improved working conditions is in most countries the responsibilities of the state, and it is surely not a good idea to make a public health professional responsible for the drilling, masonry and the enforcement of housing regulation. McKeown was not a politician, and it is quite absurd to hold him responsible for the virtual dismantlement (of public health) during the last 2 decades of the 20th century. McKeown was actively involved in the organisation of medical care in Britain, and he was a frequent advisor for the WHO, and yes, together with Archie Cochrane, he was fairly critical about a wild growth of unevaluated public health interventions and expensive medical care facilities of which the efficacy had not been demonstrated. But nowhere in his papers, reports nor his books did he advocate the dismantlement of the (British national) health system, nor did he promote free market economy (which very few economists still consider a benefit to economy). = Tuberculosis and the minor role of Personal Medical Care = McKeown questioned the contribution of medical measures, that is prevention or treatment of disease in the individual (ISM page 9) and demonstrated his thesis for the decline of many, if not all, infectious diseases since the 19th century. As early as 1955, the American immunologists had already shown that the mortality of various infectious diseases had already so much declined since ~1900, that the mortality reduction from vaccines was marginal, and that from antibiotics could not be demonstrated. McKeown gave similar results for England and Wales, showing that the mortality from infectious diseases was already so very low by the time that these treatments were introduced in medical practice, that they have contributed little to the reduction of overall mortality and the population growth. 288x288px An example that he repeatedly used was the falling mortality from tuberculosis in England and Wales since the 19th century, well before the introduction of the first effective antibiotic drug in 1947 and BCG vaccination in 1954. (ISM page 9; TMRoP, page 93; TROM, page 81; TOoHD page 79). The Figure shows comparable data for the fall in tuberculosis mortality in the USA between 1861 and 2014. In 1861, the mortality rate from tuberculosis was 365 per 100,000 and might have been much higher in the century before, and was lower than 0,2 per 100,000 in 2014. By the time of the introduction of streptomycin, the first effective antibiotic drug, in 1947 and BCG-vaccination in 1954, the mortality rate from tuberculosis had already dropped to 33,1 per 100,000, a 91% decrease. However, he found that specific age groups did show an accelerated decrease in mortality after introduction of streptomycin.(TRoM, page 82-83) Streptomycin prevented 51% of deaths from tuberculosis between 1948 and 1971, but overall, antibiotics and vaccination have only contributed 3.2% to the mortality reduction from tuberculosis since the 19th century. A Dutch study found a similar small effect of penicillin on overall mortality since its introduction shortly after World War II, but showed an accelerated decrease in mortality rate for some specific bacterial infections. Remarkably, the authors of this Dutch study considered their results as evidence that McKeown's theory was wrong, and the study is therefore frequently cited to refute instead of confirm McKeown's thesis.

All members of the patent family had been granted in other countries, and the Japan Patent Office (JPO) did not find any prior art which could destroy the novelty and inventive step of claimed inventions. However, the JPO rejected the patent application as being lack of industrial safety requirements. This is the first Japanese Supreme Court case concerning patentable subject matter. Background In 1940, the Commissariat à l'énergie atomique of France filed a patent application in Japan for an \\"Atomic Energy Generation Device\\". The application claimed a priority under the Paris Convention from a French patent application filed on 1 May 1939. The case was represented by Nobuchika Sugimura of Sugimura International Patent and Trademark Attorneys from the filing stage throughout the Supreme Court. The application was invalidated during World War II, but was subsequently restored pursuant to the Order Concerning Post-War Measures for the Industrial property rights of Allied Nationals 1 Article 7, Paragraph 1, Item 2. The JPO rejected the application on the ground that the invention was incomplete. The applicant then filed an interlocutory appeal in the JPO. However, the appeal was dismissed on the basis that the invention failed to meet threshold requirements in that it “could not be used in accordance with industrial safety requirements”. Consequently, the applicant filed a lawsuit against the Commissioner of the JPO in the Tokyo High Court seeking to have the appeal decision set aside.Tokyo High Court, 26 September 1963, Gyoushu Vol. 14 No. 9: 1532 The suit was consequently dismissed on the grounds that: where practical measures to prevent risks and ensure safety have not been clarified, an invention does not fulfill the threshold requirement that the industrial sector should be able to use the invention with the assurance of safety; it is not sufficient for an industrial invention to be complete in technical terms. The applicant lodged a jokoku appeal. Incidentally, the inventor of this patent application was Irène Joliot-Curie who was the eldest daughter of Madame Curie, and Irene, a party not involved in this suit, was the recipient, along with two other individuals, of a 1935 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The invention, which incorporated the fundamental principles of the atomic reactor, was famous worldwide as the first patented “Atomic Reactor.” The right to apply for a patent for this invention had been transferred to the nation of France. Summary of decision The appeal was dismissed by the following reasons. (i) “From the description in the specifications, the invention aims to create an energy generation device that uses energy produced through the fission of natural uranium (chain nuclear fission), which when effectively bombarded with neutrons for industrial purposes, does not cause an explosion. It follows from the nature of the device that, unlike a simple tool used in a scientific experiment, the device must obviously be technically and functionally complete at least to the point where the energy can be extracted predictably and safely. It is therefore necessary that, in addition to the practical means for causing chain nuclear fission through neutron bombardment and keeping the same appropriately under control, the technical detail of the device should contain plans for practical methods sufficient to suppress the significant risks that are inevitably inherent when conducting chain nuclear fission. (ii) It is asserted that the predictable and safe operation of an invention is not a threshold condition for the technical completion of an invention. It is also asserted that it is sufficient, for the technical effect of the invention to be industrial in nature, for the invention to come within the term “industrial invention” in Article 1 of the old Patent Law (Law No. 96 of 1921). Such argument, however, ignores the fact that the aim of the invention is to safely control the chain nuclear fission that it causes. Since it is difficult to utilize the invention in a predictable and safe manner, and is thus technically incomplete, it has not reached the point where it is industrially and technically effective as an energy generation device. (iii) In terms of the patent application process, the entire technical details of this kind of invention should be…disclosed within the description contained in the specification. That statement is then subjected to examination. Whether the invention is complete or not is to be determined by referring to the statements in the description that are contained in the specification. It therefore follows that, if the technical details of the invention are not sufficiently specific and objective in these statements, and a person having ordinary skill in the art to which the invention pertains could not easily reproduce the same, the substance of the invention is technically incomplete and it does not constitute an “invention”. (iv) The risks inherent in the utilization of this invention are unique in kind, cannot be prevented by the normal methods used in ordinary power devices, and moreover, are inevitable if the effect and function of the device are to be achieved. It therefore follows that the practical means to prevent the said risks should be part of the technical substance of the invention.\\" References Further reading   External links *Bibliographic data of the decision Category:Japanese patent case law Category:Supreme Court of Japan Category:1969 in case law ","title":"Atomic Energy Generation Device Case"},{"id":"40191204","text":"Paltalu (, also Romanized as Pāltalū; also known as Bāletlū) is a village in Qareh Poshtelu-e Bala Rural District, Qareh Poshtelu District, Zanjan County, Zanjan Province, Iran.

The siege was one of the key events in the First English Civil War by Waller to secure southern England and declare it for Parliament. The siege lasted five days and ended with surrender by the Royalists. Despite the Royalist surrender, Waller's troops proceeded to sack and desecrate Chichester Cathedral. Background On 16 August 1642 shortly before the beginning of the civil war, William Cawley, a Member of Parliament for Chichester and Midhurst issued the 'Valiant Resolution,' which declared that the city would support the Parliament, rather than King Charles. This resolution, however, was not an official declaration and several Royalists in Chichester and Sussex took actions to gain control of the city for the King. First, the Mayor of Chichester, Robert Exton responded by issuing a Royal Commission of Array, which called upon all able-bodied men to take up arms for the king. Soon thereafter, Exton's successor, William Bartholomew, obtained ordnance from Portsmouth and soldiers from the Sussex militia. The Governor of Portsmouth, Sir William Lewis sent seven guns and ten barrels of powder to the Royalists in November. Finally William Morley and Edward Ford, the High Sheriff of Sussex, raised a small army and drove Cawley and his Parliamentarian supporters from the city on 15 November. The siege Waller's force arrived at Chichester on 21 December where he was joined by a contingent of Parliamentary cavalry commanded by Sir Michael Livesey. The Royalists sent a small force out to confront the Parliamentarians but were repulsed and returned back into the city. After the area was secure, Waller began to move his siege artillery into position while simultaneously calling upon the Royalist garrison to surrender. The next morning after his terms of surrender had been rejected, Waller began to bombard the city. Over the next few days, Waller continued the bombardment, moving his artillery closer to the city as he took greater control of the area outside the city walls. Just as Waller was preparing to attack the walls from three different directions, the Royalists asked to reconsider the terms of surrender. An agreement was reached and the Royalist garrison surrendered on 27 December. Because Morley surrendered the city it was not sacked as had been done elsewhere; nevertheless, Waller allowed his men to sack and desecrate the city's cathedral.

Gilbert and Susan Gubar, The Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the Nineteenth-Century Literary Imagination (Yale University Press, 2nd ed. 2000, originally published 1979), p. 23. The concept of the \\"eternal feminine\\" () was particularly important to Goethe, who introduces it at the end of Faust, Part 2.Oppel, Nietzsche On Gender, p. 16. For Goethe, \\"woman\\" symbolized pure contemplation, in contrast to masculine action, parallel to the eastern Daoist descriptions of Yin and Yang.Gilbert and Gubar, The Madwoman in the Attic, p. 21. The feminine principle is further articulated by Nietzsche within a continuity of life and death, based in large part on his readings of ancient Greek literature, since in Greek culture both childbirth and the care of the dead were managed by women.Oppel, Nietzsche On Gender, p. 4. Domesticity, and the power to redeem and serve as moral guardian, were also components of the \\"eternal feminine\\".Oppel, Nietzsche On Gender, p. 4. The virtues of women were inherently private, while those of men were public.Oppel, Nietzsche On Gender, p. 7. In popular culture In Wide is the Gate, the fourth novel of the \\"Lanny Budd\\" series by Upton Sinclair, Lanny says to Gertrud Schultz, \\"What Goethe calls das ewig weibliche is seldom out of my consciousness; I don’t think it is ever entirely out of any man’s consciousness.\\"  See also  * Cult of Domesticity * Erich Neumann (psychologist) * Gender role * Ideal womanhood * Yamato nadeshiko * New Woman * Separate Spheres *The Angel in the House * Thealogy  References  Category:Archetypes Category:Feminist philosophy Category:Philosophical anthropology Category:Women ","title":"Eternal feminine"},{"id":"40191251","text":"Qashqa Tappeh (, also Romanized as Qāshqā Tappeh; also known as Qashqeh Tappeh) is a village in Qareh Poshtelu-e Bala Rural District, Qareh Poshtelu District, Zanjan County, Zanjan Province, Iran.

She was appointed class leader, a layperson who performed pastoral duties, by Joseph Pilmore in Philadelphia in about 1770. Biography Mary Evans was born around 1740-1741 in Bristol, Bucks County, Pennsylvania to Thomas and Diana Evans. Her parents, who were of Welsh heritage, moved to New Bern, North Carolina, where Thomas died. Her mother remarried James Mills in 1767. Evans joined the Baptists in North Carolina when she was 23 and married James Thorne, but he died in 1762. After his death, she relocated with her mother to Philadelphia. New to the city, she sought a place of worship found a Methodist service conducted by Joseph Pilmoor, which was more to her liking than the Baptist faith. Around the age of 30, she joined the Methodist church, against the wishes of her mother. The mother and her husband returned to North Carolina cutting off all contact with Thorne. Within 2 years of her conversion, according to a letter from Thorne, she had three classes and two Methodist bands meeting weekly under her tutelage. She was the first woman class-leader of Philadelphia, having been appointed to lead a class of women by Pilmore and she may have been the first woman in the American Colonies to hold the position. Another letter, dated 7 February 1770 from Richard Boardman, confirmed that she had two classes in her charge. Class leaders in this era were spiritual laity, who were accountable for the pastoral needs of their class members. Thorne supported herself by teaching and taking in sewing and visited hospitals tending to and praying for the sick and dying. Her devotion continued even after the British took over the Methodist Chapel, as she then held services in her home at the early part of the Revolutionary War. Around this same time, she met Captain Samuel Parker, a ship captain from England, who was entrusted with taking some of the injured soldiers back to Britain. They were married on 12 February 1778 at St. Paul's Church and she returned with him to England, leaving from the Delaware Bay on 17 March 1778 and arriving in Cork on 15 April 1778. Her husband served as a steward in London and she served as a class leader and later when they were living in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, they held the same positions. After they moved to Newby, near Scarborough, her husband's ship was lost and the couple became impoverished. According to letters from Thomas Rankin, their distress occurred by 1798. Parker died in England after 1813 and later, she and Parker's son moved to Philadelphia.

It is located beside Jameh mosque and is the burial place of a famous Sufi of Isfahan, Shah Alaeddin Mohammad. According to the date of Shah Alaeddin's death, which was in the December 1446, the mausoleum was built between 1446 and 1448. Inside and outside of the mausoleum is decorated by calligraphy, plasterwork and tiling. Its dome, which had been destroying in the recent years, has been rebuilt,' but the mausoleum is still in dire need of more repair work. History Shahshahan Mausoleum is one of the historical buildings in Isfahan. It is located in the northern part of the city, beside Jameh Mosque on Ibn-e Sina Street. The area around it is called Shahshahan Place. It is the burial place of Shah Alaeddin Mohammad also referred to as Seyyed Alaeddin Mohammad. He is descended from the third Imam of the Shi'ites the grandson of Mohammad, Imam Hossein. His ancestors are traced back twenty four generations to Mohammad. According to historian Jean Chardin, in the old days, this section of Isfahan was known as the area of Houseinieh, because it was believed that the great grandsons of Hossein, Ali’s son and Mohammad’s grandson lived there.Nikzad Hosseini, The History of Isfahan Monuments, 3rd ed., 1959 (1338), pp. 181-185. The mausoleum is an important shrine that belongs to the Timurid period (1370-1507). It was built between 1446 and 1448 by the order of Sultan Muhammad bin Baysonqor, the grandson of Shahrukh Mirza and one of Timur's grandsons. Shahshahan Mausoleum main door Shah Alaeddin Mohammad was an Imam (leader). He was highly respected by Sultan Mohammad as he was the most outstanding scholar of his time. In addition to being the leader, Shah Alaeddin was the authority and the head of the religious hierarchy. Thus he was next in line to the king. It was for having these two high positions that he was known as Shahshahan (king of kings). He was given the responsibility of checking the validity of Ulama (religious elite) who claimed to be Seyyed (descendants of Mohammad). In those years, territorial rivalry was common among different rulers. This fueled by the potential hatred and animosity between Shia and Sunni caused tremendous tension between Sultan Muhammad who was supported by his Shia leaders and Shahrukh. As a result, when Shahrukh Mirza was in Harat and Sultan Muhammad was appointed by him as the ruler of Isfahan, Sultan Muhammad started to disobey Shahrukh and rebelled against him. Shahrukh came back from Harat to Isfahan to capture him. But Sultan Muhammad managed to escape from Isfahan to Shiraz and later to Lorestan. Faced with this grim situation, Shahrukh angrily ordered the arrest and execution of sevenThe seven associates of Sultan Muhammad included Khajeh Afzaleddin Torkeh, Amir Ahmad Coopan and Ghazi Imam. of Sultan Muhammas's close associates, including Shah Alaeddin Mohammad, who had supported Sultan Muhammad's revolt. Shahrukh exiled Shah Alaeddin to Saveh. Instigated by his Sunni wife, Goharshad Begum,Goharshad Begum, the Sunni wife of Shahrukh Mirza, is the founder of the Goharshad Mosque in Mashhad. Shahrukh ordered the hanging of Shah Alaeddin in Saveh on December 11, 1446 (13 Ramazan 850). According to most Persian historical texts,They include: Malcolm, Sir John, History of Persia. Chardin, Jean, The Travels of Sir John Chardin, (1643-1713) to Persia, the section on Esfahan, Trans. by Hossein Oreizi, Esfahan, Rah-e Nejat Publisher, 1951 (1330), pp. 105-110.

Subsequent to Shahrukh's death, Sultan Muhammad bin Baysonqor came back to Isfahan and ordered to bury Shah Alaeddin's body in the Khanqah he had preached in. He ordered also to build the Shahshahan mausoleum on his grave. Shah Alaeddin's descendants have been also buried in the mausoleum, but their graves have been defaced over the years.'Hosseyn Yaghoubi (2004). Arash Beheshti, ed.

Description Shahshahan Mausoleum entrance plasterwork Shahshahan Mausoleum calligraphy on plaster According to the date of Shah Alaeddin's death, which was in the December 1446, the mausoleum was built between 1446 and 1448. Inside and outside of the mausoleum is decorated by plasterwork and tiling. The grave of Shah Alaeddin is in the middle with no tomb stone. All around the dome there are writings, including fourteen poems in Arabic that describe the event of the killing of Shah Alaeddin. These writings ends with the name of its calligrapher Seyyed Mahmood Naghash. All around the mausoleum, the lower section of the walls are decorated with beautiful tile works that are hexagon shaped. On the north side there is calligraphy on plaster stating that the body of a female member of the Safavi family, named Banoo Sultan was buried in the mausoleum, before it was moved to Mashhad. In addition, on the top of the door on the east side, there are three lines of poem from Saadi Shirazi that are less visible. It is important to note that the mausoleum had been repaired during the rule of the Shah Abbas I Safavi in 1604 (1013 Hegirae), because it was for sometime the burial place of Banoo Sultan. Shahshahan Mausoleum tile work Endowments and related documents Shahshahan Mausoleum endowment document As part his respect to Shah Alaeddin Mohammad, after the construction of the mausoleum, Sultan Muhammad made several major endowments for the Shahshahan Mausoleum.Mirza Zamani, Mohammad Reza, Shahshahan Mausoleum and Its Documents, Salname-e Keshvar Iran, 11th Year, 1958 (1336), pp.61-64. They included, among others, the village of Esfehanak, Isfahan,According to Jean Chardin in his The Travels of John Chardin to Persia, Esfahanak (meaning small Isfahan) is an agricultural area with a population of more than four thousand households. the village of Valasan in Freidan and Darzian in the district of Kararag, or Keraj Rural District located mostly about few miles south on the road from Isfahan to Shiraz. These properties were primarily cultivated farms and orchards. The intention was to use the income, generated by these endowments, to pay for the upkeep and expenses of the Mausoleum and its HosseiniehThe Hosseinieh is a building that dates back to Shah Alaeddin's ancestors. It does not refer to Hosseinien in its ordinary sense, it rather means the \\"house of seyyeds\\" (Dar- alsadat). and also for feeding the poor and needy. The scroll documenting the endowment of the aforementioned properties has been certified by several prominent scholars, including Sheikh Baha al-Din Muhammad al-'Amili during the Safavid kings.Balaghi, Seyyed Abdol-Hojjat, Ansab-e Khandanhaye Mardom-e Naien (The ancestors of Naien Families), Sepehr Publisher, 1950 (1329), pp. 176-181. This document, as part of the valuable collection of the historical documents of Hossein Shahshahani was given to the Reza Abbasi Museum in Tehran in 1978 (1357). Additionally, according to the endowment document, the trustee in charge must be a descendant of this dynasty (Shahshahani or Shah Alaie families), whoever at times is the most trusted, respected, pious and learned person. The act of endowment took place in 1446 (850 Hegirae) and the endowment document is dated 1448 (852). Recent years In recent years, specifically from the early 1930s to late 1950s, Hossein Shahshahani, a descendant of Shah Alaeddin, managed to restore and re-establish the identity of Shahshahan mausoleum during his long judicial career. He battled in courts for many years to extricate the endowments of the Shahshahan mausoleum from unlawful occupiers. He repaired and rebuilt the mausoleum as an important historical building and constructed the Shahshahan School and Shahshahan Health Center beside it. He was helped by his younger brother Morteza Shahshahani who was a resident of Isfahan.Honarfar, Dr. Lotfollah, A Treasure of The Historical Monuments of Isfahan, (Ganjine-e Asar-e Tarikhi-e Esfahan), Isfahan, 1344 (1965). Shahshahani, who was buried in the mausoleum in 1962, had registered the mausoleum with the Iran Society For National and Historical Monuments under Registration Number 368 on February 21, 1949 (2 Esfand 1327).Mirza Zamani, Mohammad Reza, Shahshahan Mausoleum and Its Documents, Salname-e Keshvar Iran, 11th Year, 1958 (1336), pp.61-64. After the Iranian Revolution in 1979, very little or no attention is paid to this important Timurid monument, in spite of the fact that the organization of Isfahan Cultural Heritage (Miras-e Farhangi) is in the neighborhood of the Shahshahan Circle.

She was emeritus professor of geography at University College, Dublin. Background Buttimer grew up in Ireland with strong Catholic convictions. She studied at University College Cork (BA, geography, Latin and mathematics 1957) and the National University of Ireland (master's in geography, 1959). After this, she joined the Dominican Order and moved to Seattle. She remained in the order for 17 years.Mels, Tom (2010). \\"Anne Buttimer\\". In Hubbard, Phil; Kitchin, Rob. Key Thinkers on Space and Place (2nd ed.). Sage. pp. 91–97. . Her PhD in geography was from the University of Washington in 1965 and concerned conceptual and methodological foundations for social geography. She was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Louvain and from 1966 to 1968 worked as an assistant professor at the Seattle University. She spent two years at the University of Glasgow working in the social geography of housing, before joining Clark University from 1970–1981 where she firmly established a reputation as a social geographer and social scientist. In 1982 she was based in Lund as a research fellow of the Swedish Council for Humanities and Social Sciences, then briefly a professor at the Université d'Ottawa (1989–91) before moving to University College Dublin 1991–2003. A multilingual scholar, she has also held numerous short-term positions in Europe. She was president of the IGU 2000–2004 and the first geographer to be vice-president of Academia Europaea in 2012. Scholarship In the early part of her career, the quantitative revolution occupied social scientists, and Buttimer trained in this tradition at Washington before moving beyond it towards philosophical themes at the intersection of the bio-physical and human sciences. These shaped her research directions in spirituality, social geography, and particularly the humanistic documentation of everyday life experiences. These areas served as a model for the ways in which geographers can bridge the theory-practice divide. Her contributions have been to history and philosophy of science, urban and social geography, migration and identity, environmental experience, nature and culture, environment and sustainable development, and the human dimensions of global change. She chaired an EU-funded research network on sustainable development that had a significant influence on EU policy debates; her work provided important insights into the ways in which communication between scientists and planners can be improved. She authored many books and articles on society and space, urban planning, the history of ideas, and environmental policy. She is perhaps best known for her The Practice of Geography (1983) and for combining French, Swedish, and anglophone academic traditions in the study of humanity and environment. In 2014, she was awarded the Vautrin Lud Prize, colloquially called the \\"Nobel Prize for Geography\\". She died on 15 July 2017.

APIs  The Maps API: acts as a dynamic tile service, which creates new tiles based on client requests. This allows users to design maps in the web application, then use those styles and data in custom web applications. The SQL API, where PostgreSQL-supported SQL statements can be used to retrieve data from the database. The SQL API serves data in various formats including Shapefile, GeoJSON, and CSV. The Data Services API allows for easily building functionalities such as routing, geocoding, and vector basemaps.  JavaScript Libraries  Finally, there are the Carto.js and CARTO VL libraries, which can wrap the APIs into complete visualizations or be used to integrate data into other web applications with raster or vector renderings, respectively  CARTOframes  CARTOframes is a Python package for integrating CARTO maps, analysis, and data services into data science workflows via Jupyter notebooks.  Data Observatory  CARTO offers a wide range of datasets from around the globe accessible though their Data Observatory, which acts as their spacial data repository.

Older hogs mostly get sick and lose weight after being infected, whereas newborn piglets usually die within five days of contracting the virus. PEDV cannot be transmitted to humans, nor contaminate the human food supply. It was first discovered in Europe, but has become increasingly problematic in Asian countries, such as Korea, China, Japan, the Philippines, and Thailand. It has also spread to North America: it was discovered in the United States on May 5, 2013 in Indiana,Snelson, H. (2014). Comprehensive Discussion of PEDv, Slide 3, American Association of Swine Veterinarians presentation to the 2014 Pork Management Conference, June 19, 2014, http://www.slideshare.net/trufflemedia/dr-harry-snelson-pedv-lessons-learned and in Canada in the winter of 2014. In January 2014, a new variant strain of PEDV with three deletions, one insertion, and several mutations in S (spike) 1 region was identified in Ohio by the Animal Disease Diagnostic Lab of Ohio Department of Agriculture. PEDV has a substantial economic burden given that it is highly infectious, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality in piglets. Morbidity and mortality rates were lower for vaccinated herds than for nonvaccinated herds, which suggests the emergence of a new PEDV field strain(s) for which the current vaccine, based on the CV777 strain, was partially protective. Consumers are likely to feel the effects of the viral disease in the form of higher prices for pork products. Evolution thumb A Bayesian study of 138 genomes showed that the virus has six subtypes.Jang J, Yoon SH, Lee W, Yu J, Yoon J, Shim S, Kim H (2018) Time-calibrated phylogenomics of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus: genome-wide insights into the spatio-temporal dynamics. Genes Genomics 40(8):825-834. doi: 10.1007/s13258-018-0686-0 Groups 1 and 2 originated in North America and groups 3–5 originated in Asia. The evolution rate of the genome was estimated to be 3.38 × 10−4 substitutions/site/year similar to other RNA viruses. The most recent common ancestor of the extant strains evolved ~1943.  Clinical Signs  PED is an acute disease with an incubation period of 1-4 days. The virus causes diarrhea and vomiting resulting in severe dehydration. In neonates the mortality can be up to 100% in virulent strains. Older pigs generally recover in 7-10 days.  Transmission  PED is transmitted by fecal-oral transmission and the infectious dose is low. Pre-weaned piglets shed large amounts of virus in their feces resulting in rapid spread and high mortality rates. Older animals do not shed as much virus in their feces as piglets. It can also be spread via contaminated fomites. A study showed that when aerosolized virus particles can spread up to 10 miles from the source of infection.  Necropsy Findings  Post-mortem findings in suckling animals include empty stomach contents with little milk curd. The intestines are thin walled and distended, filled with a watery content. Diagnosis of PED is confirmed using PCR from feces or intestines of affected animals, or by immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed tissue.

In 1775 Harbord Harbord, 1st Baron Suffield, Member of Parliament for Norwich, commissioned James Wyatt to make significant additions to the house. The grounds were developed by Charles Harbord, 5th Baron Suffield, employing William Milford Teulon as the landscaper. However, the hall was almost destroyed by fire in 1882 and lay derelict for nearly a century before Kit Martin, an architect, bought the hall in 1980 and converted it into individual houses. It is surrounded by a 1,000 acre deer park. The boathouse was rebuilt as a studio by the artist Gerard Stamp in 2004. St Andrew's Church, Gunton in woodland to the east of the hall is a redundant Church of England church. The church was built in 1769 and designed by Robert Adam for Sir William Harbord, to replace a medieval church.

Initially founded during World War I as a local train repair workshop, between the wars the company was part of the Polish State Railways. Confiscated, dismantled and sent to Germany during World War II, the company was rebuilt as a train repair workshop, but in 1951 it was turned into a defence contractor producing guns, firearms and machine tools. Initially the company license-built M1939 37 mm automatic air defense guns and Nudelman N-37 aircraft cannons used in LiM-2 and MiG-17 fighters. Later other types of Soviet-designed military equipment were also introduced: 57 mm AZP S-60 and ZU-23-2 AA guns, 2M-3M naval cannons, armament for the 2S1 Gvozdika SP howitzer, DShK, NSV and KPV heavy machine guns, as well as domestic designs. The latter group included ZU-23-2M Wróbel universal naval gun and its successor, the artillery-rocket set ZU-23-2MR Wróbel II. After 1989 the company switched entirely to home-designed weapons. Those include Pallad grenade launcher, RGP-40 grenade launcher, UKM-2000 MG, WKW Wilk sniper rifle, Bor rifle and ZSMU-36 missile and anti-missile system. Among projects currently developed in the Tarnów Mechanical Works are the WLKM-12 Szafir 12.7 mm multi-barrel machine gun, ZSMU-70 missile system and GA-40 belt-fed grenade launcher.

The main secretariat of the exchange was in Glasgow, while the Edinburgh, Dundee, and Aberdeen exchanges operated as local branches until 1971, when the local exchanges closed completely. During the construction of the new Scottish Stock Exchange building in St George's Place, Glasgow, the exchange was housed in a converted warehouse on Ingram Street. The new building was opened after two years' work on 13 April 1971. In 1973, the Scottish Stock Exchange merged into the London Stock Exchange. Since then, there have been calls to re-establish an independent stock exchange in Scotland. In 2016, plans were announced for the establishment of a Scottish Stock Exchange by a group of ex-NASDAQ traders and Scottish investors to be based in Edinburgh. The announcement was made after the referendum on the UK's membership of the EU, in which England and Wales voted to leave the European Union, but Scotland (and especially Edinburgh) voted to remain within the European Union. In 2018, fresh plans for a Scottish Stock Exchange were unveiled when businessman Tomás Carruthers announced a deal with Euronext to provide its Optiq software platform for a virtual exchange based in Scotland, tentatively known as Bourse Scot.

History In the late 1880s, the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad made its way through Wyoming, inspiring the Cambria Fuel Company miners to found Newcastle, Wyoming along the railroad. In the spring of 1889, Tubb Town was built by DeLoss Dewitt Tubbs, a resident of Custer, South Dakota, further down the expected site of the railroad; at first, it was only a store. Around that time, F. R. Curran set up an open-air bar, and by the time he built his house over it, the town was beginning to boom. The bar was used by workers from the Burlington & Missouri River Railroad. Later, oil drilling went on in the area.Lambert, Hugh K., and Watson Parker. Black Hills Ghost Towns. First ed. Vol. 1.

Tubb Town soon gained a reputation for being a very rough place to live; the initiation was to buy drinks for everyone at the saloons. Calamity Jane also visited the town once. However, on September 1, 1889, the railroad announced that it would not pass through Tubb Town. Tubbs did not realize that the Lincoln Land Company, a subsidiary of the railroad, had already plotted the towns to be built along the railroad. On September 10, 1889, the first lots in Newcastle were sold, and the exodus from Tubb Town to Newcastle began. One saloon owner set up shop in the back of his wagon and operated for the town's residents while on the move.Dobson, G.

She initially competed in F34 seated throwing events, and from 2011-2013 she became the reigning champion at European, World and Paralympic level in both shot put and javelin in her class. At the 2012 Summer Paralympic Games in London, she broke the world record in both her events. Following changes to the IPC rules for seated throws in 2014, she chose to compete in a standing position as an F36 athlete. She won the F36 shot put at the 2016 Summer Paralympic Games with a Paralympic record throw. she is World Record holder in the Women's F36 shot put, a distance of 11.52 m set in July 2016. Para Athletics World Records - Women's Shot Put Career history =Early history= Kober was born in 1971 and grew up in Munich. She took to sport at a young age, and by 14 she was involved in athletics and the javelin throw while at school in Munich. At the age of 16 a reaction with medical treatment left her deaf, and a year later she suffered an epileptic seizure. While still a teenager she moved to the Ruhr region where she attended a school for the deaf. She continued her education, specializing in medicine but was forced to cut her studies in 2006 to help care for her sick mother. In 2007 Kober suffered from a status epilepticus and she was rushed to hospital, but after complications she was left with ataxia. =Athletics career= Kober returned to athletics in 2008, mainly as a form of enjoyment with no serious ambitions to take the sport further. She joined TSV Bayer 04 Leverkusen where she was coached by Joachim Lipske. Kober was quickly identified as a potential talent in throwing events and by 2009 she was competing in national competitions. Classified as a T/F34 category para-athlete, Kober specialized in both the javelin and shot put. She qualified for the 2011 IPC Athletics World Championships in Christchurch, New Zealand, and took gold in both her events. In the shot put, where she competed in a mixed F32/33/34 grouping, she threw a distance of 9.30m, a new world record. In 2012, in the build-up to the Summer Paralympics in London, she entered the European Championships in Stadskanaal in the Netherlands. She again dominated the field taking both gold medals and recording a world record in the shot put with a throw of 10.06m. At the Paralympics she recorded a distance of 27.03m in the javelin and three days later she threw 10.25m in the shot put. Both distances were new world records in the F34 classification and gave her gold in both events. Kober defended her World titles when she travelled to Lyon for the 2013 World Championships. She took both the javelin throw (F33/34) and shot put titles, equaling her world record throw in the javelin.

On the strength of his fluency in German and French which he had studied at school and night classes he was promoted to officer and transferred to the British Army Intelligence Corps in 1916. He was first assigned to the staff of the British military governor of Cologne where he was put in charge of interrogating prisoners of war. Later he worked for the Allied High Commissioner for the Rhineland. It was during this earlier period that he became interested in journalism. Presiding over a large source of original information from debriefing prisoners he wrote to The Times offering the occasional article on non-classified information. In 1922, Gedye chose a career in journalism. He spent almost two decades working as a reporter for leading British and American newspapers in Central Europe. Based out of Cologne, he was soon known and recognised for his investigative reporting. Gedye's reports for The Times about the occupation of the Ruhr in 1923 were an indictment of the imperialist pursuits of Poincaré. Early on he recognised the severe economic restrictions on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles as providing fertile ground for the rise of National Socialism. Because of this reporting, he was recalled to London in 1924 to the foreign policy department of The Times. He was unhappy working at an office desk in London. Believing that Austria would become a crucial listening post for rapidly growing political problems in Central Europe he asked to be transferred to Vienna. His increasingly alarmist warnings about the dangers of the rise of fascism failed to endear him to his establishment editors and he parted ways with The Times. With a growing reputation for his fearless reportage and contacts he found little difficulty in freelance work contributing to the Daily Express before settling as The Daily Telegraph Central Europe correspondent while working in the evenings, because of later deadlines, for The New York Times. Working for both papers from 1929, he was appointed as New York Times Bureau Chief for Central and South Eastern Europe. He also wrote for other newspapers, including for The Daily Herald and other British newspapers. In Vienna he became known among colleagues as “The Lone Wolf” for keeping a certain distance from the group of Anglo-Saxon correspondents that often gathered in the city’s cafes and bars including Marcel Fodor, John Gunther and Dorothy Thompson. \\"In Vienna, he had witnessed the struggle of the young republic against inflation and economic crisis, he had witnessed the services of a social democratic local government – and the disastrous policies of a number of clerical governments. Gedye had come to Vienna as a democrat. But, as he explained in his own words, under the thunder of Dollfuss cannons, under the experience of the February battles, he became a Social Democrat.\\" In 1934 Gedye helped the young Kim Philby rescue fighters of the Republican Defense Corps. At times Gedye circumvented news censorship imposed by Austria by driving to Bratislava to submit his reports. Two weeks after the Anschluss Gedye was deported by the Gestapo as an undesirable alien. After a short stay in London, he moved to Prague, where he completed his most famous book: Fallen Bastions with the sub-title “Betrayal in Central Europe—Austria and Czechoslovakia”. In it, Gedye sharply attacked Chamberlain’s appeasement policy, putting into words \\"what the Austrians and Czechs sold to fascism felt and suffered, but under the thumb of Hitler and the threat of the concentration camp could not say themselves.\\" Despite becoming one of the pre- eminent political journalists of that era for opening the eyes of a British government blundering through compromise and appeasement (Churchill used to telephone The Daily Telegraph’s night desk to find out “what Gedye has written”), the newspaper eventually recalled him to London shortly before the publication of Fallen Bastions. The book’s original publishers had backed out of publication after showing the manuscript to the newspaper. Both publisher and the newspaper’s editors objected to the book's passionate indictment and scathing condemnation of Chamberlain's course. The Daily Telegraph, for which Gedye had been working for a decade, gave him the choice of either removing certain passages attacking Chamberlain and continuing his post as Central Europe correspondent or resigning. Gedye decided in favour of publishing and gave up his position. The success of the work proved him right — it appeared within two months in five editions. He also took at his erstwhile employers by getting the new publishers Victor Gollancz to write on the dust cover “By G E R Gedye, former Central Europe Correspondent of The Daily Telegraph.” After the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia on 14 March 1939, Gedye, on the wanted list of the Gestapo, had to hide for ten days in the attic of the British Embassy in Prague, until receiving permission from the Germans to emigrate to Poland. Until 1940, Gedye was the New York Times correspondent in Moscow, having asked to be posted there because of his admiration for the intellectual attraction of Communism. It took him just over a year working in Stalinist Russia with all its cruelties and deprivations to disabuse him of his romantic ideals. Asking to be relieved of his assignment he returned to Europe where he followed up on an earlier offer from the British embassy in Prague to join SOE, the fledgling wartime intelligence service. He and his partner and future wife Litzi, his PA in Vienna who was recruited at the same time, spent the war years several years in Turkey, Cairo and Istanbul. Among other things, he served as an executive officer for the exiled Austrian Social Democrats Karl Hans Sailer and Stefan Wirlandner. The latter tried in 1943 to make connections from Istanbul to Austria. In 1942, Litzi and Gedye were arrested by the Turkish police. German newspapers claimed that he was involved in a conspiracy to assassinate the German Ambassador Franz von Papen. They were soon released and re-assigned to the Middle East. From 1945 Gedye was again a central Europe correspondent, this time for the socialist London newspaper The Guardian. Among other things, he wrote a series of articles exposing conditions in starving Vienna. A civil assistant with the rank of Major in the War Office, Gedye was appointed MBE in 1946.https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/37617/supplement/3128 Gedye also wrote against the expulsion of the Sudeten German population from Czechoslovakia after 1945. In 1950 until he retired in 1967 he was appointed bureau chief of Radio Free Europe in Vienna, the American news organisation monitoring and reporting on Communism throughout Europe. Gedye was twice married; firstly in 1922, to Liesel Bremer, secondly in 1948, to Alice ('Litzi') Lepper Mehler.Who was Who in America, vol. 5, 1969-1973, Marquis- Who's Who, 1973, p. 264 Gedye's only son, by his second marriage, Robin Gedye, joined The Daily Telegraph in 1978 where he worked until 1996 as a foreign correspondent. He was expelled from Moscow in 1985 in a tit-for-tat when Margaret Thatcher’s government expelled 34 Soviet diplomats. He covered the rise and fall of the Polish free trade union Solidarity and was the newspaper’s bureau chief in Germany when the Berlin Wall was breached and for the subsequent years of reunification.

He became a toolmaker in Berlin and joined the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD) as well as the Revolutionary Stewards. During the revolution, Grylewicz became a deputy to Emil Eichhorn who had led an occupation of the Berlin police headquarters and become police chief.Broue, P.

Grylewicz took part in the technical preparations in Moscow for the abortive 1923 uprising and was tried alongside Arkadi Maslow but was granted an amnesty. During this period he was also elected onto the KPD Zentrale and was from 4 May until 20 October a KPD member of the Reichstag, although when Maslow and Ruth Fischer were removed from the leadership of the KPD in 1926 he was removed from the Zentrale and was excluded from the party altogether after acting as a spokesman for the Left Opposition at 11th party conference. Oppositionist Grylewicz was a founder member of the Leninbund and became the leading figure of its Trotskyist minority, eventually fusing with other groups to form the United Left Opposition of the KPD. During this time Grylewicz ran a publishing house for many of Trotsky's works. When the Nazis came to power in 1933, the SA destroyed Grylewicz's home and private library and he fled to Czechoslovakia, first living in Reichenberg, then Prague.

Although not one of the original cast members himself, Sasser's relationship with Zamora was one of the focal points of that season. This included a commitment ceremony in which the two exchanged vows, the first such ceremony for a same sex couple on television, and considered a landmark event in the medium.Duke, Alan; Carter, Chelsea, J.

Retrieved November 28, 1964.Oldenburg, Ann (August 8, 2013). \\"'Real World' star Sean Sasser dies at 44\\". USA Today. Early life Sean Franklin Sasser was born on October 25, 1968, in Detroit, where he grew up. When he was six, his parents divorced, after which his father, an army sergeant, was mostly absent from his life,McGonough, Megan (August 13, 2013). \\"Sean Sasser, part of one of TV’s first gay romances, dies at 44\\".

(Years later his father called when Sasser was in Minneapolis, and left a message with Sasser's boyfriend, but left no number and did not call back.) Sasser's mother, Patricia Sasser, continued to raise Sasser and his younger sister. Sasser attended a private school, which he said was probably not typical of most African-American young people in urban Detroit. He later attended Cass Technical High School, a select college-preparatory magnet school. After high school, Sasser attended the University of Chicago to study Near Eastern civilizations and become an archeologist, commenting, \\"I wanted to be one of the first major black archeologists to call the bluff on all this Egyptian stuff that was stolen by other cultures.\\" However, he found himself bored and depressed, and barely completed his freshman year. Sasser dropped out of college, intending initially to take a year off. After he came out as gay to his devoutly religious mother (the daughter of a minister mother), he attempted to enlist in the United States Navy, explaining in a 1997 interview, \\"I didn't want to be gay anymore. I thought it would work. You know, the discipline, all that stuff.\\" Before he could leave his home, however, a mandatory blood test revealed that the 19-year-old Sasser was HIV-positive. He decided to enroll in culinary school, as he had always been fond of cooking, and wanted to open his own restaurant. After finishing school, Sasser found jobs cooking in local Chicago restaurants, but was too fixated on the idea of dying from AIDS. Realizing that he \\"needed to figure out how to keep living\\", he moved to San Francisco, whose greater HIV awareness and diversity allowed him to find people he more easily related to – specifically, HIV-positive people closer to his own age – which raised his spirits. Sasser joined a youth HIV-positive movement that advocated attention for adolescents with the disease, and began speaking to groups about his own experience with HIV. He subsequently assisted a support group called Bay Area Positives, for young people of color. He appeared in a number of videos on behalf of the group, including \\"Not Me\\", which aired on PBS. He was photographed by Annie Leibovitz for a national AIDS awareness campaign. Relationship with Pedro Zamora and The Real World Sasser attended the 1993 Lesbian and Gay March on Washington, where he introduced himself to a fellow AIDS educator named Pedro Zamora. Although Sasser did not characterize his meeting Zamora as love at first sight (they were both involved with other people at the time), he was moved by Zamora's presence and conviction, recalling, \\"I was kind of like, 'Wow.' I had never run across someone who was as good at it as he was.\\" Sasser encouraged Zamora to call him if Zamora ever visited San Francisco. Sasser subsequently learned that producers of The Real World were looking for an HIV-positive person to cast in the 1994 season in San Francisco season, where Sasser had been living for a couple of years, and eventually learned that the person cast was Zamora, whom Sasser felt was ideal for the role.Winick, Judd (2000). Pedro and Me: Friendship, Loss, and What I Learned. Henry Holt & Co. pp. 103-109. Sasser had been living in San Francisco for a couple of years in the 1990s. When Zamora moved into The Real World San Francisco loft, he and Sasser began dating. Zamora asked the show's producers for permission to go out on the second date without cameras, so that he and Sasser could get to know one another in a more natural setting. After the producers allowed this, Sasser and Zamora fell in love, and their relationship became a focal point of the season. Their relationship met with the approval of Zamora's housemates and close friends, Judd Winick and Pam Ling, the latter of whom joked that Sasser and Zamora \\"would become the mayors of Castro Street\\". Winick adds that whereas Sasser was a private person who harbored the ability to pack up and leave town on short notice, Zamora's openness led them to discuss more permanent living arrangements as a couple. Sasser proposed to Zamora, and the two exchanged vows in a commitment ceremony in the loft, the first such ceremony for a same-sex couple in television history. After production on The Real World ceased in June 1994, Zamora visited his family in Miami before returning to San Francisco to live with Sasser. In August 1994, Zamora was diagnosed in New York City with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML),Winick (2000). pp. 119-137. and was given three to four months to live. On September 3, Zamora was flown to Mercy Hospital in Miami, where his family could be close to him.Israel, Betsy (November 28, 1994). \\"HIV, And Positive, Pedro Zamora of MTV's Real World Lived His Too-Brief Life To Its Limit\\". People. Vol. 42, No. 22A Tribute to Pedro Zamora MTV. November 1994. His family was not accepting of Sasser, however, and because the PML gradually took away Zamora's ability to speak,Winick (2000). pp. 141-161. Zamora was unable to explicitly communicate to them the importance of Sasser in his life. This led to confrontations between Sasser and the Zamoras, who told him that \\"Pedro did not need to have a lover anymore\\", and mostly excluded Sasser from Zamora during his final days. Zamora died on November 11, 1994.Rothaus, Steve (March 22, 2009). \\"Years After his Death, A Young AIDS Activist's Life is Celebrated on Film: Remembering Pedro\\". The Miami Herald. p. 1E. Sasser returned to San Francisco two days later. Six months after Zamora's death, he resumed his speaking engagements for LGBT and HIV issues. In 1995, he spoke at the inaugural White House AIDS conference, and was appointed by President Bill Clinton to the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS. He moved to Atlanta in late 1995, in order to be with his boyfriend, and hoped to open a café. In 2008 Bunim-Murray Productions produced a film, Pedro, directed by Nick Oceano, dramatizing Zamora's life. In the film, Sasser is portrayed by DaJuan Johnson. Sasser took issue with the film's portrayal of his relationship with Zamora's family. In the film, after Zamora is hospitalized in Miami, his father and brothers initially refuse to accept Sasser as Zamora's spouse, telling Sasser that their time in San Francisco is over, and attempt to keep them apart. After Zamora objects to this, Zamora's family is made to watch the video of their commitment ceremony, and accept Sasser as Zamora's husband. Sasser, who regretted not having had an opportunity to spend more time with Zamora, says that this was not what occurred in reality, saying, \\"I have a lot of resentment toward dealing with his family's homophobia, as well as dealing with him dying... It's troublesome. If there had been some sort of support behind our commitment ceremony... I had a hard time dealing with his family. With Pedro's death and being allowed in the hospital... I don't know. Maybe it could have helped the family deal with my presence, you know?\\" After The Real World Sasser was a pastry chef at Ritz-Carlton hotel properties and head pastry chef at The Nines, a luxury hotel in Portland, Oregon.Beck, Byron (October 22, 2008). \\"To the Nines: Adding it all up at Portland’s most luxurious new hotel.\\" Willamette Week.DiGuglielmo, Joey (September 18, 2013). \\"Remembering Sean Sasser\\".

While living in the district, Sasser served as a board member of the AIDS Alliance for Children, Youth and Families. He was active in youth and mentoring organizations, and he and Kaplan served as foster parents to a 4-year-old girl. Death and legacy In July 2013, Sasser, who had been HIV-positive for 25 years, was also diagnosed with mesothelioma, a rare cancer of the lungs. Sasser had no known occupational exposure to asbestos, the primary cause of mesothelioma, though studies suggest that \\"chronic immunosuppression enhances susceptibility to mesothelioma.\\" He died at his home on August 7, 2013, at the age of 44. In accordance with his wishes, his body was cremated, and his ashes spread upon places he had been or wished to visit. He is survived by his husband, Michael, mother, Patricia, and his sister, a dancer who lives in Detroit with her husband and daughter. Sasser's relationship with Zamora is credited with breaking a taboo against showing two men in a loving, stable relationship on television. Real World: Miami cast member Dan Renzi, himself openly gay, stated, \\"Long before Ellen or Will & Grace showcased gay people on TV living mainstream lives, and before the magic of protease inhibitor 'cocktails' turned HIV into a manageable disease, Sasser gave a brave face to both issues and brought those taboo topics to educate millions of young Americans.\\"Fernandez, Maria Elena (August 8, 2013). \\"Sean Sasser of 'Real World: San Francisco' dead at 44\\".

She was the first chart-topping female artist to collaborate with the Bee Gees (April's 1966 single 'He's a Thief/A Long Time Ago'). Early life and career April attended St. Peters Collegiate Girls School in Adelaide, South Australia. Her earliest employers/mentors include Rupert Murdoch ('Seventeeners', 'Sing Sing Sing', 'Studio A'), Clyde Packer ('Woodie's Teen Time', 'Bandstand'), producer/songwriter Nat Kipner, and Australian rock legend Johnny O'Keefe. Her then business managers were Ron Tremaine and his wife Patricia Tremaine (née Morris, Miss South Australia 1959). April relocated to Melbourne in 1963 to play the Ivan Dayman dance circuit, including Festival Hall and the Palais St. Kilda, with other Australian teenage pop singers including Normie Rowe, Olivia Newton-John and Bobby and Laurie. Due to a resemblance to Elizabeth Taylor, April was sometimes referred to as 'Australia's Liz Taylor'. April's first recording on Festival's Leedon Label, 'Make the World Go Away', won the 3UZ (Melbourne) Golden Sound Award 1963–64 for best-produced song in Australia. April was also awarded the 5KA (Adelaide) Best Female Artist Award 1964–65. During this time, April's image appeared under Coca-Cola bottle caps in Australia. Australian music career left In 1964, Everybody's Magazine's headline read 'Oh, to be in Melbourne, Now that April's There' – mentioning April's Golden Sound Award and focusing the Australian pop industry on Melbourne. April's award plus The Go!! Show, where April was resident female star of the first season, set the cornerstone for the second wave of pop/rock in Australia that began in Melbourne at that time and produced the next Australian 'king of pop', Normie Rowe. April was touted as being \\"second only to The Beatles\\" when her cover of 'Make the World Go Away' stayed near the top of the charts for many weeks in several States, while the Beatles occupied the top four or five spots. April's manager at this time was Horrie Dargie, head of DYT Productions, which produced The Go!! Show. After the first season of The Go!! Show, April was let go by DYT Productions due to her being 16 years old, pregnant, and unmarried. Her pregnancy was shrouded in secrecy and termed a ‘mystery illness’ in the music columns of the time period. According to Australian music historian Bill Casey, the pregnancy derailed April's pop career and it \\"never really regained momentum.\\" April moved to Sydney, where she and her family were supported by promoter Ivan Dayman, and later the Jacobsen Agency. After her daughter (Cinderella) was born, April joined Johnny O'Keefe, Dinah Lee, and Max Merritt and the Meteors on the Johnny O'Keefe/Jacobsen Agency train tour of New South Wales and Queensland. In Sydney, April played the RSL and Leagues clubs, the Motor Club and other major venues, television shows (Don Lane Show, Studio A, Paul Hogan Show, etc.) and performed with Helen Reddy, Dudley Moore, Peter Allen, John Rowles, young guitarist Rick Springfield, and toured with the Mills Brothers. It was during this time in Sydney that April first collaborated with the Bee Gees, Nat Kipner, and Ossie Byrne at the St. Clair Studio, Hurstville. In 1969, April toured New South Wales and Queensland with Johnny Farnham and later played venues in Brisbane and the Gold Coast with The Masters Apprentices. April's second daughter, Candy, was born in October 1969. During the 1970s April was awarded Queensland Entertainer of the Year 1974–75. In 1977, April joined Johnny O'Keefe and the cast of \\"The Return of J.O.K and the Good Ol' Days of Rock n' Roll\\" at the St. George's Leagues Club.  Work with the Bee Gees  April Byron and Barry Gibb In 1965–66, when April was the current recipient of the 5KA Best Female Artist Award and Barry Gibb was the current 5KA Songwriter of the Year Award recipient (his first songwriting award), April collaborated on a single with the Bee Gees, then also in their teens. The single, 'A Long Time Ago/He's a Thief', began the Gibb's succession of collaborations with female singers, which later included Samantha Sang, Barbra Streisand, Dionne Warwick, Dolly Parton, and Celine Dion. In 1982, April again collaborated with the Bee Gees at their Middle Ear Studio in Miami Beach, FL. April was given songs by the Bee Gees ('Falling in Love With You' and 'Don't Forget to Remember Me') which she recorded in Music City, Nashville, TN, but were never released. Move to the United States April left Australia with her family in 1978 to pursue a film career in the US. April Byron, 1978. April continued her singing career, touring the US, playing the Stardust Hotel (Las Vegas), the Sheraton Resort Hotel (Miami Beach), and the Bourbon Street Blues and Boogie Bar (Nashville), among other venues. Personal life April has two daughters, Cinderella Abrams (née Potts) and Candy Potts, and four grandchildren – Ashenputtel (Ashlee) Abrams, Melanie Abrams, Emmalee Rainbow Abrams, and Kingsley Knecht. April's first daughter Cinderella (stage name Cindy Byron), at age 9, became one of the youngest stars of the 1970s Australian nationwide children's television series Happy Go 'Round (QTQ-9 Brisbane, Queensland). April's second daughter Candy appeared in 13 episodes of VH1's reality show 'Saddle Ranch' in 2011–12. April resides in Beverly Hills, CA, where she manages the entertainment careers of daughter Candy and granddaughters Ashenputtel, Melanie, and Emmalee Rainbow. Emmalee is a young prodigy Chef starring in Man Vs. Child Chef Showdown, as a series regular.

His seminal paper on \\"The Right To Treatment\\" appeared in 1960 in the American Bar Association Journal, marking the first published use of the term sanism to describe a form of discrimination against the mentally ill. His \\"right to treatment\\" concept primarily addressed the legal right of 'mentally ill' patients who were involuntarily confined to receive appropriate care. He went as far as suggesting that if suitable treatment was not provided then the person should be entitled to be released, even if this presented a risk to themselves and others. It was his belief that this practice was the only way to ensure public opinion would demand suitable treatment be made available. Over a period of two years, fifty publications refused the paper. It was not published by a psychiatric journal until 1965. At the time, public mental hospitals were warehousing large numbers of patients, often without significant treatment efforts or qualified treatment staff.\\"His Triumph Over an Asylum May Help Many People\\", Philadelphia Inquirer, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, pg. 113, 8 August 1976  Early life and education  Birnbaum was born to Jewish parents on October 20, 1926 in Brooklyn, NY. He attended Erasmus Hall High School and then Columbia University. After serving in the US Navy, Birnbaum received his law degree from Columbia Law School in 1951. He earned his medical degree from New York Medical College in 1957. He then undertook a postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard University in 1958, which included a training program funded by a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health. He earned his final degree, a Doctor of Jurisprudence (JD), a legal doctoral degree, from Columbia University in 1961. Throughout his life, Birnbaum would work as an internist in a private gerontology practice in Bedford-Stuyvesant and conduct legal work pro bono. It was through his pro bono work that he first advocated for better treatment for the mentally ill, winning several legal victories for their civil rights, and for improved Medicaid benefits in state hospitals. Important concepts and cases =Birnbaum's \\"right to treatment\\" concept= Birnbaum's \\"right to treatment\\" doctrine asserted that mentally ill patients confined against their will had a fundamental legal right to proper treatment. After publishing an article describing the legal concept of \\"right to treatment\\" in 1960 and getting it published in the New York Times, Birnbaum was contacted by two separate psychiatric patients confined for mental health issues, Edward Stephens and Kenneth Donaldson, and acquired their cases. He would spend the next decade fighting similar cases, often using his own funding to finance his expenses.Law Precept Urged: Aid for Mentally Ill; LAW RULE URGED FOR MENTALLY ILL By LAWRENCE O'KANE, New York Times, May 26, 1961 Though Birnbaum found success arguing for Donaldson, he was unsuccessful arguing the case of Edward Stephens, a man with schizophrenia who was detained in prison for more than 30 years without treatment, though Stephens was later released. Other lawyers disagreed with his concept because it still allowed that a patient could be indefinitely detained as long as some potentially superficial criteria were met (staffing levels, some claimed treatment), and instead argued for a better review process. =O'Connor v. Donaldson, 1961-75, lengthy landmark case= Ken Donaldson was confined fourteen years at a Florida State Mental Hospital in Chatahoochee from 1957-71 without his consent by his parents for \\"incompetency\\". Birnbaum first took on the case in the late 60's, though he had many earlier contacts with Donaldson beginning around 1960, encouraging him unsuccessfully to petition the courts for his release. In 1967 Birnbaum petitioned the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals on behalf of Donaldson, but when he was turned down, he decided to file the case with the Supreme Court.\\"He Fought to Prove His Sanity\\", The Baltimore Sun, Baltimore, Maryland, pg. 9, 298, 23 October 1977 In all, Donaldson wrote 19 appeals for a court hearing. In helping to bring the Florida-based Donaldson case to the U. S. Supreme Court in the landmark case O'Connor v. Donaldson, Birnbaum was instrumental in not only \\"confirming the right to treatment\\" for many mental patients, but also in \\"proposing a way to achieve better therapy for those now in inadequate public mental hospitals\\". After Donaldson was released in 1971 at the age of 63, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Donaldson unanimously on June 26, 1975, and trumpeted the words of Judge Potter Stewart that \\"mentally ill patients cannot be confined in institutions against their will and without treatment if they are dangerous to no one and are capable of surviving on the outside\\". Donaldson upon release was awarded £20,000. Over a period of 14 years inside, doctors had spoken to him for a total of less than 5 hours. Donaldson would go on to work for a year as a night auditor for a hotel, and began writing a book on conditions in mental institutions, entitled Insanity Inside Out.Butcher, Lee, Tampa Bay Times, \\"The Sweet Smell of Freedom\\", pg. 237, 24 October 1976 To the disappointment of Birnbaum, the court ruled so narrowly and stated their opinion so ambiguously in Donaldson that it was doubtful whether many other mentally ill patients would be released from confinement through the use of State or other regional courts.Rensberger, Boyce, \\"Right for Treatment for Mentally Ill Back in Court\\", The Morning News, Wilmington, Delaware, pg.17, 26 September 1975 Birnbaum was quoted as saying \\"The Donaldson case did nothing to guarantee the right of treatment to all the other patients who are still institutionalized,...as the Chief Justice was unable to determine what 'adequate treatment should be\\". The Supreme Court decision never directly addressed Birnbaum's concept of \\"Right to Treatment\\", but instead wrote that \\"a person could not be held against their will unless they were deemed dangerous to themselves or others\\".Ezell, Wayne, \\"Chattahoochie: From the Inside Looking Out\\", Tallahassee Democrat, Tallahassee, Florida, pg. 11, 19 July 1976 Birnbaum lamented the obstacles of obtaining treatment, noting that in Florida there was only one Doctor for one thousand patients. He would later recall with amazement that for 14 years, in every Florida and federal court with jurisdiction and before more than 30 state, federal, and Supreme Court judges, he was unable to obtain a fundamental writ of habeas corpus for Mr. Donaldson. Securing the writ would have required the State, as custodian, to release Donaldson from confinement, at least temporarily, and bring him to court to determine the cause of his confinement. =Rouse v. Cameron, 1966= A partial legal victory involving the right to treatment argument was the case of Rouse v. Cameron (1966), when U.S. Appeals Court District Judge David L. Bazelon became the first appellate judge, writing for the court, to state that civilly committed mental patients had a \\"right to treatment.\\" Birnbaum's client had been found not guilty by reason of insanity on a deadly weapons charge and hospitalized indefinitely. Birnbaum argued that his client would have to be released if he did not receive proper care. Observations on the treatment of psychopathic offenders, 1966 Around 1966, Birnbaum argued that offenders diagnosed as psychopaths should more often be sent to mental hospitals than prisons. He suggested that the unrelenting debate among many psychiatrists and lawyers about whether to use a McNaughten rule, Durham rule or Model Penal Code test for an insanity defense, would make no real difference to the outcome of the case and was a distraction from the real issues presented by the case. In 1966, he noted three essential factors affecting the law and confinement of psychopathic offenders; a need for a practical dividing line between the areas of mental health and correction; a lack of adequate psychiatric knowledge concerning the many aspects of the psychopathic personality, and a dire lack of personnel and facilities required to provide even minimal care for the nearly 500,000 patients in public mental health facilities at the time.Primum Non Nocere: How to Treat the Criminal Psychopath Birnbaum, Morton. American Bar Association Journal, Vol 52, No 1 (January 1966) pp. 69-73 =Wyatt v. Stickney, 1970= Beginning in 1970, Birnbaum was involved in the Alabama class-action lawsuit of Wyatt v. Stickney. U.S. District Court judge Frank Minis Johnson held that withholding adequate care and treatment from involuntarily committed patients was a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Subsequent hearings defining this right continued for decades, making Wyatt v. Stickney the longest mental health case in US history. Resolution of the case resulted in the \\"Wyatt Standards\\" which called for a humane psychological and physical environment, adequate staffing, and individualized treatment plans for involuntarily committed mental health patients. However, as Birnbaum pointed out, there was little in the way of effective enforcement, as was true in other cases he successfully brought to a verdict. In the mid-1970s case of Woe v. Weinberger, Birnbaum contended that \\"the states were segregating the mentally ill in such a fashion that the poorer and sicker patients went to inferior state hospitals while the wealthier and less ill went to better private hospitals.\\" Birnbaum also contended that the commitment laws of New York were unconstitutional because \\"they do not require that involuntary patients be given the active psychiatric care that was...the initial reason for their commitment.\\" = Sanism = Birnbaum is credited with coining the term sanism (from sane), a form of discrimination, which he felt was in all areas of life and which obstructed justice in the courtroom. He described it as: > ... the irrational thinking, feeling and behavior patterns of response by an > individual or by a society to the irrational behavior (and too often even > the rational behavior) of a mentally ill individual. It is morally > reprehensible because it is an unnecessary and disabling burden that is > added by our prejudiced society to the very real affliction of severe mental > illness … It should be clearly understood that sanists are bigots … According to Birnbaum's daughter, Rebecca Birnbaum MD, he was influenced in the concept by his close friend the lawyer and civil rights activist Florynce Kennedy, with whom he graduated from Columbia Law School. Kenneth Donaldson used the term sanism in his memoir \\"Insanity Inside Out,\\" in 1976, as well as acknowledging the 'dedicated fighter', Birnbaum. Later Michael L. Perlin, now professor at New York Law School, read about it in 1980 and would use and publish on it widely.Sanism in Theory and Practice May 9/10, 2011. Richard Ingram, Centre for the Study of Gender, Social Inequities and Mental Health. Simon Fraser University, Canada =The negative effects of deinstitutionalization= During his cases, Birnbaum sometimes disagreed with fellow advocates who were primarily concerned with civil liberties to the exclusion of welfare rights, such as lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union. The civil liberties advocates would emphasize a stricter due process on involuntary commitment and more rights to refuse forced treatment, sometimes resulting in a rejection of both treatment and confinement. Birnbaum was horrified to observe that deinstitutionalization or the process of replacing long-stay psychiatric hospitals with community mental health services often led to many mentally ill being placed in prison or put out on the streets rather than being properly cared for. He felt that a clearer standard for a therapeutic quality of care was needed, whether it be in the community or the hospital. Ultimately Birnbaum's legalistic approach failed to achieve a constitutional right to treatment, described as 'a disappointing failure'. Most 'right to treatment' cases were dealt with by 'consent decrees' which tended to descend into superficial bureaucratic disputes. In November 2005, Birnbaum died of a stroke in Brooklyn at the age of 79, survived by his wife Judith and children: Julius, Jacob, Belinda, Rebeca, and David.

Robinson (April 25, 1861 - April 1, 1914), was a mathematics professor paid $800 per year who was elevated for one year, 1889 to 1900, as the second president of Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, Louisiana. Robinson began teaching at Louisiana Tech when the institution consisted of one building with eight classrooms, a science laboratory, an auditorium, two offices, and a small frame building which served as a workshop. One of the offices was used as a reading room, the modest forerunner of Prescott Memorial Library, named for the first college president, Arthur T. Prescott, who provided the original reading materials at his own expense. In 1900, Robinson resigned as president to return to the classroom. He was succeeded by the English professor James B. Aswell,Ruston Daily Leader, October 11, 1933, p. 20 later a state superintendent of education, president of Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, Louisiana, and a member of the United States House of Representatives. Little is known of Robinson himself, but much attention has been placed on the campus building, Robinson Hall, named in his honor. Constructed in 1939, twenty-five years after Robinson's death, the building was originally a men's dormitory which had fallen into disrepair by the middle 1960s. With a refurbished interior but with the exterior still unaltered and easily identified by former alumni, Robinson Hall is the home of the Louisiana Tech speech and hearing center. The three-story red brick structure is built in the Colonial Revival style of architecture. The contractor was the T. L. James Company of Ruston. Robinson of Mount Lebanon, Louisiana, and his wife, Etta Asenah Moore Robinson (1869-1917) were both originally from Virginia. They had two children, Hunt Vaughn Robinson and Ealvise Conner Robinson, who died before their first birthdays as well as Herbert Lynn, Fred B., Esther, Virginia, Robert Hicks, and Luther William Robinson who survived to adulthood. The Robinsons are interred at Mt. Lebanon Cemetery near Gibsland in his native Bienville Parish. His gravestone has a Woodmen of the World emblem at the base. A later Louisiana Tech president also has a tie to Mount Lebanon. Claybrook Cottingham was the last president of Southern Baptist-affiliated Mount Lebanon College from 1905 to 1906, when he became from 1906 to 1910 a founding professor of the new Louisiana College in Pineville. His tenure as LC president stretched from 1910 to 1941, when he accepted the highest position at Louisiana Tech, then known as Louisiana Polytechnic Institute. And sixty-two years after Robinson left the Louisiana Tech presidency, F. Jay Taylor, a Gibsland native,\\"Gibsland High Grad Edits Civil War Diary\\", Minden Press, Minden, Louisiana, May 4, 1959, p. 13 became president and held the position for twenty-five years.

It was written by Grande, Harmony Samuels, H. \\"Carmen Reece\\" Culver, J. \\"Lonny\\" Bereal, James \\"J-Doe\\" Smith, Al Sherrod Lambert, Jeff Lorber and Sean. It features a prominent sample of the jazz instrumental song \\"Rain Dance\\" (1979) by The Jeff Lorber Fusion. The song is a throwback to R&B; music of 1990s- a sonority that predominates the production of Yours Truly and the first single \\"The Way\\" in which Grande considered \\"Right There\\" as a sequel to - that uses heavy programmed snare drums, snaps and synthesizers as complement of its sound. In the lyrics, Grande expresses her passion to her love interest affirming that she will always be there for him with Sean responding to her affirmation while using several double entendres in a more sexual perspective. The song was released on August 6, 2013 as the third and final single from her debut studio album Yours Truly (2013). It was well received by music critics who praised its old-school production recalling the comparison to the music made by Mariah Carey in the 1990s. In the United States, the song reached a peak of at number 84 on the Billboard Hot 100, while achieving top ten positions on the Dance Club Songs and Rhythmic charts. The single was later certified gold in the United States by the RIAA for selling over 500,000 copies there. Likewise, the song reached a peak of number 15 on the UK R&B; Chart. Its accompanying music video was released on October 30, 2013, directed by the Young Astronauts team who added a concept inspired by William Shakespeare's work Romeo and Juliet. The video takes place at a Victorian era costume party in a mansion. Grande appears dressed as Juliet, while Patrick Schwarzenegger makes a cameo as Romeo. The video received positive commentaries by some publications. To promote the song, Grande performed for some radio stations across the United States including Los Angeles Power 106 and Capital XTRA, she also promoted it on the televised show, Jimmy Kimmel Live!. The song was included as part of her set list for her first headlining tour called The Listening Sessions (2013), The Honeymoon Tour (2015) and the Sweetener World Tour (2019). Background and composition The rapper Big Sean (pictured) appears as featuring artist in \\"Right There.\\" In his verses, Sean uses several double entendres about sexual attraction. \\"Right There\\" was written by Grande, Harmony Samuels, H. \\"Carmen Reece\\" Culver, J. \\"Lonny\\" Bereal, James \\"J-Doe\\" Smith, Al Sherrod Lambert, Jeff Lorber and Big Sean. Grande recorded her lines at the London Bridge's Studios in Los Angeles, California, while Sean's verse was recorded at Studios de la Reine in Paris, France. \\"Right There\\" samples the 1979 jazz instrumental song \\"Rain Dance\\" by The Jeff Lorber Fusion; it is the same sample that was used for the 1997 Lil' Kim song \\"Crush on You\\". Grande has referred to \\"Right There\\" as \\"sort of a sequel\\" to her first top-ten single \\"The Way\\" due to the songs' similarities in melody and composition. The singer spoke of the mutual interest she and rapper Big Sean felt in wanting to collaborate but mentioned that it took some time for them to find the right song. She said, \\"We were talking about a few other songs together but it just never worked out and it never was the right moment and then finally 'Right There' came along. And we were like 'Oh this is it'.\\" In production terms, \\"Right There\\" has a 1990s R&B; throwback style sound that is instrumentally supported by stabbing synths, trap-inflected programmed snare drums and a mid-tempo beat that runs trought a groove. Grande introduces the song using her higher vocal register while a distorted bass voice appears singing the hook while Grande harmonizes around. Sean then half-rapped his verse, \\"OK, this, this, this for my number one girl who got the top spot title/ Spent in the bathroom walked out looking like a model.\\" Grande later appears singing her first verse: \\"Boy you make me feel lucky/ Finally the stars align/ Never has it been so easy, tell me you love/ And to give you this heart of mine.\\" Its lyrics find Grande affirming that she will always being there for her love interest. Sean agree, reaffirming that he will be there for her too as Lucas Villa from AXS perceived. However, some critics noted sexual suggestions in Sean's verses. Entertainment Weeklys Nick Catucci commented that the rapper \\"slyly acknowledges Grande's chaste image in the song, crediting the \\"missionary\\" position for his player status.\\" Catucci noted Grande's innocence \\"isn't sacred, but the fact that she wears it as lightly as she does may be a small miracle.\\" Jason Lipshutz from Billboard wrote that while Sean \\"boasts about his sexual prowess,\\" Grande flaunts her typically \\"impressive melismas before ratcheting up the emotion for the finale.\\" Release and reception While the song was originally released as a promotional track available for immediate download with pre-orders of Yours Truly on iTunes, Grande stated in an interview that it evolved into a single on its own: \\"'Right There' is kind of about to be the next single. I think we're going to do a video for it soon. It's just because of what's naturally happened with 'Right There'. Radio's just sort of started picking it up and fans seem to really be responding to that one.\\" Jenna Rubenstein of MTV praised Grande's performance in the song writing \\"her breezy vocals and twinkling melisma lay perfectly over the swirling track.\\" Kevin Goddarg of the HotNewHipHop felt that \\"Right There\\" was a \\"fine addition to the growing\\" body of work that Grande had been developing since \\"stepping foot in the game.\\" Carl Williot of Idolator described \\"Right There\\" as \\"another bouncy pop-rap marriage\\" and further appreciated its retro feeling while commented that it is written in the vein of her Mac Miller collaboration \\"The Way\\". Williot added that Grande shows off her range once again, all with some \\"Mariah Carey-inspired runs and vocal melodies coming from all angles.\\" While Sean, cannels Wiz Khalifa \\"for a chilled out flow on this one, which is his latest foray into the world of young pop stars.\\" Ryan Reed from Rolling Stone also applauded Grande's performance comparing her vocals to that of Mariah Carey by stating that she sings \\"channeling the sweetness (and melodic content)\\" of Carey's 1995 song \\"Always Be My Baby\\" (from Carey's fifth studio album Daydream). Commercial performance In the United States, \\"Right There\\" debuted at its peak position of number 84 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart issued for August 24, 2013, giving Grande her fifth entry on the chart and Sean his eleventh. It left the chart the following week and returned at number 100 with contributions from the music video, released on October 20, 2013. The song spent eight weeks on the Hot 100 and placed in the top ten on other Billboard component charts including the Dance Club Songs and Rhythmic charts, peaking at number eight in both. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on July 30, 2014, for selling over 500,000 units in the United States. In the United Kingdom, although it failed to appear on the UK Singles Charts top 100 – it eventually reached number 112 – the song found success on the UK R&B; Chart, where it reached number 15. For the week ending August 24, 2013, \\"Right There\\" debuted at number 100 on the South Korean International Singles Chart, becoming Grande's first entry on the chart. Music video =Background and concept= Patrick Schwarzenegger (pictured) served as a guest in the music video, playing Grande's love interest (Romeo). The music video for the song was released on October 30, 2013. Two previews of the video were posted online on October 18, 2013. In the first preview, Grande wears a pink-colored dress, and appears in a Victorian-era inspired party. In the second preview, Grande published a photo showing Big Sean perched on an ornate chair. The concept of the video was inspired by William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. It takes place at a costume party in a mansion. Grande, dressed as Juliet, attracts the attention of another party-goer dressed as Romeo. The two navigate the party trying to find each other and finally meet and get together at the end of the video. The role of Grande's love interest is played by Patrick Schwarzenegger, the son of action film actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Grande's friend, 13 and Victorious co-star Elizabeth Gillies is also featured in the video. The video was also inspired by Baz Luhrmann's film Romeo + Juliet. During an interview with MTV News, the music video's director Nev Todorovic and producer Ally Pankiw of the Young Astronauts opened up to about the video aesthetic. Todorovic said that the references to Luhrmann's 1996 re-telling of the play was something that they had not originally intended on: > \\"The religious symbolism and the costume party are all from the original > Shakespearean play, but as we were planning the shoot, and especially on > set, we started seeing more of those similarities emerge. Like if you > notice, we had an Astronaut in the masquerade ball and everyone is comparing > it to Paul Rudd's character, but really it was an homage to our team The > Young Astronauts!\\" According to Todorovic, it was fitting for Big Sean to play the role of the narrator of the story and the priest in the Romeo and Juliet tale, especially \\"because of the religious imagery in his lyrics\\". He also explained the decision to put Big Sean's apparition as a priest, by stating: \\"And the moment he got in that throne, I was like 'Yes! This is perfect.' He got so comfortable, kicked his leg up, and I was like 'Stay there, yes, let's roll. If Kanye West is Yeezus, then Big Sean sure as hell makes a great priest!\\" =Synopsis= right The video begins with a rapid introduction with various different scenes that are going to appear later in the music video. A red screen is shown as the rapper Big Sean opens his Bible. Grande is then seen on a frilly Victorian bed with a pink-colored dress and a hand fan while her character (Juliet) is introduced through subtitles in the left side of the video. Scenes of the masquerade party are rapidly shown, Schwarzenegger and Sean are also presented as their respective characters (\\"Romeo\\" and \\"the Priest\\"). Sean removes his vestment and starts singing his verse sitting in a throne while Grande is shown doing her make-up and fixing her hair in front of a mirror accompanied by two female friends. Schwarzenegger is shown cruising with his friends with whom he plays with by using plastic guns. As the song progresses, Grande walks down own the long stairs of the mansion to where the party is taking place. Once there, she appears performing a sultry choreography using her hand fan among with the guests of the glamorous event. They are all wearing elegant, gala costumes and mascaras. Schwarzenegger arrives at the mansion with his friends. They jump over the gate as if it was closed and they appear to be late. He enters the masqueraded event and immediately finds Grande who admires him by smiling into his face. As she tries to approach him, some guests block her vision and when she looks again, he is no longer there. This is followed by a scene in which the couple meets again outside the noisy floor, Grande is now singing in a balcony while her partner is gently watching and smiling at her. Sean is shown again sitting in a throne performing his second verse, his part is intercepted with scenes of the people dancing in the party. As the last chorus is heard, the couple and all the guests from the party venture into a massive swimming pool for a late- night make-out session. Grande and her partner appeared kissing each other over while synchronized swimmers perform in the pool. The video ends with Sean closing the same bible that also introduced the video. =Critics reception= Jocelyn Vena of MTV News found an \\"old school\\" vibe similar to the song's sound and to that of Grande's previous released single \\"Baby I\\" which also draws from 1990s influences. Cena also claimed that the video for \\"Right There\\" does not stray too far from the events written by Shakespeare and this is the kind of \\"schmaltz that Luhrmann would appreciate.\\" Jason Lipshutz from Billboard considered the video as an understated tribute to the annual holiday Halloween – which started on October 31, a day following the video's release – for its modern-day \\"masquerade ball, complete with flowing gowns, wacky masks and Shakespearean nods.\\" The Los Angeles Timess Mikael Wood wrote that Grande puts her \\"well-established love of princess dresses to work\\" in the music video. Live performances In 2013, Grande performed an acoustic version of \\"Right There\\" for some radio stations during interviews and events such as POWER 106, Capital XTRA, SBTV Music, and Amp Radio Sound Space. She performed the single version on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, the 94.9's WiLD Jam at The SAP Center in San Jose, California on December 15, 2013, and at the 2014 Dick Clark's New Years Rockin' Eve in New York City's Times Square. In 2014, Grande performed an acoustic version at MTV's 'Artist To Watch', where she was joined by Tori Kelly for the performance. The single version was performed at the 2014 Wango Tango, the White House Easter Egg Roll 2014 (which she performed with Big Sean), select showcases in Tokyo, Japan, to promote the release of her debut album Yours Truly in the country, as well as at the 2014 iHeartRadio Ultimate Pool Party. Grande also performed the song as part of her headlining tour The Listening Sessions, during her opening concerts for Justin Bieber's Believe Tour, and the 2013 KIIS-FM Jingle Ball Tour. Grande performed the song in 2015 during The Honeymoon Tour as well. In 2018, Ariana performed an a cappella version of Right There during two of the shows on The Sweetener Sessions (which were the shows in Chicago and London).

Adapted from a French farce, the show featured dialogue that was condemned as indecent by many contemporary reviewers. The play's appearance on Broadway was suppressed when New York City officials threatened not to renew the operating license of the theater. Plot The story follows the misbehaviors of Regina (Valeska Suratt) as she passes whooping cough to the numerous men she kisses. In the final act, her amours land her in divorce court, where she performs a dance routine borrowed from Suratt's vaudeville act. Broadway production and suppression After early performances in Trenton, New Jersey, producer Al Woods brought the play to Broadway, with sultry vaudeville actress Valeska Suratt in the lead role. It opened at the New York Theatre on April 25, 1910. Trenton police had attended a rehearsal and declared the play fit for performance after some mild censorship, but when it came to New York, Mayor William Jay Gaynor viewed it less favorably. Hearing rumors about the play's content, he reviewed a script beforehand and found nothing objectionable in it. When the production went live, he received complaints that made him suspect he had not been given an accurate script. He decided to send stenographers to take notes on its content. They reported back that the actors had \\"interpolated\\" salacious elements into the performance. Based on this evidence, Gaynor asked New York City Police Commissioner William F. Baker to suppress the play. On May 6, 1910, Baker contacted the theater's management company, Klaw & Erlanger. He threatened that if the play was not stopped, he would refuse to renew the theater's operating license, which expired at the end of April. Abraham L. Erlanger promised to cancel the show, but Woods did not agree. After unsatisfactory meetings with Baker and Gaynor, Woods went to the New York Supreme Court on May 9, 1910, to get an injunction preventing the police from closing down the play. The judge gave Woods the order he requested, but while it prevented the authorities from interfering with the show directly, it did not compel them to renew the license for the theater. Left with no home for his production, Woods was forced to shut it down. Notwithstanding the objections from Woods, Gaynor's actions garnered a positive response from the press. A column in The New York Times said his actions were guided by \\"common sense and good taste\\". When the show headed to other cities, Gaynor threatened to write other mayors to warn them against it. Reception The play was \\"unmercifully damned by the critics\\", according to theater scholar Gerald Bordman. The Trenton True American described the performances there as \\"disgustingly vulgar\\". A brief review of the Broadway opening from The New York Times called it \\"stupid\\", although the reviewer found some humor in the performance of supporting player Dallas Welford. Drama critic George Jean Nathan called it \\"nauseating and ... disgusting in its futile efforts to be risqué\\". When the play went on the road after being shut down in New York, the Philadelphia Times declared it \\"coarse\\", \\"vulgar\\" and not worthy of any \\"self-respecting person\\".

Formed in 1995, the traditional incarnation of the band consists of vocalist Corbett Redford III and guitarist/vocalist Dan Abbott. The duo is often joined onstage and in the studio by numerous musicians and friends for full band stage performances and recordings. Early performances featured occasional backup vocals from John Geek, also singer for Fleshies. Both Abbott, Redford and Geek were founding members of the indie label S.P.A.M. Records, and co-organizers of Geekfest, a series of free all-ages music festivals held in the late 1990s, begun largely in response to the band's rejection from a then insular East Bay punk scene centered on 924 Gilman. Bobby Joe Ebola is known for its social criticism, using satirical lyrics to touch on controversial subjects, and performances that combine elements of punk rock and comedy. The duo employs complex harmonies and aggressive rhythms influenced by folk, pop-punk and rock'n'roll. The band cites as influences comedians Lenny Bruce and George Carlin as well as musical satirist Tom Lehrer and art-rock band They Might Be Giants. Between 1995 and 2000, the band toured the U.S. several times and released two full-length albums, one EP and a split 7\\" record with Pleasanton, California, band Your Mother, before breaking up in 2000. In 2009, the band reformed, and recorded an album, F, and an EP, Freaky Baby on Silver Sprocket Bicycle Club. In a rare effort by an independent band without major label funding, Bobby Joe Ebola set forth to film 13 music videos, one for every song on \\"F\\", most of which can currently be found on YouTube. The videos will culminate in a DVD called F: The Videos, set for release in 2012. The band released a 7\\" vinyl single for their song, \\"Bone Dagger\\" on Suckerpunch Records on September 4, 2012. The b-side of the single features Bobby Joe Ebola covering Judas Priest's \\"Take on the World\\". An animated music video created for the single by Mike Foxall of XRAY Studios was released on July 4, 2012. In December 2012, the band will be releasing a new full-length record entitled, Trainwreck to Narnia. The CD and digital versions of the album will be available on the Rooftop Comedy label. The 12\\" vinyl version will be released on Las Cruces' New Mexico label, Dirt Cult Records. Other upcoming releases slated for release in early 2013 include the Meal Deal with the Devil CD EP with accompanying read-along storybook illustrated by Jason Chandler of Horrible Comics, The Bobby Joe Ebola Songbook with \\"Blues Turn Brown/The Poor flexi-disc\\" featuring chords, lyrics and illustrations inspired by the songs of the band, the \\"Tashirojima\\" Vinyl 7\\" Single (all profits will benefit JEARS (Japanese Emergency Animal Rescue and Support)), the Bad Boys Gotta Rock It! (Live Recordings from 19952013) Double Cassette with digital download and The Mr. Sausage Brand Microwave Rock Opera Double CD/LP/Digital. History =Origins= Bobby Joe Ebola and the Children MacNuggits first formed in 1995, when Corbett Redford, in an attempt to impress a girl, lied that he had a band that could play in lieu of another band cancelling their performance at the girl's birthday party. The girl called his bluff and told him his band could perform at her party. Redford then called Abbott, who he had met when they were both attending Pinole Valley High School, and asked him if he would like to start a band. Abbott agreed and the band was formed. The band's unusual name came from a conversation between Abbott and Redford in the parking lot of the Pinole Burger King minutes before their first show. Abbott recalled in an interview that \\"1995 was the year Ebola killed 300 people in the Congo, so that was in our heads. I guess we [also] liked the juxtaposition between suburban America (including us) turning themselves into greasy breaded lumps, and the brutal (though natural) internal liquefaction that, at the time, seemed like the most extreme way to die. Plus we were stoned to tears\\". The band has frequently mentioned during interviews that the name \\"Bobby Joe\\" is a reference to the character from the movie Evil Dead II named Bobby Joe, portrayed by actress Kassie DePaiva. The band self-released its debut EP, Two Cats Running, in 1996, taking its cue for DIY music production from the East Bay punk scene. Two Cats was the first release on the label founded by Abbott, Redford, Geek and others, S.P.A.M. Records (\\"Smarmy Post-Angst Musicians\\"). The second S.P.A.M. Records release was a compilation entitled \\"If You Can't Laugh at Yourself, We'll Do It For You\\", featuring Bobby Joe Ebola and several other bands from West Contra Costa County. The band attempted to perform at 924 Gilman in nearby Berkeley, California, at that point the only all-ages venue in the East Bay. The band found it impossible to get a show at 924 Gilman, and or to secure advertising in Maximumrocknroll. Backup singer John Geek, spoke to then MRR coordinator Tim Yohannan, who explained that since Bobby Joe Ebola was not punk rock, MRR would not print advertising for the band. Faced with this rejection by the pillars of the local punk rock community, the band and their friends decided to organize their own show. Renting a generator and a P.A. system, the group threw a free, all-ages festival at a shoreline park at Point Molate Beach Park. The festival was the first of a series of such events called Geekfest, and became the nucleus of a new subculture in East Bay music. was held without proper permits and therefore illegal. =Geekfest and S.P.A.M. Records= S.P.A.M. (\\"Smarmy Post Angst Musicians\\") Records was an underground collective of East Bay artists and musicians which began in 1996 with the release of Bobby Joe Ebola and the Children MacNuggits' \\"Two Cats Running EP\\" and a CD compilation of local bands entitled \\"If You Can't Laugh at Yourself We'll Do It For You\\". Abbott, Redford and Geek were the label's founding members, and both Redford and Geek served as head coordinators for the organization. Bobby Joe Ebola was its flagship band, and the label primarily produced music projects from S.P.A.M. members and the loose-knit Geekfest community. Geekfest was a series of free, all-ages outdoor concerts organized by the S.P.A.M. Records collective beginning in 1997, largely in response to the difficulties of securing gigs for Bobby Joe Ebola and the Children MacNuggits and S.P.A.M.-affiliated bands. Due to a scarcity of all-ages venues in the San Francisco Bay Area, and the East Bay punk scene's identity crisis in the wake of mainstream commercial success by several formerly underground acts like Green Day and Rancid, the band found itself without places to play shows. Copying the tactics of the local underground rave scene, the first Geekfest events were held illegally at Point Molate Beach Park in Richmond, CA, part of a neglected Navy fuel depot beneath the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge. Shows were booked (and announced) via a voicemail connected to (510) BAD-SMUT on a first-come, first served basis, without regard to music genre or notoriety, or any official headlining bands. Thus, Geekfest became known for featuring an unpredictable variety of entertainment, and the undisclosed schedules meant that attendees had no idea when any particular act would play. As Geekfest became a semi-regular event with a culture all its own, its effects were felt on both Bobby Joe Ebola and on S.P.A.M. Records. The band, as the events coordinators, promoters, and hosts, networked and collaborated with touring bands and other show organizers, and nearly all S.P.A.M. releases were from veterans of Geekfest. In August 1998, the first Geekfest campout was held at Lake Lodoga, near central California's East Park Reservoir. Sometime later that year the S.P.A.M. collective met the Pyrate Punx, another group of show promoters, artists and musicians, who were primarily based out of the San Francisco Mission District's thriving punk scene. Recognizing shared values, if not always aesthetic ones, the two groups co-organized the second Geekfest campout, billed as Pyrates vs Geeks. In subsequent years it became known as Libertatia, an event which is still organized annually by the Pyrate Punx community. During this time, Bobby Joe Ebola was in the middle of a prolific songwriting and recording period. In 1997, the band released \\"Advice For Young Lovers\\" a split 7\\" record with Geekfest alumni Your Mother, and the 18-track \\"At One with the Dumb\\" CD (S.P.A.M.). Both S.P.A.M. Records and Geekfest were initially organized out of a place known as Hermosa Street House in Pinole, CA, where several S.P.A.M. members had spent their youth. The local blighted suburban surroundings and low-wage service-industry employment served as fodder for many of Bobby Joe Ebola's early songs. At around this time, the City of Richmond took notice of Geekfest and demanded that the events be covered by liability insurance which the collective members could not afford. Faced with an unsympathetic local press, and increasing opportunities for shows elsewhere, the S.P.A.M. collective moved to Oakland in 1998, renting out warehouse space at the Punx With Presses warehouse. =Initial breakup and hiatus= In 2000, Bobby Joe Ebola recorded and released ¡Carmelita Sings!: Visions of a Rock Apocalypse (S.P.A.M.), a 26-track album that was as eclectic as it was confrontational. The album, engineered by Mauricio Acevedo in Richmond, CA, was the band's first digitally recorded endeavor and featured songs recorded both as the traditional two piece duo and with their full band ensemble. During this time, the band could sense that an implosion was near. Dan and Corbett were poor from studio and touring costs, exhausted, and struggling to run Geekfest and S.P.A.M. Records. The band had stopped being fun for them, and Bobby Joe Ebola and the Children MacNuggits called it quits. After the breakup of the band, Corbett remained as the head coordinator of S.P.A.M. Records, vowing to show what he felt to be the real side of Bay Area alternative music. Many cult favorite Bay Area bands would get their start on S.P.A.M. Records, notably Hunx & His Punx frontman Hunx's previous electropop band Gravy Train!!!!, the high energy garage rock band Rock n Roll Adventure Kids, manic thrash punk band Tommy Lasorda and \\"Junkyard Rock\\" twee band The Blast Rocks!!!. In 2002, S.P.A.M. released a re-issue of San Francisco punk band Hickey (band)'s Various States of Disrepair CD. Corbett maintained S.P.A.M. Records until its demise, when both the label and Geekfest ceased to exist. Dan started work on a rock opera, Day of the Zombie. He also collaborated with former Bob Weirdos bandmate and present That Damned Band! frontman Dylan McPuke in the all monster jug band, Thee HoboGobbelins. Though broken up, Dan and Corbett remained friends, and on more than one occasion (mostly at friends' request or for benefit shows) they would re-unite for one- off shows. Dan and Corbett also starred together in the independent film, Neptune, directed by filmmaker Anthony Marchitiello, alongside former back-up vocalist John Geek. In 2006, Corbett started a punk rock band called the Neverending Party, which released a split 7\\" on Thrillhouse Records with The Reaction as well as a self-titled 7\\" single on Freedom School Records. =Reunion= In 2009, Abbott and Redford began developing a pilot for an animated version of their unreleased rock opera, A Sausage Named Clarence. As they were working on the script, they were asked to play a reunion show for the Mystic Knights of the Cobra. Soon after, they decided to reunite as a band. Plans quickly developed for the band to tour and record when Bobby Joe Ebola was approached by Silver Sprocket Bicycle Club to release a record on their label. The band agreed to a non-exclusive arrangement. The group then recorded their first digital EP, Freaky Baby, for release on Silver Sprocket as a four-song teaser to their upcoming full-length album, F. Freaky Baby was the first rap song recorded by the band and became the subject of the band's first-ever music video. The group started playing numerous shows around the Bay Area as their original two piece lineup. During these shows, the band started to showcase a large batch of new songs they had been written. These songs were eventually recorded and released on \\"F\\", their first full-length album in over a decade. Tinged with psychedelic rock, dark folk, and twee elements, F was heralded a bold, more mature direction for the group. The songs retained the group's trademark wit, but the tone and content of the songs was noticeably darker and almost melancholic. The band embarked on four- month longs tours and five two-week local & regional tours of the United States in support of F, doing one tour featuring a full band lineup. One of the regional tours in particular saw Bobby Joe Ebola playing with Mike Dirnt of Green Day's reunited side-project band, The Frustrators. The band also traveled to play a show in London, England in support of the album. Music videos For their first music video, the band chose the single from the EP of the same name, Freaky Baby. The video featured dancing by the acclaimed bicycle dance troupe, The Bay Area Derailluers. The band had so much fun creating the video, they soon announced they would be filming one music video for each of the thirteen songs on their F LP, with plans for a DVD version of the album to be released. As of September 2012, the band has released 11 videos for songs on F on their YouTube channel. The range of production values and styles for the videos vary widely. The band has worked with several different directors including Jamie DeWolf, Christopher Poeschl, Janelle Hessig, Melissa Dale, Alex Koll and others to create music videos that involve short horror films, fake infomercials, Claymation, cartoon animation and more. The band has worked with each director to develop elaborate plots, costuming, stories and themes. The videos have featured the work and participation of hundreds of cast, crew members and directors. The band crowd sourced to raise funds to create one of the videos, Life Is Excellent. An animated music video was created by artist Mike Foxall of XRAY Studios for the band's song Bone Dagger and was released on July 4, 2012. Musical style and influences Bobby Joe Ebola has described their band's sound as \\"pretty songs about awful things\\". Musically, they often deviate from their signature \\"satiric folk rock\\" sound to incorporate other styles, among them ska, punk rock, polka, dark folk, classic rock and even hip hop. The band has stated that their tendency to jump musical genres has to do with involving satire in their songs as well as letting the song's sound arrive organically if the lyrics \\"ask\\" the band to play the song in a certain style, the band abides. Abbott and Redford often sing in harmony with one another and alternate taking lead vocal duties. When playing live, the group often mixes social commentary and comedy in between songs. The band acknowledges The Hope Bombs, a self-proclaimed \\"geeky\\" punk rock band featuring future S.P.A.M. alumni and Bobby Joe Ebola studio musician Ben Morss and former Bobby Joe Ebola bassist Robert Eggplant from Blatz (band) as a musical inspiration. The group is also inspired by satiric songwriter Tom Lehrer, the strange rock icon Frank Zappa, the eclectic alternative band They Might Be Giants and many of the punk bands from the Bay Area's early 1990s punk-rock boom.

Background  Mitchell Kutney was born in Burlington, Ontario and completed his undergraduate degree in Psychology at the University of Ottawa and his Masters in Public Policy and Administration at Carleton University. Career Kutney has been referenced as an \\"esteemed social sector thinker,\\" particularly in the domain of philanthropy, Social media, millennial giving and charity. He began his career by spearheading an immigrant youth program in partnership with the University of Ottawa and the City of Ottawa known as Youth Futures. This was a successful program, and was subsequently recognized by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) to serve as a potential best-practice for Ontario. After completing his Masters, Kutney co-founded JustChange Inc., a network of donors who support local, community-based projects. As of 2018, Kutney currently works for Bruyère Continuing Care.  Blogging  Kutney is a blogger and progressive pundit. In 2014, Kutney criticized provincial attempts by the New Democratic Party to impose artificial limits on executive compensation within the charitable sector, stating, \\"compensation should be based on what the job entails, the level of difficulty, and what qualifications you need, not some arcane notion about the morality of the sector in which the leaders are situated.\\" No limits have been imposed to date. He has also defended the importance of \\"the personal touch\\" in engaging young people in politics. Kutney's work has led to interviews with The Globe and Mail and Ottawa Citizen on the future of sustainable business models, and how social business can contribute to making the city a more fun and exciting place to live. He was also the first blogger to reveal Visa's smallenfreuden viral campaign in Toronto.

Description and metabolism Cells are psychrophilic, irregular, slightly halophilic and non-motile coccoids (diameter 1.2 to 2.5 μm). They require salt to grow. They prefer low temperatures: their optimal temperature is 15 °C, and they cannot grow at 18 °C–20 °C. They reduce carbon dioxide with hydrogen to produce methane, but it may be possible that they use other substrates as well. One experiment showed that these cells grow best in the presence of yeast extract. Genome The genome of this species differs from those of archaea that prefer higher temperatures. It contains more polar amino acids, particularly Gln and Thr, and fewer non-polar ones, particularly Leu. Unlike hyperthermophiles, in psychrophiles, the GC content is the most important factor to the stability of the tRNA.  References  Further reading Garrett, Roger A., and Hans-Peter Klenk, eds.

Although it ostensibly has the spectrum of a G-type star, it differs markedly from most in that it has almost no hydrogen and much carbon. Discovery RY Sgr light curve Colonel Ernest Elliott Markwick first came across what became known as RY Sagittarii during searches for variable stars while posted in Gibraltar. He recorded it dimming from magnitude 7 in July 1893 to fainter than 11 by 23 October that year, and brightening to magnitude 6.4 by November 1894. Edward Charles Pickering wrote that it was a \\"remarkable object\\", and \\"nearly got away\\". The spectrum was first noted to be peculiar at the time, and by 1953 it was classified as a R Coronae Borealis variable, along with a handful of other stars. Mystified by its origins, Danziger postulated possible explanations as forming from a helium cloud, an aged star that had exhausted its hydrogen, or a star that had somehow thrown off its hydrogen envelope, though noted there was no evidence of such an envelope. He conceded that knowledge of star evolution was not advanced enough to come up with an explanation. Variability It is one of the three brightest R Coronae Borealis stars visible to Earth observers, along with R Coronae Borealis and V854 Centauri, and the brightest in the southern hemisphere. It is also a pulsating variable, with a semiregular period of 38 days. Its light curve has been studied for over a hundred years and is typical for the class, characterised by a sudden drop in brightness of several magnitudes over a few weeks before gradually brightening over the following several months. The timing between these dimmings is irregular. The cause of the drop in magnitude is the presence of dust clouds of carbon obscuring (and most likely ejected from) the star, though the mechanism how this might occur is not known. Extensive clouds have been detected with ESO's Very Large Telescope Interferometer. Properties The star is so remote that its parallax, distance and hence luminosity were impossible to calculate with any accuracy.

He was a vocal critic of Nazism and used his sermons to condemn Nazi propaganda and other aspects of Nazism which drew suspicion on him from the authorities who monitored him and even interrogated him on occasion. He was a staunch supporter of the role of adolescents in the life of the Church and made them a focus in his pastoral activities. In his imprisonment he became a member of the Schoenstatt Movement. Hirschfelder's beatification drew intense support after the priest died and 10 000 signatures were put to a petition in a request for his beatification; the formal cause began in the late 1990s and he became titled as a Servant of God. The beatification was celebrated on 19 September 2010 in Münster with Cardinal Joachim Meisner celebrating on the behalf of Pope Benedict XVI. Life A Gerhard Hirschfelder memorial plaque. Gerhard Hirschfelder was born on 17 February 1907 as an illegitimate child to the unmarried Maria Hirschfelder. He received his baptism on 19 February from Father Bertmanna in the Assumption parish. He attended high school at the Glatz school (where he graduated in 1926)) and then underwent his theological and philosophical studies at the University of Wrocław. But his time there was often tarnished with the knowledge that he was an illegitimate child and he was sometimes ridiculed for that. Hirschfelder received his elevation into the diaconate on 29 December 1931 in the Wrocław Cathedral from Cardinal Adolf Bertram. He received his ordination to the priesthood on 31 January 1932 from Cardinal Bertram. He celebrated his first Mass on 1 February 1932 in the church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in Długopole-Zdrój. He first served as a chaplain in a small parish until February 1939 when he was transferred to the Habelschwerdt parish. In July 1939 he was called to Glatz to work with adolescents and became a popular pastor and dominated his activism on the children and teenagers because he believed them to be the future of the Church. His grave in Czermna (Silesia) He worked with adolescents and discouraged them from joining the Hitler Youth movement and from being influenced from all the Nazi propaganda circulated at the time. He criticized Nazism in his sermons and was denounced as a result of this. In late July 1941 he condemned the destruction of Christian images and said: \\"He who tears from the heart of young people their faith in Christ is a criminal\\" and for this was arrested within a week on 1 August when he was taken to the Glatz prison. It was there at that prison that he wrote an intense and deep memoranda on the Via Crucis and a series on the Pauline letters as well as on the priesthood and marriage. He was sent straight to the Dachau concentration camp in mid-December 1941 (without a trial) where he received the prisoner number 28927; he arrived there on 27 December. While in Dachau he became a member of the Schoenstatt Movement. Hirschfelder was imprisoned in block 26/3 alongside the Oblate of Mary Immaculate priest Engelbert Rehling who said he was \\"almost timid\\" in his disposition as well as being quite humble. Hirschfelder died on 1 August 1942 due to starvation coupled with acute pneumonia he had contracted. His remains were cremated and buried some weeks later though recovered; his official cause of death was never disclosed. His grave is located on the cemetery in Czermna (Silesia) in Poland. Beatification There were 10 000 signatures collected asking officials in Münster and Rome to begin the cause for beatification. The beatification process opened in the Münster diocese in a diocesan process from 18 September 1998 until its closure in March 1999 though the formal introduction to the cause came under Pope John Paul II on 19 December 1998 once the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the \\"nihil obstat\\" and titled Hirschfelder as a Servant of God. The C.C.S. later validated this process on 15 October 1999 and received the Positio in 2002. Theologians approved the cause on 2 October 2009 as did the C.C.S. on 9 February 2010. Pope Benedict XVI approved that Hirschfelder died \\"in odium fidei\\" (in hatred of the faith) on 27 March 2010 and thus approved the beatification. Cardinal Joachim Meisner presided over the beatification on the pope's behalf in the Münster Cathedral on 19 September 2010 with about 4000 people in attendance. The previous week on 13 September saw the pope reference the late priest to the German ambassador at Castel Gandolfo as one of hundreds of priests killed in concentration camps during World War II. Archbishop Erwin Josef Ender attended the beatification as did Dominik Duka and Bishop Felix Genn of Münster. Meisner said in his remarks that Hirschfelder placed his trust in \\"the power of faith\\". The current postulator for the cause is Dr. Andrea Ambrosi.

Born in Strafford, Vermont, Baxter was the son of Portus Baxter and Ellen Janette Harris. He received his medical degree from the University of Vermont in 1860, completed his internship and residency at Bellevue and Blackwell's Island Hospitals in New York City, and enlisted in the Union Army for the American Civil War. Assigned initially as surgeon of the 12th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, he later became a brigade surgeon, commanded Campbell General Hospital in Washington, D.C., and then served as Chief Medical Officer of the Provost Marshal's Bureau. Baxter took part in the Peninsula Campaign, including the Battles of Yorktown, Hanover Court House, and Seven Pines, and attained the rank of major, in addition to receiving brevet promotions to lieutenant colonel and colonel of Volunteers, and a brevet as a colonel in the regular Army. After the war, Baxter remained in the Army as a member of the newly-organized Medical Department, and was appointed Assistant Medical Purveyor with the rank of lieutenant colonel. In 1872, he was appointed Chief Medical Purveyor, and in 1874 he received promotion to colonel. In 1875, Baxter graduated from Columbian University (now George Washington University Law School) with an LL.B. degree. Baxter's duties as Chief Medical Purveyor included serving as personal physician to the President of the United States, and he attended James A. Garfield's family. Baxter was out of town when Charles J. Guiteau shot Garfield in July 1881, and was not able to examine Garfield following the shooting. Garfield's other physicians prevented Baxter from seeing Garfield, which generated controversy both immediately after the shooting and after Garfield's death several weeks later. In August 1890, Baxter was named the Army's Surgeon General and promoted to brigadier general. He soon afterwards became ill with uremia, which caused him to suffer a stroke.

According to contemporary accounts, Bliss stated that Baxter was attempting to see Garfield out of a desire for personal glory and fame, a charge which had the effect of causing Baxter to minimize his involvement so that Bliss would not seem to be correct.Rutkow, James A. Garfield, page 93 In fact Bliss had only recently been readmitted to the District of Columbia Medical Society, which had expelled him in 1870 over his advocacy for African American doctors to be admitted. In addition, he had been expelled over willingness to consult with homeopaths at a time when most medical professionals were allopaths and disdained homeopathy. Having been readmitted to the Society so recently, Bliss likely maintained his lead role in Garfield's treatment as a way to restore his own reputation.Gloria Moldow, Women Doctors in Gilded-age Washington: Race, Gender, and Professionalization, page 98Candice Millard, Destiny of the Republic: A Tale of Madness, Medicine and the Murder of a President, 2012, page 163New York Homeopathic Medical Society, Documents of the New York Homeopathic Medical Society, Volume 5, 1872, page 926 Army Surgeon General In August 1890, Baxter was named the Army's Surgeon General and promoted to brigadier general, appointed by President Benjamin Harrison, who was a longtime patient.

Gen. (CSA) Jubal A. Early's (under whom McCausland served) Valley Campaigns of '64 were part of a strategy to save the Confederate breadbasket for the provision of the Army of Northern Virginia from the barn burners Maj. Gen. (USA) \\"Black Dave\\" David Hunter and, later, General (USA) Philip Sheridan and to menace Washington, D.C. as part of the larger strategy of Gen. (CSA) Robert E. Lee and Gen. (CSA) Joseph E. Johnston for the outnumbered and out-resourced Confederate States Army to break the Northern populations resolve for war and force the Union to peace parlay by bringing the horror of battle to Northern soil while bogging down advancing Union Army troops. This strategy was near successful but for Jefferson Davis' improvident decision to replace Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, who was prudent with his charge of his troops lives, with the reckless John Bell Hood. Abraham Lincoln himself did not believe that he had any chance of being reelected in the Presidential election of 1864 on his pro war ticket against opponent reconciliation or \\"truce\\" and \\"peace candidate\\" relieved General of the Army (United States) George B. McClellan, until the last moments when Major general (USA) William Tecumseh Sherman, taking advantage of Hood's earlier precipitous troop movements, to Northern public adulation breached the western Confederate defensive line at the Battle of Atlanta. The shot and its follow on McCausland's forces were blocked at Old Town, Maryland at the Potomac River between Hancock, Maryland and Springfield, West Virginia by Union Army foot troops and, also, a Union Army iron clad armored train containing both other well shielded Federal troops in its troop cars and a gunnery car, itself, containing a 12 lbs Howitzer, while also pursued by superior Federal forces from the rear. McNulty brought his horse drawn light cannon to high ground within 200 yards of the iron clad. From this vantage and under a shower of Union bullets, he directed the fire of a first cannon shot which breached and exploded the train's boiler. In the ensuing commotion, Federal troops scattered from within and without the train. Lt. McNulty then directed the fire of a second shot, astoundingly, from the same 200 yards distant, precisely through one of the Howitzer car's armaments open defensive musket portals, disabling this Howitzer weapon and causing the train's last Federal troops to evacuate the gunnery car. Quickly pursued by the Confederates, the frontal Union troops, thereafter, negotiated their own surrender and parole (withdrawal from the combat), and McCausland's forces returned to the relative safety of West Virginia, thereafter, without further incident.Scott C. Patchan Shenandoah Summer: The 1864 Valley Campaign (2009) University of Nebraska Press pp. 287-289 Prologue Later, during the disastrous October 9, 1864 engagement of the Battle of Tom's Brook, Tom's Brook, Virginia, it was Lt. McNulty, who first saved and, then, more effectively repositioned the Confederate guns to high ground when Maj. Gen. (CSA) Thomas Rosser's Laurel Brigade (whom the Baltimore Light Artillery were supporting) broke and ran. It was also Lt. McNulty who, even later, in aftermath of the battle, with his 2 surviving gun teams and guns, in retirement, while evading Brevet Brigadier Thomas Devin and the entirety of his Federal 6th New Yorkers who were in pursuit determined to capture the guns, managed to save one of the two remaining Confederate artillery pieces by strategically abandoning the other in the after battle chase.Gary W.

After World War I, the field was used for artillery shooting exercises. Aviation activities resumed in 1933, led by the newly formed Limburg Aviation Club. During World War II the field was used as a decoy airfield by German occupiers. After the war, there were several attempts to restart flying activities.

He also established contact with forced labourers, and learned the Polish language in order to assist in his ministry work with them. Aged 30, in 1941, Prassek met Karl Friedrich Stellbrink, a pastor at the nearby Lutheran Church. They shared disapproval of the Nazi regime, and Prassek introduced Stellbrink to his Catholic colleagues, Frs Hermann Lange and Eduard Mueller. The four priests spoke publicly against the Nazis – initially discreetly – distributing pamphlets to friends and congregants.Beatification Of WWII Martyrs Divides Lutherans, Catholics; Huffington Post; By Omar Sacirbey; 20/6/2011 They copied and distributed the anti-Nazi sermons of Bishop Clemens August von Galen of Münster. Then, following the 28 March 1942 RAF air raid, after which Stellbrink tended wounded, he delivered a Palm Sunday sermon which attributed the bombing to divine punishment. Stellbrink was arrested, followed by the three Catholic priests. Prassek had been denounced by a Gestapo informer. Arrested in May 1942, he was sentenced to death by the People's Court in June 1943, in the \\"Lübeck Christians’ Trial\\", and executed on 10 November 1943 in Hamburg, alongside the other priests. Resigned to martyrdom, Prassek wrote to his family: \\"Who can oppress one who dies\\". The mingling of the blood of the four guillotined martyrs has become a symbol of German Ecumenism.

It caused the most damage at Puerto BarriosAmbraseys and Adams, p. 198. in Izabal Department, Guatemala, and Puerto Cortes, Honduras, and it killed two people and measured between 6.4 and 6.7 surface wave magnitude. The quake was felt throughout Honduras, Belize, and parts of Guatemala. Damage was recorded at the port town of Livingston and extended to northwestern Puerto Rico; this damage is poorly recorded. The earthquake severed communications with rural hill and coastal villages in Honduras, and it frightened thousands of people into leaving their homes. Early reports listed only one fatality; a man from San Pedro Sula suffered a heart attack from the tremor's initial rupture. In Puerto Cortes, 75 homes, a hotel, a Texaco refinery, and a then-United Brands rail line all at least partially collapsed, the homes all fully. As a result, three people were injured by downed walls and ceilings. In Puerto Barrios, two homes collapsed. Belize City, to the north, experienced the shaking but reported no damage. The earthquake did not extend to Tegucigalpa, Honduras' capital, or Guatemala's capital, Guatemala City.  Geology  The earthquake's epicenter lay in the Gulf of Honduras, just offshore. Honduras lies just off the triple-junction of the North American, Cocos, and Caribbean tectonic plates to the north. On the other sides it is surrounded by transform faults and trenches created by the movement of these plates.Kiremidjian, Sutch, and Shah, p. 4. The most seismic activity occurs along the plate boundary between Caribbean and Cocos in a N–E trending Benioff zone, split into two sections, one with a shallow dip, the other with a far more steep decline.Kiremidjian, Sutch, and Shah, p. 6. The plates are converging by subduction, Cocos under the Caribbean, at a rate of to annually.Kiremidjian, Sutch, and Shah, p. 7. Within Honduras, there are at least three other major faults–La Ceiba, Guyape, and Aguan–apparently unrelated to plate movement.Kiremidjian, Sutch, and Shah, p. 17.

When built over the Bear River, it was the highest railway bridge in the state. The bridge was built by the Nevada County Narrow Gauge Railroad, under the management of Sarah Kidder. From the surface of the water, at an average stage, up to the track was . The total length was about , and at the time of construction there were no approaches, the opposite banks being abrupt. The pier foundations were built of reinforced concrete, requiring more than 500 cubic yards. The piers and superstructure were of structural steel, of which about 500 tons were used. All the steel material was furnished by the American Bridge Company of San Francisco, and the constructing contractors were Shattuck & Edinger Construction Company, also of San Francisco. The total cost of the bridge was approximately US$70,000. The engineering involved much difficulty—principally due to the unusual height of the structure. At the beginning of the work the contractors stretched a 2.25 inch diameter steel cable from bank to bank more than above the Bear River, and long. By means of this cable all of the structural steel material required, as well as the concrete, were hoisted and conveyed by a trolley to the required point and lowered to the proper position. It took about six months to complete construction. Only a small force of men were employed and the work necessarily progressed rather slowly. The bridge was on a long cut- off which shortens the road , and also eliminated two long wooden bridges, each high, and one tunnel. The bridge was taken down to make way for a dam in 1963.

He was chairman of the LoRa Alliance from its creation in 2015 until 2018, was previously founder and Chairman of the IPSO Alliance, is a consultant on the Internet of Things, and in 2013, was appointed a Presidential Innovation Fellow.  Life  Raised in Palo Alto, California, Mulligan attended Henry M. Gunn High School. He graduated from the United States Air Force Academy in 1979 with a bachelor's degree in computer science and a Master Of Science (M.S.) from the University of Denver.  Career  While in the Air Force, he worked on the ARPAnet. The ARPAnet evolved into the Defense Data Network, where he worked on security and performance and also designed and directed installation of the Pentagon data networks that used cable TV technology. Mulligan returned to the Air Force Academy, where he oversaw the design and installation of the Academy's local area network, FALCONnet. In 1990, Mulligan joined Digital Equipment Corporation in Palo Alto. He focused on network security, electronic mail, TCP/IP networking, networking tools and firewall technology. He worked on the DEC SEAL firewall, and on the IPv6 protocol working group. Mulligan began working at Sun Microsystems in 1992. He developed and maintained the Solaris TCP/IP utilities and kernel. He also worked on Sun's wide area network and firewall complex. He continued with the IPv6 design team and wrote a PC-based implementation, called N6AFV, along with a packet decoder, and worked on the development of an IPv4/IPv6 border gateway. He was the principal architect of Sun's firewall product, Sunscreen SPF 100. Mulligan further developed Sunscreen, adding network address translation, an internal Java interpreter and topology hiding technologies. In 1997, he created HZ.COM, an electronic mail information retrieval system for two-way pagers and early cellular phones. When the HZ.COM domain was hijacked in 2002, the incident was featured in the International Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) Security and Stability Advisory Committee's report of 2005. He took a sabbatical from Sun to start USA.net, one of the first e-mail outsourcing providers. He left Sun to co-found Geocast Network Systems, where he was responsible for operating system design and support, as well as network architecture for the evolving Internet multicast communication technology that the company was developing. Following Geocast, Mulligan co-founded Interosa as chief technology officer and, subsequently, chief executive. Interosa was building a new policy-based privacy technology for digital content and an email privacy system that was based on their new technology. The company was shut down in November 2000. In 2001, Mulligan was hired by Invensys as the chief scientist for the Home Controls Division, where he worked on resource and energy management technology, including home gateway design and development, web-based tools, and low-power, low-speed, low-cost wireless networks such as the IEEE 802.15 standards marketed with the Zigbee trademark. Invensys worked on a project to put wireless IPv6 communications in smoke alarms and appliances. He was one of the founding board members of the Zigbee Alliance and was co-chair of the 6LoWPAN Working Group in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). He was instrumental in the design of the IPv6 protocol and created and named 6LoWPAN. In 2006, he started the firm Proto6, consulting for companies and the US Department of Defense. Mulligan worked with others to launch the Internet Protocol for Smart Objects (IPSO) Alliance in 2008. In June 2013, Mulligan became one of the second round of Presidential Innovation Fellows, working at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and was co-creator of the White House's SmartAmerica Challenge. He is currently serving as the US representative to the ISO Strategic Advisory Group on Smart and Sustainable Cities and is also currently serving as the Chairman of the LoRa Alliance and on the Board of Directors for the IPSO Alliance.  Works  Mulligan holds over 15 patents in computer security, networking and electronic mail. In 1999 he wrote Removing the Spam: Email Processing and Filtering. The book explains the operation and management of two widely distributed Unix e-mail tools: Sendmail and Procmail.  Congressional testimony  In 1997, Mulligan testified before Congress on electronic commerce and computer security. The Committee on Science held a briefing on Secure Communications in February, the second in a series of briefings on computer security. The theme of the briefing was the need to protect the confidential nature of private communications and to ensure that stored proprietary data remains uncompromised. He spoke on \\"Security Through Containment\\", and explained how networks are designed and built to facilitate the sharing and distribution of data and information, while the goal of security is to limit and control the distribution of information. One method for providing both connectivity and security is through the use of containment.

History Gillett was reportedly a family-friendly community and included several churches. The nearby mines contributed to the boom of the town. From 1895 to 1896, Gillett hosted a professional minor league baseball team that participated in the Colorado State League. In 1895, the only bullfight held in the US took place in Gillett. 50,000 people, some of them celebrities from the US and Mexico, attended. The bulls and bullfighters traveled to Gillett from Mexico; the trip possibly caused the bulls to become over tired and irritable. The bullfight soon turned into a riot. After the riot was quelled, the bulls were taken to slaughter, and their meat was given to the poor. During the first decade of the 1900s, the town began a slow decline and was completely or mostly abandoned by the 1940s. On June 16, 1965, a flash flood that delivered 14 inches of rain to the area between Pueblo and Denver flooded a small abandoned community dam above the valley where the town stood. The resulting flood washed away most of the town's ruins. The only remnants of the city are small parts of a church's walls (in the 1940s, only the roof had collapsed), located in what is now a hayfield to the west of the highway; the jail, located beside a few abandoned residential houses at a road bend; and a couple of fire hydrants. Gillett also has a small airstrip that runs parallel with highway 67. Soldiers stationed at nearby Fort Carson (Colorado Springs) used to land and subsequently conduct high altitude survival training from there. Oddly enough, during the time when cattle mutilations were the most prolific in the southwest and near the Cripple Creek area in 1976, a motorist managed to take a picture of an unmarked helicopter (unmarked helicopters were often seen before and after the mutilations) close to the Gillett airstrip.

The case brought into question if a unique feature, such as a voice, can distinguish someone and thus must be authorized for impersonation. Background Ford Motor created an ad campaign that specifically was meant to inspire nostalgic sentiments through the use of famous songs from the 1970s sung by their original artists. When the original artists refused to accept, impersonators were used to sing the original songs for the commercials. Midler was asked to sing a famous song of hers for the commercial and refused. Subsequently, the company hired a voice-impersonator of Midler and carried on with using the song for the commercial, since it had been approved by the copyright-holder. Midler's image and likeness were not used in the commercial but many claimed the voice used sounded impeccably like Midler's. Midler backstage at the Grammy Awards, February 1990.

The district court claimed there was no legal principle preventing the use of her voice and granted summary judgment to Ford Motor. Midler appealed to the Appellate court, 9th Circuit. Case Midler pursued a common law judgment against Ford for using her distinctive voice which she had never authorized. The appellate court pondered the question of whether or not an artist's voice is a distinctive personal feature which a person has controlling rights from appropriation over. Midler was not seeking damages for copyright infringement of the song itself, but rather for the use of her voice which she claimed was distinctive of her person as a singer. The recognition of Midler's voice in the commercial was found to be the intentional motivation and a major feature of the commercial. Decision The appellate court ruled that the voice of someone famous as a singer is distinctive to their person and image and therefore, as a part of their identity, it is unlawful to imitate their voice without express consent and approval. The appellate court reversed the district courts decision and ruled in favor of Midler, indicating her voice was protected against unauthorized use. Significance A voice, or other distinctive uncopyrightable features, is deemed as part of someone's identity who is famous for that feature and is thus controllable against unauthorized use. Impersonation of a voice, or similarly distinctive feature, must be granted permission by the original artist for a public impersonation, even for copyrighted materials.

As a result, their population is now close to 20,000, classifying them as Near Threatened and making them the only species of rhinoceros that is not endangered. Bull was born in South Africa and was eventually moved to North America, where he lived in the San Diego Wild Animal Park and Toronto Zoo until his death in 2008. He can now be seen in the Schad Gallery of Biodiversity in the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) in Toronto as part of the museum's collection of Iconic Objects.Eger, “The gentle giant; after a lifetime of showing us why extinction matters, Bull the white rhino finds the perfect resting ground, ROM Magazine, June 22, 2009  Early life  Bull was born in the wild in South Africa, and for this reason, his age can only be estimated. However, after undergoing a series of examinations, specialists were able to estimate his age to be around 9–10 years at the time of his capture, so his birth year was recorded to be 1963. Although white rhinos are protected in South Africa, Bull and many others were taken into captivity under a breeding program in order to ensure the survival of the species should an unexpected disaster befall the main population. At the time of the rhino’s capture, he was named “Mtondo”, which translates from Zulu as a term for male reproductive organs.  San Diego Wild Animal Park  Shortly after his capture, Mtondo was moved to different locations across North America, where he was studied as part of a conservation effort. His first North American home was the San Diego Wild Animal Park Zoo. He remained at this location until 1974, when he was transferred to the Toronto Zoo in Ontario, Canada.  Toronto Zoo  Following his time in the San Diego Wild Animal Park, the rhino spent the remainder of his life in the Toronto Zoo, with Ron Gilmore acting as his keeper. Upon arriving at the Toronto Zoo, Mtondo’s name was officially changed to “Bull”. Although unconfirmed, it is believed that this was due to the sexual nature of the previous name, which was deemed unfitting. Throughout his life, Bull was found to be gentle towards humans and would approach the front of his enclosure, allowing zoo visitors to pet him. He became especially close with his keeper, Gilmore, and would respond to the sound of his voice. On two separate occasions, faults were discovered in Bull's enclosure, but instead of fleeing, the rhino could be calmly called over by his keeper. Around other rhinos, however, Bull was often aggressive. He was known to hit other rhinos with his horns if provoked. = Daily routine = Bull was fed three meals a day, eating 5-10 lbs of hay at breakfast and lunch and 30 lbs of hay at dinner along with 15-20 lbs of compressed grains, vegetables and vitamins. He would occasionally enjoy treats such as apples, pears and sweet oats with bran and molasses. Living in a colder Canadian climate meant that Bull’s daily activities varied with the seasons. During the warm summer months, he would be showered after breakfast, something he greatly enjoyed, and would then proceed to the exhibit area of his enclosure either on his own or in the company of a number of female rhinos. During colder weather, if Bull were to proceed outside, he wouldn't be showered, as this would have lowered his body temperature too significantly. Once temperatures began to fall below freezing, Bull was to remain indoors. Although he was given plastic balls to play with, he often slept more during the winter. = Children = During his time at the Toronto Zoo, Bull sired three children. The first was a female, Shaboola, in 1979. She remained in the Toronto Zoo, but was kept in a separate enclosure from her father to prevent interbreeding. The second was Abeeku, a male, in 1985, who was sent to live in Germany. The last was another male in 1990, Atu, who was sold to a game park in Hemmingford, Quebec.  Death  Although Bull never suffered any major illnesses throughout his life, he became severely arthritic in 2008. At this point, he began having difficulties supporting his own weight while standing. After a long life of 45 years, he was euthanized in February.Royal Ontario Museum, \\"02. “Bull” The Southern White Rhino” \\", 2013  Royal Ontario Museum  Following Bull's death, the Toronto Zoo contacted the ROM as to enquire into whether the museum was interested in taking on the rhino as an exhibit. At this time, the Schad Gallery of Biodiversity was in need of a Life in Crisis centrepiece. After museum staff assessed transportation options to determine that it was physically possible to transport the rhino into the second-floor gallery and obtained a grant from the Louise Hawley Stone Charitable Trust, they accepted Bull into their collection. = Taxidermy process = Once in possession of Bull, the ROM contacted Len Murphy of Pine Ridge Taxidermy in Baltimore, Maryland to have him stuffed. Bull was then shipped to the facility via flatbed truck.Martin, “White Rhino in the Room”, 2009 Under Murphy's care, Bull's outer skin was removed and re-cast with a mould. As Murphy had been to the Toronto Zoo to study Bull during his lifetime, he was able to recreate the animal's exact features and wrinkles. The entire taxidermy process took over a year to completed and involved several steps. This began with the removal of the hide, which was then cured with salt and drained. It was then shaved with a double-handed knife, re-salted and hung to dry. At this point, the hide weighed 700 lbs and was sent to soak in a 50-gallon drum of formic acid before being shaven once more to reach a thickness of only 1/16 inches. It was then placed in formic acid once more and then oiled. The final weight of the hide was 53 lbs. Several layers of artificial materials were then used to fill the hide. First, a Styrofoam core was construct and coated in papier-mâché, to increase its size. Modelling clay was used to shape Bull’s muscles. His horns, which grew to be quite large due to his age, were too damaged to use, so fibreglass recreations were constructed. = Display = The completed rhino was officially revealed at the ROM in May 2009 at a special gala in his honour. Here, he became one of the museum’s first Iconic Objects and can still be found in the Schad Gallery of Biodiversity. While his bones were separated from the hide during the taxidermy process, they are also kept under the ROM's care and are now part of the museum's skeleton collection.

Early in his career, he painted frescoes, including one depicting Zeus in Olympus, for the Esterhazy Palace in Vienna. He developed an anachronistic style that imitated quattrocento painters, learned in part from his activity restoring such works. He is described by 1836 by the contemporary Luigi Mussini as having begun to paint Madonnas weakly imitated after the neo-purism of the (pre-Raphaelite) Germans such as Overbeck and his associates.History of Modern Italian Art, by Ashton Rollins Willard, page 670. Among his frescoes are those depicting: Sacred and Profane Music, Poetry, and a Choir of Putti (1852) in a salon of the house of count Guicciardini and in the Palazzo Martelli in Florence. He painted the frescoes of the Life of St Anne for the chapel dei Giuntini in San Giuseppe.

Lucian Smith was the original inventor in 1867 and held patent rights for it, while Glidden made changes to it in 1874 that he believed were novel enough to merit a new invention and thus new patent. Background Patent drawing for Glidden's Improvement Lucien B. Smith had first invented a basic form of barbed wire in 1867 and received the patent for it. Therefore, at the time he had exclusive rights to produce and sell his product. In 1874, after Glidden made his changes, he was issued a statement denying him a new patent on the grounds that his invention simply was not a novelty. His patent claim was for: :\\"a twisted fence wire having the transverse spur wire, D, bent at its middle portion about one of the wire strands, a, of said fence wire, and clamped in position and place by the other wire strand, z, twisted upon its fellow, substantially as specified.\\" The Patenting and Trademark office denied his application believing that the process was already widely known common knowledge and not novel enough to be distinguished from earlier patents. After Glidden's patent application had been denied, he appealed to the decision and eventually the case went before the Supreme Court. Case Early handmade specimen of Glidden's \\"The Winner\\" on display at the Barbed Wire History Museum in DeKalb, Illinois. In the eyes of the court, the question of most importance was whether or not the invention of Glidden was sufficient in novelty. To answer this they considered for some length process for producing barbed wire prior to this invention and compared it to Glidden's design. Glidden claimed that his process of adding an extra wire to stabilize the barbs without any other means made them sufficiently stronger and more efficient. However, he apparently did not make this clear until his initial patent application was denied and he had applied for reissue. Therefore, the court ignored this feature at first. Glidden stated: :\\"I do not claim to have originated the devices known as 'spurs' or 'prongs' on the wires, they having been used before, but confine myself to the means for holding the spurs at proper intervals on the wires and to the means for attaining a uniform tension of the wires, as claimed.\\" The court remarked that a new device phasing out an older version does not necessarily merit the awarding of a new patent, but it may merit consideration. The court took into account that Glidden's invention had widely replaced older versions and was now commonly in use. The defense attempted to show that others had made the same design independently before Glidden, but the plaintiff was able to assert that indeed the other productions, which were of virtually similar design, were not made until after he issued his patent. The court agreed that there had been plenty of other attempts to create a similar design and product as Glidden, but none had been successful nor had they been successfully patented. Decision The circuit court finally decided to reverse the decision of the lower court and ruled in favor of the plaintiff, Joseph Glidden. The majority of the court was convinced that Glidden's invention proved to have enough novelty and technological change to merit the patent and thus exclusive rights to produce and sell the improved barbed wire without the need for licensing. Much of this decision came from the court's inclination to grant a patent to the final step in turning an invention into a useful or more useful product. Dissent Justice Field was the sole dissenting opinion who disagreed with the decision on the grounds that he believed there was no true novelty to Glidden's decision and thus lacked sufficient reasoning to receive a patent. Significance This case largely established precedent for future patent law, specifically in questions of first-to-file, or scope of novelty. The first-to-file aspect was largely supported in that whichever party can prove they filed an invention first will have a greater claim over other manufacturers and better their chances of receiving a patent. Secondly, the scope of novelty was determined to not be some significant change, but simply enough to make a noticeable positive difference. Also success of a minor innovation is for grounds for patenting in light of the numerous failed or discontinued minor innovations pursued. Glidden held sole rights to sell the product and thus established the Barb Fence Company, in Dekalb, Illinois. The invention made him extremely wealthy and by the time of his death he was one of the richest men in the United States.

Both works by Metzinger had been on view in the Carroll Galleries exhibition. The acquisition was preceded by a lively correspondence between Quinn, the gallery manager Harriet Bryant, and the artist's brother Maurice Metzinger. In 1927 an exhibition and sale of Quinn's art collection took place in New York City. The sale was conducted by Otto Bernet and Hiram H. Parke at the American Art Galleries.

Guggenheim Foundation, Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice, Jean Metzinger, At the Cycle‐Race Track From 9 June to 16 September 2012 the painting was the subject of an exhibition in Venice entitled Cycling, Cubo‐Futurism and the 4th Dimension. Jean Metzinger’s \\"At the Cycle‐Race Track\\". Description Cycles J.B. Louvet, Poster Tour de France, 1912, Collection Ivan Bonduelle Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec publicity poster from circa 1890s, Constant Huret riding with a Simpson chain behind the Gladiator tandem pacer at the Velodrome de la Seine At the Cycle-Race Track (Au Vélodrome), is an oil, sand and collage on canvas, painted in a vertical format with dimensions 130.4 × 97.1 cm (51 3/8 × 38 1/4 in), signed JMetzinger towards the lower left. In the foreground a road bicycle racer is shown in various degrees of transparency that give way to elements of the background, blurring the distinction between distances near and far. The cyclists head, for example, is almost entirely transparent, the audience composed of mosaic-like cubes is visible through the head, neck and arm, an effect reminiscent of the artists Divisionist period. Metzinger's bicycle shimmers between the unique and the multiple, as if the two merge into one. The scene represents an extant photo-finish, a series of frames captured during the final sprint at the end of a race. The presence of the other bicyclist is revealed by the rear wheel to the left of the canvas. Metzinger's painting appears to show the handlebars in two positions,Cubism and Australian Art, Lesley Harding, Sue Cramer - 2009 but the handlebars along with sections of the bicycle frame are actually superimposed as a transparency (over the left hand, left foot of the cyclist and over the drive-wheel), representing two consecutive frames, one subtracted from the other, i.e., the road is visible 'through' the racer where the bicycle had been a fraction of a second earlier, as if to show motion through absence. With this type of game playing with contradictory visual codes (positive and negative space), Metzinger discerns the past and the present infinitesimally separated in time; while the perception of the future is left to the intellectual discretion of the observer to contemplate. Cubist and Futurist devices appear superimposed in Metzinger's At the Cycle-Race Track, creating an image that is readable yet essentially anti-naturalistic. Cubist elements include the reduction of the geometric schema to simplified shapes, and the juxtaposition of rotating planes to define spatial qualities, printed-paper collage, the incorporation of a granular surface and multiple perspective. Parallels with Futurism include the choice of a subject in motion (the bicyclist), the suggestion of velocity (motion blur on the wheel spokes), and the fusing of forms in a static picture plane. Metzingers's work integrates the idea of an aesthetic generated by the modern myth of the machine and speed.The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice At the Cycle‐Race Track illustrates the final yards of the Paris–Roubaix race, and portrays Charles Crupelandt, the 1912 winner, according to the art historian Erasmus Weddigen. The race is known for its extreme difficulty and danger of cycling over the narrow cobblestone roads of northern France. The Paris–Roubaix has since been referred to as the Hell of the North (L'enfer du Nord), and A Sunday in Hell. Metzinger’s painting was the first in Modernist art to represent a specific sporting event and its champion. He incorporated into the painting his concepts of multiple perspective, simultaneity, and time, according to his belief that the fourth dimension was crucial to the new art that could compete with the classical French tradition. Metzinger's words > We would often cross the broad avenue with the martial sounding name... The > one that separated Courbevoie from Puteaux.

Archive for November, 2012 2012 exhibition In 2012, one hundred years after it was painted, Metzinger's Au Vélodrome was showcased in an exhibition entitled Cycling, Cubo‐Futurism and the 4th Dimension. Jean Metzinger’s \\"At the Cycle‐Race Track\\", at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice, Italy. The painting is one of the pivotal Cubist works at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection. The exhibition, curated by Erasmus Weddigen, brought together two other paintings and a drawing by Metzinger treating the same theme, in addition to several other paintings on the theme of cycling. Just as Metzinger’s painting, the show combines a passion for the sport of cycle‐racing with an investigation into the nature of the Fourth dimension in art; a topic much discussed in Metzinger’s immediate circle and alluded to in the number 4 visible in the stadium grandstand in the upper left quadrant of the painting. Vintage racing bikes at the exhibition included one owned by Albert Einstein. The theoretical and sporting themes of the show were designed to illustrate theories of space and time formulated by Einstein and multiple perspective developed independently by the Cubists, and most notably by Metzinger, as early as 1910.Jean Metzinger, October–November 1910, \\"Note sur la peinture\\" Pan: 60 Other versions * Jean Metzinger, Study for At the Cycle-Race Track (Etude pour Au Vèlodrome), 1911, graphite and charcoal on beige paper, 38 x 26 cm, inscribed JMetzinger 1911.

It was first convened in 2008 by Parvez Imroz, Angana P. Chatterji, Gautam Navlakha and Zaheer-Ud-Din. Chatterji served as convener until December 2012.  Background  The Tribunal was first envisioned in 2006 when Parvez Imroz, a human rights activist, invited Angana Chatterji to Kashmir. From 2006–2008, Chatterji studied the Kashmir issue and interviewed the locals. Mallika Kaur, a scholar of Harvard Kennedy School, while explaining the need of the Tribunal, said that there was no such mechanism for investigating the human right abuses in this hypermilitarized region. The Tribunal's mandate does not include finding political solutions to resolve the Kashmir issue. Instead it includes recording and investigating crimes committed only in the part of Kashmir administered by India. According to Mallika Kaur the Tribunal did not include the Pakistani-administered Kashmir because it was set up by Indian citizens and access across the heavily guarded border is not possible. The Tribunal was also mandated to investigate how the violations of human rights by the militants intersect with those security forces.  Findings  In December 2009 the International People's Tribunal released a report titled Buried Evidence. The Tribunal alleges that the insurgency from 1989–2009 has caused more than 70,000 deaths. According to Angana P. Chatterji, the convener of the Tribunal, they investigated fifty killings by the Indian Security Forces; except one all were declared militant. Of those who were killed in these incidents 39 were Muslims, four were Hindus and rest were of undetermined religious background. The Tribunal found that only one of those killed was a militant and the rest were killed in staged encounters. She further stresses the need of an independent inquiry into forced disappearances and fake encounters, which according to her may result in some correlation of 8000 disappearances with the bodies in unmarked graves. The Tribunal found 2700 (about 3000) unknown and unmarked graves having 2900 bodies in three districts of Jammu and Kashmir. A gravedigger in a statement to the Tribunal said that he witnessed the burials of 203 people killed extrajudicially between 2002–2006. The Tribunal has criticized the United Nations and its members for failing to stop the fallout of the India's militarization in the valley. In December 2012 IPTK along with Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons released a report Alleged Perpetrators – Stories of Impunity in Jammu and Kashmir, which alleged involvement of about 500 Indian Armed Forces officials in human rights abuses in Kashmir. Those accused included three Brigadier rank officers of Indian Army. The access to the official record available with the police along with interviewing the affected families helped in preparing the report, which took over two years to get completed. The report that alleges that the perpetrators of crimes in Kashmir are decorated instead of prosecuted, analysed 214 cases of abuse and further mentions 8,000 forced disappearances and 70 killings.  Activities  In 2008 the Tribunal officials came under attack in the valley allegedly from Indian security forces. Besides spying and harassment of the tribunal, grenades were hurled at Parvez Imroz's residence in Kashmir on 30 June. The tribunal in a memorandum submitted to the government said that the use of landmines by the Indian Security Forces in the valley imperils the lives of civilian population. In June 2010 the tribunal presented its finding to the British Parliamentary Group on Kashmir (APPG-K). The IPTK in November 2010 presented a memorandum along with other human rights organizations. The memorandum asked the US President Barack Obama as well as the international community to play their part in settling the Kashmir dispute that has been lingering on for six decades. Moreover, it asked Obama to raise the issue of Kashmir with Indian premier Manmohan Singh and to not jeopardize this issue on the cost of improving relations with India.  Reception  The local people of the Kashmir valley including the Hindu pandits welcomed the Tribunal and offered their help even when they were threatened. The people according to Imroz were content that this issue is being taken up internationally. The European Parliament supported the Tribunal by inviting them to testify before Parliament's Subcommittee on Human Rights at Brussels and adopting a resolution on allegations of mass graves. in 2008.

Predominantly brown in colour, it is found in dry and wet sclerophyll forest in December and January and is quite common in Brisbane. Taxonomy The razor grinder was first described in 1838 by Félix Édouard Guérin-Méneville as Cicada eydouxii before being moved to the new genus Henicopsaltria in 1866. It is the type species. Its common name refers to its harsh call, which has been likened to the noise of a metal grinder. Description head detail The razor grinder is a large cicada with a forewing measuring . Males and females are similar in color and markings. The head and thorax is red-brown with black markings. The wings are transparent with some brown discoloration. The male's call lasts for a few seconds, increases in volume, suddenly stops, and then suddenly starts again. They usually silently feed throughout the afternoon, and then groups call at maximum volume around dusk. There is a secondary population, referred to as the laughing razor grinder, which is only observed in rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest, and has a distinct call. Razor grinders can also emit a distress call – a fragmented irregular noise – upon being seized by a predator.Moulds, p. 22. Behaviour A razor grinder drying its wings after shedding its shell Male razor grinders sing in large groups on the main trunks of tall eucalypts, especially spotted gum (Corymbia maculata). In some years their numbers can be locally immense, but in other years very few adults emerge. Adult razor grinders are wary and flighty, especially at dusk, and are difficult to approach. They are fast flyers. Distribution and habitat The razor grinder is found along the east coast of Australia from Gladstone in Central Queensland south to Narooma in southern New South Wales, generally below elevation. It reaches inland to Toowoomba, Inverell, Tamworth and the Capertee Valley. It is common in Brisbane, but uncommon in Sydney. There is also an isolated population in Cathu State Forest. Their habitat is dry or wet sclerophyll forest or rainforest margins. They are most visible in December and January, sometimes appearing in early November in some years.

Established in 1839 by the Maine Legislature as the Bangor Female Orphan Asylum,Bangor Daily News, October 4, 1989 it served the community in that role until 1975, after which its facilities were converted into the Hilltop School and day-care center. Its main building, constructed in 1869, is one of the state's earliest examples of Stick style architecture, and an important early work of the architect Henry W. Hartwell, later of Hartwell and Richardson. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Description and history The former Bangor Children's Home is located northwest of downtown Bangor, high on the east side of Thomas Hill, just below Summit Park. It is a three story brick building, set on a granite foundation. It has a dormered mansard roof, which provides for a full third story. The dormers are gabled, with most housing one or two sash windows, although there is one with a Palladian window arrangement. All have applied Stick style elements at the gable ends. The main floors are separated by a projecting belt course of brick. The upper level windows are set in segmented-arch openings, with flanking brickwork bracketed framing. The main entrance is sheltered by an elaborate porte-cochere with a shallow-pitch pyramidal roof. The Bangor Female Orphan Asylum was established in 1839 by an act of the state legislature, and was supported by the efforts of the local Union Female Education Society, founded in 1835. Originally housed in quarters in 4th Street, the present building was constructed in 1869, with funding support from a bequest by Franklin Pitcher. It was designed by Henry W. Hartwell, then early in his career, and is believed to be one of the first examples of the state of Stick style decoration. The land was donated by James Smith, Jr., and an adjoining parcel was donated by Samuel Prentiss in 1914, for use as a playground. At Pitcher's demand, the facility's purpose was broadened to include boys, and the organization was rechartered and renamed in 1866 as the Bangor Children's Home. By the 1970s, funding and treatment models had changed, and the boarding services were no longer needed. the building houses the Hilltop School, a preschool and day-care center.

Adults perch almost exclusively on ghost gums. William Lucas Distant described the northern double drummer in 1892, but incorrectly gave the type locality as Sydney. Description Specimen in the Australian Museum The northern double drummer is a large species of cicada, the second largest in Australia, just smaller than the largest species, the double drummer. The male and female average 4.56 cm long. The thorax is 1.85 cm in diameter. The eyes are light brown tinged with purple, and the postclypeus dark red-brown. The head is variable in colour, but never black like the double drummer. The thorax is brown with lighter golden-brown markings. The mesonotum is brown tinged with purple. The underside of the thorax is red- brown and covered in fine silvery velvety hairs. The abdomen is dark brown, with the first and second segments above and underside covered with grey hairs, and also a whitish pregenital band of hair. The wings are vitreous (transparent) with light brown veins. The legs are brown and have fine grey velvety hairs. Adult cicadas emerge from September and can be seen until the end of April, though are most abundant in December and January. Distribution The northern double drummer is found from Gladstone in southeast Queensland north to Cape York and Mount Isa, and across eastern and northern Northern Territory and into northern Western Australia, across the Kimberley and Broome to Mundiwindi. It is found on eucalyptus trees, particularly smooth-barked species such as the ghost gum (Corymbia aparrerinja) in Central Australia.

Plot  Cate McCall is a lawyer, an alcoholic in recovery and on probation, and estranged from her family. In order to regain custody of her young daughter and be reinstated to the bar, she accepts the pro bono appeal of a woman, Lacey, who has been convicted of murder. Aided by her assistant, Cate pulls out all stops to prove Lacey's innocence, as well as work on her own alcohol and work addictions. Cate becomes obsessed with the case, neglecting arranged time with her daughter while she successfully gets Lacey's conviction overturned. When Cate finds out that Lacey is guilty, she starts drinking again, causing her to further neglect her daughter. Cate returns to her old job at a high-profile law firm, and purposefully torpedoes her own client's case in the middle of a trial. Cate then takes multiple illegal actions to put Lacey back in prison. Cate gives evidence to the prosecutor who can convict Lacey, then conspires with the prosecutor; the two of them agree to keep it a secret so that she won't be disbarred, which would deny him the ability to use the evidence that he should not have. Cate does not recuse herself from Lacey's trial - though she does blackmail the original judge, who previously ruled in Lacey's favour, to recuse himself. The prosecutor, exercising prosecutorial misconduct, does not recuse himself from the case either. Cate's overt acts of fraud, conspiracy, blackmail and misconduct enable her to get Lacey re-convicted. Cate's reward for her illegal actions is to be granted shared custody of her daughter.

In 2000, he co-founded \\"Sutia Gonodhorshon Pratibad Mancha\\", an organisation which protested against a local criminal gang, who were using gang-rape to terrorise the people of Sutia. Biswas was murdered on 5 July 2012. In 2013, a Bengali film Proloy was made, based on his life and fight.  Life and career  Biswas was born on 12 September 1972 in Sutia, North 24 Parganas district, West Bengal. His parents, Gita Biswas and Jagadish Biswas, migrated from Faridpur, Bangladesh after the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War to Acharipara, Panchpota, in North 24 Parganas. His father worked as a labourer during the day and sang for a local theatre group at night to pay for his children's education. Barun Biswas attended Panchpota Bharadanga High School. He completed his schooling at Gobardanga Khantura High School. He received his B.A. in Bengali from Gobardanga Hindu College, his master's degree from Calcutta University, and his BEd from B.T. College, New Barrackpore. After his education, Biswas passed the West Bengal School Service exam, and chose a career in social work and education. In 1998, he started his career as a school teacher at Mitra Institution (Main) of Kolkata, where he worked till his death. He was also an active member of Panchpota Sashadanga Sarada Seba Sangha.  Activism  = Ichhamati river and water = In 2000, Biswas started a campaign for the construction of a canal to check flooding of the Ichamati and Jamuna rivers. The rivers were causing widespread flooding in Sutia, Bongaon, Swarupnagar, and Gaighata. Biswas drew up a blueprint for the canal. Though initially his plan met with little enthusiasm from local leaders, the government later built the canal. Later, he was involved in the fight against gangs who were illegally blocking and diverting the Ichamati river for their businesses, causing floods in the village area. = 2000—2012: Anti-rape activism = Sutia and neighbouring villages were engulfed by a criminal gang during the late 1990s and early 2000s. From 2000—2002, 33 rapes (official figure, actual figure may have been much more) and around a dozen murders were committed in Sutia. Biswas formed a group of villagers to fight crime and to demand arrests. In 2000, at age 28, he co-founded \\"Sutia Gonodhorshon Pratibad Mancha\\". The organisation started to hold public meetings to protest the rapes. During such a meeting, Biswas said: Biswas' group helped rape victims give reports to the police that led to arrests of the gang members, including the leader of the gangs, Sushanta Choudhury. Biswas also counselled the raped women.  Death  At 7:20 pm on 5 July 2012, when returning from Kolkata, Biswas was shot from behind in a parking lot outside the Gobardanga railway station. Subsequently, police from Habra, Gaighata, and Gopal Nagar arrested five men with ties to the Sutia gang.

The alleged assassin reportedly confessed to the police that he was contracted by gang leader Sushanta Choudhury, who was serving life imprisonment in Dum Dum Central Jail.  Legacy  In 2011 a teleserial named Proloy Asche was launched by Sananda TV loosely based on the life of Barun Biswas. In August 2013, a Bengali film called Proloy was made on the life of Biswas. Actor Parambrata Chatterjee portrayed the role of Barun Biswas. In the 2013 Durga Puja, Panchpota Avijan Sangha Durga Puja Committee used Biswas' life and struggle as their puja's festive theme. They also named their puja platform Barun Mancha (Barun platform). Manobendra Biswas, joint secretary of the puja committee told— > Barun's mamabari (maternal house) was in Sutia Panchpota and he had spent > his childhood here. When Sutia was virtually ruled by rapists and criminals, > he started a movement to help villagers fight the reign of terror through > Sutia Pratibadi Mancha... Durga Puja marks the victory of Durga over > Mahishasura and Barun's fight epitomizes the victory of good over evil.

P. Sreekumar and Meghana Raj. The film is produced by P. K. Muralidharan and Santha Murali under the banner of Anantha Visions.Memories - Malayalam Movie The film follows Sam Alex (Prithviraj), a drunkard cop, who is forced to investigate a series of murders. The movie was remade in Tamil in 2016 as Aarathu Sinam.https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/Border- crossings/article14431814.ece/amp/ Plot Sam Alex (Prithviraj Sukumaran) is a police officer who is heavily dependent on alcoholism to ease the pain of his family loss. Sam was a romantic and peaceful family guy, leading a good life with his family. His loving wife Teena (Meghana Raj) and beloved daughter were murdered by his enemy right in front of his eyes, and as a result, he turns into an alcoholic. Sam's supervisor Aravindhaksha Menon (Vijayaraghavan) requests him to proceed with a parallel investigation in a case involving the disappearance and possible kidnapping of several young married men, since the present police team is not able to make any progress in the case. Sam refuses to this. Later, his mother Marykutty (Vanitha Krishnachandran) requests him to take up the investigation. Sam soon gets into the case files and consults the postmortem documents and the doctors who conducted it. Soon, Sam is seen making a breakthrough in the case. Another two kidnappings happen in the series, and all this leads to Sam's rough conclusion of the killer. The killer is an eccentric person, has a limp in his feet, and either hates or loves women. The killer leaves certain clues inscribed by a sharp surgical knife on the chest of the victims. This serves Sam's thinking of what kind of person the killer is and who is his next target. Upon careful examination of the words inscribed in the body of the victims, Sam uncovers that the words are actually Aramaic, the language Jesus used for communication. The words are later found to point to biblical proverbs, thus helping Sam lead to conclusions that the killer is insane and assumed the victims gave up their lives for the sins committed by their respective wives. He soon figures out that the wives of the kidnapped husbands have links, and they all had to do with a guy who studied with them certain years back. There was no evidence of such a person. During all these scenes, Sam realizes that there is one last target and the killer will not miss this and he will disappear after that. He eventually finds out that the next target is his own brother Sanju (Rahul Madhav), and his brother's wife is the last link in the connection. Sam finds out with the help of his colleague and other evidence that the killer has a property near Kottayam. He goes there for one last confrontation. After killing the murderer, he gives up drinking and adopts the daughter of the murderer's sister and marries Varsha, a journalist who was involved in helping in the case. He finally moves on.

History =Early days= As a boy he was a car maniac who loved motor sports. He saw the Prince cars being completely defeated at the 1st Japanese Grand Prix held at Suzuka Circuit in 1963. In March 1967, one month before he joined Nissan, he went to Europe to watch a Formula 1 race.SEIBIDO MOOK \\"Japan's Memorable Car - Skyline GT-R, from PGC10 to R33\\" July 10, 1997, SEIBIDO SHUPPAN CO., LTD. (Japanese) He wanted to join Brabham or another F1 car manufacturer. In Japan, he wanted to join the Prince Motor Company which produced the R380 racing car. =Joined Nissan= He joined Nissan in April 1967 and was assigned to the Prince Division, which had recently been merged into Nissan in August 1966, located in Ogikubo, Tokyo, as he hoped.The Designer's Emotion Over the Skyline - Kozo Watanabe Interview Nissan Official Website (Japanese) The main building was the former Nakajima Aircraft Company's Tokyo Plant facility. He was assigned to Design Group No. 2 of the Design Department No. 1 headed by two managers. One of them was Shinichiro Sakurai, the other was Ushio Fuyuki.『「プリンス」荻窪の思い出 II』荻友会編 私家版 1997年11月16日 \\"Prince - Memories of Ogikubo\\" Private press by Tekiyukai (former Prince engineers)Association, Nov. 16, 1997 (Japanese) One of Sakurai's subordinates Naganori Itō held direct responsibility over Watanabe. Itō who would later take over Sakurai's responsibilities.Sakura Mook 21 \\"The Legend of the Mighty Skyline GT-R\\" July 10, 1997, KASAKURA PUBLISHING Co., Ltd. (Japanese) Itō instructed Watanabe and allowed him to design some parts of C10 Skyline GT-R's suspension. One day, Watanabe said to Sakurai that he would like to design a racing car. Sakurai said, \\"Come on. No way. You must learn about the production cars first. It's impossible for you to design a racing car now.\\" But gradually, Itō allowed him to design some parts of the suspension of the racing cars such as R381 and R382. =Collision safety (Experimental Safety Vehicle Division)= In 1970, he was assigned to the ESV (Experimental Safety Vehicle) Division in Tsurumi, Yokohama to research collision safety. =Return to Ogikubo= In 1973, he was once again assigned to the Chassis Department in Ogikubo, a department to which Itō had been promoted to manager. As a result of many engineers being assigned to the vehicle emissions control project, Itō and Watanabe were one of few people who designed or improved the chassis of the former Prince vehicles such as the later version of Skyline C110, Pulsar and Nissan Prince Homer truck. (On the other hand, genuine Nissan vehicles were designed at Nissan Tsurumi Design Center in Yokohama.) One thing he can never forget during his Ogikubo days is that he had a chance to repair the Nissan Prince Royal limousine. After he repaired it and sent it back to the Imperial Household Agency, he was presented a pack of Imperial Gift Cigarettes with the Chrysanthemum Seal printed on them. =Assigned to plan the strategies= In 1985, he was assigned to the Strategy Department of Nissan headquarters. At this time, he wrote the \\"screen play\\" for each of the Nissan cars. For example, the character and image of the cars. He also discussed which cars should be exported and which cars should be sold domestically. =Assigned as the Chief Experiment Engineer of R32= In 1985, he was assigned to the Vehicle Experiment Department. He tested N13 Pulsar, and its variants Exa, Langley and Liberta Villa. In 1987, he was sent to Nissan Tochigi Plant in Kaminokawa, Tochigi to test the R32 Skyline under the command of Itō, the chief engineer. He tested the R32 carefully and with insistence. He collected the data and provided them to Itō. He brought an R32 to the Nürburgring, Germany with his test team. The event marked the completion of the R32, paving the way to its début. =Chief engineer of R33= Just after the R33 Skyline project started, he was assigned as the chief engineer of R33. Nissan headquarters told him to make the R33 wider and longer than the R32 to improve passenger comfort. Consequently, the R33 would be heavier than the R32, but Watanabe was aiming to produce a faster car having declared that \\"R33 GT-R has to be faster than R32 GT-R\\". In particular, he carefully designed the suspension. When the a BCNR33 GT-R was taken to the Nürburgring to be tested, the lap time finally became twenty one seconds shorter than that of BNR32 GT-R. Consequently, the slogan \\"Minus 21 Seconds Romanticism\\" was used for the television advertisements. =R34 - the last straight-6 Skyline= He was again assigned as the chief engineer of the next (tenth) generation R34 Skyline. One of their long-time concerns was weight distribution. Watanabe once tried to abandon the heavy RB engine and tried to use a lighter V6 engine. But it was cancelled because it would cost too much to change the layout of the vehicle. So he continued to use straight-six engine. Although in late 1990s and early 2000s, the GT car and the sports car were not popular in Japan, Watanabe and his team completed the R34 as the ultimate Skyline. Furthermore, the BNR34 GT-R is the last \\"Skyline GT-R\\" so far. (Nissan separated the GT-R from the Skyline line-up.) =Recent years= In 1999, he was promoted to the Executive Director of NISMO and supervised the entire Nissan motor sports project. Whenever NISMO sold the Z-tune R34 Skylines to the customers at the NISMO headquarters, Watanabe was present to congratulate the new owners.Z-tune Information - NISMO official website (Japanese) He retired from NISMO in 2006. He is currently the advisor of the Prince & Skyline Museum in Okaya, Nagano. He often appears at the Skyline festivals or the Skyline talk shows with Itō.Prince & Skyline Museum Official Website (Japanese) Incidentally, the fifth generation C210 Skyline is the only Skyline which he was not involved in until he being assigned as the Executive Director of NISMO in 1999.

Due to a passage in Tacitus,Annales, XII.1 a number of scholars have argued that Lollius was a suffect consul, possibly even in AD 13. However, Ronald Syme pointed out that Lollius could never have been consul due to the disgrace of his father in 2 BC, which resulted in a prolonged antipathy towards him by Tiberius. \\"When requesting the Senate to honor Sulpicius Quirinius with a public funeral,\\" Syme writes, \\"and recounting his merits and his loyalty, the Princeps was put in mind of the Rhodian years and could not suppress harsh words about Lollius.\\"Syme, The Augustan Aristocracy (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1986), p. 177 Syme proposes an emendation that would make the passage refer to the elder Lollius, not this one. Providing a definite solution is the findings of Diana Gorostidi Pi, who completed the list of consuls for this year and showed there is no room for Lollius here.Pi, \\"Sui consoli dell’anno 13 d.C.: Nuovi dati dai fasti consulares Tusculani\\", Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 189 (2014), pg 265–275 Family Background Lollius was a member of the plebeian gens Lollia.Lollia Gens article at ancient library He was the son of the Roman senator and Military Officer Marcus LolliusMarcus Lollius’ article at Livius.org and his wife Aurelia.Syme, Augustan Aristocracy, p. 178 Ronald Syme identifies Aurelia as \\"a sister of the postulated and unattested Aurelius Cotta who adopted the younger son of Messalla Corvinus\\". Lollius was the namesake of his father and paternal grandfather. Publius Lollius Maximus may have been his brother, or at least a close relation.Harrison, Homage to Horace: A Bimillenary Celebration, p. 290 Career Little is known on the life of Lollius. The Horrea Lolliana was either built by his father or Lollius himself.Rickman, Roman Granaries and Store Buildings, p. 164 It is known from the inscriptions refer to them and also, from their plan in the Severan Marble Plan of Rome. It seems his family had long trade connections and his family’s name is found among the Italian merchants on the Greek island of Delos in the Hellenistic period. Wife and issue Lollius married a Roman noblewoman called Volusia Saturnina, a daughter to the consul Lucius Volusius Saturninus and his wife Nonia Polla.Syme, Augustan Aristocracy, p. 56 Her paternal grandmother was Claudia, aunt of the emperor Tiberius. Through Volusia, Lollius was the father of two daughters: * Lollia Saturnina * Lollia Paulina, third wife of Caligula.
