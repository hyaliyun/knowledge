Impey's third popular science book for Norton was published as a hardcover in 2015. Summary Beyond: Our Future in Space is a non-fiction book by astronomy professor Chris Impey on the history and future of human exploration of space. The book starts with a discussion of the human urge to explore, which led us to fan out over the Earth soon after leaving Africa. This urge may have a gene associated with it. This is followed by a recounting of the Space Race of the middle of the 20th century, driven by fierce superpower rivalry between the United States and the former Soviet Union. Early milestones in the history of space travel are summarized, along with the feats and tribulations of human (and animal) space explorers. The \\"club\\" of those who have been in Earth orbit is still very select, less than 550, compared to ten times more people who have stood on the summit of Mount Everest. The second section of the book considered the recent doldrums of NASA, where the United States has been unable to launch an astronaut into orbit for over five years. Then it moves to the exciting new opportunities being opened up by the private space companies. Space entrepreneurs are taking risks and investing heavily in a future of Space tourism. Those highlighted include Burt Rutan, Richard Branson, Elon Musk, and Peter Diamandis. Space travel is still bound by red tape and subject to the implacable laws of physics as expressed in the rocket equation. Meanwhile, a new space race is underway among governments, as China, India, and Japan develop their technologies and programs. Beyond then turns to the potential for living and working in space, and the place in the Solar System where we might establish a permanent base. Economic models suggest that a viable space activity can be based on recreation, scientific research, and mining. In addition, there is an enormous amount of habitable real estate revealed by discoveries of extrasolar planets, but the difficulty of traveling beyond the Solar System will keep this beyond reach for a long time. More ambitious approaches include terraforming, where an entire planet or moon is altered to allow human habitation. The final section of the book turns to the far future, where we might one day leave the planet and the Solar System. This will require ambitious new propulsion systems, capable of accelerating a payload to a few percent of the speed of light. The potential of exploration by sentient nanobots is considered, along with the obstacles to achieving teleportation. At the end of the book, the prospects of finding intelligent, technological civilizations elsewhere are discussed. Based on recent estimated of 20 billion habitable worlds in the Milky Way, it's likely that such civilizations exist and some of them are likely to have developed capabilities far beyond our own. We are just venturing off-world for the first time, with an exciting future in space ahead of us. Reception Beyond was a starred selection by Publishers Weekly, with a review that concludes \\"With vivid writing that skillfully walks the line between visionary and pragmatic, Impey finds equal opportunity for both humans and robotic explorers on a journey that could not only teach us about new worlds, but how to be better caretakers of this one.\\" The book also had a good review in Kirkus Reviews. The Arizona NPR affiliate devoted segment to the book and a general discussion of space travel. Noted astronomer and science popularizer Neil deGrasse Tyson said \\"Chris Impey manages to rejuvenate the 'Space is Our Future' feeling that pervaded human culture half a century ago.\\" Poet and write Diane Ackerman also endorsed the book, saying \\"Impey‚Äôs space-faring vision really shines in this captivating tour of the deepest past and the distant future. It's a marvelous book to curl up with on a starry night and let your mind roam through the halls of possibility.\\" Notes External links * Book Website * Amazon Author Page * Chris Impey's Website * Chris Impey's Professional Website Category:Books by Chris Impey Category:2015 non-fiction books ","title":"Beyond (book)"},{"id":"45657070","text":"Roland Salm (born 21 February 1950) is a former Swiss professional cyclist.

Job control may include control over work tasks, control over the work pace and physical movement, control over the social and technical environment, and freedom from supervision. Workplace autonomy has been seen as a specialized form of the more general concept of control. Workplace autonomy is the freedom of a person to determine what he or she does at work, and how.  Association with other factors  For Georges Friedmann, the quality of work depends on the employees' skills and on their capacity to control decision-making at work. Robert Blauner found that job control is closely linked with occupational prestige and job satisfaction. Job satisfaction and job control tend to be higher for managerial and professional workers than for unskilled workers. A meta-analysis of 1986 found an association of high levels of perceived control with \\"high levels of job satisfaction [‚Ä¶], commitment, involvement, performance and motivation, and low levels of physical symptoms, emotional distress, role stress, absenteeism, intent to turnover, and turnover\\". Similarly, within the job demands‚Äìresources model it is assumed that resources such as job control counterbalance job strain and to contribute to motivation. In support of this approach, results of a 2003 study suggest that \\"as job demands increase, high job control is needed to limit fatigue, whereas either high job control or high job social support is needed to enhance intrinsic work motivation\\". Increasing job control is an intervention shown to help counteract exhaustion and cynicism in the workplace, which are two symptoms of occupational burnout. Job control has also been linked to the meaningfulness and the manageability components of salutogenesis.

Life John Clapham was born in London and began his professional life as clerk to the lord treasurer, William Cecil, Lord Burghley from around 1590. During this period he performed various roles, acting as burgess for Sudbury, dealing with the repair of English coastal defences, tending to wardship affairs, and becoming closely acquainted with the state of Burghley's health. He was present at Burghley's deathbed in 1598.Duncan-Jones, Katherine and H.R. Woudhuysen eds. Shakespeare's Poems: Venus and Adonis, The Rape of Lucrece and The Shorter Poems (Arden Shakespeare: Third Edition, 2007) p27. In 1602 he was admitted to Gray's Inn, serving as one of the Six Clerks in Chancery until 1618. In 1608 Clapham built Christ's Hospital in his father's home parish of Firby (Bedale), which he continued to support until his death in 1619. He was survived by his wife, Ann, daughter of Edmund Kiderminster, and one son. He is believed to be buried at St. Dunstan-in-the-West on Fleet Street. Works Clapham was the author of Narcissus (1591), a poem written in Latin hexameters treating the youth as a warning against the dangers of philautia (self- admiration). It is based on Ovid's account of Echo and Narcissus in the Metamorphoses (III.339‚Äì510) and contains echoes of Virgil, especially Book VI of the Aeneid.Martindale, Charles and Colin Burrow. \\"Clapham's Narcissus: A Pre-Text for Shakespeare's Venus and Adonis? (text, translation, and commentary).\\" English Literary Renaissance vol. 22.2 (1992) pp148-9. According to Katherine Duncan-Jones' summary, \\"it locates the Narcissus myth in England, the 'Fortunate Island', presided over by a Virgin Queen. In a palace in a wood Love proffers Ovidian advice to Narcissus about how to win over the woman he loves, however moody she may be. But Narcissus is carried off on a galloping horse called 'blind Lust', falls in love with the nymph Echo, and after a frustrating dialogue with her is soon drowned in the river of Self-Love and metamorphosed into the yellow flower that still bears his name.\\"Duncan-Jones and Woudhuysen (2007) p26. Most academic interest in the work derives from its being the first poem dedicated to Burghley's ward, the 17-year-old Earl of Southampton, the next being Shakespeare's erotic narrative Venus and Adonis (1593),Martindale and Burrow (1992) p150. The Rape of Lucrece (1594) and, according to some,Duncan-Jones, Katherine, ed. Shakespeare's Sonnets (Arden, 2010) p52. See also, for example, Bradbrook, M.

Secret Shakespeare: studies in theatre, religion, and resistance (Manchester University Press, 2004) p136. Although it is thought likely that Burghley prompted Clapham to write Narcissus for Southampton because of his reluctance to marry, commentators are not agreed about whether the poem itself argues in favour of marriage;Martindale and Burrow assert that the poem \\"could scarcely be regarded as an argument for marriage\\": Martindale and Burrow (1992) p151.

Clapham also wrote verses upon the death of Thomas Bodley in 1613, and other original works and translations. Historie of Great Britannie, his most substantial history, was published initially in 1602, covering the period of the Roman occupation of Britain from the invasion of Julius Caesar in 55 BC. In 1606 he published a longer edition, ending his account in the ninth century with the Anglo-Saxon King Egbert. Clapham began writing his other history in 1603. Certain Observations Concerning the Life and Reign of Queen Elizabeth contains a substantial biography of Burghley, among other eminent figures, based partly on his own recollections and information provided by Robert Cecil, Burghley's younger son.

It is also known as the Ouray mine. The mine is under \\"care and maintenance\\". Project overview and history Graphite was discovered in the area of the Uley project in the early 1800s and it was mined intermittently from the 1920s until 1993, when it was placed on care and maintenance. When in production, the open cut mine was capable of producing up to 14,000 tonnes of graphite concentrate annually. The project was re-activated in 2014 by Valence Industries Ltd. Valence Industries was an ASX listed company () focused on graphite development and production. The Uley project was its core asset and main focus. Valence reported first sales of graphite from the Uley mine under its ownership in 2014 and had all approvals in place to commence production at the mine, plus a high grade Ore Reserve. It had also completed a Feasibility Study for the significant expansion of its Uley graphite operations. Valence Industries changed its name to Quantum Graphite Limited () on 14 July 2017. The Uley Graphite Project is acknowledged as one of the largest coarse flake graphite deposits in the world. The deposit contains near-surface, disseminated, high-grade flake graphite. The project is held on free hold land, and comprises two Mining Licences and two associated Retention Licences, plus a large Exploration Licence south of the existing Uley graphite facilities. Location The Uley project is located in a region comprised predominantly of freehold and perpetual leasehold land used in the main for cereal cropping and livestock grazing. An established network of haul roads and sealed highways connect the project to available port facilities, and national road and rail networks. A two lane highway connects Port Lincoln to other regional towns on the Eyre Peninsula and Adelaide, the South Australian capital. Port Lincoln is the major regional centre in the Lower Eyre Peninsula and has a population of about 14,000, and has extensive public facilities, an airport serviced by regular flights to Adelaide, and a modern deep-water port, capable of handling up to Panamax-size ships. Existing plant and infrastructure The Uley Graphite Mine has significant existing plant and infrastructure which could facilitate ongoing operations. This includes a 14,000 tonnes per annum graphite processing facility, site access and haul roads linking a sealed road to Port Lincoln and associated port infrastructure, plus power and water infrastructure requirements of the project. The project area is connected to the National Electricity grid. There are also existing workshops plus laboratory and administration buildings on site. Reserves and resources The Uley project hosts a significant Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource defined from drilling at Uley Pit 2. The Ore Reserve is; 2.035Mt @ 12.9% graphitic Carbon (gC) for 261,000 contained tonnes (at a 3.6% gC cut-off grade). The total Inferred, Indicated and Measured Mineral Resource is; 3.04Mt @ 11.69% graphitic Carbon (gC) for 360,000 contained tonnes (at a 3.5% gC cut-off grade). The Ore Reserve estimate is based on Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources only. The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource were calculated in accordance with JORC 2012 guidelines. In addition to project contains JORC 2012 Exploration Targets of between 6Mt and 12Mt @ 9% to 12% graphitic Carbon, providing the potential for significant Resource and Reserve expansion.

She said that her paintings echo the work of John Marin and Milton Avery. Of her art, Duesberry said, \\"I am not interested in a realist painting, I am not interested in an abstract painting. I am interested in the tension.\\" Early life and education Joellyn Toler Duesberry was born on June 30, 1944 in Richmond, Virginia. Growing up in rural Virginia instilled in her a love for the land. She said, \\"All my life I think I've unconsciously tried to re-create the place where bliss or terror first came to me. Both emotions seemed so strong that I had to locate them outside of myself, in the land. This goes back to a childhood habit--of living in rural Virginia and seeking woods and creeks and lakes for solitary refuge; places where I could sketch and paint.\\" She decided to start painting at age ten after being given a pair of red tennis shoes and walking on the beach, inspired by the colorful juxtaposition of sand, shadow, and shoe. Soon thereafter she decided that \\"Women artists existed and she needed to be among them.\\" She received a BA with Distinction, Phi Beta Kappa, in art history and painting, from Smith College in 1966. In that year she was awarded a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship. While at Smith, she \\"honed her skills by making countless copies of masterworks.\\" She took her master's degree at New York University Institute of Fine Arts. Despite her degrees, she is considered to be a self-taught artist. Work Joellyn Duesberry was a plein air painter, who began \\"her canvases outdoors on an easel and finish[ed] them in the studio, frequently making monotypes in between.\\" She moved to Denver in 1985, and embraced the Colorado landscape in her art. In that year she received an Individual Painting Grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to work with Richard Diebenkorn. In 1997, Duesberry won the Benjamin Altman Landscape Prize from the National Academy of Design. While she had a World Views residency with the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council (LMCC) from 1998-1999, Duesberry painted city studies in studio space in some vacant offices of the World Trade Center's North Tower. She says that, because of her connection to the World Trade Center, the tone of her painting saddened after 9/11. In 2005, a PBS documentary was made of Joellyn Duesberry's life, work, and creative process titled Joellyn Duesberry: Dialogue with the Artist.

Early years Ritzenberg was born of immigrant parents on Armistice Day, November 11, 1918. He and his older brothers were self-taught public parks tennis players growing up in Washington, D.C. He became the top ranked junior player in the Mid-Atlantic States and one of the premiere U.S. college players as the number one player at the University of Maryland.  Professional playing career  Beginning in 1968, with the advent of the ‚ÄúOpen‚Äù era of tennis, when professional players were allowed to compete again, Ritzenberg entered the competitive tennis arena as a 50-year-old man. Over the course of the next 45 years, he won senior national championships in the United States, earning 15 ‚ÄúGold Balls‚Äù, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, Israel, Spain, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, Poland, Monte Carlo, and Brazil, and won major championships in England, Argentina, Mexico, France, Estonia, Australia, and Chile. He was also the Senior Asia champion, Senior European champion, ranked as high as number 1 in the Senior International Tennis Federation and a USPTA Senior Champion. Ritzenberg was a member of five US International team competitions for men 55 (Austria Cup), 65 (Britannia Cup), 70 (Crawford Cup) and 75 (Bitsy Grant Cup), all of which were winners of the ITF World Championships. He served as the long-time tennis professional at the St. Albans School for Boys and Director of its Tennis Club. Ritzenberg retired in 2005, as the number 1 world tennis player among men ages 85 and up. Democratization/expansion of the game Ritzenberg is considered to be a major contributor to the popularization and democratization of tennis in the United States. Starting in the early 1950s Ritzenberg actively sought to integrate tennis by insisting that Washington area tournaments invite top ranked black athletes, by actively recruiting black members to the clubs with which he was associated, and by assisting black athletes with academic admission to an exclusive boys school in Washington, D.C. He organized tennis exhibitions, invited many of the world‚Äôs top players to Washington and played in exhibitions with Althea Gibson, Richard ‚ÄúPancho‚Äù Gonzalez, Billie Jean King, Neale Fraser, Roy Emerson, Vic Seixas, and Pauline Betz Addie, conducted clinics at mental hospitals and children‚Äôs homes, and was instrumental in providing tennis opportunities for the disabled, including wheelchair bound athletes. In 1955 Ritzenberg was sent by the US Department of State on the International Educational Exchange to establish a Goodwill Tennis program in Haiti. He was praised in Congress for his work on this Specialist Grant program. Ritzenberg opened the first Washington area public indoor tennis facility. Later he opened the Cabin John Indoor Tennis Club with Pauline Betz and Stanley Hoffeberger. Tennis and politics During the Kennedy Administration, Ritzenberg taught tennis at St. Albans to a number of politicians. Ritzenberg was called to the White House to give tennis instruction to First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy and to hit with President John F. Kennedy. Tennis antiques and contributions to the game At the International Tennis Hall of Fame and Museum, Ritzenberg is best known for his extensive tennis collection amassed over 50 years and acknowledged to be the largest, most comprehensive such private collection in the world. \\"Ranging from the Renaissance through the 1930s, the Albert and Madeleine Ritzenberg Collection covers virtually the entire history of tennis. In half a century of travels around the world, the Ritzenbergs have acquired objects related to tennis, building a collection that includes items from the 15th century up to the Art Deco period of the 1930s.\\" That collection is now safely housed in the Museum in Newport, Rhode Island. In the mid-1950s, he worked with Jimmy Van Alen to test the VASSS scoring system with the Kramer Tour in Washington, DC. The ‚ÄúTiebreaker‚Äù has become a mainstay of the modern game. His passion for art inspired him to hire respected artists like Sam Gilliam and Jacob Kainan to create graphics for tennis. Ritzenberg has written articles for the New York Times, Washington Post, and Tennis Magazine on topics like tennis ethics and team play. He produced and appeared in instructional tennis films that were used in the USTA library.  Capital Tennis  In 2004 Ritzenberg published a memoir of his life at the intersection of tennis and politics, Capital Tennis. In his autobiography, Ritzenberg writes not only about the opportunities this sport has afforded him but also about the lessons and values that the game of tennis instills in all who play. \\"Ritzenberg's club was at the crest of a sweeping change, sparked during the Kennedy administration, in which Washington's power elite favored tennis rather than golf, the favored sport of the Eisenhower administration. Ritzenberg personally coached such memorable figures as Jacqueline Kennedy, Robert McNamara, George McGovern and Donna Shalala. He mentions his personal efforts to found the club as a place of equality as surely as the spirit of sports - though St. Albans was a private club, it would not discriminate on the basis of race or religion, an almost unprecedented decision in 1962, two years before Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\\"  Death  Ritzenberg lived to be 100 years old on Veterans Day 2018. He died at his home in Bethesda, Maryland 11 days later.

He was born in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, and died in Madrid, Spain. Paluzzi‚Äôs works are in a number of permanent collections, from the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden at the Smithsonian to the Union Fenosa Museum of Contemporary Art in Coruna, Spain.http://www.javierbmartin.com/index.php/pintores-javier-b- martin/222-rinaldo-paluzzi Education and works After serving in the U.S. Navy during WWII, he was a student at the John Herron School of Art (now part of the Indiana University) from 1948 to 1950. He then left to attend the Accademia di Belle Arti in Rome Italy until the end of 1951. After returning to the Herron, he received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1953. He remained at the Herron, where in 1957 he was awarded a Master of Fine Arts. The following is from the Herron Chronicle (published in 2003). ::Twenty-seven students received their diplomas and degrees at commencement on June 9, 1957. One of the graduates in attendance was Rinalo (Randy) Paluzzi who received his MFA that day and a top $2,000 Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation grant. He was just as surprised as anyone that such honors were coming to him, considering that a mere eight years before he had been at home in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, discharged from the Navy, with no high school diploma, no clear prospects, and no interest in art at all. His elder brother Guarino had just transferred to Herron, and he suggested that Randy use his G.I. Bill and follow him there. Paluzzi recalled that his first drawings in Harry Davis' class were \\"terrible.\\" Since the Tiffany grant could be used without restrictions, Paluzzi decided to spend it in Italy, parceling it out to last a full year. Aiming to take his wife, former classmate Claudine Kelsey, and his three infant daughters along, and realizing the grant would not stretch that far, he spent the summer of 1957 working 12-hour shifts driving a mail truck to raise another $1,000. The Paluzzis left for Rome on October 2.Pages 127-130 of The Herron Chronicle by Harriet Warkel, Martin Krause, and S.L. Berry with an index by Jennifer L.

Conway. Film's official website. The film traces the use of public relations tactics that were originally developed by the tobacco industry to protect their business from research indicating health risks from smoking. The most prominent of these tactics is the cultivation of scientists and others who successfully cast doubt on the scientific results. Using a professional magician, the film explores the analogy between these tactics and the methods used by magicians to distract their audiences from observing how illusions are performed. For the tobacco industry, the tactics successfully delayed government regulation until long after the establishment of scientific consensus about the health risks from smoking. As its second example, the film describes how manufacturers of flame retardants worked to protect their sales after toxic effects of the retardants were reported in the scientific literature. The central concern of the film is the ongoing use of these tactics to forestall governmental action to regulate greenhouse gas emissions in response to the risk of global climate change. Interview with Kenner. Production Interview subjects The filmmakers interviewed more than a dozen individuals who have been involved in a series of conflicts ranging from the regulation of tobacco products due to the health risks to global climate change. In the sequence in which they appear in the film, they are: *Stanton Glantz is a professor of medicine and activist for regulation of tobacco smoking. In 1994 he received a carton of documents copied from the records of the Brown and Williamson tobacco company that revealed their awareness of health risks as early as the 1950s. *Sam Roe and Patricia Callahan are reporters at the Chicago Tribune newspaper who in 2012 exposed \\"manufacturers that imperil public health by continuing to use toxic fire retardants in household furniture and crib mattresses, triggering reform efforts at the state and national level.\\" They were finalists for a Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting. *James Hansen is a former NASA scientist whose 1988 testimony on climate change to congressional committees helped raise broad awareness of global warming, and has become a prominent advocate for regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. *John Passacantando is the former executive director of Greenpeace, an organization of environmental activists. *William O'Keefe is the chief executive officer of the George C. Marshall Institute, an organization that opposes government regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. Naomi Oreskes (2015), co-author of the book Merchants of Doubt Fred Singer (2011), a prominent opponent of greenhouse gas regulation *Naomi Oreskes is a professor of the history of science and the co-author of the book that inspired the film. *Fred Singer is a physicist and environmental scientist who founded the Science & Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) in 1990 to work against regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, among other issues. *Michael Shermer is a writer and publisher of the magazine Skeptic. He was initially a \\"contrarian\\" regarding regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, but his views changed as the science of climate change advanced. *Matthew Crawford is a writer. He is a former director of the Marshall Institute who resigned over the influence of the Institute's sponsors in determining the Institute's activities and positions. *Marc Morano is a political activist who has published the climate denial website ClimateDepot since 2009. To encourage complaints to scientists whose work is viewed as supporting action on greenhouse gas emission, the website publishes their addresses. *Ben Santer, Michael E. Mann, and Katharine Hayhoe are climate scientists who have received personal threats because of their global climate change work. *Tim Phillips is the president of Americans for Prosperity, which works against government regulation on climate change and other issues. *Bob Inglis is a former congressional representative from South Carolina; he lost his seat in the primary election following his announcement that he had changed his view and recognized global climate change as a problem that government should address. Professional magic The film embeds commentary and performances by magician Jamy Ian Swiss. The premise of these interludes is that there is an analogy between the techniques of professional magicians and the tactics of public relation organizations. Magicians learn how to distract their audiences from noticing the deceptions that underlie their tricks and illusions. The organizations distract the public from the risks associated with products. These tactics were systematically developed by the tobacco industry in the 1950s in response to scientific research showing that smoking was a significant health risk; the research was a significant threat to tobacco sales. The principal distraction tactic has been the use of convincing personalities who claim that the uncertainties in the risks militate against taking action. An unsigned review in The Boston Globe explains, \\"To make his point clear, Kenner follows up Swiss‚Äôs magic act and fancy patter with a snappy montage of various experts over the years denying that cigarettes cause cancer, or extolling the virtues of pesticide, or proclaiming that asbestos is ‚Äúdesigned to last a lifetime ‚Äî a trouble free lifetime.‚Äù And then the inevitable parade of climate change deniers bloviating in Congress or on cable news, all backed by Sinatra singing ‚ÄúThat Old Black Magic.‚Äù\\" A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times that Swiss' \\"presence, and the animated playing cards that sometimes fly across the screen, feel like a glib and somewhat condescending gimmick, an attempt to wring some fun out of a grim and appalling story.\\" Reception Threatened lawsuit One of the subjects of the film, Fred Singer, wrote the director indicating that he was considering a lawsuit. Although no lawsuit was filed, Kenner noted in an interview that \\"when [Singer] implies litigation is very expensive, I think it's an attempt to be intimidating.\\" In the 1990s, Singer had sued Justin Lancaster over his statements regarding the inclusion of Roger Revelle as a co-author of a climate change paper with Singer and Chauncey Starr; Revelle had died shortly after the paper was published. That lawsuit ended when Lancaster withdrew his statements as \\"unwarranted\\", although Lancaster later expressed regret over the settlement. Critics' views The film has been widely reviewed in the mainstream U.S. media and garnered mostly positive reviews. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 84% based on 89 reviews, with an average rating of 6.95/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Merchants of Doubt is a thought-provoking documentary assembled with energy and style, even if it doesn't dig as deep as it could.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 70 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Justin Chang wrote for Variety that it is \\"An intelligent, solidly argued and almost too-polished takedown of America‚Äôs spin factory ‚Äî that network of professional fabricators, obfuscators and pseudo-scientists who have lately attempted to muddle the scientific debate around global warming ‚Äî this is a movie so intrigued by its designated villains that it almost conveys a perverse form of admiration, and the fascination proves contagious.\\" William Goss wrote for The Austin Chronicle that \\"Merchants spends much of its running time exposing trends of political subterfuge before working in an earnest call to action regarding climate change. Using the same type of tinkling score and shots of children at play as campaign ads shown earlier in the film, this late-inning agenda comes off as noble as it is hypocritical. Regardless of one‚Äôs personal beliefs, it‚Äôs tough to respect a movie that ultimately invites viewers to question every case of propaganda except its own.\\" Home media Merchants of Doubt was released as a DVD on July 7, 2015. This is a multi-format package (both Blu-Ray and DVD disks). The Blu-Ray has an optional audio commentary from the director, deleted scenes, and interview footage from the Toronto international Film Festival.

He is played by Paul Sparks. Mickey Doyle is based on Polish American mobster Mickey Duffy. Mickey is a gangster in Prohibition-era Atlantic City. For the first two seasons, he is the main rival of harlem liquor kingpin Chalky White. He is known for his distinctive, nasal laugh, and serves as the series' comic relief. Out of all the characters who worked with/for Nucky Thompson surprisingly Mickey is the last man standing.  Appearances   Season one  In the first episode of season one, Mickey is introduced as a Polish-American gangster trying to establish himself as a power in the illegal alcohol trade following the passage of the Volstead Act, which outlaws the sale of alcohol. It is revealed that his real name is Mieczyslaw Kusik, and he changed it to \\"Mickey Doyle\\" to pass himself off as Irish-American. He meets with Atlantic County Treasurer and political boss Nucky Thompson (Steve Buscemi) to show him his bootlegging operation. Mickey tells Nucky that he expects to produce 2000 crates a week. He gets into a scuffle with Nucky's driver, Jimmy Darmody (Michael Pitt), until Nucky breaks it up. Jimmy later gets revenge on Mickey by informing Prohibition Agent Nelson Van Alden (Michael Shannon) about Mickey's operation. Van Alden raids Mickey's operation and arrests him. Nucky gives Mickey's operations to Chalky White (Michael K. Williams), an African-American gangster. Mickey convinces Chalky's rivals, the D'Alessio brothers, to murder Chalky and gives them a description of his car, a Packard. They track the car but mistakenly kill Chalky's driver instead of Chalky himself. Mickey persuades the D'Alessio brothers to rob the ward boss in broad daylight on the boardwalk. He then joins them in going into business with Arnold Rothstein (Michael Stuhlbarg). Soon after, the D'Alessio's unilaterally decide to assassinate Nucky without consulting Doyle, but they botch the hit and Nucky escapes unharmed. Startled by this escalation of violence, Mickey returns to Nucky's side and provides information on the D'Alessio's operations in exchange for his life being spared.  Season two  In Season 2, Mickey joins Jimmy Darmody's crew, along with Al Capone (Stephen Graham), Charlie Luciano (Vincent Piazza) and Meyer Lansky (Anatol Yusef), and with them conspires to overthrow Nucky. Mickey brings Philadelphia gangster Manny Horvitz (William Forsythe) to a meeting with Jimmy, and helps to convince Horvitz to lend them money. Mickey promises that he can be operational within a week or two provided he gets alcohol to reconstitute. Unfortunately for Mickey and Jimmy, Mickey's distillery is bombed by Owen Sleater (Charlie Cox), Nucky's new enforcer. The distillery's destruction prevents Jimmy from being able to payback his debt to Horvitz. After Jimmy has successfully brokered a peace deal with Nucky while left him in charge of Atlantic City, he throws a party to celebrate. When Jimmy notices that Mickey has brought Horvitz along, he angrily throws Mickey off a second floor landing, sending him crashing into a table. Mickey meets with the rest of Jimmy's crew at their new warehouse in Atlantic City to view the medicinal alcohol they have bought from George Remus (Glenn Fleshler). Doyle oversees his men diluting the alcohol in a vat as the others arrive. Doyle adds that Horvitz, whom Jimmy had tried to have killed, is still a problem and Jimmy instructs Doyle to pay him off with liquor. Later that day, Mickey has a tense meeting with Horvitz in which he blames the assassination attempt on Waxey Gordon (Nick Sandow); Hovitz doesn't believe him, however, and beats him up. When Jimmy suddenly disappears following the murder of his wife Angela (Aleksa Palladino by Horvitz, Mickey sells his entire share of the liquor in Philadelphia. Lansky keeps track of figures in his notebook. Capone instructs Mickey to sell Jimmy's portion of the stock, and pay Jimmy out of his own share. When Mickey protests, Luciano reminds him that Rothstein holds a life insurance policy on him; if Mickey does not do as instructed, Luciano will kill him and split the insurance money with Capone. Cowed, Mickey accepts the deal. However, he then goes to Van Alden and sells out his partners, giving him the location of their next meeting. In return for that information, Mickey demands half of the money the police would seize. Mickey's hopes for a huge profit fall through, however, when Van Alden is forced to flee the state to escape a murder charge. Desperate for work and protection against his former partners, Mickey betrays Jimmy and returns to Nucky's side.  Season three  By season 3, Mickey is working for Nucky as the crew boss in one of Nucky's liquor warehouses. He is first seen with Nucky as he interrogates a thief who had stolen some of his liquor; Nucky explains to the thief that Mickey is truly at fault for the theft, as he had left the liquor unattended while he went to an outhouse. Nucky's brother, Eli (Shea Whigham), who¬°s been recently released from prison, is put to work directly under Mickey, much to Eli's annoyance. Mickey throws his weight around the warehouse, at one point intimidating one of his movers by claiming to have killed Manny Horvitz. The word spreads that Mickey killed Horvitz, angering Richard Harrow (Jack Huston), the man who actually committed the crime. Harrow kidnaps Mickey and brings him before Nucky, and forces him at gunpoint to admit that he lied. Facing a blockade from Nucky's rival Gyp Rosetti (Bobby Cannavale), Mickey decides to route a convoy of trucks carrying Nucky's liquor through the small town of Tabor Heights. He dismisses Eli's warnings that it is a trap. Sure enough, Rosetti's gang ambushes the convoy, killing several of Nucky's men; though Mickey and Eli are able to escape, however. When Rosetti's men invade Atlantic City with backing from Joe Masseria (Ivo Nandi), Mickey manages to avoid assassination by Rosetti's men and joins in on Nucky's war party to fight off Rosetti's forces, along with Eli, Chalky and Capone. Eventually, they are successful in reclaiming control over Atlantic City.  Season four  In season 4, Mickey runs Nucky's main warehouse. When Nucky's nephew, Willie (Ben Rosenfield), tries to charm his way into getting a crate of whiskey for a party, Mickey chastises him and throws him out. Moments later, however, he takes pity on the boy and gives him a crate. In so doing, he unwittingly sets a chain of events in motion that end with Willie facing murder charges. Mickey accompanies Nucky to Tampa, Florida, where Nucky intends to invest in land. There, they both meet speakeasy owner Sally Wheet (Patricia Arquette), and Mickey immediately has designs on her. Sally prefers Nucky, but flirts openly with Mickey in order to make Nucky jealous. When it appears that she is about to sleep with Mickey, however, Nucky hits him in the forehead with his former valet Eddie Kessler's (Anthony Laciura) cane that Mickey took, impressing Sally and scaring Mickey into backing down.  Season five  While Nucky is in Havana, Cuba trying to procure an exclusive distribution contract with Bacardi, Meyer Lansky unsuccessfully makes an attempt on his life. When Nucky returns to Atlantic City, Mickey is running his bootlegging operations and Chalky White's former restaurant, now a burlesque club. Nucky, and by extension Mickey, end up fighting with Lansky and Luciano in a bloody gang war with the aid of New York Mafia \\"Boss of all bosses\\" Salvatore Maranzano (Giampiero Judica). Mickey informs Nucky and Maranzano that Luciano has fire bombed four of their trucks, costing them over $100,000. Nucky has Mickey go to New York to kidnap Luciano's associate Benjamin Siegel (Michael Zegen) in order to force a meeting and end the feud. Before the meeting starts, Nucky gives Mickey the title and full ownership of his burlesque club, as well as five percent of every profit made there. When Luciano says that he wants everything Nucky has, including the club, Mickey tries to reason with Luciano, but to no avail - Luciano shoots him in the throat, killing him.  Origins  Mickey Doyle is loosely based on Polish American Philadelphia-based mobster and bootlegger Mickey Duffy, who was also killed in Atlantic City in 1931.Napier, Jim. \\"Fact From Fiction: The Real History Of ‚ÄòBoardwalk Empire‚Äô\\" Screen Junkies.

Rogerie was born in Villefagnan in the Charente department of south-western France.Memorial book, Foundation for the Memory of the Deportation His trajectory was \\"typical of the complexity of the movement of deportees among the camps.\\" His eyewitness account of Auschwitz-Birkenau exemplifies the self-published eyewitness accounts published in the immediate aftermath of the war, but ignored until the 1980s. He is also notable for having produced the oldest contemporary sketch of a camp crematorium, also ignored by historians for decades until the 1987 publication of Le Monde juif by . Early years and entry into the French Resistance Andr√© Rogerie was born to Joseph and Jeanne Rogerie in Villefagnan, in the department of Charente in western France on 25 December 1921, the fifth child in a Catholic military family.INA, Major Interviews, General Andr√© Rogerie; audio recording His father was an officer who died in 1923 from wounds he received in World War I. He was raised with a traditional love of country and God. His older brother, also an officer, was killed in 1940. The German invasion in May 1940 and defeat of France was deeply distressing to him; when he learned that Marshal Philippe P√©tain requested an armistice from the Germans in June, he collapsed. A few days later, a friend informed him that a young General De Gaulle was continuing the war in England, and Rogerie resolved to join him. In 1941, he joined the lyc√©e St. Louis in preparation for entering the French military academy at St. Cyr. He joined up with the Ceux de la Lib√©ration (CDLL) movement, which was chiefly involved in the manufacture of false papers and which his cousin had joined, but as a young intern, he had limited involvement. His goal was above all else to get to England and join the fight. He was not aware of anti-Jewish discrimination until he saw Jews obliged to wear the yellow star in June 1942. As a mark of solidarity, he and a colleague went around Angouleme for a few days wearing a blue star. He walked around in public throwing anti-German pamphlets he crudely printed himself. After the Allied landings in North Africa in November 1942, he sought to join the Free French Forces led by Charles de Gaulle via Spain and the southern Mediterranean Sea. Through a colleague, he found a source and obtained some counterfeit identity papers, but they were of poor quality, and on 3 July 1943, at age 21, he was arrested by the Gestapo in Dax, along with two other friends. He was imprisoned, and held by the Gestapo in Biarritz, Bayonne, Bordeaux and Compi√®gne before being deported to the camps. Deportation Rogerie was deported to Buchenwald at the end of October 1943, and spent time in a succession of camps, including Buchenwald, Dora, Majdanek and Auschwitz-Birkenau. During the death march he also passed through the camps of Gross-Rosen, Nordhausen, Dora again, and Harzungen. He ended up escaping from the column on 12 April 1945 near Magdebourg, and reentered France alone on 15 May. On arrival in Buchenwald on 1 November 1943, his head was shaved, he was disinfected and sent to the barracks in rags. His initial assignment was carrying stones. From Buchenwald he was sent on to Dora where conditions were appalling. The deportees had to work tirelessly in the cold, starving, sick, without water or sleep. In three months he was a wreck and was no longer able to work. Having become \\"useless\\" Rogerie was sent in a convoy of ill prisoners to Lublin. In her book Deportation and Genocide. Between Memory and Oblivion published in 1992, asks if Rogerie meant the Majdanek camp in the outskirts of Lublin. In fact, his report published in 1945 is not clear on this point; he speaks only briefly about the camp. On the other hand, in the 1987 Jewish World Rogerie no longer speaks about the camp of Lublin but of Majdanek. Two more months passed waiting for death. When the Soviet Army were approaching Lublin, the camp was evacuated. On 18 April 1944 Rogerie arrived at Auschwitz-Birkenau. The name \\"Auschwitz\\" meant nothing to him. He was tattooed and transferred to the quarantine camp of Birkenau. Right away, a French doctor told him that they were gassing people to death. He didn't believe it. That evening, he learned that three hundred young Jewish women were gassed.Rogerie, Vivre c'est vaincre [You Win By Living], H√©rault, 1988, p. 70; cited by Annette Wieviorka It was at that moment that he learned about the extermination of the Jews. He made a promise to himself to bear witness if he ever got out of there alive. After the liberation On 13 April 1945, the Americans liberated the sector. Andr√© Rogerie remained one month in a German school, regaining . He began writing his memoir in a school notebook. After a month, he was evacuated to France by truck, arriving in Angouleme on 17 May 1945. He continued writing, with his sister helping with the typing, and completed his manuscript on 21 October. He self-published it in 1945 under the title \\"You Win By Living\\" (Vivre c'est vaincre) with a print run of 1,000 copies using monies he received as back salary. He illustrated his book with a map of Birkenau and a sketch of a crematorium both drawn from memory. This graphic was credited by as being the oldest of its kind and highly accurate. The fact of having drawn it immediately after liberation became a source of relief to Rogerie, because what he lived through later seemed so incredible, that he sometimes wondered if it was possible. He believed that what he lived through was so beyond normal experience that words fail. \\"The deportees try to recount it‚Äîactual historical facts, but unimaginable‚Äîbut how to convey the cold, the hunger, the beatings, the suffering, the cries, the howling, the shrieks, the fear, the fatigue, the filth, the stink, the promiscuity, the endlessness, the poverty, the disease, the torture, the horror, the hangings, the gas chambers, the deaths?\\" Andr√© Rogerie matriculated as an officer candidate in Saint-Cyr, the French West Point or Sandhurst, in 1946. He chose a specialty in engineering and was posted to Germany before going on to French Indochina. He ended his career with the rank of G√©n√©ral and was decorated as a Commander of the Legion of Honour. He died in May 2014 in Martign√©-Briand. Struggle against Holocaust denial After the publication in 1945 of his book Vivre c'est vaincre, he didn't speak publicly about deportation and the Jewish genocide. He knew nothing about the existence of the Center of Contemporary Jewish Documentation nor were they in possession of his book. The rise of Holocaust denial led him to speak out once again. In 1986 he published an article in Le D√©port√©, the organ of the Union Nationale des Associations de D√©port√©s, Intern√©s et Familles de disparus and then in Le Monde juif (edition of Jan/Mar 1987). He wrote about the fate of Jews and Gypsies at Auschwitz. He knew that, as a Catholic, no one could accuse him of embellishing the facts. Even so, he was often attacked by Holocaust deniers, whom he, in turn, viewed as obvious anti-Semites. He drew a clear distinction between deportation and persecution (of Jews and Gypsies) on the one hand, and that of repression (of Resistance members) on the other. He gave testimony about life in concentration camps in speeches to academic establishments, and on CD and on DVD. In 1994 he received the \\"M√©moire de la Shoah\\" prize of the Buchmann Foundation. On 16 January 2005, he testified about his experiences along with Simone Veil at the Paris city hall, on the occasion of the commemoration of the liberation of Auschwitz.

Lessons from Srebrenica visits programme 'Lessons from Srebrenica' is a flagship education programme established to help strengthen British society, with over 1,450 people taking part from the UK since 2013. These individuals come from all walks of life, all ethnicities, and all faiths or none, but have one thing in common: the desire to promote positive change within their local community by agreeing to undertake a pledge to promote community cohesion and integration. The participants play an important role in arranging memorial events and other activities across the country, working together with Remembering Srebrenica‚Äôs eight English regional boards and three country boards. Education Working together with schools across the UK, Remembering Srebrenica has educated over 100,000 young people about Srebrenica in the past six years. The charity provides learning resources such as lesson plans and assembly presentations to support teachers in educating both primary and secondary school pupils. It also facilitates the 'We Are One' football tournament in schools and youth groups, which is supported by the FA, Kick it Out, the ESFA, Show Racism the Red Card and footballer Asmir Begovic.  Conflict Transformation and Srebrenica programme  In 2019, the charity also began the Conflict Transformation and Srebrenica programme, which is funded by the PEACE IV programme and supported by Mid and East Antrim Council in Northern Ireland. This programme teaches young leaders aged 18-25 from Mid and East Antrim about Srebrenica and helps them make links to their own communities.

Biography IWOC Award in 2015 From the time she was in Middle School, Nadia Sharmeen wanted to become a journalist. In 2009, she joined the Bangladesh press corps and became a crime reporter. In 2013 Sharmeen was covering an Islamic rally for her employer Ekushey Television, when she was attacked by the Hefazat-e-Islam activists. The rally was being held to demand restrictions on the open association of males and females in the same space, punishment of atheists, wearing of scarves by women, and other religiously based precepts. The Hefazat activist's 13-point demand list specifically called for the government to abandon the current Women's Policy, which had been designed to create gender equality. While there were no reported incidents of violence between activists and police, journalists were attacked and tortured in many places in Dhaka and Chittagong, as were women garbage collectors. Sharmeen's attackers targeted women who were not wearing the hijab. Nadia believed she was attacked, \\"only because I am a woman\\". The 50-60 men who attacked chased her and pelted her with water bottles and pieces of brick. When she fell, others punched and beat her. Several male reporters and cameramen tried to save her and themselves became targets of the mob. Sharmeen was rushed to Dhaka Medical College and Hospital for emergency treatment and once stabilized was moved to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital. Within days, a report was filed with the thana, but no arrests had occurred as late as July, 2013 when Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh petitioned the high court for relief for Sharmeen. The court called for arrest of the perpetrators and ruled that the government was responsible for covering her medical care, whether inside the country or abroad Nearly two years after the event, no identifications nor arrests have occurred. After her recovery, Sharmeen returned to work as a crime reporter for a different news agency. She now works at Ekattor TV. Her attack has strengthened the resolve of women's rights activists, who immediately following the assault staged several rallies, with the support of various press clubs, the Bangladesh National Women Lawyers Association (BNWLA) and other organizations. In 2014, her story was used as part of the global campaign One Billion Rising for Justice by activists to urge the Bangladeshi government to implement CEDAW protections.

After her time in the House, Mason Gray received her law degree from the University of Tulsa and was a municipal judge from 1994 to 1999. She was elected as District Judge for Oklahoma County in 1999 and served in that position until her death in 2011 after battling with breast cancer. Early life Twyla Mason was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to Willard and Mildred Mason. She was the middle child of three and spent a large portion of her childhood summers reading books while recovering from knee surgeries. She grew up attending political events with her politically active father, and worked in a campaign when James R. Jones was running for re-election to Congress in 1976. She received her Bachelor of Science from the University of Central Oklahoma. After Jones' campaign, Gray went to work as an assistant at his Tulsa office for a year and a half before she decided to run for office in 1980. House of Representatives (1980‚Äì1984) Gray was 26 when she was sworn into office in 1980. She was not only the first woman, but the first democrat to win an election in district 23. When elected, four other women from Tulsa served alongside Gray, including Penny Williams, Helen Arnold, Arlene Baker and Joan Hastings. Mason and her future husband, Charles Gray, began to date while both in office. They married in 1981 and were the first incumbent House members to marry in state history. Gray was a strong advocate for cancer-related health care while in office. She was also integral in raising the drinking age to 19, as well as making it legal to charge a spouse with rape. Gray did not choose to run for re-election a third time and instead started a family with her husband and went back to school. She graduated with her Juris Doctor from the University of Tulsa. Municipal Judge After taking over the financial management of several companies after receiving her J.D. from the University of Tulsa, Gray found out she had breast cancer in 1990. She recovered for approximately a year and was then appointed as a municipal judge for the City of Oklahoma City in 1994. District Judge In 1998, Gray decided to run for office again and was elected as a district judge in Oklahoma County, and was re-elected twice since that first election. She is credited as being a plain-spoken and independent in her position. Gray served in this position up until her death in 2011 after a lengthy battle with breast cancer.

Diagram of an ILSC scan Light from the laser interacts uniquely with various micro-textural structures, creating a specific laser speckle effect (or signature). This signature can then be read by the incorporated camera, which utilizes Bayesian inference and inbuilt libraries of micro-textures to create a \\"laser speckle image\\" of the target. Since the method is comparative, it may also be used to differentiate very small changes in micro-structural objects, for example, a change in cell size.

The potential application areas of ILSC are as follows : \\\\- Skin analysis: it is possible to make an automated parametric discrimination between the two different conditions of skin (e.g. normal or effected by a disease)that are invisible to human eye. This would be particularly very useful for early diagnosis of the systemic diseases where the skin does not yet exhibits their visual effects by the surface changes [3] \\\\- Pharmaceutical inspection :ILSC is also used for pharmaceutical product inspection as the laser light (with an ideal wavelength) can penetrate into the pharmaceutical (tablet) subsurface and scatters back by conveying the subsurface material characteristics to be identified and analysed by ILSC technique 5\\\\.

Renaud de Cormont, continued his fathers work on Notre-Dame of Amiens in the 1240s, believed to bring a form of architectural revolution to upper transept and upper choir of Amiens Cathedral through his introduction of a glazed triforium, openwork flyers, and new decorative forms. Renaud altered the eastern wall of the transept and upper levels of the choir into an ornate glass box held by extremely thin flyers. This failed monumentally: the triforium had to be replaced, the tracery panels on the flyers crumbled and the transept roses failed. Of more concern was the fact that the entire eastern half of the building needed to be held up using wooden beams, iron chain, masonry spines and an additional rank of flyers. Because of this, art historians have likened him to an Icarus whose defective work on the upper transept and choir led to a near disaster, likely a play on the fact that the center of Amines Cathedral contains a labyrinth designed on the floor and his father, or Daedalus in this case, had worked on the cathedral before him.

Retrieved March 13, 2015. Composition Title The title is derived from the god Heimdallr of Norse mythology, whose call on the Gjallarhorn was to announce the apocalyptic events of Ragnar√∂k (\\"Fate of the Gods\\"). The events of Ragnar√∂k were also famously depicted musically in Richard Wagner's opera G√∂tterd√§mmerung, last of his four-opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen.Lindow, p. 37. Rouse had previously visited similar thematic material with his 1997 percussion concerto Der gerettete Alberich, which chronicles the exploits of the villainous dwarf Alberich following the destruction of Valhalla. Structure Heimdall's Trumpet is composed in four connected movements. A performance of the work lasts approximately 22 minutes. In the score program notes, Rouse wrote: Instrumentation The piece is scored for solo trumpet and orchestra comprising three flutes (third doubling on piccolo), three oboes, three clarinets, three bassoons (third doubling on contrabassoon), four French horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, harp, timpani, percussion (three players), and strings (violins I & II, violas, violoncellos, and double basses). Reception Reviewing the world premiere, music critic John von Rhein of the Chicago Tribune highly lauded the concerto as \\"bolster[ing] Rouse's reputation as one of the most compelling American composers around\\" and noted, \\"The musical style melds the pile-driver sonorities and manic accumulation of rhythmic energy of Rouse's earlier manner with the more consonant calm of his recent pieces. The work is slow to take off, but once it does, it makes you want to hold on to the roller coaster and enjoy the ride.\\" Rhein also praised the trumpet and orchestral writing, adding, \\"Rouse's handling of the orchestra, right up to a screaming mass plunge off the musical cliff at the very end (abruptly followed by ominous silence), is nothing if not individual.\\" Lawrence A. Johnson of the Chicago Classical Review called the piece \\"another Rouse success\\" and wrote, \\"Heimdall‚Äôs Trumpet is among the finest of Rouse‚Äôs works. Spiced with the composer‚Äôs usual ear for percussive coloring and rhythmic insistence, and scored with characteristic ingenuity and audacity with plenty of opportunities for the soloist, this work should find a wide audience (for those hardy trumpeters who can handle its tortuous demands).\\" References Sources * Category:Concertos by Christopher Rouse Category:2012 compositions Rouse Category:21st-century classical music Category:Music commissioned by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra Category:Norse mythology in music ","title":"Heimdall's Trumpet"},{"id":"45658011","text":"Deshabandu Dr Primus Tilakaratne de Silva (commonly known as P.

The 224th Mixed Brigade (Carlos Engel, Historia de las Brigadas Mixtas del E. P. de la Rep√∫blica, 1999) was a mixed brigade of the Spanish Republican Army in the Spanish Civil War. It was formed in summer 1937 in Catalonia from scattered Coastal Defence units and had four battalions: the 893, 894, 895 and 896. In early March 1938 this mixed brigade was sent to combat in Aragon without adequate equipment and training. Within a short time its battalions were decimated in such a manner that only a few demoralized men remained and the brigade was disbanded. The number of this unit was assigned then to a new brigade established a month later, on 19 April 1938. This new mixed brigade also suffered many losses and only a few of its men survived and were able to cross the French border while fleeing from the advancing rebel armies. History The 224th Mixed Brigade was established in August 1937 in Catalonia with Coastal Defence (Defensa de Costas) units as a military reserve unit for the Levantine Army (Ej√©rcito de Levante). The command of the unit was entrusted to Infantry Commander Mart√≠n Calvo Calvo, who had been a retired Captain at the time of the July 1936 coup. The commissar was Ignacio Fern√°ndez of the Communist Party of Spain (PCE). First unit: Aragon The 224th Mixed Brigade was placed under the 72nd Division of the XVIII Army Corps of the Levantine Army (Ej√©rcito de Levante). It was sent with this division to the Teruel front line, but the organization of both the brigade and its division was still so deficient that it was not possible to use them in combat and thus it was camped as reserve unit south of La Muela. On 7 March 1938 the brigade was sent, still not fully equipped, to the Battle of Belchite during the imminent rebel offensive in Aragon, but it was overwhelmed by the sheer force and intensity of the Nationalist attacks. The brigade was further devastated on 11 March in bloody combats that followed in the Escatr√≥n and Caspe area. The result of all these combat actions foisted on the ill-prepared brigade was the almost total dispersion of the unit, with only a much battered battalion remaining in the area between Pertusa and Monz√≥n, another between Fraga and the Ebro River and the remainder engaged in the Defence of Lleida. The brigade had been shattered in such manner that it was no longer possible to reestablish it and it was terminated in March 1938. Latter unit: Catalonia On 19 April the number 224 was revived and assigned to a new mixed brigade hastily formed with new battalions that had formerly belonged to the 124th Mixed Brigade. The new unit was assigned to the 60th Division of the XVIII Army Corps at Vallfogona. The commander was Militia Major Antonio Moya Gabarr√≥n, and the chief of staff commander was Militia Captain Benito Garc√≠a Freixas. The new unit took part in the Battle of the Ebro, arriving to the frontline area on 30 July as reserve of the XV Army Corps in the Fay√≥n-Vilalba dels Arcs sector. As stated in a rebel military report based on deserters from this Republican Army unit ‚Äîwhile at the Second Gandesa front in Vilalba dels Arcs‚Äî unusual measures were taken in order to avoid desertions in the newly reorganized 224th Mixed Brigade.Pedro Corral, Desertores, Eds. de Bolsillo, San Sebasti√°n, 1966, p. 223 On 3 August the 224th Mixed Brigade relieved the troops of the 16th Division in the line between La Pobla de Massaluca and Cuatro Caminos. By 19 August it was caught up in the heavy combats of the Vilalba-Corbera-V√©rtice Gaeta triangle where it held its positions without giving way for eight days. Between 9 and 12 September the brigade was relieved by forces of the 42nd Division, while they were on their way to cover the left bank of the lower Ebro River. On 4 December the 224th Mixed Brigade was sent to Ivars d'Urgell in order to defend the bridgehead at Balaguer. In the combats that ensued it suffered many casualties, for the rebels were initiating the Catalonia Offensive with numerous well-equipped units and their advance was unstoppable. Its hasty retreat led the battered 224th Mixed Brigade northeastwards across Catalonia, to Cervera, Calaf, Manresa and Vic, from were a few of its remaining survivors managed to cross the French border around January 1939.

It was built from 1870s to 1920s. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 August 2002.  History  The block on which Braeside Homestead is situated was taken up in 1869, during the opening of large tracts of Rosenthal run to selection in the late 1860s and early 1870s. The homestead itself was established in the mid-1870s. From 1879 to 1901 the property was developed as a model stud farm by Queensland pastoralist, politician and businessman William Allan. It is not certain who named the property, but by 1887 Braeside was identified in the local electoral roll as both the grazing property and a locality. In the earliest years of non-indigenous settlement on the southern Darling Downs, Braeside was included within the Leslie brothers' mid-1840 ambit claim for Tulburra run, and from was part of the North British Australasian Investment Co.'s Rosenthal run, excised from Tulburra. Under the provisions of the Alienation of Crown Lands Act of 1868, James Adam Veitch of Warwick selected two blocks along Turner Creek from Rosenthal Run in 1869. These comprised selection 286 (containing the site of Braeside Homestead ‚Äì of first-class pastoral land and of second-class pastoral land) selected on 25 August 1869 and adjacent selection 295 ( of first-class pastoral land and of second-class pastoral land) selected on 15 September 1869 ‚Äì making a total of . Under the conditions of selection, Veitch had to pay an annual rental of per annum on selection 286 for a period of ten years, commencing 1 July 1869, and had to make improvements. Once these conditions were satisfied, he could apply for freehold title. The Darling Downs Bailiff for Crown Lands first inspected selection 286 on 16 December 1875, to ascertain proof of the fulfilment of the conditions of selection. At this time boundary rider Henry Steel had been in residence on the block from 1 January 1870, acting as bailiff for JA Veitch, \\"sheep overseer\\" of Glengallan. The property was stocked with 1000 sheep and 224 head of cattle, property of the selector. Improvements consisted mainly of fencing and sheep yards, and there was a two-roomed slab hut with a bark roof, chimney, verandah, and \\"bush furniture\\", which was the residence of Steel and his wife. The inspector's report and neighbours' declarations satisfied WC Hume, the Darling Downs Commissioner of Crown Lands, who in February 1876 issued Veitch with a certificate of fulfilment of the conditions of selection. The next month Veitch signed over his interest in the leases of selections 286 and 295 to South Toolburra grazier Bertie Chiverton Parr, who immediately paid off the outstanding debt and gained freehold title in July 1876. Parr likely named the property, and also appears to have acquired a number of adjacent selections which became part of Braeside. A little over a year later, in September 1877, Parr conveyed selections 286 and 285 [totalling now , some land having been excised for roads] to Francis Henry Needham of Warwick, for the sum of . This was the value of the property when first acquired for selection in 1869, suggesting that no substantial improvement, such as a house, had been erected by this date. In February 1878 Needham registered a mortgage on the property from George Arthur Needham, which he likely raised to purchase and/or improve the property. It was possibly Needham who erected the first house (as distinguished from the earlier slab hut) on Braeside. Needham was the second son of the Hon. Francis Henry Needham. Socially he was extremely well connected, having married Grace Gore, daughter of the late aristocrat and pioneer Darling Downs squatter St George Richard Gore, at Warwick in June 1873. Needham was resident in the Dalveen district by 22 September 1876 ‚Äì whether this was at Braeside has not been established, but it is possible he was managing the property for Parr ‚Äì and was influential in selecting a site for the location of the Dalveen railway station in October 1878. However, he retained title to selections 286 and 295 for less than two years before selling them for to pastoralist William Allan in July 1879. Allan, the well-educated son of an Edinburgh lawyer, arrived in Australia aged about 17, to work for his uncle Alexander Campbell in Victoria. Allan gained his pastoral experience principally at his uncle's property and at Bundure Station in the Riverina. In 1869 he purchased the lease of Geraldra Station, near Bland Creek in New South Wales, and in 1871 established a lucrative stock and station agency at Young in New South Wales. Late in 1871 he married Emily Mate of Tarcutta Station, New South Wales, the daughter of successful Albury storekeeper, station owner and politician, Thomas Hodge Mate. The marriage consolidated Allan's social, business and political connections in the colonies. In 1874 Allan joined the second wave of southern pastoralists to move into Queensland, with the purchase of Whyenbah and Woolerina Stations on the Balonne and Maranoa rivers. Pastoralists of Allan's generation were the pastoral improvers of Queensland, replacing the pioneer land grabbers of the 1840s and 1850s. Mob of black sheep, Braeside, 1894 In purchasing Braeside, a well-watered grazing property on the southern Darling Downs, from FH Needham in 1879, Allan was able to concentrate on stock breeding and improvement, developing the property as a model stud farm, his pastoral headquarters, and his family's permanent place of residence. At Braeside Allan established a purebred Hereford Cattle Stud and bred black Merino and Lincoln sheep, the wool selling well on the London market. He took a great interest in developing the stud, keeping detailed herd books. His bulls had a reputation for hardiness and longevity, and were in demand with graziers. Braeside Stud was sufficiently significant to Queensland to be featured in the Department of Agriculture's Queensland Agricultural Journal of September 1899. At this time the property totalled about , and included Mount Crystal. The Hereford cattle stud numbered over 1,000, all descended from high-class imported English stock. In addition there was a fine Jersey dairy herd at Braeside, and some cropping for home consumption, on the creek flats. The house was set amid extensive gardens and an orchard. In the 1880s Allan established a close business connection with the mercantile firm of BD Morehead & Co. In December 1881 he nominated Boyd Dunlop Morehead of Brisbane and his brother-in-law William Henry Mate of Tarcutta Station, New South Wales, as trustees for Braeside, and in 1882 was made a partner in the firm of BD Morehead & Co. In 1886, he was appointed managing partner. In addition to his building up of the Braeside stud, his other Queensland pastoral interests, his involvement with BD Morehead & Co., and world trips with his family in 1875 and 1883, Allan was actively involved in community and political spheres. He was a President of the prestigious Queensland Club in Brisbane, the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce, and the Eastern Downs Agricultural and Horticultural Association. He was a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society of Queensland, and a committee member of the Royal Agricultural Society and the Queensland National Association. He was also a major in the Darling Downs Mounted Infantry Regiment (volunteers) and a prominent freemason. Through his work with the Darling Downs Pastoralists' Association, the United Pastoralists' Association, the Federated Employers' Union of Queensland (all of which he helped form) and as Vice- President of the Pastoralists' Federal Council of Australia, Allan took a significant role in defeating the shearers' strikes of the early 1890s and maintaining the pastoral status quo. He served as Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for the Darling Downs from November 1881 to October 1883 and from September 1887 to May 1888, prior to his election as MLA for Cunningham in May 1888. He held this seat until March 1896. As may be expected from his pastoralist and mercantile activities, he was a McIlwraith Nationalist and a Coalition Conservative, and while never holding a portfolio, his social, pastoral and business connections enabled him to wield considerable personal influence. In March 1897 he was appointed to the Queensland Legislative Council, a position he retained until his sudden death in October 1901. It is likely, given Allan's popularity and strong social, commercial and local political profile, that he entertained regularly at Braeside. Following William Allan's death his wife Emily remained at Braeside for several years, with AW Allan [Alexina W Allan, the Allan's eldest child?], managing the property. In September 1906 the property was transferred to George Edward Bunning, manager of Darr River Downs Station in Western Queensland. Bunning and his family resided permanently at Braeside for only a few years, having made Brisbane their principal place of residence by 1911 and leaving Braeside to the supervision of managers. Photographic evidence reveals that substantial extensions to the main homestead, which include a northern bedroom wing, and on the southern side an idiosyncratic \\"tower\\" and a large public room which may have functioned as a ballroom, living room or billiard room, were constructed between 1899 and 1918, and were most likely erected for the Bunning family. By 1918, Braeside Homestead comprised a substantial group of buildings, with a complex series of additions, extensions and renovations. The majority of these structures survive although some have been relocated within the homestead yards. Bunning subdivided Braeside in the mid-1920s. The bulk of the property, including the block containing Braeside Homestead (subdivision 1, portion 192, par Rosenthal, co Merivale, comprising ), was transferred in February 1925 to Englishman Harold Priest, who retained it for only a few years. During this period his brother Alfred, a London painter of some repute, stayed and painted at Braeside. Early in 1928 Priest sold Braeside to George Gilbert Cory (Grandson of Gilbert Gostwyck Cory?) of Gordonbrook and Cormanshurst. The Cory family retained and occupied Braeside for over 20 years until it was transferred in 1951/52 to Kenneth William Lloyd. In 1951 the western end of the northern bedroom wing of the main house was relocated about to the west, to form a separate residence [now called Rose Cottage] for Mr and Mrs Leighton, who managed Braeside for the Lloyds. In 1954 the property, then reputedly comprising about , was transferred to Cecil Raymond Hardman Lockwood, who ran it with a staff of 6 or 7. It is understood that an early shingled dormitory building, evident in photographs taken between 1918 and 1922, was destroyed by fire in the 1950s. Lockwood sold Braeside in 1972. Several subsequent rapid changes in ownership to 1983 saw the property decline. In the late 1990s Braeside Homestead was developed by the Lindsay family as a \\"home stay\\".  Description  Braeside Homestead is located about south of Warwick just west of the New England Highway, along Crystal Mount Road, overlooking Turner's Creek to the east. It comprises a complex grouping of timber structures, including the main residence with multifarious additions and extensions, outbuildings, yards, fencing and gardens. Most of the buildings date to the last quarter of the 19th and first two decades of the 20th centuries. The core of the main building, which likely dates to the mid-1870s, is a rectangular, timber-framed, timber-clad and timber-lined building which faces east toward the creek. It is set on low timber stumps and has deep exterior chamferboards, a steeply pitched hipped main roof with two double brick chimneys, and a front central projecting gable over an enclosed former front entrance. The roof of this gable has timber shingles beneath later corrugated iron cladding. The interior is lined with wide, single-beaded, tongue and groove timber boarding. At the northern end of the main house is an early 20th century bedroom wing, with heavy timber infill to the gable end, which faces north. Prior to the early 1950s, this wing extended further west, with a second north-facing gable. This second gabled section is now located about to the west on the homestead block, and is occupied as a separate residence. In its place is a small timber laundry extension. At the southern end of the core building is another early 20th century timber extension. This has a pyramid roof clad in corrugated iron., and external chamferboards narrower than those of the 1870s section. Like the core and the northern wing, the southern extension also rests on timber stumps, but at a greater height than the core, and there are steps leading down to the foyer connecting this extension to the 1870s building. The southern extension comprises one large room ‚Äì living room/ball room/billiard room ‚Äì with a high, coved ceiling lined in narrow tongue and groove timber boarding. In the eastern wall is a bay window overlooking the garden, and glass doors opening onto the southern verandah of the house core. Opening off the southern end of this extension is an idiosyncratic timber \\"tower\\", about one and a half storeys in height, with a steeply pitched pyramid roof of galvanized iron with a top finial and acroteria to the corners of the guttering. It is square in form, and has narrow windows at the top, just below the eaves. These are separated on the exterior by decorative timber brackets. There are verandahs with timber posts and capitals and corrugated iron roofs to the front [east] and side [south] of the tower. Later glass doors open to both verandahs. Internally the tower comprises one room, lined with the same narrow, vertically jointed tongue and groove timber boards as the southern extension, and opens directly into this room via a simple timber arch in the northern wall. Like the rest of the complex, the \\"tower\\" is set on timber stumps, but higher than those of the larger southern extension. This \\"tower\\" now forms the principal entrance to the residence. Behind the \\"tower\\" room, to the west, is a bedroom wing which appears to be the remnant enclosed northern verandah of an earlier dormitory wing which was destroyed by fire s. This has an open verandah along the southern side. Attached or semi-attached to the rear [west] of the core are a number of weatherboard-clad structures, including kitchen, study, meat house and garage. Most of these have hipped roofs clad with corrugated galvanised iron. The meat house roof is gabled. There are two red- brick chimneys, thought to date to the 1950s, in this section of the homestead. The main house is set within gardens which include an early carriage path from the south with remnant early hedging; a number of mature trees likely to date to the 19th century; a tennis court in the southwest corner of the garden; and terraces with stone retaining walls along the bank to the creek. To the west/northwest of the house are a number of outbuildings, which include an early two-storeyed timber barn relocated from its original location closer to the house, and an early single-storeyed two- roomed cottage also formerly located closer to the house. Between these outbuildings and the main house is an L-shaped timber cottage with a front gable with heavy timber infill. This cottage was formerly part of the northern bedroom wing of the main residence. There are numerous yards and sheds adjacent to the principal outbuildings and Rose Cottage. On the southern perimeter of the homestead block, along Crystal Mountain Road, is a timber paling fence.  Heritage listing  Braeside Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 August 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Braeside Homestead is important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland history. The property was developed as an important Hereford stud in the last two decades of the 19th century, during a significant period of pastoral improvement in Queensland, and is illustrative of the dominance of Darling Downs stud farms in livestock breeding in Queensland in the 19th and early 20th centuries. William Allan's work at Braeside made a major contribution to livestock improvement in this State. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Braeside Homestead comprises a substantial complex of timber structures set within gardens and yards, which has evolved over time. It remains substantially intact, and is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of its type. The timber buildings are worthy of further investigation and analysis, and have the potential to contribute significantly to our understanding of the construction and design of timber buildings in rural Queensland from the 1870s to the early 1900s. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The placed has strong aesthetic value, engendered by the materials, complex form, garden and creek-side settings, and surrounding rural environment. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Braeside Homestead is important also for its association with pastoralist, businessman and politician William Allan, who contributed significantly to stock improving and conservative politics in Queensland, and who wielded strong personal influence in pastoral, mercantile and political circles.

Adapted from James Oliver Curwood's short story of the same name, the film follows a young chemist named Jack Goodwin. He discovers a chemical compound that puts a person into a state of sleep for a determined period of time and decides to test it upon himself. The first test is a success and Jack makes arrangements for his sleep of a hundred years, in a state similar to suspended animation. When he awakes in 2010 into a world ruled by women, he woos the female mayor. Jack joins a society to campaign for men's rights. The society ends up before the female mayor who jails all of them, save for Jack who she proposes to. Jack accepts on the condition that men are given back their rights and she accepts. The cast and production credits of the film are not known, but Theodore Marston was not the director. The film was released on December 20, 1910. The film is presumed lost.  Plot  The film focuses on Jack Goodwin, a young chemistry student who has discovered a novel compound that allows a person to be put in a state of sleep for any length of time. The compound causes an effect similar to suspended animation, with no ill-effects or bodily changes. Jack tests the compound on himself for a period of a week and desires to test it for a century. In preparation for this, he obtains a safety deposit vault and provides instructions to be presented before the mayor in a hundred years. Jack's experiment works and he awakes in the year 2010 to a very different future. Transportation has been radically changed to pneumatic tubes allowing him to be transported to the mayor. The woman mayor takes an interest in him and invites her over to her home. In the intervening years, the world has become ruled by women and Jack is now out of place, but the two fall in love. Her father is an advocate for men's rights and Jack joins their society. The group soon appears before the mayor and she sends all of them to jail through the pneumatic tube, except for Jack. She proposes to him, but Jack only consents if the rights of men would be granted. The mayor is true to her word and signs a decree to give the men their liberty. During the ceremony, she attempts to lead Jack to the altar, but Jack shows her that the man must lead. When the bridal veil is placed on Jack, he places it on his new wife.  Cast  *Frank H. Crane *William Russell  Production  The scenario is adapted from James Oliver Curwood's short story of the same name. The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Sometimes the directional credit is given to Theodore Marston. The apparent origin of this error is from the American Film-Index 1908‚Äì1915. Film historian Q. David Bowers consulted one of the co- authors of the book, Gunnar Lundquist, and confirmed that the credit of Marston was in error. Theodore Marston worked with Path√©, Kinemacolor, Vitagraph and other companies, but there is no record of Marston working with Thanhouser. This error has persisted in several works including The Complete Index to Literary Sources in Film. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though none are specifically credited. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. Musical accompaniment for the silent films were not provided by the studios, and the Thanhouser productions were no exception. The musical program for the screenings were decided and played by the individual accompanists. At times, musical accompaniments were shared in trade journals, but for Looking Forward a dispute serves to provide one musical credit provided by Mrs. Buttery of Pennsylvania. In responding to an editorial in The Moving Picture World, Mrs. Buttery stated that \\"John Took Me Home to See His Mother\\" was played during film at some unstated point. Release and reception  The single reel comedy, approximately 1,000 feet long, was released on December 20, 1910. The New York Dramatic Mirror stated, \\"Here is a rather exaggerated farce with a good many laughs in it. It has for its basis recent cartoons, but has original treatment. The male members of the cast seemed to enjoy their roles, perhaps for the reason that it is a man's picture; the laugh seems on the ladies.\\" A more contemporary analysis of the film was covered in a paper by Eric Dewberry, who credits this film as Thanhouser's first film portraying suffragists. Dewberry writes that the film presents the idea of a woman mayor, something which was not farfetched for women to find to be humorous. Despite Jack's lack of power in the new era which he awakes to, he managed to win the heart of a powerful woman and easily restore the rights of men. Taken one way, the film seems to advance the idea that a women of power are controlled by their hearts. Dewing writes, \\"On the one hand it mocks many female suffrage \\"fighting tactics,\\" as suffragists, in an attempt to not appear too extremist and alienable, exploited conservative ideas of feminine virtue in order to assert their citizenship and reform desires. In the film, the man assumes effeminate passions to woo the Mayor. On the other hand, those sympathetic to the cause can see this as proof that these tactics can work in politics. The film also toys with the fears men harbored concerning the loss of power over females in public spaces, a threat to masculinity and manhood.\\" The film is also believed to have been the first adaptation of Curwood's work.

Tony Glover of Rolling Stone described the song as \\"Marvel Comics meets the Lower East Side.\\" The New York Dolls famously performed \\"Jet Boy\\" on The Old Grey Whistle Test on 27 November 1973.

He was trained in Dublin, where he began his career before establishing himself in London. Biography According to Walter Strickland's Dictionary of Irish Artists (1913), Leahy was born in London, son of Daniel Leahy of Dublin, whose family were originally from Cork. An article published in the Cork Examiner in the mid-1840s, however, describes the artist as a \\"Cork man\\", adding that \\"we hope he will remain sufficiently long amongst us to enable his fellow-citizens to take advantage of this, his first visit for many years to his native city\\".Article from the Cork Examiner, reprinted in He studied at the Dublin Society's School, where he won several prizes between 1811 and 1814. He exhibited two portraits at the Hibernian Society of Artists in 1815, as well as a self-portrait and a \\"Portrait of a Gentleman\\" in the Dublin Society's premises in Hawkins Street. He was then living at No. 2 Fleet Street, Dublin. In 1816, having moved to Anglesea Street, he submitted four portraits, including one of himself, to the exhibition in Hawkins Street and was awarded a premium by the Irish Institute. He exhibited three works in 1817, and shortly afterwards moved to London, where he established himself as a portrait and subject painter. He first showed at the Royal Academy in London in 1820, making his debut with a portrait of Mrs. Yates in the role of Meg Merrilies. He became a frequent exhibitor of portraits and historical subjects, both at the Academy and at the British Institution. Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex and the Marquess of Bristol sat to him, as did various prominent Irishmen including the Earl of Rosse, Richard Lalor Sheil MP, Sir Matthew Tierney M.D. and William Cuming, president of the Royal Hibernian Academy, whose portrait Leahy later presented to the R.H.A. . His subject pictures included The Battle of the Nile and The Battle of Trafalgar (1825); Mary Stuart's Farewell to France, (1826, engraved); Jacques and the Wounded Stag (1830); Escape of Mary Queen of Scots from Loch Leven Castle, (1837, painted for Lord Egremont) and Lady Jane Grey summoned to Execution (1844).O'Donoghue 1892 His Catching the Expression, shown in 1824, depicted, according to one review, Leahy and Edwin Landseer together in a studio. Following the death of the Royal Academician William Owen in 1825, Leahy completed many of his unfinished portraits. Despite his move to England, Leahy continued to exhibit in Dublin occasionally until 1846, sometimes showing works that had been seen in London some years earlier. When his Mary Queen of Scots' Farewell to France was shown in 1842 it was purchased by the Royal Irish Art Union. During a visit to Cork in 1846, Leahy painted a portrait of Father Mathew, the \\"Apostle of Temperance\\", in connection with a commission from Dwarkanath Tagore. It is now in the National Portrait Gallery, London. Between 1837 and 1843 Leahy lived in Italy, and while in Rome painted a portrait of the sculptor John Gibson, RA. After his return to England he exhibited a few Italian subjects, showing at the Academy for the last time in 1863. He died at Brighton on 9 February 1875. Gallery File:William Cuming by E. D.

First invented by Boston Pizza, recipes were posted online as early as April 2014, though they did not become viral until the Pillsbury Company posted an example in September 2014. Reviews have been mixed, with praise aimed at its taste and criticism leveled at its complexity and unhealthiness. History In April 2014, the Canadian-based chain Boston Pizza included the pizza cake as part of its Pizza Game Changers promotion, which featured numerous \\"outlandish\\" pizza- related products. The recipe quickly became the promotion's most popular, receiving 15,000 votes by 21 April - more than five times as much as its nearest competitor, the pizza mint. It held this position until the promotion closed. The company advertised the concoction as \\"great for birthdays, bar mitzvahs, weddings, and even lonely nights watching infomercials\\". Inspired by the Boston Pizza promotion, later in April a recipe for pizza cake was posted to the So Good Blog; one Reddit user who tried the recipe described it as \\"heavenly\\", though with a strong \\"food hangover\\". In September 2014, a recipe for pizza cake by Shawn Syphus was posted by the Pillsbury Company. It soon circulated widely on the internet, becoming viral; the company was sometimes mistakenly attributed with originating the recipe. Preparation The So Good Blog recipe calls for regular pizza dough, rolled into a layer thick, out of which six round pieces 6 1/3 inches (16 cm) in diameter are cut. These rounds are cooked in a preheated oven for 15 minutes, then allowed to cool. Meanwhile, baking powder is sprinkled into a pot, the sides of which are then lined with a thick layer of dough. When this is complete and the rounds are cooled, a round is placed at the bottom, then covered in pizza ingredients (including sauce, pepperoni, and cheese); this step is repeated until the pot is filled. After excess dough is trimmed off and the edges are tucked in, the pizza cake is baked for 45 minutes. The Pillsbury recipe which went viral in September 2014 had a similar, though smaller, recipe which called for less cooking time. The recipe recommended a pan with tall sides (square or round), and called for three layers of dough and a total of 28-33 minutes of cooking time (8 for the rounds and 20-25 for the finished pizza). The Daily Mirror gave a total of 5,000 calories for a six-layer Boston Pizza pizza cake. Reception Peter Sagal of NPR found the recipe was more complicated than it appeared, writing \\"It's not exactly (how much you like pizza) √ó (number of layers)\\", and that the pizza cake lost the crispiness of the crust. He concluded that the recipe was fun to make, and the \\"obscene amount of cheese\\" being eaten makes one forget issues with the crust. Rosanne Salvatore, writing for the online magazine Bustle, considered the cake worth recommending despite the amount of work and expense required; she concluded \\"I created a miracle [the pizza cake] with my bare hands\\". April Blake, writing in the Cleveland Free Times, had a more negative view of the recipe. She considered it difficult to prepare, lacking crispiness in the crust, and more unhealthy than a regular pizza.

Initially published by Kalachuvadu Publications in 2010, it was later translated into English by Aniruddhan Vasudevan and published in 2013 in India by Penguin Books, and in 2018 in the US by Grove Atlantic. Set during the colonial era in the Southern state of Tamil Nadu in India, it deals with the social stigma that a married couple faces due to their childlessness, and the lengths they go to conceive. Background The idea for writing the novel came to Murugan on witnessing couples around him suffer due to the inability to have a child. The novel is set in the Tiruchengode town in Tamil Nadu, from which Murugan hails, and its main characters in the book belong to the Kongu Vellalar Gounder caste, which he himself belongs to. The original name of the novel comes from the word Madhorubaagan, the Tamil name for the androgynous form of Lord Shiva in Hindu mythology. In 2005, Murugan was awarded a grant by the India Foundation for the Arts to do the background research for the novel. In the course of his research, he came across a societal practice that existed in the past to deal with childlessness, which he decided to include in the book. The existence of such a practice has been a subject of dispute. Murugan stated in an interview with The Hindu that there was no documentary evidence relating to the custom and that details about it were passed on orally. Plot Kali and Ponnu are a couple living in Tamil Nadu. Despite having been married for 12 years, they are unable to conceive a child. Their childlessness becomes a source of constant taunts from family members and fellow villagers, who variously attribute it to family curses, God's wrath, or their ancestors' ill behavior. Desperate, the couple try several remedies, prayers and offerings but to no avail. Kali is often encouraged to have a second wife, an idea he considers but ultimately rejects. As a last resort, their families put forward the suggestion that Ponnu go to the chariot festival of the androgynous god Ardhanarishvara, where on the 14th day, societal taboo relating to extramarital sex is relaxed and consenting men and women may sleep together. Kali is repulsed by the idea but brings up the subject with Ponnu, who responds by saying she would go if he wished so. Kali feels betrayed by her reaction and eventually grows colder to her. The following year, Ponnu's family takes matters into their own hands by luring Kali out of the house, while convincing her that he has given his consent for her to go to the festival. She does so and finds a man she considers \\"a god\\" to impregnate her. Meanwhile, Kali returns home to find Ponnu gone, leading him to breakdown and curse Ponnu. Themes One Part Woman deals with the themes of ritual and tradition, and the power these elements have in societies, relationships and individuals. The novel explores how a community's pathological obsession estranges a loving couple and breaks up their happy marriage. It also depicts life in pre-Independence rural India, focusing in particular on the rigid social hierarchy set by the caste system. In the mostly agrarian Gounder caste to which Kali and Ponna belong, the status of the landowner is directly proportional to the number of sons he has. Ponna is pressurized to conceive to improve her husband's social standing and to stop people from bringing up the lack of inheritance for her family's property. Thus, a major portion of the couple's woes come not from their own desire to have a child, but their community's stigmatization towards those who do not have any. The novel also highlights the stratification of Indian society along caste lines, which is brought out through the concept of untouchability. Part of Kali's distress over Ponna attending the festival stems from the thought that his wife might have intercourse with an untouchable. The novel also examines how patriarchal customs in India turn women into victims of gender essentialism. Women are expected to conform to a fixed female identity, and Ponna's failure to do so results in the repression of her individual self. In connection to this, the novel explores the condition of marriage and gender roles within it. When the couple remains childless for years, Kali is recommended for a second marriage, almost naturally placing the blame on the woman. Murugan has pointed out that marriage in India \\"is not a democratic institution [...] The man always has and continues to have a wider space in which to function, [while] the woman is constantly constrained.\\" The novel also describes how patriarchy leads to the oppression of female sexuality, by viewing it solely as means to motherhood and the benefit of her husband and progeny alone. Reception The novel has garnered critical acclaim. Meena Kandasamy of The Guardian praised Murugan's \\"unsurpassed ability to capture Tamil speech, [which] lays bare the complex organism of the society he adeptly portrays\\" as well as Vasudevan's translation for \\"preserving the mood of the original\\". The New Yorker called it \\"a subtly subversive novel [that] considers the constraints of tradition [...] In simple yet lyrical prose, Murugan shows how their standing in the world depends on their offspring.\\" Lucy Scholes of The National summed it up as a \\"moving, quietly magnificent portrait of a tender, loving marriage that‚Äôs buckling under the impossible strain of meddling busybodies and the weight of conventional societal expectations.\\" She opined that the translation was \\"competent\\" even though \\"occasional phrase[s] [that] strike as a little too modern does sneak through.\\" Kirkus Reviews concurred, writing: \\"Poignant and sweet, the novel suffers only from a certain roughness in the prose; something, it seems, has been lost in translation.\\" The original Tamil novel was awarded the ILF Samanvay Bhasha Samman in 2015. The English version was awarded The Tamil Literary Garden Award for Translation in 2014, and longlisted for the 2018 National Book Award for Translated Literature. It was also announced as the Sahitya Akademi Translation Prize awardee in 2018, but the High Court of Madras passed a stay order on it after agitators filed a plea against it. Vasudevan consequently declined the award, citing an unwillingness to pursue a legal battle for the same. In the wake of these events, Sahitya Akademi jury member Githa Hariharan filed a counter-affidavit contending that issues within the purview of litterateurs could not be subjected to judicial review. Controversy In December 2014, the novel attracted the attention of various caste-based factions in Tamil Nadu, who claimed that the novel's depiction of extramarital sex during the Ardhanarishvara festival insulted their deity and the women of their caste. Nearly 10,000 copies of the controversial portions of the novel were distributed by the protesters in houses and among women to mobilize people against the book. Protests broke out in Tiruchengode, where copies of the book were burned and an official complaint, demanding a ban against the book and the arrest of the publisher and author, was lodged. Although the protests were widely reported to have been encouraged by the right-wing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, it issued an official statement denying any involvement in the matter. After a district-wide strike was declared, Murugan issued a clarification that he would remove all references to the place where events in the novel take place. As protests continued, he attended a peace meeting presided over by local administrators, where he was forced to render an unconditional apology and agreed to withdraw the book itself. In the aftermath of these events, he posted what has been called a \\"literary suicide\\" note on his Facebook page, withdrawing all his written work and declaring a self- imposed end to his career as a writer. In 2016, a petition was filed with the Madras High Court to nullify the settlement against publication of the book. Concurrently, multiple criminal complaints were filed against Murugan on the grounds of obscenity, blasphemy, and defamation. The High Court ultimately ruled in favor of the author, invalidating the settlement and dismissing the criminal complaints. In the verdict delivered in July 2015, Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul held: The judgment was hailed in the press as a landmark victory for free speech in India. Sequel In 2014, Murugan wrote two books, ‡ÆÖ‡Æ∞‡Øç‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æ∞‡Æø () and ‡ÆÜ‡Æ≤‡Æµ‡Ææ‡ÆØ‡Æ©‡Øç () as \\"dual sequels\\" to One Part Woman, both picking up from the end of the original novel but each following different storylines. However, the protests against the original broke out in the time leading up to the printing and release of the books, thus curtailing its publication. Subsequent to the High Court ruling on the matter, the books were translated into English by the original translator, Aniruddhan Vasudevan, as A Lonely Harvest and Trial by Silence respectively, and were released in December 2018 by Penguin Random House. In both books, Ponna returns from the festival pregnant, but the former finds her dealing with her grief as Kali commits suicide, while in the latter he survives but continues to harbor deep resentment towards her. The books were well-received by critics, who praised the novels' indigenous writing style, strong characters and the themes they dealt with. The two books were jointly shortlisted for the JCB Prize for Literature 2019.

The church, dedicated to Saint Petronilla. That small church fell into ruin, and was finanally razed in 1895. Construction of the present church and convent was commissioned in 1622-1632 by the Capuchin Order of monks. Until 1537, the Capuchins owned a convent in Monte Celso near Siena. But because of growth, they sought a new location, and chose one closer to the city. The convent and church they built was dedicated to the Santissima Concezione di Maria (Holiest Conception of Mary). The Granduke of Tuscany was present at the ceremony to lay the first stone, and a decade later the convent was inaugurated under the guidance of the Archbishop of Siena, Ascanio Piccolomini. The convent, which once housed 100 monks, now is a home for disabled individuals. When the remains of the old church was razed, the title of Santa Petronilla was transferred to the church. The church now belongs to the Archdiocese of Siena, Colle di Val D'Elsa, Montalcino. The Capuchin convent was briefly suppressed by Napoleonic authorities in 1810, which was renewed in 1866. After this, the convent underwent a number of diverse uses, including as a lazzeretto to quarantine cholera, as barracks, school, orphanage, baracks, and armory. The neo-Romanesque belltower of the church remained incomplete for centuries, and was only completed only after World War II. Among the bells are some from 1623 and another from 1790. The wide steps that lead to the portal were completed during the 1940s. The remains in a small cemetery and ossuary in front of the church was relocated to the church. The interior contains a variety of paintings: including a Glory of St Joseph (1629) by Raffaello Vanni; a Martyrdom of St Catherine of Alexandria by a painter of the school of Alessandro Casolani; a Death of the Virgin (1633) by Astolfo Petrazzi, a Martyrdom of St Lawrence by and unknown 17th-century painter; a Deposition of Christ (1704) and an Ecstasy of St Francis of Paola (1722) by Giuseppe Nicola Nasini.

By 1929 they were the world's largest producer of both products. The farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013, considered significant at a national level because of the brothers' innovations in ginseng farming and in fur production and marketing.Lacey, p. 4. Beginnings By 1901 the Fromm/Nieman family had been farming in Hamburg for decades. While farming, some of the sons had been trapping red fox for supplemental income. Furs of wild animals were a popular part of fashionable clothes at the time, and they brought a good price. More valuable than red fox was the silver fox, a sport of the red fox. In 1901, the brothers read in _Hunter Trapper_ magazine about a silver fox pelt that sold in LondonLacey, p. 26 & 36. for $1200,The Fox Tale the price of many Wisconsin farms at the time. Four of the brothers made a pact to raise silver foxes. They were Walter, Edward, John and Henry Fromm, and these eight to thirteen-year-old boys began calling themselves \\"The Company.\\" But to get fox-breeding off the ground, they needed money. left Wild ginseng had been collected in the forests of North America for hundreds of years, for sale to China. Reinhold Dietsch, a neighbor of the Fromms, was experimenting with cultivating it, and he shared with the brothers how to plant the roots in beds and how to build lath arbors over the plants to simulate the shade of the forest. In 1904 the brothers planted some wild roots they had found in their mother's garden. When their father refused to give them lath to use for their crazy scheme, they bought it themselves. When they asked for more land to plant on, he offered them only a rock pile. They moved the rocks and planted. To grow more ginseng, the brothers needed to plant seeds, rather than the few roots they found in the forest. This required a tricky process of germinating seeds in layers of sand buried in boxes for a year, which they learned from Eastern ginseng growers. Ginseng roots take about five years to mature, and the first crop grown from seeds was finally harvested in 1912. In 1915 they harvested a half acre, and it sold for $3,500.Lacey, p. 27-29. thumb The silver fox is not a separate species, but is a genetic variant born occasionally to red foxes. Since the silver is rare in the wild, it is more valuable than red fox. In the 1880s some men on Prince Edward Island tried breeding silver fox to each other in captivity, and managed to produce more silver fox pelts to sell. Their production technique was kept a secret until one of the silver foxes escaped, and led hounds back to their secret farm. By 1909, other fox farms were operating on Prince Edward Island.Lacey, p. 36 Back in Wisconsin, in 1909 the Fromm brothers managed to buy or catch twelve red foxes. They paired them up in pens, hoping they would produce pups ‚Äì maybe a silver pup. No pups appeared that first year. The next year twelve red fox pups were born. A red fox pelt was worth $20 at the time ‚Äì far from the $1200 silver pelt they had read about. A pair of silver fox would be reasonably likely to produce silver pups, but a breeding pair cost about $35,000. They couldn't afford that, but a friendly dealer (James Kane) sold them a black fox and a red fox with silver ancestors for $550. This pair bore pups in 1912, but they were red. Kane sold them another similar breeding pair, but the male ate the female in shipment. They bought a replacement for that female, and in 1913 one of these pairs produced four red pups, and finally one silver! That year two of the brothers chiseled in the rock at the top of nearby Rib Mountain: John and Henry Fromm Pioneer Breeders of Silver Foxes 1913Lacey, p. 36-37 But still, they had only one true silver fox. The brothers decided that to get more silver fox, they must simply spend the money for more breeding animals. In 1915 James Kane had three silver fox available for $6,500. The ginseng hadn't produced that much money yet. While their father was gone to Iowa, the brothers talked their mother into borrowing the money for them. The family farm had been her dowry and was still in her name, so she mortgaged it, for $6,500. Unfortunately, a month later when the first World War began, the price of both furs and ginseng plummeted. Those three silver fox were suddenly worth only $1,000 and ginseng worth a third what it had been. But in the following months, while other fox breeders folded, the Fromms bought more breeding stock at low prices. The next year their farm produced seventeen silver fox pups, and 25 the next. By the end of the war, prices were rebounding and they were producing more and more pelts.Lacey, p. 38-39 While struggling with fox, the brothers also faced challenges in growing ginseng. When the seedlings got blight, they sprayed them with slaked lime and blue vitriol. By 1915 they had three acres of ginseng. To wash lots of roots in the fall, they powered a water pump with a car engine, and they initially dried the roots in their house's attic. For the labor-intensive planting and harvesting, they hired teen-aged men and women, and organized them into teams. When they needed forest loam for growing ginseng, they found that they could produce acceptable loam by plowing under green oats. In 1918, when their harvest had outgrown the house's attic, their father loaned them $1,500 to build a drying building, with a heating system and space for grinding fox food. (They had made him a believer.) When half the ginseng crop spoiled in that new building, they installed fans and split the processing into two phases. The successful ginseng harvest in 1915 helped pay off the mortgage on the farm. In 1919 their ginseng sold for $40,000, and they had become the biggest producer in the U.S.Lacey, p. 29-30 Success, and ongoing challenges In 1920 the Fromms' businessman-banker cousin John Nieman and his son Edwin partnered with them, investing in their company by buying silver fox breeding stock. In the same year, the Fromm brothers' sister Erna married Edwin Nieman, and the Fromms gave the couple ten pairs of silver fox as dowry. They moved twenty-four pairs of silver fox to the Nieman farm in Thiensville.Lacey, p. 40 The company was now called \\"Fromm Bros. Nieman Company.\\"Fromm Family Pet Food They noticed that the foxes in Thiensville generally produced larger litters, probably due to the gentler climate. On the other hand, the fox in Marathon county generally developed nicer pelts, probably due to the colder winter. Aware of this, the company moved all the breeding pairs to Thiensville and began trucking most of the young foxes up to Marathon County each fall for finishing.Lacey, p. 41 By 1922 the operation at Hamburg was employing so many people that they built the boarding house. In 1923 they built the dairy barn to feed their workers, and in 1924 the bunk house.Lacey, p. 42 Through the 1920s, the ginseng crops brought from $45,000 to $115,000 per year. The expanding operation needed more space, so the Fromms bought several neighboring farms. In 1921, Walter came up with a labor-saving way to spray the ginseng with a hose reel on a horse-drawn cart. From 1923 to 1926 their seeds rotted during germination, so they reverted to an earlier stratification technique. When their acreage grew too large for hand-planting, Walter and straw-boss Herbert Kleinschmidt constructed a semi-automated 13-row ginseng planter that could plant three acres per day.Lacey, p. 30-31 The brothers tinkered with the diet of the fox. In 1915 an outbreak of rickets had hit their animals. At that time they were feeding the fox a lot of horse meat, but after deboning it. Henry suspected that the lack of bones caused the rickets. They tried adding ground bones to the diet and the rickets problem faded. By 1922 they had diversified the diet to include beef, mutton, veal, woodchuck, rabbit, fish, eggs, milk, bread, vegetables, and fruit. They were careful about sanitation for their valuable fox. Over time, they decided that one feeding a day was sufficient.Lacey, p. 40-41 In 1924 and 1925 some of the fox got sick and died. After ruling out food poisoning, the Fromms suspected distemper, and funded investigation by Dr. Robert G. Green from the University of Minnesota. Over the course of a decade, Green found encephalitis in the fox herd and created a vaccine for it. He also found distemper among the fox, and developed a serum against it. It wasn't quite ready in 1938 when distemper began to rip through the Hamburg farm. In desperation, Green and the Fromms administered the not-quite-ready vaccine. It worked, stopping the epidemic. Green and the Fromms conducted this work through a venture that eventually became Fromm Labs, which patented these vaccines.Lacey, p. 43-44 In the 1930s the price of ginseng dropped due to the Great Depression and problems in China. Many other U.S. ginseng growers gave up on the crop, but Edward had visited China in 1930 and believed the market would rebound, so the Fromms stockpiled their harvest in barrels and continued to plant new acreage every year. Fourteen years later the Fromms were vindicated when World War II ended and the market for ginseng revived. They sold their stockpile for a million dollars, and planted more.Lacey, p. 31-32 Notes References  Category:Farms on the National Register of Historic Places in Wisconsin Category:Buildings and structures in Marathon County, Wisconsin Category:Farms in Wisconsin Category:National Register of Historic Places in Marathon County, Wisconsin ","title":"Fromm Brothers Fur and Ginseng Farm"},{"id":"45658765","text":"Stentor muelleri, also called a trumpet ciliate, is a single-celled eukaryote which feeds on algae.

When in 1724 the Melkite Greek Catholic Church was established, the three eparchies started gradually merged. The union ultimately came during the patriarchate of Maximos III Mazloum and was contextually erected from eparchy of Homs to Metropolitan Archeparchy on March 4, 1849, as the titles of the Melkite Catholic Archeparchy of Hama and Melkite Catholic Eparchy of Jabrud were formally united with the new Metropolitanate.

A variety of incidents with law enforcement in 1982 culminated when local sheriff's deputies and state law enforcement officers attempted to serve bench warrants for the arrest of three members of the church and a large group of church members confronted them. In the ensuing melee, two church members were killed and seven law enforcement officers were injured. One church member and one law enforcement officer died later, both deaths possibly due to injuries sustained that day. Christ Miracle Healing Center and Church The church was led by Pastor Frances Thomas, one of a reported 10,000 disciples of broadcasting evangelist A. A. Allen‚Äôs original Miracle Valley Bible Church (MVBC). Her son, William Thomas Jr., was a bishop and the church's theoretical leader.\\"Uneasy peace restored in Miracle Valley\\", Chicago Tribune, October 25, 1982. Retrieved 2015-03-12. Thomas attempted to purchase the 2,560-acre property and its numerous buildings that were previously home to Allen‚Äôs MVBC, with plans to re-establish the original church under her leadership. However, the owners at the time were prohibited from selling this property, situated on the south side of Arizona State Route 92 that bisects Miracle Valley. Therefore, Thomas instead purchased several properties for the church's use in the subdivision along the north side of the highway across from the MVBC, including a restaurant that was converted to a church sanctuary.\\"Miracle Valley ‚Äì 1982 Gun Fight\\". Retrieved 2015-03-06. The church (whose congregation, clergy, and staff were entirely African American) was Pentecostal in teachings and outlook, but not affiliated with any established denomination. Specifically and controversially, Thomas stated she was a believer in faith healing only and not in doctors.\\"Was the land of promise bad trip for Chicagoans?\\", The Chicago Sun Times, September 18, 1982, Pp. 1 and 12.

Her followers came to Miracle Valley in two distinct groups: the first (arriving between 1978 and 1979), composed of followers who lived in Mississippi, and the second (arriving in 1980), who had moved from Mississippi to Chicago. The church was reported by sheriff's deputies to operate services almost continuously around the clock. Special assistants or watchers in the service were observed to ensure attendees didn't fall asleep by striking people's heads with long poles. Children who were church members and attended local schools were observed by their teachers to be suffering from what appeared to be severe sleep-deprivation.Daniel, p. 38. Local residents and relatives of church members claimed she exerted a \\"cult-like dominance over her followers\\" and described church members as having \\"pledged their lives in cult-like devotion to Mother Thomas\\".\\"Is There Another Jonestown Brewing at Miracle Valley?\\", Chicago Sun-Times article in The Montreal Gazette, October 7, 1981.

The local sheriff reported that Thomas referenced the Jim Jones massacre in Guyana, stating, \\"If you think Jonestown was a picnic, you ain't seen nothing yet\\" and \\"We already have the punch made.\\"Daniel, p. 42. Background In 1978, the first group of Healing Center and Church members from Mississippi began arriving in the community. During 1978 and into 1979, interactions between the existing, mostly white residents of this area of rural Cochise County and nearby community of Palominas and the entirely African American church members from Mississippi were peaceful and friendly. However, once Pastor Thomas and the Chicago church members began to arrive starting in 1980, the previously peaceful relationships between the congregation and residents - both of whom were followers of A.A. Allen, who was an advocate of racial reconciliation - disintegrated into mutual distrust. Following one or more minor burglaries of church-members' homes, in 1980 the church established an armed security force that patrolled church properties and local roads, and established roadblocks on the state highway. Bishop Thomas, who was in charge of these patrols, reportedly called them \\"Commandos for Christ\\" and \\"Soldiers for Jesus\\". Patrols communicated by CB radio and used code to describe people and situations.Daniel, p. 50. In July 1981, sheriff's deputies attempting to arrest a church member were surrounded by a group of church members and forced to retreat. The county sheriff's department began integrated patrols with Department of Public Safety officers. The following month, a confrontation between deputies trying to make an arrest and armed church members prompted the sheriff's department to make a massive show of force. Sheriff Judd said it was intended to show \\"no one is above the law.\\" By autumn, the situation was described by the sheriff as \\"a fight for control\\" with no end in sight; by the county supervisor \\"the best we can hope for is an uneasy truce\\"; by a sheriff's deputy as \\"we're outgunned and outmanned\\"; and by a local resident \\"it's going to end in death\\". Racial tensions and lawsuit Racial tensions between church members, and other local residents and law enforcement, were evident in Miracle Valley. Residents noted this developed, not when the early group of church members arrived in 1978-79 from Mississippi, but only after Thomas and her Chicago-based followers arrived in 1980. Both church members and leaders, as well as local residents, accused the other of racism, through words, attitudes, or actions.\\"Church Members say Adios to Miracle Valley\\", The Courier, May 24, 1983. Retrieved 2015-03-06. Thomas was reported to have a hostile approach to those who were not members of CMHCC, in particular law enforcement officials, who reported she addressed them as \\"white boy\\".Daniel, p. 76. The regional commander of the Arizona Department of Public Safety stated that Sheriff Judd \\"asked the governor for a tank to go into the Valley to annihilate those niggers.\\"Wecht & Saitz, p. 172. A federal judge ruled that the sheriff's department was riddled with racism: \\"It seems to me that everyone in Cochise County was going to get their licks against the church one way or another.\\" Wecht & Saitz, p. 184. \\"Children at Play\\" signs were erected by the county, at the request of the church. On the signs were cartoon stereotypes of distinctly African American children. The children's clothing carried the letters \\"A\\" and \\"N\\", which Thomas interpreted as referring to \\"asshole\\" and \\"nigger\\". The signs were removed. Allegations of official racism were raised during the 1984 trial, including a flier that referred to 'blacks as \\"porch monkeys\\" 'that was pinned up on a sheriff's station bulletin board.\\"Long Awaited Miracle Valley Trial Under Way\\", The Courier, January 9, 1984.

Negotiations Negotiations between sheriff deputies and church leaders to effect the surrender of church members wanted for arrest were undertaken on several occasions. In one instance, the governor became directly involved. These situations arose after the deputies would try to arrest, serve warrants, or issue traffic tickets to church members who would flee into church property. Once there they would either go into hiding or church members would arrive en masse, surround, and sometimes attack the officers. At varying times church leaders intervened to either turn over the wanted persons, or they refused. At these times, under pressure from the sheriff's office and officials from the State Department of Public Safety, negotiations with church leaders were held. Deaths of church children In 1981 the deaths of four children of church members came to the attention of state officials. State officials said the four children, in particular 6-year old Theriel Drew who died of strangulated hernia after four days of agonized screaming, might have survived had the church members not refused to administer medical treatment, citing their belief in faith healing. Authorities tried to place other children there under state supervision.\\"Church's dream of building oasis drys up following Oct. 23 shoot out\\", Ben Bradlee Jr., The Boston Globe, printed in The Courier December 19, 1982.

Sherman McCane attack On September 7, 1981, sheriff's deputies entered church property and found a large and angry group of church-members surrounding a pick-up truck with two occupants. The crowd, estimated by the deputies to number over fifty, were waving weapons (pipes, steel rebar, clubs, pistols, and rifles) and shouting threats at the truck's occupants. One of the truck's occupants yelled racial epithets at the crowd, inflaming tempers. The deputies moved in to protect the occupants and one church member, Sherman McCane, punched one of the deputies twice.Daniel, pp. 93‚Äì94. Additional deputies arrived and the pickup truck was allowed to depart before the deputies left. The County Attorney issued an arrest warrant for McCane and he was arrested on charges of assaulting an officer. He was also charged with carrying a concealed weapon, which was discovered at the time of his arrest. On September 10, two church members, William Thomas Jr. and Dorothy Collins, arrived at the Sierra Vista sheriff's substation demanding to see McCane. Collins was arrested for carrying an illegal weapon. Van explosion On September 10, 1981, a homemade bomb accidentally detonated in a 12-passenger van as it headed on Hwy 92 from Miracle Valley towards Sierra Vista. The van was owned by a William Thomas Jr. Passenger and church member Steven Lindsey was killed instantly when the bomb detonated while on his lap. Three other passengers were injured, all of whom left the scene before law enforcement officers arrived. The highway was closed for a full day while investigations were conducted by local and federal officials. Three undetonated bombs were found in the van's remains, one with 6 sticks of dynamite, as well as batteries, fuses, and wires.\\"Bombs Discovered in Wrecked Van\\", The Courier, September 11, 1981.

Records of a nearby dynamite company and newspaper articles at the time quoted unidentified sources indicated that church members bought the dynamite found in the van. Thomas stated the church members did not know how to make a bomb and that the dynamite was purchased for a church-owned mine.\\"Racial Problems Polarize a Town\\", The New York Times, October 11, 1981.

It was speculated that the occupants of the van were on their way to Sierra Vista to release church member Sherman McCane by blowing up vehicles as a distraction before blowing out the wall of the station where he was being held on charges of assault and carrying a concealed weapon. Removal of children In late 1981 Lester Triplett contacted authorities in Arizona in attempt to retrieve his four children whom had been spirited away from their Mississippi home by his daughter, Susie Mae McCane (wife of Sherman McCane). Triplett was their legal guardian and his daughter had misrepresented her guardianship and fraudulently enrolled them in the local school. The school suspended the students and several more when similar questions about their guardianship became known. The children were then home-schooled at the church.\\"The Miracle Valley Case\\", Mohave Daily Miner, January 15, 1984. Retrieved 2015-03-11. When deputies tried to enforce a court order to retrieve three of the children from the church, they were surrounded by a group of church members while the children were removed. After tense negotiations with Pastor Thomas, the children were released to the custody of their father. While retrieving Lora Triplett from her high school, church students surrounded and violently attacked the deputies. Seven were arrested. After a court hearing, Triplett was given permission to take his four children back to Mississippi. Susie Mae McCane was later charged with and acquitted of perjury regarding this matter. High school riot/melee On April 19, 1982, a clash occurred between two groups of students at the local Buena High School, church members and non-church members. Police arrested a church member for assaulting a female bystander. The student was charged with felony assault. The next day a group of 20 church members, including both students and William Thomas Jr. (Pastor Thomas' son), reportedly entered school grounds looking for the group of white students from the previous day's altercation. Approximately 12 police and sheriff's deputies arrived. While attempting to make an arrest, they were attacked by the church members and one deputy rendered unconscious.

It is a pest of faba beans (Vicia faba L.). The adult beetles feed on pollen, while their larvae tunnel in seeds destroying crops and moving on to new ones once they dry out. The adult beetle, being one of the biggest of its genus, ranges from 3 to 5 mm in length.  Biology  The broad bean beetle, B. rufimanus is univoltine. It reproduces in spring in faba bean crops, lays eggs on the young pods, develops in the growing seeds and overwinters as adults in shelters, or in diapause as larva or pupa diapause in the stored seeds.  Overwintering  Adults are in reproductive diapause and overwinter in protected sites such as under tree barks, particularly of old, standing trees, hedgerows, lichen, and in forests or leaf litter. At early spring, they can be observed feeding on pollen and nectar of nearby flowers and particularly on Fabacae and Vicia spp.. Some B. rufimanus can survive during winter in larval or pupal diapause inside the seeds and terminate their diapause, finish their post-embryonic growth and emerge from the seeds after sowing.  Field colonization, mobility and sexual maturity  Males‚Äô sexual maturation is triggered by an increased proportion of light in the photoperiod, such that they are sexually mature when they colonize the field when the crop reaches leaf development. More specifically, a day length of 16h is required for the beetles to terminate their reproductive diapause. An optimal day length of 18h is found to induce diapause termination. Females are still in reproductive diapause when they colonize the field once crops reach flowering stage and day temperature reach 20 ¬∞C. They become sexually mature in a few days, as a result of both an increased duration of photophase and the ingestion of faba bean pollen and nectar (Tran and Huignard 1993). Adults are extremely mobile during the day, and find refuge in resting sites in flowers and young leaves at night and early morning. They migrate from crop to crop following flower availability. Field density can vary. In France, numbers are around 20 adults/100 plants at the beginning of the colonization and 150 adults/100 plants at population peak when pressure is high. Fields near overwintering sites such as woody and herbaceous environment, and storage facilities, present increased risk of B. rufimanus colonization, particularly in areas with high infestation the precedent year.  Mating and ovoposition  Once males and females are both sexually mature, mating is spread over a few weeks. Insects are active when temperature reaches 20 ¬∞C; temperatures above 25 ¬∞C are very favorable to their activity in the field whereas colder temperatures below 15 ¬∞C and wet weather limit insect mobility. Once fertilized, females B. rufimanus lay eggs on developing pods of faba beans. Rain, wind and temperatures below 20 ¬∞C put on hold the oviposition process. Eggs are laid predominantly on the lowest parts of the plant. Eggs are small (< 2mm diameter), white-yellowish. A maximum of ten eggs per pod is observed. Females lay between 50 and 100 eggs. Rain might increase egg mortality.  Larval development and adult emergence  After about 10 days (1‚Äì3 weeks depending on temperatures), larvae hatch and bore directly throughout the pod walls and develop within the seed. Larvae are thus protected from biological and chemical control. Larval development lasts two to three months. Before entering its pupal stage, the larva cuts a circular cap. After around ten days of pupal stage, the adult emerges from the seeds. Because mating and oviposition are spread over a few weeks, adults can emerge before or after harvest.  Effect on faba beans  Although B. rufimanus does not directly affect faba bean yield, it alters the aesthetic quality of the seeds as well as its germinative properties and ensuing yield is therefore an issue for human consumption and seed markets. A maximum 3% damage threshold is set for seeds targeting market for human consumption. Damaged seeds (seeds from which adults have emerged) might have lower germination rates with 13% reduced germination observed in the lab, but no difference observed in the field. Yield from infested beans are lower (-45% to -70%) than for healthy ones (Epperlein, 1992). In addition, damaged seeds have increased susceptibility to rust and root diseases. Additionally, the presence of living insects on seeds are an issue for the export market as no living insects are allowed for export. The presence of beetles in the seeds after harvest thereby decreases faba bean commercial value.  Management options  The larval stages of B. rufimanus occur inside the seeds, and are therefore protected from any control measures, including chemical control. Bruchus rufimanus is most vulnerable at the adult stage. Most control measures have therefore targeted adults either at colonization stage in the field or at emergence in storage facilities. Control measures have been focused on direct control with insecticides, but restrictions and removal from market due to environmental concerns have increased the need for alternative measures.  Monitoring  Because of their larval development inside the seeds which are protected by the pods, most inventorying methods are based on population of B. rufimanus adult in the field or at emergence. Adult population density can be estimated by counts on plants at field colonization. The development semiochemical attractants trapping systems for both monitoring and pest control has received particular interest in ongoing research on the beetle. Egg density can be estimated on young developing pods (>2 cm) during the oviposition period. Eggs are however small (<1mm length), green-yellowish, therefore difficult to observe. In addition, population estimate are difficult to obtain as egg laying is spread over time until 5‚Äì10 days after the end of flowering (BBCH 77). After harvest, seed quality can be observed manually at harvest and characterized according to pest damage (healthy, with no trace of damage/containing developing larvae/trace of emerged B. rufimanus adult (a hole in the seed). Alternative methods exist to sort the seeds: sorting can be done using differences in seed density due to the presence of the developing larva or of the hole left by the emerged adult, estimation of damages seeds can be done by tomography analysis. Additionally, the end of larval and pupal diapause and therefore the emergence of B. rufimanus can be induced via a solution of NaOCl and chinosol in 7 days at 30 ¬∞C, allowing the estimation of an overall infestation rate can be assessed.  Control methods  = Chemical control = In Europe, pyrethroids and neonicotinoids have been used against B. rufimanus. Because of the faba bean crop biology and its attraction to pollinators at flowering stage, restrictions on pesticides uses have been introduced in Europe. It is particularly advised to spray in absence of pollinators in the early morning and evening. In addition, due to B. rufimanus' biology, a temperature threshold combined with crop development stage can be used to increase the success of chemical treatments. Adult B. rufimanus activity increases with temperature, so that treatment efficiency might increase when maximum day temperatures are over 20¬∞C during four consecutive days after treatment (Arvalis, 2016). Adult B. rufimanus activity increases with temperature, so that treatment efficiency might increase when maximum day temperatures are over 20¬∞C during four consecutive days after treatment. The end of blooming indicates the end of adult activity in the field. This stage is therefore a threshold marking the end of insecticide application and occurs no later than five days after last blooming. Forecasting systems (Bruchi-LIS, Arvalis, France and BruchidCast, Syngenta, UK) have been developed to optimize insecticide applications based on temperature and crop stage. = Other methods = * Traps based on semiochemical attractants are being developed targeting adults at field colonization. * Recent work has highlighted the potential of entomopathogenic fungi to control B. rufimanus. * Recent work has highlighted the repellent and insecticidal properties of botanical oils against B. rufimanus and their potential to be used in pest management.  Direct control in storage facilities  Although the measures taken in storage facilities do not decrease the proportion of damaged seeds, they limit the densities of emerging insects and therefore the pressure for the coming year. Such measures will be especially efficient in storage as most B. rufimanus have then not yet emerged and are still developing in the seeds. Early harvest could therefore be recommended for best control measures in storage facilities. * Warm air : Exposition of seeds to warm air (50 to 70¬∞C, depending on duration) kills B. rufimanus developing into the seeds at the same time it lowers water content. However, warmth can decrease germination rates of the seeds and degrade the visual aspect and the protein content of the seeds, which would be problematic for the seed market. * Fumigation and insecticide use: Fumigants and insecticides (e.g., K-Obiol¬Æ ULV 6 (Pyrethroid, Bayer, Germany), in France) can be used against B. rufimanus in storage facilities. Fumigation requires tightly sealed storage facilities. * Trapping of newly emerged insects: By sealing the storage facilities, newly emerged adults from seeds could be prevented from escaping to their overwintering sites to decrease the pest pressure at the next season. B. rufimanus could then be trapped and later killed, e.g., by fire. Healthy and damaged seeds can be sorted using an optic sorter. Additionally, a storage extended over two years enables all developing B. rufimanus to emerge before sowing and therefore avoids emergence in the field from contaminated seeds.  Preventive control methods  The pressure from B. rufimanus seems unaffected by management practices and cultivar although little data is available. Because B. rufimanus biology is highly linked to crop development and climatic conditions, pest damage and pressure the next year can vary according to sowing and harvesting date. In addition, sanitation can help decreasing the source of B. rufimanus in production areas. Biological control Parasitoids have been found to parasitize B. rufimanus eggs: Chremylus rubiginosus and Triaspis thoracicus (family: Braconidae), and Dinarmus acutus (family: Pteromalidae). Their larvae develop into B. rufimanus larvae and adults emerge from the seed, leaving a small emergence hole in the seed (smaller than for B. rufimanus). Generalist predators on faba bean leaves such as spiders might feed on B. rufimanus eggs and contribute to their biological control although no data was found on their potential impact on the population size or growth.

Usman was on the United States' Rewards for Justice Program list, which offered $1 million for his capture. Early life Usman was born in 1974 in Labo-Labo, a village in Shariff Aguak, Maguindanao, in the southern Philippines. He worked as an overseas Filipino in Pakistan before engaging in militant activities. Militant activity Usman was implicated in the FitMart Mall bombing in General Santos on 21 April 2002, which killed at least 15 people and injured 55 others. Several weeks later, he was arrested and accused of assembling the bomb. He was interrogated and imprisoned at the Sarangani Provincial Police Station, but was made a minimum-security detainee for good behavior. His cell was not locked, and he escaped in October 2002. Upon his escape, Usman joined Tahir Alonto, a former commander of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front whom the military had accused of leading the Pentagon gang, a kidnap-for-ransom group. Usman later offered to turn himself in. Senior Inspector Aucelito Cabang, who was Usman's custodial officer, entered Alonto's territory with three other officers to arrest Usman, but was killed in what turned out to be a trap. Usman would later be linked to a bombing at the public market of Tacurong on 10 October 2006, which injured four people, and to the Cotabato City bombings on 5 and 7 January 2007, which killed two people and injured three others. On 14 January 2010, Usman was incorrectly reported to have been killed along with several others in an American drone strike in Pakistan that targeted the Pakistani Taliban leader, Hakimullah Mehsud. Later, he was also reported to have been killed in a series of military shellings in Maguindanao. Usman later resurfaced, and in June 2014, government officials warned that he was planning a bombing in Davao City. On 25 January 2015, he was one of two targets in the Mamasapano clash in Mindanao. His companion Zulkifli Abdhir, the other target, was killed in the raid, but Usman escaped and fled into the Liguasan Marsh. The military and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front launched offensives to find and capture him, with President Aquino vowing, \\"We will get Usman.\\"  Death  Usman was killed in an encounter with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front on 3 May 2015 in Guindulungan, Maguindanao.

It was established in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in February 2011. Inspired by free and open-source projects, the vision of Sensorica has been to devise an appropriate business model and support infrastructure to make such forms of production economically sustainable. Sensorica is arguably more complex than a traditional enterprise. It is a productive network that is simultaneously a commons-based community, as well as a market-oriented entity. On one hand, individuals and organizations pool resources to initiate projects, driven primarily by intrinsic motivations, rather than financial rewards. On the other hand, the innovative solutions developed in Sensorica are introduced to the market to generate income by ‚Äúexchange firms‚Äù, i.e. independent internal or external entities which undertake marketing and logistics operations while being liable for maintaining ethical and quality standards of the solutions. Sensorica identifies itself as a new type of organization, which is referred as an Open Value Network (OVN). An OVN is a generic organizational and business model, which could possibly enhance and support commons-based peer production. As an organization it is highly adaptive, fully decentralized, and governed through distributed decision-making processes and resource allocation. As the name implies, it supports open participation, has very low barriers of entry, and is designed to empower permissionless individual action through open knowledge and transparent processes. Sensorica uses the Resources, events, agents (accounting model) as a basis of its network resource planning and contribution / value accounting system (NRP-VAS). The NRP is an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) type of software based on the REA model to support the complexity of operations in an OVN. It collects, stores, and interprets data from all the different types of activities in the network and connects them to specific resources, events, and agents to keep track of the contributed value on resource level. In NRP, everything is connected together. Economic agents are associated with other agents and participate in events of various types, such as processes, exchanges, or transfers. Events change the state of resources by using, citing, consuming, creating, or transferring them. A certain resource may be an output from one event and then an input to another one. Those events are then again connected with a resource flow. The advent of blockchain technology and Ethereum facilitates the OVN model proposed by SENSORICA. It is featured in the documentary movie.

He is also the founder of the music collective TeamSESH. O'Connor is widely regarded as one of the most influential artists in the internet's underground hip-hop scene. Since 2010, O'Connor has released an extensive discography and developed a large fan base. As of 2019, he has released over 80 albums, mixtapes and EPs across several aliases. Early life Elmo Kennedy O'Connor was born in Marin County, California, to a mother who designed clothing and a father who was a web designer. His maternal grandfather was actor Robert Culp. His family lived in Muir Beach, California, before moving to New York City. When O'Connor was seven years old, his family moved to Howell, Michigan. O'Connor also lived in Minnesota for two years when he was thirteen. Around this time he met fellow artists Xavier Wulf, Chris Travis, and Eddy Baker online. The four artists would later come together to form the collective Seshollowaterboyz. When he was 16, he dropped out of Howell High School and moved to Los Angeles, where his brother and current manager, Elliott, had already been living. Despite moving away from his parents at a young age, O'Connor speaks positively of them, stating, \\"If I tried to write a book about, 'oh, what would be dream parents?', I couldn't even make anything better than them. All they do is shower me in love. Unconditional love, forever.\\" O'Connor describes Howell as a \\"mundane\\" place where its residents are \\"born and they die there\\", also calling it \\"one of the most racist towns in Michigan\\". Musical career O'Connor first started making music at the age of nine after his father purchased an iMac G3. He would download hip-hop instrumentals from SoundClick and use the computer's built-in microphone to record himself rapping, though it wasn't until 2010 at the age of 16 that he would start releasing music online under the alias \\"Th@ Kid\\". After moving to Los Angeles, O'Connor was able to connect with other artists he met online including Xavier Wulf, Chris Travis, and Eddy Baker, who at the time were members of the now semi-disbanded Raider Klan. He later officially changed his stage name to Bones in 2012. On July 4, 2012, O'Connor released his eponymous debut album under the alias \\"BONES\\". From 2012 to 2014 he released 12 albums before gaining journalistic attention for his 2014 album TeenWitch, which gained controversy for its themes based around the Columbine High School Massacre. The album following TeenWitch, titled Garbage was released on June 9, 2014 and was the first of O'Connors albums to gain the attention of major music publications such as Complex Magazine and The Fader who labelled the project as \\"massive\\" and \\"boundary-pushing.\\" In April 2014, O'Connor, along with TeamSESH producer GREAF formed \\"surrenderdorothy\\", a side project that is notably less focused on rap, with a stronger focus on acoustic guitar and singing, with stylistic similarities to indie rock and emo rap. Although O'Connor does experiment with this style in his solo work, surrenderdorothy features it much more predominantly. Since 2014, the duo have released 6 EP's as surrenderdorothy. O'Connor uploaded several albums in 2015 and headlined his first sold out show at House of Blues on March 4, 2015 before opening for electronic artist Shlohmo at The Fonda Theatre. O'Connor was later featured on ASAP Rocky's \\"Canal St.\\" which was a remix of O'Connor's song \\"Dirt.\\" The song later became O'Connor's first feature on the Billboard charts. Bones performed \\"Canal St.\\" with ASAP Rocky on the Jimmy Kimmel Live! show, but was cut from the TV broadcast due to him refusing to censor some of the song's lyrics while performing. Videos of the performance were made available online. In May 2015, O'Connor and GREAF started releasing songs under a second side project called \\"OREGONTRAIL\\". The project is stylistically similar to surrenderdorothy, but has been noted as having a \\"darker\\" and \\"rougher\\" tone. Since 2015, the duo have released 7 singles as OREGONTRAIL. O'Connor released 10 albums between 2015 and 2017 and on January 19, 2018, O'Connor performed in KOKO, London, thus starting his first ever European tour, called the Deadboy Tour.Deadboy Tour It took him to countries such as Germany, Ukraine, Russia and Italy. O'Connor is one of the four members in the collective SESHOLLOWATERBOYZ , which consists of himself, Xavier Wulf, Chris Travis, and Eddy Baker, with whom he often performs and collaborates. He has also released music with fellow TeamSESH members, possibly most notably with producer GREAF, who, with O'Connor, form the side projects surrenderdorothy and OREGONTRAIL. Major label interest O'Connor and his manager/brother Elliott have both stated that major labels have shown interest in signing him. According to Max Bell of LA Weekly, \\"interested labels wanted him to be their 'white rapper,' an artist along the lines of Mac Miller and Machine Gun Kelly. But O'Connor wasn't interested in being remade.\\" Musical style and influences Although O'Connor is often considered to be one of the pioneers of the emo rap sub-genre, O'Connor has said that he has no specific genre, though has been characterized as cloud rap, experimental hip-hop and \\"shadow rap\\". O'Connor's earlier music is a lot more futuristic (and is often compared to SpaceGhostPurrp's) than his current music, which showcases production and vocal styles ranging from rapping, singing, and screaming. O'Connors singing has been compared to grunge and emo, while his rapping has been compared sub- genres such as horrorcore and emo rap. He is also considered an early pioneer of trap metal. O'Connor rarely talks about his musical influences, although during interviews he has mentioned Marvin Gaye, Earth Wind and Fire, Bootsy Collins, Stevie Nicks and Joni Mitchell as influences. Over the years of his music career, O'Connor helped underground hip hop develop into new styles and has been noted as \\"one of the most influential underground artists of the internet age\\".  Personal life  O'Connor resides in Glendale, California with his fianc√©e Samantha Strysko, whom he met at Disneyland. In March 2019, O'Connor announced that he and Strysko were expecting their first child. On 19 August 2019, the child was born and was named Howl Timothy O‚ÄôConnor.

Two of her paintings are part of the Dunster Castle collection, now property of the National Trust. She was the heiress of Dunster Castle, under the stipulation in her father's will that her husband should take the additional surname of Luttrell. Four portraits of her exist in Dunster castle and a fifth at Bathealton Court. Early life Dunster Castle in 1733, showing the then recently planted New Way, the mansion (l), Great Gatehouse (c) and stables (r). The motte, with the summer house, is visible in the background Margaret Luttrell was born on 7 February 1726, the only child and sole heiress of Alexander Luttrell (1705‚Äì1737) of Dunster Castle by his wife Margaret Trevelyan (died 1764), daughter of Sir John Trevelyan, 2nd Baronet of Nettlecombe, Somerset, and an artist who made floral paintings. Margaret's father died on 4 June 1737 at Dunster, at which time he was in debt, \\"due in part to his personal extravagance and in part to the necessity imposed upon him by his parents of providing a fortune of ¬£10,000 for Anne Luttrell,\\" daughter of his deceased brother Francis Luttrell (1709‚Äì1732) of Venn, Somerset, and wife of Edward Pleydell. As a result, Dunster Castle was thrown into Chancery and closed. In 1741 Margaret's mother remarried to Edward Dyke of Pixton and Tetton in Somerset, and young Margaret was raised with two girls in her mother's care. One was her first cousin, Anne Luttrell, and the other was Elizabeth Dyke, Edward Dyke's cousin. The family lived at Edward Dyke's houses, Pixton and Tetton. A \\"moderate sum\\" was expended on her education, which included music lessons, and care. Margaret Trevelyan died in 1764. Marriage and progeny On 16 February 1747, when she came of age, in Kingston St Mary Church she married her second cousin Henry Fownes (d.1780) of Nethway House, Kingswear (historically in Brixham), Devon. Both shared as a great-grandfather Edward Yard (1638‚Äì1703) of Churston Ferrers, MP for Ashburton in 1685, who himself was a grandson of Thomas Fownes (d.1635), Mayor of Plymouth in 1619.

On their marriage Dunster Castle became the property of her husband (married women in England were legally incapable of owning property until 1882), who adopted the additional surname Luttrell after his own, and adopted the Luttrell arms (but continued to quarter Fownes), in accordance with a stipulation in Alexander Luttrell's will. They moved into Dunster Castle and updated the interior with Chinese painted wallpaper and new furniture in a Rococo style. New windows were installed in the stair hall and dining room. The marriage was a happy one and resulted in the birth of ten children, including: *John Fownes Luttrell (1752‚Äì1816), eldest son and heir, of Dunster Castle, MP for Minehead (1776‚Äì1816), the Luttrell pocket borough adjacent to Dunster Castle; *Lieutenant Henry Fownes-Luttrell (1753‚Äì1777), 2nd son, who died unmarried. *Rev.

The creek drains roughly 91.97 square miles into the two counties of south central Indiana. P1290073 Bloomington Pony Truss History Beanblossom Creek was named for a pioneer named Beanblossom, who almost drowned when swimming across the swollen creek. A dam was constructed on Beanblossom Creek in the 1950s, forming Lake Lemon. Earlier, a smaller Griffy Lake has been created by a dam impounding Griffy Creek, one of Beanblossom Creek's tributaries. Pollution From September to October 2001, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management conducted a comprehensive survey of the Beanblossom Creek Watershed. Escherichia coli bacteria (E. coli bacteria) was found to be the primary impairment, as well as 15 other pollutants. The E. coli bacteria was declared to have come from a variety of sources, including but not limited to animal agriculture, urban and rural runoff, home sewage treatment, and sewer overflow. The Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) report for the Beanblossom Creek Watershed was approved by the Environmental Protection Agency on April 2, 2006. Solutions, including manure management and storm water controls, were proposed in the report. Conservation To commemorate the state of Indiana's 200th anniversary in 2016, then-governor Mitch Daniels started the Bicentennial Nature Trust. The state program, a $30 million trust for to buy land for conservation purposes, allocated $1 million for land in northern Monroe county around Beanblossom Creek. The trust established the Beanblossom Creek Bicentennial Conservation Area, protecting the Beanblossom Bottoms Nature Preserve, the Lake Griffy Nature Preserve, and a section of the Morgan-Monroe state forest in the hopes of improving water quality and other conservation goals. Covered Bridge Fire In 1976, a fire destroyed the historic covered bridge over Beanblossom Creek, which dated back to the 1880s. The bridge was the only one of its kind in all of Monroe County. Construction started in the fall of 2018 and the project is set to finish in May 2019. The $1.6 million project is 80% funded by the Federal government. 30% of the lumber for the reconstruction comes from another Indiana covered bridge, Cedar Ford Bridge of Shelby, which was erected in 1885 and taken down in 1975.

There was no express disposition of the income of the trust funds during the remainder of the wife's life after her husband's death. In 1883 Harold Reeves consulted Hugh Browne, a solicitor in partnership with his brother Arthur Browne, as to the security of the trust funds then in the hands of James Walker and Bernard E. James, the original trustees. It was arranged that James Walker should retire, and Arthur Robert Reeves (father of the actor Kynaston Reeves) be appointed in his place, and, as his solicitor, Hugh Browne obtained, in June 1884, an examination of the securities alleged by Bernard James to represent the trust funds. Hugh Browne came to the conclusion that they were forgeries. Under judicious pressure Bernard James was induced from time to time to pay all the trust funds by installments into a bank in the joint names of himself and Arthur Robert Reeves, the proposed new trustee, and from time to time to draw moneys out of this account for the purpose of investment upon mortgages found by Hugh Browne. In February and March 1884 sums amounting to ¬£9200 were so drawn out and invested by Hugh Browne, as he alleged, at the instigation and with the approval of Harold Reeves, Mrs. Reeves, and Arthur Robert Reeves, upon the mortgage of houses in course of erection by speculative builders. In May 1884 Arthur Robert Reeves and Marian Reeves were appointed trustees of the settlement in place of James Walker and Bernard James. In 1885 Harold Reeves died, leaving two children, and before the commencement of this action Ellen Jane Reeves married William Patrick Mara. This action was commenced on the 7th Nov. 1890 by Ellen Jane Mara and her two infant children, Arthur Robert Reeves and Marian Reeves, against Hugh Browne and Arthur Browne, to make them liable for the losses which had resulted from the investments on builders‚Äô mortgages. The issue of the writ was more than six years after the date of the last mortgage complained of, but less than six years after the death of Harold Reeves. Issues Judgment High Court Held, on the evidence, that Hugh Browne had made himself responsible as trustee for the investments, and not merely acted as agent for the trustees ; that he had acted for the firm throughout, and therefore Michael Browne was liable as his partner ; that Mrs. Mara had not requested or instigated the improper investments within the meaning of the Trustee Act 1893, s. 45, and her interest could not be impounded. Held also, that, if the settlement had given Mrs. Mara an interest for life, the Statute of Limitations would have barred her action, but that, as the settlement only gave her an interest during the joint lives of herself and her husband, and her present interest was the life estate by way of resulting trust which came into her possession only on her husband's death, the statute did not begin to run against her until his death, and her action was not barred. It was decided by North, J. (72 L. T. Rep. 765) that the defendants were liable. Court of Appeal Hugh Browne in all that he did acted in the capacity of solicitor for one of the two trustees, whose directions as to investments were accepted or acted on by the other; that under these circumstances he could not be made liable as a constructive trustee: and that it was too late to make him liable as solicitor. Held also, that it was not within the scope of the implied authority of a partner in a solicitor's business to constitute himself a constructive trustee so as to bind a partner and make him also liable as a constructive trustee, although he was not aware of the dealings by which the constructive trust was established. Held, (reversing the decision of North, J., [1895] 2 Ch. 69), therefore, that neither of the defendants could be held liable as a constructive trustee, and that the appeal must be allowed, and the action dismissed with costs.

He kicked 60 goals for the Under 19s in his first season and captained the side in 1983. During this time he was also a Victorian Teal Cup representative. He played reserves football in 1984, then made his senior debut in the opening round of the 1985 VFL season and made a total of 11 league appearances that year. Still living in Altona in 1985, McAsey made the move to Sydney the following year. The 1986 season didn't begin for McAsey until round 20, when he called into the side to play Richmond at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He kicked three goals in a 48-point win, which he followed up with four goals from a forward pocket when Sydney defeated St Kilda in round 21. His final two games of the season were both against Fitzroy, the second in a semi-final. A back injury caused McAsey to miss the entire season in 1987 and he played only two league games in 1988. He managed 10 games in 1989, then four in 1990, before being delisted. Sydney however redrafted in the 1991 pre- season and he added a further three games to his tally. In six seasons of league football he had four different numbers on his guernsey over the source of his career, 46, 12, 33 and 50.

The period before the annexation was marked by Russian interference in Crimean affairs, a series of revolts by Crimean Tatars, and Ottoman ambivalence. The annexation began 134 years of rule by the Russian Empire, which was ended by the revolution of 1917. After changing hands several times during the Russian Civil War, Crimea was part of the Russian Soviet Republic from 1921 to 1954, and then was transferred to the Ukrainian SSR, which became independent Ukraine in 1991‚Äì92. The Russian Federation annexed Crimea in March 2014, though that annexation is not recognised internationally. Prelude Independent Crimea (1774‚Äì76) Before Russia defeated the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish War of 1768‚Äì1774, the Khanate, populated largely by Crimean Tatars, had been part of the Ottoman Empire. In the Treaty of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca, which was the result of that war, the Ottoman Empire was forced to cede sovereignty over the Khanate, and allow it to become an independent state under Russian influence. Tatars in Crimea had no desire for independence, and held a strong emotional attachment to the Ottoman Empire. Within two months of the signing of the treaty, the government of the Khanate sent envoys to the Ottomans, asking them to \\"destroy the conditions of independence\\". The envoys said that as Russian troops remained stationed in Crimea at Yeni-Kale and Kerch, the Khanate could not be considered independent. Nevertheless, the Ottomans ignored this request, not wishing to violate the agreement with Russia. In the disorder that followed the Turkish defeat, Tatar leader Devlet Giray refused to accept the treaty at the time of its signing. Having been fighting Russians in the Kuban during the war, he crossed the Kerch Strait to Crimea and seized the city of Kaffa (modern Feodosia). Devlet subsequently seized the Crimean throne, usurping Sahib Giray. Despite his actions against the Russians, Russian Empress Catherine the Great recognised Devlet as Khan. At the same time, however, she was grooming her favourite ≈ûahin Giray, who resided at her court, for the role. As time went on, the rule of Devlet became increasingly untenable. In July 1775, he sent a group of envoys to Constantinople to negotiate a reentry of the Crimean Khanate into the Ottoman Empire. This action was in direct defiance of the Treaty of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca, which he asked the Ottomans to scrap. Famed diplomat Ahmed Resm√Æ Efendi, who had helped draft the treaty, refused to provide any assistance to the Khanate, not wanting to start another disastrous war with Russia. Empress Catherine gave an order to invade Crimea in November 1776. Her forces quickly gained control of Perekop, at the entrance to the peninsula. In January 1777, Russian-supported ≈ûahin Giray crossed into Crimea over the Kerch Strait, much as Devlet had done. Devlet, aware of his impending defeat, abdicated and fled to Constantinople. ≈ûahin was installed as a puppet Khan, infuriating the Muslim population of the peninsula. When he heard this news, Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid I noted \\"≈ûahin Giray is a tool. The aim of the Russians is to take Crimea.\\" ≈ûahin, a member of the ruling House of Giray, attempted a series of reforms to \\"modernise\\" the Khanate. These included attempts to centralise power in the hands of the Khan, establishing \\"autocratic\\" rule, much as in Russia. Previously, power had been distributed between the leaders of different clans, called beys. He attempted to institute state taxation, a conscripted and centralised army, and to replace the traditional religion-based Ottoman legal system with civil law. These reforms, aimed at disrupting the old Ottoman order, were despised by the Crimean populace. Crimean revolts (1777‚Äì82) Europe after Russia's annexation of Crimea, with the north shore of the Black Sea under Russian control At the behest of Empress Catherine, ≈ûahin allowed Russians to settle in the peninsula, further infuriating Crimeans. A group of these settlers had been sent to Yeni-Kale, which remained under Russian control following the installation of ≈ûahin as Khan. Local residents banded together to prevent the Russian settlement, rebelling against ≈ûahin. He sent the new conscript army he had created to quash the rebellion, only to see his forces defect to the rebels. Revolt spread across the peninsula, and rebel forces advanced on ≈ûahin's palace in Bakhchisaray. Amidst this rebellion, exiled Crimeans in Constantinople pressed the Ottoman government to act. Bowing to pressure, the government sent a fleet to Crimea, ostensibly to preserve the Treaty of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca. Russia, however, was quicker to act. Russian forces arrived at Yeni- Kale in February 1778, crushing the revolt before the Ottoman fleet arrived. When the fleet arrived in March, it found that there were no rebels left to support. It fought a brief skirmish with the Russian navy off Akitar (modern Sevastopol), but was \\"forced\\" to flee. ≈ûahin was reinstated as Khan. Minor skirmishes between the Ottoman and Russian navies continued until October 1778, when the Ottoman fleet returned defeated to Constantinople. Over the following years, ≈ûahin continued to try and reform the Khanate. Support for his reform programme remained low, and it was seriously undermined by the decision of Empress Catherine to resettle the Crimean Pontic Greeks on the northern shores of the Azov Sea, outside the Khanate. That community, which was Christian, was an essential part of the Crimean merchant class, and had most readily supported ≈ûahin's reforms. This resettlement caused significant damage to the Crimean economy, and further weakened the position of the Khan. Recognising defeat in Crimea, the Ottoman Empire signed the Convention of Aynali Kavak in early 1779. In the agreement, the Ottomans recognised ≈ûahin as Khan of Crimea, promised no further intervention in Crimea, and conceded that Crimea was under Russian influence. Crimeans could no longer expect support from the Ottomans. ≈ûahin's reforms proceeded, gradually removing Tatars from positions of political influence. For a brief period, Crimea remained peaceful. A new rebellion, sparked by the continuing marginalisation of Tatars within the Khanate government, started in 1781. Various clan leaders and their forces came together in the Taman, across the Kerch Strait from Crimea. In April 1782, a large portion of ≈ûahin's army defected to the rebels, and joined them in the Taman. Communication between rebel leaders, including two of ≈ûahin's brothers, and the Crimean administrative elite was ongoing. Religious (ulama) and legal (kadƒ±) officials, important parts of the old Ottoman order, openly declared their antipathy for ≈ûahin. Rebel forces attacked Kaffa on . ≈ûahin's forces were swiftly defeated, and he was forced to escape to Russian- controlled Kerch. Rebel leaders elected ≈ûahin's brother Bahadir Giray as Khan, and sent a message to the Ottoman government seeking recognition. It was not long, however, before Empress Catherine dispatched Prince Grigory Potemkin to restore ≈ûahin to power. No significant opposition was fielded against the invading Russians, and many rebels fled back across the Kerch Strait. As such, the Khan was restored to his position in October 1782. By this time, however, he had lost the favour of both Crimeans and Empress Catherine. In a letter to a Russian advisor to ≈ûahin, Catherine wrote \\"He must stop this shocking and cruel treatment and not give them [Crimeans] just cause for a new revolt\\". As Russian troops entered the peninsula, work on the establishment of a Black Sea port for use by the Empire began. The city of Akitar was chosen as the site of the port, which would go on to house the newly created Black Sea Fleet. Uncertainty about the sustainability of the restoration of ≈ûahin Giray, however, led to an increase of support for annexing Crimea, spearheaded by Prince Potemkin. Annexation (1783) Proclamation of the annexation of Crimea () In March 1783, Prince Potemkin made a rhetorical push to encourage Empress Catherine to annex Crimea. Having just returned from Crimea, he told her that many Crimeans would \\"happily\\" submit to Russian rule. Encouraged by this news, Empress Catherine issued a formal proclamation of annexation on . Tatars did not resist the annexation. After years of turmoil, the Crimeans lacked the resources and the will to continue fighting. Many fled the peninsula, leaving for Anatolia. Count Alexander Bezborodko, then a close advisor to the Empress, wrote in his diary that Russia was forced to annex Crimea: This view was far from reality. Crimean \\"independence\\" had been a puppet regime, and the Ottomans had played little role in the Crimean revolts. Crimea was incorporated into the Empire as the Taurida Oblast. Later that year, the Ottoman Empire signed an agreement with Russia that recognised the loss of Crimea and other territories that had been held by the Khanate. The agreement, signed on 28 December 1783, was negotiated by Russian diplomat Yakov Bulgakov.

Large, inert flow tracers are injected into live cells and become lodged inside the cytoskeletal mesh, wherein it is oscillated by repercussions from active motor proteins. The magnitude of these random forces can be inferred from the frequency of oscillation of tracer particles. Tracking the fluctuations of tracer particles using optical microscopy can isolate the contribution of active random forces to intracellular molecular transport from that of Brownian motion. Basic principles FSM was developed by Ming Guo and David A. Weitz to probe stochastic intracellular forces generated by motor proteins. Far from a liquid void, the cytoplasm contains a complex meshwork of actin and myosin conferring structural support to the cell, as well as harbouring vesicles and mitochondria among other organelles. Recent research on the macromolecular crowding inside the cytoplasm raises concerns whether diffusive-like motion of large molecules have been mistakenly attributed to Brownian forces. Instead, there are suspicions that myosin motor proteins, which tug randomly on the actin filaments embedded with large molecules, give rise to diffusive-like motion of molecules inside cells. Guo et al. developed an assay to distinguish whether particle motion inside cells are driven by thermal diffusion or by repercussions from active motor proteins like non- muscle myosin II shaking the cellular cytoskeleton. FSM relies on injecting tracer particles coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) larger than the cytoskeletal mesh size (>50 nm), settling in between an internetwork of actin filaments and myosin motor proteins. As myosin motor proteins tug on actin filaments to perform cellular work, these actin fluctuations invariably oscillate neighboring PEGylated particles. The magnitude of tracer fluctuation is proportional to the magnitude of aggregate active motor forces. Thus, by recording the displacement of tracer oscillations, FSM can gauge and derive the magnitude of forces exerted by active motor proteins. Force measurement The fluctuations of PEGylated tracers coupled to aggregate myosin motor forces can be likened to a Hookean spring, : F = kx where the force F applied to generate the oscillation displacement x is proportional to the effective spring constant k of the intracellular environment. The displacement during oscillation is a spatial function of time, which can be directly measured using optical microscopy. A Fourier transform then maps information in the temporal domain to the frequency domain to derive a useful dimension as a function of frequency, : \\\\langle \\\\left( F(v)\\\\right)^{2}\\\\rangle = \\\\langle \\\\left( K(v)\\\\right)^{2}\\\\rangle * \\\\langle \\\\left( x(v)\\\\right)^{2}\\\\rangle where \\\\langle \\\\left( F(v)\\\\right)^{2}\\\\rangle, \\\\langle \\\\left( K(v)\\\\right)^{2}\\\\rangle and \\\\langle \\\\left( x(v)\\\\right)^{2}\\\\rangle are quadratic forms of averaged force, elasticity and displacement used to account for stochastic forces. Time-averaged Mean squared displacement, MSD = \\\\langle \\\\left( X(t)\\\\right)^{2}\\\\rangle can be retrieved by a Fourier Transform from the frequency domain back to the temporal domain. In the context of oscillation frequency, the higher the force frequency spectrum, the greater the metabolic activity of the cell. Independent micromechanical measurements can calculate the elasticity of the cytoplasm. By using an optical tweezer to apply a prescribed force to a tracer particle, FSM can measure the resulting displacement in order to estimate the elastic spring constant. Applications Cytoplasmic fluidity Directed oscillation of tracer particles using optical tweezers resulted in displacement that was nearly synchronized with applied force, suggesting that the cytoplasm is materially closer to an elastic solid. This is in stark contrast to previous hypothesis that the cytoplasm is a viscoelastic fluid in which large molecules can freely diffuse. In ATP-depleted cells, in which non-muscle myosin II are inactivated, FSM experiments reveal that tracer particles cease to oscillate as if the cytoplasm had solidified. Myosin IIs are motor proteins that bind and tugs on actin filaments through ATP hydrolysis. This further corroborates the finding that in nutrient-starved bacteria, the cytoplasm transitions into a glasslike substance. Thus, ATP-hydrolysis by motor proteins appear to be critical to sustain cytoplasmic fluidity, which is crucial to vesicle transport and diffusive motion in the cytoskeleton.  Differential diagnosis of malignant cancer  By measuring the general state of activity inside a cell, FSM can be applied to identify malignant cancerous cells, which are characteristically more elastic and more motile. FSM measurements on malignant MCF-7 breast cancer cells and benign MCF-10A breast cancer cells revealed a statistically significant separation in force spectrum that allows FSM to assay for metastatic cancer. Dimensionality of extracellular environment greatly influences FSM measurements of cancerous cells. In a 3D matrix, MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast cancer cells had comparatively more solid cytoplasm than counterparts cultured on 2D plates.

The 2015‚Äì2016 exhibition, Bring Your Own Body: Transgender between archives and aesthetics, started the tour at Cooper Union and was created in order to explore the meaning of trans and what defines transgender aesthetic in many different forms of artwork. Other transgender artists and archieves participating in this exhibition included: Niv Acosta, Math Bass, Effy Beth, Justin Vivian Bond, Pauline Boudry / Renate Lorenz, Vaginal Davis, Zackary Drucker, Chloe Dzubilo, Reina Gossett with Sasha Wortzel, Juliana Huxtable, Greer Lankton, Pierre Molinier, Genesis Breyer P-Orridge, Flawless Sabrina, Buzz Slutzky, and Chris Vargas with the Museum of Transgender Hirstory and Art. Her poem \\"Litanies to My Heavenly Brown Body\\" was widely circulated after the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting. In the publication \\"Proximity: On the Work of Mark Aguhar,\\" (2015), writer Roy P√©rez examines Aguhar's drawings, videos, live acts, and writings as performances of closeness, and as critiques of racism, transphobia, and fat phobia. P√©rez highlights the complexity of Aguhar's queerness and \\"not wanting to form attachments within the dominant normative society\\".

Mardava as a divine quality is to be lenient with those who make mistakes, to never be offended and remains always quiet when people revile or ignore God. To be gentle is to make friends easily. It is to know that ignorance is the likely reasons for the naysaying response. Mardava is softness, letting go of ego. Mardava is a gentleness with all objects and weakness, it is compassion extended to the lifeless and weak, Swami TejomayƒÅnanda explains: > \\"We can augment our compassion with the practice of mƒÅrdavam or gentleness. > This is an attitude of mind that is not only limited to living things but > extends to insentient material objects as well. If we handle all the things > with care, they will serve us beautifully. For instance, some people take > proper care of their cars but others are so rough with them, there is no > gentleness when they apply the brake, change gears or shut the door. In the > same way, we should remember that shoes are serving our feet and we should > place them down with respect.

How we > take care of inert objects reveals the state of the mind. This mƒÅrdavam is a > disposition of the mind. When a person has this state of mind, all his > actions have a quality of gentleness. In Hinduism, there are eight a≈õtopƒÅyas, or eight ways of attaining moksha, and MƒÅrdava is one of them, the other seven being ‚Äì Yajna (‡§Ø‡§ú‡•ç‡§û) (sacrifices), DƒÅna (‡§¶‡§æ‡§®) (charity), Vedadhyayana (the study of the Vedas), Tapas (‡§§‡§™) (penance, deep meditation), Dama (‡§¶‡§Æ) (subduing the senses by restraining the sense-organs), Satya (‡§∏‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø) (truth in speech and act), and TyƒÅga (‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§ó) (renunciation of desire). In Jainism, mƒÅrdava or compassion or supreme tenderness or humility, which is part of Right Belief, is a means to destroy vanity or egotism which gives rise to many evils which defile the virtues of our soul; it is held that humility is the foundation of compassion and the basis for salvation. With the eight kinds of pride totally avoided, knowledge brings humility. TattvƒÅrthas≈´tra (IX.6) lists mƒÅrdava (modesty) as one of the ten aspects of the highest dharma . Bhagavad Gita (XVI.1-3) also classifies mƒÅrdava as a divine quality and the Buddhists consider mƒÅrdava as the realization of Dharma (dharma-pratipatti). Patanjali mentions mƒÅrdava as a low pitch along with anvavavasarga and udutƒÅ khasya; he explains this word as svarasya mridutƒÅ or snigdhatƒÅ (smoothness of sound).

His principal activities now focus on investments associated with the Lowy family‚Äôs private company, Lowy Family Group, as well as a number of philanthropic and community roles including as Chairman of the World Board of Trustees of Keren Heysod- United Israel Appeal and President of the Hakoah Club. During his career Lowy has served on numerous corporate and philanthropic boards including Westfield Corporation, Australian shopping centre company Scentre Group, as Chairman of Football Federation Australia and President of the board of Trustees of the Art Gallery of New South Wales. He is a former Chairman of the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute and is currently a director of foreign policy think tank, the Lowy Institute, as well as the Lowy Foundation and Lowy Medical Research Institute. Lowy is the third and youngest son of Frank Lowy, a co- founder of Westfield. The Lowy family is one of the most prominent business families in Australia with a reported net worth in excess of $8 billion in 2016. In late 2014, Steven Lowy‚Äôs life was documented in a feature article in The AFR Magazine, \\"The Son Rises: Steven Lowy ascends at Westfield\\". In 2010 Lowy was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for service to business, philanthropy, the arts and medical research. Early life and education Lowy was born to a Modern Orthodox Jewish family, in Sydney, the youngest son of Shirley and Frank Lowy, and educated at Sydney Grammar School and the University of New South Wales where he graduated as a Bachelor of Commerce (Honours). He was awarded the University Prize for his honours thesis and later co-authored a paper with Professor Mark Hirst published in the academic journal Accounting, Organizations and Society. He joined Westfield Holdings in 1987, was appointed a Director of Westfield Holdings in 1989 and a Managing Director in 1997. He has also been a Director of Westfield Management Limited, the manager of Australia‚Äôs then leading retail property trust, Westfield Trust since 1988. Prior to joining Westfield Holdings in 1987 he worked in investment banking at First Boston Corporation in the US for two years. Westfield Westfield was listed on the Sydney Stock Exchange in 1960 by Lowy‚Äôs father, Frank and his partner John Saunders. The pair were newly arrived immigrants to Australia and had opened a small delicatessen shop in the western suburbs of Sydney. Their venture was a success and their ambition led to the expansion of their business to include the development of residential housing and larger shopping centres. The first Westfield centre was built in Blacktown in Sydney‚Äôs western suburbs in 1959. This was shortly followed by a new centre in Hornsby in Sydney‚Äôs north in 1961. The company flourished and expanded to other Australian cities and then the United States in the mid-1970s and to New Zealand in 1997 and the United Kingdom in 2000. At this point, Westfield had 86 centres in its global portfolio, with some 13,200 retailers and $24.1 billion in assets. In 2004, the various Westfield entities were merged to create Westfield Group to provide the scale and financial heft required to continue international expansion. This led to the creation of two landmark shopping centres in London (Westfield London at Shepherd‚Äôs Bush in 2008) and Westfield Stratford City (on the site of the 2012 London Olympics) in 2011. In 2014 Westfield Group underwent another major corporate restructure in which its Australian and New Zealand operations merged with Westfield Retail Trust to create a new company, Scentre Group. At the same time, another new, separate company, Westfield Corporation, was created to own and manage the former Westfield Group‚Äôs shopping centres in the US and UK. More recently, Westfield Corporation opened Westfield World Trade Center in New York on 16 August 2016. They have also advanced plans to build its first shopping centre in Europe, in Milan Italy. A feature of the company during this period was a marked shift towards high quality \\"iconic\\" or flagship malls showcasing the world‚Äôs best retailers and luxury brands. Five-star service and upscale restaurants and entertainment were a critical element in this shift, as was its adoption of a more aggressive \\"innovation\\" strategy to use digital technology \\"to better connect the retailer with the shopper\\". Since the establishment of Westfield Labs based in San Francisco in 2012, several digital initiatives were piloted and implemented in several Westfield shopping centres around the world. Westfield Labs has been recognised by Fast Company magazine as one of the 50 most innovative companies in the world, and as one of the Top 10 retail companies for \\"giving the mall a high-tech makeover\\". Following the sale of Westfield Corporation to Unibail Rodamco in 2018 Westfield‚Äôs former retail digital business was transferred to a new and separate entity OneMarket which was chaired by Steven Lowy AM. OneMarket was wound up in December 2019. Philanthropy and community activity Lowy is currently chairman of the World Board of Trustees of Keren Heysod-United Israel Appeal and President of Hakoah Club Sydney. He is a former President of the board of Trustees of the Art Gallery of New South Wales (2006 ‚Äì 2013), Chairman of the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute (2008-2013), and is a director of the Lowy Institute, a Sydney-based foreign policy think tank, and the Lowy Medical Research Institute, a private medical organisation. Steven was a member of the Prime Minister‚Äôs Business-Government Advisory Group on National Security and has been the Presiding Officer of the NSW Police Force associate degree in Policing Practice Board of Management. Together with his father, Frank, and two brothers, David and Peter, he plays a key role in decisions about the Lowy family‚Äôs philanthropic activities. In recent years, the family has supported the establishment of the Lowy Cancer Centre at the University of NSW, a new building (the Lowy Packer Building) to house the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute and the St Vincent's Centre for Applied Medical Research. The building was opened by Princess Mary of Denmark on 3 September 2008. In 2013 Frank Lowy revealed to a Philanthropy Australia audience that his family had donated more than $350 million to various causes during the previous decade. Football Lowy is a passionate soccer fan and played the game competitively throughout his youth. He continued to compete in masters tournaments until injury ended his playing career in his early ‚Äò50s. On 17 November 2015 he was elected as a director of Football Federation Australia (FFA) by nine state football federations and a representative of the 10 Hyundai A-League clubs which form Australia's national football competition. He was then elected Chairman by his fellow directors. under his leadership. FFA achieved its highest income and sponsorship on record and the Socceroos qualified for their fourth consecutive World Cup (one of only 12 teams to do so) and together with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, launched Australia's bid to host the 2023 Women's World Cup. Lowy's tenure as chairman ended in November 2018. Personal life Lowy married Judy Levin in 1986. They have four children.

He has been developing a serum in the hopes of making himself stronger ever since S.H.I.E.L.D. had taken Skye and his wife had been killed, but results have been inconsistent, and now he hopes that he can stand against S.H.I.E.L.D. with the help of his new team. Now that Skye has powers, S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Phil Coulson has put her on the Index. She needs a psychological analysis and threat assessment, so Coulson asks Agent Melinda May to contact her ex-husband, Dr. Andrew Garner, who consulted for S.H.I.E.L.D. previously. He agrees to help on the condition that Skye gets to see his report as well, as he is doing this for her, not S.H.I.E.L.D. May explains that that won‚Äôt be a problem now that Coulson is in charge. Skye admits to Garner that she iced herself previously because she couldn‚Äôt control her abilities, and that she was scared of losing her status as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, even having nightmares of being targeted by S.H.I.E.L.D. as she knows many Gifted individuals are. Coulson and Agent Bobbi Morse investigate Angar‚Äôs breakout, and track Cal and his team to Manitowoc, Wisconsin, where Coulson was born. At the local football stadium, Angar has induced catatonia in many local high school students, and Cal‚Äôs team are standing watch over them, waiting for Coulson to arrive. Coulson calls May for backup, and rather than interfere in Garner‚Äôs session with Skye, which is taking place in the cage on S.H.I.E.L.D.‚Äôs plane, May flies straight to Manitowoc with Skye and Garner on board. Coulson confronts Cal on the field as May arrives. When Cal sees Skye in S.H.I.E.L.D.‚Äôs clutches (May holds a gun to her) he points out how terribly S.H.I.E.L.D. treats Gifted people. Before he can do anything, however, Gordon teleports into the stadium and takes Cal away. Coulson, Morse, and May subdue the rest of Cal‚Äôs team, but as Skye witnesses the brutality S.H.I.E.L.D. uses against them, she loses control of her abilities again. As the stadium shakes, she tries to push her emotions aside as May has taught her, and as the shaking stops, she falls unconscious. Upon waking up, she learns that she had just directed her abilities inwards, causing hairline fractures up her arms. Garner recommends that Skye leave S.H.I.E.L.D. altogether, and notes to May that S.H.I.E.L.D. really hasn‚Äôt changed, as she said it had, turning down an offer to stay on and consult. Meanwhile, Agent Mack takes Lance Hunter as a prisoner to ‚Äúthe real S.H.I.E.L.D.‚Äù, an organization that he and Morse are secretly working for. In an end tag, Cal is enraged that Gordon didn't take Skye, who he feels should be saved from S.H.I.E.L.D. Gordon taunts Cal about being a \\"science experiment\\", rather than being born with his gifts like himself and Skye. Cal then goes to learn his fate from Gordon's superiors.  Production   Development  In February 2015, Marvel announced that the thirteenth episode of the season would be titled \\"One of Us\\", to be written by Monica Owusu-Breen, with Kevin Tancharoen directing.  Writing  Executive producer Jeffrey Bell talked about the more episodic aspects of the episode, saying \\"This was a different episode for us. We‚Äôre pretty serialized, and every now and then you want to find a way to take a little detour that keeps the emotional life of your story going, but you want to explore other corners. And this one really does that. We‚Äôre spending a lot of time with Cal in this episode, and his friends ... it‚Äôs a really fun episode. And there‚Äôs a... not darker, but more of a gothic tone to it, if that makes sense.\\"  Casting  In February 2015, Marvel revealed that main cast members Clark Gregg, Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, Nick Blood, and Adrianne Palicki would star as Phil Coulson, Melinda May, Skye, Leo Fitz, Jemma Simmons, Lance Hunter, and Bobbi Morse, respectively. It was also revealed that the guest cast for the episode would include Henry Simmons as Alphonso \\"Mack\\" MacKenzie, Kyle MacLachlan as Calvin Zabo, Jamie Harris as Gordon, Blair Underwood as Dr. Andrew Garner, Drea De Matteo as Karla Faye Gideon, Ric Sarabia as Wendell Levi, Geo Corvera as Francis Noche, Jeff Daniel Phillips as David A. Angar, Gregg Martin as student, Jack Kennedy as security guard and Jamal Duff as John Bruno. Sarabia, Corvera, Phillips, Martin, Kennedy, and Duff did not receive guest star credit in the episode. Simmons, MacLachlan, and Harris reprise their roles from earlier in the series. Main cast member Brett Dalton, who portrays Grant Ward in the series, does not appear in the episode.  Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins  Dr. Andrew Garner works at the West Virginia campus of Culver University. The Virginia campus appeared in The Incredible Hulk.  Release   Broadcast  \\"One of Us\\" was first aired in the United States on ABC on March 17, 2015.  Marketing  For the final twelve episodes of the season Marvel once again ran the \\"Art of...\\" initiative, in which an image was released the Thursday before the episode aired, depicting a first look at a key event from the upcoming episode, with the season's title being \\"The Art of Evolution\\". The different artists were once again chosen to create the teaser posters, based on their previous work and how it connected to the themes and emotion of the intended episode. For \\"One of Us\\", created by Declan Shalvey and Jordie Bellaire, the poster features muted colors and shows \\"Coulson surrounded by villains [from the S.H.I.E.L.D. index], and the giant Cal looming over, and [a bird and] S.H.I.E.L.D. behind him.\\"  Home media  The episode began streaming on Netflix on June 11, 2015, and was released along with the rest of the second season on September 18, 2015, on Blu-ray and DVD.  Reception   Ratings  In the United States the episode received a 1.6/5 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, meaning that it was seen by 1.6 percent of all households, and 5 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. It was watched by 4.34 million viewers.  References   External links  *\\"One of Us\\" at ABC * * Category:Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

Ofahengaue played in the club's elimination final against Parramatta which Brisbane lost 58-0 at the new Western Sydney Stadium. The defeat was the worst in Brisbane's history and also the biggest finals defeat in history. Ofahengaue was also placed on report during the match after hitting Parramatta player Blake Ferguson in the head with a swinging arm. Ofahengaue was a part of Tonga‚Äôs historic victory over Australia in November, playing off the Interchange Bench. 2020 Ofahengaue made 15 appearances for Brisbane in the 2020 NRL season as the club suffered their worst ever year both on and off the field culminating in the club's first Wooden Spoon. Controversy In February 2016, Ofahengaue was involved in the Maroons camp nightmare as he was one of the designated drivers alongside Dale Copley as they were with 8 other players such as Anthony Milford, Cameron Munster, Valentine Holmes and Dylan Napa who broke the camp midnight curfew and partied on into the night after a drinking session at the Story Bridge Hotel. Ofahengaue and Copley, however were still eligible for selection for the Maroons in 2016 as they weren‚Äôt banned. In 2017, Ofahengaue had to appear in court in April 2017 after he was caught on CCTV footage cheating in a game of poker at the Treasury Casino by slipping a $100 chip under a $15 chip while the dealer was looking away and later copped a $400 fine with no conviction of fraud. On 26 January 2020, Ofahengaue was charged by Queensland police for a traffic infringement. It was alleged that Ofahengaue was found asleep behind the wheel of a stationary vehicle. The Brisbane Broncos issued a statement to say the club is ‚Äúaware of a motor vehicle-related offence involving forward Joe Ofahengaue, The NRL‚Äôs Integrity Unit was immediately informed of the incident and the Broncos are working with authorities on the matter\\". On 28 February 2020, Ofahengaue was suspended for two matches by Brisbane. Brisbane CEO Paul White spoke to the media saying \\"The Broncos took the decision to stand down the player after taking into consideration that it was not his first driving offence in recent years, ‚ÄúJoe is really disappointed in himself and very remorseful for what he has done,‚Äù he said. As a club, our goal is to set a standard for our players and Joe understands that he must pay a price for his actions that night.

It lies approximately northeast of Exeter. Poltimore consisted of 122 households and a population of 297 people during the 2011 census. It also includes the hamlet of Ratsloe.  History  Two manors were recorded at Poltimore in the Domesday Book completed 1086: the main one was owned by Haemeric (or Haimer) de Arcis, an officer in the army of William the Conqueror; and a smaller one, Cutton, belonging to the Canons of St. Mary at Rouen. The name of the village itself likely comes from Old Welsh, Pwlltymawr, which translates to \\"The Pool by the Great House\\" (Pwyll: pool; Ty: house; Mawr: great). The de Pultymor family, who owned the Manor of Poltimore in the 13th century, also had a residence called Poltymore in Glamorgan, South Wales. The Devon village was also spelled Poltymore, and the family's name subsequently evolved to de Poltymore, de Poltimore and of Poltimore. Historically Poltimore formed part of Wonford Hundred. The manor appeared and is the historic seat of the Bampfylde family. The baronetcy, created for Sir John Bampfylde, 1st Baronet in 1641, takes its name from the village. The manor was rebuilt into Poltimore House, likely by Sir Coplestone Bampfylde, 2nd Baronet (1636-1691). The date 1681 is carved on the stone gate at the main entrance to the house. William Camden, in his 1610 book, Britain, or, a Chorographicall Description of the most flourishing Kingdomes, England, Scotland, and Ireland, makes mention of Poltimore as \\"the seat of that worshipfull and right antient family of Bampfield.\\" In 1641‚Äì1642, 75 adult males in Poltimore signed the Protestation returns. The population was 250 people in 1801, 288 in 1887 and 298 in 1901. Government The village is run by the Poltimore Parish Council. Council meetings are normally held on the fourth Monday of each month at the Poltimore Village Hall. Poltimore falls within the East Devon District Council and the East Devon Constituency. Transport The village lies directly west of the M5 motorway. Church Poltimore falls within Aylesbeare Deanery for ecclesiastical purposes. The village has one church, St. Mary's, which has Renaissance detail in the vaulting (). The tomb with recumbent figures of Richard Bampfylde (d. 1594) and his wife, Elizabeth (d. 1599), is in the south transept.

It was released on March 11, 2015 for iOS, Android, Windows Phone and Windows 10 devices. The game serves as a direct sequel to Dungeon Hunter 4 which ended amidst the dying Valenthia city state. Dungeon Hunter 5 is an online game that requires an internet connection in order to play. Gameplay The basic gameplay of Dungeon Hunter 5 shares some similarities to its predecessor, Dungeon Hunter 4, such as picking up loot, using skill attacks and using potions. However, unlike its predecessor, the game is not an open-world nor exploration, but rather a level-based dungeons that have a series of difficulties. As the hero progresses, he/she will encounter even stronger enemies which puts his/her skill to the test. Dungeon Hunter 5 doesn't also feature and contain a class system, instead picking off a starter type of weapon in the beginning in the game. The player character can also add friends though they can no longer co-op in missions. There is also an energy system which restricts the players from performing too many dungeons. Aside from these main features, there is also a new mode called Stronghold in which player characters can collect minions to place them inside the stronghold. A new type of currency called quartz is also featured and can be used for fusing minions. If a player fought and raids another player, his/her shield will switch off thus making him/her vulnerable from other players. This has a level up ranks which forces the players to fight even more powerful players across their strongholds. There is also a trophy system in which the player can gain trophies by winning, but it can decrease if he/she lost the raid attempt. The loot system has also been expanded, not just the melee weapons, ranged weapons and armor body parts, but also the evolution items, skill weapons, backpacks and belts. A new fusion system has also been implemented in which players can pick an item and fuse it with unequipped or unwanted ones. Prior to the loot and fusion system, there is an evolution system where the item's level is maxed out, the player can use evolution materials to evolve them. Setting Dungeon Hunter 5 is primarily set in the shattered world called Valenthia, the same as were the previous game was set. The city overall is more detailed and has much better shadows than its predecessor.

Description Colonies of Paragoniastrea australensis can be massive, submassive or encrusting. The corallites are arranged in deep valleys with steep walls. The valleys are meandroid and may be short or long, depending on the habitat in which the coral grows. The septa are even and regularly spaced and extend over the valley walls into the next valley. They are finely toothed and have paliform lobes, and the columella are large. This coral is quite variable in colour, most often being some shade of green or brown, with the valley floor often contrasting with the rest of the surface. Distribution and habitat This widespread and common species can be found in shallow or clear waters in the Indo-West Pacific (Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, Indian Ocean, Australia, Southeast Asia, Japan and China Sea). Biology Paragoniastrea australensis is a zooxanthellate species of coral. It obtains most of its nutritional needs from the symbiotic dinoflagellates that live within its soft tissues, supplementing this with the planktonic organisms caught by the polyps. Status This coral is a common species with a wide range and large total population size which makes it more resilient than some other species of coral. The main threats faced by corals are related to the mechanical destruction of their coral reef habitats and climate change; these include increasing damage from extreme weather events, rising sea water temperatures and ocean acidification. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the conservation status of this species as being of \\"least concern\\". All corals receive protection by being listed on CITES Appendix II.

The artist  Wilhelm \\"Willy\\" Wiedmann worked in many art directions, creating compositions, poems, paintings, and invented his own painting style: the Polycon painting. Wiedmann also attended and organised national and international exhibitions. Throughout his career Wiedmann engaged with several famous artists such as Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, and Salvador Dal√≠. He was Stuttgart's first art dealer who displayed Dal√≠'s art in his own gallery, \\"Galerie am Jakobsbrunnen.\\" Willy Wiedmann received the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 2002 for his work in the service of art and culture.Official letter from governor of Landes Baden- Wuerttemberg to Wilhelm Wiedmann, 19 August 2002  The musician and composer  At the age of four Willy Wiedmann played the accordion; one year later, the violin and flute. In 1939 he had first appearance at a chamber orchestra. At thirteen Wiedmann wrote his first minuet, one of many compositions. Throughout his life he created 150 Opus works. Wiedmann studied music between 1950 and 1958 at the State University of Music and Performing Arts Stuttgart, as a student of Johann Nepomuk David. From 1954 to 1964 he worked as a freelance musician and composer at the W√ºrttembergischen Staatstheater Stuttgart, and between 1964 and 1982 for several German television and radio stations such as SDR, SWF, ARD, and ZDF. For over ten years, Wiedmann played as a professional jazz musician, collaborating on-stage with many artists including Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, Lionel Hampton and Oscar Peterson.  The painter and art dealer  The Wiedmann Bible ‚Äì Polycon Painting In addition to his musical career, Willy Wiedmann studied painting at the State Academy of Art and Design in Stuttgart (1960‚Äì1963), attending classes of Professor Willi Baumeister. After his studies, he invented the art of \\"Polycon painting\\" (Polykonmalerei) which he officially exhibited for the first time in 1965 at the Galerie am Jakobsbrunnen in Bad Cannstatt, Stuttgart. Throughout his career Wiedmann created over 30,000 paintings, which were presented in galleries worldwide. Between 1975 and 1998 Wiedmann redesigned artwork in churches in Germany, Italy, Austria, etc. Examples include the Martinskirche in Wildberg, \\"Martinsfenster\\" in 1982, in cooperation with Volker Saile and Laleh Bastian, and the Pauluskirche in Zuffenhausen, Stuttgart in 1984. The convergence between art and church gave Wiedmann the idea for his main work: \\"The Wiedmann Bible\\". He worked for sixteen years (1984‚Äì2000) painting the 3,333 pictures, folded into an accordion-pleat style book (leporello). Wiedmann claimed that The Wiedmann Bible is the world's longest painted Christian Bible. It is painted in Wiedmann's own Polycon style. In 1964, Wiedmann opened his first art gallery Galerie am Jakobsbrunnen in Bad Cannstatt, Stuttgart. He exhibited as one of the first art dealers of \\"Wiener Schule\\" and Neoclassicism, Salvador Dal√≠ at his gallery (1966), as well as Nkoane Harry Moyaga during the restrictive period of South African apartheid (1977). He was the first art dealer in Europe to exhibit the works of a black South African painter throughout this time. Wiedmann ran a total of six national and international galleries throughout his career: among others are Pictures for Business in New York (1967‚Äì1977), TWS-Etagengalerie in Stuttgart (1972‚Äì1977, director), and Kunsthoefle in Bad Cannstatt, Stuttgart (1983‚Äì1985, director).  The author and publisher  Despite his profession as a painter, art dealer, musician, and composer, Wiedmann also pursued his passion for writing. He wrote seven books (author or illustrator), of which he published most of them himself. Other literary works include 500 poems, lyrics, and audio plays. Wiedmann often wrote using several pen-names, for example \\"Alkibiades Zickle\\", inspired by a favorite restaurant of his, \\"Zickle\\" in Bad Cannstatt. He uses pseudonyms including Emilio Gr√§sli, Alkibiades Zickle, Marc Johann, Theodor Abtsfeld, George Yugone, Eugen von Engelsbogen and Allan Doe.  Personal life  Wilhelm Richard Heinrich (Willy) Wiedmann was born in 1929 in Ettlingen, Karlsruhe, Germany to his parents Richard and Klara Wiedmann, n√©e Weiss. He was married to Klara Wiedmann, n√©e Wagner, and fathered three children Richard, Cornelia and Martin. Wiedmann was known for his two pet Schnauzers: Jakob and Jakobine, named after his \\"Galerie am Jakobsbrunnen\\". They accompanied him and his wife on their trips, tours, exhibitions and festivals. Wiedmann died in 2013 at the age of 84 Jahren in Bad Cannstatt, Stuttgart. Wilhelm Wiedmann was involved with several associations and organizations. He donated works to charity events, was a charity auctioneer himself, and a respected art critic. Starting in 1968 he took on private students such as the German actor Walter Schultheiss or the artists Laleh Bastian and Ute Hadam. Wiedmann was also very committed to the local art scene and culture and one of the founders of \\"Cultur in Cannstatt\\" (Stuttgart) in 1988.

Description Dallas is a TV soap-opera/crime system in which the PCs are major characters from the Dallas series interacting in \\"plots.\\" Character abilities include power, persuasion, coercion, seduction, investigation, and luck; ability scores are compared and dice are rolled to determine the results of actions. The game includes the \\"Rules of Play\\" (16 pages), \\"Major Characters\\" booklet (16 pages), and the \\"Scriptwriter's Guide\\" (16 pages) for the GM, plus dozens of minor characters on cut-apart cards. Publication history Dallas was designed by James F. Dunnigan, with art by Redmond A.

In an attempt to expand its customer base even further beyond the \\"hobbyist\\" core, SPI entered into a much-publicized arrangement with Lorimar Productions to produce the Dallas role-playing game based on the soap opera Dallas in 1980. Dallas: The Television Role-Playing Game is sometimes named as the first ever licensed role-playing game, although Star Trek: Adventure Gaming in the Final Frontier (1978) from Heritage Models is older. The game proved to be an infamous failure, and Simonsen later remarked that the 80,000 copies printed were 79,999 too many. Reception David Ladyman reviewed Dallas: The Television Role-Playing Game in The Space Gamer No. 42. Ladyman commented that \\"Is Dallas a useful bridge between gaming and your 'real world' friends? That might depend on how many Dallas freaks you know that you would want to introduce to gaming. Hard core RPGers will probably want to add the game to their collection; characters' attributes and the conflict resolution system are novel enough, even if you have no interest in the television series. I wouldn't suggest it, though, if you buy your games for long-term playability - Dallas just doesn't have lasting entertainment value.\\" Lawrence Schick comments: \\"As much a card game as a role-playing game, it was widely loathed by SPI's devoted following of wargamers.\\" Daniel Mackay, in his book The Fantasy Role-Playing Game: A New Performing Art, notes this game as an example of an unsuccessful licensed role-playing game.

He wasn't selected for the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, which led to a media campaign against the decision. He turned professional and was trained by his father Arthur and Jim Knight in the gym at the Jolly Angler pub on Wharf Street in Leicester, and was managed by Johnny Griffin and later Carl Gunns. From his first nine pro fights Wood win eight and drew one. In January 1974 he met Les Stevens for the vacant BBBofC Southern Area heavyweight title, suffering his first professional defeat on points. Defeats to Eddie Neilson and Richard Dunn followed. Griffin saw Wood as a better prospect at light heavyweight and encouraged him to slim down to that weight. Wood won his first four fights of 1975, including wins over Victor Attivor and Baby Boy Rolle, before losing in a final eliminator for the British light heavyweight title to Roy John by only half a point. He beat Johnny Wall in February 1976 to take the Southern Area light heavyweight title, and two months later faced Phil Martin for the vacant British title. Wood won narrowly on points to become British champion. Wood lost his title in March 1977 when he was knocked out in the first round by Bunny Johnson.

The revised and expanded second edition was published in 1984 as a 160-page book with a map and a sample character record sheet. Gameplay The setting of Element Masters is the world of Vinya, where magic and technology mix. The PCs are all users of the forgotten discipline of Element Magic. Character generation Character generation starts by choosing a race: humans, elves, dwarves, unspeakables (half-sized humans) and half-trons. Each race has advantages and disadvantages. The referee may also offer players the option to play one of the game's monsters as a character race. Once the race has been chosen, the player then rolls five 4-sided dice for each of the character's eight abilities (Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, Magic Points, Appearance, and Luck). These can be augmenteded by military training. The player rolls percentile dice to determine Handedness. The character must also be bound to one of the four classical elements (Fire, Water, Earth, Air); again percentile dice are used to determine this. The player then chooses skills from a list of over forty, and weapons and armour from an extensive list. The character's hometown is randomly determined, as is previous training in certain areas. Combat In combat, a player rolls percentile dice to determine if a hit is successful. If it is, the player rolls percentile dice to determine the location of the damage and rolls appropriate dice for the weapon used to determine how much damage; all damage is applied to the location previously determined, minus a deduction for the defender's armour (if any). Skills Skill challenges are also resolved using percentile dice and comparing the result to the character's relevant skill rating. Spellcasting Magic uses a point-buy system ‚Äî every character starts with a bank of Spell Points, and each spell costs a certain number of Spell Points to learn. Reception In the May 1985 edition of Dragon, Tom Armstrong liked the detail of the setting, and found no serious problems with the game rules.

Sources of revenue  Party membership used to be a major source of funding when a high percentage of the adult population were members of a political party. However, just like in other democracies) party membership has decreased. In 1969 still 18 per cent of the citizens retained a membership, in 1990 there were roughly just 7 per cent left.Mendilow, Jonathan: 'Party Financing in Israel. Experience and Experimentation', in: Alexander, Herbert E.

The share of party income from membership was less than 10 per cent of the total then.Mendilow, Jonathan: 'Public Party Funding and Party Transformation in Multi-Party Systems', in: Comparative Political Studies, vol. 25, no. 1, 1992, p. 101. \\"Individual contributions to general elections are permitted as long as they originate from donors who are Israeli citizens and residents above the age of eighteen,\\" provided the donation does not exceed NIS 50,000 and it is not anonymous.Levush, Ruth: Campaign Finance: Israel, Washington DC: Library of Congress, 2009, p. 3; available at: . A report in Haaretz contends that somehow non-residents made political contributions in 2015.'Who are the biggest contributors to politics in Israel? Many live in New York and Miami', in: Haaretz, 6 February 2015. In 1969, Israel had started to provide public funding for party activity. This source of revenue has increased its importance ever since. Between 1975 and 1984, public subsidies had covered about 85 per cent of declared annual routine expenses.Mendilow, Jonathan: 'Party Financing in Israel. Experience and Experimentation', in: Alexander, Herbert E. (ed.): Comparative Political Finance in the 1980s, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989, p. 143.  Regulation of money in politics  Public law stipulates a variety of rules for the flow of money in politics. Israeli laws restrict both donations and expenses. Most of the rules concern political parties. However, as candidates run their own campaigns in party primaries, these under surveillance for 30 days, too. For candidates in primaries donations by foreign individuals are permitted.For details see Levush, Ruth: Campaign Finance: Israel, Washington DC: Library of Congress, 2009, available at: . Applicable are the Political Parties (Financing) Law, 5733-1973, and the Parties Law, 5752-1992.The text of these laws is available in: Party Financing and Elections Financing in Israel, Background Material Prepared at the Request of the Secretary General of the Knesset, July 21, 2003, pp. 11-28 PDF file .

The genomes of Melainabacteria organisms isolated from ground water indicate that the organism has the capacity to fix nitrogen. Melainabacteria lack linked electron transport chains but have multiple methods to generate a membrane potential which can then produce ATP via ATP synthase. They are able to use Fe hydrogenases for production that can be consumed by other microorganisms. Melainabacteria from the human gut also synthesize several B and K vitamins, which suggests that these bacteria are beneficial to their host because they are consumed along with plant fibers.

Highland Village was one of the first shopping centers opened in Houston. History Highland Village was opened in the mid-1940s by S.N. Adams. Adams named it Highland Village after his native Scotland. Adams was also responsible for establishing the Oak Estates and Highland Village subdivisions that border the shopping center. It was one of the first shopping centers opened in Houston. The Adams family, Highland Village's original owners, sold the shopping center to investors in the early 1960s and the development changed multiple hands until it was purchased by Haidar Barbouti and Highland Village Holdings in 1991. Barbouti's leadership led to multiple changes at Highland Village. In 1994, the center became was selected by Starbucks to house its first shop in Houston. He also led an initiative in the early 2000s to reshape Highland Village and attract large national stores to the center. Crate & Barrel opened a 39,000 square foot location at Highland Village in 2000. The Crate & Barrel building was later described by architectural historian Stephen Fox as Houston's most ambitious work of retail architecture of the 2000s. By 2004, Barbouti's work at developing and repositioning the center was being recognized throughout the region and the per-square-foot volumes of Highland Village stores such as Williams-Sonoma and Pottery Barn were estimated to be in the top 10 percent of most types of chain according to industry analysts. In 2008, the center donated the retail space and utilities necessary for Highland Village Adoption Center, a pet adoption center, to open its doors in Highland Village.

Its aim is to keep an area of land known as The Block in Aboriginal hands, and to ensure the land is used solely for low-cost housing for Aboriginal people. It was started by Aboriginal elder, Jenny Munro, and was named after the original Aboriginal Tent Embassy in Canberra. The organisers of the Redfern Aboriginal Tent Embassy say they are defying the gentrification of Redfern, and describe the eviction of the Aboriginal people from the area as 'social cleansing'. History The site of the Redfern Aboriginal Tent Embassy, pictured in July 2017 The Redfern Aboriginal Tent Embassy was established on National Sorry Day on 26 May 2014, when Jenny Munro and other Aboriginal elders erected numerous tents on the otherwise vacant land. There were formerly houses on The Block, which were purchased with a grant from the Whitlam Government in 1972, as a result of a campaign led by Bob Bellear to secure low-cost housing for Aboriginal people. This was because Aboriginal people were subjected to severe discrimination when seeking accommodation in the private rental market. Purchase of houses continued over time. The Aboriginal Housing Company (AHC), an Aboriginal charity, was set up to administer and oversee the provision of low-cost housing for Aboriginal people. Over the years, there were complaints that the AHC was not transparent about its financial affairs, and it was accused of nepotism and mismanagement. As median house prices in Redfern doubled in the late 1990s, the AHC began evicting Aboriginal tenants from The Block, and moving them to other AHC-owned houses further away from Sydney's centre. The AHC then demolished the vacated houses on The Block. Munro says The Block is sacred, sovereign Aboriginal land. But on 26 May 2014, the CEO of the Aboriginal Housing Company, Michael Mundine, said that The Block was private land. However, he told reporters that he would not instruct the police to remove the tent embassy inhabitants from the site. Mundine announced plans to use the land across the road from The Block for a $70 million commercial development, including retail outlets, a gymnasium, and housing for 154 non-Aboriginal students from the nearby University of Sydney. He said he still intends to put Aboriginal housing on The Block, but there is no funding to make it happen. People are concerned that the plans have changed, but as there is little information available, calls for greater transparency have been renewed. Mundine caused outrage by teaming with developer Deicorp, a company whose agents had advertised its new luxury apartments in the area by stating: > \\"The Aboriginals have already moved out, now Redfern is the last virgin > suburb close to city, it will have great potential for the capital growth in > the near future.\\" On 21 February 2015, Mundine's AHC issued eviction notices to the tent embassy inhabitants, telling them they were on private land and that he would get the authorities to remove them. The Aboriginal people at the tent embassy vowed to stay put. In August 2015 the protesters at the tent embassy lost a Supreme court case asking for a possession order for the land. The court instead ruled that the land was the property of the AHC. The protesters previously stated they would not vacate until the AHC priorotised affordable housing for Aboriginal people at the location. The Tent Embassy claimed victory later that month, when the federal government agreed to spent $70 million on 62 homes for Aboriginal people. The embassy has since been closed and as of July 2017, the site remains fenced off and undeveloped. The late Aboriginal activist, Ray Jackson, was a prominent campaigner for the Redfern Aboriginal Tent Embassy, and was a familiar sight there up until his death in April 2015.

In a letter to the editor of Sidelines, published on March 11, 1991, a reader who claimed to be \\"present at the time\\", remembered hearing Mr. Patrick say, \\"the only thing I hate worse than fat women is half-raced people.\\" He said the comment was made in a \\"joking manner\\" and directed at an intoxicated biracial woman who wanted to start \\"a racial riot\\" and not \\"specifically at African-Americans.\\" The reader asked what Mack and his associates hoped to gain by relaying their \\"meager information\\" to WQQK and said the \\"only possible outcome would be to aggravate the situation.\\" Mack also conducted a random survey of MTSU students about their openness to interracial dating that was published in Sidelines. He reported that 65% of those surveyed approved of ‚Äúbiracial unions‚Äù and noted that most of the approval ‚Äúcame from white female students while most of the opposition stemmed from African-American females.‚Äù He added that the results were \\"in no way an actual account of the entire student body's feelings\\" and that he felt many students said they approved because they feared \\"being labeled racist if they disagreed\\". Mack went on to say that \\"fear of what another person might say or think is one of the primary reasons there is so much confusion surrounding the issue\\". Student activism On February 17, 1992, two male students (one African-American the other white) were arrested for public drunkenness during a men's basketball game between MTSU and Tennessee State University. Following a Black History Month ceremony at halftime, while the Student Government Association president (who was black) led the crowd in a \\"rap cheer\\", the two juniors \\"spontaneously\\" appeared on the floor wearing Afro wigs, bell-bottoms and platform shoes and added a \\"graphic performance\\" to the cheer. To many observers, the SGA president appeared to be dancing too. Sidelines ran a front-page story on the arrest of the \\"demonstrators\\" with a picture of the inebriated white student grabbing his private parts next to the conservatively dressed, but visibly smiling, black SGA president. The duo had crashed previous halftime shows with their \\"hip-thrusting, crotch-grabbing dance routine\\" and most of the student body knew it was not racially motivated, but given the timing and the fact that TSU was a historically black university, a \\"few concerned individuals‚Äù made calls asking about the ‚Äúnature‚Äù of the halftime program. A faculty member, who asked not to be identified, told Sidelines the incident made them ‚Äúashamed and embarrassed‚Äù to work at MTSU and the students were threatened with expulsion. The newspaper's official position was that the students were being \\"made the scapegoats of the political correctness movement\\" and \\"to expel them from school for the purpose of saving the image of the school would be an injustice.\\" MTSU's president, Dr. James E. Walker, who became the state's first African-American to head a predominately white institution of higher education when he took office the year before, issued a public apology on behalf of the university that was reprinted in Sidelines alongside a statement by the SGA president (who vehemently denied he was dancing) and an op-ed by Mack. Bayer referred to himself as ‚Äúa person that stands for uplifting of the black race‚Äù and said he would be \\"one of the first people to speak out‚Äù if he felt the ‚Äúspectacle was racially derogatory‚Äù (which he did not) and questioned whether blacks sometimes took themselves \\"too seriously\\". Mack argued that it was not the job of President Walker, alumni or the campus judiciary court to decide ‚Äúwhat is and what is not lewd‚Äù and pointed out that, on the same night, an MTSU student was \\"accosted by three other students\\" carrying weapons and asked \\"Which of these seems to be the real criminal act?\\" Career Recording artist and producer Mack started rapping at age 14 and produced a mixtape at age 16 as leader of a local rap group called the \\"A-1 Posse\\". In a 2014 interview with Roanoke's 101.5 FM radio, Mack said, ‚ÄúI thought I was going to be the youngest in charge, but Special Ed beat me to the punch.\\" He spent a semester studying Business with a concentration on entrepreneurship at Nashville State Technical Institute then founded Street Vibes Records using money from a trust fund established by his late father. Mack released a three-track maxi-single, titled \\"Leave Em Alone\\", under the stage name \\"B-MAC\\" that was regionally distributed by Memphis-based Select-O- Hits, which was also handling product for Suave House Records. In a September 1993 interview with Sidelines, writer Merrill Jackson compared the young rapper to Eazy-E and Too Short, but Mack (who was only 21) described himself as a \\"burned out black activist\\" who was \\"disillusioned with politics\\". In 1995, he co-founded the gangsta rap group, \\"The GoodFellaz\\", and produced an EP called Death Wish that was also released on Street Vibes. Dot-com boom and bust Mack relocated to Louisville, Kentucky in the mid-1990s and founded the dot-com company Infinity-Digital in 1998 during a period of extreme growth in the usage and adaptation of the Internet. His website HOT 104.com gained notoriety after a story it published about the shooting death of Tyisha Miller by police officers in Riverside, CA went viral. In 1999, Mack signed a six-figure affiliate contract with the AKA.com Hip-Hop Network created by Loud Records founder Steve Rifkind. In addition to Hip-Hop reviews, chart analysis, entertainment news, MP3 downloads and African-American swimsuit models, Mack routinely published editorials that touched on hot- button issues, like ineffective African-American leadership and sexual violence against women. HOT 104.com also covered several police shootings. HOT 104.com was an early promoter of urban glamour photography and online platforms, like Chuck \\"Jigsaw\\" Creekmur's Tantrum-Mag.com (a forerunner to AllHipHop.com). One of the website's biggest stories was an exclusive interview with singer Farrah Franklin (after her dismissal from Destiny's Child) where Franklin discussed her issues with Beyonce. When the late George Jackson's Urban Box Office Network (UBO.net) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2000, AKA.com lost its only source of advertising revenue and was no longer able to pay its staff and affiliate websites. For a time, HOT 104.com survived and published interviews with major rap stars like Ludacris, Fabolous, Beanie Sigel, Gangsta Boo, Pastor Troy and Fat Joe. The site also interviewed R&B; artists like Avant, Keke Wyatt and Ray J. The last interview was with the rap group Field Mob on November 16, 2002. HOT 104.com's articles are archived at the Wayback Machine. Music journalism Mack is noted for chronicling the rise of Southern hip-hop and his interviews with several of the region's major stars as they achieved national prominence, including his 2002 SMOOTH magazine cover story on Trina, his 2004 HipHopDX conversation with T.I. (during the rapper's feud with Lil Flip) and his essays on 8Ball & MJG, Mystikal and Juvenile for MTV Jams and Ozone Magazine's \\"25 Greatest Southern Artists of All Time\\" list in 2005. Mack's interview subjects included Erick Sermon, Remy Ma, Willie D, Boots Riley, The Game, David Banner, Memphis Bleek, Krayzie Bone, Layzie Bone, Styles P, Twista, Gerald LeVert and Al Green. Mack often asked questions to help aspiring artists successfully navigate the music business. In a July 2005 interview with HipHopDX, Young Jeezy told Mack: \\"There‚Äôs no business to learn. Do you. I really don‚Äôt do sh*t. I don‚Äôt watch Rap City or anything. Maybe I should, but I‚Äôm out grinding. Def Jam ain‚Äôt never dealt with a cat they had to catch up with. I be doing sh*t they don‚Äôt even know about.‚Äù After seeing a photo of Lil Wayne with guns and marijuana in VIBE magazine, Mack expressed his frustration in a July 12, 2006 interview with Velocity, saying intelligence was \\"frowned upon in the current hip-hop climate\\" and that members of the culture had \\"lost a sense of responsibility to each other.\\" This prompted him to launch a short-lived online magazine, called NUANCE, which included interviews with New Jack City screenwriter Barry Michael Cooper, black conservative author Shelby Steele and Marc Lamont Hill. Block Starz Music Mack became the marketing manager of a German hip-hop website called YoRaps.com in 2008. Later that year, he and the site's owner, Kai Denninger, formed an online record label called Block Starz Music to promote free mixtapes by the independent and unsigned artists featured in YoRaps' ‚ÄúNext 2 Blow‚Äù section, like Rasheeda. The label's early association with Wiz Khalifa helped boost the company's profile and attracted other artists. In a 2010 interview with Chicago's 88.9 FM (WIIT) Fusion radio show, Mack said his ‚Äúongoing love for the music‚Äù and desire to stay connected to the industry prompted him to develop Block Starz Music's regionally themed compilation album series, which introduced new artists like Machine Gun Kelly. The label is noted for developing YouTube stars, like Lega-C. Documentary Films Mack made his directorial debut in 2014 with the documentary film Oscar Micheaux: The Czar of Black Hollywood. He self-financed the project and released it independently through his production studio, Block Starz Music Television. In an April 2014 interview with The Washington Times, Mack said he was inspired to produce a film about Oscar Micheaux's life because it mirrored his own. The film was nominated for \\"Best Independent Documentary\\" at the 2015 Black Reel Awards. Mack is also executive producer of the critically acclaimed web series, Profiles of African-American Success. In 2016, he wrote and directed the Martin Luther King Sr. documentary In the Hour of Chaos, which takes a critical view of liberalism's effect on the black civil rights movement. The film was named runner-up at the San Francisco Black Film Festival and was featured at San Francisco's de Young Museum as part of the Bay Area's \\"MLK Day of Revelations\\". In 2019, Mack wrote and directed a documentary film on the rise and decline of the black-owned ethnic beauty industry, called No Lye: An American Beauty Story. The film premiered at the inaugural Visions of the Black Experience event presented by the Sarasota Film Festival at New College of Florida on December 5 and has been called \\"probably the best film on the history of black hair care.\\" No Lye won \\"Outstanding Independent Documentary\\" at the 2020 Black Reel Awards. Affiliations Mack is a member of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH) and the Foundation for the Advancement of African-Americans in Film (FAAAF) voting academy.

Floorwork is used extensively in modern dance, particularly Graham technique and Hawkins technique, as well as in vernacular breakdancing. Some dance training practices, notably Floor-Barre, consist entirely of floorwork. Floorwork changes the body's relationship with gravity, and requires dancers to navigate between higher and lower levels (\\"going in and out of the floor\\"). These features are central to the use of floorwork in choreography, and also affect its role in technique classes. Executing floorwork smoothly requires flexible joints, a relaxed body, and attention to the kinesthetic feedback provided by the floor. The \\"low\\" or floorwork level is one of three principal spatial levels dancers may occupy, along with the middle or bipedestrian (upright) and the high or aerial (jumping) levels. Concert dance Floorwork in a alt=A man, wearing only a dance belt, supporting himself off the ground on one arm and both feet while lifting a fist The use of floorwork is one of the major differences between modern dance and previous Western concert dance genres. Isadora Duncan incorporated floorwork in dances as early as 1911, although credit for its introduction is more often given to her successor Martha Graham. The concept is closely associated with Graham technique, because of Graham's extensive use of floorwork and widely imitated innovations, as well as the technique's unique repertoire of falls. Doris Humphrey has been credited with floorwork innovations in a concert dance context. Later movements derived from classical modern dance also used floorwork extensively. Contemporary ballet uses the floor as an integral part of the choreography, rather than the occasional kneel or collapse to be found in older romantic ballet styles. Floorwork is essential in the postmodern genre of contact improvisation, in which the floor can even be treated as a partner. B-boying Stabbed windmills, a floor-based power movealt=a dancer rolls on the ground with their legs extended and whirling in the air, then tucks their legs and spins on their back Floorwork in b-boying (breakdancing) includes floor-based footwork, or downrock, as well as certain more athletic power moves. Downrock is performed with the body supported on the hands and feet. It allows the dancer to display their proficiency with foot speed and control by performing intricate footwork combinations. The foundational move of downrock is the 6-step, although innumerable variants exist. The hands, legs and knees may also be featured or support the body. Downrock often transitions into dramatic power moves, including floor-based moves such as windmills and flares. Downrock became common in the mid-1970s; Keith and Kevin Smith, known as the \\"Nigga Twinz\\", have been credited with popularizing it, as has the original Rock Steady Crew. The emergence of floorwork was an important development in breaking, marking the end of the early or \\"old-school\\" style. Belly dance alt=a woman in an elaborate red costume lies on her back with her legs folded under her, her arms above her head, and a sword balanced on her torso Floorwork is a feature of many kinds of belly dance, often involving the manipulation of a prop while lying on the floor and intended to showcase the dancer's control. Masha Archer, as part of an effort to change what she saw as the over-sexualized and exploitative features of belly dance, rejected floorwork because she did not want audiences to look down on her dancers.

Right: the new facility The Fellhorn Lift () is a two-section gondola lift in the German Alps that runs from Birgsautal in Oberstdorf to the peak of the Fellhorn ‚Äì 1,967 metres above sea level (NN). The Fellhornbahn I, a cable car built by Habegger, entered service in 1972. It had a length of 1,869 metres and climbed through a height of 863 metres. The two track cables of each cable car route had a dimater of 50 mm, the haulage cable was 28 mm thick. Drive for the two cable cars, with their capacity of 100 passengers, was provided by an engine at the bottom station delivering 552 kW. The first section had three pylons; there were 54, 51 and 24 metres high. Since the construction of the parallel Fellhornbahn II (see below), Fellhornbahn I has been used mainly in summer. The upper section, the Gipfelbahn, built in 1973, has a length of 845.18 metres, has two pylons and climbs through 190 metres. It is driven by a 283 kW engine at the middle station. The two track cables of the second section have a diameter of 39 mm; the haulage cable is 20 mm thick. The Gipfelbahn only has one car with a capacity of 60 passengers. With a maximum speed of 8 m/s (28.8 km/h) it is able to transport 450 people per hour over this short stretch. Since 2005, the Kleinwalsertaler Bergbahn (KBB), Riezlern, has been the only owner of the Fellhorn Lift. The main shareholders of the KBB are the Allg√§uer √úberlandwerk, Kempten, and the Raiffeisen Holding Kleinwalsertal. In winter 2006/2007, a new gondola lift, the Fellhornbahn II, was built parallel to the first section by Leitner with 8-seater cabins or gondolas. It is 2,813 metres long and rises through 855 metres. At a height of about 1,300 metres it has a middle station at which passengers may board and alight and where the garage for the gondolas is based. Although the gondolas are in fact coupled and decoupled here, there is only one section because the cable runs continuously from the valley station to the top station. It is powered from the top station and hydraulically tensioned in the bottom station. It has a top speed of 6 m/s (21.6 km/h) and transport capacity of 2,400 passengers per hour. It is Germany's longest single-cable gondola lift. The Faistenoy‚ÄìH√∂fle double chairlift and the H√∂fle draglift have therefore been dismantled.

Biography Born in Managua on 15 October 1918, S√°nchez was self-taught as a writer. According to the acclaimed poet Ernesto Cardenal, she was \\"the first women of letters of Nicaragua and was of great importance as a promoter of Nicaraguan culture\\". In 1940, she founded the literary association C√≠rculo de Letras and opened the publishing house Nuevos Horizontes which played an important part in collecting and reviving Nicaragua's most significant literary works. Cardenal also tells us that \\"For a long, fruitful period for Nicaraguan literature (the 1940s and 1950s), her home was a meeting place for writers and artists, and a venue for conferences and exhibitions\\". Commenting on her second collection of poetry (Oasis, 1943), the Guatemalan critic Ramiro C√≥rdoba writes: \\"Inside her pages, we breathe in the scent of the wooded countryside but do not see the swarm of cantharides above, driving our natives into a spate of frenzied dancing.\\" For many years, she travelled through the countries of Central America promoting Nicaraguan culture. One of her conferences was devoted to the work of the Nicaraguan writer Joaqu√≠n Pasos (1914‚Äì1947), at another she presented the anti-fascist Spanish poet Le√≥n Felipe (1884‚Äì1968). S√°nchez was involved in the demands for female suffrage in her country in the 1950s although she was accused by Joaquina Vega of not being as committed as some. One of the arguments was just about whether General Emilio Chamorro was to read their demands or another person. The argument also involved the conservative Margarita Cole Zavala but the presentation to congress was in the end unimportant as it took several more years to obtain their demands. Her splendidly simple verse evokes themes common to her compatriots: pain, sadness, desolation, loneliness, premonition of death and anguish, all of which can be summarized in one word: farewell. Awards In 1945, S√°nchez was awarded the Rub√©n Dar√≠o Prize for her poetry. In the 1980s, she received the Rub√©n Dar√≠o Order of Cultural Independence.

In roles managing radio and then television news over two decades, he made key changes in significant areas of how news was broadcast.  Career  Woon began his career as a newspaper reporter, including working at the Bristol Evening Post, and later at the Daily Express, where is duties included reporting on defence and aviation. He was hired by the BBC in 1961 at a time when the corporation was seeking new talent from different backgrounds so that BBC News could better respond to the growing success of competitor ITN. His first job was as a television news reporter at Alexandra Palace, working for Tom Maltby. Due to a lack of assignments as a reporter, he moved into a position as a news editor, and in 1966 ran the half- hour programme Newsroom on BBC Two, hiring young reporting staff with newspaper experience, such as Tom Mangold and John Sergeant, and making Ken Goudie an assistant editor. In 1969 he assumed control of the BBC's radio news service. He soon introduced the use of live \\"on the spot\\" reporting and interviews during radio news bulletins. These live inserts were called in by telephone, which led to some complaints about quality, but the practice caught on and became a key aspect of the format of news reports. Woon also supported the introduction of female newsreaders. In 1979 Woon and Aubrey Singer took the decision to add a permanent female presenter to BBC Radio Four's influential Today current affairs programme. This was a significant step forward, since only six years earlier Radio Four's presentation editor had said, \\"A news announcer needs to have authority, consistency and reliability. Women may have one or two of these qualities, but not all three\\". In 1980 Woon became editor of television news, where he began the use of journalists as BBC Television newsreaders, starting with John Humphrys and John Simpson on the Nine O'Clock News; newsreading had previously been an entirely separate role. He also oversaw the launch of The Six O'Clock News. Woon received criticism over the BBC coverage of the miners' strike. In an internal BBC meeting on 20 June 1984 he said there had been \\"a general feeling in the newsroom\\" the previous evening that coverage had \\"a marginal imbalance\\". Woon later said that the editing had been difficult due to the quantity of material, but the accusations of BBC bias were wrong. He also faced criticism over the BBC's coverage of the Falklands War and the Northern Ireland conflict. Woon moved from being television news editor to holding publicity and ambassadorial roles for the BBC; in 1985 he became the BBC's representative in the United States. He retired in 1988.  Personal life  Woon was born in Bristol in 1931. He married Betty in 1956, but divorced in 1974. He was divorced by his second wife, Diana, a former colleague, in 1992. His interests included cricket, and travelling, including cruises. He served as a Governor for his former school, Christ's Hospital, and acted as a pastoral mentor for one of its students.  Death  In his final years, Woon was diagnosed with cancer. In May 2014, whilst on an Elbe River cruise, he was taken to hospital in Dresden, Germany, after suffering injuries from a fall, which led to his death at age eighty- two. He was cremated in Dresden with a funeral ceremony attended by his son, Peter and partner Frances. He left a significant bequest both to his former school, Christ's Hospital, and a dozen charities. He set up a fund for the further education and wellbeing of a former Christ's Hospital student.

McCormack stopped Avoth in the seventh round at the National Sporting Club to become British champion. McCormack successfully defended the title against Richards in November 1967, and in February 1968 faced Bob Dunlop at the Sydney Stadium for the vacant Commonwealth title; Dunlop stopped McCormack in the seventh round. McCormack made a second defence of his British title against Avoth in January 1969, and lost after being forced to retire in the eleventh round due to a cut to his left eyelid. McCormack had five further fights in 1969, winning three but losing to Guinea Roger and Tom Bogs. In April 1970 he had his final fight, another shot at the British title against Avoth; McCormack was disqualified in the eighth round. His younger brother Pat was also a successful boxer, at lightweight through to welterweight, winning the British super lightweight title in 1974.

She competed in a variety of styles and was the undefeated champion of the women's single scull from 1932 to 1934. She then became a successful administrator of the sport. During World War II, she was the secretary of the famous Vickers engineer, Barnes Wallis, and assisted him with his experiments to develop a bouncing bomb to destroy German dams. Early life Gentry was born in Barnes, close to the River Thames, and participated in water sports when young, racing dinghies at the age of six. In 1919, Weybridge Rowing Club organised celebrations of the Allied victory in the First World War and she took part in a race of ladies' fours. This was successful and she then helped establish the club's ladies' section in 1920. In 1925, she was a member of a club team which defeated crews from France, Belgium, and the Netherlands at a royal charity regatta in Brussels. She founded a separate Weybridge ladies' rowing club in 1926 and later became its chair ‚Äì a position she retained until her death. Championships and honours She rowed with her brother Frank in mixed double sculling events and they won three consecutive championships from 1924 to 1926. In 1927, she took part in the first Women's Eights Head of the River Race which her Weybridge ladies club boat won. She went on to become British single sculls champion in 1932, 1933, and 1934, and retired undefeated. She also helped administer the sport of rowing, acting as secretary of the Women's Amateur Rowing Association between 1926 and 1938, then chairing it and its successor body, the women's committee of the Amateur Rowing Association, until retiring in 1968. In 1960, she persuaded the International Rowing Federation to hold its women's European championships in London. She was awarded the Order of the British Empire for services to rowing in 1969. World War II The bouncing bomb concept for destroying dams During World War II, she worked at Vickers Armstrong as secretary for Barnes Wallis and assisted him with his famous experiments to make a bouncing bomb to destroy German dams. Wallis would catapult wooden models across the water, which Gentry would then row out to retrieve. She rowed him out on Silvermere lake and took charge to ensure that they did not capsize, saying \\"Sit down Wallis! You'll have us both in the water, and I'm in charge of this boat!\\".

Women row in all boat classes, from single scull to coxed eights, across the same age ranges and standards as men, from junior amateur through university-level to elite athlete. Typically men and women compete in separate crews although mixed crews and mixed team events also take place.See for example, International Rowing Federation sections on World Rowing Masters Regatta and World Rowing Sprints Coaching for women is similar to that for men. At an international level, the first women's races were introduced at the 1951 European Rowing Championships as test events. After three successful tests, these became official championships as accredited by the International Rowing Federation (FISA) at the 1954 European Rowing Championships. Women's rowing was added to the Olympic Games programme in 1976 at a distance of 1000 metres. This was extended to 2000 metres from 1984 onwards at world championship level, and from 1988 at the Summer Olympics, consistent with men's rowing events at the Olympics. History For most of its history, rowing has been a male dominated sport. Although rowing's roots as a sport in the modern Olympics can be traced back to the original 1896 games in Athens, it was not until the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal that women were allowed to participate (at a distance of 1000 metres) ‚Äì well after their fellow athletes in similar sports such as swimming, athletics, cycling, and canoeing. This increased the growth of women's rowing because it created the incentive for national rowing federations to support women's events. Rowing at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London included six events for women compared with eight for men. Lithograph from 1889 depicting female rower holding an oar Despite its male domination, women's competitive rowing can be traced back to the early 19th century, and an image of a women's double scull race made the cover of Harper's Weekly in 1870. Wellesley College in Massachusetts was the first school to organize a competitive rowing team for women in the late 19th century. The 19th Century English rower Ann Glanville achieved national celebrity becoming known as the champion female rower of the world; her all- women crew often winning against the best male teams. In 1892, four young women started what became ZLAC Rowing Club in San Diego, California, which is thought today to be the world's oldest continuously existing all-women's rowing club. Newnham College Boat Club was formed the following year in Cambridge, England. In 1927, the first Women's Boat Race between Oxford and Cambridge was held. For the first few years it was an exhibition, and it later became a race. Ernestine Bayer, called the \\"Mother of Women's Rowing\\", formed the Philadelphia Girls' Rowing Club in 1938. FISA, under its Swiss president Gaston Mullegg, approved at its ordinary congress on 30 August 1950 that women's rowing event would be added to the European Rowing Championships. There was opposition to women's rowing from the Swiss and Italian rowing associations but the motion was passed. It was decided that the feasibility of holding women's event would be trialled first; in the same way, the introduction of lightweight and junior championships was trialled first before the events became fully accredited. It was also decided at the August 1950 congress that women would compete over a 1000 m distance, with no reasons recorded for this decision. The normal distance for men was 2000 m and the shorter distance for women would be kept until the 1984 World Rowing Championships when women's rowing changed to 2000 m. The 1984 Summer Olympics were the last Olympic Games that used the 1000 m distance. The next FISA congress was held just prior to the 1951 European Rowing Championships where four countries had nominated women: Great Britain, France, Holland and Denmark. The congress decided that \\"international regattas for women should be held each year under the auspices of FISA, if possible as part of the European championships, either on the day before them or after them, but on no account during the actual championships.\\" Until the hiatus of the European Championships in 1973, the event for women was always held before the event for men, and in two years, the women's championships were held in different locations: in 1955 (when the men met in Ghent and the women met in Bucharest) and in 1963 (when the men met in Copenhagen and the women met in Moscow). There were no European Rowing Championships in 1952 as the men did not compete in Europe when the Summer Olympics were held in Europe that year, and the same four countries sent women to a regatta in Amsterdam. At the 1953 European Rowing Championships, the four initial countries were joined by Norway, Finland, Austria, West Germany, and Poland. But even before the 1953 European Rowing Championships had been held, FISA decided at an extraordinary congress in May 1953 that the women's events would formally become part of the European Rowing Championships starting with the 1954 European Rowing Championships. In 1988, the first Henley Women's Regatta was held. Henley Royal Regatta first included a women's singles event over the full course in 1993, followed in 2000 by eights (now Remenham Challenge Cup) and 2001 by quadruple sculls (now Princess Grace Challenge Cup). In 1997 one of the last bastions of rowing was breached when the Leander Club, one of the oldest rowing clubs in the world, voted to admit women as members. This rule met a condition imposed by UK Sport and qualified Leander to receive a ¬£1.5 million grant for refurbishment from the Lottery Sports Fund. The Club was opened to women in 1998 and appointed Olympic medallist, Debbie Flood, as its captain in 2012. At the international level, women's rowing traditionally has been dominated by Eastern European countries, such as Romania, Russia, and Bulgaria, although other countries such as Germany, Canada, the Netherlands, Great Britain, and New Zealand often field competitive teams.List of Olympic medalists in rowing (women) The United States also has had very competitive crews, and in recent years these crews have become even more competitive given the surge in women's collegiate rowing due to Title IX. Because Title IX mandates equal money spent on men's and women's sports, rowing is particularly useful due to the extremely high costs of equipment per athlete. Therefore, many schools open a rowing program only to women to financially counteract the prevalence of men's sports. As a result, many women's college rowers have not previously competed at high school or for a club team. In the United States, it is important to note that Women's Rowing is an NCAA sport, while Men's Rowing chooses to remain governed by its own regulatory body, the Intercollegiate Rowing Association (IRA). The IRA, formed in 1895, preceded the NCAA by at least ten years and provided a guideline for the rules of eligibility and sportsmanship later adopted by the NCAA when it was formed.

The watershed of the creek has an area of . Wild trout naturally reproduce within the creek. At least one bridge crosses the creek and the community of Broadway and several wetlands are in the watershed. The surficial geology in the creek's vicinity consists of Wisconsinan Till, Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift, alluvium, wetlands, and bedrock. Course Marsh Creek looking upstream Marsh Creek begins in a pond in Ross Township. It flows south for a few tenths of a mile before turning west-southwest for nearly a mile. The creek then turns south-southwest for a few miles, receiving two unnamed tributaries from the right. It eventually turns south-southwest for a few tenths of a mile, crossing State Route 4019 before reaching its confluence with Rogers Creek. Marsh Creek joins Rogers Creek upstream of its mouth. Hydrology The bankfull discharge of Marsh Creek upstream of Silo Road is . Downstream of that road, the bankfull discharge is . Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Marsh Creek is above sea level. The elevation of the creek's source is between above sea level. A 360-foot section of Marsh Creek upstream of Silo Road has a bankfull width of and a bankfull depth of . This gives it a relatively low width to depth ratio of 6.6. The creek's channel at this location has a low sinuosity of 1.1 and an entrenchment ratio of 16.0. A 440-foot section of Marsh Creek downstream of Silo Road has a bankfull depth of and a bankfull width of . This gives it a much higher width to depth ratio than the section further upstream: 16.5 to 22.5. Like the upper segment, the channel at this location has a sinuosity of 1.1, but its entrenchment ratio is much lower at 2.0 to 4.3. The slope of Marsh Creek near Silo Road ranges from 0.0011 to 0.0037. Upstream of Silo Road, the streambed of Marsh Creek mainly consists of fine sand. Downstream of that road, the streambed consists of coarse gravel, with an average particle size of . The surficial geology along the creek in its lower reaches mainly consists of alluvium. Further away from the creek, there is a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till, as well as a few patches of Wisconsinan Ice-Contact Stratified Drift and bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale. There is Wisconsinan Outwash near the mouth of the creek and two patches of wetland near Broadway. The upper reaches of the watershed are mainly dominated by Wisconsinan Till, with bedrock occurring along the edges of the watershed. There are also a few patches of alluvium and three patches of wetland. Watershed The watershed of Marsh Creek has an area of . The area of the portion that is upstream of Silo Road is . The mouth of the creek is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Shickshinny. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Sweet Valley. A large slope separates the northern part of the watershed from the main stem watershed of Huntington Creek. This hill descends up to from the Marsh Creek watershed to the Huntington Creek watershed. Marsh Creek is approximately north-northwest of the planned Bell Bend Nuclear Power Plant. The creek is also near the small community of Broadway. A road known as Silo Road crosses the creek, separating it into two distinct reaches. A report by Land Studies described Marsh Creek as being one of the most stable stream reaches in its area. It is similar in terms of geology and land use to Walker Run. Marsh Creek is an E5-type stream upstream of Silo Road and a C4-type stream downstream of that road. History Marsh Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1180447. In 1908, a stone arch bridge over Marsh Creek was proposed. The bridge was to cost $800.00. A prestressed box beam or girders bridge was constructed across Marsh Creek in 1936 and was repaired in 2010. The bridge has a length of . A casing well was once dug through through glacial drift on the west bank of Marsh Creek. A school known as the Broadway School was also historically located near the creek.

Also known as Kruzgamepa, it is located on the southeast bank of the Kruzgamepa River, about south of milepost 65 of the Kougarok Road. The location gained prominence in the early 20th century because of its thermal hot springs, which made agricultural homesteading possible, and which were adapted to provide a respite for the gold miners of Nome. Early buildings, built 1900‚Äì03, were of log construction, and included a log cabin, barn and chicken house. A roadhouse and saloon were built after 1903, but were destroyed by fire in 1908, after the mining boom had ended. After the flu epidemic of 1918, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Nome built a large orphanage at the site, complete with a large church, dormitory and school, and living quarters for the staff, as well as greenhouses. These facilities were kept warm by water piped from the hot springs. The site was closed in 1941, but soon reopened as a recreational facility for the military, serving until the end of World War II. When surveyed in 1977 prior to listing on the National Register of Historic Places, the buildings on the site were in deteriorated condition. The site is owned by Unaataq LLC, a consortium of area Alaska native corporations which is working on development alternatives for the site, including power generation and tourism.

Copleston fled, and implored all his influential friends at the royal court to procure him a pardon from Queen Elizabeth, which eventually he received, but not without having had to pay a large fine which necessitated the sale of thirteen of his manors in Cornwall.

History It was established in 1893, and its first director was Hans Aronson. It was initially located in an old factory building in Charlottenburg which had been only slightly modernized. The institute's 60 horses, whose blood was used in serum research, were in rented stables. Under Aronson's leadership, the institute developed one of the first successful commercially produced antitoxic antisera against diphtheria, in direct competition with Emil von Behring, which was claimed by Schering to be much more effective than Behring's serum.Derek S.

In the 1920s the institute expanded significantly and took over the entire Schering complex in Charlottenburg, as the other Schering departments were moved to other facilities.Helmut Engel, Stefi Jersch-Wenzel, Wilhelm Treue, Geschichtslandschaft Berlin: Orte und Ereignisse, vol. 1, part 1, p. 21, 1986 The Department of Bacteriology remained in Charlottenburg due to the stables and laboratories being located there.

Built in 1839, this two-story brick house is one of the few of that period to survive Skowhegan's industrialization later in the 19th century. The house has served as a local history museum since 1937. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The History House is set on the south side of Elm Street, between it and the Kennebec River, at the junction of Elm with Norridgewock Avenue and Pleasant Street. It is a two-story brick structure, five bays wide, with a side-gable roof and two end chimneys. The brick is laid in a modified English bond, with seven rows of stretchers followed by a course of headers. Its Greek Revival styling includes a simple cornice and returns at the gable ends, sidelight windows and pilasters flanking the main entrance, and granite sills and lintels. A fireproof museum wing was added to the rear of the house in 1935. The house was built in 1839 by Abner Spear, a blacksmith, and was a fairly typical small worker's house of the period. Most similar buildings in Skowhegan were lost due to the city's industrialization over the remainder of the 19th century. The house was acquired by Louise Coburn, a local historian, who in 1937, opened its doors as a museum. The rear addition, added at that time, was executed with sympathetic techniques and styling. The museum is open Tuesday-Saturday between May and October, or by appointment. Its collections are focused on local history, and include unique documents and artifacts.

The physical size of the campus also expanded as North Campus was constructed. Bonisteel spearheaded the efforts to purchase the first 267 acres of land for the development. By 1958, eight new buildings had been built on North Campus, as well as the first three units of married and family student housing, Northwood Apartments. Bonisteel also represented the university as a Regent on trips outside of the U.S. In 1954, he traveled with University Vice President Marvin L. Niehus, to visit alumni groups in Taiwan, Tokyo, and Hong Kong (citation). The two men also inspected the Institute of Public Administration of the University of the Philippines. Other Organizational Leadership Bonisteel was active on numerous boards and committees relating to education, the law and politics. In addition to his extensive time as a Regent for the University of Michigan, he served on the board of trustees of Dickinson College from 1959-1962. In 1956, he was appointed to the Board of Governors of Wayne State University. Bonisteel also served with George Romney as a 1961-1962 delegate to Michigan's Constitutional Convention. Philanthropy He helped establish the \\"Friends of the Michigan Historical Collections\\" for the purpose of raising funds for a new building to house those collections. He also provided the Bonisteel Endowment fund to the University of Michigan. The fund supported a variety of University programs and projects including the Wilbur K. Pierpont Fund in the School of Business Administration, the Memorial Law Fund, the Clements Library, and the Bentley Historical Library. Bonisteel also provided substantial funding towards a planetarium at Dickenson College. Awards In 1964, the University of Michigan awarded him an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. In 1972, the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan honored Bonisteel's memory by naming the major street through the University of Michigan's North Campus Bonisteel Boulevard. Personal life Bonisteel married Lillian (Coleman) Rudolph in 1914. They had five children: Jean Ellen (Knecht), Betty Dame (Johnson), Frances Coleman (Fisher), Nancy Ann (Calcutt), and Roscoe Osmond Jr. References Category:1903 births Category:1972 deaths Category:20th-century American lawyers Category:University of Michigan people Category:Regents of the University of Michigan ","title":"Roscoe Bonisteel"},{"id":"45661310","text":"N√°dra≈æ√≠ Veleslav√≠n (English: Veleslav√≠n Station) is a station on Line A of the Prague Metro.

Initially, the station did not have escalator leading to the vestibule to the street, so people arriving to or going from the airport had to be helped by special staff. Therefore, in 2017 a decision was made to build additional escalators at a cost of 33 million Czech crowns. The planned name for the station was initially just Veleslav√≠n. Authorities later changed it to the current station name, due to it being next to the Praha-Veleslav√≠n station as well as for the nearby tram and bus stop stops of the same name.

Although his position as monarch was ceremonial rather than executive, he was a prominent local politician whose career was temporarily interrupted by sectarian violence in 1999. Early life and enthronement He was born in Dufa Dufa on Ternate as the third son of the 47th Sultan of Ternate, Mohammad Djabir Sjah. He was educated in Ternate, Makassar and Jakarta. However, his youth coincided with the Independence of Indonesia and the winding down of traditional forms of rule. Mohammad Djabir had little authority after 1950 as he stayed permanently in Jakarta, and in 1965 a law deprived the North Malukan Sultans their rights of representation in the administration.I.R.A. Arsad (2018) \\"Contestation of aristocratic and non-aristocratic politics in the political dynamic in North Maluku\\", in Rukminto Adi & Rochman Achwan (eds) Competition and Cooperation in Social and Political Sciences. Leiden: CRC press. Mudaffar came back to Ternate in 1966 and was active in a movement to restore the adat (body of traditions) of the old sultanate. His followers regarded him as his father's heir. However, the old Sultan Mohammad Djabir meddled in the local politics from his base in Jakarta, leading to internal conflicts between factions. In 1968 Mudaffar was ordered by the government to put a stop to the restoration movement. In the elections for the regional North Maluku Assembly in 1971, he was a candidate for the ruling Golkar party, and was actually elected.C.F. van Fraassen (1987) Ternate, de Molukken en de Indonesische Archipel. Leiden: Rijksmuseum te Leiden, Vol. I, p. 64-5. The prince was seen as an unlikely candidate to succeed his father as Sultan, but in 1975 on the death of his father he was chosen as heir apparent. He was inaugurated as the new Sultan in 1986. However, the central authorities in Jakarta made clear that they regarded the installation as non-official.Kal Muller (1997) Maluku: Indonesian Spice islands. Singapore: Periplus, p. 108. Political career In 1977 Mudaffar Sjah became member of the People's Representative Council of Indonesia (DPR). He served as member of the political party Golkar. In 1987, one year after his inauguration as Sultan, he became provincial chairman of the party in North Maluku. After the outbreak of communal violence in Ambon in 1999, disturbances temporarily spilled over to North Maluku which was just about to be reconstituted as a new province, with the Sultan as one of the candidates for the governorship. Mudaffar made efforts to protect the local Christians from persecution, but fighting broke out in November 1999 between followers of the Sultan and forces loyal to his rivals for the governorship of North Maluku. The Sultan of Tidore joined the adversaries, blowing new life in the age-old rivalry between Ternate and Tidore. The fighting drove Christians to flight to other islands and was followed by severe massacres in Tobelo in Halmahera. Mudaffar was temporarily removed from Ternate by the central authorities, though he soon returned. Fighting in North Maluku receded in 2001, and the Sultan was at length able to keep a strong position locally.John T. Sidel (2007) Riots, pogroms, jihad: Religious violence in Indonesia. Singapore: NUS Press, p. 181-2. Apart from his position as Sultan he also served on the North Maluku Representatives Council. As a leader, he was locally considered to be a judicious and fair person who took the right decisions and was able to reconstruct the traditions of the sultanate after a long hiatus.https://suaramalukudotcom.wordpress.com/2016/01/22/inilah-kisah- panjang-gonjang-ganjing-kesultanan-ternate/ He suffered from lung cancer before his death in the Pondok Indah Hospital in South Jakarta. His death was followed by disputes within the family as to which son was entitled to the dignity; eventually his brother Sjarifuddin Sjah was appointed.https://suaramalukudotcom.wordpress.com/2016/09/05/sultan-ternate- yang-baru-sudah-dilantik/ In 2013 Mudaffar Sjah appeared in the second episode of Bill Bailey's Jungle Hero, where Bailey had an audience with the Sultan to request permission to search for birds-of-paradise in the former territories of the Sultanate. Family Sultan Mudaffar Sjah married the following wives: * Nelly Manoppo from Menado * Thalha binti Marhi * Drevenlya * Nita Budhi Susanti from Java He had fifteen children, nine sons and six daughters, including: * Iskandar Sjah * Ronny Muhammad Ghazali Sjah * Muhammad Usman Sjah * Hidayat Sjah * Nuzuluddin Sjah * Firman Sjah * Syahmardan Sjah * Ali Muhammad Sjah * Gajah Mada Sjah * Monalisa Mihir Sjah * Soraya Sjah * Aya Sofia Sjah * Wiryawati Sjah * Nabila Maryam Sjah * Azka Nukila Sjah See also * List of rulers of Maluku * Sultanate of Ternate * Maluku sectarian conflict References Category:1935 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Ternate Sultanate Category:People from Maluku Islands Category:Sultans of Ternate Category:Golkar politicians Category:Members of the People's Representative Council Category:People from North Maluku Category:Politicians from North Maluku ","title":"Mudaffar Sjah"},{"id":"45661400","text":"Leptogenys hysterica, is a species of ant of the subfamily Ponerinae.

The Union took a moderate approach, advocating staged introduction of suffrage starting with local elections, and working with male allies in the Chamber of Deputies. Foundation The UFSF was founded by a group of feminists who had attended a national congress of French feminists in Paris in 1908. Most of them were from bourgeois or intellectual backgrounds. The leaders were Jane Misme (1865‚Äì1935), editor of La Fran√ßaise, and Jeanne Schmahl (1846‚Äì1915). The UFSF provided a less militant and more widely acceptable alternative to the Suffrage des femmes organization of Hubertine Auclert (1848‚Äì1914). The sole objective, as published in La Fran√ßaise early in 1909, was to obtain women's suffrage through legal approaches. The founding meeting of 300 women was held in February 1909. C√©cile Brunschvicg (1877‚Äì1946) was made secretary-general. She was the wife of the philosopher L√©on Brunschvicg. Eliska Vincent accepted the position of honorary vice-president. The UFSF was formally recognized by the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (IWFA) congress in London in April 1909 as representing the French suffrage movement. Before World War I The UFSF expanded quickly as Brunschwicg toured the provinces lecturing on feminism, and feminist school teachers organized local chapters. Sarah Monod, the dignified president of the National Council of French Women, became a member. Jeanne M√©lin, a member of the French Section of the Workers' International, joined the UFSF. Louise Bodin, later to become prominent in the French Communist Party, was among the founders in March 1913 of a local UFSF group in Ille-et-Vilaine. By 1914 there were 12,000 members in 75 of the French departments. The UFSF strategy included collaboration with parliamentary representatives who supported women's suffrage such as Ferdinand Buisson, and a gradual process of enfranchisement that would start with votes in local elections. Universal male suffrage had been granted in 1848. In February 1914 the extension of the 1848 act to women was introduced in the Chamber of Deputies, but did not pass. In April 1914 the UFSF was involved in the plebiscite organized by Marguerite de Witt-Schlumberger (1853‚Äì1924) with ballot boxes placed in newsstands and other public places. 505,972 ballots checked \\"I want to vote\\" and 114 were negative. The UFSF was generally against militant demonstrations, although it did participate in the 6,000-strong \\"Condorcet Demonstration\\". This was organized in Paris on 5 July 1914 by the journalist S√©verine (Caroline R√©my), weeks before the outbreak of World War I. File:Womens suffrage demonstration in Paris on 5 July 1914 - Le Figaro.jpgWomen's suffrage demonstration in Paris on 5 July 1914 Later years The UFSF suspended the suffrage campaign during World War I (1914‚Äì18) and supported the government. After the war it was assumed that the government would give women the vote in recognition of their wartime contributions, and in fact the Chamber of Deputies passed a women's suffrage bill in 1919. However, the Senate blocked the bill, and continued to block the bill each time it was reintroduced. The chamber of deputies voted to give women the right to vote by 329 to 95 on 20 May 1919, but were blocked by the Senate. The deputies voted in favor of the women's franchise again on 7 April 1925 (389 to 140), on 12 July 1927 (396 to 94), on 21 March 1932 (446 to 60), on 1 March 1935 (453 to 124) and on 30 July 1936 (495 to 0). Each time the Senate blocked the motion. In response to this Senate resistance the UFSF collaborated with the more militant Louise Weiss (1893‚Äì1983) for a short time but generally remained moderate and continued to work with allies among the deputies. Brunschwicg continued to lead the UFSF, which expanded after 1922 and by 1928 had 100,000 members. In 1936 Premier L√©on Blum appointed Brunschwicg undersecretary for national education. Blum introduced a suffrage bill in 1936, again blocked by the Senate. During World War II (1939‚Äì45) the UFSF was inactive. General Charles de Gaulle granted women's suffrage in 1944, and Brunschwicg therefore chose not to revive the UFSF.

Originally built in 1834 and 1838 to house Ellsworth Town Hall and the Hancock County courthouse, they are now owned and occupied by the Courthouse Art Gallery. The buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Description and history The former courthouse and town hall occupy a triangular parcel of land bounded by Court Street, US 1, and Maine State Route 172, across the Union River from Ellsworth's central business district. Most of the lot is grassy, sloping up to Court Street, where the courthouse stands to the south and the town hall to the north. Both buildings face the green to the east. The courthouse has a first floor of brick, but both buildings are otherwise wooden frame, 1-1/2 stories in height, with a side gable roof, clapboard siding, and a granite foundation. In both cases the roof extends over an arcade in the Doric order at both the front and rear of the building; that of the courthouse has eight columns, while that of the town hall has six. The courthouse front has two large gable-roof dormers in the front, with paired double windows topped by a small lunette; a similar dormer appears on the rear. The triangular parcel on which the buildings stand was given to the town in 1833 by the Hebert family, with the proviso that the town hall be built there, and the county courthouse, should Ellsworth be chosen as Hancock County's county seat. The town hall was built in 1834; after the town was named county seat in 1837, it and the property were transferred to the county, which built the courthouse in 1838. The county used the buildings as a courthouse and registry until 1886, when those facilities were moved to newer and larger quarters. This property was given back to the city, which repurposed the courthouse as a high school, later expanding into the former town hall, joining the two building via an unheated covered passage. The school closed in 1924, and the buildings were subsequently condemned due to their deteriorating condition. Public outcry forestalled this, and the buildings were gradually rehabilitated in the 1960s, seeing occasional use by community organizations. The courthouse was sold to private owners in 2005, with preservation restrictions, and is now operated as the Courthouse Gallery. The gallery has since expanded into the adjacent former town hall.

Education & legal career He graduated from the University of Michigan with a Bachelor of Arts in 1995 and from the Western Michigan University Cooley Law School with a Juris Doctor in 2003. Courser was admitted to the State Bar of Michigan in 2006 and continues to practice law in his firm, Todd A. Courser & Associates, PLLC.http://www.courserlaw.com/ Courser Law Electoral history Courser ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the Michigan House of Representatives in 2008, for the Michigan Senate in 2010, and for the state Board of Education in 2012. In 2013, Courser unsuccessfully challenged incumbent Chairman of the Michigan Republican Party, Bobby Schostak. In 2014, Courser again ran for a seat in the Michigan House of Representatives. A primary election was held on August 5, 2014, and a general election was held on November 4, 2014. The signature-filing deadline for candidates wishing to run in this election was April 22, 2014. Margaret Guerrero-DeLuca defeated Immanuel Eickholdt in the Democratic primary. Todd Courser defeated Jacob Hunsanger, Jan Peabody and Sharna Smith in the Republican primary. Courser defeated DeLuca in the general election. Sex scandal The Detroit News published audio recordings on August 7, 2015, in which Courser asked staff to create a rumor that he had sex with a male prostitute in order to distract from the affair he was having with Cindy Gamrat, also a member of the Michigan House of Representatives. Kevin Cotter, the Speaker of the Michigan House, initiated an investigation into their use of public funds to cover up their affair. Despite calls to resign from office, Courser claimed he was being blackmailed by mainstream Michigan Republicans and would not resign. In the pre-dawn hours of September 11, 2015, Courser resigned after several hours of a stalemate on his expulsion vote. Gamrat was subsequently expelled from the House. Courser announced that he would run in the special election to fill his vacated seat. Courser finished in fifth place in the primary election, with less than 4% of the vote. Courser was charged with four felonies his role in the scandal on February 26, 2016, by Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette. He was charged with three separate counts of official misconduct, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and one count of perjury, which carries a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison. Courser is represented by Portage-based attorney Matthew S. DePerno. In April of 2016, Courser announced his candidacy for Lapeer County Prosecutor. He was unsuccessful in the August Republican primary, garnering about 4% of the vote. Both Courser and Gamrat launched their own independent radio programs on WFDF-AM (910) in April, and then May respectively, of 2016. In 2016, Lansing District Court Judge Hugh B. Clarke Jr. ordered Courser to stand trial on two felony counts (one count of perjury and count of misconduct in office), while dismissing both felony counts against Gamrat. In 2019, Courser plead guilty to contest to willful neglect of duty by a public officer, a misdemeanor. He received probation.

She is a pioneer in the area of biological regulation in which enzymes that destroy specific other proteins, called proteases, play a central role inside the cell. She discovered and elucidated the central features of a new family of proteases that require energy for their function in the form of ATP-hydrolysis. She has also played a major role in the discovery and characterization of bacterial small RNAs. Early life and education Gottesman was born on May 19, 1945, in New York. Her father was trained as an accountant and ran a company that made rotisseries and other small appliances. Her mother was a high school teacher and later became a guidance counselor. In fifth or sixth grade, Gottesman was given a book titled Microbe Hunters. This book inspired her scientific career as she became fascinated with the importance and puzzling nature of scientific research. She continued her curiosity in science by attending a summer program in high school. It was a research opportunity held at Waldemar in Long Island, New York. Gottesman attributed this opportunity to the emphasis on science and technology during the Cold War. This experience helped fuel her passion for science, as she was introduced to genetics, DNA, cancer, and bacteria. Gottesman received a B.A. in biochemical sciences in 1967 from Radcliffe College and a Ph.D. in microbiology from Harvard University in 1972. She did her postdoctoral training from 1971 to 1974 in NCI's Laboratory of Molecular Biology. From 1974 to 1976, she was a research associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before returning as a senior investigator to NCI's Laboratory of Molecular Biology. She is co-chief of that Laboratory and head of its Biochemical Genetics Section.  Scientific contributions  Gottesman was a graduate student at Harvard in the 1960s and worked with Jon Beckwith. Their worked involved studying the lac operon to further understand the E. coli arabinose operon. From their research, they were able to show that a transducing bacteriophage could work for the arabinose operon. Previous studies had only shown success in the lac operon, but the lambda phage was successful for the arabinose operon in her testing. Gottesman's later research at the National Institutes of Health used this lambda phage to understand how bacteriophages are able to insert themselves into a bacterial chromosome and then subsequently remove themselves. Susan Gottesman is known for her work with small RNAs and ATP-dependent proteases. Her work in these subjects has been celebrated by scientists such as Princeton University professor Thomas Silhavy and former Princeton professor David Botstein. Gottesman focused her research on E. coli cells and the process of gene regulation. She began studying the mechanism for energy-dependent proteolysis, but stumbled upon small RNAs in the process. Small RNA are short RNA sequences that have a wide variety of functions within cells. They have been shown to be vital in cell processes such as growth, cell differentiation, and defense. The small RNAs have also been shown to be a factor in certain diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and liver disease. The ATP-dependent proteases are shown to maintain the level of regulatory proteins and to get rid of any misfolded or damaged proteins. They bind to their specific substrates by sequence recognition or by chemical and conformation interactions. In Gottesman's studies, she showed that the ATP-dependent proteases are regulated by the delivery of their substrate molecules by anti- adaptor and adaptor protein. This finding has been shown of specific importance in the study of bacterial general stress response. Along with the ATP-dependent proteases, the small RNA molecules are an important part of this response. For example, one of these small RNAs in Gottesman's research was found to positively regulate the translation of RpoS, a stress sigma factor of E. coli. The DsrA small RNA helps to translate the RpoS factor by binding to the RpoS leader sequence.

Experiments on the bouncing bomb concept for destroying dams were conducted on the mere. Silvermere is an estate in Surrey, England named after its mere ‚Äì a shallow lake of about ten acres which has a silvery appearance when seen from the surrounding slopes. It was created in the 19th century for the rich architect, William Atkinson, and subsequently became the home of the Seth Smith family, who had also become wealthy from property development. An ancient British burial mound was found on the land and the Silvermere Urn was found within. During World War II, the mere was used for experiments to develop and test the bouncing bomb. The estate is now a golf course and the final green is on an island in the mere. Atkinson family It was part of the estate of the Oatlands Palace until 1830, when the architect William Atkinson bought 170 acres of land with the lake and erected a house there. He lived there for ten years until his death, when he was succeeded by his son Henry. The land had been mostly undeveloped heath, but Atkinson was interested in horticulture. He planted a large variety of rare plants and trees, including a comprehensive collection of pines which was one of the finest in England. The farmhouse of the estate was made of peat turf and the dairy had a similar turf roof which worked well to keep it cool. The Silvermere Urn To construct Atkinson's house, earth was removed and this was found to be a burial mound. Three burial urns were found containing bones and charcoal. They were earthenware made of light clay and about eighteen inches tall. They seemed to be ancient British of a similar antiquity to the Iron Age settlement found on nearby St George's Hill, labelled among two other knolls south of the Thames which had borne celtic artefacts at various times in the 17th to 19th centuries as Caesar's Camp. Bouncing bombs During the Second World War, the estate was owned by the Seth Smith family which had made a fortune developing Belgravia. Vickers staff from Weybridge were dispersed to this area and facilities for developing the bouncing bomb were based nearby in Foxwarren Park. In 1942, Barnes Wallis and his secretary, rowing champion Amy Gentry, rowed out onto the lake where Wallis fired differently-shaped models from a catapult and Gentry then rowed to retrieve them.

Biography Wegner was born in Weinsberg near Heilbronn, Germany, in 1949. He graduated from Williston Academy in Easthampton, Mass. in 1968 and from Theodor-Heuss-Gymnasium in Heilbronn in 1969. From 1969 to 1974 he studied industrial engineering at the University of Karlsruhe finishing with an MBA to be followed by two years as a visiting Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, B.C., Canada. His thesis titled ‚ÄûAnalysis of two-level grammars‚Äú was submitted and defended in Karlsruhe in 1977 with Hermann Maurer and Thomas Ottmann being the referees. In 1982 he received the venia legendi in applied computer science from the University of Karlsruhe with an inaugural dissertation (Habilitationsschrift) on Quicksort variants for multisets. Examiners were Thomas Ottmann, Wolfgang Janko and Jan van Leeuwen (Utrecht). In 1984 he was appointed professor at the Hochschule Fulda (Fulda University of Applied Sciences) and went from there in 1987 to the University of Kassel where he served as full professor and chairman of the database group since 1989 until his retirement in March 2015.Katja Rudolph: \\"Pioneer of Zeroes and Ones: Prof. Lutz Wegner retires (in German)\\", Hessische/Nieders√§chsische Allgemeine, Kassel, 23 March 2015. Retrieved on 1 April 2015 Lutz Wegner is divorced and has three children. Achievements Lutz Wegner started his career with fundamental research on two-level grammars, also known as van Wijngaarden grammars which had been used to define the programming language Algol68. His results were included in the Handbook of Formal Languages by Arto Salomaa and Grzegorz Rozenberg.A. Mateescu and A. Salomaa: Wijngaarden (two-level) grammars. in Handbook of Formal Languages, Vol. 1, G. Rozenberg and A. Salomaa (Eds.), Springer 1997, S. 210-217. For his second thesis he developed variants of Quicksort suitable for multiset and proved that they achieved the lower bound for quicksort algorithms previously given by Robert Sedgewick. Following a sabbatical stay at the IBM Scientific Center Heidelberg he took an interest in the Non-First Normal-Form data model, also known as nested relational model, and designed a graphical editor which also served as base for research on synchronous groupware. In 1986 he authored an E-learning course \\"Introduction to Unix\\", which originally was a contribution to Hermann Maurer's COSTOC-Project, and with several portings was in active use until 2015, thus constituting one of the longest running examples of courseware. Besides his scientific achievements Wegner was instrumental in introducing computer science studies (Bachelor and Master) at the University of Kassel which started in 2001 after securing three additional, sponsored professorships with Traudl Herrhausen, then a member of the Hessian Parliament, opening doors to industry and charities.Sebastian Mense: \\"Founder of Kassel's computer science retires - by now 200 new students annually (in German)\\" , University of Kassel press office, Kassel, 9 March 2015.

Born in Anteb, Turkey, on the border of Syria, he was the eldest child of Moussa Haim Douek and Zarifa Harari. In November 1952, Rabbi Douek was appointed by the chief rabbi of Egypt, Rabbi Haim Nahoum to join the rabbinical body of Cairo's chief rabbinate. Last Chief Rabbi of Egypt Hakham Haim Moussa Douek At age 5, Haim Moussa Douek's family moved to Cairo in 1910. He attended the Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle School during the day, and a Jewish studies program (Keter Torah) after school. Rabbinical life Rabbi Douek studied for his rabbinical degree from 1918 to 1933 at the Great Yeshivah Keter Torah in Cairo, studying under Rabbi Yossef Pinto and Rabbi Haim Nahoum, the Chief Rabbi at that time. He was ordained as Rabbi in 1933. He was one of the founders of the well known Ahaba Ve Ahva Synagogue, located at 4 Midan El Daher in Cairo. The government considered the synagogue a Zionist stronghold and closed it in 1957. His rabbinical position at the synagogue included the teaching of Torah to students including: Maurice (Moshe) Dayan, Chief Rabbi of L'Lile, France; Joseph Hayon, Chief Rabbi of Colombia; Massoud El-Baz, Chief Rabbi of Sudan; Jacob Nefoussi, Grand Rabbi of Alexandria; and Joseph Hamaoui, a well-known rabbi in Brooklyn, NY; and Halfon Savdia, rabbi of Ahaba Ve Ahva in Brooklyn. In November 1952, Rabbi Douek was appointed by the chief rabbi of Egypt to join the rabbinical body of Cairo's chief rabbinate. In 1954, he was appointed Chairman of the Beit Din (Jewish Rabbinical Court).Rabbi Abraham Choueka, Letter of Attestation [French], July 20, 1962 in Family Archive. He was also appointed by the Egyptian Ministry of Justice as a Judge in the Jewish Primary and Appellate courts, which were a division of the Jewish domestic relations court. King Farouk was removed from power in 1952 during a revolution that placed Gamal Abdel Nasser in power. In January 1956, he abolished the domestic relations court and required all decisions be made in civil court, instead of the religious court. The Egyptian Ministry of Justice appointed Rabbi Douek as a Notary Delegate in charge of all matters affecting the personal relations of Jews. This included authority on issues involving marriage, divorce, wills, children and disposition of assets.\\"La Nouvelle Loi du Statut Personnel: Designation de notaires religieux pour l'enregistrement des marriage et divorces, [French], La Reforme, January 2, 1956, p. 2. He was also the rabbinic authority designated to issue all official documents from the chief rabbinate. In September 1956, Rabbi Douek was appointed as deputy to Chief Rabbi Haim Nahoum, who recommended that Rabbi Haim Douek succeed him as Chief Rabbi of Egypt. When Rabbi Haim Nahoum's died in November 1960, Rabbi Haim Douek assumed responsibility for leading the Jewish community as the nation's last Chief Rabbi. At the time, the number of Jews in Egypt had dwindled to about 10,000 due to the changing political environment in Egypt. Rabbi Douek continued to preside over a community that was gradually emptying out of Egypt as they made their way to Israel, the United States and other countries. On June 5, 1967, during the Six-Day War with Israel, Rabbi Douek and his family were ordered to go to the offices of the Chief Rabbinate, where they were held under house arrest for two weeks without outside contact. When the Egyptian government allowed Rabbi Douek to reopen the Chief Rabbinate, families of the detained men flooded his office. Rabbi Douek fielded questions from families about where their sons and brothers were detained. Still there was police presence outside and secret police inside his offices. Rabbi Douek helped families with finances, health coverage, and schools. After almost three month he was able with the help of the Red Cross to have family visitation. Rabbi Douek made sure the synagogues remained open, that there was kosher food available and that the children received a Jewish education. Rabbi Douek contacted President Nasser, the Red Cross, members of the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior, and other organizations to put pressure on the Egyptian government to make it easier for families to be in touch with their loved ones in detention. The Six Day War had further accelerated the decline of the Jewish community. In 1968 there were about 2,000 Jews in Egypt, down from about 80,000 twenty years earlier. Rabbi Douek met with Egyptian politicians and dignitaries from around the world to obtain relief for the Egyptian Jews so they could leave the country. After three and a half years, all the detainees were released and permitted to leave Egypt with their families. By 1971, there were only 300 members of the community remaining. Many of these were families with young children. Rabbi Douek advised them to leave Egypt, since he saw no future there for the families. Rabbi Douek led Egypt's Jewish population during a period of political turmoil and instability. Rabbi Douek left Egypt for France in March 1972. Prior to leaving, he made sure that the remaining Jews had their religious needs met. There was a Hazzan (cantor) in the synagogue, a shokhet, as well as someone to assist with Kadish (funeral services). He saw to it that all the active synagogues remained open and maintained and that the cemetery was maintained. In addition, he made sure that kosher wine and matzo was available for Passover. In October 1972, he immigrated to New York with his children. In New York, Rabbi Douek became active in the Egyptian community under one Ahaba ve Ahva Congregation. In addition, he became active in the plight of Syrian and Iraqi Jews, who were persecuted in those countries. His devoted his time to raise awareness of their situation and to help them leave those countries. He died in Brooklyn, New York, on August 20, 1974, is buried on the Mount of Olives Har Hazeitim in Jerusalem, Israel. His memorial collection of books was donated by his family to Yeshiva University New York in 1984.

Before her retirement in 2011, she had served as associate director for research on women's health at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and had directed NIH's Office of Research on Women's Health. Pinn also previously taught at Harvard University and Tufts University (where she also served as assistant dean of student and minority affairs) in Massachusetts, as well as Howard University College of Medicine (where she also chaired the Department of Pathology) in Washington, D.C. Since retiring from NIH, Pinn has continued working as a senior scientist emerita at NIH's Fogarty International Center. Early life Pinn was born on a farm in Halifax, Virginia. She attended segregated schools in Lynchburg. From the age of 4, Pinn was interested in a medical career, especially since she assisted both sets of her grandparents with their health concerns (including some insulin injections) and observed the relief they experienced after a doctor visit. Education Pinn graduated from high school as valedictorian of her class. Considering her education beyond high school, Pinn explored a wide variety of options, including DePauw and Wellesley, and decided on Wellesley, the last acceptance letter she received. Pinn won a scholarship to Wellesley College, earning a bachelor of arts degree there in zoology in 1962. She took a leave of absence from college during sophomore year to care for her mother, who was ailing from a metastatic bone tumor; the cancer had been erroneously diagnosed as arthritis. In the wake of her mother's diagnosis, treatment, and eventual death from the disease, Pinn's desire to become a doctor was cemented. Based upon her mother's experience, she resolved to listen to her patients, pay attention to their complaints, and be open-minded about practicing medicine. After Wellesley In 1967, Pinn earned her medical degree from the University of Virginia School of Medicine, where she was the only woman and only African- American student in her class. Pinn planned to become a pediatrician until she took a summer internship position as a research assistant at Massachusetts General Hospital. She worked there throughout medical school, with Benjamin Barnes and Martin Flax, in the areas of experimental transplant surgery and immunopathology. That training, spurred her lifelong interests in research and academic medicine, forming the basis for Pinn's eventual career in renal and transplant pathology. She completed her residency in pathology at Mass General while serving as a teaching fellow at Harvard Medical School. In 1970, Pinn joined the pathology department at Tufts University School of Medicine, where she served as assistant professor and assistant dean of student affairs. Her 12 years there were recognized by Tufts over the subsequent decades with numerous honors and awards. Career in pathology Pinn joined the staff and faculty of Howard University Hospital in 1982, serving as professor and chair of the pathology department. At the time of her appointment, Pinn became the third woman and the first African-American woman to lead a U.S. pathology department. In 1989, Pinn was installed as president of the National Medical Association (NMA). NMA is the nation's oldest and largest organization representing African-American physicians and health professionals in the United States. Established in 1895, the NMA is the collective voice of more than 30,000 African-American physicians and the patients they serve. Leaving academic medicine In 1998, Pinn briefed Sarah, Duchess of York, on medical research topics regarding women Dr. Vivian Pinn with actress Geena Davis at a presentation on gender portrayals and health, at the National Institutes of Health in 2011 In 1991, Pinn was appointed as first director of the new Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH) at NIH and first permanent NIH associate director of research on women's health. The ORWH was established in September 1990 to strengthen and enhance NIH's efforts to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of illnesses in women, and to enhance research related to diseases and conditions that affect women. The office helps establish NIH goals and policies for women's health issues and assures that all appropriate clinical trials include the participation of women. In her 20 years as ORWH director, Pinn employed her position as a federal policymaker to raise awareness of women's health issues and underrepresentation in science and medicine worldwide, across educational, political and cultural communities. At NIH in 1998, Pinn briefed Sarah, Duchess of York, on medical research topics and major health messages regarding women. Information was shared on the Women's Health Initiative, obesity, breast cancer, and osteoporosis. In a keynote at the Penn-International Council of Women's Health Issues (ICOWHI) conference in Philadelphia in 2010, Pinn addressed the myriad health issues presented for women and children by global urbanization, as an increasing number of people worldwide move to live in city environments. She said as more people migrate to the world's cities, local governments are often outpaced to provide adequate systems for housing, sanitation, electricity, and water for citizens. Persistent health problems result. In 2011, Pinn led a group of NIH staffers in a meeting with actress Geena Davis to discuss how girls and women are perceived based on their roles in children's films, television shows, and video games. During the hour-long session, participants talked about strategies for balancing gender portrayals and how everyone's overall health might be improved as a result. On hand in November 2010 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the NIH Office of Research on Women's Health were (from l) former NIH director Dr. Bernadine Healy, U.S. Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-Maryland) and ORWH director Dr. Vivian Pinn Awards and honors Pinn received a Candace Award from the National Coalition of 100 Black Women in 1990. The Commonwealth Fund named Pinn the recipient of its 2000 Margaret E. Mahoney Award for Outstanding Service, citing Pinn's work to advance the quality of healthcare for women. The award was established in 1994 to honor \\"an individual whose contributions have fostered the field of health policy and health services and contributed to a better understanding of the complex issues involved.\\" In 2005, Pinn delivered the keynote address at the University of Virginia's 176th commencement exercises, becoming the first African-American female ever to do so. She recalled \\"the many challenges to my own sanity and passion for my medical studies during the sociopolitical era of the 1960s.\\" She told the nearly 5,000 graduates, accompanied by some 25,000 family members and guests, > I learned then, and have confirmed as years go by, that we can either dwell > in the smallness of slights or difficulties, or rejoice in the larger > meanings of life's experiences, and build a positive, constructive, and > worldly view of barriers we have faced, and the satisfaction of having > overcome them. Don't let difficulties make you small, a complaining > spectator of life‚Äîbut rather let a vision for your own life make you great, > a vital participant of life. In 2011, Tufts University School of Medicine honored Pinn for her commitment to the school and its students by dedicating the Office of Student Affairs, on the 4th floor of the Sackler Bldg., in her honor and by launching a scholarship fund in her name. Pinn was also awarded the Dean's Medal of Honor, TUSM's highest honor, from Dean Harris Berman. The medal, rarely conferred, is given to people whose service to the school and medical careers have enhanced TUSM's national standing. Pinn served as associate professor of pathology, as well as assistant dean for student affairs, in the 1970s and early 1980s. During her 12-year tenure at Tufts, she was a role model of mentorship. She also played a pivotal part in recruiting students of color and in expanding financial aid. In 2013, Pinn received the Foremother Award from the National Center for Health Research for her remarkable contributions to the lives of women in our country.

The newspaper commissioned architect Donn Barber, who had designed the nearby Travelers Tower and Connecticut State Library and Supreme Court Building, to build it a new structure to house its office and newspaper plant. At the time the paper was at the height of its influence with the top circulation in the state in 1917. Architecture Madison Square Presbyterian Church, whose pillars, cornices, pilasters, and windows were salvaged for use in the Hartford Times Building. The building is sited on a platform facing Burr Mall. Originally the facing mall was a street, Atheneum Square South, with the intention that the building be seen from that direction with the view flanked by the Beaux-Arts Municipal Building and Morgan Memorial addition to the Wadsworth Atheneum. The platform enables the roof line to match that of the flanking buildings and the inspiration for a columned end to an urban vista was drawn from famous Parisian examples such as La Madeleine, the Panth√©on, and the Palais Bourbon. The view of the building is currently blocked by trees in the eastern end of the mall. Madison Square Presbyterian Church When planning this structure Donn Barber, the architect, was aware of the imminent demolition of the Madison Square Presbyterian Church in Manhattan. That church, while built only twelve years before and acclaimed as one of Stanford White's finest works,Staff. \\"RAZE PARKHURST CHURCH.; Famous Piece of Architecture Making Way for Office Building.\\", The New York Times, May 6, 1919. Accessed November 16, 2010. was being displaced by an expansion of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. Barber salvaged not only the six green granite columns but also the pilasters, pulling them flush with the columns to transform the church's porch motif of five bays into a colonnade motif of seven bays. It proved necessary to replace the original Corinthian capitals with Ionic and to add a plinth to each column base to provide the desired height for the number of stories of the new building. The original steps, platforms and base courses are all fitted together as in the original church and the terra-cotta cornices were carefully adapted. The circular- headed windows from the 24th Street facade of the church serve as the doors of the Times Building. The openings in the arcade of the Times Building are also all repurposed windows or doors from the Church's portico and southern facade. The building's arcade is decorated with original murals by Connecticut artist Ralph Milne Calder, uncle to Alexander Calder whose Stegosaurus sculpture now sits in the facing mall. The Sgraffito murals are in a Renaissance style and allegorize Space, Time, Poetry, and Prose. They also illustrate the motto, \\"News is an immortal bubble (vagrant but outlasting those who make it,) and the press endures within.\\" History The Times occupied the facility until its demise in 1976 after which the building came under government ownership and was used as an annex to the adjacent Municipal Building. It was the backdrop for speeches by four presidents, Truman, Eisenhower, Johnson, and a crowd of 100,000 for the final speech of John F. Kennedy's election campaign. The building had been in disuse for more than a decade and was the subject of various redevelopment proposals, including as an expansion of the Wadsworth AtheneumMaker, Elizabeth, \\"Smithsonian Arts Director Takes Top Job at Wadsworth Museum\\", The New York Times, Connecticut and the Region section, February 24, 2008, p CT6 and as a home for the Thomas Hooker Brewing Company.

Given to the care of strangers after his birth, Jack grows up and is sent to a school at age 12. After being severely and unjustly punished by the schoolmaster, Jack runs away and comes across two thieves plotting a robbery. Jack hurries to the house and warns the mistress of the planned robbery. The robbery is foiled and the lady of the house is very grateful, but Jack's schoolmaster and his guardian arrive to take him back. She recognizes the guardian as the man who forced her to turn over Jack and turns them out of the house. The film's cast and production credits are unknown. The film was released on December 23, 1910, it was met with favorable reviews and saw a wide national release. In 1988, a severely deteriorated nitrate print of the film was known to exist and it was likely transferred to the Library of Congress archives in 1997.  Plot  The film is not lost, but a modern synopsis has not been published. The official synopsis of the film was published in The Moving Picture World on December 24, 1910. It states: \\"Jack Harkaway is of aristocratic birth, being the son of a wealthy Englishman's daughter and a poor young man, with whom she has eloped. Her parents bring about a separation and compel her to place the child in the hands of strangers, who are bribed to keep his whereabouts a secret from his mother. At the age of 12 Jack is placed in a school, the master of which is prejudiced against him, owing to the boy's mischievous disposition. After having received severe and unjust punishment from the schoolmaster, Jack decides to run away from school, and escapes from the room in which he is locked, through the window. Wandering along a country road, he accidentally overhears two sneak thieves planning to rob a house. Jack makes his way to the house in time to warn its mistress of the proposed robbery. Two [man] servants are placed in hiding, when the would-be thieves put in an appearance there and are immediately captured. Jack is given a fine supper by the lady of the house, who is very grateful to him. And when the schoolmaster, accompanied by Jack's guardian, arrives, she is touched by the boy's appeal not to be turned over to his rough-looking 'friends.' Upon getting a closer view of the man who calls himself the lad's guardian, she realizes that he is the man to whom she was forced to give over her child. The man admits that Jack is her own boy, and the picture ends with the men being turned out of the house and Jack restored to his mother's arms.\\"  Production  Lloyd Lonergan wrote the scenario based on S. Bracebridge Hemyng's Jack Harkaway story series. Film historian Q. David Bowers states that it was based on a stage play based upon a series of boys' stories, but does not cite a specific credit for which adaptation or work it was based on. Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though none are specifically credited. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters. Release and reception  The single reel drama, approximately 1,000 feet long, was released on December 23, 1910. The film had a wide national release, theaters which showed the film are noted in Indiana, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Arizona. Reviews of the film were mixed, with The Moving Picture World describing the film as a \\"heart story which will interest because it presents more or less unpleasant possibilities of this character. The acting is well done, and the film will prove popular with most audiences.\\" The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer found the film to be interesting, but stated that it \\"would have seemed more natural had [Jack Harkaway's mother] not recognized [Jack] as her son until the appearance of [his foster father], into whose care she had given her child. If two of the scenes had been broken it might have been more consistent. The men came up to plot their robbery too soon after Jack's hiding. They also appeared in the house immediately after the plan laid to capture them. They surely would have seen the light and would not have ventured so soon.\\" A surviving, but very deteriorated 35 mm nitrate print of the film was known to exist in 1988. It was described as being in various states of decomposition throughout the entire reel, including severe shrinkage and brittle or torn perforations. This print is 925 feet long and was held by John E. Allen, Inc. though it is not specifically known if it transferred to the Library of Congress in 1997.

Reception Edmund White in The New York Times was very positive, \\"Once in a while a book comes along that is beautifully put together and effortlessly entertaining; Muriel Spark's Territorial Rights is such a novel.

Vaitukaitis (August 29, 1940-October 19, 2018) was a reproductive neuroendocrinologist and clinical researcher who played a key role developing a biochemical assay in the early 1970s that ultimately led to the creation of the home pregnancy test. She served for 12 years as director of the US National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). Education and early development of home pregnancy test Judith Vaitukaitis, circa 1971, at the National Institutes of Health, where she helped to develop a sensitive test that ultimately led to creation of the home pregnancy test Vaitukaitis was born in Hartford, Connecticut, and received a B.S. degree in chemistry and biology from Tufts University in 1962. She earned her M.D. degree in 1966 from Boston University School of Medicine. She completed her residency at Cornell Medical Services, Bellevue Memorial Hospital, New York. In 1970, Vaitukaitis came to NIH as a postdoctoral researcher with the intention of studying human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a reproductive hormone that‚Äôs also secreted by certain malignant tumors. She worked first at NIH‚Äôs National Cancer Institute and then continued her postdoctoral training in the reproduction research branch of NIH‚Äôs Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), first as a special research fellow of the U.S. Public Health Service and then as a senior staff fellow. During that time, Vaitukaitis worked with another NIH postdoc, Glenn Braunstein, to find accurate techniques to detect elevated levels of hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) in the body, as a method for diagnosing cancer. Because hCG is normally secreted during pregnancy as well, the researchers recognized that a sensitive hCG assay might also be able to detect pregnancy at an early stage. In 1972, Vaitukaitis, Braunstein, and their mentor Griff Ross published a landmark paper that described a new assay for detecting hCG. Their method, far more sensitive than existing hCG tests, became the basis for the first home pregnancy tests, which hit the market in 1978. After advancing to become one of the first female senior investigators at NICHD, Vaitukaitis left NIH in 1974 and returned to Boston University School of Medicine. Clinical research and leadership roles At Boston University, Vaitukaitis served as professor of medicine, and at Boston City Hospital, she headed the section on endocrinology and metabolism. In addition to teaching, she conducted clinical research in reproductive endocrinology, and her basic research examined the mechanisms controlling hormonal action and metabolism at the cellular level. Her clinical studies were conducted in the NIH-funded General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) at Boston University; she served as co-director of that GCRC from 1975 to 1977, and director from 1977 to 1986. In 1986, Vaitukaitis returned to NIH as director of the General Clinical Research Centers (GCRC) program. At that time, the GCRC program was a nationwide network of more than 70 specialized centers in major teaching hospitals; each GCRC provided a well-equipped setting for physicians to conduct research on human health. Under her leadership, NCRR‚Äôs budget nearly quadrupled, and programs expanded to include a broad range of cutting-edge research resources, state-of-the-art technologies, and important biological models of human disease. With her guidance, NCRR helped to expand training and mentoring opportunities for physician-scientists and patient-oriented researchers and broadened the range of services and technologies provided by the GCRCs. Under her watch, NCRR also tripled funding for construction of research facilities; helped to create three National Gene Vector Laboratories; expanded support of advanced biomedical technologies; and established NIH‚Äôs Institutional Development Award (IDeA) Program, which broadened the geographic distribution of NIH funding for biomedical and behavioral research. In March 2005, Vaitukaitis became senior advisor on scientific infrastructure and resources to then-NIH Director Elias Zerhouni. She retired shortly thereafter.

History The Ohio Society of New York was founded by Civil War General Thomas Ewing, Jr., when he and several other prominent gentlemen of Ohio roots living in New York City met on November 10, 1885, and made the first entry into the society's first minute book. They met 10 days later, on November 20, 1885, and adopted a constitution. Initially a dining society, it later leased private rooms at the Waldorf Astoria (then located on Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street) until 1929, the Hotel Pennsylvania until 1962, and the Biltmore until 1977.

She is best known for her development of the vaccine against bacterial meningitis (Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib)) with her colleague John B. Robbins. Schneerson received the 1996 Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research and the Pasteur Award from the World Health Organization Children's Vaccine Initiative, both with her colleague Robbins. In 1998, she received a Citation Award from the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Schneerson retired from federal service in 2012.  Education and Early Career  Rachel Schneerson was born on April 25, 1932, in Warsaw, Poland. She earned her medical degree from Haddasah Medical School, The Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel, in 1958. Scheerson did a rotating internship at Tel-Hashomer Government Hospital, Tel-Aviv, Israel, followed by pediatrics residency at Hillel-Jaffe Government Hospital, Hadera, Israel. She then returned to Tel-Hashomer Government Hospital, in Tel-Aviv, for a pediatrics residency and a year as a senior resident in Internal Medicine and Cytogenetics. In 1966, Schneerson was board certified in pediatrics in Israel and became a senior pediatrician at Tel- Hashomer. In 1969, she came to the United States to be an instructor in the Department of Pediatrics and the Laboratory of Immunology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, where she met John B. Robbins. The two became an inseparable research team, ‚Äúdedicated to developing vaccines to protect children from bacterial diseases.‚Äù Schneerson and Robbins came to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) in 1970 after being recruited by the Institute‚Äôs then Scientific Director Charles Lowe. In 1974, the two went to the Division of Bacterial Products, where Robbins was named chief, at the Bureau of Biologics within the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Schneerson advanced from a visiting scientist to a senior staff fellow to a supervisory research medical officer during her time in the Division. Schneerson and Robbins returned to the NICHD in 1983 to head the Laboratory of Developmental and Molecular Immunity within the Division of Intramural Research. In 1998, Schneerson and Robbins were named heads of the Section on Bacterial Disease Pathogenesis and Immunity. The two continued leading the lab until their retirement in July 2012.  Notable Research  Rachel Schneerson is best known for her work on the vaccine for Haemophilus influenza type B, or Hib. Prior to the vaccine‚Äôs use, Hib infected 20,000 U.S. children younger than age 5 each year; 5% died of those, and one-third were left with intellectual disability, deafness, or seizures. It was the leading cause of acquired intellectual disability in the United States. Schneerson and Robbins believed that they could induce immunity by injecting a single antigen‚Äîthe polysaccharide (sugar) from the surface of the bacteria‚Äîinto children. Few others believed this process could work because the accepted belief at the time was that proteins, not sugars, were immunogens. Vaccine research at the time focused on using whole bacteria that had been killed, or of weakened bacteria, that could sometimes cause severe side effects. Studies in animals, adult humans, and children documented that injecting the polysaccharide alone could induce protective levels of antibodies to Hib. Using polysaccharides also eliminated many of the severe side effects of killed-bacteria vaccines. Scientists supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases did further vaccine testing. With the added involvement of industry, three Hib-purified polysaccharide vaccines were produced and licensed in 1985. But among infants, whose immune systems were immature, the level of protection was too low and the vaccine didn‚Äôt prevent Hib. In fact, many scientists believed that a polysaccharide-based vaccine would never work because immature defenses of the infant immune system were not savvy enough to detect the polysaccharide and make antibodies. Schneerson and Robbins tried a new process: They linked the weak polysaccharide to a protein carrier, one that was easily recognized by the immature immune system of infants, in an effort to boost its antigenicity. This novel process‚Äîcalled a ‚Äúconjugate‚Äù vaccine‚Äîworked. The conjugate vaccine for Hib produced high antibody levels, well above what was needed for protection, among infants from injections starting at age 2 months and persisting for years beyond. The vaccine was licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and became part of the standard immunization series for infants in 1987. In just a few years, Hib cases fell to fewer than 100 per year, a 99% drop. Most pediatricians trained since 1995 have never seen a Hib case. In countries where the vaccine is used, including the United States, Hib is no longer a cause of acquired intellectual disability. After the success of the Hib vaccine, Schneerson and Robbins continued their work on single antigens and conjugate vaccines. Their efforts led to the development and licensing of vaccines against pertussis (whooping cough), typhoid, Staphylococcus infections (pneumonia, aureus, and Group B), certain types of malaria, and anthrax. Additional information about their more recent research is available at http://2012annualreport.nichd.nih.gov/pdmi.html. Schneerson is named on dozens of patents and has authored and co-authored hundreds of peer-reviewed articles and several books. Schneerson retired from the federal government in July 2012.

He is also the founder of Sirina Entertainment, and the owner of Sirina TV, the first Greek TV channel featuring adult content, that broadcasts via OTE TV. Biography Sirinakis was born in Palaio Faliro, Athens on 18 October 1974. He served his military service as a member of the Special Forces. In 2000, he founded Sirina Entertainment, the first Greek erotic film production company with an international appeal. Career and Sirina Entertainment With the completion of his military service, Dimitris Sirinakis studied business management in Washington University and upon its graduation, he worked for a multinational company. In 2000, he began his career in the sensual films industry, as an exclusive distributor of international erotic films in Greece (e.g. Hustler, Marc Dorcel, etc.) In 2007 he started directing and producing his own erotic films, where one may enjoy the performance of Greek models. Dimitris Sirinakis is said to be the only professional erotic film producer in Greece, while Sirina Entertainment productions have met with great success in the Greek market. In 2010, his infamous cooperation with actress/model Julia Alexandratou and the release of her sex DVD ‚ÄúBanned‚Äù, marked a peak time in Sirina Entertainment producer's career. The tumult brought by the release of the DVD surpassed Greek borders, while top media channels reported extensively on the subject. The aftereffects of the release of Julia Alexandratou's sex tape were quite impressive, as foreign media even talked about an effort of manipulating public opinion, due to the fact that the release occurred at the same time as the IMF bailout program for Greece. Meanwhile, numerous Greek TV shows and features dealt with the issue for months. Although initially, Julia Alexandratou argued that the DVD content was about personal footage that was leaked by one of her exes, after 13 days Julia Alexandratou finally admitted the whole truth in Tatiana Stefanidou's a TV show. She confessed that everything was legally agreed between both parties; she signed a contract with the production company that was submitted to the revenue office, she was properly paid and the relevant invoice was issued. In any case, the success of the Julia Alexandratou film was used as an excuse for questioning Greek showbiz taboos, regarding sensual productions. Soon after that, more big names, such as Marianna Douvli, Voula Vavatsi, and Christina Rousaki, followed Julia's lead. The scandalous style, which is typical in Dimitrinis Sirinakis productions, involves the participation of renown showbiz names and the use of fairly provocative sets, as well as his ability of taking advantage of publicity. All the above contributed equally to the promotion of Sirina Entertainment in Greece and abroad. Company Expansion In 2007, Sirina Entertainment was involved with print media, publishing the newspaper Sirina news and the monthly magazine Sirina. Sirina News Sirina News was the first-ever politics-gossip newspaper available in stands that offered two DVDs as freebies: an erotic film, produced by Sirina Entertainment, and an action movie. Sirina TV HD Since October 2013, Dimitris Sirinakis is the owner of the first Greek erotic TV Channel Sirina, which is included in the ‚ÄúAdult Pack‚Äù of OTE TV. Web (sirina.tv) The webpage sirina.tv is the official website of the company.

The technique combines both diffusion and field charging regimes to cover the diameter range 10 nm to 10 Œºm. Subsequent developments of the technique enable measurements faster than 1 Hz, although in each case with a reduced size range. Aerosol charging High charging efficiency allows sufficient charge to be placed on individual particles that the use of electrometer detectors is practicable, while the use of parallel electrometer detectors allows real time measurement of the size/number spectrum with output data as fast as 0.25 Hz. Unlike SMPS-type devices, multiple charging is an inherent issue across almost the entire size range of EAS-type devices. Accurate characterization of the electrical charging of the aerosol is therefore an essential component of device design. Calibration Techniques for the traceable calibration of such devices are established, and result in good agreement (subject to suitable signal levels) with slower but more sensitive scanning mobility particle sizers. Applications Applications include the measurement of engine exhaust, cigarette smoke, and ambient/atmospheric studies. The technique is particularly appropriate for situations where aerosol concentrations are changing on a timescale of 1 s or faster.

In a career which ran from November 2010 to February 2019 he ran in eighteen races, winning nine times. In March 2015, he became the first novice chaser to win the Cheltenham Gold Cup for more than forty years. His subsequent career was hampered by injury and he did not run again in the Cheltenham Gold Cup after winning it. Background Coneygree is a bay horse bred in the United Kingdom by John Oaksey, a leading amateur jockey who later became a successful broadcaster and charity fundraiser before his death in 2012. Coneygree was from the final crop of foals sired by Karinga Bay, a son of Ardross, who won the Gordon Stakes and finished fifth in the 1990 Epsom Derby. Coneygree's dam Plaid Maid won five races and later became a successful broodmare, producing Hennessy Gold Cup winner Carruthers. Sara Bradstock described Plaid Maid as a \\"tiny little mare that we bought for nothing, who people thought was a joke\\". Throughout his racing career, Coneygree has been trained at Letcombe Bassett in Oxfordshire by Mark Bradstock, the husband of John Oaksey's daughter Sara. He was ridden in all of his early races by Mattie Batchelor. Racing career 2011/2012 National Hunt season: National Hunt Flat races Coneygree made his racecourse debut on 24 November 2011 when he won a National Hunt Flat race at Uttoxeter Racecourse, taking the lead three furlongs from the finish and beating Dannanceys Hill by three and three quarter lengths at odds of 10/1. On his only other appearance, he finished eighth behind Shutthefrontdoor at Newbury Racecourse in February after weakening in the last quarter mile. 2012/2013 National Hunt season: Novice hurdles In the 2012/2013 National Hunt season, Coneygree competed in novice hurdle races. On his first appearance over obstacles at Uttoxeter in November, he led from the start and won by twenty lengths from Corrin Wood. Later that month, he was moved up in class to contest the Grade 2 Hyde Novices' Hurdle over two miles and five furlongs at Cheltenham Racecourse and made all the running to win by seven lengths and five lengths from Bondage and According to Trev. In December, Coneygree started 11/10 favourite for the Grade 2 Bristol Novices Hurdle over three miles at Cheltenham. He again led from the start, was never seriously challenged, and won by six lengths from the Paul Nicholls-trained Aerial, with Grand National winner Mon Mome in sixth. In January 2013, Coneygree started at odds of 9/4 for the Classic Novices' Hurdle over two and a half miles at Cheltenham and finished third behind At Fishers Cross and The New One. At the Cheltenham Festival in March At Fishers Cross and The New One won the Spa Novices' Hurdle and the Baring Bingham Novices' Hurdle, respectively. 2014/2015 National Hunt season: Novice Chase  In 2013, Coneygree sustained a pelvic injury and missed the whole of the next season. When Bradstock entered him in a race at Plumpton Racecourse in early November, the horse was refused permission to race after being declared lame by the racecourse vet, who reportedly said, \\"He's had two years off. He's not worth anything.\\" Bradstock responded by saying, \\"It's not any old horse that you are fucking about with!\\" Coneygree reappeared on 28 November 2014 when he contested the Grade 2 Berkshire Novices' Chase over two and a half miles at Newbury. Ridden for the first time by Nico de Boinville, he led from the start and won by one and a half lengths from Dell' Arca, with the pair finishing forty-five lengths clear of Horatio Hornblower. His task may have been made easier when the favoured Saphir de Rheu unseated his rider at the seventh fence. In December, the gelding started second favourite behind Saphir de Rheu in the Grade 1 Kauto Star Novices' Chase at Kempton Park Racecourse, with his other opponents including the Worcester Novices' Chase winner Carraig Mor and the December Novices' Chase winner Virak. Among the leaders from the start, Coneygree was left with a commanding advantage in the second half of the race as Saphir de Rheu fell at the seventh and Carraig Mor unseated his rider a fence late, and won by forty lengths from Warden Hill. On 7 February, Coneygree was matched against more experienced chasers for the first time in the Denman Chase over three miles at Newbury. Ridden by Richard Johnson, he carried 159 pound and started the 15/8 favourite ahead of Houblon des Obeaux (United House Gold Cup), Taquin du Seuil (JLT Novices' Chase), Unioniste (2012 December Gold Cup), Double Ross (2013 December Gold Cup) and Harry Topper (Charlie Hall Chase). Coneygree took the lead from the start and looked to be in control of the race from the second last, winning by seven length from Houblon des Obeaux with a further three and a half length back to Unioniste in third. The official BHA handicapper Phil Smith rated his performance the best by a novice in Britain for fifteen years. In the build-up to the 2015 Cheltenham Festival, Coneygree's connections wavered between running the gelding against his fellow novices in the RSA Chase and taking on more experienced opposition in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. They chose the latter, and on 13 March 2015, Coneygree, on his fourth start over fences, attempted to become the first novice chaser since the Irish champion Captain Christy in 1974 to win the Gold Cup. The dual King George VI Chase winner Silviniaco Conti started the 3/1 favourite in a sixteen-runner field with Coneygree starting the 7/1 second choice alongside the Hennessy Gold Cup winner Many Clouds. The Lexus Chase winner Road To Riches and the Mildmay Novices' Chase winner Holywell started on 8/1 whilst the Willie Mullins trained six-year-old Djakadam was next in the betting at 10/1. The other contenders included Bobs Worth and Lord Windermere (winners of the race in 2013 and 2014 respectively), the Irish Gold Cup winner Carlingford Lough as well as On His Own and The Giant Bolster, who had finished second and third to Lord Windermere in the previous year's race. De Boinville sent the novice into the lead from the start, with On His Own being his closest pursuer for most of the race. When On His Own began to fade at the third last, Djakadam and Road To Riches emerged as Coneygree's only serious challengers. Coneygree jumped the last in front and tracked to the right as Djakadam and Road To Riches continued to battle for second place on the inside. Coneygree crossed the line a length and a half ahead of Djakadam, with Road To Riches two lengths back in third and Holywell six lengths away in fourth.{{cn} 2015/2016 National Hunt season: Steeplechases Coneygree made a winning reappearance in the listed event Future Stars Chase Intermediate on 8 November, the main race of Sandown Park first Jump meeting of the season. The race was designed for last season's novices who had not won a Chase race prior to 27 April of last year, Nico de Boinville ‚Äì Coneygree's regular rider ‚Äì explaining: \\"There's a loophole there and we're making full use of it. There's no point giving him a harder prep- race than he needs.\\" Only 3 runners started in the race with Southfield Theatre having his first run since finishing second in the 2015 Grade 1 RSA Chase. Coneygree took the lead and without being challenged finished 25 lengths ahead of his nearest rival. Trainer Mark Bradstock was pleased with the run and confirmed the next target for the Hennessy under top-weight. Injury would prevent Coneygree from appearing again that season. 2016/2017 National Hunt season: Steeplechases Coneygree finished 2nd to Cue Card by 15 lengths in the Betfair Chase on 19 November.http://www.skysports.ie/racing/results/full-result/752822/haydock- park/19-11-2016/betfair-chase After a five-month lay off due to an injury, which resulted in him missing the Cheltenham festival, Coneygree made his second and final appearance of the season at Punchestown. It was a six-runner field for the Coral Punchestown Gold Cup and he was up against Sizing John and Djakadam. Coneygree led from the start and eventually finished a close third. 2017/2018 National Hunt season: Steeplechases On his first start of the season, Coneygree was sent off the 7/4 favourite for the Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby on 4 November. After making a couple of bad jumping errors, he was eventually pulled up and the race was won by Bristol De Mai. He was soon back on a racecourse as he contested the Ladbrokes Trophy Chase (formerly known as The Hennessy Chase) on 2 December in which he was sent off at 8/1. Coneygree led for the first circuit but soon faded after that and was again pulled up. The race was won by the favourite Total Recall trained by the Willie Mullins. The next intended race for Coneygree was the Cotswold Chase at Cheltenham in January but he was withdrawn from the race due to the very heavy ground. The Denman Chase at Newbury in February was his next scheduled appearance but again he was withdrawn, this time due to injury. His connections announced that he would not run again that season. 2018/2019 National Hunt season: Steeplechases After an absence of nearly twelve months, Coneygree made his latest comeback at Cheltenham and was sent off at 12/1 for the Bet.Victor.com Handicap Chase over 3 miles and 3 furlongs in November. Sean Bowen got the mount and was riding him for the first time. Rock the Kasbah won the race and Coneygree was 6 lengths back in third. His next outing was in the King George VI Chase on Boxing day. It was Coneygree's first appearance at Kempton in four years and his first attempt in this race. In what was a very good line-up of runners, Coneygree was sent off as one of the outsiders at 20/1. As to be expected. he led the field all the way until the 14th when he very quickly began to weaken and was a very tired horse when he unshipped Sean Bowen two fences from home. Clan Des Obeaux was the victor trained by Paul Nicholls returning at 12/1. Up next for Coneygree was a first ever visit to Ascot in February for the Keltbray Swinley Chase over just short of three miles. Nico De Boinville his regular jockey was back on board and Coneygree quickly went to the front and led all the way until the 15th. As in his previous race, he weakened very quickly and De Boinville pulled him up four fences from home. This proved to be his very final race as his owners promptly retired him immediately after the horse returned unscathed.

Thousands of shops and stalls service the visitors which contribute to the beauty of this festival along with the jhankis (displays) and a fireworks competition which is a key feature to the event. Cart Festival in Sisua Village Pana Sankranti (Oriya: ‡¨™‡¨£‡¨æ ‡¨∏‡¨Ç‡¨ï‡≠ç‡¨∞‡¨æ‡¨®‡≠ç‡¨§‡¨ø), or Maha Vishuva Sankranti is celebrated as the Odia New Year. The day marks the beginning of the New Year in the traditional Hindu Solar Calendar. The occasion is observed with sharing of the traditional drink of Pana. Since the festival is observed during summer, this beverage forms the most important part of the festivities. Pana is prepared by mixing different types of fruits, water, milk, pulp of bael (custard apple), curd and sugar. Amba Pana that includes mango pulp, is offered to Lord Jagannath to convey New Year wishes, while many offer the beverage to Lord Shiva by adding a bit of bhang (cannabis). Further festivals celebrated in this village are Manabasa Gurubara, Raja, Dasahara, Holi, Diwali and Dola festival. Manabasa Gurubara is the biggest festival celebrated in this village because the religion of the locals is Hindu. Manabasa Gurubara is celebrated for the goddess of Laxmi, the deity of wealth and prosperity. This festival is celebrated each Thursday in the month of Margasira, which is four times during the month. Women clean their houses and make jhoti chita from rice paste. It is believed that Laxmi visits each home on these days and gives blessings. There is a story about this festival in Laxmi Puran. Raja (festival), is another popular festival in this village, being for girls only. During this festival, girls wear new dresses, their best jewellery, eat all types of pitha, visit their friends, relatives and for two days of the festival the girls will not consume salt nor bathe. At this time large swings are hung from the banyan trees and the girls are encouraged to swing on them. All people abstain from walking barefoot on the earth and no work in the fields is allowed. The women do not grind, will not tear anything apart, will not cut anything and are relieved from cooking. This is also the time they expect to catch the eye of a young man and sing of how they will produce many healthy babies as this festival is linked to fertility, Mother Earth and the monsoon season. Dola festival is also celebrated by villagers on the day of Holi, and is similar to the better-known festival. An image, made specifically for this day, of Lord Krishna is taken to everyone's home on a wooden cart and is traditionally sprinkled with abira/phalgu (this is a red/violet powder made from the root of a species of curcuma and sapan wood). The villagers also play with abira themselves and on the day of Holi a similar coloured powder (traditionally made from dry leaves and sand) is scattered and smeared on each other's faces, along with the squirting of rose water at passers by. Typically both types of powder have been a similar colour (including the rose water), in modern times however powders of many colours (known simply as \\"colour\\") are used for this festival leading it to be also known as the Festival of Colours. There has been some concern about locally produced \\"colour\\" due to the lead content. Therefore, colour using more natural, less harmful dye elements are being called for. It is believed on this day Lord Krishna offers the first crop of mangoes from the trees for the almost year long devotion of his followers and their offerings to him. Sports There is a cricket ground in the village where children can play cricket and other types of games, such as marbles, Kabaddi, and Gilli-danda. The people of Sisua also organize cricket tournaments every year to promote the sport and for both players and spectators to enjoy.

The manor was designed by architect Anthony Salvin for Henry Preston, the Sheriff of Yorkshire, in 1828. History Moreby Hall and its park lies on previously populated village called Moreby or Moorby, the Scandinavian word for \\"farmstead on the marsh.\\" Moreby Hall, 1907 A 1907 profile on Moreby Hall in Country Life magazine states that, \\"The township anciently contained two carucates of land held of the King in capite by knight's service and a sixpenny rent severally. Now we read the quaint record that Moreby is held of the Crown by the service of rendering a red rose when the Sheriff may demand it.\\" A family at this time took its name from the village; a knight, Sir Robert de Moreby, appears on the records (d. 1335). His ancestor, also Sir Robert de Moreby, had a daughter who married Sir William Acclom (or Acklam) in the 15th century. The Accloms then took up residence at the original Moreby Hall. Stillingfleet's church, St Helen's, includes a memorial to John Acclom of Moreby (d. 1611), and of his wife, Isabel. The church has a section called Moreby Chapel, the burial site for the de Moreby family, dating to the era of Edward III. The house was next owned by the Lawson family. Reverend George Lawson, was succeeded in turn by his son, also George Lawson, who in 1636 married the daughter of Marmaduke Boswell. Their son, Marmaduke Lawson, had two sons, but no grandchildren. Marmaduke's wife, Susannah, was the daughter of John Preston, the Mayor of Leeds in 1692. The estate then passed to Susannah's nephew, Thomas Preston, who in turned passed it to his nephew, Henry Preston (1779-1857). Current hall Moreby Hall garden, 1907 In 1814, Henry Preston married Maria, the eldest daughter of Joshua Compton of Esholt Hall in Yorkshire. Preston, the High Sheriff of Yorkshire, commissioned architect Anthony Salvin to build a new manor in 1828. The cost of the construction, completed in 1832, was ¬£40,000 (). Moreby Hall was Salvin's second major country house in the Tudor style, which Pevsner notes is \\"highly accomplished work for one not yet thirty.\\" Moreby was constructed of sandstone ashlar with a roof of Welsh slate. The interior of the house features a dining room with a coffered ceiling and a Jacobethan marble fireplace. Chinese bird wallpaper, , still hangs on the walls of the drawing room. In his 1872 book, A History of the Gothic Revival, Sir Charles Eastlake called Moreby Hall an early example of ‚Äúa gradual return to the manorial Gothic of old English mansions.‚Äù The terraced gardens slope down towards the River Ouse. Moreby Hall was listed Grade II* in 1966. Ownership The Preston family still owned Moreby Hall until the 20th century. Moreby Hall sits on 12.3 acres (4.97 ha) of land. It was put on the market for ¬£2.8 million in 2014.

It was discovered in 1985. The tomb is named after the blue and black-skinned demons which appear in an underworld scene on the right wall. The tomb has been dated to the end of the fifth century BC.  Description  The fresco on the left wall shows the male deceased riding a biga, a two horse chariot. He is accompanied by musicians in a procession moving rightwards. The fresco on the right wall shows the female deceased. On the far left of the scene is a boat steered by Charon (known as Charun by the Etruscans), the Greek ferryman of the dead. A ribbon hangs on the prow of the boat. A woman holding a branch stands on the shore. She has one hand placed on the head of a young boy in front of her. They face and greet another woman towards their right, flanked by two demons. One demon appears to lead her towards the woman and the boy, but the other holds her around her waist, trying to stop her. On the far right of the scene, two larger demons are shown. The blue demon is on the left, seated on a rock with two snakes in his hands. He faces the black demon on the right, who approaches with exposed teeth, claws and intimidating eyes. The rear wall shows a symposium scene with four or five couples reclining on benches.  Interpretation  Left wall Right wall A \\"blue demon\\" The fresco in the right wall is notable for its theme of a dangerous journey to the underworld with threatening demons. This contrasts with the cheerful dancing and symposium scenes in painted tombs of the Etruscan Archaic and Early Classical periods. The Tomb of the Blue Demons provided evidence that Etruscan death demons already existed at the end of the fifth century BC. The fresco of the procession on the left wall signifies the journey to the afterlife. Likewise, the fresco on the right wall has also been interpreted as the journey of a deceased woman to the underworld, where she meets predeceased family members. It depicts an antechamber to the underworld in which demons guide the deceased woman to the ship for her journey. She walks from the rock or cliff on the right, which is the border with the world of the living, towards the boat, which is the boundary with the underworld. It is also possible for the inhabitants of the underworld to enter from the other side, like the women with the boy. The ship of the Etruscan Charun is seaworthy, unlike the skiff of his Greek counterpart. The banquet on the rear wall depicts both the festivities of the living for the funeral and of the deceased in the afterlife. Like many other elements of Etruscan religion, the demons shown on the right wall were probably inspired by the ancient Greek religion. The black-skinned demon bears some similarity to depictions of Thanatos and the blue-skinned demon resembles Eurynomos.

The embassy opened in central Nairobi on 2 March 1964, when the United States established diplomatic relations with Kenya. In 1998, the original embassy was the target of a terrorist attack, after which a new embassy building was constructed in Gigiri, a suburb of Nairobi, in 2003. History Aftermath of the 1998 bombing. Original embassy The United States recognized Kenya upon its independence on 12 December 1963. The US formally established diplomatic relations with Kenya on 2 March 1964. The US embassy in Nairobi was established the same day. The original embassy () was located on the western corner of Moi Avenue and Haile Selassie Avenue in central Nairobi. =1998 bombing= On the morning of August 7, 1998, a truck loaded with explosives detonated in a parking lot between the embassy and two commercial, high-rise buildings (both of which contained some offices for US diplomatic staff). The attack killed 213 people and injured approximately 4000. Only 12 of the dead were Americans; most were Kenyans killed when the Ufundi House‚Äîa seven-storey office building adjacent to the embassy‚Äîcollapsed. A simultaneous attack occurred at the US Embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The attacks were attributed to al-Qaeda. In 1999, the federal government convened a group of experts to examine the security of US diplomatic posts worldwide. The group later released a report, stating that the security of US diplomatic posts (collectively, the US's \\"overseas presence\\") were \\"unacceptable\\" and that the US overseas presence was \\"perilously close to the point of system failure.\\" The 1998 embassy bombings and the September 11 terrorist attacks three years later prompted the US State Department to start a multibillion-dollar building and renovation program to make US embassies around the world safer. The original embassy grounds were donated to a charitable trust, which turned the property into the August 7th Memorial Park and maintains the grounds. The August 7th Memorial Park contains a garden, a sculpture made of debris from the attack, a wall engraved with the names of victims, and a visitor's center (built on the site of the Ufundi House). New embassy In 2003, the US opened a new embassy in the suburb of Gigiri, across from the Office of the United Nations in Nairobi. The new embassy building was inaugurated on March 3, 2003 and has 402,100 square feet (37,350 m¬≤) of floor space. Several threats shortly after its opening caused some closures in mid-2003 and in 2014, some staff from the embassy were relocated due to a possible security threat. Mission The embassy is home to the US diplomatic mission to Kenya‚Äîdiplomats and personnel representing United States interests in the host country, led by the United States Ambassador to Kenya. The US diplomatic mission to Kenya is working with the Kenyan government to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, promote and strengthen Kenyan institutes of democracy, and promote business between the US and Kenya; besides diplomatic activities, the embassy also provides consular services, such as issuing visas, passports (for US citizens), and providing assistance to US citizens in distress. From 2015 to 2018, it was also the base for the US diplomatic mission to Somalia, due to the security situation in Somalia.

Epaye advocates for better governance, economic development, and civil society freedoms, defends respect for human rights, and promotes national reconciliation. In 2015, she won the U.S. State Department's International Women of Courage Award. Biography Emilie B√©atrice Epaye was born about 1956 and trained to be a teacher. She has operated a family-run transportation business and engaged in trade. La Fondation la Voix du coeur La Fondation la Voix du coeur (The Voice of the Heart Foundation) was established in 1994 by Lucienne Patass√©, wife of then president Ange-F√©lix Patass√©, to mentor street children. The home she created, located in Bangui, was originally a haven from violence or abandonment where children are fed, educated, given medical care and provided with training and safe haven. Upon Lucienne Patass√©'s death in 2000, Epaye took over directorship of the organization. Political career In 2003 General Fran√ßois Boziz√© led a coup against the former leader Patass√© of the Central African Republic and took over the government. He established a broad- based transitional council including most of the opposition parties, and charged them with drafting the 2004 constitution. Epaye was appointed as President of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the National Assembly and as a member of the National Transitional Council from 2003 to 2005. In 2005 she began serving as the Minister of Commerce, Industry and Small and Medium Enterprises and held the position for five years. In 2008 she became the Minister of Trade and Industry and held that position through 2011. In 2013 a coalition of armed groups calling themselves the S√©l√©ka (Alliance in the Sango language) overthrew Boziz√©'s government. Michel Djotodia declared himself president and plunged the country into a crisis. Djotodia's Muslim leadership in the largely Christian country resulted in the formation of militias, sectarian violence, and finally an agreement by Djotodia to step down. The UN Security Council, African Union and French government sent troops to assist in stabilizing the area and a new Transitional Council was appointed. Epaye again was tapped to serve in the transitional government and Catherine Samba-Panza was elected to lead the country during the transition. The next democratic elections will be held end of 2015.

A fugitive from justice, Ned Keegles (Lytell) goes out west, determined on revenge. When he meets Sheila Langford (Nilsson), he forces her to marry him, and believes his revenge is complete. When he hears that Langford is Sheila's stepfather, he is sorry. He tells Sheila so and begs for her forgiveness, but his enemies have darkened his character and she is slow to forgive. The attempted murder of Ned's best friend forces him to talk. Sheila comes to understand the true state of affairs and becomes satisfied with her marriage and the forced ceremony.

She completed her medical education at Cornell University and the University of Pennsylvania, receiving her M.D. degree from University of Pennsylvania in 1969. After an internship at Georgetown University she joined NCI as a resident in anatomic pathology, and has been a senior investigator since 1974, focusing on the classification and definition of lymphomas. Jaffe's early work helped to provide a deeper understanding of the origin of lymphomas, especially follicular lymphoma. Her team notably elucidated the difference between T cell and B cell lymphomas. Her lab's findings led to the development of the WHO Classification of Tumours of the Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues. Jaffe was the President of the Society of Hematopathology at the time that the WHO's Revised European- American Classification of Lymphoid Neoplasms (REAL) classification system was developed in 1994; the REAL classification system is now considered the gold standard in hematopathology. Today, her research includes genetic and epigenetic studies aimed at understanding how B-cells become Hodgkin's lymphoma cells, particularly through the lens of the microenvironment. Jaffe's research has led to improvements in cancer treatments, including disease- specific therapies and improved clinical outcomes. Early life and career development Jaffe is the daughter of Ukrainian immigrants who fled Russia during World World I. As a child in White Plains, New York, Jaffe was drawn to the sciences, particularly astronomy and geology. In an interview she states, \\"I fell in love with biology and decided in high school that I was going to become a doctor.\\" She received her undergraduate degree from Cornell University, and completed her medical education at the University of Pennsylvania in the late 1960s, where she was one of only five women in a class of more than 100 medical students. In her second year of medical school, she met and married her husband Michael Evan Jaffe, then a law student. Jaffe and her husband have two sons, Greg‚Äîan award-winning journalist at The Washington Post, formerly a reporter at the Wall Street Journal‚Äîand Caleb‚Äîa law professor at the University of Virginia Law School, formerly the director of the Virginia office of the Southern Environmental Law Center in Charlottesville, Virginia. Jaffe, her husband and first child moved to the Washington, D.C. area, where the Jaffe's second son was born. Jaffe took a residency position at Georgetown University and worked primarily in anatomic pathology. After a year at Georgetown, Jaffe entered an NCI residency program. Jaffe's early research at NCI helped replace purely descriptive classifications with those based on immunology which helped in the development process leading to today's disease-specific therapies. Jaffe and her fellow NCI researchers showed that red blood cells coated with antibody and erythrocyte-antibody-complement (EAC) adhered to B-cell areas, proving they were lymphocytes derived from the lymphoid follicles. Honors and awards Jaffe has served on the editorial boards of the American Journal of Pathology, the American Journal of Surgical Pathology, Blood, Cancer Research, and Modern Pathology. She has also served as president of the Society for Hematopathology and the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology (USCAP) (from 1998 to 1999). In 1993, Jaffe was elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). In 2005 she was chair of the Medical Sciences Section of AAAS and in 2007 she was the second Anita Roberts Lecturer at the NIH. Jaffe is considered one of the most-cited researchers in clinical medicine by Science Watch and was among the top 10 in oncology between 1981 and 1998. She is an elected member of the Institute of Medicine.
