The programme was aired on BBC One on Saturday evenings and was first transmitted on 23 April 2011. This series had been planned to run for nine episodes but it was taken off air after six episodes because of poor ratings. The remaining three episodes were rescheduled for broadcast in October 2011. In the show, contestants must compete in a series of challenges to win ¬£15,000 of prize money; failure to complete questions and physical challenges risks \\"scaring\\" a giant robotic hare. The programme has been described by its host as \\"fantasy based toddler telly with an adult twist\\". It was the first series to be made at dock10, MediaCityUK in Salford. Background The show was piloted at BBC Television Centre in September 2009, with Jason Bradbury as host and Barry Davies providing a live voiceover. The format underwent further development. In November 2010, the Manchester Evening News reported that television production company Endemol was producing a new game show for Saturday evenings at the area's new dock10 studios. In December, The Guardian reported that a giant robotic hare had been seen at the complex in Salford. Jason Bradbury was named as host in January 2011, while some newspapers identified comedian Miranda Hart as the show's narrator. However, the role went to Sue Perkins. Announcing Don't Scare the Hare, BBC Entertainment's executive editor Alan Tyler said the show \\"cleverly captures the spirit and fun of interactive family video games that has been sweeping the nation. [...] We're excited about bringing this experimental new format to early Saturday evenings on BBC One\\", while Nick Mather, head of entertainment at Endemol called the show \\"an innovative new format and said he was \\"highly excited to be making this large scale studio show for BBC One.\\" Overview The programme was presented by Jason Bradbury, who explained to the viewers that he lives in an underground forest with his \\"mate\\" the Hare (a giant robotic Hare on wheels). He invited the contestants to \\"do a whole bunch of crazy stuff\\" (play a few games), but there was one important rule: They must not scare the Hare. The main part of the show involved two teams of contestants playing three rounds against each other, each round involving a physical challenge. Sometimes these tasks involved a puzzle or memory element which one member of each team must complete. For example, in the first episode the games involved hopping around in sleeping bags to stop alarm clocks from going off, remembering a sequence of lights and using them to \\"cross\\" a pond of lilypads, and hooking carrots with fishing rods. A wrong move on any of the tasks would set off a loud noise, \\"scaring\\" the Hare, which ran around the studio squeaking and rolling its eyes. Three of these forfeits would lose the contestant that particular round. Noises include ringing alarm clocks and croaking frogs. These games are narrated by Sue Perkins, who is styled as \\"The Voice of the Forest\\". Points were awarded in the form of giant plastic carrots. Completing each of the first two rounds would earn the team three carrots, while the third round was a head-to-head where several points were on offer. Generally this involved a member of each team collecting up to 18 carrots from the Hare's allotment. The winning team went through to the final round, where they had a chance to play for ¬£15,000. This involved the team members answering a series of multiple choice questions, with each contestant in charge of a plunger which corresponded to an A, B, or C answer. They had to answer three questions correctly, each correct answer allowing the Hare to advance along a course which would eventually trap him. The first correct answer let the Hare into the garden by opening a gate, the second raised a net and the third trapped the Hare, winning the team ¬£15,000. Incorrect answers detonated dynamite; three explosions meant that the team walked away with nothing. Games *Alarm-a-geddon: One player from each team had to turn off alarm clocks, which turned themselves on, until the sun rises. If three alarm clocks went off, the Hare was scared and the team won nothing. If the sun rose before Hare was scared, the team won three carrots. *Allotment Impossible: One player was suspended above Hare's allotment in a harness and had to then collect up to 18 carrots from \\"electrified\\" boxes using prongs. Touching the sides of the box forfeited the carrots which had to be returned to Hare's bin. Extracted carrots could be placed in a team's basket. *Bangers and Smash: A member of each team had to throw apples at a series of fireworks, toppling them before the fuse burns down. If they failed to dislodge the firework before the fuse expires, it exploded frightening the Hare. *Cash and Carrots: In this final round, qualified teams had to answer three general knowledge questions correctly. The first correct answer let Hare into the garden by opening a gate. The second raised a net and the third trapped Hare, winning the team ¬£15,000. Incorrect answers detonated dynamite - three incorrect mean that teams walked away with nothing. *Hot Hare Balloons: In this final qualifying round, up to 18 carrots were available. One player sat in a chair suspended by balloons above the Hare's allotment. The player had to take the carrots from the allotment using long hooks, whilst avoiding motion sensitive lasers, putting it in the bin next to their chair. If the lasers were activated, an alarm went off, and the carrots had to be forfeited to Hare's bin. *Party Poppers: It was Hare's birthday, and his party was missing balloons. One contestant from each team had to maneuver a balloon through a thorn bush without popping it and deliver it to Hare's party. One balloon safe was enough to win three carrots. However, popping all (three) balloons in the thorn bush meant the game was lost. *Pond Memories: One player from each team had to memorise a sequence of lily pads, which lit up. If they made a mistake, a frog chorus went off, scaring Hare. If the contestant got across all the lily pads without scaring Hare three times, they won three carrots. *Running Yolk: One player from each team had to transport three eggs across a farm yard obstacle course, first from the chicken coop, through a gate and over some rollers, over a hay bale, over spinning stepping stones and onto egg cups before the bread in a toaster rose. Each new egg was larger in size than the last. Each broken egg scared Hare once - three scares and no carrots. Three eggs and the team won three carrots. *Vase Attacks: One player from each team had to transport three paintings to hooks on the other side of the room before the time ran out. Each painting was larger than the last. However, in between them and the hooks were fragile vases. Each vase broken scared Hare once - three scares and the player got nothing. Three carrots could be won if all three paintings were hung without scaring Hare or running out of time. *': In this final qualifying round, one player from each team had to attempt to take up to 18 carrots from Hare's allotment by taking them from electrified wires. If the ring attached to the carrots hit the wire, the carrots must be forfeited to Hare's bin. Carrots that were won could be deposited in a team's basket. Reception The first episode received overnight ratings of 1.93 million viewers, a 15% audience share. Although hot weather was given as a possible reason for the low ratings, it was reported that many viewers were unimpressed with the show, assuming it was a one-off to tie in with Easter (since the tagline used to promote the show was \\"this year, the Easter bunny has competition\\"), and were surprised to learn that more episodes were scheduled to be broadcast. Justin Mason, critic for ATV, said, \\"I don't think I've quite seen anything like Don't Scare the Hare. I was wondering who on earth dreamt up the idea... it looked like a cheap, children's quiz-show that would be better placed on CBeebies than prime-time BBC One.\\" Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror was equally as critical, summing up his review as follows: \\"The idiots playing might have enjoyed themselves but even toddlers would have found the games dull and Jason creepy.\\" A review in The Stage observed: \\"The actual games are pretty feeble and uninspired, leaving the poor hare and his robotic novelty value to carry the show. Unfortunately, the hare is far from impressive either. Doctor Who's tin dog K9 managed more personality and manoeuvrability, and he was operating within the confines of seventies technology.\\" John Anson of the Lancashire Evening Post opined: \\"If you‚Äôre going to have a gimmick in your game show at least make it entertaining. Surely this is a programme which would have been ideal for CBeebies. Make the questions simple, involve bunches of kids and hey, presto it works... But primetime Saturday night viewing it ain‚Äôt.\\" Digital Spy's Alex Fletcher noted: \\"Not since the days of Mr Blobby and Ice Warriors have weekends been filled with such peculiar antics.\\" The second episode, aired on 30 April, achieved an audience of 1.39m (10.5%). By the fourth episode, the viewing audience had declined to 900,000 viewers (a 5.9% audience share). Because the show has been so poorly received, BBC One decided to reschedule it to an earlier timeslot, beginning on 14 May. Don't Scare the Hare was moved from 17:25 to 16:40, while the second series of So You Think You Can Dance? ‚Äì whose ratings have also struggled ‚Äì was aired earlier. The schedule change was spurred on by the broadcast of the 2011 Eurovision Song Contest, which aired on 14 May. On the previous day, 13 May, the BBC had announced that the series would be cancelled after only three episodes had been aired. Speaking about the programme on an edition of BBC Breakfast, the BBC‚Äôs entertainment controller Mark Linsey said: \\"Obviously Hare is not going well. It was a huge risk we took ‚Äì it‚Äôs co-hosted by an animatronic hare ‚Äì and while it‚Äôs proved successful with children, we were hoping there would be enough knowingness within the show to draw in the adults. There wasn‚Äôt enough of that, which is where it fell down.\\" The final 3 episodes which hadn't aired were rescheduled for October.

According to the macroeconomist Gauti Eggertsson, this occurs when \\"the short-term nominal interest rate is zero and there are deflationary pressures and output contraction\\". When wages are pushed down by the simultaneous efforts of everyone in the labor force to work more even at lower wages, with interest rates against the zero bound, demand must fall because the only source of added demand would be added credit to compensate for those lower wages, credit which cannot be made available on any looser terms; this loss of demand from lower wages leads to a loss of jobs. The belief that there must necessarily be more work available if wages drop is an example of the fallacy of composition. The paradox of toil was proposed by Gauti Eggertsson in 2009. The term was coined to parallel the \\"paradox of thrift\\", a concept resurrected by John Maynard Keynes and popularized under that name by Paul Samuelson. Debate Casey Mulligan argued against this effect, proposing several natural tests, among them: * seasonal fluctuations in the job market in 2009; * the increase in the U.S. minimum wage in 2009. These, he said, failed to demonstrate the paradoxical effects. Eggertsson responded that seasonal labor supply variations, being relatively predictable, would have negligible effect on nominal short-term interest rates; and that an increase in the minimum wage affected only aggregate employment, with paradox of toil saying nothing about composition. Paul Krugman and Eggertsson have since proposed that the paradox of toil and the paradox of flexibility mean that wage and price flexibility do not facilitate recovery from recessions during a liquidity trap, but actually exacerbate them.  Influence  The reasoning behind the paradox of toil, together with the paradox of flexibility, has led to speculation that there might be a \\"paradox of innovation\\" by which greater labor productivity or cheaper products reduces demand for labor, which reduces wages, and therefore reduces demand overall.

Armwood is also known for being the first Executive Secretary of the Tampa Urban League and as a founder of five Household Industrial Arts Schools for African-American woman in five different states. Armwood High School in Seffner, Florida is named in her honor. Early life Blanche Armwood was born on January 23, 1890 in Tampa, Florida to Levin Armwood Jr. and Margaret Holloman. Born into a prominent middle-class family, she was the youngest of five children. Her mother was a skilled dressmaker and her father was Tampa's first black policeman in the late 1870s and a county deputy sheriff in 1895. He was also the Supervisor of County Roads and the supervisor of Mt. Zion school. Her father and her brother, Walter, owned the only black-owned drugstore in Tampa, the ‚ÄúGem.‚Äù Walter Armwood was also a professor at Bethune-Cookman University and a state supervisor for the U.S. Bureau Negro Economics. Blanche Armwood's father and paternal grandfather, Levin Armwood Sr., were both born into slavery, in Georgia and North Carolina respectively. The family moved to Hillsborough County in 1866 when Levin Jr. was eleven years old. Her great uncle, John Armwood, was an early landowner who homesteaded 159 acres of land in Hillsborough County and served as a negotiator between the Seminole Native Americans and white settlers along the Florida frontier. Her maternal grandfather, Adam Holloman, was a freeman who spent his entire life in the Tampa area. He owned citrus groves and was the Hillsborough County Commissioner from 1873 to 1877. Blanche Armwood's parents, having been unable to complete their formal educations, sent her to a private school, St. Peter Claver Catholic School. She graduated with honors in 1902. That same year, at the age of twelve, Armwood passed the State Uniform Teacher's Examination. As Tampa did not have a high school for black students, she attended Spelman Seminary (later Spelman College) in Atlanta, Georgia. She excelled in English and Latin courses. In 1906, at age sixteen, graduated summa cum laude from Spelman, earning a teacher's certificate. Career and activism Armwood returned to Tampa, where she began teaching in the Hillsborough County Public Schools, where she would remain for the next seven years. In 1913, Armwood suspended her teaching career when she married attorney Daniel Webster Perkins and relocated to Knoxville, Tennessee. The marriage was annulled the following year, and Armwood returned to Tampa. Armwood's service to the community began in 1914 when the Tampa Gas Company, in conjunction with the Hillsborough County Board of Education and the Colored Ministers Alliance commissioned her to organize an industrial arts school designed to train black women in the domestic sciences. From this alliance spawned the Tampa School of Household Arts, which was founded around 1915. The school trained black women and girls to use then modern household gas appliances as well as other skills which would enable the students to excel in domestic service. Following the school's first year of operation, over two hundred women received certificates of completion. Later, Armwood would establish similar schools in Roanoke, Virginia; Rock Hill, South Carolina; Athens, Georgia and New Orleans, Louisiana. Between 1917 and 1920, while living in New Orleans and married to dentist John C. Beatty, Armwood received state and federal acclaim for her work in training domestic workers. In 1918, she published Food Conservation in the Home a cookbook which was popular with women of all races. The cookbook, published during World War I, had a particularly poignant introduction, stating that: ‚ÄúEvery pound of white flour saved is equal to a bullet in our Nation‚Äôs defense.‚Äù In 1922, Jesse Thomas of the National Urban League nominated Armwood as the first Executive Secretary of the Tampa Urban League. Under her leadership, the Tampa Urban League established a public playground, a day care center, and a kindergarten for black children and played a significant role in the development of a subdivision offering blacks decent and affordable housing. Throughout her service with the league, she served as assistant principal at Tampa's Harlem Academy School. Armwood was appointed as the first Supervisor of Negro Schools by the Hillsborough County School Board. During her tenure, 1926-1934, she was instrumental in the school board's establishment of five new school buildings, improving the older schools, providing a vocational school for black students, increasing black teacher salaries, organizing parent-teacher associations at each school, and extending the school year for black students from six to nine months. She is also credited with establishing Booker T. Washington School in 1925. Initially a junior high school, the first for black students in Tampa, it was quickly expanded to include black senior high school students, another first, and was the first accredited school for black students in the county. In addition to her leadership positions in Tampa, Armwood held positions in several national organizations, including the Chair of the Home Economics Department of the National Association of Colored Women, National Campaign Speaker for the Republican Party, and as State Organizer for the Louisiana Chapter of the NAACP. She was a frequent speaker on national and international lecture circuits, speaking about voting rights and racial inequality. Armwood participated in the suffrage and the anti-lynching crusades. She worked closely with anti-lynching advocate Mary McLeod Bethune, including helping to raise funds and other resources for Bethune-Cookman College and other black schools. She was close friends with Clara Frye, a black nurse who provided the first medical facilities for blacks in Tampa. Armwood raised funds for Frye and helped establish the first training program for licensed black nurses and some of the first blood banks for blacks in Florida. Her increased interest in politics and equal rights for blacks and women led her to pursue a career in law. In 1934, Armwood enrolled in Howard Law School. She earned her juris doctorate in 1938 making her the first black female from the state of Florida to graduate from an accredited law school.  Death  While on a speaking tour in Medford, Massachusetts, Armwood became ill and died unexpectedly on October 16, 1939. She is buried in her family's plot at Tampa's L'Unione Italiana Cemetery, land purchased from the Armwood family by The Italian Club. In 1984, Congressman Michael Bilirakis and the Florida House of Representatives paid tribute to Armwood's legacy. That same year, Blanche Armwood Comprehensive High School, known today as Armwood High School, was opened in Tampa in her honor. Armwood is also memorialized on historical markers for Booker T. Washington School and L'Unione Italiana Cemetery. In 2014 she was memorialized with a bronze bust on Tampa Riverwalk's Historical Monument Trail. Encore!, the revitalization of Tampa's black business and entertainment district, has renamed a street in Armwood's honor.

The Dispatch is circulated in and around Moline while The Rock Island Argus is circulated in and around that city. The two are essentially the same newspaper, only with different front covers. They have a combined circulation of about 25,000. The newspapers were owned by the Small Newspaper Group, located in Kankakee, Illinois, until 2017, when Davenport-based Lee Enterprises bought the paper and its assets. History=Rock Island Argus The Argus, founded in Rock Island, is one of Illinois' oldest continuously published newspapers. It can trace its origin to 1851 with the founding of a weekly paper called The Republican. It became Rock Island County's first daily two years later after it was purchased by Colonel J.B. Danforth. Because Danforth was a staunch member of the Democratic Party he had the paper's name changed to the Rock Island Argus. The newspaper was purchased by John Potter in 1882 when the paper had 500 subscribers. He died in 1898 and his wife Minnie took over the management of the paper and ran it until her death. In 1925 she had the newspaper plant built on Fourth Avenue in Rock Island. The Potter family operated the newspaper until 1986, when it was bought by the Small Newspaper Group. In November 1932, the Potters bought Rock Island's first radio station, WHBF, later WKBF. Eventually, that station spawned an FM station (now WLKU) and a television station (still operating under the WHBF-TV calls). The Potters sold the Argus to the Small family in 1986. Issues for years 1862‚Äì1922 have been digitized and are available for free online at both the Chronicling America and the University of Illinois Library websites. Daily Dispatch The first issue of the Moline Daily Evening Dispatch was produced on July 31, 1878.Collins, p. 263. It was started by Oliver and Louise White, who were publishers of The Molly Stark, a weekly newspaper in Toulon, Illinois. Competition forced them to sell the paper to Patterson S. McGlynn and John K. Groom. In the early to mid-20th century the paper was under the leadership of Harry Sward, Lee R. Blackman and August Sundine. Under Sward's leadership the paper's identity changed from one focused on Moline to Western Illinois and it became The Daily Dispatch. The Daily Dispatch was purchased by Len H. Small on February 28, 1969, and the newspaper then started the conversion from the ‚Äúhot metal‚Äù method of composition to computerized photocomposition. The plant was expanded in 1974 and the first Sunday edition of the paper was published on March 14, 1976. Dispatch‚ÄìArgus From 1986 onward, Small Newspaper Group gradually cut back the local operations of the Argus and consolidated most of its business and editorial operations with those of The Dispatch. By the 1990s, the two newspapers' content was virtually identical, the only difference being the mastheads. In 1995 both papers switched from evening to morning publication. Quad-Cities Online has been operated by the papers since 1994. It provides local online news, weather, sports and event information and has grown to include an online auction; QCHomes.com, a service for buying or selling real estate; and opportunities for banner, email and mobile advertising. Lee Enterprises announced on June 19, 2017, that it had reached an agreement with the Small Newspaper Group to purchase The Dispatch‚ÄìArgus and its assets. This made the Dispatch and Argus sister publications to Lee's flagship title, the Quad-City Times, which has long been the major newspaper on the Iowa side of the Quad Cities. While the Dispatch-Argus will maintain a separate editorial voice, it will share a publisher with the Times and Muscatine Journal. The Leader From 1986 through 2007, a weekly total market coverage newspaper called The Leader circulated in Scott County, Iowa, location of Davenport. Distributed on Thursdays, the newspaper contained re-printed content from the Dispatch and Argus, plus exclusive features and hard news stories from Davenport and the Iowa side of the Quad Cities.

The goal of this practice is to achieve the timeless state of the weizza, who awaits the appearance of the future Buddha, Metteya. Weikza practices are less common than merit-making practices or vipassanƒÅ meditation. During the socialist era from 1962 to 1988, Ne Win banned secret weizza associations, weizza magazines and literature, and portrayals of weizza from films and other media, considering them a threat to his regime. Weizza have made a resurgence since 1988, particularly following the abolition of the national censorship board in 2012. Burmese pagodas often house weizza shrines, where they are venerated for their spiritual purity and their devotion to those in need. Weizza teachers have also amassed hundreds of thousands of followers using social media. Etymology The word weizza (·Äù·Ä≠·Äá·Äπ·Äá·Ä¨) comes from the Pali word vijja, which means ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù or ‚Äúwisdom.‚Äù Weizzas in the historical tradition Aside from epigraphs, there are no local Indic or vernacular compositions that have been securely dated to pre-Pagan Burma. However, there are some later attributions of texts that were written during the first millennium. One such example is the KappƒÅla·πÖkƒÅra, a vijjƒÅdhara (\\"weikza\\") text said to have been written by the bhikkhu Uttamasƒ´ri during the first century CE. The text survives in an 18th-century Pali-Burmese nissaya version (which attributes the text to Uttamasƒ´ri in its colophon) compiled by Taungdwin Sayadaw √ëa·πáƒÅbhidhammƒÅla·πÖkƒÅra. In Myanmar, there are two classes of wizards; the s√¥ns and the weizzas. The former are considered a bane to society, while the latter spend their days helping the common folk and undoing the curses brought upon by the s√¥ns. The commonly known weizzas known today first appeared during the Konbaung Dynasty, when Bo Bo Aung, a monk in Sagaing, discovered manuscripts revealing the secrets of weizza. However, many recognized weizzas today come from before the Konbaung Dynasty. This was the last dynasty to rule Burma before colonial rule. Before weizzas, there were the Zawgyi (·Äá·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·ÄÇ·Äª·ÄÆ) and Yawgi (·Äö·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÇ·ÄÆ). The Zawgyi were wizards who were written about in Burmese literature. The Yawgi (·Äö·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÇ·ÄÆ) were Buddhist yogis who lead ascetic lives and wore brown robes. They followed eight to 10 precepts of Buddhism, whereas most laymen follow 5. Weizza orders Weizzas are divided into four major orders: # The Pyada Weizza, who work with mercury # The Than Weizza, who work with iron # The Se Weizza, who specialize in medicine # The In Weizza, who specialize in yantra signs and squares Among these, the Than and In are considered the most powerful. The Pyada Weizza, or Mercury Wizards, also study alchemy in order to produce gold and silver from more common metals. The Than Weizzas are considered by their followers as masters of not only their subject, but also as medical advisors. Purported abilities Among their powers, weizzas possess the ability to see past lives, see and hear things that are far away, read minds, teleport, dive into the earth, walk on water, and be in multiple places simultaneously. Powerful practitioners of the weizzas way are purported to live for centuries, even choosing the time of their next reincarnation. The In Weizza, who work with cabalistic squares, use one's birth date and time to create powerful charms and spells. In The Burman, Sir J. George Scott described some squares and charms so powerful that they could set a house ablaze. Others, engraved in stone and embedded in one's skin, would prevent drowning. Merely scratching an in in a house or tree could cause lightning to strike it. Tools of the tradeWeizza grimoires= Two traditional manuscripts contain rudimentary guidelines on the practices of weizzas: the Bedin and the Deitt√¥n. The latter is a book on astrology and cabalistic science. Containing just basic principles of the art of weizzas, the teachings in these texts are often surpassed by the weizzas own individual study and personal advancement. However, these books were once complete, many having been burned by religious zealots in the time of the last Buddha. The remains were spared from the fire by Devadatta, the cousin of Shin Gautama. Devadatta was always plotting against Shin Gautama, so he saved portions of the old science. Thus, this style of learning is looked upon with suspicion by many religious folk. =Medical remedies= Weizza prescriptions may be composed of chili powder, cloves, and ginger for fevers to earth-oil infused with seeds, bark, leaves, flowers, roots, and minerals. Weizzas are specially adept with pills and powders, which are carried in bright red phials made of heavily scented bamboo. These ingredients are gathered with attention to the phases of the moon and placement of the constellations. Another potent ingredient in the weizza's cabinet is meteoric stones, which can be gathered within three days of lightning striking a piece of earth and are used as ophthalmic medicine. Weizzas seldom use liquids in their practice of medicine. Medical philosophies Two schools of thought exist in weizza medicine: # The datsayƒÅs, whose primary focus is on diets # #The beindawsayƒÅs, who work with potent drugs In both schools, the human body is divided into four elements (dats): earth (patawi dat), fire (tezaw dat), water (apaw dat), and air (wayaw dat). Some practitioners also include ether (akatha), though this element is disregarded by doctors. #Earth: the flesh, bones, hair, intestines, etc. # #Fire: eating, drinking, chewing, and licking # #Water: the fat, blood, bile, spittle, mucus, etc. # #Air: the six kinds of winds Modern perception of weizzas Weizza following still exists in Myanmar, though the socialist government during the Ne Win era suppressed this ideology. The former government forbade the publication of weizza materials and selling of weizza prints, which are popular in household altars. Even so, weizza followers abound. There exist exclusive groups of weizza devotees called gaing. These groups follow a set of tenets, are headed by a charismatic leader, and center their devotion on one or more weizza saints.

It carried vehicular traffic from 1931 to 1990 and has since been demolished. The southwest corner of Arkansas was cut off from the rest of the state by the Red River, which was crossed only by ferries and one railroad bridge until the twentieth century. The bridge at Garland was designed by state highway engineer Ira G. Hedrick in October 1927 and located along the old military road from El Dorado to Texarkana (later to become part of U.S. Route 82). Hedrick's design included three through spans of Pennsylvania truss. The winning bid for construction was submitted by the Kansas City Bridge Company, which was given the contract in September 1929. Construction activities for the bridge disturbed traffic through Garland, and this period was marked by conflict between state highway authorities and the city. (The new bridge also threatened the ferry business owned by Garland's Mayor Beasley.) The spans (though not the approaches) were complete by the morning of September 3, 1930, when two dynamite blasts threw the central span from its piers and into the river, doing $150,000 of damage. The motive was thought to be either resentment over the use of non-union labor on the bridge or an attempt to protect the local ferry business. A highway worker arrested in December and was convicted of dynamiting the bridge, but the man he accused of hiring him was acquitted, and no other persons were brought to trial for the crime. The bridge was repaired and opened, without ceremony, on July 15, 1931. Originally opened as a toll bridge, the Arkansas General Assembly made all bridges in the state free in 1938. In later years, the bridge proved inadequate to support heavy truck traffic on Route 82. A steel support system was added to the east end in 1986, but the bridge continued to suffer from spalling concrete on the piers. The bridge was added to the Historic American Engineering Record in 1988. A new bridge was constructed upstream to carry Route 82 so that the old bridge could be closed. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990, but was in very poor condition, and it was ultimately demolished and removed from the National Register in 1999.

The Neo-Renaissance building erected from 1875 to 1881 is located in the Austrian capital Vienna on Schmerlingplatz, a square near the Ringstra√üe boulevard in the central district of Innere Stadt. In addition to the Supreme Court, the Palace of Justice houses the Higher Regional Court of Vienna and the Regional Court for Civil Matters Vienna and the General Prosecution and the Supreme Public Prosecutor for Vienna. History The Palace in 1881 The building was projected by the Historicist architect Alexander Wielemans von Monteforte (1843‚Äì1911) as the new residence of the Supreme Court established in the course of the 1848 revolutions and headed by President Anton von Schmerling since 1865. In the Austrian July Revolt of 1927, violent demonstrations took place after a jury had acquitted several nationalist paramilitaries who during an armed conflict with Social Democratic Schutzbund members in Schattendorf had shot a disabled World War I veteran and an eight-year-old child. In the morning of July 15 numerous protesters gathered in front of the Austrian Parliament Building but were pushed towards Schmerlingplatz by the mounted police force. Several demonstrators broke into the ground-floor rooms and began to demolish furniture and files. At about half past twelve, the Palace was set on fire. During their attempts to extinguish the fire the Vienna firefighters were attacked, hoses were cut and hydrants ran out of water. The fire rapidly spread out all over the building and it took until the early morning to get it under control. Between 1929 and 1931 the palace was restored with significant modifications of the fa√ßade and the addition of a new level. The restoration, in a historicist style, was carried out by Viennese architects Heinrich Ried and Alfred Keller..Heinrich Karl Ried www.architektenlexikon.at In a sweeping general renovation a few years ago, the Palace was forced to meet both the stringent requirements of monument protection as well as those of a modern office in order to provide proper service to litigants.

This is additional type of learning to Gagn√©‚Äôs types of learning: declarative knowledge, intellectual skills, cognitive strategies, attitudes, and psychomotor skills. Learning goal not always include one learning outcome. The multiple objectives are frequently occurred when instruction handled not just single topic or lesson to the course. Integration of multiple objectives may usefully be conceived in terms of the more comprehensive activity in which the human performer is engaged, which we call an enterprise. An enterprise is a purposive activity that may depend for its execution on some combination of verbal information, intellectual skills, and cognitive strategies, all related by their involvement in the common goal. Given such an integrative goal of performance resulting from instruction, the various single objectives are viewed as being integrated as constituents of an enterprise schema. (Gagn√© & Merill, 1990) Gagn√© ‚Äôs types of learning outcomes  Robert M. Gagn√© (1985) divided possible learning outcomes into five large \\"Domains\\"; declarative knowledge, intellectual skill, cognitive strategies, psychomotor skills and attitude. In 1990, Gagn√© and Merrill added new type of learning which is learning enterprises. *Declarative knowledge: Also called as verbal information. This type of learning requires a learner to recall in verbatim, paraphrased, or summarized form facts, lists, names, or organized information. It requires recall, recognize, or state contents in learner‚Äôs own words. *Intellectual skills: Intellectual skills are typified by application of rules to previously unencountered examples or information. This type of learning outcome differs from declarative knowledge because learners learn how to not only recall, but also to apply knowledge to instances not encountered during instruction. The four most common types of intellectual skills are making discriminations, forming concepts, applying rules, and solving problems. *Cognitive strategies: This is ‚Äúlearning how to learn‚Äù. Cognitive strategies are the metaprocesses that we use to manage our thinking about things and manage our own learning. A more complex cognitive strategy would be figuring out how to organize, cluster, remember, and apply new information. *Psychomotor skills: This is the learning about how to performance. Coordinated muscular movements that are typified by smoothness and precise timing are called psychomotor skills(R.Gagn√©, 1985) *Attitude: An attitude is a mental state that predisposes a learner to choose to behave in a certain way(R. Gagn√©, 1985). Attitudes affects the learner's choice, and this play a strong role in motivational aspect. *Learning Enterprise: types of activities that require students to collaborate and use a variety of capabilities; translate those activities into a class project; translate the project into objectives by identifying the component skills From each of the single categories of learning outcome, the instructional designer is able to analyze and prescribe the instructional conditions necessary for effective learning. When instruction is considered in the more comprehensive sense of a module, section, or course, in a macro level, it becomes apparent that multiple objectives commonly occur. Base of learning enterprises=Macro strategy First of all, micro strategies are ways to approach instruction on particular topics of learning goals. Typically, an instructional design and development task for either education or training involves more than one goal or topic. Therefore, we need to approach with Macro level. Developing instruction at the macro level is frequently referred to as curriculum development or design which is concerned with making decisions about the scope, organization, and sequence of content at the macro level. Posner and coworkers (Posner&Strike;, 1976; Poser&Rudnitsky;, 1994) classified curriculum sequencing structures, which is used in curriculum development, into five major categories: world related structure, learning-related structure, utilization- related structure, inquiry-related structure, and concept-related structure. Learning enterprise is based on macro strategy, because it is beyond the single topic, or goal. Especially it is connected with learning- related structure. Diagram of Curriculum sequencing structure Learning- Related Structure Learning-related structures organize information in such a way that new learning builds on relevant prior knowledge. We use this into two ways. One is prerequisite-based structure which is based on prerequisite relationship of all the information and skills in the course. The other is Knowledge structure. The knowledge structure idea is seen in learning enterprises. The unifying element in an enterprise is a declarative knowledge representation of enterprise itself. A strong emphasis is placed on the purposeful and interrelated qualities of the knowledge, and hence, various theories related to schema. The declarative knowledge of the enterprise is referred to as an enterprise schema. Components of learning enterprises Each kind of enterprise is represented in memory by a schema that reflects the purpose or goal of the enterprise category, the various knowledge and skills required to engage in the enterprise, and a scenario which indicates when and how each piece of knowledge or skill is required by the enterprise. Enterprise Schema The enterprise schema is expected to contain a number of knowledge and skill constituents which become associated in the service of the integrated goal. These include verbal labels, connected-discourse forms of verbal information, intellectual skills, and cognitive strategies. Depending upon the enterprise, motor skills, and attitudes may also be involved. There are different kinds of enterprise schemas, just as there are different kinds of application forms. Each such schema contains slots to be filled by the details of any specific enterprise. There appear to be several categories of integrative goals that are useful to distinguish as different kinds of enterprise schemas. Three varieties of enterprise and their associated enterprise schemas are described, designated by their goals as denoting, manifesting, and discovering. Denoting An entity (thing, place, event) or class of entities may be denoted by giving its name, the class to which it belongs, and the function it serves. The denoting communication may also include identification of the parts of the entity, their locations, and functions. As an example, a hawser is denoted as a large rope (its class) for towing or moving a ship (its function). Denoting may also proceed to indicate parts, such as the hawser bend (used for connecting two hawsers) and a hawser clamp (a device for gripping a hawser). Entities other than objects may be denoted, such as persons, places, or events. Examples might be the U. S. Attorney General, the city of St. Louis, the 1988 baseball World Series. An enterprise of this sort is a part of many human occupations such as teaching, explaining, orienting, counseling, and giving directions. Manifesting Actions involving entities as actors or objects may be arranged in a series of steps leading to a particular result. Such a series is called a process, and it is this that is the object of a manifesting enterprise. Learners must gain knowledge of the steps in the process. A manifesting enterprise consists of making a process evident to other people (e.g., students, co-workers) by indicating its stages and their sequence. Manifesting a process implies going beyond employing a simple verbal communication; it may require the use of pictures or props, as is commonly done in a demonstration. An example of manifesting a process occurs when a student can indicate the stages in the life cycle of an insect and can show how these stages vary under different environmental conditions. Discovering The enterprise of discovering reveals (to observers) a previously unknown novel entity or process. Often, entities and the procedures for manipulating them are inventions. One of the most creative types of enterprise involves the capability to design or discover a novel entity or procedure. For example, to remove tight covers from jars, a learner might discover the design of an object that grips the cover tightly, making possible its unscrewing from the jar. Alternatively, a learner might discover a procedure that would cause the cover to loosen its grip on the jar by metal expansion. As another example, having knowledge of control mechanisms in mechanical systems, a learner may discover a hypothesis about biological control mechanisms which trigger phases of the life cycle of insects. Enterprise Scenario in learning transfer Verbal information in the form of an enterprise scenario is typically a prominent part of an enterprise schema. It is this declarative knowledge that relates particular singular objectives that compose the expected behavior to the purposive activity that is the enterprise. The enterprise scenario ‚Äútells‚Äù the learners that the concept they are identifying, or the procedure they are following, is actually an essential part of a purposeful enterprise. For example, an enterprise scenario may remind students of arithmetic that they are going to encounter future situations requiring them to perform mental subtraction in order to verify the change from a purchase made with a paper-money bill of fixed value. Or, an enterprise scenario may help a student of physics to bring to mind the relation between the practice of electric heating and the cost of electric power. The enterprise schema is likely to be a factor of considerable prominence in the mediation of transfer of learning from one task to another, or from a learning task to a later performance. As contrasted with factors pertaining to the quality of learning content such as amount and variety of practice, the enterprise frame is a metacognitive feature. The implication it carries for instructional design is to ensure transfer from training to the job, provision must be made for learner acquisition of an enterprise schema in addition to the specific knowledges and skills that the performance requires. The enterprise scenario of this schema is one that relates each component of knowledge and skill to the goal, and thus to the enterprise that embodies this goal. Conclusion Course with enterprise goals might have a first tier of organization structured by the enterprises themselves, organized according to their schemata and sequenced accordingly. The second tier of organization might employ an inquiry or utilization structure. (Smith&Ragan;) References #Robert M. Gagn√© and M.

The album is the first to feature guitarists Jesse Lawson and Jack Fowler. Production Recording took place at Interlace Audio in Portland, Oregon. Sessions were co-produced by Kris Crummett, who also served as the engineer, and the band. Crummett provided additional instrumentation, specifically percussion, electronics, piano and strings, before mixing and mastering the recordings. Composition \\"Do It Now Remember It Later\\" is about people who stand in the way of others' dreams. For the band, this refers to critics and people they work with. \\"If You Can't Hang\\" is about three different relationships and the lessons learned from them. Quinn came up with the pre-chorus while waiting before a show in San Francisco, with the rest of the song following shortly after. \\"Who Are You Now\\" talks about hope and self- reflection. \\"Four Corners and Two Sides\\" discuss faith and where a person stands with it. Quinn came up with \\"A Trophy Father's Trophy Son\\" while thinking about divorce and how it affects the parent's children. It is written from the perspective of a son to a father. Guitarist Jack Fowler showed the rest of the band a riff, which later became \\"Fire\\". It talks about a drive people have inside themselves, and the knowledge that what we do could consumes us. \\"Tally It Up: Settle the Score\\" was the first song written for the album. The band were apprehensive about including \\"Your Nickel Ain't Like My Dime\\", but, according to Quinn, \\"it has a vibe that not many bands can pull off in our scene.\\" Quinn and guitarist Jesse Lawson wrote \\"All My Heart\\" acoustically, and decided to include it as-is on the album. Quinn titled the last track \\"Let's Cheers to This\\" after his stepson's enthusiasm for New Years Day. He added that it, along with the album, is a \\"cheers to triumph, hard times, success, and to life itself.\\" Release On March 30, 2011, Let's Cheers to This was announced for release in May.

They were originally a royal necropolis for the Marinid dynasty which ruled over Morocco in the 13th to 15th centuries. Today, they are a popular lookout point over the historic city.  Historical background  A photograph of the tombs in 1881 There is sparse information available on the site and its history. However, the ruined tombs are believed to date from the 14th century, during the Marinid dynasty (13th-15th centuries), hence their name. The Marinids conquered Fez in 1250 (CE) and turned it into their capital, eventually cementing this status by building a new fortified palace- city, Fes el-Jdid, in 1276 alongside the existing old city (Fes el-Bali). Before the foundation of Fes el-Jdid, however, some sources describe the Marinids has having already established their first fortified palace on the hill to the north of Fes el-Bali known as al-Qula (today also known as the \\"Hill of the Marinids\\"). This palace also included a mosque (remnants of which, including a mihrab, survived until modern times) and a bathhouse (hammam). Some sources attribute these structures, or a predecessor of these structures, to the earlier reign of the Almohad caliph Muhammad al-Nasir (ruled 1199-1213), who was also responsible for rebuilding the city walls. Another author attributes the construction of the al-Qula palace to after 1287, around the same time that the Marinids created the Mosara Garden to the north of Fes el-Jdid. While it has not been possible to reconstruct the layout and appearance of the palace, the historical chronicler Leo Africanus claimed that the palace was impressive. qoubba (domed building) behind the main tombs, and some outlying parts of the Bab Guissa Cemetery in the backgroundalt= A royal necropolis eventually developed on this site, where some other tombs may have already existed as early as the 11th and 12th centuries (perhaps connected to the nearby Bab Guissa Cemetery). Two Marinid stelae (tombstones) were discovered near this site in the 20th century: one belonged to a young princess called Zineb who died in 1335 and the other belonged to a high official named Abu Ali al-Nasir who died at beginning of the same century. The two stelae are now kept at the Dar Batha Museum in Fes. Up until the middle of the 14th century the Marinid dynasty buried its rulers in the royal necropolis at Chellah, just outside Rabat. Sultan Abu Inan, however, was interred in the Grand Mosque of Fes el-Jdid upon his death in 1358 and after this his successors, starting with Ibrahim ibn Ali, were buried in the necropolis on the al-Qula hill next to the Marinid palace there. (Only one of them was again buried at Chellah, which otherwise became abandoned.) They continued to be interred on this hill between 1361 and 1398 and then again at the end of the dynasty in 1465, when Abd al-Haqq II was buried here. To this day, no thorough archaeological excavations have yet been carried out on the site of the tombs. Unfortunately, very few remnants of the Marinid palace complex here have survived, in part due to continuous quarrying over the centuries and to more recent constructions.  Description of the site  Fragments of stucco decoration and of an inscription inside one of the tombs Today the ruins of two tall rectangular-base mausoleums with large horseshoe-arch entrances are still visible, and perhaps the remains of other structures. It is not known exactly who was buried where in the large mausoleums but given their monumentality they were probably meant for members of the royal family. Some fragments of carved stucco decoration and an inscription can still be seen on the walls of the mausoleums, which is all that remains of their once rich ornamentation. The historical writer Leo Africanus mentioned that the tombs were heavily decorated and featured lavish and colourful marble epitaphs. The site was probably once enclosed by a wall, giving it the form of a rawda, an enclosed funerary garden or private cemetery in the Islamic tradition. Behind (or north of) the two mausoleums are also the ruins of another small domed building or qoubba that may have been part of the Merinid necropolis as well. The hillsides around the tombs (mostly to the north and east) are still occupied by the sprawling Bab Guissa Cemetery (named after the nearby city gate, Bab Guissa), though the graves visible today are likely much more recent. Today the site is perhaps best known as a lookout with panoramic views over the old city of Fez, popular at sunset, and often mentioned in guidebooks and tourist literature. In addition to the views, it is also a notable place to hear the call to prayer (adhan) broadcasting simultaneously from all the mosques in the old city. center  See also  * Borj Nord ‚Äì nearby monument * Borj Sud ‚Äì well-known lookout area on the opposite side of the old city * Bab Ftouh ‚Äì southern gate and major cemetery of Fes el-Bali * Moulay Abdallah Mosque ‚Äì more recent royal necropolis in Fez  References  Category:Berber architecture Category:Buildings and structures in Fez, Morocco Category:Marinid architecture Category:Tourism in Morocco Category:Tourist attractions in Morocco Category:Tombs in Morocco ","title":"Marinid Tombs"},{"id":"31575682","text":"Jason Kauahooululaunaheleonakuahiwi Stearns (born October 31, 1976) is an American writer who worked for ten years in the Congo, including three years during the Second Congo War. He first traveled to the Congo in 2001 to work for a local human rights organization, H√©ritiers de la Justice, in Bukavu. He went on to work for the United Nations peacekeeping mission (MONUC). In 2008 Stearns was named by the UN Secretary General to lead a special UN investigation into the violence in the country. Stearns is the author of the book, Dancing in the Glory of Monsters: The Collapse of the Congo and the Great War of Africa, and the blog, Congo Siasa. He received a Ph.D. in political science from Yale University on May 24, 2016. Biography Jason Stearns was born in San Francisco in 1976 to Stephen C. Stearns, an evolutionary biologist, and Beverly Peterson Stearns, a journalist. He has an older brother, Justin, who is professor of Middle Eastern history at New York University. At the age of six, the family moved to Switzerland, where Stephen Stearns taught biology at the University of Basel. Stearns attended Swiss public school in Arlesheim and Muenchenstein, on the outskirts of Basel, and spent a year in Laja, Chile, on an exchange program. Upon graduation from Gymnasium Muenchenstein, he volunteered at the Swiss Tropical Institute's field research station in Ifakara, Tanzania. In 1997, Jason joined his older brother in the United States, attending first Hampshire College and then neighboring Amherst College in Massachusetts. He graduated with a degree in political science. Having been accepted to law school at Harvard Law School, he traveled to Bukavu in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo to volunteer with H√©ritiers de la Justice, a local human rights group in September 2001. Deferring law school, he went on to work for the International Human Rights Law Group and the United Nations peacekeeping operation MONUC for the following two years. He eventually decided not to attend law school, enrolling in a PhD program in political science at Yale University in 2009. Between 2005 and 2007, Stearns was based in Nairobi, Kenya, as a senior analyst for the International Crisis Group, working on the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi. In 2007, he left to spend a year and a half researching and writing Dancing in the Glory of Monsters, a history of the Congo wars of 1996-2003, based on interviews with leading protagonists of the conflict. The title stems from a speech given by Congolese President Laurent Kabila in which he castigates Congolese for blaming their woes on a few political leaders, suggesting that the political malaise in the country is a more systemic problem. The book, which was eventually published in 2011, received critical acclaim in major newspapers and magazines. In 2008, Stearns was named as coordinator of the United Nations Group of Experts on the Congo, a panel responsible for researching support and financing of armed groups in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. In their final report, the Group found both the Rwandan and Congolese governments guilty of violating United Nations sanctions. According to eyewitness testimony, phone records and other documentary evidence, the Rwandan government had provided military support to the National Congress for the Defense of the People (CNDP) rebel group, while the Congolese government had collaborated with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) rebels, as well as other Congolese armed groups.UN Group of Experts Report 2008, pp. 7-18 and pp. 25-28. Following the report, the Swedish and Dutch government temporarily suspended aid to the Rwandan government. Several months after the publication of the report, the Rwandan government arrested the leader of the CNDP, Laurent Nkunda, and struck a peace deal with the Congolese government. In 2010, Stearns married Lusungu Kayani, a Tanzanian-American employee of the United Nations and a fashion and textile entrepreneur.

Nomenclature  The TMEM229B gene is also known as C14orf83, FLJ33387, Q8NBD8, Hs.509707, Hs.712258, IPR010540, and CN083_HUMAN.  Gene  The TMEM229B gene is located on the sense strand (-) of chromosome 14 at location 14q24.1 and spans the chromosomal locus 67,936,983‚Äî67,982,021. Covering a total of 45,038 base pairs (bp) along the chromosome, the TMEM229B gene has a total of 3 exons in its primary unspliced transcript mRNA of 4,068 bp. There are a total of 7 transcript variants for TMEM229B ranging in mRNA size from 519 bp to 5008 bp. The TMEM229B gene is flanked by phosphatidylinotisol glycan anchor class H (PIGH), a protein associated with the endoplasmic reticulum specifically GPI-anchor biosynthesis, and PLEK2 on its left. See Figure 1.0. The gene is highly conserved in vertebrates, including portions of the approximately 3,000 base pairs of 3'UTR.  Tissue distribution  Expressed sequence tag mapping of TMEM229B gene expression indicates that it is ubiquitously expressed throughout the body. TMEM229B is more heavily expressed in the parathyroid, skin, and thyroid tissues, and moderately expressed in bone marrow, trachea, spleen, eye, brain, pancreas, mammary gland, intestine, liver, thymus, lymph node, ovarian, muscle, lung, blood, and kidney tissues.  Protein  The translated TMEM229B protein is a total of 167 amino acids long, with a predicted molecular weight of 19,531 Daltons. The TMEM229B protein contains a domain of unknown function, part of the domain family DUF1113, spanning from amino acids 87 to 135. Based on predicted structure TMEM229b is highly resemblant of a connexin subunit. A highly conserved phosphorylation site exists at the Threonine-139 position. See multiple sequence alignment below. File:TMEM229_b.jpgAnnotated diagram of the TMEM229b gene (with its 3 exons), mature mRNA and protein domains. Functional peptide is predicted to take the form of a connexin 4-pass transmembrane subunit (seen below).  Clinical relevance  Expression of the TMEM229B gene increases in several disease states including amelanotic skin melanoma, B-cell neoplasm, breast carcinoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, carcinoma, cutaneous T cell lymphoma, esophageal carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, glioblastoma, liver carcinoma, lymphoma, melanoma, small cell lung carcinoma, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, thyroid carcinoma and Wilms' tumor as found in several microarray experiments. Over-expression of the TMEM229B gene has not been linked as a causal factor in any of these disease states.

Established in 1906, the school has a reputation as one of the most prestigious school in the country, owing to its excellent academic performance, highly selective admissions criteria, rich history and influential stream of alumni. Location The school is in Kisubi along the Kampala‚ÄìEntebbe Road, approximately , by road, south of Kampala, Uganda's capital and largest city. This is approximately , by road, north of Entebbe International Airport, the main civilian and military airport in Uganda. The coordinates of the college are 0¬∞07'17.0\\"N, 32¬∞32'00.0\\"E (Latitude:0.121389; Longitude:32.533333). History St. Mary's School was founded by Reverend Raux Modeste of the White Fathers Congregation in 1906 and was named after its patroness, Saint Mary. Today, the Catholic Archdiocese of Kampala owns St. Mary's College Kisubi (SMACK). At the beginning of 1899, the Catholic chiefs in the Buganda Kingdom, under the leadership of Chief Stanislas Mugwanya, raised the question of higher education for Catholic youths in the kingdom. Their request was laid for consideration by the August Assembly of the White Fathers' General Chapter at Algiers in 1900. Out of those efforts, SMACK was founded. Reputation According to a 2018 published report, St. Mary's College Kisubi is the most prestigious school in Uganda, owing to its excellent academic performance and all round nurturing of its students. The school offers education that encourages independent thinking and development. St. Mary's started out occupying only about 10 buildings. The oldest of them was the two-storeyed dormitory for Senior One and Two students that was later brought down and replaced by the current Chemistry Laboratory. The administration block remains unchanged from back in the day. Standing tall at the centre of the college, it serves as the most centralised block on campus. Uniform The SMACK students from 1906 to the early 1960s wore a pair of shorts and a white shirt as their uniform. Those who could afford a pair of shoes did and others barefoot. With many years of development, the uniform and the badge inclusive have had to succumb to many changes in design. The students today don a white shirt with a plain navy blue tie for ordinary level students and a striped tie for the advanced level students, a pair of grey trousers. Blazers have since become mandatory for all higher school certificate students. However, the core of the badge (the boat, sea and stars) has stood the test of time. Lord Snowdon, in 1964, commissioned the SMACK memorial library, after the death of 12 students in a motor accident. Some of these students were part of the school football team that had gone to participate in a tournament at which they emerged victors. Cheering on the way back from the match, Milton Obote‚Äôs army suspected them to be rebels and the school lorry, which with the school bus was carrying the students, was knocked down by the army truck. In addition to the 12 deaths, an even greater number was injured that day. Today, the twelve trees planted also in memory of these students still stand tall right next to the Senior Six block. SMACK has been known to produce all round students in terms of academics, co- and extra- curricular activities. Various students have been admitted into international universities on scholarships on medicine, engineering, law and aviation among others. St Mary's again has been a home for building sports giants ranging from national sports champions to East African games as well as international icons in the sports arena. The students‚Äô love for sports and games stems from way back. It's no wonder that the boys look forward, every day, to going to the pitch to do what they love to do best. Rugby, the sport that is seemingly the face of SMACK was welcomed with much excitement in 1992 after the abolition of boxing. The ever growing college, alongside its infrastructural developments, saw the introduction of a number of sports like basketball, football, swimming and hockey. St. Mary's youngest building sits atop Kisubi hill as the tallest one yet. The new three-storied building, valued at 2.9 billion, serves as the new HSC block, replacing and outcompeting the older single-storied S5 block which stood erect since the introduction of the Higher School Certificate in SMACK in the recent past. Alumni The Old Boys of this college have always played an important role in the welfare and general growth of St. Mary's. With generous donations and words of counsel, along with the school administration the SMACK Old Boy's Association (SMACKOBA) they have been involved in the running of the school in one way or another right from its foundation in the latter half of the 20th century. Called upon in the 60s, the Old Boys took charge of the c of a circular profile, but because of cost, the current plan was taken up depicting a gallant eagle in flight. Notable alumni of St. Mary's College Kisubi (Old Smackists) include two vice presidents, two prime ministers of Buganda Kingdom, cabinet ministers, judges, lawyers, and distinguished academics.

The Theatre is owned by the Guild of Players who bought it in 1959, thereby saving it from demolition. The Guild's aim is to promote the tradition of live theatre in Dumfries. It is the venue for the Guild of Players' own productions and for performances from visiting companies. In addition it is used extensively as a venue for the Dumfries and Galloway Arts Festival, the Dumfries Music Festival and the Dumfries Musical Theatre Company. History The Theatre Royal in Dumfries In 1790, actor manager George Stephen Sutherland approached interested people in Dumfries and the surrounding area with the intention of raising subscriptions for a purpose-built theatre, to take the place of the Old Assembly Room in the George Hotel.. Among those involved was Robert Burns, then resident at Ellisland Farm, a few miles to the north of Dumfries. Robert Burns, writing from Ellisland to his friend William Nicol, on 2 February 1790, said: 'Our theatrical company, of which you must have heard, leave us this week. Their merit and character are indeed very great, both on stage and in private life, not a worthless creature among them; and their encouragement has been accordingly. Their usual run is from eighteen to twenty pounds a night; seldom less than the one, and the house will hold no more than the other. There have been instances of sending away six and eight and ten pounds a night for want of room. A new theatre is to be built by subscription; the first stone is to be laid on Friday first to come. Three hundred guineas have been raised by thirty subscribers, and thirty more might have been got if wanted. The manager, Mr Sutherland, was introduced to me by a friend from Ayr; and a worthier or cleverer fellow I have rarely met with.' http://www.robertburns.org/encyclopedia/TheatreRoyalDumfries.856.shtml Sutherland was also a lessee of the Tontine Assembly Rooms, Paisleyhttp://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/PaisleyTheatres.htm and had tried to build a theatre in Ayr. http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/AyrTheatres.htm Completed at a cost of ¬£800, what was then known simply as The Theatre or the New Theatre, opened on Saturday 29 September 1792, under the management of Sutherland's partner, John Brown Williamson, from the Theatre Royal Haymarket. With a design by architect Thomas Boydhttp://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=407943 of Dumfries, based on that of the Theatre Royal in Bristol, it seated between five and six hundred. Williamson married Louisa Fontenelle, an actress in the theatre company, and with whom Burns corresponded sending her a poem and two prologues; they emigrated to America where he became manager of a theatre in Boston, MA. A Burns Companion by Allan Bold, published 2016 The first reference to the theatre under its present name is to be found in an advertisement in the \\"Dumfries and Galloway Courier\\" in 1811. One of the early lessees was John Henry Alexander from Dunbar who moved on to Glasgow to lease, then buy, the Theatre Royal, Dunlop Street in the city.http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Glasgow/TRDunlop.htmhttp://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Glasgow/TRYorkStreet.htm#saThe Theatre Royal:Entertaining a Nation, by Graeme Smith, published 2008 J.H. Robb of the Theatre Royal, Dundee was a lessee in the 1860s. Improvement of the stage in 1830 and a radical renovation was carried out when the theatre was owned by William Mackie http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/DumfriesTheatres.htmof Moat House, Dumfries in 1876 by architect Charles J. Phipps, who had worked on the Gaiety in London and the Theatre Royal, Edinburgh, which increased the seating capacity to over a thousand, enhanced the amenity of the theatre for players and patrons. A vivid description of a benefit performance in the latter years of the nineteenth century is to be found in \\"The Greenwood Hat\\" by J. M. Barrie, who spent some years of his youth in Dumfries and was a keen member of the Theatre Royal's audience. In 1902, early forms of moving pictures began following their introduction at the Paris Exhibition. This combination of moving pictures, 'movies' and music hall acts in a mixed programme, proved successful until 1909 when the theatre was purchased by P. Stobie & Son, who installed a flat maple floor to take advantage of the late Victorian craze for roller skating. It seems to have been too late in the day for a Roller Skating Rink for County Ladies and Gentlemen, for the theatre took on a new identity as 'The Electric Theatre' and continued to play an important part in the development of cinema. The 'Auld Hippie' or 'The Scratch' as it was affectionately known succumbed to the competition of television and closed in October 1954. Acquisition of the theatre by the Guild of Players in 1959, at a time when demolition seemed a likely prospect, was followed by an eighteen-month period of reconstruction and a formal opening by Sir Compton Mackenzie, whose mother's company, \\"The Compton Comedy Company\\" had been the last of the touring troupes to perform there. The first Guild production mounted in the theatre in October 1960 was \\"What Every woman Knows\\" by J.M. Barrie. The theatre has been further renovated and extended in the 21st century, with the help of a grant from The Holywood Trust, and reopened in December 2015. Programme In addition to the Guild's own annual programme of five plays and the Christmas pantomime, it hosts productions by Dumfries Musical and Operatic Society and the Junior Guild as well as professional touring companies, among them Scottish Opera and Scottish Ballet.

It originally aired on the American Broadcast Company (ABC) on May 4, 2011. The episode was written by Dan O'Shannon & Ilana Wernick and was directed by Michael Spiller. In the episode, Claire and Gloria's Mother's Day excursion outdoors with the kids turns into the mother of all disasters. Meanwhile, Phil and Jay share an awkward moment after Jay finds a letter he wrote to his mom on a past Mother's Day when they stay home to prepare dinner for everyone; and Mitchell attempts to show his appreciation for Cameron by bringing him breakfast in bed on Mother's Day, causing Cameron to worry about the gender roles in his relationship with Mitchell. \\"Mother's Day\\" received positive reviews from critics with Alan Sepinwall, who is usually critical of the series, calling Ed O'Neill's performance \\"terrific\\". The episode also marked a rise in the ratings from the previous episode, \\"Someone to Watch Over Lily\\". The episode also ranked as the highest-rated scripted program on Wednesday. Plot Claire (Julie Bowen) and Gloria (Sof√≠a Vergara) want to spend this year's Mother's Day outdoors hiking with the kids, but the bickering and complaining drives Claire and Gloria to the edge. Both of them can not hear them complaining anymore, so they leave them back waiting for the two of them to finish their hiking and then go back home. While they are hiking, Claire convinces Gloria to admit that even Manny (Rico Rodriguez) drives her crazy sometimes. Gloria says that sometimes she needs her own space and that Manny should go out and play with other kids. She also says that Manny's poetry is not that good, something that Manny overhears since he followed them on the hiking. Manny gets upset and Gloria tries to make things right. In the meantime, Haley (Sarah Hyland), Alex (Ariel Winter) and Luke (Nolan Gould) while they are waiting for the others to come back, they realize that Claire is always trying to make them feel guilty as a way to apologize to her. They decide that this time they will not do it because if they do, they will let her win once again. Meanwhile, Phil (Ty Burrell) and Jay (Ed O'Neill) stay home to cook a nice dinner for the family. They are making a special recipe that Jay's mom used to make. Things get really awkward when Phil finds a poem Jay wrote for his mom when he was nine years old and when he reads it out loud he witnesses an unexpected emotional reaction from Jay. In the Tucker- Pritchett house, Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) attempts to show his appreciation for Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) by bringing him breakfast in bed on Mother's Day, causing Cameron to worry about the gender roles in his relationship with Mitchell. Things get worse when later, while visiting the park, all the other families treat Cameron as him being the mother of Lily as well. At the end of the episode, the whole family gathers for the special dinner Jay and Phil prepared. Phil tells everyone that Jay cried while they were cooking because he remembered his mom, something that makes Jay mad and denies that he was crying. During the dinner though, while Jay is trying to tell a story about his mom, he starts crying again and everyone comes to hug him. Haley and Alex, seeing Jay crying, apologize to Claire for destroying her special day. Production \\"Mother's Day\\" was written by Dan O'Shannon and Ilana Wernick, marking the former's sixth writing credit and the latter's fourth writing credit. The episode was also directed by Michael Spiller, his fourteenth credit for the series. \\"Mother's Day\\" featured guest appearances from Jean Villepique as Jennifer and Todd Weeks as Roy, Mitchell and Cameron's friends. Following the episode's airdate, ABC allowed fans to make a personalized Mother's Day E-card. Modern Family co-creator Steven Levitan called the episode \\"one of our best this season\\" on Twitter.

Reception=Ratings In its original American broadcast, \\"Mother's Day\\" was viewed by an estimated 9.90 million households and received a 3.9 rating/10% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 3.9% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 10% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This marked a slight rise in the ratings from the previous episode, \\"Someone to Watch Over Lily\\". \\"Mother's Day\\" was the most-watched scripted show for the week of broadcast among adults aged 18‚Äì49, and the twenty-first most-watched show among all viewers. Reviews The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics. The A.V. Club writer Joshua Alston called the episode \\"darn good 'Mother's Day' overall\\". He mainly praised the writers for changing Phil and Jay's relationship, calling it \\"a welcome change.\\" He ultimately gave the episode a B+. Aly Semigran of Entertainment Weekly called the episode \\"funny and touching\\", writing that \\"This may not go down as one of the all- time greats of Modern Family, but a satisfying episode it most certainly was.\\" Meredith Blake of The Los Angeles Times praised the writers on changing the Mitchell and Cameron's storyline, commenting, \\"I'm happy that this week, Modern Family delivered a Cameron-Mitchell storyline that was insightful, funny and maybe even a little brave.\\". TV Squad writer Joel Keller gave the episode a mostly positive review, but criticized the episode for not reaching its potential. He wrote: \\"it's one of those things that's hard to put a finger on; it could be that most of the plots were a series of funny events in search of an ending, but it was mostly because they simply weren't as funny as they could be.\\" HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall wrote that while the episode didn't live up to the previous episode, praised Jay's outburst at the dinner table and the writers for playing the other plots of it and called O'Neill's performance \\"terrific\\". Christine N. Ziemba of Paste wrote that while \\"Modern Family had some great one-liners in this episode\\" she concluded that \\"with such a loaded and promising premise, ‚ÄúMother‚Äôs Day‚Äù was brought down a notch by a hiking storyline that was dead before reaching the trailhead.\\" She ultimately gave it a 7.1/10 calling it \\"respectable\\".

The following month, Sun Quan's general Zhou Yu led an attack on Jiangling (Ê±üÈôµ; located in present-day Jingjiang ËçÜÊ±ü, not to be confused with Jiangling County, Hubei), which was defended by Cao Cao's cousin Cao Ren.

Sun Quan heeded Zhang Hong's advice and aborted his plan. As Hefei had been constantly under attack for several months, compounded by heavy rain, the fortress' walls were starting to collapse, so Liu Fu ordered his men to use straw and palm leaves to cover up cracks in the walls. At night, Liu Fu had torches lit to brighten the scene outside Hefei, so he could observe the enemy's movements and prepare defences. Zhang Xi's relief force had yet to arrive, and Liu Fu was at a loss on how to resist the enemy. Liu Fu's deputy Jiang Ji suggested using a strategy to deceive the enemy that Hefei's reinforcements had arrived: spread false news that Zhang Xi's 40,000 strong relief army had reached Yulou (); send an official to pretend to receive Zhang Xi; send three officers to bring fake letters out of Hefei. Only one of the three officers returned to the fortress as the other two were captured by Sun Quan's men, who found the letters on them. Sun Quan read the letters and thought that Zhang Xi's reinforcements had indeed arrived, so he ordered his troops to burn down the camp and hastily retreat.

In Romance of the Three Kingdoms In chapter 53 of the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Sun Quan's general Taishi Ci was killed in the battle. Taishi Ci proposed a strategy involving a man named Ge Ding (), who was from the same hometown as him. Ge Ding and a defector from Hefei would assassinate Zhang Liao (Cao Cao's general who was defending Hefei) and open the city gates for Sun Quan's army. That night, Ge Ding and the defector started a fire in the city to create chaos, but they were caught and executed. Zhang Liao recognised the enemy's plot and decided to turn it against them, so he set up an ambush and opened the gates to lure the enemy in. Outside Hefei, Taishi Ci saw the fire and thought that it was a signal from Ge Ding, indicating that he had succeeded and opened the gates for him. Taishi Ci charged into the city, but fell into the ambush and was hit by several arrows. At that moment, enemy forces led by Li Dian and Yue Jin attacked Taishi Ci from behind. Taishi Ci narrowly escaped under the protection of Dong Xi, but later died from his wounds in camp at the age of 41. ;Historicity No details on Taishi Ci's death were provided in historical records.

The two contending sides were fighting for control over a strategic fortress at Hefei, which was defended by Cao Cao's general Zhang Liao. Towards the end of the campaign, Zhang Liao made use of force concentration and launched a sneak counteroffensive on Sun Quan at Leisure Ford, where Sun only had 1,000 soldiers with him at the time. Amidst the chaos, Sun Quan barely escaped capture with the aid of his general Ling Tong. This action raised Zhang Liao to primacy among Cao Cao's generals. Background Long before Sun Quan solidified his control over southeastern China, Cao Cao had appointed Liu Fu as the Inspector of Yang Province, and had him build fortifications against besiegers. Liu Fu oversaw the construction of Hefei fortress (), stocked with boulders, logs, and reserves of fish oil. In late 208 after the Battle of Red Cliffs, Sun Quan led an army to invade Hefei but was unsuccessful despite several months of progress. The following year, the local parvenus and two former subordinates of Yuan Shu and Liu Fu, Chen Lan () and Mei Cheng (), rebelled in Lujiang () after the death of Liu Fu (whom they trusted), but the revolt was suppressed by Cao Cao's generals Zhang Liao and Zang Ba. Cao Cao then ordered Zhang Liao, Yue Jin and Li Dian to lead 7,000 troops to enter Hefei fortress, Xiahou Dun to lead 26 juns (325,000 men) to prepare for probable attacks, and Xiahou Yuan to handle logistics. Chen Lan's ally, Lei Bo (), surrendered to another warlord Liu Bei. In 213 Cao Cao brought with him a 400,000 strong army to attack Sun Quan's 70,000 men at Ruxukou (), but victory eluded him for more than a month, and he was forced on the defensive. After his repeated failures against the southerners, Cao Cao was worried that the various counties along the Yangtze River would be taken by Sun Quan, so he adopted a Fabian strategy and started to form military communities, families of soldiers concentrated in fortified towns. The Yangtze region became depopulated as residents were relocated except for Wan County (ÁöñÁ∏£; present-day Qianshan County, Anhui), which was situated south of Hefei. Cao Cao appointed Zhu Guang () as Administrator of Lujiang and garrisoned him at Wan County, promoting agriculture and bribing wealthy locals in Poyang () to spy on Sun Quan's forces and harass the enemy's rear. The campaign=Battle of Wan County Around June or July 214, Sun Quan took advantage of heavy rains and floods in the Huai River region to sail up the Yangtze and attack Wan County (), which served as a billet and storehouse for Zhang Liao's and Xiahou Dun's armies. Sun Quan faced two options: to build siege engines, or attack right away with foot soldiers. L√º Meng suggested the latter option and recommended Gan Ning to lead the offensive. Upon knowing Sun Quan had arrived on the battlefield, Zhang Liao moved out of Hefei fortress to reinforce Wan County. However, Sun Quan's energetic troops took Wan County within a day, and Zhu Guang was captured along with his advisor Dong He (). By the time Zhang Liao reached Jiashi (), he received news of the fall of Wan County and withdrew to Hefei. Around this time, Liu Bei had taken over Yi Province (covering present- day Sichuan and Chongqing) from Liu Zhang, so Sun Quan sent Zhuge Jin to demand from Liu Bei the return of Jing Province. Liu Bei refused, and Guan Yu also drove away the officials Sun Quan sent to three commanderies in southern Jing Province. Sun Quan then withdrew his elite generals from the northern frontier and ordered L√º Meng and Ling Tong to lead 20,000 troops to take the three commanderies of Jing Province, while sending Lu Su to lead 10,000 men to garrison at Baqiu () to resist Guan Yu, while he personally stationed at Lukou () to serve as backup. Liu Bei also led his army to Gong'an () and sent Guan Yu with 30,000 men to Yiyang (). L√º Meng and Ling Tong took three commanderies by strategy and led their men with Sun Jiao and Pan Zhang to support Lu Su at Yiyang. Taking advantage of the Liu-Sun conflict, Cao Cao led an army to attack Zhang Lu of Hanzhong. Liu Bei was afraid that if Hanzhong fell to Cao Cao, Yi Province would be in peril as Hanzhong was the \\"gateway\\" to Yi Province. Hence, Liu Bei made peace with Sun Quan by dividing southern Jing Province. In return, Sun Quan promised to divert Cao Cao's attention from the west by attacking Hefei fortress. An unorthodox order The force at Hefei was outnumbered because Xiahou Dun's force was stationed at Juchao (Â±ÖÂ∑¢; in present-day Chaohu, Anhui) and it would take time for help to arrive. Only 7000 men were at the fortress. Before Cao Cao left to attack Zhang Lu, he left his representative Xue Ti () with a letter that read \\"Open when the enemy arrives\\" on the envelope.(Ë≥äËá≥‰πÉÁôº) Chen Shou. Records of Three Kingdoms, Volume 17, Biography of Zhang Liao.

Battle around the fortress The following morning, Zhang Liao led the 800 soldiers on a charge targeting Sun Quan's forces as they set up camp unafraid of Zhang Liao's small detachment. Xu Sheng and Song Qian in the front were routed after a brief skirmish, with Xu Sheng was wounded and disarmed, and Zhang Liao penetrated the camp. After personally killing tens of enemy soldiers and two officers, he cried out, \\"Zhang Liao is here!\\" Chen Wu, the commander of Sun Quan's bodyguards, went out to meet Zhang Liao's challenge. However, Chen Wu's unit was no match for Zhang Liao's and he was killed. Sun Quan was shocked by Zhang Liao's onslaught, and Xu Sheng and Song Qian's troops turned tail when they saw their commanders being killed or fleeing, and Pan Zhang killed two deserters.(ÁíãË∫´Ê¨°Âú®ÂæåÔºå‰æøÈ¶≥ÈÄ≤ÔºåÊ©´È¶¨Êñ¨Ë¨ô„ÄÅÁõõÂÖµËµ∞ËÄÖ‰∫å‰∫∫ÔºåÂÖµÁöÜÈÇÑÊà∞„ÄÇ) Chen Shou.

Ling Tong, just arrived on the field, led Sun Quan to a hill and ordered his men to use the long jis to a form a defensive line before he went down to fight Zhang Liao. At the bottom of the hill, Zhang Liao shouted for Sun Quan to come down and fight him, but Sun did not dare to move. When Sun Quan saw that the situation had become more stable and Zhang Liao was only left with slightly more than a hundred men, he ordered He Qi to surround Zhang Liao's men. During the battle He Qi retrieved Xu Sheng's personal mao (Áüõ, a 5m long spear).(ÊôÇÂüé‰∏≠Âá∫Êà∞ÔºåÂæêÁõõË¢´ÂâµÂ§±ÁüõÔºåÈΩäÂºïÂÖµÊãíÊìäÔºåÂæóÁõõÊâÄÂ§±„ÄÇ) Chen Shou.

Zhang Liao plowed back through enemy ranks and rescued his men. Sun Quan's men were stunned by Zhang Liao's valour and did not dare to stand in his way. After the engagement, Pan Zhang was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General while Ling Tong was appointed as Right Commander, but the long morning's battle had crushed the morale of Sun Quan's troops. Zhang Liao brought his survivors back to the city and fortified his defences. Zhang Liao's victory boosted his men's fighting spirits and reassured the defenders. When Sun Quan's forces had all gathered, they launched an assault on the city. However, Hefei's defenses, prepared by Liu Fu, were not easy to breach. After several days, Sun Quan was still unable to take the city, when a plague broke out in his army, forcing Sun Quan to withdraw. Battle at Xiaoyao Ford In order to avoid being infected with the plague, Sun Quan ordered the rest of his units to retreat first while his guards, numbering only about 1,000, were the last to move.(ÊúÉÁñ´ÁñæÔºåËªçÊóÖÁöÜÂ∑≤ÂºïÂá∫ÔºåÂîØËªä‰∏ãËôéÂ£´ÂçÉÈ§ò‰∫∫„ÄÇ). Chen Shou. Records of Three Kingdoms, Volume 55, Biography of Gan Ning. Zhang Liao, watching closely, seized this moment to counterattack, when Sun Quan had the fewest troops. He waited until Sun Quan's army had reached the northern crossing of Xiaoyao Ford when he, Li Dian, and Yue Jin led all their forces out of Hefei for an all-out assault. When Sun Quan saw that the advancing attack, he realised his danger and hurriedly recalled his retreating units, but they could not return in time from the ships. As the 1,000 men of Sun Quan were engulfed by Zhang Liao's veteran cavalry, Ling Tong led a relief force of 300 horsemen to pierce the encirclement, keeping the enemy from Sun Quan and mauling Zhang Liao's army.Chen Shou. Records of Three Kingdoms, Volume 55, Biography of Ling Tong. As Sun Quan's side was in confusion and battle signals were not given, Gan Ning drummed the other units to action, while he personally shot arrows at the enemy.Chen Shou. Records of Three Kingdoms, Volume 55, Biography of Gan Ning. As soon as Ling Tong dragged Sun Quan from the thick of the fight, he urged Sun to leave the battlefield while he stayed behind to cover his lord's escape. Sun Quan hurried to the southern shore until he reached the crossing at Xiaoyao Ford, but the bridge had been destroyed, leaving a nearly 10 metre- long gap. Gu Li, Sun Quan's attendant, told his master to sit tight, grab the reins firmly. Gu Li whipped the horse's flanks, and it made a mighty leap across to the southern side.Chen Shou. Records of Three Kingdoms, Volume 47, Biography of Sun Quan. Ling Tong turned back to hold off the enemy after seeing Sun Quan to safety. On the northern shore, Ling Tong gave all for his lord's cause, fighting until all his 300 men had died and the other units had retreated. Zhang Liao and Li Dian wounded him. Knowing Sun Quan was safety away by this time, Ling Tong finally attempted to fight his way out. He single-handedly killed dozens of enemy horsemen blocking his way, and succeeded in breaking out, only to find all the roads blockaded. As the enemy closed in, Ling Tong quickly dove into the water before discarding his armour.(Áµ±Âæ©ÈÇÑÊà∞ÔºåÂ∑¶Âè≥Áõ°Ê≠ªÔºåË∫´‰∫¶Ë¢´ÂâµÔºåÊâÄÊÆ∫Êï∏ÂçÅ‰∫∫ÔºåÂ∫¶Ê¨äÂ∑≤ÂÖçÔºå‰πÉÈÇÑ„ÄÇÊ©ãÊïóË∑ØÁµïÔºåÁµ±Ë¢´Áî≤ÊΩõË°å„ÄÇ) Chen Shou.

By that time, Sun Quan had already boarded a boat, and he delightedly rescued his general from the water, rejoicing in this miraculous reunion, but Ling Tong wept at the death of all his close aides. Sun Quan comforted him, saying, \\"Gongji (Ling Tong's courtesy name), let the dead go.

Sun Quan later put Ling Tong in command of twice his previous force. Aftermath During a banquet hosted by Sun Quan after the battle, He Qi wept and said, \\"My lord, as a leader of men, you should be prudent. Today we were almost wiped out and the men are in shock. I hope you will learn from this lesson.\\" Sun Quan thanked He Qi for his advice and promised to remember it for life. When the battle was over, Zhang Liao, Li Dian, and Yue Jin lingered on the battlefield hoping to find Sun Quan's body. They were not aware that Sun Quan had already escaped until Zhang Liao asked a captive soldier, \\"Who was that purple-bearded, long-bodied, short-legged man so skilled in mounted archery?\\" The soldier replied it was Sun Quan. Zhang Liao then told Yue Jin that he regretted not chasing after this purple-bearded fighter, for he could have caught him. When the news reached Cao Cao, he could hardly believe what his officers had achieved, so he later travelled to Leisure Ford to scrutinize the battlefield.(Â§™Á•ñÂ§çÂæÅÂ≠ôÊùÉÔºåÂà∞ÂêàËÇ•ÔºåÂæ™Ë°åËæΩÊàòÂ§ÑÔºåÂèπÊÅØËÄÖËâØ‰πÖ„ÄÇ) Chen Shou.

Background Around March 234, Shu Han's chancellor Zhuge Liang launched a Northern Expedition against Wei for the fifth time. Shu requested assistance from its ally, Wu, to attack Wei together, and the Wu emperor Sun Quan agreed. The battle Around June or July, Sun Quan's army, claimed to be 100,000 strong, garrisoned near Chao Lake. Sun Quan personally led his troops to attack Wei's fortress at Xincheng (Êñ∞Âüé; literally: \\"new city/fortress\\"), Hefei. On the other hand, he also sent his generals Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin to garrison at Jiangxia () and Miankou (), and they would attack Xiangyang from there. A third Wu army, led by Sun Shao and Zhang Cheng advanced towards Guangling () and Huaiyin (). In total, Wu was attacking Wei from three directions. In July or early August, the Wei general Man Chong wanted to lead reinforcements to support Zhang Ying (), who was in charge of defending Xincheng. However, Tian Yu opposed Man Chong's idea, as he thought that Xincheng's defences were adequate, and was worried that the Wu army might turn around to attack the Wei relief force. At that time, many Wei military personnel were on leave, so Man Chong requested for them to be recalled back, and gather them to resist the enemy. The Wei emperor Cao Rui disagreed with Man Chong's view, as he felt that Hefei, Xiangyang, and Mount Qi () were the three most important positions on Wei's eastern, southern and western borders respectively, so they already had sufficient defences. Liu Shao felt that Man Chong should focus on defending instead of attacking, because of the Wu forces' high morale; the Wei court would first send 5,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry to relieve Xincheng, and the troops should be spaced further apart, with more flags, banners, and war drums added, so as to create an impression of a large army. Liu Shao predicted that the Wu forces would retreat upon seeing the arrival of this \\"large army\\". The Wei emperor Cao Rui approved Liu Shao's strategy and despatched the suggested relief force. In August or early September, Cao Rui personally led a naval fleet east to lift the siege on Xincheng. Man Chong recruited several men to set fire to the Wu army's siege engines, and Sun Quan's nephew Sun Tai () was killed in the battle. At that time, many Wu soldiers were ill and Sun Quan decided to withdraw his troops when he learnt that Cao Rui's army was approaching. Sun Shao and Zhang Cheng also pulled back their forces when they heard that Sun Quan had withdrawn, while Lu Xun pressed on the attack at Xiangyang for some time but also retreated later.

Ignoring the advice of several officials, in April 253, Zhuge Ke led a 200,000 strong army to attack Wei in the north. By May or early June, Zhuge Ke and his army had reached south of the Huai River, and started attacking the Wei fortress Xincheng (Êñ∞Âüé; literally \\"new city/fortress\\") at Hefei in the following month.

After finishing his speech, Zhang Te tossed his tally to Zhuge Ke, who did not take the tally as he believed that Zhang Te would keep his word. That night, Zhang Te ordered his men to tear down houses and fences, and use the wood to reinforce damaged parts of the fortress walls.

The Wu soldiers were furious and attacked the fortress but were unable to breach the walls. At that time, the weather was extremely hot and the Wu troops were growing weary. A plague broke out and killed many Wu soldiers as well as caused more than half of the Wu army to fall ill. Zhuge Ke grew impatient and vented his frustration on his subordinates, causing much unhappiness among his men. He even dismissed his subordinate, Zhu Yi. Later, the Wei general Sima Fu led 200,000 troops to reinforce Zhang Te at Xincheng and defeated the exhausted Wu army. Sometime between 12 August and 9 September 253, Zhuge Ke had no choice but to order a withdrawal and the siege on Xincheng was lifted.  Aftermath  As Zhuge Ke and the Wu army withdrew from Xincheng, many of the sick and wounded soldiers died along the way or were taken prisoner by Sima Fu and his reinforcements. Zhuge Ke showed no concern towards them. At Xunyang, Zhuge Ke halted and made plans to create an agricultural colony. The Wu emperor Sun Liang sent several edicts recalling Zhuge Ke and his army to the capital. Slowly, Zhuge Ke sent the soldiers home. After this, popular opinion turned sharply against Zhuge Ke, as the resentment of the widowed, orphaned and maimed far outweighing the goodwill Zhuge Ke had earned with his economic reforms in 252.Xu Zizhi Tongjian Changbian Shibu vol. 5. 15 years later, the Wu emperor Sun Hao ordered the general Ding Feng to lead an army to attack Hefei again.

Nishapur retained its importance under the Seljuqs, after its occupation by the first sultan of the Turkic dynasty in 1037. It was sacked by the Oghuz in 1154,Ibn Al-Athir, The Chronicle of Ibn Al-Athir for the Crusading Period from Al-Kamil Fi'l-Tarikh, transl. D.S. Richards, (Ashgate Publishing, 2007), 59-60. and damaged in a series of earthquakes in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, yet it remained an active urban centre until its destruction by the Mongols in 1221. During the Sasanian dynasty and medieval ages, the Nishapur quarter (Persian: ÿ±ÿ®ÿπ ŸÜ€åÿ¥ÿßÿ®Ÿàÿ±) included Khorasan Province and Ahal Province.  Shapur I, founder of Nishapur  Archaeologists and historians disagree about the Sassanid Empire and Shapur I's role in developing Nishapur.  Abarshahr of Sassanid Empire  Abarshahr was a satrapy (province) of the Sassanid Empire. Cities in the region were Candac, Artacauan, Apameia, and Pushang (founded by Shapur I). Nishapur was the capital. Abarshar was the name used for Nishapur during the Sassanid Empire and Rashidun Caliphate. The capital was a vital center of administration and of communications between Bactria, India, and Sagistan. The region was involved in the Indian and Chinese trade. Its governor bore the title of kanarang.The Cambridge History of Iran, vol. 3(2): The Seleucid, Parthian, and Sasanian Periods, ed. Ehsan Yarshater (NY: Cambridge UP, 1983), 769.  Muslim Conquest  Nishapur was conquered by the Muslims, without struggle, during the caliphate of Umar. The Caliph appointed Ahnaf Ibn Qais as the chief command of the Muslim army out of Isfahan. From Isfahan, two routes led to Khorasan: the main route via Rayy and the other via Nishapur. The people of Nishapur chose not to fight and surrendered on the condition of paying a tribute. Having conquered the region around Nishapur, the Muslim force advanced to Nishapur itself. The city was divided into four sectors, with each sector under a Persian chief. These chiefs shut themselves in the city and closed the gates. The Muslims laid siege to the city for some days. In the meantime, the Persian chiefs quarreled among themselves. One of the chiefs entered into negotiations with the Muslims. He offered to open one of the gates for the Muslim army to enter, provided he was granted immunity. The Muslims accepted the offer. The Persians were taken by surprise, and the Muslims became the masters of Nishapur. After consolidating their position at Nishapur, the Muslims conquered other cities around Nishapur, including Pusht, Ashband, Rukh, Zar, Khaf, Osparain and Arghian.The city in the Islamic world, Volume 1, ed. Salma Khadra Jayyusi, Renata Holod, Attilio Petruccioli, Andr√© Raymond  Nishapur capital of Abu Muslim  Abu Muslim was confirmed as governor of Khorasan, and made Nishapur the capital. He seems to have initiated a huge building programme which stimulated the growth of the city. Nishapur increased in importance, and two ‚ÄòAbbasids were governors here before becoming caliphs. It was the governor of Khurasan (‚ÄòAli ibn Isa ibn Mahan) who presented the large gift of Chinese imperial porcelains to Harun al-Rashid (see Abbasid Ceramics Section), demonstrating the strategic importance of the province on trade routes.Goldschmidt, Arthur (2002), A concise history of the Middle East, Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press, pp. 76‚Äì77,  Tahirid Dynasty in Nishapur  The Tahirid Dynasty was an Iranian Persian dynasty that ruled from 820 to 872 in Khorasan, northeastern Greater Iran, a region now split between Iran, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The Tahirid capital was originally Merv but was moved to Nishapur. The Tahirid dynasty is considered to be the first dynasty independent of the Abbasid caliphate established in Khorasan. Although nominally subject to the Abbasid caliphate in Baghdad, the Tahirid rulers were effectively independent. The dynasty was founded by Tahir ibn Husayn, a leading general in the service of the Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun. Tahir's military victories were rewarded with the gift of lands in the east of Persia, which were subsequently extended by his successors as far as the borders of India. Tahirid influence extended to Baghdad when the Abbasids granted them the military affairs in Mesopotamia.Hammuda, Abdul Hamid, H. The History of Independent Islamic States:Tarikh Adduwal Al-Islamiyyah Al-Mustaqillah, al-Dar al-Thaqafiyyah lil- Nashr, Cairo, 2010, p.30-40.  Saffarids  In 872, the Tahirids were replaced by the Saffarids who expanded their sphere of influence north into Khurasan, from Sistan in the south. They also made Nishapur their capital and rebuilt the Tahirid palace, only to be overrun early in the tenth century by their powerful eastern neighbours, the Samanids. This dynasty had been placed in power in Transoxiana by Caliph Al-Ma'mun, and ruled first from Samarqand and then moved to Bukhara. After defeating the Saffarids, their \\"empire\\", with nominal sanction from the Abbasids, extended from India to Iraq. Khurasan was thus an international entrep√¥t, with merchants coming not only from Iraq, India and Egypt, but also from Russia; additionally, Vikings came from Scandinavia to trade with the Bulghars and Khazars on the Caspian Sea.  Nishapur under the Mongols  In 1221, during the Mongol conquests, Nishapur was besieged and sacked, and a great number of its inhabitants killed and beheaded. Their skulls were reputedly piled in pyramids by the Mongols. After the massacre a much smaller settlement was established just north of the ancient town, and the once bustling metropolis lay underground‚Äîuntil a team of excavators from the Metropolitan Museum of Art arrived in the mid-20th century. They worked at Nishapur between 1935 and 1940, returning for a final season in the winter of 1947‚Äì48.http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/nish/hd_nish.htm  Thematic history = Names of Nishapur throughout history  *Abarshahr or Aparshahr was a satrapy (province) of the Sassanid Empire now located in Nishapur. Cities in the region were Candac, Artacauan, and Apameia, and Pushang (founded by Shapur I) and the capital was Nishapur. Abarshar was the name of Nishapur during the Sassanid Empire and the Rashidun Caliphate. The capital was a vital point of administration and of communications between Bactria, India, and Sagistan. The region was involved in the Indian and Chinese trade. Its governor bore the unique title of kanarang.The Cambridge History of Iran, vol. 3(2): The Seleucid, Parthian, and Sasanian Periods, ed. Ehsan Yarshater (NY: Cambridge UP, 1983), 769. *Neysabur or Naysabur was named Abarshahr during the Muslim occupation of Khorasan and Nishapur, and was the city's official name during the Rashidun Caliphate, Umayyad Caliphate, and Abbasid Caliphate.  In travel literature  Nasir Khusraw saw Nishapur and wrote about it in Safarnama. Abraham Valentine Williams Jackson in \\"From Constantinople to the home of Omar Khayyam\\" explain ending of his Travel in Nishapur.  Art of Nishapur = Ceramics  Bowls including bold black inscriptions in the so-called kufic angular calligraphy were apparently produced in the important ceramic centers of Nishapur in eastern Iran, and Afrasiyab, or Old Samarqand, in present-day Uzbekistan. The text often contains a proverb in Arabic or, as in this case, a series of wishes: \\"Blessing, happiness, prosperity, good health, and success.\\"  References  Sources  * Tarkhi Al Naisaburiin Bye Hakim al-Nishaburi * EARTHQUAKES IN THE HISTORY OF NISHAPUR By Charles Melville * Encyclopedia Iranica * metmuseum * iranica * The Patricians of Nishapur: A Study in Medieval Islamic Social History by Richard Bulliet * France-Diplomatie ","title":"History of Nishapur"},{"id":"31576012","text":"Tha Khao Plueak () is a village and tambon (subdistrict) of Mae Chan District, in Chiang Rai Province, Thailand.Thaitambon.com, Accessed April 23, 2011 In 2005 it had a population of 7,510 people.

Rights of LGBT Sexual intercourse between consenting adult females is legal in northern Cyprus.State-sponsored Homophobia, A world survey of laws prohibiting same sex activity between consenting adults, by Daniel Ottoson , The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, May 2010. Male homosexuality was still criminalised in northern Cyprus until January 2014, while anti-homosexuality legislation formerly in effect in the Republic of Cyprus was repealed following a 1993 ruling by the European Court of Human Rights (Modinos v. Cyprus). On 27 January 2014 Turkish Cypriot deputies passed an amendment repealing a colonial-era law that punished homosexual acts with up to five years in prison by a new Criminal Code. It was the last territory in Europe to decriminalise sexual relations between consenting, adult men. In response to the vote, Paulo Corte-Real from the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, a rights advocacy group said that \\"We welcome today's vote and can finally call Europe a continent completely free from laws criminalising homosexuality\\". Rights of minorities In 2008, a synagogue was opened in Kyrenia for the small Jewish community in Northern Cyprus which mostly comprises non-resident businesspersons. There have been no reported Anti-Semitic attacks. Rights of women The law of Northern Cyprus prohibits domestic violence under a general assault/violence/battery clause in the criminal code, although a separate domestic violence legislation has not yet been passed in Northern Cyprus.Cyprus Human Rights Practices, 1995: Discrimination Based on Race, Sex, Religion, Disability, Language, or Social Status Hellenic Resources network, U.S. Department of State, March 1996. In January 2009, the Turkish Cypriot Human Rights Foundation, noted that women do not have equal rights as men, nor do they live in similar conditions as men, especially when married. Women are prevented from enjoying their rights by the patriarchal society. A US Department of State report in 2010 indicated that although authorities handled and prosecuted rape cases effectively, violence against women was an issue and there were no NGOs to support victims of rape.  History = Issues pertaining to the Cyprus problem  In 2001, the US Department of State said that Greek Cypriot and Maronite minorities are not treated as well as they should be. However, another US Department of State report in 2002 reported that the government of Northern Cyprus was easing restrictions on minorities and it respected the rights of travelling abroad and emigrating. In April 1998, the United Kingdom-based National Coalition of Anti-Deportation Campaigns asserted that the Turkish army had carried out a forced migration policy where Kurds were forced to colonise Northern Cyprus from the Republic of Turkey, and The Immigration and Nationality Directorate of the United Kingdom in 1999 said that Kurds were not being discriminated against and enjoyed equal political and religious rights to others.

The ECHR also highlighted, amongst other violations, the following two that were directly relevant to the right to education, where the second summarily describes what Rizokarpaso primary school teachers (and their families) were subjected to: > \\"... violation of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1 (right to education) in > respect of Greek Cypriots living in northern Cyprus in so far as no > appropriate secondary-school facilities were available to them; ... > violation of Article 3 in that the Greek Cypriots living in the Karpas area > of northern Cyprus had been subjected to discrimination amounting to > degrading treatment;\\" Moreover, the ECHR noted the censorship of school books and the denial of secondary school education to the enclaved. The ECHR called on the Turkish authorities to stop censoring Greek language textbooks and informed them that the closure of Greek-language schools was a denial of the right to education. In 2003, the Ministry of Education and Culture of the Republic of Cyprus noted in its report that the primary school at Rizokarpasso was the only Greek Cypriot primary school in Northern Cyprus and that it had three teachers and twenty-five students.The Cyprus Educational System, Primary Education , Ministry of Education and Culture, Nicosia, 2003. On 1 September 2003, at the European Parliament, in Strasbourg, during \\"One minute speeches on matters of political importance\\", two European MEPs raised their concern about the expulsion, by local authorities, of two Rizokarpaso Primary School teachers (Alexia and Grigoris Koukotsikas) together with their children.One-minute speeches on matters of political importance, MEP Tsatsos, European Parliament, Strasbourg, 1 September 2003. The restrictions of the enclaved were highlighted in an earlier report, by the United Nations: > \\"... the U.N. Secretary-General in his report on December 1995 stated that > Greek Cypriots and Maronites in the occupied area were \\"the object of very > severe restrictions which curtailed the exercise of many basic freedoms and > had the effect of ensuring that, inexorably with the passage of time these > communities would cease to exist in the northern part of the > island.\\"Continuing concern for the enclaved Greek Cypriots in the occupied > areas , United Nations, 11 March 1999. > \\"The Secretary-General, in his report to the Security Council dated 30 > November 1991 (S/24050), stated: \\"... on a number of occasions UNFICYP was > impeded ... while conducting humanitarian tasks in support of Greek Cypriots > in the north. Access to the Greek Cypriots living in the Karpas peninsula by > UNFICYP humanitarian staff and civilian police was on several occasions > denied ... uninterrupted freedom of movement in carrying out its established > and important humanitarian duties and responsibilities\\" ...\\"  Views of the Republic of Cyprus  The Republic of Cyprus claimed in a 1994 report that the rights of enclaved Greek Cypriots were being violated. The report featured claims of denial of Greek Cypriot doctors' rights to settle in the area or regularly visit it, restrictions on the movement of the UN peacekeeping forces, alleged requirements of an application of the enclaved to move outside their villages and to report to a police station weekly, being made to clean the station and the adjacent areas. It claimed that these were part of \\"a persistent policy of harassment, racial discrimination, intimidation and coercion\\". The report also drew attention to the distribution of Greek Cypriot property by the Turkish Cypriot authorities as a violation of the right to property, and the continued prevention of 200,000 displaced Greek Cypriots to return to their property.Consideration of Reports Submitted by States Parties under Article 9 of the Convention, United Nations, International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Segregation (CERD), 5 May 1994. Other issues The constant focus on the division of the island sometimes masks other human rights issues. Prostitution is rife, and the island has been criticized for its role in the sex trade as one of the main routes of human trafficking from Eastern Europe. In January 2009, the Turkish Cypriot Human Rights Foundation noted concerns about human trafficking: > \\"Trafficking in persons is a major visible area of human rights violations > in North Cyprus which is a destination country for trafficked women from > countries such as Ukraine, Moldova and Russia.

It lies in Hamford Water and is part of the Hamford Water National Nature Reserve, managed by Natural England Permission is required to visit. Geography At high tide The western section of the island contains a freshwater pool surrounded by trees. At one point boats could moor here, but this is now discouraged. There are a number of oyster beds along here and the north edge of the island. In the centre of the island are a number of farm buildings. In the 19th century, a large section of land was reclaimed, with a number of sea walls constructed. Along with extensive saltings surrounding the island, this offered partial protection against flooding. At this time, Horsey Island partially connected to the neighbouring Hedge End Island; this was part of a plan to completely join the two islands together that was never completed owing to financial difficulties. The island is linked to the mainland by a causeway across a stretch of water known as the Wade, leading from the nearest village, Kirby- le-Soken, that can be walked with care at low tide. It is one of 43 (unbridged) tidal islands that can be walked to from the mainland of Great Britain.Peter Caton, No Boat Required ‚Äì Exploring Tidal Islands, 2011. Settlements The earliest known record of Horsey Island dates from 1212, when it was known as \\"Horse Hey\\". It has been intermittently inhabited, with evidence of buildings dating back to 1536 and appearing on a map in 1594 as Horsey Illande. The local geography has meant Horsey Island has been regularly susceptible to flooding, including severe floods in 1691, 1896, 1949 and the North Sea flood of 1953. The 19th-century sea wall was destroyed by floods around 1897, and the surrounding land was abandoned. The Wade was repaired after the 1953 flood. The farm is still in active use, thus making it one of the most easterly inhabited islands in Britain, a claim sometimes attributed to the more built-up Mersea Island further west. It remains privately owned. Cultural references The island features in Arthur Ransome's children's novel Secret Water as \\"Swallow Island\\". The south eastern edge of the island is rich in birdlife and this inspired Paul Gallico to film the BBC's adaptation of his book The Snow Goose there.

An RNA thermometer (or RNA thermosensor) is a temperature-sensitive non-coding RNA molecule which regulates gene expression. RNA thermometers often regulate genes required during either a heat shock or cold shock response, but have been implicated in other regulatory roles such as in pathogenicity and starvation. In general, RNA thermometers operate by changing their secondary structure in response to temperature fluctuations. This structural transition can then expose or occlude important regions of RNA such as a ribosome binding site, which then affects the translation rate of a nearby protein-coding gene. RNA thermometers, along with riboswitches, are used as examples in support of the RNA world hypothesis. This theory proposes that RNA was once the sole nucleic acid present in cells, and was replaced by the current DNA ‚Üí RNA ‚Üí protein system. Examples of RNA thermometers include FourU, the Hsp90 cis- regulatory element, the ROSE element, the Lig RNA thermometer, and the Hsp17 thermometer. Discovery The first temperature-sensitive RNA element was reported in 1989. Prior to this research, mutations upstream from the transcription start site in a lambda (Œª) phage cIII mRNA were found to affect the level of translation of the cIII protein. This protein is involved in selection of either a lytic or lysogenic life cycle in Œª phage, with high concentrations of cIII promoting lysogeny. Further study of this upstream RNA region identified two alternative secondary structures; experimental study found the structures to be interchangeable, and dependent on both magnesium ion concentration and temperature. This RNA thermometer is now thought to encourage entry to a lytic cycle under heat stress in order for the bacteriophage to rapidly replicate and escape the host cell. The term \\"RNA thermometer\\" was not coined until 1999, when it was applied to the rpoH RNA element identified in Escherichia coli. More recently, bioinformatics searches have been employed to uncover several novel candidate RNA thermometers. Traditional sequence-based searches are inefficient, however, as the secondary structure of the element is much more conserved than the nucleic acid sequence. Distribution Most known RNA thermometers are located in the 5‚Ä≤ untranslated region (UTR) of messenger RNA encoding heat shock proteins‚Äîthough it has been suggested this fact may be due, in part, to sampling bias and inherent difficulties of detecting short, unconserved RNA sequences in genomic data. Though predominantly found in prokaryotes, a potential RNA thermometer has been found in mammals including humans. The candidate thermosensor heat shock RNA-1 (HSR1) activates heat-shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) and induces protective proteins when cell temperature exceeds 37 ¬∞C (body temperature), thus preventing the cells from overheating. Structure ROSE RNA thermometer. RNA thermometers are structurally simple and can be made from short RNA sequences; the smallest is just 44 nucleotides and is found in the mRNA of a heat-shock protein, hsp17, in Synechocystis species PCC 6803. Generally these RNA elements range in length from 60‚Äì110 nucleotides and they typically contain a hairpin with a small number of mismatched base pairs which reduce the stability of the structure, thereby allowing easier unfolding in response to a temperature increase. Detailed structural analysis of the ROSE RNA thermometer revealed that the mismatched bases are actually engaged in nonstandard basepairing that preserves the helical structure of the RNA (see figure). The unusual basepairs consist of G-G, U-U, and UC-U pairs. Since these noncanonical base pairs are relatively unstable, increased temperature causes local melting of the RNA structure in this region, exposing the Shine- Dalgarno sequence. Some RNA thermometers are significantly more complex than a single hairpin, as in the case of a region found in CspA mRNA which is thought to contain a pseudoknot, as well as multiple hairpins. Synthetic RNA thermometers have been designed with just a simple single-hairpin structure. However, the secondary structure of such short RNA thermometers can be sensitive to mutation, as a single base change can render the hairpin inactive in vivo. Mechanism A stable hairpin (left) unwinds at a higher temperature (right). The highlighted Shine-Dalgarno sequence becomes exposed, allowing the binding of the 30S ribosomal subunit. RNA thermometers are found in the 5‚Ä≤ UTR of messenger RNA, upstream of a protein-coding gene. Here they are able to occlude the ribosome binding site (RBS) and prevent translation of the mRNA into protein. As temperature increases, the hairpin structure can 'melt' and expose the RBS or Shine-Dalgarno sequence to permit binding of the small ribosomal subunit (30S), which then assembles other translation machinery. The start codon, typically found 8 nucleotides downstream of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, signals the beginning of a protein-coding gene which is then translated to a peptide product by the ribosome. In addition to this cis- acting mechanism, a lone example of a trans-acting RNA thermometer has been found in RpoS mRNA where it is thought to be involved in the starvation response. A specific example of an RNA thermometer motif is the FourU thermometer found in Salmonella enterica. When exposed to temperatures above 45 ¬∞C, the stem-loop that base-pairs opposite the Shine-Dalgarno sequence becomes unpaired and allows the mRNA to enter the ribosome for translation to occur. Mg2+ ion concentration has also been shown to affect the stability of FourU. The most well-studied RNA thermometer is found in the rpoH gene in Escherichia coli. This thermosensor upregulates heat shock proteins under high temperatures through œÉ32, a specialised heat-shock sigma factor. Though typically associated with heat-induced protein expression, RNA thermometers can also regulate cold-shock proteins. For example, the expression of two 7kDa proteins are regulated by an RNA thermometer in the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus and a similar mechanism has been identified in Enterobacteriales. RNA thermometers sensitive to temperatures of 37 ¬∞C can be used by pathogens to activate infection-specific genes. For example, the upregulation of prfA, encoding a key transcriptional regulator of virulence genes in Listeria monocytogenes, was demonstrated by fusing the 5‚Ä≤ DNA of prfA to the green fluorescent protein gene; the gene fusion was then transcribed from the T7 promoter in E. coli, and fluorescence was observed at 37 ¬∞C but not at 30 ¬∞C. Implications for the RNA world hypothesis The RNA world hypothesis states that RNA was once both the carrier of hereditary information and enzymatically active, with different sequences acting as biocatalysts, regulators and sensors. The hypothesis then proposes that modern DNA, RNA and protein-based life evolved and selection replaced the majority of RNA's roles with other biomolecules. RNA thermometers and riboswitches are thought to be evolutionarily ancient due to their wide-scale distribution in distantly- related organisms. It has been proposed that, in the RNA world, RNA thermosensors would have been responsible for temperature-dependent regulation of other RNA molecules. RNA thermometers in modern organisms may be molecular fossils which could hint at a previously more widespread importance in an RNA world.

It aired in the United States on NBC on January 20, 2011.  Plot  The study group regathers after the winter break. Annie (Alison Brie) hints that she met someone she likes, and the others try to guess who it is. Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown) tries and fails to interest them in the fact she is getting back with her ex-husband. Chang (Ken Jeong) again requests to join the group, but Jeff (Joel McHale) flatly rejects him. The group goes for their first class of the semester, Anthropology, taught by a now-sober Duncan. Troy (Donald Glover) accidentally tells Pierce (Chevy Chase) that Shirley had sex with Chang at the Halloween party no one can remember (\\"Epidemiology\\"). Doctor Rich (Greg Cromer), Jeff's nemesis from pottery class (\\"Beginner Pottery\\"), enters and sits with Annie. Jeff realizes that Rich is the one Annie has a crush on. In the cafeteria, Britta (Gillian Jacobs) realizes a sober Duncan will make the class more difficult. Annie suggests they ask Rich to join the study group. When Jeff objects, Annie suggests they have a mixer and invite a number of people from class to pick one as the next study group member. Shirley's ex-husband Andre (Malcolm-Jamal Warner) shows up. When he goes for ice cream, Britta tells Shirley that she should reconsider her decision, to which Shirley blurts out that she is pregnant and 8 weeks along. Troy and Pierce realize that she might be carrying Chang's baby. At the mixer, Troy tries to find out if Shirley had sex with Andre around Halloween, but fails. Pierce suggests that simply telling Shirley would be kinder to her. Jeff brings a pretty girl named Quendra (Marcy McCusker), hoping that will lure Pierce, Troy, and Abed to ask her to become a member instead of Rich, but something Pierce says makes her storm out. Rich brings kettle corn, instantly gaining popularity. Chang confronts Abed (Danny Pudi) about the fact that he wasn't invited, but Abed just acts like a malfunctioning robot. Eventually, Annie calls for a vote, pointing out that Rich is the only candidate who has stayed. Jeff, desperate to keep Rich out of the study group, agrees to sponsor Chang. Jeff tries to convince the group to pick Chang over Rich, pointing out that they know very little about Rich, and his perfect behavior is too good to be true. The vote is evenly divided, with Jeff, Abed, and Britta voting for Chang, and Annie, Troy, and Pierce voting for Rich. Shirley breaks the tie by voting for Chang despite a threat from Pierce. Angry, Pierce callously reveals that Shirley had sex with Chang on Halloween and that the baby might be his. Chang says that explains the photos on his phone, which‚Äîto her horror‚Äîhe shows Shirley. Later, Annie confronts Jeff in the men's room and demands an explanation for his apparent jealousy. Jeff can only say that relationships are complicated. Britta then asks Jeff to find Andre and get him to fix things with Shirley. Jeff finds Andre, who blames himself for leaving her in the first place. He also says that he will raise the child whether it is his or Chang's. When Abed reports that Rich has rejected Annie for a date due to their age difference, Jeff rushes off dramatically in the rain to apologize to someone, who we eventually find out is Rich. He confusedly explains his desire to have Rich's \\"power\\" of being perfect, so that he can abuse it. Explaining that he can't fake being good just to get away with bad things, Rich invites him in. In the epilogue, Rich visits 'Troy and Abed in the Morning' to demonstrate how to make kettle corn, even though he knows it's not a real TV show.  Production  The episode was written by Emily Cutler and directed by Anthony Russo. Continuity *Troy mentions the disturbing call he got from Chang on Halloween in the episode Epidemiology.

She served during the Napoleonic Wars. During the Gunboat War she took part in two engagements with Danish gunboats, during the second of which the Danes captured her. The British recaptured her seven months later, but she was wrecked in 1812. Design Like the rest of her class, Alban was made of Bermudan or pencil cedar and to a design copied from that of the Lady Hammond, a Bermudan sloop. The Admiralty ordered the class as cutters, but they were completed as schooners. Even so, most references to Alban refer to her as a cutter. She had a crew of 35 men and carried an armament of ten 18-pounder carronades. Initial service She was commissioned in May 1805 under Lieutenant James Stone. On 27 July she was under the command of Lieutenant Henry Wier and in company with , , , and the hired armed brig , when they captured nine French chasse marees. On 27 October she recaptured Favourite. On 17 January 1808 Alban captured the American ship Active. Then on 8 April she sailed for Rio de Janeiro. Gunboat War In 1809 Alban sailed to the Baltic. On 5 November she captured the Prussian sloop Gute Bothe. On 23 May 1810 Alban was in company with and the hired armed cutter, Princess of Wales, when they encountered seven Danish gunboats off The Skaw. In the subsequent engagement one gunboat blew up and the British succeeded in damaging and dispersing the other six. On 13 June 1810, Alban captured the Regina Doreatha. Almost two weeks later, on 13 June, she captured the Danish galliot Catharina Augusta. Weir was promoted to the command of on 28 June 1810, but he was still captain of Alban on 12 July when she captured another Danish galliot, the Caroline. At some point command transferred to Lieutenant Samuel Thomas. On 12 September 1810, Alban was off L√¶s√∏ island when she saw six Danish gunboats coming towards her from the direction of the Skaw. Wind conditions were calm so Alban had to resort to her sweeps to try to escape the Danes. She was unsuccessful and by early afternoon an engagement had commenced. After about three hours, a cannon shot took off the back of Thomas's skull.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 25, p. 133. His second in command, Midshipman Alexander Hutchinson, continued the resistance for another hour, but then struck. Alban had lost two men killed (including Thomas), and had three wounded, out of a crew of some 25. She also had five feet of water in her hold, and her rigging and sails were entirely shot away. The subsequent court martial honourably acquitted Hutchinson and the surviving officers and men, and recommended Hutchinson for promotion. The Danish gunboat flotilla was under the command of Lieutenant J√∏rgen Conrad de Falsen. Danish service The Alban was under the command of Lieutenant Th√∏ger Emil Rosen√∏rn when she encountered on 11 May 1811 near the Shetland Islands.Rosen√∏rn had been the captain of when the British captured her at Nyborg in 1808. Rifleman chased The Alban for twelve hours before she succeeded in capturing the Dane. She was armed with 12 guns and had a crew of 58 men. She was three days out of Farsund, Norway, but had not captured anything. According to Danish sources, Rosen√∏rn fought bravely and when he saw that defeat was inevitable, he hacked away rigging and created holes in the hull before he surrendered. Even so, The Alban did not sink and the British took her back into service as Alban. British service and loss The Admiralty had Alban fitted at Sheerness between July and November 1811. She was recommissioned in October under Lieutenant William Sturges Key. Alban was wrecked on 18 December 1812 at Aldeburgh, Suffolk. A contemporary newspaper report suggested she had run against an offshore sandbank on the evening of 17 December, and become stuck fast.Times of London, 12 and 25 December 1812. Cited in: The crew immediately lightened the ship by throwing the guns overboard and cutting away the mast. This freed the vessel but left her drifting helplessly towards the Aldeburgh shore, where she was beached at 8am on the following morning. Townsfolk from Aldeburgh reached the ship by mid- morning to discover the ship firmly beached with the stern still partly submerged in the surf. The crew were alive, other than ship's surgeon, Mr Thompson, who jumped overboard when the rescue party arrived and was drowned in the waves by the stern. It appeared that the vast majority of those on board were drunk and made no effort to escape the vessel despite ready access to the shore. By 9am the tide had risen through the ship and drowned all but two on board. The survivors, a seaman and a female servant of Lieutenant Key's wife, were brought away in safety.

This is because the Palace of the Generalitat of Catalonia and the City Hall are located here across from one another. This square has a great historical value but it is relatively recent since its origin is from the early-19th century, when the new main fa√ßade of the City Hall was built and the former church of Sant Jaume was demolished. History The Castellers de Barcelona in front of the City Hall The Pla√ßa Sant Jaume is located at the former center of the Roman city of Barcino, where its main streets, the cardo (modern day Llibreteria and Call streets) and decumanus (now the streets of Bisbe/Ciutat/Regomir), crossed. At this junction there was the forum and the Temple of Augustus, of which four columns are preserved on top of Mont T√†ber, found at the adjacent Parad√≠s Street. The Square takes its modern name from the church of Church of Sant Jaume, which had been located at the site of the square since medieval times. Formerly, the city council of Barcelona met in the porch at the front of that church, until it bought a number of nearby homes that would house the future headquarters of the institution on the neighboring street. The old church was demolished in 1823 when Ferran Street was being built; its demolition also allowed for the Square to be rebuilt as it exists today. Note that prior to these demolitions, the square was limited to a small angular space, with the rest of the future plaza being occupied by the same church, its cemetery, and the houses of the Magistracy and the General Court of the Veguer.

After news of this was released by The Canadian Press, he was removed from the campaign, although his mere involvement in political affairs was criticized by opposition leaders. * Yvon L√©vesque, the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois MP for Abitibi‚ÄîBaie-James‚ÄîNunavik‚ÄîEeyou, was quoted as saying that \\"Certain voters will not choose the New Democratic Party now that they're running an aboriginal candidate.\\" He was referring to New Democratic Party (NDP) candidate Rom√©o Saganash, who won the election. *Cheryl Gallant, the Conservative candidate for Renfrew‚ÄîNipissing‚ÄîPembroke, compared Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff to Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. She later apologized. *On March 18, Mark Strahl (son of incumbent Conservative MP Chuck Strahl) was nominated as the candidate in his father's riding of Chilliwack‚ÄîFraser Canyon. The nomination process, which usually takes four weeks, lasted only a week. During the nomination Mark Strahl was endorsed by former Reform leader Preston Manning, who said \\"Mark Strahl‚Äîby virtue of his family background ‚Ä¶ is well prepared for service in the House of Commons.\\" This was criticized by members of the Conservative party: former Chilliwack city council Casey Langbroek said most Conservative party members from the riding were upset, and Alex Moens said \\"High public office should not be like a family business, where it's passed on from father to son.\\" *At a tightly controlled event aimed at immigrant communities in Brampton, Ontario, Harper used the phrase \\"you people\\" to attendees. Ignatieff and NDP leader Jack Layton immediately criticized Harper and pointed to his record of reducing family reunification quotas for immigration and criminal justice policies that allegedly disadvantage non-white populations. *Two veterans, including Jim Lowther of the Veterans Emergency Transition Team were not permitted to enter a Harper Halifax news conference nor even watch his speech. *During a Conservative rally in London, Ontario, an RCMP officer asked two students to leave the event for having supposed ties to the Liberal Party. One of the students later complained that the only reason she could think of for being removed was the fact she had a Facebook profile photo showing her posing for a picture with Michael Ignatieff, after having previously attended an NDP and Liberal rally. Both Ignatieff and Jack Layton immediately criticized their forced removal. * On April 6, Andr√© Forbes, the Liberal candidate for the rural Quebec riding of Manicouagan, was criticized by the NDP for calling First Nations and Inuit people \\"featherheads,\\" as well as being the founder of the white supremacist group l'Association des Droits des Blancs (literally the Association for White Rights), despite being M√©tis himself. Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff stated that he was \\"shocked\\" by the Forbes comments and that \\"if he really said that, it's not possible to remain a candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada.\\" Later the same day, Ignatieff announced that Forbes was no longer the Liberal candidate for Manicouagan. While Forbes remained on the ballot as a Liberal, he would not have been allowed to sit with the Liberal caucus had he won. * Liberal Party leader Michael Ignatieff's wife, Zsuzsanna Zsohar, came under attack from conservative lobby group National Citizens Coalition president Peter Coleman over the fact that she is not yet a Canadian citizen, and will therefore be unable to vote for her husband on May 2. Zsohar explained in the interview that she, like any other immigrant arriving in Canada, was waiting in line for her Citizenship application to be accepted and that the campaign was not about her. * The Conservative Party came under heavy fire on April 11 when a draft report for the G8 summit was leaked to the Canadian Press, which indicated that the Tories misled the Parliament of Canada to seek approval for $50 million tax dollars to be spread on dubious projects, which over half of it was spent on the riding of Parry Sound‚ÄîMuskoka, Industry Minister Tony Clement's riding. It prompted calls from the other leaders to release the report immediately, but the Auditor General of Canada, Sheila Fraser, told reporters the rules forbid her to release it because she has to release it to the Speaker of the House of Commons. * A Green Party candidate, Alan Saldanha, resigned after making a rape comment on Facebook. Saldanha, running for a seat in British Columbia's Fleetwood‚ÄîPort Kells riding, has since removed the comment. * Two Conservative riding association members (Richard Lorello and Tracey Kent) quit their own riding association in Vaughan after money was earmarked for the Vaughan Health Campus of Care (VHCC), which has two key fund-raisers for incumbent Tory candidate Julian Fantino as backers. Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff responded to the incident, saying that \\"it doesn't sit well, it doesn't look right, it doesn't feel right and Conservatives themselves are embarrassed by it.\\" *Canadian Arab Federation president Khaled Mouamar received an email from Etobicoke Centre Conservative campaign staffer Zeljko Zidaric asking him if he had any groups that would like to participate in a Conservative rally \\"by having someone at the event in an ethnic costume\\". The email further elaborated that they wanted them for a \\"photo-op about all the multicultural groups that support Ted Opitz our local Conservative candidate and the Prime Minister.\\" Mouamar took offence to the email. A counter rally was made to protest the email. *Conservative candidate Gavan Paranchothy (previously known as Ragavan Paranchothy), who is running in the riding of Scarborough Southwest, has in the past praised the Tamil Tiger movement, including hosting a televised tribute to the Tamil Tigers in November 2010. When questioned about the candidate Conservative leader Stephen Harper simply stated that his party has \\"taken a strong position against the Tamil Tigers\\", but did not comment specifically about the candidate. *One-term Penticton city councillor Dan Albas was nominated as the Conservative Party candidate in Okanagan‚ÄîCoquihalla, the riding of Stockwell Day, the former Canadian Alliance leader and president of the Treasury Board. The nomination process lasted only a week, causing at least five prospective candidates not to make the nomination deadline. Albas and the two other candidates who managed to file their paperwork in time were both close associates of Stockwell Day and are alleged to have had prior notification of Day's surprise resignation. The process was criticized by members of the Conservative party including Day's fundraising chair, who says he ripped up his Conservative Party membership card. One of the candidates who missed the deadline, party veteran Sean Upshaw, ran as an 'independent conservative' candidate in the riding. * The Conservative Party alleged that a special ballot held at the University of Guelph on April 13, 2011 could in fact be illegal under the Canada Elections Act, claiming that partisan election material was present. Elections Canada, who are responsible for enforcing the act, responded that the ballots were legal. The action by the Conservatives, especially after allegations that a party volunteer attempted to grab the ballot box in an attempt to halt the voting, was criticized by the opposition parties, who accused the Conservatives of discouraging youth from voting. * Conservative candidate Wally Daudrich had posted on his Facebook page that Barack Obama was the \\"worst president that America has ever had\\" as well as \\"the biggest lying president America has ever had\\". His comments were primarily motivated by the candidate's stance on abortion, with him being against certain aspects of the President's health-care reform bill. After his post became widely publicized he deleted the comment. Conservative leader Stephen Harper refused to admonish the candidate, stating instead that he and Obama \\"have a very good working relationship\\". *Brad Trost, the Conservative incumbent for Saskatoon‚ÄîHumboldt, spoke at a Saskatchewan Pro-life Association convention and told the audience that the government had denied funding to Planned Parenthood. Prime Minister Stephen Harper did not comment on Trost's remarks, instead stating that the Conservative Party does not intend to reopen the abortion debate in Parliament. *Conservative candidate Wai Young (Vancouver South) came under fire for being endorsed by the man acquitted in the Air India bombing, Ripudaman Singh Malik, Young said she had no idea that Malik was involved with the Khalsa School. *Conservatives condemned a Liberal television ad which wrongly quoted Harper saying he would scrap the Canada Health Act. This was actually a quote from a National Citizens Coalition colleague of Harper's. The Liberals replaced the quote, which they had found misattributed to Harper in a Globe and Mail story, with another one of Harper's statements about health care that they said delivered the same message. *Michael Ignatieff criticized Conservative candidates for not attending local debates. Later Ignatieff said that he would not attend the debates in his riding of Etobicoke‚ÄîLakeshore because of his duties to campaign nationally as party leader. Stephen Harper also planned not to be attending any debates in his riding, Calgary Southwest, because he would be campaigning nationally. *A Liberal campaign volunteer for Joe Volpe in Eglinton‚ÄîLawrence was caught on camera removing Green Party pamphlets from mailboxes, throwing them away, and replacing them with Liberal campaign materials, as Volpe looked on. Tampering with mail is a criminal offence in Canada. Volpe has since fired the worker, but only after being caught on camera standing next to the worker as he committed these actions. * On April 29, 2011, a retired police officer told the Sun News Network and the Toronto Sun newspaper that in 1996, Layton had been found naked in a massage parlour when police, looking for underage prostitutes, raided the establishment. The police informed Layton of the potentially questionable use of the business and recommended that he avoid it in the future. No charges were laid. The Sun later ran a follow-up piece, in which Toronto city councillor Giorgio Mammoliti criticized Layton. Layton has said there was no wrongdoing in the matter, saying that he simply \\"went for a massage at a community clinic\\" and did not return after the police advised him not to. He also referred to the release of the police report as a smear campaign against him. Bloc Qu√©b√©cois leader Gilles Duceppe has also dismissed the claim. A subsequent Toronto Star column stated that most contributors to online discussions agreed there was a smear campaign against Layton. As for political damage from this story, that same day's update of the Nanos Leadership Index, which assesses public opinion on the Canadian federal leaders' trustworthiness, competence and vision for Canada, Layton rose from 80% to 97%, surpassing Harper at 88% and Ignatieff 39%. The polling company speculated this improvement is due to strong sympathy by the public for a political candidate they judged as being unfairly maligned. Toronto Police have launched an investigation into how official police notes were leaked to Sun Media. Police notebooks are closely guarded and may contain unfounded and unproven allegations.

Three species are known: the type species A. huangguoshuensis (named in 1999), the slightly older species A. wushaensis (named in 2006), and the species A. huangnihensis (named in 2007). Description and species Anshunsaurus was a marine reptile with a long neck, slender skull, and long, paddle-like tail. In comparison to its long trunk, the limbs are very small. Anshunsaurus is characterized by a long jugal bone in the skull, fused postorbital and postfrontal bones around the eyes, a maxilla that forms part of the margin of the eye socket, a humerus with large crests, and a large fibula. The type species of Ansunsaurus, A. huangguoshuensis, was named in 1999 from the Ladinian or Carnian age Falang Formation in Guanling County. Although several complete skeletons are known, most specimens are crushed in either dorsal (top) or ventral (bottom) view. The holotype of A. huangguoshuensis, IVPP V11835, is preserved in dorsal view while a second specimen, IVPP V11834, is preserved in ventral view. Based on these specimens, A. huangguoshuensis grew to about in length. Although the tip is not preserved in any specimen, the tail made up at least half of the animal's length. A juvenile specimen of A. huangguoshuensis was described in 2015. A second species, A. wushaensis, was named in 2006 from Xingyi. A. wushaensis is slightly smaller than A. huangguoshuensis and has a smaller head relative to its body length. It also has shorter neural spines with ridges on their upper surface, a shorter fourth digit on the hand, a well-developed entepicondyle on the humerus, and a shorter jugal bone. A juvenile specimen of A. wushaensis was described in 2007, making Anshunsaurus the only thalattosaur with a known growth series other than Xinpusaurus. The pectoral and pelvic girdles are asymmetrical in this specimen, suggesting that the bones on the left and right sides of the animal did not ossify at the same rate while it was growing. In 2007 a third species of Anshunsaurus, A. huangnihensis, was described from Xingyi. It is distinguished from the other two species on the basis of the shape of its coracoid, a bone of the pectoral girdle. Classification When it was first described in 1999, Anshunsaurus was thought to be a sauropterygian. In 2000, Anshunsaurus was reidentified as a thalattosaur and has remained in this group ever since. It was placed in the family Askeptosauridae along with the genus Askeptosaurus from Europe. Both thalattosaurs belong to Askeptosauroidea, a group characterized by their long necks and narrow skulls. Of the three species of Anshunsaurus, A. huangnihensis shares more features with other thalattosaurs such as Askeptosaurus and Endennasaurus. These features suggest that A. huangnihensis is a transitional form between earlier thalattosaurs and the later species of Anshunsaurus.

It may also be used, as part of post exposure prophylaxis, to prevent HIV infection following potential exposure. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include trouble sleeping, feeling tired, diarrhea, high blood sugar, and headache. Severe side effects may include allergic reactions and liver problems. There is tentative concerns that use during pregnancy can result in harm to the baby. It is unclear if use during breastfeeding is safe. Dolutegravir is an HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitor which blocks the functioning of HIV integrase which is needed for viral replication. Dolutegravir was approved for medical use in the United States in 2013. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. Abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine, a combination with abacavir and lamivudine is also available. As of 2019, the WHO recommends DTG as the first- and second-line treatment for all persons with HIV.  Medical use  Dolutegravir is approved for use in a broad population of HIV-infected patients. It can be used to treat HIV-infected adults who have never taken HIV therapy (treatment- na√Øve) and HIV-infected adults who have previously taken HIV therapy (treatment-experienced), including those who have been treated with other integrase strand transfer inhibitors. Tivicay is also approved for children ages 12 years and older weighing at least 40 kilograms (kg) who are treatment- na√Øve or treatment-experienced but have not previously taken other integrase strand transfer inhibitors.FDA approves new drug to treat HIV infection https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm364744.htm August 12, 2013 In the European Union it is indicated, in combination with other anti-retroviral medicinal products, for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infected adults, adolescents and children above six years of age. In June 2020, the indication for dolutegravir in the US was updated to include children at least four weeks old and weighing at least 3 kg (6.61 pounds). Adverse effects Common side effects of dolutegravir in clinical trials included insomnia and headache. Serious side effects included allergic reactions and abnormal liver function in patients who were also infected with hepatitis B or C. The package insert warns against a mean rise in serum creatinine of 0.11 mg/dL due to inhibition of tubular secretion of creatinine and does not affect GFR. Pregnancy There is tentative concerns that use during pregnancy can result in harm to the baby. Effective birth control is thus recommended while on dolutegravir, with pregnancy testing before starting treatment. Use during the first trimester should only occur if there is no alternative. History In February 2013, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that it would fast track dolutegravir's approval process. On August 13, 2013, dolutegravir was approved for medical use in the United States. On November 4, 2013, dolutegravir was approved by Health Canada. On January 16, 2014, it was approved by the European Commission for use throughout the European Union. In 2019, a triple- combination therapy, with dolutegravir replacing efavirenz, was introduced as the first-line treatment for all people (pregnant excluded) with HIV by the South African Government (public) sector. In June 2020, dolutegravir was approved in the US with an indication to treat HIV-1 infection in children at least four weeks old and weighing at least 3 kg (6.61 pounds) in combination with other antiretroviral treatments. It is intended to treat children at least 4 weeks old and 3 kg who have never been treated for HIV or who have been treated, but not with an integrase strand transferase inhibitor (INSTI) class drug.

He was the brother of Ederson, Julia, Thelma, William, Evelyn and Clayton. In the 1930s, he met writer Langston Hughes and Marxist philosopher Raya Dunayevskaya which prompted him to devote his life to socialist reform. In the 1950s he moved to the San Francisco Bay Area with his wife, Lillian. Early life and education After his arrival in the Bay Area, Allen studied under photographer Ansel Adams at what is now called the San Francisco Art Institute. In 1955, he produced, directed, filmed and edited the 16-millimeter film \\"Have You Sold Your Dozen Roses?\\" with San Francisco poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Willis was also an early collaborator with Melvin Van Peebles around this time. Television and documentary film career In 1963, Willis was hired by San Francisco public television station KQED, which according to the East Bay Media Center, made him the first African American in broadcast journalism in California. For the next 25 years, Willis would direct a number of award-winning films, including \\"Stagger Lee,\\" a 1970 documentary on Black Panther leader Bobby Seale.

The painting depicts Jesus and the Apostles during the Last Supper, with Judas, unlike all the other apostles, sitting separately on the near side of the table, as is common in depictions of the Last Supper in Christian art. Sant'Apollonia was a Benedictine convent of cloistered nuns, and Castagno's fresco was not publicly known until the convent was suppressed in 1866: Vasari, for example, seems not to have known of the painting.John Spencer, Andrea Del Castagno and His Patrons, Durham: Duke University Press, 1991, pp. 102-111. Thus its exclusively female audience should be considered in analyzing the work.Andr√©e Hayum, \\"A Renaissance Audience Considered: The Nuns at S. Apollonia and Castagno's Last Supper, The Art Bulletin, 88 (2006), pp. 243-266. Castagno painted a large chamber with life-sized figures that confronted the nuns at every meal. The fresco would have served as a didactic image and an inspiration to meditation on their relationship with Jesus. Painted with a careful attention to naturalistic detail‚Äîa sense of real space and light, seemingly tangible details of the setting, and lifelike figures‚Äîthe work must have spoken forcefully of the continued significance of the Eucharistic meal in their own world. Refectory of Sant'Apollonia Description Although the Last Supper is described in all four Gospels, Castagno's fresco seems most closely aligned with the account in the Gospel of John, in which eleven of the apostles are confused and the devil \\"enters\\" Judas when Jesus announces one of his followers will betray him.Eve Borsook, The Mural Painters of Tuscany from Cimabue to Andrea del Sarto, 2nd Ed., Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1980, p. 87-89. Saint John's posture of innocent slumber neatly contrasts with Judas's tense, upright pose and exaggeratedly pointed facial features. Except for Judas, Christ and his apostles, including the recumbent St John, all have a translucent disc of a halo above their heads. Andrea del castagno, sant'apollonia 05 The detail and naturalism of this fresco portray the ways in which Castagno departed from earlier artistic styles. The hand positions of the final pair of apostles on either end of the fresco mirror each other with accomplished realism. The colors of the apostles' robes and their postures contribute to the balance of the piece. The highly detailed marble walls hearken back to Roman \\"First Style\\" wall paintings, and the pillars and griffon statues recall Classical sculpture and trompe l'oeil painting. Furthermore, the color highlights in the hair of the figures, flowing robes, and perspective in the halos foreshadow advancements to come. The Last Supper was a major work by Castagno and his studio. The quality of figures and details can be uneven. The right hand of St Peter appears to be replaced by a left hand. Some figures have a remote detachment from emotion, typical of early High Renaissance style, and exemplified by the style of Piero della Francesca. This work, located in the refectory of a convent of cloistered nuns, may or may not have been seen by Leonardo da Vinci was familiar with this work before he painted his far more emotional own Last Supper.

Diego L√≥pez Pacheco was son of Juan Pacheco, one of the most influential politicians of his time, and Mar√≠a Portocarrero. In 1468, he received from his father the title of 2nd Marquis of Villena. At the age of 12, Diego was married to Juana de Luna, also 12 and granddaughter of √Ålvaro de Luna, as part of a plan by his family to get a hold of the inheritance of √Ålvaro de Luna. Juana Pimentel, grandmother of Juana de Luna, had tried to prevent the marriage, but had failed because of the intervention of King Henry IV of Castile. In the War of the Castilian Succession, Diego and his father supported Juana la Beltraneja, who lost the battle for the throne. Diego, who had become 2nd Duke of Escalona after the death of his father in October 1474, was pardoned by Isabella I of Castile and allowed to keep his properties. But he wasn't chosen as successor for his father as Grand Master of the Order of Santiago. His wife Juana de Luna died in 1480. Diego remarried in 1484 with Juana Enr√≠quez y Velasco, sister of Fadrique Enr√≠quez, Admiral of Castile. Diego L√≥pez Pacheco fought as general against the Moors, and was present in the final Siege of Granada in 1492, which ended the Moorish presence in Spain. In 1504, after the death of Isabel, Pacheco supported her eldest surviving daughter, Queen Juana, and her king consort Felipe, over King Ferdinand of Aragon's faction. In 1519, he was made a Knight in the Order of the Golden Fleece. Humanist Diego was an admirer of Desiderius Erasmus. In his castle, he entertained alumbrados like Isabel de la Cruz and Pedro Ru√≠z de Alcaraz, both conversos. Diego was also an important patron of culture and the arts. Francisco de Osuna dedicated in 1527 his book El tercer abecedario to him, as did Juan de Vald√©s 2 years later with his book Di√°logo de la doctrina cristiana.

The line is long and was built between 1954 and 1957. The Yingtan‚ÄìXiamen railway was the first railroad to be built in Fujian and serves as a major trunkline in China's railway network. Major cities and towns along route include Yingtan, Zixi, Guangze, Shaowu, Shunchang, Sha County, Sanming, Yongan, Zhangping, Zhangzhou, Hua'an and Xiamen. Line Description Xiamen railway station, the south-eastern terminal of the Yingxia line In the north, the Yingtan‚ÄìXiamen railway branches from the Zhejiang‚ÄìJiangxi railway at Yingtan in Jiangxi province and proceeds south to Zixi on the border with Fujian province. From Zixi, the railway follows Futun Stream, a headwater tributary of the Min River in a southeasterly course, through the Wuyi Mountains of northern Fujian, to Nanping. At Nanping, the railway turns to the southwest, following the Sand Stream (Shaxi) through central Fujian to Yongan. From Yongan, the railway runs south to Zhangzhou and then east to Xiamen. Until January 2010, the railway was connected to the island of Xiamen via causeway from the mainland. On January 31, 2010, the Yingxia railway switched route to the newly opened Xinglin Railway Bridge. History The Yingtan‚ÄìXiamen railway was originally proposed by Sun Yat-Sen in his plan to build the Chinese nation. In October 1949, at the inaugural Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing, Tan Kah Kee, a philanthropist and leader of the Singapore Chinese community, proposed that a railway be built in his native Fujian province. Mao Zedong said the proposal could not be implemented immediately, but was nonetheless supportive. Planning of the railway began in 1951 under Zhang Dingcheng, the first party-secretary of Fujian province, with Y553 million allocated from the central government. Three routes were proposed: * Western Route running from Nanchang to Ganzhou and then to Ruijin, all in Jiangxi province, before turning east into southern Fujian, reaching Xiamen, on the coast. * Central Route running from Nanchang to Nancheng and Shicheng on the Jiangxi side of the Jiangxi-Fujian border to Ruijin before turning east into southern Fujian, reaching, Xiamen on the coast. * Eastern Route running from Yingtan in Jiangxi province, on the existing Zhejiang‚ÄìJiangxi railway, to Zixi and then entering northern Fujian and passing through Nanping and Sanming in central Fujian before reaching Zhangzhou and Xiamen in southern Fujian. The Eastern Route was selected because it was the shortest and least expensive to build. The railway was intended to serve dual purposes of national defense and regional development. The coast of Fujian opposite of Taiwan was then a defensive frontline against the Nationalist Chinese government on Taiwan. Construction began in February 1955 under the joint-leadership of the Fujian People's Government and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which had seven divisions mobilized and invited a working group of engineering advisors from the Soviet Union. As many as 12 divisions would be involved in the construction effort. Another 100,000 civilian workers also joined the effort. The railway passed through mountainous terrain that complicated building efforts and required explosives to level mountains and blast tunnels, and significant bridge-building. In October 1955, the Defense Minister Peng Dehuai requested that the railway be completed one year ahead of schedule and building efforts were expedited. The first tracks were laid in Xiamen in December 1956 and the entire Yingxia Railway was completed in 1957. It was the first railway to be built in Fujian province. Surplus funds and manpower were then used to build the Nanping‚ÄìFuzhou railway. The Yingxia railway was electrified in sections from 1986 to 1993.

It is considered innovative because of its emphasis on the broader conceptualization of distribution, which covers not only tangible goods but also abstract goods such as rights. The theory is distinguished from simple equality since it allows certain inequalities in social goods.  Theory  The theory posits that inequalities in several spheres of society should not invade one another. Walzer's definition of complex equality is: \\"In formal terms, complex equality means that no citizen's standing in one sphere or with regard to one social good can be undercut by his standing in some other sphere, with regard to some other good.\\" In this state of affairs, there are variety of goods and these are distributed according to the appropriate principles that are inherent in their social meanings. The idea is that the resulting multiple inequalities that consistently do not favor any group serve as the equalizer. A reading of Waltzer's notion is that it is culturally relative. For instance, in the case of a caste society, complex equality is characterized by the integration of meanings attached to goods in all spheres, effectively subjecting prestige, wealth, office, occupation, clothing, food, and knowledge to the same hierarchy.See also * Equality of opportunity References=Bibliography : : Further reading : : : Category:Egalitarianism ","title":"Complex equality"},{"id":"31576687","text":"Bindo Umaru Jibrilla (born 16 June,1963) is a Nigerian businessman who became the candidate of the People's Democratic Party in the 9 April 2011 Senatorial election for the Adamawa North district, and went on to be elected to the Nigerian Senate. His candidature was unsuccessfully disputed by the incumbent Senator Mohammed Mana. Bindow was elected governor of Adamawa State after defeating Nuhu Ribadu and Markus Gundiri in the April 2015 governorshipolls. In 2019, he sought re-election for a second term in office but was defeated by opposition People's Democratic Party's candidate, Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri. PDP primary Bindo Umaru Jibrilla is described as a business tycoon, new to politics. He is an industrialist who has established three companies in Mubi, employing about four hundred people, and is a vibrant speaker. He was reportedly called upon by several youth organisations to challenge Mana, who was said to have neglected his senate district. He is known for his philanthropy and for creating jobs, and as the youngest contender would have an advantage with the youth vote. In the January 2011 PDP primaries for the Adamawa North Senatorial race, Jibrilla Bindo got 626 votes, Mohammed Mana was second with 474 votes, Zira Maigadi secured 162 votes, while Terry Vahyla got 21. Another incumbent Senator, Grace Bent of Adamawa South, was also defeated. On 7 February 2011, well after the deadline for the parties to change their candidate lists had passed, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) published a list showing Jibrilla as PDP candidate for Adamawa not North. Appeals Mana and Bent independently filed appeals against the primary results. Newspapers reported that there would be a re-run of the primaries, which the (INEC) said it would not recognise. The PDP state chairman, Alhaji Minjinyawa Kugama, also denied knowledge of the re-run, saying he had heard nothing about it from the party leadership, and saying that the primary election had been free and fair. On 15 March 2011 both Governor Murtala Nyako and the state chairman of the party, Mijinyawa Umaru Kugama, said that they would not support Mana and Bent in their appeals. Later in March 2011 a Federal High Court in Abuja dismissed the appeal as lacking in merit. Mana appealed this ruling. Justice Kafarati affirmed the election of Jibrilla as PDP Candidate for Adamawa North Senatorial district. A PDP leader in the state, Malam Rabiu Rara, advised the two to obey the court orders. April election In the 9 April 2011 election, Jibrilla polled 75,112 votes, while the runner-up Boni Haruna of the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), a former governor of the state, polled 70,890.

It was commissioned by Catherine Lescuyer as a commemorative piece for her father. Rubens created it as part of an altarpiece in the Church of St. Rombout (Rumbold) in Mechelen.Wieseman, Drawn by the Brush: Oil Sketches by Peter Paul Rubens. The painting depicts Jesus and the Apostles during the Last Supper, with Judas dressed in blue turning back towards the viewer and away from the table. Other than Jesus, the most prominent figure is Judas. Judas holds his right hand to his mouth with his eyes avoiding direct contact with the other figures in the painting creating a nervous expression. Jesus is dressed in red and has a yellow halo surrounding his head with his face tilted upwards. Jesus is located centrally in the painting surrounded by his disciples with six on each side, and he holds a loaf of bread with a cup of wine in front of him. Out of all of the figures, he is the most in the light with the figures to the farthest left being the most in shadow. ‚ÄúThe scene thus represents a perfect conflation of the theological significance of the Last Supper‚Äù meaning the conflation between the blessing of the bread and the wine while still being pivotal in the sense of revealing the betrayal.Freedberg, The Last Supper, 83. As in many other Northern European depictions, a dog with a bone can be seen in the scene, probably a simple pet. It may represent faith, dogs are traditionally symbols of and are representing faith.Viladesau, The Pathos of the Cross. According to J. Richard Judson the dog near Judas perhaps represents greed or evil, as the companion of Judas, as in John 13:27.Judson, The Passion of Christ, 49. This painting followed the first unsuccessful attempt by Rubens to produce a Last Supper in 1611, when his patrons backed out the last minute, perhaps due to the high price of 4,000 Guilder asked by Rubens.Tummers, Art Market and Connoisseurship, 117. Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper fresco was a significant influence on Rubens who created an etching after the Davinci Last Supper, which was one of Rubens first attempts to express the full range of human emotion printed by Pieter Soutman. Rubens was also influenced by his humanist ideals from which he extracts biblical themes.Mulvihill, Peter Paul Rubens: Impressions of a Master Exhibition, 76. Rubens often made engravings following the completion of his works. Other artists used these engravings to serve as a basis of their own works.Freedberg, The Last Supper, 86. These copies were even collected.Alpers, \\"Review by: Svetlana Alpers\\", 114 The engravings and copies helped to lead to the popularity of Rubens‚Äô works during his lifetime.

It was founded in 1472 and existed until 1686. It had its seat in the house Am Markt 10, the present town community hall, in the Old Town (Altstadt) of Pirna. Other Eisenkammern existed as authorities regulating the iron trade for instance in the former Austria iron centres of Steyr and Scheibbs.  History  Iron ore was mined in the Eastern Ore Mountains probably already in the 13th century and has been confirmed for the town of Berggie√üh√ºbel in an accounting dated 1450. Berggie√üh√ºbel, being the centre of iron mining in the Pirna district, was the seat of a local mining authority, whose regulations of 1546 applied to the whole of the Pirna mining district. Patrons of the mines were the Electors of Saxony and the noble families von B√ºnau of Liebstadt and von Bernstein of Ottendorf. The products made from the local iron ore were known as Pirnisches Eisen (\\"Pirna iron\\") and were in high demand for two main reasons: * Pirna iron was highly esteemed for having been made from magnetite, the iron ore of the highest grade. The historian Petrus Albinus notes (place names with historical spelling): ::‚Ä≥The third and most excellent iron is made in Lawenstein and Berggiesh√ºbel and Glassh√ºtten / all three are situated not far from the cities Dre√üden and Pirna. Hence many call the iron / that is made there Pirnisch / and praise it to be more malleable than the Lusatian one / which otherwise is still widely traded.‚Ä≥translated from Albinus, Petrus: Mei√ünische Land- u. Berg-Chronica 1589, XVI. Titel, S. 134 . * The Electorate of Saxony was generally short of iron, which was mainly needed for armaments and for the extraction of silver, tin, and copper from the mines. The preamble of the 1546 mining regulations of Berggie√üh√ºbel states that ::‚Ä≥in our silver and other mines, also otherwise in our lands and principality a notable want of iron is felt.‚Ä≥translated from a citation in: Schirmer, Uwe: √ñffentliches Wirtschaften in Kursachsen, S. 139. Hence, the rulers of the country established a monopoly on the iron trade already in 1472, and on this occasion also the Eisenkammer Pirna in order to ensure the supply of iron for the mines and arsenals. Accordingly, all iron products from the Pirna mining district (around 300 tonnes per year in the 16th century) had to be delivered to the Eisenkammer for a fixed price, and the latter sold them to the Dresden arsenal, the mines, towns, and guilds. For example, the saltworks of Poserna were built in 1572 using Pirna iron almost exclusively. The purpose of the monopoly was not profit, but the assurance of a sufficient supply of iron. Hence the iron trade turned out to operate with a loss, and in 1583 the Council of Pirna was ordered to take over the tasks of the Eisenkammer. Already 20 Saxon town were obligated to purchase their iron exclusively from Eisenkammer Pirna, and Prince-Elector Augustus now confirmed his order that all iron in the Electorate had to be procured from there. This, however, proved difficult to enforce. The historian Uwe Schirmer summarizes: \\"The purpose of the public economic activity in the small Pirna iron mining district thus conformed principally to the demand of the mines and salt works as well as to the politically-military and early mercantilist interests of the rulers of the country.\\"translated from Schirmer, Uwe: √ñffentliches Wirtschaften in Kursachsen, S. 141.

Plot Susan is arrested after Paul informs the police of his suspicions that she has poisoned him; the police find evidence of Susan's involvement (presumably planted by Felicia) in her apartment dumpster. The police ask Felicia to come in for questioning. After Mike tells Paul that Felicia had offered him $10,000 to kill Paul, the two attempt to confront her, and discover that she has apparently fled in haste. Lynette and Tom's weekend away aggravates their marital problems, since both repeat the behaviors that have led to their increasing estrangement. Gabrielle fears that she is being stalked by a strange man. She asks Bree for a gun; Bree refuses but advises her to take gun training classes and obtain legal permit. The first class goes badly, and she withdraws. After recognizing her stalker as the stepfather who raped her as a teenager, who she had been told was dead, she returns to the classes with renewed determination. Lee tells Bree that he recognizes her new detective beau as a gay man he has seen in local gay bars. Bree drops in on him at the police station, and her suspicions deepen. Paul and Mike inform the police of Felicia's disappearance; Paul withdraws his accusations against Susan, and she is released. Susan visits Paul to thank him; Paul tells her he is leaving the neighborhood, and returning the house to her, allowing her to move back in immediately. As Paul returns from packing his car, Felicia emerges from hiding and knocks him unconscious, binds him to a chair, and hooks him up to a poisoned IV drip. After a dinner date, Bree insists that Chuck take her to a gay bar, where several patrons and a waiter recognize him. Chuck tells her that he had worked undercover in the bar, and discloses that his marriage broke down because his wife had been having an affair with his police partner. When Paul regains consciousness, Felicia tells him he has only a short time to live before the poison kills him. She demands that he express remorse for killing her sister Martha. He admits killing Martha, declaring he was right to do so because her blackmail drove his first wife Mary Alice to suicide, a confession Felicia captures on a hidden camcorder. When Susan, unnoticed by Felicia, enters the house, she calls the police, then diverts Felicia, disconnects the IV, and removes some of Paul's bindings. Felicia returns and attacks Susan, but Paul breaks free and seizes her by the throat. Susan convinces Paul not to kill Felicia; he releases her, and Felicia runs away before the police arrive. Paul surrenders to the police. As Felicia is driving away, she loses control of her car when Beth's ashes fall over and as she tries to get them back she swerves her car into the other lane directly into the path of a truck and is killed in the collision.

History  NRK Klassisk was launched in Oslo on 1 June 1995 as the world‚Äôs first all-digital radio station (DAB), broadcasting 24 hours a day. The BBC and Swedish Radio, which launched their first digital radio stations in September 1995, caused NRK to bring forward its plans, so as to be the first in the world to use the DAB radio standard (Eureka 147). Right from the start, the channel was in operation 24 hours a day with a staff of six, in a totally digital programme chain from production via DAB transmitter to receiver. For broadcasting, the channel used the software BMS (Broadcast Media Server) from the Swedish company BCC. BMS made it possible to prerecord announcements through a digital mixer, together with jingles and background atmosphere, on the computer hard disk and to manage playback together with music recordings from CD and digital audio tape (DAT). The CDs were stored in juke boxes that held 360 each. Each juke box had two players, and when fully developed, NRK Klassisk had ten such juke boxes.  Present operation  NRK Klassisk staff broadcast morning programmes live. For the rest of the day and night, the system is programmed in shifts, so that the playlists are broadcast automatically. During holidays like Christmas and Easter, the broadcast of automatic playlists can go on for several days. The sound is kept uncompressed right up until the final coding to MPEG-1 layer 2 for transmission by DAB.

Plot Susan and Mike move back into their home on Wisteria Lane. When Susan attempts to visit Bree, Lynette and Gabrielle, each is preoccupied with personal matters and abruptly cuts the visit short. Susan returns home, visibly depressed. The other housewives, realizing they have upset her, visit her together and announce a progressive dinner party to celebrate her return, moving from house to house. Bree and Renee shop at the boutique run by Chuck's soon-to-be ex-wife; Bree hopes that making a large purchase will encourage her to more rapidly agree to the divorce terms. Instead, Bree and Renee inadvertently tip Doreen off to Bree's dating Chuck; while Doreen expresses sympathy, she uses her knowledge of the romance to make additional property demands. After Gabrielle's abusive stepfather Alejandro follows her in his car and trails her into a wooded area, she holds him at gunpoint and forces him to admit he raped her when she was a teenager. She allows him to leave, telling him never to contact her again. She later tells Carlos that she nearly killed him, but was satisfied by simply having been able to do so. That night, while hosting drinks and appetizers, Renee learns her ex-husband is remarrying. She quickly gets very drunk and strikes up a brief \\"relationship\\" with the bartender she hired for the evening. Lynette returns home to prepare the salad course. When Tom is not there, she concludes that he has moved out. When he arrives home from a brief shopping trip, the two discuss their estrangement. Lynette tells Tom that the main emotion she felt when believing he had left her was relief. The couple agree to separate. Chuck tells Bree that he has agreed to Doreen's increased demands to allow them to move on in their relationship. They go to Bree's home and make love, so distracted that Bree allows the dinner's main course to burn. The guests arrive almost immediately, and the semi-dressed couple makes excuses, to the evident amusement of the others. Gabrielle goes to her house to prepare the dessert course. Alejandro emerges from hiding, implies he has taken her gun, and accosts her, apparently intending to rape her. Carlos returns home and strikes Alejandro in the head with a candlestick, killing him. Bree, Susan and Lynette see the body, as Carlos discovers Alejandro did not have the gun. Carlos fears being sent to prison for killing an unarmed man. Bree takes the lead in covering up evidence of the killing in the short time before the remaining guests arrive. As the episode ends, Carlos has apparently forgiven Bree concealing her own son's responsibility for the hit- and-run death of his mother. Alejandro's body has apparently been hidden inside the storage chest which serves as the centerpiece of the evening's final course.

Quote: \\"In ancient Israel, premarital sex by a woman was discouraged because in the patriarchal society of that time, a daughter was her father's property. If she was not a virgin her value--the bride price her father would get from a prospective husband-- was diminished. Also, any child born to an unmarried woman would be fatherless --the Biblical term is \\"orphan\\"-- and so without either a male protector or any possibility of an inheritance, which was passed from father to son. There is no explicit prohibition in the Old Testament of premarital or extramarital sex by men except for adultery, which meant having sex with another man's wife.\\" Coogan affirms that premarital sex for women was \\"discouraged\\", but the Bible has a word for the sons of unmarried women, i.e. they were allowed to give birth to such sons, although their sons were relegated to an inferior social status. He also claims that Paul the Apostle condemned extramarital sex out of apocalyptic fears (he thought that the world was going to end soon) and that Jesus does not say anything about this, except regulating divorce between a man and one of his wives. Coogan does use therein the singular (\\"wife\\"), but does not say that a man could have only one wife, since Jesus was therein discussing the Law of Moses, which allowed for polygamy. Interviewed by Time magazine about this book, he also says that words often translated in the Bible as \\"sodomy\\" have often nothing to do with anal intercourse between men, and that according to sola scriptura, the Mormons were right about polygamy.Alexandra Silver What the Bible Has to Say About Sex Time.com, Reception The book was well received by Jessica Warner, from the University of Toronto, but was criticized by Prof. Phyllis Trible, from Wake Forest University School of Divinity in North Carolina.

Architecture  Built in 1891, this Romanesque Revival ecclesiastical architecture has cross gabled roofs, constructed of limestone blocks, rusticated externally with heavy timber framing members forming the roof trusses, nave ceiling with wood beams that are suspended from the roof trusses by 2 x 4 studs. It has several unique features, for instance the chancel is situated in the corner rather that the center of the sanctuary. When Second Presbyterian dedicated its new sanctuary on January 1, 1892, it was the largest church in America south of the Ohio River.  Civil Rights Movement  Throughout the 1960s, Clayborn Temple became the city's staging ground for the civil rights movement. In Memphis, the link between racial and economic injustices in the city became increasingly apparent. Memphis Labor Unions had tried for years to reform Memphis Public Works policies that included discrimination, unfair working conditions, and drastically insufficient wages. The deaths of two city sanitation workers, Echol Cole and Robert Walker on February 1, 1968, united the Sanitation Workers, labor unions, religious communities, and the black middle class to work together and create a grassroots movement in Memphis. On February 12, 1968, 1,300 Sanitation Workers went on strike from Memphis City Department of Public Works, led by T.O. Jones, a union organizer for AFSCME Local 1733, and Jerry Wurf, the national president of AFSCME. From this day forward, the strikers marched 1.3 miles each day from Clayborn Temple to City Hall. As they marched, other local organizations began to partner with them, preventing the Sanitations Workers‚Äô families from ever going hungry. These organizations included the Mallory Knights, the Invaders, and Community On the Move for Equality (C.O.M.E.), which was a group of 150 local ministers led by Reverend James Lawson. In the middle of this struggle for justice were Clayborn Temple's ministers. Rev. Ralph Jackson, the director of the A.M.E. Minimum Salary building next door to Clayborn, gave impassioned speeches to the supporters of the strike at Clayborn. The most consistent white supporter of the movement was Clayborn's pastor, Rev. Malcolm Blackburn. He opened Clayborn's offices, classrooms, and sanctuary to host the strategy meetings and community gatherings throughout the strike. In March 1968, after weeks of marching to City Hall from Clayborn Temple, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., came to Memphis in support of the sanitation workers‚Äô efforts. He had been invited by Reverend Lawson and C.O.M.E. to shine a national spotlight on their efforts in the fight for economic justice. Dr. King and organizers of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) helped to plan a strategic march with Dr. King leading the way. On Thursday, March 28, marchers began gathering at Clayborn Temple in anticipation of Dr. King. Nearly 15,000 marchers participated. Students from Memphis schools left the classroom to join the march. He arrived around 11:05 am, and they began the march with King and the sanitation workers, who had been marching this same path for weeks, in the front, while youths ran about throughout the march, pressing to get to the front. After marching only half a mile, the youth's agitation, derived from a rumor that the police had killed a Hamilton High Student earlier that morning, erupted into vandalism, looting, and rioting. The police reacted brutally to the riot, launching against both nonviolent protesters and the youth. Reverend Lawson and Reverend Jackson urged protesters to return to Clayborn Temple. The marchers retreated to Clayborn Temple, while police surrounded the building. ‚ÄúThe interior of Clayborn looked like the aftermath of a war,‚Äù Kathy Pittman Black reported. The entire building was filled with many injured and terrified protesters. The police attacked those that tried to the leave the church with mace, tear gas, and clubs. At one point, police even entered the church, swinging clubs and shooting tear-gas canisters. The day ended as 4,000 heavily armed National Guardsmen troops poured into the city. Two hundred eighty people had been arrested during the riot, and 60 were reported injured. One sixteen-year-old boy, Larry Payne died at the hands of a police officer that day, shot in the stomach after being suspected of looting. Payne's funeral was held in Clayborn Temple on April 2, 1968, and Rev. Harold Middlebrook said, \\"We really felt his death was related to the movement.\\" Despite police pressure to have a private closed-casket funeral in their home, the family held the funeral at Clayborn and had an open casket. Dr. King was rushed back to his hotel when the strike erupted into a riot on March 28, 1968. He vowed he would return to Memphis to lead a successfully peaceful march. King returned to Memphis a week later, but was assassinated on April 4, 1968 before his second march from Clayborn took place. On April 16, a deal was finally negotiated for union recognition and better wages for the sanitation workers. The strike had come to an official end. After King's assassination, Clayborn Temple remained a key refuge and meeting place for the Memphis Civil Rights Movement. The church was used extensively during the 1969 Black Monday protests, led by Ezekiel Bell and the NAACP. Black Mondays were designed to secure African American representation on the school board and further desegregate the public schools. In November 1969, mass meetings were held at Clayborn Temple while thousands of protesters led by Dr. King's successor, Reverend Ralph Abernathy, marched from the church which remained the epicenter of the Black Monday demonstrations until late November when a compromise was reached, with two African Americans appointed to the school board.  Disrepair and Restoration  As Clayborn's congregation began to grow smaller and smaller, the upkeep of the magnificent building was hard to manage. Eventually, though, the congregation moved from Clayborn, and it was left vacant by the AME for over a decade. Clayborn Temple Today Having been vacant for a number of years, a group of Memphians began the process of rehabilitating the church in October 2015.The Cornerstone of Clayborn Temple References External links  * Clayborn Temple's Official Website Category:Presbyterian churches in Tennessee Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Tennessee Category:Churches completed in 1891 Category:19th-century Presbyterian church buildings in the United States Category:Churches in Memphis, Tennessee Category:National Register of Historic Places in Memphis, Tennessee ","title":"Clayborn Temple"},{"id":"31576960","text":"The sport of association football in the country of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is run by the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Football Federation.

Education on- reserve is funded by the Government of Canada, while off-reserve education is funded by provincial or territorial governments. Several reports by the Auditor General of Canada, the Parliamentary Budget Officer, and other authorities have indicated an urgent need for improved funding for on-reserve education. Shannen's Dream advocates for the building of safe and comfy schools on reserves, and culturally based education for all First Nations children and youth. The movement was named in honour of Shannen Koostachin, a young activist from the Attawapiskat First Nation and a nominee for the 2008 International Children's Peace Prize The campaign is the subject of Alanis Obomsawin's 2013 documentary film Hi-Ho Mistahey!\\"TIFF 13: Alanis Obomsawin on Hi-Ho Mistahey!\\". Playback, September 13, 2013.  Shannen Koostachin  Shannen Koostachin was born in Attawapiskat First Nation on James Bay coast Ontario to Andrew Koostachin and Jenny Nakogee. She attended J. R. Nakogee Elementary School, which had been housed in makeshift portables since 2000, when it had been condemned and closed due to a decades-old fuel leak. Shannen then realized that the government was not giving proper funding to First Nations Aboriginal schooling systems around Canada, and that's when her dream/movement came to be. By 2007, the federal government had backed away from a third commitment to building a new school for Attawapiskat. In response, Koostachin and others turned to YouTube and Facebook to launch the Students Helping Students campaign for a school for Attawapiskat. Koostachin spoke out about the experiences of her community in newspapers, at conferences, and on the steps of Parliament Hill in 2008. In 2009, at the age of 14, she was nominated for the International Children‚Äôs Peace Prize. Koostachin and her older sister, Serena, moved hundreds of kilometres away from Attawapiskat to New Liskeard, Ontario, for high school. On June 1, 2010, Shannen died as a result of a car accident. A monument to Shannen Koostachin, with a statue depicting her dressed in regalia, was unveiled in New Liskeard in 2015. In 2017, Shannen was named one of 150 greatest Canadians. The list ‚Äî which also includes names like Terry Fox and Emily Carr ‚Äî was created to help celebrate Canada's 150th birthday. Shannen's Dream Campaign After Koostachin's death, those who had participated in the Students Helping Students campaign wanted to continue her fight. Shannen's Dream was formed, and is one of many social justice campaigns carried out by the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society. Shannen's Dream is a student- and youth- focused campaign designed to raise awareness about inequitable funding for First Nations children. It encourages supporters to write letters to their Member of Parliament, the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada, and the Prime Minister of Canada. To accompany this movement, Timmins-James Bay MP Charlie Angus reintroduced Shannen's Dream as Motion 201 to the House of Commons of Canada on September 26, 2011. On February 27, 2012, the House of Commons unanimously voted in favour of the motion.

From 1462 until his death, he was Duke of M√ºnsterberg, and from 1465 to 1485 Duke of Opava.  Family background  Victor was the second son of the Bohemian king George of Podƒõbrady and his wife Kunigunde of Sternberg. In 1463 he married Margaret Pt√°ƒçkov√°, the only daughter of Hynek Pt√°ƒçek of Pirkstein, who died in 1472. Two years later he married Sophie, daughter of Duke Boleslaw II of Cieszyn. After her death in 1479, he married in 1480 Helena-Margarete Palaiologa, daughter of John IV, Marquess of Montferrat (d. 1496). From these marriages, he had several daughters: * Johanna (1463‚Äì1496), married to Duke Casimir II of Cieszyn * Magdalena (d. 1497), Cistercian in Trzebnica * Anna (d. 1498) * Ur≈°ula (died after 1534) until 1529 nun in the Magdalene convent in ≈öwiebodzice * Apolonia (d. 1534), first Poor Clare in Strzelin, then married to Erhard of Queis and two sons: * Lawrence (Vav≈ôinec; d. 1503) * Bartholomew (c. 1477‚Äì1515), a prominent diplomat; died in a shipwreck on the Danube near Hainburg an der Donau; with him Victor's heirs in the male line died out  Life  Because Victor's older brother Boƒçek was mentally challenged, the duties of the first- born were transferred to Victor. Consequently, he had to stand by his father politically from a young age. His father asked emperor Frederick III to appoint Victor to imperial count, which the emperor did in 1449. In 1462, the appointment was confirmed and at the same time his younger brothers Henry the Elder and Henry the Younger were also appointed imperial count. A little earlier, George had appointed Victor and both Henries Dukes of M√ºnsterberg both of Opava (which he had acquired in 1464) and Counts of Kladsko. These areas were ruled by the brothers jointly until George's death in 1471. As a participant in the campaign against the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus Victor was captured by the Hungarians in 1469 in Moravia. He was released after two years, after paying a large ransom and secretly converting to Catholicism. After his release, he was a support of Corvinus for a while, After George's death in 1471, his sons divided the inheritance, according to a plan they agreed on in 1472. Victor received the Duchy of Opava. Later, his brother Henry the Younger gave him the Pless, which Victor then sold to his brother-in-law Duke Casimir II of Cieszyn. At the request of Corvin, Victor agreed in 1485 to a contract by which he had to give the Duchy of Opava to Matthias Corvinus's illegitimate son John, and received several castles in Slavonia in return. When Matthias died in 1490, Victor hoped that Opava would be returned to him, but that did not happen. Although the three brothers had sold the County of Kladsko in 1501 to their future brother-in-law Ulrich of Hardegg, they retained the title of Counts of Kladsko for themselves and their descendants until their extinction in the male line in 1647.

During his racing career, Eri-Aaroni became the holder of the Finnish harness racing speed record, a t√§htijuoksijaT√§htijuoksija, \\"star runner\\", record better than 30.0 per one kilometre; huippujuoksija, \\"top runner\\", record better than 35.0; suurjuoksija, \\"grand runner\\", record better than 40.0. Being both a race horse and more noble and refined in appearance than most Finnhorses of the time, he did not conform to the contemporary working horse ideals, and never gained great success at horse shows. Nonetheless, In 1946, the horse breeding association of Laihia purchased Eri-Aaroni to stand at stud for the unpreceded price of two million Finnish marks. In Laihia, he sired hundreds of foals, of whom 22 were t√§htijuoksija and five Kuninkuusravit title winners. Today, Eri- Aaroni is found in the pedigree of the majority of modern Finnhorses. Early life and racing career Eri-Aaroni was foaled on July 12, 1932. He was bred by Sulo Rintala in Sein√§joki. He was by a stallion who was a Ravikuningas title winner and t√§htijuoksija named Murto 2306, and out of the mare Upeva 1640-V, a 50.0-timed, well-conformed broodmare. The colt was brought as a weanling to Turku, and then purchased by, Albin Ahlqvist, who took him to √Öland. Eri-Aaroni grew to be a handsome and noble-looking horse who differed from the contemporary ideals of Finnhorse breeding, which favored a stockier, work horse look. Ahlqvist raced Eri-Aaroni occasionally at Turku. Eri-Aaroni was noticed there, and horse dealer Matti Takanen bought him from Ahlqvist for 75 000 Finnish marks. Then, in 1937, the well-known horseman Fritz Buttenhoff bought the now 5-year-old Eri-Aaroni from Takanen for 100 000 marks, corresponding to c. 34 000 Euros, and took the stallion to his estate in Vyborg.Raevuori 1982, p. 42 In Vyborg Eri-Aaroni was groomed, trained and raced by Arvi R√§ikk√∂nen. In 1939 Eri-Aaroni, now 7 years old, broke the t√§htijuoksija ghost limit of three minutes per two kilometres as he finished a heat held at Sein√§joki in 2 minutes and 59.9 seconds. By the end of the season he had improved his record to 2:28.2, or 29.1 calculated per one kilometre. His racing career came to a halt with the beginning of the Winter War, as Eri- Aaroni and his owner were evacuated to Suomenniemi and then Kirkkonummi. In August 1940 the stallion made a Finnish record with his 2:55.6 time for two kilometres (27.8). The record remained unbroken for nearly a decade.Raevuori 1982, p. 43 Before the war Eri-Aaroni had won dozens of full silver keepsake prizes and challenge cups, which were brought along with him. After the Continuation War began, Eri-Aaroni was raced very little: he participated in seven heats in 1941 and two heats the following year. The only war-time Kuninkuusravit championships were held in 1943. The event happened to take place during uneventful trench war, and R√§ikk√∂nen, who served in the Finnish ranks, was given furlough to drive Eri-Aaroni in the competition. Eri-Aaroni had finished third in 1939, and now won. Breeding career and influence During Eri-Aaroni's life, the official goal of Finnish horse breeding was to produce work horses. Eri-Aaroni's looks were \\"foreign\\", and although he did well in the obligatory pulling tests, he was not given any mentionable success in horse shows. In 1936, Eri-Aaroni was evaluated in a studbook inspection and accepted with the working section registration number 3423. The evaluation points awarded for him did not qualify him for even the lowest level prize. In 1939 he was re-evaluated and awarded with a third level prize. The best show success Eri-Aaroni gained as an individual was a second prize in 1946, when he had already proven his talent both as a record-breaking racehorse and a sire. After the Continuation War ended in 1944, parts of Kirkkonummi were rented by the Soviet Union to host a military base, and Eri-Aaroni was evacuated again. He ended up in Porvoo, and finally in Nastola.Raevuori 1982, p. 44 From his time in √Öland, he had sired about 300 foals. In 1946 the horse breeding association of Laihia made an offer to purchase him from Buttenhoff, despite the fact that the horse population in Laihia was already widely influenced by his sire, Murto.Toivonen 2008, p. 27 Buttenhoff agreed to sell as he had become disabled by rheumatoid arthritis, and R√§ikk√∂nen, the groom and trainer of Eri-Aaroni, was planning to become a farmer. Multiple horse breeding associations had expressed interest to purchase the stallion, but Buttenhoff chose to sell to Laihia because he heard the mare population of Laihia was of high quality.Toivonen 2008, p. 28 Eri-Aaroni was sold for 2 000 000 Finnish marks, corresponding to c. 680 000 Euros. It was the highest price ever paid for a horse in Finland. Eri-Aaroni proved to be successful at stud. During his first breeding season in Laihia, his pregnancy rate was 75.2 percent. He was accurate in detecting whether a mare was in oestrus or not, and did not attempt to serve pregnant mares.Toivonen 2008, p. 33 However, he also was uninterested in serving nursing mares, which was problematic.Toivonen 2008, p. 34 During the busiest peaks of breeding seasons Eri-Aaroni had to serve mares as often as every three hours, but as he ate well, he did not grow weak. I.P. Vipotiina (pictured leading) is a seventh-generation paternal line descendant of Eri-Aaroni and one of the many Kuninkuusravit title winners descending from him In Laihia, Eri-Aaroni sired dozen of foals each year, and more than 200 during the best years. His stud fee was exceptionally high, 15 000 marks, corresponding to about 5000 Euros. He sired more than 1100 offspring, of which 73 became suur-, 24 huippu-, and 22 t√§htijuoksija.Tammen suuri hevoskirja 3 p. 90-91 Of his first generation offspring, 4 stallions and 1 mare became winners of Kuninkuusravit titles; 6 stallions and 11 mares were made breeding champions; 167 stallions and 381 mares were accepted for the Finnhorse studbook. In state horse shows, Eri-Aaroni was finally rewarded when three times he was granted the first prize for his offspring. In 1952 he was one of the first horses to ever receive the title of a breeding champion. His influence in the Finnhorse breed remained significant, and by the 1990s, more than 90 percent of Finnhorses were descended from him via one or more lines. In 1952 the previously healthy and strong Eri-Aaroni suffered from colic a few times, although with good treatment he recovered well. However, in August 1953 he came down with a particularly dramatic case, which was further complicated by laminitis. Eri-Aaroni died on September 1.Toivonen 2008, p. 36 Pedigree Eri-Aaroni had unusually noble looks and in certain circles was suspected of not being purebred.Toivonen 2008, p. 35 As late as in 1992, Suomen kuvalehti published a story where a veterinarian named G√∂sta Broberg claimed it \\"commonly known today\\" that Eri-Aaroni had been foaled in Sweden by a warmblood trotter named David's Boy, and that he had been brought to Finland for slaughter value as a two-year-old. Nonetheless, the prevailing view held that Eri-Aaroni, with his dark chestnut color and prominent markings, strongly resembled Murto, who was properly credited to be his sire. Earlier Murto had been the target of similar suspicion.

Lancaster Barnstormers (second stint) On March 28, 2019, Eppley signed with the Lancaster Barnstormers of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He became a free agent following the season. On March 12, 2020, Eppley announced his retirement as an active player, and signed on as pitching coach for the Lancaster Barnstormers. Pitching style Eppley threw with an unusual sidearm delivery. He threw a four-seam fastball and sinker in the high 80s. He also had a slider in the low 80s and an occasional changeup. Eppley's low arm slot made him very effective against right-handed batters, but also largely ineffective against left-handed batters. It also allowed him to generate a very large number of groundballs.

It was written by Jack Burditt and the show's executive producers Robert Carlock and Tina Fey, who is also the series' creator, head writer, and star. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on April 21, 2011. Commemorating the 100th episode of the series, this episode was one hour long and included a multitude of guest stars including Michael Keaton, Tom Hanks, Rachel Dratch, Will Forte, Brian Williams, among others. In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) faces news of cancellation for TGS from Hank Hooper after the departure of Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) brought in terrible ratings. Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) promises Hank the return of Tracy and asks for one more chance for TGS to prove itself with its 100th episode. Meanwhile, a gas leak in the building leads to hallucinations among the characters, such as Jack's imaginings of alternate versions of himself visiting him. In a subplot, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) considers becoming a mother after a joke she made to Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) five years earlier. Plot Hank Hooper (Ken Howard), CEO of the fictional NBC parent Kabletown, informs Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) and Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) of his decision to cancel TGS in the absence of Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan). Jack supports Liz, informing Hank that Tracy is returning and convincing him to reconsider the cancellation until after their upcoming hundredth episode. Meanwhile, Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) suggests to Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) that she'd make a great mother, which causes her to have a hysterical pregnancy in order to augment her career. Tom the janitor (Michael Keaton) discovers a gas leak that is seeping into the ventilation system of TGS, necessitating the evacuation of all personnel and delaying production of the 100th episode. While repairing the gas leak, Tom inadvertently breaks the ventilation system on the 52nd floor causing Jack to hallucinate that he is visited by an alternate reality version of himself. Alternate Jack declares that he fired Liz because she was holding him back, and that without her he had made his way to the top of GE. As a consequence, Jack meets with Liz and severs their relationship. Liz is then approached by her ex-boyfriend Dennis (Dean Winters), whom she had apparently called while under the influence of the gas in an attempt to rekindle their relationship. Liz rejects Dennis, who subsequently realizes that he needs to sabotage the ventilation system again in order to get her back. Elsewhere, Tracy goes on multiple morning television shows in an attempt to sabotage the respect he has earned. Unfortunately, his attempts fail, as not only do the hosts interpret his crude behavior as artistic expression, but he also manages to save a man from drowning. Tracy discusses the problem with Jenna, and the two realize the only way he could ruin his public image is to shoot someone. Tracy convinces Kenneth to volunteer as his shooting victim on the roof of the building. As the gas spreads, Jack is visited by two more versions of himself - a past version who agrees with his original alternate version, and a future version who claims that he needs Liz to distract him from his blind ambition, and that he will be much happier if he doesn't fire her. He warns Jack that Liz is about to sign a lease with Dennis, which will lead to them getting married and living in Jacksonville, Florida. Jack finds Liz and prevents her from signing the lease. Meanwhile, Tom repairs the sabotaged gas line and Dennis is escorted out. Liz then tells Jack that she saw Kenneth and Tracy heading for the roof with a gun. Jenna joins them, and the group runs into Hank Hooper on the way, who pitches Jenna a daytime talk show, which causes her hysterical pregnancy to suddenly vanish in light of this new opportunity. They reach the roof just in time to prevent Tracy from shooting Kenneth, and Jack advises Tracy that the best way to lose respect as an actor is to return to television, giving a speech alluding to events from Baldwin's own career. Jack, Liz, Tracy, Jenna, and Kenneth make it back to the TGS set, where Liz discovers that the entire show was written under the influence of the gas and is essentially worthless. She breaks the gas line once again, and with Hooper and the entire studio audience affected by the gas, the show is a hit, and Hooper renews it for \\"a billion more episodes\\". Liz and Jack apologize to each other and toast their friendship with imaginary champagne. Tom Hanks, upon seeing Tracy back on TV while watching the episode at home, calls George Clooney (who does not appear) on a red phone and tells him to have Tracy removed from the \\"official A-list\\". Reception According to the Nielsen Media Research, this episode of 30 Rock was watched by 4.60 million households in its original American broadcast‚Äîwith 4.80 million watching the first half-hour and 4.44 million watching the last half hour. It earned a 2.2 rating/6 share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. This means that it was seen by 2.2 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 6 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. \\"100\\" received positive reviews. The A.V. Club gave the episode a B- grade, praising the characterisation but criticising some of the more implausible plot elements (such as the gas leak and Jenna's sudden yearning for children).

The format and competitiveness of the leagues have changed greatly since their beginnings in 1987. Likewise the leagues started off amateur but professionalism has since been permitted. However, it has always had three or four national leagues with various regional and county leagues below. Sunday Telegraph Merit Tables The Sunday Telegraph published Merit Tables for the leading English clubs from the 1960s to the 1980s. The position of the clubs was based on the percentage of matches won with only matches against other clubs in the table counting. Sunday Telegraph English Champions 1964 to 1987: *1963-64 London Scottish *1964-65 London Scottish *1965-66 Bristol *1966-67 London Welsh *1967-68 London Welsh *1968-69 London Welsh *1969-70 Coventry *1970-71 London Welsh *1971-72 Bristol *1972-73 Coventry *1973-74 Bristol *1974-75 Rosslyn Park *1975-76 Northampton *1976-77 Moseley *1977-78 London Welsh *1978-79 London Welsh *1979-80 Leicester *1980-81 Leicester *1981-82 Gloucester *1982-83 Coventry *1983-84 Wasps *1984-85 Bath *1985-86 Leicester *1986-87 Bath Precursor competitions While there were experiments with county leagues in the north in the nineteenth century for most of rugby union's history there have been no organised leagues. The 1970s saw the creation of a national cup and a series of regional and county merit leagues (the most important of which being the North, Midlands, South West and London merit league). In 1984 this was taken one step further with the creation of two national merit leagues for the top twenty four clubs (based around playing a minimum of sixteen fixtures against each other, a factor which led to Exeter's exclusion after consideration). The top division had three clubs from each of the major merit leagues. In these clubs had to play a minimum of eight fixtures against the other clubs in their division but it was largely based around pre-existing fixtures. There was a system of promotion and relegation between the Merit Tables. 1985 saw the addition of a third national merit table, albeit without promotion and relegation to the top two. 1984‚Äì85 season The initial lineups of the merit tables was as follows: Merit Table A *Bath *Bristol *Coventry *Gloucester *Gosforth *Harlequins *Leicester *London Irish *London Scottish *Moseley *Orrell *Sale Merit Table B *Bedford *Blackheath *Headingley *Liverpool *London Welsh *Northampton *Nottingham *Richmond *Rosslyn Park *Saracens *Wasps *Waterloo Merit Table A *Champions: Sale *Relegated: Coventry; London Irish; Orrell Merit Table B *Promoted: Headingley; Nottingham; Wasps 1985‚Äì86 This year saw the creation of Merit Table C with the following clubs: *Birmingham *Exeter *Fylde *Metropolitan Police *Morley *Nuneaton *Plymouth *Roundhay *Sheffield *Vale of Lune *Wakefield *West Hartlepool *Merit Table A *Champions:Gloucester *Relegated: Gosforth; Headingley *Merit Table B *Promoted: 1st Orrell; 2nd Coventry; *Liverpool merge with non-league St Helens to become Liverpool-St Helens *Merit Table C *Champions (not promoted): 1986‚Äì87 *Merit Table A *Champions: *Relegated to National 2: London Scottish *Merit Table B *Promoted into National 1: Waterloo *Merit Table C *Champions (not promoted): *Relegated to Area League North: Roundhay *Admitted to National 3: Maidstone Foundation of the national league system In 1987 the merit tables formed the basis of the top three divisions of the national league system. For the first season there were no fixed fixtures so clubs had to arrange their own (to a minimum of ten out of eleven opponents, only one game against each club could count). For the initial season there was no promotion and relegation between National 2 and National 3 but this was created for the following season. National 3 had a minimum of two clubs per region (with the top four clubs in the previous season's Merit Table C getting a guaranteed spot outside this quota) thus Roundhay missed out on a spot to Maidstone. In 1988 clubs had their fixtures set by the league for them though still only played each other once.

It also saw the creation of a promotion play-off between the runners-up of the National 3 divisions with an extra relegation place from National 2. A new Championship competition for the top eight clubs was introduced this season. It was intended that the winners of the Championship would become champions but this decision was revoked after outcry. This season also saw the introduction of the rugby union bonus points system.

Biography=Early life Antonia Garc√≠a was born in the working-class district of C√°diz, Spain, the oldest of three children, including Micaela Garc√≠a. She was descended from the House of Medina Sidonia of Cadiz through one of its branches in the south of Spain. She began singing at school. Although her parents supported her talent, they did not think it was in keeping with the family's noble origins. She was supported in secret by her paternal uncle, who always believed in her talent. At age 15 she participated in a Zarzuela company and sang traditional songs. She was put in contact with influential musicians of her time, and at festivals she met people like Ruperto Chap√≠ and Ger√≥nimo Gim√©nez.  Career  Garc√≠a's powerful voice was an asset at a time when there were no microphones, but only in her later years was she able to make a few recordings. Nevertheless, she made her name in the 1860s, and remains known as a result of being widely featured in both the Spanish and Latin American press. In 1894 in Buenos Aires she appeared as Do√±a Rita in La Verbena de la Paloma. She was later declared an adopted daughter of Buenos Aires, where a street was named in her honor. Her career spanned more than 50 years, from a role in a Zarzuela at the age of 12 until her retirement. She married very young, to a singer and actor from M√°laga, Don Salvador Videgain G√≥mez, with whom she had two children. She retired in 1908 from the theater industry but, in 1914, as a result of the misfortune of the fire of the Teatro Arriaga of Bilbao, she made the decision to re-launch her career briefly as a singer, mainly in festivals. Death Garc√≠a had suffered from diabetes since the late 1880s, which caused her to cancel some appearances. In 1918 she was diagnosed with severe diabetes; she died in her house in Madrid on June 25, 1924, and her remains are in the Cementerio de la Almudena in Madrid, in the same block as other famous artists of her time. Her style has influenced many female tango singers in Argentina, as well as many famous Spanish flamenco singers. She was a pioneer in international travel, having toured Brazil, Cuba, Argentina, and Uruguay. For her work as a recording artist, Garc√≠a entered the Paseo de las Luminarias in the city of Cuba, among many other places, and was \\"godmother\\" to a ship named after her.

He is noted for his books Aesthetics and Psychology (1935) and Des m√©taphores obs√©dantes au mythe personnel (1962). He was married from 1919 to 1949 to the writer Marie Mauron (1896-1986), and their home in Saint-R√©my-de-Provence became a focal-point in the inter-war years for their friends in the Bloomsbury Group.Mary Ann Caws and Sarah Bird Wright, Bloomsbury and France: Art and Friends, Oxford University Press, USA, 1999 Psychocriticism In 1963, Charles MauronDes m√©taphores obs√©dantes au mythe personnel conceived a structured method to interpret literary works via psychoanalysis. The study implied four different phases: # The creative process is akin to dreaming awake: as such, it is a mimetic, and cathartic, representation of an unconscious impulse or desire that is best expressed and revealed by metaphors and symbols. # Then, the juxtaposition of a writer's works leads the critic to define symbolical themes. # These metaphorical networks are significant of a latent inner reality. # They point at an obsession just as dreams can do. The last phase consists in linking the writer's literary creation to his own personal life. The author cannot be reduced to a ratiocinating self: his own more or less traumatic biographical past, the cultural archetypes that have suffused his \\"soul\\" ironically contrast with the conscious self, The chiasmic relation between the two tales may be seen as a sane and safe acting out. A basically unconscious sexual impulse is symbolically fulfilled in a positive and socially gratifying way, a process known as Sublimation.

She is the first woman to serve in that role and the only African-American woman to lead a college affiliated with the Adventist Church in the North America. Born in Jamaica, her family moved to the United States when she was nine. After completing her undergraduate degree at Oakwood College, she did her graduate work at Loma Linda University. She received her doctorate at Stanford University and pursued postdoctoral research at Harvard University. She began her career on the faculty of the University of the Pacific, becoming an award winning associate provost until she was asked to take over as provost at Andrews University. In 2009, she became the 21st President of Pacific Union College. Biography=Personal life Heather Joy Knight was born in Jamaica and lived there for the first nine years of her life. She immigrated to the United States, settling in the Bronx, New York, with her parents Austin and Herolin Evelyn. Knight is married to professor and outreach chaplain, Norman Knight. They have five sons and three daughters. Education Knight began her formal education while in Jamaica under the British system. After her family moved to the Bronx, New York, she attended the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School, featured in the 1980 Academy Award winning movie Fame and the 1982 TV Series, majoring in vocal performance. Knight began her undergraduate education at Howard University in Washington, DC but transferred a year later to Oakwood University, then known as Oakwood College, in Huntsville, Alabama where she graduated in 1982 with a bachelor's degree in English. Two years later, she got her master's degree in English from Loma Linda University in Loma Linda, California. In 1991, she received her doctorate, also in English, from Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. She completed postdoctoral studies in management and leadership in education at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Career=University of the Pacific Knight began her career at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California as a professor of English in 1988. She later became the assistant provost and then in 1997, the associate provost for Faculty Development, Diversity and Special Programs. During her time at the University of the Pacific, she is credited with leading the school's first Diversity Committee as well as spearheading a major initiative that is credited with nearly doubling the number of minority faculty at the University of the Pacific. In 1997, Knight became the youngest faculty member to receive the University of the Pacific's distinguished Eberhardt Teacher/Scholar Award. The award was established to reward exemplary teaching and scholarship. Andrews University In 2006, Knight was appointed provost of Andrews University in Berrien Springs, Michigan. Her work there involved oversight of Andrews various operations and academic enterprises. Knight was responsible for overseeing over 150 academic programs, 227 full-time faculty, 3,400 students studying on the Berrien Springs campus, as well as another 4,000 students studying in Affiliation and Extension programs around the world, and a $75 million budget. Pacific Union College Knight was selected as President of Pacific Union College in July 2009 and took office in September 2009. She was officially inaugurated on April 15, 2010 in a ceremony at the Pacific Union College Church. Her selection was historical, in that she is both the first black president and first female president in Pacific Union College history. Furthermore, she is the first (and currently only) black woman to lead a North American Adventist college. When Knight took over, Pacific Union College had experienced two consecutive years of decline in enrollment, however, in her first year as president enrollment increased by 11%. After taking over at Pacific Union College, Knight has been noted for her wide experience at both Christian and secular schools and her ability to build consensus between various constituent parties. In December 2010, Knight received an award from the local Chamber of Commerce recognizing her attentiveness to and willingness to work with the community. Knight completed her presidency at PUC in January, 2017. Educational philosophy=The Adventist Advantage In the second all-school colloquy of the 2009‚Äì2010 school year at Pacific Union College, Knight spoke on \\"Integrating Faith and Learning: A Higher Education Imperative\\" and her Adventist Advantage platform. She reported that institutions of higher learning are taking a fresh look at religion and spirituality and argued that it provides Adventist Education \\"with multiple opportunities to showcase what we have been doing so very well for so many years.\\" She introduced her theoretical framework to meet these opportunities, titled the Adventist Advantage. From Good to Great Heather Knight studied Stanford colleague Jim Collins' concepts outlined in his book Good to Great. Knight uses the 'good to great' idea as a theoretical framework for institutional improvement. Knight asserts that, \\"We are called to a really high level of excellence based on the exceeding excellence of God Himself. Therefore, we have an important role to play as pacesetters and models of best practices in higher education.\\"Pacific Union Recorder, January, 2011. The January, 2011 edition of the Pacific Union Recorder reports on renovations to the campus accomplished under Knight's leadership. Pacific Union College's dining commons and campus center, a major hub of student life, had not been updated in 30 years. The Recorder quotes Knight, \\"When I think about our campus going from good to great, I'm including every area of campus, including our facilities. My vision is that within the next several years the entire campus will be transformed.\\" Statement on Faith and Reason In late 2010, a biology professor at Pacific Union College was falsely accused of promoting theistic evolution, contrary to official church belief. This followed the controversy over the teaching of origins at La Sierra University over similar accusations. As president, Knight was quoted in a statement affirming Pacific Union College's commitment to church beliefs while emphasizing the school's dedication \\"to understanding contemporary issues surrounding science that sometimes conflict with specific theology.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Official page on Pacific Union College website Articles *Kellner, Mark A.

About long, it drains a rugged area of the Coast Ranges east of Big Sur before flowing through the agricultural Salinas Valley. Name \\"Arroyo Seco\\" means \\"dry streambed\\" or \\"dry wash\\" in Spanish. The river probably got its name because it disappears into the ground more than above its mouth for most of the year, however, it reaches the Salinas during the rainy season. The river above the Salinas Valley is actually a fairly large perennial stream. The common name, Arroyo Seco River or Arroyo Seco Creek, is actually a tautology because the name contains two mentions of \\"watercourse\\", thus \\"Arroyo Seco River\\" literally translates to \\"dry streambed river\\".Gudde and Bright, p. 18 Course The river rises in several unnamed forks in the Santa Lucia Mountains of the Coast Ranges near the Pacific Ocean. It flows generally north, cutting into a steep gorge, receiving Lost Valley Creek and Tassajara Creek both from the left. After the confluence with Rocky Creek, the Arroyo Seco swings abruptly east, passing a pair of intermittent natural lakes simply known as \\"The Lakes\\". Here, the valley begins to widen and the stream lazes out onto a shallower, sandier bed, passing the unincorporated communities of Millers Ranch and Sycamore Flat. Another major tributary, Piney Creek, enters just downstream of the former. Meandering east between low bluffs, the river receives Vaqueros Creek and Reliz Creek from the right, emerging from the mountains about southwest of Greenfield. The river flows north into the Salinas Valley, where much of its water is diverted for irrigation. Turning northwest, it begins to parallel U.S. Highway 101 as a seasonally dry wash. It joins the Salinas just south of the city of Soledad. The source, mouth and entire course of the river are entirely within Monterey County. There are no dams on the Arroyo Seco, making it prone to flash flooding. Watershed Draining , the Arroyo Seco River is the last major tributary of the Salinas River that enters before it reaches the Pacific. Most of the watershed lies in the rugged coastal range areas southwest of Greenfield and Soledad, and the drainage divide runs along the crest of the Santa Lucia Mountains to the west and the lower Sierra de Salinas to the northeast. Although the mountains are not particularly high, with the highest point just above sea level at Junipero Serra Peak, most of the basin nonetheless has great topographical relief, dissected by numerous canyons and ridges. Watersheds bordering the Arroyo Seco drainage are those of the Carmel River and Big Sur River to the northwest, multiple small creeks flowing into the Pacific on the west, the San Antonio River to the south, and other smaller tributaries of the Salinas on the east. Ecology Because of its relatively pristine condition, the Arroyo Seco River in the foothills and mountains supports a rich riparian zone habitat that is home to such sensitive species as the southwestern pond turtle and California spotted owl. The only perennial Salinas River tributary without dams, the river also supports a respectable run of steelhead trout, one of the last remnant populations along the Central California coast. Tributaries such as Tassajara Creek, Church Creek and Roosevelt Creek also maintain sizable populations of steelhead. The Arroyo Seco is considered a potential candidate for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers system. See also *List of rivers of California References Names.

Soaring Society of America, November 1983. USPS 499-920 Design and development The Woodstock was designed in the late 1970s by Maupin, with assistance from Irv Culver, who designed the airfoil for the wing. Culver's airfoil is of 18% thickness at the root, thinning to 13% thickness at the wing tip and incorporates no washout. The aircraft's design goals were low cost and simplicity of construction. Four design principles were employed: using the least expensive materials, using as little material as possible, keeping the design simple and utilizing as many common parts as possible. The resulting airframe is all-wood, with the major structural parts fabricated from Douglas fir. The tail and wing covering are birch. The wing and tailplane ribs are made in pairs from marine-grade fir plywood using a bandsaw. The wing spar is a hollow box for the first from the root and then changes to a \\"C-section\\" outboard. Top surface spoilers are provided. The main landing gear is an go- cart wheel mounted as a fixed monowheel, with a brake fashioned from aluminium sheet and employed as a band brake, actuated by a bicycle brake lever mounted on the control stick. Operational history The Woodstock won first place in the 1984 Sailplane Homebuilders Association design contest. In 1998 Gary Osoba won the US Region 9 Sports Class contest in his Woodstock. In April 1998, Osoba earned US National and World Records in the Ultralight Category for Straight Distance, Distance to a Goal, and Distance up to Three Turnpoints for a flight of 340 miles in his Woodstock.

It mainly consists of a trace of three separate striations.  Structure  The fault was first mapped by the Active Fault Research Group in 1991 as a complex of north-northwest-striking inactive traces of fault in the Hamad≈çri region. It has since been compartmentalized into separate striations near Tabito-cho west of Iwaki city. The northernmost and largest of the faultlines, the North Fault, was identified in 2009 and extends roughly 24 km (15 mi) from the southeast to the northwest (N45ÀöW). To its southwest, two parallel faultlines, the East and Shionihara faults, extend from the south-southeast to the north- northwest (N10ÀöW). The faultlines are separated by 1 km (0.6 mi) and span roughly 23 km and 22 km (14 mi), respectively. The westernmost of the two, the Shionihara Fault lies near Tabito-cho and borders the small village of Shionohira, after which it was named. The main structural trend is north- northwest-south-southeast, with sinking observed only to the south on the east side of the fault. Metamorphic rock and Cretaceous strata, as well as granite and epidiorite are distributed in the region; the fault is described as a limit to the distribution of tuff from the Neogene Period. Yunodake Fault To the northeast of the Idosawa Fault complex lies a separate normal fault trace, which was named the Yunodake Fault (also Yunotake) in 2011. Distanced approx. 50 km (30 mi) from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, the fault had been dormant for 120,000-130,000 before it ruptured during the magnitude 7.1 Mw Fukushima Hamadori earthquake on 11 April 2011. Several geological surveys have since been conducted in its vicinity. Evidence of sedimentary rock layers deposited after the Late Pleistocene beneath the fault suggests that the Yunotake Fault had been in the active in the past.  Notable earthquakes  * March 19, 2011: A magnitude 6.1 earthquake struck near Ibaraki Prefecture, with its hypocenter located near the Idosawa Fault. The earthquake occurred as a result of normal-faulting. * March 23, 2011: A magnitude 6.0 earthquake struck near northern Ibaraki. The quake occurred near the fault, with a focal mechanism of a normal-fault type. * April 11, 2011: A magnitude 7.1 earthquake with a depth of 10 km (6 mi) struck near Ishikawa, Fukushima. The quake occurred along the Shionihira Fault and caused a surface rupture of approx. 7 km (4 mi). In addition, a vertical displacement of 0.8-1.8 m was observed. * April 12, 2011: A magnitude 6.0 aftershock with a depth of 12 km (8 mi) struck near the same region along the Idosawa \\"North\\" Fault.

The Roman temple of Alc√°ntara is located at one side of the Alc√°ntara Bridge, C√°ceres, Extremadura (Spain). Along with the Roman temple of Vic, it is one of the only two Roman temples preserved nearly complete in Spain.  History  The bridge, triumphal arch and temple were all designed by the same architect, Gaius Julius Lacer, who dedicated the last to the deified emperors of Rome. He concluded his work in 103 AD. The origin of the architect appears to be local, but stylistically the features of the building appear closely related to contemporary buildings in the Italica province. This suggests that the architect either studied in what is today Italy, or was born there and later moved to the Lusitania province.http://web.educastur.princast.es/ies/arzobisp/Alumnos/HISTORIA/PDF/EL%20PUENTE%20ROMANO%20DE%20ALCANTARA.pdf The temple was constructed as an offering to Trajan and the gods of Rome. If still in use, the temple would have been closed during the persecution of pagans under the Christian emperors of the fourth century. After the conquest of C√°ceres in 1169 by Ferdinand II of Leon, the temple was converted into a chapel of St. Julian; one reason the building remains so well-preserved. The conversion saw the addition of a belfry and a skull with tibias. The temple would eventually become a milestone along the pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela.Revista de Folklore The architect was buried in the temple; his tomb is still preserved inside.  Architecture  Alc√°ntara is a small votive temple in antis, rectangular, with a single camera or cell. The temple is constructed of granite. The entrance is flanked by two Tuscan columns and accessed by an exterior staircase, covered with a gabled roof made of slabs of stone, with a pediment with trim at the edges and a smooth tympanum without decoration. The bill is reminiscent of the Treasury of Athens at Delphi. The bridge and temple are built with granite blocks of equal size. Inscriptions Presented in the lintel of the temple are inscriptions (now are not original, but subsequent copies as the last makes clear) attesting to the dedication by the architect Gaius Julius Lacer to the Emperor Trajan.

US Marines on reconnaissance patrol during a military exercise Depth of penetration Reconnaissance missions, within the scope of the battlespace, are characterized by the depth of penetration required, in terms of time, risk coordination, and support requirements. Information is gathered by commanders at all echelons and is used to prevent surprise, permit the timely maneuver of ground forces, and to facilitate the prompt and effective use of supporting arms. Depth of reconnaissance in relation to the battlespace. FEBA‚ÄîForward Edge of Battle Area FSCL‚ÄîFire Support Coordination Line Close Military commanders use forward platoon and company-sized elements of their own organic forces, to perform close reconnaissance (\\"short-range\\" reconnaissance), such as: the recon/scout platoons in infantry battalions; reconnaissance platoons in armored regiments/battalions; or \\"intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, reconnaissance\\" (ISTAR) companies that are organic to intelligence brigades/battalions. These mission normally are conducted in the area between the forward positions to the rear, extending forward of the \\"Forward Edge of the Battle Area\\" (FEBA) to the \\"Fire Support Coordination Line\\" (FSCL). This area is usually in the commander's Area of operation (AO). It is directed toward determining the location, composition, disposition, capabilities, and activities of enemy committed forces. Close reconnaissance covers the ground between the forward positions that are within the FEBA, to the rear of the zone covered by 'distant' (or medium) reconnaissance assets. Distant The units that provide distant reconnaissance (or known as \\"medium\\" reconnaissance) capabilities are usually organic to, or attached to regimental/brigade, division (military)-level, corps-level commands. It is usually directed toward determining location, disposition, composition, movement of supporting arms (i.e. artillery emplacement), and the reserve elements of the enemy committed forces. Distant reconnaissance is conducted between the FEBA, beyond the FSCL, to the rear of the commander's area of influence. Dedicated scouts serving with infantry, tank, artillery, engineer, or logistics units will generally position themselves about in advance of the forward units where possible. Modern-day commanders have units such as the U.S. Marine Corps Scout Sniper and Light Armored Reconnaissance units, or similar, at their disposal. Light armor such as Armored personnel carriers and light fast vehicles (similar to Sandrails) such as the Light Strike Vehicle are used with reconnaissance (scouting) units for much added armored protection, firepower, speed and mobility; to include, excellent communications, procurement of short- and long-range (remote) sensors, such as thermal imagery, ground surveillance radar and seismic sensors, [and if...] in range of the artillery fan, they have the much needed indirect fire support, when the need arises. In effect, these units are often replicate miniature combined-arms task forces (or battlegroups). Deep At the highest command level of a committed force or component (the division, corps, or field army- level), the force-level reconnaissance is employed to perform deep reconnaissance (or \\"long-range surveillance\\"), which is conducted beyond the force (or component) commander's area of influence to the limits of the area of interest (i.e. the geographical area from which information and intelligence are required to execute successful tactical operations, and to plan for future operations). Deep reconnaissance is oriented toward determining the location, composition, disposition, and movement of enemy reinforcements, combat support, and combat service support units, in order to shape and describe the battlespace. While almost every front-line military unit is sometimes assigned to do limited patrolling, or surveillance, of one kind or another, this kind of stealthy scouting‚Äîfar from friendly forward operating bases‚Äîis a particularly dangerous mission. Scouting specialist, or reconnaissance operators, may protrude as far as forward of the FSCL. In practice, reconnaissance or scouting platoons, typically of 20‚Äì40 men (4‚Äì6 men per squad/team), can probe beyond the FEBA, usually in means of from any friendly ground forces, however, this extreme distance excludes any advantages of operating under the supporting arms fan; such as naval gunfire or artillery support, but are not limited to close air support. In the United States Army, some brigades and divisions have separated, and structured into Long-Range Surveillance (LRS) units, which can go deeper beyond the front line; in which, the units are reorganizes into a Brigade combat team model with enhanced reconnaissance. As of 2007, however, scout specialists were being removed from some brigades, such as the Stryker Brigade.

Ershov numbers can be used in methods to optimally select registers when there is only one expression in a code block. Given an expression E = E1 op E2 the goal is to generate code so as to either minimize the number of registers used, or, if an insufficient number of registers is available, to minimize the number of nonregister temporaries required. The Ershov number n of a node in given expression tree is defined as follows: # Every leaf has n = 1. # For a node with one child, n is the same as child's. # For a node with two children, n is defined as: : n = \\\\begin{cases} max(child_1, child_2) & child_1 e child_2 \\\\ child_1 + 1 & child_1 = child_2 \\\\end{cases} The Ershov number of a node represents the minimum number of registers required to evaluate the subexpression whose root is that node. The idea is that we evaluate the child with the larger Ershov number first, then the other child, then perform the operation at the root.  Example  Suppose we have an expression tree with a '+' operation at the root, and the left and right subtrees have Ershov numbers of 3 and 4, respectively. The Ershov number of this node is 4, so we should be able to generate code for the expression using 4 registers. # Generate code to evaluate the right child using registers r1, r2, r3, and r4. Place the result in r1. # Generate code to evaluate the left child using registers r2, r3, and r4. Place the result in r2. # Issue the instruction \\"ADD r1, r2, r1\\". If there are not enough registers available? If the Ershov number of the root of the expression tree is greater than the number of registers then the Ershov numbers can be used to generate code using a minimal number of loads and stores, as follows: # generate code for the child with the larger Ershov number # issue an instruction to store the result in a temporary # generate code for the child with the smaller Ershov number # issue an instruction to load the temporary into a register # issue an instruction to perform the operation at the root See also *Strahler number, the minimum number of registers needed to evaluate an expression without any external storage *Sethi‚ÄìUllman algorithm, basically the same concept External links *Carleton University page on Optimal Code Generation and using Ershov numbers Category:Syntax Category:Software optimization ","title":"Ershov Number"},{"id":"31577304","text":"Shirley Krug (born January 29, 1958) is an American politician and public administrator from Wisconsin. A member of the Democratic Party, she represented Milwaukee in the Wisconsin State Assembly for 20 years, and was the first woman to serve as Democratic leader in the Wisconsin Legislature when she served nearly three years as Minority Leader. Early life and education Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Krug graduated from Milwaukee's John Marshall High School in 1975. She continued her education at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee earning her B.S. in economics, psychology, and anthropology in 1981 and M.S. in economics in 1983. Career=Academic Krug was an Adjunct Professor of Economics at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìParkside before becoming a Member of Board Directors of the German American National Congress. She then served on the Lincoln Creek Steering Committee, the Friends of Havenwoods, Sierra Club, The Nature Conservancy, and on both Alumni and Student Association at UWM. While serving on those committees she was a recipient of numerous awards from Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the Lutheran Social Services, the Women's Network, the Environmental Decade and the Coalition Against Domestic Violence. Assembly Member Shirley Krug was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1984 and served from 1985 until 2005. During her time in office she was responsible for passing such legislations as Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect, Crime Victims Rights' Enabling Legislation, reforms on Children in Need of Protection or Services and temporary restraining orders, Mental Health Consumer Protection Act, Full Funding for Earned Income Tax Credit and Mandatory Arrest for Domestic Violence. In 1998, when long-serving Democratic floor leader Walter Kunicki announced he would stand down from his leadership role, Krug was elected as his successor, narrowly defeating Kenosha representative James Kreuser. Following the Democrat's disappointment in the 2000 election, however, Krug's leadership was challenged and, in May 2001, she was replaced by Madison representative Spencer Black. Her defeat as leader was seen as a repudiation of the Democratic Leadership Council, which she was perceived to be aligned with. Shortly after losing her leadership post, Krug was embroiled in a minor scandal in the Legislature in which several legislators of both parties were implicated in the use of state resources on political activity, though no charges or reprimands occurred as a result of the investigation. In 2004, Krug announced she would not seek re-election for the Assembly, but would instead run for United States House of Representatives in the 4th congressional district, where Jerry Kleczka had just announced his plans to retire. Krug, however, abandoned her congressional campaign after EMILY's List endorsed her Democratic primary opponent, Gwen Moore. Later years Since leaving the Assembly, Krug has worked at a number of administrative jobs in the City of Milwaukee, as a commissioner for the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewage District, as budget chief for Milwaukee's Department of Public Works, and as a commissioner on Milwaukee's Social Development Commission.

He was given the project of developing a motorized fire extinguishing service, and in 1908 he produced the first engine-powered hose truck. In 1923 he became chief fire commissioner in Berlin.Zenter, Christian and Bed√ºrftig, Friedemann (1991). Encyclopedia of the Third Reich, p. 319. New York: Macmillan. Gempp was head of the Berlin fire department at the time of the Reichstag fire on 27 February 1933, personally directing the operations at the incident. On 25 March he was dismissed for presenting evidence that suggested Nazi involvement in the fire. Gempp asserted that there had been a delay in notifying the fire brigade and that he had been forbidden from making full use of the resources at his disposal. In 1937, he was arrested for abuse of office. Despite his appeal, he was imprisoned. He was later strangled and killed in prison.

The Index List was originally made on paper index cards, first compiled by J. Edgar Hoover at the Bureau of Investigations before he was appointed director of the FBI. The Index List was used to track U.S. citizens and others believed by the FBI to be dangerous to national security, and was subdivided into various divisions which generally were rated based on different classes of danger the subject was thought to represent. There is no indication the FBI stopped adding names onto its Index List before September 11, 2001.Curt Gentry, \\"J Edgar Hoover : The Man and the Secrets\\". New York; W W Norton &Company;, 2001. After September 11, 2001, the date which the FBI folded its Index List into the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) is unknown, while the FBI consolidates the TSDB from other lists and manages its information. The TSDB blacklist is currently available to all U.S. national security agencies, while select information contained on the TSDB is forwarded to other nation states and international security agencies.https://theintercept.com/2014/07/23/blacklisted/  General Intelligence Division  Around the time of World War I and the First Red Scare, William J. Flynn of the Bureau of Investigation had J. Edgar Hoover set up a General Intelligence Division (GID). Hoover used his experience working as a library clerk at the National Archives to set up the system using extensive cross-referencing. The GID took files from the Bureau of Investigations (later renamed the Federal Bureau of Investigation) and 'systematized' them via index cards; according to Walker and contrary to evidence, the cards covered 200,000 people. But by 1939, Hoover had more than 10 million people 'Indexed' in the FBI's domestic file system. Although the GID was shut down in 1924 after objections from people such as William J. Donovan who called into question its constitutionality, Hoover and the FBI continued to expand the Index system for use by the agency, by Hoover, and by Hoover's political associates well into the 1970s. Today, the Index files covering untold numbers of Americans are still accessible by the FBI and its 29 field offices. Titles to numerous Index catalogs include: The Reserve Index, for influential people to be \\"arrested and held\\" in case of a national emergency; The Custodial Index, which included 110,000 Japanese Americans that were held in internment prison camps during World War II; The Sexual Deviant Index; The Agitator Index; The Communist Index; and The Administrative Index, which compiled several other earlier indexes. Even though a complete list of Index titles is currently unavailable, Hoover and the FBI used their Index system to catalog Native American and African American liberation movements during the 1960s and 1970s, as well as Vietnam War protesters and other college students.  Custodial Detention Index  The Custodial Detention Index (CDI), or Custodial Detention List was formed in 1939‚Äì1941, in the frame of a program called variously the \\"Custodial Detention Program\\" or \\"Alien Enemy Control\\". J. Edgar Hoover described it as having come from his resurrected General Intelligence Division in Washington. According to Hoover, it created large numbers of files on \\"individuals, groups, and organizations engaged in subversive activities\\", including espionage, and enabled the Bureau to immediately identify potential threats. Congressmen Vito Marcantonio called it \\"terror by index cards\\". Senator George W. Norris complained as well. The Custodial Detention Index was a list of suspects and potential subversives, classified as \\"A\\", \\"B\\" and \\"C\\"; the ones classified as \\"A\\" were destined to be immediately arrested and interned at the outbreak of war. Category A were leaders of Axis-related organizations, category B were members deemed \\"less dangerous\\" and category C were sympathizers. The actual assignment of the categories was, however, based on the perceived individual commitment to the person's native country, rather than the actual potential to cause harm; leaders of cultural organizations could be classified as \\"A\\". The program involved creation of individual dossiers from secretly obtained information, including unsubstantiated data and in some cases, even hearsay and unsolicited phone tips, and information acquired without judicial warrants by mail covers and interception of mail, wiretaps and covert searches. While the program targeted primarily Japanese, Italian, and German \\"enemy aliens\\", it also included some native-born American citizens. The program was run without Congress-approved legal authority, with no judicial oversight and outside of the official legal boundaries of the FBI. A person against which an accusation was made was investigated and eventually placed on the index; it was not removed until the person died. Getting on the list was easy; getting off of it was virtually impossible. According to the press releases at the beginning of the war, one of the purposes of the program was to demonstrate the diligence and vigilance of the government by following, arresting and isolating a previously identified group of people with allegedly documented sympathies for Axis powers and potential for espionage or fifth column activities. The list was later used for Japanese American internment after Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066. Although some say Hoover actually opposed those measures, Hoover and the FBI created the list from which 110,000 people were interned, 70,000 of which were American-born. Attorney General Francis Biddle, when he found out about the Index, labeled it \\"dangerous, illegal\\" and ordered its end. However, J. Edgar Hoover simply renamed it the Security Index, and told his people not to mention it.  Rabble Rouser Index  Records of people added to the Rabble Rouser Index are available online from The Vault, which hosts the FBI's FOIA Library, under FBI case file 157-HQ-7782. The Internet Archive maintains a copy of this information with additional explanatory material. In addition, a repository of FBI files obtained under FOIA request, including the Rabble Rouser Index, is maintained at the National Archives.  People  Notable people include: * Saul Alinsky ‚Äî political theorist * James H. Madole ‚Äî National Renaissance Party * Floyd B. McKissick ‚Äî SNCC * Jerry Rubin ‚Äî anti- war activist * Adam Clayton Powell Jr. ‚Äî NY Congressman * John A. Wilson ‚Äî Washington DC council member  Categories  Notable categories listed on FBI form FD-307 include:  Reserve Index/Security Index  The Security Index pertained to the FBI list of dangerous individuals who might commit acts inimical to the national defense and public safety of the United States in time of emergency. The list also included those who could be arrested upon the order of a U.S. President invoking the Emergency Detention Program. The Reserve Index, on the other hand, listed all left-wingers and individuals suspected of being a Communist. By 1950s, for instance, there were 5,000 names under the Security Index while the Reserve Index had 50,000 in the Chicago field office. An individual in the Reserve Index could be transferred to the Security Index if such individual posed a threat to U.S. interests in a period of national emergency. A difference between these indices involved their color scheme. The files of those under the Security Index were all in white while the Reserve Index varied in colors depending on the occupation of the subject. Prominent figures listed in the Reserve Index include Martin Luther King. The FBI had been monitoring his activities with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference since 1957 and by 1962, he was finally listed in the FBI index due to the involvement of two of his advisers with the U.S. Communist Party, although he failed to meet the criteria for inclusion in the Security Index. The Security Index itself was merged with the Agitator Index and the Communist Index. Renamed to the Reserve Index in 1960, this index included a Section A for teachers, doctors, lawyers, entertainers, and other people considered influential and not politically conservative. Hoover had Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. added to the Reserve Index, Section A, in retaliation for his civil rights work and worldwide popularity. Renamed again to the Administrative Index (ADEX) in 1971, and allegedly discontinued in 1978, the records are still kept as inactive at FBI headquarters and 29 field offices.  Administrative Index  FBI rep describing ADEX, 1975 ADEX, or Administrative Index, lasted from 1971 to January 1978. It integrated the Security Index, the Agitator Index, and the Reserve Index. It was used to track people \\"considered to be a threat to the security of the country\\". ADEX had four 'categories'. An illustrative example of these files and the rationale for categorization can be seen in the case of historian Howard Zinn, a noted government critic. In his FBI files, there are two separate pages in which an agent says he should be in category III: > He has been a member of the Communist Party, 1949‚Äì1953. A chief critic of > the United States Government policies. A familiar figure at anti-war > demonstrations up to 1972. Organized a protest rally to protest serious > indictments against Father Berrigan and other members of the East Coast > Conspiracy in the Summer of 1971 > It is recommended that subject be included in ADEX, Category III, because he > has participated in activities of revolutionary organizations within the > last five years as evidenced by overt acts and statements established > through reliable informants Singer Paul Robeson was also on ADEX as Category III: \\"because of his long time close contact with CPUSA leaders. He was honored by the CP as recently as 1969\\".

The Tejano Music Awards, first bestowed in 1981, was established to recognize the most talented performers of the genre‚Äîa subcategory of regional Mexican music, with roots in the music of early European settlers in Texas. The awards are presented by the Texas Talent Musicians Association (TTMA), to \\"promote excellence in the Tejano music industry\\" using the popular vote method to select the winner of the female vocalist of the year. Historically, female musicians fared less favorably in the male-dominated genre and were seen as inferior to their male counterparts. The award was established by Rick Trevino, a male Tejano performer, who founded the Awards in 1981. The award was first presented to American singer Lisa Lopez. Laura Canales won the award five nonconsecutive times, and is considered Tejano music's first leading lady before the genre's golden age in the 1990s. Selena holds the record for most wins, winning 11 of her 12 nominations. The singer has been called the Queen of Tejano music, and is credited with catapulting the genre into the mainstream market. Following her death in March 1995, the genre suffered and its popularity waned. In 1998 Shelly Lares won for the first time since she was initially nominated in 1986. She holds the record for most nominations at 28. The following year Jennifer Pe√±a won the award; the first time the award was won by two different participants since 1982. The current award holder is Elida Reyna who has the record for most consecutive wins - ten.  Background and nomination process  Tejano music is a blend of polka, jazz, rhythm and blues, and country music, with influences of American pop music. Early European settlers introduced the accordion and bajo sexto, one of the major musical components used in the genre, to the state of Texas. Tejano music has since been urbanized with the introduction of keyboards and synthesizers. Historically, female musicians were seen as inferior and less successful commercially than their male counterparts, and were often turned down by music concert organizers who wanted sellouts. The female vocalist category was introduced at the first awards ceremony which was pioneered by Rick Trevino, a male Tejano musician, in 1981. Nominees were originally selected by a voting poll conducted by program directors and disc jockeys at Spanish-language radio stations in Texas. Winners were previously chosen by Tejano radio station KIWW listeners in the 1980s, and later by fans of Tejano musicians in the Southwest of the United States. Currently, winners are selected through a survey of 50,000 Texas households with Hispanic surnames, though anyone with Internet access is eligible to vote on the official website page. By 1987, the awards ceremony was broadcast by 32 radio stations and 25 local television channels in Texas, New Mexico, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana. The awards ceremony was originally held at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center, then at the San Antonio Convention Center until 1994, and the Alamodome until 1999. As of 2015, the ceremony is held annually at the Tobin Center for the Performing Arts in San Antonio, Texas.  Recipients  Tejano singer Jennifer Pe√±a, winner in 1999, 2001, and 2003. The award was first presented to American singer Lisa Lopez, who had a US Billboard Regional Mexican Airplay number one single with \\"Si Quieres Verme Llorar\\" (1982). Lopez' core audience was Mexicans, and she became the first female Tejano singer to appear on the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart in October 1986. Laura Canales, who popularized grupos in the 1970s, won the award five nonconsecutive times. She was considered Tejano music's first leading lady before the genre's golden age in the 1990s. At the sixth Tejano Music Awards (1986), Female Vocalist of the Year nominees included newcomers Shelly Lares and Selena who were up against veteran winner Canales.

From 1653 to 1680 he lived in the City of London and taught Hebrew. In 1680 he was appointed university teacher of Hebrew at Cambridge at a salary of ¬£20 a year.

Intended to perform technology demonstration experiments in low Earth orbit, it was lost during launch in March 2011 when the rocket that was carrying it failed to achieve orbit. Hermes was a single- unit CubeSat picosatellite which was primarily designed to test communications systems for future satellites. It was intended to test a new system which would allow data to be transferred at a higher rate than on previous satellites, thereby enabling future missions to return more data from scientific experiments or images. A secondary objective was to have seen tests performed upon the satellite bus, which was to have served as the basis for future COSGC missions. The satellite would also have returned data on the temperature and magnetic field of its surroundings. Hermes was launched by Orbital Sciences Corporation using a Taurus-XL 3110 carrier rocket flying from Launch Complex 576E at the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. It was a secondary payload on the launch, with the primary payload being the NASA Glory spacecraft. The KySat-1 and Explorer-1 [Prime] satellites were launched aboard the same rocket. The launch took place at 10:09:43 UTC on 4 March 2011, and ended in failure after the payload fairing failed to separate from around the spacecraft just under three minutes after launch.

He was educated at the rabbinical college in his native city, studying not only Talmud, but also medicine. After having been granted the degree of doctor and the title of \\"Rab\\", he lectured on Talmudic law in Safed. His fame as a physician spread far and wide, and finally reached the ears of the Sultan Murad III, who summoned him to Constantinople as court physician. Yerushalmi subsequently became a convert to Christianity; he went to Rome, and was received at the College of the Neophytes, where he taught Hebrew. During the most active period of the expurgation of Hebrew books under the Inquisition in Italy Dominico's services were in great demand; and first in Venice (1578-92?), later as chief reviser of the censorship commission in Mantua (1595‚Äì97), he had opportunity for placing his signature in more books and manuscripts than any other of the Italian expurgators.

Dominico's works included, according to his own statement, Ma'ayan Gannim (\\"Fountain of the Gardens\\"), on the fundamental principles of the Christian faith, lost already a few years after Domenico's deathBlokland, D. (2019),The Gospel according to Matthew in the Translation of Domenico of Jerusalem, a Jew who Became a Christian, Dissertation Hebrew University. He also translated into Hebrew the whole of the New TestamentFull text of the Gospel of Matthew in Blokland, D. (2019),The Gospel according to Matthew in the Translation of Domenico of Jerusalem, a Jew who Became a Christian, Dissertation Hebrew University, and most of the Apocryphal books (1615‚Äì17). He was the compiler of the Sefer ha-Zi·∏≥·∏≥u·∏≥ (\\"Book of Expurgation\\")Prebor, G. (2008) \\"Sepher Ha-Ziquq\\" by Domenico Yerushalmi, Jerusalem : The Hebrew University Magnes Press . Italia ; 18, 7-302 (Hebrew)., still in manuscript, one copy of which (in the library of Cardinal Berberini, now part of the Vatican Library in Rome) shows revision by him as late as 1619. The record of Dominico's conversion has been discovered, dated 6 August 1593 in Venice. The seventeenth century authors Giulio Bartolocci and Johann Christoph Wolf state that Nicolaus Mursius in his Relatione della Citt√† di Constantinopoli (Bologna, 1671) mentions as court physician of the Turkish sultan a Jew who later became converted under the name of \\"Dominico Ierosolymitano\\". Wolf holds that he is identical with the subject of this article; Bartolocci, on the other hand, states that Mursius speaks of one whom he (Mursius) had himself seen in his travels, and who was still living as a Christian in Constantinople in direst poverty, though as a Jew he had held, under the name of Pelaso, third place among the sultan's physicians.

Klare (1922‚Äì2006) George R. Klare (1922‚Äì2006) was a World War II veteran and a distinguished professor of psychology and dean at Ohio University. His major contribution was in the field of readability. From the beginning of the 20th century, the assessment of the grade level of texts for different grades of readers was a central concern of reading research. It was well known that without correctly graded texts, readers would not improve their reading skill. There were over 1,000 published studies on this topic. Klare's contribution to that effort came both in his critical reviews of the studies and his participation in original research. Early life George R. Klare was born April 17, 1922, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, son of George C. Klare, and Lea L. (Launer) Klare. He served as senior class president in North Bend High School in North Bend, Nebraska and graduated from that school in 1940. He received a Regents Scholarship to the University of Nebraska, where he studied before being called into the Army Air Force in 1942. He then took more college and officer training at the University of Missouri. anon. 2006. \\"George Klare dies at 84,\\" The Messenger, Athens, Ohio. March 6. World War II Following military and flight training, Klare served as a navigator on B-17 bombers in the Eighth Air Force in England. On Dec. 31, 1944, he was shot down over Germany. He spent the rest of World War II in German POW camps. He was liberated by advancing Soviet troops from Stalag Luft One on May 1, 1945. He was honorably discharged as a First Lieutenant in December, 1945, receiving the Air Medal, the Purple Heart, European area ribbons and the Prisoner of War medal. Klare later recounted his experiences as a prisoner of war in a chapter entitled \\"Questions\\" in Interrogations, Confessions, and Entrapment, published by Springer in 2004. In this extraordinary account, Klare tells how he narrowly escaped death three times on January 3, 1945. While on a railroad car en route to the Luftwaffe Interrogation Center, Klare survived a friendly-fire bombing in the rail yard in Fulda, Germany, the target on this third mission one week earlier. Klare and his crew were ordered by a German guard to remove packages from the Fulda freight station that was on fire from the Allied bombing. The guard then ordered the men out of the burning building just before it collapsed. A crowd of angry German civilians soon gathered near the collapsed freight station. The German guard, who was an English-speaking Luftwaffe captain, was armed only with a pistol. Yet he managed to hold off the mob and take Klare and his crew to a safe building. \\"I owe my life to him,‚Äù Klare wrote. ‚ÄúHe was the bravest man I ever saw.‚Äù Klare remained active in veterans' issues the rest of his life. His contributions include: * A Few Good Men. * Veterans History Project. * WOUB Online: WWII Veterans. * In addition to his chapter in Interrogations, Confessions, and Entrapment,he published several magazine articles about the psychological effects of war. His wartime writings were reprinted in The Haunting Memories of War, a dual memoir co-authored with his son Roger.Klare, G. R. and R. Klare. 2012. The Haunting Memories of War: A Memoir of Father and Son. Bloomington, Indiana: Lulu Press. Academic life After World War II, Klare earned a BA degree cum laude in 1946, a MA degree in 1947, and a PhD degree in 1950 in psychology from the University of Minnesota. After working for The Psychological Corporation in New York City and the University of Illinois, he became an assistant professor of psychology in 1954 at Ohio University. It was during that period, he published, with Byron Buck, Know Your Reader: The Scientific Approach to Readability. This work introduced to the public the extensive research behind the popular readability formulas of the likes of Rudolf Flesch and Robert Gunning. The book showed the average reader in America was an \\"adult of limited reading ability,\\" with half the population reading below the 9th-grade level. The readability formulas could be used to select and create literature and texts of different reading levels. Without appropriately graded texts, people will not read or improve their reading skill.Klare, G. R. and B. Buck. 1954. Know Your Reader: The Scientific Approach to Readability. New York: Hermitage House. His other books include Elementary Statistics (with P. A. Games),Klare, G. R. and P. A. Games. 1967. Elementary Statistics: Data Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences.

How to Write Readable English. London: Hutchinson. and The Measurement of Readability.Klare, G. R. 1963. The Measurement of Readability. Ames, Iowa: Iowa State University Press. He also published 85 articles and book chapters. Klare won a Fulbright grant to the Open University of England. He also won the Best of Show award in the Journal Article Competition of the International Technical Communication Conference in 1978 and the Oscar S. Causey Award for Outstanding Contributions to Reading Research in 1981, and was elected to the Reading Hall of Fame of the International Reading Association in 1997. He served on the editorial boards of eight journals, as well as The Literary Dictionary. He is listed in Who's Who in America and was listed in the Fourth Edition of Who's Who in the World. In 1978, he was named Distinguished Professor of Psychology. While at Ohio University, he served as chair of the Psychology Department from 1959 to 1963, as acting dean of the College of Arts and Sciences in 1965‚Äì66 and in 1984‚Äì85, and as Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences from 1966 to 1971. He was also acting associate provost for graduate and research programs from 1986 until his retirement in 1987. Reading research Most of the basic research on the readability formulas was done in the first half of the 20th century. The later half was a very contentious period in reading research (especially regarding phonetics). In spite of the controversy, Klare and a few colleagues persisted and focused on: * Consolidation and confirmation of earlier research. * Developing new formulas and fine-tuning older ones. * Other variables affecting readability besides the grade-level of text. * Features of the reader affecting readability. As the unofficial chronicler of this ongoing research, Klare published four landmark reviews, The Measurement of Readability in 1963, \\"Assessing Readability\\" in 1975 (which was named a Citation Classic by the Institute for Scientific Information),Klare, G. R. 1974‚Äì75. \\"Assessing readability.\\" Reading research quarterly, 10:62‚Äì102. \\"Readability\\" in 1984.Klare, G. R. 1984. \\"Readability.\\" Handbook of Reading Research, ed. P. D. Pearson.

Later, as the U.S. military invested heavily in readability research, he participated in several important studies that showed the usefulness of readability formulas in improving the 1. comprehension, 2. retention, 3. reading speed, and 4. reading persistence of technical manuals and instructional materials.Klare, G. R., J.E. Mabry, and L. M. Gustafson. 1955. \\"The relationship of style difficulty to immediate retention and to acceptability of technical material.\\" Journal of educational psychology, 46:287‚Äì295.Klare, G. R., E. H.

R., and K. L. Smart. 1973. \\"Analysis of the readability level of selected USAF instructional materials.\\" The journal of educational research, 67:176. Klare also conducted or participated in research on the features of the reader that effected readability: 1. prior knowledge, 2. level of reading skill, 3. interest, and 4. motivation.Entin, E. B. and G. R. Klare. 1985. \\"Relationships of measures of interest, prior knowledge, and readability to comprehension of expository passages.\\" Advances in reading/language research, 3:9‚Äì38. In one 1976 analysis of 35 readability experiments, Klare showed how important it is to control for these variables when doing reader research.Klare, G. R. 1976. \\"A second look at the validity of readability formulas. An invited essay.\\" Journal of reading behavior, 8:129‚Äì52. The century ended with a more complete view of those variables affecting reading success, much of it due to Klare's efforts. Readability, it turned out, is not an absolute residing in the text, but is a product of the interaction between the reader and the text. In the text, those variables that affect readability are 1. content, 2. grade level (style), design, and organization. In the reader, the variables are 1. prior knowledge, 2. level of reading skill, 3. interest, and 4. motivation. George R. Klare died on March 3, 2006, at his home in The Plains, Ohio, from pneumonia at the age of 83. He was survived by his wife, Julia M. Klare; a daughter, Deborah Fox of Vero Beach, Fla.; a son, Roger, and daughter-in-law, Connie Schmittauer, of Dublin, Ohio; and a daughter, Barbara, and son-in-law, Galen Fultz, of San Anselmo, Calif. He has a grandson, McCoy, and a granddaughter, Zoe, also of San Anselmo; a granddaughter, Sivan, of Portland, Ore.; and a step-sister, Dorothy Launer, of Fremont, Neb.

Its repertoire specialises in cabaret and popular songs of the Weimar period in Germany and in American popular songs of the same era. The orchestra performs around 120 concerts per year. History Max Raabe founded the orchestra with fellow students at the Berlin University of the Arts in 1985. The ensemble initially used music arrangements that Raabe found whilst shopping at various flea markets. The orchestra worked for one year on learning these arrangements without any public engagements or performances. The orchestra gave its first public performance at the 1987 Berlin Theaterball, in the lobby as a secondary act, but with such success that the audience left the ballroom to hear the orchestra's performance in the lobby. The ensemble had its first song hit 5 years later, an original song by Raabe, \\"Kein Schwein ruft mich an\\". The members of the orchestra are all men, with the single exception of the violinist, who has always been female. The violinists who have served with the Palast Orchester have included: * Michaela H√ºttich (1986‚Äì1998) * Emily Bowman (1998‚Äì2000) * Hanne Berger (2001‚Äì2007) * Cecilia Crisafulli (2007‚Äìpresent) The current full roster of the orchestra is: { valign=\\"top\\" * Max Raabe (vocalist) * Cecilia Crisafulli (violin) * Sven B√§hrens (clarinet, alto saxophone, trumpet) * Bernd Hugo Dieterich (double bass, sousaphone) * Michael Enders (trumpet) * Johannes Ernst (alto saxophone) * Rainer Fox (baritone saxophone, flute, guitar) valign=\\"top\\" * Bernd Frank (tenor saxophone) * Ulrich Hoffmeier (guitar, banjo, balalaika) * Thomas Huder (trumpet) * J√∂rn Ranke (trombone, viola) * Fabio Duwentester (percussion) * Ian Wekwerth (piano) } The performances by the orchestra are an homage to composers of the Weimar era such as Walter Jurmann, Fritz Rotter, Will Meisel, Charles Amberg, Jerzy Petersburski, G√ºnter Schwenn, Adolf Steimel and Ralph Maria Siegel. In addition to its performances of vintage German and American popular songs, the orchestra has also performed contemporary music in the same musical style as the earlier songs, including covers of songs by Britney Spears, Tom Jones, and Salt'n'Pepa. The orchestra made its Carnegie Hall debut in 2005. The ensemble returned to Carnegie Hall in November 2007, and the performance was recorded for commercial release on the album Heute Nacht oder nie ‚Äì Live In New York. The orchestra returned to Carnegie Hall in March 2014. The orchestra has collaborated with musicians such as HK Gruber, Peter Lohmeyer, and Heino Ferch. In other media, the orchestra appeared in the 1994 film Der bewegte Mann.

A prominent member of the MEDTC's Plans and Programs Section, Mendoza focused on providing the Cambodian Army unconventional warfare units capable of carrying out guerrilla operations in the northern and eastern Cambodian provinces under the control of both the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) and their Khmer Rouge allies.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 203. Two other SF groups, the 2nd Special Forces Group (Airborne) and the 3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne) were activated in the following year. Under the auspices of Operation \\"Freedom Runner\\" ‚Äì a FANK training program set up in November 1971 by the United States Special Forces (USSF) ‚Äì, Khmer Special Forces teams began to be sent to South Vietnam to attend Parachute courses at the ARVN Airborne Training Centre in Long Th√†nh, and the Special Forces' (SF) course at the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces (LLDB) Dong Ba Thin Training Centre near Cam Ranh Bay. Manned by the USSF Detachment B-51, assisted by New Zealand Army instructors from the 2nd NZ Army Training Team Vietnam (2 NZATTV)Lyles, Vietnam ANZACs - Australian & New Zealand Troops in Vietnam 1962-72 (2004), p. 55, Plate C1. and modelled on the USSF/LLDB own training programs, the course began with four weeks of basic SF skills followed by training in one of six SF job skills: operations and intelligence, demolitions, light weapons, heavy weapons, radio communications, or medical. Other advanced additional courses included psychological warfare, political warfare, anti-tank warfare, and Taekwondo. A two-week 'live-fire' field exercise (sometimes complemented by a field operation against NVA/Vietcong (VC) forces in the surrounding areas of the training centre)Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 11. completed the SF course. More specialised SF training was carried out in the United States and Thailand since December 1972. Khmer SF trainees attended technical courses at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, by the USSF 5th Special Forces Group and at the Royal Thai Army (RTA) Special Warfare Centre at Fort Narai, Lopburi Province by the US 46th Special Forces Company; additional Guerrilla and Commando skills were taught by Thai instructors from the Royal Thai Army Special Forces (RTSF) and Royal Thai Police (RTP) Police Aerial Resupply Unit (PARU) at the latter's Phitsanulok and Hua Hin training camps.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), pp. 48-50. Advanced Ranger/LRRP and radio communications' courses also took place in early 1973 at the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) Recondo School at Nha Trang, South Vietnam, manned by the USSF Detachment B-36, and at the RTA Recondo School co-located at Ft. Narai, Thailand, before \\"Freedom Runner\\" was concluded on July that year. Structure and organization The Khmer Special Forces were closely modelled after the United States Special Forces (USSF) and the South Vietnamese Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces (LLDB), with a total unit strength of 350 Officers and enlisted men, being organized in July 1973 into one separate Headquarter 'C' Detachment, along with three 'B' Detachments and 18 'A' Detachments in turn organized into three Special Forces Groups (SFGs). Unlike an American A-Team however, Khmer SF 'A' Detachments could field up to 15 men, the additional personnel being psychological warfare specialists.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 17.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 15, table 2. They were structured as follows: *The 33-man 'C' Detachment, personally commanded by Brig. Gen. Thach Reng, which comprised three 25-man HQ 'B' Detachments sub-divided into five 15-man 'A' Detachments,Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 10, table 1. was allocated at the Cambodian capital and served as Headquarters for the Khmer Special Forces Command. *The 1st Special Forces Group, led by Major (later, Colonel) Kim Phong was composed of one 25-man 'B' Detachment and six 15-man 'A' Detachments (A-111, A-112, A-113, A-114, A-115, A-116) deployed in Battambang province. *The 2nd Special Forces Group, led by Captain Sok Thach comprising the B-12 Detachment and six 'A' Detachments (A-121, A-122, A-123, A-124, A-125, A-126) was stationed in Phnom Penh. *The 3rd Special Forces Group, led by Captain Thach Saren was composed of the B-13 Detachment and six 'A' Detachments (A-131, A-132, A-133, A-134, A-135, A-136). The 3rd SFG was given responsibility for operations around the capital, along the lower Mekong-Bassac river corridors, and the coastline. Composition Khmer Special Forces members' were all airborne-qualified volunteers, though most of the initial cadre was actually formed by \\"repatriated\\" ethnic Khmer recruits from the Khmer Krom minority living in South Vietnam. Traditionally aggressive, the Khmer Krom brought with them years of combat experience gained while fighting in the irregular counterinsurgency MIKE Force and CIDG units in South Vietnam under the control of the USSF and the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam ‚Äì Studies and Observations Group (MACV-SOG). The program began in May 1970 when the Americans assembled a first batch of 2,000 Khmer Krom veteran soldiers and airlifted them to Cambodia. Consequently, by February 1972 both the 1st SFG (raised in Cambodia) and 2nd SFG (formed and trained in Thailand) had a large percentage of Khmer Krom repatriates, but gradually native Cambodian recruits began to supplant them over time. Unlike the previous two groups, 3rd SFG, brought to strength in December 1972 and also sent to Thailand for training, had few experienced Khmer Krom members.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), pp. 6 and 14.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), pp. 14-15. In fact, one of its A-detachments was filled entirely by Khmer Loeu highlanders from northeastern Cambodia.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 204. Khmer Special Forces' missions The missions performed by the Khmer Special Forces during the war were many and varied, ranging from long-range strategic and tactical reconnaissance to deep- penetration raids, pathfinding, and reinforcement duties. In the special forces' unconventional training role, they also raised paramilitary self- defense village militias in rural areas situated behind enemy lines, as well as training airfield security battalions for the Khmer Air Force (KAF) at the Ream infantry training centre.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 15. In addition, the Khmer Special Forces provided LRRP instructors for the FANK Recondo School at Battambang which first opened in November 1972.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), pp. 15-17; 46. Combat operations 1971-74 Besides unconventional warfare and training operations, the Khmer Special Forces were also engaged on some notable combat operations in support of FANK regular troops. The first true combat assignment of the Khmer Special Forces occurred in May 1972, when they participated in a search-and-destroy operation alongside Army units around Phnom Penh to clear its northern outskirts of Khmer Rouge and NVA light artillery teams, who were harassing the quarters of the Cambodian capital with 122mm rocket and 75mm recoilless rifle fire.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 7.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 15. In September 1973, the Khmer Special Forces spearheaded the combined Cambodian Army-Khmer National Navy (MNK) amphibious operation \\"Castor 21\\" to retake the provincial capital of Kampong Cham, which had been stormed by Khmer Rouge forces in August.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970‚Äì1975 (2011), p. 124.Cambodia Navy - History at GlobalSecurity.org, Accessed 24 Nov 2013 Just prior to the assault, two 'A' Detachments were inserted by helicopter into the insurgent-held southern quarter of the city and used LAW rockets to neutralize an enemy stronghold.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), pp. 8 and 17. The role of the Khmer Special Forces teams at the Battle of Kampong Cham was not limited to combat assignments though; their radio operators also assisted coordinating the Khmer Air Force in carrying out successfully aerial resupply drops on behalf of FANK ground units defending the retaken city.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 44. This coordinating role was again resumed on June‚ÄìJuly 1974 during the siege of the district capital of Kampong Seila in Koh Kong Province, located some 135 Kilometers (84 Miles) south-west of Phnom Penh, down Route 4. At the time, this small town and its beleaguered Government garrison were enduring a record eight-month-long siege by Khmer Rouge forces, with the local civilian population already suffering from starvation. Deviating from the Cambodian Army's standard communications procedures, the garrison made desperate radio appeals to Phnom Penh for relief, a fact that arouse suspicions in the FANK High Command. Fearing that Government relief forces were being lured into a trap, it was decided to send first observers to assess the situation at Kampong Seila and to verify the loyalty of the garrison. After two unsuccessful attempts, a Khmer Special Forces team was heli-lifted into the town and after confirming the reports, aerial ressuply operations were sanctioned to alleviate the starvation and allow the Army garrison to hold out against further insurgent pressure.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 9. The final days 1974-75 By March 1975 with all land and river routes leading to Phnom Penh cut, the Khmer Rouge began their final assault on the Cambodian capital. Aside from three 'A' Detachments operating in Battambang and two in Siem Reap, the bulk of the Khmer Special Forces under Brig. Gen. Thach Reng were withdrawn to Phnom Penh to assist in its defense. Two teams secured the Olympic Stadium, where seven KAF UH-1H transport helicopters were being kept to evacuate key members of the government. On the morning of April 17, 1975, after supervising the heliborne evacuation of only a handful of top officials and their families from the improvised helipad at the Olympic Stadium (three of the helicopters had to be abandoned due to technical malfunctions),Sutsakhan, The Khmer Republic at War and the Final Collapse (1980), p. 169. Brig. Gen. Reng handed over the command of the Khmer SF to Colonel Kim Phong and boarded the last helicopter to abandon the Stadium. Left to fend for themselves, Col. Phong and his subordinates planned a massive breakout by land to the south-east towards the South Vietnamese border. Although the Khmer Special Forces escape force managed to sneak out across the southern suburbs of the capital, they never reached the border and were all presumed killed in action. The remaining Khmer Special Forces teams defending the last government-held holdouts at Battambang, including the teaching staff of the Recondo School, and Siem Reap reportedly tried to escape in small groups to Thailand by treeking across hostile territory. Only a handful of Special Forces personnel managed to evade enemy patrols and reach the Thai-Cambodian border; the rest was either killed in action or captured and sent to the Khmer Rouge-run labour camps (also known as the ‚ÄúKilling Fields‚Äù), where they died after enduring the terrible working and living conditions during the late 1970s. Controversy A highly capable and well-trained force, unfortunately the Khmer Special Forces remained too small to have a strategic impact in the war. Casualties and manpower shortages affected their tactical deployment which rarely matched the proposed organization, with many 'A' Detachments actually falling below strength. Khmer Special Forces personnel often found themselves being employed in unsuitable tasks to which they had not been trained ‚Äì in reality, many FANK regional commanders misused them as conventional shock troops on many occasions, such as the sieges and subsequent battles of Kampong Cham and Kampong Seila in 1973-74. Furthermore, a large portion of 2nd Special Forces Group's personnel were siphoned off to protect Phnom Penh from the threat of internal coups d'√©tat, while two more 'A' Detachments from the 3rd SFG were assigned security duties as a VIP protection squad for President Lon Nol when he visited his villa on the coastal city of Kampong Som. Khmer Special Forces‚Äô Command=Para-Commando Battalion The Khmer Special Forces Command was augmented in late 1974 when they assumed operational control over the newly formed Para- Commando Battalion (Bataillon de Commandos Parachutistes ‚Äì BCP in French). In March 1975, loosely under assignment to the Khmer SF, the Para-Commandos were sent to man the defensive perimeter north-west of Phnom Penh.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), pp. 17; 46.

Many of these operate by detecting effects of the Lorentz force: a change in voltage or resonant frequency may be measured electronically, or a mechanical displacement may be measured optically. Compensation for temperature effects is necessary. Its use as a miniaturized compass may be one such simple example application. Magnetic field sensing Magnetometers can be categorized into four general typesLenz, J., Edelstein, A.S., \\"Magnetic sensors and their applications.\\" IEEE Sensors J. 2006, 6, 631-649. depending on the magnitude of the measured field. If the targeted B-field is larger than the earth magnetic field (maximum value around 60 ¬µT), the sensor does not need to be very sensitive. To measure the earth field larger than the geomagnetic noise(around 0.1 nT), better sensors are required. For the application of magnetic anomaly detection, sensors at different locations have to be used to cancel the spatial-correlated noise in order to achieve a better spatial resolution. To measure the field below the geomagnetic noise, much more sensitive magnetic field sensors have to be employed. These sensors are mainly used in medical and biomedical applications, such as MRI and molecule tagging. There are many approaches for magnetic sensing, including Hall effect sensor, magneto-diode, magneto- transistor, AMR magnetometer, GMR magnetometer, magnetic tunnel junction magnetometer, magneto-optical sensor, Lorentz force based MEMS sensor, Electron Tunneling based MEMS sensor, MEMS compass, Nuclear precession magnetic field sensor, optically pumped magnetic field sensor, fluxgate magnetometer, search coil magnetic field sensor and SQUID magnetometer. Figures of merit of MEMS magnetic sensor MEMS magnetic sensors have several parameters: Quality Factor (Q), Resonance Frequency, Mode Shape, Responsivity, and Resolution. Quality factor is a measure of how much energy can be maintained during vibration of the resonator. There might be several factors that can damp the resonator, such as mechanical damping of resonator itself or damping from outside pressure and temperature. Tabrizian, R. (2016) Damped Oscillation of Microstructures and Lumped Element Modeling and Transducers (pdf slides) Retrieved from Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, EEL 4930 / 5934 Resonant Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems Resonance frequency is the frequency at which the device vibrates with the highest amplitude (or the longest, as a struck bell or tuning fork). Resonance frequency is governed by geometry of the device. We can calculate resonance frequency when we know dimension of the device, equivalent Young's modulus of the device, and the equivalent density of the device. Tabrizian, R. (2016) Overview and Introduction(pdf slides) Retrieved from Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, EEL 4930 / 5934 Resonant Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems Mode shape is the pattern of the vibration of resonator. Chaudhuri, R. R., Basu, J., & Bhattacharyya, T. K. (2012). Design and Fabrication of Micromachined Resonators. arXiv preprint . Responsivity (which contributes to resolution) describes the size of the oscillation we can get from devices with same external condition. If we apply the same current and B field to several resonators, devices that show larger vibration amplitudes are said to have a higher responsivity. All other things being equal, a higher responsivity device is more sensitive. The range of magnetometers based on piezoelectric resonators is mV/T (millivolt/Tesla), so higher responsivity is generally better.THerrera-May, A. L., Soler-Balcazar, J.

Recent Advances of MEMS Resonators for Lorentz Force Based Magnetic Field Sensors: Design, Applications and Challenges. Sensors, 16(9), 1359. Resolution refers to the smallest magnetic field a device can measure. The smaller the number, the more sensitive the device. The range of magnetometers based on piezoelectric resonator is a few nT (nanoTesla).Herrera-May, A. L., Soler- Balcazar, J. C., V√°zquez-Leal, H., Mart√≠nez-Castillo, J., Vigueras-Zu√±iga, M. O., & Aguilera-Cort√©s, L. A. (2016). Recent Advances of MEMS Resonators for Lorentz Force Based Magnetic Field Sensors: Design, Applications and Challenges. Sensors, 16(9), 1359. Advantages of MEMS-based sensors A MEMS-based magnetic field sensor is small, so it can be placed close to the measurement location and thereby achieve higher spatial resolution than other magnetic field sensors. Additionally, constructing a MEMS magnetic field sensor does not require the microfabrication of magnetic material. Therefore, the cost of the sensor can be greatly reduced. Integration of MEMS sensor and microelectronics can further reduce the size of the entire magnetic field sensing system. Lorentz-force-based MEMS sensor This type of sensor relies on the mechanical motion of the MEMS structure due to the Lorentz force acting on the current-carrying conductor in the magnetic field. The mechanical motion of the micro-structure is sensed either electronically or optically. The mechanical structure is often driven to its resonance in order to obtain the maximum output signal. Piezoresistive and electrostatic transduction methods can be used in the electronic detection. Displacement measurement with laser source or LED source can also be used in the optical detection. Several sensors will be discussed in the following subsections in terms of different output for the sensor. Voltage sensing Beroulle et al.Beroulle, V.; Bertrand, Y.; Latorre, L.; Nouet, P. Monolithic Piezoresistive CMOS magnetic field sensors. Sens. Actuators A 2003, 103, 23-32 have fabricated a U-shape cantilever beam on a silicon substrate. Two piezo-resistors are laid on the support ends. There is an 80-turn Al coil passing current along the U-shape beam. A Wheatstone bridge is formed by connecting the two \\"active\\" resistors with another two \\"passive\\" resistors, which are free of strain. When there is an external magnetic field applied to the current carrying conductor, motion of the U-shape beam will induce strain in the two \\"active\\" piezo-resistors and thereby generate an output voltage across the Wheatstone bridge which is proportional to the magnetic field flux density. The reported sensitivity for this sensor is 530 m Vrms/T with a resolution 2 ŒºT. Note that the frequency of the exciting current is set to be equal to the resonant frequency of the U-shape beam in order to maximize the sensitivity. Herrera-May et al.Herrera- May, A.L.; Garc√≠a-Ram√≠rez, P.J.; Aguilera-Cort√©s, L.A.; Mart√≠nez-Castillo, J.; Sauceda-Carvajal, A.; Garc√≠a-Gonz√°lez, L.; Figueras-Costa, E. A resonant magnetic field microsensor with high quality factor at atmospheric pressure. J. Micromech. Microeng. 2009, 19, 015016. fabricate a sensor with similar piezoresistive read-out approach but with different mechanical motion. Their sensor relies on the torsional motion of a micro-plate fabricated from silicon substrate. The exciting current loop contains 8 turns of aluminum coil. The location of the current loop enables a more uniform Lorentz force distribution compared with the aforementioned U-shape cantilever beam. The reported sensitivity is 403 mVrms/T with a resolution 143 nT. K√°d√°r et al.K√°d√°r, Z.; Bossche, A.; Sarro, P.M.; Mollinger, J.R. Magnetic-field measurements using an integrated resonant magnetic-field sensor. Sens. Actuators A 1998, 70, 225-232. also chose the micro-torsional beam as the mechanical structure. Their read-out approach is different. Instead of using piezoresistive transduction, their sensor relies on electrostatic transduction. They patterned several electrodes on the surface of the micro-plate and another external glass wafer. The glass wafer is then bonded with the silicon substrate to form a variable capacitor array. Lorentz force generated by the external magnetic field results in the change of capacitor array. The reported sensitivity is 500 Vrms/T with a resolution of a few mT. The resolution can reach 1 nT with vacuum operation. Emmerich et al.Emmerich, H.; Sch√∂fthaler, M. Magnetic field measurements with a novel surface micromachined magnetic-field sensor. IEEE Tans. Electron Dev. 2000, 47, 972-977. fabricated the variable capacitor array on a single silicon substrate with comb-figure structure. The reported sensitivity is 820 Vrms/T with a resolution 200 nT at the pressure level of 1mbar. Frequency shift sensing Another type of Lorentz force based MEMS magnetic field sensor utilizes the shift of mechanical resonance due to the Lorentz force applying to certain mechanical structures. Sunier et al.Sunier, R.; Vancura, T.; Li, Y.; Kay-Uwe, K.; Baltes, H.; Brand, O. Resonant magnetic field sensor with frequency output. J. Microelectromech. Syst. 2006, 15, 1098-1107. change the structure of aforementioned U-shape cantilever beam by adding a curved-in support. The piezoresistive sensing bridge is laid between two heating actuation resistors. Frequency response of the output voltage of the sensing bridge is measured to determine the resonant frequency of the structure. Note that in this sensor, the current flowing through the aluminum coil is DC. The mechanical structure is actually driven by the heating resistor at its resonance. Lorentz force applying at the U-shape beam will change the resonant frequency of the beam and thereby change the frequency response of the output voltage. The reported sensitivity is 60 kHz/T with a resolution of 1 ŒºT. Bahreyni et al.Bahreyni, B.; Shafai, C. A resonant micromachined magnetic field sensor. IEEE Sensor J. 2007, 7, 1326-1334. fabricated a comb figure structure on top of the silicon substrate. The center shuttle are connected to two clamped-clamped conductors used to change the internal stress of the moving structure when external magnetic field is applied. This will induce the change of the resonant frequency of the comb finger structure. This sensor use electrostatic transduction to measure the output signal. The reported sensitivity is improved to 69.6 Hz/T thanks to the high mechanical quality factor (Q = 15000 @ 2 Pa) structure in the vacuum environment. The reported resolution is 217 nT. Optical sensing The optical sensing is to directly measure the mechanical displacement of the MEMS structure to find the external magnetic field.

Haris Bin Md Khir and Nor Hisham Bin Hamid fabricated CMOS-MEMS sensor consists of a shuttle which is designed to resonate in the lateral direction (first mode of resonance). In the presence of an external magnetic field, the Lorentz force actuates the shuttle in the lateral direction and the amplitude of resonance is measured using an optical method. The differential change in the amplitude of the resonating shuttle shows the strength of the external magnetic field. The sensitivity of the sensor is determined in static mode to be 0.034 ¬µm/mT when a current of 10 mA passes through the shuttle, while it is found to be higher at resonance with a value of 1.35 ¬µm/mT at 8 mA current. Finally, the resolution of the sensor is found to be 370.37 ¬µT. Temperature effects When the temperature increases, the Young's modulus of the material used to fabricate the moving structure decreases, or more simply, the moving structure softens. Meanwhile, thermal expansion and thermal conductivity increase, with the temperature inducing an internal stress in the moving structure. These effects can result in the shift of the resonant frequency of the moving structure which is equivalent to noise for resonant frequency shift sensing or the voltage sensing. In addition, temperature rise will generate larger Johnson noise (affect the piezoresistive transduction) and increase mechanical fluctuation noise (which affects optical sensing). Therefore, advanced electronics for temperature effect compensation have to be used to maintain sensitivity as temperature changes.  Applications =Detect flaws of electrically conductive material Magnetometers based on piezoelectric resonators can be applied to finding flaws in safety-critical metal structures, such as airplane propellers, engines, fuselage and wing structures, or high pressure oil or gas pipelines. When a magnet (generally an electromagnet creating a varying frequency field) creates eddy currents in the material, the eddy currents generate another magnetic field in the material which can be sensed by the magnetometer. If there is no flaw or crack in the pipeline, the magnetic field from the eddy current shows a constant pattern as it moves along the material being tested. But a crack or pit in the material interrupts the eddy current, so the magnetic field is changed, allowing a sensitive magnetometer to sense and localize the flaw.Herrera-May, A.

It often waits upside down near the top of a plant, which may be useful for detecting prey, and then quickly jumps down before the prey can escape. The spider is one of 60 species in the genus Phidippus, and one of about 5,000 in the Salticidae, a family that accounts for about 10% of all spider species. P. clarus is a predator, mostly taking insects, other spiders, and other terrestrial arthropods. P. clarus, a relatively large salticid, takes prey up to the size of an adult earwig. In an experiment, P. clarus was offered as many fruit flies as it could eat, and in four-hour sessions individuals took 17 flies on average ‚Äì while one took 41. When P. clarus males compete for females, the winners are those that produce the most vibrations on the surface and those that are largest. Contests between females involve less displaying, and physical fights between females are more likely to end in injury or death. The most successful males choose the largest females, as these produce the most eggs and most quickly. If a female that has mated already then finds a larger male, she will often mate again with the larger male. The average clutch is 135 eggs. Unlike most of the genus Phidippus, P. clarus females die after one brood has left the nest. P. clarus is parasitized by the Californian wasp Aporinellus completus and by mermithid nematodes. In an experiment in 2006, P. clarus showed promise for controlling the fourlined plant bug, Poecilocapsus lineatus, which severely damages the commercially grown sweet basil. Body structure Jumping spiders have a distinctive rectangular carapace, and that of female Phidippus clarus average wide, while the carapaces of males average . Adult female, western form Feeding Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly preying on insects, other spiders, and other non-aquatic arthropods. The most common procedure is sighting the prey, stalking, fastening a silk safety line to the surface, using the two pairs of back legs to jump on the victim, and finally biting the prey. Most jumping spiders walk throughout the day, so that they maximize their chances of a catch. After capturing the prey, P. clarus settles in one spot and does not move again until it has discarded the undigestible hard remains of the prey. If P. clarus has gone without food for a few days, it eats slowly. P. clarus, which is large by the standards of salticids, takes prey up to the size of an adult earwig. In an experiment, the jumping spider was offered as many fruit flies as it could eat, and in 4-hour sessions specimens took 17 flies on average--while one took 41. When the courtship display of wolf spider Schizocosa ocreata combines visual signals with vibrations, P. clarus responds to its wolf spider prey more quickly than when the wolf spider presents only one of the types of signal. Reproduction and lifecycle Phidippus clarus becomes adult in early summer, and females about to lay eggs can weigh . Early in the breeding season, in early to mid-July, there are more males than females. The females all become sexually mature at the same time. At this point during this part of the breeding season males die off, so that the number of males becomes equal to or slightly smaller than the number of females. By August, most females live in their nests overnight for increasing periods, as this is where they will lay eggs. The nests are located in rolled up leaves and are made of thick silk, which is expensive to build. Tests show that females use visual landmarks to return to their nests. A male only remains at the same nest when paired with a female. Like other spiders and many other arthropods, P. clarus can vibrate surfaces to interact with others of its species, sometimes in conjunction with other communications such as movements, to intimidate rivals and woo mates. Competitions between P. clarus males occur on leaves up to long and wide, and the prize is the right to cohabit in the nest of a sub-adult female who is about enter her last molt and then become fertile. Initially the contending males use vibration and visual displays, and the number of vibration signals often determines which male wins. Otherwise males may use \\"leg-fencing\\", trying to push each other backwards with their front legs and bodies. Some of these contests escalate to grappling, in which males lock chelicerae (jaws) and legs for relatively longer periods. In contests, males with previous experience of winning are more likely to win later contests, and males with more experience of losing are more likely to lose in future. In both winners and losers, more recent experience is more important then much earlier experience. However, the weights of the contenders is a much stronger influence, and experience makes a difference only between individuals of similar size. In contests between P. clarus females, the preliminaries are longer but ritualized displays are rare. Physical fights between females are more likely to end in injury or death. Courtship of Phidippus clarus Males of P. clarus can detect females' size and age based on pheromones and other chemicals left in females' silk, and males use this information to choose mates. Males prefer to cohabit with large females, which mature more quickly and have more offspring than smaller ones. The largest males are the most aggressive and thus the largest males and females mate, and so on in order of size. When P. clarus males find females, the males court by waving their legs and making their abdomens vibrate against the substrate (leaves, the ground, etc.). Males will court immature and adult virgin females, and also previously mated females. As the male dances, he approaches the female and touches the female cautiously once or twice. The female rejects the male by extending her first pair of legs whenever he approaches too closely, or shows acceptance by not blocking his advance. If accepted, the male climbs over her and uses his forelegs to turn her abdomen to the side. The turn exposes her genital pore, which lies on the underside of the abdomen, and the male inserts one semen-laden pedipalp. After two or three minutes the male withdraws this pedipalp, turns the female's abdomen the other way and inserts the other pedipalp. Male and female Phidippus clarus mating Some P. clarus females mate with more than one male. In these females, copulations after the first occur after longer courtships. This shows that already-mated females are less receptive to mates, and suggests that females may be trading up in subsequent matings. One mated female P. clarus can lay well over 100 eggs per sac in a thick silken cocoon. An average clutch contains 135 eggs. Most females bear only one clutch of eggs, but some lay more. The females stay with the egg cocoon and usually die a few days after the spiderlings leave the nest. The egg membrane is shed in 24-26 days, but the hatchlings (the first instar) continue to mature in the cocoon. The first molt occurs 24-28 days after the membrane is shed, and two to three days later the spiderlings leave their protective cover and become active, independent individuals. They do not hunt immediately, even if prey is available, but spend several hours engaged in apparently random activity before seeking cover, where they remain between two hours and two days. About 10% of spiderlings build retreats during this period, while the rest do so only after they have fed. The usually die a few days after the spiderlings leave the nest.  Ecology  Phidippus clarus is found in old fields throughout eastern North America. It lives among flowers, often sharing habitats with the small to medium-sized crab spider Misumena vatia, which waits for prey. P. clarus often waits upside down near the top of a plant, a position which may be useful for detecting prey and then quickly jumping down before the prey can escape. In a 2002 survey of jumping spiders in Minnesota, P. clarus accounted for 52% of the total found. The Californian wasp Aporinellus completus parasitizes P. clarus by paralyzing the spider and attaching an egg to the spider's abdomen. Mermithid nematodes infest P. clarus and many other spiders, typically severely damaging the main muscles, the digestive system and the reproductive system. In an experiment in 2006, P. clarus showed promise for controlling the fourlined plant bug, Poecilocapsus lineatus, which severely damages sweet basil, Ocimum basilicum, a herb commercially grown in greenhouses. The potential advantages of P. clarus for biocontrol include that the spider prefers to stay overnight in the same nest, detects prey visually from a distance, takes a wide range of prey, can both wait for prey and hunt actively, learns to recognize particular prey, and can be reared in individual cages. Although cannibalism is likely to prevent mass rearing of P. clarus, it is possible to collect egg sacs or spiders and move them to where they are needed. In the breeding season, one mated female can lay well over 100 eggs per sac, many females lay more than one egg sac, and it is easy to recognize the egg sacs. Juvenile and adult jumping spiders can be collected via sweep netting or by providing good sites for nests, even in plumber's tubing placed in old fields. Taxonomy Phidippus clarus is one of the 60 species in the genus Phidippus, and one of about 5,000 in the Salticidae, a family that accounts for about 10% of all spider species.

Selby is currently married to Birgitta Steiner of Waldassen, Bavaria. They have 2 sons, Kibo and Jesse. John also has an earlier son, Shon, by another marriage. John and Birgitta lived in Europe for 5 years, Santa Barbara, California for 2 years, Kauai for 21 years, and in 2011 moved to Santa Cruz, California. John‚Äôs father Walter Smith was a musical inventor.see The Guitar Almanac Selby carried his father‚Äôs ‚Äòthere must be a better way‚Äô attitude into his psychological career by refining new therapy and meditation techniques. While based in Europe, Selby ran eight experimental test groups for four years duration, conducting 160 three-day experimental-technique seminars. He then published an extensive 'cassettebook' self-therapy series with Droemer Knaur Verlag and Bauer Media Group Verlag based on those studies. Later, eight of those original German-edition programs were later released as English-language books (see bibliography section).  Career  Selby is an innovator in cognitive-shifting psychological techniques, having done mind- management research for NIH at the New Jersey Neuro-psychiatric Institute working under Dr. Humphrey Osmond MD. He also pioneered the development of and has apparently coined the term Focus phrase for inducing particular cognitive changes. In the early 1980s Selby moved his operational base to West Berlin to guide further psychological studies with Manfred Henschell at the Free University of West Berlin on the emotional-healing techniques of Wilhelm Reich. During this period he initiated the use of self-help and meditation audio cassette-books in the German language, published by Droemer Knaur and Bauer Verlags. Selby returned to the United States in the 1990s and co-founded the short lived BrightMind Network. A company that was not able to reach its full potential and dissolved after several months.

A high-rise or high-waisted garment is one designed to sit high on, or above, the wearer's hips, usually at least 8 centimetres (3 inches) higher than the navel. In western cultures, high-rise jeans were especially common in the 1970s, in competition with low-rise pants. Modern fashion In western culture, high- waisted pants tend to have long zippers, ranging from about 7-10 inches long, and leave the navel either completely covered or barely shown. Zipper lengths are not to be confused with rises. High-waisted pants have rises typically 10 inches long or longer. In European menswear, pants sat level with the navel until the 1950s, and were held up by a pair of suspenders. During the 1940s, Zoot suitersZoot suit wore pants with a waistband so high that they often reached the chest.Zoot suits and style warfare 1960s to 1990s Low- waisted drainpipe jeans and flared trousers were a counterculture statement among the Mods and hippies of the late 1960s and early 1970s, in contrast to the higher waisted Levi Strauss jeans teenagers had worn previously. During the late 1970s, however, there was a backlash against disco and hippie fashions, and members of Generation X opted for higher rise pants. These straight leg acid wash jeans remained popular throughout the 1980s and 1990s, until hip hop fashion went mainstream and it became fashionable for teenagers to sag their baggy pants.Keyes, Cheryl (2004). Rap Music and Street Consciousness (Music in American Life). University of Illinois Press. p. 152. . Revival During the early 2010s, high waisted pants underwent a revival among younger women, in reaction to the low-rise skinny jeans that were popular during the previous decade. During the 2000s and 2010s, male celebrities who wore high-rise jeans, including President Barack Obama, Simon Cowell,Simon Cowell jeans and Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson, were ridiculed by the press.Obama jeans Indian culture In ancient India, some Indian philosophers opposed saris that expose the midriff.

It is the smallest of six islands comprising an archipelago in Essex, and is privately owned. A seawall was first constructed in the 1780s by John Harriott, and the island has been the object of farming activities since then.Fautley, M. P. B. and Garon, J. H., Essex Coastline: Then and Now (Potton Publishing, 2004), , pp. 168, 190‚Äì192. Excerpts available at Google Books. The local racehorse trainer and one-time Rushley Island owner, Frank Threadgold, once bred a horse which he named after the island. Born in 1976 she was a bay mare with horseracing parents called Crooner and Vicki Ann. She was later trained at the famous Newmarket track by Mr. H. C. Westbrook and was entered as a two-year- old for four races, mainly over a distance of six furlongs, between September and November 1978. These took place at Yarmouth, Lingfield (twice) and Doncaster. Unfortunately she was not a tremendously successful racehorse, finishing, at best, second from last in all these races, and she was retired for breeding purposes back into the ownership of the Threadgold family at Southend-on-Sea, who have farmed land at nearby Great Wakering since the 1930s. Sadly, she did not prove to be too successful at breeding either, although she did have one colt, a bay called Tudor Rhythm, in 1980, which was never raced. In 1987 she was officially retired from stud and disappeared from the record books.\\"Islands of Essex\\" by Ian Yearsley, p.75 References Category:Islands of Essex Category:Uninhabited islands of England Category:Rochford District ","title":"Rushley Island"},{"id":"31578373","text":"The following is a discography of production by Warren G.  1993 = MC Breed - The New Breed  * 03. \\"Gotta Get Mine\\" (feat. 2Pac) (Produced with Colin Wolfe)  Various Artists - Poetic Justice (soundtrack)  * 02. \\"Indo Smoke\\" (Mista Grimm feat.

Her career extended from the 1930s until 1981; she is considered one of the pioneering women in journalism.  Early life  Pauline Frederick was born in Gallitzin, Pennsylvania on February 13, 1908, although several sources state the year as 1906. Her father was Mathew Frederick, a postmaster, and her mother was Catherine Stanley. Her family later relocated to Harrisburg, where she attended high school. Frederick actually began her journalism career as a high school student, winning essay contests and writing for her school and local newspapers. She was her class valedictorian when she graduated in 1926. When Frederick was only eighteen years old, she had to undergo a complete hysterectomy, which left her unable to conceive children. Pauline decided that since she would never be a mother, she would devote all of her time and energy to a career. Upon graduation from high school, she entered American University in Washington, D.C., where she received her bachelor's and master's degrees in political science and international law. ‚ÄúA history professor, however, advised her to ‚Äòleave the law to others‚Äô and go back to journalism\\". After finishing college at American University, Pauline followed the professor's advice pursuing a career in journalism with great determination, ‚Äúand within four years she began to receive invitations to White House press events‚Äù.  Professional career  In 1931, Frederick set out to get a journalism job and she took an interesting approach: ‚ÄúBecause few important men in politics at the time would be interviewed by a woman, she decided to interview the men‚Äôs wives‚Äù. She interviewed the minister of Czechoslovakia's wife and the wife of the then ambassador of China with hopes that she could sell these interviews and gain some attention in the journalism industry. This is when she may have conceived the idea that she later turned into a book of interviews titled The First Ladies of the World. Hoping for a job, Frederick sent her articles about these women to the editor of the former Washington Star; however, the editor believing that Frederick was the famous actress Pauline Frederick, hired her to boost his newspaper's circulation. ‚ÄúThough not the Frederick he wanted, the Star‚Äôs editor was so impressed by her writing that he bought both of the articles she offered and gave her a job churning out a weekly feature‚Äù. Pauline Frederick's paid journalism career had begun and she started writing articles for the Washington Star. In the mid-1930s, \\"Frederick was covering the State, War, and Navy Departments for the United States News (later renamed US News & World Report)\\". A short time after that Frederick was employed as a journalist for the North American Newspaper Alliance . While working for the NANA she had many articles published in the New York Times. The first decade of her journalistic career was a hard-fought grind of hard work and determination. Pauline Frederick recalled her early experiences breaking into journalism: ‚ÄúI tried every way I could to convince the powers that be that I could broadcast news‚Ä¶ This was very difficult because it was unheard of for a woman to want to enter this man‚Äôs world‚Äù. Eventually, she would enter the masculine world of broadcast journalism full-time and excel in it. In 1938, with her interest in electronic communications, she accepted a job as a part- time aide assisting in writing scripts for ABC radio reporter H. R. Baukhage. Her journalism career in radio began in 1939, when NBC Radio's director of women's programs, Margaret Cuthhert, heard of Frederick's interviews with diplomats‚Äô wives and thought they would make a good radio feature. Pauline Frederick took the job and her interview with the minister of Czechoslovakia's wife was heard on air shortly after Hitler's assault on Czechoslovakia. Frederick continued to work as a newspaper and radio journalist in Washington, D.C. during the next seven years. She authored four chapters in the book America Prepares for Tomorrow. Frederick's career as a serious news journalist began to gain momentum and take off. In April 1945, Frederick got a tremendous career boost when she was given the opportunity to travel ‚Äúas a war correspondent on a journalist‚Äôs tour of North Africa, Asia, and China nineteen countries in all‚Äù. Her first foreign broadcast was done from China. Also on that trip she reported on a USO show with a male-only cast. She was later quoted in 1949 as describing the show as, ‚Äúthe roughest thing I ever heard‚Äù. Pauline Frederick is credited with being the first female reporter to broadcast from China. After her war correspondence tour she ended her radio relationship with NBC but continued reporting for newspapers and ABC radio, covering the Nuremberg Trials. However, Frederick only reported ‚Äúon the air once‚Äîwhen Hermann G√∂ring took the stand and the first-string male reporter was busy doing something else‚Äù. Despite her respected work, journalism was still a male-dominated business, and Pauline was not one of the boys. She later remarked on a comment by a male industry executive that a women's voice does not carry authority: ‚ÄúI am terribly sorry that I didn‚Äôt have courage enough in those days to tell him that I knew his wife‚Äôs voice carried plenty of authority in his house‚Äù. Frederick's desire for a career as a news journalist remained strong even though she had been denied a job by NBC and CBS. She retained employment as an independent writer for ABC, furnishing them with articles that were considered women's-interest pieces. While reporting for ABC, Frederick was asked to report on a women's tutorial that was designed to teach women ‚ÄúHow to Get a Husband‚Äù and that piece became some of her best- known work. She was later quoted as saying about the fluffy women's article ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I learned anything from it, and I don‚Äôt think the audience did either‚Äù. In 1946, she accepted an assignment from ABC to travel to Uruguay to cover the presidential inauguration there. Later that year she landed an assignment to report on the final journey of the RMS Queen Mary as a troop ship; during the cruise she conducted an exclusive interview with General and Mrs. Dwight D. Eisenhower. Of her struggles throughout her career, she once remarked, ‚Äúall news activities are about people and the ability to cover should not be judged by the sex of the reporter but by the reporting ability‚Äù. In 1948, Pauline Frederick finally received the opportunity she had been waiting for. Early that year she was the only reporter available to cover a breaking story at the United Nations, and later that same year she was selected to cover the first televised political convention, an experience that gained her instant credibility. In 1949, after years of struggle, Pauline Frederick became the ‚Äúfirst women ever to work full-time for a U.S. television Network,‚Äù ABC. Also in 1949, she premiered a weekday news program entitled ‚ÄúPauline Frederick Reports‚Äù, and ABC promoted her as the only female commentator broadcasting on-air. Frederick would continue to work for ABC, covering the Korean crisis and changes in Eastern Europe among many other important news stories, until 1953 when NBC hired her to cover the United Nations. It was in this position that Pauline Frederick would become a household name. She covered the United Nations for NBC for twenty-one years, reporting daily on the most critical world issues. Frederick was the United Nations correspondent on air from early in the morning to late at night through the coup crisis in Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Korean War, Middle East turmoil, the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War. She was in the middle of every major foreign affairs issue faced by the United States during her tenure as United Nations correspondent. Anchorman Chet Huntley commented about her reporting, ‚ÄúShe is our dependable right arm in sorting out the legalities, the propaganda, the nationalistic sensitivities and the international nuances which frequent the UN‚Äù. In 1975, Pauline Fredrick retired from NBC, over two years before the network's mandatory retirement age of 70. Although undoubtedly a successful and respected journalist at the end of her career with NBC, her salary was similar to those of other women who, by then, had only been working in television news for less than a year. She continued her career with National Public Radio for another five years until leaving broadcast journalism for good in 1980. When asked to identify her greatest moment at the UN Pauline had some difficulty, explaining that ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been at the United Nations since the beginning, so each one to me was the greatest opportunity, starting with the Korean War, ‚Ä¶the Middle East War, the Cuban missile crisis, Suez, Hungary, the Chinese coming into the UN ‚Äì they‚Äôve all been very exciting.‚Äù  Awards and honors  During her long career, Pauline Frederick received numerous awards and honors, and was awarded ‚Äúhonorary doctorate degrees in journalism, law, and the humanities from more than twenty colleges and universities‚Äù. She is probably most famous for becoming, as a part-time correspondent in 1946, ‚Äúthe first and only woman in television news‚Äù and then, in 1949 ‚Äúthe first woman ever to work fulltime for a U.S. television network‚Äù (American Broadcasting Company). Ms. Frederick is the first lady of broadcast journalism, and performed her job with professionalism and grace throughout her illustrious career. Pauline Frederick earned numerous awards and honors, many of which she was the first woman to receive. She was included in the Gallup poll's list of most admired women. In 1953, she was awarded the eleventh Alfred I. DuPont Award. In 1954, she became the first women to receive the George Foster Peabody Award for her work in the field of international understanding. ‚ÄúFrederick won the top award from McCall‚Äôs and AWRT in 1956 for her ingenious reporting and courage to say what she believed‚Äù. She was named to the Hall of Fame of Sigma Delta Chi, the journalism professional society, in 1975, and was the first woman to be elected as president of the United Nations Correspondents Association. In 1980, Pauline was awarded the Paul White Award from the Radio-Television News Directors Association; she was the first woman ever to receive this honor.  Personal life  Early in her career, Frederick had kept so busy with journalism that she had never really made time for a personal life of her own but she got married in 1969, to Charles Robbins on March 31. Robbins had been the managing editor of the Wall Street Journal and later the president of the Atomic Industrial Forum. Frederick retired from journalism in 1981 and moved with her husband to Sarasota, Florida. In retirement, Frederick carried on, lecturing on the mission of the United Nations and international affairs. Charles Robbins died in August 1989.  Death  Pauline Frederick died of a heart attack while visiting relatives on May 9, 1990 in Lake Forest, Illinois. She was 82. Today, female anchors and correspondents are commonplace and each of them owes her career in some manner to Pauline Frederick. She broke down many barriers and, through a dedicated work ethic and constant professionalism, even in the face of danger in war zones and sexist ridicule at work, performed as a brilliant broadcast journalist. The volume of articles written to acknowledge her life and her work are testament to the ground- breaking woman she was. Publications= Ten First Ladies of the World  Pauline Frederick published a book of interviews with ten first wives in 1967. The book includes interviews with Indira Gandhi of India, Lady Bird Johnson of the United States, Mary Wilson of the United Kingdom, Yvonne de Gaulle of France, Carmen Polo de Franco of Spain, Jovanka Broz Tito of Yugoslavia, Tahia Nasser of the United Arab Republic, Fathia Nkrumah of Ghana, Daw Thein Tin (Mme. Thant) of the United Nations and Imelda Romualdez Marcos of the Republic of the Philippines. Speaking of why she selected these particular woman, Frederick remarked in her introduction, ‚ÄúWith the exception of Indira Gandhi who, as Prime Minister of India, is uniquely a first lady in her own right, the women portrayed are wives of men who exercise national power, exert regional political influence, and in some cases, are world shakers‚Äù. Pauline was personally aware of the forces working against women through her own experiences, and it is telling that she concluded her first interview with Indira Gandhi with a universal quote applicable to all women fighting to succeed in a male dominated world: ‚ÄúIt is a question of being a human being, not a man or a woman‚Äù.  America Prepares for Tomorrow, The Story of Our Total Defense Effort  In 1941, Pauline Frederick co-authored with William Dow Boutwell, B.P. Brodinsky, Joseph Pratt Harris, Glenn Nixon, and Archibald Robertson, America Prepares for Tomorrow. Frederick authored four chapters ‚Äì Chapter Four, Aid to the Democracies; Chapter Twenty-Two, The Bread and Butter Line; Chapter Twenty-Three, Sitting on the Price Lid, and Chapter Twenty-Six, The Inner Lines ‚Äì Problems of Propaganda and Sabotage, and provided research for Chapter Five. This early in her career, she is clearly considered an equal to her male co-authors. In the About the Authors section of the book, Pauline Frederick is credited with specializing in foreign affairs and editing the Federal Register. In her chapters, Pauline tackles the changing attitudes of isolationism in America, the consumer's relationship to national defense, the economics at home of building the weapons of war, and defending the American way of life. Even this early in her career, Pauline Fredrick was recognized by some as a journalist and author capable of writing and reporting on serious news topics. At this point, most women in the field of journalism and, the female gender as a whole were not considered capable of performing such tasks.  Newspaper reporting  Pauline Frederick authored hundreds of newspaper articles over the course of her distinguished career. In keeping with the sexist practices of the time, most of her assignments were focused on women's issues. In the male-dominated field of journalism, a female reporter was not felt capable or respected enough to cover anything other than stories concerning feminine issues. Still, Frederick made her mark writing about significant news in relation to women. Her newspaper credits for the New York Times during 1938 and 1939 are a wonderful example of how she incorporated the women she was covering into articles about the most important issues of the day. For example, she wrote about neutrality prior to the United States entering World War II in her article Representative Edith Rogers Asks Women To Help Country to Be Really Neutral (Apr 30, 1939).  Legacy  Today we do not think twice about a woman broadcaster on radio or television presenting the news. However, when Pauline Frederick performed the role she was the only female doing so. It would not be long before women began to emerge on the broadcast journalism scene. In the early nineteen seventies, NBC had four female correspondents, including Pauline Frederick. Her fellow female correspondents were, Nancy Dickerson, Aline Saarinen and Liz Trotta. Marya McLaughlin was the sole woman at CBS, while ABC had two, Virginia Sherwood and Marlene Sanders. A CBS executive remarked concerning these pioneers, ‚Äúthe few woman who were in television news proved to be outstanding and I think they really paved the way in a way that we really can‚Äôt appreciate ‚Ä¶ Pauline Frederick at NBC ‚Äì they were knocking down those old barriers about, she‚Äôs not believable, she can‚Äôt keep up, she can‚Äôt do that and, by God, every time she came on she was keeping up‚Äù. All of these women, the first class of females to enter the broadcasting field, owe their opportunity in some way to the first, Pauline Frederick.

She was the second Western woman known to have visited Tibet, after Annie Royle Taylor. Early life and marriage Susie Carson was born in 1868 in Chatham, Ontario. At the age of twenty she graduated from Trinity College in Toronto as a medical doctor. She was in private practice for six years in Ontario. In 1894 she met Petrus Rijnhart, a Dutch-born former missionary with the China Inland Mission. Rijnhart had worked in the Netherlands for the Salvation Army but was sent to Canada in 1886 to avoid charges of sexual assault. He eventually made it to China and worked for three years with the CIM. He was dismissed by CIM in 1893 as an ‚Äòimposter‚Äù after stirring up ‚ÄúRijnhart‚Äôs hornet‚Äôs nest.\\" A charismatic speaker, he was lecturing in Canada and soliciting financial support to return to China and work in Tibet when he met Susie. The couple was married in September 1894 and before the end of the year departed Canada for China. Unlike most missionaries, they were independent, not representatives of any missionary organization. Apparently, however, the funds they had raised in Canada were adequate for their expenses. Independent missionaries were often criticized as loose cannons, more likely to cause trouble than to achieve progress in the goal of making China a Christian country. On the borders of Tibet Dr. Susie Rijnhart in Tibetan dress. In mid-1895, the Rijnharts and their colleague, William Neil Ferguson, arrived at their destination of Lusar, a small village servicing the Kumbum, one of the largest and most important Tibetan Buddhist monasteries. Kumbum was home to about 3,600 monks.http://www.titetancc.com/info/Main.=aspx?Page+KumHistory, accessed 23 Apr2011 Ferguson parted ways with the Rijnharts after a few months and their nearest Western neighbors were missionaries in Xining, seventeen miles away. The immediate objective of the Rijnharts was to learn Tibetan and work among the Tibetans. Their ultimate ambition was to reach Lhasa, the remote and forbidden capital of Tibet, unvisited by Westerners since 1846. In 1896, a revolt broke out among the Muslim population and Kumbum was in danger of being overrun. Susie and her husband were invited by the monastery to tend to the wounded and sick and subsequently invited to reside at the monastery. Petreus became a friend and confidant of the abbot of the monastery, according to Susie. In late-summer 1896, the Rijnharts moved to the trading town of Tankar, about 24 miles from Kumbum, to open a medical dispensary. The British traveler, Montagu Sinclair Wellby, passed through Tankar in October 1896 and gave a favorable view of the Rijnharts and their good relations with Chinese officials. They lived a \\"hard life\\" dependent upon the small sums they charged for medical services at their dispensary. Petreus left Susie alone in Tankar for several months while he acted as a guide and interpreter for Wellby. In November Susie was visited by explorer Sven Hedin who passed through Tankar. He described Susie as a ‚Äúbareheaded young lady wearing spectacles and dressed after the Chinese manner‚Ä¶Through her medical knowledge and skill, Mrs. Rheinhard [sic] had won several friends among the native population.‚Äù Shortly after Petreus returned, the couple had a son, Charles Carson, born June 30, 1897. The attempt on Lhasa Susie Rijnhart's route in 1898, starting in the north and ending in Kangding The Rijnharts, baby Charles, and three local hired men, two Chinese and one Muslim, left Tankar on horseback, May 20, 1898. Their destination was Lhasa, eight hundred miles away as the crow flies but across a series of mountain ranges through passes at elevations of up to . They carried with them food and other supplies sufficient for two years as well as several hundred bibles translated into Tibetan. Following a known caravan route to Lhasa, they skirted the Tsaidam and proceeded southwest, roughly following the track a modern highway follows today. All went well for more than two months until their two Chinese hired men deserted. Shortly thereafter, on August 11, five of their pack animals were stolen. On August 21, the baby Charles died suddenly. They were at this time just north of the district capital of Nagchu, in elevation. As they continued Tibetan soldiers tried to persuade them to abandon their quest and return the way they had come. A Tibetan official in Nagchu refused to allow them to continue to Lhasa, only 100 miles further south, or to remain in Nagchu, but insisted they leave Tibet via a caravan route leading to Kangding (Tachienlu), 600 miles to the east. Their reliable Muslim guide departed at this time, with their permission, to journey to his home in Ladakh and they were left alone at the mercy of the Tibetans. Petrus Rijnhart, 1866-1898. On September 6, in a snow storm, with three guides provided by the Tibetan government, the Rijnharts departed Nagchu on the \\"tea road\\" east. On September 17 their little caravan was attacked by bandits. One of their guides was wounded and all their horses except three were stolen. Their guides deserted and they were left alone. They abandoned most of their goods and continued. On September 26, Petrus left Susie behind to seek help from Tibetans camped on the other side of a river. She never saw her husband again. She was left with a revolver and a supply of silver bullion, the currency of the area. Susie engaged guides to accompany her on the road, but they proved faithless. She threatened them with the revolver to prevent being raped and robbed. She finally arrived at Gyegu (Jyekundo), rested a few days, and there negotiated a passport from the Abbot of a monastery. She then proceeded onwards, crossing a series of mountain ranges, partially on foot and alone, but mostly with an escort of local guides. She arrived in Kangding penniless, in rags, and with frost-bitten feet on November 26, 1898. Kangding at that time was the most remote outpost of Christian missionaries in China. She asked the way to the house of the China Inland Mission and there she introduced herself to missionaries Edward Amundsen and James Moyes, who would later become her second husband., is the sole source of information about the Rijnhart's journey. Later life Investigations by the British and Dutch government uncovered no information concerning the fate of Petrus Rijnhart and in 1900 Susie returned to Canada. She wrote a book about her experiences and lectured and in 1902 returned to China, this time to Kangding with the Foreign Christian Missionary Society. In 1905 she married James Moyes. Because of her former husband‚Äôs dismissal from the CIM, Moyes had to resign from the CIM to marry her. Her health failed, and she was replaced by Zenas Sanford Loftis at the Tibetan mission.McLean, Archibald (1912). Epoch Makers of Modern Missions. New York: Fleming H. Revell. p. 283. In 1907 she and her husband returned to Canada. She had a baby, a son, in January 1908 and died on February 7, 1908 in Chatham. James Moyes returned to China in 1911 and in 1915 was working for the American Bible Society in Nanking. Importance Dr. Susie Rijnhart typified the independent and adventurous women, often missionaries, who were beginning to travel the world and practice a variety of professions. Her attempt to reach Lhasa seems to have been as much an adventure gone wrong as it was a Christian pilgrimage. Her book makes no mention of any converts to Christianity the couple made during their four years in China and Tibet. How familiar she was with her first husband‚Äôs unsavory past is unknown.

NAFWS was incorporated in 1983 to develop a national communications network for the exchange of information and management techniques related to self-determined tribal fish and wildlife management. History At the beginning of 70's and early 80's, many Native American tribes in the United States began to take a more proactive approach to the management of their natural resources, especially fish and wildlife resources. This was prompted by the increase of tourism on reservation lands which included recreational opportunities like hunting and fishing. This was set into motion by legislation established by Congress, Public Law 93-638 better known as the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. This was followed by several legal cases, including New Mexico v. Mescalero Apache Tribe, Washington v. Confederated Tribes of the Colville Indian Reservation and White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, that were heard by the Supreme Court, which recognized the Tribes sovereignty and jurisdictional right to manage their own fish and wildlife resources within reservation exterior boundaries. These rights continue to be contested in various forms by the State and Federal governments today. This actions led to the formation of a national organization, established to assist tribes in the development and protection of Indian fish and wildlife resources. The Society was founded in 1982 prompted by a few dedicated individuals who came together in July 1981 on the Warm Springs Reservation to attend a Tribal Fish and Wildlife Workshop sponsored by the Native Tribe and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. It was there that several individuals, among them Nathan Jim \\"Eight Ball\\",Gerald \\"Buzz\\" Cobell, Herschel Mays, Doug Dompier, John Smith, Levi George, Butch Blazer and others, were instrumental in coming up with the strategy to develop a national organization now known as the Native American Fish and Wildlife Society (NAFWS). Buzz Cobell organized the first national meeting in Great Falls, Montana in 1982. The Blackfeet Tribe hosted the national Indian/Eskimo Fish and Wildlife conference. This meeting provided the nucleus and impetus for the first Society meeting, whereby the first Board of Directors were elected. Mr. Cobell was elected the Society's first President. Eight others to serve in that capacity since then: John Smith, John Antonio, Patricia Zakovec, Don Sampson, Ron Skates, Butch Blazer, Matthew \\"Cully\\" Vanderhoop and Joe Jay Pinkham III. Alongside its line of presidents, the society has had five Executive Directors since 1982. These include; Dewey Schwalenberg, Ella Mulford, Ken Poynter, Ira Newbreast and Donald \\"Fred\\" Matt. Regions and Land Base Today there are seven regions of the Society which include: Pacific, Southwest, Great Plains, Great Lakes, Northeast, Southeast, and Alaska--which was the last region to join the Society in 1992. The Society was founded on the knowledge that without wild animals, life would be deprived and demeaned, that they move the people through the great mystery of creation. Federally- recognized Indian tribes within the lower 48 United States have jurisdiction over a reservation land base of more than 52 million acres, or 81,250 square miles. Alaskan Native lands comprise another 45 million acres. To many Native Americans, this land provides a religious, cultural, and economic subsistence base. This base is being utilized by both Indians and non-Indians for recreation purposes. They also contain habitats that are critical to the recovery of various species listed as threatened or endangered. Mission The NAFWS's mission as a non-profit organization is to assist where possible the Tribes/Native Villages of Alaska with protection, preservation and to enhance the wise use of Native American fish and wildlife resources and associated habitats. The Society's purposes are charitable, educational, scientific and cultural. The primary purposes are as follows: * Assist in the facilitation and coordination of intertribal communications in regards to fish and wildlife matters including treaty rights issues * Court cases that may have an adverse impacts on the management of tribal fish * Wildlife and hunting/fishing regulations * Educate Native Americans involved in fish and wildlife management * Inform policy decision makers and other natural resource managers of the best management practices * Provide administrative support expertise and advice to tribal governments as it relates to fish and wildlife and recreation resources * Improve the general welfare of tribal people through education and technical assistance * Provide professional publications, promotional activities and conferences that provide a forum for disseminating information to society members and other non-Indian organizations, public officials and the general public. Funding The primary funding source for the Society comes from annual appropriations from Congress that are administered through various federal agencies. However, the Society also relies on funding from many sources that are non-governmental which include private and membership contributions. The society is an organization that is membership driven, with 1300 plus individual members and many tribes that are associate members. Activities Several promotional videos have been released to help the society in their outreach efforts, including \\"Our Native American Wildlife Heritage\\" (1987), \\"Circle of Life\\" (1992) and \\"Keepers of the Circle\\" in (1994). Training and education are also significant focuses of the society. The \\"Youth Practicum\\" was officially started in 1991 by Sally Carufel Williams. Many students have gone through the program, and quite a few of them have gotten involved in tribal natural resource management and other students have gone on to become tribal leaders in their own right. The society has also offered many training programs, including: law enforcement, fish and wildlife management, chronic wasting disease, VHS, and avian influenza. The society most recently has hired its own biologists who provide much of the training and technical assistance concerning disease issues and other request for fish and wildlife management where possible. In the early 1990s, the Society went to Congress to seek funding for a bison initiative that would help bring Tribes together in their efforts to re-establish bison herds are their lands. In 1991 several society board members and tribal bison managers held a meeting on how to better accomplish this. In 1992 the first funding was provided to the society for the development of an Inter-Tribal Bison Cooperative (ITBC). Participating tribes are in a unique situation because their advancing tribal natural resources agenda are often met with issues such as pressures for land development, threatened treaty rights, overlapping jurisdictions, and tribes losing land base. In order to address these issues, a group of Intertribal natural resource organizations have pulled together to host a tribal natural resource conference. In 1993, member tribes of the Society banded together to acquire funding of their natural resource management offices through legislation. The Native American Fish and Wildlife Society took the lead in this fight. H.R. 2874 was introduced into the House of Representatives. The bill was entitled \\"Indian Fish and Wildlife Resource Enhancement Act of 1993.\\" The bill aimed to reaffirm and protect Indian hunting, fishing, and gathering rights and to provide for the conservation, prudent management, enhancement, orderly development and use of the resource. It would also maximize tribal capability and flexibility in managing fish and wildlife resources for the continuing benefit of Indian people. A management component was developed under the bill. The bill passed through the House of Representative. It was then introduce in 1994 on the Senate side under S. 1526 under the title \\"Indian Fish and Wildlife Resource Management Act of 1994.\\" The states showed up in full force to oppose the bill. Their main contention is that the monies generated from the Pittman‚ÄìRobertson Act and the Dingell‚ÄìJohnson Act (PRDJ) would be used for these programs under the bill. PRDJ is an excise tax on the purchase of all equipment for hunting, fishing, hiking, and camping. The funds are divvied out to the natural resource department in each state and US territory and is separated according to the land mass of each state and territory. The tribes contend that since the states use tribal reservations to calculate total land mass that the tribes deserve a cut of the funds for their natural resource departments. The billed was tabled in the Senate.

The native population is endemic to Saratoga Springs, a small wetland in Death Valley National Park in the United States. Taxonomy The pupfish is a member of the genus Cyprinodon. Most divergence of Cyprinodon species likely took place during the early-to-mid Pleistocene, a time when pluvial lakes intermittently filled the now-desert region, though some may have occurred during the last 10,000 years. The evaporation of the lakes resulted in the geographic isolation of small Cyprinodon populations and the speciation of C. nevadensis. Ichthyologists Rosa Smith Eigenmann and Carl H. Eigenmann first identified Cyprinodon nevadensis in 1889. Later authors considered it the same species as Cyprinodon macularius. In the 1940s, Robert Rush Miller again described C. nevadensis as a distinct species, and identified six subspecies, including C. n. nevadensis. Other subspecies include the Amargosa River pupfish (C. n. amargosae), the Ash Meadows pupfish (C. n. mionectes), the Warm Springs pupfish (C. n. pectoralis), the Shoshone pupfish (C. n. shoshone), and the extinct Tecopa pupfish (C. n. calidae). Description Male Saratoga Springs pupfish are bright blue in color, while females are a drab olive-brown. The fish have a standard length of , and the total length is rarely greater than . The diet of C. n. nevadensis is typical of pupfishes. Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) are the primary food source, for which their lengthy guts are particularly well adapted. Ostracods, copepods, and the larvae of chironomids provide seasonal nutrition. Mating behavior differs from stream-dwelling pupfishes but is similar to other spring-dwellers. Males defend territories in which females lay eggs throughout the year. While the fish are capable of surviving a wide range of temperatures, reproduction is limited to a narrower range (). Distribution and habitat Ponds at Saratoga Springs The fish is only known to occur naturally at Saratoga Springs. A diameter, deep spring pool overflows into several ponds totaling about . The temperature at the spring is a near constant , while the ponds fluctuate seasonally between . Fish at all life stages are found in the ponds, but juvenile fish are not known to occur in the spring itself. A population was introduced at Lake Tuendae, an artificial pond in Zzyzx, California, but reports conflict as to its continued survival there. Conservation The Saratoga Springs pupfish carries no official conservation status. The state of California has identified it as possibly qualifying as threatened based on its limited distribution and the possibility that distant groundwater pumping may deplete the aquifer that supplies Saratoga Springs. The aquifer may extend to as far away as western Utah. Groundwater depletion in the Las Vegas Valley, to the northeast, is of particular concern. In order to protect the pupfish and several other sensitive species, the National Park Service prohibits visitors from entering the wetland at Saratoga Springs.

Araabmuzik made a name for himself by performing beats and instrumentals live and in real time on a Music Production Center (MPC) drum machine. He uses MPC to produce rapid, rhythmic drum patterns and creates melodies with samples and other sounds. Araabmuzik's musical style includes EDM and hip hop, with live elements making a significant contribution to his sound. He has performed on the EDM festival circuit and other live club performances. Over the years, Araabmuzik has continued to build his fame through releasing solo instrumental projects, and producing for hip hop artists such as Cam'ron, ASAP Rocky, Fabolous, and Joe Budden. Early life Araabmuzik was born and raised in Providence, Rhode Island, into a musical household. His mother was a professional singer. He is the middle child of three and is of Dominican and Guatemalan ancestry. Abraham has said he learned to play the drums at age three and later began playing the keyboard. Despite not being well known for it, Abraham found a lot of hip hop inspiration in his native home town of Providence. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs definitely a lot of Hip-Hop here. You‚Äôll find a lot of local rap groups, solo artists out here that are trying make it, it‚Äôs just the fact that we‚Äôre not on the map like that just yet.‚Äù Having a musical background lead to Araabmuzik to begin producing hip hop, and had begun getting traction in the industry at a very early age. Having a natural inkling towards the MPC, he went on to buy his first unit in 2005. By 2006, at age 17, he had begun being noticed by Diplomat Records. Career= 2005 - 2010: Diplomats  After meeting with record producer and A&R; of Diplomat Records, DukeDaGod in 2006, he became affiliated with the Dipset label. He began making beats for Diplomat artists such as Hell Rell and Cam'ron. In 2009, AraabMuzik was featured as a main producer on rapper Cam'ron's album Crime Pays, producing the single \\"Get It In Ohio\\". From 2009 to 2010, he contributed many instrumentals to a series of mixtapes called Boss of All Bosses by Cam'ron and upcoming rapper Vado.  2010 - 2015: Trance Party & Electronic Dream  In 2010, The Diplomats released Dipset Trance Party, an instrumental mixtape featuring artists (including AraabMuzik) employing a style that melded trance music with hip hop influences. This would prove to become a large influence on AraabMuzik's future sound. His track \\"South Beach\\" sampled Alice Deejay's \\"Better Off Alone\\", which AraabMuzik has said sparked his signature samples of electronic music. The first popularization of his new sound appeared in the comeback single \\"Salute\\" of rap group The Diplomats, also in 2010. In an interview with NPR he called \\"Salute\\" a different sound \\"that pretty much got me into the EDM\\". AraabMuzik released his breakout independent project Electronic Dream in 2011, which brought this signature sound of his production to the forefront. It was met with largely positive reviews and garnered him a large enough audience to begin touring internationally, getting booked for various clubs and shows to perform his music using the drum machine as an instrument. Along with additional releases, Abraham also steadily gained more popularity from videos on YouTube of him using the MPC to make live beats and drum patterns. He was also featured on the Akai Pro website as an official Akai Pro artist, alongside other MPC users such as Alchemist and DiViNCi.  2016: Dream World  To complement Electronic Dream's sound and success, AraabMuzik began working on a full length official album Dream World, slated for a 2015 release. However, it ended up being delayed numerous times; he was quoted saying \\"I pushed it back so I could still really perfect it and work on it more, because I didn't really feel like I was satisfied with it.\\" Dream World was released in July 2016, to generally favorable reviews. Although initially meant to sound like Electronic Dream, AraabMuzik decided to venture into a more eclectic album, catering to fans of different genres, both Electronic and Hip Hop, as well as experimental beats such as \\"War Cry\\". Artistry= Artist Name  Abraham's artist name was given to him by a friend when he began producing - initially Young Arab, \\"I pretty much just ran with it, added an extra 'a' to it, and then later down the line I added 'muzik.\\" Although the name has cause confusions about his origins, he became very famous very quickly, resulting in it being too late to change it. \\"It's something I'm stuck with, like you have your first phone number and you never changed it throughout the years, you just kept it.\\"  Influences  Abraham has cited Swizz Beatz as a major influence, and the two have said to have a brotherly relationship. He's gone on to say, \\"He had his own distinguished sound. He was always using the keyboards and playing his own stuff. Nothing was sounding like anything he was doing.\\" Other influences include Dr. Dre, Premier, J Dilla, 9th Wonder, and Alchemist.  Production Style  AraabMuzik's style often employs samples arranged and triggered in real time on the MPC drum machine, with fast-paced drum patterns involving rapid hi-hats and kick drums. He has used samples from a variety of music, including electro, dubstep, trap, gabber, and trance music. Although his main tool is still an Akai Music Production Center (MPC) drum machine, he has also used keyboard controllers and occasionally live drums. He has worked with several artists including ASAP Rocky and ASAP Mob, Cam'ron, Azealia Banks, Vado, The Diplomats, Hell Rell, Jadakiss, Busta Rhymes, 50 Cent, ArJaye the King, Eminem, and Slaughterhouse among many.  Creative Process  In an interview Araabmuzik revealed that he made all of his music while sober.  Controversies  In November 2012, trance producer Adam K accused Araabmuzik of plagiarism for the records that he had sampled on Electronic Dream without giving proper credit. In early May 2013, AraabMuzik was shot in an attempted robbery. He was walking around his neighborhood in the company of his friends when several men attempted to take his money. He resisted and was shot in the process. In October 2015, a track was supposedly leaked from the unreleased Dream World album featuring R&B; artist Kelela, named \\"Final Hour\\", much to Kelela's disappointment and frustrations which she expressed on Twitter. Araabmuzik's management released an official PR release claiming no responsibility for the leak. In February 2016, AraabMuzik was shot again as a victim of an attempted robbery in Harlem. He had gunshot wounds to his jaw and arm. Abraham has spoke very little about these incidents having said ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs really not much to speak on [with] something like that,‚Äù in an interview with Noisey.

The event has centuries of tradition and is included in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists. The procession is a unique ceremony of a special piety, and an expression of a religious and cultural identity of the inhabitants of the middle part of the island of Hvar that has been held for five centuries. Their 8-hour duration, in which everyone passes 25 km is also notable, as is its stress for its passion play content. The backbone of the procession is the Gospin plaƒç (Croatian: Weeping of the Lady), octosyllabic Passion text from the 15th century that in the form of music Dialog sing chosen singers, kantaduri . Description The procession Za kri≈æen every year starts at exactly at 22 hours so that six Processions start simultaneously from six Parish churches from the middle part of the island, in villages Vrbanj, Vrboska, Jelsa, Pitve, Vrisnik and Svirƒçe. Every Procession revolves in that big circle, so that in 7 in the morning every one would return in its own starting point. Every procession is led by a crossbearer carrying a cross. The role of the crossbearer is an immensely big honor on the island, and is determined as many as 20 years in advance. The crossbearer goes in the accompaniment of helpers, two followers that carry the big candle holders, two lead singers and several responders that sing the Gospin plaƒç. All are dressed in formal suits ‚Äì white brotherhood tunics. By number, the biggest one is the Procession of Jelsa, in which the number of pilgrims can surpass one thousand. Others are significantly smaller, and only the one from the village Pitve can surpass one hundred pilgrims. The Procession of Jelsa is also specific after the custom that the crossbearer runs across the last hundred meters of the way! Passing through all six villages included in the procession, the participants show their piety in all the churches on the way. The priest in every of the churches blesses the crossbearer and encourages him, and the singers sing the Gospin plaƒç, and the walking continues. The processions must not meet, and to accomplish this, their movements are carefully coordinated. During the way, the pilgrims pray and sing, and particularly impressive is the singing of the Gospin plaƒç in the original form. On Good Friday these six villages relax, until the pious people have rested from the exhausting night. Only in the afternoon hours the villages come to life when the locals go to participate in the piety of the Holy Week. History of the procession Emergence of the Procession is bound to the Crucifix of Sveti kri≈æiƒá (Croatian: Holly Little Cross), that is kept in the Hvar Cathedral since 1510. After the records in the Archive, Sveti kri≈æiƒá was in 1510 in care in the house of Nikola Bevilaqua. In the time of turmoil between the commoners and the nobility on 6 February 1510. Sveti kri≈æiƒá has started to bleed. Then on Hvar started the intense worship of the Cross. The first written record of the procession dates from 16 February 1658. In 2009 the tradition of the Procession Za kri≈æen was written in the UNESCO's Lists of Intangible Cultural Heritage.

This contrasts greatly from commercial sponsorship because the benefits of the endorsement go to the individual talent or programmers, while the stations and networks receive no revenue.  History  In the 1950s, concern over illicit business practices in television and radio including; plugola, payola, and rigged game shows led to congressional and U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) hearings. In 1959, Attorney General William Rogers reported to President Dwight Eisenhower that deceptive and false advertising and programming was becoming a trend in the United States, and needed to stop. In that same year, FCC Chairman John Doerfer presented his plan to expand public service programming on television networks. The plan called for some public service programming in prime time slots, which did not occur before this. The networks likely had the same agenda as Doerfer, to regain the respect of the viewers, and agreed to Doerfer's plan. By 1960, amendments were made to the Communications Act of 1934 to punish those who engaged in these illicit acts in the future.

History Maternalism emerged in the late 19th century, as a companion to progressive reform. The theology followed the idea that women had in-born qualities based on their maternalistic instincts. These inborn qualities qualified women to operate outside the home. Women of this time argued that women were uniquely qualified for certain jobs and places in the political sphere based on their domestic abilities and child-rearing qualities. This political mindset continued into the 20th century, influencing government reform and females in the workplace. Maternalistic professionals, particularly medical doctors, do not dictate to people what to do. They guide their clients gently and give them autonomy without making them feel totally alone or unsupported. Maternalistic people allow people to make decisions, even if they end up being mistakes in the long run.Maternalism in Medicine at Huffington Post Impact=Progressive reform Social settlements, founded mainly by middle-class women, became popular in urban environments in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They provided public housing and resources to working-class people and newly arrived immigrants. Middle-class women who ran these settlements worked with immigrants for progressive reform, such as the regulation of workers' compensation and child labor laws. Major settlements included Hull House in Chicago and Toynbee Hall in New York City. New female professions Acceptable female work during this time included school teachers and nursing. In 1910, 5%-6% of Doctors were female; 1% of lawyers were female; 1% of Clergy were female. Women achieved greater success in creating female oriented jobs than breaking into male dominated jobs during this time, by creating professions designed around their domestic and maternal qualities. Home Economics emerged in the 1890s at MIT and the University of Chicago. Women studied science and used experiments to influence politics. Female-led labs studied ways to create cleaner water and better American sewers. Public Health Nursing was created as an alternative to traditional nursing. This allowed women to have their own private practices and to not have to work under men. However, most women served communities who couldn't pay, which limited their resources and income. Social work primarily operated in social settlements, serving immigrant women and children. Since many of their clients could not pay, social workers were key players in pushing for progressive reform. Major players Ellen Swallow Richards was a chemist who graduated from Westford Academy (second oldest secondary school in Massachusetts) in 1862 and founded Home Economics. Richards set up labs at universities across the country aimed at sanitation and teaching women the sciences. Richards was a key player in maternalist politics as she applied her scientific knowledge to domestic issues in politics, pushing for good nutrition and sanitation. Lugenia Burns Hope was one of the first professional social workers. In 1908 in Atlanta Georgia she founded the Neighborhood Union, which aimed to mobilize and enfranchise poor black neighborhoods in the city. Jane Addams co-founded Hull House in Chicago in 1889. A strong proponent for maternalist politics and progressive reform, she started many initiatives such as clean food and clean drinking water, which gained momentum in the social movement. Critique Maternalism has been criticized on the grounds that it keeps women out of male dominated professions. It also reinforces a normalized idea of femininity, without considering the fluidity of gender. In the same way that advertisers had used images of strong working women to encourage women to enter the workforce in support of the war effort, advertisers after the war presented images of maternalism to pressure women to leave the workforce and return to their homes, so that positions could be filled by men returning from wartime. Women were told that their nurturing abilities would be better served waiting on their husbands and children.

Love and marriage Marriages were previously allowed between Burmese women and male foreigners provided that the divisional courts in Burma were informed within 21 days of advance notice. However, in May 2010, the government of Burma disallowed conducting of marriage ceremonies between Burmese women and male foreigners.

In 2000, the Asian Women's Resource Exchange (AWORC) published a report entitled Human Rights in Burma from the Forum News (August 1998) describing that by tradition, Burmese women are maternal self- abnegators, meaning that these women \\"consistently forgo their own needs in order to give their children first priority.\\" The report also indicated that rural and urban Burmese women were affected by the deteriorating economic climate in Burma.Human Rights in Burma, Asian Women's Resource Exchange (AWORC), 2000 As a result, Burmese families were \\"increasingly prioritising the rights of males over females to limited resources.\\" These changes affected the access of Burmese women to nutrition, medical services, vocational training, and other educational opportunities. Burmese women became unwilling porters and unpaid labourers for the military, including becoming victims of slavery, murder, torture, rape, and attacks.Human Rights in Burma, Asian Women's Resource Exchange (AWORC), 2000 Historically, urban Burmese women \\"enjoyed high levels of social power\\" but later became confronted with restrictions on speech and limitations in acquiring high level positions in both private and public offices. According to AWORC, only a few number of Burmese women receive education related to reproductive rights and safe birth control practices, thus making them prone to being infected by HIV and AIDS.

The three visionary architects Ricardo Porro, Roberto Gottardi, and Vittorio Garatti are interviewed on camera.

Pupils began attending Alban Middle School in the September 1976 after Bedfordshire County Council decided to implement the three-tier education system of lower, middle and upper schools across the county (as recommended in the 1967 Plowden Report). The school was officially opened in June 1977 by the then Bishop of St Albans, the Right Reverend Robert Runcie. The school was the first purpose built voluntary aided middle school opened in Bedfordshire by the Church of England Diocese of St Albans. The name of the school was subsequently changed by the school governors to Alban Church of England Middle School to reflect this link. On 1 April 2011 the school was converted to academy status and was renamed Alban Church of England Academy, becoming independent of local authority control. The Diocese of St Albans is the sponsor of the academy. In July 2018 Alban Church of England Academy shut its doors for the last time, after the decision was made to close the school due to the county reverting to the two-tier education system. The school essentially merged with next-door Great Barford Lower School to become Great Barford Primary Academy, spanning across both sites.  Controversies =Legoland protest Traditionally, year six pupils, having completed their SATS, were granted a school trip to the theme park Legoland. However, following minor complaints claiming the school was putting too much pressure on parents to pay for trips, the trip was cancelled for 2014's year 6s. In the following days, and largely orchestrated by year 8 pupils, a protest began in which angry pupils refused to go back to lessons after lunch. Remaining sat outside, cries of \\"we want trips!\\" turned into \\"we want chips!\\" much to the bemusement of the lunchtime staff. The protest was broken up by infuriated geography teacher Mike Nicholson, but went down in Alban history as an example of the class of 2016's solidarity and general epicness. The protest was described by then Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg as \\"the greatest strike action since Scargill.\\" Bread and butter policy In January of 2016, the school attracted attention from news media after warning that pupils without a packed lunch or ¬£2.10 payment, would not be given a hot meal, but bread and butter only. This was if the pupil's guardian couldn't be reached, and if the pupil had no other provision in place. The decision came after the school reported having to reimburse catering company Caterlink for 100 unpaid meals in a single month. The policy was not implemented after backlash from parents led to then head teacher Sue Lourensz apologising for 'any offence' caused.From BBC news: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks- herts-35381990.

The film was the subject of one of the largest copyright lawsuits in California. The two lawsuits are the first time that two different companies claiming the intellectual-property rights of the same movie are each suing the same alleged 5,865 BitTorrent downloaders. Plot A young Mexican nun, named Sister Sarah, is neglected and abused by a corrupt clergy that produces and distributes heroin. After a bad drug deal, she is handed over to thugs to be used as an instrument as sex for money. On the verge of death after being heavily drugged and wounded and raped, the nun receives a commandment from God to take revenge. Acquiring heavy weapons (including big guns and vibrators), Sister Sarah sets out to kill those who had abused her and are using the church for their own personal gain. The frightened drug lords in the church hires \\"Los Muertos\\", a violent motorcycle gang, to track her down and eliminate her. Los Muertos' base of operations is the local brothel \\"Titty Flickers\\", where they try to gather more information on the vigilante nun. After being wounded in a shootout, Sister Sarah hides out in a fleabag motel where she recovers and finally achieves vengeance by killing Los Muertos, degenitalizing Chavo (the brutal leader of Los Muertos), and saving her female lover who had been raped. But in the final scene, the clergy drug lord, known only as the Monsignor, hires another hit man to track down the vigilante nun, leaving the door wide open for a sequel. CastBitTorrent lawsuit On March 7, 2011, Camelot Entertainment Group, a film company based in Los Angeles, filed a federal lawsuit, Case No. CV 11-1949 DDP (FMOx), in the District Court for the Central District of California, against BitTorrent users who allegedly downloaded the movie between January and . The lawsuit which targeted 5,865 IP addresses, sought to compel ISPs to identify the defendants from their IP addresses. The company had until May 13 2011 to \\"show cause why the Doe defendants should not be severed and/or dismissed from this action based on improper joinder of parties or lack of personal jurisdiction\\". The Electronic Frontier Foundation acted as amicus counsel on the side of the defendants, who at that stage were known only by their internet IP addresses and rough geographic location. The lawsuit is seen as part of a courtroom- based strategy in which defendants are asked to settle or risk being named in a public lawsuit. If successful, the lawsuit could end up collecting more money than the movie earned at the box office. Incentive Capital of Utah also filed a nearly identical lawsuit against the same IP addresses with the same judge on May 6, 2011. On May 23, 2011, Camelot filed to dismiss their case, though the distribution group stated that they may refile the case in San Francisco. The lawsuit filed by Incentive Capital was dropped on June 10, 2011. Film rights Following the filing of the BitTorrent lawsuit, concerns have been raised as to whether Camelot Distribution Group actually owns the rights to the film. Camelot defaulted on a loan financed by Incentive Capital used to purchase the movie rights. Though Incentive Capital has already foreclosed on the film, Camelot has stated that the foreclosure was an improper \\"usurpation of its assets\\". Reception Felix Vasquez Jr. of Cinema Crazed gave the film a positive review, praising the lead performance of Asun Ortega, and called it \\" a fun and demented revenge pic that will surely please any respecting grindhouse buff\\".

Children 2 to 5 years of age have almost five times the amount of tooth decay as do children of the same age elsewhere in the United States. Children ages 6 to 14 have 4.5 times the amount, and adults are 2.5 times higher.Kantrowitz, Jonathan. Oral Health Care Model in Rural Alaska Villages. N.p., 6 Apr. 2011. Web.6 Apr. 2011. There are over 200 Native Alaskan Villages, many of which are very remote. Travelling to these villages are usually by boat, airplane, or snow machine. The cost of transportation is expensive and prohibits many of the villagers from leaving to get dental care and having dental care reached out to them for more than a few weeks a year. Further, these villages' being remote makes it difficult to obtain fresh food as groceries are expensive. Another problem in these villages is not having running water that contains fluoride, which helps keep teeth healthy. All of these factors lead to poor dental health. Additionally, Alaska‚Äôs rural villages don‚Äôt have the resources readily available to them, and most native populations have little to no access to education on the importance of dental health.W.K. Kellogg Foundation. Dental Health Aide Therapist Program . Michigan: Battle. Print. Funding for rural dentistry As traveling to rural areas of Alaska‚Äôs wilderness can be expensive, especially with all of the gear that a dentist requires, there is much funding that goes to this program. The first of this money came from The Snyder Act of 1921.Marx, Kitty. ‚ÄúOverview of Indian Health IHS, Tribes, and Urbans ‚Äù. Native American Child Health. American Academy of Pediatrics. Web. 6 April 2011. This was the first Act of Congress to appropriate funds to care for the health of the Indian population. The next Act to come was the Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 1976, signed on October 1 by President Gerald R. Ford. this Act would recognize the need for better health care among the Indian population,‚ÄúIHS Fact Sheet: Indian Health Care Improvement Act‚Äù.

Web. 7 April 2011. as their general health registered far below that of the general population of the United States The Improvement Act also appropriated funds for the facilities used for Indian and Alaska Native health care as most of these facilities were far below the quality obtained by other, non-Indian, health care facilities. The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 allowed Alaska Native Tribes and Regional Native corporations to contract with certain federal agencies to fund health programs and to allow these entities to deliver health, medical, and educational services to the American Indian and Alaska Native People.Rindner, Mark. ‚ÄúThe Alaska Dental Society, et al. v. SOA, et al. ‚Äù. In the Superior court for the State of Alaska: Third Judicial District at Anchorage. Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, 27 June 2007. Web. 6 April 2011. These efforts were combined in 1997 when the United States government required a few Alaska Native groups to form a tribal health consortium. This was accomplished with the creation of the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium which would manage the distribution of Indian Health Services money, allowing the Alaskan Native community to self-govern their own funds.

Scientists from RTI International and the University of North Carolina performed a study in June 2011 to evaluate Alaska's DHAT initiative on behalf of the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium. The study found that \\"Alaska's dental therapists are now providing safe, competent and appropriate care in their scope of practice.\\" According to the study, the DHAT program provided broader access to care and contributed to the local economy, whereas the itinerant dental care system had been failing for fifty years. Dentists Unlike a traditional dentist, a dental therapist isn't by technical definitions a true dentist, and can work independently of a licensed dentist's supervision. A certified dental therapist in Alaska receive two years of intensive training in a program uniquely suited to the challenges of Alaskan dentistry. After receiving this training, the graduate may perform basic dental work - this includes drilling, administering fillings, and extraction. More complicated procedures however, such as root-canals and more complex extractions, must be referred to a fully trained dentist.‚ÄúThe Alaska Dental Health Aide Therapist Initiative‚Äù Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium. Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium. accessed 4/23/2011 Thus far, the dental therapist program has been quite successful in providing safe, competent care for rural Alaskans. A 2011 study published by the RTI International found that dental therapists are technically competent to do their jobs effectively and safely, that their mission to successfully treat cavities and help relieve pain for people who have extremely limited access to health care has been successful, that patient satisfaction was very high, and that they are a well-accepted institution in tribal villages.WK Kellog Foundation. ‚ÄúNew Study Finds Alaska Dental Therapists Provide Safe, Competent, And Appropriate Care.‚Äù WK Kellog Foundation. October 26, 2010. April 23, 2011. These programs that offer a short period of training and rapid deployment into the field provide the rural Alaska bush with desperately needed health professionals, but are not without controversy. The Alaska Dental Association opposes the program, claiming that dental therapists, with their less than substantial training, offer sub-standard care, and have the capability to cause more harm than good with irreversible procedures. The ADA still continues to oppose dental therapist practicing without the supervision of a licensed dentist anywhere in the lower 49 states, and currently, therapists can only operate in Alaska.Berenson, Alex. ‚ÄúDental Clinics, Meeting A Need With No Dentist.‚Äù New York Times. April 28, 2009. April 23, 2011. Work in the villages The daily work of the dental therapist is in the rural village ‚Äì tiny, almost certainly lacking in comfortable amenities, and usually completely cut off from the rest of the world, accessible only by small aircraft and snowmobile in the winter. Rarely do the size of these villages exceed 750 people, and the populations of some number merely in the dozens. To practice dentistry here, the dental therapist must fly in both him or herself and most all of the equipment needed. Not all villages have dedicated clinics where the therapists can work. Instead, once there, the therapist must utilize back rooms, living rooms, stores, and even garages to set up the operation, and, quite often, this area also becomes the therapist's living quarters for the duration of his/her stay in the village. A therapist is lucky if this temporary living space comes equipped with running water or a working septic system ‚Äì often, more primitive solutions are required. Their stay can often resemble a camping trip, and a therapist is expected to bring his or her own sleeping bag and toiletries. Once there, the work must be done quickly in order to make sure everyone who needs care receives it before the dental therapist's supplies are exhausted. This often makes for an intense work schedule, and patients are operated on and sent on their way as quickly as possible. The typical dentist office in a rural village varies slightly for what one would expect from a traditional dental office. In a customary neighborhood dentist‚Äôs office one would expect a clean area devoted solely to the practice of dentistry, however, when dentists travel out to rural villages they are usually given an extra room somewhere in which to practice their trade.Burke, Dale. ‚ÄúVillage Health Care‚Äù Message to Author. 4 April 2011. E-mail. Many of these extra rooms are found in a local school or other communal establishments. A traveling dentist would receive some of the random places in which they can care for as many of the villagers as possible in the span of a week or two. In some of the larger villages there are offices established and devoted to the health care of the individuals living in and around these specific villages. In such establishments there are rooms that are to be used to administer the dental care needed. This building is one such building that has been erected to better carry out health care in rural Alaska.

The Queen's Blade series of visual combat books features a wide and diverse set of characters. The series focuses on a tournament called the Queen's Blade, a tournament held by the Gods every four years to determine a Queen. Only women are allowed to enter the tournament. The main character of the series is Leina, the heiress of the Vance Family and next in line to be countess, traveling to Gainos, the Queen's Capital, to participate in the Queen's Blade tournament. The characters of Queen's Blade are designed by various popular artists such as Hirokazu Hisayuki, Eiwa, Hirotaka Akaga, and F.S. Characters ; : :Leina is the middle sister of the Vance Family, an aristocratic family of nobles, and is next in line to be the successor. However, she has no intent of becoming countess, and runs away to venture the outside world and become a warrior like her late mother Maria, eventually becoming a contender of the Queen's Blade tournament. Leina dons silver armor with brown belts across, and is armed with a longsword called \\"Evindil\\" and a buckler as weapons. :In Queen's Blade Rebellion, after winning the tournament, she gives up her title as Queen to her sister Claudette to travel the world as , the Phantom Warrior. However during her travels, she contracted a mysterious disease that requires her to sleep 16 hours a day. Not only does she need to sleep that long, she also experiences sudden cases of narcolepsy, often requiring her to retreat to her hideout whenever she feels drowsiness. She aids the Rebel Army on their quest to overthrow the Queen. :Leina was created by My-HiME artist Hirokazu Hisayuki, while her CGI counterpart (known as ) is rendered by M-RS. ; : :Risty is a thief sporting fur-lined armor and has thick, tangled red hair. She has a Robin Hood personality, and is quite greedy at times when it comes to money; the reason why she steals is that she supports a shelter for children orphaned by war, as she was once orphaned herself when she lost her family to a dispute between nobles. She hopes to win the Queen's Blade tournament to help aid the orphans. She aids Leina early in her journey in the anime adaptation by stealing the Vance Family arms and armor that once belonged to Leina's mother and giving it to her. She is armed with a morning star and has a wooden shield mounted on her left arm. :In Queen's Blade Rebellion following her loss to Leina in the semifinals, Risty returns to the forest to resume her training. This resulted in her muscle strength being increased to the point where she discards her mace for hand-to-hand combat. Following Queen Claudette's reign of terror on the Continent, she founded the Rebel Army, funded by the distribution of dark magic stones. However, she was captured by the Queen's Army after the Swamp Witch cast an \\"indomitable curse\\" that made her unable to eat or sleep during a \\"Beautiful Fighter Hunt\\". Although she has been weakened after a long stay in prison, her fighting strength still remains. Her \\"organizational capacity\\" will fulfill an important role to Annelotte. :Risty was created by the artist Eiwa. ; : :Irma is a young woman who is the leader of the Assassins of the Fang, the Queen's secret police charged with taking out certain contenders who might be a threat to the Continent. She has a cold and emotionless personality, and is a highly skilled fighter who uses stealth to her advantage. In the original game's story, she is ordered by Aldra to kill Leina, but changes her mind when she faces her, and tries to kill the Queen instead during the tournament; however, she is soundly defeated and sentenced to death, only to be rescued by Echidna. In the anime, it is revealed that Irma was taken in as Echidna's disciple after she lost her brother in a dispute, and seeks revenge on the Queen by killing her. However, a broken promise led Irma to bear a grudge against her former teacher. She is armed with twin daggers. :Irma was designed and illustrated by Hirotaka Akaga. ; : :Nowa is a young elf girl who protects the animals living in the forest. However, because she is half-elf and half human, she is not trusted by the elves, as humans bear a severe prejudice against them. The only elf she trusts is Alleyne, her training instructor. One of Nowa's notable traits is that she wears no panties which often disturbs the other characters. She also refers to herself in third person. Because of an incident involving one of the Swamp Witch's minions, she was later exiled from her home by the Elf Council to fight in the Queen's Blade tournament. Nowa wears bright orange armor, has pigtails, and uses an iron staff as her weapon. She also has a pet monkey named Ruh, who has the ability to stretch its body to decent lengths to protect her from harm with its rock-hard fur. :Nowa was created by Katsuzo Hirata. ; : :Tomoe is a Warrior Priestess from the island of an alternate rendition of feudal Japan, and is a member of an elite order of warrior priestesses that protect their homeland. Her homeland is currently in a power dispute with schemers from the Imperial Court who plan to overthrow the Mikado, who is only a child. However, most of her fellow priestesses were attacked and killed by the Kouma Ninja in a plot by schemers at the Imperial Court, and Tomoe, armed with the sacred katana , enters the Queen's Blade tournament with Shizuka by her side in order to gain the power to rescue the Mikado from their machinations and avenge her sisters. Her official English name is \\"Musha-Miko Tomoe\\", and she is named after the historical female samurai Tomoe Gozen. :In Queen's Blade Rebellion, after awakening her ultimate skills in the tournament and returning to Hinomoto, Tomoe was acknowledged as the supreme warrior of Masakado Shrine, and was given the title of Sword Saint Priestess from the High Priest. However, during her travels in the Continent, a curse of blindness was cast on her by the Swamp Witch. Despite her loss of sight, Tomoe did not lose her burning heart and gentle smile. The day her eyes are opened again will probably be the day when the world will submit to Hinamoto's sword skills. She has yet to have a gamebook of her own so far in Rebellion. :Tomoe was designed and illustrated by the artist Eiwa. ; : :Echidna is a wild elf from the southern jungles with over 500 years of battle experience. In the past, she led the Assassins of the Fang and was Irma's former teacher, but is now a mercenary. She is considered a favorite to win the Queen's Blade tournament, but her current employer is unknown; all that is certain is that she herself has no interest in the throne. She was hired to protect Leina during the tournament, but she abandoned her mission to rescue Irma from her execution. She is an expert with blades, and has a pet snake named that she wears as a thong, having it help her fight on occasion. In addition, her armor has a snake motif. :Echidna is named after the Greek mythological creature Echidna, whose half-snake appearance is also an homage to her snake-themed armor. :Echidna was created by veteran artist F.S. ; : :Menace was a princess from the ancient Egyptian-themed . She once lived a life of luxury until she was betrayed by Anarista, her most trusted adviser, and died trapped in her palace as her kingdom fell into ruin. Four thousand years later, the powerful Swamp Witch resurrected her to become part of her army. However, Menace broke free from the witch's command and sets out on her own to restore the Amara Kingdom. She has a talking scepter named Setora, who does her bidding. As a result from her resurrection by the Witch, she acquired a \\"cursing power\\", black flames that she can summon from her fists to weaken her foes, with which she once hit Melona when she took Anarista's form to tease her. :Menace's name is a pun on the Ancient Egyptian ruler Menes, and shares the same katakana as the latter. :Menace is illustrated by veteran artist F.S. ; : :Elina is the youngest daughter of the Vance Family and Captain of the Vance Royal Guard. A prominent Queen's Blade competitor, she wears tiger-themed armor and is armed with a clawed gauntlet and spear as weapons. She was trained from a young age in all manners of martial arts, from stealth to strict military discipline, and acts as bodyguard, spy, and assassin for her father. Elina's personality is vicious and ruthless except in the company of her sisters, particularly Leina in front of whom she assumes a childlike personality. Aside from her skills with the lance, she can use \\"cursing words\\" to inflict damage directly to her opponent's head. She also has naughty thoughts about her sister Leina in which Leina wants no part in. In Queen's Blade Rebellion, Elina becomes the new leader of the Queen's Assassins of the Fang after the Vance House collapsed, and wears a brand-new set of armor while still retaining her trademark claw gauntlet and cat-eared headband from her previous armor. :Elina was created by Hirokazu Hisayuki. ; : :Airi is a scythe-wielding ghost maid and is the most loyal of the Swamp Witch's minions. An expert in espionage and assassination, Airi needs to feed on vitality in order to maintain corporeal form or risk vanishing. She feeds on humans through physical contact, specifically by kissing them. In the anime, she develops a bit of a soft spot for Cattleya's son Lana and eventually befriends him. Her official English name is \\"Infernal Tempter Airi\\". :Airi was designed by Kazuhiro Takamura. ; : :Nanael is an angel from Heaven and the overseer of the Queen's Blade tournament. However, Nanael has a hidden agenda of her own, as she plans to create a male harem and exile all of the women. Due to her foolish behavior in Heaven, she was put on probation and exiled to the mortal world by the Head Angel. As further punishment, she carries a vial of \\"Holy Milk\\", which she must not allow to be spilled; she loses powers in direct proportion to how much milk is lost from the vial. Nanael uses telekinesis in combat, and can manifest a sword called the which can fight independently of her in the anime. She also has various attacks such as the and the . Nanael's right wing is considerably shorter than the left one, forcing her to beat each wing at a different speed in order to fly properly. :Nanael's name is a portmanteau of (Japanese for the number 7) and the Hebrew word for \\"Deity\\" (◊ê◊ú, 'El). :Nanael is illustrated by Kuchuyosai. ; : :Cattleya is a swordswoman who owns a weapon shop in the small town of Vosk. A former adventurer, Cattleya was known as the for wielding an enormous greatsword with ease. She soon fell in love with another adventurer named Owen, who later became her husband, and together they had a son named Lana. However, their happiness was destroyed when Owen disappeared, and Cattleya enters the Queen's Blade to find him with Lana by her side. Her combat ability is hampered by Lana constantly clinging about her knees. While many of the female characters have big breasts, Cattleya's are exceptionally large, measuring 120 cm (48 in) in circumference. :Cattleya was designed by Hiraku Kaneko. ; : :Nyx is a young woman who, as a child, was once a peasant girl in the service of Count Vance. She was looked down upon and despised by those of higher station, and was frequently humiliated and abused by the Count's daughter, Elina. However, her life changed when she stumbled upon , an evil sentient staff, and was granted immeasurable magical powers. The staff also gives her a split personality: one with the kind and timid side she was born with, and the angry and vengeful side developed through the mistreatment from her career as a servant by Elina (when injected with Funikura's liquid). However, she is unable to control them effectively, and despite possessing a strong sense of justice, she is just as likely to set an entire village aflame to punish its evil leader. She takes on a gaudy clothing style mannerism so as not to be overlooked by her former tormentors, but the malevolent will of the evil staff she struggles to command continues to oppress her by sexually assaulting her. She entered the Queen's Blade tournament to prove her worth to those who have looked down on her through her whole life, as well as seek revenge against Elina, her former tormentor. :Nyx is named after the Greek goddess Nyx, who is known as the Goddess of the Night. :Nyx was designed by Masahiro Kuroki. ; : :Melpha is high-ranking priestess who is widely respected by her followers as a holy woman. Compared to the other competitors, her fighting ability in close quarters is minimal (she is only armed with a spiked flail and a small shield), but through the use of the , she possesses the ability to heal her own wounds and inflict divine punishment on her opponents through the use of provocative . In the anime, Melpha idolizes Nanael as an Angel of Heaven, which Nanael abuses in order to boss Melpha around as a servant. Much like Cattleya, her breasts are larger than normal. :Melpha was illustrated by popular doujin artist and character designer Zundarepon. ; : :Shizuka is a kunoichi and the leader of Hinomoto's . A money-grubbing assassin, she couldn't care less about the affairs of the battle as long as she gets paid; she just hates working hard in general and instead has a personal group of ninjas to aid her. It is implied through the original's game story that in the beginning, she was hired by Aldra to get rid of Tomoe. However, when she fought Tomoe and lost to her greater skill, she became her aide-de-camp as a result in her quest to free Hinomoto. She seems to have defected from her evil ways as a result of this, becoming more of an easygoing person in addition to abandoning her leadership over the Kouma. In the second anime adaptation, it is revealed that she has an intent of killing Tomoe by posing as her friend, and was later killed by the latter with her horned headband given as a trophy. This, however, turned out to be a lie as Shizuka wanted to kill off Tomoe's only weakness, and was willing to sacrifice her own life to do so. This makes her the first official character to die on-screen in the anime and in the Queen's Blade franchise. Shizuka does not have a game book of her own, yet has appeared in all other media. Her official English name is \\"Rogue Ninja Shizuka\\". :Shizuka was created by Eiwa. ; : :Melona is a shapeshifting, magic-using girl with a playful, yet sadistic personality who has the ability to take on any physical form, and is the Swamp Witch's strongest minion. She is composed of a pink liquid substance and can manipulate her constitution to create objects, move from place to place, and imitate people by taking on their shape while assuming their fighting skills and abilities. Because she is made of liquid, she is immune to any slicing attack, where her body would just regenerate. One noticeable use of her shapeshifting ability is her hair, which turns into hands that hold up her breasts and cover her nipples. Her primary offense is squirting a volatile substance from her breasts, as well as wielding a sword created from her hair. :Melona is created by F.S. ; : :Claudette is the oldest daughter of the Vance Family. Because she is an illegitimate child of the Count, she is not in the line of succession, and was raised without the care and devotion shown to her two half-sisters. She is charged with protecting Leina, the future countess, and wields a zweihander named Thunderclap which she can use to control lightning. :In Queen's Blade Rebellion, Claudette became Queen after Leina renounces the title to continue wandering the world. However, her strictness led to her becoming a ruthless tyrant, banning the Queen's Blade tournament as she proclaims herself to be \\"chosen by the Gods.\\" Along with a new set of armor, her Thunderclap sword also gained a significant upgrade through the power of the \\"Wizard Stones\\" (courtesy of Ymir), and can now manipulate lightning without readying the sword. :Claudette's name is taken from the ancient Roman Emperor Claudius. :Claudette was designed by artist Hirokazu Hisayuki, with illustrations in the gamebooks provided by 2-go. ; : :Ymir is the daughter of the Dwarven King who runs the Iron Mountain weapon factory, which is known for forging top-quality weapons. Ymir entered the Queen's Blade tournament to prove the superiority of Dwarven weapons. In the anime, she has a strong one-sided rivalry with Cattleya as a weaponsmith. Despite her childlike appearance, Ymir is actually older than she looks, evidenced by her speech pattern which is reminiscent to that of an old man. She wields a massive battle axe and wears a special gauntlet that increases her strength, and spends most of her time hawking cheap weapons at inflated rates to the unsuspecting. Despite her strength, she has an intense fear of snakes, specifically from Echidna's snake Keltan. :In Queen's Blade Rebellion, she had her weapon broken during a fight with Claudette, and by her clan's law is forced to submit to her demands. After finding out her surprising talent in planning, she became one of Queen Claudette's closest associates and, along with her rich knowledge of alchemy, invented various items to strengthen the Queen's Army. She became much colder in personality, no longer being afraid of snakes, and rumors from those who knew the often teary-eyed Ymir say she is now another person entirely. She wields twin battle axes as weapons, and wears a new set of Dwarven armor modeled after the gothic lolita style of fashion. :Ymir's name is taken from Norse mythological being Ymir. :Ymir was illustrated by Natsuki Mibu. ; : :Alleyne is a 1000-year-old elf and the most seasoned veteran warrior of a tribe of forest elves. She is taciturn and blunt in her dealings with others (her most notable trait is when she gives points to her opponents based on their performance), and had a long relationship with Echidna, whom she often chastises for her loose ways but is mocked in return for her inexperience with men, being called \\"The Thousand Year-Old Virgin\\". The appearance of the half-elf Nowa in the forest elf community marked a turning point for Alleyne, who appointed her as \\"Guardian of the Forest\\". The Elf Council did not approve, however, and banished her from the village with the excuse that she must join the Queen's Blade tournament. Unwilling to abandon Nowa, Alleyne secretly sets out for the tournament as well. Following the tournament, she and Nowa went their separate ways. :In Queen's Blade Rebellion, it is revealed that Alleyne is the last elf of her tribe following a genocide in her forest by the Swamp Witch's forces, and that the Swamp Witch placed a curse on Alleyne that forbids her from leaving the forest. During that time, she met Annelotte, who was trying to escape from Queen Claudette's Assassins. After tending to her wounds, she, after some persuasion from Annelotte, takes her in as her second disciple. She was the first to witness Annelotte's demon powers when a lightning storm struck the forest. :Alleyne is illustrated by MatsuRyu. ; : :Aldra is the victor of the past two Queen's Blade tournaments and reigning Queen of the Continent. As the child of the Pope, the highest religious leader, and the daughter of the Devil King of the Netherworld, she is a cursed half-demon who, along with her sister, was persecuted everywhere they went. One day while searching for some food, Aldra's sister disappeared. She soon made contact with the fallen angel Delmore, whom she made a contract with and gained demonic powers at the cost of her growth. She then became determined to win the Queen's Blade and use her power to search for her lost sister. Because of her current position as Queen, she would often have fits of paranoia over the fact that someone might overthrow her, which led her to establishing the Assassins of the Fang. Her official English name is \\"The Queen Aldra\\". :Aldra has the ability to encase people in an amber-like prison through the use of her \\"Evil Eye\\", which is located on her right side hidden under an armored eyepatch. For close combat, she wields a broadsword called the , and has a hidden weapon called the Secret Cleaver located in the groin area of her armor, which pays allusion to BDSM. She also has the ability to summon shikigami called Minions to slow down her opponents. :In Queen's Blade Rebellion, after losing the title of Queen to Leina (later Claudette), Delmore, the source of her powers, was stripped from her body, and reverted to her true adult form after her defeat. She later embarked on a journey to find her lost sister, but suffered from amnesia along the way. During her journey, she fell in love with a man and was later married. Her happy life was short-lived when the war between the Queen's Army and the Rebel Army spread throughout the whole Continent. To protect her beloved husband, she was determined to throw herself in the fight, and made a contract with the Underworld dwellers and (an amalgamation of the demon Belphegor). However, both demons are secretly plotting to eat Aldra when given the opportunity. Her current outfit pays homage to the \\"naked apron\\" anime stereotype that is usually found in ecchi anime and manga. :Aldra was created by the popular illustrator and game character designer Kantaka. Video game characters=Main characters ; : :The main heroine of Queen's Blade: Spiral Chaos. She is described as a Novice fighter, but over the course of the game, the players will learn of Cute's mysterious being tied with special powers that can decide the fate of the world. Due to her small bust size, some cutscenes show her with low-esteem. Illustrated by Poyoyon Rock. ; : :A young and rather cowardly sorcerer employed by Cute's family as her bodyguard in the Queen's Blade Tournament. Despite being a coward, Jean is skilled at capturing Gal Monsters and does not hesitate to put his life on the line for the sake of Cute. Due to being surrounded by several well-endowed and scantily-clad women, Jean is prone to perverse delusions and excessive drooling. Amongst the ladies, he took the most interest with Tomoe, even calling her \\"Tomoe-chan\\" out of affection. Illustrated by Poyoyon Rock. Antagonists ; : :A well- endowed sorceress in the employ of the two Dragon goddesses. In the game, when she and Lamica are unable to defeat Cute and the others, she enlisted the help of the Amaran Princess Menace. ; : :The boisterous young succubus partner of Dora. She is encountered several times in the game and has the habit of taunting Cute and the others into a fight. Gal Monsters ; : :One of the three kinds of Gal Monsters which Jean can capture in the game. P√ºia is a harpy. ; : :One of the three kinds of Gal Monsters which Jean can capture in the game. The Arachne appears as a young and cold-hearted girl in a yukata with spider leg-like hair which she uses in attacking. ; : :One of the three kinds of Gal Monsters which Jean can capture in the game. Cerate is a fierce dinosaur with an affection for her captor. Other characters ; : :Count Vance is the father of Claudette, Leina and Elina. ; : :The matriarch of the Vance Family and the wife of Count Vance. Wearing armor with a tiger motif, she had formidable sword skills, and the same \\"cursing words\\" Elina uses. She participated in the last Queen's Blade tournament, but lost her life, resulting in the Count's contempt for the tournament. Her last request to Claudette was to ease her husband's burden. ; :A great warrior in the ancient Amara kingdom, hired by Menace's father to teach her daughter about unarmed martial arts. Seduced by the king of the rival kingdom with promises to become the next Queen, she betrayed Amara by bringing a huge gift filled with rival soldiers, in a manner most reminiscent of the Trojan Horse. After Menace noticed the invasion and asked for her help to save her dying father, Anarista revealed her betrayal, defeated her and humiliated her before killing Menace. ; : :A \\"Living Scepter\\" with the head of a cat and Menace's most loyal servant. He is very perverse towards other women, and seems to find an interest in Shizuka after he rescued her in the first anime adaptation. Exclusively in the English anime, he uses sexual euphemisms. His name is a portmanteau of \\"Scepter\\" (his form) and \\"Tora\\", the Japanese word for tiger (his motif). ; :A mysterious and powerful witch who is never seen in the story, yet her influence is felt throughout the land. She is the master of Airi and Melona, and is responsible for Menace's resurrection. During the Queen's Blade story, she sends Airi, Melona and Menace, in the guise of contestants, to disrupt the Queen's Blade tournament. In the anime, the Swamp Witch's minions communicate with her by magic. :In Queen's Blade Rebellion, the Swamp Witch's ambitions to eventually rule the Continent went a step further. She had resurrected and empowered the long-dead pirate Liliana to lead an army of undead. She was also responsible for the genocide of the elves and for inflicting magical curses on Alleyne (restricting her movements to within her forest), Risty (making her unable to eat or sleep during a \\"Beautiful Fighter Hunt\\") and Tomoe (leaving her blind). It was also revealed that the Swamp Witch owned a gladiatorial arena where slaves and monsters fought each other. She has been manipulating Queen Claudette's reign behind the shadows in an attempt to eliminate those who could pose a threat to her own ambitions (i.e. the Rebel Army) in the future. :The Swamp Witch makes a full appearance in Rebellion as Werbellia, the demonic mother of Aldra and Annelotte. ; : :Nanael's best friend. ; : :The leader of all of the angels in Heaven and the organizer of the Queen's Blade tournament. ; : :The son of Owen and Cattelya, he is usually seen near or attached to Cattelya's leg as she is his only remaining parent and he is far too young and timid to move on his own. During the events of the anime, he would start to gain some courage when bravely fighting against Melona when he went to rescue Cattelya and (unbeknownst to him) his father Owen during the finals of the Queen's Blade tournament. During the tournament, he makes friends with Airi along with some of the other female competitors. ; : :Aldra's master and one of the key demons from Hades. He imbues Aldra with some of his power at the cost of her forever staying as a child (which was when she went to go look for her long-lost sister). Aldra would finally reject him after losing to Leina in the finals and learning the truth behind her sister's disappearance, thus leaving him to search for someone else stronger. In Beautiful Fighters, he forces Aldra to make another contract with him when he captures her while she and Tomoe were visiting Tomoe's home. Aldra would once again break Delmore's control over her and, with the help of Shizuka's ghost (who came back to stop her rampaging brother), was finally able to seal away Delmore once and for all. ; :Cattelya's husband and Lana's father. Known as the , he was once a great traveler and hunter who had gone looking for a mystical treasure, being forced to leave the at-the-time-pregnant Cattelya to tend for herself and their child. It would come to pass he met Queen Aldra and was encased in amber by the Queen's Evil Eye. After being freed by his son Lana, Owen, Cattelya and Lana return to Cattelya's village to live out their lives. Owen is voiced by Wayne Grayson in English. ; :The owner of a souvenir shop in Gainos. Setora was displayed in his shop before Menace found him. He used to sell figurines of the Queen's Blade participants, but was discovered by Menace and Setora and threatened into handing them the money he had amassed, that they used to resurrect the Kingdom of Amara. He also acts as Hobby Japan's spokesperson, as all the posts in Queen's Blade's Staff Blog are credited to him. ; :A young boy who works as a servant of the Vance Family. He was ordered by Claudette to accompany and assist her younger sister Elina (much to her displeasure). At first Elina objects him from accompanying her as she feels that he will be a burden to her, but slowly she warms up to him. He is an intelligent and brave boy with a devoted, obedient but shy personality. He seems to look up to the Vance Sisters (especially Elina), who seem to act like sisterly or motherly figures to him. He possess some skills in swordsmanship and can be very strong at times.

Testing floors before and after they are in place on a property can assure a building owner that safe flooring has been chosen and installed for its intended use. This floor slip resistance testing method, developed by the McDonald's Restaurant chain and now specified by many other property owners (e.g. Westfield, Aldi, Toyota) assesses the effects of mild abrasion on wet slip resistance. This test identifies flooring that has a high propensity to lose its wet slip resistance. Pendulum floor friction tester in action  The Need for Sustainable Slip Resistance  The widely accepted principle of safety by design, as well as U.S. laws and building codes, require that flooring be slip-resistant over its life cycle ‚Äî not just at the time of installation. Safety criteria based solely on static coefficient of friction, often used in the U.S. for assessing safety, are too often misleading where flooring gets wet or otherwise lubricated in use. Over 150 safety criteria have been adopted in Germany and Australia for specific situations ‚Äî swimming pool decks, commercial kitchens, restrooms, etc. These are based on a laboratory test device, the variable-angle ramp, that is not readily portable. The pendulum tester is a portable ASTM method, has been used successfully since at least 1971 for assessing pedestrian traction potential, and is a national standard for pedestrian traction in 48 nations on four continents. Abrasion of a flooring sample, tested with the pendulum before and after, is being used to assess ‚ÄúSustainable Slip Resistance.‚Äù Some architects and property owners are now combining this pendulum-based test with situation- specific safety criteria to specify and verify safe flooring. If flooring is in an area where it can get wet or otherwise lubricated (airborne deep-fryer fat, automobile grease, etc.), it needs to be slip-resistant under such conditions. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that flooring accessible to disabled persons be slip resistant ‚Äî not just when the building is constructed, but throughout its lifetime. Typical building codes in the USA require that \\"Every existing building, structure, premises or portion thereof shall be maintained in conformity with the code regulations and Department approvals in effect at the time of such construction and occupancy ... Every existing building, structure, or portion thereof shall be maintained in a safe condition and good repair ‚Ä¶ all physical elements of every existing building, structure or portion thereof shall be maintained ‚Ä¶ by restorative means, in a condition as close as reasonably feasible to their originally required and approved state.\\" City of Los Angeles Building Code, 2008, Chapter 81, Section 8104, based on 2007 California Building Code and 2006 International Building Code If a building owner can be confident that his or her new flooring will sustain its slip resistance for a period of years this can protect a considerable investment in the flooring and prevent business interruptions as well as protect the safety of the pedestrian. The stakes are even higher for hotels and cruise ships, which are occupied virtually nonstop with guests who will not tolerate the noise involved in changing out hard flooring. Sustainable Slip Resistance (SSR) testing was developed by Strautins Strautins, C.J., ‚ÄúSustainable Slip Resistance: An Opportunity for Innovation,‚Äù Qualicer 2008, Castellon, SpainStrautins, C.J., ‚ÄúEnhanced Test Method for Assessing Sustainable Slip Resistance,‚Äù International Conference on Slips, Trips and Falls 2007: from Research to Practice in Australia for McDonald's Restaurants to identify flooring that is not highly susceptible to loss of its slip resistance from wear or some types of inappropriate maintenance. This test and appropriate selection criteria can help avoid investment in inappropriate flooring as well as prevent costly, life-altering accidents and increased healthcare costs. This article explains the method and how it can be used to improve flooring safety in the USA.  Test Methods and Safety Criteria = International test methods  Germany and Australia have for over 10 years had detailed flooring slip resistance standards based on some 150 specific situations ‚Äî e.g. external walkways, swimming pool decks, swimming pool stairs, commercial kitchens, hospital operating rooms, etc.Sotter, G., STOP Slip and Fall Accidents!, 2000, 204 pp., amazon.comCTIOA (a), Ceramic Tile Institute of America, ‚ÄúFloor Safety Reports: No. 3, Endorsement of Improved Test Methods and Slip Prevention Standards for New Flooring,‚Äù ibid., 2001 Many architects elsewhere in Europe have informally adopted them. The slip resistance ratings are based on humans walking an oily or wet flooring sample in standard footwear and/or bare feet on a laboratory variable-angle ramp the repeatability of which was extensively documented.Jung, K. and Schenk, H., ‚ÄúObjectification and Accuracy of the Walking Method for Determining the Anti-Slip Properties of Floor Surfaces,‚Äù (in German) Zentralblatt for Industrial Medicine, Accident Prevention and Ergonomics, 39, No. 8, 1988, pp 221‚Äì228, Germany However, the test results apply only to flooring before it is installed. In some cases initially good wet slip resistance is gone after the building has been open for only a few weeks. The ramp test can‚Äôt be used to assess safety of the flooring on site under the ambient conditions. The United Kingdom has since 1971 had well- established slip resistance standards based on a portable test method, the pendulum. This test was developed for pedestrian traction by the U.S. National Bureau of Standards in the 1940s and further refined in the UK.Giles, C., Saby, B, and Cardew, K., ‚ÄúDevelopment and Performance of the Portable Skid- Resistance Tester,‚Äù 26 pp., Department of Scientific and Industrial Research Road Research Laboratory Technical Paper No. 66, Her Majesty‚Äôs Stationery Office, 1964, United Kingdom It was validated for pedestrian traction in 1971, together with its safety standards, in the UK over a period of 25 years by 3500 real-world public walking area tests and site accident records.Greater London Council, GLC Bulletin No. 43, March 1971, London, United Kingdom, available in pdf form at SafetyDirectAmerica.com, ‚ÄúTesting and Instruments ‚Äî Pendulum‚ÄùGreater London Council, GLC Bulletin 145, February 1985, ibid The test is an ASTM standard (E 303), slightly modified for pedestrian traction.  ASTM C 1028 vs. Pendulum  In the USA, architects and designers generally look for a wet static coefficient of friction of 0.60 or higher by ASTM method C 1028 to assess potential safety for wet areas of level floors. This can give deceptive results, applying ‚Äúsafe‚Äù ratings to some flooring samples that are in fact very slippery when wet.Powers, C., et al., ‚ÄúAssessment of Walkway Tribometer Readings in Evaluating Slip Resistance: A Gait-Based Approach,‚Äù J Forensic Sci, March 2007, 52, No. 2, pp. 400-405 The method is now acknowledged by ASTM,ASTM, American Society for Testing and Materials subcommittee 21.06, meeting minutes, May 3, 2005, Orlando, Florida USA, 26 pp. Ceramic Tile Institute of America,CTIOA (b), Ceramic Tile Institute of America, ‚ÄúFloor Safety Reports: No. 1, Portable Methods,‚Äù ctioa.org, 2001 and Tile Council of North AmericaAstrachan, E., ‚ÄúInstaller Update: Updates to an American Method for Measuring Coefficient of Friction.‚Äù TileDealer, November/December 2007 to be inadequate for assessing safety. See \\"external links\\" at the bottom of this page for more information on the inadequacies of the C1028 test. The ASTM C1028 test was finally and permanently withdrawn by the ASTM in 2014. It was replaced by an only slightly better dynamic coefficient of friction test specified by ANSI A137.1. This test has been shown to correlate strongly with ASTM C1028, meaning the results can be very deceptive and a poor evaluator of slip risk. The ASTM C 1028 method does not represent the most current state of knowledge about testing methods, but this is not widely known by American architects and property owners. A more useful test and safety standards (safety assessment) for due diligence is based on the pendulum. The pendulum is now a standard test method for pedestrian slip resistance in 48 nations (European Committee for Standardization EN 13036-4, 2003 names many of them) on four continents and has been endorsed by Ceramic Tile Institute of America since 2001.  SSR Test Procedure  The SSR test procedure consists of an initial wet pendulum test; abrasion, wet, for up to several thousand cycles with a standard (100x100 mm 3M green Scotchbrite) abrasive pad under a standard load of 1 kg at 50 cycles/min; and another wet pendulum test after abrasion. Both hard and soft rubber pendulum sliders (or ‚Äútest feet‚Äù) might be used if the area is walked on in both hard-bottom footwear and bare feet or soft-soled footwear. The abrasion is conducted either manually or mechanically using a Gardco 12VFI linear washability and wear tester. Typically, about 85 percent of the loss in slip resistance after 5000 cycles has already occurred after 500 cycles. Depending on the flooring buyer‚Äôs situation, the flooring might be considered to have Sustainable Slip Resistance for a level floor if (for example) the wet Pendulum Test Value (PTV) is 35 or higher after abrasion for 500 cycles. The 500-cycle result in the laboratory has been found by in situ pendulum tests to be roughly equivalent to 6‚Äì12 months of wear in customer areas at a busy McDonald's Restaurant. The 500-cycle specification was adopted by McDonald‚Äôs in Australia in October 2006. Other major property owners such as Aldi, Toyota, Westfield and a major cruise ship company have adopted similar specifications. In the USA, flooring with SSR is available in ceramic tile, natural stone, and resilient products. Abrasive-containing coatings, some transparent, are also available that have SSR. In some cases, analogous to the variable-angle ramp test-related standards mentioned above, the SSR safety standards are situation-specificNatspec Technotes guidance for consideration, ‚ÄúSlip Resistance Performance,‚Äù NTN Des 001, July 09, http://www.natspec.com.au/Technical/tndesign.asp, AustraliaBowman, R., ‚ÄúSlip Resistance Testing: Zones of Uncertainty,‚Äù 24 pp., presented at Qualicer 2010, Castellon, Spain rather than ‚Äúone size fits all.‚Äù Thus a minimum pre-abrasion wet PTV of 35 might be required for hotel or hospital bathroom floors; a minimum of 45 (hard rubber slider) for stair nosings that get wet in use; and 54 (hard slider) for commercial kitchens and steep outdoor ramps. If the flooring is to be sealed after installation, the laboratory tests should be conducted with the correct sealer applied. Cleanability tests with expected contaminants (local mud, coffee, red wine, ketchup, etc.) by owners and/or other duty holders are also advisable before final selection of flooring. The methods of cleaningTari, G., with contributions by Brassington, K., Tenaglia, A. Thorpe, S., and Engels, M., ‚ÄúSlipSTD Publicly Available Specification (SlipSTD PAS)‚Äù, Version 6, revised, July 2009. should be planned. (A dirty mop with dirty water might not be adequate for slip resistant flooring, but abrasive pads can destroy wet slip resistance quickly.) Experience has shown that what is specified and ordered is not always what is delivered, and it is prudent for property owners to verify that flooring meets their slip resistance specification both before installation and at turnover of the property for occupancy. Monitoring of slip resistance every 3‚Äì12 months after that can further protect pedestrian, owner, and other duty holders.

Construction Goliah was built in New York City. William H. Webb built the wooden hull and T.F. Secor built the engine. The original purpose for Goliah was to tow sailing vessels in and out of New York Harbor.

During this time, Goliah was engaged in fierce competition with the New World, another steamer brought around from the East Coast in defiance of creditors. At one point, this competition produced gunfire between the passengers and crews of the two steamboats when Goliah, or so it is alleged, attempted to ram and sink the New World.'' Goliah was soon bought off by the California Steam Navigation Company, which was building a monopoly on Sacramento river shipping, and as a result was then placed on the ocean routes. Capt. George Flavel (1823‚Äì1893) ran the vessel. up north. Goliah was later made runs along the coast of California under the command of Capt. Robert Haley. In the spring of 1854, Goliah rescued the passengers of the steamship Yankee Blade which had wrecked off Point Concepcion. Goliah was subsequently shortened, and ran for many years as a towboat in San Francisco harbor, finally passing into the hands of the Wrights, a family of ship and riverboat captains. The Wrights again lengthened Goliah and placed the vessel on the route from San Francisco to Humboldt County. After a short time in this service she was abandoned and laid over on the Mission Bay mudflats in San Francisco until 1864, when Captain James Griffiths (1840‚Äì1887) fixed the steamer up as a towboat once more. Puget Sound service Goliah was bought by Pope & Talbot in 1871, and arrived at Port Gamble on 22 March 1871, in charge of Capt. William Hayden, who ran the vessel for a while and was succeeded by Captain Noyes and Capt. J. A. McCoy, who in turn gave way to Capt. S. D. Libby, who remained in command for twelve years. From the time the vessel arrived on Puget Sound until 1876, when the tug Tacoma appeared, Goliah towed more than half of the vessels that entered the Strait of Juan de Fuca bound for Nanaimo, and nearly all of those bound for the American side. In 1877 Goliah was extensively repaired, and a new boiler provided, which cost nearly ¬£15,000, its dimensions being, width , length, , diameter, . This a \\"low-pressure\\" boiler which drove a walking beam steam engine on steam at 18 pound pressure. The engine was a single-cylinder type, 50 inches in diameter with a stroke of 96 inches. Later years After Captain Libby left, the vessel was laid up at Port Ludlow for four years. Capt. William Selby then ran the tug for a year and a half, and Ed. Clements took charge of the vessel for a short time. He was succeeded by Capt. William Williamson, who continued in command for six years, until July 27, 1894, when Goliah was again laid up at Port Ludlow. The recently formed Puget Sound Tug Boat Company had deployed a powerful fleet of newer, powerful propeller-driven steam tugs, and Goliah could not compete with them. In 1895 the Goliah's hull below the water line was said to have been still in excellent condition, and it was further said with mechanical repairs, Goliah might be able to outlast the pioneer steamship Beaver, which had served 53 years until finally wrecked. With the loss of 'Beaver, Goliah then became the oldest steam vessel afloat on the Pacific Coast. After being idle from 1894 on, Goliah was deliberately burned at Duwamish Head by the scrapping firm of O.A. Bennett to recover the vessel's metal fittings. The old sidewheel tug S.L. Mastick was burned at the same time with Goliah. References * Newell, Gordon R., ed. H.W. McCurdy Marine History of the Pacific Northwest, Superior Publishing, Seattle WA (1966) * E.W. Wright, ed.

The Fahraeus effect occurs because the average RBC velocity is higher than the average plasma velocity. The F√•hr√¶us effect is the decrease in average concentration of red blood cells in human blood as the diameter of the glass tube in which it is flowing decreases. In other words, in blood vessels with diameters less than 500 micrometers, the hematocrit decreases with decreasing capillary diameter. The F√•hr√¶us effect definitely influences the F√•hr√¶us‚ÄìLindqvist effect, which describes the dependence of apparent viscosity of blood on the capillary size, but the former is not the only cause of the latter.  History  Fahraeus was a pathologist at the University of Uppsala in Sweden, and his interest in the suspension stability of blood and later in Hemorheology was motivated by the desire to understand the clinical effects of abnormalities in the aggregation and flow behavior of the formed elements. The aim was to ascertain whether blood obeyed the law of Poiseuille (Hagen‚ÄìPoiseuille equation). It was Hess in 1915 who proved that blood obeys the poiseuille law at high flow and low shear. The non-Newtonian effects were due to the elastic deformation of red blood cells. Fahraeus entered the scene in 1917 through his observation that sedimentation velocity of red corpuscles increases during pregnancy. He used the concept of buffy coat as the starting point of his work on red cell sedimentation and the more general problem of suspension stability of blood. He pointed out that fibrinogen was the principal protein involved in red cell aggregation leading to the formation of regular rouleaux and that the process was quite distinct from blood coagulation. He applied colloid principles to describe the stability of the suspension and more relevant to modern circulatory psychology was the study of aggregation of streaming blood and the relation between blood cell distribution, its velocity and apparent viscosity. He concluded the following results: (a) In high flow rates in tubes of diameter (< 0.3 mm) the concentration of red cells is lower than large feed tube, the reason being that, red cells are distributed in the axial core and their mean velocity is therefore more than the mean velocity of blood. There is an inverse relationship between tube hematocrit and mean velocity of blood. (b) Viscosity in smaller tubes of < 0.3 mm is lower than that of large tube and decreases with decreasing diameter. (c) The migration of blood cells from the tube wall to the axis depends on the particle size and not on the particle density. (d) At low flow rates, the red cells aggregate into rouleaux and these being the largest particles in the suspension migrate to the axis forming a core that displaces the white cells to periphery. Therefore, the concentration of white cells will be greater than that of feed tube and their mean velocity will be lower than that of red cells and the plasma. Mathematical model Considering steady laminar fully developed blood flow in a small tube with radius of r_0, whole blood separates into a cell-free plasma layer along the tube wall and enriched central core. As a result, the tube hematocrit H_t is smaller than the out flow hematocrit H_0. A simple mathematical treatment of the F√•hr√¶us effect was shown in Sutera et al. (1970). This seems to be the earliest analysis: : \\\\frac{H_t}{ H_0 }=\\\\frac{1}{2-(1-(\\\\frac {\\\\delta}{r_0}))^2} where: :H_t is the tube hematocrit :H_0 is the outlet hematocrit :\\\\delta is the cell-free plasma layer thickness :r_0 is the radius of the tube Also, the following expression was developed by Pries et al. (1990) to represent tube hematocrit,H_t, as a function of discharge hematocrit,H_d, and tube diameter. : \\\\frac{H_t}{ H_d }= H_d+(1-H_d)(1+1.7 exp (-0.415 D)-0.6exp(-0.011D)) where: :H_t is the tube hematocrit :H_d is the discharge hematocrit :D is the diameter of the tube in ¬µm See also *Cell-free marginal layer model *F√•hr√¶us‚ÄìLindqvist effect *Hemodynamics *Hemorheology References Further reading  * C.

This commission was created to research the role noncommercial educational television played on society in America. The 15 member commission attempted to carry out this goal by; distinguishing between commercial television, entertainment for large mass audiences: instructional television, in-class educational material, and public television. Public television was considered anything else that largely helped public affairs and was not supported by advertising. Early history The commission first gained momentum at the First National Conference on Long- Range Financing of Educational Television Stations in December 1964. Although not created until 1965, the commission was first incepted at this conference.  Public Television: A Program for Action  On January 26, 1967, the commission published its most famous and influential report on broadcast history, Public Television: A Program for Action. The reports main rhetoric was persuading America‚Äôs institutions (and proposing new institutions) to enhance educational television. Among the final recommendations in the report were; that a Corporation for Public Television be created to receive and disburse funds from the government and other sources, that it support at least two national and many local production agencies, that it seek ways to encourage interconnection of stations, and that sufficient funds, not subject to the annual appropriation process, be provided through a 2-5% tax on television receivers. The recommendations of the report were stated with 12 actions to be carried out by Congress and the Commission itself, although some of these actions were vague as to whom the primary target was.  Sections  The following actions were used by the Commission to persuade U.S. political institutions to enhance educational television, authorize the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and provide said organization with funds, and sponsor further research and studies to improve and advocate educational television. These actions also included steps that the proposed Corporation for Public Broadcasting should carry out to reach their goals. #‚ÄúWe recommend concerted efforts at the federal, state, and local levels to improve the facilities and to provide for the adequate support of the individual educational television stations and to increase their number.‚Äù #‚ÄúWe recommend that Congress act promptly to authorize and to establish a federally chartered, nonprofit, nongovernmental corporation, to be known as the \\"Corporation for Public Television.\\" The Corporation should be empowered to receive and disburse governmental and private funds in order to extend and improve Public Television programming. The Commission considers the creation of the Corporation fundamental to its proposal and would be most reluctant to recommend the other parts of its plan unless the corporate entity is brought into being.‚Äù #‚ÄúWe recommend that the Corporation support at least two national production centers, and that it be free to contract with independent producers to prepare Public Television programs for educational television stations.‚Äù #‚ÄúWe recommend that the Corporation support, by appropriate grants and contracts, the production of Public Television programs by local stations for more-than-local use.‚Äù #‚ÄúWe recommend that the Corporation on appropriate occasions help support local programming by local stations.‚Äù #‚ÄúWe recommend that the Corporation provide the educational television system as expeditiously as possible with facilities for live interconnection by conventional means, and that it be enabled to benefit from advances in technology as domestic communications satellites are brought into being. The Commission further recommends that Congress act to permit the granting of preferential rates for educational television for the use of interconnection facilities, or to permit their free use, to the extent that this may not be possible under existing law.‚Äù #‚ÄúWe recommend that the Corporation encourage and support research and development leading to the improvement of programming and program production.‚Äù #‚ÄúWe recommend that the Corporation support technical experimentation designed to improve the present television technology.‚Äù #‚ÄúWe recommend that the Corporation undertake to provide means by which technical, artistic, and specialized personnel may be recruited and trained.‚Äù #‚ÄúWe recommend that Congress provide the federal funds required by the Corporation through a manufacturer's excise tax on television sets (beginning at 2 percent and rising to a ceiling of 5 percent). The revenues should be made available to the Corporation through a trust fund.‚Äù #‚ÄúWe recommend new legislation to enable the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to provide adequate facilities for stations now in existence, to assist in increasing the number of stations to achieve nationwide coverage, to help support the basic operations of all stations, and to enlarge the support of instructional television programming.‚Äù #‚ÄúWe recommend that federal, state, local, and private educational agencies sponsor extensive and innovative studies intended to develop better insights into the use of television in formal and informal education.\\"  Reception  Public Television: A Program for Action sold 50,000 copies in just a few days and received wide attention. The report also led to rapid and drastic actions. President Johnson mentioned public television in his 1967 State of the Union address, and shortly afterwards proposed legislation that was similar to the proposals in the report. In November 1967, the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 became law and created the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB).

The book was written together with Rob Broomby and published by Hodder in 2011.Hodder & Stoughton > News and events. It carries a foreword by Sir Martin Gilbert. The novelist James Long assisted with research and helped to edit and structure the manuscript. However, since its publication, the book has become a subject of considerable controversy. The head historian at Auschwitz, Piotr Setkiewicz, who conducted his own research, which was confirmed by other historians, Auschwitz former prisoners, and Jewish organisations, came to the conclusion that at least some parts of the story seem highly unlikely and probably never happened. Book synopsis Denis Avey relates his wartime service and how he came to be held prisoner in E715A, a camp for Allied Prisoners of War adjacent to Auschwitz. He describes how he exchanged uniforms with a Jewish inmate of Auschwitz III in order to enter this camp to discover more about conditions there, with a view to reporting these to the authorities after the war.\\"The Man Who Broke into Auschwitz: A True Story of World War II\\", Publisher's Weekly, book summary He also relates how he smuggled cigarettes to another Jewish inmate Ernst Lobethal, having obtained these from Lobethal‚Äôs sister in Britain. He was convinced that Ernst had died by early 1945, because he could not have survived the death marches when the camp was evacuated. He also said that after the war the authorities were not interested in his story and he kept silence for more than half a century. Eventually he did begin to disclose his story and it came to the attention of the BBC. Rob Broomby was able to trace Lobethal‚Äôs sister Susanne and her son had a copy of a video recording which her brother before his death had made for the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education in which he describes how a British POW known as 'Ginger' smuggled the cigarettes to him and how these saved his life by enabling him to exchange them for food and to have new soles put on his boots which enabled him to survive the death march. Controversy The World Jewish Congress asked the publisher to have the book verified. Questions have also been raised by British writer, Guy Walters, as to whether Avey actually managed to 'smuggle himself' into Auschwitz. Walters pointed out that some time earlier Charles Coward also claimed to have smuggled himself into Auschwitz III by means of an exchange, and that this was the subject of a book titled The Password is Courage where Coward was billed on the back cover as 'The Man who Broke into Auschwitz'. For the paperback edition of Avey's book the publishers issued 'notes on sources' by Broomby and Long, responding to some of the questions raised, available on the publisher's website. However, Avey's application for the \\"Righteous Among the Nations\\" award was turned down by Yad Vashem because his story could not be substantiated.

Maurice Hurst is considered a forerunner in Australian architecture. Having trained and worked in England, he then returned to practice his skills in both architectural design and drafting. Not only a style innovator and a conservation pioneer, Hurst acted as a staple of Queensland's domestic architecture for more than half a century. Mostly working in the Sunshine Coast and Brisbane regions, Hurst defined and shaped the area stylistically and spiritually for years. Biography Maurice Hurst was born 20 September 1929 in Hastings, England, the son of a publican . Hurst trained at the Brixton and Hammersmith School of Building and Architecture from 1946 where he met friend Bernard Joyce. First developing skills in drafting and architectural annotation, it was during this period that it is believed Hurst developed his trademark sketching style and visualization techniques. After receiving his Masters from the College of Art and Architecture in 1952, he worked with Joseph Emberton in 1953. Hurst was employed with various commercial architectural firms and practices in London. He completed his British military service from 1953-1955, being posted to Egypt where he worked on the Suez Canal with the Royal Engineers. After he completed his military service he worked with some urban planning offices. At the recommendation of his friend Bernard Joyce who was now living in Australia, Maurice Hurst emigrated to Australia in 1958 where he found employment with the architectural firm of Lund Hutton Newell and Paulsen in Brisbane. He settled in Queensland. During this time he was part of design teams who worked on major projects such as the Church of England in Thargomindah (1959) and the new town hall of Gumdale (1960). At Thargomindah, Hurst's team were at the forefront of adaptation of religious architecture using established conventions while acclimatizing to Queensland's tropical conditions. Equally, at Gumdale Maurice Hurst endeavoured to provide a new space for civil function yet still conserving stylistic trends of old. Many of Hurst's domestic clients during the period 1959-1966 elected to build low set houses with concrete slabs and a minimum of stairs rising to the front and rear. He attributed this to a swing away from the traditional Queenslander style of architecture and the desire to make outdoor living spaces relate to the rest of the home. Hurst also lectured part time in architecture at the University of Queensland, providing design assessment for students in their 4th and 5th year of study. He took a Bachelor of Architecture from the University of Queensland in 1968, with the thesis The role of the Australian professional consultant in the developing countries of South East Asia. Yet it was during the late 60's and 70's that Maurice Hurst made his greatest impact on the architectural community, specifically in the outer suburbs of Brisbane. Domestic Architecture comprised a fair proportion of Hurst's work with such notable works like the Roe and Frost houses. This period also holds special significance in Hurst's career as it is commonly associated with the genesis of the Noosa style when he commenced work in the area from 1976. Hurst went into partnership with architect Neil Harris in 1980. They collaborated on a number of homes, schools, libraries and churches on the Sunshine Coast. As a member of the Noosa Surf Lifesaving Association, he also designed the iconic lifeguard tower at the beach at Noosa. Due to Hurst's declining health, the partnership with Harris ceased in 1993 and Hurst soon retired. In 1996 Hurst was awarded the Architect of the Year by the Board of Architects of Queensland and the State Government of Queensland. In January 2004, Hurst was recognized for his illustrious career receiving Australia Day Honours in the field of Architecture and Social Contribution. At the event Royal Australian Institute of Architect's (RAIA) National President David Parken reflected on Maurice Hurst's career, stating: \\"Maurice Hurst was best remembered for pioneering conservation architecture before the term was coined. He produced a new benchmark for sensitive low-scale development in Queensland's coastal resort towns and was a central force in developing an architectural genre, the Noosa style.\\"  Legacy  After a long and industrious career, particularly in Queensland, Maurice Hurst died 13 November 2003. He did not marry and was survived by his sister's family . In 2004, Hurst was honoured at the exhibition Cool: The 60s Brisbane House,http://www.architecturemedia.com/aa/aaissue.php?issueid=200411&article;=3&typeon;=1 a collection of drawing and models from prominent Queensland Architects of the era. Hurst's papers are held in the University of Queensland, Fryer Library, including many architectural plans.

She is the youngest daughter of billionaire philanthropist and former Seagram liquor chairman Edgar Bronfman Sr. After a brief equestrian career, Bronfman began involvement in NXIVM, a business engaged in criminal activities during 1998-2018, which led to indictments on federal charges, including sex trafficking. In April 2019, Bronfman pleaded guilty to conspiracy to conceal and harbor illegal aliens for financial gain, and to fraudulent use of identification. The prosecution requested a sentence of 5 years in prison. In September 2020, she was sentenced to six years and nine months in prison by a federal judge. Background Bronfman is a daughter of Canadian billionaire Edgar Bronfman, Sr. and Rita Webb, the daughter of an English pub owner from Essex, England. Bronfman's parents met in Marbella, Spain. The couple married in 1975, two years after Edgar Bronfman's divorce from his first wife. Webb gave birth to Sara the following year, and had Clare two-and-a-half years later. Shortly after Clare's birth, Webb (who had renamed herself Georgiana) asked Edgar for a divorce. They remarried in 1983, but again divorced. After their parents' second divorce, the girls visited their father at his estates outside Charlottesville, Virginia, and in Westchester County; his home in Sun Valley; and his apartment on Fifth Avenue. However, they resided in England and in Kenya with their mother. Bronfman is of Jewish ancestry on her father's side. Equestrian career In December 1999, Bronfman competed in the Millstreet Indoor International Horse Show. In May 2001, Bronfman won the Grand Prix at CSI-A Eindhoven (NED). On September 23, 2001, Bronfman's team placed seventh in the World Final of the Samsung Nations Cup Series (Jumping). On May 26, 2002, Bronfman won the Grand Prix in Rome (ITA); Her team placed sixth in the competition. In October 2002, Bronfman placed 13th at the CSI-A competition in Bremen. NXIVM involvement and criminal prosecution Nxivm Indictment Through her sister Sara, Clare Bronfman became involved in NXIVM's personal advancement program and \\"Executive Success Program\\" (\\"ESP\\") workshops. The sisters became committed followers and financial backers of NXIVM founder Keith Raniere, relocating to upstate New York to work as NXIVM trainers. Clare Bronfman also served as event coordinator for \\"Vanguard Week,\\" an annual festival celebrating Raniere's birthday, stating that \\"the purpose of 'V Week' is to get the chance to experience a civilized world... [and] craft for ourselves a more fulfilling, purposeful life.\\" Conflict with father Clare and her sister introduced their father, billionaire Edgar Bronfman, Sr., to NXIVM. Edgar broke with the group after learning that Clare had given Raniere and Salzman a $2 million \\"loan\\" at 2.5% interest. In October 2003, Forbes magazine featured Raniere on its cover along with the title \\"The World's Strangest Executive Coach\\". The article quoted Edgar Bronfman, Sr. as stating that he thought NXIVM was \\"a cult\\". Clare Bronfman eventually became \\"NXIVM's operations director and one of its largest financial contributors\\". Raniere reportedly blamed Clare Bronfman for the bad publicity, faulting her for telling her father about the $2 million loan. Ultimately, Clare Bronfman would spend $150 million on NXIVM. Clare Bronfman installed keylogger software on her father's computer, allowing NXIVM members to access his email for years thereafter. From 2007-2009, Clare Bronfman, allegedly at the direction of Raniere, employed private firms to investigate perceived enemies of the group, including six federal judges. Collaboration with the Dalai Lama the 14th Dalai Lama, appeared onstage and presented Raniere with a white scarf. Eager to distance themselves from cult allegations in the press, NXIVM members sought the endorsement of the Dalai Lama, spending $2 million on the project. Clare, along with her sister Sara, and NXIVM founder Keith Raniere formed an organization called the World Ethical Foundations Consortium. Clare and Sara were credited with being able to bring the Dalai Lama to Albany to participate in the WEFC's inaugural event on May 6, 2009. On May 6, 2009, the Dalai Lama traveled to Albany to give a talk; during the event, he presented Raniere with a white scarf onstage. The Dalai Lama additionally wrote the foreword to the book The Sphinx and Thelxiepeia, which Raniere co-authored in 2009. Eight years later, it would be revealed Clare's sister Sara had a 2009 sexual relationship with Lama Tenzin Dhonden, the Dalai Lama's gatekeeper who arranged the appearance, who as a monk had taken a vow of celibacy. Amid accusations of corruption, Dhonden was replaced. Media investigations In June 2017, NXIVM leader Sarah Edmondson revealed the existence of a \\"secret sisterhood\\" within NXIVM, in which female members were allegedly referred to as \\"slaves,\\" branded with the initials of Raniere and Allison Mack, subjected to corporal punishment from their \\"masters\\", and required to provide nude photos or other potentially damaging information about themselves as \\"collateral\\".A&E; Cults and Extreme Belief S1E1, aired May 28, 2018, last accessed May 30, 2018, https://www.aetv.com/shows/cults-and-extreme- belief/season-1/episode-1. In July and September 2017, Clare Bronfman was contacted by multiple women who were part of DOS, demanding return or destruction of their collateral, but she failed to respond.https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nyed.420062/gov.uscourts.nyed.420062.922.0.pdf In July 2017, she contacted the New York City Police Department and the Vancouver Police Department, attempting to have criminal charges filed against DOS whistleblower Sarah Edmondson. In September, she and Raniere drafted letters which were ultimately sent by attorneys in Mexico to DOS whistleblowers, threatening them with criminal prosecution. Arrest and guilty plea In 2018, Raniere and associate Allison Mack were arrested and indicted on several federal charges involving a cult alleged to operate within NXIVM; the charges included sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy, and conspiracy to commit forced labor. Bronfman was arrested by federal agents on July 24, 2018 in New York City and charged with money laundering and identity theft in connection with NXIVM activities. She pleaded not guilty in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn. She was released on $100 million bond and placed on house arrest with electronic monitoring. Also charged were Bronfman's long-time mentor and NXIVM president Nancy Salzman; Salzman's daughter, NXIVM executive board member Lauren Salzman; and former NXIVM bookkeeper Kathy Russell. On April 19, 2019, Bronfman pleaded guilty to conspiracy to conceal and harbor illegal aliens for financial gain and fraudulent use of identification. She faces 5 years in prison and has agreed to forfeit $6 million. On September 30, 2020, she was sentenced to six years, nine months in prison by a federal judge.

It is located at the intersection of County Road Y42E and 317th Street, in the northwest corner of Scott County, northwest of Dixon and south of Wheatland. History Big Rock was founded by Peter Goddard in 1855, named after a large rock in the area.Savage, Tom (2007). A Dictionary of Iowa Place-Names, p. 39. University Of Iowa Press. . For 113 years, one of the town's main businesses was Horstmann's General Store, a general store where area residents could purchase groceries, supplies and miscellaneous items. The store was notable for letting locals put items on a \\"tab\\", allowing community members to get grocery items without immediate pay as long as it was repaid in the future. Horstmann's was a victim of theft multiple times toward the end of its tenure, mostly having cigarettes stolen. The store closed in 2010 after its owner died. The town at one time also had a railroad station, a lumber yard, a dance hall, and a tavern, all of which also have since closed. It is home to a local cemetery, with dates of death going back to the mid-1880s and earlier. The city used to be a shipping port for timber and wood, as well as distributed ice throughout the area via a small waterfall that was accessed in a wooded area away from the main highway that now runs through the middle of the town. This ice was brought across from the wooded area and then slid down a large hill to deliver to the town and the rail yard for distribution. Big Rock was also home to two churches, one of which was torn down in the early 2000s. The city is the hometown of B.R.A., otherwise known as Big Rock Army, a semi- professional motor sports club run by a local family. The town still from time to time will get together for \\"Big Rock days\\", a celebration of the local community in front of the large rock in which the town is named after.Rathjen, Brian, The North Scott Press, January 27, 2010.

Life and early work Martha Altman, later Martha Shelley, was born on December 27, 1943, in Brooklyn, New York, to parents of Russian-Polish Jewish descent. In 1960, she attended her first women's judo classes in New York City, trying to meet lesbian women. Two years later, at age 19, Shelley moved out of her parents' home to a hotel and went to lesbian bars, where she \\"was miserable.\\" Shelley did not find herself fitting in to the roles of \\"butch\\" or \\"femme\\", common lesbian gender roles during this period. During this period, Shelley was exposed to Betty Friedan's famous work, The Feminine Mystique, a text which inspired many feminists. She was also involved in a group based on the work of Harry Stack Sullivan which led to her first Anti-Vietnam War movement protest. In 1965 she graduated from City College. In November 1967 she went to her first meeting of the New York City chapter of the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB), of which she later became president, despite her feelings of resistance to events like the \\"Annual Reminder\\" held by the organization. Because of FBI surveillance, members of the DOB were encouraged to take aliases, and Altman took Shelley as a surname. While working as a secretary in the office of fundraising for Barnard College, she joined the Student Homophile League and worked with bisexual activist Stephen Donaldson, who she was also dating at the time. Shelley has described the affair as causing a scandal, stating \\"We used to walk into these meetings arm in arm...because the two of us were so blatant and out there in public being pro gay, they certainly couldn't afford to throw us out.\\" In approximately 1969, the first major essay of Shelley's appears in the newsletter Liberation News Service: \\"Stepin' Fetchit Woman\\".Liberation News Service. (1969). Liberation news service. New York, N.Y.?]: [Liberation News Service?]. Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Cambridge, Mass. This same essay later appeared in other publications with alternate titles including \\"Women of Lesbos\\" and \\"Notes of a Radical Lesbian\\". Shelley states that she did not choose the title under which it first appeared.Shelley, Martha. Phone interview by Dani English. 31 October 2019. Gay Liberation Front While in a leadership role with the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB), Shelley sometimes provided tours to women who were in New York City to learn about how to make their own chapter of the organization. While giving one of these tours to women from Boston the night of the Stonewall riots, Shelley and her visitors walked past the beginnings of the riots outside of the Stonewall Inn. Shelley dismissed them as anti-war protests initially, but was later informed about the actual cause. Recognizing the significance of the event and being politically aware, Shelley proposed a protest march and, as a result, DOB and Mattachine sponsored a demonstration. With time, it became clear to those involved that Shelley and others desired a new organization to better serve their political goals; she was one of the twenty or so women and men who formed the Gay Liberation Front after Stonewall and was outspoken in many of their confrontations. Over time, the Gay Liberation Front's name was used in similar organizations but without any inherent direct connection to Shelley or other organizers in New York City at this time. Shelley also wrote for Come Out!, the New York City Gay Liberation Front's newsletter, and helped get the issues printed.Shelley, Martha. Interview by Susan Brownmiller. February 2, 1997. MC 523 - 29.6. Papers of Susan Brownmiller, 1935-2000, Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University. The newsletter published essays, reports, art, and poetry of submitters and members of the organization. It ran, however inconsistently, for three years. Shelley‚Äôs work appears in all eight issues of the newsletter, with a variety of genres, including essays on the movements she was participating in, reports on the Gay Liberation Front in other cities and related organizations in New York City, and some of her poetry. Many of her essays, including ‚ÄúMore Radical Than Thou‚Äù and ‚ÄúSubversion in the Women‚Äôs Movement - What is to be Done?‚Äù involve critiquing the competitive and cutthroat nature of the women‚Äôs movement, gay liberation movement, and other adjacent movements. Come Out! is one of the places in which Shelley was first published, providing insight into her developing political ideology as well as the events around her. The Gay Liberation Front allied itself with other movements going on at the time, including black liberation and women's liberation. For some, this unity was not desirable, and the Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) formed as a splinter group from GLF, and sought to focus more exclusively on gay rights. In addition to GAA, members of GLF also formed subgroups -- cells -- with different goals and purposes. One of the groups that formed primarily out of GLF women was Lavender Menace, named after the comment made by Betty Friedan (then president of NOW) regarding lesbians as a \\"lavender menace\\" in the feminist movement. Lavender Menace was later renamed Radicalesbians. Feminism In 1970, Lavender Menace, later Radicalesbians, organized the Lavender Menace zap of the Second Congress to Unite Women. Shelley played an instrumental role in the zap itself, and some have claimed she assisted in the writing of the Radicalesbians manifesto, \\"The Woman- Identified Woman\\", which introduced \\"women-identified\\" and \\"male-identified\\" terminology to the lesbian feminist discourse community. Later that same year, Shelley wrote \\"Subversion in the Women's Movement\\", which was published in both Come Out! and in off our backs, a feminist publication. Beginning in 1972, Shelley produced the radio show Lesbian Nation on New York's WBAI radio station. The Library of Congress claims Lesbian Nation to be, most likely, the first lesbian radio show. She contributed the pieces \\"Notes of a Radical Lesbian\\" and \\"Terror\\" to the 1970 anthology Sisterhood is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings From The Women's Liberation Movement, edited by Robin Morgan. After moving to Oakland, California in October 1974, she was involved with the Women's Press Collective where she worked with Judy Grahn to produce Crossing the DMZ, In Other Words, Lesbians Speak Out and other books. Her poetry has appeared in Ms. magazine, Sunbury, The Bright Medusa, We Become New and other periodicals. Shelley appeared in the 2010 documentary Stonewall Uprising, an episode of the American Experience series. Activism and political views Despite being involved with lesbian feminism, Shelley does not describe herself as a lesbian separatist from the gay rights movement. Though she liked the idea of lesbian-only spaces, she has said that the splitting of gay liberation into splinter groups weakened the movement as a whole. She also was allied to many other left-wing causes of the 1960s and 1970s, such as the pro-choice movement, and civil rights groups such as the Black Panthers and Young Lords, and has described herself as a socialist. Shelley was also a strong critic of the prevailing psychiatric views of homosexuality in the 1960s and argued that the stigmatization of homosexuality as a mental illness was a major contributing factor to psychological issues within the gay and lesbian community.

Peiris: his crusade and has been an executive Director of the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine. Education and training Educated at Royal College Colombo, he studied medicine Colombo Medical College and gained his MD from the University of Colombo and a Membership of the Royal College of Physicians (MRCP). He trained at the Institute of Neurology, Queen Square, as a Nuffield Research Fellow London working with Lord Roger Bannister and Dr Ross Russell. Contributions to the field of neurology Peiris was appointed consultant neurologist at National Hospital Sri Lanka at the age of 33 and served as the country's sole neurologist for 10 years. During that period he pioneered the expansion of the subject of neurology in Sri Lanka and the establishment of the Institute of Neurology at National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL), constructed entirely from public donations.Birth of the Institute of Neurology and Iconic Existence of Neurology in Sri Lanka The Neurology Unit in the 1970s had beds scattered in four different medical wards in the National Hospital and Peiris had to share the male ward with a physician, the female ward with the cardiologist, dermatologist and three other physicians. The result was that there was cadre provision for one neurologist, with no possibility for the expansion. Peiris refurbished and equipped the former staff tea room into the first neurology intensive care unit.Birth of the Institute of Neurology and Iconic Existence of Neurology in Sri Lanka As Sri Lanka‚Äôs only neurologist, Peiris established Sri Lanka‚Äôs first Institute of Neurology at NHSL, within three years. In 1984, a four-floor institute dedicated to this specialty was opened, with an intensive care unit, a medical and paediatric ward, a surgical ward, an operating theatre, a private wing, physiotherapy, lecture halls, and pharmacy. Worldwide only a few neurology institutes exist with all these facilities under one roof. In the subsequent years many postgraduates opted for neurology as a specialty after the Institute of Neurology came into existence. There are now over 40 neurologists on the island, with subspecialties in Paediatrics and Neurophysiology. The institute provided the platform and the enabling environment for the growth of neurology as a specialty in Sri Lanka.The inaugural Dr J B Peiris oration, Iconic Existence of Neurology in Sri Lanka Peiris was responsible for many of the donations for the construction of the Institute of Neurology and also collaborated with the technical committee headed by Navin Gooneratne of Design Consortium and Mohan Coomaraswamy of Project Management services on a weekly basis for three years. The public funds collected for the construction was managed and distributed by the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress (ACBC), with the donation for the ground floor coming from Mrs Milina Sumathipala. The hospital welfare service, which is a branch of the ACBC (at the time headed by Ven Vipassi Thero) played a supportive role. The Institute of Neurology was ceremonially opened on 8 April 1984 with the then Prime Minister, the Hon. Ranasinghe Premadasa, as the chief guest.Birth of the Institute of Neurology and Iconic Existence of Neurology in Sri Lanka As a researcher Peiris‚Äôs contribution to neurology had a global impact. He has written research papers describing four new clinical entities. He also pioneered three new treatment modalities which have been adopted worldwide.

Its initial aim was to provide an alternative source of information and an alternative approach to questions often slighted or ignored by broadcast TV. Topics included video verit√© of the cable franchising process, home satellite TV, and third world views on communications control.McGowan, MaryAnne. (January 1983). \\"Cable Review Lounge\\". The Kitchen press release As the number of artist producers expanded, so did the style and subject matter of the shows, which ranged from political documentary to satire. Communications Update subsequently focused on works which explored the relationship between documentary and drama, not conforming to either but drawing from both. In 1983, the series was renamed Cast Iron TV to reflect its changing orientation as a forum for experimental video makers. Programs in the series included artists' segments commissioned or made specifically for the show, as well as previously existing video works. Milli Iatrou coordinated the series for two years from 1984 to 1986. Terese Svoboda followed her, continuing the series for four years until 1990 when Betsy Newman took over for two years until 1992. Communications Update / Cast Iron TV was eventually considered to fall under the rubric of \\"alternative television\\" or \\"artists' television.\\"  History  In September 1979, Liza Bear, cofounder of Avalanche magazine and of Send/Receive Satellite Network, initiated a 10-week series entitled the \\"WARC Report\\" on the World Administrative Radio Conference then taking place in Geneva. Co-producers were Michael McClard and Willoughby Sharp in New York, and Rolf Brand in Geneva. A slow-scan link for relaying images on phone lines was set up between Geneva and New York. The impetus for producing the series, according to Bear, was the fact that \\"the TV media was not covering communications issues and we felt that it had to be done.\\" When WARC ended, still concerned with public telecommunications policies and the uses of the new technology, the program was renamed Communications Update; it continued to run in the same 7:30 pm, post-news time slot. After its initial season, Communications Update began to shift its emphasis. Bear explains, \\"I didn't want to go on just becoming a lexicon or dictionary of new technology or new political policy problems.\\" While retaining its documentary mode, Communications Update began to develop as an outlet for programs made by individuals attempting to gain an \\"active role in the making of information as artists and citizens.\\" By 1982, the programs in the series had a broad range of styles and concerns from documentary to abstract fiction. A lot of the shows attempted to expose the manipulation carried out by television. For example, \\"The Very Reverend Deacon b. Peachy,\\" by Ron Morgan and Milli Iatrou, was about a tele-evangelist newly arrived in New York who finds his moral intentions subverted by the economic imperatives of the medium and its technology. Several of the productions that originated on Communications Update / Cast Iron TV have been shown in video festivals in Bonn, Bologna and The Hague, as well as The Museum of Modern Art, The American Museum of the Moving Image, The Kitchen and the Whitney Museum of American Art.

Together the pair competed in three Olympics, winning gold at the 1996 Summer Games, and took two golds at the 1998 World Equestrian Games. He was the first eventing horse to win individual gold at both an Olympic Games and a World Equestrian Games. Ready Teddy died from colic in 2011. Early life Ready Teddy was a chestnut Thoroughbred gelding foaled in 1987, sired by Brilliant Invader. As a young horse he was named Striking Back and competed in Thoroughbred racing. Blyth Tait's father found him at a Pony Club event and had him shipped to England in 1994, as an eventing prospect for his son. Competitive career At the 1996 Atlanta Games, Ready Teddy and Tait competed at their first Olympics together (it was Tait's second Games overall). They competed only in the individual event at these games, and took gold, while Tait rode a different horse in the team event. In Sydney in 2000, they competed only in the team event, with the New Zealand team taking 8th overall, while Tait again rode a different horse in the individual event. At the 2004 Athens Olympics, Tait for the first time rode Ready Teddy in both the individual and team events, but wound up only taking 18th individually and 5th with the New Zealand team. The pair also competed in the World Equestrian Games in 1998, winning both individual and team gold. This event marked the first (and so far only) time that an event horse has won gold medals in individual competition at both the Olympic and World Equestrian Games. The pair competed in both the individual and team competitions at the 2002 World Equestrian Games in Jerez, but failed to complete the event. He also won at the Burghley Horse Trials in 2001. Later life and legacy Ready Teddy and Tait retired together from international competition at the Manukau Three Day Event in Puhinui, New Zealand in 2004. Ready Teddy died on 23 April 2011 of complications from colic. He is buried at Tait's property at Karaka, near Auckland.

She was the first registered female doctor in New Zealand. Early life and family Cruickshank was born a twin on New Year's Day 1873 in Palmerston, a small town in the South Island of New Zealand. Her twin was also a girl, Christina. Their parents were Elizabeth (born Taggart) and George, who had emigrated together from Scotland; first to Australia and then to Dunstan in Central Otago, to join the gold rush there. Cruickshank's mother died while the twins were young and as a result they were needed at home to help raise their five younger siblings. They took turns to attend school; the one who attended teaching the one who had stayed home. In this way they completed their studies at Palmerston District High School and then went on together to Otago Girls' High School in Dunedin. Both girls were duxes in 1891. Medical career Cruickshank attended the University of Otago Dunedin School of Medicine and was the second woman, following Emily Siedeberg, in New Zealand to complete medical school, graduating in 1897. She went into general practice (the first woman in New Zealand to do so) in Waimate. In 1913 Cruickshank completed postgraduate studies in Edinburgh and Dublin, travelling also to Europe and America. To show their esteem, the people of Waimate presented her with a gold watch, chain and a purse of 100 gold sovereigns, at a public function before she left. The Waimate Museum displays this gold pocket watch. The inscription inside the watch case reads: \\"Presented to Margaret B Cruickshank, from her many Waimate Friends Feby. 13th 1913.\\" During World War I she organised the work of the Waimate Red Cross Fund, and took over the case load of her partner, Dr Barclay, who had enlisted and gone overseas. She was also one of three doctors who shared his role of hospital superintendent in his absence. When the 1918 flu pandemic broke out, Cruickshank worked night and day, caring for the children of ill parents, cooking meals for them and even milking the cow of a family whose adults were too ill to do so themselves. Eventually she fell ill herself and died on 28 November 1918. Legacy Cruickshank memorial in 2009 In 1923 a memorial statue was unveiled at a memorial service at Seddon Square in Waimate. The speakers at the ceremony included Cruickshank's former classmate Dr Emily Siedeberg, representing the New Zealand Medical Women's Association, the Member of Parliament for Waitaki, John Bitchener, and the chair of the local council, Mr. Hart. Miss M. Allen was also present, as a representative of the Otago University Women's Association. The unveiling was performed by Cruickshank's landlady of 23 years, Mrs Barclay. The statue was carved by New Zealand sculptor William Trethewey. It was the first monument erected to a woman other than Queen Victoria in New Zealand and its inscription reads \\"The Beloved Physician ‚Äì Faithful Unto Death\\". In 1948 the maternity ward in Waimate Hospital was named after her. The Waimate Museum & Archives holds a collection of objects, letters, photos and artwork pertaining to Dr Cruickshank.

This property was later purchased by the state government in 1901 and sub-divided into blocks called Gwambygine Estate.

Nicknamed \\"Dogtown\\" because of its proximity to the historic Ann Street Animal Shelter whose canine residents could be heard for blocks around, it is operated by the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles. History The site was funded with the federal Housing Act of 1937. The proposal to build the site was rejected in December 1940 because of high land purchase costs (averaging $23,900 per acre, when other developments were as low as $2400). was owned by the Consolidated Steel Corporation. The remaining property was on land bequeathed by William Mead, an early Los Angeles politician. The land price was reduced to $20,000 an acre by January 1941, but didn't proceed until a federally-backed United States Housing Authority loan signed by Franklin D. Roosevelt was given on March 12, 1941. It was built in 1941-1942 and contains 449 units in 24 buildings, replacing approximately 100 substandard dwellings on the site. It occupies and was constructed by the Herbert M. Baruch Corporation for $1.2 million. David Gebhard and Robert Winter state the details \\"slightly suggest the late 1930s Moderne.\\" William Mead Homes Residency in the project was limited to low- income American citizens who had lived in Los Angeles for at least a year. It was also part of a \\"Negro quota\\" system, which mandated a maximum of 7 percent black occupancy. This changed to 15% in January 1943, and was completely removed in July 1943 after pressure and protests by the National Urban League, California Eagle, Los Angeles Sentinel, NAACP, and the CIO union. The development was opened for war workers in March 1943. Part of the project was built on an oil refinery and a hazardous waste dump. In 1994, cancer-causing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were found at levels 19 times the safe level following testing by the California Department of Toxic Substances Control. Playgrounds and gardening spaces were closed, and a $1.5 million soil removal and cleanup project was required in 2000. The refinery was operated by Amalgamated Oil Company, which was later purchased by Texaco. The waste dump was operated by Witco Corporation, now part of the Chemtura Corporation. At the time, the project was home to 1400 residents, many Latino and Vietnamese. The Housing Authority sued ChevronTexaco for the cleanup costs in April 2003. Demographics In 1992, the population was 71 percent Latino, 22 percent Asian, 4 percent African-American and 1 percent Caucasian, with a median monthly family income of $840. Several innovative welfare-to-work programs occurred, such as the Jobs-Plus program, which was at William Mead and Imperial Courts from 1996 to 2002. Los Angeles Infirmary In 1856 the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul founded the city's first orphanage, Instituci√≥n Caratitiva, in the former residence of a former mayor, Benjamin Davis Wilson. The order then opened the Los Angeles Infirmary in 1858. In 1870 they moved the infirmary to a new structure built in what became Dogtown at Naud and Ann Street (named after the orphanage's supervisor, Sister Ann Gillen). Rail arrived a few years later and suddenly the location seemed less than ideal for an infirmary and the decision was made to relocate. Between 1883 and '86 they sold lots of the New Depot Tract and Infirmary Tract to raise money for a new home. In 1891, the sisters moved their operations to Boyle Heights Geography William Mead Homes is located within the Chinatown neighborhood of Los Angeles.

Bazarov is best remembered as a pioneer in the development of economic planning in the Soviet Union. He was one of the Russian Machists, as Lenin dubbed the term, and was a close friend to Alexander Bogdanov. Biography=Early years Vladimir Alexandrovich Rudnev was born August 8, 1874 (N.S.) in Tula, Russian Empire. The son of a doctor, A. M. Rudnev, he enrolled in the Tula classical gimnaziia (high school) in 1884, and graduated in the spring of 1892. In the autumn of 1892, Rudnev enrolled in the faculty of natural sciences of Moscow University.Naum Jasny, Soviet Economists of the Twenties: Names to Be Remembered. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1972; pg. 124. He became involved in revolutionary politics in 1896, activity which would lead to his expulsion from Moscow the following year. He also adopted the surname \\"Bazarov\\" as an underground revolutionary pseudonym taking it from the Comtean positivist character in Turgenev's Fathers and Sons. Thereafter, Bazarov returned home to Tula where, together with Alexander Bogdanov and Ivan Skvortsov-Stepanov, Bazarov organized a secret school for Tula workers. Bogdanov resided at the house of Bazarov's father and met his wife who worked for Alexander Rudenev. A guiding principle of this group was that the workers' movement should be led by workers themselves, assisted by educated members of the radical intelligentsia.Robert C. Williams, The Other Bolsheviks: Lenin and His Critics, 1904-1914. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1986; pg. 35. In exile Bazarov was expelled from Tula in 1899 and emigrated to Germany, settling in Berlin. In the fall of 1900, Bazarov was instrumental in establishing a political organization called the \\"Neutral Group of Social- Democrats in Berlin.\\" This organization dedicated itself to helping heal the split between the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad, publishers of Rabochee Delo (The Workers' Cause), and the Emancipation of Labor Group, publishers of Iskra (The Spark). According to Bazarov, the Berlin group sent representatives to Geneva in an attempt to broker a reconciliation between these two groups of Marxist revolutionaries.Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the Central Committee of the CPSU, \\"The Neutral Group of Social Democrats in Berlin,\\" in Lenin, Collected Works: Volume 36: 1900-1923.

Moscow: Izdatel'stvo Politicheskoi Literatury, 1964; pg. 489, fn. 109. Bazarov's Berlin group issued three or four political proclamations before disbanding in the summer of 1901. Return to Russia Cover of the first edition of Lenin's Materialism and Empirio-Criticism: Critical Notes about One Reactionary Philosophy, published in 1909 against Alexander Bogdanov, Nikolai Valentinov, Vladimir Bazarov, and their co-thinkers. In the fall of 1901, Bazarov returned to Russia to serve as a member of the Moscow Social Democratic Committee. He was soon again arrested for his political activity, however, this time to be exiled for three years to Siberia. In 1904, Bazarov joined the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP), an organization headed by V.I. Lenin. He returned to St Petersburg when his term of exile was over, and was a member of the Bolsheviks' Petersburg committee. In 1905-07, Bazarov wrote extensively for the Bolshevik party press, serving on the editorial board of the grouping's primary newspaper, Rabochii put' (The Workers' Path), and sitting as a member of the party's underground leadership in the country, the so-called \\"Bolshevik Center.\\" Also in this period Bazarov joined with his old Tula comrades Ivan Skvortsov-Stepanov and Alexander Bogdanov in retranslating and publishing a new Russian-language edition of the three volumes of Capital by Karl Marx.Jasny, Soviet Economists of the Twenties, pg. 125. This edition of the book gained recognition as the basic Russian translation and was reissued for decades in the Soviet Union, although for political reasons any mention of the participation of Bazarov and Bogdanov in the translation was later avoided. Bazarov also became interested in philosophy during the first decade of the 20th Century, coming to reject Marx's formulaic dialectical materialism in favor of the use of the scientific method to observe and theorize about human behavior, as espoused by the Austrian Ernst Mach and the German-Swiss philosopher Richard Avenarius. The Bolshevik supporters of the \\"empirical-criticism\\" of Mach and Avenarius, including Bazarov, Bogdanov, and Nikolai Valentinov, were soon the target of a bitter polemic by Lenin published in 1909, Materialism and Empirio-criticism. This dispute created a rift with Lenin. In May 1908, Bazarov and Bogdanov were in Capri, as guests of the writer Maxim Gorky, who prevailed upon Lenin to join them, in the hope of brokering a reconciliation. The attempt failed. Lenin told them: \\"We will simply have to separate for two or three years.\\" Bazarov continued to be an active Marxist, without being a member of either of the rival factions, the Bolsheviks or Mensheviks. In 1911, Bazarov was arrested once again and was deported once more, this time a three-year sentence to Astrakhan. In November 1912, Bazarov joined with Bogdanov, Anatoly Lunacharsky, Gorky, and Lenin, writing for a new paper in St. Petersburg called Pravda.Williams, The Other Bolsheviks, pg. 170. First World War During the years of World War I, Bazarov wrote for various radical publications, including Gorky's radical daily, Novaia zhizn' (New Life).Jasny, Soviet Economists of the Twenties, pp. 124-125. After the 1917 revolution Following the October Revolution of 1917, Bazarov moved to Kharkov in the Ukraine, where he wrote for various Menshevik publications. In 1919 he published Na puti k sotsializmu (Khar'kov, 1919), for which he was attacked by Bukharin, who viewed him and Bogdanov as being part of a combined opposition espousing a theory of a \\"bureaucratic degeneration (the technico- intellectual bureaucracy, the 'organizing' caste)\\". In 1922, Bazarov joined the staff of the State Planning Commission, where he met Vladimir Groman, with whom he would work intimately for the next half decade. Bazarov and Groman worked together developing the basics of Soviet industrial planning, setting the foundation stones for the next half century of the Soviet economy. On November 21, 1923, Groman presented the Presidium of Gosplan with a paper entitled \\"Problems of Planning the National Economy as a Whole,\\" in which Bazarov argued that the adoption of the mixed economy of the New Economic Policy actually accentuated rather than lessened the need for central economic planning.Jasny, Soviet Economists of the Twenties, pp. 125-126. Together with Groman, Bazarov was influential in developing the idea that a diminishing rate of growth was an earmark of economies such as that of the Soviet Union which were in the process of recovery.Jasny, Soviet Economists of the Twenties, pg. 127. Although in retrospect the observation seems obvious, the \\"theory of the leveling-off curve\\" espoused by Groman and Bazarov postulated that an economy with substantial reserves of idle capacity would initially show an inordinately rapid pace of growth as productive capital returned to use, with this rate tapering off as available plant approached full capacity.Alexander Erlich, The Soviet Industrialization Debate, 1924-1928. [1960] Second Edition. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1967; pg. 60. In 1924 Bazarov published a pamphlet entitled Towards a Methodology for Strategic Planning in which he further expanded his ideas on the development of central planning procedures as the Soviet economy moved from recovery to expansion.Jasny, Soviet Economists of the Twenties, pg. 126. Bazarov remained convinced that central direction of economic investment would provide the impetus for accelerated economic growth, speaking in 1926 of the \\"hope to overtake and surpass in our development the advanced countries of the capitalist world.\\"Jasny, Soviet Economists of the Twenties, pg. 128. Bazarov was a staunch advocate of using material incentives to motivate the peasantry to expand agricultural output, declaring early in 1927 that \\"only by amply supplying the village with good industrial products at very low prices can we create a real impulse toward the development of our backward agriculture...\\"Jasny, Soviet Economists of the Twenties, pg. 130. In the wake of weak agricultural marketing by the peasantry in 1927 and 1928, Soviet political leaders moved another direction, however, returning to the coercive requisitioning methods first used during the earlier period of War Communism before moving to a radical drive for complete collectivization of agriculture at the end of the decade. Bazarov was a voice in the Soviet planning apparatus for a rational rate of growth. In response to a draft Five-Year Plan prepared by the Supreme Council of National Economy (VSNKh) which posited industrial growth of 135% over the five economic years 1927/28 to 1932/33, Bazarov deemed the long-term possibilities \\"fascinating\\" and \\"enchanting.\\"Jasny, Soviet Economists of the Twenties, pg. 133. Such a pace was soon dismissed as inadequate by those holding more extreme views, however, and Bazarov was sharply criticized for pessimism in underestimating \\"the advantages inherent in the Soviet system.\\"Jasny, Soviet Economists of the Twenties, pp. 130-131. Ultimately, a growth of 179% over the five-year period was approved by Soviet planning authorities, and Bazarov, Groman, and others holding similar views favoring a less drastic rate of capital accumulation were shunted aside.Jasny, Soviet Economists of the Twenties, pg. 134. 1931 Menshevik Trial Bazarov was arrested by the Soviet secret police during the summer of 1930. At his interrogation of August 15, 1930, he signed a deposition acknowledging his participation in a group with other economists who had been arrested and interrogated by the GPU, including his friend and co-worker Groman and former Socialist Revolutionary Party member Nikolai Kondratiev.\\"Protokol dopros Bazarova Vladimira Aleksandrovicha ot 15-go avgusta 1930 goda\\" (Transcript of the Deposition of Vladimir Alexandrovich Bazarov of August 15, 1920) in A.L. Litvin (ed.), Men'sheviistskiii protsess 1931 goda: Sbornik dokumentov v 2-kh knigakh. Moscow: ROSSPEN, 1999; vol. 1, pp. 46-48. In 1931 the Menshevik Trial was held charging \\"Mensheviks\\" in the state planning apparatus with the \\"wrecking\\" of Soviet industry through the setting of artificially low planning targets. Although Bazarov was not in the dock among the public defendants in this 1931 Menshevik Trial, his associate Groman was. Groman gave public testimony that he and Bazarov headed a counterrevolutionary group in Gosplan, purportedly organized in 1923, which attempted at \\"influencing the economic policy of the Soviet authorities so as to hold the position of 1923-25.\\"Jasny, Soviet Economists of the Twenties, pg. 136, citing the transcript of Groman's trial testimony published in Protsess kontrrevoliutsionnoi organizatsii Men'shevikov (1 marta‚Äî9 marta 1931): Stenogragramma sudebnogo protsessa. Moscow: Sovetskoe Zakonodatel'stvo, 1931; pg. 69. Historian Naum Jasny has speculated that Bazarov's failure to appear as a defendant at this major public trial was likely a reflection of the fact that \\"the GPU did not succeed in breaking him completely enough to make him a desirable member of the trial.\\"Jasny, Soviet Economists of the Twenties, pg. 137. Groman, the star figure among the accused, damned himself and his colleagues with testimony that at Gosplan they had spent their time > \\"Putting into the control figures and into the surveys of current business > planning ideas and deliberately distorted appraisals antagonistic to the > general Party line (lowering the rates of expansion of socialist > construction, distorting the class approach, exaggerating the difficulties), > stressing the signs of an impending catastrophe (Groman) or, what is close > to this, assigning a negligible chance of success to the Party line directed > toward the socialist attack (Bazarov, Gukhman)...\\"Naum Jasny, Soviet > Industrialization, 1928-1952. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1961; > pg. 69, quoting Protsess kontrrevoliutsionnoi organizatsii Men'shevikov, pg. > 37. Although excluded from the public trial which besmirched him, Bazarov was tried in secret and sentenced to a term of prison for his alleged wrecking activities.Jasny, Soviet Economists of the Twenties, pg. 137, citing an article in Pravda of December 24, 1938. A December 1931 letter from the USSR published in the Menshevik journal Sotsialisticheskii vestnik (Socialist Herald) reported that Bazarov was being held at that time in a political \\"isolator\\" at Yaroslavl.Jasny, Soviet Economists of the Twenties, pp. 137-138. Death and legacy Bazarov died September 16, 1939 in Moscow. He was 65 years old at the time of his death. In 1999 a two volume collection of documents relating to the 1931 Menshevik Trial was published in Russia. Included were the text of several handwritten depositions collected from Bazarov during the process of his interrogation during the summer of 1930.See: Litvin (ed.), Men'sheviistskiii protsess 1931 goda, vol. 1, pp. 46-53.

RAJUK Bhaban is situated at RAJUK Avenue, Dilkhusha, Dhaka-1000. This is one of the most well known buildings of the Dhaka city.  History  RAJUK Bhaban was established in 1956 as the head office of Dhaka Improvement Trust (DIT). In that time, RAJUK Bhaban was called as DIT Bhaban. It was designed by architect, Abdulhusein M. Thariani, who was a diploma architect of West Pakistan. Foundation stone was laid on 10 December 1956 by H.E. H. S. Suhrawardy, who was the prime minister of Pakistan in that time. It was renamed as RAJUK Bhaban on April 30, 1987, when RAJUK established by replacing Dhaka Improvement Trust (DIT).  Description and architectural value  Rajuk Bhaban is an important architectural monument of Dhaka city. It is one of the primitive buildings of East Pakistan. It is a very congested building. There were so many black columns in the middle phase of RAJUK bhaban, which created much confusion about the perfect uses of the column in architecture. Architect Thariyani did not think about the climate to design this bhabon. RAJUK Bhaban is mainly a west face Bhaban, which consists of two different buildings named RAJUK, the main building and the RAJUK annex building. These two buildings are connected by a small over bridge. RAJUK main building is a six storied building and RAJUK annex building is an eight storied building. There is a big clock in the top face of the main building, which bears a great significance RAJUK Bhaban.  Renovation  RAJUK Bhaban is an example of the architecture of the Pakistan period. In the early period, RAJUK Bhaban looked like a very simple building but recognizing the historical and architectural importance of RAJUK Bhaban, RAJUK took the initiative to renovate it. The main phase of renovation took place after 2000 and introduced a great architectural look to the building.

Other In his memoir, David Hackworth cites Rogers as an example of Korean War senior officers who received undeserved awards for valor. According to Hackworth, Rogers received the Silver Star for nothing more than spending a short time at a forward command post while serving as assistant division commander of the 40th Infantry Division. Hackworth indicated that his perception of this incident led him to decide that the military's awards process had become devalued, and that senior officers should almost never be recommended for valor medals.About Face, by David H.

It begins near La Mesa Dam as the San Francisco del Monte River, which officially takes the name San Juan River when it meets with Mariblo Creek in Quezon City. As the San Juan River, it passes through Quezon City, San Juan, the Manila district of Santa Mesa and Santa Ana, and Mandaluyong. Right-of-way issues caused the realignment of the Santa Mesa portion of the Skyway Stage 3. Instead of passing through Old Santa Mesa Street, the expressway now follows the course of the San Juan River. Tributaries Aside from the San Francisco del Monte River, the San Juan River has five creeks as its main tributaries (starting from its mouth going upstream): * Buhangin Creek in Mandaluyong is the tributary nearest to the river's confluence with the Pasig. Its mouth is in Barangay Poblaci√≥n, Mandaluyong, near the end of Bonifacio Avenue where it meets New Panaderos Street. Its traceable headwaters are somewhere in Barangay Zu√±iga. * Maytunas Creek in San Juan has its mouth near Sevilla Bridge at the end of Shaw Boulevard, Barangay Daang Bakal. Its traceable headwaters are somewhere near the National Center for Mental Health in Mandaluyong. * Salap√°n Creek (also called Ermita√±o Creek) in San Juan is the third main tributary of the San Juan River. Its mouth is located in Barangay Salap√°n, San Juan near Aurora Boulevard, and crosses Wilson Street near Barasoain Street in San Juan. Its known sources are near Club Filipino and inside the Wack Wack Golf and Country Club, both in San Juan; and in Barangay Bagong Lipunan Crame, Quezon City. *Dilim√°n Creek in Quezon City is the fourth main tributary. It joins the San Juan River in Barangay Kalusugan near E. Rodriguez Avenue behind St Luke's Medical Center. Its traceable headwaters are in Quezon City. The southernmost branch can be traced to Barangay Santolan near Blue Ridge Subdivision, the northernmost in Brgy. Pans√≥l near the UP Integrated School. An intermediate branch springs from within the Ateneo de Manila University campus, while a fourth branch, known as Victoria Creek, passes by the Anonas Avenue area and is notable for defining the boundary of Project 2 and 3, before finally ending in Barangay Duyan Duyan in Project 3. * Mariblo Creek (sometimes called Talayan Creek and Tanque Creek; also spelt Mariablo) in Quezon City is the fifth main tributary. Mariblo Creek joins the San Franc√≠sco River to form the San Juan River in Barangay Mariblo, near Quezon Avenue. Its traceable headwaters are in Barangay Bungad near the corner of West Avenue and EDSA; at the opposite end of West Avenue, near the Welcome Rotonda roundabout where West Avenue meets Quezon and Timog avenues; and in the Ninoy Aquino Parks & Wildlife Center.  As the San Francisco del Monte River  Upstream from the confluence with the Mariblo, the river is known as the San Francisco del Monte River. This river in turn divides upstream into the Dario Creek and the Pasong Tam√≥ River. Culi√°t Creek, whose headwaters are within the UP Diliman campus, empties into the Pasong Tam√≥ River.

She is considered a national heroine of Nicaragua, due to her actions in the defense of the Fortress of the Immaculate Conception during the Battle for the R√≠o San Juan de Nicaragua in 1762 against the British forces. Early life Spanish Admiral Blas de Lezo, known as Patapalo (\\"Pegleg\\") or Mediohombre (\\"Half- man\\"), due to the many wounds he had incurred during his long military career. Despite having only one eye, one leg and one hand, Lezo led the naval forces that defended the city from Admiral Edward Vernon during the Battle of Cartagena de Indias in 1741. Rafaela Herrera was born on August 6, 1742 in Cartagena de Indias, in the Viceroyalty of New Granada of the Spanish Empire. She was the illegitimate and only child of Lieutenant Colonel Don Jos√© de Herrera y Sotomayor (died 1762) and Felipa Torreynosa. Herrera's birth mother was Felipa Torreynosa, who was reported to be a criolla or possibly a mulatto woman. She was raised in Cartagena by another woman‚ÄîDo√±a Maria Felipe de Uriarte‚Äîwho was widely considered to be her de facto mother. Herrera's father was a captain of artillery who had been engaged in heavy combat against British forces under the command of Vice Admiral Edward Vernon during the Battle of Cartagena de Indias in 1741. At the time of her birth the following year, he was Commander of the Castillo de San Sebasti√°n del Pastelillo, a fortress on the outskirts of Cartagena de Indias. She was also the granddaughter of Brigadier Don Juan de Herrera y Sotomayor (died 1732), a prominent military engineer of Cartagena de Indias and founder of the Academia Militar de Matem√°ticas de Am√©rica (Military Academy of Mathematics of America). Her great-grandfather was Captain General Don Jos√© Antonio de Herrera y Sotomayor, who had been Governor of R√≠o de la Plata from 1682-1691. In raising his daughter, Lieutenant Colonel Herrera had tried to educate her not only in military exercises such as the handling of the cannon, but also in the principles of honor, faith and patriotism. Rafaela and her father left Cartagena in 1753, when the latter was assigned as Commander of the garrison at the Fortress of the Immaculate Conception on the San Juan River in the Province of Nicaragua, in relief of Lieutenant Colonel Don Juan Antonio Alonso de Arce. The Battle for the R√≠o San Juan de Nicaragua Fortress of the Immaculate Conception Flag used in the Spanish coastal fortifications from 1701 to 1785 Because it represented a potential route between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans as well as the possibility of expanding their colonization of Central America beyond the Mosquito Coast, Nicaragua was a major target of attacks by the British during the 18th century. In 1762, William Lyttelton, the British governor and commander-in-chief of Jamaica, proposed a naval expedition to Nicaragua. The goal was to sail up the San Juan River to Lake Nicaragua and capture the town of Granada, which would effectively cut Spanish America in half as well as provide potential access to the Pacific Ocean. The first and greatest obstacle to success was to capture the Fortress of the Immaculate Conception. The conflict began in June 1762, during the administration of interim Governor of Nicaragua Melchor Vidal de Lorca y Villena. Instigated and aided by the British expeditionary force, a group of Miskito Sambu filibusters attacked cocoa plantations in the Valley of Matina. The following month they raided many undefended settlements in Nicaragua, including Jinotega, Acoyapa, Lovig√ºisca, San Pedro de L√≥vago, the mission of Apompu√° near Juigalpa and Muy Muy, burning and looting the villages as well as capturing some Spanish prisoners. Many of the people they captured were sold as slaves to British merchants and transported to Jamaica. The combined British and Miskito Sambu expeditionary force headed towards the Fortress of the Immaculate Conception on the San Juan River in July. The attacking force consisted of two thousand men and more than fifty boats, while the soldiers at the fortress numbered only around a hundred. To make matters worse, the invaders threatened the region at a time when the commander of the Fortress of the Immaculate Conception, Jos√© Herrera, was mortally ill. As he lay on his deathbed, Rafaela made a solemn oath to her father that she would defend the fortress at the cost of her life if necessary. The elder Herrera died some time between July 15 and July 17, and Lieutenant Don Juan de Aguilar y Santa Cruz assumed temporary command of the garrison. A few days later, on July 26, 1762, a combined British and Miskito Sambu expeditionary force laid siege to the fortress during what would later be called the Battle for the R√≠o San Juan de Nicaragua. At 4 o‚Äôclock that morning, the lookout on duty heard cannon fire from the east, in the direction of an observation post which was located at the junction of the Bartola and San Juan rivers. Shortly thereafter, the invaders captured the observation post and its defenders. The British commander learned from the Spanish prisoners that the fortress was in disarray due to the recent death of its commander. A few hours later, with his fleet anchored in the river, the British commander sent an envoy to demand the unconditional surrender of the fortress in exchange for the avoidance of further hostilities. The second in command of the garrison, a sergeant, was about to grant the request when the 19-year-old Herrera intervened. Seeing what she perceived as the cowardly attitude of the defenders, Herrera chided: \\"Have you forgotten the duties imposed by military honor? Are you going to allow the enemy to steal this fortress, which is the safeguard of the Province of Nicaragua and of your families?\\" Driven by her promise to her late father and ancestors and knowing the risk to her honor and virginity with the barbarity of the Miskito Sambu, she strongly opposed the surrender of the fort and insisting that each soldier take his place fighting. She ordered the gates of the fortress to be locked, took the keys and placed sentries. In response to the rejection of their demands, the British formed a skirmish line, believing that this would be sufficient to achieve the desired effect. Herrera, trained in the handling of weapons, fired one of the cannons and managed to kill the British commander with the third volley of cannon fire. Enraged by the death of their boss, the British hoisted their battle ensign and began a vigorous attack upon the fortress which continued throughout the night. The garrison, energized by Herrera‚Äôs heroism, mounted a fierce resistance which inflicted great losses to the British men and boats. At nightfall, Herrera ordered the troops to throw some sheets soaked with alcohol into the river on floating branches and set on fire. The current dragged the burning material towards the enemy craft. This unexpected action forced the invading British troops to suspend their attack for the rest of the night and retreat to defensive positions. The next day the British tried to besiege the fortress, with little progress and many casualties on their side. Inspired by Herrera's acts of heroism, Lieutenant Juan de Aguilar, the pro tempore garrison commander, led the defenders to victory in a battle that lasted six days. Herrera handled the cannons of the fortress and the Spanish managed not only to defend the strategic position but also to defeat a much larger and better trained military force. The British finally lifted their siege and retreated on August 3, 1762. They withdrew to the mouth of San Juan River, where their presence impeded the flow of shipping into the Caribbean Sea for some time. Fortunately for the defenders of the fortress, Spain and Britain began peace negotiations (in Fontainebleau on November 3, 1762), which culminated in the Treaty of Paris on February 10, 1763. Cuba and Manila, which had been captured by the British, were returned to Spain and the Spanish ceded Florida to the British. Later life Herrera later married Don Pablo Mora, a citizen of Granada. The couple bore five children, of whom two were paralyzed. Her husband died after the birth of their fifth child, and the family lived in poverty in barrio Corinto (a poor neighborhood in Granada) until 1781. On November 11, 1781, King Charles III of Spain issued a royal decree granting Herrera a pension for life as a reward for her heroic actions during the Battle for the R√≠o San Juan de Nicaragua; she received some land and a pension of 600 pesos in payment for her merits.

It is set against the backdrop of Chambal forest near Morena, Madhya Pradesh. The story is loosely based on the life of Phoolan Devi, the dacoit-turned politician. Plot The series revolves around a little village girl named Phulwa (whose name literally means \\"flower\\"), living in a bandit-infested part of India. She is a sweet, innocent and loving girl but, unluckily, gets caught in the middle of a ruthless feud. She loses most of her family, as well as her childlike innocence, at an early age. Phulwa has a much older foster brother named Bhavani (Prashant Narayanan), who is a bandit. Shankar (Angad Hasija), who wants to take revenge against Bhavani, abducts Phulwa. Circumstances make it appear that Shankar and Phulwa are married to each other. The village council (panchayat) decides that they have to stay together as a couple, though Shankar is nearly three times Phulwa's age. Shankar believes that Bhavani killed his elder brother and sister-in-law. Moreover, Shankar's younger sister Mahua (Wasna Ahmed) was in love with Bhavani but he had left her. Shankar grows fond of the innocent little Phulwa. He tries to make amends for his earlier actions, which had spoiled her life. Phulwa idolises Shankar and calls him 'Masterji' out of respect. Sharbati, a distant relative, wants to marry Shankar, but does not encourage her. The local landlord and politician, Bade Thakur aka Daroga Singh, sends a proposal for Mahua to marry his son, Chhote Thakur. Mahua runs away from the wedding because she still loves Bhavani but is killed by a spurned Chhote Thakur. Later, Shankar learns that the Thakur father-son duo, not Bhavani, had killed his brother and sister-in-law as well. The Thakurs with Sharbati's help capture Phulwa, her parents and siblings. Shankar and Bhavani go to rescue them. Bhavani saves Phulwa and her brother Babu, but Phulwa's parents and Shankar are killed. Phulwa and Babu accompany Bhavani to the hideout of his bandit group. Phulwa swears to take revenge for the deaths of 'Masterji' (Shankar) and her parents and joins the bandits. Ten years later, Phulwa has grown up into a tough and fearless woman. She helps the poor, fights injustice, and considers the Thakurs as her greatest enemies. Chhote Thakur is married to Sharbati. One day, Phulwa comes face-to-face with the couple and is forced to kill Chhote Thakur in self-defence. Bade Thakur and Sharbati pledge revenge against Phulwa for the killing of Chhote Thakur. A stranger named Shatrughan (Ajay Chaudhary) enters Phulwa's group and slowly gains her confidence. Phulwa feels that with the death of Chhote Thakur she is done with her revenge. However, the head of the bandits, Gayatri (Shikha Singh), tells her not to put down arms. News spreads that a new ACP (Assistant Commissioner of Police) has taken charge of the area. After a few weeks, it is revealed that Shatrughan is the new ACP in disguise. His real name is Abhay Singh. He arrests Phulwa and her friends. A lawyer named Roshni (Rakshanda Khan) fights on their behalf in court. She argues that Phulwa is innocent and should be allowed to go home. It is then revealed that Abhay is the out-of- wedlock son of Bade Thakur and is fiercely loyal to his father, whom he considers a good man. Bade Thakur is now an aspiring politician. As a publicity stunt, he offers to get Phulwa married to Abhay. Phulwa accepts because it will mean her release from jail. Abhay is already engaged to his colleague Aarti but on his wedding day Phulwa replaces Aarti's and marries Abhay. It is revealed that Aarti helped Phulwa out of sympathy. Bade Thakur and Abhay are furious but helpless. Phulwa starts staying at Thakur's house as the new daughter-in-law of the family. Her aim is to expose the Thakur's misdeeds and take revenge. Abhay and Phulwa grow closer. Bade Thakur reveals that he murdered Abhay's mother and arranges for Abhay to meet with an accident. Fighting for his life, Abhay needs blood that Thakur agrees to donate only if Phulwa becomes his slave. While Phulwa agrees, the doctor tells them that while Abhay will live, he won't be able to move due to damage to his spine leaving Phulwa shocked. A new surgeon, Dr. Arjun performs a successful surgery and Abhay is cured, but here Arjun's secret is revealed. Arjun is Shankar's younger brother who has come to avenge his brothers death. He plans to kill both Abhay and Phulwa mistakenly thinking that Phulwa killed Shankar. Babu tells Arjun who the real culprit is. Abhay with the help of Arjun and Babu traps Thakur.

Picture shows the Bibi Mariam Cannon The Choto Katra with its enclosed Mosque, Dhaka (1817) by Charles D'Oyly's and constructed by Shaista Khan. Sir Charles D'Oyly in 1823. Chawk Bazaar is a well known bazaar in Chowkbazar Thana, Old Dhaka, Bangladesh. It dates back to the Mughal period. History Chowk Bazaar was one of the most famous business and social meeting centres of Dhaka in the Mughal period. Even after 400 years it is still as famous as before. It is one of Dhaka's oldest town markets and it formed in the place where other old markets once were. King Maan Singh protested for the country on behalf of Mugal kingdom. In 1602 he transferred the head office in Bawal to the present Central Prison and also the Mughal Durgo, that's how Chowk Bazaar formed. In 1702, Murshid Kuli Kha named the market \\"Padosha\\" or \\"Badshahi Bazar\\". From 1733 to 1734, his son-in-law, Murshid Kuli Kha II, renovated the market. It is thought to have started in Munsil times and for Mursid Kuli Kha the market was established. In the 18th century, Chowk Bazaar was a famous social and business centre. Along with the Historical significance, the geological settlement of this zone also contributed to its massive activities, expansion, population increase, and popularity. The great Buriganga river was just at the South of Chak-Bazaar, which contributed easy water transport and thus made trade more frequent and efficient. Sometimes this Chak-Bazaar was known as Chak-Port. Chak-Bazaar was located in such a way that 10 different other places were connected with Chak-Bazaar by straight roads. However the area was not so good-looking. From 1823 to 1825, Dhaka community's two men, Dhaka's Magistrate Dos and Walters wanted Chowk Bazaar in the right way and improve the nearby roads condition. For this Dos suggested for the Nawabpur Road to widen as it was linked with Chowk Bazaar. The road was very narrow and filled with cottages but there was no improvement by the end of the 18th century. Dhaka Community did not give permission but Walter got permission later. He removed all illegal markets in Chowk Bazaar and made a 460 ft length, 4 ft high and 1/2 ft thick wall surrounding it. In front of Chowk Bazaar there was Moriom's Canon 'Kaman'. It was in Shoari Ghat before. Not only that he also widen the way from Chowk Bazaar to Islampur. In 1840, James Taylor said Chowk Bazaar is in the west side of the country and alongside the river. It is a huge square surrounded by markets. Here selling takes place. Various products and materials were used to sold in Chowk bazaar. Fruits, vegetables, toys, sweets and other small products were used to sold and supplied in this Bazaar. The Chowk Bazaar Business centre is situated in a place which was known as \\" Nakhash\\". The \\"Nakhash\\" is an Arabic word, which is known to be the place where animals and slaves were bought and sold. It was believed that there was a time when slaves were sold, supplied, and bought in an open market and there was low wall and suitable place for driving. In 1869 there was questioning about renovating. In local newspaper they mentioned about renovating but shopkeepers were against it and said there was no need for it. In 1906, a journal was published by Bradly Bart, it was named as Romance of an Eastern Capital. There Sir Bradly Bart mentioned about the lavish lifestyle of Mughol period. He wrote that \\" Though Chowk Bazaar has lost its earlier Moghol lavish and extreme expression, but the Chowk Mosque still become crowded by Muslim worshippers. The whole Mosque is decorated by exterior lights and somehow people try to bring the old image and taste of the early Moghol period into the Mosque. According to Bradly's journal, the Chowk Mosque played its role as the main central Mosque. At that time there was no electronic loud speaker system to amplify the sound of Ajaan. The Ajaan was called up with loud voices from the Chowk Mosque. During Jumma the Muslims gather and stand for prayer in front of this Chowk Masque, just like the Eid Jamat. Within Chowk Bazaar, Islam Kha constructed a Fort during the 17th century, which lasted till 1772. After that the central Jail was established over this Fort. It was believed that sometimes the guilty condemned prisoners were used to hang to death on the centre of the Chowk Bazaar plaza. There was a setup for performing the Prosecution process within the Chowk Bazaar field, by the Central Jail authorities. Raia Bazaar was to be removed and prison was supposed to be placed which would be a problem for people living there. In 1917, Patrick Gaddes said the same. He was told to submit Dhaka Government proposal of Development. He asked for the removal of the prison from Chowk Bazaar, still the same proposal is going on. At the beginning of the 19th century, it was still the same, during Ramadan it is very crowded because of the mogli food available there. From first day of Ramadan people always comes here.

Nazir Hossain said that before getting marriage, bridegrooms went around Chowk Bazaar. Some went around once, five times seven times etc. All this made Chowk Bazaar filled with fun and celebrations.

Several buildings in the bazaar were damaged during a fire in 2019. Architectural structures There are many historical structures in Chowk Bazaar which include the Mughal Shahi Mosque, Choto Katra by Shaista Khan and Bara Katra by Mughal prince Shah Shuja. Present bazaar description It is a very good place for shopping as variety of goods is available and they are sold at the cheapest rates. The bazaar has spice shops. During Ramadan Chowk Bazaar is famous for its Iftar items which include Moglai and other traditional items.It is a very crowded place and the roads are mostly jam-packed. Shai Mosque Chowk Bazaar Shai Mosque was built in 1676. This three domed mosque was made by Shaista Khan. Made on 10 feet high platform, 94 feet length and 80 feet width. It was divided among the shops from the ancient times and it was maintained by the shop rents. The mosque was built according to the rules of Shaista Khan and nearby places. After lot of time of innovation it lost its appeal Dhaka's noble people came to pray here.

It is a rock pinnacle, high, and is the symbol of Saxon Switzerland. It was first climbed on 19 September 1905 by mountaineers.  Location  The Barbarine belongs to the Pfaffenstein massif near the village of Pfaffendorf in the borough of K√∂nigstein.  Development for sport climbing  An ascent by the climber, Felix Wendschuh, on 9 September 1905 was the first documented attempt to climb the Barbarine. He climbed up to a point underneath the summit block, at least to the end of the crevice. The story that Keiler, the publican in Pfaffenstein, had forced him to turn around under threat, should probably be discounted. Keiler was a climber himself and would have had nothing against a climb, especially as those who first climbed it later left documentary evidence with him in the pub. Postcard portraying the first ascent (with incorrect date: 8 April 1906) On 19 September 1905 the Dresden climber, Rudolf Fehrmann, and the American, Oliver Perry-Smith, succeeded in becoming the first to conquer the Barbarine. They had climbed to just under the summit before midday, but were too tired to scale the last overhang on the summit head until later. Another route, on the valley side, was opened by Alfred Hermann on 8 July 1924. Lightning strikes on the summit and progressive erosion rendered the upper part of the pinnacle increasingly unstable, so that in 1946 mountaineers poured concrete into the hollow. Due to the continued erosion, in 1964 further work was carried out; the summit block being underpinned and supported with steel cables. The broken summit block was protected from further erosion by a surrounding steel cable. Not until 1975 was a general ban on climbing the pinnacle imposed. In 1979/80 the summit blocks were reinforced with sandstone. The upper block was given a cap of artificial sandstone and was treated with water-repellant chemicals. The geological natural monument is only climbed occasionally today ‚Äì mainly by geologists and scientists who hope to avert further damage.Ralph Keiler: Der Pfaffenstein. Berg- & Naturverlag R√∂lke, Dresden 2004, p. 110 ff.  The legend of the Barbarine  According to legend, the Barbarine is a petrified virgin, the \\"perpetual memorial of a punishment, according to which it so happened that a mother had told her daughter to go to church on Sunday, but during the service the daughter went up the Pfaffstein into the bilberries and when her mother found her there, she cursed her daughter in anger, pronouncing that she must be turned to stone on the spot; whereupon it happened in a moment, and therefore, this virgin turned to stone for ever warns all disobedient children with her stony appearance.\\"' The name Barbarine was taken from the girl's Christian name. In a variation of this legend the mother is an evil witch and the girl meets her beloved, a hunter, at the Pfaffenstein.

The lasing medium is usually a dye doped into the liquid crystal. Liquid-crystal lasers are comparable in size to diode lasers, but provide the continuous wide spectrum tunability of dye lasers while maintaining a large coherence area. The tuning range is typically several tens of nanometers.Woltman 2007, p. 357 Self-organization at micrometer scales reduces manufacturing complexity compared to using layered photonic metamaterials. Operation may be either in continuous wave mode or in pulsed mode. History Distributed feedback lasing using Bragg reflection of a periodic structure instead of external mirrors was first proposed in 1971, predicted theoretically with cholesteric liquid crystals in 1978, achieved experimentally in 1980, and explained in terms of a photonic band gap in 1998.Woltman 2007, p. 310 A United States Patent issued in 1973 described a liquid-crystal laser that uses \\"a liquid lasing medium having internal distributed feedback by virtue of the molecular structure of a cholesteric liquid-crystal material.\\" Mechanism Starting with a liquid crystal in the nematic phase, the desired helical pitch (the distance along the helical axis for one complete rotation of the nematic plane subunits) can be achieved by doping the liquid crystal with a chiral molecule. For light circularly polarized with the same handedness, this regular modulation of the refractive index yields selective reflection of the wavelength given by the helical pitch, allowing the liquid-crystal laser to serve as its own resonator cavity. Photonic crystals are amenable to band theory methods, with the periodic dielectric structure playing the role of the periodic electric potential and a photonic band gap (reflection notch) corresponding to forbidden frequencies. The lower photon group velocity and higher density of states near the photonic bandgap suppresses spontaneous emission and enhances stimulated emission, providing favorable conditions for lasing. If the electronic band edge falls in the photonic bandgap, electron-hole recombination is strictly suppressed. This allows for devices with high lasing efficiency, low lasing threshold, and stable frequency, where the liquid-crystal laser acts its own waveguide. \\"Colossal\\" nonlinear change in refractive index is achievable in doped nematic-phase liquid crystals, that is the refractive index can change with illumination intensity at a rate of about 103cm2/W of illumination intensity. Most systems use a semiconductor pumping laser to achieve population inversion, though flash lamp and electrical pumping systems are possible. Tuning of the output wavelength is achieved by smoothly varying the helical pitch: as the winding changes, so does the length scale of the crystal. This in turn shifts the band edge and changes the optical path length in the lasing cavity. Applying a static electric field perpendicular to the dipole moment of the local nematic phase rotates the rod-like subunits in the hexagonal plane and reorders the chiral phase, winding or unwinding the helical pitch. Similarly, optical tuning of the output wavelength is available using laser light far from the pick-up frequency of the gain medium, with degree of rotation governed by intensity and the angle between the polarization of the incident light and the dipole moment. Reorientation is stable and reversible. The chiral pitch of a cholesteric phase tends to unwind with increasing temperature, with a disorder-order transition to the higher symmetry nematic phase at the high end. By applying a temperature gradient perpendicular to the direction of emission varying the location of stimulation, frequency may be selected across a continuous spectrum. Similarly, a quasi-continuous doping gradient yields multiple laser lines from different locations on the same sample. Spatial tuning may also be accomplished using a wedge cell. The boundary conditions of the narrower cell squeeze the helical pitch by requiring a particular orientation at the edge, with discrete jumps where the outer cells rotate to the next stable orientation; frequency variation between jumps is continuous. If a defect is introduced into the liquid crystal to disturb the periodicity, a single allowed mode may be created inside of the photonic bandgap, reducing power leeching by spontaneous emission at adjacent frequencies. Defect mode lasing was first predicted in 1987, and was demonstrated in 2003.Woltman 2007, pp. 332‚Äì334 While most such thin films lase on the axis normal to the film's surface, some will lase on a conic angle around that axis. Applications * Biomedical sensing: small size, low cost, and low power consumption offer a variety of advantages in biomedical sensing applications. Potentially, liquid-crystal lasers could form the basis for \\"lab on a chip\\" devices that provide immediate readings without sending a sample away to a separate lab. * Medical: low emission power limits such medical procedures as cutting during surgeries, but liquid-crystal lasers show potential to be used in microscopy techniques and in vivo techniques such as photodynamic therapy. * Display screens: liquid-crystal-laser-based displays offer most of the advantages of standard liquid-crystal displays, but the low spectral spread gives more precise control over color. Individual elements are small enough to act as single pixels while retaining high brightness and color definition. A system in which each pixel is a single spatially tuned device could avoid the sometimes long relaxation times of dynamic tuning, and could emit any color using spatial addressing and the same monochromatic pumping source. * Environmental sensing: using a material with a helical pitch highly sensitive to temperature, electric field, magnetic field, or mechanical strain, color shift of the output laser provides a simple, direct measurement of environmental conditions.

Enrollment at the school is currently 150 children with ages ranging from 8 through to 18.  Origins  Yayasan Slukat Learning Center is an official Indonesian non-profit foundation founded by Gusti Agung Rai and his family in 2007 for the children of Keramas village, with the first English classes taking place in December 2008. The driving force behind Slukat Learning Centre is a Balinese family and their belief in the power of free education for all and a child's ability to reach beyond the norm with a little faith and support from others.  Mission  The economy in Bali is dominated by tourism. In the future, most of the youth from the Gianyar Regency might seek work in the tourism industry, where English is required. Prior to Slukat offering free English classes, there was no free training for underprivileged youth of the area. The mission of Slukat is to develop character-building through self-confidence, local wisdom (culture), environment, compassion, integrity, and entrepreneurship. Slukat helps students develop their English language skills and computer and communication techniques.  Programs  Slukat has several programs for its students. Free English classes are provided to children to assist them in their ability for future development. Three levels of English curriculum are taught by international volunteer teachers. For the Organic Program, an organic community garden has been created by the Clean & Green class to utilize compost and manure to grow sustainable local produce. All students of the center participate in maintaining and growing Slukat's garden, giving them the opportunity to understand the potential of fruit and vegetables. In addition, Slukat has a recycling program, where the children's raised awareness from the Clean & Green class of the dangers of poor waste management to their heath, their village, and the environment as a whole drove them to establish a recycling station. All students participate in the center's recycling bank, which rewards students via a point system on a monthly basis. Students now bring in excess of 100 kg of plastics to the center each month which would otherwise be burnt or discarded in local waterways. Slukat Learning Center exists today due to the power of scholarships and founder Pak Agung Rai's desire to learn, propelling himself from the struggles of village life to the world's leading universities. Slukat now provides this opportunity to its dedicated students, giving them the potential to also have a first class international education. Volunteers from abroad work as volunteers at the Center between two and 12 weeks, providing free English classes to the children of the area.

The program was created by Tony Cannon, co-founder of fighting game community site Shoryuken and the popular Evolution Championship Series. History Before its creation, GGPO creator Tony Cannon was completely dissatisfied with the 2006 Xbox 360 re-release of Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting after experiencing its criticized online capabilities. As a reaction to its service, Cannon began development on GGPO and released the first version in late 2006. Cannon later demonstrated GGPO to Capcom, which was positively received. The downloadable GGPO client supported many games from Capcom and SNK, including Super Street Fighter II Turbo, The King of Fighters 2002, and Metal Slug X through the use of a built-in emulator. Video game companies have also implemented a licensed version of GGPO. Games using it include Skullgirls and Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike Online Edition. On October 9th, 2019 Cannon announced on his Twitter account that GGPO was now open source and available under the MIT License. Design GGPO uses a netcode technique called ‚Äúrollback‚Äù. Rather than waiting for input to be received from other players before simulating the next frame, GGPO predicts the inputs they will send and simulates the next frame without delay using that assumption. When other players‚Äô inputs arrive, if any input didn‚Äôt match the prediction, GGPO rolls back the state of the game to the last correct state, then replays all players‚Äô revised inputs back until the current frame. The hope is that the predictions will be correct most of the time, allowing smooth play with minimal sudden changes to the game state. The system in itself is highly similar to client-side prediction, but applied to a peer-to- peer setup. The client program can allow players to manually adjust native input delay in high-ping situations, either creating a possibly-jerky yet accurate representation or a smoother game with input delay. GGPO client GGPO was originally bundled with a client which enabled users to play supported games online with other players. A matchmaking system allowed players to request challenges from other users, while non-participants could spectate the match and chat. Once a challenge initiated, the match ran a ROM through its prepackaged emulator, FinalBurn Alpha. This client was discontinued, and superseded by other clients which make use of GGPO's networking middleware, such as Fightcade or RedGGPO.

He is the founder and former director of the Sudan Social Development Organization (SUDO) and has been repeatedly jailed for charges related to his human rights work. Work with SUDO and early arrests Under Mudawi's leadership, SUDO began work in bringing the War in Darfur to the world's attention in 2003. Along with their human rights reporting, SUDO also initiated water, sanitation and health projects in the area, along with local workshops on human rights and assistance for internally displaced persons. For this work, Mudawi was awarded the 2005 Human Rights First Award and the 2005 Front Line Award for Human Rights Defenders at Risk. Mudawi was arrested at his home in December 2003 after a visit to Darfur. He was charged with \\"crimes against the state\\", with the evidence against him including possession of documents from Amnesty International. This charge carried the possibility of being sentenced to death, but the government dropped its case in August 2004.Amnesty International (2005), Report 2005 (accessed 25 September 2006) At 2 a.m. on 24 January 2005, Mudawi was re-arrested at his home in Kondua, North Kurdufan, along with a friend, Salah Mohamed Abdelrahman. Mudawi was then held for two months without a formal charge, during which time he began a hunger strike in protest. His arrests were widely protested by groups including Human Rights Watch, Front Line Defenders, Amnesty International, and the Irish government. He was eventually released without being brought to trial. By 2006, Mudawi's role had become prominent enough that New York Times reporter Nicholas Kristof described him as \\"one of the leading human rights advocates in Sudan\\". In 2007, he attended a conference in Prague organized by Natan Sharansky, V√°clav Havel, and Jos√© Mar√≠a Aznar, where he met with dissident figures from around the world as well as US President George W. Bush. Closing of SUDO and 2010 arrests On 5 March 2009, the same day that President Omar al-Bashir was indicted by the ICC for crimes against humanity, the Sudanese government ordered the closure of SUDO, and its offices were taken over by state security forces. The New York Times reported that the letter closing the offices \\"came from the Humanitarian Affairs Commission, which is run by Ahmed Haroun, one of the people facing an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for mass slaughter in Darfur.\\" Mudawi and the organization appealed their closure in court, winning the appeal in April 2010. However, according to a 2011 SUDO press release, the organization remained effectively closed: \\"in Sudan you can win a case but nothing changes. SUDO‚Äôs offices remained locked, its assets remained frozen, and the organization in Sudan was not allowed to resume operations.\\" At the same time, Mudawi faced repeated trials for \\"financial mismanagement\\" of SUDO's resources. He was initially acquitted of these charges on 5 March 2010, but the case's judge, Abdel Monim Mohammed Saleim, reversed the acquittal on 22 December, re-imprisoning Mudawi. He was sentenced to \\"one year imprisonment and a fine of 3,000 Sudanese pounds (USD 1,250) for financial mismanagement.\\" Mudawi was released on 25 January with notice that the time he had served had been sufficient; however, as of January 2011, the charges against him remained, and Amnesty International continued to consider him a prisoner of conscience. Mudawi was released on 29 August 2017.

When a British soldier returns home from Kiev, he joins an old friend in working as contract killers. His disturbed past surfaces as he spins out of control during jobs and ominous employers raise the stakes. It was filmed in Sheffield, South Yorkshire in England.  Plot  Jay and Gal are former soldiers who have become hitmen since they left the military. While Gal is laid back, Jay is still suffering from an unspecified disastrous mission in Kiev. Despite the urging of his wife Shel, he has not worked since, and they are running out of money. Shel organises a dinner party to which she invites Gal and his latest girlfriend, Fiona, a human resources manager. During the evening, Gal reveals he has a new job for them, which Shel encourages him to take. Meanwhile, Fiona goes to the toilet, carves a symbol on the back of the bathroom mirror, and takes a tissue that Jay had used to mop up his blood after a shaving accident. Jay accepts the job, and the two meet the shadowy client, who has a list of three people he wants killed. The employer unexpectedly cuts Jay's hand and his own, so that the contract is effectively signed in blood. Their first target, captioned as \\"The Priest\\", appears to recognise Jay and thanks him just before being killed. The second name on the list, \\"The Librarian\\", is an archivist who keeps a collection of horrific, sickening videos of an undisclosed nature. He also thanks Jay, who, out of disgust for the videos, tortures and savagely beats him to death with a hammer. Jay insists on chasing down and killing the archivist's associates, and as Gal looks into their files, he finds a folder on himself and Jay, including details of their Kiev mission. Although they do not recognise it, the file includes the symbol that Fiona carved in Jay's mirror. Gal informs Jay that while raiding the safe in the home of the second target, he took enough money to cover the total sum they would receive for the contract. The pair decide to abandon the contract and return home. When his cut hand becomes infected, Jay visits his doctor, only to find that his regular doctor has been replaced by another man who will only give him cryptic advice. Jay and Gal return to their client and offer to find replacements to kill the last name on the list. The client refuses and says that both hitmen and their families will be killed if they do not complete the contract. Shel takes their son Sam to the family's cottage for safekeeping while Jay and Gal go back to work. Their final mark, \\"The MP\\", is a Member of Parliament who lives in a mansion. While observing the house, the pair witness a strange ceremony in the woods that culminates in human sacrifice. Jay opens fire with an assault rifle, and the leader of the ceremony presents himself for Jay to execute. He kills the leader and several cultists before the remaining masked members chase the hitmen into an underground complex. They capture and disembowel Gal, forcing Jay to perform a mercy killing on him. Emerging from the tunnels, Jay flees to the family cottage and meets with Shel. When he goes outside, he sees that their car's tires have been slashed and lit torches have been placed around the nearby field. Jay attempts to locate their attackers, but he is knocked unconscious. Inside the cottage, Shel arms herself and shoots several invaders. Jay awakens in the field surrounded by the cultists, who strip him and place a mask over his face. He is confronted by his last victim, \\"The Hunchback\\", a masked and cloaked person armed with a knife. After a brutal knife fight, Jay triumphs, only to discover that the Hunchback was his wife with Sam strapped to her back. Shel appears to laugh as she dies. The cultists applaud and remove their masks, revealing Fiona, the hitmen's client, and the man from the doctor's office amongst their number. Jay is crowned by the cultists.

The original treatment was a hybrid of the styles and themes of Get Carter and H. P. Lovecraft that was to have been shot in the Philippines. Shooting took place over 18 days. Wheatley was influenced by Stanley Kubrick in that he sought to find imagery first, then wove the plot around it. In each scene, they shot one take using the script and then paraphrased and improvised. The actors also worked out back stories for their characters through improvisation. The script was much more explicit in its themes and ideas, but Wheatley edited the film to form a more ambiguous and minimalist story. By keeping allusions to those scenes, he wanted to give viewers enough information to form their own interpretation. Wheatley dislikes exposition, so he decided to avoid it. Instead, he focused on his own fears: nightmares that he had as a child and domestic disharmony. Themes included suburban desolation, homogeneity, and showing hitmen as violent murderers. Wheatley also wanted to highlight current events: unpopular wars, a recession, and erosion of the social contract. The film's story came partially from casting ideas, and Wheatley specifically wrote the part of Jay for Neil Maskell, with whom he'd worked previously on a TV series. Wheatley always had a plan for the ending and made sure the story was logically consistent, though he states that there are multiple possible interpretations and the cult itself remains scarier when its motives and background are shrouded in mystery. Wheatley states that cultists are a popular choice of antagonist because people are uneasy about the world and feel a lack of control and understanding; politicians and bankers who control their lives seem inscrutable. The cult's symbol was designed by Wheatley, who later recognised influence from The Blair Witch Project. Wheatley was worried people might call him on its similarities, but he was instead surprised to find people comparing it to a symbol from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, with which he is unfamiliar. The film's most violent scene, the hammer murder, came about when Wheatley was surprised at the shocking violence in The Orphanage, which he had assumed would be a subtle art-house film. Wheatley stated that this turn toward violent horror in The Orphanage made the rest of the film unpredictable; he wanted a similar unpredictability in his own film, so that viewers were never sure whether the film would be subtle or explicit. The song \\"It Could Have Been Better\\", used in the film, is performed by Joan Armatrading. It was written by Armatrading and Pam Nestor and is from the 1972 album Whatever's for Us.http://www.soundtrack.net/movie/kill-list/ retrieved 15h February 2014  Release  The film's North American premiere was 12 March 2011 at SXSW in Austin. It was released to UK cinemas on 2 September 2011. IFC Films brought the film to video on demand 4 January 2012, and it received a US theatrical release 3 February 2012. It was released on home video in the UK on 26 December 2011 and 14 August 2012 in the US.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 77% of 87 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review, and the average rating was 7.1/10; the consensus is: \\"Kill List is an expertly executed slow-burn crime thriller that thrives on tension before morphing into visceral horror.\\" Metacritic, which assigns a normalized score, rated the film 67/100 based on 22 reviews. Total Film rated the film 5/5 stars and said that as well as being a horror film it was \\"also a mystery movie, a road movie and a grotesque riff on Arthurian legend, and is influenced as much by John Cassavetes, Alan Clarke and Ken Loach as Witchfinder General, The Wicker Man and The Blood On Satan's Claw\\" before concluding that \\"[a]uthentic dialogue, pitch-perfect performances and seductively scuzzy images comprise a film funny and bleak, tender and cruel, serious and 'out-there'. British horror has rarely hit these heights since the mid-'70s.\\" Peter Bradshaw reviewed the film for The Guardian and compared it to The Wicker Man and The Blair Witch Project, but he also said that Kill List \\"often looks like a film by Lynne Ramsay or even Lucrecia Martel, composed in a dreamily unhurried arthouse-realist style that is concerned to capture texture, mood and moment\\", concluding that \\"[a]s far as British horror goes right now, Kill List is pretty much top of the range\\". Mark Kermode reviewed the DVD release for The Observer and stated that \\"[t]he end result is one of the most genuinely disturbing films of the year, a ruthless exercise in audience manipulation that will put even the most hardened genre fans through the emotional mangler\\" and he later named it one of his favourite films of 2011. Philip French of The Observer called the film an \\"edgy, mysterious thriller that begins in one generic mode and jumps, or modulates, into another\\". Tom Huddleston of Time Out London rated the film 5/5 stars and compared it to the work of Shane Meadows. Huddleston called the film \\"nerve-shreddingly effective\\" and predicted the film would top rankings of British films. Kill List also received positive reviews in America. John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter called it a \\"deeply edgy, gory crime film [that] maintains perfectly calibrated tension before dropping a bombshell that will be too much for some viewers\\". Andrew Barker of Variety called it an \\"artful, sensitively acted thriller\\". Roger Ebert rated it 3/4 stars and called it \\"baffling and goofy, blood-soaked and not boring\\". David Harley of Bloody Disgusting rated it 4/5 stars and called it \\"an atmospheric delight, boasting incredibly intense performances by Maskell and Smiley, and a doozy of an ending that will unhinge even the most hardened of genre fans\\". Writing for Dread Central, Jason Jenkins rated the film 4.5/5 stars and placed the film on his personal top ten list of the year, while Gareth Jones rated it 3.5/5 stars and called it \\"an impeccably crafted thriller\\" that is frustrating for its lack of answers. Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times called the plot \\"undercooked and a little baffling\\" but wrote, \\"[W]hen the plot doglegs into insanity, and the characters follow suit, this brutal fever dream refuses to fall apart\\". Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly rated it C and negatively compared it to its influences. Scott Tobias of NPR compared it to Lost tendency to set up mysteries and leave them unexplained. In 2015, the film was included in The Guardians top 50 films of the demi-decade. The A.V. Club listed it number 18 in their 25 Best Horror Movies Since The Year 2000.

The hill now boasts an inn, an observation tower, several viewing points and other places of interest on the mountain.

The best-known rock and symbol of the Pfaffenstein is the Barbarine,Keiler (2004), p. 40. a rock pinnacle, that has been placed out of bounds to climbers since 1975 due to serious erosion damage.General information on the rocks, accessed on 24 June 2010  Location and area  Map of the Pfaffenstein The Pfaffenstein lies about south of the village of Pfaffendorf in the borough of K√∂nigstein. Another nearby settlement is Cunnersdorf about southeast. Its nearest neighbour is the Quirl to the northwest, another table hill. To the south, the mountain is surrounded by woods that drop away to the stream of Cunnersdorfer Bach. Around the northern part of the Pfaffenstein the land is predominantly used for agriculture. The mountain looks like an elongated summit plateau running north-to-south for about , with a width of up to from west-to-east. It has an area of some twelve hectares and rises about above the surrounding countryside. The actual summit lies in the southern part of the plateau. The edge of the Pfaffenstein is formed by rugged and heavily fissured sandstone rocks. There are numerous isolated rock formations around the main massif, the best-known being the Barbarine on the southern tip of the Pfaffenstein. Other significant rock pinnacles are the K√∂nigspitze, the F√∂rster, the Bundesfels, the Rauhe Zinne, the J√§ckelfels, the Pfaffenschluchtspitzen, the Peterskirche and the Einsiedler.  Origin of the name and legends  The name Pfaffenstein is very probably derived from the nearby village of Pfaffendorf. This settlement in the borough of K√∂nigstein was given its name because its inhabitants paid taxes to the church at K√∂nigstein in the Middle Ages, as evinced by the first mention of the village's name in the records in 1437.Pfaffendorf (last accessed 9 September 2010) Its old name of Jungfernstein (\\"Virgin Rock\\") comes from a legend about the origin of the Barbarine rock pinnacle, according to which a woman sent her daughter to church on Sundays. However, when she caught her picking bilberries on the Pfaffenstein instead, the mother cursed her daughter, turning her to stone.  History = Early history  The plateau of the Pfaffenstein had already been settled by about 3,000 years ago. Archaeological excavations unearthed both Stone Age and Bronze Age artefacts of the Lusatian Culture. On the plateau, near the present hilltop inn, various stone flat axes, clay vessels, a grinding stone and the site of a hearth came to light during digs from 1896 to 1912. In 1921 the innkeeper, Richard Keiler, found two bronze bangles. Other excavations were carried out on the plateau in 1967; they confirmed the settlement as being part of the Lusatian Culture. The diggers found more ceramic artefacts and a whetstone.Keiler (2004), p.66 ff. The site was probably one of the oldest fortifications of the Lusatian Culture. The only prehistoric relic still visible today is the semi-circular rampart, also dating to the Bronze Age, on the western side of the Pfaffenstein near the Bequemer Aufstieg trail. The embankment probably guarded the only entrance to the plateau and was surrounded by a ditch.Keiler (2004), p.75 ff. Archaeological investigations in 1959 and 1961 estimated its age at about 3,000 years. More pieces of ceramic were discovered inside the rampart.  Early Modern Era  The Pfaffenstein was first mentioned in the records in 1548: the official probate register of Pirna recording in that year the right of Pfaffendorf farmers to use the Pfaffenstein for grazing and wood gathering.Keiler (2004), p. 7 The Pfaffenstein was also used in times of war by the villagers of Pfaffendorf as a refuge and hideaway for their cattle. During the Swedish invasion of 1706 a small hut was erected on the mountain for the K√∂nigstein senior forester. The local farmers last used the hill as a place of concealment during wartime in 1813, in this case the War of the Sixth Coalition against Napoleon. Even caves like the Kuhstall Cave must have been used as secret hideaways.Information about the Kuhstall , accessed on 20 June 2010 However, apart from wartime, the Pfaffenstein had few visitors and those were mainly the electorate's appointed hunters who are probably responsible for the dates \\"1702\\" and \\"1714\\" scrawled in the Schwedenkeller and on the Bequemer Aufstieg. On the eastern side of the hill a large rock face collapsed in 1838. One of the piles of rubble at the foot of the cliff is the present- day climbing area of Klamotte. The resulting fresh rock face is visible a long way off and is called the Wei√üe Wand (\\"White Wall\\") on account of its light- coloured, relatively unweathered surface.  First tourist activity in the 19th century  Carl Gottlob J√§ckel (1803-1882), pioneer of tourism on the Pfaffenstein (part of the marble medallion on the J√§ckelfels) Carl Gottlob J√§ckel (1803‚Äì1882) pioneered the exploitation of the Pfaffenstein for tourism in modern times. His good local knowledge made him a trusted tour guide and the locals referred to him as the \\"Mountain Spirit of the Pfaffenstein\\" (Berggeist vom Pfaffenstein) or the R√ºbezahl of the Pfaffenstein. He planned and led the establishment of the first trails and rediscovered the Kuhstall Cave. In 1881 a marble medallion was placed on the J√§ckelfels, a crag named in his honour. The medallion has a life-sized head and shoulders relief with the inscription \\"The explorer and guardian of the Pfaffenstein, Mr. Karl Gottlob J√§ckel honoured by the Fatherland. Alpine Club of Saxonia on 2 October 1881\\". In 1852, at J√§ckel's instigation, Carl Gottlieb Kliemann from Pfaffendorf established the first, small inn on the hill in a cattle stall. Kliemann also blazed the first trails to various viewing points and notable rock formations. Supported by his brother-in-law Kliemann, probably out of self-interest, Friedrich Eduard Goldschmidt, a lithographer and counterfeiter who had escaped from prison in K√∂nigstein on the night of 27 September 1854, forged Anhalt- Dessau five gulden notes in a cave near the cattle hut. It is commonly assumed that it was the cave that now bears his name, Goldschmidt Cave, however, it is possible that he hid in the rather drier Falken Cave. Another theory is that he only went to the cave during the day, but used to stay overnight in his brother-in-law's hut. Goldschmidt was arrested in Dresden at the end of November 1854. A court sentenced Goldschmidt, his brother-in-law Kliemann and other accomplices to jail; the Kliemann inn was then demolished.Keiler (2004), p. 11, 129 ff In the time that followed, the hill was gradually made more accessible. An unknown visitor in 1863 had a stone bench hewn out of a rock. In 1878/1879 Carl Gottlob J√§ckel established the first relatively accessible trail roughly along the line of the present day Bequemer Aufstieg. In order to be able to cater for visitors, in 1880 Paul Ulbrich, the innkeeper of the Pfaffendorf Inn, built a new summer restaurant on the site of the old hut, once again at the suggestion of J√§ckel.Keiler (2004), p. 13 It was replaced in 1891 by a stone building on the site of the present hilltop restaurant.  Fundamental changes around 1900  The Widow Ulbrich sold the inn in 1895 to the Keiler family, who ran it for three generations until 1990. Hermann Keiler extended the inn between 1897 and 1904, giving it its present appearance. Until 1912 everything had to be laboriously carried up the hill, as a result it was decided to build a material lift which is still working today.http://www.nabu.de/nabu/nh/hefte2005/heft3/06879.html Informationen zum ‚ÄûFallbeil‚Äú und zum Lastenaufzug, accessed on 24 June 2010 Hermann Keiler, who had already purchased three plots of land on the hill, originally rented land from several other owners of the hill in order to offer visitors access to the rock formations. Finally he and his son bought as many of the plots as possible, so that the family ended up owning eleven of the twelve hectares of the plateau.Keiler (2004), p. 16f The observation tower on the Pfaffenstein (2008) The first wooden observation tower was inaugurated on 2 September 1894 and offered a comprehensive all-round view from the Pfaffenstein, unimpeded by trees. Its construction was funded by the widow, Mrs Ulbrich. Because the tower had become dilapidated, the new tenant, Hermann Keiler, had it torn down in 1904 and replaced by a new structure made of sandstone. Under the direction of master builder Naumann from K√∂nigstein the new tower was ready by the spring. The requisite stone was cut on the site during the winter; all other materials, such as limestone, roof slates, windows and doors had to be painstakingly carried up the hill.Keiler (2004), p. 21 On 7 August 1904 the tower was consecrated by the priest, Hoyer, from K√∂nigstein. To improve access, the Nadel√∂hr was opened in 1897. About the same time the hill began to be used for recreational climbing, the most important steps being the first ascents of the Nordturm in 1900 and the Barbarine in 1905. Another easy trail up to the Pfaffenstein, the Klammweg, was blazed in 1913. An indication of the popularity of the hill was the visit in 1915 of the Saxon king, Frederick Augustus III, who climbed the Pfaffenstein with his daughters and stopped by at the hilltop inn.Keiler (2004), p. 28  20th century  After being damaged by a lightning strike in 1944 and suffering badly from the resulting erosion, the head of the Barbarine had to be reinforced more than once. Since 1975 it has been out of bounds to climbers, in order to preserve the rock.Keiler (2004), p. 110 ff. In 1992 the state of Saxony purchased the land on the Pfaffenstein from the Keiler family for 2.9 million DM for the Saxon Switzerland Conservation Association. In 1993 the inn also went into the ownership of the association. The observation tower was reopened again in 1995 after renovation. On 26 June 1997 the nature reserve created in 1990 was further extended. Several places of interest may now only be accessed for sport climbing, including the Dom, the K√∂nigsgarten and the Nasse Schlucht.Information about locations no longer accessible at glasperlenspieler.wordpress.com.

They came to Bangladesh around the 18th century. They constructed a memorial in Dhaka. It was constructed for the memory of the Greek merchants who died while in Dhaka. The Greek memorial was built around AD 1900, and appears like an ancient Greek temple; it is a small yellow structure on land owned by the Greek Community, which flourished in Dhaka in the 19th century. It is inside the Teachers and Students Training Centre (TSC) of the University of Dhaka and stands alone on the main Shahbagh Avenue and faces Ramna Race Course. To its southern side is the Atomic Research Centre and to its north a student's centre. It is considered to be the only such structure extant outside Greece.  History  Front of Greek Memorial In the Catholic Cathedral of Calcutta, the presence of two Greek merchants are found in the Latin Memorial tablets. It is mentioned that they died in Calcutta in 1713 and 1726. They are considered as the earliest Greek merchants to be in Indian-subcontinent. Some Greeks came to the sub-continent by road through Persia and Afghanistan and some others came by Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. The Greeks mostly settled in Calcutta and in Dhaka. Between 1770 and 1800, approximately two hundred Greeks were in Dhaka and Narayanganj. In 1780, the first Greek Orthodox church in Calcutta was built, which shows that there was a Greek community large and prosperous enough to support it. Glimpses of the Greek Community from the Dhaka University: A follow-up, Helen Abadzi, World Bank June 27, 1996, p.2 Most of the Greeks in Dhaka were merchants and they used to trade jute and salt. Somewhere around the mid 19th century their business broke down. In the last quarter of 19th century, a memorial was constructed in Ramna, Dhaka in the memory of the early Greek merchants by the London-based Greek firm of Ralli Brothers. Many historians believed in 1815, it was built at the initiative of priest JM MacDonald of the St Thomas Church. Among the foreigners the Greeks were the last to settle as a community in Dhaka.  Architecture value  The monument is square shaped, which, with its projecting bay, one on each of the four sides, makes a cross plan. The bay is formed by two fluted pillars of Doric order, on which rests the entablature and a triangular pediment. Over the top of the eastern face there is an inscription \\"MAKARIOI OYS EPHELEPHOY KAI PROSELABOY.\\" One entrance from the east leads into the memorial. On the walls within are fixed nine inscriptions carved on black stones, and another lies broken on the floor stone is of Sultana Alexander, who died on 6 February 1800. A stone bears the names of the three Ellias brothers. John Demetrius Ellias (d 1836), one of the brothers, was killed by a tiger while he was hunting at Mirpur, 25 miles off what is now the Dhaka University campus. Basil Demetrius, the Greek clerk at St Thomas' Church, was also buried at the place. Besides being a church clerk, he was also a writing master and a teacher at the Dhaka College for 10 years. He died in 1860.  Gravestone inscription  Few of the Inscriptions are listed below, The information was collected from the transcription done by Dr Helen Abadzi, a Greek staff member of the World Bank. The ancient Greek inscription on the front frieze reads: \\"Blessed are those whom you (God) have chosen and have taken with you.\\" The nine gravestones have the inscriptions in Greek, English, or sometimes in both.Glimpses of the Greek Community from the Dhaka University: A follow-up, Helen Abadzi, World Bank June 27, 1996, p.7 Counter clockwise, the gravestone inscription reads: Gravestone 1 (Greek and English inscription) Here lies Sulatana, Wife of Alexander (son of) Kyinakos Philippou Politou: 1800; 25 January [by the julian calendar] paid the common debt in Dacca.

History In pre-Hispanic times up to the early 16th century, Vigan was a major commercial center in the region, trading directly with China. This commerce resulted to Chinese migration into the area with subsequent intermarriage between the native inhabitants and the Chinese immigrants. During the Spanish colonial period (1521-1898), Vigan became an important supplier of goods for the Manila- Acapulco galleon trade, which led to the rise of a new merchant class whose members are of mixed Chinese, native and Spanish ancestry - the Filipino mestizos. With their increasing affluence, they built their residential houses (bahay-na-bato) in the eastern district of the town, previously the Kasanglayan or old Chinese quarters.UNESCO World Heritage Centre (1998). \\"The Historic Town of Vigan, No 502rev. 30\\".
