Personal life  In the late 1980s, Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office confirmed that \\"Tatunca Nara\\" was born as G√ºnther Hauck in Coburg, Bavaria, and disappeared in the early 1960s due to financial difficulties. He left a wife and three children in Nuremberg. Nara denied that he is Hauck. According to Nara, Tatunca means \\"big water snake.\\" He lives in Barcelos, Amazonas on the Rio Negro. His Brazilian ID card lists him as an Indian.  Akakor, disappearances, and deaths  In the 1970s, German foreign correspondent Karl Brugger met \\"Tatunca Nara\\", who told him of the history of Akakor, an underground city below the rain forest. Brugger was convinced and wrote \\"The Chronicle of Akakor‚Äú, published in 1976. Still working as a jungle guide, Tatunca Nara led tourists and adventurers looking for pyramids and the underground city, but questions were raised after several of his clients went missing: American John Reed in 1980, Herbert Wanner of Switzerland in 1983, and Swede Christine Heuser in 1987. All disappeared in mysterious circumstances. In 1984, a skull was found by Swiss tourists which could be identified by forensic analysis as Herbert Wanner. In the same year, Brugger was shot and killed by an unknown assailant in the streets of Rio de Janeiro. The German Police believe Tatunca was behind the killing. In 1990, German adventurer R√ºdiger Nehberg and film producer Wolfgang Br√∂g tricked Tatunca into taking them on an expedition, during which his story began to unravel. The result was an hour-long documentary Das Geheimnis des Tatunca Nara (The Mystery of Tatunca Nara), shown on the ARD network in 1991. Nara stated, \\"I've killed many people, but I was a soldier and they were carrying weapons. I'm not innocent. But I didn't kill those three, as they've accused me of doing.\\" ReferencesBibliography * Karl Brugger/Tatunca Nara, the chronicle of Akakor.

Helvering, 290 U.S. 111 (1933), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court on the difference between business and personal expenses and the difference between ordinary business deductions and capital expenses. It is one of the most important income tax law cases. Background Thomas Welch and his father owned a grain brokerage business in Minnesota, which went bankrupt in 1922. Welch later reopened a business. He chose to repay his discharged debts. He then tried to deduct the repayments as business expenses, but the Commissioner ruled that these payments were not deductible from income as ordinary and necessary expenses in the course of business. Opinion of the Court Benjamin N. Cardozo, delivering the Court's opinion, held that the expenses were too personal, were too bizarre to be ordinary, and were capital. He did not consider them \\"ordinary and necessary business expenses\\" and, therefore, not deductible under Section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code. This case is frequently cited for its dictum describing the meaning of the term \\"necessary\\" in Section 162 as requiring that expenses merely be \\"appropriate and helpful [in] the development of the [taxpayer's] business.\\" Cardozo submits that determining what constitutes a necessary expense can be enormously difficult: \\"life in all its fullness must supply the answer to the riddle.\\" The court also considered the question of whether Welch's expenses were current expenses or investments which should have been capitalized. Although the case was eventually decided on other grounds, the idea that the expenses should have increased the basis of the business as capital expenses, with no immediate deduction but the potential for depreciation losses over time may also have influenced the court.

The Army of the North was defeated at the battle. As a result, the northern border of the Argentine territory collapsed and the provinces of Salta and Jujuy were invaded by the Spaniards. The government in Buenos Aires decided then to continue the fight for independence through the Pacific flank (present-day Chile), under the command of General San Mart√≠n, while Salta's caudillo Martin Miguel de Guemes led a guerrilla war to keep at bay the royalist army in the northern provinces. This campaign is retrospectively known as La Guerra Gaucha (\\"The Gaucho War\\") after a 1905 novel by Leopoldo Lugones. The royalist officers opposing him were Pedro Antonio de Ola√±eta, Juan Guillermo de Marquieguy, and Field Marshal Jos√© de la Serna.

It is written by John A. Russo with artwork by Dheeraj Verma.WWC XTRA: Picking the Brains of a ‚ÄúLiving Dead‚Äù Legend with Avatar Press, Comic Book Resources, August 13, 2007 Although the story is a sequel to Night of the Living Dead, it is not set in the continuity of George Romero‚Äôs series of films or Russo‚Äôs The Return of the Living Dead series. It was followed in 2006 by Escape of the Living Dead Fearbook and Escape of the Living Dead: Airborne, a three-issue miniseries, and Escape of the Living Dead Annual, published in 2007. Plot Set in 1971, 3 years after the events seen in Night of the Living Dead, the comic starts out with a raid by police officers led by Sheriff Harkness on a medical lab run by Dr. Melrose. During the raid the officers manage to shoot Dr. Melrose. Before he dies he reveals he had been experimenting on the zombies for a government funded project and tells the officers about his son who is taking over the project. Meanwhile, one of the main characters, Sally Brinkman, is talking to her father Henry. It is revealed Sally is staying with her parents whilst going through a divorce and is working for her father at the local saloon. Also, two robbers for the gang Sons of Satan attempt to rob a truck by pouring sugar in the gas tank, and then robbing its contents. When they look in the truck, they find it is full of zombies that proceed to attack and eat them. With the zombies released they start walking towards the town. The zombies eventually reach the Brinkman farm and kill Sally‚Äôs mother. The zombies then try to attack Sally, but she manages to avoid them and ride a horse to the saloon where her Dad works. However, zombies have also attacked the saloon as well; Henry attempts to fight the zombies off but hides in the saloon just as Sally appears. They both hide in the saloon and lock the doors. Meanwhile, the rest of the Sons of Satan gang attempt to meet up with the robbers from before, only to encounter them now as zombies. The three gang members, Bearcat, Slam, and Honeybear, kill the zombies before driving off. They eventually reach the saloon, where they are surrounded by zombies. Sally and Henry notice this and let them in. Eventually, the zombies start to break in, and the bikers attempt to escape, kidnapping Sally and stealing a truck in the process, leaving Henry to be eaten. During this, one of the bikers, Honeybear, is killed, while Henry manages to avoid the zombies and get a truck to chase after the bikers. Meanwhile, the two bikers and Sally have taken refuge in the nearby woods. Sally is now tied up when zombies attack the trio. Although they fight off the zombies, Slam is bitten and, in panic, kills Bearcat. He then forces Sally to take him to her house to help him. At this time, Sheriff Harkness discovers the truck that the zombies were originally transported in; he concludes this was the operation that Dr. Melrose mentioned. At this point Henry shows up, and helps Sheriff Harkness decide to get a posse together to kill the zombies. Back at Sally‚Äôs farm, Sally is forced to help Slam clean his wounds; she unsuccessfully tries to kill him with his knife and flees, but Slam chases after her as she runs into the basement. Slam then tries to kill her, but is killed by a hidden zombie. Sally runs outside to find her father and a posse killing the zombies. The posse then fight a horde of zombies, which attack them. Although outnumbered, the military show up and kill all the zombies. After the fight Sheriff Harkness gets a call on the radio, saying that the Dr. Melrose that they killed at the beginning did not match the dental records, and thus was an impostor. The last pages shows a lone zombie being captured by the real Dr. Melrose and his son, implying the zombie epidemic is far from over.

Although she is a polymer chemist by training, her research aims to understand the influence of chemical architecture on the conformation, properties, and interactions of nucleic acids. Education Olson received her bachelor's degree in Chemistry at the University of Delaware in 1967, with honors and distinction. During her studies, she received the A.C.S. (Delaware Section) Student Award. Olson obtained her Ph.D. in 1971 at Stanford University, where she studied the configurational statistics of polynucleotide chains. Her advisor was polymer scientist Paul J. Flory, who would win the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1974. Professional career Olson remained at the Flory group for a post doc research, after which she became a Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow with geneticist Charles R.

Rice (1896‚Äì1975) and his wife Ada L. Rice (1898‚Äì1977) were American business people, thoroughbred racehorse owners and breeders, and philanthropists. Dan Rice was educated in the public school system of Chicago, Illinois and spent two years at Depaul University and the University of Notre Dame. In 1919, he founded his own commodity brokerage, Daniel F. Rice and Company. His company became successful over the 35 years that he ran it. The company merged with Hayden, Stone & Co. in 1960. Rice later ran Rice Grain Corporation. Dan Rice and his wife, Ada, contributed to many charities and organizations and created the Rice Foundation which is still running today. The Rice Foundation gives contributions to places that the Rices believed in such as programs to prevent child abuse and for many research areas such as plant development and preservation, medical advancement and animal conservation. Additionally, the Foundation supports the arts such as the Chicago History Museum, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Lyric Opera of Chicago and other museums. Because the Rices were widely respected for their extensive philanthropies in the Chicago area, a number of places are named in their honor in the region. The combination of their first names formed Danada and appears in many places in Wheaton, Illinois. Thoroughbred racing In 1929 the Rices bought a farm located south of Wheaton which became named Danada Farm. Their house was located across from the farm and later was named Danada House which now is a museum and a place for social functions. It can house about 150 people for a party. Mrs. Rice was known to throw lavish parties at the house. Danada House is a 19-room estate that contains gardens, a greenhouse, a swimming pool, porch and atrium. Danada Farms had corn, wheat, sheep, hogs, cattle, chickens, turkeys and an apple orchard. Over the years the farm grew to over . The couple loved Thoroughbred horse racing and built a Kentucky-style stable that could hold 25 horses. A half-mile training track, which included a 4-position electronic starting gate, was built across the street from the stables. Later, a tunnel was built under Naperville Road for the horses to safely get to the stables. The track, starting gate, and tunnel still exist today. In 1946, they acquired a part of the Idle Hour Stock Farm near Lexington, Kentucky that was also given the Danada name. Mr. and Mrs. Rice bred horses on the farm, and raced them exclusively under her name. In 1965, one of their colts, Lucky Debonair, won the Kentucky Derby. Heavily involved in the sport of thoroughbred horse racing, Dan Rice was a member of the Board of Directors of Arlington Park Racetrack. In addition to the sport of horse racing, in the latter part of the 1940s Dan Rice was a shareholder in the Los Angeles Dons of the newly formed All-America Football Conference. Philanthropy In 1947, Dan Rice set up the Daniel F. and Ada L. Rice Foundation. In the next forty years, the foundation made $12.4 million in donations through 1,257 grants. As of 1988, the Rice Foundation had accumulated over $60 million. This money was donated to worthy causes such as endangered species, programs for abused children and medical research to support further advancement in areas such as rare illnesses and diseases. Dan and Ada Rice donated $10 million to the Art Institute of Chicago, $3 million to the Shedd Aquarium, $2 million to the Chicago History Museum (formerly known as the Chicago Historical Society), and $100,000 to the Boy Scouts of America for a camping facility for handicapped Scouts. Additionally, the Rice Foundation contributed to the Morton Arboretum to support the growth and research of elm trees and as a result a hybrid of an elm tree is named for them, the Danada Charm. Not only did the Rices donate money but they also donated land. They gave about for the Illinois Institute of Technology campus and to the Wheaton Park District for a water park and community center.

Swaminarayan Temple  Swaminarayan temple is situated at Nani Bhagol. This temple was built by Sadhu Balramdas whose guru Anandswami was one of the main saint of Swaminarayan and was his confidant Saint. Swaminarayan had told him of akhsar swarup of Gunatitanand swami. Sadhu Balramdas was looking for a tree to make main beam for Mandir. One local haribhakta suggested a good Mahudo tree in Barot's farm, which will be perfect for Mandir beam. When Barot did not give Mahudo, Balramdas said, \\"We will pray for the tree to Swaminarayan and you will be blessed with son, please give Mandir that tree.\\" Barot gave the tree and he had son which was known as Mahudio. Sadhu Balramdas installed murti of Swaminarayan on hindola with his two nephew, acharya of both Vadtal and Ahmedabad standing on side of hindola. There are names beside both acharya but no description of Swaminarayan. The murti is a fine painting with gold leaf and beautiful colours on board. This murti was given by last Kothari of temple Bhaktakishor Brahmbhatt in 2015 to his nephew Mahendra Barot when the temple was rebuilt with new murti.

Their range includes north-central Bulgaria and most of the Bulgarian part of Thrace, excluding the Rhodopes, the region of Haskovo and Strandzha. As a result of the mass population movements that affected eastern Bulgaria during the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, the Balkan dialects are now spoken also in vast areas of northeastern Bulgaria, especially the regions of Dobrich and Varna. The most significant feature of the dialects, as in most Eastern Bulgarian dialects, is the pronunciation of Old Church Slavonic —£ (yat) as or , depending on the character of the following syllable. The Balkan dialects, and in particular, the Central Balkan dialect, lie at the foundation of formal Bulgarian. However, they are not identical to the standard language because many of its features derive from the Western Bulgarian dialects, including the Macedonian dialects, or are a compromise between Eastern and Western standard.

The garden was constructed in 1992, in celebration of the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the sister city relationship between Naha and Fuzhou in China. The Kume neighborhood where the garden is located, previously known as Kumemura (Kume Village), was for centuries the center of Chinese culture and learning in the Ry≈´ky≈´ Kingdom, and a symbol of the significant role of Chinese cultural influence in Okinawan history and culture. The garden was built nearly entirely with the use of wood and stone from Fuzhou, with the help of artisans from Fuzhou, and according to specifications representative of traditional gardens in Fuzhou. It thus contains many of the elements essential to the design of a traditional Chinese garden. It is walled, divided into individual sections, features much asymmetry, rocks including scholar's rocks, and water in the form of a single pond which extends into most sections of the garden. Several bridges in a variety of styles extend over the pond, which houses koi and turtles, a symbol of longevity and wisdom in Chinese culture. The centerpiece of the garden perhaps is its waterfall, located on the west side of the pond, directly facing the east entrance. The rock pile it flows from contains an artificial cave, and can be entered, and climbed; stairs cut into the rock lead to a Chinese-style pavilion, one of two high points in the garden allowing for a view of much of the garden, and the surrounding scenery. The garden also has gates on the four cardinal directions, a number of six-sided pavilions, sculptures, bells, several inscriptions painted large on wood and stone, and in one building, a small exhibit of Chinese paintings and of a model of the style of ship that would have journeyed to Fuzhou during the time of the Ry≈´ky≈´ Kingdom to bring tribute and to engage in trade. The Chinese and Japanese concept \\"borrowing of scenery (\\"shakkei\\")\\" (ÂÄüÊôØ, C:jie jing, J:shakkei) is also used, adding to the sense of the garden's size. One element indicative of Okinawa, however, is seen in the plants and trees chosen for the garden. Trees such as Murraya paniculata, a relative of the orange and mikan, called gekkitsu (ÊúàÊ©ò) in Japanese, and Acacia confusa, called s≈çshiju (Áõ∏ÊÄùÊ®π) in Japanese, both native to the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, and parts of Southeast Asia, were chosen for their aesthetic qualities, particularly for their flowers, which allow the garden's appearance and atmosphere to change with the seasons in a particular way appropriate for a traditional Chinese garden. Access to the garden is open to the public; there is a small admission fee (adults 200¬•, child 100¬•). The garden is open from 9 AM to 6 PM and is closed on Wednesdays.

History The name is Spanish for \\"Country House,\\" and it was originally a retreat for Charles Bluhdorn, who built his estate in 1975 on Gulf+Western's sugar mill property, Central Romana. When he died in 1983, it became the first resort in the country.https://www.mansionglobal.com/articles/caribbean-seaside-resort-of- casa-de-campo-is-one-of-the-worlds-most-exclusive-209077 One of Bluhdorn's Dominican friends, Oscar de la Renta, was hired to do interior design for Casa De Campo. After Bluhdorn's death, the Cuban-American Fanjul family (the world's top sugar barons), bought Casa and opened it to paying guests. Golf course Golf architects Pete and Alice Dye have had a home at Casa de Campo since the early 1970s, when they guided 300 local laborers with machetes to blaze the Diente del Perro, (Teeth of the Dog, opened in 1971) through the jungle and along a rocky coast. The course served as a backdrop for the 1971 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. It remains the only Caribbean course consistently in the world's top 100 courses (usually top 50). The Links Course (opened in 1974) and the members-only La Romana Country Club (opened in 1990) are inland layouts spiced with lakes. Dye's newest course, the much-acclaimed Dye Fore (opened in 2000), skirts cliffs above the Chav√≥n River, with views of the village of Altos de Chav√≥n, distant mountains and the new marina. Dye recently completed another course on the plateau next to Dye Fore, called the Dye Fore Lakes. Villas and marina There are two types of villas that can be owned: \\"punto de villas\\" own only the land, with parking lots and landscaped spaces as common areas. \\"Villas con solar proprio\\" have ownership of an entire area, which includes parking lots and the landscape. About 10% of the residences at the resort are low-rise condos in buildings no higher than four levels. About 70% of the properties are large estates. Casa de Campo has over 1,700 private villas, which range in price from US$500,000 to US$24,000,000, making it also one of the countries' most affluent communities, comparable to the Hamptons. Completed in 2000, Casa de Campo has a modern, 400-berth marina, complete with a shipyard with a 120-ton TraveLift designed by Italian architect, Gian Franco Fini to resemble Portofino. Surrounding this harbor are over 70 restaurants, shops, bars, and homes. In 2010, the Casa de Campo Marina played host to the Rolex Farr 40 sailing cup.

It can range in size from 2 to 4 feet and can be held with one or both hands, delivering a deep, meat cleaver-like cut. In its heyday, it was used as a combat weapon, as an execution tool, and as a display of power. Occasional use as an agricultural and butchering tool has also been noted. The sword's name is a shortening of the word \\"pang-tabas\\", which means \\"chopping tool\\".

At 2 to 4 feet, it is among the largest of Filipino swords, with only some Kampilan specimens being longer. The forward-curved shape of its blade makes it unique not only in terms of its appearance, but in terms of handling as well. In terms of shape, similarities have been noted between the panabas and the Nepalese kukri knife, although the kukri is much smaller. Its hilt is perhaps the longest among Filipino swords, both in terms of overall length, and in terms of proportion relative to the blade. Blade Seen from the side, the panabas's laminated steel blade is single- edged, is narrowest near the hilt, and gets dramatically thicker near the tip, where the edge side of the weapon curves forward. Because the panabas is primarily used in a chopping rather than thrusting motion, the shape of the actual tip varies greatly, with some specimens coming to a blunt tip, some pointed in the manner of other Filipino swords such as the Dahong Palay, and some taking on a square or diamond shape, with the furthest tip of the diamond, on the blunt back of the sword, serving as an elementary spike. There are rare panabas specimens that have an 'S'-shaped blade sharpened partially along the backside, such that the specimen is double edged at the tip. While design work on the panabas's blade is relatively rare, among the most common examples of decorative design elements take the form of talismanic 'X' along the spine. Observed cross-sectionally, the blade is also thicker at its base, with a typical example being about thick - so designed in order to withstand the massive forces that the panabas both deals out and absorbs with every blow. Hilt The panabas' hilt, made of hardwood such as narra and often wrapped in braided rattan, is perhaps the longest among Filipino swords, both in terms of overall length, and in terms of proportion relative to the blade. The hilts of some specimens are wrapped in metal bands rather than rattan. Scabbard Panabas scabbards were made of plain wood and are now extremely rare - according to accounts, largely because warriors would frequently discard them prior to a battle. Such scabbards invariably consist of two pieces of wood which are taken apart to remove the sword, as opposed to the sheath-type scabbards used by most other swords. The weapons are also said to have been carried into battle wrapped in cloth and slung across the back. Usage=Weapon While the panabas is now rare and there are thus no contemporary cases of its use in battle, stories from and prior to the American colonial era describe it as being used for mop-up operations. It is said that warriors wielding panabas would form a rear guard and, following in the steps of warriors in front, use the panabas to quickly dispatch any survivors. In terms of its function as a weapon, similarities have been noted between the panabas and the western battle-axe. Execution tool Yakan panabas Because of its effectiveness at chopping through meat, panabas was known favored for use in executions. As such, the panabas also came to symbolize a datu's power - a demonstration of his ability to control violence. Domestic use The function of the panabas is that of a large cleaver, and this shapes the domestic use of the panabas as much as it shapes the martial use. The noted use of the panabas as an execution tool sprang from its initial domestic use for cleaving meat and fish, easily chopping through the large tuna that are caught in the seas of the Southern Philippines. However, its main domestic use is that of clearing unusually dense vegetation. Karit Used as a broader term, the word panabas means \\"a chopper\\" - a description which would include the many machete-like sword variants in the Philippines, including the sickle. In portions of the Philippines where the panabas is not used, the term panabas is used to refer to the sickle, whose proper name is \\"karit.\\" It should thus be noted that the panabas and the karit are completely different tools. A weaponized version of the agricultural scythe would be the Indonesian kerambit.

Youth exclusion is a form of social exclusion in which youth are at a social disadvantage in joining institutions and organizations in their societies. Troubled economies, lack of governmental programs, and barriers to education are examples of dysfunctions within social institutions that contribute to youth exclusion by making it more difficult for youth to transition into adulthood. European governments have recently recognized these shortcomings in societies organizational structures and have begun to re- examine policies regarding social exclusion.Ambrosio, Conchita D. and Carlos Grad√≠n. 2003. \\"Income Distribution and Social Exclusion of Children: Evidence from Italy and Spain in the 1990s*.\\" Journal of Comparative Family Studies 34(3):479-XII Many policies dealing with social exclusion are targeted at youth since this demographic of people face a transition into adulthood; defining career and lifestyle choices that will affect the future culture and structure of a society. Youth exclusion is multi-dimensional in that age, race, gender, class and lifestyle all affect youth life experiences within a given culture. This intersectionality affects the degree to which an individual youth experiences exclusion. Similarly, youth exclusion is context specific. This means that youth are excluded from society in different ways depending on their cultural and spatial locations. A simple difference between the opportunities and resources provided in one neighborhood can create a divide among youth who are included and youth who are excluded from their communities. Another consideration is that youth exclusion is relational insofar as social exclusion contains two parties, the excluders and the excluded. Pertaining to youth exclusion, the excluders are often older generations who believe that the economic support services and institutions that help the youth puts their own comfortable standard of living at risk. All of these demographic, cultural, spatial and relational factors contribute to the worldwide experiences of youth exclusion. Roots of youth exclusion Youth exclusion can be examined by dividing its causes into social and cultural factors. Structural reasons for exclusion include inequalities in power as seen by the inequalities generated in the normal functions of the housing and labor markets. Prolonged unemployment and low income can affect a person's ability to have access to social structures that advance a person in society by opening doors to new opportunities and creating a sense of society acceptance and inclusion.Hunter, Boyd and Kirrily Jordan. 2010. \\"Explaining Social Exclusion: Towards Social Inclusion for Indigenous Australians.\\" Australian Journal of Social Issues 45(2):243-265,153 Also on a structural level, youth are excluded from broader society through barriers to education and discriminatory government policies. Cultural factors affecting youth exclusion include reactions to socially constructed categories like race and gender. These classifications can also influence an individual's choice to be excluded from society. Some academics argue that youth are marginalized because they choose to separate themselves from mainstream society, opting instead to participate in alternative lifestyles and subcultures. Others, however, view this choice as a \\"forced choice\\", motivated by the fear of racial, gender and other types of discrimination. McDonald presents the example of a young black man in the UK who chooses not to go to university because \\"he fears discrimination as a university student\\". McDonald says, \\"This is a negative externality imposed by the socially included that is influencing the choice of the young black man in the direction of social exclusion\\".McDonald, Ian M. 2010. \\"Economic Perspectives on Social Exclusion.\\" Australian Journal of Social Issues 45(2):213-225,153 In this example both structural and cultural barriers influenced this student so he felt excluded from society; he felt pressure from society to remain on the periphery, and in doing so denying himself access to an education. In this situation education failed as an established social structure to provide this individual with inclusion into society. Poverty Poverty is one of the largest factors that contributes to the perpetuation of youth exclusion. Poverty is an isolating state that affects people's social connections and ability to contribute in culturally specific activities that build communities. As the sociologist Peter Townshend explains; > \\"Individuals, families and groups can be said to be in poverty when‚Ä¶their > resources are so seriously below those commanded by the average individual > or family that they are, in effect, excluded from ordinary living patterns, > customs and activities\\"Levitas, R. (2006) \\"The concept and measurement of > social exclusion\\" , In C. Pantazis, D. Gordon and R. Levitas (eds.) Poverty > and Social Exclusion in Britain: The Millennium Survey, Bristol, Policy > Press. Indeed, poverty can impair a person's ability to participate in politics, housing and labor markets, secondary education and pop culture related activities. These activities from which those in poverty are excluded can affect a youth's social networking opportunities and thus the future state of their inclusion or exclusion in society.  Regional youth exclusion  Given that the definition of youth exclusion varies across cultures, the concept must include an analysis of what it means to be a member of a given society, for example, \\"analysis of what it means to be Egyptian, Moroccan, Iranian, or Syrian, to be a Muslim, an Arab, and so on‚Äù. Within a country, neighborhoods or states can be divided in such a way that even different youth within a culture can experience exclusion on different levels. Globalization creates comparative exclusions across societies. \\"Globalization has given the division of labour a strong international dimension, one that strongly favors the West over Africa. Also it has reduced the economic strength of African states and placed the control of their economies in the hands of multinational groups with primary allegiance to their mother countries in Europe and America\\". Thus, young individuals entering the job market in the Global South are impacted by the actions of countries in the Global North. Middle East and North Africa (MENA) In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), youth exclusion has several dimensions. As in other regions, youth unemployment is high, with a regional average of 25% unemployment among 15- to 24-year- olds,Navtej Dhillon & Tarik Yousef, ‚ÄúInclusion: Meeting the 100 Million Youth Challenge,‚Äù Middle East Youth Initiative, 2007 which reaches as high as 37% in Morocco and up to 73% in Syria. There is also a significant level of labor market segmentation related to economic restructuring and insider-outsider issues; > ‚ÄúOrganized insiders with seniority benefit from rents ‚Äì higher wages, better > benefits, and greater tenure ‚Äì by monopolizing jobs and restricting access > to particular sectors. Outsiders, such as youth and new labor market > entrants, suffer from longer unemployment durations, skill atrophy, and > declining health, as well as the social dimensions of exclusion from work.‚Äù Additionally, youth exclusion in MENA is exacerbated by gender, whether due to child-rearing needs and expectations, sex segregation, parental supervision, or other cultural or religious reasons. For example, compared to 63% of economically active 15- to 24-year-old males, only 22% of females from the same age group were economically active in Egypt in 2006.Ragui Assaad & Ghada Barsoum, ‚ÄúYouth Exclusion in Egypt: In Search of Second Chances,‚Äù Middle East Youth Initiative Working Paper (September 2007) As a result of youth unemployment, young people have a tendency of extending their education and delaying marriage and family formation. Like Europe, MENA has seen its youth delay leaving the home, getting married, and beginning families. Consequences of youth exclusion in MENA have included young people entering waithood, a period during which they simply wait for their lives to begin, most notably by queuing for long periods of unemployment during which they live with parents and are financially unable to pursue marriage or home ownership. While delayed marriage is a trend seen in many societies, adaptations vary, such that it is normal in the United States and Europe for young unmarried couples to cohabitate, while in MENA such an arrangement is unacceptable. Instead, an increasing number of youths are engaging in nikah urfi, temporary marriages,Diane Singerman, ‚ÄúThe Economic Imperative of Marriage: Emerging Practices and Identities among Youth in the Middle East,‚Äù Middle East Youth Initiative Working Paper (September 2007) which offer little security to the wife and any subsequent offspring. The psychological impact is also considerable, with unemployment leading to depression and social isolation, often with physical manifestations. There is considerable concern in the international community that these isolated youths are marketed to by extremist groups such as al-Qaeda, who prey upon their sense of social exclusion and hopelessness. India Lack of employment in India has caused the exclusion, especially of young men, from society. Despite prolonged higher education, young men are unable to find work. The government's withdrawal from public education funding has been instrumental in perpetuating youth exclusion in India. The youths' reaction has been to join informal groups of other young men who congregate on street corners or in teahouses to pass the time. These groups feel a sense of helplessness in their inability to join society in a productive manner. The poor economy and lack of jobs in this case are the causes of exclusion among the younger generation, creating the social phenomena labeled as \\"timepass\\".Jeffrey, Craig (2010) Timepass: Youth, Class, and the Politics of Waiting in India, Stanford, Stanford University Press, 2010. This exclusion affects young men's transitions to adulthood by making it difficult for men to marry, find housing and meet cultural gender norms of masculinity. There is also a gendered element to youth exclusion in India. Young women were barred from participating in the teahouse discussions and informal meetings that young males hold in order to cope with exclusion. This segregation is influenced by previously established gender roles that have been shaped by culture. Nigeria The Federal Government of Nigeria explains the youth generation as a group \\"who is passing through mental and physical developmental process in preparation to face the challenges of adulthood\\". This definition encompasses a wide range of young people in Nigeria who have had to cope with the struggle of political uncertainty. In addition to government unrest, Nigerian youth have faced barriers to education. When these youth are excluded and barred from future success through unstable political and educational environments, they use violence to protest against society and facilitate a movement for social inclusion. Oftentimes this violence is directed at the government. Research done on Nigerian youth shows that; > \\"The collapse of social services and the high level commercialization of > education have barred many young people from formal education. Thus, the > unemployed youths without university education and the numerous graduates > who lack prospects for employment have been able to develop a volatile > strategy of identity transformation both at the level of consciousness and > their attempt to find a space in the new political dispensation. Violence > has been a common feature of this coping mechanism\\" In Nigeria political and social exclusion occurs when people in positions of power withhold resources or knowledge from the society, directly hurting the youth population which is the most economically insecure and lacking in networks that could help facilitate a successful transition to adulthood. Violence thus becomes a tool for social change. Canada Exclusion among youth in Canada has led to problems of increased homelessness and instability among the youth population. Stephen Gaetz demonstrates a unique situation arising among Canadian youth in which they face stigmatization by their society; > \\"For young people who become homeless, social exclusion is experienced > across several domains: in terms of access to shelter and housing, > employment, and a healthy lifestyle, for instance. It is also manifest in > their restricted access to (and movement with within) urban spaces and their > limited social capital\\". Lacking access to certain social organizations and networks has not only excluded youth, but has created a stigma in which society views homeless youth in Canada as criminals. This criminalization is greater among youth because it is known that young people are facing transitions in which riskier behavior may be involved. Government officials are debating policy issues especially in law enforcement in order to prevent this criminalization and perpetuation of exclusion among youth. Costs of exclusion to society The costs of youth exclusion can be measured in terms of its multi-dimensional nature. This includes how the intersection of race, gender, class and social location affect youth's ability to access employment, education or other social networks that are imperative to their transition to adulthood. Exclusion can preserve negative prejudices or stereotypes within a culture. Urban youth in America face greater prejudice in environments in which ethnic minorities face minimal intergroup contact in peer settings like school. Gendered differences continue to be problematic in this situation as well. Girls prove to be more sensitive to recognizing racial exclusion among their peers since they also face gender discrimination in school settings. Cultural norms associated with gender play a pivotal role in the perpetuation of the division between excluders and the excluded, creating unequal opportunities among youth. Barriers to social organizations and opportunities can result in unwanted consequences including crime and violence. There are many examples in which youth have formed groups that oppose oppressive and exclusionary governments through violent demonstrations, especially among African nations. These violent reactions also lead to concerns about youth politics, youth identity and the future well-being of nations facing this type of conflict with their youth populations. Indian youth experiencing \\"timepass\\" also show signs of increased aggression. Specifically this aggression has been directed towards women, since young men feel powerless in their current state of unemployment. Remedies for youth exclusion Sociologist Ruth Levitas created three sociological interpretations used to examine ways in which societies can remedy social exclusion. These tactics affect youth because they deal with the labor market and thus young people just beginning to gain financial independence. The redistributionist discourse (RED) sees poverty as the greatest contributor to social exclusion. This understanding focuses on transferring taxes and welfare to those in need. The moral underclass discourse (MUD) interpretation blames individual choice for causing social exclusion. This method suggests punishment as a means of remedying social exclusion. The last method, social integrationist discourse (SID), views the labor market as the enemy to social exclusion and therefore explores avenues for getting more people into the labor force. Other ways to decrease youth exclusion include increased intergroup contact between the differing social positions of the excluders and the excluded. Benefits of inclusion have indeed been measured by sociologists. One such experiment researched elementary aged children to record their personal views on prejudice and social exclusion. The researchers found, \\"In the present investigation, in accord with prior research (e.g., Crystal et al. 2008; Killen et al. 2007b), ethnic minority students reporting high levels of intergroup contact were more likely to rate race-based exclusion as wrong than were students with low levels of intergroup contact\\". Integration of peer groups helps lessen xenophobic reactions to others and fosters inclusion among all members of a society. This realization is helpful to educators who want to create inclusive environments so that youth will feel secure in their learning environments.

It has been called \\"one of the city's best-kept secrets\\". It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Establishment of the rose garden From 1871 to 1911, the site of the rose garden was part of the city's Agricultural Park. The rose garden area was then used for horse, camel, dog, and later automobile racing; it also reportedly housed the city's longest bar and \\"one of its most stylish brothels.\\" In 1914, the city announced plans to construct a wildflower garden at the park, but the rose garden was not built until 1927 with the planting of 15,000 bushes of more than 100 varieties. When the garden was announced, the Los Angeles Times applauded the project: \\"No more fitting tribute could be paid to the spirit of Southern California than to erect in the center of her largest city the greatest rose garden in the world.\\" During the Great Depression, the lack of funding threatened the closure of the rose garden, then described as \\"the largest rose garden in the world.\\" Boldsen statues In 1936, four large marble statues by Danish sculptor Thyra Boldsen were installed on pedestals at the four corners of the garden. The statues were titled \\"Nymph Finding Pipes of Pan,\\" \\"The Blessing\\" (dedicated to the mothers of the world), \\"The Start\\" (awarded first prize by the Danish Academy of Fine Arts), and \\"Terpsichore\\" (or \\"Melody of Life\\"). The sculptor explained her intent with the statues this way: \\"In conceiving and executing these four figures dedicated to womanhood and motherhood, I have had in mind that men for centuries have erected statues symbolizing bravery‚Äîthese symbolize love, life and joy.\\" Popularity of the Rose Garden Rose garden in May 2008 In the 1950s, the annual pruning demonstration drew thousands of rose enthusiasts to the park. By the mid-1980s, the garden had more than 20,000 rose bushes and more than 200 varieties of roses. The All-America Rose Selection, a rose growers organization, began donating its Rose of the Year to the garden in 1940. The garden is reportedly visited by more than a million people a year and is a popular location for weddings, reflection, and other events. The garden also has four gazebos, several statues, and a central fountain. The garden is located adjacent to the University of Southern California campus, the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, and the California Science Center. Threat to the Rose Garden and historic designation In 1986, plans to dig up the garden to build an underground parking garage led to protests in the media. The Los Angeles Times ran an editorial opposing the plan: \\"There are times when the leaders of Los Angeles seem perversely intent on living up to the image that many outsiders have of them‚Äîinsensitive and uncouth rabbits who would, say, dig up a garden to put in a parking lot.\\" The garden had also been threatened by an earlier proposal by the Los Angeles Raiders football team to convert the garden into a practice field for the team. In order to protect the garden from such threats, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Film and television The exterior of the Old Armory Building, abutting the eastern edge of the Rose Garden, is used in establishing shots of the fictional Jeffersonian Institute, in the TV series Bones. The gardens were used also for The TV show ‚ÄúBuffy The Vampire Slayer‚Äù in the Season two episode ‚ÄúInca Mummy Girl‚Äù.

Background He was bred by owners Dan and Ada Rice of Wheaton, Illinois at their Danada Farm satellite operation on Old Frankfort Pike near Lexington, Kentucky, a property that once was part of the Idle Hour Stock Farm. Lucky Debonair was sired by Vertex out of the mare Fresh as Fresh, who was a daughter of the 1943 U.S. Triple Crown Champion Count Fleet. He was conditioned for racing by trainer Frank Catrone, Racing career As a two-year-old in 1964, Lucky Debonair made one start at the Atlantic City Race Course, where he finished out of the money. Sent to race in California at age three, the unheralded colt was ridden by Bill Shoemaker. He finished second in the San Felipe Stakes and won the San Vicente Handicap, both at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia. He was a supplementary entrant in the West Coast's most important race for three-year-olds, the Santa Anita Derby. Under Shoemaker, Lucky Debonair won the race by four lengths and set a new stakes record of 1:47.00, a time that as of 2008 has been equaled but not broken. He followed this victory with another very important win in the Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland Race Course and was made the second choice among bettors for the Kentucky Derby. Lucky Debonair gave Shoemaker his third Derby win by defeating ten other top three-year-olds, including the heavily favored American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt of 1964 Bold Lad (10th), the brilliantly fast Ogden Phipps colt Dapper Dan (2nd), future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Tom Rolfe (3rd), and Hail To All (5th). In the second leg of the Triple Crown, the Preakness Stakes, a bruised ankle that almost caused him to be withdrawn from the race contributed to Lucky Debonair finishing seventh. The colt did not run in the Belmont Stakes. Lucky Debonair returned to racing at age four in 1966. He won three of five starts, including a win over Native Diver in California's prestigious Santa Anita Handicap. Stud record Retired to stud duty at the Rices' farm in Kentucky, before being sent to Venezuela in 1976 when the then-widowed Ada Rice disbanded her racing stable. He produced fifteen stakes winners including the Irish Derby winner Malacate. Lucky Debonair died of old age in 1987 at age twenty-five. On May 4, 2002, the city of Wheaton, Illinois honored him with a plaque and memorial rock at the Danada Equestrian Center.

Limb bud is undifferentiated mesenchyme enclosed by an ectoderm covering. Eventually, the limb bud develops into bones, tendons, muscles and joints. Limb bud development relies not only on the ZPA, but also many different genes, signals, and a unique region of ectoderm called the apical ectodermal ridge (AER). Research by Saunders and Gasseling in 1948 identified the AER and its subsequent involvement in proximal distal outgrowth. Twenty years later, the same group did transplantation studies in chick limb bud and identified the ZPA. It wasn't until 1993 that Todt and Fallon showed that the AER and ZPA are dependent on each other.  Patterning Patterning along the limb bud requires signals from many sources. Specifically, proteins called transcription factors (TF) help control the rate at which a gene is transcribed. The limb bud expresses a TF called ALX4 at the anterior part of the mesoderm, with the TF HOXB8 being expressed at the posterior portion. The Alx4 region, the medial region, and the Hox8 expressing area meet at a proximal area where the AER develops. The ZPA forms where the Hox8 region joins the AER. 250px These regions are dependent on signaling in order for the appropriate induction events to occur. The AER expresses FGF8 which induces Shh expression in the posterior mesoderm. Shh then stimulates FGF4 to be expressed in the posterior part of the AER. After these events, there is a co-dependence between FGF-4 and Shh for their subsequent expression and maintenance. Additionally, Wnt7a is expressed in the dorsal ectoderm, is needed to maintain the FGF and Shh signaling. 330px  Apical ectodermal ridge Saunders and Gasseling published data in the Journal of Experimental Biology in 1948, showing that reference marks inserted near the rim of the apical border of the wing bud are dispersed throughout the whole forearm of the wing. This led them to believe that the apical ectoderm may play a role in forming parts of the wing. To test this, they removed apical ectoderm from wing buds which yielded deformed wings. When they removed dorsal ectoderm, normal wings formed. These results showed that the cells of the apical ectoderm have a precise fate to form specific regions of the wing. 550px  Sonic hedgehog ZPA mouse, right forelimb In 1968, Saunders and Gasseling did transplantation studies using tissue from chick limb bud. Removing cells from the posterior region of the limb, they transplanted them to the anterior region and noticed that extra digits formed in the anterior area and these digits were mirror images to the normal ones. This posterior mesenchyme was the ZPA, which is now known to express the protein sonic hedgehog (Shh). One hypothesis is that at high concentrations, this unknown morphogen causes mesenchyme to form on the posterior side, while low concentrations induces meshenchyme to form on the anterior end. Identifying this morphogen was the next crucial step. The first hypothesis came from Tickle et al. who showed that when retinoic acid is placed in the anterior margin of the limb bud, mirror image duplications result. However, concentrations of retinoic acid that cause mirror image duplications induce high levels of a downstream gene, retinoic acid receptor Beta, which is not seen in the posterior region. It is now known that endogenous retinoic acid acts permissively prior to limb bud initiation to allow the budding process to begin, and that the specific morphogen, hypothesized to be Shh, is normally expressed independently of retinoic acid in the posterior region of the limb bud. By looking at signaling homologs of other organisms, the segmentation gene of Drosophila, hedgehog, served as a viable candidate. The idea that Shh is required for proper ZPA signaling and anterior/posterior limb formation needed to be tested. Riddle et al. took Saunders and Gasselings findings to the next step and proved that Shh is the morphogen within the ZPA that is required for anterior posterior patterning. By isolating the Shh gene and implanting it into the anterior limb bud, mirror image digit duplications formed. Isolation was conducted by designing PCR primers that correspond to sequences of Shh that are conserved in Drosophila and mouse and involved in limb bud formation. The clone was then used as a template to screen a cDNA library from stage 22 limb bud RNA. The group ectopically expressed the gene by taking advantage of a retroviral vector to insert the cDNA into chick cells. There are unique types of this retroviral vector that only infect specific strains of avian species. Therefore, this group used a retroviral vector termed RCAS-E, which lacks a type E envelope protein, and is able to infect certain chick embryo fibroblasts with Shh. 650px Results showed digit duplications, with the most common being 4-3-3-4, with digit 2 missing. Though there was variability, it was clearly consistent with anterior to posterior positional patterning. Variations were due to the amount of tissue grafted, and the location of the graft. These findings indicate that Shh could substitute for the function of the ZPA. Thus Shh is sufficient for ZPA action. Mediators Shh may be a critical signal regulating ZPA function, but the genes involved in Shh signaling are under the control of several other factors that are needed for ZPA maintenance and function including Hand2 and Hoxb-8. Retinoic acid, an important signaling molecule needed throughout embryogenesis, acts through the Hox genes. It was originally postulated that retinoic acid acts to induce the Hoxb-8 gene, but this hypothesis has not been supported by genetic studies in mouse embryos lacking retinoic acid synthesis that still express Hoxb-8 in the limb. Hoxb-8 signaling is active in the early embryo, beginning at the posterior end of the lateral plate mesoderm and extending to the anterior region. As Hoxb-8 spreads to more anterior regions, Shh is induced in the area that will become the ZPA. Shh is only induced in the anterior region because of signals from the AER. Experiments done by Heikinheimo et al. show that when the AER is removed, beads that express FGF are sufficient to induce Shh signaling in the ZPA. Thus, the likely signaling factor from the AER is FGF. 600px Additionally when the AER is removed, Shh is no longer expressed, and the ZPA can no longer be maintained. Acting in a positive feedback mechanism, FGF-4 is expressed near the ZPA. FGF-4 acts to maintain Shh expression, while Shh acts to maintain FGF-4 expression. At the same time, Wnt-7a is expressed in the dorsal ectoderm, and provides further positive feedback to FGF-4 and Shh. Without this system, limbs and digits are either significantly reduced or missing. Downstream signals The downstream targets that are activated in response to Shh pose another challenge. Genes that are targets of Shh signaling encode factors that lead to the formation of the autopod, stylopod and zeugopod. 500px Activation of Gli zinc-finger transcription factors occurs through the Hedgehog signaling pathway. There are three Gli factors that are essential for limb development: Gli1, Gli2 and Gli3. Without Shh, Gli2 and Gli3 are processed to a repressor form and travel to the nucleus to repress the Shh response. But when Shh is present, unprocessed Gli2 and Gli3 are able to pass into the nucleus and stimulate expression of Shh target genes, including Gli1. Studies in mice show that Gli3 knockouts have polydactyly digits. Fundamentally, Shh acts to remove repression of Gli3. When Shh diffuses from the ZPA, it predominates in the posterior region of the limb bud, activating Gli3 in the posterior region, while the repressor is still active in the anterior region. This leads to activation of other genes such as Hox genes, FGF genes and BMP genes in the posterior region, setting up digit patterning. BMP, plays a role in limb morphology, specifically, digit positioning, but the specific regulation of BMP is unclear. 550px In particular, the Hox genes A and D are likely to be controlled by Shh within the ZPA. Three phases of activation of the Hox genes results in patterning of the limb parallel to the expression of the Hox genes in a nested pattern. Activation of these genes results in a new limb axis that ultimately results in digit development, possibly interpreting gene expression to assign digit identity. Overall, the molecular ZPA requires input for several signaling centers, but acts as an organizer itself, inducing anterior-posterior pattering of the chick limb bud.

Origins In 1877 Redbrooke College for young ladies was founded at Redbrooke House on Camborne Hill. There were about 20 boarders and also day girls. There were three teachers at first and later a Miss Chudleigh came from Liskeard to be headmistress until 1896 when Miss Kay took charge. In 1897 Miss Pratt of Girton College, Cambridge took over the role. With the 1904 Education Act, state secondary education was planned for a limited number of pupils. Redbrooke College became Redbrooke County School and the number of pupils increased so that it was necessary to transfer to a new larger building at the bottom of Camborne Hill, (Trevu Road). History The new premises were officially opened in 1908 as Camborne Grammar School and were built to accommodate pupils from the Camborne-Redruth area, extending from Gwithian in the west to St. Agnes in the east and south to villages such as St Day and Troon. (Boys from this same area attended Redruth Grammar School). The first headmistress of Camborne Grammar School was Miss Pratt and up until the 1930s the number of pupils increased. In 1933 Miss Evans became headmistress and during the depression years the numbers attending the school decreased. In 1935 Mr C.V.Thomas, chairman of the governors presented the school with a new gym and Camborne was the first grammar school in Cornwall to have a purpose built gym.Camborne Grammar School magazine During the Second World War the pupils and staff of Paddington and Maida Vale school shared the premises for some time and at this time biology was the only science subject taught due to lack of staff. Even after the war there was still rationing of food and school dinners and milk were said to be welcome. With the Education Act 1944 the kindergarten and preparatory department were closed and there were no more fee payers in the school. Also in 1944 the Eleven plus exam scheme for entry to the Grammar school was introduced. In 1947 Miss Evans retired and Miss Bain from Edinburgh University became headmistress. In the 1950s the school premises became too small for the greater number of pupils and in 1954 a new block was built in the school grounds. Miss Bain left in 1967 when Mrs. Bannister became headmistress until 1971 when numbers had increased by 33%. Mrs Mostyn took over in 1971 when it became necessary to look elsewhere for extra classrooms. The first outpost was the nearby St. Johns Catholic School and the second outpost was the Camborne Community Centre. In 1975 the sixth form was moved to a new centre at Treswithian School (later renamed to Camborne Science and International Academy) and, due to the introduction of the comprehensive system, at the end of the 1976 summer term the rest of the school followed to this site. Later history The school building later became home to the Basset Junior School under headmaster Mr Treneer and, from 1980, also the site of Beacon Infants School, under headmistress Mrs Gratton-Kane. These later became merged and renamed Trevithick County Primary until 1997, in which the school moved to a new building further down the road. Following this, the school premises became the Trevu Children's Centre' for pre-school children and early learning which provided a toy library, various health services, a nursery and cr√®che, a cafe, and access to training and development for parents and carers. Trevu Children's Centre In June 2009 Cornwall County Council put the building up for sale as a site for development. Not only does this mean that Children's services and facilities closed, but potentially the building could have been demolished to redevelop the site. Local parents have formed a campaign group to try to force the Council to reconsider their actions. Save Camborne Children's Centre Zoe Fox, spokesperson for Cornish political party Mebyon Kernow and local campaigner, condemned the proposed closure of the Children's Centre at Trevu in Camborne. She said, ‚ÄúIt is a scandal that Trevu Childrens‚Äô Centre is under threat and the building is scheduled to be sold off for soulless residential redevelopment. The facilities at Trevu are first class and incredibly well used. The proposed dispersal of these services will impact badly on many families. The Centre gives heart to our community and is the best possible use of our heritage. It gives local people the chance to enjoy a beautiful old building with services available on one site including a sensory playground, cafe, toy library, day care and after school clubs catering from nursery to teens as well as support for families. It is a community hub and a valuable resource particularly for isolated young families. Just because the site is valuable is not a reason to sell it off and disperse the services.\\" As part of the Government's Free School programme, the building was once again bought back into use as a school. Following refurbishment and a ¬£3.5million extension, St Michael's Secondary School opened on the site. Following a disappointing Ofsted inspection, it was announced by the Department for Education and the school's governors that the sponsorship of St. Michael's School would transfer to the Camborne Science and International Academy whilst remaining as a separate school. It was confirmed that the Catholic ethos of the school would be continued, but that the school would no longer continue with as a designation Catholic school.

From the word twiddly (sometimes spelled Twiddley); curly or decorative, esp. in an unnecessary way Cambridge International Dictionary of English; Cambridge University Press, 1995, p.1573. and bit; a small piece or amount of something, a twiddly bit is anything that is relatively small and trifling or elaborately decorative. Twiddly is a commonly used word in British English, as in Roald Dahl‚Äôs The BFG, where the giant‚Äôs large ears allow him to hear absolutely every single twiddly little thing.The BFG; Roald Dahl, Puffin Books, 1982, pp. 43, 51. The term twiddly bit is applicable in almost any context and is commonly used to describe aspects of architecture, art, music, literature, fashion, etc. Music The term \\"Twiddly Bits\\" is commonly used in the music industry to describe a short improvised part that is technically advanced and/or musically interesting.Guerilla Guide to the Music Business, 2nd edition; Sarah Davis and Dave Laing, Continuum International Publishing Group Inc., 2006, p.145.Bass Heroes; Tom Mulhern, GPI Books, 1993, p.139.Genesis: Chapter and Verse; Banks, Collins, Gabriel, Hackett, Rutherford, Edited by Philip Dodd, Thomas Dunne Books, 2007, p.QQQ. In music, a Twiddly Bit is similar to a solo though it is typically shorter and lacks the structure typical of a solo, that is to say a beginning, middle and end. Rather it is short and sweet and can serve to fill space, act as a turnaround between parts, or as a substitute for a solo where a musician wants to show off but time does not allow for a full solo. There is also a Victorian era parlour song called \\"Twiddley Bits\\" recorded by Sheila Steafel on the album Victoria Plums. It is about a woman taking music lessons. MIDI Library Twiddly.Bits is a brand of MIDI phrases developed in 1993 by Keyfax, a company co-founded by keyboardist Julian Colbeck and Dave Spiers; the name suggested by fellow British prog rock keyboardist, Dave Stewart. Twiddly.Bits MIDI phrases derive their name from the slang, as they are literally short, 1-to-2-measure, technically advanced performances from professional studio musicians recorded as MIDI.Twiddly.Bits The Twiddly.Bits MIDI library brand was originally conceived to make available to musicians and composers musical MIDI loops that could not be played on a standard MIDI keyboard controller due to the limitations of keyboards in duplicating instrument-specific nuances and timbres, such as a trill from a saxophone or a dynamic drum roll. The parts were recorded using the appropriate MIDI controller so these nuances and characteristics specific to the particular instrument in question would come through, making them the most authentic and realistic-sounding MIDI phrases available. They were the first of the MIDI loop brands and are offered in over 20 different volumes in different genres and musical styles. They are also a well recognised brandGuitarist‚Äôs Guide to Computer Music; Robin Vincent, Muska & Lipman Publishing, 2003, p.74.Complete Guide to Remixing; Erik Hawkins, Berklee Press, 2004, p13.Practical Recording Techniques, 4th ed.; Bruce and Jenny Bartlett, Focal Press, 2005, p.392. and have been used in thousands of commercial recordings and scores since their inception.

Established in 2007, HDI was the only event of its kind that exclusively focuses on the dance forms associated with house music cultureSelah, Makkada B., ‚ÄúPowder Burns: House Dancing Finally Gets Its Day (Four, Actually) in New York City‚Äù, Village Voice, June 26, 2007. (as compared to hip-hop dance forms such as b-boying, popping, locking, krumping, etc.). Mission HDI represents a New York-based mission to bring together the various individuals and organizations that have played a role in the creation and development of house dance culture. Dating back to the 1970s in New York City and Chicago, the culture grew out of the clubs and social networks of the black and Latino gay community. Noteworthy clubs in Chicago included the Warehouse, Riviera, Music Box, and Medusa's. Landmark New York clubs where House dance developed included Paradise Garage, The Loft, and Sound Factory Bar. With the invention of house music in 1983, house dance culture began to flourish in a cross-section of urban society, attracting dancers from all walks of life, ethnic backgrounds, socioeconomic classes and sexual orientations. The culture became a melting pot and repository for all types of dance styles: tap, jazz, modern, capoeira, salsa, b-boying, hip-hop that eventually morphed into its own distinctive style.Freeman, Santiago, ‚ÄúHouse Dance Hits the Concert Stage‚Äù, Dance Spirit Magazine, February 2007. The contribution of the various styles was fostered by the open-minded nature of the culture, which thrives on themes of liberation, unity and mutual passion for the music.Id Until the establishment of HDI, however, there had not been a formal recognition of the primary styles that had come to define the culture, specifically, House dance, Vogue, Waacking, Hustle, and Experimental. HDI brought the culture into focus and differentiated it from hip-hop culture, which many had mistakenly viewed as the precursor to House Dance. Event History The idea to host an annual NYC-based event dedicated to the various forms of house dance culture was conceived by Dancer and Event Producer Conrad Rochester in September 2006. As a legendary dancer of New York City's underground Club scene of the early 1980s, Conrad set out to produce the world's most comprehensive festival dedicated to the art form of dancing to house music. Enlisting the help of his rolodex of industry contacts Conrad launched the first HDI event in July 2007. HDIhttp://housedanceinternational.com was held at Sullivan Room, Alvin Ailey Studios and Club Shelter. Judges in 2007 included Archie Burnett, Conrad Rochester, Junious Brickhouse, Marjory Smarth, and James ‚ÄúCricket‚Äù Colter. The co-founders sought house dance pioneer Ejoe Wilson to be the Host / MC of the event.http://housedanceinternational.com Attendees The HDI event has been attended by thousands of dancers, DJs, house music enthusiasts and spectators from around the globe, including from South Africa, Japan, Korea, London, Paris, Sweden, Montreal, Belgium and Taiwan. Surveys conducted by the HDI organizers indicate that 25% of the attendees are from Japan, 23% from New York, 23% from out-of-state, 18% percent from Europe, and 6% from Canada, with the remaining 5% from other regions of Asia. As house dance culture begins to proliferate worldwide, attendance is expected to increase exponentially. Freestyle Competition Format HDI features five specific categories of freestyle competitions: House dance, Vogue, Experimental, Hustle, and Waacking. * House Dance (1x1): A dynamic urban dance performed to House Music that developed in the nightclubs of Chicago and New York over the last 25 years, the primary elements of House Dance consist of jacking, footwork and lofting with an emphasis on musicality and free spirit. * Vogue (1x1): One of the most breathtaking art forms in urban dance, Vogue has experienced a vibrant history in the underground club scene and continues to amaze with innovation. Dancers exhibit skills in the old way, new way, vogue femme and dramatics. * Experimental (1x1): A progressive urban dance performed to alternative genres of electronic dance music, including Nu Jazz, Broken Beat and Drum and Bass. Individual expression and abstract movement are the key components to this category. * Hustle (2x2): Dating back to the 1970s Disco Era, the Hustle is house dance culture's time-honored partner dance that consists of the romantic interchange between two free and elegant souls. * Waacking (1x1): A fierce upright style that developed on the West Coast during the Soul Train years, Waacking is an electrifying art form of complex arm and hand movements that project sensuality and strength from the legs. It demonstrates the movements in the legs. * House Dance Group Battle (5x5): Groups of up to 5 contestants compete as a unit and incorporate various genres of House Dance into their movement with an emphasis on musicality and free spirit. Groups are scored on a mathematical scale by a panel of judges using the following criteria: (1) musicality / rhythm; (2) vocabulary; (3) originality / creativity; (4) charisma; (5) staging / blocking; (6) costume design. All contestants must qualify for final rounds by auditioning at preliminary rounds. Each contestant receives approx. 2 minutes to dance in a solo exhibition to music selected by the DJ. A panel of judges scores each contestant on the basis of four criteria: (1) musicality/rhythm; (2) technique/vocabulary; (3) charisma/free spirit and (4). The top contestants with the highest mathematical scores in each category advance to the final rounds. Group Choreography Contest In addition to the freestyle competitions, HDI also hosted a group choreography contest that showcased the talents of groups within the house dance community. The Group Choreography Contest has now been replaced with the House 5x5 Group Battle Competition. Workshops HDI hosts its entire event exclusively at Jamaica Performing Arts Center in Jamaica, NY. HDI instructors have included Brian ‚ÄúFootwork‚Äù Greene, Ejoe Wilson, Marjory Smarth, Archie Burnett, Akim Funk Buddha, Tyrone Proctor, Sergia Anderson, David Padilla, FootworKingz, Yugson, Aus Ninja, Cesar Valentino, and Kim D. Holmes. Film Screenings Consistent with its theme of advancing House Dance culture, HDI has screened various films that address the subject matter of House Dance. Past films screenings have included: * Check Your Body at the Door: Dr. Sally Sommer, Professor of Dance at Florida State University, presented her remarkable documentary film that explores the movement vocabulary of legendary NYC house dancers, including Archie Burnett, Willi Ninja, Ejoe Wilson, Marjory Smarth and Conrad Rochester. Made possible in part by contributions from the National Endowment of the Arts, Dr. Somner interviews dancers from the local NYC scene and captures now- vintage footage from the late 80s and early 90s. Check Your Body at the Door now stands as an historical document and testament to the early years of NYC's house dance culture. * How Do I Look: Directed by Wolfgang Busch, How Do I Look is the follow-up the international breakthrough film Paris is Burning. The film documents New York's underground ballroom community from 1997 through 2004 and features some of the most respected dancers in the world of Vogue. * Dance For Peace: A non-profit organization dedicated to working with underprivileged youth from developing countries, Dance For Peace director Kumari Singh presented a short documentary in 2008 chronicling the impact that urban dance has had on the youth in South Africa. * HDI DVD Highlights: In 2008, film producers Santiago Freeman and Christopher Scott presented 2007 highlights from the various competition categories. Host / MC HDI is hosted by Jamal \\"Nemesis\\" Warren. Nemesis is a prolific dancer, having won various dance competitions globally and teaching on a regular basis. Nemesis has brought a fresh voice to HDI. As a successful dancer and producer of events such as Chicken and Beer, More than Enough NYC and UDEF Tour, Nemesis has solidified his position in today's Urban Dance Community. His heavy involvement in domestic and international Dance Community functions and competitions alike makes him a staple in today's dance scene and a force to be reckoned with. Organizers * Conrad Rochester (Creator / Executive Director). Conrad has been a Dancer for more than thirty-five years, growing up in The Lower East Side, New York City in the early 1970s.

In European countries and Asia, House Dance was introduced by a series of New York-based dancers who had gravitated to house dance from hip- hop culture in the early 1990s. As a result, house dance has been viewed as an extension or derivative of hip-hop culture when it in fact developed on its own trajectory in nightclubs throughout the 1980s, independent of what was happening in hip-hop culture.

It is mostly situated in the municipality of Halle, in Flemish Brabant and has also a little part in Walloon Brabant. The forest is known in the region for its bluebell carpet which covers the forest floor for a few weeks each spring, attracting many visitors. Visitors can reach there either by their own vehicle or through public transportation. For public transport, you can reach Halle Train station and get a bus till the entry of the forest.  History  Historically, the Hallerbos was part of the Silva Carbonaria, along with other forests in the vicinity including the Sonian Forest and Meerdaal. As late as 1777, it was still connected by a woodland strip to the Sonian Forest. During World War I, most of the old trees were removed by the occupying German forces. Reforestation took place from 1930 to 1950.

The building was constructed from 1872 to 1877 by Henry Hopper to a design by architect Frank Caws for Ronald Grimshaw, a local tea merchant, in a blend of the high Victorian Hindu Gothic and Venetian Gothic styles. This was a selling point, as the exotic style and name advertised the exotic origins of the tea sold there. Exterior The exterior is polychrome and was constructed from brick, terracotta and faience. The ground floor has a full- width tiled fascia continuing along to the neighbouring building; this 20th- century alteration may conceal earlier detail. The arcaded first floor has sash windows with sloping sills in the Gothic faience arcade, clasping rings and crocket capitals to the nookshafts, alternate block jambs, raised pointed arches and roll-moulded dripstring. The ogee window heads have fleur-de-lys finials in front of lozenge-patterned terracotta spandrels. The eaves cornice has a corbelled trefoil frieze. The attic windows have faience surrounds, similar to the first floor arcade, two trefoil-headed transom lights over mullioned lights, each window is in a high gable with round-headed niches in a banded faience decoration and moulded coping. Between the gables there are bracketed corniced shelves carrying faience elephants under bracketed gables with trefoil bargeboards with a crocket decoration and elaborate finials. The round oriel corner turret has nookshafts like the other first floor arcades but with arcaded central lights and blind arches, below a band of linked, splayed shafts and large eaves gargoyles. Above are further gablets are at the foot of the banded round turret with bracketed, eaves and a Buddhist-style conical faience roof with a series of ringed ribs.

It was followed by a 2011 sequel entitled ChromeSkull: Laid to Rest 2.  Plot  A young woman with amnesia breaks out of a coffin in a funeral home, and dials 911 in the morgue, but accidentally unhooks the telephone while speaking to the operator. The mortician appears, and is impaled by a man equipped with a chrome skull mask, and a shoulder mounted camera. The girl stabs ChromeSkull in the eye, and runs off while he treats his wound. The girl is picked up by Tucker, who takes her home to his wife Cindy, and promises her that they will go to the sheriff's station in the morning, as Tucker's truck is low on gas, and their phone service has been cut off. ChromeSkull tracks the girl (who has been nicknamed \\"Princess\\") to Tucker's house, and kills Cindy. Tucker and Princess escape in Tucker's truck as ChromeSkull deals with Cindy's brother Johnny and his girlfriend, who had come by to check on Cindy. Tucker and Princess seek aid from a recluse named Steven, who uses his computer to email for help, and research ChromeSkull, discovering he is a serial killer whose modus operandi is to send tapes of himself murdering women to the authorities. The trio go to the police station, and find the sheriff and a deputy dead, and ChromeSkull waiting for them. The group wound ChromeSkull's leg, and drive away, reaching the funeral home. Princess explores the area, and discovers that a nearby barn contains several of ChromeSkull's previous victims. ChromeSkull beheads a still-living captive, knocks Princess out, and places her in a casket. Before ChromeSkull can kill Princess, he is shot by Tucker, who drives away with her and Steven in ChromeSkull's car. Princess looks at footage on ChromeSkull's camera, which shows he was in league with the mortician, whom he killed due to the man becoming a liability. Princess takes the car while Tucker and Steven are removing bodies from the trunk, and is locked inside by ChromeSkull, who uses his cellphone to take control of the onboard computer as he follows Princess to a convenience store. Via paperwork in the car, Princess finds out ChromeSkull's name is Jesse Cromeans, right before he attacks her. ChromeSkull prepares to kill Princess, but he is out of tapes for his camera, so he coerces her into going into the store to get one. The clerk sees the threatening messages ChromeSkull is sending Princess through a cellphone, goes out to confront him, and has his head blown off when ChromeSkull turns his own shotgun on him. A customer, Anthony, goes to lock the backdoor, and is decapitated by ChromeSkull. Tucker and Steven reach the store, grab ChromeSkull's suitcase on the way in, and replace the glue he uses to keep his mask on with Cyanoacrylate. ChromeSkull cuts the power, and causes Steven's face to explode by injecting canned tire inflator into his ear. Tucker is stabbed while trying to give Princess enough time to escape with Tommy, the murdered customer's friend. ChromeSkull locks Tommy out of the building, and traps Princess in a freezer. To taunt Princess, ChromeSkull gives her his camera, which reveals she was a drug addicted prostitute he had picked up, and that she lost her memory when ChromeSkull beat her with a bat. Princess smashes the camera in frustration, and while struggling with ChromeSkull, knocks his mask off. ChromeSkull goes to reaffix his mask, unknowingly using the Cyanoacrylate that Steven had replaced his adhesive with. The chemical melts ChromeSkull's face as he peels his mask off, and as he writhes in agony, Princess bludgeons him with an aluminum bat. Princess finds her missing persons notice (which Steven had printed off his computer) in Tucker's pocket, who dies of his injury, and leaves with Tommy to Atlanta, after finding out that Anthony was murdered by ChromeSkull. The police arrive, and find the flyer, which Princess had written an explanation on the back of.  Cast Production=Filming locations A majority of principal photography occurred in southern Maryland, notably the state-owned, abandoned Crownsville Hospital Center near Annapolis. The crew spent 24 days shooting in April and May 2008. While the above-the-line production team was based out of Los Angeles, a few department heads were locals to DC-Maryland-Virginia, as well as most of the crew. Lead actress/producer Bobi Sue Luther is a native of the area, and was able to use personal connections to secure key locations. The production employed creative methods to save money; for instance, Chromeskull's on-camera vehicle was director Robert Hall's daytime rental car, and the VW Jetta that Princess rides off in at the finish was owned by the production designer. Cinematography A majority of the film was shot using a Panasonic AJ-HPX3000 1080p camera system.  Release  Laid to Rest received a limited theatrical run in March 2009. It was released on home video April 21, 2009.  Reception  Dread Central gave the film a four out of five, concluding \\"Laid to Rest does have some minor issues with pacing at first but really finds its stride about 30 minutes in and just keeps moving along until the very end. What I like here is that Hall was able to create a slasher film with characters we care about but definitely doesn't take anything too seriously either, giving horror fans a movie that's both entertaining and a lot of fun to watch\\". DVD Talk awarded three out of five, which said that while Laid to Rest \\"contrives a lot of convenient coincidences to keep the plot rolling\\" and was \\"admittedly lacking in logic\\" it was still \\"an entertaining 90 minute thrill ride\\". DVD Verdict also responded well to Laid to Rest, writing that it was \\"an inventive, sick as all get out thrill- ride\\" and \\"an entertaining, engaging slasher movie\\". Scott Weinberg of Fearnet wrote, \\"Powerfully gory, peppered with unexpected doses of weird humor, and backed by a colorful cast of familiar faces, Rob Hall's Laid to Rest is hardly the most original or trail-blazing terror tale out there -- but it's an '80s-style throwback piece that gains a lot of mileage out of very little gas.\\"  Sequels  The film has been followed by a sequel titled ChromeSkull: Laid to Rest 2 and has an upcoming prequel in development. A third film, Laid to Rest: Exhumed was due to start principal photography in December 2017 in northern Alabama. However, as of May 2020, the film has not been mentioned again.

For businesses, the Software-plus-Services approach enables organizations to access the capabilities of enterprise software through on-premises servers, as online services, or a combination of both, depending on specific business requirements. Services also provide the option to add complementary capabilities that enhance on-premises server software and simplify system management and maintenance. Product Suite: Business Productivity Online Suite (BPOS)  The Business Productivity Online Suite Standard represents the first of a growing portfolio of Microsoft Online Services. Microsoft Online Services are a component of the broader Microsoft Software-plus-Services strategy that includes both Live and Online services.  Office 365  The successor of BPOS is Office 365. Where BPOS is based on Exchange 2007 and MOSS 2007, Office 365 was originally built around the 2010 versions of Exchange and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS) and now the 2019 versions, since one of the benefits of Office 365 is that it is 'evergreen'.

One reason can be that the type of support requests will differ from service requests for Microsoft products the customer runs on his own infrastructure: when a company opens a support question because they have problems with mail-sending using Outlook and their own Microsoft Exchange Server the technical side of such a support request is totally different from when the customer uses BPOS. Also the expectations of the customer will be different: they have outsourced the services to Microsoft to avoid problems, thus when it doesn't work they expect that Microsoft solves their problem quickly. For that reason a dedicated BPOS and Office 365 support desk is in place in the US and in Ireland for the EMEA region. Microsoft's main support-providing partner HP has been busy finding and training new Tier 1 and Tier 2 support engineers for this desk.

Early life and education Jere Abbott was born on October 5, 1897 to Arthur Abbott and Flora Parkman (Abbott) in Dexter, Maine. Abbott received his bachelor's degree from Bowdoin College in science and went on to attend graduate school at Harvard University in physics. It was here that he met Alfred Hamilton Barr, who sparked his interest in Art History. Abbott studied in France and Russia, and returned to the US to receive a graduate degree in art history from Princeton.  Career  In the spring of 1929, Abbott established the fine arts department at Wesleyan University. From 1929-1932, Abbott worked as the first associate director of the Museum of Modern Art, alongside its first director, Barr. In 1932, Abbott became director of the Smith College Museum of Art, where he also taught some classes in modern art. Abbott was instrumental in shifting the Museum's focus toward the collection of modern pieces, including Picasso's cubist Table, Guitar, and Bottle (1919). In 1946, Abbott retired from Smith to return to his family business, Amos Abbott Woolen Manufacturing Company in Dexter, Maine, as treasurer. Abbott also served, for 35 years, as a trustee of the Abbott Memorial Library in Dexter.  Death and legacy  Abbott died in Dexter, Maine on July 9, 1982. He was 84 years old. At the time of his death, Abbott left a $4.3-million acquisition fund to the Colby College Museum of Art.  Honors  In 1970, Abbott was awarded an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from Colby College. ReferencesExternal links *Jere Abbott papers at the George J.

The gameplay and visuals are similar to that of a Konami arcade game, Jungler, released the previous year. Serpentine was originally written for the Apple II and ported to the VIC-20, Commodore 64 and Atari 8-bit family. The VIC-20 version was licensed to Creative Software. Gameplay The player controls (rides, by game description ) a multi- segmented blue 'good' serpent in a maze with the objective of eating all computer-controlled 'evil' (red or orange or green) serpents. Eating the tail segments of serpents makes them shorter, and a red or orange serpent turns green when shorter than the player. Hitting a green serpent headfirst eliminates it, and causes the player's serpent to grow an additional segment. Hitting a red or orange serpent headfirst causes the player's serpent to die. A frog appears at random intervals and gives any serpent eating it an additional segment. Once all opponents have been eliminated, the player's serpent automatically returns to a protected area. As the game progresses, opposing serpents are faster and longer, increasing the difficulty, and each advancing level the existing players serpent gets slower. If the player's serpent dies, the replacement regains its original speed, but loses any additional segments gained by the previous incarnation. One unique aspect of the game is how extra lives are gained. The playing serpent will lay an egg (losing a segment in the process) and, if the egg is still on screen when the player re-enters the protected area at the end of a level, the egg hatches into another serpent, which hurries to the protected area. Enemy serpents will also lay eggs; if one hatches, a new two-segment opponent appears. It is possible to lose the last segment to an egg, resulting in the death of that serpent, but this can only happen to the player's serpent. If a frog happens to appear while an egg is on the map, it will head towards the egg and eat it as well. This will occur even at the end of a level when the player's serpent is operating on autopilot, making the choice of position where the last enemy serpent is killed tactically important. Most versions of the game include 20 different mazes, but the Atari cartridge version only has 5. Reception Softline in 1982 called Serpentine \\"devilishly addicting, being endowed with the qualities that make arcade games worth the bother\\". Michael Cranford reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \\"In my opinion, Serpentine is far better than the sum of its inspirations.\\" Karl Westerholm reviewed Serpentine in Space Gamer No. 65. Westerholm commented that \\"Serpentine is unquestionably a game worth owning, and if there are any weaknesses or bugs, I have yet to find them. I definitely recommend this game, as it promises to provide fun and excitement for a very long time.\\" The Commodore 64 Home Companion in 1984 said that \\"it's easy to get hooked on this one\\". Serpentine ranked #13 for most popular game of 1982 according to Softalk magazine.

Its range includes most of north-central Bulgaria (without the regions of Dryanovo and Elena), as well as the regions of Karlovo, Kazanlak and Plovdiv in southern Bulgaria, all the way down to the northernmost ridges of the Rhodopes. As a result of the mass population movements that affected eastern Bulgaria during the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, the Central Balkan dialect is now spoken also in vast areas of northeastern Bulgaria. The most significant feature of the dialect is the pronunciation of Old Church Slavonic —£ (yat) as or , depending on the character of the following syllable. The Central Balkan dialect lies at the foundation of formal Bulgarian. However, it is not identical to the standard language because many of its features derive from the Western Bulgarian dialects, including the Macedonian dialects, or are a compromise between Eastern and Western standard.

The Griffin family retained the property until selling it in 1988 to the Hamilton Conservation Authority. The Griffin House (Ancaster) had been built circa 1827 by the previous owner and was restored between 1992 and 1994. Over 3,000 artefacts were discovered during that period. It is now a museum and, since 2008, a National Historic Site of Canada, operated as a joint project between the Hamilton Conservation Authority and Fieldcote Memorial Park and Museum.http://www.cityofwaterfalls.ca/griffin-falls/ and is now the Griffin House National Historic Site.https://www.hamilton.ca/attractions/hamilton-civic-museums/griffin-house- national-historic-site ReferencesExternal links * Hamilton- \\"The Waterfall Capital of the World\\" (www.cityofwaterfalls.ca) * Bruce Trail (www.brucetrail.org) * Vintage Postcards: Waterfalls in and around Hamilton, Ontario Maps * Hamilton Waterfall Map PDF.

Snakes of the Agkistrodon Complex: A Monographic Review. Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles. 614 pp. 52 plates. LCCN 89-50342. . southern cantil.Porras et al. (2013). Agkistrodon howardgloydi is a species of pit viper, a venomous snake in the subfamily Crotalinae in the family Viperidae. The subspecies is endemic to Central America. Etymology The specific name, howardgloydi, is in honor of American herpetologist Howard K. Gloyd.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Agkistrodon bilineatus howardgloydi, pp. 102, 126). Description Of the ten specimens of A. howardgloydi available to Gloyd and Conant (1990) from Nicaragua and Costa Rica, the largest male was and the largest female in total length (including tail). According to Villa (1984), adults in Nicaragua almost never exceed in length. In both sexes, the tail length is 19% of the total body length. Scalation includes 23 rows of keeled dorsal scales at midbody; 128-135 ventral scales; and 54-61 subcaudal scales, roughly half of which are paired, especially towards the tail tip. The dorsal color pattern consists of light to medium reddish brown ground color overlaid with 10-14/13-17 broad brown or brownish crossbands in males/females. Large adult males tend to be melanistic. Juveniles are more lightly colored, even to the point of being bright red. The head is clearly marked on either side with two longitudinal light lines: the upper one is narrow and broken or even absent posterior to the supraocular scale; while the lower one is wider and split into two parts which may or may not meet at the suture of the third supralabial scale. Geographic range and habitat Agkistrodon howardgloydi is found in the dry Pacific lowlands of Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. The type locality given is \\"0.8 km north Mirador el Ca√±on del Tigre, Parque Nacional Santa Rosa, Provincia Guanacaste, Costa Rica\\". Taxonomy Agkistrodon howardgloydi was elevated to full species status from A. b. howardgloydi by Porras et al. in 2013.\\"Agkistrodon howardgloydi \\".

Description  This plant is a perennial herb with a branching stem taking a prostrate form on the ground and growing up to about 50 centimeters long. The leaves are bifoliolate, each made up of two leaflets, which are widely lance-shaped and up to 4 centimeters long. At the base is a stipule up to a centimeter in length. The herbage is hairless to lightly hairy. The inflorescence is a spike of up to 35 yellow flowers each about a centimeter long. The flowers open for only 5 to 10 hours. The bractlets are longer than the flowers and may cover them. The fruit is a spiny, hairy legume pod.Zornia latifolia. TropicalForages. Ecology In its native range it grows in savanna habitat with acidic and low-fertility soils. It tolerates drought, but does not tolerate cold or shade. In Africa it grows as a weed in lawns and on roadsides. The plant is susceptible to plant pathogens such as the fungi Sphaceloma zorniae, which causes scab disease, and Meliola species, which cause stunting and distortion of the leaves. Insect pests include the red- necked peanutworm moth (Stegasta bosqueella).  Uses =Forage This legume is a nutritious and palatable forage for livestock. It can be grown as a companion plant to grasses such as Andropogon gayanus and Brachiaria decumbens. Hallucinogen and adulteration A common component of many synthetic cannabis mixtures producing hallucinogenic effects, such as the street drug, 'Spice', Zornia latifolia may have cannabis-like effects. It may be adulterated by a different Fabaceae plant, Stylosanthes guianensis, which is phytochemically different from Zornia latifolia. The flavones genistein and apigenin may explain the cannabis-like effects of Zornia latifolia.

Career A native of Lebanon, Maine, and an 1856 graduate of Bowdoin College, Stanton studied law from 1856 to 1857 and then became teacher of the New Hampton School in New Hampshire from 1857 to 1858. He studied at Andover Theological Seminary from 1858 to 1861. He served as principal of the Pinkerton Academy in Derry, New Hampshire, from 1861 to 1863. Stanton then went to Bates College where his brother Levi had been teaching. Stanton taught at Bates from 1863 until his death in 1918. He taught Greek and Latin, led debates, and taught a popular class in ornithology. Stanton maintained a correspondence with Charles Darwin, and some of Darwin's letters have survived.https://kent.bates.edu/librarynews/node/117 The local Stanton Bird Club is still active to this day, and the \\"Stanton Ride\\", where he paid to have horses and carriages take the freshman class on a picnic where he would tell them the history of the college, continued as a tradition for over 100 years. Referred to by students as \\"Uncle Johnny\\" and by college president George C. Chase as \\"the spirit of Bates\\", Stanton refused to leave Bates for any other colleges and remains one of the school's most influential professors to this day. Stanton was influential in creating a strong debate tradition at Bates with the creation of debate prizes and supporting the literary and debate societies, such as the Polymnian and Eurosophian Societies in the early years of the school.Guide to the Brooks Quimby Debate Council, 1865-2008 http://abacus.bates.edu/muskie-archives/EADFindingAids/CA1204.html Stanton's large collection of bird specimens was mainly sent from Bates to the Maine State Museum in 1980, but several specimens remain on campus.http://www.bates.edu/news/2015/12/17/the-birds-carnegie-science-hall/ ReferencesExternal links *Brief biography *Stanton Bird Club Category:1834 births Category:1918 deaths Category:Bowdoin College alumni Category:Bates College faculty ","title":"Jonathan Stanton"},{"id":"18664544","text":"Szyszki may refer to the following places: *Szyszki, Lublin Voivodeship (east Poland) *Szyszki, Podlaskie Voivodeship (north-east Poland) *Szyszki, Silesian Voivodeship (south Poland) ","title":"Szyszki"},{"id":"18664547","text":"Szyszki () is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Sok√≥≈Çka, within Sok√≥≈Çka County, Podlaskie Voivodeship, in north-eastern Poland, close to the border with Belarus.

The outlet, which is owned by Dick Broadcasting, operates at 107.5 MHz with an ERP of 100 kW. It has studio facilities and offices in downtown Greensboro alongside its sister station WKRR, and a transmitter site is near Stokesdale, North Carolina. History In 1958, WYFS became the first Winston-Salem station to play classical music. In 1966, the station became WAAA-FM, airing the soul music of WAAA, and WFDD took over classical music. WAAA-FM was sold to Golden Circle Broadcasting Corp. in 1971. The station had the call letters WSGH (standing for Winston-Salem / Greensboro / High Point) during the early 1970s when its format was easy listening. The station began stereo broadcasts in January 1975 and changed its call letters to WKZL. In 1976, WKZL moved from a 285-foot tower on Indiana Avenue to a 499-foot tower and doubled its power to 100,000 watts.\\"WKZL To Relocate, WKBX To Adopt All-News Format,\\" Twin City Sentinel, June 25, 1976, p. 5. For a short period of time in the mid-1970s the station featured an eclectic blend of pop, rock and progressive rock selected at random by the hosts. DJs on the air from 1975-1977 included Steve Gold (Marshall), Alan Cameron, Mitch Clarke, Nick Archer, Bruce Key, Ron Spivey, Kitty Kinnin, Reid Stott, Steve Norris, and Steve Day. Production chores were handled by Jack Shaw and Rowell Gormon. The late ‚Äô70s era of WKZL‚Äôs programming was a mix of Top 40 and album cuts formulated into playlists based on focus groups created under the direction of eccentric owner Bob Brown. Program hosts included Morning Show Host Doug Paul, Rod Davis, Chris Angel, Kitty Kinnin, J.J. Hemingway, D.D. Thornton, and Chuck Holloway, who also served as Music Director. Doug Paul served as Program Director during his time at WKZL between 1978 and 1982. During this period, the station was pioneering music research that included weekly focus groups of 18- to 49-year-old listeners assembled by Owner Bob Brown and Sharon Paul. The format of the station was a unique hybrid of Deep Tracks, Top 40 and Jazz. Local music artists were featured in the programming mix and live concerts were broadcast weekly via NBC's THE SOURCE and other radio program syndicators. Known for a keen spot production sound and aggressive demo sales, the WKZL of the late 70's won many local and regional advertising awards and had up to three full-time copywriters on staff. Brown eventually sold WAAA to Mutter Evans, who made history at age 25 by becoming the youngest black woman to own a commercial radio station in the US. Soon afterwards Brown sold WKZL to Nationwide Broadcasting, while maintaining ownership of the building that housed both stations. When Nationwide took control and installed Station Manager Rick Fromme and Program Director Tom Daniels, the station changed its format to the more classic AOR (Album-oriented rock) under the guidance of the radio consultant firm Burkhart/Abrams. By 1982, WKZL was known by its slogan as ‚ÄúNorth Carolina‚Äôs Best Rock‚Äù. The playlist was built around well-known stadium artists such as Pink Floyd, The Who, and Led Zeppelin along with Southern Rock favorites Lynyrd Skynyrd, the Allman Brothers Band, and Molly Hatchet. Heavy metal artists AC/DC, Judas Priest, Ozzy Osbourne, and copycat artists also shared the spotlight with AOR pop artists REO Speedwagon and Journey. Some of the original staff remained - including Chuck Holloway and Kitty Kinnin - but most of the new staff brought on board came from other AOR stations. DJs included DD Thornton, Danno Lopez, Charlie McGee, Tim Hogan and Neal Cassady. Although WKZL branded itself as a classic rock station, it also distinguished itself as a leader with a new music program launched in March 1982 called the \\"New Generation Show\\". Former WKZL DJ DD Thornton submitted a proposal for a one-hour Sunday evening show to introduce new, innovative artists to the classic rock audience. Her proposal was considered so risky WKZL had to present it to Burkhart/Abrams asking for approval. Lee Abrams granted approval to give the show a test run. The show debuted in March 1982 on Sunday evenings from 11:00 to midnight. Among the featured artists were Elvis Costello, The Pretenders, and XTC. The show became so popular that station manager Fromme decided to expand the show from 11:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. Around the same time, local nightclub \\"Casablanca\\" asked to try a live version of the show on Monday nights. That weekly event drew large crowds and ran for several years. Eventually the \\"New Generation Show\\" was expanded to Sundays from 10:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. and was live at several clubs in Winston-Salem and Greensboro. The popularity of many of the new artists that were played on \\"New Generation,\\" the introduction of MTV, and the dedication of record and radio professionals who recognized the value of these new artists, prompted WKZL to open its format a bit and bring new artists such as X, the English Beat, the Psychedelic Furs, Berlin, Gary Numan, Wall of Voodoo, Duran Duran, U2, and R.E.M., into regular rotation. Because of Thornton's persistence, R.E.M.'s song \\"Radio Free Europe\\" was allowed into WKZL's playlist, making WKZL one of the first major commercial stations to play R.E.M.'s music in high rotation. WKZL went through a series of Program Directors grappling with the emergence of pop bands gaining popularity through MTV and how to balance these modern bands with the traditional ‚Äúclassic rock‚Äù format. By 1984, the hard- edge sound gave way to the pop sounds of Prince, Michael Jackson, and other artists who frequented Billboard‚Äôs Top 40 charts. On June 1, 1985, WKZL became an affiliate of American Top 40 with Casey Kasem. While the \\"New Generation Show\\" remained popular, as the station format and management evolved towards mainstream, program creator and producer DD Thornton altered the program name to \\"Choice Cuts\\" as a way of keeping pace with WKZL's changing facade, although the show's format remained the same. Yet as WKZL's format increasingly moved away from rock and into CHR, the juxtaposition of a show featuring groundbreaking artists with formulaic hits became more incongruous. Thornton cancelled the show and eventually left WKZL. For most of the 1990s, WKZL called itself \\"107.5 The Eagle\\", playing adult contemporary music. For a brief time, the station was modern adult contemporary, competing directly with \\"98-7 The Point\\" (which changed to variety hits in 2005). Eventually the decision was made to return to Top 40. That came in 1999, around Labor Day weekend, when the station stunted, with recordings by management saying that the station was underperforming and that all the deejays were suspended until a new plan could be worked out. Morning man Jack Murphy was with the station from 1993 until 2012. The core of the Murphy in the Morning Show for most of the 1990s was Jack, joined by Terrie Knight (who also did news) and Chris Kelly (who also produced the show). Eric Christopher (1996-1998) was a weekend part-timer who became the morning show producer. Knight and Kelly exited in 1999, when Kelly went to do the \\"2 Guys Named Chris\\" show on Dick Broadcasting's other property, Rock 92 (WKRR). Knight went to do afternoons (at KZL), where she stayed until 2005 when she left the station and radio, altogether. Following Kelly and Knight, Jack Murphy was joined by cohosts Jeff Corbett, Britt Whitmire (1999-2003), Heather B. (2000-2002), Josie Cothran (2002‚Äì2007), John Garrett (2003-2004), Josh \\"in the Box\\" Anderson (2004-2010), Jared Pike (2007-current) and Katie O'Brien Tesh (2005-current). Controversy In August 2015, Jared Pike and Jason Goodman were suspended after an on-air altercation erupted during \\"the baby bottle challenge.\\" After apologizing to the staff and to their audience they were back on the air a week later.

History BANG was founded in New York City in January 1989 by former advertising agency creative director Lyle Greenfield. The company was first housed in the studios of hip-hop recording facility, Calliope Productions, where artists such as De La Soul, Queen Latifah, Black Sheep, A Tribe Called Quest, Brand New Heavies and Stereo MCs had recorded their early records. 1990s In 1993, BANG left Calliope and established its own studios in a two-story brick building in New York's historic Flatiron District. The building, once a horse stable, was converted into the company's recording and office facilities.

In the mid-1990s BANG formed an independent label imprint, Notorious Records, releasing several dance singles including a remake of Phil Collins‚Äô iconic hit \\"In The Air Tonight\\". Billboard praised the recording, calling it \\"a solid job of linking the song's darkly intense lyrics with a firm house beat and ethereal keyboard.\\" Industry activism In 1997, Lyle Greenfield joined a group of music production companies in New York City in discussions concerning fair business practices for music creators in the commercial and entertainment industries. A new trade association was formed, with Greenfield suggesting its moniker - AMP: The Association of Music Producers. (AMP).

The characters The two boys, Jack and Chip Power, aged 17 and 15 respectively, with their Dalmatian, Blaze, live with their photojournalist father Thomas, their mother having died before the events in the first book. Jack and Chip travel with Mr. Power, and get involved in various adventures in which they act as detectives, track down criminals and end up in various dangerous situations. The books feature brief descriptions of the characters' appearance. Jack is described as tall and slender, with reddish-brown hair cut short, and he has green eyes and freckles; Chip is slim, almost as tall as Jack, has blond hair with reddish glints, and his eyes are blue. Jack is portrayed as more serious and dependable, and Chip is more impulsive - sometimes his eyes or face are described as mischievous. Thomas Power is about as tall as Jack, but looks shorter because he is of heavier build. His hair is black and streaked with premature grey. The boys and their father are portrayed as very close to each other.The Mystery of the Haunted Skyscraper, pages 11, 13, 25, 1964 The stories For most of the series it is not clear where the family's regular home is, since the books are set in a wide variety of locations within the U.S. Three of the books are set in New York City (nos. 1, 5, and 6), but it is clear in the first two of these that they are merely visiting the city, and do not live there; in the third of these New York books, which is the last in the series, the family has come to live there, because Barry Donovan, a wealthy man who appeared in book five, could supply Thomas Power with a lot of future work. The first paragraph of this last book tells how much the brothers love their new eight-room apartment. We also learn that Mrs. Donovan helped with the decorating.The Mystery of the Vanishing Lady, pages 7-9, 1967 There is a single brief mention in the series of their home being or having been in ChicagoThe Mystery of the Double Kidnapping, page 22, 1966, but no scene anywhere in the series is set there. The boys do not appear to have an extended family of aunts, uncles, cousins, or grandparents; or if they do, they are never mentioned even in passing. But Detective James Wilson of the New York Police Department appears or is mentioned in several of the books, not only in his capacity as a police officer dealing with crimes in the books, but is also mentioned as one of Thomas Power's oldest and dearest friends.The Mystery of the Vanishing Lady, page 51, 1967 Detective Wilson plays a role in the boys' lives similar to that of a favorite uncle. The boys do not seem to have many long-lasting friends in their own age group (or at least not ones who are mentioned), but do make friendships which last for the duration of a single book. The single exception to this is that the boys do make friends with Dick Donovan, the son of the aforementioned Barry Donovan, in the fifth book (in which Dick plays a prominent role), and the friendship is shown as continuing into the sixth book, although Dick's role in that book is less prominent. The six books in the series are as follows: # The Mystery of the Haunted Skyscraper (1964) # The Mystery of the Flying Skeleton (1964) # The Mystery of the Burning Ocean (1965) # The Mystery of the Million-Dollar Penny (1965) # The Mystery of the Double Kidnapping (1966) # The Mystery of the Vanishing Lady (1967) Editions The books were published with illustrated hard covers, but no dust jackets. Raymond Burns' line illustrations were done in a single color, which varies from book to book. At one time Whitman published paperback (plus paperback-sized hardback \\"library edition\\") formats of some of their book series. It is not certain whether or not Power Boys mysteries were available in these smaller formats. The author Nothing is known about Mel Lyle. Many of the Whitman series used a pseudonym in place of the actual author's name. William Larson, an editor hired by Whitman in 1964, stated that if more than one book in a series was published in a year, they were almost always written by different people. Schoolgirl Shamuses, Inc., Knight, Melanie, SynSine Press, page 213, 2006 Since two Power Boys books were published in both 1964 and 1965 it is likely that more than one person wrote the series. The first book was written by prolific author William Manners who used Mel Lyle as a pseudonym. It‚Äôs possible he wrote all of them. The original name of the brothers was Jack and Chip Victor. Other Power Boys books There is another series of children's adventure books referred to as \\"Power Boys\\" books. Written by Woody Gelman under the name Arthur Benwood in the 1950s, they antedate Lyle's books. The brothers referred to are different characters (Ted and Steve Power instead of Jack and Chip Power), and Gelman's books would appear to be completely unrelated. Whether Lyle was influenced by this earlier series in his choice of his Power Boys' surname is unknown.

It opened in 1883 and moved to its present location at 132 East 78th Street in 1924.  History  The Allen School was founded in 1883 by Francis Bellows Allen at a home on Fifth Avenue and 57th Street. Its first class enrolled only three boys. In 1885, the school moved to rented rooms at Madison Avenue and 44th Street with an enrollment of 20 boys. In 1904, Mr. Allen met Robert Alston Stevenson, a tutor, who by chance had taken a room at 509 Fifth Avenue, where the School was then located. In 1904, Mr. Allen and Mr. Stevenson joined forces and then moved to 50 East 57th Street with 100 students. By 1918 enrollment exceeded 200. The School published its first newspaper, The Spotlight, and introduced an exercise program and team sports. In 1924, the School purchased two brownstones for a new schoolhouse and moved to its present location on the Upper East Side. In 1939, Mr. Allen retired at the age of 80, after 56 years of service. In 1947, Mr. Stevenson retired after 43 years of service. His son, Robert \\"Huck\\" Alston Stevenson Jr., who had taught at the School, succeeded him as Headmaster. In 1950, Joseph C. Rennard became Headmaster of Allen-Stevenson and served for nine years. The School introduced team sports at Randall's Island and required boys to wear navy blue blazers and gray flannel pants. In 1959, Henry Dyer Tiffany, Jr. became Headmaster until 1974. Under his leadership, a modern science lab and a paneled library, a gift from the Bell family, were added. Allen- Stevenson's school song was composed by Rolande Schrade in 1968, the year she joined the A-S faculty as a lower-school music teacher.Noble, Clifton, Jr. \\"Remembering Rolande and Robelyn Schrade,\\" The Republican, February 2, 2015. In 1974, Desmond Cole became Headmaster and served in that capacity for 16 years.\\"Desmond Cole: Obituary.\\" The New York Times, January 13, 2008. During his tenure, he created the Middle School division. In 1983, The Allen- Stevenson School celebrated its first 100 years and published The Allen- Stevenson Centennial Album. Around that time an East 77th Street addition, designed by A-S parent Alfredo De Vido, was built onto the school. In 1990, the Board of Trustees appointed David Trower as Allen-Stevenson's seventh Headmaster. In 2001, Allen-Stevenson launched its first website to improve communication about the School. In 2007, a total renovation-expansion of the school interior was completed, which preserved the school's Classical Revival brick and Victorian brownstone facades according to New York Landmarks Preservation Commission guidelines for the Upper East Side Historic District. In 2008, the school completed a year-long celebration of its 125th anniversary. The Board of Trustees approved Allen-Stevenson and Its Community, a policy statement about inclusion and community life. In 2009, Allen- Stevenson was twice recognized for its work on energy and the environment, first with a coveted Energy Star rating by the U.S. Department of Energy, and then by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) for LEED Gold Certification for Existing Buildings (EB).[1] This made Allen-Stevenson the very first elementary school in the United States to achieve LEED-EB Gold status.Stein, Harris, and William Jose Higgins. \\"The Allen-Stevenson School is the First Elementary School in the U.S. to Receive LEED Gold Award for Existing Buildings.\\" Building Energy Performance Assessment News, January 2010.

It is located in near Phura village in Saiha district, within the Mara Autonomous District Council. Its geographical location falls under the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot, and is therefore rich in animal and plant species. The lake is a major component of the Palak Wildlife Sanctuary, and it supports the major biodiversity of the sanctuary. Pala is derived from a mythical Mara story for the name of the lake while tipo means \\"lake\\"; it is called Palak Dil in Mizo ·π≠awng. The lake gives the name of the region Palak Assembly Constituency under Election Commission of India. Location Palak Dil is situated within Mara Autonomous District Council (MADC), one of the three autonomous district councils in the southernmost part of the state. It is about 76 km away from Siaha, the headquarters of MADC. It can be reached by small/light vehicles only. Three villages such as Phura, Tongkalong, and Pala (Lawngban-in Mizo), are in close proximity. Phura is the main route for visitors. Origin According to oral history Palak Dil is said to be formed around 800-1200 CE. It coincided with the period of westward migration of Mara people from Burma. The origin of Palak Dil is a well known folktale among Mizo people. According to Mara legend the location area was originally a big village called Hnychao. There were about 300 families. At the center of the village was a large rock, underneath of which was a cave inhabited by a giant serpent. Villagers soon noticed that children playing around the rock frequently disappeared. At night their livestock animals were missing too. The village hunters caught the serpent using a gigantic fishing pole, and using a goat (or dog in other version) as a bait. From this point there are two versions: #They killed the snake and the meat was distributed to all families. A widow with two children happened to get a share of the head. When she cooked it, the eyes were blinking and rolling, staring at her. Frightened, she threw the cooking pot into the street. When she looked out, their doorstep was being flooded and fled for life with her children. The pool rose to a lake submerging the entire habitation and drowning the rest of the villagers. The lake was eventually called Pala Tipo. #In an alternate version, when they caught the snake they could not completely haul out its body and cut it in the middle. The bottom half fell back into the cave with massive thunder. It created an upsurge of water from the cave, submerging the whole village. This became a permanent lake and was called Pala Tipo, literally meaning a \\"swallowing or submerging lake\\". Hydrology Palak Dil is oval in shape with a length of 870 meters, width of 700 meters, and depth of 17 to 25 meters. It is believed that a village exists below the lake, some people believes that the lake is haunted by ghosts and demons. Another Legend also believes that a British officer once dropped his sword in the middle of the lake and ordered one of his men to retrieve it, the men dived to retrieve it but came back only after 3 days explaining that he had feasted and was too drunk to return. The lake is fed by two main streams from the nearby mountains. Its drainage is through a small river called Pala Lui. This drainage area creates a stretch of valley, which remains the main agricultural area of the Mara people. Wildlife Palak Dil is home to a number of resident and migratory animals. It is particularly rich in a variety of birds, including endemic bird species. The water is inhabited by common and unique species of fishes. Different species of prawns, snails, crabs, turtles and tortoises. More than 70 species of birds have been recorded from the lake and its shore. Among unique species are Nepal fulvetta, white- bellied yuhina, little spiderhunter, streaked spinderhunter, yellow wagtail, black-capped kingfisher, hooded pitta, spot-breasted scimitar babbler, and white-rumped munia, which are rarely seen in other parts of the region. In addition aquatic birds and wild ducks in Palak Dil are found nowhere else in Mizoram. Conservation Palak Dil and its surrounding area covering 15 km2. is declared by the Indian Ministry of Environment and Forests as a protected area under the Palak Wildlife Sanctuary. The surrounding forest is extensively exploited due to shifting cultivation. The Bombay Natural History Society has selected it as potential ramsar site for wetland conservation.

It is manufactured by Uwe M√®ffert and has been sold in his puzzle shop since 2008. The puzzle was originally called the Brilic,http://www.helm.lu/gallery2/main.php?g2_itemId=365 and was first made in 2006 by Aleh Hladzilin,http://twistypuzzles.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4221 a member of the Twisty Puzzles Forum. It is not to be confused with the Pyraminx, which is also invented and sold by Meffert.  History  White- bodied Pyraminx Crystal with a star pattern applied to the faces. The Pyraminx Crystal was patented in Europe on July 16, 1987. The patent number is DE8707783U. In late 2007, due to requests by puzzle fans worldwide, Uwe M√®ffert began manufacturing the puzzle. The puzzles were first shipped in February 2008. There are two 12-color versions, one with the black body commonly used for the Rubik's Cube and its variations, and one with a white body. The puzzle company QJ started manufacturing this puzzle in 2010, leading Meffert's Puzzles to file a lawsuit against QJ. The Pyraminx Crystal ran out of stock fairly quickly, and became a collector's puzzle. In October 2011, a new set was created with some slight improvements to the quality.  Description  Pyraminx Crystal, one face in the middle of a twist The puzzle consists of a dodecahedron sliced in such a way that each slice cuts through the centers of five different pentagonal faces. This cuts the puzzle into 20 corner pieces and 30 edge pieces, with 50 pieces in total. Each face consists of five corners and five edges. When a face is turned, these pieces and five additional edges move with it. Each corner is shared by 3 faces, and each edge is shared by 2 faces. By alternately rotating adjacent faces, the pieces may be permuted. The goal of the puzzle is to scramble the colors, and then return it to its original state.  Solutions  The puzzle is essentially a deeper- cut version of the Megaminx, and the same algorithms used for solving the Megaminx's corners may be used to solve the corners on the Pyraminx Crystal. The edge pieces can then be permuted by a simple 4-twist algorithm, R L' R' L, that leaves the corners untouched, in a manner similar to the Pyraminx. This can be applied repeatedly until the edges are solved.  Number of combinations  There are 30 edge pieces with 2 orientations each, and 20 corner pieces with 3 orientations each, giving a maximum of 30!¬∑230¬∑20!¬∑320 possible combinations. However, this limit is not reached because: # Only even permutations of edges are possible, reducing the possible edge arrangements to 30!/2. # The orientation of the last edge is determined by the orientation of the other edges, reducing the number of edge orientations to 229. # Only even permutations of corners are possible, reducing the possible corner arrangements to 20!/2. # The orientation of the last corner is determined by the orientation of the other corners, reducing the number of corner combinations to 319. # The orientation of the puzzle does not matter (since there are no fixed face centers to serve as reference points), dividing the final total by 60. There are 60 possible positions and orientations of the first corner, but all of them are equivalent because of the lack of face centers. This gives a total of \\\\frac{30!\\\\times 2^{27}\\\\times 20!\\\\times 3^{19}}{60} \\\\approx 1.68\\\\times 10^{66} possible combinations. The full figure is 1 677 826 942 558 722 452 041 933 871 894 091 752 811 468 606 850 329 477 120 000 000 000 (roughly 1.68 unvigintillion on the short scale or 1.68 undecillion on the long scale).

Formed in 1979 by Slobodan Ti≈°ma, the band recorded a three-song demo which was often broadcast on Radio Novi Sad. Having changed several lineups and despite having well received live appearances, the band disbanded in 1981. Ti≈°ma with at the time La Strada members Zoran Bulatoviƒá \\"Bale\\" and Ivan Fece \\"Firchie\\" formed Luna. After the Luna disbandment, in 1984 Ti≈°ma reformed La Strada with the former La Strada bassist Danijel Stari, former Luna member Jasmina Mitru≈°iƒá \\"Mina\\", guitarist ≈Ωolt Horvat and drummer Robert Radiƒá. The lineup entered the studio during the same year, however, it was in 1987 that the eponymous debut album La strada was released. After the album release the band lineup had changed but the band nevertheless disbanded soon afterward. In 2004, Luna reunited and performed at the Exit festival, and during the same year Ti≈°ma performed a solo concert with a half-hour set of La Strada songs at the Panƒçevo Grrr! festival, with the recording from the performance being released in 2011 under the La Strada moniker.  History = New wave years (1979-1981)  In 1979, Slobodan Ti≈°ma (guitar, lead vocals) also known as \\"Deda\\" (\\"Grandpa\\"), a rock veteran and poet, inspired by the increasing popularity of new wave music in Yugoslavia formed La Starada, naming it by the Federico Fellini movie La Strada. The rest of the band consisted of Danijel Stari (bass guitar, arrangements), Boris Oslovƒçan \\"Bora\\" (bass guitar), Sini≈°a Iliƒá \\"Siki\\" (guitar) and Dragan Nastasiƒá \\"Gane\\" (guitar) and a temporary drummer Sini≈°a Sekuliƒá \\"Sekula\\". The band functioned with a studio and a live lineup as Stari did not want to perform live and bassist Oslovƒçan was his live replacement and drummer Sekuliƒá also did not perform live so the band instead used a rhythm machine. The lineup made their first recordings in the Vrane≈°eviƒá brothers studio, which consisted of three songs \\"On\\" (\\"Himself\\"), \\"Sat\\" (\\"Clock\\") and \\"Narcis\\" (\\"Narcicus\\") which were often broadcast on radio Novi Sad's shows Yu Pop Scena (Yu Pop Scene) and Novi Vidici (New Views) hosted by Dragan Gojkoviƒá \\"Goja\\", one of the promoters of new wave music in Novi Sad. The former two tracks appeared on the semi-official compilation album Hokej klub Virginitas (Hokey Club Virginity), released in 1988 by Ding Dong Records. After the recording of the tracks both of the band's guitarists left the band and were replaced by Predrag Ostojiƒá \\"Pre≈æa\\" (guitar) and Ivan Fece \\"Firchie\\" (drums). The new lineup made their first live appearance in 1980 at the Novi Sad club No. 1 as an opening act for Elektriƒçni Orgazam. In May of the following year, the band performed at Festival Omladina, and at the Novi Sad Danube park handball playground, performing as an opening act for the band Film. After the performance at the Belgrade KST club in June 1981, due to a misunderstanding between the band members, bassist Oslovƒçan and then guitarist Ostojiƒá left the band. After their departure Ti≈°ma remained the only guitar player and the new bassist became the former Pekin≈°ka Patka member Zoran Bulatoviƒá \\"Bale\\". At the time, the band was preparing for a three-date mini tour, including Novi Sad, Panƒçevo and Belgrade, organized by the Muziƒçka Omladina concert agency, with the bands Laƒçni Franz, ƒåista Proza and Fotomodeli. Despite being well-accepted at the performances, the band ceased to exist and Ti≈°ma, Fece and Bulatoviƒá went on to form Luna.  Reformation (1984-1987)  After Luna disbanded, in 1984, Ti≈°ma and Stari, along with former Luna keyboard player and vocalist Jasmina Mitru≈°iƒá \\"Mina\\", and former Gomila G and Kontraritam guitarist ≈Ωolt Horvat and drummer Robert Radiƒá reformed La Strada. During the early 1985, in the annual D≈æuboks magazine's poll La Strada was pronounced as the greatest expectation of 1985. During the Spring of 1985, the song \\"≈Ωelje\\" (\\"Wishes\\") appeared on the various artists compilation Ventilator 202 vol. 3. After successful performances in Belgrade, Novi Sad, Zagreb, at the Yu Rock Momenat festival, the band entered the Radio Novi Sad studio 1 in order to record the material for their debut album with Mitar Subotiƒá, also known as Rex Illusivi, as the album producer. The entire material was recorded in a single day, which was the reason why Ti≈°ma was not content with his vocal performance as he was exhausted after watching the entire Live Aid concert broadcast the day before. The recordings were then sent to the at the time editor of PGP RTB records Petar Popoviƒá, who was interested in releasing the material. However, after the label editor had changed, the new editor Oliver Mandiƒá declined the material. In 1987 the music editors of Radio Novi Sad agreed to release the debut La Strada and Rex Illusivi albums in order to mark the thirtieth anniversary of the show Randevu sa muzikom (A Rendezvous With Music), and both albums were released in a limited printing of 500 copies. Unlike Luna's debut, La strada brought a more calmer and melodic sound, reminiscent of the 1960s psychedelic music combined with Ti≈°ma's poetry. The album featured several radio hits, including the song \\"Okean\\" (\\"The Ocean\\") for which a promotional video had been recorded. After the album release, Jasmina Mitru≈°iƒá and Daniel Stari left the band and the new band members became a former Ove Sezone Vedri Tonovi guitarist Zoran Lekiƒá \\"Leki\\" and the talented teenage bassist Ilija Vlaisavljeviƒá \\"Bebec\\". The new lineup held a live promotion of the released material before entering the studio in order to record the material for the second studio album. However, after the concert in Subotica during the late 1987, Ti≈°ma decided to disband La Strada and the material from the second studio album remained unreleased.  Post-breakup  After La Strada disbandment, Ti≈°ma quit his musical career and released two poetry books, the first Marinizmi (Marinisms) in 1995, and Vrt kao to (Garden Like That) in 1997; a collection of his texts released in literary magazines during the late 1980s and early 1990s were published as Blues Diary - Pitoma religiozna razmi≈°ljanja (Blues Diary - Cultivated Religious Meditations) in 2001 and he published an autobiographical novel Urvidek in 2005. He also wrote a libretto for a multimedia pseudo-opera Kralj ≈°ume (King of the Forest) by Andra≈° Urban. Mitru≈°iƒá finished the Musical Academy studies and moved to Italy. In 2001 she participated the Pesme iznad istoka i zapada (Songs Above the East and the West), featuring Serbian rock musicians performing music to the poems by Bishop Nikolaj Velimiroviƒá, with the written music and arrangement for the poem \\"Vladaj, Bo≈æe\\" (\\"Reign, God\\"). In 2004, the two reunited with the rest of the default Luna lineup and performed at the annual Exit festival. During the same year, Ti≈°ma held a solo concert at the Panƒçevo Grrr! festival and the recording from the performance was released the independent record label PMK as La Strada official bootleg album Grrr! 2004, released on CD in a limited edition of 150 copies during the late 2011. In 2012, he won the NIN Award for his novel Bernardijeva soba (Bernardi's Room).  Legacy  Several Serbian bands have covered La Strada songs. The Novi Sad indie rock band Boye on their 1990 album 78 in the song \\"Ja sam radosna\\" (\\"I am Joyful\\"), featuring the lyrics by Slobodan Ti≈°ma, sampled the song \\"Mlad i radostan\\". The Vrbas alternative rock band Veliki Prezir recorded a cover version of \\"Okean\\" on the 1999 cover various artists cover album Korak napred 2 koraka nazad, the Ni≈° punk rock band Novembar recorded a cover of \\"Mlad i radostan\\" on their 2008 cover album Radulizam, and the Belgrade alternative music group Horkestar, consisting of a five-piece band and a thirty piece choir, covered the song \\"Neautentiƒçan sneg\\" on their live appearances. The song \\"Okean\\" was ranked on the No. 39 on the B92 Top 100 Domestic Songs, polled by the Radio B92 listeners in 2006.

On November 2, 1939, Rudaki was incorporated into the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. During the German occupation, the village was located in the Sok√≥lski Poviat (Landkreis Sokolka) in the Bia≈Çystok District (Bezirk Bialystok). In the summer of 1944, on the west bank of ≈öwis≈Çocz, on the hills surrounding Rudaki, the Germans organized fortifications that were interrupted by the Red Army on July 21‚Äì22, 1944. As a result of the German attack on the USSR in 1941 and during the fighting in 1944, 23 Soviet soldiers died in Rudaki.Pogonili ‚ÄûgitlerowskƒÖ swo≈Çocz\\". ≈ªo≈Çnierze ginƒôli setkami. www.isokolka.eu, 2012-07-22 As a result of the fighting, the village was burnt. According to the reports, only 3 farms survived. After the capture of Rudak, some of the men were drafted into the Red Army. Until May 1948 within the borders of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. In the report of the County Inspector for Settlement in October 1946, the village was described as follows: ‚ÄúThe village is generally poor, with about 150 farms. (...) Mixed Polish-Belarusian population. The attitude of the Belarusian population towards the Polish state was at least indifferent. ‚ÄùUW Bia≈Çostocki, Delimitacja granicy polsko- radzieckiej 1945-1948, sygn 638 tekst/str_039.There is a mistake in the description. There were no \\"150 farms\\" in Rudaki, and there were about 150 inhabitants. According to reports, on May 25, 1948, as a result of the delimitation of the border, Rudaki was returned to Poland. The inhabitants of the village, despite the evacuation ordered by the Soviet authorities to the eastern (Soviet) shore of ≈öwis≈Çocz, remained in Rudaki. It was not without struggle and jostling with Soviet soldiers. Unfortunately, the graves (cemetery), where the inhabitants of Rudaki buried their dead for centuries, remained in Ho≈Çynka, on the Soviet side. For some time, funerals were organized in old, dating back to the First World War, graves located in the nearby hills, on plot no. 8 within Rudaki. After 1948, the children of the village attended the elementary school in ≈Åosiniany and Chomontowce, and from 1958 to the newly erected brick elementary school in Kruszyniany. On June 20, 1966, the northern part of the village was destroyed by a fire. Rudaki were electrified in the early 1970s. In the first half of the years. 70 soldiers of the Border Protection Troops arranged a swimming pool on the ≈öwis≈ÇoczƒÖ. At the end of the 1970s, about 50-60 people lived in the village. However, this number was gradually decreasing due to the migration of rural people to urban agglomerations. In 1983, another fire destroyed 4 barns in the southern part of the village.

Thousands of such records were sent to colonial Africa in the 1940s, sparking the creation of new musical styles across the continent. The G.V. Series (perhaps for Grabaci√≥n Victor)White 2002 and Stewart 2004 offer several variations on G. V.'s real and perceived meanings, which include \\"Grabaci√≥n Victor\\" (\\"Victor Recording\\" in Spanish), \\"Grabado en Venezuela\\" (recorded in Venezuela), \\"Gramophone Victor\\", and a popular Congolese nickname \\"Grands Vocalistes\\" (great singers). White (2002) also reports it may only be an EMI records code which lies between G.U. and G.W. were a series of 10 inch 78 rpm Gramophone records produced in Europe and the United States from 1933 to 1958, and exported (or repressed on site) to colonial Tropical Africa. They are credited with introducing Afro-Cuban music into modern African popular culture. The resulting re-interpretations influenced the creation of several genres of African popular music. The Series Over 250 titles (double sided records) were produced in the G.V. Series. The records were launched by the British EMI company's His Master's Voice label in 1933, in part because of shrinking demand during the Great Depression. In the 1940s, HMV reached agreement with other companies, such as RCA Victor to share the royalties of their artists in the production of G.V. Series recordings. Thereafter local distributors were able to request, or press themselves, any of the back catalog of these companies for relatively low cost in Africa, making the records affordable to African listeners for the first time.White (2002) describes this process, citing Gronow, P. The Recording Industry: An Ethnomusicological Approach. Tampere, Finland: University of Tampere Press (1996). At the same time in West Africa (what became Nigeria and Ghana, specifically) EMI was recording and releasing Sakara, Juju and Apala music on 78rpm discs in the Parlophone B, HMV JL, HMV JZ and Decca WA/GWA/NGA series (1947‚Äì52), as well as HMV owned local labels, such as Ghana's Taymani Special.see Chapter Twenty (pp.149‚Äì156) of John Collins. Musicmakers of West Africa. Lynne Rienner Publishers (1985) While there were also domestic record producers beginning to appear in Anglophone West Africa, Francophone Central African music was based on the twin poles of small domestic labels of the 1940s and 50s, and the Latin music supplied by the G.V. Series records and later competitors from Path√© Marconi and Decca.For the impact of the G.V. Series vs. these series of domestic music on Ghanaian and Nigerian music see: John Low.

Series drew on a wide back catalogue of music, they are best known as the first exposure many Africans had to Afro-Cuban music (specifically Son and Son montuno).

Nine initial G.V. records were released in 1933, drawn from EMI's back catalogue of '\\"general ethnic\\" or \\"Spanish\\" recordings, with G.V. 1 being \\"The Peanut Vendor\\" by Don Azpiazu & his Havana Casino Orchestra, recorded New York City, 13 May 1930.John Cowley. uBungca (Oxford Bags): Recordings in London of African and West Indian music in the 1920s and 1930s.

Of particular note were Cuban artists such as Son combo Sexteto Habanero, Trio Matamoros, Don Azpiaz√∫, Abelardo Vald√©s, Antonio Machin, as well as big band leader Xavier Cugat, originally recorded in the United States for the American market. These records spawned some of the most successful modern musical styles West Africa, Central Africa, and East Africa. The most notable of these styles is Congolese Rumba (\\"Soukous\\") which developed in Leopoldville, Belgian Congo (modern Kinshasa, DRC) in the 1940s and 50s. The guitar styles of Highlife music in British colonial West Africa were also highly influenced by these records, as were the stylings of the Dakar sound in Senegal. African guitar playing in general, and the electric guitar in particular, was popularised in part by the music distributed in the G.V. Series records. The music of East Africa was also influenced by the G.V. series, sold through East African Music Stores in Nairobi as its agents in Louren√ßo Marques and Dar-es-Salaam.

History The species rich Bijilo Forest Park is a fenced woodland which was gazetted in 1952 and covers an area of 51.3 hectares situated on the coast just south of the Senegambia area of Kololi. The park consists of mainly of closed canopy forest with a significant number of Borassus aethiopum palms. The park was opened to the public in 1991 and now receives over 23,000 visitors per year. The park lost part of its reserve status in 2018 during the construction of Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara International Conference Center. Facilities There is a 4.5 km nature trail in the park Park is over that takes visitors through the varied habitats of forest, coastal scrubland and sand dunes and there is also a 'straight' footpath which cuts through the scrub and forest close to the beach often referred to as the 'ornithological path'. This route is the one favoured by visiting birdwatchers. There is a small pond within the forest which is maintained to act as a watering hole for many of the forest animals. Signs, benches and viewing point have been provided for visitors. Wildlife Bijilo Forest Park has a diverse fauna of invertebrates, reptiles and mammals. There are troops of green monkeys, Temminck's red colobus, Campbell's mona monkey and patas. The green monkeys have been fed by visitors and this has caused issues, and the park is nominally trying to stop this practice, though park staff still regularly sell visitors peanuts to feed to the monkeys. There is also a population of the nocturnal Senegal bushbaby. Other mammal species which can be seen include the Gambian sun squirrel, African civet, genets, mongooses, brush-tailed porcupine among other smaller, less noticeable species. The forest is also home to a diverse reptile fauna including agama, rainbow and monitor lizards, and some colourful insects and invertebrates including fire ants, dragonflies, termites, butterflies, and the golden silk orb-weaver. 300px Over 133 bird species have been recorded in the Bijilo Forest Park including such species as the black-necked weaver, red-billed hornbill, greater honeyguide, bearded barbet, oriole warbler, palm-nut vulture and long-tailed nightjar. These and the many other species make the area attractive to the many European birdwatchers who visit the Gambia. The birdwatching is most productive towards the coast where migrants such as Caspian tern and osprey can be seen.

The park's tree species include the baobab (Adansonia digitata), red acacia (Acacia seyal), Pterocarpus erinaceus, Ceiba pentandra, Terminalia macroptera, Prosopis africana, and Ficus species. Grasses in the park include Andropogon.  Fauna  The bateleur can be seen in the park The park is an important area for Gambian wildlife, as individuals of most of its remaining mammal species are found within it. These mammals include the African clawless otter (Aonyx capensis), bushbuck (Tragelaphus s. scriptus), caracal (Caracal caracal), common duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia), leopard (Panthera pardus pardus), marsh mongoose (Atilax paludinosus), serval (Leptailurus serval), sitatunga (Tragelaphus spekii), spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus), and West African manatee (Trichechus sengalensis). West African manatees and humpback dolphins are sometimes observed in the Jarin bolon. The park's reptile species include the African python (Python sebae), Bell‚Äôs hinged tortoise (Kinixys belliana nogueyi), West African crocodile (Crocodylus suchus), Nile monitor (Varanus niloticus), puff adder (Bitis arietans), royal python (Python regius), and spitting cobra (Naja nigricollis). The park has more than 300 bird species, more than half of all the bird species that have been recorded in the Gambia. Some of the park's bird species have a very local distribution and are rarely observed in other locations in the Gambia. There are 21 birds of prey, including eagle, falcon, harrier, hawk, and vulture species. There are quite a large number of birds of prey in the park during the dry season. Other bird species in the park include ten kingfisher species, the ground- hornbill, and the threatened brown-necked parrot (Poicephalus robustus fuscicollis), which breeds in the park's mangroves. Other bird species include white-fronted black-chat (Myrmecocichla albifrons), Dorst's cisticola (Cisticola guinea), Burchell's courser (Cursorius rufus), brown-rumped bunting (Emberiza affinis) and chestnut-crowned sparrow-weaver (Plocepasser superciliosus), which have restricted distributions in the Gambia. The bateleur (Terathopius ecaudatus), a short tailed eagle species, is the park's official symbol. The bateleur hunts for sandgrouse and pigeons in the park, and is most often seen there from July to September.  Conservation and tourism  Park entrance Local people are permitted to gather a small amount of firewood and forest products, and to cultivate some rice within the park boundaries. Annual forest fires badly affect the park. In 2001, a large fire burned through the length of the park for two days. The park receives few tourists. November to January are the best months to visit. The park's headquarters and tourist bungalows are located at Dumbutu. Tendaba Camp in Tendaba village has been open since the 1970s and is the most established base for trips to the national park. Chalets in this camp provide accommodation for tourists. The park's road system is underdeveloped. Tubabkollon Point, located near a sandy beach beside the Gambia River in the northeast of the park, is a good place for visitors to watch wildlife. The park is becoming well known as a good place for birdwatching.

Topography  Established in 1978, River Gambia National Park is located in Niamina East district of Central River Division. It lies on the left bank of the Gambia River. The park includes the Baboon Islands archipelago, which consists of one large and four small islands. The national park is not open to the public. River Gambia National Park is adjacent to Nyassang Forest Park. On some maps, the two parks are represented together as one area.  Flora  The vegetation on the flat Baboon Islands is typical of a tropical rainforest in the form of a riparian forest.  Fauna  Since 1979, River Gambia National Park is site of a chimpanzee-reintroduction project, conducted by the Chimpanzee Rehabilitation Project (CRP) under the direction of Stella Marsden (daughter of Eddie Brewer). Chimpanzees confiscated from the illegal animal trade are reintroduced into the wild in the park. Marsden was appointed as Officer of the Order of the British Empire for her work.http://www.panafricanprimates.org Gambia Chimpanzee expert Marsden earns O.B.E. from Queen Elizabethhttps://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/57855/supplement/24/ Prior to 1979, the primates were raised in Abuko Nature Reserve. Today, several chimpanzee groups live unmolested by humans on the three largest river islands (435 ha, 77 ha und 53 ha).Chimpanzee Rehabilitation Association http://www.panafricanprimates.org As of July 2006, there are 77 specimens. In the wild, chimpanzees became extinct in the Gambia in the early 20th century. For the protection of the animals and visitors, entry onto the islands is not permitted, as chimpanzees can be highly aggressive towards humans. Exceptions are possible only with governmental approval. Even travel by boat around the islands was drastically reduced in 1998. In the past, some attempted to steal chimpanzees from the park. Apart from the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus), River Gambia National Park is also home to the Guinea baboon (Papio papio), green monkey (Chlorocebus sabaeus), western red colobus (Piliocolobus badius), and marmosets (Callithrix). Other mammals include the prolific warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) and some hippopotamuses (Hippopotamus amphibius), which have become rare in the Gambia. In addition, the park is home to the aardvark (Orycteropus afer senegalensis), honey badger (Mellivora capensis), serval (Leptailurus serval brachyura), Haussa genet (Genetta thierryi), African clawless otter (Aonyx capensis), and West African manatee (Trichechus senegalensis). Of the antelopes, there is the bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus), Maxwell's duiker (Cephalophus maxwellii), and common duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia). Reptiles are likewise plentiful, and include the Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus), snakes, and lizards. The bird life is equally species-rich.  Notes  Further reading  * Brewer, Stella.

It thus relates the group cohomology with respect to a group to the cohomology with respect to a subgroup. Shapiro's lemma is named after Arnold Shapiro, who proved it in 1961;. however, Beno Eckmann had discovered it earlier, in 1953.. Statement for rings Let R ‚Üí S be a ring homomorphism, so that S becomes a left and right R-module. Let M be a left S-module and N a left R-module. By restriction of scalars, M is also a left R-module. * If S is projective as a right R-module, then: :\\\\operatorname{Ext}^n_R(N, {}_R M) \\\\cong \\\\operatorname{Ext}^n_S(S \\\\otimes_R N, M) * If S is projective as a left R-module, then: :\\\\operatorname{Ext}^n_R({}_R M,N) \\\\cong \\\\operatorname{Ext}^n_S(M,\\\\operatorname{Hom}_R(S,N)) See . The projectivity conditions can be weakened into conditions on the vanishing of certain Tor- or Ext-groups: see . Statement for group rings When H is a subgroup of finite index in G, then the group ring R[G] is finitely generated projective as a left and right R[H] module, so the previous theorem applies in a simple way. Let M be a finite-dimensional representation of G and N a finite-dimensional representation of H. In this case, the module S ‚äóR N is called the induced representation of N from H to G, and RM is called the restricted representation of M from G to H. One has that: :\\\\operatorname{Ext}^n_G( M, N\\\\uparrow_H^G) \\\\cong \\\\operatorname{Ext}^n_H( M\\\\downarrow_H^G, N) When n = 0, this is called Frobenius reciprocity for completely reducible modules, and Nakayama reciprocity in general. See , which also contains these higher versions of the Mackey decomposition. Statement for group cohomology Specializing M to be the trivial module produces the familiar Shapiro's lemma. Let H be a subgroup of G and N a representation of H. For NG the induced representation of N from H to G using the tensor product, and for H* the group homology: :H*(G, NG) = H*(H, N) Similarly, for NG the co-induced representation of N from H to G using the Hom functor, and for H* the group cohomology: :H*(G, NG) = H*(H, N) When H is finite index in G, then the induced and coinduced representations coincide and the lemma is valid for both homology and cohomology.

It is the seventh book in the Lincoln Rhyme series, and also introduces CBI agent Kathryn Dance, who would get her own series of books.  Plot  It is the night of the full Cold Moon‚Äîthe month of December according to the lunar calendar. A young man is found dead in lower Manhattan, the first in a series of victims of a man calling himself the Watchmaker. This killer's obsession with time drives him to plan the murders with the precision of fine timepieces, and the victims die prolonged deaths while an eerie clock ticks away their last minutes on earth. Lincoln Rhyme, Amelia Sachs, and the rest of the crew are tapped to handle the case and stop the Watchmaker and his partner, Vincent Reynolds, a repulsive character with a special interest in the female victims of the killer. Amelia is not only Lincoln's eyes and ears at crime scenes on the Watchmaker case, but she is now running her own homicide investigation‚Äîher first case as lead detective. The policewoman's unwavering efforts in pursuing the killers of a businessman, who left behind a wife and son, sets into motion clockwork gears of its own, with consequences reaching to people and events that will endanger not only many lives but Lincoln's and Amelia's future together. Reception Publishers Weekly reviewed the book saying \\"Deaver fans won't be surprised that the investigations overlap, or that the several apparent climaxes are building to something more, but even they will be hard-pressed to peel back all the layers of the cunning plot at work beneath the surface.\\" Joe Hartlaub of BookReporter.com reviewed the book, saying \\"As always, Deaver educates as well as entertains, and within the novel's pages he drops small but fascinating nuggets regarding time and clocks. If you don't know why we say 'speed up' or 'slow down,' you will after reading THE COLD MOON. You will also have the pleasure of reading what is not only Deaver's best work to date but also one of the best books of the year thus far\\".

The Canadian paddlewheeler PS Accommodation was the first successful steamboat built entirely in North America in 1808. The PS Frontenac was the first on the Great Lakes. The Rideau Canal, St. Lawrence River, and large rivers of the west provided ample areas to work in. Samuel Cunard of Nova Scotia developed the successful Atlantic Steam Liner service in the 1830s with the SS Royal William. While shipbuilding and huge fleets of lakers on the Great Lakes proliferated in the nineteenth century. Their success led to penetration deep into the central continent, with the Anson Northrup in 1859 which became first steamer to cross the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border on the Red River, via the US Mississippi River system. Steamboats would also be involved in major political events, as when Louis Riel seized the International at Fort Garry, or Gabriel Dumont was engaged by the vessel Northcote at Batoche. On the Pacific Coast the SS Beaver was the first steamer in the Northwest waters; it worked for the Hudson's Bay Company from 1835. The Vancouver was a steamboat built and operated by the Hudson's Bay Company to serve on the route to and from London, England to Fort Victoria on Vancouver Island. It was built in 1845. Shipbuilding continued into the next century with the Imperial Munitions Board and the Victory Ship of later years.http://www.w3.marmuseum.ca/MillsUpdateSept04.html See also The Keewatin at rest in Saugatuck, Michigan. *Steamboats of the Ma *Steamboats of the Skeena *Steamboats of the Columbia River *Canadian Pacific Railway *CP Ships *Canada Steamship Lines *SS Keewatin *SS Wexford *SS Kamloops *SS Norisle *CSS Acadia *HMCS Haida *HMCS Sackville (K181) *Cunard Line *Foundation Maritime *HMCS Sudbury (K162) *Toronto Island ferries *Owen Sound Transportation Company Limited *Maid of the Mist *Allan Line Royal Mail Steamers *Moyie (sternwheeler) *Sicamous (sternwheeler) *HMCS Cape Breton *SS Master *HMCS Sudbury (K162)  References  Category:Steamboats of Canada Category:History of transport in Canada ","title":"Steamboats in Canada"},{"id":"18665475","text":"Bieniasze refers to the following places in Poland: * Bieniasze, Podlaskie Voivodeship * Bieniasze, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship ","title":"Bieniasze"},{"id":"18665476","text":"Bieniasze is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Sidra, within Sok√≥≈Çka County, Podlaskie Voivodeship, in north-eastern Poland.
